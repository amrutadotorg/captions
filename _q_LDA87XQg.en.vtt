WEBVTT

00:07.303 --> 00:13.837
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

00:14.037 --> 00:21.177
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

00:23.267 --> 00:25.557
We can say this is the worship

00:25.757 --> 00:29.647
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

00:29.847 --> 00:39.577
If you understand that all this,

00:39.777 --> 00:46.607
whatever is created on this universe,

00:46.817 --> 00:54.057
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:54.497 --> 00:58.187
Now many people believe that there is one God.

00:58.387 --> 01:03.397
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

01:03.597 --> 01:11.947
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

01:12.147 --> 01:19.257
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

01:19.617 --> 01:27.447
So, first of all, He did was to create

01:27.647 --> 01:31.217
the power of Adi Shakti.

01:31.427 --> 01:37.757
When It was created then there was a sound,

01:37.957 --> 01:41.817
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

01:42.017 --> 01:44.237
by the primordial sound,

01:44.437 --> 01:48.497
and these three powers came out of that sound -

01:48.697 --> 01:54.217
is A, U and M -Aum.

01:54.607 --> 01:59.037
The Adi Shakti is the One

01:59.237 --> 02:06.517
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

02:07.367 --> 02:14.217
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

02:14.417 --> 02:20.977
and for His own expression,

02:21.177 --> 02:24.497
for His own manifestation,

02:24.697 --> 02:28.817
for His own reflection.

02:29.937 --> 02:34.717
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

02:34.917 --> 02:39.817
so He must have thought of creating a partner

02:40.017 --> 02:45.487
who will manifest His desires.

02:45.997 --> 02:55.497
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

02:55.697 --> 03:02.007
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

03:02.207 --> 03:07.487
His desire to create.

03:08.167 --> 03:12.227
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

03:12.427 --> 03:16.867
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

03:17.067 --> 03:20.897
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

03:21.097 --> 03:27.087
The attention has its own joy

03:27.287 --> 03:31.897
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

03:32.097 --> 03:35.257
She created all the universes,

03:35.457 --> 03:40.167
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

03:40.367 --> 03:45.857
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

03:46.067 --> 03:49.617
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

03:49.817 --> 03:56.207
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

03:57.617 --> 04:00.337
At this juncture one may ask that,

04:00.547 --> 04:05.707
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

04:06.257 --> 04:09.117
That was the idea of God Almighty,

04:09.317 --> 04:16.027
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

04:16.227 --> 04:22.507
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

04:22.777 --> 04:25.517
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

04:25.717 --> 04:29.677
She had Her own way of expression,

04:29.877 --> 04:33.607
that She thought She must create the mirrors

04:33.807 --> 04:39.247
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

04:39.447 --> 04:41.097
to see His character

04:41.307 --> 04:47.067
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

04:49.337 --> 04:53.667
This evolution had to work out this way

04:53.867 --> 04:59.497
because they had to know from where they come.

04:59.737 --> 05:05.927
We must know that we come from nature.

05:06.127 --> 05:11.827
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

05:12.037 --> 05:16.887
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

05:17.087 --> 05:22.947
And She too is not just a dead earth,

05:23.147 --> 05:27.687
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

05:27.897 --> 05:33.507
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

05:33.707 --> 05:40.697
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

05:40.897 --> 05:46.637
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

05:46.837 --> 05:51.477
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

05:51.677 --> 05:55.877
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

05:56.077 --> 06:00.017
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

06:00.217 --> 06:02.597
See the whole plan that was made.

06:02.797 --> 06:08.227
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

06:08.437 --> 06:13.187
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

06:13.387 --> 06:16.377
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

06:16.577 --> 06:18.897
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

06:19.097 --> 06:22.617
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

06:22.817 --> 06:28.707
This is the power that does all the living work,

06:28.907 --> 06:34.927
all the organization, all the creation.

06:39.487 --> 06:44.757
In our human ego we start thinking that

06:44.957 --> 06:48.807
we do something, we can create.

06:49.007 --> 06:55.307
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

06:55.507 --> 06:57.887
leave alone anything else.

06:58.087 --> 07:03.157
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

07:03.357 --> 07:08.857
we can put together and create something,

07:09.057 --> 07:18.437
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

07:18.637 --> 07:23.517
any power.

07:23.717 --> 07:26.757
We cannot create anything.

07:26.957 --> 07:34.727
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

07:34.927 --> 07:40.337
For example, something is made of gold.

07:40.537 --> 07:43.667
Still it is gold.

07:43.867 --> 07:47.007
Now something is made of wood,

07:47.207 --> 07:51.607
whatever it is made, is wood.

07:51.807 --> 07:55.377
The principle is the same into everything.

07:55.577 --> 08:00.297
So whatever may be your birth,

08:00.497 --> 08:03.377
whatever may be the country you are born,

08:03.577 --> 08:10.117
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

08:10.317 --> 08:13.937
basically you all are the same.

08:14.137 --> 08:19.577
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

08:19.777 --> 08:23.987
also, you cry the same way.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.857
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

08:28.057 --> 08:32.717
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

08:33.801 --> 08:38.847
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

08:39.047 --> 08:43.707
by some common principle of life.

08:43.907 --> 08:49.317
And the common principle of life that has bound us

08:49.527 --> 08:56.367
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

08:56.567 --> 08:59.277
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

08:59.477 --> 09:01.727
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

09:01.927 --> 09:06.067
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

09:06.267 --> 09:15.347
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

09:15.547 --> 09:18.827
But in the human form only

09:19.027 --> 09:25.967
it has evolved as a connection,

09:26.167 --> 09:31.557
as one that is the divine force within us,

09:31.757 --> 09:37.057
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

09:37.257 --> 09:43.207
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

09:43.407 --> 09:46.767
This is the common principle we all have.

09:46.967 --> 09:54.267
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

09:54.467 --> 09:59.447
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

09:59.657 --> 10:06.577
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

10:07.157 --> 10:09.727
Then there are people, as you people are,

10:09.927 --> 10:14.737
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

10:14.947 --> 10:17.907
who have got your realization.

10:18.107 --> 10:22.327
So when you understand that this is the

10:22.527 --> 10:29.467
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

10:29.667 --> 10:33.247
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

10:33.447 --> 10:35.137
and the enjoyment.

10:35.337 --> 10:45.077
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

10:45.287 --> 10:48.837
what should happen to you?

10:49.037 --> 10:53.487
What should we feel?

10:53.687 --> 10:59.777
How do we then exist?

11:00.497 --> 11:05.787
This is the question many a times you have asked.

11:06.147 --> 11:09.647
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

11:09.847 --> 11:11.277
that you are not there,

11:11.477 --> 11:15.407
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

11:15.607 --> 11:17.577
Secondly, what happens to you

11:17.777 --> 11:22.497
is that you become just the existence.

11:22.697 --> 11:25.457
Just the existence.

11:25.657 --> 11:28.207
And that existence that you become,

11:28.407 --> 11:33.767
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

11:34.287 --> 11:39.387
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

11:39.587 --> 11:41.427
also much before.

11:41.627 --> 11:44.137
In every religion we have had people

11:44.337 --> 11:48.807
who had this divine character very well developed.

11:49.007 --> 11:54.157
For example, even you can say,

11:54.357 --> 12:01.327
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

12:01.527 --> 12:08.397
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

12:08.597 --> 12:11.067
and a khumba also,

12:11.267 --> 12:14.147
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

12:14.347 --> 12:20.947
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

12:21.147 --> 12:25.757
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

12:25.957 --> 12:30.897
You know that there is this power within us.

12:31.107 --> 12:36.467
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

12:36.677 --> 12:42.107
from the middle path of our ascent.

12:42.307 --> 12:44.937
Here also the same Kundalini,

12:45.137 --> 12:50.343
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

12:50.757 --> 12:57.217
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

12:57.417 --> 13:02.227
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

13:02.427 --> 13:06.717
So now when we are enlightened people,

13:06.927 --> 13:12.097
we have become saints and we are above all others,

13:12.297 --> 13:19.367
what should we do is to understand fully well -

13:19.567 --> 13:22.677
not only mentally, but from your heart -

13:22.877 --> 13:28.987
that now you have got these divine vibrations

13:29.187 --> 13:34.277
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

13:34.477 --> 13:39.717
what are you, where is the problem.

13:39.917 --> 13:42.837
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

13:43.037 --> 13:47.567
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

13:47.767 --> 13:51.137
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

13:51.337 --> 13:54.717
with spiritual vibrations."

13:54.917 --> 13:57.327
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

13:57.527 --> 13:59.487
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

13:59.687 --> 14:03.877
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

14:04.077 --> 14:08.117
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

14:08.317 --> 14:10.227
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

14:10.427 --> 14:12.317
from here only there are vibrations,

14:12.517 --> 14:14.887
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

14:15.087 --> 14:17.457
So then he sat down and started wondering,

14:17.657 --> 14:22.707
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

14:22.907 --> 14:28.617
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

14:28.817 --> 14:32.647
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

14:32.857 --> 14:36.757
and that's how he found the place.

14:37.157 --> 14:39.427
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

14:39.627 --> 14:42.537
is not done haphazard, in any way.

14:42.737 --> 14:45.907
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

14:46.107 --> 14:52.237
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

14:52.817 --> 14:58.257
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

14:58.677 --> 15:01.007
We are the ones which spoil the nature

15:01.207 --> 15:05.507
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

15:05.707 --> 15:07.807
and we have to respect it.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.097
I've already told you many a times

15:10.297 --> 15:13.187
about how human beings were formed

15:13.387 --> 15:20.337
by different chemicals who came also,

15:20.537 --> 15:23.597
carbon came from the mother earth.

15:23.797 --> 15:27.037
All this leads us to understand

15:27.237 --> 15:31.887
that we have a very big responsibility.

15:32.447 --> 15:38.437
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

15:38.637 --> 15:41.347
And now you all have reached a state

15:41.547 --> 15:45.487
where you have become yourself.

15:45.687 --> 15:47.837
You know yourself.

15:48.037 --> 15:52.087
This is a very big, I think should say,

15:52.287 --> 15:59.597
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

16:01.967 --> 16:08.717
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

16:38.187 --> 16:43.597
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

16:43.797 --> 16:50.917
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

16:51.117 --> 17:00.797
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

17:02.237 --> 17:07.287
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

17:07.487 --> 17:11.217
and these centers have to be awakened

17:11.417 --> 17:14.917
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

17:15.117 --> 17:22.897
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

17:23.757 --> 17:32.687
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

17:32.887 --> 17:37.617
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

17:37.817 --> 17:43.747
from the path of your perfection.

17:44.847 --> 17:48.287
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

17:48.487 --> 17:52.997
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

17:53.207 --> 17:57.117
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

17:57.317 --> 18:01.937
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

18:02.137 --> 18:06.897
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

18:07.207 --> 18:10.987
There are so many ways of people relating

18:11.187 --> 18:14.847
to the power of the Divine.

18:15.057 --> 18:19.337
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

18:19.537 --> 18:25.007
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

18:25.207 --> 18:28.387
and through Her the whole universe was created.

18:28.587 --> 18:36.327
But also true that as you are seeking,

18:36.537 --> 18:39.777
also the Divine is seeking you.

18:39.977 --> 18:48.327
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

18:48.527 --> 18:56.087
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

18:56.287 --> 19:02.047
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

19:02.247 --> 19:06.217
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

19:06.417 --> 19:09.387
It is the One which has given you

19:09.587 --> 19:12.567
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

19:12.767 --> 19:17.117
"Whatever we have is given by You".

19:17.437 --> 19:21.827
If that is the case that all that you have

19:22.027 --> 19:26.477
is given by your Kundalini,

19:26.687 --> 19:30.377
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

19:30.577 --> 19:35.337
then is very important to understand what is the need

19:35.587 --> 19:43.207
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

19:44.657 --> 19:52.177
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

19:53.607 --> 19:56.787
As I said, there's a relationship

19:56.987 --> 20:03.517
between the realized souls and the Divine.

20:03.717 --> 20:07.577
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

20:07.787 --> 20:13.447
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

20:13.647 --> 20:17.087
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

20:17.287 --> 20:20.137
It's such a relationship.

20:20.337 --> 20:23.467
And it's so close, it's so close,

20:23.667 --> 20:28.927
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

20:29.127 --> 20:36.027
or the moon has its own moonlight.

20:36.227 --> 20:47.457
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

20:47.657 --> 20:52.877
and that should give you full control over yourself

20:53.077 --> 20:58.417
and over your development.

20:58.917 --> 21:06.467
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

21:07.327 --> 21:11.087
Now

21:16.682 --> 21:21.817
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

21:22.037 --> 21:24.747
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

21:24.947 --> 21:26.347
you may.

21:26.557 --> 21:28.487
But as soon as that person will disappear,

21:28.687 --> 21:31.787
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

21:31.987 --> 21:35.257
That surrender has no meaning.

21:35.457 --> 21:41.687
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

21:41.887 --> 21:45.817
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

21:46.027 --> 21:49.607
because it has a reaction.

21:49.807 --> 21:57.827
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

21:58.057 --> 22:13.927
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

22:14.127 --> 22:19.827
into the water automatically,

22:20.027 --> 22:27.767
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

22:28.367 --> 22:32.807
If you can just feel that within yourself,

22:33.007 --> 22:36.197
that you are one with the Divine.

22:36.397 --> 22:41.487
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

22:41.987 --> 22:51.857
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

22:52.067 --> 22:58.457
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

22:58.657 --> 23:05.637
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

23:06.267 --> 23:11.617
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

23:11.817 --> 23:15.657
There's a great joy in forgiving,

23:15.857 --> 23:20.377
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

23:20.577 --> 23:26.877
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.987
Nobody can disturb you.

23:31.187 --> 23:35.637
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

23:35.837 --> 23:38.077
that is what is forgiveness.

23:38.277 --> 23:42.797
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

23:42.997 --> 23:45.737
or to do something against somebody.

23:45.937 --> 23:49.927
The Divine takes over from you

23:50.127 --> 23:53.027
and does whatever is needed,

23:53.227 --> 23:59.897
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

24:00.297 --> 24:05.457
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

24:05.657 --> 24:07.897
say in Islam called ruh;

24:08.097 --> 24:12.877
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

24:13.077 --> 24:17.257
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

24:17.457 --> 24:23.217
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

24:23.417 --> 24:28.017
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.777
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

24:31.977 --> 24:37.537
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

24:37.737 --> 24:42.697
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

24:42.907 --> 24:45.237
how to make others feel it.

24:45.437 --> 24:48.927
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

24:49.127 --> 24:51.177
or something nonsensical.

24:51.377 --> 24:55.157
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

24:55.357 --> 25:01.277
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

25:01.477 --> 25:07.317
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

25:07.517 --> 25:11.597
that you know there is this Power.

25:11.797 --> 25:14.147
You're sure about this Power

25:14.347 --> 25:18.527
because you can feel it within yourself.

25:18.727 --> 25:21.667
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

25:21.877 --> 25:28.047
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

25:28.247 --> 25:33.857
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

25:34.057 --> 25:43.387
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

25:43.597 --> 25:46.827
She tells you the truth.

25:48.877 --> 25:53.867
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

25:54.067 --> 25:58.707
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

25:58.907 --> 26:02.667
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

26:02.877 --> 26:08.097
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

26:08.297 --> 26:10.647
This kind of argument is possible.

26:10.847 --> 26:13.567
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

26:13.767 --> 26:16.437
that you forgive that person,

26:16.637 --> 26:21.227
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

26:21.427 --> 26:24.247
you don't do anything.

26:24.447 --> 26:25.927
That's the truth.

26:26.137 --> 26:30.677
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

26:30.877 --> 26:34.337
compassion becomes the truth.

26:34.537 --> 26:38.217
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

26:38.417 --> 26:41.557
So all the absolute truth that you know is

26:41.757 --> 26:46.397
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

26:46.597 --> 26:51.307
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

26:51.507 --> 26:54.677
and we felt this way and still it happened."

26:54.887 --> 26:57.817
It makes no difference.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.877
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

27:01.077 --> 27:05.117
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

27:05.317 --> 27:09.547
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

27:09.747 --> 27:14.367
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

27:14.567 --> 27:17.967
Because it had to be the other way round.

27:18.167 --> 27:21.577
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

27:21.787 --> 27:26.607
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

27:26.807 --> 27:29.507
So, it's a play going on.

27:29.707 --> 27:35.967
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

27:36.177 --> 27:44.917
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

27:45.117 --> 27:50.427
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

27:50.627 --> 27:55.097
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

27:55.297 --> 27:59.207
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

27:59.407 --> 28:06.937
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

28:07.217 --> 28:15.777
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

28:16.257 --> 28:18.907
When you have the enlightened faith,

28:19.107 --> 28:25.637
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

28:25.837 --> 28:31.677
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

28:32.167 --> 28:36.997
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

28:37.197 --> 28:42.877
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

28:43.267 --> 28:46.657
Not necessarily. It's a play.

28:46.857 --> 28:54.747
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

28:54.947 --> 28:58.287
So if you can become the witness,

28:58.487 --> 29:02.057
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

29:02.257 --> 29:09.667
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

29:10.137 --> 29:15.857
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

29:16.057 --> 29:18.917
That dissolution has to take place.

29:19.117 --> 29:22.837
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

29:23.037 --> 29:28.577
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

29:28.777 --> 29:32.877
this work could not have been done.

29:33.087 --> 29:38.137
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

29:38.337 --> 29:50.237
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

29:50.447 --> 29:54.307
all the aspects of this human life.

29:54.507 --> 29:58.077
It had to be such an Incarnation

29:58.277 --> 30:06.267
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

30:06.467 --> 30:10.787
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

30:10.987 --> 30:18.617
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

30:18.817 --> 30:21.847
as a whole, as a human being.

30:22.047 --> 30:26.377
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

30:26.577 --> 30:29.897
all of them are just the same.

30:30.107 --> 30:39.267
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

30:39.467 --> 30:43.347
some are not seeking genuinely,

30:43.547 --> 30:46.997
and some are not seeking at all.

30:47.197 --> 30:52.087
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

30:52.297 --> 30:58.137
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

30:58.337 --> 31:02.907
one fish came out of the mother.

31:03.107 --> 31:10.077
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

31:10.277 --> 31:15.597
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

31:15.797 --> 31:20.827
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

31:21.227 --> 31:27.937
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

31:28.437 --> 31:32.807
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

31:33.007 --> 31:36.817
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

31:37.017 --> 31:39.627
James or what St. John has said,

31:39.827 --> 31:42.677
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.427
It doesn't matter.

31:44.627 --> 31:52.297
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

31:52.507 --> 31:56.477
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

31:56.677 --> 32:01.487
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

32:01.687 --> 32:06.907
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

32:07.107 --> 32:11.107
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

32:11.307 --> 32:14.087
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

32:14.287 --> 32:18.347
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

32:18.547 --> 32:22.507
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

32:22.707 --> 32:24.687
should not disturb you much

32:24.887 --> 32:29.437
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

32:29.637 --> 32:33.487
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

32:33.687 --> 32:38.027
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

32:38.227 --> 32:44.077
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

32:44.277 --> 32:48.267
all the useless things that we have,

32:48.467 --> 32:51.837
like our conditioning and our ego.

32:52.047 --> 32:55.067
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

32:55.267 --> 32:58.987
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

32:59.187 --> 33:03.057
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

33:03.257 --> 33:07.497
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

33:07.697 --> 33:09.437
That's human nature also.

33:09.637 --> 33:13.277
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

33:13.477 --> 33:17.007
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

33:17.207 --> 33:20.787
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

33:20.987 --> 33:25.447
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

33:25.647 --> 33:27.587
It will all work out.

33:27.787 --> 33:32.007
It will all work out, but your attention should be

33:32.207 --> 33:39.377
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

33:39.577 --> 33:42.197
of this compassion?".

33:42.397 --> 33:47.727
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

33:47.927 --> 33:51.457
which is going to give you strength.

33:51.657 --> 33:54.687
This compassion within you,

33:54.887 --> 33:58.467
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

33:58.667 --> 34:01.947
completely destroyed,

34:02.147 --> 34:05.947
your compassion itself will make you powerful

34:06.147 --> 34:10.407
and you'll do everything that is needed.

34:10.607 --> 34:14.937
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

34:15.137 --> 34:23.307
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

34:23.577 --> 34:26.217
And amazingly as you will do this,

34:26.417 --> 34:31.207
your own level of spirituality will rise.

34:33.087 --> 34:36.037
As you see, I would say,

34:36.237 --> 34:41.537
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

34:41.737 --> 34:44.087
the water rises.

34:44.287 --> 34:50.357
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

34:50.557 --> 34:54.337
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

34:54.537 --> 34:58.947
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

34:59.147 --> 35:01.497
there will be much more manifestation

35:01.697 --> 35:07.937
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

35:08.297 --> 35:14.817
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

35:15.017 --> 35:17.527
you all have got your Realization

35:17.727 --> 35:22.127
and that you are all now saintly people,

35:22.327 --> 35:25.727
then we should see to people who were like you.

35:25.927 --> 35:29.917
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

35:30.117 --> 35:33.957
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

35:34.157 --> 35:39.547
What did they do? They went all out

35:39.747 --> 35:43.917
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

35:44.117 --> 35:46.197
They could not give realization as such,

35:46.397 --> 35:48.907
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

35:49.107 --> 35:53.507
they talked about it, they sang about it.

35:53.707 --> 35:56.887
That's what we have to understand

35:57.117 --> 36:06.237
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

36:06.437 --> 36:08.727
When you know the people are getting drowned,

36:08.927 --> 36:14.197
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

36:14.397 --> 36:20.157
I should say,

36:20.357 --> 36:26.017
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

36:26.227 --> 36:29.267
And if you have that compassion within you,

36:29.477 --> 36:34.517
you will go all out to save them.

36:34.717 --> 36:40.677
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

36:40.877 --> 36:45.747
of this enjoyment of your attention.

36:45.947 --> 36:49.257
Your attention itself will enjoy

36:49.457 --> 36:58.597
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

36:58.797 --> 37:01.827
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

37:02.027 --> 37:05.347
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

37:05.547 --> 37:11.197
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

37:11.397 --> 37:17.707
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

37:17.907 --> 37:20.387
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

37:20.587 --> 37:25.157
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

37:25.357 --> 37:31.647
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

37:31.847 --> 37:36.947
The more you use this power the better it will be.

37:37.147 --> 37:42.067
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

37:42.267 --> 37:46.257
For we haven't got many people from the black race

37:46.457 --> 37:48.387
I think, from Africa.

37:48.587 --> 37:52.917
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

37:53.117 --> 37:56.317
Also, we have so many other areas

37:56.517 --> 37:59.747
where I find we have to work it out,

37:59.947 --> 38:06.607
that if this compassion is within you

38:06.807 --> 38:09.147
then it will compel you, also,

38:09.347 --> 38:13.057
to do work that will bring solace to people

38:13.257 --> 38:15.977
who are not even seeking.

38:16.177 --> 38:21.317
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

38:21.517 --> 38:26.747
which will really create very beautiful institutions

38:26.947 --> 38:31.617
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

38:31.817 --> 38:35.857
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

38:36.057 --> 38:40.697
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

38:40.897 --> 38:46.147
you have dropped out your greed,

38:46.347 --> 38:52.357
you have dropped out your lust.

38:52.557 --> 38:57.527
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

38:57.737 --> 39:01.437
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

39:01.637 --> 39:05.077
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

39:05.277 --> 39:07.167
and then they start becoming leaders,

39:07.367 --> 39:13.067
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

39:13.267 --> 39:16.127
This you will not do.

39:16.327 --> 39:23.357
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

39:23.557 --> 39:29.787
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

39:29.987 --> 39:36.227
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

39:36.427 --> 39:40.497
Once we start spreading out like that,

39:40.697 --> 39:43.567
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

39:43.777 --> 39:46.797
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

39:46.997 --> 39:53.627
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

39:53.827 --> 39:57.457
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

39:57.657 --> 39:59.557
who don't have greed.

39:59.757 --> 40:02.697
I have known people who never had any greed,

40:02.897 --> 40:08.577
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

40:08.777 --> 40:12.087
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

40:12.317 --> 40:15.887
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

40:16.087 --> 40:19.517
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

40:19.717 --> 40:22.147
But not Sahaja Yogis.

40:22.347 --> 40:24.577
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

40:24.777 --> 40:30.647
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

40:30.847 --> 40:33.997
Not their lust, not their greed

40:34.197 --> 40:37.917
and also the so-called deviations

40:38.117 --> 40:44.737
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

40:45.017 --> 40:47.667
Because they know what do they enjoy,

40:47.867 --> 40:50.257
where lies their enjoyment.

40:50.457 --> 40:52.857
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

40:53.057 --> 40:56.667
you will try to have more of it

40:56.867 --> 41:01.677
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

41:01.877 --> 41:04.787
I would say as the men are working it out,

41:04.987 --> 41:06.727
women should work it out

41:06.927 --> 41:12.287
because women have more sense of compassion,

41:12.487 --> 41:16.837
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

41:17.037 --> 41:20.037
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

41:20.237 --> 41:23.127
I'm saying about normal.

41:23.327 --> 41:28.587
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

41:28.787 --> 41:33.287
they have known what is love for the children is.

41:33.487 --> 41:35.247
Mother doesn't expect anything.

41:35.447 --> 41:39.127
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

41:39.327 --> 41:42.327
She enjoys her child, that's all.

41:42.527 --> 41:49.347
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

41:49.557 --> 41:51.507
See, I have seen young girls.

41:51.707 --> 41:55.107
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

41:55.317 --> 41:58.747
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

41:58.947 --> 42:03.567
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

42:03.777 --> 42:09.907
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

42:10.107 --> 42:14.247
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

42:14.457 --> 42:18.747
And as you are all married also,

42:18.947 --> 42:23.957
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

42:24.157 --> 42:30.887
by your own nature of Divinity.

42:31.087 --> 42:33.207
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

42:33.417 --> 42:37.297
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

42:37.497 --> 42:41.337
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

42:41.537 --> 42:44.987
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

42:45.187 --> 42:48.737
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

42:48.937 --> 42:51.967
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

42:52.167 --> 42:59.847
And if something

43:00.047 --> 43:02.347
has to be done, has to be done.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.727
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

43:04.927 --> 43:08.477
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

43:08.677 --> 43:11.857
and the household and this and that".

43:12.057 --> 43:15.657
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

43:15.657 --> 43:18.387
The whole day, what will you do?

43:18.587 --> 43:22.137
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

43:22.337 --> 43:26.187
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

43:26.387 --> 43:30.607
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

43:30.807 --> 43:35.757
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

43:35.957 --> 43:41.607
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

43:41.807 --> 43:49.977
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

43:50.177 --> 43:54.117
then you'll be never tired.

43:54.317 --> 43:57.157
You will never grudge.

43:57.357 --> 44:02.617
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

44:03.067 --> 44:06.857
This is a very important point that we should realize

44:07.057 --> 44:10.357
that if somebody is a woman or a man

44:10.557 --> 44:16.467
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

44:16.667 --> 44:21.507
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

44:21.707 --> 44:26.077
She has more power of compassion.

44:26.277 --> 44:29.597
In the same way the man has more power of action.

44:29.807 --> 44:32.797
So, the compassion has to become active.

44:32.997 --> 44:36.057
In this combination everything will work out

44:36.267 --> 44:38.537
in a very beautiful manner.

44:38.737 --> 44:43.517
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

44:43.717 --> 44:48.487
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

44:48.687 --> 44:51.747
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

44:51.947 --> 44:53.927
some of the women have been men

44:54.127 --> 44:58.777
and some of the men have been women.

44:58.977 --> 45:03.347
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

45:03.557 --> 45:09.277
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

45:09.477 --> 45:10.897
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

45:11.097 --> 45:13.637
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

45:13.837 --> 45:16.537
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

45:16.747 --> 45:18.537
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

45:18.747 --> 45:21.547
Now here you should understand the relationship

45:21.757 --> 45:26.057
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

45:26.257 --> 45:32.227
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

45:32.437 --> 45:34.727
God Almighty is the Spectator;

45:34.927 --> 45:39.687
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

45:39.887 --> 45:42.297
She is compassion, of course.

45:42.497 --> 45:46.277
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

45:46.477 --> 45:49.897
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

45:50.097 --> 45:54.197
But He's the One who takes charge.

45:54.397 --> 45:59.437
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

45:59.637 --> 46:03.707
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

46:03.907 --> 46:08.807
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

46:09.017 --> 46:12.307
how it has worked out.

46:12.507 --> 46:16.557
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

46:16.757 --> 46:20.827
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

46:21.027 --> 46:25.517
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

46:25.717 --> 46:31.047
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

46:31.247 --> 46:33.017
I can't understand

46:33.217 --> 46:37.057
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

46:37.267 --> 46:43.937
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

46:44.137 --> 46:47.937
who knows what is the truth,

46:48.137 --> 46:57.037
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

46:57.237 --> 47:06.227
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

47:07.917 --> 47:11.637
It is to realize

47:11.837 --> 47:20.087
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

47:20.387 --> 47:24.327
You have entered into His kingdom

47:24.527 --> 47:30.867
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

47:31.067 --> 47:34.337
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

47:34.537 --> 47:37.217
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

47:37.417 --> 47:41.097
he still begs sitting on this throne.

47:41.297 --> 47:45.097
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

47:45.297 --> 47:47.967
I receive some funny letters sometimes

47:48.167 --> 47:52.707
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

47:52.907 --> 47:58.177
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

47:58.377 --> 48:04.277
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

48:04.487 --> 48:06.847
because it has a very bad impression,

48:07.047 --> 48:12.297
also, for other people and for your own life.

48:12.497 --> 48:16.137
For your own life, is very important

48:16.337 --> 48:20.517
that you should grow fully into the understanding

48:20.717 --> 48:26.647
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

48:26.847 --> 48:30.917
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

48:31.117 --> 48:35.247
What do you have to surrender?

48:36.817 --> 48:39.687
Just think of it.

48:39.887 --> 48:47.217
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

48:47.417 --> 48:53.527
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

48:53.727 --> 49:00.307
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

49:00.507 --> 49:05.297
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

49:05.497 --> 49:10.287
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

49:10.487 --> 49:13.537
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

49:13.737 --> 49:15.277
Impossible.

49:15.477 --> 49:20.547
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

49:20.747 --> 49:23.317
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

49:23.517 --> 49:26.727
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

49:26.927 --> 49:33.447
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

49:33.647 --> 49:37.467
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

49:37.667 --> 49:44.007
have to enter into and work out.

49:44.207 --> 49:45.727
You can do it.

49:45.927 --> 49:51.187
You see, I was surprised that in this place

49:51.387 --> 49:56.577
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

49:56.777 --> 50:01.207
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

50:01.407 --> 50:04.447
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

50:04.647 --> 50:11.467
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

50:11.667 --> 50:17.247
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

50:17.447 --> 50:20.497
As it is growing in quantity,

50:20.697 --> 50:24.407
it should also grow in quality.

50:24.607 --> 50:29.467
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

50:29.667 --> 50:31.777
Because I know all the time

50:31.987 --> 50:34.827
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

50:35.027 --> 50:38.307
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

50:38.507 --> 50:42.657
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

50:42.857 --> 50:44.867
I know that feeling you have that,

50:45.067 --> 50:48.497
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

50:48.697 --> 50:50.567
So forget about them.

50:50.777 --> 50:57.497
But those who are seeking, approach them.

50:57.707 --> 50:59.857
They are your real relations.

51:00.057 --> 51:03.967
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

51:04.167 --> 51:07.867
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

51:08.067 --> 51:11.107
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

51:11.307 --> 51:15.507
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

51:15.707 --> 51:19.447
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

51:19.647 --> 51:22.357
You should find out where are they.

51:22.557 --> 51:25.267
My attention is, of course, is with you

51:25.467 --> 51:30.247
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

51:30.457 --> 51:31.857
Whatever you want,

51:32.057 --> 51:36.547
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

51:36.747 --> 51:42.107
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

51:42.317 --> 51:45.327
Because you take it upon yourself.

51:45.527 --> 51:51.067
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

51:51.267 --> 51:58.427
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

51:58.637 --> 52:05.197
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

52:05.917 --> 52:09.147
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

52:09.347 --> 52:13.187
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

52:13.387 --> 52:17.377
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

52:17.587 --> 52:20.627
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

52:20.837 --> 52:23.027
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

52:23.227 --> 52:26.227
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

52:26.427 --> 52:27.917
is Adi Shakti.

52:28.117 --> 52:31.417
It's very important that this puja must be performed

52:31.617 --> 52:37.687
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

52:37.887 --> 52:40.847
and you grow more and more within yourself

52:41.047 --> 52:45.777
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

52:45.977 --> 52:50.777
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

52:50.977 --> 52:53.457
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

52:53.657 --> 52:57.487
within you is the Kundalini.

52:57.687 --> 52:58.937
So, you have to worship.

52:59.137 --> 53:03.297
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

53:03.497 --> 53:06.867
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

53:07.067 --> 53:10.567
May God bless you.
