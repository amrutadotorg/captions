00:00:07.303 --> 00:00:13.837
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:21.177
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:25.557
We can say this is the worship

00:00:25.757 --> 00:00:29.647
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:39.577
If you understand that all this,

00:00:39.777 --> 00:00:46.607
whatever is created on this universe,

00:00:46.817 --> 00:00:54.057
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:00:54.497 --> 00:00:58.187
Now many people believe that there is one God.

00:00:58.387 --> 00:01:03.397
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:11.947
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

00:01:12.147 --> 00:01:19.257
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

00:01:19.617 --> 00:01:27.447
So, first of all, He did was to create

00:01:27.647 --> 00:01:31.217
the power of Adi Shakti.

00:01:31.427 --> 00:01:37.757
When It was created then there was a sound,

00:01:37.957 --> 00:01:41.817
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

00:01:42.017 --> 00:01:44.237
by the primordial sound,

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:48.497
and these three powers came out of that sound -

00:01:48.697 --> 00:01:54.217
is A, U and M -Aum.

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:59.037
The Adi Shakti is the One

00:01:59.237 --> 00:02:06.517
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:14.217
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

00:02:14.417 --> 00:02:20.977
and for His own expression,

00:02:21.177 --> 00:02:24.497
for His own manifestation,

00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:28.817
for His own reflection.

00:02:29.937 --> 00:02:34.717
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:39.817
so He must have thought of creating a partner

00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:45.487
who will manifest His desires.

00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:55.497
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

00:02:55.697 --> 00:03:02.007
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

00:03:02.207 --> 00:03:07.487
His desire to create.

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:12.227
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

00:03:12.427 --> 00:03:16.867
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:20.897
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

00:03:21.097 --> 00:03:27.087
The attention has its own joy

00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:31.897
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

00:03:32.097 --> 00:03:35.257
She created all the universes,

00:03:35.457 --> 00:03:40.167
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:45.857
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:49.617
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:56.207
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

00:03:57.617 --> 00:04:00.337
At this juncture one may ask that,

00:04:00.547 --> 00:04:05.707
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

00:04:06.257 --> 00:04:09.117
That was the idea of God Almighty,

00:04:09.317 --> 00:04:16.027
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

00:04:16.227 --> 00:04:22.507
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

00:04:22.777 --> 00:04:25.517
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

00:04:25.717 --> 00:04:29.677
She had Her own way of expression,

00:04:29.877 --> 00:04:33.607
that She thought She must create the mirrors

00:04:33.807 --> 00:04:39.247
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

00:04:39.447 --> 00:04:41.097
to see His character

00:04:41.307 --> 00:04:47.067
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

00:04:49.337 --> 00:04:53.667
This evolution had to work out this way

00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:59.497
because they had to know from where they come.

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:05.927
We must know that we come from nature.

00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:11.827
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

00:05:12.037 --> 00:05:16.887
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:22.947
And She too is not just a dead earth,

00:05:23.147 --> 00:05:27.687
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

00:05:27.897 --> 00:05:33.507
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

00:05:33.707 --> 00:05:40.697
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

00:05:40.897 --> 00:05:46.637
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

00:05:46.837 --> 00:05:51.477
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

00:05:51.677 --> 00:05:55.877
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

00:05:56.077 --> 00:06:00.017
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

00:06:00.217 --> 00:06:02.597
See the whole plan that was made.

00:06:02.797 --> 00:06:08.227
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

00:06:08.437 --> 00:06:13.187
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

00:06:13.387 --> 00:06:16.377
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:18.897
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

00:06:19.097 --> 00:06:22.617
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

00:06:22.817 --> 00:06:28.707
This is the power that does all the living work,

00:06:28.907 --> 00:06:34.927
all the organization, all the creation.

00:06:39.487 --> 00:06:44.757
In our human ego we start thinking that

00:06:44.957 --> 00:06:48.807
we do something, we can create.

00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:55.307
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

00:06:55.507 --> 00:06:57.887
leave alone anything else.

00:06:58.087 --> 00:07:03.157
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:08.857
we can put together and create something,

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:18.437
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:23.517
any power.

00:07:23.717 --> 00:07:26.757
We cannot create anything.

00:07:26.957 --> 00:07:34.727
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

00:07:34.927 --> 00:07:40.337
For example, something is made of gold.

00:07:40.537 --> 00:07:43.667
Still it is gold.

00:07:43.867 --> 00:07:47.007
Now something is made of wood,

00:07:47.207 --> 00:07:51.607
whatever it is made, is wood.

00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:55.377
The principle is the same into everything.

00:07:55.577 --> 00:08:00.297
So whatever may be your birth,

00:08:00.497 --> 00:08:03.377
whatever may be the country you are born,

00:08:03.577 --> 00:08:10.117
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

00:08:10.317 --> 00:08:13.937
basically you all are the same.

00:08:14.137 --> 00:08:19.577
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:23.987
also, you cry the same way.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.857
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

00:08:28.057 --> 00:08:32.717
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:38.847
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

00:08:39.047 --> 00:08:43.707
by some common principle of life.

00:08:43.907 --> 00:08:49.317
And the common principle of life that has bound us

00:08:49.527 --> 00:08:56.367
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:59.277
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

00:08:59.477 --> 00:09:01.727
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

00:09:01.927 --> 00:09:06.067
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:15.347
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

00:09:15.547 --> 00:09:18.827
But in the human form only

00:09:19.027 --> 00:09:25.967
it has evolved as a connection,

00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:31.557
as one that is the divine force within us,

00:09:31.757 --> 00:09:37.057
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

00:09:37.257 --> 00:09:43.207
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

00:09:43.407 --> 00:09:46.767
This is the common principle we all have.

00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:54.267
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:59.447
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

00:09:59.657 --> 00:10:06.577
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

00:10:07.157 --> 00:10:09.727
Then there are people, as you people are,

00:10:09.927 --> 00:10:14.737
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:17.907
who have got your realization.

00:10:18.107 --> 00:10:22.327
So when you understand that this is the

00:10:22.527 --> 00:10:29.467
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:33.247
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

00:10:33.447 --> 00:10:35.137
and the enjoyment.

00:10:35.337 --> 00:10:45.077
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

00:10:45.287 --> 00:10:48.837
what should happen to you?

00:10:49.037 --> 00:10:53.487
What should we feel?

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:59.777
How do we then exist?

00:11:00.497 --> 00:11:05.787
This is the question many a times you have asked.

00:11:06.147 --> 00:11:09.647
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

00:11:09.847 --> 00:11:11.277
that you are not there,

00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:15.407
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:17.577
Secondly, what happens to you

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:22.497
is that you become just the existence.

00:11:22.697 --> 00:11:25.457
Just the existence.

00:11:25.657 --> 00:11:28.207
And that existence that you become,

00:11:28.407 --> 00:11:33.767
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:39.387
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

00:11:39.587 --> 00:11:41.427
also much before.

00:11:41.627 --> 00:11:44.137
In every religion we have had people

00:11:44.337 --> 00:11:48.807
who had this divine character very well developed.

00:11:49.007 --> 00:11:54.157
For example, even you can say,

00:11:54.357 --> 00:12:01.327
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

00:12:01.527 --> 00:12:08.397
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:11.067
and a khumba also,

00:12:11.267 --> 00:12:14.147
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

00:12:14.347 --> 00:12:20.947
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

00:12:21.147 --> 00:12:25.757
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

00:12:25.957 --> 00:12:30.897
You know that there is this power within us.

00:12:31.107 --> 00:12:36.467
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

00:12:36.677 --> 00:12:42.107
from the middle path of our ascent.

00:12:42.307 --> 00:12:44.937
Here also the same Kundalini,

00:12:45.137 --> 00:12:50.343
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

00:12:50.757 --> 00:12:57.217
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

00:12:57.417 --> 00:13:02.227
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

00:13:02.427 --> 00:13:06.717
So now when we are enlightened people,

00:13:06.927 --> 00:13:12.097
we have become saints and we are above all others,

00:13:12.297 --> 00:13:19.367
what should we do is to understand fully well -

00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:22.677
not only mentally, but from your heart -

00:13:22.877 --> 00:13:28.987
that now you have got these divine vibrations

00:13:29.187 --> 00:13:34.277
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

00:13:34.477 --> 00:13:39.717
what are you, where is the problem.

00:13:39.917 --> 00:13:42.837
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

00:13:43.037 --> 00:13:47.567
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

00:13:47.767 --> 00:13:51.137
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

00:13:51.337 --> 00:13:54.717
with spiritual vibrations."

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:57.327
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

00:13:57.527 --> 00:13:59.487
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

00:13:59.687 --> 00:14:03.877
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

00:14:04.077 --> 00:14:08.117
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

00:14:08.317 --> 00:14:10.227
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

00:14:10.427 --> 00:14:12.317
from here only there are vibrations,

00:14:12.517 --> 00:14:14.887
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:17.457
So then he sat down and started wondering,

00:14:17.657 --> 00:14:22.707
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

00:14:22.907 --> 00:14:28.617
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

00:14:28.817 --> 00:14:32.647
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

00:14:32.857 --> 00:14:36.757
and that's how he found the place.

00:14:37.157 --> 00:14:39.427
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

00:14:39.627 --> 00:14:42.537
is not done haphazard, in any way.

00:14:42.737 --> 00:14:45.907
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

00:14:46.107 --> 00:14:52.237
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

00:14:52.817 --> 00:14:58.257
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

00:14:58.677 --> 00:15:01.007
We are the ones which spoil the nature

00:15:01.207 --> 00:15:05.507
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

00:15:05.707 --> 00:15:07.807
and we have to respect it.

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:10.097
I've already told you many a times

00:15:10.297 --> 00:15:13.187
about how human beings were formed

00:15:13.387 --> 00:15:20.337
by different chemicals who came also,

00:15:20.537 --> 00:15:23.597
carbon came from the mother earth.

00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:27.037
All this leads us to understand

00:15:27.237 --> 00:15:31.887
that we have a very big responsibility.

00:15:32.447 --> 00:15:38.437
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

00:15:38.637 --> 00:15:41.347
And now you all have reached a state

00:15:41.547 --> 00:15:45.487
where you have become yourself.

00:15:45.687 --> 00:15:47.837
You know yourself.

00:15:48.037 --> 00:15:52.087
This is a very big, I think should say,

00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:59.597
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:08.717
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

00:16:38.187 --> 00:16:43.597
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

00:16:43.797 --> 00:16:50.917
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

00:16:51.117 --> 00:17:00.797
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

00:17:02.237 --> 00:17:07.287
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

00:17:07.487 --> 00:17:11.217
and these centers have to be awakened

00:17:11.417 --> 00:17:14.917
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:17:15.117 --> 00:17:22.897
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

00:17:23.757 --> 00:17:32.687
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

00:17:32.887 --> 00:17:37.617
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

00:17:37.817 --> 00:17:43.747
from the path of your perfection.

00:17:44.847 --> 00:17:48.287
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

00:17:48.487 --> 00:17:52.997
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

00:17:53.207 --> 00:17:57.117
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

00:17:57.317 --> 00:18:01.937
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

00:18:02.137 --> 00:18:06.897
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

00:18:07.207 --> 00:18:10.987
There are so many ways of people relating

00:18:11.187 --> 00:18:14.847
to the power of the Divine.

00:18:15.057 --> 00:18:19.337
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

00:18:19.537 --> 00:18:25.007
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

00:18:25.207 --> 00:18:28.387
and through Her the whole universe was created.

00:18:28.587 --> 00:18:36.327
But also true that as you are seeking,

00:18:36.537 --> 00:18:39.777
also the Divine is seeking you.

00:18:39.977 --> 00:18:48.327
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:56.087
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

00:18:56.287 --> 00:19:02.047
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

00:19:02.247 --> 00:19:06.217
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

00:19:06.417 --> 00:19:09.387
It is the One which has given you

00:19:09.587 --> 00:19:12.567
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

00:19:12.767 --> 00:19:17.117
"Whatever we have is given by You".

00:19:17.437 --> 00:19:21.827
If that is the case that all that you have

00:19:22.027 --> 00:19:26.477
is given by your Kundalini,

00:19:26.687 --> 00:19:30.377
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

00:19:30.577 --> 00:19:35.337
then is very important to understand what is the need

00:19:35.587 --> 00:19:43.207
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

00:19:44.657 --> 00:19:52.177
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

00:19:53.607 --> 00:19:56.787
As I said, there's a relationship

00:19:56.987 --> 00:20:03.517
between the realized souls and the Divine.

00:20:03.717 --> 00:20:07.577
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

00:20:07.787 --> 00:20:13.447
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

00:20:13.647 --> 00:20:17.087
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

00:20:17.287 --> 00:20:20.137
It's such a relationship.

00:20:20.337 --> 00:20:23.467
And it's so close, it's so close,

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:28.927
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

00:20:29.127 --> 00:20:36.027
or the moon has its own moonlight.

00:20:36.227 --> 00:20:47.457
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

00:20:47.657 --> 00:20:52.877
and that should give you full control over yourself

00:20:53.077 --> 00:20:58.417
and over your development.

00:20:58.917 --> 00:21:06.467
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

00:21:07.327 --> 00:21:11.087
Now

00:21:16.682 --> 00:21:21.817
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

00:21:22.037 --> 00:21:24.747
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

00:21:24.947 --> 00:21:26.347
you may.

00:21:26.557 --> 00:21:28.487
But as soon as that person will disappear,

00:21:28.687 --> 00:21:31.787
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

00:21:31.987 --> 00:21:35.257
That surrender has no meaning.

00:21:35.457 --> 00:21:41.687
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

00:21:41.887 --> 00:21:45.817
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

00:21:46.027 --> 00:21:49.607
because it has a reaction.

00:21:49.807 --> 00:21:57.827
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

00:21:58.057 --> 00:22:13.927
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

00:22:14.127 --> 00:22:19.827
into the water automatically,

00:22:20.027 --> 00:22:27.767
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

00:22:28.367 --> 00:22:32.807
If you can just feel that within yourself,

00:22:33.007 --> 00:22:36.197
that you are one with the Divine.

00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:41.487
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

00:22:41.987 --> 00:22:51.857
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

00:22:52.067 --> 00:22:58.457
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

00:22:58.657 --> 00:23:05.637
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

00:23:06.267 --> 00:23:11.617
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

00:23:11.817 --> 00:23:15.657
There's a great joy in forgiving,

00:23:15.857 --> 00:23:20.377
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

00:23:20.577 --> 00:23:26.877
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

00:23:27.447 --> 00:23:30.987
Nobody can disturb you.

00:23:31.187 --> 00:23:35.637
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

00:23:35.837 --> 00:23:38.077
that is what is forgiveness.

00:23:38.277 --> 00:23:42.797
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

00:23:42.997 --> 00:23:45.737
or to do something against somebody.

00:23:45.937 --> 00:23:49.927
The Divine takes over from you

00:23:50.127 --> 00:23:53.027
and does whatever is needed,

00:23:53.227 --> 00:23:59.897
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

00:24:00.297 --> 00:24:05.457
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

00:24:05.657 --> 00:24:07.897
say in Islam called ruh;

00:24:08.097 --> 00:24:12.877
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

00:24:13.077 --> 00:24:17.257
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

00:24:17.457 --> 00:24:23.217
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:28.017
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:31.777
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

00:24:31.977 --> 00:24:37.537
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:42.697
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

00:24:42.907 --> 00:24:45.237
how to make others feel it.

00:24:45.437 --> 00:24:48.927
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

00:24:49.127 --> 00:24:51.177
or something nonsensical.

00:24:51.377 --> 00:24:55.157
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

00:24:55.357 --> 00:25:01.277
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

00:25:01.477 --> 00:25:07.317
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

00:25:07.517 --> 00:25:11.597
that you know there is this Power.

00:25:11.797 --> 00:25:14.147
You're sure about this Power

00:25:14.347 --> 00:25:18.527
because you can feel it within yourself.

00:25:18.727 --> 00:25:21.667
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

00:25:21.877 --> 00:25:28.047
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

00:25:28.247 --> 00:25:33.857
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

00:25:34.057 --> 00:25:43.387
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

00:25:43.597 --> 00:25:46.827
She tells you the truth.

00:25:48.877 --> 00:25:53.867
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

00:25:54.067 --> 00:25:58.707
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

00:25:58.907 --> 00:26:02.667
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

00:26:02.877 --> 00:26:08.097
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

00:26:08.297 --> 00:26:10.647
This kind of argument is possible.

00:26:10.847 --> 00:26:13.567
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

00:26:13.767 --> 00:26:16.437
that you forgive that person,

00:26:16.637 --> 00:26:21.227
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

00:26:21.427 --> 00:26:24.247
you don't do anything.

00:26:24.447 --> 00:26:25.927
That's the truth.

00:26:26.137 --> 00:26:30.677
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

00:26:30.877 --> 00:26:34.337
compassion becomes the truth.

00:26:34.537 --> 00:26:38.217
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

00:26:38.417 --> 00:26:41.557
So all the absolute truth that you know is

00:26:41.757 --> 00:26:46.397
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

00:26:46.597 --> 00:26:51.307
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

00:26:51.507 --> 00:26:54.677
and we felt this way and still it happened."

00:26:54.887 --> 00:26:57.817
It makes no difference.

00:26:58.017 --> 00:27:00.877
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

00:27:01.077 --> 00:27:05.117
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

00:27:05.317 --> 00:27:09.547
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

00:27:09.747 --> 00:27:14.367
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

00:27:14.567 --> 00:27:17.967
Because it had to be the other way round.

00:27:18.167 --> 00:27:21.577
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

00:27:21.787 --> 00:27:26.607
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

00:27:26.807 --> 00:27:29.507
So, it's a play going on.

00:27:29.707 --> 00:27:35.967
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

00:27:36.177 --> 00:27:44.917
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

00:27:45.117 --> 00:27:50.427
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:55.097
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

00:27:55.297 --> 00:27:59.207
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

00:27:59.407 --> 00:28:06.937
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

00:28:07.217 --> 00:28:15.777
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

00:28:16.257 --> 00:28:18.907
When you have the enlightened faith,

00:28:19.107 --> 00:28:25.637
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

00:28:25.837 --> 00:28:31.677
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

00:28:32.167 --> 00:28:36.997
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

00:28:37.197 --> 00:28:42.877
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

00:28:43.267 --> 00:28:46.657
Not necessarily. It's a play.

00:28:46.857 --> 00:28:54.747
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

00:28:54.947 --> 00:28:58.287
So if you can become the witness,

00:28:58.487 --> 00:29:02.057
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

00:29:02.257 --> 00:29:09.667
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

00:29:10.137 --> 00:29:15.857
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

00:29:16.057 --> 00:29:18.917
That dissolution has to take place.

00:29:19.117 --> 00:29:22.837
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

00:29:23.037 --> 00:29:28.577
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

00:29:28.777 --> 00:29:32.877
this work could not have been done.

00:29:33.087 --> 00:29:38.137
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

00:29:38.337 --> 00:29:50.237
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

00:29:50.447 --> 00:29:54.307
all the aspects of this human life.

00:29:54.507 --> 00:29:58.077
It had to be such an Incarnation

00:29:58.277 --> 00:30:06.267
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:10.787
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

00:30:10.987 --> 00:30:18.617
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

00:30:18.817 --> 00:30:21.847
as a whole, as a human being.

00:30:22.047 --> 00:30:26.377
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

00:30:26.577 --> 00:30:29.897
all of them are just the same.

00:30:30.107 --> 00:30:39.267
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

00:30:39.467 --> 00:30:43.347
some are not seeking genuinely,

00:30:43.547 --> 00:30:46.997
and some are not seeking at all.

00:30:47.197 --> 00:30:52.087
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

00:30:52.297 --> 00:30:58.137
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

00:30:58.337 --> 00:31:02.907
one fish came out of the mother.

00:31:03.107 --> 00:31:10.077
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

00:31:10.277 --> 00:31:15.597
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

00:31:15.797 --> 00:31:20.827
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

00:31:21.227 --> 00:31:27.937
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

00:31:28.437 --> 00:31:32.807
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

00:31:33.007 --> 00:31:36.817
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

00:31:37.017 --> 00:31:39.627
James or what St. John has said,

00:31:39.827 --> 00:31:42.677
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:44.427
It doesn't matter.

00:31:44.627 --> 00:31:52.297
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

00:31:52.507 --> 00:31:56.477
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

00:31:56.677 --> 00:32:01.487
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

00:32:01.687 --> 00:32:06.907
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

00:32:07.107 --> 00:32:11.107
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

00:32:11.307 --> 00:32:14.087
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

00:32:14.287 --> 00:32:18.347
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

00:32:18.547 --> 00:32:22.507
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:24.687
should not disturb you much

00:32:24.887 --> 00:32:29.437
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

00:32:29.637 --> 00:32:33.487
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

00:32:33.687 --> 00:32:38.027
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

00:32:38.227 --> 00:32:44.077
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

00:32:44.277 --> 00:32:48.267
all the useless things that we have,

00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:51.837
like our conditioning and our ego.

00:32:52.047 --> 00:32:55.067
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:55.267 --> 00:32:58.987
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

00:32:59.187 --> 00:33:03.057
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

00:33:03.257 --> 00:33:07.497
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

00:33:07.697 --> 00:33:09.437
That's human nature also.

00:33:09.637 --> 00:33:13.277
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

00:33:13.477 --> 00:33:17.007
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

00:33:17.207 --> 00:33:20.787
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

00:33:20.987 --> 00:33:25.447
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

00:33:25.647 --> 00:33:27.587
It will all work out.

00:33:27.787 --> 00:33:32.007
It will all work out, but your attention should be

00:33:32.207 --> 00:33:39.377
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

00:33:39.577 --> 00:33:42.197
of this compassion?".

00:33:42.397 --> 00:33:47.727
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

00:33:47.927 --> 00:33:51.457
which is going to give you strength.

00:33:51.657 --> 00:33:54.687
This compassion within you,

00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:58.467
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

00:33:58.667 --> 00:34:01.947
completely destroyed,

00:34:02.147 --> 00:34:05.947
your compassion itself will make you powerful

00:34:06.147 --> 00:34:10.407
and you'll do everything that is needed.

00:34:10.607 --> 00:34:14.937
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

00:34:15.137 --> 00:34:23.307
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

00:34:23.577 --> 00:34:26.217
And amazingly as you will do this,

00:34:26.417 --> 00:34:31.207
your own level of spirituality will rise.

00:34:33.087 --> 00:34:36.037
As you see, I would say,

00:34:36.237 --> 00:34:41.537
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

00:34:41.737 --> 00:34:44.087
the water rises.

00:34:44.287 --> 00:34:50.357
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:50.557 --> 00:34:54.337
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

00:34:54.537 --> 00:34:58.947
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

00:34:59.147 --> 00:35:01.497
there will be much more manifestation

00:35:01.697 --> 00:35:07.937
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

00:35:08.297 --> 00:35:14.817
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

00:35:15.017 --> 00:35:17.527
you all have got your Realization

00:35:17.727 --> 00:35:22.127
and that you are all now saintly people,

00:35:22.327 --> 00:35:25.727
then we should see to people who were like you.

00:35:25.927 --> 00:35:29.917
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

00:35:30.117 --> 00:35:33.957
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

00:35:34.157 --> 00:35:39.547
What did they do? They went all out

00:35:39.747 --> 00:35:43.917
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

00:35:44.117 --> 00:35:46.197
They could not give realization as such,

00:35:46.397 --> 00:35:48.907
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

00:35:49.107 --> 00:35:53.507
they talked about it, they sang about it.

00:35:53.707 --> 00:35:56.887
That's what we have to understand

00:35:57.117 --> 00:36:06.237
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

00:36:06.437 --> 00:36:08.727
When you know the people are getting drowned,

00:36:08.927 --> 00:36:14.197
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

00:36:14.397 --> 00:36:20.157
I should say,

00:36:20.357 --> 00:36:26.017
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

00:36:26.227 --> 00:36:29.267
And if you have that compassion within you,

00:36:29.477 --> 00:36:34.517
you will go all out to save them.

00:36:34.717 --> 00:36:40.677
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

00:36:40.877 --> 00:36:45.747
of this enjoyment of your attention.

00:36:45.947 --> 00:36:49.257
Your attention itself will enjoy

00:36:49.457 --> 00:36:58.597
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

00:36:58.797 --> 00:37:01.827
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

00:37:02.027 --> 00:37:05.347
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

00:37:05.547 --> 00:37:11.197
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

00:37:11.397 --> 00:37:17.707
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

00:37:17.907 --> 00:37:20.387
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

00:37:20.587 --> 00:37:25.157
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

00:37:25.357 --> 00:37:31.647
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

00:37:31.847 --> 00:37:36.947
The more you use this power the better it will be.

00:37:37.147 --> 00:37:42.067
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

00:37:42.267 --> 00:37:46.257
For we haven't got many people from the black race

00:37:46.457 --> 00:37:48.387
I think, from Africa.

00:37:48.587 --> 00:37:52.917
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

00:37:53.117 --> 00:37:56.317
Also, we have so many other areas

00:37:56.517 --> 00:37:59.747
where I find we have to work it out,

00:37:59.947 --> 00:38:06.607
that if this compassion is within you

00:38:06.807 --> 00:38:09.147
then it will compel you, also,

00:38:09.347 --> 00:38:13.057
to do work that will bring solace to people

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:15.977
who are not even seeking.

00:38:16.177 --> 00:38:21.317
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

00:38:21.517 --> 00:38:26.747
which will really create very beautiful institutions

00:38:26.947 --> 00:38:31.617
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

00:38:31.817 --> 00:38:35.857
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

00:38:36.057 --> 00:38:40.697
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:38:40.897 --> 00:38:46.147
you have dropped out your greed,

00:38:46.347 --> 00:38:52.357
you have dropped out your lust.

00:38:52.557 --> 00:38:57.527
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

00:38:57.737 --> 00:39:01.437
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

00:39:01.637 --> 00:39:05.077
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

00:39:05.277 --> 00:39:07.167
and then they start becoming leaders,

00:39:07.367 --> 00:39:13.067
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:16.127
This you will not do.

00:39:16.327 --> 00:39:23.357
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

00:39:23.557 --> 00:39:29.787
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

00:39:29.987 --> 00:39:36.227
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

00:39:36.427 --> 00:39:40.497
Once we start spreading out like that,

00:39:40.697 --> 00:39:43.567
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

00:39:43.777 --> 00:39:46.797
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

00:39:46.997 --> 00:39:53.627
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

00:39:53.827 --> 00:39:57.457
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

00:39:57.657 --> 00:39:59.557
who don't have greed.

00:39:59.757 --> 00:40:02.697
I have known people who never had any greed,

00:40:02.897 --> 00:40:08.577
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

00:40:08.777 --> 00:40:12.087
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

00:40:12.317 --> 00:40:15.887
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

00:40:16.087 --> 00:40:19.517
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:22.147
But not Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:22.347 --> 00:40:24.577
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

00:40:24.777 --> 00:40:30.647
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

00:40:30.847 --> 00:40:33.997
Not their lust, not their greed

00:40:34.197 --> 00:40:37.917
and also the so-called deviations

00:40:38.117 --> 00:40:44.737
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

00:40:45.017 --> 00:40:47.667
Because they know what do they enjoy,

00:40:47.867 --> 00:40:50.257
where lies their enjoyment.

00:40:50.457 --> 00:40:52.857
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

00:40:53.057 --> 00:40:56.667
you will try to have more of it

00:40:56.867 --> 00:41:01.677
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

00:41:01.877 --> 00:41:04.787
I would say as the men are working it out,

00:41:04.987 --> 00:41:06.727
women should work it out

00:41:06.927 --> 00:41:12.287
because women have more sense of compassion,

00:41:12.487 --> 00:41:16.837
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

00:41:17.037 --> 00:41:20.037
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

00:41:20.237 --> 00:41:23.127
I'm saying about normal.

00:41:23.327 --> 00:41:28.587
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

00:41:28.787 --> 00:41:33.287
they have known what is love for the children is.

00:41:33.487 --> 00:41:35.247
Mother doesn't expect anything.

00:41:35.447 --> 00:41:39.127
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

00:41:39.327 --> 00:41:42.327
She enjoys her child, that's all.

00:41:42.527 --> 00:41:49.347
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

00:41:49.557 --> 00:41:51.507
See, I have seen young girls.

00:41:51.707 --> 00:41:55.107
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

00:41:55.317 --> 00:41:58.747
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

00:41:58.947 --> 00:42:03.567
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

00:42:03.777 --> 00:42:09.907
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

00:42:10.107 --> 00:42:14.247
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

00:42:14.457 --> 00:42:18.747
And as you are all married also,

00:42:18.947 --> 00:42:23.957
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

00:42:24.157 --> 00:42:30.887
by your own nature of Divinity.

00:42:31.087 --> 00:42:33.207
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:37.297
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

00:42:37.497 --> 00:42:41.337
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

00:42:41.537 --> 00:42:44.987
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:48.737
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

00:42:48.937 --> 00:42:51.967
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

00:42:52.167 --> 00:42:59.847
And if something

00:43:00.047 --> 00:43:02.347
has to be done, has to be done.

00:43:02.547 --> 00:43:04.727
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

00:43:04.927 --> 00:43:08.477
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

00:43:08.677 --> 00:43:11.857
and the household and this and that".

00:43:12.057 --> 00:43:15.657
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

00:43:15.657 --> 00:43:18.387
The whole day, what will you do?

00:43:18.587 --> 00:43:22.137
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

00:43:22.337 --> 00:43:26.187
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

00:43:26.387 --> 00:43:30.607
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

00:43:30.807 --> 00:43:35.757
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

00:43:35.957 --> 00:43:41.607
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

00:43:41.807 --> 00:43:49.977
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

00:43:50.177 --> 00:43:54.117
then you'll be never tired.

00:43:54.317 --> 00:43:57.157
You will never grudge.

00:43:57.357 --> 00:44:02.617
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

00:44:03.067 --> 00:44:06.857
This is a very important point that we should realize

00:44:07.057 --> 00:44:10.357
that if somebody is a woman or a man

00:44:10.557 --> 00:44:16.467
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

00:44:16.667 --> 00:44:21.507
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

00:44:21.707 --> 00:44:26.077
She has more power of compassion.

00:44:26.277 --> 00:44:29.597
In the same way the man has more power of action.

00:44:29.807 --> 00:44:32.797
So, the compassion has to become active.

00:44:32.997 --> 00:44:36.057
In this combination everything will work out

00:44:36.267 --> 00:44:38.537
in a very beautiful manner.

00:44:38.737 --> 00:44:43.517
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

00:44:43.717 --> 00:44:48.487
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

00:44:48.687 --> 00:44:51.747
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

00:44:51.947 --> 00:44:53.927
some of the women have been men

00:44:54.127 --> 00:44:58.777
and some of the men have been women.

00:44:58.977 --> 00:45:03.347
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

00:45:03.557 --> 00:45:09.277
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

00:45:09.477 --> 00:45:10.897
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:11.097 --> 00:45:13.637
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

00:45:13.837 --> 00:45:16.537
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.537
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:18.747 --> 00:45:21.547
Now here you should understand the relationship

00:45:21.757 --> 00:45:26.057
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

00:45:26.257 --> 00:45:32.227
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

00:45:32.437 --> 00:45:34.727
God Almighty is the Spectator;

00:45:34.927 --> 00:45:39.687
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:45:39.887 --> 00:45:42.297
She is compassion, of course.

00:45:42.497 --> 00:45:46.277
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:49.897
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

00:45:50.097 --> 00:45:54.197
But He's the One who takes charge.

00:45:54.397 --> 00:45:59.437
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

00:45:59.637 --> 00:46:03.707
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

00:46:03.907 --> 00:46:08.807
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

00:46:09.017 --> 00:46:12.307
how it has worked out.

00:46:12.507 --> 00:46:16.557
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

00:46:16.757 --> 00:46:20.827
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

00:46:21.027 --> 00:46:25.517
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

00:46:25.717 --> 00:46:31.047
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:33.017
I can't understand

00:46:33.217 --> 00:46:37.057
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

00:46:37.267 --> 00:46:43.937
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

00:46:44.137 --> 00:46:47.937
who knows what is the truth,

00:46:48.137 --> 00:46:57.037
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

00:46:57.237 --> 00:47:06.227
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

00:47:07.917 --> 00:47:11.637
It is to realize

00:47:11.837 --> 00:47:20.087
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

00:47:20.387 --> 00:47:24.327
You have entered into His kingdom

00:47:24.527 --> 00:47:30.867
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

00:47:31.067 --> 00:47:34.337
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

00:47:34.537 --> 00:47:37.217
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

00:47:37.417 --> 00:47:41.097
he still begs sitting on this throne.

00:47:41.297 --> 00:47:45.097
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

00:47:45.297 --> 00:47:47.967
I receive some funny letters sometimes

00:47:48.167 --> 00:47:52.707
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

00:47:52.907 --> 00:47:58.177
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

00:47:58.377 --> 00:48:04.277
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

00:48:04.487 --> 00:48:06.847
because it has a very bad impression,

00:48:07.047 --> 00:48:12.297
also, for other people and for your own life.

00:48:12.497 --> 00:48:16.137
For your own life, is very important

00:48:16.337 --> 00:48:20.517
that you should grow fully into the understanding

00:48:20.717 --> 00:48:26.647
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

00:48:26.847 --> 00:48:30.917
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

00:48:31.117 --> 00:48:35.247
What do you have to surrender?

00:48:36.817 --> 00:48:39.687
Just think of it.

00:48:39.887 --> 00:48:47.217
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

00:48:47.417 --> 00:48:53.527
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

00:48:53.727 --> 00:49:00.307
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

00:49:00.507 --> 00:49:05.297
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

00:49:05.497 --> 00:49:10.287
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

00:49:10.487 --> 00:49:13.537
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

00:49:13.737 --> 00:49:15.277
Impossible.

00:49:15.477 --> 00:49:20.547
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

00:49:20.747 --> 00:49:23.317
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

00:49:23.517 --> 00:49:26.727
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

00:49:26.927 --> 00:49:33.447
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

00:49:33.647 --> 00:49:37.467
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

00:49:37.667 --> 00:49:44.007
have to enter into and work out.

00:49:44.207 --> 00:49:45.727
You can do it.

00:49:45.927 --> 00:49:51.187
You see, I was surprised that in this place

00:49:51.387 --> 00:49:56.577
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

00:49:56.777 --> 00:50:01.207
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

00:50:01.407 --> 00:50:04.447
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

00:50:04.647 --> 00:50:11.467
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

00:50:11.667 --> 00:50:17.247
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

00:50:17.447 --> 00:50:20.497
As it is growing in quantity,

00:50:20.697 --> 00:50:24.407
it should also grow in quality.

00:50:24.607 --> 00:50:29.467
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

00:50:29.667 --> 00:50:31.777
Because I know all the time

00:50:31.987 --> 00:50:34.827
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

00:50:35.027 --> 00:50:38.307
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:50:38.507 --> 00:50:42.657
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

00:50:42.857 --> 00:50:44.867
I know that feeling you have that,

00:50:45.067 --> 00:50:48.497
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

00:50:48.697 --> 00:50:50.567
So forget about them.

00:50:50.777 --> 00:50:57.497
But those who are seeking, approach them.

00:50:57.707 --> 00:50:59.857
They are your real relations.

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:03.967
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

00:51:04.167 --> 00:51:07.867
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

00:51:08.067 --> 00:51:11.107
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

00:51:11.307 --> 00:51:15.507
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

00:51:15.707 --> 00:51:19.447
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

00:51:19.647 --> 00:51:22.357
You should find out where are they.

00:51:22.557 --> 00:51:25.267
My attention is, of course, is with you

00:51:25.467 --> 00:51:30.247
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

00:51:30.457 --> 00:51:31.857
Whatever you want,

00:51:32.057 --> 00:51:36.547
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

00:51:36.747 --> 00:51:42.107
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

00:51:42.317 --> 00:51:45.327
Because you take it upon yourself.

00:51:45.527 --> 00:51:51.067
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

00:51:51.267 --> 00:51:58.427
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

00:51:58.637 --> 00:52:05.197
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

00:52:05.917 --> 00:52:09.147
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

00:52:09.347 --> 00:52:13.187
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

00:52:13.387 --> 00:52:17.377
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

00:52:17.587 --> 00:52:20.627
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

00:52:20.837 --> 00:52:23.027
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

00:52:23.227 --> 00:52:26.227
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

00:52:26.427 --> 00:52:27.917
is Adi Shakti.

00:52:28.117 --> 00:52:31.417
It's very important that this puja must be performed

00:52:31.617 --> 00:52:37.687
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

00:52:37.887 --> 00:52:40.847
and you grow more and more within yourself

00:52:41.047 --> 00:52:45.777
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

00:52:45.977 --> 00:52:50.777
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

00:52:50.977 --> 00:52:53.457
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

00:52:53.657 --> 00:52:57.487
within you is the Kundalini.

00:52:57.687 --> 00:52:58.937
So, you have to worship.

00:52:59.137 --> 00:53:03.297
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

00:53:03.497 --> 00:53:06.867
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

00:53:07.067 --> 00:53:10.567
May God bless you.
