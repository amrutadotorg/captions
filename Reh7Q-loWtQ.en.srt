1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:14,000
With today’s vibrations, you can see, when
you are prepared for a puja, how much you get.

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,890
Today you can feel it.

3
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:28,869
So the Divine is very anxious to act, only
thing you have to prepare yourself.

4
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:34,880
And all these preparations are going to help
you tremendously.

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:45,170
As we are now Sahaja Yogis we have to know
that we have become something different from

6
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,910
what we were.

7
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:53,070
We are Yogis, we are higher people than others.

8
00:00:53,070 --> 00:01:03,150
And as such we have to understand one thing
that we are not like other human beings who

9
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,450
say something and do something, who can live
with hypocrisy.

10
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:16,710
That’s why all the problems have arisen
out of all the religions.

11
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,789
A person who says he’s a Christian he’s
absolutely anti-Christ; who says who is Islamic,

12
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:34,329
he’s absolutely anti-Mohammed; who says
who is a Hindu is absolutely anti Shri Krishna.

13
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:43,130
This is the main reason why all the religions
have failed so far because human beings talk

14
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:48,270
big of ideals.

15
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,749
They all say that we have this ideal, that
ideal, but they are not those ideals, they

16
00:01:53,749 --> 00:01:54,749
cannot live with those ideals.

17
00:01:54,749 --> 00:02:01,420
The ideals are not in their lives, they’re
outside.

18
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:09,270
But they go about saying that these are our
ideals, they become fanatics but they are

19
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,830
not the ideals.

20
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:20,920
By Sahaja Yoga now you have the method, you
have the possibility, that you can become

21
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,980
the ideals.

22
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:30,840
The ideal has to first to be understood through
your brains, in the West specially.

23
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,910
What are the ideals we have become or we have
to become, what we can achieve, this idea

24
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,540
you must have.

25
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:54,320
And secondly you must have a capacity to deepen
your

26
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,450
meditative power so that these ideals go and
settle in your heart as a part and parcel

27
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,030
of your being, that you can’t live without
these ideals.

28
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,111
We can take an example say of Christ.

29
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:17,700
For Christ He and His ideals were the same,
there’s no difference between them.

30
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,450
He did not talk of one thing, did another
thing and executed the third.

31
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:29,790
This will be the difference between the Sahaja
Yogis and non Sahaja Yogis, that whatever

32
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,960
are your ideals have to be expressed in your
life every moment because you are that.

33
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:43,000
If you are gold, then gold is gold all the
time.

34
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,760
It is not gold sometimes, then sometimes iron
and sometimes mud, it is gold all the time.

35
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Only human beings are like that, that sometimes
they can be snakes, lions and could be foxes

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,010
also.

37
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:11,870
But as Sahaja Yogis you become pure human
beings and this is what we have to know.

38
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,810
It is not difficult to strive for it, it’s
not difficult, because now you have the power

39
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,510
to deepen your roots to your heart.

40
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:32,260
So the brain must be used to understand clearly
what are the ideals of a Sahaja Yogi.

41
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:40,510
What are the things that a Sahaja Yogi should
do, how he should behave in life, what methods

42
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:46,750
he should follow.

43
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:57,699
And then he has to bring it to his heart through
meditative processes, through surrendering.

44
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,070
How I give you second birth you know very
well.

45
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,910
I conceive you in My heart, otherwise I cannot
do it.

46
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:13,460
Because My heart is so pure, it cleanses you;
by compassion My love cleanses you and then

47
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:25,180
I can take you out of My Sahastrara, otherwise
how will I do that?

48
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:33,600
And when that is happened you have become
a new personality.

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,400
So you are very different from all others
because a Spirit has given birth to your Spirit.

50
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,730
You have been cleansed by the Spirit.

51
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:56,160
So you cannot live like that, like all other
human beings are living.

52
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:04,730
All the clashes, all the problems of human
beings are because they are not what they

53
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:16,110
talk, ideals are out, out of their life.

54
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:22,230
That is how a Sahaja Yogi will show himself
off compared to anybody else.

55
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:27,370
Take an example say of Abraham Lincoln, all
right?

56
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:33,300
Abraham Lincoln believed that everybody must
have freedom and the government should be

57
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,380
for the public, for the people.

58
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,910
Whatever He talked He practised it.

59
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:50,300
Whatever He believed in He worked it out and
gave His life for it, that’s why He’s

60
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,740
a great man.

61
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,520
Think of Mahatma Gandhi, they were not like
Christ – incarnations.

62
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:04,860
Think of any great man, think of Shivaji Maharaj,
any one of the saints – they were human

63
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,860
beings.

64
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,570
But once they knew this is the principle on
which we have to live, they become one with

65
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,020
the principles, they do not compromise.

66
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:27,150
So what Sahaja Yogi has to be that we should
understand.

67
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:35,350
A Sahaja Yogi is a person who has got Realization
through the Kundalini, and Kundalini is the

68
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:43,470
motherhood in you, is the caring, nourishing
power within you.

69
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,160
But mother will never compromise with the
son; if he wants to kill somebody she’ll

70
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,160
say: “No.

71
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,560
” I mean a real mother.

72
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,970
She will even shoot that son who tries to
do wrong things.

73
00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:06,689
In the same way if you become the mother of
yourself, then you have to look after yourself,

74
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:13,910
in the same manner that you nourish yourself
and all others also, you have to nourish them,

75
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:21,120
care for them, and do not compromise with
wrong doings, unrighteousness things, absurd

76
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
things.

77
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:31,580
Now when I tell you this it is not necessary
for you to feel guilty.

78
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,099
We have to look upward.

79
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:48,200
Those who are standing even on a lower staircase,
if they are looking upward they are all right,

80
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:58,890
but those who are standing at a higher steps,
and looking downward, will go down.

81
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,399
So look forward.

82
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:09,470
What we have to do in our day-to-day life
in simple relationships even husband, wife,

83
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,890
children, parents – are you becoming silent
within yourself?

84
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:22,580
Are you nourishing it, with your silence,
with your compassion, or you are supporting

85
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:28,620
something that is absolutely anti-God?

86
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:35,700
If you become the ideals, the power of ideals
itself, will make you so dynamic that you

87
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:42,420
don’t need to consult anybody, you become
the ideal.

88
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,350
They are like torches.

89
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,920
Your ideals itself will be enlightened.

90
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,190
So the first attitude should be: “How do
we deepen ourselves?”

91
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:59,170
That should be first attitude.

92
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:06,580
Now say a husband, wife are quarrelling morning
till evening they cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

93
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,150
Absurdities.

94
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:14,270
If they are quarrelling they are not Sahaja
Yogis, take it for granted.

95
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,990
Now what you have to do if two persons are
quarrelling, the one who is a Sahaja Yogi

96
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:23,180
will leave that wife: “I have nothing to
do with wife, I have no wife nothing.

97
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,730
” Keep out, detach completely from within.

98
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,550
Just don’t talk to that wife.

99
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,490
Don’t discuss, don’t bother about it,
just detach.

100
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:47,589
If the son is like that just detach, up to
a point but no quarrelling, no argument nothing.

101
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:55,850
Complete silence, a silent protest, must be
developed.

102
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,730
But in that silence you should not be a cowardly
person.

103
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:06,810
So many people are cowards, and that cowardliness,
they think is their silent process.

104
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:21,970
A person who is really powerful will not deter,
will not be aggressive but will not also take

105
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,560
aggression.

106
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,680
So in your meditations you have to sit down.

107
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,589
Now what do you say in meditation?

108
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:37,280
Try to see all the chakras.

109
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,890
What chakras are catching, face it yourself.

110
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,580
These might be from your past life.

111
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,470
Some chakras are weak.

112
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,320
Try to make them all right, try to strengthen
them.

113
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,200
Because ideals have to be worked out the instrument
has to be all right.

114
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:11,310
If the instrument is a crazy one how will
you do?

115
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:17,060
So first of all you must develop your instrument
properly, it should be balanced, powerful,

116
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,450
not cowardly.

117
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:24,190
People should feel your power.

118
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:31,720
Of course the power is of love, but love doesn’t
mean that you compromise with all the nonsensical

119
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
things.

120
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,029
There should be no compromise at all.

121
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:47,130
It’s a very self-certifying state.

122
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:53,470
We cannot say when it is so, we just cannot
say.

123
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,480
Itself the state will certify that I’m all
right now, I have reached that state.

124
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:08,680
We cannot say after five hours, three minutes,
two seconds you’ll become that.

125
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:17,930
You just mature and you see that maturity
within you.

126
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:24,100
Once you understand that unless and until
you become your ideals you are not a Sahaja

127
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,300
Yogi.

128
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,899
Everybody can call themselves Sahaja Yogis,
there’s not inauguration, we don’t have

129
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:42,050
any sort of a – inauguration of a university
where people can come and get their degrees

130
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,960
and diplomas: “All right you are certified
twice born.

131
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:52,800
” There are some who are several times twice
born.

132
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,120
They are twice born today, tomorrow they are
not, then again they come twice born and again

133
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,120
twice born.

134
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,220
Some of them can be one hundred and eight
times twice born in Sahaja Yoga.

135
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,250
And even then they are not certified.

136
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,130
So you have to give yourself a certificate.

137
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:17,350
There’s no university to do that.

138
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:22,019
You have to understand yourself, what are
your problems, why you are behaving like this?

139
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:24,470
You treat yourself as a child.

140
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,709
When it is needed you have to rebuke yourself.

141
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:32,050
When you have to glorify, you should glorify
yourself.

142
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,970
So now you separate.

143
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:40,390
You become the mother, the Spirit is the mother,
and you, whatever you are which has to grow,

144
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,760
is the child.

145
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:54,190
Mother is the ideal, she is the inspiration,
she is the power, and the child is the recipient.

146
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:59,440
If the child is an obstinate fellow then you
can’t do anything about it.

147
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,980
Also find out – you might be one of them.

148
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,310
I know who are they like that.

149
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:09,390
There are many and you can find them out in
no time.

150
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:19,100
Obstinate fellows, if they live with ten people
suddenly we hear reports of their existence.

151
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:26,100
They are quite eloquent even if they are not
talking a word people can tell you: “I had

152
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,450
a fight with such and such.

153
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:36,150
That person said such and such a thing to
me, that person was so cruel to me, that person

154
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,880
demanded this.

155
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,470
” You know which person it is, where.

156
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,880
You see as a diamond can be made out thorns
can be made out, also anytime you go near

157
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,310
the thorn, anyone without exception, it will
bite everyone.

158
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,300
It is not going to spare, it’s a thorn.

159
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,720
So a thorn has to be a thorn.

160
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:06,360
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to be
a flower and a strong flower and an eternal

161
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,870
flower, that always grows, does not fade out.

162
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:19,300
Always growing, never fades, such a flower
you have to be, then you will be surprised

163
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:38,100
that you do not get into a trip of ego, neither
you go into a complete collapse of super-ego.

164
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:44,663
So much you know that any one of you can be
called as a scholar I can tell you.

165
00:16:44,663 --> 00:16:51,080
I mean so many times people have asked Me:
“Are they all scholars that You have – Your

166
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Disciples?”

167
00:16:52,080 --> 00:17:01,389
You know so much, much more than any Saint
ever knew I can assure you.

168
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:03,440
But you know only in the brain, outside.

169
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,010
It’s all bla bla bla.

170
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:13,530
It comes to the brain, you use it to show
off to others, and finished.

171
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:19,939
It doesn’t even settle down there, then
how will it go to the heart?

172
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:26,209
So everybody is talking big, they can impress
people.

173
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:32,860
I mean if some journalists come here they’ll
be so impressed by the Sahaja Yogis, so many

174
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:39,620
wise men in England sitting down here.

175
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:49,500
But you laugh at yourself; you have known
all this because I’ve been speaking too

176
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
much.

177
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,669
Also the Spirit is shining.

178
00:17:54,669 --> 00:18:06,240
Let your Spirit shine in such a way that people
know this is a man who is completely integrated:

179
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:15,980
the Spirit, the talk, the behavior, the life
itself is completely integrated and this is

180
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
what is Sahastrara.

181
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:25,400
So if there is no integration you have not
achieved your Sahastrara.

182
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:32,860
There will be no need to pull your ears.

183
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:44,140
A day should come when you all will raise
your heads with great pride and glory because

184
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,980
your ideals will shine like ornaments.

185
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,480
I want to see those days when all those who
claim to be Sahaja Yogis become that.

186
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,640
That’s the most important thing, all other
things are useless.

187
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,500
Getting an ashram, getting this, doing this,
doing that – forget it.

188
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:19,650
What you have to manage is this child which
has to grow, who is still naughty sometimes,

189
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,650
tries to misbehave.

190
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:21,880
Now put it right.

191
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,090
You give it a name.

192
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:29,960
You call yourself a Sahaja Yogi and that child
as Mr.

193
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
X, Mr.

194
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,660
Y whatever your name has been and always try
to tell: “Now will you behave yourself.

195
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:42,060
” Get up in the morning, have your bath,
sit down for meditation.

196
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,390
“I feel lazy,” the child says, “I can’t.

197
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:51,590
” Then you accept the child, then the child
will become the mother and you will be losing

198
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,010
your powers – excuses.

199
00:19:53,010 --> 00:20:03,330
The child knows, very intelligent, it’s
a very clever child, extremely intelligent,

200
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,640
knows how to deceive you.

201
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:13,169
But the child also knows innately what it
needs.

202
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:19,870
If it comes to know that the mother in you
has developed that personality, then it accepts

203
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,870
mother’s personality.

204
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:27,320
But if the child knows the mother herself
is weak then he starts taking advantage of

205
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,190
the mother.

206
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:41,820
So you have to not fight yourself but to tame
and this is very easy.

207
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:46,200
You’ll start enjoying it, looking at yourself:
“Oh Mr.

208
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,669
so and so.

209
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:49,240
” Then you won’t be angry.

210
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:55,950
“I know how to handle you, you’re hiding
behind there, all right, giving excuses.

211
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:09,860
” And the child grows big, so big that mother
sees that and is amazed.

212
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:18,890
Like in Shri Krishna’s childhood, the Mother
was Yeshoda and the child was Shri Krishna.

213
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,510
It’s very symbolic.

214
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:30,200
And He used to play very naughty tricks and
She said: “You went and ate that mud from

215
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
there.

216
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
I know you have eaten.

217
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,150
” He said: “How can I eat, how can I,
I can’t even go out of the house.

218
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,820
I’m sitting down here.

219
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,130
Where is the mud?

220
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,090
How can I eat?”

221
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:50,170
“You did eat, I know you have eaten, so
better show me your mouth.

222
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:58,790
” He says: “Really?” and then the mouth
opens and the complete Vishwa Swarup, complete

223
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:06,610
vision of the whole Vishwa She sees and the
Mother falls at His Feet.

224
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,330
That’s what it should be.

225
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:18,890
This mother has to fall at the feet of the
child that has grown.

226
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:24,380
Very symbolic.

227
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:31,419
That is how you have to grow, into that Vishwa
Swarup.

228
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:39,179
Into that Collective Being, into that Virata.

229
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:45,860
Arjuna and Shri Krishna is another very good
symbolic thing.

230
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:52,690
Arjuna was a friend who used to take liberties
with Shri Krishna.

231
00:22:52,690 --> 00:23:02,570
Shri Krishna tried to tell him about Gita,
all these things.

232
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:08,160
But still Shri Krishna could not convince
him of that.

233
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,890
All these were just outside “bla bla bla’s”;
as Mother’s talks are.

234
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:18,549
Mother’s talks are very entertaining you
know very humorous, nice to hear them, instead

235
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:23,150
of listening to any music better to hear Mother’s
talks.

236
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,360
And then the people think if they are listening
to Mother they have become Mother already.

237
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:38,630
That’s it happened to Arjuna also but still
he found out that there’s something lacking

238
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,710
in him, that he has not become the ideal.

239
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:47,790
Still his attention is not there as it should
have been.

240
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:54,619
So he asked Shri Krishna: “I think I’ll
see your great image.

241
00:23:54,619 --> 00:23:58,630
” Krishna said: “All right are you prepared?”

242
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:01,230
He said “Yes, I am prepared.

243
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:07,240
” And then He became the Virata, the vision
of the Virata and when he saw it, he said:

244
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,100
“Stop it, it is too much for me.

245
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
”

246
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:17,590
That’s what should happen to your friend
who is this child.

247
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:22,700
That it should become that Virata and when
you see that, should be amazed at yourself:

248
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,380
“Oh God, I have grown like this.

249
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,740
” Just like Yeshoda falling at the feet
of the little child, you have to fall at the

250
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,830
feet of the child that is within you.

251
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,800
I am sure this will happen now.

252
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,820
So remember that no argument, no explanation.

253
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,840
Mother is forgiving.

254
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,390
She’ll forgive you everything, you know
that.

255
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:58,340
Anything you do I’ll forgive you, even if
you murder Me I’ll forgive you, but you

256
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,789
won’t be able to forgive yourself.

257
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:08,000
So allow that child to grow, grow fully.

258
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,700
Shri Mataji : Who-why all the children’
are crying like this?

259
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,720
Shri Mataji : Why is it crying?

260
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,440
Which child is that?

261
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,730
Sahaja Yogi : Aarti.

262
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,020
Shri Mataji : Hum.

263
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,740
Aarti has a problem.

264
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:32,120
Take Aarti out, you must clear her, She has
had problems for so many days.

265
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,960
You must clear that child.

266
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,320
Take her out for a while.

267
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:51,260
Still screaming, better take her out.

268
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:57,380
You must look after them and find out what’s
wrong with your children if they are crying.

269
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,150
I know what are the children still not all
right.

270
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,350
Just don’t pamper their ego.

271
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,470
Work it out.

272
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,549
Clear them out.

273
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:05,549
It’s important.

274
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:07,059
Don’t want to be bhootish.

275
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:09,830
All their lives they’ll be bhootish like
this.

276
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,430
I’ve seen many children who are like this.

277
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:16,150
They see Me, they cry, weep, shout.

278
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:20,310
It’s not a sign of a healthy child.

279
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,470
Rajesh’s son would not even look at Me,
used to scream and shout.

280
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,299
Now look at him how nice he’s become.

281
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:33,920
So any child who is like that you don’t
say that, don’t avoid the topic.

282
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,730
Look after that child, put him right.

283
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,059
You have to see that the child is all right.

284
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:46,070
As you have to put your child all right also
put the child which is really your son and

285
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,940
do not live with that kind of a misunderstanding.

286
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:55,680
If a child cries like that there’s something
wrong with the child.

287
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:01,400
They are singled out.

288
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:08,370
If you find your attention is going here and
there, if you are not attentive in the program

289
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,630
something wrong with you also.

290
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:16,610
If you go off to sleep something very seriously
wrong with you.

291
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,720
At that time if you are thinking of other
things then something wrong with you.

292
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,520
You get headaches, something wrong with you.

293
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:33,750
Judge yourself, clear out, you must clear
out, that’s very important.

294
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:40,140
If you are still getting into tempers, irritation,
anger, there’s no balance that has come

295
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,290
in you, something wrong with you.

296
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:48,780
If you know how to control your anger, then
it’s all right.

297
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:54,020
You’ll find out everywhere how negativity
works in small things.

298
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:59,750
Everybody’s improving but it’s rather
slow.

299
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,870
It can be very fast if you meditate, that’s
very important.

300
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,540
You have to know how to make your chakras
all right.

301
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,890
Your mantras are to be siddhis.

302
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,980
Mantras are to be such that they should not
be mechanical, just saying something mechanically.

303
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,400
You should say it from your heart.

304
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:24,679
Again, if you do not say mantras through your
heart, mantra is not siddha – means you

305
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:27,710
may go on saying hundred times, it will have
no effect.

306
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:32,320
Siddha mantra is that, that you say that,
it has an effect, it works.

307
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:38,820
If it does not work then your mantra has no
meaning.

308
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:51,309
So the development has to be within and without
and you have to certify yourself.

309
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:53,650
Nobody else going to certify you.

310
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,299
If you want to give yourself a false certificate
go ahead.

311
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:00,260
If you want to cheat yourself go ahead.

312
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,850
It’s not going to help anyone.

313
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:09,270
But if you want to really have the joy and
the bliss of the grace of Heavenly Father,

314
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,990
then come out of it.

315
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:19,000
Many misidentifications that are there have
to be given up to enjoy that beauty.

316
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,919
It’s such a great day today to meet you
all.

317
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:31,240
Today is a day we celebrate in India where
relationship between brothers and sisters

318
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,039
has to be established.

319
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,390
They’re very pure.

320
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:40,820
Brothers and sisters relationship is without
any lust or greed.

321
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:49,620
It’s pure relationship where the sister
prays for the protection of the brother and

322
00:29:49,620 --> 00:30:03,970
brother prays for the self-sufficiency of
the kshema – well-being of the sister.

323
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:13,390
So this time you have to think of your other
Sahaja Yoginis and Sahaja Yogis who are like

324
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,909
your brothers and sisters.

325
00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:18,890
You have to think like that.

326
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,540
Purify your hearts.

327
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,220
It’s something funny in these countries
you know that there’s no such relationship

328
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,620
exists.

329
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:34,870
Purify your mind today on that point, that
everybody else is my brother or sister.

330
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,450
If you are married it’s all right.

331
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,919
But look at everyone, try to look at everyone
as a brother, and a sister.

332
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,370
Both relationships don’t exist.

333
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:51,039
This is a funny country where there is no
relationship which is pure.

334
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,350
It’s such a filth I tell you.

335
00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:06,520
If you read them you can’t believe it, such
perversion.

336
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:11,760
Specially innocent people like children are
attacked.

337
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,559
Think of them as virgins.

338
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:19,779
Be careful.

339
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:22,590
And the young girls should know that they
are virgins.

340
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:31,590
If they go about with boys and they are Sahaja
Yogis, they’re not.

341
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:39,590
Sahaja Yoginis have to be chaste women, powerful,
chastity is their power and men too.

342
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:47,559
After Sahaja Yoga men should become conscious
of their chastity, that is their power too.

343
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:54,580
You see this was nomadic times when the men
used to go for hunting and women used to cook

344
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
in the house.

345
00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:03,990
Men were supposed to have five women – they
were nomadic people, then they became sophisticated.

346
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:10,340
Then the monogamy started which reached a
certain point.

347
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,549
Then again this kind of an abandoned life
started.

348
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:14,549
This is nomadic life.

349
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,730
Now women also have become nomadic.

350
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,930
Men and women are all nomadic and primitive.

351
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:27,000
After sophistication they have become primitive,
this is the problem is.

352
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:37,210
But now you have to become higher beings where
there are pure relationships.

353
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:43,380
Any relationships, supposing there was something
in between Me and this instrument, we cannot

354
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,770
use it.

355
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:49,309
Any connection can be cut off if there is
something in between.

356
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:57,000
To have the best connection is to have pure
relationships and it should be discretionary.

357
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,590
Mother is a mother, father is a father, sister
is a sister, brother is a brother, all these

358
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,279
are different, various types of relationships
should be understood.

359
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,220
Women must understand they are women and men
must understand they are men.

360
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,130
Also relationship to yourself is very important.

361
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:22,909
Women should not try to be men – we cannot,
and men should not try to be women.

362
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:24,059
Is wrong.

363
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:27,820
Because basically they are different people.

364
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,770
They are born differently.

365
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,320
What is the difference?

366
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,799
A man is more meticulous, he knows more about
machines, details about it.

367
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,760
A woman will see the pattern.

368
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:45,000
Woman will listen to the tune more, man will
be seeing to the instruments.

369
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,120
That’s the nature God has created you.

370
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,420
After all somebody has to see this and somebody
has to see that, both are beautiful.

371
00:33:53,420 --> 00:34:00,309
Nobody is higher or lower, but enjoy yourself
as being a woman, enjoy yourself as being

372
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:01,330
a man.

373
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:05,630
But man does not mean that you aggress women
thinking stupidly that you are higher than

374
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,639
woman in evolution.

375
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,609
Or women dominating men thinking that by dominating
them they can put them right.

376
00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:17,659
They have never put them right by that.

377
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,969
They have gone absolutely cabbages, men have
become cabbages.

378
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:24,809
Wherever women dominate, men become cabbages.

379
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,649
They have not put them right.

380
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:37,739
So both the qualities must be nourished and
developed and the relationship between man

381
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:46,009
and woman should be of pure love.

382
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:50,719
Once you start purifying yourself these things
will automatically work out and you’ll respect

383
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,719
each other.

384
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,069
Actually you are all yogis.

385
00:34:53,069 --> 00:34:59,499
I have to respect you and you have to respect
each other.

386
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:02,569
On the contrary I find there is no respect.

387
00:35:02,569 --> 00:35:05,569
You are all great saints.

388
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:07,999
Yes, you are.

389
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:10,859
Respect, respect each other.

390
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:15,459
You’re not to talk harshly to anyone, to
trouble anyone.

391
00:35:15,459 --> 00:35:20,059
Try to do as much as possible for others.

392
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:22,709
This is the way we have to change.

393
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:30,720
This has no brand, of any culture, is the
culture of God we are talking about, is the

394
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,219
culture of His Kingdom.

395
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:41,969
Where we give others, enjoy giving, doing
for others, loving others, caring for others

396
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:43,849
– without any return.

397
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:47,000
If you little bit help yourself the Divine
is very anxious.

398
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,599
You have seen today that the vibrations are
so much that really I am finding it difficult

399
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,049
even to talk to you, sucking, it’s going
on.

400
00:35:56,049 --> 00:36:01,640
Just a little thing you did yesterday, or
this morning.

401
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:10,130
Tremendous vibrations, and you’ll be thrown
into that, you’ll blossom into something.

402
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:13,999
Just pay attention to yourself and first and
foremost respect yourself because you are

403
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:14,999
a yogi.

404
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:24,009
You cannot be indignified, you cannot be stupid,
you cannot be high handed, you cannot be dishonest.

405
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:32,890
You have to be a sweet, matured personality
because you are a yogi.

406
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:38,380
I mean you should call yourself Yogi X, Y,
Z.

407
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:47,140
Should, you are – but calling Yogi and fighting
and pulling each other’s hair, then I would

408
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:54,759
say it’s better not call.

409
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:58,839
Try to get rid of your problems which are
very simple.

410
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,369
If you cannot, then tell Me.

411
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:14,290
I will tell you how to get rid of them.

412
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:17,559
Face them out.

413
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:23,020
May God bless you all!

414
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:32,830
Now today we’ll not have any havan, that
we have decided because in the Diwali there

415
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:40,059
is no need to have any havan but we’ll have
just the puja.

416
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:44,900
Now today is the puja – as you know there
are five days they celebrate Diwali.

417
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:53,849
The first day is the thirteenth day where
it is the gruhalaksmi’s day, that is the

418
00:37:53,849 --> 00:38:00,059
day when the gruhalaksmi is worshipped.

419
00:38:00,059 --> 00:38:09,819
But a gruhalakshmi has to be worthy of the
worship, and then some utensil is given to

420
00:38:09,819 --> 00:38:13,019
the gruhalakshmi.

421
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:17,869
Some sort of a utensil is to be given to the
gruhalakshmi as a present.

422
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:25,229
That is the day Lakshmi was born, Lakshmi
was born out of the Mother Earth.

423
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:33,739
Out of the, we should say, Mother Earth but
She came out of the sea after the churning,

424
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:36,529
so that is the birth of the Lakshmi.

425
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:47,990
She’s the giver of wealth, wealth which
is material as well as spiritual.

426
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:53,049
A wife who says that: “All right you save
all the money,” teaches the children to

427
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:59,619
be selfish and teaches the husband to be selfish,
to save all the money in the bank and not

428
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:02,960
to be charitable is not a Lakshmi.

429
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,349
She’s the One who teaches you how to be
charitable, how to give to others.

430
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:15,640
A woman who is very particular about her money
and bank balances is not a Lakshmi at all.

431
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
She has to spend.

432
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,740
She’s there to spend.

433
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,219
Man has to preserve his money but the woman
has to spend.

434
00:39:21,219 --> 00:39:33,290
He has to earn for she has to spend, but rightly,
spend it rightly, not only for herself but

435
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,950
for the family, but for the husband.

436
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:45,630
She thinks: “What should I buy for my husband,
for my children, for other Sahaja Yogis, for

437
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,029
other people?” – all her job.

438
00:39:48,029 --> 00:39:54,329
The husband earns and gives it to her and
she does that.

439
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:57,800
It’s a very sweet distribution I think.

440
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,180
So that’s the day of the Gruhalakshmi when
She’s born.

441
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:07,699
She must have these qualities, if she’s
a miserly, calculating type of a woman she

442
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,589
is not a woman at all to begin with.

443
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:20,200
If she’s worried about her own clothes and
her own comforts and her own things then she’s

444
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,020
not a Gruhalakshmi.

445
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:27,130
She makes others work and sits down herself
and orders about – she’s not a Gruhalakshmi

446
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,279
at all.

447
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:36,019
She has to work for others, she has to do
for others, she has to look after.

448
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,900
That’s the thirteenth day.

449
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,079
Then the fourteenth day is the day when Narakasura
was killed.

450
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:52,559
You know Narakasura has taken his birth and
he’s to be killed – the Sahaja Yogis are

451
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,459
going to kill him.

452
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:59,280
You have to come up to a point and definitely
he can be killed.

453
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,940
When Kartikeya is awakened within you he can
be killed.

454
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:09,769
But for that you have to be just like gold,
untarnishable.

455
00:41:09,769 --> 00:41:14,329
You need strong people to do that.

456
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:23,279
A sword that can kill him has to come out
of your metals, then Narakasura can be killed.

457
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:27,969
He is one of the worst possible asura.

458
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:29,230
That is the fourteenth day.

459
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:40,019
When he was killed the gate of hell was opened
and all those who were his disciples or his

460
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:43,589
followers or satanic people were put.

461
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:52,670
That’s the only day you can sleep late,
and a good news for you.

462
00:41:52,670 --> 00:42:05,969
Then the fifteenth day, is the darkest night
which we had, darkest night, that is the night

463
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:10,950
when you put the lights on because it is the
darkest night the negative forces can walk

464
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,599
in.

465
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:18,119
So the lights are put because Lakshmi can
come in.

466
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:27,170
You’ll be surprised how Lakshmiji is, that
if a bottle of wine enters from one end She

467
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,709
disappears from another.

468
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:34,880
If there’s a lady, she’s bhootish in the
family, they can never have the enjoyment

469
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,119
of Lakshmi.

470
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:40,390
The Lakshmiji runs away from them.

471
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,830
They may have money but they cannot enjoy.

472
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:46,869
The Lakshmiji will run away.

473
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:52,530
Such a person will be so inauspicious I tell
you.

474
00:42:52,530 --> 00:43:00,170
Supposing you want to, say, buy something
and such a bhootish person telephones to you-

475
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:01,569
cannot get it, finished.

476
00:43:01,569 --> 00:43:08,339
First of all your ears will be finished with
the poison and then whatever work you are

477
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,999
doing you’ll never be successful.

478
00:43:10,999 --> 00:43:18,119
Now this country is so full of such bhootish
women – alakshmis, that I don’t know how

479
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:21,430
will they become all right.

480
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:28,049
The women have to decide to get rid of their
bhoots and not to carry on with them.

481
00:43:28,049 --> 00:43:33,989
They must meditate, they must try, if they
feel sleepy they must go and have a bath,

482
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:41,950
go twice, thrice, sometimes burning yourself
a little bit, doesn’t matter.

483
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:47,329
See to it that you don’t feel sleepy and
dreamy.

484
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:51,420
If you are dreamy by nature then you are bhootish.

485
00:43:51,420 --> 00:44:01,019
That’s the responsibility of women to keep
the Lakshmi intact.

486
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:06,509
So that’s the Lakshmi Day when we say that
Lakshmi Puja takes place because that is the

487
00:44:06,509 --> 00:44:15,219
day you invite the Lakshmi to come in, the
Rajalakshmi, the Lakshmi by which you become

488
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:27,499
the king of the family, or the royal benevolence
you can call it, the regal feeling in the

489
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:34,829
family – that is the day.

490
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:42,009
Then comes the day, next to that is the first
of the month in…

491
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:48,109
That is the calendar, My forefathers, because
you’re all My children you have to use the

492
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:53,309
same calendar, Shalivahanas calendar and that
is the first day of the Shalivahanas calendar.

493
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:57,140
And what do they do in the morning time to
celebrate it?

494
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:09,699
They take one of these jars, Aquarius and
put a shawl with it and that is put as a flag,

495
00:45:09,699 --> 00:45:13,289
representing the Aquarius and the shawl of
the Mother.

496
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:17,650
That’s why they are called as Shalivahana
– the ones who carry the shawls of the Mother,

497
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:20,400
the “carriers of the shawls of the Mother”.

498
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,910
That’s how they put it up.

499
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:28,119
The shawl on top of the Aquarius.

500
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:38,509
This should be actually the flag of the Sahaja
Yogis that you make it the Aquarius or we

501
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:49,199
can say the jar [- what do you call that pitcher?

502
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:55,509
Or not pitcher but this lota business what
do you call that – there’s nothing used

503
00:45:55,509 --> 00:45:56,509
like that here.

504
00:45:56,509 --> 00:46:03,279
That one is kumbha – we can call in kumbha
and the shawl is there so they put it up.

505
00:46:03,279 --> 00:46:04,390
That’s why they] (FV note: The section between
square brackets was not found on either my

506
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:05,390
audio tape or mp3 file, and hence could not
be verified.

507
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:10,150
) call as Gudi Padwa, Padwa means first day
of the moon is Padwa, and Gudi means “this”.

508
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:20,839
So they put it up and that is how they say
that today is the New Year day for the Shalivahanas.

509
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:34,239
Shawl is the covering of your Mother which
gives it warmth and also it covers Her modesty.

510
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:41,450
Shawl is a sign of regality and modesty and
chastity.

511
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,979
So you stand for that of your Mother.

512
00:46:42,979 --> 00:46:53,400
You protect it like Ganesha does.

513
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:00,130
Only on one point He gets angry, if anybody
says or does anything against the Mother,

514
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,529
then He comes down.

515
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:09,449
That’s why Christ has said: “Anything
against Me I’ll tolerate, but anything against

516
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:14,299
the Holy Ghost, will not be forgiven.

517
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:22,180
” That’s the Son talking about the Mother,
that’s what happens.

518
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,589
So today is the second day.

519
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:38,269
Second day is the Bija – is the they call
it the Bhav-bija is the day when the brother

520
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:49,299
and the sister, who are the seeds of one tree
have that pure exchange of affection.

521
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:55,209
The sister does the aarti of the brother,
gives him a tika and then brother gives her

522
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:59,150
something as a token of his love, as a present.

523
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:04,410
In Bombay we started that and they have made
sisters and brothers.

524
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:08,299
I wish you also could find out somebody as
a nice brother.

525
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:19,199
But I found that these relationships have
been so beautifully managed in India that

526
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:27,999
if they could be managed here, it will be
a great day of really ecstasy for Me, because

527
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:34,170
that means you have overcome this devil of
immorality.

528
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:42,499
The purity, removing the lust and greed from
your mind completely and bestowing that affection

529
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:47,170
for someone who is your sister.

530
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:51,910
Very common in India, everybody has a sister
there; all the Sahaja Yogis have a sister

531
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:55,509
and they look after their sister that way.

532
00:48:55,509 --> 00:49:02,969
Is a very sweet feeling and a sister is treated
– like Raulbai is a sister of Dumas you

533
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:10,430
can imagine, and her sister is treated with
the same grace as the own sister is to be

534
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,880
treated with all the relationships and everything.

535
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,189
So this is the fifth day is Dwija.

536
00:49:17,189 --> 00:49:22,410
So from thirteenth to the fifth day they celebrate
Diwali.

537
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:25,779
For us Diwali has a very great significance.

538
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:35,400
That is, from one light many lights are awakened
and they are put in a line, so they are called

539
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,309
as Diwali – means ‘the lights put in a
line’.

540
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:47,650
So when you hold My Hands together all of
us – through that the energy passes and

541
00:49:47,650 --> 00:50:02,019
the enlightened rasa is established, and the
whole world has to become that beautiful reign

542
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:18,059
of your Mother where nothing but the bliss
of your Father and His enjoyment when He sees

543
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:24,569
His Own Creation dancing in that Ocean of
Bliss.

544
00:50:24,569 --> 00:50:26,720
May God bless you.
