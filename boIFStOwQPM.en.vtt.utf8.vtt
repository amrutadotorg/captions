00:00:43.700 --> 00:01:40.300
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Ganesha
Puja.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:56.009
The first deity that was created by the Adi
Shakti was Shri Ganesh because it was necessary

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:21.620
first to create the deity of principles - the
deity of principle in the sense that whatever

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:38.260
is created, whatever is there as called "bhava,"
whatever has been so far created up to human

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.590
level.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:58.541
Everything had to be through the implanted
mechanism of energy, otherwise nothing could

00:02:58.541 --> 00:03:05.209
have been created.

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:15.950
If you go into the matter, say sulphur dioxide,
then sulphur and oxide - go on deep into it

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:25.750
till you reach the state when it is a molecule
- then you see these atoms of sulphur and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.300
oxygen, they oscillate.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.700
They oscillate with a frequency.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.069
There are three types of frequencies they
use.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:52.540
Now imagine in the molecule, think of it,
in the molecule of a substance there is an

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.530
energy which is acting.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.830
Now one may say that, "Why should be in matter
there is energy?"

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:16.650
One can ask a question: "Why there should
be energy in matter?"

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:27.690
If there was no energy in the matter, how
can you have all chemical compounds?

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.790
Who pushes them?

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.580
Say, you have sodium chloride.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.220
Sodium and chloride are attached to each other,
but if the chloride has to go to some other

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.950
atom, then who does that?

00:04:46.950 --> 00:05:03.230
There has to be some energy which is absolutely
inbuilt into matter.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:17.750
Now, we may say that, "What about water?"

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.590
You know water has energy.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.470
That's how we have hydrostatics.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:39.340
Even coal, even stones, all of them have got
energy within themselves and it is all controlled

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.290
by the principle of Shri Ganesha.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:53.730
So, though He's such a small, little, tiny,
little child, how great is His work and how

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.420
much He has to work out.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:04.610
Now from matter, you move, say, to living
plants, then to animals, then to human beings

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.440
and everywhere His energy works.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:16.870
At the level of matter, they might call it
electromagnetic, but potentially it is the

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.890
energy of Shri Ganesh, which is electromagnetic
at that point.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.990
Then it starts evolving, growing.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:46.250
That's how we have different stratas of energies
that we see in different growth of the evolution.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:07:05.770
In the human being it exists, as you know,
as auspiciousness, as purity, mainly the innocence.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:15.410
So the power of innocence is such a guiding
factor.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.920
There's a difference between ignorance and
innocence.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:37.850
If you are innocent, then to you nothing is
important except for love.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:48.470
For an innocent person who is not conditioned,
who is not egoistical, who is not so-called

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:56.360
mature, it is the love that it understands.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:14.790
It doesn't care for any wealth, any power,
anything; but the love that it can feel, the

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:20.420
pure love of a person.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:33.440
Innocent person has no understanding of gaining
anything out of the love he receives or he

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:38.240
gives, no sense at all.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:44.560
Innocence is the basis of all the dharmas.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:58.220
If you have no innocence you cannot follow
dharma because if you are dharmic, it is maybe

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:07.030
your mental attitude, maybe egoistical, maybe
because you are born in a religion, because

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.460
somebody has told you about it.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.820
It's going to be very superficial.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:24.710
Unless and until it is embedded in the quality
of innocence, dharma has no meaning.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.520
In that state you are dharmic.

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:38.160
You are beyond any thinking about it, of any
deductions about it, but you are dharmic.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.770
You cannot be adharmi.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:52.080
You cannot be - as if the manifestation of
innocence is morality.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:10:01.180
Once Shri Ganesha is awakened - I hope He
has been awakened in all of you - and if you

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:13.670
respect Him, just respect Him, then automatically
you develop a sense of morality.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.140
I don't have to tell you.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.600
I don't have to explain to you.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:24.060
You just become moral.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:31.030
People who have seen you are quite amazed
and said that, "How is it that their eyes

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:37.830
are fixed, so innocent, without any lust and
greed?"

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:49.890
Is the light of Shri Ganesha from the back
Agnya; front Agnya is Jesus Christ Who is

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:58.060
the manifestation of Shri Ganesha.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.660
It is impossible for western mind to understand
that Jesus Christ was purity.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:11.470
They can't understand, and they have criticized
Him and said horrible things against.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:25.510
Somehow He's forgiving them, but one thing
about Shri Ganesh is that, that He worships

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:27.840
His Mother.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:34.050
Motherhood is very important.

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:48.990
Motherhood in the women, motherhood in the
father and also in the children has to be

00:11:48.990 --> 00:12:01.060
accepted as the mainstay of family life and
society.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:16.620
The ordinary life of a human being - very
simple, innocent, simple people - revolves

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.570
around the mother.

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:25.930
It revolves, but the mothers have to be mothers.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:42.420
As Shri Ganesha is so much surrendered to
His Mother and who is His Mother?

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.210
Is Adi Shakti.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:52.490
He does not know anybody else, just knows
His Mother.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:13:03.930
This is extremely important in Sahaj Yoga.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:15.160
As we say, there is immoral human beings,
there are.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:31.800
They're doing immoral things because they're
committing sin against the Adi Shakti; committing

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:38.440
sin against Ganesha.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:51.029
It may be forgiven, but committing sin against
the Adi Shakti, it encompasses a very big

00:13:51.029 --> 00:14:06.980
area where we start seeing how we are committing
the sin against the Adi Shakti which, ultimately,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.670
Shri Ganesha punishes - ultimately.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:23.270
Actually, the Adi Shakti doesn't punish anyone,
the deities only punish them.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:38.760
First and foremost thing that is to be understood,
that innocence should be respected, looked

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:46.380
after, nourished and protected.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:52.399
That's why I'm very particular about the children.

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:57.320
Children should not be exposed to the public.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:04.649
We should not try to make photographs out
of our children and expose them in the newspaper

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:09.110
or give them for advertisement or anything
there.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:25.930
Is a very wrong idea to expose your children
to gain some money out of them in any way,

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:33.649
in the smallest way also, because we are selling
the innocence, the innocence which is invaluable,

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:40.250
writ large on the children.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:46.779
Many children I know who have been advertised
and all that, specially in India, have died.

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:57.470
Also we have to look after our children with
great care.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:02.180
But we go to two extremes, I have seen.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.330
Some people are only worried about their own
children.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:10.930
If anything happens to them, just get upset.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.320
That means you are respecting your child because
he's your child.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:21.700
But if you are respecting him because he carries
innocence with him, then you have to respect

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:31.520
every child and understand every child - what
they talk, what they say, how they behave.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.720
Luckily, you all have got children now who
are born-realized.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.010
It's such a great thing, such a blessing.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:45.100
So on one side, we have to see how innocent
they are and how they talk.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.020
I'll give you an example.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:55.750
Bogdan - no, this Wolfgang was very serious
and his wife told Me that, "We were taking

00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:01.750
him to the hospital, so this doctor says,
'Why are you taking him to the hospital?

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.370
There are no Sahaja Yogis there.

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:08.270
How will they correct his chakras?'"

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:10.829
Innocently said the correct thing and they
couldn't do.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.880
Doctors didn't do anything.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.130
I had to cure him.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.689
"Take him to Mother.

00:17:16.689 --> 00:17:19.699
Why are you taking him to the hospital?"

00:17:19.699 --> 00:17:27.350
They see the right point and say the right
thing because they're innocent and innocence

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:35.640
means they have pure attention - pure attention
for anything you need.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:45.200
Say, music, for art, for anything you have
to have pure attention and that comes through

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.360
your innocence.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:54.140
Say a person who is an artist and who is very
money-oriented, say for example, a person

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:57.279
who is doing some paintings and all that.

00:17:57.279 --> 00:18:01.309
His art cannot become eternal art.

00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:02.309
Cannot.

00:18:02.309 --> 00:18:06.999
That's why we see in modern times whatever
art is created, it just comes and goes.

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:11.059
It has no eternal value.

00:18:11.059 --> 00:18:13.669
Same with the modern music that they're having.

00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:15.200
The same thing is happening.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:24.080
It comes and goes and no one knows where it
has disappeared.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:36.611
Behind it is money orientation, and that money
orientation results into a kind of a creation

00:18:36.611 --> 00:18:42.850
which is not perfect.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:51.850
All creations which were dedicated to God
in the olden times are being today very much

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.600
respected and people pay a lot of money for
that.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:01.039
Maybe, at that time, the artists must have
suffered; but they understood, innocent artists

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:12.360
understood, very much that if we have to express,
we must truthfully do it, not to please, not

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.730
to please the people, not to please anyone,
but to please God.

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:24.739
As you know that Michelangelo had a big fight
with this pope here because he couldn't tolerate

00:19:24.739 --> 00:19:27.940
nonsense that was coming from the pope.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:33.150
All the artists always have been fighting
- real artists.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:38.410
So this innocence also gives you a power of
self-understanding.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:44.280
You know where you stand.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:54.039
A person who is innocent knows very well that
he is standing on the pedestal of virtues.

00:19:54.039 --> 00:20:01.549
He should not give in to all kinds of nonsensical
things which are very popular, may be fashionable,

00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:02.549
may be accepted.

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:06.919
For what?

00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:11.399
For what are we going to sacrifice our innocence?

00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:15.860
What is our gain?

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:21.860
May be some people are too brilliant and they
may try to show off with their brilliance

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:28.549
for a short time, but they don't remain in
the eternal history.

00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:38.279
They go as egoistical people or as very dishonest
people.

00:20:38.279 --> 00:20:41.669
Nobody respects them.

00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:53.409
So there is a big attack on the innocence
of people.

00:20:53.409 --> 00:20:55.889
Big attack.

00:20:55.889 --> 00:20:57.360
First it comes from children.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:03.649
As you see, this nonsense that is going on
which we hear about - I mean, I can't even

00:21:03.649 --> 00:21:06.480
understand why they do it.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:13.500
They do it on children, these funny attacks
of abuses.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:20.210
It's just because they want to kill the innocence.

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:26.600
Perhaps those who do it have no innocence
in them, and they don't want the children

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.720
to have any innocence left in them.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.889
Otherwise, in India is something we can't
understand.

00:21:33.889 --> 00:21:40.639
Really, we can't understand; but it is becoming
much more prevalent, much more fashionable

00:21:40.639 --> 00:21:52.720
now because there is definitely an attack
on innocence, not only on children, but even

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.279
on people who are innocent.

00:21:56.279 --> 00:22:07.769
Because those who have deliberations in criminality,
in all kinds of sinful act will never, never

00:22:07.769 --> 00:22:09.909
try to protect innocence.

00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:15.340
Never, because juxtaposition is there.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.679
They are doing something which they think
is the best.

00:22:19.679 --> 00:22:24.109
I don't know if they think that way, but I
don't know what justifies their behavior like

00:22:24.109 --> 00:22:30.980
this is to attack the innocence of children.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:36.620
In so many ways, you'll find this innocence
is being attacked.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:44.370
If your children are doing well, if they are
studying well, somebody might try to catch

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.090
hold of them.

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:57.639
If some person they find is an innocent person,
they will try to put him into trouble.

00:22:57.639 --> 00:23:05.669
The innocence is sort of - is, itself, is
such a power that it challenges the hatred,

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:11.759
the abusive nature of people.

00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:24.210
First of all, we should see that how our conditioning
takes over our innocence.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.720
It makes you extremely ritualistic.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:33.389
Even in Sahaja Yoga, I've seen, I've heard
also, that people are extremely, extremely

00:23:33.389 --> 00:23:49.720
ritualistic.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:56.850
Now the ritualism is like this: that you have
to say something three times, you say it three

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:01.110
times, seven times like tied up people.

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:11.610
I've seen some Sahaja Yogis like that; and
some Sahaj Yogis, I think they must be bhootish,

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:13.450
get frightened with Me.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.249
What is there to be frightened of Me?

00:24:15.249 --> 00:24:20.350
Because they're bhootish, they are getting
frightened.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.419
Otherwise, why should you?

00:24:23.419 --> 00:24:32.159
I love you all and you won't find more, a
greater, mild Guru than Myself.

00:24:32.159 --> 00:24:38.029
I don't think so, but they're afraid.

00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:40.389
Even if you look at them, they'll not smile.

00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:41.539
They'll be afraid.

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:42.809
What wrong have you done?

00:24:42.809 --> 00:24:45.799
You have become Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:49.559
They're so ritualistic in everything.

00:24:49.559 --> 00:24:57.659
So one should understand a difference between
a protocol and ritualism.

00:24:57.659 --> 00:25:01.190
An innocent child knows the protocol.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:09.919
I remember there was a child who came to see
Me in Austria and I said, "Let's go upstairs."

00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:15.279
So it was a small, little staircase of wood.

00:25:15.279 --> 00:25:16.299
He said, "What?

00:25:16.299 --> 00:25:20.629
Is She going to go up without a red carpet?"

00:25:20.629 --> 00:25:25.600
This came into his head, you see.

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:32.820
So for children, you see, innocent children,
the worship, everything is not ritualistic.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.899
It is heartfelt.

00:25:33.899 --> 00:25:46.779
You feel it from the heart: how to do the
worship, how to show your love.

00:25:46.779 --> 00:26:00.639
Is very sweet way an innocent person does
it; while a person who is very ritualistic,

00:26:00.639 --> 00:26:06.499
he may even beat another person because, "Why
did you do this?

00:26:06.499 --> 00:26:08.700
You should not have put camphor in it?

00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.419
Why did you put the camphor so?

00:26:10.419 --> 00:26:12.419
It's very wrong."

00:26:12.419 --> 00:26:14.429
There's nothing wrong.

00:26:14.429 --> 00:26:24.860
If you do it with your heart, with your open
heart, innocently, anything is all right.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:32.779
It is the open heart which is necessary, not
the closed heart - "Why did you do it?

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:35.389
Why didn't you do it?

00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:36.850
Where did you sit?

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:37.850
What happened?"

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.850
Nothing.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:45.330
Now you are in the Kingdom of God and here
there are no such rules and regulations that

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.590
you should be ritualistic.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.919
But everything has a double, has a double
style.

00:26:52.919 --> 00:26:58.789
Now I say you need not be ritualistic.

00:26:58.789 --> 00:27:00.070
Once I went into an ashram.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.350
I found everything was just like a pigsty.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:06.000
I said, "What's this?

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.159
Is this an ashram or what is it?"

00:27:09.159 --> 00:27:17.460
So they said, "Mother, You told us that, "You
have to be innocent and you don't have to

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.109
be ritualistic."

00:27:20.109 --> 00:27:23.570
So we thought, "Throw all the things wherever
you feel like.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:26.870
What is there to be ritualistic?"

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:33.149
Is a very common thing with all the ashram
people, leaders tell Me that Sahaja Yogis

00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:38.779
have no sense at all of looking after the
cleanliness of the ashram.

00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:40.510
They're least bothered.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:46.700
If it is their house, they look after; but
if it is an ashram they do not.

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:54.000
It's very surprising and I have seen, or I
have heard, that ashrams all of bhootish and

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.600
false gurus are absolutely spick and span.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.410
Really.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:11.399
Is very surprising and, even here in Cabella,
people were telling Me that they're living

00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:13.369
like animals.

00:28:13.369 --> 00:28:20.269
I said, "Animals are innocent, you know."

00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:25.739
You go into a jungle, now - I don't know,
we are going to take you this time into a

00:28:25.739 --> 00:28:32.220
jungle - you'll have no smell, no horrid things
to see, nothing.

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.210
It's very clean, spick and span, all the time.

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:42.669
But you put one human being, you will immediately
know that there has been a human being.

00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:46.309
They have their own systems of keeping things
clean.

00:28:46.309 --> 00:28:53.759
Even the tiger, who is an innocent thing - up
to animal stage you are innocent - he has

00:28:53.759 --> 00:28:57.269
his own styles.

00:28:57.269 --> 00:29:02.419
I don't know if you know about a tiger or
not, but a tiger will kill an animal because

00:29:02.419 --> 00:29:04.769
he has to eat, after all.

00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:05.929
He suppose to only eat animals.

00:29:05.929 --> 00:29:06.929
He doesn't eat grass.

00:29:06.929 --> 00:29:07.929
What to do?

00:29:07.929 --> 00:29:09.830
He's not a vegetarian.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.340
God has made him like that.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.070
So he accepts.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:19.509
Now he goes and kills the cow or anything.

00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:25.239
Then he leaves his kill there for the blood
to ooze out.

00:29:25.239 --> 00:29:34.509
Nobody will touch that, nobody, because he's
really the king, not out of fear, but of protocol.

00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:36.190
Then next day he goes.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:39.240
He eats, then his family eats and all that.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.499
Then finished for the whole month.

00:29:41.499 --> 00:29:43.729
They come out.

00:29:43.729 --> 00:29:48.729
Then the lower animals start going there.

00:29:48.729 --> 00:29:59.869
Like you have - don't know what you call them
... I miss in English.

00:29:59.869 --> 00:30:03.030
I don't know if they have - leopards, leopards.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:09.139
Leopards and all these animals come out and
they start eating.

00:30:09.139 --> 00:30:11.190
And then even lower and lower till the birds.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:15.359
Still the crow, they stay back.

00:30:15.359 --> 00:30:18.239
Last are crows.

00:30:18.239 --> 00:30:21.109
Can you imagine?

00:30:21.109 --> 00:30:25.909
Such a system, they have.

00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:36.029
They go all the way from Siberia to Australia.

00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:37.369
How do they manage?

00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:39.169
Think of it.

00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:43.070
What gives them direction is innocence.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:48.659
And the innocence is magnet.

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:49.659
It's a magnet.

00:30:49.659 --> 00:30:51.609
It's actually, it's a magnet.

00:30:51.609 --> 00:30:57.190
In a human being you do not find a magnet
because it has now evolved so much, but it

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.940
starts just like a magnet.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:04.760
So they know which is north, which is south,
east and west.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.919
Even a little bee, you find and put a mark
on it.

00:31:09.919 --> 00:31:15.950
It goes to the place from where it has come.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:20.970
How does it find its own way?

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:27.980
Is the innocence, is like a magnet, acts like
a magnet.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.119
Even in the fishes.

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:32.650
Just imagine how fishes have direction.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:38.289
We don't have - I mean, human beings can be
lost, I mean many a times I am lost with so

00:31:38.289 --> 00:31:45.499
many drivers I've had.

00:31:45.499 --> 00:31:57.659
So many times I've been lost, but animals
never.

00:31:57.659 --> 00:32:07.019
You know, if you take a dog and you don't
want the dog, you leave him about, say, fifty

00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:10.869
miles away, he'll come back.

00:32:10.869 --> 00:32:15.309
How does he find the way?

00:32:15.309 --> 00:32:25.979
So their qualities which are built-in within
them, through their innocence, are actually

00:32:25.979 --> 00:32:34.899
the qualities of electromagnetic force and
also pranava; that is when electromagnetic

00:32:34.899 --> 00:32:43.979
force is charged with Ganesha's Principle.

00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:45.860
That's why they're so systematic.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.619
They are so clean.

00:32:47.619 --> 00:32:56.960
They are so sensible, but they're not ritualistic.

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:01.359
They're not ritualistic.

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:05.330
Whatever God has given them, they have accepted.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:07.809
They're bound by that.

00:33:07.809 --> 00:33:13.500
They're bound and they live with that boundary.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:20.549
Even if you go up to the stage of animals
which live with human beings, they, too, are

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:22.370
very affectionate.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.719
They just want love.

00:33:24.719 --> 00:33:25.960
Nothing else.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:32.929
See, one day if you do not care for your dog,
he'll just not eat his food, not eat his food.

00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:36.740
He wouldn't care for the food.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:46.529
It is so remarkable, even I have seen among
children how they just want love.

00:33:46.529 --> 00:33:51.330
They don't accept anything else but love;
but as soon as they start growing up, you

00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:58.720
see, specially in a materialistic world, then
the whole materialism comes in.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:08.109
So the second way we kill our children's innocence
is putting materialistic ideas into their

00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:09.109
heads.

00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:15.490
Of course, the media is there which is selling
now-a-days a teddy bear which has a birthday.

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:18.030
Teddy bear has a birthday.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:20.179
Can you imagine?

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:23.710
So everybody's buying teddy bear with a birthday.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:29.770
Because the parents don't want to be in the
company of children, so they get some sort

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:34.620
of a toys - this, that, one or two is all
right - and put them with the toys, with the

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.620
television on.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.700
"Now, sit down."

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:43.690
Children start becoming naturally materialistic.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:57.680
They start asking for things, and for 
demands of such kind that sometimes one is

00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.329
surprised.

00:34:59.329 --> 00:35:05.589
You take a western child to the market and
you've had it.

00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:09.609
But you take Indian children, they'll never
take anything.

00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:11.589
Really, it's so difficult to make them.

00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:14.730
At least, I have seen My own grandchildren
and other.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:19.039
You take them, it's a headache to buy even
another pair of shoes for them.

00:35:19.039 --> 00:35:20.329
"No, but we have one.

00:35:20.329 --> 00:35:22.799
Why do you want to buy another?"

00:35:22.799 --> 00:35:24.369
"...That will give way."

00:35:24.369 --> 00:35:25.789
"No, we can come here."

00:35:25.789 --> 00:35:26.789
"How."

00:35:26.789 --> 00:35:29.030
"We can come in the car or else we can walk."

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.650
"But you'll have no shoes.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.650
Nothing."

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:32.650
"One is all right.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.060
Why to have two?"

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:40.920
You give them money, they'll buy one small
little thing and come.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:52.349
You see, it is the whole tradition of materialism
which has brought this innocence to a stop.

00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:56.920
Then a child starts growing in the same materialistic
way.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:04.589
He starts judging people like, "How many cars
you have?"

00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:11.881
You see, they're so stupidly materialistic
that I went to Boston and the television people

00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:14.380
asked Me, "How many Rolls Royces You have?"

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.349
I said, "I don't have any."

00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:17.750
They said, "We are not interested.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.670
You are not in the business."

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:29.540
This is what is now the mind of people in
the West who have grown up.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:34.049
But even the children, today they want this,
tomorrow they want that.

00:36:34.049 --> 00:36:45.850
All the time there's a competition for materialistic
things, asking for this, asking for that.

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:56.109
Just imagine what a race will be there after
some years when there'll be just people who'll

00:36:56.109 --> 00:36:59.660
be only worried about collecting things and
buying things.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:04.960
I mean, buyers and sellers, nothing else.

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:14.680
So you have to be very careful with your children
that you do not pamper them, do not get too

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.680
much worried about them, do not keep them
on materialistic level.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.680
Find out.

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.849
If they are going on a materialistic level,
bring them down.

00:37:24.849 --> 00:37:33.539
It's very simple to do that and one has to
work it out because we have to save our children

00:37:33.539 --> 00:37:35.010
and their innocence.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:46.180
Now for the other Sahaja Yogis who are grown
up and who are very mature, they are very

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.460
innocent, I must say.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.549
I must admit that.

00:37:48.549 --> 00:37:52.580
They're very innocent compared to the society
that is around.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:53.820
No doubt.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:38:01.460
One has to really admire the way they have
become so innocent, the way they're understanding

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.820
this divine music and all.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.180
That's really creditable.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:17.809
But still, this innocence, if it is not spread,
if this innocence doesn't work out, then it

00:38:17.809 --> 00:38:21.569
will rust, will not grow.

00:38:21.569 --> 00:38:22.569
Your I.Q.

00:38:22.569 --> 00:38:25.450
will be less than the others, I can tell you
this much.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:29.550
They are growing in materialism all right.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:34.940
Their I.Q. is growing in materialisms, but
your I.Q.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:40.450
will not grow unless and until you spread
this innocence around.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:45.019
Now you know how to do it.

00:38:45.019 --> 00:38:50.049
It is the power of Kundalini with the help
of Shri Ganesh.

00:38:50.049 --> 00:38:51.690
He helps you at every chakra.

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:58.230
I have written that He's the Vice Chancellor
of every university, where He has to stamp.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:07.109
He's at every point, but you have to understand
that this has to spread.

00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:08.520
It has to become collective.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.660
It has to flow.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:22.109
So to become that, what should we do ourselves?

00:39:22.109 --> 00:39:29.620
That we should try to organize programs.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:35.360
While people will be enamored by your innocence,
no doubt.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.790
They'll be surprised how are you so innocent.

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:42.730
How can you be so nice in these modern times?

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.030
No doubt about it.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:51.800
But, in that doing, that so, try to be innocent
yourself.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.800
Should not be cunning.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.430
You should not be smart.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:40:01.089
You should not try to show that you are very
brilliant or anything; because the ego might,

00:40:01.089 --> 00:40:05.920
in between, come and try to put ideas into
your head.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:13.099
It's better to show that you're innocent and
to be innocent inside.

00:40:13.099 --> 00:40:22.990
The whole inner being can be really charged
with the energy of Shri Ganesh, no doubt,

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:26.200
and the outer life becomes innocent.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.619
Becomes innocent.

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:32.480
I mean, I don't know banking.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:33.480
I don't know money.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:41.349
I am quite bad at everything - all right,
at worldly things, but I'm not cunning.

00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:51.200
I'm not, sort of, smart, as you can see; but
still things are working out because of the

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:54.940
inner power that one has.

00:40:54.940 --> 00:41:00.800
So depend on your inner power and manifest
it outside.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:08.260
Inner being, which is Ganesha, is the same
in all of us.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.849
The whole system is the same in all of us.

00:41:11.849 --> 00:41:14.330
Chakras are the same in all of us.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:26.530
Only thing, we have to keep our innocence
absolutely free of all this worldly nonsense

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.369
like a fashion, this, that.

00:41:30.369 --> 00:41:36.970
Immediately, you'll find that your being will
manifest.

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:39.290
Being will manifest.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.470
Now just think of simple thing like that.

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:51.519
I am an Indian, I mean, and nobody knows Me;
but whenever I have My lecture, I have at

00:41:51.519 --> 00:41:53.339
least five to six thousand people.

00:41:53.339 --> 00:41:54.339
How?

00:41:54.339 --> 00:41:58.480
How do they come to My lecture like that?

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:00.700
Anywhere in the whole world.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.700
Minimum.

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.269
Sometimes you're much more.

00:42:04.269 --> 00:42:09.390
What's so special?

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:16.779
So when handling the people, we are Sahaja
Yogis, we are saints, we have to talk to them

00:42:16.779 --> 00:42:18.269
like saints.

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:29.930
We have to behave like saints, and they should
in no way feel that we are cunning or we are

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:33.579
interested in something else.

00:42:33.579 --> 00:42:43.089
So, once you start doing that, flowing your
innocence, you know, all the Gods and Goddesses

00:42:43.089 --> 00:42:44.490
will help.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:55.549
Your creativity will be thousand times more
than normal.

00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:58.140
Everybody has to think how we are going to
spread it.

00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.630
Like I was happy to know that in America,
of all the places, they have got hold of these

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:06.119
senators - very good idea.

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:10.410
Let us see if it works out.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:21.460
So we have to find out all the ways and methods
and all the styles which will behoove a saint,

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:27.880
not a politician or - these days, of course,
all the sports people are heroes.

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:33.229
I mean, if you want to become a hero, you
become a sportsman.

00:43:33.229 --> 00:43:41.289
Not like that, but like a saint; and saintliness
is respected, whatever may be the situation,

00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:47.290
whatever may be the situation, whosoever may
be facing you.

00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:53.960
Recently when I was in Kiev, the leaders wife
told Me that, "Mother, we had that old car

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:59.329
of Yours, which we sold and we got so much
money that we could buy a new car.

00:43:59.329 --> 00:44:04.240
Then we went to the factory to buy the new
car."

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.240
And they bought it.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.710
So outside the factory there's a mafia.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:14.329
Nowadays I think the Sicilians have reached
there.

00:44:14.329 --> 00:44:21.560
So the mafia was standing outside and they
said, "You have to pay so much money to us."

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.720
In thousands.

00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:24.850
So they said, "We have no money."

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.980
"Why?

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.840
What do you do?"

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.910
This was his wife.

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.640
She said, "We meditate."

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.640
"Really.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.640
So you have no money."

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:34.640
"No."

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:35.640
"What about those children?"

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.640
"They also meditate."

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.809
She's so innocently she was talking to them.

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:42.490
They said that, "We saw their faces melting
down."

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:45.700
They said, "All right.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:46.700
Go."

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:51.490
They forgot that they were suppose to get
money out of them.

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:56.030
Or they take the car, they confiscate the
car or take the money.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:57.230
They said, "All right.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:58.230
Go."

00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:59.230
They told Me this story.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.269
So your simplicity always helps.

00:45:02.269 --> 00:45:09.789
Your innocence always helps you, and it has
such an impact, such an impact.

00:45:09.789 --> 00:45:19.740
I tell you that a personality, what we call
in Sanskrit is a "vigraha."

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:24.650
Vigraha means a personality which has a coefficience.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:36.559
The person who is innocent has such a great
coefficience that he can charm anybody.

00:45:36.559 --> 00:45:45.010
But, first and foremost thing that we have
to be innocent, not to so much worry about

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:59.250
money, not to count everything, not to worry
about food; but this is not to be done with

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:00.760
deliberations, but innocence.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:05.570
Where you sleep, what you do is not important
to a saint.

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:16.550
It lives the way one has to live because his
nourishing point is innocence, and he doesn't

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:17.910
get angry.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.180
He doesn't shout at people.

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.180
Nothing.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:50:23.690
Of course, at bhoots it may be that he has
to shout like Christ did; but otherwise, he

00:50:23.690 --> 00:51:50.809
is 

00:51:50.809 --> 00:52:17.059
a 

00:52:17.059 --> 00:52:50.570
very peaceful, joyous, happy, humorous person.

00:52:50.570 --> 00:58:52.539
So today, at this puja, I would bless you
with all 

00:58:52.539 --> 01:22:01.430
the qualities of Shri Ganesha, except for
His anger.

01:22:01.430 --> 01:48:11.420
May God bless you.
