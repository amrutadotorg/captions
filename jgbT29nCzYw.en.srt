1
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:23,680
Today we have gathered here

2
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,810
to do the Puja to Sadashiva.

3
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:43,890
The One, which is reflected within us,
is the Shiva,

4
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,204
which is the pure Spirit.

5
00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:57,590
This pure Spirit within us is
the reflection

6
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,503
of God Almighty, Sadashiva.

7
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:15,864
It’s like the sun that falls in the water

8
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:21,905
and gives a clear reflection.

9
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,370
Or else it falls on the stone,

10
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:31,995
it doesn’t give any reflection at all.

11
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,925
If you have, say, the mirror,

12
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:41,259
the sun will not only fall on the mirror

13
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:48,187
but will reflect back its light.

14
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:53,019
In the same way in the human beings

15
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:05,369
the reflection of God Almighty is expressed
in the way your personality is.

16
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:11,980
If your personality is clean and clear,
innocent,

17
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:17,370
then the reflection could be like a mirror.

18
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:28,200
Thus the saintly people, they reflect God
Almighty in the proper manner,

19
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:36,886
in the sense that their own identification
with wrong things is no more.

20
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:41,068
When there is no such identification

21
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:48,930
and when a person is absolutely the pure
Spirit,

22
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:55,280
then the reflection of God reflects into
others.

23
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,933
Luckily you all have got your Self
Realization.

24
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:05,839
That means the reflection of God Almighty

25
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,459
is already working into your attention.

26
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:21,825
The attention is enlightened by the power
of the Spirit.

27
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:29,899
The power of the Spirit is that it is
a reflection.

28
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:37,076
That means the reflection is never
identified

29
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:44,867
with the mirror or with the water.

30
00:06:45,902 --> 00:06:51,177
It is there till the sun shines,

31
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,310
and when there is no sun there is
no reflection.

32
00:06:57,803 --> 00:07:10,291
So when you are in Sahaja Yoga you have
cleansed out yourself.

33
00:07:10,492 --> 00:07:14,190
Your Kundalini has also cleansed you,

34
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,690
and now you are pure personalities.

35
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:25,080
That’s why this reflection is clearer and
clearer,

36
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:29,049
and people see it; see it on your face;

37
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,379
they see it in your body; they see it
in your work;

38
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,740
in your behaviour; in everywhere.

39
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:45,960
It is difficult for people to really
believe in themselves,

40
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,110
that they could be the reflection of God
Almighty.

41
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:57,957
They have some sort of a, complexes about
themselves I think,

42
00:07:58,158 --> 00:08:05,041
that they cannot understand how they have
suddenly become

43
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:09,029
the reflection of God Almighty,

44
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:18,313
but they have a capacity; and they can
become

45
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:22,440
the reflection of God Almighty,

46
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,200
for which they have to have faith
in themselves,

47
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,719
faith in their ascent, to believe that we
have become that.

48
00:08:35,407 --> 00:08:41,867
The confidence in Sahaja Yoga is very
important.

49
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:47,329
Without the full confidence you cannot
achieve your ascent.

50
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,868
That you have seen even in my lectures,

51
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:55,300
I have to tell them that we have to have
full self-confidence.

52
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,469
But confidence doesn’t mean by any chance
your ego, your aggressiveness.

53
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,649
If you are confident, you are least
aggressive.

54
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,774
There is a story, a Chinese story, very
interesting one:

55
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:24,728
that one king wanted his cocks to win in
the race they have about the cock-fighting.

56
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,484
So somebody said that “There is a saint,
if you can take your cocks to him,

57
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:37,580
he’ll make them so strong that they will
definitely win this race.”

58
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,809
So he took his two cocks and gave it to
the saint and he said,

59
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:48,958
“I want you to give them all the strength
to fight this race.”

60
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:55,595
After one month the king came and took
these two cocks,

61
00:09:55,796 --> 00:10:00,886
and put them in the arena where there were
many other cocks also.

62
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:09,838
So the cocks started fighting and attacking
these two cocks,

63
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:12,405
but these two cocks were just standing

64
00:10:12,606 --> 00:10:18,440
very patiently, absolutely calm and quiet.

65
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,416
Any kind of attack they were just looking
at it as a fun,

66
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:29,820
and all the cocks got tired and they ran
away from the arena,

67
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:34,958
and that’s how these two cocks won
the game.

68
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,760
This is what it is for us to understand,

69
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,382
that for a person who is detached he can
never be attacked.

70
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:49,335
We are attacked by so many we have.

71
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:55,199
Firstly our family, then our country,

72
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,000
then our religion, then all kinds of thing,
racialism.

73
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,599
All these identifications really make
us weak,

74
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,225
because they attack us all the time

75
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:11,380
and put confusion into the minds of Sahaja
Yogis, I have seen.

76
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,000
The reason is, you must have confidence
in Sahaja Yoga

77
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,850
and confidence in yourself, that you are
on the right path

78
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,290
and that you are now saved, and nobody
can attack you

79
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,569
because you have the complete protection
of the Divine.

80
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,933
People may follow any religion,

81
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:35,230
they may follow any guru, they may follow
anything,

82
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,380
but they have fear all the time that
we’ll be attacked,

83
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,732
and they’re afraid to say things, which
they should say.

84
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:49,309
They have no discretion even to know what
is to be said.

85
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:57,710
With the proper understanding that you are
the pure Spirit,

86
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:02,283
if you believe in that then you’ll be
surprised

87
00:12:02,484 --> 00:12:09,634
that you will be very confident about what
you are doing.

88
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:17,395
In that way we can say that we have also
another great advantage –

89
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:21,492
is that we are in the collective.

90
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:28,060
We can find out in the collective how are
we behaving.

91
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,379
What is the reaction in the collective?

92
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,598
In the collective it’s a person who is very
subtle,

93
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,586
he need not talk too much, he need not
say much.

94
00:12:41,787 --> 00:12:45,190
He could stand like the cocks I told you
about,

95
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,714
but his depth can be felt.

96
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:52,350
You can feel a person of that caliber,

97
00:12:52,551 --> 00:12:57,499
that he’s such a deep person, that he
doesn’t want to aggress.

98
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,180
He feels protected within himself.

99
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:03,870
So this protection we have to feel,

100
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,804
not mentally but within ourselves,

101
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:11,280
and once you have that gravity,

102
00:13:11,486 --> 00:13:16,439
that feeling, nobody can attack you.

103
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:24,263
The attacking person himself is insecure;
or maybe he is ill-bred;

104
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:28,720
maybe he is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

105
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:36,666
So you have to just have a kind of
a gracious view

106
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:42,631
about the person. Like Shiva was.

107
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:45,536
We should say Sadashiva’s character
is known,

108
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:50,459
that He is the one who used to forgive
anyone.

109
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,790
Anybody who did penance like standing
on their heads

110
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,524
or standing on one foot or not eating their
food or all kinds of penances,

111
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:06,359
He used to be so disgusted that He would
say: “Alright, what do you want? Take it!”

112
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:10,651
And He also gave blessings to manyrakshasas

113
00:14:10,852 --> 00:14:14,846
as you have heard and so many rakshasas
were blessed by Him,

114
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:20,580
because He got fed up with their penances.

115
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:32,060
There were so many stories about Sadashiva
giving a blessing to people.

116
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,120
Even to Ravana, which is a very interesting
story about Ravana,

117
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,119
that Ravana did lots of penance. I don’t
know what he did,

118
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,721
how much he must have starved with his
ten heads and what …

119
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:53,490
I mean, if one mouth is there you feel so
hungry – with ten mouths!

120
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,968
I don’t know what he must have done

121
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:01,709
to do that kind of a penance that Shiva
just got fed up, you see.

122
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,969
His compassion is so great He thought:

123
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,725
“Let this man have whatever he likes.”

124
00:15:06,926 --> 00:15:11,510
So Ravana went to Shiva and Shiva said:
“What do you want?

125
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:17,447
Why are you doing all this to yourself?”
So he said that

126
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:20,836
“I want to have a blessing”. He said:
“What blessing?”

127
00:15:21,037 --> 00:15:24,710
“First you promise that whatever I ask for,
you will give me.”

128
00:15:24,911 --> 00:15:27,880
He said: “Of course. If it is in my power,
I’ll give”.

129
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,280
It’s a very interesting story.

130
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,270
So he said: “I want to have your wife”.

131
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,420
Because he knew His wife is Adi Shakti,

132
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,759
and if he gets the Adi Shakti as a partner
with him,

133
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,285
he can do wonders.

134
00:15:47,486 --> 00:15:56,294
So he asked that: “I should get your wife
as my partner.”

135
00:15:58,056 --> 00:16:02,479
Now, it was very difficult, you see, for
Him to take such a decision

136
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:09,010
to give in to this devil, but in compassion
He did it.

137
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:12,452
And all these events you see really show

138
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:18,952
that how His compassion works out things.

139
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:28,024
As a result it was decided that

140
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:35,190
His wife Parvati had to go with this
horrible fellow.

141
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:43,875
But Parvati’s sister (brother) was Shri
Vishnu, that is Shri Krishna,

142
00:16:44,076 --> 00:16:50,158
and He said to Himself that: “I can’t allow

143
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:53,830
my sister to go with this devil. I must do
something about it.”

144
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,938
The most mischievous one is Shri Krishna.
So what He did was

145
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:06,220
to make him feel like going for the
bathroom.

146
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,076
So he felt shy, he put the lady on one side

147
00:17:09,277 --> 00:17:16,755
and he went to the bathroom. Now Shiva
had warned him that:

148
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:20,040
“You’d better be careful, because this
Mother Earth

149
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:25,117
is the mother of this lady, and never put
Her on the Mother Earth.

150
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:29,790
You must carry Him (Her) all the time
on your back.”

151
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:34,480
So when he reached a certain point

152
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,433
this Shri Krishna created a mischief,

153
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:41,969
and he felt like going.

154
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,186
So he put Her down. As soon as he put
Her down,

155
00:17:44,387 --> 00:17:50,030
the Mother Earth sucked Her in and he
didn’t know what to do.

156
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,108
Second time again he tried.

157
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:57,334
And he again went to Shiva and he said:

158
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:02,130
“See now, this is what you have promised,
and this is what he is doing.”

159
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:07,159
So He said: “I had warned you that Her
brother is a very mischievous fellow

160
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,410
and He’ll somehow or other manage,
so you’d better be careful.

161
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:15,164
This time you don’t listen to him.

162
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:19,094
Don’t put Her on the ground, whatever
it may be.”

163
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:26,963
So this time he did another try,

164
00:18:27,164 --> 00:18:31,278
we can say, and carried Her on his back.

165
00:18:31,479 --> 00:18:33,745
Suddenly he found a little boy.

166
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:39,010
It was Shri Krishna himself laughing
at him.

167
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,600
He said: “Why are you laughing at me?”

168
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,020
“Oh my, why are you carrying this old woman
on your back?

169
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,900
She has no ornaments.” He said: “She’s
the Goddess.”

170
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,360
He said: “No. She has no ornaments.
She’s wearing nothing.

171
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,170
How can She be the Goddess?”

172
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,420
So you see in India that’s a … proverb
we use.

173
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,189
Somebody, some lady who has, who lives
without any ornaments or anything,

174
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:08,240
that she’s like the Lanka Parvati.

175
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,030
So he was carrying Her to Lanka. And
when he looked at Her up,

176
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,753
he saw a very old woman without any teeth
you know, laughing at him.

177
00:19:19,954 --> 00:19:26,436
He got such a fright he threw Her away.
That’s Mahamaya!

178
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:31,620
Then the third situation was, he went
and told that:

179
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:35,551
“You’d better tell your wife that She’s not
to listen to anybody,

180
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,800
and you’d better see that you give me
your wife itself.”

181
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,540
He said: “Alright, She’ll be born in Lanka
and you can marry Her.”

182
00:19:42,741 --> 00:19:48,540
Her name was Mandodari. Now the great
story goes on like that.

183
00:19:48,741 --> 00:19:53,654
But this Mandodari was the great worshipper
of Vishnu,

184
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:59,500
and at the time when Rama came, you see,
to kill him.

185
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,260
All this was organised by Mandodari
Herself.

186
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:10,384
She knows, knew that if Shri Rama
kills Ravana

187
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:15,702
he will get his liberation from these ideas
about women;

188
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:21,139
the way he was running after Sita and doing
all these things.

189
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,013
She actually wanted that something should
happen that he should take another birth,

190
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:35,269
and he should get rid of these notions
of looking after beautiful women,

191
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:39,029
and the way he brought Sitaji there.

192
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,164
She was against it completely, but he
would not listen.

193
00:20:42,365 --> 00:20:49,363
So the war took place, and in the war he
was killed by Shri Rama.

194
00:20:49,564 --> 00:21:03,628
All this episode came because of the
unlimited compassion of Shri Shiva.

195
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:11,285
His compassion is to look at, looks very
illogical sometimes,

196
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:14,024
but there’s a big logic behind it.

197
00:21:14,225 --> 00:21:18,265
The logic is that whatever He does

198
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:28,461
brings forth a kind of a solution of the
problem.

199
00:21:28,945 --> 00:21:34,945
For example, there was a war on, and
the war was going on,

200
00:21:35,154 --> 00:21:43,899
and that time there was a problem because
there was one horrible devil

201
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,539
who was given blessings by Shri Shiva

202
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,273
that: “Nobody can kill you.”

203
00:21:53,474 --> 00:22:01,172
He had given also blessings - as they call
varadan - to another saint,

204
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:06,415
who said: “I want to sleep now and nobody
should disturb me.”

205
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,880
So he was given a blessing:

206
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:11,871
“Anybody who disturbs you in your sleep,

207
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:18,411
you can just look at that person and that
will be, he’ll be reduced to ashes.”

208
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:24,456
So these two now, when the war started,
you see, Shri Krishna thought,

209
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:33,320
“Best thing is to kill this devil with
the same blessings

210
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,932
that the saint has got.” So He played

211
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:43,437
and He started running away from
the battlefield;

212
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:49,325
and that’s why He’s called

213
00:22:51,338 --> 00:22:55,914
as a warrior who has ran out of the field.

214
00:22:56,115 --> 00:23:02,740
Ranchordas – the one who runs away
out of the field of battle.

215
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:09,027
And when He was running He was wearing
a shawl, Shri Krishna.

216
00:23:09,228 --> 00:23:12,199
He just stealthily entered into the cave

217
00:23:12,415 --> 00:23:18,987
and there’s another saint was sleeping and
put His shawl on top of that.

218
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:23,439
So when He put the shawl on top of him,

219
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:31,582
the gentleman, I mean, the devil who was
following Him, the satanic fellow,

220
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:38,152
he reached that place and saw the same
shawl

221
00:23:38,353 --> 00:23:41,470
and he said: “Oh, so now you are tired

222
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,943
and now you are sleeping here. I’ll put
you right!”

223
00:23:45,144 --> 00:23:51,302
Without realising who was sleeping and he
pulled the shawl.

224
00:23:51,503 --> 00:23:57,026
And here the sleeping saint gets up and
looks at him,

225
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,828
and they say with his third eye he burnt.

226
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:05,037
So the solution came in. So the whole
play is like this,

227
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:11,871
of three forces going on, just to show
ultimately the truth prevails.

228
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:19,070
First is the, Shiva’s compassion, His
goodness, to one side.

229
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:27,620
Then the play of Shri Krishna or say
Shri Vishnu of neutralizing it;

230
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:41,062
and the third is the play of Brahma who
creates things and who produces things.

231
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:44,803
All these three forces are playing,

232
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:50,543
just to create an atmosphere for all of us
to feel

233
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:55,846
that there is something else is to be done
to our human awareness.

234
00:24:56,047 --> 00:25:04,590
All they have evolved within us this desire
to seek the truth.

235
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:09,608
Now on one side Shiva is extremely
compassionate,

236
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:14,422
very kind even to asuras, the rakshasas.

237
00:25:14,623 --> 00:25:20,716
But on the other side He can be extremely
cruel.

238
00:25:20,917 --> 00:25:24,747
He can destroy the whole universe.

239
00:25:24,948 --> 00:25:28,667
If the people are so decadent,

240
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:35,804
if the people do not take to spirituality,

241
00:25:36,948 --> 00:25:41,029
if their innocence is completely lost,

242
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,886
if they do not get detached from all these
wrong identifications

243
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,267
which are creating problems in this world,

244
00:25:50,468 --> 00:25:53,646
He destroys the whole universe.

245
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:59,326
So as it is He is the spectator of the work
of Adi Shakti.

246
00:25:59,527 --> 00:26:02,770
He allows Her to do all this work,

247
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:07,511
to create human beings, to give them
Realization, do all this.

248
00:26:07,712 --> 00:26:12,005
But in case He finds Her children,

249
00:26:12,206 --> 00:26:18,408
people who have been saved by Her,
are misbehaving

250
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:22,741
or insulting or in any way destroying
Her work,

251
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:29,822
He might get into a temper by which He can
destroy the whole universe.

252
00:26:30,385 --> 00:26:34,314
But I don’t think now there’s any chance
for Him to do that,

253
00:26:34,515 --> 00:26:38,384
because we have now Sahaja Yogis all over.

254
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:42,960
But what I find amongst Sahaja Yogis
is this

255
00:26:43,161 --> 00:26:47,519
that some of the Sahaja Yogis grow
very fast.

256
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:55,179
Steadily, strongly, they achieve their
principle of Shiva Tattwa.

257
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:03,130
The first achievement shows that from
inside they start getting detached.

258
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,137
Now detachment is not mental. It’s not
mental.

259
00:27:07,338 --> 00:27:12,990
It is not that we have to take to some sort
of a sanyasa

260
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,616
or we have to go to Himalayas, give up
our families and all that.

261
00:27:17,817 --> 00:27:25,950
But the detachment is within oneself. When
that detachment starts working,

262
00:27:26,151 --> 00:27:33,823
the first sign is that we become joyous,
we become happy.

263
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:38,821
Now if you ask anyone: “Why are you
unhappy?”,

264
00:27:39,022 --> 00:27:45,711
he’ll talk about his wife, maybe his house,
maybe his children,

265
00:27:45,912 --> 00:27:53,376
maybe his country, maybe society, whatever
it is.

266
00:27:53,577 --> 00:28:00,357
So he gets absolutely upset, or maybe
very unhappy

267
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,856
to see things happening around him.

268
00:28:05,057 --> 00:28:13,140
Now he is a realized soul this unhappiness
is not going to help him.

269
00:28:13,432 --> 00:28:19,443
What is needed is now to know that you
can correct

270
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:27,552
all these ills of the society, of the
family, of the whole country,

271
00:28:27,753 --> 00:28:32,550
by transforming others, not by feeling bad.

272
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:39,711
But while doing that, the main thing that
you should have is a complete detachment.

273
00:28:39,912 --> 00:28:43,960
I was amazed when I first started Sahaja
Yoga

274
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:49,547
how people told me about their own
countrymen, country fellows,

275
00:28:49,748 --> 00:28:54,295
I was amazed how they told me about their
own religions,

276
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:57,715
how wrong things they are doing.

277
00:28:57,916 --> 00:29:00,685
I didn’t know so much as they told me,

278
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:04,483
and I thought that this is a detachment
that has come

279
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:08,538
that they can see clearly what’s wrong;

280
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:16,750
what’s wrong with my society, with
my people,

281
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:22,963
with my relations, with my family, with my
country, with the whole world.

282
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:30,635
But is only possible if you are not
identified through any one of them,

283
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:33,586
otherwise you will never see the defects.

284
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:35,842
You’ll never see what’s wrong with
that person.

285
00:29:36,043 --> 00:29:39,711
You can never even see the chakras, which
are catching.

286
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:45,255
So the first thing that should happen
is detachment.

287
00:29:45,456 --> 00:29:49,693
Now how to achieve detachment is the point.

288
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:53,357
Many people ask me, “Mother, how do you
get detached?”

289
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:56,825
Because I am not attached you see, so I’m
already detached.

290
00:29:57,026 --> 00:29:59,548
I don’t know how to do that way.

291
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:05,766
But for you people I would say,
to understand yourself

292
00:30:05,967 --> 00:30:08,389
you should introspect.

293
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:14,307
Try to find out to what thing am I
attached. Why am I miserable?

294
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:18,367
For whom am I worried? Why should I worry?

295
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:22,841
Some things you see which were never
very important,

296
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:25,668
they become very important to certain
Sahaja Yogis.

297
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:31,510
For example I was told that in the West,
people don’t care

298
00:30:34,036 --> 00:30:39,389
so much for their children. But as soon
as they get Realization

299
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:46,509
they just get attached to their children,
like as if with some glue.

300
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,630
They cannot think what is good for
their children.

301
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:57,065
Everything about children they think is
their primary duty.

302
00:30:57,265 --> 00:31:03,032
The other day I was surprised when they
told me that it’s the parents

303
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:10,200
who want to come after the Birthday Puja.
I was shocked.

304
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,171
I mean, just on the way is Birthday Puja.

305
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:19,180
Why should the parents want to come
after that?

306
00:31:19,697 --> 00:31:22,329
When I told Yogi he said: “Mother,

307
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,629
we’ll be very happy if they are here, and
they should be.

308
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,592
Because it will help the children, it will
help the parents.”

309
00:31:28,793 --> 00:31:32,264
But the whole now attention goes
to the children,

310
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:36,790
that “We must leave the children there
and we must look after them”,

311
00:31:36,991 --> 00:31:40,351
and that’s the only thing.

312
00:31:42,787 --> 00:31:48,600
So the attachment to children will
definitely make you do such things,

313
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,430
which are not good, not good for you.

314
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:58,784
So this new attachment starts after Sahaja
Yoga, I’ve seen, very common.

315
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:02,486
Then another attachment is, say, to your
family.

316
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:06,855
Normally there are no such things
in the West.

317
00:32:07,056 --> 00:32:09,309
People are not attached to their family
much, you see.

318
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,798
They drink, they do all kinds of things.

319
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:17,640
Suddenly they become self-realized

320
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,845
and it’s like a boomerang, they come back
to the family

321
00:32:24,046 --> 00:32:28,440
It is so attached to the family, attached
to the house,

322
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,763
attached to everything. I just can’t
understand.

323
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:37,510
If you are becoming the pure Spirit then
you are detached,

324
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:43,459
because you are just a reflection, but
the reflection of God Almighty.

325
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,795
So all these identifications drop out.

326
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:50,499
Now one may say, “How? How to drop it out?”

327
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,169
I’ve never dropped them,

328
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,590
but still I can suggest certain things,
which you can try.

329
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,390
First is meditation.

330
00:32:59,698 --> 00:33:03,186
You should discover about yourself, what’s
wrong with you,

331
00:33:03,387 --> 00:33:07,719
which side is catching, is it right or left
side.

332
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,180
With meditation you can find out.

333
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:14,099
Are you attached to money, are you
attached to business,

334
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,476
are you attached to your family, are you
attached to your country

335
00:33:19,677 --> 00:33:25,510
in a way which is not Sahaj

336
00:33:25,711 --> 00:33:28,815
or to your culture, which is not Sahaj?

337
00:33:29,016 --> 00:33:36,006
Then try to get rid of this attachment
by meditation.

338
00:33:36,207 --> 00:33:40,343
You know how to get rid of the right
and the left.

339
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:44,473
This attachment will show on your
fingertips,

340
00:33:44,674 --> 00:33:49,432
and you have to see for yourself what
centres you are catching,

341
00:33:49,633 --> 00:33:55,969
in which way are you in trouble. And then
you can clarify it

342
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:01,820
very simply by taking a very simple Sahaj
treatment.

343
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:08,191
I think here we fail, that once we get
attached to something,

344
00:34:08,392 --> 00:34:10,605
we don’t even think we are getting
attached.

345
00:34:10,806 --> 00:34:12,489
We think we are doing very great thing

346
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,270
because now we love this person, love
that person,

347
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:20,600
Shiva’s qualities, the compassion part.

348
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:24,731
You start getting attached to people.

349
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:29,277
That is no compassion. That is no
compassion of any kind.

350
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:33,137
To be attached to any such things is
no compassion,

351
00:34:33,342 --> 00:34:37,381
and you cannot have compassion of Shiva,

352
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:40,908
though people think it is the Shiva’s
compassion that is working within us.

353
00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:52,278
It’s not, because that compassion is very
pure.

354
00:34:52,497 --> 00:34:56,772
It is like as I’ve told you many a times,
it’s like the sap in the tree

355
00:34:56,973 --> 00:35:02,603
which rises and goes to various parts
of the tree,

356
00:35:02,804 --> 00:35:09,362
and then either it evaporates or goes down
into Mother Earth. It’s not attached.

357
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:16,807
If it gets attached to one flower or to one
leaf or to one fruit,

358
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:24,081
then the whole tree will suffer and also
the flower will disappear.

359
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:33,087
So this kind of attachment to a particular
thing, to a particular idea is not proper.

360
00:35:33,288 --> 00:35:41,342
In Sahaja Yoga I’ve found people are very
adaptable and understand

361
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:46,395
what they should do, but the main thing
is meditation.

362
00:35:46,596 --> 00:35:49,960
In meditating on your heart, on the Shiva
Tattwa,

363
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:54,490
on the principle of Shiva, you can
definitely detach,

364
00:35:54,691 --> 00:36:01,602
and then the joy will be the maximum,
joy will be the maximum.

365
00:36:01,803 --> 00:36:05,153
I’ve seen people have interest in, say,
food

366
00:36:05,354 --> 00:36:12,343
or in clothes or in house, anything.

367
00:36:12,544 --> 00:36:18,467
You can have interest, you should have
interest, but in that interest

368
00:36:18,668 --> 00:36:24,610
there should be enlightenment, that you
cannot get attached to it.

369
00:36:25,015 --> 00:36:32,062
Some people, say, who are say, from South
India, they don’t like North Indian food.

370
00:36:32,263 --> 00:36:35,789
Those who are from North India don’t like
South Indian.

371
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,039
It’s a big problem. I asked the people
in Indian Airlines:

372
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,359
“Why don’t you have some standard food?”

373
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,314
He said: “What is the standard food
of India? Tell me.”

374
00:36:45,515 --> 00:36:47,384
But it was a question.

375
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:50,995
Indians are very particular about
the taste and food.

376
00:36:51,196 --> 00:36:56,335
So it’s a fact we don’t have any standard
food in India.

377
00:36:56,536 --> 00:36:59,715
But in the same way, we can say in so many
other ways

378
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:09,284
that in the West people run after things,
which are not necessary.

379
00:37:09,485 --> 00:37:14,226
They do things just out of fashion, or
I don’t know,

380
00:37:14,427 --> 00:37:17,474
because their personality is not grown-up.

381
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:24,523
If your personality is grown up then you
see everything, everything

382
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:28,360
from an angle, which is much higher
than others,

383
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:31,108
and you don’t get dissolved with others.

384
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:37,193
What you know is much higher, much greater
and much more joy giving.

385
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:41,974
Now these attachments, people think that
it’s very joy giving.

386
00:37:42,175 --> 00:37:49,213
If you get a child and if you have say,
a wife and everything, are joy giving.

387
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:51,143
It’s a very wrong idea.

388
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:55,870
The joy comes from your own source
of your Spirit.

389
00:37:56,071 --> 00:38:00,940
Whether your husband is good, whether
your children are good or bad,

390
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:05,222
whatever they are, they cannot give you
joy.

391
00:38:05,423 --> 00:38:08,853
It’s only you can enjoy yourself,

392
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:15,406
and this is why one becomes very forgiving.

393
00:38:15,607 --> 00:38:21,287
When nobody can harm you, then whom are
you going to be angry with?

394
00:38:21,488 --> 00:38:24,430
That is another great quality of Sadashiva,

395
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,824
is that He is extremely forgiving.

396
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:32,958
He goes up to a point, till He destroys
the whole work of Adi Shakti.

397
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:36,533
But otherwise He is very, very forgiving,

398
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:40,720
and He also is very balanced about it.

399
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:44,732
Once the Adi Shakti got very angry with
the whole world,

400
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:49,348
was so decadent and all that and She
started destroying everything.

401
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:52,590
So He put a little child under Her feet,

402
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:56,093
and such a big tongue came out with
such a shock,

403
00:38:56,294 --> 00:38:59,780
She stopped Her destruction.

404
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:04,164
So His ways are such that a person

405
00:39:04,365 --> 00:39:10,587
who is to develop the Shiva principle
within himself

406
00:39:10,788 --> 00:39:14,254
should be extremely forgiving.

407
00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:18,957
I know there are people who are very cruel
and who are very tortur.

408
00:39:19,158 --> 00:39:23,908
If you cannot bear it, alright, finish
it off.

409
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:27,823
I’ll stand by you there; but if you can
bear it

410
00:39:28,024 --> 00:39:34,371
is better to bear, and undergo this
experience of bearing it,

411
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:39,981
because it’s not difficult to bear than
to get out of it.

412
00:39:40,182 --> 00:39:42,625
For example, a lady came to me, and
she said:

413
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:45,724
“I’m going to divorce my husband.”
I said: “Why?”

414
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,783
“Because he comes home very late and
I get very little of him.”

415
00:39:49,984 --> 00:39:56,358
But I said, “When you divorce you’ll not
get him at all! What’s the logic?

416
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,581
At least now you see him, whatever it is,
whenever, whatever the time is there.

417
00:40:00,782 --> 00:40:06,199
But this is no solution. If you divorce him
you’ll never see him.

418
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,233
So what’s the use of such a divorce?”

419
00:40:09,434 --> 00:40:15,573
So many things like that can be understood
once you are a detached person,

420
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:18,744
that you are not to be attached
to anything.

421
00:40:18,945 --> 00:40:24,442
Now who can aggress you if you are not
attached to anyone?

422
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:28,685
Nobody can. Only thing when you feel

423
00:40:28,886 --> 00:40:32,645
that you have to protest, you should,
but with detachment.

424
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:40,418
In protest also is important to absolutely
to have a complete detachment.

425
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:47,768
Now the main problem before us today
is something else:

426
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:53,719
is that we all have to ascend,

427
00:40:54,393 --> 00:41:02,379
and ascend with equal strength.

428
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:11,990
There’s a story about some birds who were
caught in a net,

429
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:17,394
so they decided that we should get out
of this net, and they tried.

430
00:41:17,595 --> 00:41:23,023
Everybody tried to get out, but nobody
individually could work it out.

431
00:41:23,224 --> 00:41:27,975
So they all decided to fly together, “One,
two, three, go!”,

432
00:41:28,176 --> 00:41:31,964
and they took all that net with them.

433
00:41:32,165 --> 00:41:42,749
And they said, then they requested the rats
that “Please come and cut our net.”

434
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,073
And they were freed.

435
00:41:45,274 --> 00:41:49,229
So if it can happen between the rats
and the birds,

436
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:51,732
why not between us?

437
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:56,886
So in collectivity, you’ll be amazed,

438
00:41:57,087 --> 00:42:02,249
in the collectivity how we could be helpful
and joyous with each other.

439
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:05,103
Now say something is wrong

440
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:09,664
with your mother, father, sisters,
somebody, doesn’t matter.

441
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:14,590
After all you have the ocean of joy here
with the collectivity,

442
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:16,766
and your problems can be solved

443
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:21,190
if collectively, if you want to solve
your problem.

444
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:24,647
So we have to depend on the collectivity,

445
00:42:24,848 --> 00:42:28,254
very much to be one with the collective.

446
00:42:28,455 --> 00:42:33,728
I feel once you jump into the sea of Sahaj,

447
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:36,755
the joy itself draws you together.

448
00:42:36,956 --> 00:42:40,426
Meeting each other is such a joyous thing!

449
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:43,237
We have had so many experiences of that,

450
00:42:43,438 --> 00:42:48,275
of Sahaja Yogis who have told me how
happy they were to find

451
00:42:48,476 --> 00:42:54,740
Sahaja Yogis somewhere out of the blue,
and how they felt happy.

452
00:42:54,941 --> 00:43:04,833
So this tie between the Sahaja Yogis is
really the most joyous channel,

453
00:43:05,034 --> 00:43:12,149
and that is what is the source we should
say, of our becoming one together.

454
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:16,355
Once you start enjoying each other…

455
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:21,367
I’ve told you once a story of a great
poet in India

456
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:26,258
whose name was Namdeva, who was a tailor.

457
00:43:26,459 --> 00:43:34,165
And there was another one who was
a… potter.

458
00:43:34,366 --> 00:43:37,294
Sometimes I miss out in English words.

459
00:43:37,495 --> 00:43:47,387
This potter was another poet and he was
called as Gorakumbhar.

460
00:43:47,657 --> 00:43:50,706
So when Namdeva went to meet him –

461
00:43:50,907 --> 00:43:54,138
a saint only feels like meeting a saint –

462
00:43:54,339 --> 00:44:02,521
looked at him, and he just stood back and
then he said a beautiful couplet.

463
00:44:02,722 --> 00:44:09,297
He says that: “I came here to see the form,
formless Chaitanya,

464
00:44:09,498 --> 00:44:14,494
but here the Chaitanya is in the form” -

465
00:44:14,725 --> 00:44:17,568
‘Nirgunachah beti allo sagunashi’ -

466
00:44:17,768 --> 00:44:22,649
“I came to see the formless, to see
the vibrations,

467
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:27,427
but here the, it is in the form that
I see it.”

468
00:44:27,628 --> 00:44:31,862
Only a saint can say this to another saint.

469
00:44:32,063 --> 00:44:35,909
This kind of appreciation, this subtle
appreciation

470
00:44:36,110 --> 00:44:42,323
is only possible between the two saints,
or between the many.

471
00:44:42,524 --> 00:44:46,202
They don’t see he was kneading the clay;

472
00:44:46,403 --> 00:44:52,225
he was wearing a dirty dhoti, doing
that work.

473
00:44:52,426 --> 00:44:54,416
He never saw all these things.

474
00:44:54,617 --> 00:44:57,682
He never saw his body, face or anything,

475
00:44:57,883 --> 00:45:05,336
but he saw that the Divinity personified
in him.

476
00:45:06,796 --> 00:45:11,849
This sensitivity of feeling for other
Sahaja Yogis

477
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:16,686
should really develop within you.

478
00:45:16,887 --> 00:45:22,287
Then you won’t care for nonsensical,
superficial things,

479
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:28,184
and this is one of the great principles
of Shiva.

480
00:45:28,385 --> 00:45:33,855
He doesn’t bother. Now see, His hair
are all matted up,

481
00:45:34,056 --> 00:45:40,093
He sits on a fast-moving bull with both
the legs like that

482
00:45:40,294 --> 00:45:44,487
going for His wedding. Can you imagine?

483
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:48,302
And all His friends, all His followers

484
00:45:48,511 --> 00:45:53,535
are somebody has only one eye, another
has only one hand,

485
00:45:53,736 --> 00:45:56,474
one is bent like that,

486
00:45:56,675 --> 00:46:04,738
because for Him the outside personality
doesn’t matter.

487
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:10,524
What matters is the spirituality. Whether
you have one eye

488
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:14,789
or whether you have a crooked body makes
no difference to Him.

489
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:20,237
To Him all of them are His own people,

490
00:46:20,438 --> 00:46:26,038
because nothing that is superficial
attracts His attention,

491
00:46:26,244 --> 00:46:30,127
but the divinity in a person.

492
00:46:30,328 --> 00:46:35,382
We have so many ways of understanding
His principle,

493
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:39,138
because He is all-pervading.

494
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:46,735
If you feel compassion for someone
it works. It definitely works.

495
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:57,841
Recently there was a case of some sort
of a, incurable disease in Mexico.

496
00:46:58,042 --> 00:46:59,855
And the lady, who was Mexican,

497
00:47:00,055 --> 00:47:03,235
who was working in the UN, she’s still
working in UN,

498
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:09,401
she wrote to me two letters, that “Mother,
I’m going to lose my son

499
00:47:09,602 --> 00:47:15,908
because he has this horrible disease.”
I mean, just she wrote to me.

500
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:20,365
I just felt such compassion for her,

501
00:47:20,566 --> 00:47:25,348
because she wrote a letter, which brought
tears to my eyes.

502
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:31,013
And imagine, those tears have cured
that boy!

503
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:39,513
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: “It has fallen.”
Then Hindi)

504
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:47,131
Has cured that boy completely,

505
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:54,624
and she wrote me a letter of, thanking
and all.

506
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:59,940
I was amazed, because my compassion
is not mental.

507
00:48:00,141 --> 00:48:06,001
It just works, it’s just there, just flows
and works it out.

508
00:48:06,202 --> 00:48:10,037
In the same way you can also become that.

509
00:48:10,238 --> 00:48:13,120
I want you to have all my powers.

510
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:16,472
But first is the compassion.

511
00:48:16,673 --> 00:48:19,991
And a Sahaja Yogi cannot ill-treat another
person, anyone.

512
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:23,789
Whether he’s a Sahaja Yogi or not a Sahaja
Yogi, that’s not important.

513
00:48:23,997 --> 00:48:29,622
But nobody can aggress other Sahaja Yogis.

514
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:39,203
If you say even he’s a non Sahaja Yogi,
Sahaja Yogis should never aggress.

515
00:48:39,404 --> 00:48:45,941
That’s not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja
Yogi is different.

516
00:48:46,142 --> 00:48:48,960
Like the other day somebody said, I said:
“You are very hot-tempered.”

517
00:48:49,161 --> 00:48:53,210
“Yes, yes, I am, when somebody provokes
me.”

518
00:48:53,411 --> 00:48:56,492
I said: “Everybody when he’s provoked
only gets angry.

519
00:48:56,693 --> 00:49:03,658
Only the mad are such who do not get angry
when they are provoked, you see.

520
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:07,884
So if you get angry when you are provoked,
is nothing so great.

521
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:11,166
Everybody gets angry like that, when you
are provoked.

522
00:49:11,367 --> 00:49:14,717
But if you say that if you are not provoked
then you will not get angry,

523
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:17,514
that sort of a state is very different.”

524
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:26,806
So what I find, that in the whole
atmosphere of today

525
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:36,350
in the modern times, there’s a big struggle
going on,

526
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:41,007
which is not Shiva’s culture.

527
00:49:41,236 --> 00:49:49,537
Shiva’s culture is the, I should say,
the Sahaj culture.

528
00:49:49,842 --> 00:49:57,567
If you are Sahaja Yogis you should have
compassion in you,

529
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:02,879
understanding of others’ feelings;

530
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:08,736
and also should have readiness to look
after

531
00:50:08,937 --> 00:50:12,859
not only Sahaja Yogis, also non Sahaja
Yogis,

532
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:17,109
then your compassion will become effective.

533
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:25,519
Now as you know today, the biggest problem
of today’s civilisation

534
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,638
is the Western culture has gone to dogs.

535
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,104
They are going, I mean when you read
the newspaper

536
00:50:32,304 --> 00:50:35,128
you are shocked the way things are
happening.

537
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:40,403
I don’t know how many will realise it
before their destruction.

538
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:42,922
It’s really self-destructing.

539
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:51,221
On one side this is the self-indulgent and
permissive society, which is working.

540
00:50:51,422 --> 00:50:59,867
Now on the other side I find the Islamic
culture is trying to oppose it.

541
00:51:00,068 --> 00:51:03,834
That’s correct, their trying to oppose it
is correct,

542
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:07,822
but the way they are opposing is creating
problems.

543
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,658
If you oppress somebody – “Don’t do this,
don’t do that” –

544
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:15,503
then they’ll do it much more. I’ll give
an example,

545
00:51:15,704 --> 00:51:23,036
that if you go into the north of India
the culture is more Islamic,

546
00:51:23,237 --> 00:51:28,853
and the people are very licentious and
all the time looking at women.

547
00:51:29,054 --> 00:51:34,093
Not all, but many; though they are say,
they are Hindus or they say this and that,

548
00:51:34,294 --> 00:51:37,566
but still they have all these bad habits,

549
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:41,127
which have come from Islamic suppression.

550
00:51:41,328 --> 00:51:45,012
When a woman is completely covered

551
00:51:45,213 --> 00:51:49,031
and nobody can see her, they become much
more curious.

552
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:54,046
I have some people who came to Bombay
and somebody was travelling with me,

553
00:51:54,247 --> 00:51:56,509
and he was looking at every woman
on the street.

554
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:00,999
I tell, I said: “Your neck will break now,
the way you are going on.”

555
00:52:01,214 --> 00:52:03,158
But is a common practice there.

556
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,456
Not only that, but this curiosity goes
too far

557
00:52:06,657 --> 00:52:09,527
and people can become extremely immoral,

558
00:52:09,728 --> 00:52:12,460
just like we are in the West.

559
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:21,256
So the suppression of your desires is
also wrong.

560
00:52:21,457 --> 00:52:27,190
Also this culture, which outwardly
suppresses,

561
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:31,671
but inwardly people are very immoral.

562
00:52:31,872 --> 00:52:37,114
Once I was travelling from Riyadh to London
and I went off to sleep.

563
00:52:37,315 --> 00:52:41,574
When I got up, I saw some other people
sitting there all very nicely dressed up

564
00:52:41,775 --> 00:52:47,239
with short skirts and women with –
all the bow ties and this and that -

565
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,906
so I asked the air hostess, I said: “Did we
stop somewhere?”

566
00:52:50,107 --> 00:52:51,923
She said: “No, no, we have been going
directly.”

567
00:52:52,132 --> 00:52:55,682
I said: “Then who are these people?”
“Same.”

568
00:52:55,883 --> 00:52:58,621
“They are so much changed!” I mean,
I was surprised

569
00:52:58,822 --> 00:53:02,331
that they were wearing such long, these
chador and all that,

570
00:53:02,532 --> 00:53:06,692
and now here they are with all these
funny dresses.

571
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:10,633
I couldn’t understand. So that’s what
happens.

572
00:53:10,834 --> 00:53:17,134
The curiosity created by suppression also
is not helpful.

573
00:53:17,335 --> 00:53:19,277
In Sahaja Yoga there’s no question
of suppression.

574
00:53:19,478 --> 00:53:23,401
You become innocent, just become innocent.

575
00:53:23,602 --> 00:53:26,277
That is the principle of Shiva.

576
00:53:26,478 --> 00:53:31,758
This Sahaj culture is in the centre. It has
neither too much of licentiousness

577
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:35,809
nor too much of suppression, but it is
in the centre,

578
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:42,006
which is the, Shiva’s greatest principle is
to be innocent.

579
00:53:42,207 --> 00:53:46,325
And this innocence just shines in you,
I have seen it.

580
00:53:46,526 --> 00:53:49,380
You people, whatever you might have
done before,

581
00:53:49,581 --> 00:53:54,481
but I see you are so pure. You don’t have
these stupid ideas

582
00:53:54,682 --> 00:54:01,379
of behaving in a manner that is so Western.

583
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,756
Also, so many Islamic people I’ve seen who
have come to Sahaja Yoga,

584
00:54:05,957 --> 00:54:09,967
have become very, very Sahaj

585
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:14,217
and are leading a very good life.

586
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:19,764
We have some Iranians who sent me
letters of their confessions,

587
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:23,567
and I was shocked. I never read them
because it was too much for me.

588
00:54:23,768 --> 00:54:28,795
And now I find them to be the most moral
people that we have.

589
00:54:28,996 --> 00:54:34,056
So going to one extreme is wrong, or
to another is wrong.

590
00:54:34,257 --> 00:54:39,428
But to be in the centre, in the Sahaj is
the best way to understand

591
00:54:39,629 --> 00:54:44,406
what is so important for life is morality.

592
00:54:44,607 --> 00:54:47,720
And that comes from your innocence.

593
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:55,436
And that is the quality of, of course,
Shri Ganesha, who is the Son of Shiva,

594
00:54:55,637 --> 00:55:04,359
but is emitted through the innocence
of Shri Shiva.

595
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:12,803
Now I think in next lecture of Shiva
I’ll talk about innocence to you,

596
00:55:13,004 --> 00:55:18,062
but for this one you have to understand
the detachment,

597
00:55:18,263 --> 00:55:21,701
the detachment that should evolve within.

598
00:55:21,902 --> 00:55:24,577
It cannot be forced, but through meditation

599
00:55:24,778 --> 00:55:30,726
you can develop that detachment within you,
which will be really joy giving.

600
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:34,126
So many qualities of Shiva can be
described,

601
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:40,282
and I think in so many lectures I have told
you about Him.

602
00:55:40,483 --> 00:55:47,459
I have to just say that you should have
also collective meditation

603
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:51,946
in your ashrams. Will be a good idea

604
00:55:52,147 --> 00:55:56,041
if you can try collective meditation,
will be nice.

605
00:55:56,242 --> 00:55:58,787
But you don’t have to give vibrations
to anyone.

606
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:02,283
You don’t have to look after the chakras
of others.

607
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,436
You just bother, yourself, what’s wrong
with you.

608
00:56:05,637 --> 00:56:10,776
And now whatever is the solution for your
ascent you should do it,

609
00:56:10,977 --> 00:56:18,508
because the responsibility of the whole
world rests on Sahaja Yogis.

610
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:23,322
This you know, that there’s no way out
without Sahaja Yoga.

611
00:56:23,523 --> 00:56:28,595
To save humanity from all kinds
of problems,

612
00:56:28,796 --> 00:56:31,831
Sahaja Yoga has come on this earth.

613
00:56:32,032 --> 00:56:37,684
So it is your responsibility to keep
yourself in proper shape,

614
00:56:37,885 --> 00:56:39,974
as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

615
00:56:40,175 --> 00:56:43,468
get rid of your left and get rid of your
right,

616
00:56:43,669 --> 00:56:49,483
and then to spread Sahaja Yoga, not
by bombastic words

617
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:53,901
or aggressiveness, but with love and
compassion.

618
00:56:54,102 --> 00:56:57,581
I’m sure we have done a lot, we have
achieved a lot,

619
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:01,449
but there are still some points here
and there

620
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,731
which is a very unpleasant task for me
to correct them.

621
00:57:05,932 --> 00:57:10,451
But whatever it is I have to say that
it’s working,

622
00:57:10,652 --> 00:57:14,535
and everybody should look at themselves

623
00:57:14,736 --> 00:57:17,641
and feel happy from where they have
come here,

624
00:57:17,842 --> 00:57:19,770
and how far we have to go.

625
00:57:19,971 --> 00:57:22,693
May God bless you all.
