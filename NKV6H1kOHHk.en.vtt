02:14.720 --> 02:20.840
Today, you are all here to worship your Guru.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.480
It is

02:34.800 --> 02:42.400
a common practice, specially in India,

02:42.800 --> 02:45.760
that you must

02:48.160 --> 02:51.000
worship your guru,

02:51.320 --> 02:55.120
and the guru has to

02:55.320 --> 03:02.600
fully be in control of his disciples.

03:07.040 --> 03:11.120
Guru Principle is

03:11.320 --> 03:15.680
extremely strict,

03:18.160 --> 03:23.880
and the strictness made many people

03:24.720 --> 03:32.080
could not conform to the ideals of a disciple.

03:33.120 --> 03:39.320
In those days the guru had to be,

03:43.080 --> 03:48.120
absolutely, the authority

03:48.360 --> 03:52.480
and it was

03:56.800 --> 04:00.960
the guru who would decide

04:01.200 --> 04:04.080
which disciples he’ll have.

04:04.680 --> 04:12.520
And one had to go into great tapasya,

04:12.720 --> 04:18.640
to great penances, to even become a disciple.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.560
And this hardship

04:25.760 --> 04:30.480
was the only way the guru used to judge.

04:33.840 --> 04:37.880
Gurus would always live in jungles

04:38.080 --> 04:42.440
and they would select their disciples, very few, very, very few

04:42.840 --> 04:48.000
and they had to go and beg food

04:49.720 --> 04:53.960
from the neighboring villages,

04:54.240 --> 04:58.560
and cook food for their guru with their own hands,

04:58.760 --> 05:01.760
and feed the guru.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.600
That sort of

05:12.080 --> 05:16.760
guru business is not in Sahaja Yoga.

05:18.280 --> 05:22.880
That basically we must understand

05:23.080 --> 05:28.760
that the difference between those styles

05:28.960 --> 05:32.880
of guruship and

05:34.480 --> 05:38.320
that we have now is this,

05:38.520 --> 05:42.640
that very few individuals

05:42.880 --> 05:48.960
were given the chance to become the guru, very few.

05:49.640 --> 05:55.280
And these few also were selected out of

05:57.520 --> 06:01.400
quite a lot of people and they felt

06:01.600 --> 06:05.760
that they were something really special that they are being selected,

06:05.960 --> 06:12.000
chosen, and that whatever

06:12.760 --> 06:16.800
they will have to go through is all welcome.

06:18.840 --> 06:23.640
With this idea, they became the disciples.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.920
But Sahaja Yoga is a very different thing.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.280
I would say just the opposite.

06:31.960 --> 06:36.080
First of all, your Guru is a Mother

06:36.800 --> 06:40.720
and who suffers from Sandrakaruna.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.640
At the slightest things that happen to you

06:44.840 --> 06:48.520
My eyes get filled with tears.

06:50.200 --> 06:54.040
So as a Mother

06:54.240 --> 06:58.040
to be a Guru is a very difficult thing.

06:58.680 --> 07:05.080
At the same time, for you to achieve heights is also difficult.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.240
Because you get lost

07:10.480 --> 07:17.080
when I love you so much

07:17.400 --> 07:24.040
and in that love you forget sometimes,

07:24.960 --> 07:29.920
that the progress in your being is very slow.

07:32.680 --> 07:36.080
It is important

07:37.240 --> 07:44.160
that in Sahaja Yoga you have to be strict with yourself.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.680
That’s why I said that you have to be your own guru,

07:48.880 --> 07:52.400
which people do not understand what it means.

07:52.920 --> 07:57.920
You have to be your own guru means you have to guide yourself;

07:58.200 --> 08:05.480
you have to treat yourself as your disciple

08:05.680 --> 08:09.800
and you have to trim yourself.

08:11.120 --> 08:17.040
If you do not understand

08:18.600 --> 08:22.920
the responsibility as Sahaja Yogi,

08:23.120 --> 08:27.800
of working it out yourself everything,

08:28.000 --> 08:31.800
you cannot move very fast,

08:32.080 --> 08:34.280
because

08:36.320 --> 08:39.200
it is a different type

08:39.400 --> 08:44.640
of relationship between the Guru and the disciples.

08:46.200 --> 08:50.520
So first I have always said you become your own guru.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.520
So you have to make

08:58.000 --> 09:01.960
a lot of introspection

09:02.160 --> 09:05.600
and fix your ideals.

09:06.240 --> 09:09.720
Before you I am sitting.

09:11.160 --> 09:15.840
You have seen Me how I am.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.880
I can eat anything;

09:19.080 --> 09:23.120
I need not eat at all for days together.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.840
I can sleep anywhere;

09:27.360 --> 09:30.520
I may not sleep at all.

09:30.840 --> 09:36.880
I travel for miles together untiringly.

09:40.200 --> 09:47.000
I have this energy because

09:47.400 --> 09:52.680
I’m a Guru of Myself also.

09:55.240 --> 09:59.400
So the first thing is that there should be lot of introspection,

10:00.600 --> 10:03.720
“What’s wrong with me?” Not wrong with others.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.960
“What’s wrong with me?

10:07.160 --> 10:11.480
Am I seeking the comfort of my body?

10:11.720 --> 10:18.680
The attention, is it on my body or on my spirit?

10:19.160 --> 10:22.160
If so, what am I doing?”

10:22.480 --> 10:25.520
I think best thing is to write it down.

10:27.400 --> 10:31.360
“Can I sleep on the grass?

10:32.040 --> 10:35.960
Can I sit on the stone?”

10:37.440 --> 10:41.240
You have to make this body work.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.440
“Can I sleep anytime I like,

10:44.640 --> 10:47.600
and can I keep awake anytime I like?”

10:50.360 --> 10:53.680
I have seen people doze off.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.400
The reason is this, not that they are bad

10:57.720 --> 11:00.400
or in any way indisciplined people

11:01.000 --> 11:04.720
but because inside they are tired.

11:05.960 --> 11:13.440
If you are tired inside then you feel tired all the time.

11:13.640 --> 11:17.360
You’ll see on the television, if you see people in the West,

11:17.600 --> 11:21.440
they’re always sitting like this.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.400
Because they are so very tired.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.200
Why are they so tired? They don’t work so hard.

11:30.800 --> 11:35.880
So introspect how you behave.

11:37.560 --> 11:40.840
Now when you start introspecting yourself,

11:41.040 --> 11:44.440
you’ll also start introspecting your surroundings

11:44.640 --> 11:48.240
and your styles
and your methods,

11:48.440 --> 11:53.000
and what you are doing to yourself

11:53.200 --> 11:57.200
because of the conditionings of the outside.

11:58.320 --> 12:02.520
Now the conditionings of the outside in the West,

12:02.720 --> 12:05.400
are of a psychological nature.

12:05.640 --> 12:10.600
Indians have other conditionings which are also quite surprising,

12:10.840 --> 12:12.720
or we should say the Western  people,

12:12.920 --> 12:15.160
they must wash their hand ten times,

12:15.360 --> 12:18.840
even if their skin comes out, they’ll go on washing like mad.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.440
They must have a bathroom attached to them all the time.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.560
They must have their baths.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.880
If they don’t have bath they are not comfortable.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.880
They have other conditionings also.

12:31.080 --> 12:34.531
All kinds of stupid conditionings they have

12:34.760 --> 12:38.280
but the conditionings that we have in the West

12:38.480 --> 12:41.240
are more psychological and that’s why

12:41.480 --> 12:45.880
you cannot find out what’s wrong with you.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.200
The physical conditionings are not so dangerous,

12:50.400 --> 12:52.800
you can get over them or you can manage.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.280
But when you have conditioning of your psychology

12:56.520 --> 13:00.480
you cannot understand what’s wrong with you.

13:01.880 --> 13:06.280
Now if you see, if you introspect around,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.960
what you will find is a very subtle thing.

13:11.680 --> 13:16.760
Firstly, that

13:17.480 --> 13:21.840
because of the wars maybe, I don’t know why

13:22.080 --> 13:26.080
but everybody is afraid of everyone.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.680
Specially I think, Freud.

13:30.880 --> 13:35.880
Because of Freud, even the mother is afraid of the child,

13:37.520 --> 13:39.960
and all these things to Indians are absolutely

13:40.160 --> 13:42.520
they can’t understand this.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.160
But, you people know that very well.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.000
They won’t touch anybody;

13:49.200 --> 13:51.880
they won’t hug anyone.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.680
First of all when they used to play football, they used to hug.

13:55.880 --> 14:00.280
But now I see they don’t hug they just touch hands like this.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.880
After sometime I think they may

14:05.120 --> 14:08.280
just do like that or something.

14:08.640 --> 14:13.640
So frightened that nobody, even the children I’ve seen,

14:13.840 --> 14:17.880
are frightened of hugging their parents.

14:18.120 --> 14:22.840
So the expression of love is not there

14:23.320 --> 14:27.920
and when there is no expression there is no love inside

14:28.640 --> 14:33.400
and that’s how it goes on drying you up and drying you up and drying up.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.240
There was a little girl in Sahaja Yoga

14:40.680 --> 14:44.840
and I had some present for that child.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.440
She was quite young, must have been about ten years of age.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.280
So I gave it to one Sahaja yogi, Western Sahaja yogi,

14:51.480 --> 14:54.360
that you go and give it to her and say that I have given.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.840
“No Mother. I won’t give.” I said, “Why?”

14:57.040 --> 15:00.680
“She’ll misunderstand me.” I said, “What will she misunderstand?”

15:00.880 --> 15:04.720
It has gone so much into the heads of people.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.600
And this has created really

15:07.840 --> 15:11.840
the psychological insecurity within you.

15:12.800 --> 15:17.760
From very childhood this insecurity has been working,

15:18.240 --> 15:22.960
and that’s why you are frightened of each other.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.840
Even of your parents, of your brothers, your sisters.

15:27.080 --> 15:31.120
Psychologically you are suffering.

15:32.120 --> 15:34.640
And when first I came to England they used to say

15:34.840 --> 15:37.480
it is the insecurity. I said, “What insecurity?

15:37.680 --> 15:40.880
The whole world is afraid of the Western world.”

15:41.280 --> 15:43.840
And what are they suffering from insecurity?

15:44.040 --> 15:47.200
They have made everybody insecure all over the world.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.680
And why, what are they insecure?

15:49.880 --> 15:52.040
They are insecured within themselves

15:52.240 --> 15:55.480
in their own society, in their own family,

15:55.680 --> 15:58.760
in their own groups.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.960
They are so much frightened of each other.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.080
So the first thing, you should be fearless.

16:11.240 --> 16:15.280
You are a Sahaja Yogi, you are no more immoral,

16:15.960 --> 16:18.120
cannot be immoral.

16:18.320 --> 16:23.080
If all the time if you start thinking that you are immoral,

16:23.480 --> 16:26.560
and if you do something it is immoral,

16:26.760 --> 16:32.040
and that you have to go and do some confession somewhere,

16:32.640 --> 16:36.120
then what is going to happen to you?

16:36.800 --> 16:40.840
What sort of a personality you will have?

16:44.800 --> 16:49.840
We have to change this by changing ourselves.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.520
So among Sahaja yogis there should be

16:53.720 --> 16:57.880
no insecurities but maryadas.

16:58.080 --> 17:03.040
You must know how to respect each others privacy.

17:06.040 --> 17:11.880
The second thing that if you find with the Western mind,

17:12.920 --> 17:16.440
which is a very common thing,

17:17.320 --> 17:22.160
that they are bombarded by criticism.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.920
There are so many critics

17:26.120 --> 17:28.560
that now there are no more artists left.

17:28.760 --> 17:32.680
Only critics are criticizing critics.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.760
All artists are finished.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.160
They are all the time criticized.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.640
Somebody will come in – there’s an education on criticism –

17:41.840 --> 17:45.600
they may not know how to play any instrument,

17:45.840 --> 17:48.320
they may not know how to sing,

17:48.520 --> 17:52.160
but they can criticize all right.

17:52.600 --> 17:57.680
So all the time in your mind, is a way

17:57.920 --> 18:02.680
that you always feel that somebody will criticize if you do this.

18:03.200 --> 18:08.360
All the time the fear is there that somebody will criticize.

18:08.600 --> 18:12.720
So, “Should I say or not?”

18:13.880 --> 18:17.320
As Sahaja yogis, you shouldn’t worry about

18:17.520 --> 18:19.760
these stupid people because they are blind.

18:19.960 --> 18:22.760
And if they want to criticize you, let them criticize.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.800
What does it matter? Makes no difference.

18:29.880 --> 18:33.160
But this you have to build up within yourself.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.040
Now the third is even worse,

18:39.240 --> 18:42.360
which I don’t know if you have noticed or not.

18:42.600 --> 18:48.280
I don’t know how it has gone into the heads of the Western minds

18:50.400 --> 18:53.960
that you must always see

18:54.160 --> 18:56.960
to the other side of the bank,

18:57.160 --> 18:59.920
even if you are standing on this side,

19:00.480 --> 19:02.480
to be fair

19:02.960 --> 19:07.880
and never to say something that you are sure of.

19:08.480 --> 19:13.040
Like you ask anyone, “How are you?” He’ll say …

19:13.840 --> 19:16.040
Always.

19:16.400 --> 19:21.240
Nobody say, will say, “I am perfectly all right,

19:21.840 --> 19:24.840
nothing wrong with me.”

19:25.480 --> 19:27.160
“What’s wrong?”

19:27.400 --> 19:30.640
“Perfectly all right, thank you very much.”

19:32.880 --> 19:35.280
But it is never.

19:35.480 --> 19:40.720
They are not sure of themselves, all the time, is shaking.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.320
And this shaking inside

19:48.520 --> 19:54.880
gives you a personality which can never progress.

19:56.640 --> 20:01.320
Progress comes when you put your step forward,

20:01.840 --> 20:06.760
you put your foot firmly on that point

20:07.400 --> 20:10.520
and then put the second step forward,

20:10.720 --> 20:14.280
like as you climb on a mountain.

20:15.200 --> 20:19.200
But in the first place only if you are still thinking

20:19.560 --> 20:23.240
that it’s half way through,

20:23.440 --> 20:27.400
then how can you go further?

20:28.120 --> 20:33.000
You’ll only move on two steps, this or that or this or that.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.040
This is another very big psychological

20:38.240 --> 20:40.840
deterrent I should call it,

20:41.040 --> 20:45.000
or detrimental thing for your progress.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.800
Now the third thing you have learned

20:50.000 --> 20:52.800
which is also, third or fourth maybe,

20:53.000 --> 20:57.320
that you must argue out yourself.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.600
Like you have a problem,

21:03.240 --> 21:06.320
you’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, this problem I have got.”

21:06.520 --> 21:08.960
This is very common with everyone,

21:09.160 --> 21:11.360
“I have this problem.”

21:13.800 --> 21:17.240
I’ll say, “All right, this is the solution.”

21:18.000 --> 21:21.880
Then you’ll come out, “No, no, no. But in this, this will happen.”

21:22.160 --> 21:25.240
Then You tell another solution,

21:25.600 --> 21:30.840
“No, no, no, no, no Mother, this can't be this way.”

21:31.120 --> 21:33.560
All right, You tell third solution,

21:33.760 --> 21:36.960
“No Mother, in this, this can happen.”

21:37.160 --> 21:40.040
Tell fourth, “This can happen.”

21:41.000 --> 21:44.920
You are standing against yourself all the time.

21:45.120 --> 21:49.840
Then I have to say, “This is your problem, not Mine,

21:50.040 --> 21:54.720
and I am giving you the solutions

21:54.920 --> 21:59.680
and if you want to solve your problem,

21:59.880 --> 22:03.320
better take a positive attitude.”

22:04.840 --> 22:09.000
The brain is this way.

22:09.200 --> 22:13.360
In our Hindi language it’s called “ulti khopdi.”

22:15.160 --> 22:20.000
You are all the time arguing against yourself.

22:20.320 --> 22:23.440
So how can you progress?

22:25.640 --> 22:32.120
This is another great problem of the Western mind

22:32.320 --> 22:36.280
that it doesn’t

22:36.480 --> 22:41.920
try to face any problem as your own,

22:43.120 --> 22:47.040
but go on arguing with yourself like a lawyer.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.080
You see. there are two lawyers:

22:49.280 --> 22:51.920
one yourself, another lawyer – go on arguing.

22:52.440 --> 22:56.040
So is a double personality in the body, being;

22:56.240 --> 22:59.160
is not a single personality.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.160
As I said, it is very, very psychological

23:05.440 --> 23:09.760
that people have to

23:11.320 --> 23:16.680
take to this kind of a turn suddenly,

23:18.160 --> 23:22.560
without understanding how dangerous it is.

23:27.080 --> 23:33.960
With the enlightenment of your brain, this should disappear.

23:34.560 --> 23:39.520
On the contrary in Sahaja Yoga, it’s very dangerous.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.560
Because you say something, you are all Sahaja yogis,

23:44.200 --> 23:47.120
you are connected with the all-pervading power.

23:48.320 --> 23:51.960
Whatever you say gets connected

23:53.520 --> 23:55.680
and it acts.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.120
Is very dangerous

24:01.320 --> 24:06.280
for you people not to realize that you are realized souls,

24:07.280 --> 24:12.480
and not to assume your own powers.

24:13.640 --> 24:19.520
Like you see, I have to say something secretly

24:19.840 --> 24:22.920
then I must put My hand here and then say it

24:23.440 --> 24:26.360
because it is connected to the mains.

24:26.840 --> 24:32.840
But supposing I keep it open like this and say something,

24:33.080 --> 24:37.080
it goes to everyone.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.840
In the same way

24:40.040 --> 24:44.120
whatever the Sahaja yogis say or desire or want,

24:44.320 --> 24:47.160
there are just people sitting there, see here and here,

24:47.360 --> 24:49.400
you have put them there.

24:49.600 --> 24:53.240
They are listening to you all the time.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.880
They are so anxious to do your work,

24:56.080 --> 24:59.120
“All right, you say so, done.”

25:00.120 --> 25:03.920
So whatever you think or whatever you desire

25:04.120 --> 25:08.480
or whatever you say, you have to be extremely careful.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.880
And when, now, I mean, old people, all right,

25:17.080 --> 25:20.720
I can say that very conditioned, they have problems and all,

25:20.920 --> 25:23.680
but the generation that is here, most of them,

25:23.880 --> 25:27.760
are all capable of improving yourself

25:27.960 --> 25:32.560
and making your brain straight

25:32.760 --> 25:36.880
by bringing it backwards to the forward.

25:41.440 --> 25:46.200
This psychological problem you do not say.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.480
The another psychological problem is,

25:50.680 --> 25:53.880
which you do not know, which is very surprising,

25:55.160 --> 25:58.120
that whatever is the

25:59.480 --> 26:02.720
entrepreneur’s ideas

26:02.920 --> 26:06.040
you must act,

26:06.280 --> 26:09.520
because the whole fundamentals of Western life

26:09.720 --> 26:13.240
is to see and to be seen.

26:15.520 --> 26:20.320
So, “Oh that’s the fashion so we should do like that.

26:20.720 --> 26:24.000
This is the fashion so we do like that.”

26:24.440 --> 26:28.800
Like the other day, about a year back,

26:29.000 --> 26:34.120
I went to England and I found all the Sahaja Yoginis having their hair here

26:34.400 --> 26:36.880
I said, “What’s this?”

26:37.560 --> 26:40.560
So I asked an Indian girl, I said, “What is this supposed to be?”

26:40.760 --> 26:43.560
“This is a new fashion.” I said, “What new fashion?”

26:43.760 --> 26:46.920
Called as “ziprya” in Marathi you know, we call it ziprya fashion.

26:47.120 --> 26:50.480
The Maharashtrians can ….

26:50.960 --> 26:54.960
And they all had their hair here you know, like this, all.

26:55.160 --> 26:58.680
I said, “My God, this is Agnya, this they are covering,

26:58.880 --> 27:02.000
their eyes will become squinty.”

27:02.720 --> 27:05.320
But the fashion if it comes,

27:05.520 --> 27:08.680
and the whole fashion is with the hair alone.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.120
Hair I don’t know what.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.920
There’s so much interest in the hair.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.560
And they lose the hair so fast in these countries,

27:17.760 --> 27:21.600
without using the oil, which they should use.

27:21.960 --> 27:24.920
They lose their hair very fast.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.920
Starting from the hair, the Sahasrara.

27:28.120 --> 27:31.600
Then fashion means –

27:31.800 --> 27:33.880
What is this these entrepreneurs,

27:34.080 --> 27:36.200
these stupid people are creating ideas

27:36.400 --> 27:39.320
and there why should we follow?

27:39.600 --> 27:43.640
I don’t say that Sahaja yogis should all look alike, not at all.

27:43.840 --> 27:47.920
You can dress up the way you like; you can live the way you like

27:48.120 --> 27:52.200
but you should not get yourself enslaved by any entrepreneurs.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.600
You are free people now – know that very well.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.400
Know that you are absolutely free

27:58.600 --> 28:04.640
and your freedom is absolutely in the light of your enlightenment.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.960
You can never do wrong.

28:08.520 --> 28:13.360
But first of all, have that confidence within yourself

28:15.640 --> 28:18.200
that whatever you have to do,

28:18.400 --> 28:23.680
you are not going to enslave yourself to entrepreneurs,

28:23.880 --> 28:26.760
what people have to say, how you will look,

28:27.000 --> 28:30.400
how you will appear before.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.800
This is a very important point

28:34.000 --> 28:39.520
that half of the time we are laboring just to look like many others.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.400
It’s very surprising

28:42.600 --> 28:45.360
how these entrepreneurs have befooled the Western people.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.440
In India it won’t work, won’t work –

28:48.640 --> 28:50.960
specially the Indian women.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.560
This “in-between” came, a mini sari,

28:54.760 --> 28:59.440
came up to Bombay for about four-five days, I think, disappeared.

29:00.040 --> 29:04.000
No Indian woman would wear a mini-sari, finished.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.480
Nothing doing.

29:09.480 --> 29:13.960
Any sort of fashion now, comes in India, doesn’t stay

29:14.200 --> 29:17.000
because whatever clothes we have now in India -

29:17.200 --> 29:19.760
is traditionally - has been there,

29:19.960 --> 29:24.280
has been tested and error and trial and error and trial,

29:24.480 --> 29:26.640
and we know now this is the best, now stop it.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.000
At certain age you stop.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.960
This is the style that suits us the best.

29:32.160 --> 29:36.120
But anything goes on and the styles go on changing.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.680
And this is what you have to be very careful to see

29:40.880 --> 29:43.720
that you do not take to stupid things,

29:43.920 --> 29:47.200
which are being created by entrepreneurs,

29:47.400 --> 29:52.320
but to sensible things, which are required for you.

29:53.840 --> 29:57.440
So one of the enslavement I feel, is

29:57.640 --> 30:02.720
that you have to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

30:03.480 --> 30:09.360
But a slavery is very deep and is so psychological;

30:10.160 --> 30:16.240
in so many ways it is extremely hidden

30:18.360 --> 30:22.960
and so subtle that you cannot make it out.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.560
So, in the introspection you find out

30:26.760 --> 30:30.040
what’s gone wrong with you,

30:31.200 --> 30:35.160
how you are made this way.

30:36.360 --> 30:41.400
“What’s wrong in my own personality –

30:41.600 --> 30:46.040
it has come from all the surroundings

30:46.240 --> 30:50.480
and the way people have been putting ideas into my head.”

30:52.120 --> 30:55.400
You should have your own ideas.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.240
You shouldn’t worry what Plato said

30:58.440 --> 31:00.640
and what Socrates said and what this thing said.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.880
What do you think?

31:05.640 --> 31:08.920
After all, you are enlightened people.

31:09.680 --> 31:12.640
But then there is another psychological thing,

31:12.840 --> 31:14.840
which is even the worst.

31:15.320 --> 31:18.680
And that “Mother, if we are very sure,

31:18.880 --> 31:22.000
then we are putting up our ego.”

31:22.280 --> 31:25.320
They are so much afraid of their ego

31:25.520 --> 31:29.200
that as if after some time they’ll take off.

31:29.680 --> 31:34.040
“The ego will bloat so much that we’ll take off.”

31:34.920 --> 31:38.760
This is another fear people have, that if we assert,

31:38.960 --> 31:42.640
“All right this is what I want, this is the right thing to do,

31:42.840 --> 31:47.600
then I’ll get off so I don’t want to say such a thing;

31:47.800 --> 31:50.400
I have an ego.”

31:50.600 --> 31:54.760
So, with Sahaja Yoga also, certain fears have crawled in.

31:55.320 --> 32:00.760
One of them is that “Mother, I should not have any ego.”

32:04.640 --> 32:08.440
Now, what is the problem of ego?

32:09.160 --> 32:13.360
That also surprising despite all fear and everything.

32:14.080 --> 32:17.320
As a reaction to it people have developed

32:17.520 --> 32:23.640
a kind of a protesting character.

32:27.400 --> 32:31.800
But again these entrepreneurs have pampered your ego.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.880
Like, in the morning you ask the child, “What will you have?”

32:36.800 --> 32:38.680
Then child will say, “I’ll have this.”

32:38.880 --> 32:40.960
The mother has to run and get it,

32:41.160 --> 32:43.840
or she must keep everything in the fridge.

32:44.160 --> 32:46.920
In India that’s not the case.

32:47.120 --> 32:51.160
Whatever is cooked in the house, you better have.

32:52.240 --> 32:56.200
If there is no salt, all right without salt, come along.

32:56.560 --> 32:59.160
Otherwise don’t eat, doesn’t matter.

32:59.360 --> 33:02.400
In any case you will eat.

33:04.480 --> 33:07.000
So when the disciplining comes within yourself

33:07.200 --> 33:09.560
and you understand this,

33:09.760 --> 33:13.120
then you do not say, “I desire only this, I desire only this.”

33:13.320 --> 33:16.480
What you desire, you tell yourself:

33:16.720 --> 33:21.560
“All right, you’ll not have it for one month, let’s see.”

33:24.640 --> 33:28.400
Once I must tell you about Myself that

33:29.800 --> 33:33.400
little bit comfort grew upon Me, sometimes, I think.

33:33.640 --> 33:37.680
So, we had, had a transfer,

33:37.920 --> 33:42.320
and My family was not with Me at that time.

33:42.760 --> 33:46.960
We had only one small little bed where My husband slept.

33:47.160 --> 33:51.040
And I slept just on the bare cement on the earth,

33:51.440 --> 33:54.440
and next day I started getting the pain in the body.

33:54.640 --> 33:59.800
I said, “All right.” I slept on the cement for one month.

34:01.160 --> 34:04.880
“On the cement you get pain? All right. Sleep now.

34:05.080 --> 34:08.680
One month,” I said, “I’m going to sleep on the cement.”

34:09.760 --> 34:13.800
Then cement lost its power on Me.

34:14.600 --> 34:19.200
Then, might be the cement might be feeling the pain.

34:20.000 --> 34:26.960
So, that’s what you have to do, is to master your mind.

34:27.600 --> 34:30.120
Now the problem only will come:

34:30.320 --> 34:33.960
"What is the discretion? - This ego will come up Mother.”

34:34.160 --> 34:38.440
Because, your ego, as I said, is developed by reactions,

34:38.640 --> 34:42.040
by protesting against things,

34:42.240 --> 34:47.680
and also by the pampering of the entrepreneurs.

34:48.280 --> 34:51.120
All right, whatever may be the reason,

34:51.320 --> 34:53.880
we are not going to psychoanalyze ourselves.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.960
But the fact is, also we have a ego problem.

34:57.160 --> 34:58.000
Why?

34:58.200 --> 35:02.520
I have already told you that, if a balloon is bloated many a times,

35:02.760 --> 35:05.040
it can easily be bloated.

35:05.240 --> 35:09.920
At the slightest air, it bloats.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.320
And that’s why you are afraid that suddenly

35:12.520 --> 35:15.360
my ego might become so big

35:15.560 --> 35:19.480
that I may be like a balloon in the air, somewhere moving.”

35:23.400 --> 35:28.560
But, how to get rid of this is to know that

35:30.440 --> 35:33.240
you are an enlightened soul.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.960
Respect yourself.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.160
Once you start respecting yourself,

35:43.360 --> 35:49.320
you will not fall into any traps of ego.

35:49.840 --> 35:51.840
Very simple.

35:52.880 --> 35:55.480
Respect yourself.

35:56.960 --> 35:59.400
You have to say,

35:59.600 --> 36:02.760
“I am a Sahaja yogi.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.400
how can I behave like this?

36:08.800 --> 36:12.000
After all, I am a Sahaja yogi.”

36:12.520 --> 36:17.560
A kind of a dignity that develops,

36:19.800 --> 36:23.680
and then you will start feeling shy

36:23.880 --> 36:25.880
of doing something that is stupid,

36:26.080 --> 36:30.760
because ego makes you stupid, that’s the point is, absolutely.

36:30.960 --> 36:36.600
So now, if you develop this respect for yourself,

36:36.800 --> 36:38.880
“I’m a Sahaja yogi,

36:41.000 --> 36:43.160
so I can’t behave like this.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.880
I’m a Sahaja yogi.”

36:46.360 --> 36:50.120
If you say like that to yourself,

36:52.040 --> 36:55.240
then you will be amazed

36:55.440 --> 36:58.880
that the dignity of a Sahaja yogi

36:59.080 --> 37:03.960
will definitely keep you down to earth.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.720
You will not get into the trap of your ego.

37:11.920 --> 37:17.200
So one side is the conditioning, another side is this ego.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.640
Simple thing is ego.

37:22.000 --> 37:25.280
That dignity has to be developed.

37:30.160 --> 37:35.080
You’ll be surprised – among animals there are maryadas.

37:35.440 --> 37:38.600
Like a tiger won’t behave like a snake

37:38.840 --> 37:41.480
and snake won’t behave like a tiger.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.120
So we are now Sahaja yogis.

37:45.320 --> 37:49.160
We are tigers among human beings, we are lions among humans,

37:49.360 --> 37:53.520
the highest; we are the highest human beings.

37:54.600 --> 37:59.600
It’s not necessary to have ten, what you call,

38:00.560 --> 38:04.760
medals on your body to show that you are something great

38:04.960 --> 38:09.840
but you are Sahaja yogis, you are Mahayogis.

38:10.600 --> 38:13.520
So, develop that

38:15.880 --> 38:17.880
respect

38:18.080 --> 38:20.960
and you will be surprised the humility

38:21.200 --> 38:23.400
will immediately came into you,

38:23.600 --> 38:26.520
I mean will walk into you, humility.

38:26.840 --> 38:29.680
I have seen some Sahaja yogis sit like this,

38:29.920 --> 38:32.360
sometimes sit like this,

38:32.560 --> 38:35.800
sometimes they,

38:36.000 --> 38:40.200
one, if the Left Vishuddhi is there, like this,

38:40.720 --> 38:43.520
Right Vishuddhi is there, like this.

38:46.920 --> 38:51.200
But then you see yourself.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.240
Like a bridegroom has to dress up

38:55.440 --> 38:57.760
and he remembers, “I am the bridegroom,

38:57.960 --> 39:01.880
I cannot behave like other younger boys who will be there.

39:02.080 --> 39:07.080
I have to have my own personality.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.520
I am the bridegroom;

39:09.720 --> 39:11.800
I am going for my wedding.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.680
I cannot behave like all my other friends are there.”

39:15.880 --> 39:18.640
You have to behave in a particular manner.

39:18.840 --> 39:20.720
So assume this.

39:20.920 --> 39:25.960
Still we do not know that we are Sahaja yogis.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.720
Once we know we are Sahaja yogis,

39:30.920 --> 39:33.560
that dignity will develop within us,

39:33.760 --> 39:36.680
and with that dignity you’ll be amazed

39:36.880 --> 39:40.680
you’ll also see what is wrong in your own country,

39:40.880 --> 39:43.640
what is indignified.

39:46.960 --> 39:51.720
Now with the whatever has happened in France,

39:52.120 --> 39:56.960
you can find out what’s wrong with French laws.

39:57.400 --> 40:02.480
But French are more interested in drinking and eating

40:02.680 --> 40:05.680
and other things. So they never paid -

40:05.880 --> 40:08.400
“Oh, let it be, what do we care for laws, let it be as it is,

40:08.600 --> 40:10.880
doesn’t matter, who should bother about these things,

40:11.080 --> 40:12.760
is nothing important.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.040
After all, if you can get something to drink .…”

40:16.280 --> 40:19.280
You go to any French village, at seven time,

40:19.480 --> 40:22.840
you cannot meet anyone, even a drunkard.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.960
They are sitting inside and drinking, drinking.

40:26.160 --> 40:29.920
I mean that’s the main religion, main pastime.

40:30.280 --> 40:32.160
Next day with a hangover they come,

40:32.360 --> 40:35.200
so they see everything the other way round.

40:35.400 --> 40:41.000
Like this fellow, these journalist who went to India,

40:41.200 --> 40:43.400
they saw an iron gate

40:43.600 --> 40:47.080
and they thought this was the iron curtain of Hitler.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.720
Everything expanded, you know, so big,

40:49.920 --> 40:53.720
crooked because hangover, you know.

40:54.080 --> 40:59.680
So the whole life in the West like a hangover.

40:59.960 --> 41:03.400
Either they see things too big or too small,

41:03.600 --> 41:07.120
they don’t see things as they are.

41:08.520 --> 41:12.160
Now most of these things are written, which you will read,

41:12.360 --> 41:15.400
the psychology and all those things and the books,

41:15.600 --> 41:18.720
mostly they are drunkards.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.760
If you see their lives, they have been drunkards.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.720
So whatever they have written,

41:24.920 --> 41:28.000
why should we take them so seriously?

41:28.840 --> 41:31.440
Except for very few who were realized souls,

41:31.640 --> 41:33.840
most of them were drunkards.

41:34.040 --> 41:37.680
Like those who wrote about Greek tragedies

41:37.880 --> 41:40.680
must have been really drunkard people

41:40.880 --> 41:43.520
In – they must be taking lot of things

41:43.720 --> 41:46.920
inside and then must be writing something like that.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.160
Because most of the drunkards,

41:50.360 --> 41:56.160
when they write, they say that “Why, why should I live, I must die.”

41:56.920 --> 41:59.120
And like that we too have in India

41:59.360 --> 42:01.880
many people who have written ghazals who always say that

42:02.080 --> 42:03.960
“Why should we live, we should die.”

42:04.160 --> 42:07.320
So if there’s one poet who has said,

42:07.520 --> 42:12.480
“Now you are talking of dying, why don’t you die once for all?”

42:14.840 --> 42:19.080
So, you will realize that

42:19.560 --> 42:21.760
what you will write,

42:21.960 --> 42:26.680
what you will say is higher than all these people.

42:28.320 --> 42:31.760
But Sahaja Yoga has worked so smoothly in you

42:31.960 --> 42:36.040
that you do not know what you are.

42:38.760 --> 42:43.400
Today, on Guru Puja, you are worshiping your Guru.

42:43.840 --> 42:49.840
At the same time I bow to your guru within yourself.

42:54.360 --> 42:58.880
Let your guru come up and show itself.

42:59.920 --> 43:04.840
Specially the kind of a Guru you have –

43:05.040 --> 43:10.360
I am not strict with you, I am very gentle.

43:10.800 --> 43:14.080
Because, as I told you, fundamentally is a different thing

43:14.320 --> 43:19.280
is that it is not for an individual, but it is for the collective.

43:20.080 --> 43:24.600
And if something has to spread collectively,

43:24.800 --> 43:27.760
then you have to understand

43:28.040 --> 43:32.720
that it has to be only love that is going to work it.

43:32.920 --> 43:36.600
There is no other way we can spread Sahaja Yoga

43:36.800 --> 43:41.440
because we cannot be like Hitler giving wrong ideas of hatred.

43:41.640 --> 43:46.160
Either it could be hatred or love.

43:47.240 --> 43:49.880
You teach people we hate this one – fundamentalism,

43:50.080 --> 43:54.160
this, that – you’ll get thousands ready to fight.

43:54.840 --> 43:59.360
You can elevate their baser self and say,

43:59.560 --> 44:01.920
“All right, come along, let us fight.”

44:02.160 --> 44:07.120
Racialism, this, that, anything, even nationalism.

44:07.560 --> 44:09.360
All right, they are people.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.800
But when I say love, is very different.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.360
Try to understand.

44:13.560 --> 44:17.080
And because of our collective work, we have to know

44:17.320 --> 44:23.600
that love is a source of energy

44:23.800 --> 44:27.160
that makes things grow

44:27.600 --> 44:29.800
in a living manner.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.080
It is the energy which is a living energy.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.120
Try to understand now. This is, people don’t understand.

44:36.320 --> 44:39.920
Love doesn’t mean that you hug somebody or do something,

44:40.160 --> 44:44.120
but living energy that understands,

44:45.120 --> 44:47.200
that makes you grow.

44:47.960 --> 44:52.320
I hope you have seen My books, and I hope you have read it.

44:53.480 --> 44:57.360
In that I have described you to you very clearly

44:57.560 --> 45:02.640
what is the living energy within us that works,

45:02.840 --> 45:06.600
and anything that is working. For example see this flower.

45:06.800 --> 45:10.760
Now, I cannot order this one to go straight.

45:10.960 --> 45:13.880
It’s moving in its own way – let it be.

45:14.120 --> 45:18.160
It looks nice because no flower should look like another flower.

45:18.440 --> 45:21.680
Living energy never creates the same thing exactly than another.

45:21.880 --> 45:24.400
Only plastics can be done.

45:24.600 --> 45:30.240
Now, when it is growing, it is growing in its own way.

45:30.440 --> 45:34.360
So whatever is built in within you, which is a living energy,

45:34.560 --> 45:39.680
built in, but living energy, and a living thing that works –

45:39.880 --> 45:42.760
it blossoms by itself.

45:42.960 --> 45:47.920
The water of pure love is to be given.

45:50.280 --> 45:57.320
In pure love what you see in another person, as a guru,

45:58.000 --> 46:04.520
“What’s the matter with myself

46:04.760 --> 46:09.880
where it is obstructing me to go further.”

46:10.680 --> 46:14.240
In another person, as a guru, what you see

46:15.480 --> 46:20.800
is how to handle this man, with love,

46:21.000 --> 46:25.040
so that he comes closer to reality.

46:27.200 --> 46:29.840
Is a very gentle process

46:30.040 --> 46:32.960
is very loving process,

46:33.160 --> 46:38.040
and nothing like really enjoying your love.

46:38.320 --> 46:43.360
Just to know that I love so many people itself is so great.

46:44.760 --> 46:48.720
And you too see feel that “I love so many.”

46:49.360 --> 46:53.000
But it should be samadrishti – means:

46:53.200 --> 46:56.240
With the same eyes you should see everyone.

46:56.440 --> 46:59.560
You see everybody with the same eyes, isn’t it?

46:59.760 --> 47:02.880
Only two eyes are there.

47:05.800 --> 47:11.880
But, you see everyone with the same eyes – they are different.

47:12.560 --> 47:15.960
All right, you see them as different.

47:16.880 --> 47:20.240
But you do not … your eyes do not discriminate.

47:20.440 --> 47:24.680
Your eyes do not see somebody black, somebody white,

47:25.520 --> 47:27.040
somebody blue.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.800
They see what they are.

47:31.960 --> 47:36.520
When you start seeing with samadrishti, means the same eyes,

47:37.120 --> 47:39.440
same sight,

47:39.800 --> 47:43.680
not to change your ideas.

47:43.920 --> 47:50.760
Because, what happens that your own mind twists it,

47:51.080 --> 47:55.880
and you start seeing somebody as different, somebody as different.

47:56.640 --> 47:59.520
Now, with the eyes I see the fan.

47:59.720 --> 48:04.720
But supposing My mind is off, I might see as a human being.

48:06.880 --> 48:09.080
So if you are a sane person,

48:09.320 --> 48:13.040
then you will see everyone as they are.

48:13.240 --> 48:15.840
This is samadrishti is that

48:16.040 --> 48:19.680
you have the same eyes for everyone.

48:19.960 --> 48:24.560
Do not get twisted, so that you cannot have:

48:24.760 --> 48:27.160
somebody is your special friend,

48:27.360 --> 48:30.720
somebody is number two friend, somebody as number ten friend

48:30.920 --> 48:33.760
and some as your enemy.

48:33.960 --> 48:38.760
Once you start looking at things like that,

48:40.080 --> 48:45.200
everything will get into proper shapes.

48:47.560 --> 48:50.440
Otherwise, one can go crazy.

48:51.880 --> 48:55.720
Also, it should be samyak.

48:55.920 --> 48:59.520
Samyak means “integrated”.

49:01.560 --> 49:04.200
There should be an integrated knowledge.

49:04.400 --> 49:06.240
Like the eyes when they see,

49:06.440 --> 49:09.360
they see where you are sitting, where you are,

49:09.600 --> 49:12.240
where is this person, where is that person,

49:12.440 --> 49:14.880
what is the relationship.

49:15.680 --> 49:19.000
So the knowledge about others

49:19.200 --> 49:22.040
is in relationships with each other.

49:23.600 --> 49:27.840
Now supposing there’s a gentleman who has a child,

49:28.040 --> 49:32.320
and there’s a problem between that gentleman and the child.

49:32.880 --> 49:34.760
To approach that person,

49:34.960 --> 49:37.160
you must know that he has a child;

49:37.880 --> 49:44.280
not to just make him separated from others, singularizing.

49:44.480 --> 49:49.840
You take somebody, say, he is from, say from England

49:50.080 --> 49:52.360
or he is from Italy.

49:52.560 --> 49:56.080
Then try to understand him

49:56.280 --> 49:59.680
that he is from that particular background

49:59.880 --> 50:04.800
and that background is around him, so he is like that.

50:05.440 --> 50:08.880
If you can have this kind of a full knowledge of others,

50:09.080 --> 50:13.800
there will be no problems, no quarreling, nothing.

50:16.040 --> 50:19.440
Otherwise there is a conflict all the time

50:19.680 --> 50:22.760
and that’s how one feels very tired.

50:25.480 --> 50:29.840
Eyes do not react; eyes just see;

50:30.640 --> 50:33.120
whatever is there, they just see.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.640
Eyes never react,

50:35.840 --> 50:38.200
but the mind reacts.

50:38.400 --> 50:42.320
And this reaction is the one which is responsible

50:42.800 --> 50:46.760
for spoiling your attitude towards people.

50:47.320 --> 50:49.400
So now,

50:52.160 --> 50:54.680
you should have a witness state.

50:54.880 --> 50:58.200
As Gyaneshwara said, “Niranjan pahane. –

50:58.400 --> 51:00.640
Niranjan pahane”

51:00.840 --> 51:04.920
To see somebody without any reaction.

51:05.840 --> 51:10.720
Just to see and you’ll know everything about that person,

51:10.920 --> 51:14.040
as soon as you see that person.

51:14.360 --> 51:15.680
"Niranjan pahane”

51:15.880 --> 51:17.680
Because, as long as your brain is there

51:17.880 --> 51:20.120
you do not see that person as he is.

51:20.400 --> 51:23.480
But as soon as you see that person,

51:23.680 --> 51:27.000
you just know what it is.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.760
And then, immediately you will know

51:31.960 --> 51:35.280
his chakras, his kundalini, everything you’ll penetrate.

51:35.520 --> 51:39.240
But your mind, which is loaded with nonsense,

51:39.440 --> 51:42.200
will not allow you to go to that level.

51:43.440 --> 51:48.240
So the niranjan pahane, the one where you just see something,

51:49.080 --> 51:53.480
that kind of a eye we have to develop it.

51:54.920 --> 52:00.560
So, with that a detachment starts,

52:00.760 --> 52:05.000
automatically you do not criticize anybody

52:05.240 --> 52:08.320
because your mind is like this against that person;

52:08.800 --> 52:11.800
you do not love somebody because your mind thinks this way;

52:12.000 --> 52:13.520
you too cannot form groups;

52:13.720 --> 52:18.760
you cannot have some people who are dear to you, some are not.

52:22.880 --> 52:28.000
Sometimes, if I do not smile at some people

52:28.200 --> 52:30.600
then they grumble and say,

52:30.800 --> 52:33.080
“This time Mother didn’t smile at me.”

52:33.280 --> 52:36.200
I mean, I cannot keep all the time a smile, you see.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.840
You must also think of My muscles.

52:45.960 --> 52:50.200
All the time how can I keep My smile on, you know?

52:50.400 --> 52:53.120
But there are people who feel very bad that

52:53.320 --> 52:55.640
“You see, this time Mother didn’t smile.”

52:55.840 --> 52:58.880
So I have to go on smiling all the time at every one.

52:59.120 --> 53:00.800
I try.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.520
So the

53:15.720 --> 53:18.120
attitude towards others

53:18.320 --> 53:22.480
has to be with niranjan

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
attitude, because it’s a collective work.

53:31.280 --> 53:33.360
It’s not strict;

53:33.560 --> 53:37.200
it is not in any way clamping anything

53:37.400 --> 53:40.240
because it’s a living work,

53:40.440 --> 53:43.560
absolutely it’s living, we cannot.

53:43.760 --> 53:49.600
But it is definitely the work, which

53:52.520 --> 53:56.440
creates harmony, love,

53:56.640 --> 54:00.680
affection, feeling of oneness.

54:01.120 --> 54:04.360
Imagine, to think about someone

54:04.560 --> 54:09.320
who is not kind to you or he’s … is a horrible thing.

54:09.520 --> 54:14.480
Better think how nice you could be to that person.

54:17.480 --> 54:20.280
So the attitude should be that

54:20.480 --> 54:24.360
how nice I am going to be with that person, you know.

54:26.680 --> 54:29.360
See, somebody is angry with you,

54:30.400 --> 54:33.160
is easy to fight, “Come along. You are angry, I am angry.”

54:33.360 --> 54:35.640
No. Go and just tickle.

54:36.240 --> 54:38.840
Simple thing like that,

54:39.040 --> 54:41.040
and enjoy.

54:41.280 --> 54:44.520
Because you cannot enjoy hatred;

54:45.360 --> 54:47.880
you cannot enjoy rivalry;

54:48.080 --> 54:52.400
you cannot enjoy separatedness.

54:52.600 --> 54:57.120
Like this hand has to enjoy this hand,

54:58.640 --> 55:02.480
in the same way you have to enjoy each other.

55:02.680 --> 55:06.840
If you cannot enjoy then you have lost the point,

55:07.600 --> 55:10.160
lost the point.

55:15.000 --> 55:19.560
So, in the collective progress we have to know that we cannot

55:21.680 --> 55:24.280
progress if we have no sense of collectivity,

55:24.480 --> 55:27.720
that we are part and parcel of one person.

55:30.160 --> 55:34.160
If I pull My one ear, it’s not that My ear will come out

55:34.360 --> 55:37.800
but it will give pain to the whole body.

55:38.000 --> 55:41.560
That’s why I say pull both is better.

55:45.560 --> 55:50.080
And when you start, you see, seeing this way yourself,

55:50.280 --> 55:55.720
then you’ll be amazed a kind of a sweet humor about yourself develops.

55:56.440 --> 56:02.360
And you really become a very interesting, magnetic personality,

56:05.680 --> 56:10.200
and a very enjoyable person, extremely enjoyable.

56:10.640 --> 56:13.600
Everybody will seek your company.

56:14.120 --> 56:19.960
This is what is the sign of your Guru Principle being enlightened.

56:20.440 --> 56:23.720
Of course, they have said that you should get detachment;

56:23.920 --> 56:27.600
you should not have any attachment to this and that and that and that.

56:27.800 --> 56:29.760
This is all talking.

56:29.960 --> 56:33.600
But actually, only introspection

56:34.400 --> 56:38.440
and assumption

56:38.640 --> 56:42.000
or, we can say,

56:42.240 --> 56:45.640
the knowledge of your own depth,

56:45.840 --> 56:48.920
itself, will give you that feeling.

56:51.120 --> 56:56.200
If you have that knowledge that I am a Sahaja Yogi,

56:57.200 --> 57:02.480
and my depth of divinity is so great.

57:05.200 --> 57:09.080
That itself will be more than sufficient

57:09.280 --> 57:15.120
for you to exist as the topmost guru.

57:16.520 --> 57:19.160
Actually, I am no more a Guru, I was never a Guru –

57:19.360 --> 57:22.360
I am a Mother; I am hopeless Guru.

57:22.640 --> 57:27.200
Because, a Guru who cannot be strict is useless,

57:27.640 --> 57:30.760
and I have to prepare Myself to say things, you know.

57:30.960 --> 57:34.240
If there’s problem between two people,

57:34.520 --> 57:36.800
and then if there’s some gap of time

57:37.000 --> 57:39.520
when I have to say to them, then I start,

57:39.720 --> 57:43.600
“How to become strict?” I tell Myself.

57:44.120 --> 57:46.600
“Hah” spontaneously if something comes,

57:46.800 --> 57:51.400
then I say, “Why are doing like this?” At the most. Spontaneously.

57:51.600 --> 57:56.720
So, you have to develop this special style of guruship

57:56.920 --> 58:00.640
within yourself, which is for the collective working.

58:00.840 --> 58:05.480
Again, remember it is for the collective working.

58:07.480 --> 58:12.480
So today, you worship your Guru Principle within yourself

58:12.720 --> 58:14.320
when you are worshiping Me.

58:14.520 --> 58:18.400
I would not say that you should try to follow Me,

58:18.680 --> 58:21.920
because I am hopeless in many things.

58:22.360 --> 58:26.280
Say, banking I don’t understand, money I don’t understand,

58:26.480 --> 58:30.280
I mean there’s so many things I don’t know, really.

58:30.880 --> 58:33.560
I am hopeless, law I don’t understand.

58:33.880 --> 58:36.160
I mean, you should not be like Me, agreed.

58:36.360 --> 58:37.760
But,

58:39.320 --> 58:42.120
you should be able to say as I say that

58:42.320 --> 58:45.400
“You see, I have these problems.”

58:51.320 --> 58:56.360
But one thing for sure you must have

58:57.120 --> 59:01.760
complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

59:01.960 --> 59:06.600
or desire to know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

59:09.760 --> 59:14.360
If that works out,

59:14.840 --> 59:21.640
then you will swim into this ocean of knowledge,

59:22.800 --> 59:24.920
like a jet.

59:25.480 --> 59:27.240
And whatever you want,

59:27.440 --> 59:29.880
whatever you want to know, you will know.

59:30.360 --> 59:33.840
But there should be a desire to know.

59:34.040 --> 59:36.440
Never get satisfied

59:36.640 --> 59:40.160
that I know sufficiently enough about Sahaja Yoga, no never.

59:40.480 --> 59:43.600
In all other things you can be satisfied.

59:43.800 --> 59:48.320
But only on one thing, that's Sahaja Yoga, still,

59:48.880 --> 59:52.760
I have to know through my brains,

59:54.560 --> 59:58.480
and my heart

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.120
should have that knowledge.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.360
It should be in my heart, not only in my brain.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:08.400
I should know through my brain, it should be in my heart.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:17.880
Like when you see a film, you see King Kong.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.360
Then you know it’s King Kong,

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.840
all right, this is a film, doesn’t matter.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.040
Normally our knowledge is like that.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.320
But if you see Mr. King Kong standing here,

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.600
“Oh my God,

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.680
he’s already here.”

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.760
In the same way, when our knowledge is in the brain,

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.880
it is just like a film, is away from … it’s not in our heart.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.120
But when it is heart, it acts, it works.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.360
It doesn’t work through brain.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.120
In the brain it just stays but in the heart it works.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.480
And in the heart resides the spirit.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.200
Is very simple, that

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.920
we are people

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.480
who are more living with our brains, not with our heart.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.360
But know that we are in reality.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.520
You see, King Kong is standing before us.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.840
You are not seeing a film; it’s in reality.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.400
And in reality,

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.360
the heart has to work, not the brain,

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.000
because reality is only through the heart,

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.520
not through the brain.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.520
Once you understand this,

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.120
then you’ll open your heart, enlarge it,

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.200
“Now this is in my heart.”

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.760
So the whole thing will be so clear-cut in your head

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.240
you will know everything clearly.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:59.040
What is to be done, how to react, how to work it out.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.280
If you put all this knowledge of Sahaja Yoga into your heart –

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.520
first of all you’ll have to enlarge your heart

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.640
otherwise you can’t put this ocean –

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.560
and then you see, “This is Sahaj Yoga.”

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.800
To Me everything seems to be Sahaj Yoga,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.200
buying this house, coming to this place,

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.880
all this is Sahaj Yoga. I can see clearly.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.680
Anything that I see, I connect it to Sahaj Yoga immediately,

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.320
“This is Sahaja Yoga.”

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.000
Why this is so? This is because of Sahaj Yoga.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.840
This is Sahaj Yoga.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.560
So everywhere you start seeing Sahaja Yoga,

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.200
when your heart knows what your brain knows.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.080
I have known people who know all the mantras very well,

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.240
everything very well and all that but in the heart.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.720
So put it in the heart.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.200
In Sahaja Yoga the guru is not

01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.080
through his brain but through his heart.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.440
May God bless you all.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.200
For the Guru Puja

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.120
- Mother speaks HINDI -

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.080
first he’ll read it out.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.800
You see now this Guru Gita business

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.440
I never gave it to anyone of you to read.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.400
The reason is not that it’s not truth. They say it’s truth.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.120
But

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.880
it was told by Shiva to Parvati, what is a guru.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.320
But why I didn’t give you: because all these gurus

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.080
in the market they say, “All right, I am your guru

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.160
and this is Guru Gita.”

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.480
In the Guru Gita is written, give all your money,

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.680
all your belongings, all your self –

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.520
prana, mana, dana – your body, your mind,

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.120
everything to the guru and become a stupid fool;

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.880
so they give it to them.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.560
That’s why I didn’t give it to you.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.280
But today Rajesh – I’ve told him for the first time –

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.520
but that doesn’t mean that you should follow the way

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.880
it has been described by Shiva.

02:57:52.885 --> 02:57:56.516
I have to make an announcement today

02:57:56.716 --> 02:58:00.328
That we have already three of our leaders

02:58:00.528 --> 02:58:03.567
Dr. David Spirow

02:58:03.767 --> 02:58:08.012
then Gregoire de Kalbermatten,

02:58:08.707 --> 02:58:10.708
Guido

02:58:10.908 --> 02:58:18.784
and now today  I would like to appoint Rajeshwaha as one of them.

03:50:45.232 --> 03:50:49.778
Hello, please keep quiet. Please keep quiet.

03:50:49.978 --> 03:50:53.012
Nobody can hear anything. Just now...

03:50:53.212 --> 03:50:58.192
Just now you had such a big lecture from your Guru.

03:50:58.407 --> 03:51:03.373
Now will you please be dignified and keep quiet and don’t talk

03:51:03.962 --> 03:51:07.203
Please be seated. All of you.

03:51:07.404 --> 03:51:09.966
Please be seated!

03:51:10.211 --> 03:51:13.600
Those, who are bringing presents, please also please be seated

03:51:13.863 --> 03:51:17.507
One by one, please. Please.

05:02:46.825 --> 05:02:50.553
The Guru Puja is over now

05:02:51.029 --> 05:02:54.360
and we all have to depart.

05:02:59.087 --> 05:03:02.209
We decided to have more Pujas in this place

05:03:02.804 --> 05:03:05.894
because it is very

05:03:06.878 --> 05:03:09.294
lonely and nobody to disturb us

05:03:09.555 --> 05:03:12.842
and the people here are very nice

05:03:13.084 --> 05:03:16.363
and have been very kind to us.

05:03:17.831 --> 05:03:24.534
Moreover I think with my age I shouldn't also travel too much in Europe

05:03:24.734 --> 05:03:28.335
If possible I would like to have most of the Pujas here

05:03:28.535 --> 05:03:33.176
It is quite close to all the European countries at least.

05:03:33.381 --> 05:03:36.475
But America - of course I will go to America

05:03:36.675 --> 05:03:39.608
and all to South America.

05:03:39.815 --> 05:03:43.321
So the new program for me:

05:03:43.580 --> 05:03:45.930
My Qawwali goes on -

05:03:48.551 --> 05:03:55.379
for not only 24 hours, for the whole year, the life long.

05:03:57.178 --> 05:04:00.367
I must thank you all of you

05:04:00.644 --> 05:04:04.450
for coming here and

05:04:06.027 --> 05:04:09.816
living here under all kinds of circumstances.

05:04:10.016 --> 05:04:14.352
I hope next time - by next time, we  will have better arrangements made

05:04:14.567 --> 05:04:17.173
because there was hardly any time

05:04:17.373 --> 05:04:20.163
but very suitable for Guru Puja

05:04:21.524 --> 05:04:24.457
That we had to learn

05:04:24.663 --> 05:04:29.793
how to achieve the state of Guru.

05:04:31.545 --> 05:04:36.270
There are so many false people in this world now, you know that

05:04:36.502 --> 05:04:40.247
and as Babamama has said in the last

05:04:42.096 --> 05:04:44.647
Qawwali very beautifully

05:04:44.847 --> 05:04:51.253
That is the personality of a person makes

05:04:53.746 --> 05:04:56.889
the personality of the place.

05:04:57.139 --> 05:05:00.754
Like the roses are growing

05:05:01.056 --> 05:05:03.804
in the thorns

05:05:04.004 --> 05:05:06.673
but where the roses grow they don`'t say:

05:05:06.873 --> 05:05:09.464
"This is the place where the thorns are growing"

05:05:09.664 --> 05:05:12.347
but they say: "The roses are growing."

05:05:12.547 --> 05:05:16.360
So whatever maybe the conditions that I told you today

05:05:17.134 --> 05:05:21.503
to understand under what circumstances we are

05:05:22.261 --> 05:05:25.102
born and surrounded by

05:05:25.302 --> 05:05:28.469
and what psychological problems we arrived so far.

05:05:28.986 --> 05:05:32.064
Whatever it was, you have now

05:05:32.285 --> 05:05:35.661
to know that you have to enter into the Kingdom of God,

05:05:36.763 --> 05:05:42.015
where none of these bad things even

05:05:42.890 --> 05:05:44.865
can enter.

05:05:46.114 --> 05:05:48.308
and the enjoyment that we have had

05:05:48.508 --> 05:05:53.656
is absolute pure enjoyment of our Spirit dancing.

05:05:53.964 --> 05:05:59.359
I hope this time my lecture should not in any way depress you

05:06:00.287 --> 05:06:05.437
but on the contrary introspection is very good.

05:06:06.383 --> 05:06:09.482
Without that we can not understand

05:06:09.682 --> 05:06:13.367
there are so many things which I have discovered myself

05:06:13.567 --> 05:06:16.540
which are to be seen little

05:06:16.740 --> 05:06:20.988
carefully, why do we behave in such a manner.

05:06:21.188 --> 05:06:25.027
and I have tried to point it out to you, what our subtler

05:06:25.791 --> 05:06:28.467
badhas we have within ourselves.

05:06:28.667 --> 05:06:32.340
So please again and again you can listen to my tape

05:06:33.381 --> 05:06:36.167
and try to understand what I have said.

05:06:36.367 --> 05:06:42.270
I am sure next Guru Puja you all will be coming here as great gurus.

05:06:45.254 --> 05:06:47.485
All the best

05:06:47.685 --> 05:06:51.012
for - till the next Guru Puja I should say "All the best!"

05:06:51.212 --> 05:06:55.928
This year we all should work out to come out of the

05:06:57.000 --> 05:07:01.532
thoughts (thorns) and become the flower of fragrance,

05:07:01.732 --> 05:07:06.585
so that when people see us, they know now we have created here

05:07:06.785 --> 05:07:09.517
the World of God.

05:07:12.227 --> 05:07:15.610
There are obstacles, there are problems

05:07:15.810 --> 05:07:19.342
whenever there is truth there is always

05:07:19.542 --> 05:07:23.938
somebody to come on you, no doubt

05:07:24.138 --> 05:07:27.204
but truth will be successful,

05:07:27.404 --> 05:07:30.457
it will be victorious, be sure of that!

05:07:30.657 --> 05:07:33.764
With that surety, if you work it out

05:07:33.964 --> 05:07:35.951
it is all going

05:07:36.151 --> 05:07:38.391
to overcome all these little little hurdles,

05:07:38.591 --> 05:07:41.044
little little incidents that you have faced

05:07:41.244 --> 05:07:43.419
in a very beautiful manner.

05:07:43.645 --> 05:07:45.969
So never forget the enjoyment of tonight

05:07:46.169 --> 05:07:48.392
whenever you are depressed think of that

05:07:48.592 --> 05:07:52.542
and just start saying that we are not

05:07:52.759 --> 05:07:55.890
living our thorns, we are flowers

05:07:56.090 --> 05:08:00.261
we are roses. That's you are, you are more than that.

05:08:00.731 --> 05:08:06.689
You are more than that - the whole atmosphere is fragrant by your goodness.

05:08:06.892 --> 05:08:10.943
So keep to that and enjoy yourself.

05:08:11.185 --> 05:08:15.219
There is no place for depression for all of us.

05:08:15.564 --> 05:08:18.819
How many people have such joy in their lives

05:08:19.019 --> 05:08:22.636
to think about the memories of these beautiful nights

05:08:22.862 --> 05:08:27.829
that we have spent together enjoying ourselves and enjoying everybody else

05:08:28.103 --> 05:08:32.152
without thinking about race and all that, about...

05:08:32.354 --> 05:08:37.740
... The power of God's Love is going to completely help us

05:08:37.974 --> 05:08:42.684
I assure you, and I verily say to you

05:08:42.884 --> 05:08:48.763
that good will be victorious righteous will be victorious

05:08:48.974 --> 05:08:53.459
and we establish a new style of life

05:08:53.659 --> 05:08:56.624
where there is no hatered , there is no killing

05:08:56.826 --> 05:09:01.191
there is no jealousy but all love and love and love.

05:09:01.357 --> 05:09:03.751
May God bless you.
