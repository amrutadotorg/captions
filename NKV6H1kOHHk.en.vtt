00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.840
Today, you are all here to worship your Guru.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.480
It is

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.400
a common practice, specially in India,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.760
that you must

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.000
worship your guru,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.120
and the guru has to

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.600
fully be in control of his disciples.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.120
Guru Principle is

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.680
extremely strict,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.880
and the strictness made many people

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:32.080
could not conform to the ideals of a disciple.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.320
In those days the guru had to be,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.120
absolutely, the authority

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.480
and it was

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.960
the guru who would decide

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.080
which disciples he’ll have.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.520
And one had to go into great tapasya,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.640
to great penances, to even become a disciple.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.560
And this hardship

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.480
was the only way the guru used to judge.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.880
Gurus would always live in jungles

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.440
and they would select their disciples, very few, very, very few

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.000
and they had to go and beg food

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.960
from the neighboring villages,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.560
and cook food for their guru with their own hands,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.760
and feed the guru.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.600
That sort of

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.760
guru business is not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.880
That basically we must understand

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.760
that the difference between those styles

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.880
of guruship and

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.320
that we have now is this,

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.640
that very few individuals

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.960
were given the chance to become the guru, very few.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.280
And these few also were selected out of

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.400
quite a lot of people and they felt

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.760
that they were something really special that they are being selected,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:12.000
chosen, and that whatever

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.800
they will have to go through is all welcome.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.640
With this idea, they became the disciples.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.920
But Sahaja Yoga is a very different thing.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.280
I would say just the opposite.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.080
First of all, your Guru is a Mother

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.720
and who suffers from Sandrakaruna.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.640
At the slightest things that happen to you

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.520
My eyes get filled with tears.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.040
So as a Mother

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.040
to be a Guru is a very difficult thing.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.080
At the same time, for you to achieve heights is also difficult.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.240
Because you get lost

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:17.080
when I love you so much

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.040
and in that love you forget sometimes,

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.920
that the progress in your being is very slow.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.080
It is important

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.160
that in Sahaja Yoga you have to be strict with yourself.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.680
That’s why I said that you have to be your own guru,

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.400
which people do not understand what it means.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.920
You have to be your own guru means you have to guide yourself;

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:05.480
you have to treat yourself as your disciple

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.800
and you have to trim yourself.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.040
If you do not understand

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.920
the responsibility as Sahaja Yogi,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.800
of working it out yourself everything,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.800
you cannot move very fast,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.280
because

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.200
it is a different type

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.640
of relationship between the Guru and the disciples.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.520
So first I have always said you become your own guru.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.520
So you have to make

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.960
a lot of introspection

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.600
and fix your ideals.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.720
Before you I am sitting.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.840
You have seen Me how I am.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.880
I can eat anything;

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.120
I need not eat at all for days together.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.840
I can sleep anywhere;

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.520
I may not sleep at all.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.880
I travel for miles together untiringly.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:47.000
I have this energy because

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.680
I’m a Guru of Myself also.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.400
So the first thing is that there should be lot of introspection,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.720
“What’s wrong with me?” Not wrong with others.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.960
“What’s wrong with me?

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.480
Am I seeking the comfort of my body?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.680
The attention, is it on my body or on my spirit?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.160
If so, what am I doing?”

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.520
I think best thing is to write it down.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.360
“Can I sleep on the grass?

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.960
Can I sit on the stone?”

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.240
You have to make this body work.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.440
“Can I sleep anytime I like,

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.600
and can I keep awake anytime I like?”

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.680
I have seen people doze off.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.400
The reason is this, not that they are bad

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.400
or in any way indisciplined people

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.720
but because inside they are tired.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:13.440
If you are tired inside then you feel tired all the time.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.360
You’ll see on the television, if you see people in the West,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.440
they’re always sitting like this.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.400
Because they are so very tired.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.200
Why are they so tired? They don’t work so hard.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.880
So introspect how you behave.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.840
Now when you start introspecting yourself,

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.440
you’ll also start introspecting your surroundings

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.240
and your styles
and your methods,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.000
and what you are doing to yourself

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.200
because of the conditionings of the outside.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.520
Now the conditionings of the outside in the West,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.400
are of a psychological nature.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:10.600
Indians have other conditionings which are also quite surprising,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.720
or we should say the Western  people,

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.160
they must wash their hand ten times,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.840
even if their skin comes out, they’ll go on washing like mad.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.440
They must have a bathroom attached to them all the time.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.560
They must have their baths.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:27.880
If they don’t have bath they are not comfortable.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.880
They have other conditionings also.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.531
All kinds of stupid conditionings they have

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.280
but the conditionings that we have in the West

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.240
are more psychological and that’s why

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.880
you cannot find out what’s wrong with you.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.200
The physical conditionings are not so dangerous,

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.800
you can get over them or you can manage.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.280
But when you have conditioning of your psychology

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.480
you cannot understand what’s wrong with you.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.280
Now if you see, if you introspect around,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.960
what you will find is a very subtle thing.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.760
Firstly, that

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.840
because of the wars maybe, I don’t know why

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.080
but everybody is afraid of everyone.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.680
Specially I think, Freud.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.880
Because of Freud, even the mother is afraid of the child,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.960
and all these things to Indians are absolutely

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.520
they can’t understand this.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.160
But, you people know that very well.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:49.000
They won’t touch anybody;

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.880
they won’t hug anyone.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.680
First of all when they used to play football, they used to hug.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:00.280
But now I see they don’t hug they just touch hands like this.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.880
After sometime I think they may

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.280
just do like that or something.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:13.640
So frightened that nobody, even the children I’ve seen,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.880
are frightened of hugging their parents.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.840
So the expression of love is not there

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:27.920
and when there is no expression there is no love inside

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.400
and that’s how it goes on drying you up and drying you up and drying up.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.240
There was a little girl in Sahaja Yoga

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.840
and I had some present for that child.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.440
She was quite young, must have been about ten years of age.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.280
So I gave it to one Sahaja yogi, Western Sahaja yogi,

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.360
that you go and give it to her and say that I have given.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.840
“No Mother. I won’t give.” I said, “Why?”

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.680
“She’ll misunderstand me.” I said, “What will she misunderstand?”

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.720
It has gone so much into the heads of people.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.600
And this has created really

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.840
the psychological insecurity within you.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.760
From very childhood this insecurity has been working,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.960
and that’s why you are frightened of each other.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.840
Even of your parents, of your brothers, your sisters.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.120
Psychologically you are suffering.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.640
And when first I came to England they used to say

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.480
it is the insecurity. I said, “What insecurity?

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.880
The whole world is afraid of the Western world.”

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.840
And what are they suffering from insecurity?

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.200
They have made everybody insecure all over the world.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.680
And why, what are they insecure?

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.040
They are insecured within themselves

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.480
in their own society, in their own family,

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.760
in their own groups.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.960
They are so much frightened of each other.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.080
So the first thing, you should be fearless.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.280
You are a Sahaja Yogi, you are no more immoral,

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.120
cannot be immoral.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.080
If all the time if you start thinking that you are immoral,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.560
and if you do something it is immoral,

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:32.040
and that you have to go and do some confession somewhere,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.120
then what is going to happen to you?

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.840
What sort of a personality you will have?

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.840
We have to change this by changing ourselves.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.520
So among Sahaja yogis there should be

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.880
no insecurities but maryadas.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:03.040
You must know how to respect each others privacy.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.880
The second thing that if you find with the Western mind,

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.440
which is a very common thing,

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:22.160
that they are bombarded by criticism.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.920
There are so many critics

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.560
that now there are no more artists left.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.680
Only critics are criticizing critics.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.760
All artists are finished.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.160
They are all the time criticized.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.640
Somebody will come in – there’s an education on criticism –

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.600
they may not know how to play any instrument,

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.320
they may not know how to sing,

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:52.160
but they can criticize all right.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.680
So all the time in your mind, is a way

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.680
that you always feel that somebody will criticize if you do this.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.360
All the time the fear is there that somebody will criticize.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.720
So, “Should I say or not?”

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.320
As Sahaja yogis, you shouldn’t worry about

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.760
these stupid people because they are blind.

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.760
And if they want to criticize you, let them criticize.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.800
What does it matter? Makes no difference.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.160
But this you have to build up within yourself.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.040
Now the third is even worse,

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.360
which I don’t know if you have noticed or not.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.280
I don’t know how it has gone into the heads of the Western minds

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.960
that you must always see

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.960
to the other side of the bank,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.920
even if you are standing on this side,

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.480
to be fair

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:07.880
and never to say something that you are sure of.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:13.040
Like you ask anyone, “How are you?” He’ll say …

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.040
Always.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.240
Nobody say, will say, “I am perfectly all right,

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.840
nothing wrong with me.”

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.160
“What’s wrong?”

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.640
“Perfectly all right, thank you very much.”

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.280
But it is never.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.720
They are not sure of themselves, all the time, is shaking.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.320
And this shaking inside

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:54.880
gives you a personality which can never progress.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:01.320
Progress comes when you put your step forward,

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.760
you put your foot firmly on that point

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.520
and then put the second step forward,

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.280
like as you climb on a mountain.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.200
But in the first place only if you are still thinking

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.240
that it’s half way through,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.400
then how can you go further?

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:33.000
You’ll only move on two steps, this or that or this or that.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.040
This is another very big psychological

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.840
deterrent I should call it,

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.000
or detrimental thing for your progress.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:49.800
Now the third thing you have learned

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.800
which is also, third or fourth maybe,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.320
that you must argue out yourself.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.600
Like you have a problem,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.320
you’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, this problem I have got.”

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.960
This is very common with everyone,

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.360
“I have this problem.”

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.240
I’ll say, “All right, this is the solution.”

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.880
Then you’ll come out, “No, no, no. But in this, this will happen.”

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.240
Then You tell another solution,

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.840
“No, no, no, no, no Mother, this can't be this way.”

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.560
All right, You tell third solution,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.960
“No Mother, in this, this can happen.”

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.040
Tell fourth, “This can happen.”

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.920
You are standing against yourself all the time.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.840
Then I have to say, “This is your problem, not Mine,

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.720
and I am giving you the solutions

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.680
and if you want to solve your problem,

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.320
better take a positive attitude.”

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:09.000
The brain is this way.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.360
In our Hindi language it’s called “ulti khopdi.”

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.000
You are all the time arguing against yourself.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.440
So how can you progress?

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:32.120
This is another great problem of the Western mind

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.280
that it doesn’t

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:41.920
try to face any problem as your own,

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.040
but go on arguing with yourself like a lawyer.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.080
You see. there are two lawyers:

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.920
one yourself, another lawyer – go on arguing.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.040
So is a double personality in the body, being;

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.160
is not a single personality.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.160
As I said, it is very, very psychological

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.760
that people have to

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:16.680
take to this kind of a turn suddenly,

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.560
without understanding how dangerous it is.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:33.960
With the enlightenment of your brain, this should disappear.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.520
On the contrary in Sahaja Yoga, it’s very dangerous.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:43.560
Because you say something, you are all Sahaja yogis,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.120
you are connected with the all-pervading power.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.960
Whatever you say gets connected

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.680
and it acts.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.120
Is very dangerous

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:06.280
for you people not to realize that you are realized souls,

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.480
and not to assume your own powers.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:19.520
Like you see, I have to say something secretly

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.920
then I must put My hand here and then say it

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:26.360
because it is connected to the mains.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:32.840
But supposing I keep it open like this and say something,

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.080
it goes to everyone.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.840
In the same way

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.120
whatever the Sahaja yogis say or desire or want,

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.160
there are just people sitting there, see here and here,

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.400
you have put them there.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.240
They are listening to you all the time.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.880
They are so anxious to do your work,

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.120
“All right, you say so, done.”

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.920
So whatever you think or whatever you desire

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.480
or whatever you say, you have to be extremely careful.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.880
And when, now, I mean, old people, all right,

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.720
I can say that very conditioned, they have problems and all,

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.680
but the generation that is here, most of them,

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.760
are all capable of improving yourself

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.560
and making your brain straight

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.880
by bringing it backwards to the forward.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:46.200
This psychological problem you do not say.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.480
The another psychological problem is,

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.880
which you do not know, which is very surprising,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.120
that whatever is the

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.720
entrepreneur’s ideas

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.040
you must act,

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.520
because the whole fundamentals of Western life

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.240
is to see and to be seen.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:20.320
So, “Oh that’s the fashion so we should do like that.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.000
This is the fashion so we do like that.”

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.800
Like the other day, about a year back,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.120
I went to England and I found all the Sahaja Yoginis having their hair here

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.880
I said, “What’s this?”

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.560
So I asked an Indian girl, I said, “What is this supposed to be?”

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.560
“This is a new fashion.” I said, “What new fashion?”

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.920
Called as “ziprya” in Marathi you know, we call it ziprya fashion.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:50.480
The Maharashtrians can ….

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.960
And they all had their hair here you know, like this, all.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.680
I said, “My God, this is Agnya, this they are covering,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.000
their eyes will become squinty.”

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.320
But the fashion if it comes,

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.680
and the whole fashion is with the hair alone.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.120
Hair I don’t know what.

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.920
There’s so much interest in the hair.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.560
And they lose the hair so fast in these countries,

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.600
without using the oil, which they should use.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.920
They lose their hair very fast.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.920
Starting from the hair, the Sahasrara.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.600
Then fashion means –

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.880
What is this these entrepreneurs,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.200
these stupid people are creating ideas

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.320
and there why should we follow?

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.640
I don’t say that Sahaja yogis should all look alike, not at all.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.920
You can dress up the way you like; you can live the way you like

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.200
but you should not get yourself enslaved by any entrepreneurs.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.600
You are free people now – know that very well.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.400
Know that you are absolutely free

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:04.640
and your freedom is absolutely in the light of your enlightenment.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.960
You can never do wrong.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:13.360
But first of all, have that confidence within yourself

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.200
that whatever you have to do,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:23.680
you are not going to enslave yourself to entrepreneurs,

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.760
what people have to say, how you will look,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.400
how you will appear before.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.800
This is a very important point

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.520
that half of the time we are laboring just to look like many others.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.400
It’s very surprising

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.360
how these entrepreneurs have befooled the Western people.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.440
In India it won’t work, won’t work –

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.960
specially the Indian women.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.560
This “in-between” came, a mini sari,

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:59.440
came up to Bombay for about four-five days, I think, disappeared.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.000
No Indian woman would wear a mini-sari, finished.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.480
Nothing doing.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.960
Any sort of fashion now, comes in India, doesn’t stay

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.000
because whatever clothes we have now in India -

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.760
is traditionally - has been there,

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:24.280
has been tested and error and trial and error and trial,

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.640
and we know now this is the best, now stop it.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.000
At certain age you stop.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.960
This is the style that suits us the best.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.120
But anything goes on and the styles go on changing.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.680
And this is what you have to be very careful to see

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.720
that you do not take to stupid things,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.200
which are being created by entrepreneurs,

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:52.320
but to sensible things, which are required for you.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.440
So one of the enslavement I feel, is

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:02.720
that you have to play into the hands of entrepreneurs.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:09.360
But a slavery is very deep and is so psychological;

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:16.240
in so many ways it is extremely hidden

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.960
and so subtle that you cannot make it out.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.560
So, in the introspection you find out

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.040
what’s gone wrong with you,

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.160
how you are made this way.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:41.400
“What’s wrong in my own personality –

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:46.040
it has come from all the surroundings

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:50.480
and the way people have been putting ideas into my head.”

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.400
You should have your own ideas.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.240
You shouldn’t worry what Plato said

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.640
and what Socrates said and what this thing said.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.880
What do you think?

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.920
After all, you are enlightened people.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.640
But then there is another psychological thing,

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.840
which is even the worst.

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.680
And that “Mother, if we are very sure,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.000
then we are putting up our ego.”

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.320
They are so much afraid of their ego

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.200
that as if after some time they’ll take off.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:34.040
“The ego will bloat so much that we’ll take off.”

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.760
This is another fear people have, that if we assert,

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.640
“All right this is what I want, this is the right thing to do,

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:47.600
then I’ll get off so I don’t want to say such a thing;

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.400
I have an ego.”

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:54.760
So, with Sahaja Yoga also, certain fears have crawled in.

00:31:55.320 --> 00:32:00.760
One of them is that “Mother, I should not have any ego.”

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.440
Now, what is the problem of ego?

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:13.360
That also surprising despite all fear and everything.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.320
As a reaction to it people have developed

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:23.640
a kind of a protesting character.

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.800
But again these entrepreneurs have pampered your ego.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.880
Like, in the morning you ask the child, “What will you have?”

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.680
Then child will say, “I’ll have this.”

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.960
The mother has to run and get it,

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.840
or she must keep everything in the fridge.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.920
In India that’s not the case.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:51.160
Whatever is cooked in the house, you better have.

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.200
If there is no salt, all right without salt, come along.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.160
Otherwise don’t eat, doesn’t matter.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.400
In any case you will eat.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.000
So when the disciplining comes within yourself

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.560
and you understand this,

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.120
then you do not say, “I desire only this, I desire only this.”

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.480
What you desire, you tell yourself:

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:21.560
“All right, you’ll not have it for one month, let’s see.”

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.400
Once I must tell you about Myself that

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.400
little bit comfort grew upon Me, sometimes, I think.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.680
So, we had, had a transfer,

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.320
and My family was not with Me at that time.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.960
We had only one small little bed where My husband slept.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:51.040
And I slept just on the bare cement on the earth,

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.440
and next day I started getting the pain in the body.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.800
I said, “All right.” I slept on the cement for one month.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.880
“On the cement you get pain? All right. Sleep now.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:08.680
One month,” I said, “I’m going to sleep on the cement.”

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.800
Then cement lost its power on Me.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:19.200
Then, might be the cement might be feeling the pain.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.960
So, that’s what you have to do, is to master your mind.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.120
Now the problem only will come:

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.960
"What is the discretion? - This ego will come up Mother.”

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.440
Because, your ego, as I said, is developed by reactions,

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.040
by protesting against things,

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:47.680
and also by the pampering of the entrepreneurs.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.120
All right, whatever may be the reason,

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.880
we are not going to psychoanalyze ourselves.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:56.960
But the fact is, also we have a ego problem.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.000
Why?

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.520
I have already told you that, if a balloon is bloated many a times,

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.040
it can easily be bloated.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:09.920
At the slightest air, it bloats.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.320
And that’s why you are afraid that suddenly

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:15.360
my ego might become so big

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.480
that I may be like a balloon in the air, somewhere moving.”

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:28.560
But, how to get rid of this is to know that

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.240
you are an enlightened soul.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:36.960
Respect yourself.

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.160
Once you start respecting yourself,

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:49.320
you will not fall into any traps of ego.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.840
Very simple.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.480
Respect yourself.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.400
You have to say,

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.760
“I am a Sahaja yogi.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.400
how can I behave like this?

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:12.000
After all, I am a Sahaja yogi.”

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.560
A kind of a dignity that develops,

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.680
and then you will start feeling shy

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.880
of doing something that is stupid,

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:30.760
because ego makes you stupid, that’s the point is, absolutely.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:36.600
So now, if you develop this respect for yourself,

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.880
“I’m a Sahaja yogi,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.160
so I can’t behave like this.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.880
I’m a Sahaja yogi.”

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.120
If you say like that to yourself,

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:55.240
then you will be amazed

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.880
that the dignity of a Sahaja yogi

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:03.960
will definitely keep you down to earth.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.720
You will not get into the trap of your ego.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:17.200
So one side is the conditioning, another side is this ego.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.640
Simple thing is ego.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.280
That dignity has to be developed.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:35.080
You’ll be surprised – among animals there are maryadas.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.600
Like a tiger won’t behave like a snake

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.480
and snake won’t behave like a tiger.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:45.120
So we are now Sahaja yogis.

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.160
We are tigers among human beings, we are lions among humans,

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.520
the highest; we are the highest human beings.

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:59.600
It’s not necessary to have ten, what you call,

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:04.760
medals on your body to show that you are something great

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.840
but you are Sahaja yogis, you are Mahayogis.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.520
So, develop that

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.880
respect

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.960
and you will be surprised the humility

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.400
will immediately came into you,

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.520
I mean will walk into you, humility.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.680
I have seen some Sahaja yogis sit like this,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.360
sometimes sit like this,

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:35.800
sometimes they,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.200
one, if the Left Vishuddhi is there, like this,

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.520
Right Vishuddhi is there, like this.

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.200
But then you see yourself.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.240
Like a bridegroom has to dress up

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.760
and he remembers, “I am the bridegroom,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.880
I cannot behave like other younger boys who will be there.

00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:07.080
I have to have my own personality.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.520
I am the bridegroom;

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:11.800
I am going for my wedding.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.680
I cannot behave like all my other friends are there.”

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.640
You have to behave in a particular manner.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.720
So assume this.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:25.960
Still we do not know that we are Sahaja yogis.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.720
Once we know we are Sahaja yogis,

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:33.560
that dignity will develop within us,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.680
and with that dignity you’ll be amazed

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.680
you’ll also see what is wrong in your own country,

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.640
what is indignified.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.720
Now with the whatever has happened in France,

00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:56.960
you can find out what’s wrong with French laws.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:02.480
But French are more interested in drinking and eating

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:05.680
and other things. So they never paid -

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.400
“Oh, let it be, what do we care for laws, let it be as it is,

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.880
doesn’t matter, who should bother about these things,

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.760
is nothing important.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.040
After all, if you can get something to drink .…”

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.280
You go to any French village, at seven time,

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.840
you cannot meet anyone, even a drunkard.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.960
They are sitting inside and drinking, drinking.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.920
I mean that’s the main religion, main pastime.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.160
Next day with a hangover they come,

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.200
so they see everything the other way round.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:41.000
Like this fellow, these journalist who went to India,

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.400
they saw an iron gate

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.080
and they thought this was the iron curtain of Hitler.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.720
Everything expanded, you know, so big,

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:53.720
crooked because hangover, you know.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:59.680
So the whole life in the West like a hangover.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.400
Either they see things too big or too small,

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:07.120
they don’t see things as they are.

00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.160
Now most of these things are written, which you will read,

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.400
the psychology and all those things and the books,

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:18.720
mostly they are drunkards.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.760
If you see their lives, they have been drunkards.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.720
So whatever they have written,

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.000
why should we take them so seriously?

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.440
Except for very few who were realized souls,

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.840
most of them were drunkards.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.680
Like those who wrote about Greek tragedies

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.680
must have been really drunkard people

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.520
In – they must be taking lot of things

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.920
inside and then must be writing something like that.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.160
Because most of the drunkards,

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:56.160
when they write, they say that “Why, why should I live, I must die.”

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.120
And like that we too have in India

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.880
many people who have written ghazals who always say that

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.960
“Why should we live, we should die.”

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:07.320
So if there’s one poet who has said,

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:12.480
“Now you are talking of dying, why don’t you die once for all?”

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.080
So, you will realize that

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.760
what you will write,

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.680
what you will say is higher than all these people.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.760
But Sahaja Yoga has worked so smoothly in you

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.040
that you do not know what you are.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:43.400
Today, on Guru Puja, you are worshiping your Guru.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:49.840
At the same time I bow to your guru within yourself.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:58.880
Let your guru come up and show itself.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.840
Specially the kind of a Guru you have –

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:10.360
I am not strict with you, I am very gentle.

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.080
Because, as I told you, fundamentally is a different thing

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:19.280
is that it is not for an individual, but it is for the collective.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.600
And if something has to spread collectively,

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:27.760
then you have to understand

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.720
that it has to be only love that is going to work it.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.600
There is no other way we can spread Sahaja Yoga

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:41.440
because we cannot be like Hitler giving wrong ideas of hatred.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:46.160
Either it could be hatred or love.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:49.880
You teach people we hate this one – fundamentalism,

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.160
this, that – you’ll get thousands ready to fight.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:59.360
You can elevate their baser self and say,

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.920
“All right, come along, let us fight.”

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:07.120
Racialism, this, that, anything, even nationalism.

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.360
All right, they are people.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.800
But when I say love, is very different.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.360
Try to understand.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:17.080
And because of our collective work, we have to know

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:23.600
that love is a source of energy

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:27.160
that makes things grow

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.800
in a living manner.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.080
It is the energy which is a living energy.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.120
Try to understand now. This is, people don’t understand.

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.920
Love doesn’t mean that you hug somebody or do something,

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:44.120
but living energy that understands,

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.200
that makes you grow.

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.320
I hope you have seen My books, and I hope you have read it.

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:57.360
In that I have described you to you very clearly

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:02.640
what is the living energy within us that works,

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.600
and anything that is working. For example see this flower.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.760
Now, I cannot order this one to go straight.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.880
It’s moving in its own way – let it be.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:18.160
It looks nice because no flower should look like another flower.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.680
Living energy never creates the same thing exactly than another.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.400
Only plastics can be done.

00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:30.240
Now, when it is growing, it is growing in its own way.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:34.360
So whatever is built in within you, which is a living energy,

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.680
built in, but living energy, and a living thing that works –

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.760
it blossoms by itself.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:47.920
The water of pure love is to be given.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:57.320
In pure love what you see in another person, as a guru,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.520
“What’s the matter with myself

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:09.880
where it is obstructing me to go further.”

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.240
In another person, as a guru, what you see

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:20.800
is how to handle this man, with love,

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.040
so that he comes closer to reality.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.840
Is a very gentle process

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.960
is very loving process,

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:38.040
and nothing like really enjoying your love.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:43.360
Just to know that I love so many people itself is so great.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.720
And you too see feel that “I love so many.”

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.000
But it should be samadrishti – means:

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.240
With the same eyes you should see everyone.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:59.560
You see everybody with the same eyes, isn’t it?

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.880
Only two eyes are there.

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:11.880
But, you see everyone with the same eyes – they are different.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.960
All right, you see them as different.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.240
But you do not … your eyes do not discriminate.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.680
Your eyes do not see somebody black, somebody white,

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:27.040
somebody blue.

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.800
They see what they are.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.520
When you start seeing with samadrishti, means the same eyes,

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.440
same sight,

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.680
not to change your ideas.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.760
Because, what happens that your own mind twists it,

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:55.880
and you start seeing somebody as different, somebody as different.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.520
Now, with the eyes I see the fan.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.720
But supposing My mind is off, I might see as a human being.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.080
So if you are a sane person,

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.040
then you will see everyone as they are.

00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:15.840
This is samadrishti is that

00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:19.680
you have the same eyes for everyone.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.560
Do not get twisted, so that you cannot have:

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.160
somebody is your special friend,

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.720
somebody is number two friend, somebody as number ten friend

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:33.760
and some as your enemy.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:38.760
Once you start looking at things like that,

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:45.200
everything will get into proper shapes.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:50.440
Otherwise, one can go crazy.

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:55.720
Also, it should be samyak.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:59.520
Samyak means “integrated”.

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.200
There should be an integrated knowledge.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.240
Like the eyes when they see,

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.360
they see where you are sitting, where you are,

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.240
where is this person, where is that person,

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:14.880
what is the relationship.

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.000
So the knowledge about others

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.040
is in relationships with each other.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:27.840
Now supposing there’s a gentleman who has a child,

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:32.320
and there’s a problem between that gentleman and the child.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.760
To approach that person,

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:37.160
you must know that he has a child;

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:44.280
not to just make him separated from others, singularizing.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:49.840
You take somebody, say, he is from, say from England

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.360
or he is from Italy.

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:56.080
Then try to understand him

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.680
that he is from that particular background

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.800
and that background is around him, so he is like that.

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.880
If you can have this kind of a full knowledge of others,

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:13.800
there will be no problems, no quarreling, nothing.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.440
Otherwise there is a conflict all the time

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.760
and that’s how one feels very tired.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.840
Eyes do not react; eyes just see;

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.120
whatever is there, they just see.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.640
Eyes never react,

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:38.200
but the mind reacts.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:42.320
And this reaction is the one which is responsible

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:46.760
for spoiling your attitude towards people.

00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.400
So now,

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.680
you should have a witness state.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.200
As Gyaneshwara said, “Niranjan pahane. –

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.640
Niranjan pahane”

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.920
To see somebody without any reaction.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.720
Just to see and you’ll know everything about that person,

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:14.040
as soon as you see that person.

00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.680
"Niranjan pahane”

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:17.680
Because, as long as your brain is there

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.120
you do not see that person as he is.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.480
But as soon as you see that person,

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.000
you just know what it is.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.760
And then, immediately you will know

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:35.280
his chakras, his kundalini, everything you’ll penetrate.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:39.240
But your mind, which is loaded with nonsense,

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.200
will not allow you to go to that level.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.240
So the niranjan pahane, the one where you just see something,

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:53.480
that kind of a eye we have to develop it.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:52:00.560
So, with that a detachment starts,

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:05.000
automatically you do not criticize anybody

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.320
because your mind is like this against that person;

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.800
you do not love somebody because your mind thinks this way;

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.520
you too cannot form groups;

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:18.760
you cannot have some people who are dear to you, some are not.

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.000
Sometimes, if I do not smile at some people

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.600
then they grumble and say,

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.080
“This time Mother didn’t smile at me.”

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.200
I mean, I cannot keep all the time a smile, you see.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.840
You must also think of My muscles.

00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:50.200
All the time how can I keep My smile on, you know?

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:53.120
But there are people who feel very bad that

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.640
“You see, this time Mother didn’t smile.”

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.880
So I have to go on smiling all the time at every one.

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.800
I try.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.520
So the

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.120
attitude towards others

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.480
has to be with niranjan

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:29.000
attitude, because it’s a collective work.

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.360
It’s not strict;

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.200
it is not in any way clamping anything

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.240
because it’s a living work,

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.560
absolutely it’s living, we cannot.

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:49.600
But it is definitely the work, which

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:56.440
creates harmony, love,

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:00.680
affection, feeling of oneness.

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:04.360
Imagine, to think about someone

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.320
who is not kind to you or he’s … is a horrible thing.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:14.480
Better think how nice you could be to that person.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.280
So the attitude should be that

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.360
how nice I am going to be with that person, you know.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.360
See, somebody is angry with you,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.160
is easy to fight, “Come along. You are angry, I am angry.”

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.640
No. Go and just tickle.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.840
Simple thing like that,

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.040
and enjoy.

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:44.520
Because you cannot enjoy hatred;

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.880
you cannot enjoy rivalry;

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.400
you cannot enjoy separatedness.

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:57.120
Like this hand has to enjoy this hand,

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:02.480
in the same way you have to enjoy each other.

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.840
If you cannot enjoy then you have lost the point,

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.160
lost the point.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:19.560
So, in the collective progress we have to know that we cannot

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.280
progress if we have no sense of collectivity,

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.720
that we are part and parcel of one person.

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:34.160
If I pull My one ear, it’s not that My ear will come out

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.800
but it will give pain to the whole body.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.560
That’s why I say pull both is better.

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:50.080
And when you start, you see, seeing this way yourself,

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.720
then you’ll be amazed a kind of a sweet humor about yourself develops.

00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:02.360
And you really become a very interesting, magnetic personality,

00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:10.200
and a very enjoyable person, extremely enjoyable.

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.600
Everybody will seek your company.

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:19.960
This is what is the sign of your Guru Principle being enlightened.

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.720
Of course, they have said that you should get detachment;

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.600
you should not have any attachment to this and that and that and that.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.760
This is all talking.

00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:33.600
But actually, only introspection

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.440
and assumption

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.000
or, we can say,

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.640
the knowledge of your own depth,

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.920
itself, will give you that feeling.

00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:56.200
If you have that knowledge that I am a Sahaja Yogi,

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:02.480
and my depth of divinity is so great.

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:09.080
That itself will be more than sufficient

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:15.120
for you to exist as the topmost guru.

00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:19.160
Actually, I am no more a Guru, I was never a Guru –

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.360
I am a Mother; I am hopeless Guru.

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.200
Because, a Guru who cannot be strict is useless,

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.760
and I have to prepare Myself to say things, you know.

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.240
If there’s problem between two people,

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:36.800
and then if there’s some gap of time

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.520
when I have to say to them, then I start,

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:43.600
“How to become strict?” I tell Myself.

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.600
“Hah” spontaneously if something comes,

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:51.400
then I say, “Why are doing like this?” At the most. Spontaneously.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:56.720
So, you have to develop this special style of guruship

00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:00.640
within yourself, which is for the collective working.

00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:05.480
Again, remember it is for the collective working.

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:12.480
So today, you worship your Guru Principle within yourself

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.320
when you are worshiping Me.

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:18.400
I would not say that you should try to follow Me,

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.920
because I am hopeless in many things.

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:26.280
Say, banking I don’t understand, money I don’t understand,

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:30.280
I mean there’s so many things I don’t know, really.

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.560
I am hopeless, law I don’t understand.

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:36.160
I mean, you should not be like Me, agreed.

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:37.760
But,

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:42.120
you should be able to say as I say that

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:45.400
“You see, I have these problems.”

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:56.360
But one thing for sure you must have

00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:01.760
complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.600
or desire to know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:14.360
If that works out,

00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:21.640
then you will swim into this ocean of knowledge,

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.920
like a jet.

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.240
And whatever you want,

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.880
whatever you want to know, you will know.

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:33.840
But there should be a desire to know.

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.440
Never get satisfied

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:40.160
that I know sufficiently enough about Sahaja Yoga, no never.

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.600
In all other things you can be satisfied.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:48.320
But only on one thing, that's Sahaja Yoga, still,

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:52.760
I have to know through my brains,

00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:58.480
and my heart

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.120
should have that knowledge.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:03.360
It should be in my heart, not only in my brain.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:08.400
I should know through my brain, it should be in my heart.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:17.880
Like when you see a film, you see King Kong.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.360
Then you know it’s King Kong,

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.840
all right, this is a film, doesn’t matter.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:27.040
Normally our knowledge is like that.

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:30.320
But if you see Mr. King Kong standing here,

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.600
“Oh my God,

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.680
he’s already here.”

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.760
In the same way, when our knowledge is in the brain,

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.880
it is just like a film, is away from … it’s not in our heart.

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.120
But when it is heart, it acts, it works.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.360
It doesn’t work through brain.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.120
In the brain it just stays but in the heart it works.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.480
And in the heart resides the spirit.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.200
Is very simple, that

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:09.920
we are people

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.480
who are more living with our brains, not with our heart.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.360
But know that we are in reality.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.520
You see, King Kong is standing before us.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.840
You are not seeing a film; it’s in reality.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:27.400
And in reality,

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.360
the heart has to work, not the brain,

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.000
because reality is only through the heart,

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.520
not through the brain.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.520
Once you understand this,

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.120
then you’ll open your heart, enlarge it,

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.200
“Now this is in my heart.”

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.760
So the whole thing will be so clear-cut in your head

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.240
you will know everything clearly.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:59.040
What is to be done, how to react, how to work it out.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.280
If you put all this knowledge of Sahaja Yoga into your heart –

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.520
first of all you’ll have to enlarge your heart

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.640
otherwise you can’t put this ocean –

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.560
and then you see, “This is Sahaj Yoga.”

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.800
To Me everything seems to be Sahaj Yoga,

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.200
buying this house, coming to this place,

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.880
all this is Sahaj Yoga. I can see clearly.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:26.680
Anything that I see, I connect it to Sahaj Yoga immediately,

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:28.320
“This is Sahaja Yoga.”

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.000
Why this is so? This is because of Sahaj Yoga.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:32.840
This is Sahaj Yoga.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.560
So everywhere you start seeing Sahaja Yoga,

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.200
when your heart knows what your brain knows.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.080
I have known people who know all the mantras very well,

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:48.240
everything very well and all that but in the heart.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.720
So put it in the heart.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.200
In Sahaja Yoga the guru is not

01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:00.080
through his brain but through his heart.

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.440
May God bless you all.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:14.200
For the Guru Puja

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.120
- Mother speaks HINDI -

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.080
first he’ll read it out.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.800
You see now this Guru Gita business

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.440
I never gave it to anyone of you to read.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.400
The reason is not that it’s not truth. They say it’s truth.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.120
But

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.880
it was told by Shiva to Parvati, what is a guru.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.320
But why I didn’t give you: because all these gurus

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.080
in the market they say, “All right, I am your guru

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:50.160
and this is Guru Gita.”

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.480
In the Guru Gita is written, give all your money,

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.680
all your belongings, all your self –

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.520
prana, mana, dana – your body, your mind,

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.120
everything to the guru and become a stupid fool;

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.880
so they give it to them.

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.560
That’s why I didn’t give it to you.

01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.280
But today Rajesh – I’ve told him for the first time –

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.520
but that doesn’t mean that you should follow the way

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.880
it has been described by Shiva.

02:57:52.885 --> 02:57:56.516
I have to make an announcement today

02:57:56.716 --> 02:58:00.328
That we have already three of our leaders

02:58:00.528 --> 02:58:03.567
Dr. David Spirow

02:58:03.767 --> 02:58:08.012
then Gregoire de Kalbermatten,

02:58:08.707 --> 02:58:10.708
Guido

02:58:10.908 --> 02:58:18.784
and now today  I would like to appoint Rajeshwaha as one of them.

03:50:45.232 --> 03:50:49.778
Hello, please keep quiet. Please keep quiet.

03:50:49.978 --> 03:50:53.012
Nobody can hear anything. Just now...

03:50:53.212 --> 03:50:58.192
Just now you had such a big lecture from your Guru.

03:50:58.407 --> 03:51:03.373
Now will you please be dignified and keep quiet and don’t talk

03:51:03.962 --> 03:51:07.203
Please be seated. All of you.

03:51:07.404 --> 03:51:09.966
Please be seated!

03:51:10.211 --> 03:51:13.600
Those, who are bringing presents, please also please be seated

03:51:13.863 --> 03:51:17.507
One by one, please. Please.

05:02:46.825 --> 05:02:50.553
The Guru Puja is over now

05:02:51.029 --> 05:02:54.360
and we all have to depart.

05:02:59.087 --> 05:03:02.209
We decided to have more Pujas in this place

05:03:02.804 --> 05:03:05.894
because it is very

05:03:06.878 --> 05:03:09.294
lonely and nobody to disturb us

05:03:09.555 --> 05:03:12.842
and the people here are very nice

05:03:13.084 --> 05:03:16.363
and have been very kind to us.

05:03:17.831 --> 05:03:24.534
Moreover I think with my age I shouldn't also travel too much in Europe

05:03:24.734 --> 05:03:28.335
If possible I would like to have most of the Pujas here

05:03:28.535 --> 05:03:33.176
It is quite close to all the European countries at least.

05:03:33.381 --> 05:03:36.475
But America - of course I will go to America

05:03:36.675 --> 05:03:39.608
and all to South America.

05:03:39.815 --> 05:03:43.321
So the new program for me:

05:03:43.580 --> 05:03:45.930
My Qawwali goes on -

05:03:48.551 --> 05:03:55.379
for not only 24 hours, for the whole year, the life long.

05:03:57.178 --> 05:04:00.367
I must thank you all of you

05:04:00.644 --> 05:04:04.450
for coming here and

05:04:06.027 --> 05:04:09.816
living here under all kinds of circumstances.

05:04:10.016 --> 05:04:14.352
I hope next time - by next time, we  will have better arrangements made

05:04:14.567 --> 05:04:17.173
because there was hardly any time

05:04:17.373 --> 05:04:20.163
but very suitable for Guru Puja

05:04:21.524 --> 05:04:24.457
That we had to learn

05:04:24.663 --> 05:04:29.793
how to achieve the state of Guru.

05:04:31.545 --> 05:04:36.270
There are so many false people in this world now, you know that

05:04:36.502 --> 05:04:40.247
and as Babamama has said in the last

05:04:42.096 --> 05:04:44.647
Qawwali very beautifully

05:04:44.847 --> 05:04:51.253
That is the personality of a person makes

05:04:53.746 --> 05:04:56.889
the personality of the place.

05:04:57.139 --> 05:05:00.754
Like the roses are growing

05:05:01.056 --> 05:05:03.804
in the thorns

05:05:04.004 --> 05:05:06.673
but where the roses grow they don`'t say:

05:05:06.873 --> 05:05:09.464
"This is the place where the thorns are growing"

05:05:09.664 --> 05:05:12.347
but they say: "The roses are growing."

05:05:12.547 --> 05:05:16.360
So whatever maybe the conditions that I told you today

05:05:17.134 --> 05:05:21.503
to understand under what circumstances we are

05:05:22.261 --> 05:05:25.102
born and surrounded by

05:05:25.302 --> 05:05:28.469
and what psychological problems we arrived so far.

05:05:28.986 --> 05:05:32.064
Whatever it was, you have now

05:05:32.285 --> 05:05:35.661
to know that you have to enter into the Kingdom of God,

05:05:36.763 --> 05:05:42.015
where none of these bad things even

05:05:42.890 --> 05:05:44.865
can enter.

05:05:46.114 --> 05:05:48.308
and the enjoyment that we have had

05:05:48.508 --> 05:05:53.656
is absolute pure enjoyment of our Spirit dancing.

05:05:53.964 --> 05:05:59.359
I hope this time my lecture should not in any way depress you

05:06:00.287 --> 05:06:05.437
but on the contrary introspection is very good.

05:06:06.383 --> 05:06:09.482
Without that we can not understand

05:06:09.682 --> 05:06:13.367
there are so many things which I have discovered myself

05:06:13.567 --> 05:06:16.540
which are to be seen little

05:06:16.740 --> 05:06:20.988
carefully, why do we behave in such a manner.

05:06:21.188 --> 05:06:25.027
and I have tried to point it out to you, what our subtler

05:06:25.791 --> 05:06:28.467
badhas we have within ourselves.

05:06:28.667 --> 05:06:32.340
So please again and again you can listen to my tape

05:06:33.381 --> 05:06:36.167
and try to understand what I have said.

05:06:36.367 --> 05:06:42.270
I am sure next Guru Puja you all will be coming here as great gurus.

05:06:45.254 --> 05:06:47.485
All the best

05:06:47.685 --> 05:06:51.012
for - till the next Guru Puja I should say "All the best!"

05:06:51.212 --> 05:06:55.928
This year we all should work out to come out of the

05:06:57.000 --> 05:07:01.532
thoughts (thorns) and become the flower of fragrance,

05:07:01.732 --> 05:07:06.585
so that when people see us, they know now we have created here

05:07:06.785 --> 05:07:09.517
the World of God.

05:07:12.227 --> 05:07:15.610
There are obstacles, there are problems

05:07:15.810 --> 05:07:19.342
whenever there is truth there is always

05:07:19.542 --> 05:07:23.938
somebody to come on you, no doubt

05:07:24.138 --> 05:07:27.204
but truth will be successful,

05:07:27.404 --> 05:07:30.457
it will be victorious, be sure of that!

05:07:30.657 --> 05:07:33.764
With that surety, if you work it out

05:07:33.964 --> 05:07:35.951
it is all going

05:07:36.151 --> 05:07:38.391
to overcome all these little little hurdles,

05:07:38.591 --> 05:07:41.044
little little incidents that you have faced

05:07:41.244 --> 05:07:43.419
in a very beautiful manner.

05:07:43.645 --> 05:07:45.969
So never forget the enjoyment of tonight

05:07:46.169 --> 05:07:48.392
whenever you are depressed think of that

05:07:48.592 --> 05:07:52.542
and just start saying that we are not

05:07:52.759 --> 05:07:55.890
living our thorns, we are flowers

05:07:56.090 --> 05:08:00.261
we are roses. That's you are, you are more than that.

05:08:00.731 --> 05:08:06.689
You are more than that - the whole atmosphere is fragrant by your goodness.

05:08:06.892 --> 05:08:10.943
So keep to that and enjoy yourself.

05:08:11.185 --> 05:08:15.219
There is no place for depression for all of us.

05:08:15.564 --> 05:08:18.819
How many people have such joy in their lives

05:08:19.019 --> 05:08:22.636
to think about the memories of these beautiful nights

05:08:22.862 --> 05:08:27.829
that we have spent together enjoying ourselves and enjoying everybody else

05:08:28.103 --> 05:08:32.152
without thinking about race and all that, about...

05:08:32.354 --> 05:08:37.740
... The power of God's Love is going to completely help us

05:08:37.974 --> 05:08:42.684
I assure you, and I verily say to you

05:08:42.884 --> 05:08:48.763
that good will be victorious righteous will be victorious

05:08:48.974 --> 05:08:53.459
and we establish a new style of life

05:08:53.659 --> 05:08:56.624
where there is no hatered , there is no killing

05:08:56.826 --> 05:09:01.191
there is no jealousy but all love and love and love.

05:09:01.357 --> 05:09:03.751
May God bless you.
