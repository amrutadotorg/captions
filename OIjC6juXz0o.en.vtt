00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.584
Today we are celebrating the resurrection
of Christ.

00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:40.797
With it we have to also celebrate
the resurrection of human beings,

00:01:40.998 --> 00:01:47.964
of Sahaja Yogis who have been resurrected
as realised souls.

00:01:49.746 --> 00:01:58.830
With that we have to understand that
we enter into a new awareness.

00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:04.108
There was no need for Christ to enter
into any new awareness,

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:09.751
He had to come down and again to show
to this world

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:20.984
that you are the eternal life, that you
lead a life

00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:26.304
that is spiritual, which never perishes.

00:02:26.505 --> 00:02:31.218
You have to rise into that new realm

00:02:32.322 --> 00:02:39.591
which is the realm of God Almighty,

00:02:40.714 --> 00:02:43.812
what you call ‘The Kingdom of God’.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:53.844
And He said it very clearly to Nicodemus
that, “You are to be born again.”

00:02:54.864 --> 00:03:01.136
And when he asked, “Am I to enter back
into my mother’s womb to be born again?”

00:03:01.337 --> 00:03:03.872
But He said it so clearly! It’s so clear.

00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:08.050
Those who don’t want to see can remain
blind!

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:14.650
But he said it very very clearly that,
“No,” that is,

00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:19.456
“whatever is born of the flesh is
the flesh,

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:25.984
but whatever is born of the Spirit
is the Spirit.”

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.952
I mean, nothing could be more clear
than that,

00:03:31.153 --> 00:03:36.366
that it has to be born of the Spirit.

00:03:37.191 --> 00:03:42.370
Of course, human beings have a special
capacity to twist everything around.

00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:46.024
For them Spirit could be a book, could be
some words,

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.904
could be an organisation, a church,

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:52.479
or some sort of a thing like that which
they have made.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.824
But whatever is man-made is not the Spirit,

00:03:59.025 --> 00:04:03.945
this is the clear statement of Christ,
which people wanted to avoid

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:10.132
and start their own organisations,
their own ideas

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:16.972
and created a very mythical thing
in His name.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:21.565
And now the time has come for it
to be blasted.

00:04:23.355 --> 00:04:27.281
It has been going on and on for thousands
of years,

00:04:27.482 --> 00:04:33.212
captured so many innocent people,
and people are into it.

00:04:34.269 --> 00:04:41.104
But when you are resurrected, when you
become realised souls,

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:51.713
one has to understand that now your
movement is inward,

00:04:51.914 --> 00:04:55.272
you are moving towards your roots
and not outside.

00:04:55.473 --> 00:05:05.960
So whatever was the endeavour before
realisation

00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:10.504
has to be changed, the direction has
to be changed,

00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:14.723
and that point mostly we miss.

00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:22.544
This is the thing, today, [that] I am
trying to explain to you.

00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:32.322
That, so far, to a human mind entertainment
was important; entertaining.

00:05:32.544 --> 00:05:36.315
To the mind, not to the Spirit.

00:05:36.516 --> 00:05:47.104
Entertainment to the Spirit is absolutely
opposite to the entertainment to the mind.

00:05:47.966 --> 00:05:53.001
Like somebody the other day telephoned
to me and said that,

00:05:53.202 --> 00:05:59.907
“Mother, there is no excitement
in Sahaja Yoga.”

00:06:04.946 --> 00:06:09.731
The excitement is too much.

00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:14.316
We are going against that.

00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:18.034
We are going towards peace, not towards
excitement

00:06:18.235 --> 00:06:22.504
and this kind of electric-shocks that we
require every time.

00:06:22.704 --> 00:06:28.824
You see, a drunkard – he’s all right in
the morning but evening-time he goes off,

00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:34.576
he needs a shock, a, some sort
of an injection into his body.

00:06:34.777 --> 00:06:42.927
All human enterprises have been like that.
They are to excite your body.

00:06:43.128 --> 00:06:49.021
Because if it is the dead you are dealing
with, then you have to excite it.

00:06:49.222 --> 00:06:53.366
But something that is living, that is
eternal,

00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:57.230
you have to enjoy it and not to excite it.

00:06:57.431 --> 00:07:04.019
So the direction has to be juxtaposition,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:09.702
and that is where many Sahaja Yogis
fail to understand.

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:15.341
How do we do it? Is the point.

00:07:15.542 --> 00:07:24.319
How do we make our attention move inward
instead of going outward?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:33.544
If you start from the time you are born
again, it is much easier,

00:07:33.745 --> 00:07:37.273
because it’s a new venture into [which]
you go in.

00:07:37.474 --> 00:07:43.984
That is the peace, peace of your Spirit,
the joy of your Spirit,

00:07:44.702 --> 00:07:47.393
which is permanent, you don’t need
any excitement from it,

00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:52.224
it is permanent, it is eternal.

00:07:54.465 --> 00:08:00.984
So the first thing that comes to our mind
is that whatever we do

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.984
before realisation we have not to do.

00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:14.976
The first and foremost thing is [that]
realisation comes to you effortlessly.

00:08:15.177 --> 00:08:20.540
So the effort which is built in your body
all the time, the energy of effort,

00:08:20.747 --> 00:08:24.569
“I must do this, I must do that, I have
to do this, I have to do that!”

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.824
That creates tension, that I have told you
already.

00:08:29.056 --> 00:08:33.952
So what do we do?

00:08:34.153 --> 00:08:45.518
We do not try to compete with others.

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:59.509
We do not try to fix certain timings,
dates, watches.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:04.873
We do not also put our attention

00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:12.783
into any endeavour which puts us
into effort,

00:09:12.984 --> 00:09:18.130
but we relax that attitude of effort.

00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:21.690
It’s called as, in Sanskrit, prayatna
shaithilya.

00:09:21.891 --> 00:09:29.311
For a western mind it’s very difficult
to grasp the subject so try to understand.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.054
That doesn’t mean lethargy, doesn’t
mean lethargy.

00:09:35.255 --> 00:09:43.110
One should never confuse with the dead,
the energy of the living.

00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:53.595
Now we are trying to transform our energies
towards the energy of the Spirit.

00:09:53.796 --> 00:09:58.920
So you have to allow the Spirit
to take over.

00:10:00.064 --> 00:10:04.555
Your effort of your mind should be reduced

00:10:04.756 --> 00:10:09.724
and the energy of the Spirit should work
through you.

00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:12.984
Now how do you do it?

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:25.287
First is detachment, detachment.

00:10:25.488 --> 00:10:31.969
Detachment start with the thought, let us
see the thought.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.522
It’s called as vichara shaithilya –
relaxation of the thought.

00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:40.940
Now a thought is coming into your mind,
some thought [like],

00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:45.023
“Today is Mother’s puja, let’s go. We have
to hurry up.” You see, “Must get this,

00:10:45.224 --> 00:10:49.181
you didn’t get the flowers, now you go
to the Third World and get the flowers.

00:10:49.382 --> 00:10:52.177
You must get this and you must get that”

00:10:52.378 --> 00:10:57.841
Second [thought] is: “No. Detach yourself.

00:11:01.576 --> 00:11:09.692
Witness. Leave it to the Spirit. Watch.”

00:11:09.893 --> 00:11:14.594
You’ll get it. Many of you have noticed
this.

00:11:14.795 --> 00:11:20.211
But still this mind, which is quite silly,
tries to impress upon you

00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:29.571
that you have to use the old junky
instrument of this mind.

00:11:29.772 --> 00:11:34.934
And it asserts that “Better use.” And when
you start using that,

00:11:35.135 --> 00:11:39.052
ego comes in, you get attached to it,

00:11:40.824 --> 00:11:47.942
and what you lose is your progress
and thus the joy is minimised.

00:11:48.143 --> 00:11:52.038
How do you detach yourself?

00:11:52.239 --> 00:11:55.681
For a person who is absolutely detached
is very difficult

00:11:55.882 --> 00:12:00.327
to explain how to detach, isn’t it?

00:12:01.075 --> 00:12:07.915
I’ll try! Now. I cannot get attached.
That’s the problem is.

00:12:11.413 --> 00:12:16.503
And I find it difficult to explain to you
in words which are human words,

00:12:16.704 --> 00:12:20.198
but still, I’ll try to say now.

00:12:23.615 --> 00:12:27.703
Say, I tried something as human beings do,
in the beginning,

00:12:27.904 --> 00:12:31.915
just to see how it works out; because I had
to experiment.

00:12:32.116 --> 00:12:38.365
For example, when I had to, say, attend
any puja or anything,

00:12:38.566 --> 00:12:44.795
I used to ask them, “What is the auspicious
time?”

00:12:46.251 --> 00:12:49.623
So they would tell me, “This is
the auspicious time.”

00:12:49.795 --> 00:12:53.066
And then another would telephone to say,
“This is the auspicious time.”

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:55.499
So I said, “How can there be two auspicious
times?”, you see,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.453
[it’s a] big problem with human beings.

00:12:57.654 --> 00:13:02.851
So they said, “There are 5 Panchangas
in India.”

00:13:03.052 --> 00:13:06.906
Means 5 books to consult the auspicious
time.

00:13:07.107 --> 00:13:10.693
That’s what human beings have done.
I said, “Then why consult?

00:13:10.894 --> 00:13:15.264
It’s better not to have 5 auspicious times,
isn’t it?”

00:13:15.465 --> 00:13:22.544
Then the auspicious time has to be
beyond time.

00:13:23.327 --> 00:13:28.803
But it is bound in the time the way human
beings have made it,

00:13:29.004 --> 00:13:33.339
so it is bound in the time. Like in India,
it is so much, so much, so much,

00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:38.692
but now, here (in London) it’s different.
Then you calculate, you have a watch.

00:13:38.893 --> 00:13:43.803
You see, to overcome all these hurdles
human beings also make certain devices.

00:13:44.004 --> 00:13:51.401
So you consult. “Now what is the auspicious
time here?” – leave at that time.

00:13:51.602 --> 00:13:58.699
Then it’s a big headache because there are
5 books to be consulted,

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.186
watch could be wrong, this could be wrong,
that could be so.

00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:10.783
But if you are the Spirit, then the Spirit
works out auspiciousness.

00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:14.224
It is the Spirit that works out
the auspiciousness.

00:14:14.393 --> 00:14:19.059
And imagine when you think like that,
how much tension goes out.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.064
First of all you have to be a slave
of the watch;

00:14:22.224 --> 00:14:24.758
another, you have to be the slave
of the books,

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:29.453
then you have to be the slave
of the market,

00:14:30.128 --> 00:14:35.508
of the room, of the place which you have
to hire.

00:14:35.722 --> 00:14:41.630
But supposing if you allow the Spirit
to work it out,

00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:46.090
then everything will work out. And you
will reach at the point

00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:49.624
when it is the most auspicious.

00:14:49.825 --> 00:14:55.664
So how do you accept it? Just by accepting.

00:14:56.984 --> 00:15:03.790
So, just now if you give up your satta,
your own domain,

00:15:03.991 --> 00:15:07.986
you get into the domain of your Spirit.

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:14.558
You give up your domain, that is your
ego’s domain,

00:15:14.759 --> 00:15:18.012
or may be your super-ego’s domain.
You give up that

00:15:18.213 --> 00:15:24.374
and try to see things how it works out.

00:15:24.575 --> 00:15:30.252
Now, what is the testing point of it?
How do you test it?

00:15:30.468 --> 00:15:37.168
It works out. That’s the point of testing.

00:15:37.833 --> 00:15:42.354
It works out. Allow it to work out.

00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:45.984
Don’t put your attention.

00:15:46.144 --> 00:15:50.131
Attention [word] has the second part of,
is the ‘tension’.

00:15:50.332 --> 00:15:55.570
And don’t try to say, “Why not today,
it should have happened today,

00:15:55.771 --> 00:16:00.603
we expected it to happen. Why not
at this moment?”

00:16:00.804 --> 00:16:07.200
That’s your ego. “Thy will be done”.

00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:17.042
So the thought that starts moving
in our mind

00:16:17.243 --> 00:16:23.388
all the time, which creates tensions is not
the thought of the Spirit.

00:16:23.589 --> 00:16:29.086
So, what you should say [is], “Not this
thought. Not this thought.”

00:16:29.287 --> 00:16:32.028
“Ya neti, neti wachane nigamor awachus”

00:16:32.229 --> 00:16:36.770
“Not this thought, not this thought,
not this thought”,

00:16:37.304 --> 00:16:40.544
and see how you relax. Now you are
relaxing -

00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:43.668
“Not this thought, not this thought”.

00:16:43.869 --> 00:16:48.681
Just go on refusing accepting any thought.

00:16:48.882 --> 00:16:55.251
So you go into Nirvichara. In that state
you feel the Spirit.

00:16:56.544 --> 00:17:01.701
Christ has done the greatest work on this,
I should say, but we do not understand

00:17:01.902 --> 00:17:08.103
because His life was like a micro-thing,
you see, 3 years.

00:17:08.304 --> 00:17:13.023
So we have to open it out a little bit
and see what He did.

00:17:13.224 --> 00:17:18.076
He has given us the greatest weapon
of forgiveness.

00:17:19.118 --> 00:17:23.948
When you forgive a person, what do you do?

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:31.567
You accept the situation, to begin with,
and secondly you forgive

00:17:33.308 --> 00:17:37.626
what you think has been done wrong to you.

00:17:37.827 --> 00:17:43.184
But because nothing can be done wrong
to your Spirit,

00:17:43.385 --> 00:17:46.984
you just forgive, because you are
the Spirit!

00:17:48.555 --> 00:17:55.478
And when you forgive, you have found
that your tension goes away.

00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:59.692
So even to your thoughts if you say,
“All right, forgive this thought,

00:17:59.893 --> 00:18:05.224
forgive this thought,” because thought is
also not to be punished.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.875
“Forgive this thought, forgive this
thought, forgive everything.”

00:18:10.076 --> 00:18:13.269
Not forget, forgive:

00:18:14.908 --> 00:18:19.672
because then you will even forget that
you are the Spirit!

00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:25.703
But “forgive all the thoughts that
are coming to me.”

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:30.070
Just go on saying this, is a mantra.
What is a mantra?

00:18:30.271 --> 00:18:38.621
Is that power of the word that expresses
Spirit.

00:18:40.013 --> 00:18:43.626
So this is a very important thing Christ
has given us:

00:18:43.827 --> 00:18:48.427
the weapon of forgiveness. Everybody
has that weapon,

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:54.267
everyone can use that weapon. You don’t
have to put in any effort for it,

00:18:54.468 --> 00:19:00.357
you don’t have to pay for it, it’s just you
have to say, “I forgive.”

00:19:00.558 --> 00:19:06.657
You’ll be amazed your nerves will soothe
down, this tension,

00:19:06.858 --> 00:19:14.230
this pressure of these modern things
will be reduced

00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:18.385
if you go on saying, “I forgive, I forgive
them”.

00:19:18.586 --> 00:19:23.703
For example, you go and see some sort of a…

00:19:23.904 --> 00:19:27.080
I mean, if you happen suddenly to see
something very filthy

00:19:27.281 --> 00:19:30.783
according to the Spirit.

00:19:30.984 --> 00:19:34.997
Maybe it is very exciting according
to normal human beings,

00:19:35.198 --> 00:19:41.198
but we are abnormal people and for us
if we find it rather ugly

00:19:41.399 --> 00:19:44.399
then the best thing is, to get over,
is to say, “I forgive,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:50.111
because they are ignorant, they are blind,
they are not yet there where I am.

00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:54.751
I am the one who is at the Source
of enjoyment,

00:19:54.952 --> 00:20:01.121
at the Source of peace and while these
are not, so I forgive.”

00:20:03.335 --> 00:20:08.995
And you’ll be amazed that this forgiveness
that Christ gives you

00:20:09.224 --> 00:20:16.860
works out vichara shaithilya, is
the relaxation of the thought.

00:20:19.675 --> 00:20:25.173
Now this opposite movement, that you have
to move,

00:20:25.374 --> 00:20:33.354
first of all should start at this point,
today, from forgiving others.

00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:40.534
Now what happens when you forgive someone?
That means you do not react.

00:20:40.735 --> 00:20:50.021
The power to react to somebody’s injuries,
insults is finished.

00:20:50.222 --> 00:20:55.367
And when that power is finished, you become
a powerful person,

00:20:55.568 --> 00:21:02.740
because nobody can now overpower you,

00:21:02.941 --> 00:21:07.650
because nobody can kill you, nobody can
hurt you,

00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:11.338
nobody can do anything to you.

00:21:11.967 --> 00:21:14.462
But it is not, again I’ll say,
shamelessness.

00:21:14.663 --> 00:21:19.348
You see, people can think that it is
shamelessness.

00:21:20.664 --> 00:21:26.037
So if somebody says to you something harsh

00:21:27.087 --> 00:21:32.286
and something that is wrong, you do not
accept it.

00:21:32.487 --> 00:21:35.561
But supposing I shout at someone,
the bhoots run away.

00:21:35.762 --> 00:21:39.147
You have seen that many-a-times, I have
to shout at people,

00:21:39.332 --> 00:21:43.346
so bhoots run away because they react,
and they just run away,

00:21:43.547 --> 00:21:47.870
but the Spirit shines through.

00:21:48.602 --> 00:21:56.249
So in Sahaja Yoga one has to understand
that it is just this central path,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:03.100
is just the balancing thing which is
important. It’s not an extreme of anything.

00:22:03.417 --> 00:22:07.166
Like when we go to say that you must
forgive everyone,

00:22:07.367 --> 00:22:12.547
it’s not going to that extreme where you
have done some wrong,

00:22:12.748 --> 00:22:17.505
and somebody says to you [and] you don’t
take that part of it, it doesn’t mean that.

00:22:17.706 --> 00:22:22.983
Again discretion is the engine of your
movement.

00:22:23.184 --> 00:22:27.410
So you have to see that, if they have
said it,

00:22:28.397 --> 00:22:34.544
something like that, “Is it? Have I gone
against the Spirit?”

00:22:34.767 --> 00:22:39.695
Otherwise, if I say to you something, you
will say, “All right, forgive Mother!”

00:22:39.896 --> 00:22:45.175
You see the point is? “Forgive Her
for saying so.” No.

00:22:47.172 --> 00:22:50.395
You cannot say that to Me!

00:22:51.875 --> 00:22:58.464
So then, that is the point [from which]
you start thinking,

00:22:59.709 --> 00:23:02.583
“Why Mother said so? What have I done?”

00:23:02.784 --> 00:23:05.476
Now think on those lines – so you start
moving again.

00:23:05.677 --> 00:23:12.314
It’s a very thin road on which you have
to walk.

00:23:12.515 --> 00:23:20.618
One side is the huge, big Gibraltar,
rock of Gibraltar, of your ego,

00:23:20.811 --> 00:23:23.906
the another side is a super-ego.

00:23:24.091 --> 00:23:29.183
In between is a small discretion path
going,

00:23:29.384 --> 00:23:32.994
on which you have to see both the sides,

00:23:33.195 --> 00:23:37.825
whether you are hitting yourself with
the rock of Gibraltar,

00:23:38.026 --> 00:23:42.958
or falling into the valley of super-ego,

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:47.378
you should see that you are using
your discretion.

00:23:47.579 --> 00:23:53.134
So the another thing one has to remember
[is] that whatever you were doing

00:23:53.335 --> 00:23:56.075
before realisation, is to go to extremes.

00:23:56.276 --> 00:24:01.352
For example now, you start some sort
of a movement.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.982
Say, you say, “We’ll have classical
things!” All right.

00:24:05.183 --> 00:24:09.367
Then you go so classical that it becomes
mechanical.

00:24:09.584 --> 00:24:11.960
Now you’ll say, “Give up! We’ll start
anti-culture”.

00:24:12.161 --> 00:24:15.270
So you go to another side that you become
primitive.

00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:19.137
Till you have reached the end of it and
learnt a lesson of your life,

00:24:19.338 --> 00:24:22.459
you do not return. But in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.261
it’s a very slippery road on which we are
walking,

00:24:28.134 --> 00:24:33.360
and there you have to see that it’s not
your ego and it is not your super-ego.

00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:37.821
So discretion has to be used very much,
and the balance,

00:24:38.022 --> 00:24:44.800
in this movement, which we need not use
otherwise.

00:24:45.001 --> 00:24:50.983
Till we are absolutely destroyed we can go
ahead with it, before realisation.

00:24:51.184 --> 00:24:55.632
But in Sahaja Yoga, as soon as you leave
your discretion,

00:24:55.832 --> 00:24:58.822
you fall this side or that side.

00:24:59.024 --> 00:25:03.742
Now those people who are of high quality

00:25:03.943 --> 00:25:09.144
Sahaja Yogis take to discretion first:
“How far to go?”

00:25:09.345 --> 00:25:14.034
Now for that Mother doesn’t have to say
because you are the Spirit.

00:25:14.235 --> 00:25:19.063
You yourself, you are the Spirit. First
of all assume your position as a Spirit,

00:25:19.264 --> 00:25:23.750
and then move with it, that you see,
discreetly,

00:25:23.951 --> 00:25:28.938
how far to go, how far not to go.

00:25:30.178 --> 00:25:34.863
Now that is one of the things: that you
have to become thoughtless

00:25:35.064 --> 00:25:41.092
by becoming a forgiving person.

00:25:41.293 --> 00:25:44.783
Most of the thoughts will drop out once
you become forgiving.

00:25:44.984 --> 00:25:48.209
But you cannot forgive some people,
like you cannot forgive God,

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:52.756
you cannot forgive Mother. Certain things
you cannot do,

00:25:52.933 --> 00:25:56.386
so the Maryadas must be seen.

00:25:57.764 --> 00:26:04.564
Now, in these boundaries if you walk
properly, you can go ahead.

00:26:05.554 --> 00:26:08.599
This is the thing which brings you
vichara shaithilya

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.548
or you can call – the mind becomes relaxed.

00:26:15.437 --> 00:26:18.198
Then you have to have vishayatha
shaithilya:

00:26:18.399 --> 00:26:22.983
means your organs, sense organs, always
react to things,

00:26:23.184 --> 00:26:26.783
because you are human beings, you see,
you are born like that.

00:26:26.984 --> 00:26:33.024
So, whatever happens you react.

00:26:33.225 --> 00:26:38.734
For example, you see a beautiful flower,
you react to it.

00:26:39.782 --> 00:26:43.272
Some sort of a thought rises with it.

00:26:45.137 --> 00:26:53.743
Now you must practice to see something
without allowing any thought to rise,

00:26:53.973 --> 00:26:58.162
then you start sucking through your Spirit

00:26:58.363 --> 00:27:06.290
the beauty, the glory, the fragrance
of a flower.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:14.984
Every flower is a poetry, but when you
start thinking about it

00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:21.743
then it becomes a dead thing. But you
just try to enjoy.

00:27:21.944 --> 00:27:28.804
Now you are the people who are
on this earth to enjoy yourself,

00:27:29.288 --> 00:27:33.754
not to worry about anything. Just enjoy!

00:27:33.955 --> 00:27:37.519
But if you are still used to,

00:27:38.964 --> 00:27:43.170
“I must do this thing special, I am
something special Sahaja Yogi,

00:27:43.371 --> 00:27:49.039
I’m a very highly evolved Sahaja Yogi”,
then you are finished.

00:27:50.472 --> 00:27:56.419
Say, we are all going in a boat, enjoy
the boat and also the waves.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:01.791
But somebody says, “I’m a very special one,
I’ll try to jump down,”

00:28:03.628 --> 00:28:08.355
then you are back again into the same
position.

00:28:08.556 --> 00:28:13.289
So one has to have an attitude
of looking at things.

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:20.336
Try to develop this habit of looking
at things without thinking about it.

00:28:20.537 --> 00:28:26.331
Try to develop your mind on those lines
that you do not react.

00:28:26.532 --> 00:28:34.857
Now this excitement business, or all this
sensationalisation that is today’s craze,

00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:38.902
comes from the same [source]: that
your sense organs

00:28:39.123 --> 00:28:43.524
require a kind of sensation because
they react.

00:28:43.725 --> 00:28:47.346
While we must have our sense organs
which do not react,

00:28:47.547 --> 00:28:52.281
because they must only react to the Spirit.

00:28:52.496 --> 00:29:00.884
So we have to develop a new type of sense
organs or a new quality of sense organs

00:29:01.085 --> 00:29:06.233
who do not react to outside excitement.

00:29:07.355 --> 00:29:11.323
Now if you want Sahaja Yoga to be
excitement, how can you do it?

00:29:11.524 --> 00:29:15.124
I mean just, it is just the opposite of it.

00:29:18.075 --> 00:29:22.120
So what you have to do is to see

00:29:22.321 --> 00:29:26.644
that your sex organs, say for example
your eyes,

00:29:27.121 --> 00:29:31.633
they see something then they react.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:36.419
Your ears, they hear something [and]
they react.

00:29:38.152 --> 00:29:44.840
Somebody wants to talk and see
the reaction –

00:29:45.698 --> 00:29:48.638
there are expectations (of a reaction).

00:29:51.184 --> 00:29:58.553
But because Spirit is active itself,

00:29:58.754 --> 00:30:04.329
it acts itself – you have seen vibrations
don’t speak, they act –

00:30:04.553 --> 00:30:10.837
It has the power to act, [so] you need
not react.

00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:22.706
If you can reduce the power of reaction
you rise much higher.

00:30:22.907 --> 00:30:29.426
This is a thing which one has to know
when now

00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:35.448
we are celebrating His resurrection:
because it is tapah,

00:30:35.649 --> 00:30:40.963
it is the penance of Christ. Christ came
on this earth for penance.

00:30:41.164 --> 00:30:46.809
You know in the Gayatri mantra, there are
7 things they have said [in] it,

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:52.341
and at the point of Christ it is tapah,
is the penance.

00:30:52.542 --> 00:30:58.348
So you have to have so-called penance
to achieve the joy.

00:30:58.549 --> 00:31:05.346
The penance is to pull back your sense
organs inside yourself.

00:31:05.547 --> 00:31:09.098
As Krishna has said that you have
to pull back

00:31:09.299 --> 00:31:17.057
all your limbs of sense organs like
a tortoise does.

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:26.147
So the excitement that you require

00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:33.003
for your sense organs is no more needed,

00:31:33.204 --> 00:31:42.068
because your sense organs, now, are
themselves the source of excitement.

00:31:44.802 --> 00:31:50.950
In the sense that they neutralise
all the excitements.

00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:58.045
You go to that point from where it starts.

00:31:59.747 --> 00:32:03.254
A river starts with a very small,
little drop,

00:32:03.455 --> 00:32:06.964
and then it expands, expands, expands,
expands.

00:32:07.165 --> 00:32:11.901
You go to the source, absolutely
to the central point,

00:32:13.051 --> 00:32:17.516
there you’ll find hardly even a drop falling on you.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:26.683
Another good example would be: a wheel
has the central point,

00:32:26.884 --> 00:32:30.793
and the wheel moves all the time but
the central point has to be fixed,

00:32:30.994 --> 00:32:36.975
otherwise the wheel, with the wheel
[if] that central point also moves,

00:32:37.183 --> 00:32:42.164
then the cart cannot move, [the] cart will
also start rolling down.

00:32:42.365 --> 00:32:48.384
So the central point has to be fixed
otherwise the wheel cannot move.

00:32:48.599 --> 00:32:54.389
So you go to that central point, and
the movement is on the central point

00:32:54.589 --> 00:33:02.088
where there is no movement, in a way,

00:33:02.289 --> 00:33:07.482
because there’s only ascent, there’s
no revolution.

00:33:07.683 --> 00:33:13.514
It doesn’t revolve any more, there’s just
ascent on the central point.

00:33:15.074 --> 00:33:21.021
I hope you try to understand that all
the movements come out of ignorance.

00:33:21.222 --> 00:33:28.226
All the outer movements come because we are
not yet on the central point.

00:33:28.427 --> 00:33:35.829
But that achievement is not difficult
because you have jumped onto it.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:42.323
But you again come out onto the periphery,
onto the wheel.

00:33:42.524 --> 00:33:47.423
So how to keep there, and to ascend
in that line?

00:33:47.624 --> 00:33:50.957
Say, for example, there are wheels
like this, wheels after wheels,

00:33:51.158 --> 00:33:57.284
but central point is fixed. Now every time
you jump out,

00:33:57.485 --> 00:34:01.371
now how do you go back to the central
point?

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:10.461
Is by detachment, by tapah, by penance.

00:34:10.678 --> 00:34:14.174
Penance is to deny.

00:34:16.336 --> 00:34:23.732
It doesn’t mean asceticism of outside
but asceticism of within.

00:34:26.385 --> 00:34:30.683
First of all we must learn to give,

00:34:33.834 --> 00:34:37.191
give to others.

00:34:38.931 --> 00:34:41.727
That also sometimes people find it
difficult, I have seen.

00:34:41.928 --> 00:34:44.204
Even to give £1, they said,

00:34:44.284 --> 00:34:48.637
for Sahaja Yoga people find it difficult.
I was amazed!

00:34:51.984 --> 00:34:57.947
So to give to others is going to be
even worse.

00:34:58.148 --> 00:35:03.417
Try to give to others. Detachment.

00:35:04.004 --> 00:35:12.562
So one way is to have forgiveness,

00:35:13.364 --> 00:35:18.472
then second is generosity.

00:35:22.906 --> 00:35:28.474
If you work for Sahaja Yoga: “I haven’t
done anything so far”.

00:35:28.728 --> 00:35:31.809
Not to react to it what work you have done.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:37.323
“Oh, it’s pleasure, I did it. It’s my
pleasure, I did it. Just out of pleasure”.

00:35:37.524 --> 00:35:43.832
Don’t count it; “I brought four flowers,
she brought two flowers.

00:35:44.713 --> 00:35:48.964
I must be paid for one and a half flower.”

00:35:49.165 --> 00:35:54.984
All these calculations are on
the periphery, outside,

00:35:55.185 --> 00:35:59.425
when you were not realised souls. Now
you just don’t count anything else,

00:35:59.626 --> 00:36:05.964
but your blessings. So you be generous.

00:36:06.491 --> 00:36:12.705
I have seen now people have different
attachments, subtler ones.

00:36:12.906 --> 00:36:17.668
Like attached to their own children.
I have seen people [like that].

00:36:17.869 --> 00:36:20.288
Once their children are born
to Sahaja Yogis,

00:36:20.489 --> 00:36:24.048
then the whole world becomes
their children:

00:36:24.637 --> 00:36:28.790
you spoil them, you spoil yourself.

00:36:28.991 --> 00:36:35.364
You are just their trustees.

00:36:35.982 --> 00:36:40.723
But to you it becomes a very big thing
that you have produced a child.

00:36:40.924 --> 00:36:44.537
Anybody can produce, even a dog produces
a child, what is so great?

00:36:44.738 --> 00:36:47.256
I mean, the bitch.

00:36:49.204 --> 00:36:52.547
That’s a funny word to say.

00:36:54.678 --> 00:36:59.805
So, to create a child is not something
great, but that you have a child

00:37:00.006 --> 00:37:06.599
in charge of you, which has to work
for God.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:11.241
You are just in charge. But to identify
that, “This child is great,

00:37:11.442 --> 00:37:15.348
he’s a very big realised soul” and all
that, you see,

00:37:15.549 --> 00:37:19.986
will blast your head completely, because
it is subtler blasting.

00:37:20.187 --> 00:37:22.923
It’s like hydrogen bomb.

00:37:23.124 --> 00:37:28.594
Ordinary bombs can destroy [a] part of it,
but these subtler bombs are even worse.

00:37:28.795 --> 00:37:33.124
And that will spoil the child, that will
spoil

00:37:33.325 --> 00:37:38.277
also you very much in your ascent.

00:37:38.478 --> 00:37:42.702
So what you have to do is to see that
if you have a child,

00:37:42.903 --> 00:37:46.167
all right, you are just in charge,

00:37:48.536 --> 00:37:54.268
as you are in charge of all the children
of Sahaja Yogis, not [just] of your own.

00:37:54.469 --> 00:37:59.101
Be generous! “Udaara charitraanam
Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam”:

00:37:59.302 --> 00:38:04.643
The person who is a generous person,
for him, the whole world is his family.

00:38:04.844 --> 00:38:10.225
So expand yourself. “This is my family,
this is my wife,

00:38:10.426 --> 00:38:15.397
how can I live without my wife, or
my husband, my child, my…”

00:38:15.598 --> 00:38:21.481
This will not help you, this will tie you
down completely.

00:38:21.682 --> 00:38:27.601
This is a very subtler thing you start,
because now you are receding back.

00:38:27.808 --> 00:38:30.508
First you gave up your family, gave up
your children,

00:38:30.717 --> 00:38:33.560
gave up everything, came to this extreme,
now you are going back.

00:38:33.761 --> 00:38:37.556
For Indians they understand that they are
already too much in it,

00:38:37.757 --> 00:38:40.146
so they know that to detach yourself from
your children

00:38:40.347 --> 00:38:43.481
is very important because they are
already in it.

00:38:43.682 --> 00:38:46.396
They are too much attached to their
children.

00:38:46.597 --> 00:38:49.044
In the beginning, they’ll always tell me,
“My child is like this,

00:38:49.204 --> 00:38:52.266
my mother is like this, my father is like
this, my brother is like this,

00:38:52.467 --> 00:38:58.003
improve my…” and they’ll be all bhoots,
one better than the other!

00:38:58.204 --> 00:39:01.124
Without any discretion, bring all those
relations on my head

00:39:01.284 --> 00:39:03.843
and I feel terrible about it.

00:39:04.044 --> 00:39:08.454
Even a farfetched relation of a relation
of a relation of a relation

00:39:08.655 --> 00:39:11.282
they will bring it along that, “You see,
she’s my relation”.

00:39:11.483 --> 00:39:16.134
So, in India it’s very important that you
are a relation of such and such person,

00:39:16.335 --> 00:39:18.695
and you may not have anything to do
with that person

00:39:18.896 --> 00:39:22.427
but he’s a relation, so “He is a relation.”

00:39:24.455 --> 00:39:28.735
So, what we understand is that
our relationships

00:39:28.936 --> 00:39:33.606
and our identifications have to be dropped
completely.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:38.874
We are universal beings now.

00:39:42.044 --> 00:39:47.502
So your child is a source of joy – every
child should be the source of joy to you,

00:39:47.703 --> 00:39:51.122
every child should be. Bachelors that way
are better,

00:39:51.323 --> 00:39:56.201
or the ones who are not yet married,
they can enjoy everybody’s child nicely.

00:39:57.044 --> 00:40:00.239
But, when you are not a mother and
a father,

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:03.210
if you are enjoying [other children],
what is so creditable?

00:40:03.411 --> 00:40:09.971
When you become the parents, and then
you enjoy other children

00:40:10.172 --> 00:40:15.594
as much as you enjoy your child, then
your generosity has started.

00:40:15.795 --> 00:40:23.173
So the generosity of loving others,
the generosity through compassion.

00:40:23.374 --> 00:40:27.392
Compassion doesn’t mean that you should
pity someone but compassion means

00:40:27.593 --> 00:40:36.044
the sharing of personality, sharing
of love personality.

00:40:36.245 --> 00:40:39.208
And that is where we miss the point,

00:40:39.409 --> 00:40:43.291
that compassion means if somebody
has to be helped.

00:40:43.492 --> 00:40:49.844
Sahaja Yoga compassion is not that,
Sahaja Yoga compassion is – it’s sharing.

00:40:51.469 --> 00:40:56.074
Now the fourth thing you have to remember.
What I have told you other?

00:40:56.275 --> 00:41:06.003
First is? Is the forgiveness. First!
According to Me is first is forgiveness.

00:41:06.204 --> 00:41:14.410
Second is, you can call it, the compassion,

00:41:14.611 --> 00:41:24.524
or the detachment leading to compassion.

00:41:25.448 --> 00:41:32.059
So you can call it the first one
as the forgiveness,

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:37.563
[then] detachment and thirdly
the compassion.

00:41:37.764 --> 00:41:46.280
These are the wheels of your chariot which
moves you.

00:41:46.481 --> 00:41:50.125
These are the wheels you should remember.

00:41:50.371 --> 00:41:52.723
Now,

00:41:57.817 --> 00:42:03.442
if you go further with it, with
the detachment,

00:42:03.643 --> 00:42:11.430
supposing works out in you, even you
become compassionate, even that comes.

00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:19.812
Still what is the judging point? How do you
know that you are all right?

00:42:20.013 --> 00:42:27.684
How do you measure? How do you find out
that you are all right?

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:33.163
I mean what you call the, take the bearing,
as they say, of the ship.

00:42:33.368 --> 00:42:42.275
How do you know? You must have peace,
you should be a peaceful person.

00:42:46.206 --> 00:42:49.861
Agitation should be outside,

00:42:52.283 --> 00:42:56.818
but you should be absolutely peaceful
person.

00:42:57.019 --> 00:43:00.237
If you are not a peaceful person,
then be sure

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:04.927
that you are not yet there where you should
have been.

00:43:05.281 --> 00:43:13.926
Now you can say that, “Christ also got
very angry,

00:43:14.148 --> 00:43:20.084
Hhe took a whip in His hand and beat
the people, so we can also do the same.”

00:43:20.285 --> 00:43:23.906
You are not Christ. You are not
an incarnation,

00:43:24.107 --> 00:43:27.364
you must know, you are a realised soul.

00:43:28.707 --> 00:43:33.202
So you don’t have to take a whip in your
hand and hit others. You cannot.

00:43:33.403 --> 00:43:37.833
This is the mistake what the disciples
of Mohammad Sahib have done,

00:43:38.034 --> 00:43:40.464
that they never thought that He was
an incarnation, you see.

00:43:40.665 --> 00:43:47.011
All the incarnations have killed. Krishna
has killed, Rama has killed,

00:43:47.212 --> 00:43:52.194
Devi has killed. But you are not the Devi!

00:43:52.395 --> 00:43:58.927
You are not Shri Krishna! So you don’t have
to kill anyone.

00:43:59.128 --> 00:44:03.763
You don’t have to show the temper.
So if you still have a temper

00:44:03.964 --> 00:44:10.105
then know that your progress is very slow.
You have to be a peaceful person.

00:44:10.306 --> 00:44:14.292
Imagine Sahaja Yogis having a Jihad.
What do you say to that?

00:44:14.493 --> 00:44:21.700
Going with swords in the hand and a spear
in the hand and hitting others.

00:44:25.125 --> 00:44:28.324
This point I want to make very clear
because when I am there,

00:44:28.525 --> 00:44:32.718
of course, I am going to tell you everyone,
but when I am not there

00:44:32.919 --> 00:44:39.877
I don’t want you to take in your hands
the swords and things and fight.

00:44:44.604 --> 00:44:47.504
What William Blake has written is
for the incarnation.

00:44:47.705 --> 00:44:51.404
The Incarnations say, “Give me my…”

00:44:52.031 --> 00:44:57.552
It’s not that you should say now,
“Give me Rama’s Ayudhas.”

00:44:57.753 --> 00:45:01.310
You cannot use. You are not an incarnation.

00:45:01.511 --> 00:45:09.013
Because the discretion of these are
effective – yours are not.

00:45:13.764 --> 00:45:21.620
So you are not to take any weapon
into your hand or even anger.

00:45:22.448 --> 00:45:30.050
Doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi at any point,
unless and until I tell you to be angry.

00:45:33.044 --> 00:45:40.315
So this is the criteria, that you have to be
a peaceful person, not aggressive person.

00:45:42.405 --> 00:45:46.350
Now different people have different type
of aggressiveness.

00:45:46.551 --> 00:45:49.841
For example, men would start… men don’t
discuss, you see,

00:45:50.042 --> 00:45:53.520
they just slap you – finished. They
don't argue, they don’t like to argue,

00:45:53.721 --> 00:45:57.861
at a point they’ll go and they’ll just
hit you out and finished.

00:45:58.062 --> 00:46:03.345
But women are very good at argument,
and very aggressive,

00:46:03.546 --> 00:46:10.844
very aggressively argumentative. So you
don’t argue: is the second point.

00:46:11.728 --> 00:46:17.844
If you are argumentative then know that you
are not yet there where you have to be.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:23.241
A peaceful person goes to a point and then
argues it out.

00:46:23.526 --> 00:46:28.644
If you are argumentative then your progress
is not all right.

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:38.749
So a person has to be absolutely peaceful

00:46:40.308 --> 00:46:47.544
and this peace is the most effective thing.
We are seeking the peace of the universe:

00:46:47.884 --> 00:46:53.483
you cannot achieve it through any one
of these bombs,

00:46:53.684 --> 00:47:00.717
you can only achieve it through the Spirit
which is the source of all the peace.

00:47:03.388 --> 00:47:09.343
So, I would request all of you to give up
tempers, angers.

00:47:09.544 --> 00:47:15.361
Peace is the greatest powerful thing
on this earth.

00:47:15.893 --> 00:47:18.472
There’s a story, a Chinese story,
interesting, about it.

00:47:18.673 --> 00:47:26.545
There were two very great fighting cocks,
you see, known to be the greatest of all.

00:47:26.746 --> 00:47:32.144
And they have this, you see, excitement
again of the cock-fighting in China.

00:47:32.345 --> 00:47:36.643
I mean, you can have of everything in this
world, all absurd things,

00:47:36.844 --> 00:47:41.781
like rugby, football, this, that, I mean,
there’s no end to it!

00:47:41.982 --> 00:47:52.604
So these, these two cocks were to go in for
an international sort of a fight, I think.

00:47:52.805 --> 00:47:55.426
So they said, “There is one great saint
living here,

00:47:55.627 --> 00:48:00.230
he makes everyone very powerful.”
So the owner of the cocks went to him

00:48:00.431 --> 00:48:04.677
and he said, “Will you make my these
two cocks very powerful,

00:48:04.878 --> 00:48:09.643
so that they can fight, they can fight
and win?”

00:48:09.844 --> 00:48:14.335
He said, “All right, it’s very simple.
All right, you leave them with me.”

00:48:15.964 --> 00:48:19.187
So after a month when he appeared
to take the cocks,

00:48:19.388 --> 00:48:23.804
they would not react to anything, they
were just standing like this, watching.

00:48:24.664 --> 00:48:26.964
He got a fright of his life, he said,
“How are they going to fight?”

00:48:27.165 --> 00:48:30.710
He said, “You just take them, you’ll see.”

00:48:30.911 --> 00:48:35.444
So he took them to the arena and put them
there,

00:48:35.785 --> 00:48:39.295
and all the cocks, you see, invaded
each other, fought.

00:48:39.496 --> 00:48:43.056
These they were just watching, these two
were watching!

00:48:44.432 --> 00:48:48.597
And all the rest of them got so frightened
with these two, they all ran away -

00:48:48.798 --> 00:48:51.611
and they won!

00:48:53.275 --> 00:48:59.587
So the person who is peaceful is
the powerful [one].

00:48:59.788 --> 00:49:05.000
The one who does not react to anything
else, is the most powerful.

00:49:09.354 --> 00:49:15.472
So, one has to understand that peace
is the criteria to know

00:49:15.673 --> 00:49:24.145
that you are absolutely at that point
where you have to be.

00:49:24.346 --> 00:49:27.563
But peace by no chance means cowardliness.

00:49:27.764 --> 00:49:31.358
Because, you see, I know what indiscretion
is, human indiscretion.

00:49:31.559 --> 00:49:38.071
They think then cowardliness. No. You stand
like this - not like this.

00:49:38.272 --> 00:49:42.763
The difference between a peaceful person
and a cowardly person is

00:49:42.964 --> 00:49:47.763
that a cowardly person acts to the negative
forces,

00:49:47.963 --> 00:49:53.493
and a peaceful person creates positive
forces, constructive forces.

00:49:53.694 --> 00:49:56.069
Generates it.

00:50:00.686 --> 00:50:04.202
So you are not to be cowardly, but you
have to be peaceful.

00:50:04.403 --> 00:50:10.696
And a peaceful person is like a magnet,
you see, so soothing it is.

00:50:10.964 --> 00:50:17.781
So you can see now we are moving towards
the soothing qualities of the Spirit.

00:50:17.982 --> 00:50:23.185
We have to soothe others, and not
to excite, but to soothe.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:34.591
And that soothing quality, what you call,
is, we call it like the ghee:

00:50:34.792 --> 00:50:40.964
when the body is charred and is absolutely
burning,

00:50:41.165 --> 00:50:50.054
then you put some sort of a ghee on it
so it becomes smooth,

00:50:50.255 --> 00:50:58.929
like lubrication, [a] lubricant. Such
a personality is a lubricant.

00:50:59.421 --> 00:51:06.483
It doesn’t go into friction, but reduces
frictions.

00:51:06.684 --> 00:51:09.502
It’s a lubricant temperament.

00:51:09.703 --> 00:51:13.964
So you should judge yourself, “Am I
a lubricant personality?”

00:51:14.165 --> 00:51:19.449
For example, you see two persons
are fighting, all right?

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:23.264
And one goes as a peace-maker;

00:51:24.364 --> 00:51:28.514
and one goes to excite it more, you see,
he joins them.

00:51:28.715 --> 00:51:31.600
Now the one who is the peacemaker
is the blessed one,

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:40.611
is the one who is the one moving towards
God because he is the peacemaker.

00:51:41.046 --> 00:51:45.262
“Blessed are those who are
the peacemakers.”

00:51:45.463 --> 00:51:48.933
All these things if you see are, what I am
telling today is the same –

00:51:49.134 --> 00:51:52.976
but in a different language, that’s all –
what Christ said it.

00:51:53.177 --> 00:51:55.452
To understand Christ you have to open
Him out more,

00:51:55.653 --> 00:52:00.430
because He said it in very simple words,
which has very deep meanings

00:52:00.631 --> 00:52:04.213
and only a Sahaja Yogi can understand Him.

00:52:06.281 --> 00:52:09.841
So you have to make peace.

00:52:10.524 --> 00:52:16.449
I have seen people been given Nobel prizes
of peace, who have no peace within at all.

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:23.072
They are hot-tempered, horrible people and
given Nobel prize for peace! All right.

00:52:23.495 --> 00:52:29.761
And personified temper, absolutely
hot-tempered; and you call it peace!

00:52:29.962 --> 00:52:34.964
How can you have peace with a person
who is so hot-tempered?

00:52:35.165 --> 00:52:40.662
So this is possible. In this human
endeavour anything is possible, you see.

00:52:40.863 --> 00:52:44.197
It’s sometimes so absurd, you see.

00:52:44.398 --> 00:52:51.264
Like I have seen people getting a degree,
“doctorate of learning”,

00:52:51.465 --> 00:52:56.125
who has not even been to a school, who
doesn’t know how to read the book!

00:52:56.684 --> 00:53:01.108
Anything is possible because it is just
a maneuvering of everything,

00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:04.227
it’s so artificial.

00:53:08.131 --> 00:53:20.003
So the lubrication of your love, the love.

00:53:20.204 --> 00:53:23.875
So the love that you enjoy is not what
is bestowed upon you,

00:53:24.076 --> 00:53:27.723
but what you bestow upon others.

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:31.763
The idea of love is also funny.

00:53:31.964 --> 00:53:36.604
It’s just the opposite of what you have
seen so far.

00:53:38.489 --> 00:53:41.764
They’ll write, “I love you”, all right?

00:53:41.965 --> 00:53:45.804
And the second sentence will be,
“I want to divorce you.”

00:53:48.656 --> 00:53:51.252
And the modern fashion is like that.
“I love you;

00:53:51.453 --> 00:53:55.720
I want to divorce you because I love you
too much!”

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:11.125
“Because I want to spare you!” Is very
modern, very sophisticated it is.

00:54:13.476 --> 00:54:19.816
So the love that hurts others, love that
tortures others,

00:54:20.348 --> 00:54:23.996
the love that expects, is not love.

00:54:24.454 --> 00:54:31.859
Love that just flows, just forgives,
is just compassion,

00:54:32.059 --> 00:54:35.835
is the most enjoyable thing.

00:54:36.279 --> 00:54:41.495
Radiant, just like the sunshine,
like Christ

00:54:41.696 --> 00:54:49.764
who even forgave those who crucified Him!
Imagine! Imagine!

00:54:53.076 --> 00:54:57.483
Because He knew that God will not forgive.
Even God will not forgive those –

00:54:57.684 --> 00:55:00.964
He tried to forgive them.

00:55:05.262 --> 00:55:08.355
But we, those who call themselves
Christians,

00:55:08.556 --> 00:55:12.884
those who are supposed to be Christians
are just the opposite of Christ,

00:55:13.085 --> 00:55:20.016
just the opposite in every way, if you see,
just the opposite.

00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:27.285
So, you come to a point where you
understand that you become the love.

00:55:28.406 --> 00:55:32.636
And when it is pure love relationships,

00:55:32.837 --> 00:55:39.938
then there is no lust and greed or
anything, but just love and purity of love.

00:55:40.345 --> 00:55:47.239
You don’t want to do it  because you
want to have

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:51.806
any lust out of that person. Just see,
the opposite.

00:55:52.007 --> 00:55:57.887
Here the girl is very ‘attractive’. What is
so attractive?

00:55:58.088 --> 00:56:05.580
They, to my eyes they look like mosquitoes;
Horrible! Sometimes like witches, you know.

00:56:05.781 --> 00:56:10.121
Their nails and all that look like, to me,
like witches: so artificial.

00:56:10.322 --> 00:56:13.196
Just like machines, sometimes.

00:56:13.397 --> 00:56:18.803
What is so attractive in these women?
Or in these men? You see.

00:56:19.004 --> 00:56:23.699
They look like skulls to me, sometimes and
sometimes like, Frankenstein

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:28.455
I don’t know what they look like, horrible.
The way they walk,

00:56:28.656 --> 00:56:33.124
the way they try to impress. I mean,
nothing but fear comes out of them.

00:56:33.325 --> 00:56:38.398
So, what you emit out of your love
to others

00:56:38.599 --> 00:56:43.015
[is] a sense of security, an ocean
of security you can call it.

00:56:45.368 --> 00:56:50.008
Everyone feels secured, secured with you.

00:56:51.317 --> 00:56:57.857
And that security will be felt by you.

00:56:58.884 --> 00:57:06.403
Trust, trust others. You must trust.
That is very important.

00:57:06.604 --> 00:57:11.392
Trust for everything. I have seen some
people are very serious on money,

00:57:11.593 --> 00:57:17.643
some are very serious about possessions,
some are this. I know they…

00:57:17.844 --> 00:57:21.588
they are sometimes weak people.

00:57:22.646 --> 00:57:25.957
Could be weak about money, could be
weak about possessions,

00:57:26.158 --> 00:57:30.191
could be even insulting to things that
should not be so:

00:57:30.392 --> 00:57:37.406
but don’t lose your temper, just have
forgiveness for them,

00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:43.108
and let them feel secured, absolutely
secured. Trust.

00:57:43.309 --> 00:57:48.604
You see, as you know that I never ask
the trustees to give me any reports.

00:57:48.764 --> 00:57:53.884
I do not ask them to give me any – what you
call - the accounts or anything.

00:57:53.964 --> 00:57:56.727
I don’t understand accounts at all myself,
you see.

00:57:56.928 --> 00:58:00.227
So I never see how many accounts you
have got, what money you have got

00:58:00.428 --> 00:58:03.929
or, say, supposing Gavin is saying that,
“I am sending money now, Mother, to you,”

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:06.194
whatever I receive, iIt’s all right –
finished.

00:58:06.395 --> 00:58:08.548
I don’t know whether he gives you
receipts or not, nothing.

00:58:08.749 --> 00:58:11.049
If he says so [it’s] all right. I leave it
to him.

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:14.483
He has to grow, whatever it is. It is
his responsibility,

00:58:14.684 --> 00:58:19.382
if he’s not grown up enough he’ll grow.
So trust others because in Sahaja Yoga

00:58:19.583 --> 00:58:23.244
you must know we are all growing, we are
all transforming.

00:58:23.445 --> 00:58:27.826
So we must grow, we must grow
and for growth

00:58:28.027 --> 00:58:31.918
security is the most important thing.

00:58:32.119 --> 00:58:36.884
If there is no security for a tree it will
never grow.

00:58:37.085 --> 00:58:43.552
So everybody should feel secured
in the company of Sahaja Yogis.

00:58:44.871 --> 00:58:50.534
If there is any insecurity from someone
then it should be reported

00:58:50.735 --> 00:58:56.772
to the collective and [you] should see that
all such cases of insecurity creating,

00:58:56.973 --> 00:59:02.475
trouble creators should be, little bit,
taken out for the time being.

00:59:02.676 --> 00:59:04.511
Because there should be a healthy growth.

00:59:04.712 --> 00:59:08.516
But growth must take place and for that
you must trust.

00:59:08.717 --> 00:59:11.124
Somebody might make mistakes – all right,
doesn’t matter.

00:59:11.325 --> 00:59:16.572
Somebody may be dishonest – doesn’t matter.
But give them security.

00:59:18.894 --> 00:59:22.964
But what we do is to give security
to bhoots, I have seen, [it’s] very common.

00:59:23.165 --> 00:59:27.402
People will have only interest
in the bhootish people.

00:59:28.076 --> 00:59:31.555
They will trust a bhootish people than to
trust a person who is a little dishonest.

00:59:31.756 --> 00:59:34.071
Doesn’t matter. You see, what is
dishonesty?

00:59:34.272 --> 00:59:36.483
Supposing somebody doesn’t give income
tax, doesn’t matter,

00:59:36.684 --> 00:59:40.293
it is this government, or it’s that
government. What does it matter to us?

00:59:40.494 --> 00:59:44.713
As long as that person is honest to God
it’s sufficient.

00:59:44.919 --> 00:59:49.517
Our honesty is of a different level. So we
become angry with that person,

00:59:49.718 --> 00:59:54.648
we get upset with that person. There’s
nothing to get angry.

00:59:54.849 --> 00:59:58.789
Actually my system as you know is that
I know also that people

00:59:58.990 --> 01:00:03.674
who have mismanaged money, who have
not been all right, I know it, somehow,

01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:07.046
without knowing accounts. But I said,
“Just forgive, forgive, forgive”.

01:00:07.223 --> 01:00:12.083
I know everything but I just say,
“Forgive, doesn’t matter.”

01:00:13.229 --> 01:00:16.359
Then, you might say, with rationality,
that, “Mother, such a person

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.474
will go ahead with it”. No he won’t!
You try and trust.

01:00:21.807 --> 01:00:27.423
Why? Because they are growing, they are
coming to light

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:34.635
and the more light they see the better they
become. This trust has to be there.

01:00:36.075 --> 01:00:41.288
Trusting in God that He will give him
the right path.

01:00:43.497 --> 01:00:50.362
So this understanding about your growth

01:00:51.738 --> 01:00:57.248
is within yourself, which you can see.

01:00:57.449 --> 01:01:01.600
And the highest of all is the collectivity.

01:01:01.801 --> 01:01:05.838
Not the fraternity of bhoots, but
collectivity.

01:01:06.044 --> 01:01:13.450
Again discretion has to be used – how far
you are collective.

01:01:14.316 --> 01:01:17.681
If a person thinks he is a very great
person and he can correct everyone

01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:23.966
and he can punish everyone and do
as he likes, then he is not collective.

01:01:24.167 --> 01:01:28.343
But sometimes you have to also understand
that even with bhootish people

01:01:28.544 --> 01:01:34.520
I have to stoop down to conquer them,
to bring them up.

01:01:36.634 --> 01:01:44.283
Don’t become like them, try to elevate them
than to go down to their level.

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:48.604
And if you can manage that, then you have
achieved

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:52.808
what you wanted to do through
your collectivity.

01:01:53.472 --> 01:01:57.890
And a person has to be collective. If he is
not collective

01:01:58.091 --> 01:02:03.836
then one must know that there’s something
definitely wrong with that person.

01:02:08.095 --> 01:02:17.488
Then what you have to do after detachment
from things [is] the penance part of it.

01:02:17.689 --> 01:02:21.158
For this we have to be doing some penance.

01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:25.745
For example if you are too much attached
to anything: say you are fond of food.

01:02:25.946 --> 01:02:30.361
Many people are, I know that. The tongue
is the worst of all.

01:02:30.562 --> 01:02:33.638
If you can control tongue you have
controlled at least 50%

01:02:33.839 --> 01:02:37.684
of your sense organs. If you are attached
to the tongue [you should say,]

01:02:37.885 --> 01:02:41.230
“These days I am going into a big penance,
I am eating just boiled food

01:02:41.431 --> 01:02:46.400
without salt, without anything in it,
just boiled food. Going into penance.

01:02:46.601 --> 01:02:51.183
I have to! For 9 months.”

01:02:51.384 --> 01:02:56.561
For me it doesn’t matter. It’s no penance
for me because I’ve no tongue at all,

01:02:56.762 --> 01:03:01.854
no taste buds, [so] I can manage.
So whatever you like too much,

01:03:02.055 --> 01:03:05.159
“Ahaa! I love to have something.” You see,
specially here I’ve seen

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.150
if you see good food or anything – “Mmmm…”

01:03:12.263 --> 01:03:18.444
Now, it’s as cold as ice. Should I have it?
I can if you want,

01:03:18.645 --> 01:03:22.817
but it’s rather cold, I think you would
like to give me hot. All right.

01:03:23.018 --> 01:03:25.861
I don’t mind having it. All right.

01:03:26.062 --> 01:03:38.684
So now what you have to do is have a kind
of self-directed discipline.

01:03:38.885 --> 01:03:45.511
Self-directed. Not on others.
Self-directed.

01:03:47.148 --> 01:03:51.873
“Do I meditate in the morning? I don’t.
So what’s wrong with me?

01:03:52.074 --> 01:03:55.290
I’m supposed to be a Sahaja Yogi.”

01:03:57.048 --> 01:04:03.580
Don’t have - nobody has to tell you.
You yourself should do this to yourself.

01:04:03.781 --> 01:04:07.008
You are fond of food? “All right, doesn’t
matter, I’ll fast for two days”.

01:04:07.209 --> 01:04:09.613
No fasting is allowed in Sahaja Yoga,
all right,

01:04:09.814 --> 01:04:12.284
but fasting for detachment is all right,

01:04:12.444 --> 01:04:16.583
not for God’s Sake, but for your sake
you do it.

01:04:16.844 --> 01:04:21.444
“I like a particular type of cake.
All right, I’ll not have it.

01:04:21.652 --> 01:04:24.422
I’ll not have it for one year”. But no,
people have to give up,

01:04:24.623 --> 01:04:28.309
then they’ll give up something like
Rhubarb! [a bitter vegetable]

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:41.140
So one should not be cunning about it, you
see, should not be cunning with yourself.

01:04:41.341 --> 01:04:43.972
So what you have to do is to see that,

01:04:44.149 --> 01:04:48.193
“Where does this mind go? What is
the attraction?”

01:04:48.394 --> 01:04:52.477
I mean, even now, I find some people are
like Romeo - Juliets, you see,

01:04:52.678 --> 01:04:58.844
still living in that area of Romeo Juliet-
ness. Get out of it! [It’s] Nonsense.

01:05:03.061 --> 01:05:07.083
Get out of that kind of a thing. That
doesn’t mean you become [a] dry personality

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:12.213
of another extreme, can be, that you just
become like sticks, that’s not the point.

01:05:12.414 --> 01:05:18.014
But you should not indulge into
these things.

01:05:18.974 --> 01:05:21.840
These are all artificial things.

01:05:22.041 --> 01:05:27.847
So a tapah is to be established within
yourself. Self-discipline.

01:05:28.048 --> 01:05:32.581
Now those who talk too much should stop
talking, absolutely mauna is the ilaaj.

01:05:32.782 --> 01:05:37.515
Mauna is the treatment for such people.
Just don’t talk!

01:05:37.716 --> 01:05:44.031
Those who do not talk, most of the English
men don’t talk, women talk too much.

01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:49.465
It’s a fact. I’ve seen – any interview,
you see, the woman will talk first.

01:05:49.666 --> 01:05:51.604
This [police] constable lady died, [and]
her mother was talking!

01:05:51.764 --> 01:05:54.498
In India a mother would not be
in a position to talk, you know.

01:05:54.699 --> 01:05:57.681
The father was sitting quietly. You just
can’t imagine.

01:05:57.882 --> 01:06:00.684
In India supposing a child dies like that,
you see,

01:06:00.764 --> 01:06:04.584
the mother would be absolutely sobbing,
in a mess, she won’t be talking.

01:06:04.785 --> 01:06:07.223
Here the woman was talking, we were
so surprised!

01:06:07.424 --> 01:06:10.690
You see, the women talk too much [here],

01:06:10.891 --> 01:06:16.604
men just don’t talk, they are not supposed
to talk, I think, they just keep quiet.

01:06:16.805 --> 01:06:20.722
At the most they might be slapping.
I don’t know what they do.

01:06:23.084 --> 01:06:26.489
So what we have to do is to teach ourselves

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:31.819
that, if our tongue talks too much, then we
better keep quiet.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:36.754
If we do not talk, we better talk, we
should teach ourselves how to talk.

01:06:36.955 --> 01:06:39.718
Now go and talk to the sea, go and talk
to some tree,

01:06:39.919 --> 01:06:47.262
go and talk to someone like that. Or best
is to talk to me, to my photograph.

01:06:47.463 --> 01:06:53.325
So that’s how you achieve a kind
of a control over your tongue.

01:06:53.526 --> 01:06:58.683
To talk sweetly. Some people have to go
through penance for that.

01:06:58.884 --> 01:07:06.880
For them to talk sweetly is like taking
rhubarb again

01:07:07.081 --> 01:07:11.354
They just can’t talk sweetly, just can’t.
Sarcasm.

01:07:11.555 --> 01:07:20.175
You see, in that sarcasm they have
a special pleasure.

01:07:20.907 --> 01:07:26.067
Try to say something sweetly. You can be
humorous without being sarcastic.

01:07:26.268 --> 01:07:30.413
Humour is the best way. What is the need
to be sarcastic?

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:34.148
There’s no need at all. Is a sign
of cowardliness, I think, sarcasm,

01:07:34.349 --> 01:07:38.629
is a sign that you want to hurt others,
but you are not straightforward.

01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:41.982
So try to avoid sarcastic talking.

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:46.837
If you are sarcastic, better tell your
tongue to behave itself.

01:07:47.345 --> 01:07:52.286
So, little disciplining towards yourself,
punishment what you call,

01:07:52.487 --> 01:07:56.378
or the tapah, the penance has to work out.

01:07:56.579 --> 01:08:00.175
Now people have so many ways of, you see,
seeing things.

01:08:00.376 --> 01:08:05.060
Some men want to see women all the time,
some women want to see men all the time

01:08:05.261 --> 01:08:09.691
or clothes or anything, you see.
Now, the difference is that

01:08:09.892 --> 01:08:13.530
when you see something, it reacts.

01:08:13.731 --> 01:08:21.350
The difference between my looking
at anything is that, that reacts.

01:08:24.626 --> 01:08:29.920
When I look at you, your Kundalini reacts,
when I look at this, it gets vibrated.

01:08:30.121 --> 01:08:37.411
Kataksha, kataksha: Every eye… -
Kataksha, what is… -

01:08:37.612 --> 01:08:42.333
every glance, every glance

01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:49.496
makes the thing react. And nirikshana
means, I know what it is.

01:08:49.697 --> 01:08:52.750
I know what it is. Just looking at a person
I know what it is.

01:08:52.951 --> 01:08:56.807
Looking at a thing, I know what it is -
nirikshana.

01:08:57.008 --> 01:08:59.794
And the whole thing is in the memory
there, you see.

01:08:59.995 --> 01:09:03.418
Like, we were going and they said
we have only black stones.

01:09:03.619 --> 01:09:06.142
I said, “No, you have red also.” He said,
“Where do you know?”

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:08.564
So I told them [the] exact spot where
to get the red stones.

01:09:08.765 --> 01:09:11.600
They said, “How do you know, Mother?”
I said, “We passed that way

01:09:11.801 --> 01:09:14.214
about eight days back and I know there
are red stones.”

01:09:14.415 --> 01:09:21.467
So everything I see gets vibrated and also
I note

01:09:21.668 --> 01:09:29.787
what is there, and is all ready there to be
used at a proper time.

01:09:30.463 --> 01:09:37.558
But what do I do? What do I do?
I do nothing.

01:09:40.118 --> 01:09:47.845
I do nothing. I don’t think, I don’t plan.
Everything that you do, I don’t do.

01:09:51.366 --> 01:09:59.365
So when you have that kind of a temperament
you’ll be amazed,

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.876
the amount of dynamism that will work
it out.

01:10:04.077 --> 01:10:11.027
You don’t have to create a dynamo, it’s
inside you. Let it work it out.

01:10:11.514 --> 01:10:15.833
Today I had told Gavin that I won’t have
so much of a puja but I’ll talk.

01:10:16.034 --> 01:10:19.676
Because puja is all right, it talks
for itself and this thing.

01:10:19.877 --> 01:10:25.270
But I wanted to talk to you because now
the time has come for us to go further.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:30.447
As a result of all this, all this, that
when you do [it],

01:10:30.648 --> 01:10:35.491
you become the Truth, you become the Truth.

01:10:38.836 --> 01:10:43.655
So, in every chakra if you concentrate,
and use the chakra

01:10:43.856 --> 01:10:49.853
to detach yourself from the particular
quality of that chakra.

01:10:50.054 --> 01:10:55.583
Like, now for example, the Nabhi chakra
does the digestion.

01:10:56.236 --> 01:11:01.642
Now you don’t worry what you should
eat to digest.

01:11:01.843 --> 01:11:06.130
Just detach yourself from there, with
vibrations, if you just see and eat

01:11:06.331 --> 01:11:10.797
whatever is there, you will digest.

01:11:13.439 --> 01:11:19.382
And then you become the Truth. Truth
that is love, that is God.

01:11:19.747 --> 01:11:22.667
May God Bless you all.

01:11:41.318 --> 01:11:46.926
Shri Mataji: Yes. Gavin, what – you have
all the arrangements from the company…

01:11:47.127 --> 01:11:51.071
whatever I like.
Gavin: Whatever You want.

01:11:53.592 --> 01:11:55.936
Of course I’ve told you about the egg now,

01:11:56.137 --> 01:12:04.253
now you have become the chickens already.
Only you have to grow, that’s all.

01:12:05.827 --> 01:12:09.741
Breaking so many eggs every day, isn’t it?

01:12:12.568 --> 01:12:15.698
Easter is something like our birthday
we celebrate;

01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:23.272
when we became a bird out of the cage,
of the shell.

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:29.666
So Easter is our birthday we
are celebrating, of our Realization,

01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:33.527
and every day we must grow with
our birthday.

01:12:33.728 --> 01:12:41.807
While in a human form you decrease your
age, as your birthday comes in,

01:12:42.008 --> 01:12:49.051
but with this you increase your age, and
you are proud that you are growing.

01:12:49.252 --> 01:12:55.062
On a human level you feel unhappy that
you are growing.

01:12:55.691 --> 01:12:58.304
Here you feel proud that you are growing.

01:12:58.505 --> 01:13:05.205
Just the opposite of what you are doing
if you try to do it, it will be nice.

01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:10.237
I mean, that doesn’t mean again indiscreet,
you know?

01:13:10.438 --> 01:13:13.684
I’m quite worried on that point.

01:13:13.885 --> 01:13:17.777
Discretion is the first thing that you
should have before you.

01:13:17.978 --> 01:13:20.177
Now if you have any questions you can
ask Me,

01:13:20.378 --> 01:13:25.419
for about five, ten minutes till I take My
tea and then we’ll have a little puja.

01:13:29.896 --> 01:13:36.327
…questions have it before the puja, and
then - or after the puja is better

01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:41.271
whatever you say. Yogi: After, Mother.

01:13:41.472 --> 01:13:46.445
Shri Mataji: Eh? After. Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: All right.
