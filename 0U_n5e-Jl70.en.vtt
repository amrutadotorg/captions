00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.120
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.040
The truth can be realized

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.920
if you love someone.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.920
But it should be pure love,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.160
without any lust and greed

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.320
which is a Divine love.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.360
Divine love doesn't expect anything.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.920
You cannot sell it,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.720
you cannot force it on anyone.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.840
It is the purity

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.920
of your being, that starts emitting that love.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.240
For example there's a lamp, which is dirty,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.240
and even if you put a light inside that

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.920
it won't give any light at all.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.960
So the first process that starts in you

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.800
of the awakening of the Kundalini

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:03.160
gives you the feeling of the All-pervading power

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.200
and also gives you a kind of a peace within and a security.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.120
But above all you develop

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.920
a new awareness called as collective consciousness.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.520
This new consciousness is where

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.120
you can feel another person on your finger tips

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.200
and you start emitting yourself

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.920
in vibrations of Divine Love.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.880
But these vibrations are very dim in the beginning.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.920
The Kundalini comes, again falls down,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.360
again attends to the problems in the being.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.160
The problems could be physical,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.840
could be mental, could be emotional.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.160
But the main problem is the spiritual problem

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.000
which is very difficult to eradicate.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.920
But as you start seeing your own problems and blockades

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.240
and feeling on, feeling them on your fingertips,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.040
you yourself correct your own being

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.200
as if you have become your own guide and your own master.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.840
In your own light you start seeing what's wrong with you.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.000
I don't have to tell you that this is wrong, that is wrong.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.920
You yourself correct yourself.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.280
When this process starts of cleansing the purity improves within.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.800
That is your attention becomes very pure.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.720
When you look at something as I told you yesterday

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.760
there's no thought that comes into your mind,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.240
but you become a witness.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.120
But it's not only that.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.560
In collective consciousness

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.040
when you look at something, you pay attention to something,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.040
it gets purified.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.920
That's why Christ has said "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.800
That means in your eyes there should not be any lust or greed.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.240
When you look at people

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.600
then there should not be any lust

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.680
or feeling of greed but just you look at them

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.760
and the purity of your eyes is purifying them.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.920
You all are capable of becoming that kind of a strong personality,

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.800
the light of Spirit, now enlightened within you.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.280
Spirit first of all gives you the truth,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.360
the absolute,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.200
because the Spirit is absolute.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.080
It gives you the absolute truth into such an extent

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.080
that even if you have ten children and tie up their eyes

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.240
and ask them "What's wrong with this person?"

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.800
they will all raise this finger,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.440
means this finger is burning.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:55.360
That means that that person is suffering from guilt.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.920
That means this is the center which is catching, here.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.320
So much is the absoluteness of the truth is.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.400
That means our brain captures the absolute truth.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:32.920
Now, our attention becomes collectively conscious as I told you.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.880
Like we see the television,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.080
the play is going on somewhere in the central place,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.920
and we see the television.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:57.920
So, say I am sitting here and My attention has gone somewhere else

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.440
to some person, maybe to some problem to anything.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.920
But it's not like television, it's more than that,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:20.920
because this acts through the subtle of the ether,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.920
that when this attention goes to the other end, it acts.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.920
It works, it organizes, it sends information everywhere

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:50.760
and the whole cosmos works it out.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.280
And then the action takes place, instantaneously.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.920
And you are amazed how it works.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.880
You might say it's a miracle

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.760
but everything that is Divine is miraculous to human beings.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.920
It acts in so many ways.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.400
There was - there are so many stories,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.920
Sahaja Yogis will be able to tell you about the miracles.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So this attention has got vibrations in it.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:45.720
These vibrations are the ones which

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.720
themselves are knowledgeable.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.600
They have the knowledge

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.120
and they know what to do

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.720
and they are connected with the whole.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:11.320
So the message from them goes into the cosmos

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:19.560
and it's such a beautiful, efficient

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.600
machine, we can say - it's not a good word though,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.320
of energy that

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:33.880
it acts instantaneously in the proper way.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.080
Some people ask Me, "Mother if these powers come into us,

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.920
we can use it for wrong things."

00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.920
You cannot. If you try, your vibrations will stop.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
If somebody falsely says that

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.360
"I am a Sahaja Yogi. I have this power",  is not accepted.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:21.720
He talks about something like that, it is of no avail.

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.040
As you cannot force Sahaja Yoga or anyone

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.320
you cannot force yourself upon us.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:47.280
And we don't want dishonest hypocritical people.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.240
You have to become the genuine, the pure,

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.080
otherwise how will you emit these vibrations.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:11.440
You are the one who has to do this new revolution.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.480
For any other revolution people had to sacrifice,

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:25.040
had to die, there were massacres

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:35.160
but in Sahaja Yoga you are blessed all the time, blessed.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.040
And you have to just count your blessings one by one.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.720
You are all the time blessed,

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:53.080
all the time you are given support and help and security.

00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:04.800
Every moment you have the sensation of tremendous joy

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:13.920
and enormous confidence in your righteousness and virtues.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:25.400
But as we are coming from the crowds

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:33.920
suddenly we cannot accept, to be on a hill-top watching the crowds.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.280
Because in modern times we live in Hell.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.080
Like our one foot is in the mouth of a crocodile

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.360
and here you are pulled into a boat,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.360
but if you want to be on the crocodile, or in the crocodile's mouth,

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.200
nobody can help you.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:24.080
If you want to put back your foot into it what can anybody do?

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.920
If you like that way, nobody can force you.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.800
But once you start enjoying yourself,

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.120
enjoying the bliss of Divine

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.960
then seldom you want to go back to the crocodile.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:00.120
The conditioning in human beings sometimes can be very strong.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:09.880
Specially the conditioning of the ego is horrible.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.920
Like to say, "I don't like this, I like this".

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.920
or, "I hate this, I love this."

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.440
When you say that 'I' where is this 'I?'

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.800
You have not known yourself so far.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.800
When you become yourself, you'll never say like that,

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.280
because you do not react in that manner.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.320
You just watch and see,

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:10.720
absorb whatever is good and discard whatever is bad.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:21.120
But this discretion has to be established.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.720
As there are two energies within us as told by him

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.240
on the left and the right,

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.280
we have a tendency to go towards the left or towards the right,

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.720
and go to the extremes.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.280
In France I think is people want to go to the left all the time.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.360
That is they follow people like Egyptians who think of their death

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.800
and miserable and unhappy, this that.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.760
Such people take to self-destruction.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.720
They do not destroy others

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.040
but in self-destruction they can  do things

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.440
which they know are bad but will go on doing it.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.720
I don't want to say all of them otherwise

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.200
may be half of you might go away.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:06.440
As you know too much drinking, smoking, you know it's bad for you.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.800
You see a person coming out of a pub and fainting

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.880
and you want to go in the same pub

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.480
to get the same feeling of fainting.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.160
But nobody dare say "Don't drink".

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.880
It's sinful.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.000
Now, when you get your Realization I don't have to tell you.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.720
You become so powerful

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.920
that you decide for yourself and you never try to destroy yourself.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.920
Overnight people have given up drugs,

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.200
overnight people have given up bad habits.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:13.760
All kinds of nonsensical habits they have given up

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.840
because now they have become the Spirit.

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.880
They see themselves

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:29.120
The left-side is very dangerous in a way.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:35.920
Beyond the left side resides your subconscious,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.920
then resides the subconscious of your previous lives

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.160
and beyond that resides the collective subconscious.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.840
Beyond that resides all that is gone out of

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.760
the evolutionary process.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:14.800
From there comes the triggering of all these diseases like cancer,

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.000
like myelitis - all these muscular disabilities,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.680
muscular dissipation,disability,

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:38.440
then impotency,

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.000
AIDS,

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.120
madness, lunacy, epilepsy,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.200
all psychosomatic diseases,

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.880
all psychological diseases.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.240
That is the psyche on the left-hand side.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:12.400
And a person like Freud, who was a half-baked man,

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.240
himself was a complicated person

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.280
- he had bad relation with his own mother -

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.080
and who died of cancer,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.800
and he practiced on the pathological cases.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:45.200
Pathos means suffering.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.680
So all left-sided diseases

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.440
which are, which were very few in those days,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.800
and he generalized it

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.160
and he propagated his Freudian theories.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.360
He was given a higher position than that of Christ.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.800
Maybe the Christianity was going on the other side

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.800
of putting too much restrictions,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.880
calling human beings "sinners".

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.520
Whatever may be the reason

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.200
- one side the dogma another side the licentiousness -

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:54.000
both are wrong, both are self-destructive

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.040
and they are not going to give you any help.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:08.200
And these two things acted upon the Western people more,

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.440
and they got lost into the left side.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:23.080
To go to the extreme they started taking drugs,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.440
and now the Aids.

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:37.320
In Sahaja Yoga what happens that your attention comes to the center.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.440
You come on the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.200
You can see like this My attention is supposing,

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.960
is going this side and something pushes it upward like that.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.280
So, when the Kundalini rises

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.280
She brings your attention collected from everywhere,

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:17.320
brings it upward and pierces through your fontanel bone area.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.080
But also we have very many right-sided people.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:37.680
They went in other countries and tried to dominate them.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.200
I sometimes say thank God Columbus

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:48.920
did not come to India, otherwise I would not have been here.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.920
He went to America and finished off all of them.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.840
So this is the right-sidedness when we destroy others.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:10.360
In that we have a kind of a ego ,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.800
we think we are better than others.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.000
This is falsehood.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.920
God has not created anybody higher or lower.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.240
God created only one world and human beings.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.960
Only according to the climate we are varied -

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.120
we are different from each other.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.080
And variety is so important

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.920
otherwise we'd all would be just the same,

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.280
like military regime of human beings,

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.920
or maybe like robots.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.120
But He made us so separate and different

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.880
because we bring beauty in this world.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.240
That life is interesting.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:32.840
One leaf of a tree is not just the same as another leaf.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.440
Just see the tremendous work of art.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.880
In the same artistic way

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.800
He has created human beings in different manners.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:59.280
But we think we are different,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.440
they are different - this is our own conditioning.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.920
These are all flowers on one tree.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.160
But we haven't got the sense of collective

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.840
that's why we think like that.

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.360
We cannot feel the connection with others.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.000
It's like you may form a club.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:45.160
Like you have club of people who use fork and spoon

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.680
in a different manner.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.200
There are all sorts of funny clubs.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.160
We try to club together,

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.920
artificially.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:15.880
Whatever is artificially we are doing exists in reality also.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.160
We are part and parcel of one whole.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.440
The microcosm belongs to the macrocosm, no doubt,

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.920
but it's not the reality with us yet.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.200
It's just an idea.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.000
So under anything you can have a league

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.920
- like somebody has a "red hair league" -

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.240
and then we try to classify them.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:05.440
It's all so artificial and so stupid.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.920
You are part and parcel of the whole

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.920
and you cannot classify yourself as separate.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:25.040
Like this hand and this hand belongs to this body.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.400
Now if this hand wants to soothe the other hand

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.160
is it doing any obligation on this hand?

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.400
So after Realization you feel who is the other?

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:00.920
We don't aggress with our hands our nose, do we?

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:09.320
We don't put our finger into our eyes to aggress it, do we?

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.000
Because the eye is whiter than the finger

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.920
- do we put our finger into it?

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.840
All this aggressiveness is that stupid.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:37.960
If you are aggressing each other you are aggressing the whole.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:46.920
Anywhere you try to do that, you harm the other part of the whole.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.040
Then we start having organization for the whole-

00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.080
The Whole World International Organization - this and that.

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:11.440
But the people inside that, are they collectively conscious?

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:24.000
Is that their inner understanding

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:30.840
on their central nervous system that other doesn't exist?

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.440
So this problem also gets solved after Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:51.400
You forget that you are only a Frenchman and nothing more.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:58.240
Like a drop falls into the ocean and becomes the ocean

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.840
the heart of a Sahaja Yogi becomes so great.

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:12.720
He doesn't see the color of your skin,

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.920
color of your hair or your body.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:26.360
He doesn't see how you sit and talk, what language you know.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.920
He just sees "do you know the language of love?",

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:43.560
of pure love, of Divine love, of vibrations.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:48.200
He talks in the terminology of vibrations,

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.920
of different centers.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.960
That's what happened to the disciples of Christ,

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:03.800
of they started talking in the language of chakras,

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.280
and started moving their hands

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.840
to raise the Kundalini of other people.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.160
But how this one is also now misused!

00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:29.320
They started a religion everywhere where a person gets possessed.

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.280
Even in Hindu religion we have people going to the temple

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.320
and get possessed and saying, "ho, ho, ho", like that

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.920
- stupid people.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.240
And they say that Goddess has come in their body.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.920
Mostly they are maid-servants.

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.280
That Goddess must have some brains to go into these people

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.280
and all the time they go on making gestures

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.240
of a such a ridiculous nature.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.960
It's not only there, it's happening in all religions.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:33.720
Even among Catholics you find the charisma, charismatic.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.360
Same thing, it is the same thing, it's the possession.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.320
Then the Pentecostals now,

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.880
they are going to Guatemala to poor- these poor people,

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.840
are getting them possessed.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.320
SY - They are going to?

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:57.040
Guatemala to get them possessed - all these Pentecostals

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.280
and they all becoming abnormal people crying, weeping, so annoying.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.000
They look so miserable.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.960
So it is a mass mesmerism.

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.320
Is it religion?

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.760
They said, "No, we have become like disciples of Christ."

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.400
They are not even in their own senses.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.720
We had an interesting thing in India once,

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.560
in a village, Indian village.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.920
We had a Pentecostal visitor from America.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:56.440
And we have a Pentecostal church in villages.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.720
And they had given a notice to the teachers saying that

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:05.000
"If you don't get the blessings of the Holy Ghost this Sunday

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.240
you will have to give up the job".

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.240
And the blessing of the Holy Ghost means you go mad.

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.920
You just go on screaming, shouting, going into gesticulations,

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.080
all kinds of funny actions.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.160
Now this fellow had no moral courage to act

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.720
this teacher, poor thing,

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.080
had no moral courage to act like a Holy Ghost's blessing.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.560
But he was worried about his job, you see.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:09.440
So, when the sermon was over he got into a big fright,

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:17.160
and he caught hold of that American old lady

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:23.920
and put her into a round and round and round and round

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.920
and saying words in our language,

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:32.680
"You see, now you dance my lady, you dance my lady"

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.920
and the old lady got exhausted and she fainted.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.200
But the surprising thing is

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.760
that the gentleman got confirmed as a Pentecostal and got his job.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:04.440
All this kind of stupidity brings bad name to God.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.920
This is not God.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:18.200
God makes you a righteous, virtuous, sensible, dignified person.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.960
He gives you a very subtle sense of humor

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:34.760
and a very magnetic personality which is very enjoyable.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.960
He doesn't make a fool out of you, He doesn't make you insane

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.360
that you land up in a lunatic asylum.

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.760
We've got Christ before us.

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:58.720
We've got real gurus

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.240
who were real, not these fake ones in the market,

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:07.920
real gurus, whose lives you can see how sensible they were.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.040
How powerful they were,

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.000
and what they achieved,

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.280
how they loved the world, created peace,

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:38.080
how they gave proper laws and regulations to the whole world.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:46.240
Even sometimes people criticized them

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:54.280
but they do not know, what is the essence behind their life.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:02.320
Say for example people say, Mohammad Sahab married so many times.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.440
Because at that time they were on war path,

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.840
people were killing them and there were hardly young people left

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:15.920
to be married to ladies.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.280
But Mohammad Sahab did not believe in prostitution

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.880
and extra-marital relationships.

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.920
So He said "Whatever it is, you marry".

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.160
In America people said "We don't like Mohammad Sahab,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.240
because He insists on marriage,

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.440
and we want to have an experience of sex before marriage".

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:08.160
I said, "Absurd why do you want to have an experience

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.920
before marriage"?

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.560
Supposing you have to shift to a house do you say,

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.400
"I must have an experience of the house before I go there"?

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.920
But now the situation is different after

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.920
AIDS have shown their teeth.

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.640
They want now people to have virgin husbands

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.880
and virgin wives.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.920
They want to have men and women who are pure.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:04.800
They may not talk about it but they are in a great danger.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.000
And as you know that I'm not afraid of anyone,

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.360
and I very frankly told them in the year 1973

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:16.040
that if they don't give up these nonsensical ideas about sex,

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.920
they are going to have a horrible disease.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.840
And they got very angry with Me

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.840
and nobody would come to Sahaja Yoga

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:42.080
but they wanted to go to all the false gurus,

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.840
paying them lots of money.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.320
Also they didn't like Me because I said, "You can't pay Me",

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.680
because I could not satisfy their ego.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.920
But today is different.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:11.400
They realize that I had the real concern for their good.

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:22.440
When this Kundalini rises within you

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:27.720
then you see the chakra, the red chakra down below

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.920
which is called as the Mooladhara,

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.200
is the center of your innocence.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.360
Kundalini doesn't go through that.

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.840
That chakra is below it.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.840
So one has to understand

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.920
that to achieve God you don't have to go to sex.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.440
There were another type of gurus who came

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.600
to say you must take to sex, mass sex to go to God.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.880
What happens to the brains of people,

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:19.840
when they hear such stupid ideologies!

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.800
If that is the case, all animals must go to Heavens first,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.080
before than human beings.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.480
If this kind of a nonsense is good

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:42.320
then why is it people get into diseases?

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:51.920
The another side is that you shouldn't have any sex.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.280
This is absurd.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.720
It's a natural thing which one must have

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.640
in a very sane and a healthy manner.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:16.040
It's like saying you don't eat food at all and you'll go to God.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.280
If you fast then you'll go to God immediately.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.240
I mean there are many people who are fasting

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:29.560
in this world because they haven't got sufficient food.

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:33.840
They must have all gone to God immediately.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.120
In Ethyopia you have so many people who died of starvation.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.920
Are they gone to God?

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:57.920
So (the) another side of it is also another extreme of a nonsense.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.880
And both these things have never helped us.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.800
Once you are a Spirit

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:17.240
you become completely in control of yourself.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.920
No temptations can invade you,

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.320
no one can dominate you

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.600
nor you dominate anyone.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:38.840
You respect the privacy and

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.640
the liberty of another person as you respect yours.

00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:57.920
In this we have no sense of privacy and no self-respect.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:06.840
We have something very private and secret with us,

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:11.920
which should not be shared on the street and the roads.

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.680
People just want to take advantage

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:25.920
and want to make you into an animal or into a sex point.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:40.160
You are a human being above all the creation of the world.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.880
You are not animals.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.600
You don't have to learn anything from animals.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.920
They have to learn from you if they have to evolve.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:04.080
You must assume your own powers as Spirit

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:11.960
and you can see here clearly that the Kundalini rises

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:16.920
and without any guidance

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:22.200
from anything else but the Mooladhara,

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.480
the center of innocence.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.240
That's an eternal childhood, the innocence within us,

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.600
that's something eternal that does not die.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.440
It may sleep off

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.920
but is awakened as soon as your Kundalini rises.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:59.240
That is the reason why Christ did not die.

00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:09.000
Because He is the incarnation of that innocence.

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:16.960
And innocence is the first thing that was created

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:24.920
and that is the first center in which we have been built.

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.680
SY: - Bathed?
SM:- Built.

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:34.920
That's our blessing.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:40.920
That's what is the biggest auspicious thing we have.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:51.880
The Kundalini rising itself will give you back your innocence.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.960
It will be awakened

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:05.000
and you will know what you have so respectable within you.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.280
You will develop your self-respect,

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.400
and your security,

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:21.920
and all the courage that is needed,

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:26.680
through this power of Divine love.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:38.240
You have to know that the subject is too vast

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.240
and I must have given thousands of lectures

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:49.040
in the West in English language also

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.240
and many more in India.

00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:02.400
So, in these two days I cannot go too far.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:10.120
But when you get your Realization you become the knowledge.

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:17.200
And you become the joy.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:24.200
But one has to understand that it is a collective growth,

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:29.840
like on a tree,

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.160
there are many leaves,

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.920
and are nourished by the sap of the tree.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:43.880
Supposing one leaf wants to be separated,

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:53.800
then a bark develops between the tree and the leaf.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:59.640
It happens in the autumn,

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.920
and the leaf falls off.

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.920
So you have to keep to the collective to grow together.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:18.720
Many people who get Realization stay away from the collective,

00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.720
and say, "Mother, we love you very much. We had your photograph,

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:31.360
we were meditating, still we got cancer."

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.920
You have to have nourishment all the time.

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.680
You have to be collective.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.840
Firstly, as we don't take money, we don't have

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:56.720
very big palatial places for you to come in.

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:09.360
We have humble houses where you can come and meet everyone,

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:17.880
and become a part and parcel of the whole,

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.040
and develop yourself.

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.000
You should forget you come from a rich family

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:32.360
or you are a very big personality. Forget all that.

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.320
Here you are a yogi.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.560
You have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.320
and all of you are part and parcel of the whole,

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:56.880
and all these ideas of ego must go.

00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:06.800
All these ideas that I am something, will disappear.

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:14.200
Then we'll have a new type of humanity

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:22.240
which will have no wars, no hatred,

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.760
but would be completely bathed

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:31.360
in the beauty of bliss, of Divine love.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:40.160
You'll have no problems with your children, with your families

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.680
and you'll reside into the calmness

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:53.240
and the beauty and glory of Divinity.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:59.720
That has to come,

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:03.920
that's, is there already coming.

00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:07.920
Please, you're invited.

00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.920
Thank you very much.
