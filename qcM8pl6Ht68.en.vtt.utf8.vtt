00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:55.760
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of the Devi

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.920
The Devi has many forms but

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.106
is the embodiment of the shakti.

00:02:11.226 --> 00:02:19.160
Adishakti gives shakti to all these embodiments.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.080
And so there are many Goddesses we have at different times.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.430
They came on this earth and did

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:38.640
all that was necessary for the ascent of people who were seekers.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:48.440
Specially the one we know of Jagadamba, the Durga.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:56.960
She was trying to protect all the seekers of truth

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.760
and to destroy all evil forces.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.120
Because without the ascent of human beings,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.734
they do not know the truth.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.560
And that's why whatever they try to do

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.640
is a mental projection. And this mental projection,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.480
if it is not substantiated by truth, by dharma, it declines.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.960
In Sanskrit they call it 'glaani'.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.880
When this glaani takes place

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.960
then incarnations are born to solve the problem.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.640
In all incarnations of the Goddess, there have been,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.880
very much incarnated the satanic forces.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.600
They had incarnated and She had to fight them, with them

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.080
and destroy them.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.080
But this destruction was not for the destruction sake that

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.520
the evil forces are to be destroyed

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.760
but evil forces always try to put down the seekers,

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:41.560
put down the saints, try to harm them, sometimes even destroy.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:55.760
All these destructive forces do not come at the same time, normally

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.840
at different times. Is easy to handle

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.120
but the aim of the incarnation is to save,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.880
to protect the people who are seekers

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.280
because they are the most important people

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:18.120
in the realm of spirituality. All others are nothing but dust,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:26.000
good for nothing, useless. If they are not seeking the truth

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.080
in the eyes of God, they are just useless lives

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.920
that have come and will be finished.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.376
They have no value and they have no dignity.

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:43.920
They have no understanding of anything.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:51.360
So in the judgment of the divine love, we have two types of people:

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:59.040
one who are seekers of truth and the another who are not.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.564
They may be good people. They will be nice people,

00:06:02.684 --> 00:06:06.379
they'll be doing us lot of good works: social work, this work,

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.564
missionary work, every sort of work they might be doing.

00:06:10.684 --> 00:06:13.964
But if they are not seeking the truth

00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:16.720
then they do not come to that category

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.058
where God has to incarnate.

00:06:22.584 --> 00:06:25.860
So try to understand the preciousness,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.600
the importance of seekers.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.440
And that's what you have been seeking.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:43.640
Very few persons, if you take the percentage, are seeker.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:51.640
Is very, very wee bit. But it's very important because, say,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:07:04.440
a one little part of gold is much more valuable

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:12.120
than mounds of steel. In the same way, a seeker

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.360
is much more valuable in the growth of spirituality.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.600
The whole universe was created,

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:28.960
whole atmosphere was built, all the evolution took place

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.080
for what? That human beings should know the truth.

00:07:36.648 --> 00:07:40.457
But in the modern atmosphere,

00:07:40.577 --> 00:07:43.656
it's a very big curse, I think the greatest evil

00:07:43.776 --> 00:07:47.040
than all the Shumbha Nishumbhas and all that,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.200
the worst of all is materialism

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.640
because materialism makes you gross.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.400
In your seeking also when you are rising,

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:06.800
subtly that materialism catches you. I have been noticing this.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.909
When people come to Sahaja Yoga, right,

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:18.000
they are going deep into themselves.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.960
They are understanding what I am saying. All the inner knowledge

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.800
they want to know, what is called as Atmagyan.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.110
Atmagyan means two things:

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:35.818
the knowledge about the spirit and knowledge about yourself.

00:08:35.938 --> 00:08:42.040
All this they find out and they know what it is.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:52.360
This state is the state for which people have been doing

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.040
all kinds of things: going to the Himalayas,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.360
meditating in the cold without much clothes on them,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.320
living in the caves with some fruits.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.680
All kinds of tapasyas they would do because the seeking was so deep,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:23.880
so urgent, and they could not get out of that force of seeking.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:36.360
But in the modern times, materialism retards that hankering,

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:44.600
that dedication. It's maddening for people when they are seekers.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:54.169
I have seen before coming to Sahaja Yoga, people spend lot of money,

00:09:54.289 --> 00:10:01.840
go to various places, go to Himalayas, go to Nepal, go to Japan,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.547
all over the places they are moving.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.600
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.485
after they have become the spirits,

00:10:13.757 --> 00:10:19.641
for the growth of your new awareness

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.880
the progress is retarded.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.520
Also one should understand that after so much of running about,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.920
you find something so precious so you settle down with that.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.720
And you feel very satisfied about it. That part is all right.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:44.480
But what later? Your growth should not stop.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.400
And that stops because,

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.880
because of one of the main reasons is materialism.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.680
Because of materialism,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.080
your faith in yourself is also less.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.360
Now as you have seen that the Gods prayed to the Goddess

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.440
and She came and killed all the negative forces.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:22.120
Reason was: the earnest desire of the Gods

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.680
compelled Her to take incarnation.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.800
Such sincere desire

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:39.680
that they could not get sometimes food, even water,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:46.200
and they worked so hard for their ascent

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.040
which was disturbed by negative forces.

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:59.353
So their call was so from the heart,

00:11:59.473 --> 00:12:04.097
so desperate and genuine and sincere

00:12:04.217 --> 00:12:09.720
that the Goddess had to take birth on this earth

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:17.080
to save them, to protect them, to look after them.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:28.760
But as it is, we see once you have reached a destination,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.880
we feel now better settle down.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.920
Now, what do you - we settle down with?

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:48.760
If after getting Realization you are complete,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.520
you are in totality, you are absolutely one with reality,

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.040
there is nothing to be done.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.160
You become a saint.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:08.800
And a saint does not need any advertisement, does not need anything.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.760
His message spreads. People see him and know

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.680
he is a great saint.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.320
So many saints did not even leave their houses.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.240
Very common saying in India,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.720
"Your takiya you should not leave,"

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.000
the pillow on which you are resting, you should not leave.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.880
That was a criteria of a guru. Those who have to seek

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.480
should come to the gurus and should climb up,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.200
at least six seven miles up,

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.070
and then the guru doesn't meet any one.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.606
He may slap you. He may hit you.

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:50.960
He may drop you from that high mountain.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:56.320
He'll take your test by so many ways.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.640
Ultimately he may select one person to give Realization.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.280
So this hankering, this desperate effort

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.080
was all the time there.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.320
Now so we come to Sahaja Yoga in this modern time.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:28.040
Sometimes I feel that not only Sahaja Yoga is very easy

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:37.360
also it is extremely pampering. You know you have got Realization.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.960
You all know that you are better than others,

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.320
that you have got rid of so many problems

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.400
and that now you have become master of your own.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.840
Then the responsibility

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:04.040
that you have towards yourself and to your fellow men reduces

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.440
because you feel very satisfied with yourself.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.480
The other day some Sahaja yogini rang Me up.

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.840
I mean, they ring Me up for everything.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.760
She said that, "I went to the doctor and he put radiation

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.320
and they found I was pregnant so what should I do about the baby?"

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:31.000
For such a small thing they will ask.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.680
"What should the name of our son?"

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.040
"What is this?" "What is that?"

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.480
I mean, I have to do much more work than any priest has to do.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:47.160
Little, little things they are worried about. All right,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.680
that part is all right that I have to tell you

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.520
what is to be done at such a point or what should we do.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.520
If they miss the train, they will telephone to Me,

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.280
"Mother, we have missed the train. Now what to do?"

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.320
So I have to tell them, "All right, give them a bandhan."

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.920
That also I have to tell them.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:15.880
Or supposing their father is sick. He has a heart trouble

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.200
then they will telephone to Me, "Mother, my father is sick.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.960
He has a heart trouble. He is not a Sahaja yogi.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.320
What can You do about it?" So Mother has to put attention

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.400
to his father who is not a Sahaja yogui.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.160
Small, small things they write to Me.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.720
Such small things that you can't imagine

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:45.160
how they do not understand what I am here for.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:52.840
Still, I have never said that "It's a stupid thing to ask Me.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.280
You should not waste My time," never.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.280
But it is to be seen now

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:07.280
that if you do not value yourself as realized souls,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.520
you can not value My time also

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.440
or what is Myself.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:19.800
This incarnation can be wasted completely

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:25.240
because of this materialistic attitude.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.040
In this modern times, I don't know

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.760
what's gone wrong with human beings

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.960
because the most important thing in your life

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.200
is to ascend and to grow.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.240
Take a big vision of the whole thing.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.440
Why this universe was created?

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.680
Why you were created as human beings?

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.880
What was the need to do all these things? For what is it done?

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.080
If you have a very big vision of the whole thing

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.840
then try to locate your position: "Where am I?!

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.120
And then, "How the Divine has selected me

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.720
and now I have become a Sahaja yogi?"

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.800
So now, "What is my responsibility?"

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.880
that one has to see.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.240
But on the contrary, I have seen people

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.400
who are saying have a transfer. So they will telephone and ask,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.640
"Mother, should we take our chair or not?"

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.240
That shows they have no value about themselves

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.480
and no value about Me, both ways.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.040
Because they are asking such small things, such silly things

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.280
that is impossible to understand how

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.360
could Sahaja yogis ask such questions.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.800
The perspective we can see: the Goddess.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.760
She comes on this earth

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.320
in different forms at different times

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.080
to save the seekers of truth

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:31.960
and to work out the ascent of the seekers of truth.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.720
Can you imagine?

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.960
A very big difference in the incarnation

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:44.720
of the Goddess before Kaliyuga.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.920
While now, it's a very different thing

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:53.880
that you have come on this earth

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.920
to become the Sahaja yogis.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.720
You  have to have a body, a mind,

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:08.400
feeling everything which is just charged with spirituality,

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.560
charged with your spirituality.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:14.720
Should be normally

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.800
because how many years in the past

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.800
you have been seeking God.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:26.520
Then that came here. What a coincidence!

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:34.880
When, what is it? When you have such a great advantage

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.480
that you have come to Sahaja Yoga because of your seeking

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:45.760
and now you have found the satisfaction out of it.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:51.560
What is the responsibility that you have?

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.560
That the incarnation Itself has come on this earth,

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:07.240
not only to protect you, to nourish you, and to kill the demons, no!

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:10.080
She has come on this earth

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.080
to tell you about everything that is subtler

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.520
inside and to tell you what should be

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.240
your relationship: should be outside as well as inside.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.560
You were never connected with truth.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.400
You were never connected with this all-pervading power.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:37.080
You were never connected with God Almighty.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.000
So one has to understand that,

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.960
"What a great thing has happened that out of me only,

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.440
this Kundalini has come out

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:59.160
and She has touched these higher centers." How?

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.680
This was not done before, no.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:07.520
They were just protected. They were just looked after.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.400
Nowhere it is written that "Goddess

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.120
has given Realization to people" nowhere.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.320
She is responsible. She can give.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.680
One of Her names is that. Not one but at least ten names are

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:28.000
that She gives you your nirvana, that She gives you your freedom,

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.640
that She introduces you to liberty.

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:38.160
All these things are written but what's happening now

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:44.680
is that people have not yet been able to grasp

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.920
the value of their life in the modern times.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.760
See the way people ask questions.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.840
See the way people, the inquiry is on,

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.280
the way people are worried,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.960
"Now my child is big.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.120
What should I do?" What should you do?

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.920
Child is big. Put him to school. Do what you like.

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.800
"Mother, will you please tell where to put the child."

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.800
Then you put the child."Have you seen the school, Mother?" "No, I haven't."

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.080
"Then you go and inspect the school."

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.520
Imagine Kali Mata doing that!

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.560
She would have given two nice tight slaps, I tell you.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.880
Any body who would have said that, what do you make out of it?

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.480
But to that detailed extent a Motherhood has to work out.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.200
You won't do that for your own child, I know.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.760
But when it comes to children, what are they doing?

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.720
Still materialistic.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.080
Today specially it's a very great day of Dussehra.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.880
This is the day when, as you know, Ravana was burnt.

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.880
Effigies of Ravana were burnt all over the place.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.360
When Shri Rama came this was done, His victory.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.080
But in His victory,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.640
it was not that He made Sahaja yogis

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.800
or He gave Realization, no.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.880
His victory was that He killed Ravana.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.880
That was done that time for today's preparation.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.400
For today's happening, it was done long time back

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:47.160
that these days will come

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:55.640
when people will have proper value system of victory of Shri Rama.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.280
But it doesn't happen.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.120
It doesn't happen. Because this incarnation

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:13.720
of Mataji Nirmala Devi is very different, very illusive, Mahamaya.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.240
So you are left to yourself,

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.880
do what you like. Whatever you like, you can do it.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:28.560
So they will ask Me, "Mother, we have a problem."

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:34.160
I said, "What?" "We don't know which kind of chairs we should buy."

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.920
For every small thing they will refer to Mother

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.440
but for important things, never.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.560
Sort of a funny use of the whole thing has started

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.640
which is so great, so important

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.960
is used for something absolutely nonsensical.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.720
So see the difference between the incarnations.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.520
One incarnation comes on this earth to save the people,

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.480
to bring them out of the mire of Maya.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.480
But another incarnation which has come

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.040
is not only just to talk about it

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.960
but to give you your Realization

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.600
and then to look after your small, small things.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.000
So when this lady telephoned and asked Me,

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:34.720
"What should I do? Please Mother, cure me."

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.840
It's very different attitude.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.680
Between the bhaktas of those days

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.880
and the bhaktas of today, there's a very big difference.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.920
I said, "You never asked Me

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.480
when you did all that, doesn't matter.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.920
Now whatever you have done, it's better I see the child,

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.520
look after the child, put the child right but you come along."

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.280
But then I realized that this woman is so attached to her child.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.920
And I telephoned to the leader

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.040
and he said, "It's terrible attachment.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.720
It's a terrible attachment to the child."

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.560
So now from one nonsense to another nonsense.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:34.520
This incarnation has such variety of jobs to be done.

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:42.200
I mean, even the 64 kalas, the 64 expertise

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.480
of Shri Ganesh is not sufficient to solve this.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:56.280
Why is it so complicated? After giving Self- Realization,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:00.280
it should be a straight forward march

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:04.760
towards your goal and towards your growth.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.360
But why is it that such a complicated nonsense

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.600
is all the time bothering you?

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:20.852
What do you want? We should ask, "Now what do you want?"

00:28:20.972 --> 00:28:23.920
"I want a child."

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.840
After Sahaja Yoga, you should not want anything.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.800
"Why do you want to have a child? There are so many children.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.680
You can look after them."

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:43.400
'I want' goes away, should go away from your mind that,

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:53.200
"I want this and I want that." This wanting is over now.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.040
What you wanted: your Self-Realization.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:01.280
After that, what has happened is that now:

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:07.360
what I want is more important and I want

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.200
that you should become really detached from materialism.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.533
That doesn't mean

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:18.405
that you should become like "Hare Rama Hare Krishna" no, no, no, no.

00:29:18.525 --> 00:29:20.840
They are not detached.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:26.760
They are very much attached people. But detachment is a state where

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.000
nothing can bind you, nothing is important,

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.280
most important thing  is your spiritual ascent.

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:41.840
Nothing can attract you more than this.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:47.840
This is what exactly is wanted today,

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.680
that Sahaja yogis should understand.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.840
Compared to what Sahaja yogis, compared to Sahaja yogis,

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.120
what people have gone through. When I read it everyday,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.720
I feel terrible.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.200
Here everything is convenience, convenient,

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.760
come along, enjoy nice food, nice company,

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:18.240
it's a festival going on. Everything is [inaudible].

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.240
And if something is missing, I will be the one

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.429
to tell the organizers, "What is this?

00:30:23.549 --> 00:30:27.229
You should have done this. You should have done that."

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:43.960
Now, we come to a point where we have to understand:

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:46.800
What do we want?

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.120
What's the use of killing Shumbha Nishumbhas?

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:59.040
What's the use of killing this catholic church? What's the use?

00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.480
Because you are static.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.920
You are glued in one place, no progress.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.480
So what's the use of doing all these things all the time

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.200
and destroying all that negativity.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.640
What is the purpose?

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.640
It's too arbitrary, everybody says, "Mother,

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.640
you have given them permission. You have given them license,

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.800
so now they are doing the way they are."

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.200
The other day, one girl came to Me.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.480
Her child was very sick. I asked her: "Do you meditate?"

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.480
She kept quiet.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.680
I said I can make out that you don't meditate

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.120
because I know what it is.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.240
That you don't even meditate?

00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:55.840
So today's main thing is this is a Dussehra day

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.280
when the people go,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.920
cross the boundaries of their villages

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:05.400
and bring gold for the parents.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.400
That's the story, it is like that.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.840
Now what you have to do is to

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:16.680
cross the limits of materialism, this nonsensical

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:21.240
dwarfy force that is working on you

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:28.760
and you have to transcend and bring, as I said, gold

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:37.640
that is untarnishable thing from the borders of Sahaja yoga.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:45.800
How many of you really are in the field of work?

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.560
How many of you are telling about this to people?

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.160
What are you doing about it?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:06.960
Why I am talking to you and not to Indians this way

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:12.320
because their attitude is different.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.640
Their attitude is not materialistic. It's spiritual.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.200
They want their spiritual ascent

00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:26.080
for which they suffer a lot. They go out of the way to do things

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:35.160
just to get to that state where they could be easily surrendered.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.400
This surrender state has to come.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:43.680
For example, you have a problem.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.560
Say problem, you have no holidays

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.160
and you want to come for Pujas, say. I'm just giving an example.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.720
Now, if you want to come to Puja, you just come.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.200
Not only you will get job but you might get promotion.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.640
But you have no faith in your ascent.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:14.280
You have no faith that you are the chosen one.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.840
This is what is missing because of materialism.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:27.840
Recently in America, we have a very great Sahaja yogi,

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.120
Dave Dunphy. I told him, "Dave,

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.400
you better take over as the leader of America

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.800
because this gentleman is not all right and you better take over."

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:44.840
Immediately he said, "All right Mother." Now, he lives in Honolulu.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:51.360
Our programs and everything are done through L.A., Los Angeles,

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:56.120
and it looked quite strange that I should ask him

00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.040
to come down and work there.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.960
Now, where are we?

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:08.560
We are the people who have been blessed

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.800
with all the powers. You have been blessed.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.896
But we don't want to practice.

00:35:16.016 --> 00:35:18.523
We don't want to find out what powers we have,

00:35:18.643 --> 00:35:20.508
worried about our own children,

00:35:20.628 --> 00:35:23.508
worried about what sari we are going to wear,

00:35:23.628 --> 00:35:26.759
or worried about who is the leader

00:35:26.879 --> 00:35:29.886
and what should we do about the leadership.

00:35:34.485 --> 00:35:37.600
All these things are not going to help us.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.976
You are not here for that. Try to understand.

00:35:42.096 --> 00:35:45.980
You are here for becoming the spirit

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:53.280
and then to spread the light of the spirit. Nothing matters.

00:35:54.304 --> 00:35:57.876
Once you start doing that, you'll be amazed:

00:35:57.996 --> 00:36:03.432
the faith works. It's not blind faith. It's not blind faith.

00:36:04.223 --> 00:36:09.718
You don't have to tell Me even. It just works.

00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:27.560
It's a matter a few days, you might get many results

00:36:27.934 --> 00:36:33.663
of what you have been hankering after,  material,

00:36:33.783 --> 00:36:39.703
superficials, you might get. But the question remains.

00:36:42.232 --> 00:36:49.960
Somebody, say, wants to dedicate his life, so called,

00:36:50.098 --> 00:36:54.507
for Sahaja Yoga. Then what do you do?

00:36:54.627 --> 00:36:57.641
What do you do if you dedicate?

00:36:58.308 --> 00:37:02.386
First thing is your faith.

00:37:02.506 --> 00:37:08.065
You must know: how is your faith into anything.

00:37:08.185 --> 00:37:13.560
You really believe in it or you do not? If you do believe in it,

00:37:13.754 --> 00:37:16.471
what have you done about it?

00:37:19.504 --> 00:37:26.689
So at this stage, you have to introspect.

00:37:27.135 --> 00:37:29.212
What are you doing?

00:37:29.332 --> 00:37:33.934
What are we to do? How far do we have to go?

00:37:34.054 --> 00:37:38.240
It's a very, very important time

00:37:38.557 --> 00:37:45.254
and you are extremely important souls here sitting down

00:37:45.374 --> 00:37:52.758
but, if you don't value your own systems and yourself,

00:37:52.878 --> 00:37:56.078
why should God worry about you?

00:37:58.717 --> 00:38:02.276
Why should God try to give you ideas?

00:38:02.396 --> 00:38:07.045
Why should He try to take any interest even in you

00:38:07.165 --> 00:38:09.284
persons of that [kind].

00:38:14.673 --> 00:38:20.366
So now, I have to just tell you that on this day of this Puja,

00:38:20.486 --> 00:38:24.834
it's such a combination that it is the Dussehra I am here,

00:38:24.954 --> 00:38:30.491
and also is the now we can call it, the last day of the Devi Puja.

00:38:30.611 --> 00:38:34.883
We have to see within ourselves, introspect:

00:38:35.003 --> 00:38:38.496
"What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?"

00:38:42.768 --> 00:38:45.113
Except for looking after my children,

00:38:45.233 --> 00:38:49.310
cooking for the husband, that's all?

00:38:51.301 --> 00:38:55.706
 Men can also think the same way: "What have we done?

00:38:56.166 --> 00:39:00.040
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?"

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.928
Just: I want to meet in the politicians.

00:39:05.048 --> 00:39:10.461
I want to meet this person. I want to meet that person. For what?

00:39:10.762 --> 00:39:12.968
They should come and meet you

00:39:13.088 --> 00:39:16.174
but your faith in yourself is very weak.

00:39:16.294 --> 00:39:19.636
I think that's the main reason for all this fall

00:39:19.756 --> 00:39:22.287
is faith in yourself.

00:39:23.890 --> 00:39:39.373
This faith is such a thing that you know it is.

00:39:39.721 --> 00:39:42.879
You have seen My photographs.

00:39:42.999 --> 00:39:46.938
You are convinced about it. There is nothing to be convinced

00:39:47.058 --> 00:39:50.922
but this faith is not one with your heart.

00:39:51.042 --> 00:39:58.280
It is not just with your being. It's outside.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.932
All right, Mother will do that. Mother will solve this.

00:40:01.052 --> 00:40:03.245
Mother will do this.

00:40:05.191 --> 00:40:12.601
But, whole thing is now

00:40:12.898 --> 00:40:19.456
to Me looks like, that I have to compulsorily tell you

00:40:19.576 --> 00:40:22.735
to do some sort of a tapasya.

00:40:24.965 --> 00:40:33.088
You ask somebody, "Do you meditate?" "No Mother," very plainly.

00:40:33.794 --> 00:40:39.490
"No Mother, we don't." "So, what are you doing here?" "My,

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:45.225
My... there is some pain in my knees so I have come to you."

00:40:45.345 --> 00:40:48.142
All right. "But I don't meditate. I am very honest.

00:40:48.262 --> 00:40:50.450
I don't meditate.

00:40:50.951 --> 00:40:53.975
I just have some pain in the knees. Please cure it.

00:40:54.095 --> 00:40:56.320
I don't meditate."

00:40:58.487 --> 00:41:03.703
How many of you really meditate every night?

00:41:05.674 --> 00:41:08.911
Guido said that, "Mother, if You tell like this they will say,

00:41:09.031 --> 00:41:11.330
'All right in the night we do but not in the morning'

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:15.077
because Mother has said, 'Do it in the night.'"

00:41:15.737 --> 00:41:17.438
There is no earnestness.

00:41:17.558 --> 00:41:30.922
There is no expected any kind of a enthusiasm about it.

00:41:31.436 --> 00:41:34.707
All right, if not today, we will see tomorrow.

00:41:34.827 --> 00:41:38.362
Mother says like that, "It's not necessary.

00:41:38.482 --> 00:41:42.578
It's not important. It's all right."

00:41:42.698 --> 00:41:45.662
So you satisfy yourself.

00:41:45.871 --> 00:41:51.621
But who is the loser? Not Me. I don't need Sahaja Yoga, do I?

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:56.174
I am doing all the tapasya for your Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:56.294 --> 00:42:01.092
What about you people doing some tapasya about it?

00:42:03.936 --> 00:42:09.677
So now, what I am trying to say that you have got your Realization.

00:42:09.797 --> 00:42:13.413
Now you have reached a great state of understanding,

00:42:13.533 --> 00:42:19.262
also of the inner knowledge and also about your connection

00:42:19.382 --> 00:42:23.278
with the spirit and with the God Almighty.

00:42:23.398 --> 00:42:26.012
All this you know now. Many things you know.

00:42:26.132 --> 00:42:33.894
Despite that, it's not yet what it should be from your heart.

00:42:34.014 --> 00:42:39.356
From your earnest desire.

00:42:42.276 --> 00:42:47.318
It doesn't help at all

00:42:47.471 --> 00:42:52.160
any one to deceive oneself, never.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:56.812
So I am not saying something for x, y, z.

00:42:56.932 --> 00:43:02.612
I am saying for all of you. Don't try to cheat yourself.

00:43:05.615 --> 00:43:11.486
You are here with such a great purpose.

00:43:12.608 --> 00:43:15.838
This purpose is corrective

00:43:15.958 --> 00:43:21.573
and is the freedom of our minds

00:43:21.693 --> 00:43:25.513
from all these nonsensical destructive forces

00:43:25.633 --> 00:43:31.304
and then to spread it all over, talk about it.

00:43:34.065 --> 00:43:41.509
My own conviction is this

00:43:41.629 --> 00:43:46.622
that something has to happen to Sahaja yogis

00:43:46.742 --> 00:43:52.007
to realize how important it is

00:43:52.127 --> 00:44:01.475
to work out something that is within us, which is potential,

00:44:01.595 --> 00:44:07.390
which is just about to bubble up. It's a responsibility,

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:11.889
whether you are a Jew, a Christian or anything makes no difference.

00:44:12.009 --> 00:44:14.607
It is all outside.

00:44:14.727 --> 00:44:19.850
For what you have to do that you have come into a new realm

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:24.168
of awareness, into a new realm of a higher life

00:44:24.288 --> 00:44:26.556
where you know all your inner self,

00:44:26.676 --> 00:44:30.894
you know all about what is good and what is not.

00:44:31.014 --> 00:44:35.647
Everything after knowing all this also if you do not grow

00:44:35.767 --> 00:44:38.238
then whom will you blame?

00:44:44.393 --> 00:44:49.901
So now we come to a point to understand

00:44:50.021 --> 00:44:52.921
the importance of this Kaliyuga,

00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:56.809
where your Mother is here to help you

00:44:56.929 --> 00:45:01.777
and also to look after you

00:45:01.897 --> 00:45:07.392
very tenderly, sweetly, to tell you everything.

00:45:07.512 --> 00:45:13.923
Actually I can not get angry with any one for more than one minute.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:22.813
So to explain to you sweetly what you should have done

00:45:22.933 --> 00:45:26.818
and which you can do, which you have to do.

00:45:26.938 --> 00:45:29.797
All these things I would have really

00:45:29.917 --> 00:45:33.495
would have been telling you all the time.

00:45:33.615 --> 00:45:38.063
I have been bringing you round very sweetly and explaining to you

00:45:38.183 --> 00:45:40.953
and telling you that, "This is your own power

00:45:41.073 --> 00:45:46.021
which is within you and which you have to look after and raise it",

00:45:46.141 --> 00:45:50.230
and also you have got so many books

00:45:50.350 --> 00:45:53.388
or ways of understanding that.

00:45:53.508 --> 00:45:57.067
But this inner knowledge which you have

00:45:57.187 --> 00:46:02.093
is something like this that I have a inner knowledge

00:46:02.213 --> 00:46:06.944
about, say about, how to build these things

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:10.952
but I don't do it. It's as simple as that.

00:46:11.072 --> 00:46:15.449
I just don't do it. I have the inner knowledge, all right.

00:46:15.569 --> 00:46:21.929
I am a Ph.D. but I am mad. It's like that.

00:46:23.971 --> 00:46:28.329
So many people mentally very well equipped in Sahaja Yoga, I know.

00:46:28.449 --> 00:46:32.407
But as far as the following of Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:46:32.527 --> 00:46:35.393
they are not there.

00:46:35.513 --> 00:46:38.290
So I am warning you now.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:42.121
It's like Christ has said, "some seeds which are sprouted

00:46:42.241 --> 00:46:45.503
fell on the street, dried out and died."

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.832
Now the judgment is going on all the time.

00:46:48.952 --> 00:46:53.206
When I am talking to you, it's all the judgment is going on.

00:46:53.635 --> 00:46:57.732
So every night you have to meditate.

00:46:57.852 --> 00:47:05.196
And you have to then think about what have you done tonight, today,

00:47:05.328 --> 00:47:08.998
 in the whole day what have you achieved.

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:17.350
But so calculating they are. Supposing I go there at five o'clock

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:22.907
then I have to be back at 7 otherwise I will miss the point,

00:47:23.027 --> 00:47:26.572
I will not see this person, that person.

00:47:26.692 --> 00:47:30.845
So, everything works like that:

00:47:31.098 --> 00:47:36.202
with the time, with the importance of nonsensical things.

00:47:36.322 --> 00:47:40.227
What has to work is your faith:

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.776
that I am going to do things

00:47:43.896 --> 00:47:48.329
which are truthful, which are sensible, down to earth

00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:56.066
and I'm going to keep myself absolutly extremely free and

00:47:56.186 --> 00:48:02.925
  and I'm going to look after not only my inner being

00:48:03.045 --> 00:48:06.730
but the inner being of others.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:13.466
Today's special puja is really of more Right side I would say,

00:48:13.586 --> 00:48:16.057
Dussehra is a right side Puja

00:48:16.177 --> 00:48:21.945
because you worship Shri Rama and his bow and everything.

00:48:23.126 --> 00:48:29.590
But think of these incarnation. Fourteen years He went to jail.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:33.790
For a particular reason, He went there.

00:48:34.877 --> 00:48:39.677
I mean, if somebody has to go even for one year, it's a headache.

00:48:39.797 --> 00:48:44.452
It's not a jail but it's, we can call, in the forest that He went,

00:48:44.572 --> 00:48:49.230
it was like a jail to Him. He was a king's son.

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:51.895
He had no place to live, to sleep.

00:48:52.015 --> 00:48:55.503
Everywhere He went, He had to build His own little hut.

00:48:55.623 --> 00:48:59.972
So He went there. He had to do it.

00:49:00.092 --> 00:49:02.917
Why, why did He do it?

00:49:03.798 --> 00:49:08.364
Because He had faith in Himself. He is Shri Rama

00:49:08.484 --> 00:49:11.322
and He has to jolly-well do these things.

00:49:11.442 --> 00:49:15.007
He had faith in Himself. And He had faith in God Almighty

00:49:15.127 --> 00:49:20.252
that whatever He is doing, He is doing as a will of God.

00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:24.402
And that is what I have to do, finished.

00:49:24.522 --> 00:49:28.150
I don't care whether I have to face Ravana

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:32.031
or I have to face this or that, I don't care.

00:49:32.999 --> 00:49:38.000
I am a Sahaja yogi. I don't care.

00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:42.068
My job is to spread Sahaja Yoga, all right.

00:49:42.188 --> 00:49:47.807
My job is to cleanse myself up and know myself.

00:49:47.927 --> 00:49:51.319
This is my work, my job, and this is what I have to do.

00:49:51.439 --> 00:49:55.839
I am not bothered if I get admission in the school or not.

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:59.596
I am not bothered if somebody has to go by plane,

00:49:59.716 --> 00:50:02.563
so he gets a ticket or not.

00:50:02.683 --> 00:50:04.645
You just won't believe

00:50:04.765 --> 00:50:06.988
that you show your faith in yourself,

00:50:07.108 --> 00:50:11.311
you'll get the admission, you'll get the ticket,

00:50:11.431 --> 00:50:16.488
whatever you want it's there. It's all there.

00:50:16.608 --> 00:50:19.691
You don't have to strive for it.

00:50:19.811 --> 00:50:24.472
You don't have to bother for it. It's just there.

00:50:25.551 --> 00:50:29.392
It is. I mean, all My life it has been happening.

00:50:29.512 --> 00:50:35.950
Of course My faith is like solid, like Gibraltar, no question.

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:39.954
 Because I know what I am and I know what I am supposed to do.

00:50:40.074 --> 00:50:43.378
So My, for Me I have no problem.

00:50:43.498 --> 00:50:46.362
All the faith and I know everyone

00:50:46.482 --> 00:50:51.084
and I can say that I can make out a flying bird.

00:50:52.695 --> 00:50:56.200
May not show that. Sometimes I may say that, all right

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.288
this is good, this is that, but I know for definite

00:50:59.408 --> 00:51:02.772
what I am and what I have to do.

00:51:02.892 --> 00:51:06.288
In the same way, you have to know about yourself

00:51:06.408 --> 00:51:09.694
because it is a different category of people you are.

00:51:09.814 --> 00:51:12.923
You are not the ones who need protection from God,

00:51:13.043 --> 00:51:17.796
who need protection from the Mother, no.

00:51:18.446 --> 00:51:21.763
You have to give protections to others.

00:51:21.883 --> 00:51:24.436
It is you have to give light to others.

00:51:24.556 --> 00:51:26.833
You have to show them the path.

00:51:26.953 --> 00:51:33.235
So you are here for that purpose not for getting a house

00:51:33.355 --> 00:51:38.094
or a, what you call, income tax concession.

00:51:38.214 --> 00:51:43.251
You are not that for. All that nonsense you forget.

00:51:43.371 --> 00:51:46.830
Jolly-well, they'll have to give you concession.

00:51:47.535 --> 00:51:51.902
I, I live like that, absolutely. I am not bothered

00:51:52.022 --> 00:51:54.989
when I am traveling, whether there's a ticket or not

00:51:55.109 --> 00:52:00.053
whether there is, what you call, a seat or not. I am not bothered.

00:52:00.759 --> 00:52:05.524
I am not bothered at all. All right I am traveling.

00:52:05.644 --> 00:52:08.280
I don't even think I am traveling.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.240
I just think that I am there. That's all.

00:52:12.968 --> 00:52:15.383
So many things I say

00:52:15.503 --> 00:52:19.451
which looks so bombastic and looks so ego oriented,

00:52:19.571 --> 00:52:25.014
like I said, "This catholic church is about to finish."

00:52:25.134 --> 00:52:34.075
I said that. If it was someone else they'll say, "Perhaps, maybe."

00:52:39.604 --> 00:52:47.778
Now, so one has to change one's own language, the style.

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:55.690
And our understanding should be that we are a rough people.

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:59.883
We are rough as far as ourselves are concerned.

00:53:00.003 --> 00:53:04.480
With others we are kind, tender, and sweet.

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:09.040
But as far as we are concerned, we are not.

00:53:09.262 --> 00:53:12.840
Once it happened, we had a transfer

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.043
and we went into a house, very big house though,

00:53:16.163 --> 00:53:18.984
 but there was nothing to sleep upon. There was one bed,

00:53:19.445 --> 00:53:23.165
very small. My husband was sleeping. He just can't do like that.

00:53:23.285 --> 00:53:26.301
 I said, "All right, take a challenge." I slept on the ground.

00:53:26.421 --> 00:53:30.741
Next day, I had pain in the body. I told My body,

00:53:30.861 --> 00:53:36.214
"Behave yourself. You must learn how to sleep on stones also."

00:53:36.334 --> 00:53:40.661
And for one month I was sleeping on the ground, still.

00:53:41.423 --> 00:53:43.762
So you have to be harsh with your body.

00:53:43.882 --> 00:53:47.564
You have to be harsh with your mind which gives you ideas

00:53:47.684 --> 00:53:52.009
of materialism or of retarding your progress in spirituality.

00:53:52.945 --> 00:53:56.588
Now, escapes, escapes they find out.

00:53:56.708 --> 00:54:00.325
Ultimately, you come to the last point

00:54:00.445 --> 00:54:04.497
where you do not think about, say, material life

00:54:04.617 --> 00:54:07.205
 and you don't think of mental life

00:54:07.325 --> 00:54:12.058
 or so called these spiritual lives or anything but you think that

00:54:12.178 --> 00:54:15.411
it's all right, you are free from it and now you have become

00:54:15.531 --> 00:54:19.725
a very, very free person and you can do what you like.

00:54:19.845 --> 00:54:26.591
Supposing you reach a state like that then you just say, "Oh,

00:54:26.711 --> 00:54:33.439
I have reached that state, finished." How are we to believe?

00:54:33.559 --> 00:54:38.680
What's the proof that you have reached that state?

00:54:40.675 --> 00:54:45.924
You must show. Doesn't show but they say, "Ah, we are."

00:54:46.519 --> 00:54:48.654
There is a myth also in Sahaja Yoga:

00:54:48.774 --> 00:54:52.366
that senior, he is a very senior Sahaja yogi.

00:54:52.486 --> 00:54:54.586
 I mean, I don't understand.

00:54:54.706 --> 00:54:58.964
What is this? How can there be seniority in Sahaja yoga?

00:54:59.084 --> 00:55:03.236
Cannot be seniority. No question.

00:55:03.802 --> 00:55:08.114
Somebody is say, enters into the sea.

00:55:08.234 --> 00:55:13.658
Some are there for ages standing near the edge

00:55:13.778 --> 00:55:16.480
of the sea holding on to the earth

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.122
because they are afraid to swim

00:55:18.242 --> 00:55:21.240
and some people who have come only yesterday

00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:28.559
might be jumping and going ahead and doing, enjoying the sea.

00:55:28.689 --> 00:55:31.074
So how is it he is the senior?

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:36.557
We do not have this seniority business in Sahaja yoga.

00:55:37.511 --> 00:55:39.320
There's no seniority.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.640
And there's also another myth. Maybe this is an excuse. I don't know

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.437
what to say but it is a very common thing to say

00:55:46.557 --> 00:55:49.525
that he is a senior Sahaja yogi or he is a,

00:55:49.645 --> 00:55:54.975
after all he is a senior Sahaja yogi.

00:55:55.095 --> 00:55:56.978
 Can't understand.

00:55:57.098 --> 00:55:58.605
Like saying a donkey,

00:55:58.725 --> 00:56:02.634
"This donkey is senior. Another donkey is not."

00:56:08.332 --> 00:56:12.222
Then another thing that you suffer from very much

00:56:12.342 --> 00:56:19.803
much, very common is this that "Mother said so."

00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:24.195
Anybody will say, "Oh, Mother said to me,

00:56:24.315 --> 00:56:27.450
She called me and She said it."

00:56:27.982 --> 00:56:31.225
"What did She say?" "Oh you are a very great Sahaja yogi.

00:56:31.345 --> 00:56:34.547
You are this. You are that. You are that."

00:56:36.179 --> 00:56:38.896
Now there are two possibilities.

00:56:39.515 --> 00:56:45.136
One, I might have said it just to befool him.

00:56:47.534 --> 00:56:49.846
 I am Mahamaya.

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:59.014
Or maybe I must have said all this just to see that pamper his ego

00:56:59.134 --> 00:57:02.347
so that he gets to Sahaja Yoga

00:57:02.467 --> 00:57:06.279
and does something substantial than to eat my head.

00:57:08.218 --> 00:57:12.200
So, "Mother said so." Such a great Sahaja yogi,

00:57:12.331 --> 00:57:16.760
I am such and such, very bombastic words,

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.768
very bombastic language he would use.

00:57:22.259 --> 00:57:25.879
And then people, "Ah, what a Sahaja yogi!"

00:57:28.205 --> 00:57:35.480
So the judgment of a Sahaja yogi doesn't come from what he claims

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.532
but what he achieves.

00:57:40.397 --> 00:57:44.999
I have seen some Sahaja yogis are extremely arrogant also.

00:57:45.119 --> 00:57:46.757
Extremely arrogant,

00:57:46.877 --> 00:57:51.263
think no end of themselves. All that is there.

00:57:51.383 --> 00:57:54.270
So many Sahaja yogis I have seen of that kind,

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:56.840
that they are very, very arrogant

00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:01.249
and that they try to make a big show

00:58:01.369 --> 00:58:05.237
out of what great people they are.

00:58:05.357 --> 00:58:07.632
Humpty Dumpties, as they call them.

00:58:07.752 --> 00:58:13.105
All right, but what a Sahaja yogi who is not like that,

00:58:13.225 --> 00:58:16.073
 what is his style is?

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:19.573
He'll just watch. He will witness the whole thing

00:58:19.693 --> 00:58:23.570
just enjoy and laugh at what is happening.

00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:26.231
What is this man talking like this?

00:58:26.351 --> 00:58:29.410
What's the sense of his talking like this?

00:58:30.259 --> 00:58:35.996
A person who is a Sahaja yogi is a gem.

00:58:36.116 --> 00:58:43.221
Is a gem and gem for which you take him to anywhere, to any place,

00:58:43.341 --> 00:58:46.313
people will say he is a gem.

00:58:56.057 --> 00:59:05.470
My own style is this that when I see a person

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:11.808
or a Sahaja yogi anywhere, first thing I go inside Myself,

00:59:12.443 --> 00:59:18.180
first thing. I don't know if you can do that. I can.

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:23.678
And then I see that person in a very different perspective

00:59:23.857 --> 00:59:27.491
and understand. Because all these powers are with you also.

00:59:27.611 --> 00:59:30.354
It's not My powers only, you all have these powers

00:59:30.474 --> 00:59:32.760
 but the only difference between you and Me

00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:35.080
is that I have all faith in Myself

00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:38.040
and you have no faith in yourself.

00:59:46.636 --> 00:59:54.277
So we are at a crossing roads where we have to understand

00:59:54.397 --> 00:59:59.075
who will go higher and who will go lower.

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.244
You have to find out who is the one

01:00:02.364 --> 01:00:04.847
who is going to achieve something

01:00:04.967 --> 01:00:08.807
and where am I compared to that person.

01:00:10.572 --> 01:00:13.520
It's said, "You have to suffer. You have to do this.

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.305
You have to do that." Nothing of the kind, by God's grace.

01:00:17.425 --> 01:00:19.887
Nothing of that kind.

01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:29.706
So now what is it? What will happen to a Sahaja yogi?

01:00:29.904 --> 01:00:35.082
How will you know who is a Sahaja yogi?

01:00:35.202 --> 01:00:42.122
How will you know who is just putting a lip service?

01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:45.943
Only way is that you evolve.

01:00:46.063 --> 01:00:48.624
You become like a mirror

01:00:48.744 --> 01:00:53.864
and you see for yourself what sort of a person he is

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:59.200
and also you see yourself, what you are.

01:00:59.842 --> 01:01:04.240
Today's lecture is more, sort of,

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.205
is actually absolutely inspired lecture.

01:01:08.325 --> 01:01:11.641
And it is the one that should tell you

01:01:11.761 --> 01:01:16.473
that all that we have done today

01:01:16.593 --> 01:01:25.218
is this to understand our own values about our own life.

01:01:25.338 --> 01:01:28.979
We should understand: "Why are we on this earth?

01:01:29.099 --> 01:01:34.707
What is our purpose and what you have to achieve?"

01:01:35.842 --> 01:01:42.505
See, this I give you My all blessings from My heart.

01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:48.682
And I want you to accept My blessings,

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:58.840
to be the great lights of God's desire.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:04.381
Try to understand what important time you are born

01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:13.494
and that you have become such good, beautiful people of God.

01:02:14.073 --> 01:02:16.950
May God bless you!
