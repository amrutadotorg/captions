WEBVTT

11:28.650 --> 11:36.488
Today we are going to worship

11:37.047 --> 11:49.306
the principle of Mahalakshmi in Belgium.

11:57.689 --> 12:11.056
Belgium has a speciality that it creates
glass bangles for the Mother.

12:22.490 --> 12:35.830
That is, the bangles which are used

12:36.031 --> 12:41.744
as a beautiful musical accompaniment

12:41.945 --> 12:50.574
to the gait, to all the movements
of the Goddess.

13:01.490 --> 13:08.212
It brings a delicacy in a woman;

13:15.753 --> 13:24.450
and gives a consciousness to the man
or the men

13:24.650 --> 13:28.820
that there are ladies around.

13:39.410 --> 13:51.530
And the ladies are around who are married
ladies, are very auspicious.

13:59.970 --> 14:08.169
And this auspiciousness is the one that
is going to bring

14:08.370 --> 14:16.306
in this country or in any country
whatsoever all the blessings.

14:24.370 --> 14:35.098
Also in Sanskrit language a bangle is
called as Valaya,

14:41.593 --> 14:52.195
and that is the last stage which one has
to reach in one’s ascent.

14:57.513 --> 15:01.275
That means the complete.

15:06.010 --> 15:12.609
Also, we are having here a puja for Holland

15:12.810 --> 15:22.567
which is the Jala Devata, is the Goddess
of water.

15:29.435 --> 15:36.441
It comes from the word “marine”,
the word Mary, Maria.

15:36.650 --> 15:43.176
All these words come from the word
“marine”.

15:51.810 --> 15:58.615
In Holland as you know, the sea is above
the land.

16:04.770 --> 16:13.552
We can say that the Guru is sitting
at a higher position than the chela.

16:23.850 --> 16:31.673
And His knowledge is channelized
into various channels.

16:40.580 --> 16:50.500
And all the wealth, the money, that is
earned out of marine activities

16:50.701 --> 16:57.819
flow through the greatness of this ocean.

17:15.014 --> 17:21.137
So Dutch people are highly blessed people.

17:26.609 --> 17:37.687
They are very tall because Dattatreya is
a very tall personality.

17:51.001 --> 18:02.071
And if they become conscious of their
position,

18:02.810 --> 18:14.414
one day Dutch can do a lot in the realm
of God's work.

18:21.690 --> 18:29.685
But all the time trouble in both
the countries has come

18:29.886 --> 18:38.680
because they have not paid any respect
to their Guru, which is the ocean.

18:49.970 --> 18:55.729
They exploited and took advantage
of the sea,

18:55.930 --> 19:05.495
but never realised what the sea means
in the religious aspect.

19:15.290 --> 19:22.386
The Lakshmi came out of the sea;

19:25.970 --> 19:31.530
that is the wealth that has come out
of the sea.

19:34.073 --> 19:38.965
But the wealth has to be like a Lakshmi.

19:40.410 --> 19:47.970
The Lakshmi has a motherly nature.

19:48.171 --> 19:52.679
She's a mother. She's a mother.

19:58.835 --> 20:03.957
She is standing on a lotus.

20:05.450 --> 20:10.834
That means She does not throw her weight
anywhere.

20:15.393 --> 20:19.297
Like people go and occupy other territories

20:19.498 --> 20:26.897
and use them for their own purpose will
never give them Lakshmi principle.

20:37.349 --> 20:43.715
Only thing that may happen to them is
to get some money for the time being.

20:43.916 --> 20:49.685
But they say Lakshmi is chanchal; means
She is all the time shifting and She shifts.

20:49.886 --> 20:55.491
Such a Lakshmi is chanchal, is shifting.

21:10.525 --> 21:18.607
Lakshmi has got one hand which is giving,
like this.

21:21.647 --> 21:27.908
Another hand She has got by which She
protects people.

21:33.540 --> 21:39.367
In two hands She has got pink lotuses.

21:43.170 --> 21:48.214
The pink lotus suggests the warmth.

21:53.970 --> 22:03.658
A person who has got Lakshmi has to have
warmth in his household.

22:11.454 --> 22:19.373
He must have in his heart warmth to receive
people.

22:26.779 --> 22:32.209
A lotus flower receives even a horrible
beetle,

22:32.410 --> 22:36.370
black beetle which has got all kinds
of thorns in it

22:36.546 --> 22:43.365
and allows it to sleep overnight as a nice
guest.

22:55.675 --> 23:01.321
In the corona of the lotus there is
beautiful spread

23:01.522 --> 23:05.650
of the yellow coloured pollen

23:05.850 --> 23:15.791
on which this beetle rolls and enjoys
the comfort.

23:26.676 --> 23:33.723
And the lotus watches the enjoyment
of the beetle.

23:38.810 --> 23:43.787
It does not get disturbed. It does not get
upset

23:43.988 --> 23:54.101
and when the lotus opens out, the beetle
just goes away.

24:01.282 --> 24:06.614
And the lotus still grows, it doesn't die
out.

24:12.281 --> 24:18.142
In modern life, we don't want guests

24:21.600 --> 24:28.502
and if some guests come in the house they
dare not even spoil the carpet.

24:35.440 --> 24:43.871
We clean the house; we polish all our
silver and all our brass,

24:44.072 --> 24:50.280
but we don't want even a little rat to come
inside.

25:01.207 --> 25:05.668
For whom are we doing all this work?

25:08.760 --> 25:16.601
There are no children in the house and
the old people are in the old house.

25:20.400 --> 25:24.050
Children are in the hostels.

25:26.840 --> 25:31.771
And the husband, wife are in the divorce
case.

25:37.863 --> 25:43.723
But they are very particular about their
brass being polished.

25:45.304 --> 25:50.207
So the whole polish has come outside.

25:54.193 --> 26:03.242
So the beauty of lotus flower is that it is
all embracing.

26:09.747 --> 26:13.440
It's a very motherly principle.

26:13.640 --> 26:19.689
It tolerates any type of nonsense from
the beetle.

26:27.792 --> 26:34.802
So one of the aspects of Mahalakshmi

26:35.003 --> 26:39.960
is Gruhalakshmi, is the one who is
the housewife.

26:46.408 --> 26:52.919
And if this aspect is spoiled, then we
cannot have Lakshmi in our house;

26:53.120 --> 26:56.714
we cannot have wealth in our house.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.160
The Lakshmi will disappear from all such
houses

27:07.360 --> 27:12.676
where the housewife is not respected

27:16.160 --> 27:20.538
or the housewife is not respectable.

27:23.800 --> 27:31.719
The another aspect of that Lakshmi tattwa is

27:31.920 --> 27:39.508
that She gives protection to some people.

27:43.522 --> 27:53.130
That means ashraya means there are people
who are supported by such a person.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.731
I do not know how you people run your
orphanages here

28:04.932 --> 28:07.608
or how you manage your charities.

28:07.809 --> 28:13.766
But in India, if a man or a woman gets
money beyond a certain point,

28:13.967 --> 28:22.717
she will take out at least one tenth
of that money for charities.

28:39.088 --> 28:49.169
And she will also have or he will have money
or any shelter or anything for people

28:49.370 --> 28:56.988
who are working for him, ashraya, working
for him.

29:06.938 --> 29:14.299
I have seen many people who are rich,
but they are extremely beggarish.

29:20.120 --> 29:24.207
They have no dignity of any kind.

29:27.031 --> 29:34.253
They will come to your house and they may
even ask for an empty tin.

29:36.614 --> 29:40.066
Translator: An empty tin? Shri Mataji:
Empty tin, yeah. There are people.

29:40.267 --> 29:43.198
Translator: What is empty tin?
Yogi: Empty can.

29:43.399 --> 29:49.788
Shri Mataji: Empty can. Translator: Oh!
Oh, sorry. I didn’t understand.

29:55.550 --> 29:59.092
Shri Mataji: Or else if you go to their
house

29:59.293 --> 30:07.062
they'll give you or offer you something
which is leftover.

30:12.096 --> 30:16.933
So there is no dignity of any kind in this.

30:17.967 --> 30:21.828
It's without any self respect.

30:22.703 --> 30:28.589
Because if you have self respect, how can
you behave like this?

30:32.159 --> 30:43.417
Then there is another aspect of Lakshmi
where She is proud like an elephant.

30:46.816 --> 30:50.421
She has a propensity.

30:51.800 --> 30:55.561
She is not like a mosquito.

30:56.062 --> 31:00.657
I mean, many people think that these days
to be mosquitoes is very good,

31:00.858 --> 31:08.437
but, I think, if you have mosquito-like
personality nobody respects you.

31:18.760 --> 31:27.679
They all think you must be some sort of
a typist or maybe some sort of a person

31:27.880 --> 31:30.239
or doing some sort of menial work

31:30.440 --> 31:36.025
or working very hard that you have lost
all your weight.

31:43.979 --> 31:52.379
So a Lakshmi has to have a gravity.

31:59.551 --> 32:04.582
But nowadays, the whole thing is changed.

32:08.072 --> 32:13.789
I knew Belgian people long time back;
they were all having some propensities.

32:13.990 --> 32:17.140
They were rich people.

32:27.583 --> 32:30.731
Even the Dutch.

32:31.892 --> 32:34.999
But now both the countries have perhaps
become poor,

32:35.200 --> 32:39.516
so people look like mosquitoes to Me.

32:53.064 --> 33:00.895
So a person who has got money doesn't jump
like a monkey,

33:01.096 --> 33:04.906
but walks like an elephant;

33:13.860 --> 33:16.995
in a dignified manner.

33:17.196 --> 33:24.909
But sometimes, I have seen in the west
people walk like horses.

33:30.024 --> 33:37.814
In India, we had a wedding and we all
ladies were walking in the procession,

33:40.480 --> 33:46.679
and we saw one lady in the middle
of the whole crowd

33:46.887 --> 33:53.614
just coming up and down like a yo-yo.

34:00.713 --> 34:06.645
So we couldn't understand what was this,
who is this lady.

34:09.007 --> 34:14.691
Then we discovered that one Indian had
married an American lady,

34:19.480 --> 34:22.680
and when she was walking she was walking
like a horse

34:22.920 --> 34:29.025
between all the Indian women singing,
she was walking like a horse, you see.

34:37.855 --> 34:42.639
So you have to be like an elephant when
you walk, Gaja Gamini.

34:42.840 --> 34:49.365
That's one of the names of the Goddess;
She walks like an elephant in a swingy way.

34:53.634 --> 34:56.977
The reason you see also...

34:57.178 --> 34:59.879
(Aside to the translator) Did you say that?
Translator: Yes, Shri Mataji.

35:00.080 --> 35:04.851
Shri Mataji: ...and the Kundalini also,
you see, doesn't agree very much

35:05.052 --> 35:08.582
with the horse movement.

35:11.952 --> 35:15.477
Because, if you move the Kundalini up
and down, up and down,

35:15.678 --> 35:18.968
She doesn't know where to go!

35:30.576 --> 35:34.830
But you see elephant's walk is
left, right, left, right, left, right.

35:35.031 --> 35:41.844
It goes up, properly, keeping the central
path.

35:47.908 --> 35:52.639
So it's not very, very good to walk
in that fashion,

35:52.840 --> 35:58.139
if you have to establish Sahaja Yoga
properly.

36:07.760 --> 36:14.626
Now the Mahalakshmi principle comes out
of the Lakshmi principle.

36:19.160 --> 36:23.435
That is when you have wealth and when
you have acted

36:23.636 --> 36:28.679
according to the image of the Lakshmi

36:28.880 --> 36:33.794
then the Mahalakshmi principle rises
within you.

36:44.123 --> 36:46.838
Now the Mahalakshmi tattwa, the principle

36:47.039 --> 36:56.838
is that you start thinking only about
your Spirit.

37:02.992 --> 37:09.202
When you are absolutely satisfied with
the material wealth,

37:11.208 --> 37:16.397
then you start coming to the Spirit.

37:18.760 --> 37:21.293
It was nice that people were seeking

37:21.494 --> 37:27.858
material wealth and had industrial
revolution in a way.

37:33.536 --> 37:39.080
But as a result of that you do not find
that the greed has gone down,

37:39.251 --> 37:43.147
on the contrary, it has increased.

37:47.059 --> 37:51.708
And... Translator: Sorry, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: Sorry.

37:52.600 --> 37:57.043
And the lust has become so perverted.

38:00.936 --> 38:08.013
So we can find very clearly that we have
failed the principle of Lakshmi

38:08.214 --> 38:16.300
in our societies, in our families, in our
governments.

38:28.032 --> 38:35.479
So the understanding of Spirit is only
possible for people

38:35.680 --> 38:43.338
who have understood the meaning of Lakshmi
principle, first of all.

38:50.480 --> 38:56.456
So the purpose of Lakshmi is only fourfold;

38:57.888 --> 39:03.047
first is, that you have to give.

39:04.040 --> 39:06.800
It is not like in the church they will say:
“All right,

39:07.000 --> 39:11.322
you have to give your money, give it
to me”, it's not that.

39:16.405 --> 39:22.408
Because I don't want anything. But you
have to be generous by nature,

39:25.200 --> 39:28.370
and not miserly.

39:29.280 --> 39:37.206
Supposing you have one door open, no air
will come in.

39:40.920 --> 39:45.159
Only the air that is sufficient for
the room will be there,

39:45.360 --> 39:54.691
and there won't be any entry of new air
or more air or any draught inside.

39:58.587 --> 40:02.278
But if you open the door, another one,

40:02.479 --> 40:07.331
then you will find there will be
a circulation of air.

40:11.054 --> 40:18.297
So by generosity, the circulation starts
and you solve your material problems.

40:26.920 --> 40:31.462
The another principle which we should
follow - one of generosity -

40:31.663 --> 40:36.334
another of supporting others.

40:42.959 --> 40:49.085
Especially among Sahaja Yogis we should
try to help each other.

40:53.032 --> 40:58.839
May not be with money, but with moral
support.

41:00.994 --> 41:05.399
But if you have to support sometime,
someone with money

41:05.573 --> 41:10.239
you should do it voluntarily without
even thinking

41:10.440 --> 41:15.140
that you are doing any obligation on that
person.

41:24.800 --> 41:32.427
Or else, you can think that, “I am doing
this just for my own pleasures.”

41:38.304 --> 41:49.147
The third great quality of the Lakshmi
tattwa is that it is respectful to everyone.

41:53.217 --> 41:55.840
But we see the other way round, everywhere.

41:56.048 --> 42:01.759
A person when he becomes rich, he becomes
very arrogant.

42:05.809 --> 42:09.040
That's a sign as we say, of a nouveau
riche, a person

42:09.240 --> 42:14.408
who has suddenly got the money and he
doesn't know what to do.

42:19.593 --> 42:22.963
Supposing somebody is sitting on a donkey,
and suddenly

42:23.164 --> 42:26.015
he gets a Cadillac; then what will happen
to him?

42:26.216 --> 42:29.824
He won't be able to bear that.

42:43.128 --> 42:50.864
So this quality is we have that we should
respect others,

42:51.065 --> 42:58.472
and we should understand that if we have
money we haven't got everything.

43:07.840 --> 43:15.568
For example, in India a saint is respected
higher than anybody else;

43:18.200 --> 43:21.680
higher than all the artists, higher than
all the painters,

43:21.880 --> 43:29.155
higher than all the kings, all
the governments, highest is the saint.

43:40.192 --> 43:44.573
So if you are a rich person, you will be
known

43:44.774 --> 43:50.614
by your respectful behaviour towards
everyone.

43:58.080 --> 44:05.747
This respectful behaviour, you can also
show to things of others.

44:10.455 --> 44:16.507
But such a person would respect the all
auspicious things.

44:20.384 --> 44:27.749
Like, there could be a small monkey nut,
but is say vibrated;

44:27.966 --> 44:34.621
should be much more important than
the diamond of the same size.

44:44.680 --> 44:48.720
So this quality, when it develops in
a human being

44:48.921 --> 44:54.356
then we can say the Mahalakshmi principle
has started.

45:01.751 --> 45:07.156
Now in all of you Mahalakshmi principle
has been awakened.

45:09.655 --> 45:13.916
Mahalakshmi resides in the Sushumna nadi

45:16.280 --> 45:22.687
and Sushumna is developed only up
to a point in human beings.

45:24.768 --> 45:27.567
It is later on,

45:27.768 --> 45:36.034
like a bridge built in, is created by
Mahalakshmi principle;

45:45.000 --> 45:48.614
that means a person who is satisfied,
who is in balance,

45:48.815 --> 46:00.442
who is dharmic: his ocean becomes desirous
of becoming the clouds

46:00.680 --> 46:08.567
of this Sushumna nadi or the path
of Sushumna.

46:31.776 --> 46:39.935
This desire creates this path, this bridge
of Sushumna within us.

46:45.079 --> 46:49.844
Unless and until Mahalakshmi principle
is awakened within us,

46:50.045 --> 46:53.175
we cannot make the Kundalini pass properly

46:53.376 --> 46:58.064
because it will always get lost
in the Void.

47:09.360 --> 47:17.664
So the dignity, the respect of a Sahaja
Yogi will always help him

47:17.865 --> 47:26.183
to build this path of Sushumna over
the Void.

47:41.400 --> 47:47.959
It is not some sort of an artificial
respect, or an artificial etiquette,

47:48.160 --> 47:54.369
but is a feeling from inside, a kind
of a state

47:54.570 --> 47:59.359
human beings reach where they feel that
it is important

47:59.560 --> 48:04.334
that we have to be respectful to everybody.

48:20.798 --> 48:28.329
But the Lakshmi principle disappears with
certain things which we must know.

48:33.728 --> 48:36.950
First of all, it is said in Marathi
language,

48:37.151 --> 48:42.887
that if a bottle comes from the door,

48:43.120 --> 48:47.913
the Lakshmi goes, runs away from
the window.

48:53.887 --> 49:00.003
So the bottle must be kept out if you want
to keep Lakshmi inside.

49:02.080 --> 49:07.399
Then another thing is the badha. When
a person gets possessed

49:07.600 --> 49:13.249
anywhere if there is darkness, then
Lakshmi runs away.

49:19.920 --> 49:26.975
In these circumstances, one must try
to clear out so that there is no problem.

49:27.176 --> 49:31.944
If there is a badha, then money-wise
you cannot be all right,

49:32.145 --> 49:35.201
whatever you may try.

49:44.080 --> 49:49.571
These two things if you look after,
the Lakshmi will stay.

49:55.480 --> 50:03.674
And on the satisfaction of that Lakshmi,
you will build up your path of Sushumna.

50:12.944 --> 50:18.983
So for today, I have told you what is
a Mahalakshmi principle is.

50:20.560 --> 50:24.399
Now if Mahalakshmi principle is awakened
within us,

50:24.600 --> 50:29.297
then the Lakshmi just runs after us.

50:34.751 --> 50:40.496
In the western culture, what we have done
is to bring Lakshmi

50:40.697 --> 50:46.704
to the level of only money, that also
in paper.

50:57.750 --> 50:59.610
And it is so artificial,

50:59.811 --> 51:04.842
that people don't know how suddenly
they become bankrupt.

51:12.400 --> 51:16.853
So the innate Lakshmi principle is to be
understood

51:17.054 --> 51:24.599
that you Sahaja Yogis have a special
responsibility

51:24.800 --> 51:30.478
for all these western countries which are
slowly

51:30.679 --> 51:39.513
losing all their wealth and the Third World
will have all the money.

51:44.702 --> 51:47.273
Translator: We are responsible
for, Shri Mataji?

51:47.474 --> 51:51.099
Shri Mataji: Nothing. I’m just telling.

52:14.552 --> 52:19.567
I'll tell you what; we didn't create
so many machineries in the Third World,

52:19.784 --> 52:22.827
because these machineries are just
like devils.

52:23.028 --> 52:28.079
They go on taking away all that is
materially important,

52:28.280 --> 52:32.367
all the matter they eat and create
all kinds of nonsense

52:32.568 --> 52:37.079
like plastic, this, that. And once
something goes from their mouth

52:37.280 --> 52:40.920
and whatever comes out is of no use
later on.

52:41.086 --> 52:45.493
So all those things are becoming useless.

53:06.576 --> 53:13.520
So all the indiscriminate use of these
kinds of policies have exhausted

53:13.721 --> 53:20.730
all your material wealth which was there
from the Mother Earth.

53:32.235 --> 53:40.964
Now when that is exhausted, then on which
you can depend is your paper money.

53:49.063 --> 53:52.680
I've always said that machine is for you
and you are not for machine.

53:52.881 --> 54:02.253
So why go into the complete subjection
of the machinery like this?

54:11.553 --> 54:14.656
Now the computer has come. And after
sometime

54:14.871 --> 54:21.244
our computer will be useless, and we will
be just using the other computer.

54:36.064 --> 54:39.479
But situation may arise that there will be
nothing to eat,

54:39.680 --> 54:44.084
there will be nothing to create, only you
will be making 1, 2, 3, 4, 5;

54:44.285 --> 54:48.280
and add them up and subtract them.

54:57.463 --> 55:00.423
So now one should stop and go back
a little bit

55:00.680 --> 55:06.469
and see where have we gone wrong.
Let us correct at that point.

55:14.789 --> 55:23.984
And once one realises that it is important
to keep a balance on the Nabhi chakra,

55:24.200 --> 55:31.200
then the Mahalakshmi tattwa is properly
manifested.

55:40.120 --> 55:42.639
Also it is vice versa.

55:42.845 --> 55:47.405
If your Mahalakshmi tattwa is awakened
as it is awakened in you;

55:47.606 --> 55:54.998
you can create balance, being auspicious
in nature.

56:02.519 --> 56:11.355
Through you, it will happen that
the prosperity will come back.

56:16.768 --> 56:22.479
When I went to Italy first time, they told
Me there are three problems.

56:22.680 --> 56:30.702
One is mafia, another is violence and
the third is poverty.

56:38.440 --> 56:44.728
And all that looked so great like
a mountain,

56:44.929 --> 56:49.917
has all dissolved into thin air now.

57:02.255 --> 57:05.445
And the day may come when Italians

57:05.683 --> 57:11.267
will enjoy the greatest of wealth.

57:19.775 --> 57:24.106
And... Translator: We'll send the tape
to Guido, Shri Mataji.

57:24.307 --> 57:28.479
Shri Mataji: And, and we will discover
one more thing

57:28.680 --> 57:34.531
that so far, all the Europeans used
to laugh at Italians.

57:42.240 --> 57:45.706
look down upon them,

57:47.560 --> 57:53.062
though they were the source of your art,
your music,

57:53.263 --> 57:58.517
all kinds of beautiful creativity.

58:04.767 --> 58:08.782
But you all used to laugh at them.

58:16.007 --> 58:24.159
Because they were rich in their heart and
simple hearted, dignified,

58:24.360 --> 58:29.624
they did not put their pressures on you.

58:30.904 --> 58:37.891
So their Lakshmi tattwa has become
Mahalakshmi principle.

58:41.400 --> 58:45.239
In the same way, I would request you
the Sahaja Yogis,

58:45.440 --> 58:48.201
not to worry as to what is happening
around,

58:48.402 --> 58:54.812
but to worry what is happening inside and
build up your Mahalakshmi principle.

59:01.074 --> 59:03.791
Once you have built up your Mahalakshmi
principle,

59:04.007 --> 59:07.557
you will have no problem at all.

59:11.200 --> 59:16.938
Then through you the Mahalakshmi Herself
will work

59:20.120 --> 59:25.585
and fill your countries with great bounties

59:29.360 --> 59:32.847
and great joys.

59:35.439 --> 59:38.757
May God Bless you all.
