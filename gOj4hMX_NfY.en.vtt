00:26:24.834 --> 00:26:29.000
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Mataji Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

00:26:29.042 --> 00:26:32.876
Laughter

00:26:32.876 --> 00:26:36.417
Singer: One Jai Kara we will make

00:26:36.417 --> 00:26:50.167
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Mataji Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

00:26:50.209 --> 00:26:54.375
SY: Who will take out such a long breathe?

00:26:54.417 --> 00:26:56.751
Singer: Take out your breathe to say Jai for Maa

00:26:56.792 --> 00:27:00.000
The breath that Mother has given, keep it on.

00:27:00.042 --> 00:27:02.709
Maa gives you breathe, Maa will give you breathe.

00:27:02.751 --> 00:27:04.876
You try it and see how far your breath will go

00:27:04.959 --> 00:27:05.000
Shri Mataji: Good!

00:27:05.042 --> 00:27:19.974
Singer: Say, Adi Shakti Nirmala Mata Ji ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

00:27:19.999 --> 00:27:20.999
Shri Mataji: it went on for a pretty long time.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.792
Everybody laughs.

00:27:25.834 --> 00:27:27.130
Shri Mataji: You see one thing is there

00:27:27.155 --> 00:27:28.459
that Your Sahastrara opens when you clap.

00:27:28.459 --> 00:27:31.999
Check it with your hands, because the whole Sahastrara opens

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Vibrations improve absolutely.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
This is the benefit of clapping

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
See, immediately the Sahastrara opens.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Sahastrara is in our hands and feet.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.209
But here (Shri Mataji shows on HER palms) when you clap

00:27:42.334 --> 00:27:44.125
You are hitting your chakras

00:27:44.167 --> 00:27:46.000
Actually, when we clap like this ( Shri Mataji shows on HER palms)

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Chakras are surely hit by chakras

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.209
Immediately, this Sahastrara opens.

00:27:50.292 --> 00:27:51.751
Specially for void

00:27:51.792 --> 00:27:53.304
A person who has problem of void,

00:27:53.329 --> 00:27:55.412
or have been harmed by some Gurus

00:27:55.452 --> 00:28:00.709
 should clap their hands rigorously in kawaali

00:28:00.751 --> 00:28:06.167
and those who used to be kawaals, used to sing in praise of Gods

00:28:06.209 --> 00:28:10.042
For example bhajans, but now they have changed the format of Kawaalis

00:28:10.083 --> 00:28:12.042
Earlier ladies would not sing at all

00:28:12.042 --> 00:28:15.000
and even if they would sing, they would sing collectively

00:28:15.042 --> 00:28:19.250
But now the format of Kawaali is absolutely vulgar

00:28:21.834 --> 00:28:26.334
This is not the real format of kawaali.

00:28:26.334 --> 00:28:30.876
Amir Khusro Sahib introduced Kawaali.

00:28:31.042 --> 00:28:35.292
Amir Khusro Sahab. He was the disciple of Aulia Nizzamudin.

00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:40.592
And he in his daily language and daily life

00:28:40.617 --> 00:28:42.997
introduced poetry in such a way

00:28:43.022 --> 00:28:44.709
For example, Babul Mera Naihar Chuto Jaye,

00:28:44.751 --> 00:28:45.667
It has all been written by him.

00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:49.459
In daily songs, marriages and all other functions

00:28:49.584 --> 00:28:53.834
he has written about Gods in such a way that it cannot be understood

00:28:53.876 --> 00:28:55.334
but a person sings in appreciation of Gods.

00:28:55.709 --> 00:29:00.000
Very Beautiful! He introduced it.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
He introduced that by hitting all it will be okay

00:29:02.083 --> 00:29:05.626
He introduced Kawaali.

00:29:05.709 --> 00:29:07.824
And it used to be first at their Dargah (Shrine ).

00:29:07.849 --> 00:29:09.000
and then at Chishti's

00:29:09.042 --> 00:29:12.667
And today a great Kawaal had come there

00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:17.876
Most probably named Nusrat Hussain Sahab from Pakistan

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:22.000
As soon as he saw ME, he said, "Mother How are you here?"

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.417
In the midst of all he said,"Mother, please sit in the front."

00:29:25.459 --> 00:29:29.751
He took ME and made ME to sit in the front seat and started singing.

00:29:29.792 --> 00:29:30.751
And said, "Today i am singing in my true form

00:29:30.751 --> 00:29:31.142
as you are sitting in front of me."

00:29:31.167 --> 00:29:33.000
You see he doesn't even know anything about ME

00:29:34.667 --> 00:29:37.792
But he is his disciple.

00:29:37.918 --> 00:29:40.834
At Aulia Nizzamudin Sahab's Dargah also

00:29:40.876 --> 00:29:43.417
the earning hands reached there too.

00:29:43.792 --> 00:29:45.125
In the beginning I said nothing.

00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:50.417
I told somebody that this Nizzam Sahab was a self realised soul.

00:29:50.626 --> 00:29:51.709
Some people went there

00:29:51.709 --> 00:29:54.000
And since that day they started offering money.

00:29:54.542 --> 00:29:56.876
His relatives started collecting money there.

00:29:56.918 --> 00:29:59.751
Oh! you are sitting at their door, collect something else as well.

00:29:59.834 --> 00:30:01.250
He is collecting  the same thing.

00:30:03.209 --> 00:30:04.667
Here Nizzamuddin Sahiba

00:30:04.709 --> 00:30:06.959
And Chishtis also, they were all Awllias.

00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:10.125
And Awlia is the same, who is called Peer

00:30:10.167 --> 00:30:12.751
or what we call realized souls.

00:30:12.792 --> 00:30:13.918
It is one and the same thing.

00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:15.250
There is no difference in that.

00:30:15.292 --> 00:30:16.125
It is one and the same thing.

00:30:16.167 --> 00:30:18.792
It is only we who quarrel unnecessarily.

00:30:18.834 --> 00:30:19.627
Let them do

00:30:19.667 --> 00:30:21.375
As many heads they break, is good because it is a nuisance.

00:30:21.667 --> 00:30:24.167
Those who are fools, let them break their heads

00:30:24.334 --> 00:30:25.626
Later they will all come to their senses.

00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:27.277
S.Y: Same thing is going on in Punjab.

00:30:27.302 --> 00:30:28.934
Shri Mataji: They are all fools.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.621
Now just tell, Nanak Sahab, He only was Muhammad Sahab

00:30:35.293 --> 00:30:37.298
All of them said one thing only

00:30:37.547 --> 00:30:39.748
Mohammad Sahab thought that now they have started fighting

00:30:39.773 --> 00:30:41.944
as He had come as Nanak Sahab

00:30:42.527 --> 00:30:44.504
Worked so hard, did everything

00:30:44.529 --> 00:30:46.766
and now see what a show is going on.

00:30:48.019 --> 00:30:49.772
They will come to senses.

00:30:51.651 --> 00:30:54.779
It is necessary for them to learn a lesson, I think.

00:30:55.196 --> 00:30:58.316
Unless fanaticism doesn't get exposed openly

00:30:58.517 --> 00:30:59.726
till then it will not be visible.

00:30:59.751 --> 00:31:02.495
Hindus must observe it, Muslims must observe it

00:31:02.557 --> 00:31:04.769
Sikhs must observe, what a foolishness it is.

00:31:05.157 --> 00:31:07.141
They will understand only when they will observe it.

00:31:07.173 --> 00:31:09.113
Otherwise, the Rakhshasas will not be visible

00:31:09.138 --> 00:31:10.341
and will thrive deep inside

00:31:10.722 --> 00:31:12.938
So, what is called starking in the front

00:31:12.963 --> 00:31:14.586
It is existing in the forefront

00:31:14.611 --> 00:31:16.649
How much foolishness is it!

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:19.501
Where have we landed in the name of religion?

00:31:19.526 --> 00:31:20.807
Is it a religion?

00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:21.879
Is it God?

00:31:22.537 --> 00:31:24.092
One who is the Giver

00:31:24.117 --> 00:31:28.468
One who is God Rahim, is Ram, how can He be like that?

00:31:31.548 --> 00:31:33.336
There is no comparison between Nanak Sahab and these people.

00:31:33.361 --> 00:31:36.789
Among Hindus also there is too much of cruelty

00:31:36.814 --> 00:31:37.588
That is why recently

00:31:37.613 --> 00:31:40.645
I used MY TEEKA ASTRA (weapon to criticize openly) for the Brahmins.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.262
(UNClEAR)

00:31:42.287 --> 00:31:44.123
felt that I was sitting in the slums of Brahmins.

00:31:44.148 --> 00:31:46.160
(UNCLEAR)

00:31:46.185 --> 00:31:49.078
You have created such a mockery of God's images

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.143
 have ways and means of earning money.

00:31:52.497 --> 00:31:54.516
But now it has its somewhat effect on the people.

00:31:54.541 --> 00:31:55.420
It is showing its effect.

00:31:55.482 --> 00:31:56.915
It will have to be said!

00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.669
Otherwise how will Dharma be established?

00:31:59.697 --> 00:32:01.057
We have established Vishwa Dharma

00:32:01.082 --> 00:32:02.970
all the dharmas will merge into that.

00:32:02.995 --> 00:32:04.901
Because all this is Adharam in the name of Dharma.

00:32:04.947 --> 00:32:06.750
 It is bad name of God.

00:32:06.778 --> 00:32:09.569
 Whosoever sees it feels what a foolishness it is!

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:12.329
That is why many people have no faith in God.

00:32:14.131 --> 00:32:15.723
The same thing happened in Algeria

00:32:15.748 --> 00:32:17.740
There the people saw that they are fundamentalists

00:32:17.765 --> 00:32:21.001
They are forcing they are very cruel, they are killing everyone

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:23.903
Iraq is killing Iran and vice versa.

00:32:23.928 --> 00:32:26.346
They thought that communism is better.

00:32:26.371 --> 00:32:29.648
Five hundred people took to communism.

00:32:30.118 --> 00:32:33.348
Out of them got influenced by us in London.

00:32:33.645 --> 00:32:36.547
He said, God exists, Communism is telling lies.

00:32:36.572 --> 00:32:39.052
We have not to be scared of any fundamentalism.

00:32:39.077 --> 00:32:41.102
We are standing on our own ideals.

00:32:41.127 --> 00:32:43.070
Five hundred people got their realization

00:32:43.095 --> 00:32:45.372
came by aeroplane and got their realization.

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:48.283
It will be like that only

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.343
Many Sikhs are also there. Many Sikhs had come to Birmingham

00:32:51.368 --> 00:32:53.289
They still come here.

00:32:53.314 --> 00:32:55.139
Everybody will come to senses.

00:32:55.164 --> 00:32:57.499
They see what is it!

00:32:57.524 --> 00:32:59.681
Where are they unnecessarily jumping into the sea?

00:32:59.706 --> 00:33:01.362
When the talk is going on about God

00:33:01.387 --> 00:33:02.373
one should rise towards sky.

00:33:02.443 --> 00:33:04.280
All are jumping into the sea

00:33:04.335 --> 00:33:06.141
fighting amongst themselves

00:33:06.166 --> 00:33:07.689
Is it a joke?

00:33:07.714 --> 00:33:10.512
I mean to say the way they are getting agitated like this

00:33:10.537 --> 00:33:12.730
and especially those who are

00:33:12.755 --> 00:33:15.707
 Sikhs, like Maharashtrians

00:33:15.732 --> 00:33:16.323
they are in Maharashtra.

00:33:16.348 --> 00:33:18.036
They got scared

00:33:18.061 --> 00:33:19.684
that they will kill us too.

00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:22.812
They are already killing them, they will kill us too.

00:33:22.837 --> 00:33:25.215
But now they will be alright.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.268
Let them be sensible.

00:33:26.293 --> 00:33:27.863
They have become too much fanatics.

00:33:27.888 --> 00:33:29.306
There is a need to be sensible.

00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:31.145
Everybody needs to be sensible.

00:33:37.794 --> 00:33:39.440
They will be better now.

00:33:39.465 --> 00:33:44.056
For some time let them get punished.

00:33:44.065 --> 00:33:45.620
No body dies.

00:33:45.645 --> 00:33:47.190
Nobody is going to die.

00:33:47.229 --> 00:33:48.589
You give up this worry.

00:33:48.614 --> 00:33:50.988
This should happen to show it to the world

00:33:51.065 --> 00:33:52.863
so that it becomes clear.

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:55.734
Just now I read in the newspaper

00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:57.357
a Sikh has been arrested.

00:33:57.382 --> 00:34:00.304
He says that all these Sikhs do smuggling.

00:34:01.248 --> 00:34:03.744
Binderwallas smuggle drugs.

00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:06.759
and i do this work to catch hold of them.

00:34:06.992 --> 00:34:10.308
You see, they have been arrested.

00:34:10.897 --> 00:34:12.831
Those who talk about God

00:34:12.856 --> 00:34:14.255
talk about temples

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.526
talk about mosques

00:34:15.551 --> 00:34:17.597
what concern they have with smuggling.

00:34:17.939 --> 00:34:19.484
It is just a contrast

00:34:19.509 --> 00:34:21.043
One is darkness

00:34:21.068 --> 00:34:22.061
the other is light.

00:34:22.086 --> 00:34:24.027
Both these can never be together.

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:33.605
Can't understand how do people accept it.

00:34:34.088 --> 00:34:35.088
This is the situation.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:38.690
But it is so!

00:34:39.405 --> 00:34:39.882
Not only this,

00:34:39.907 --> 00:34:42.128
all those who are great Popes

00:34:42.154 --> 00:34:44.777
Popes and

00:34:44.802 --> 00:34:46.841
others like maphia

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:48.995
Maphia and Pope are just one with each other, do you know?

00:34:49.066 --> 00:34:50.686
and they have got one bank

00:34:50.711 --> 00:34:54.128
and all these owners of Switzerland banks are great thieves.

00:34:54.162 --> 00:34:56.580
Have collected the unauthorized money all over the world

00:34:57.045 --> 00:34:57.727
and you will be surprised

00:34:57.752 --> 00:34:59.591
the place where our programme was organized

00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:01.164
in Calvinist church

00:35:01.189 --> 00:35:02.739
just in front of that was the bank

00:35:02.764 --> 00:35:04.268
and they were arrested there only.

00:35:05.449 --> 00:35:07.168
There only all the three were arrested.

00:35:07.193 --> 00:35:08.808
All of them very fraudulent

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.852
Maphia, pope and swiss bank

00:35:12.854 --> 00:35:13.854
all the three in competition.

00:35:15.742 --> 00:35:21.293
most fraudulent had collected and created a problem

00:35:21.301 --> 00:35:23.154
are getting exposed, they are getting exposed.

00:35:23.179 --> 00:35:25.099
This is the best way now a days

00:35:25.124 --> 00:35:26.394
that let all be exposed

00:35:26.816 --> 00:35:27.816
and come to an end with that.

00:35:32.502 --> 00:35:33.650
In these swiss banks

00:35:33.675 --> 00:35:35.799
the money is of the fraudulent of all over the world

00:35:35.824 --> 00:35:38.778
roam all over the world with a red cross.

00:35:38.833 --> 00:35:42.511
It has the money of people all over the world.

00:35:44.526 --> 00:35:47.069
How should such people be recognized?

00:35:51.761 --> 00:35:56.249
The question is that these people have settled themselves all over.

00:35:56.356 --> 00:35:57.063
And who are these people?

00:35:57.111 --> 00:35:59.700
They are from masonic lodge.

00:36:00.185 --> 00:36:01.185
They are mesons.

00:36:01.906 --> 00:36:04.320
Those who were secretive earlier, they are those thieves.

00:36:04.852 --> 00:36:07.957
They thought if you have to steal, better steal something worthwhile.

00:36:10.191 --> 00:36:13.400
By secretly participating in masonic lodge

00:36:13.425 --> 00:36:14.441
they became secretives

00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:17.262
and by mutual help ruined Swiss bank.

00:36:21.514 --> 00:36:23.994
This is the situation.

00:36:24.517 --> 00:36:25.760
In such a world

00:36:25.785 --> 00:36:27.565
if they have to establish Sahajyoga then

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:31.048
with a great effort, set its foundation deep

00:36:31.073 --> 00:36:33.921
first settle down their mutual differences and come up.

00:36:34.637 --> 00:36:36.890
The greatest thing is to put an end to their mutual differences

00:36:38.017 --> 00:36:39.339
have to spread Sahajyoga

00:36:39.364 --> 00:36:40.265
all have to do it collectively.

00:36:41.991 --> 00:36:43.115
It is not possible without that.

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:45.073
It cannot be done without joint efforts.

00:36:45.098 --> 00:36:47.440
We can win only by collective efforts and by nothing else.

00:36:47.479 --> 00:36:49.790
Only with the collective efforts we can win over such things.

00:36:49.815 --> 00:36:51.118
They are all alone everywhere.

00:36:51.949 --> 00:36:54.557
But how can we win is by collectivity.

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.617
And in Delhi there is a great need of the growth of collectivity.

00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:01.879
Here everyone is Prime Minister of India.

00:37:02.411 --> 00:37:05.548
That is a great problem.

00:37:06.449 --> 00:37:09.822
But it is good that now a days bhoots are after the Prime Minister.

00:37:09.847 --> 00:37:11.633
They will be after you too.

00:37:11.658 --> 00:37:12.956
Shri Mataji laughs

00:37:12.981 --> 00:37:15.723
If you think that you are Prime Minister

00:37:15.748 --> 00:37:18.293
you will have to walk with four Aides.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.145
Singer: We will proceed with Mother
 Shri Mataji: Yes, it is so!

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.982
Shri Mataji: yes, now you sing one more song.

00:37:26.372 --> 00:37:30.576
Singer: A sahajyogi proceeds forward with Mother's energy

00:37:30.632 --> 00:37:32.815
Doesn't have to be a Prime Minister.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.544
That is what I am telling.

00:37:34.569 --> 00:37:39.188
By being in such a falsehood, it is not possible to move smoothly.

00:37:39.213 --> 00:37:44.845
By living in simplicity kundalini has no problem.

00:37:44.963 --> 00:37:47.756
There should be no crookery in any case

00:37:47.781 --> 00:37:50.523
But you see what type of crooks are in the world?

00:37:50.548 --> 00:37:52.071
They are dependent on God.

00:37:52.096 --> 00:37:55.342
If anyone follows Sahajyoga, then he settles down.

00:37:55.367 --> 00:37:58.040
I am not the responsible for that. You are responsible for that.

00:37:58.267 --> 00:38:03.844
If you yourself want to go to filth, what can I do?

00:38:04.504 --> 00:38:06.612
How long can we stop them?

00:38:06.637 --> 00:38:10.774
You take your decision, where to go?

00:38:10.868 --> 00:38:13.272
You take decision on the New Year's Day

00:38:13.297 --> 00:38:15.579
that we have to follow Sahajyoga only.

00:38:15.671 --> 00:38:16.596
We have to follow Sahaj yoga.

00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:17.769
What is the meaning of ''Sahaj mein uttarna hai''?

00:38:17.811 --> 00:38:19.783
After acquiring your own power

00:38:19.808 --> 00:38:23.913
knowing your own glorious tales you have to move forward.

00:38:23.938 --> 00:38:25.621
What is so great about it?

00:38:26.913 --> 00:38:28.862
Tell ME what is the other way apart from Sahaj?

00:38:28.887 --> 00:38:31.113
The rest are all misleading routes.

00:38:31.138 --> 00:38:33.137
I can't see any other route.

00:38:34.922 --> 00:38:37.967
The path which is going to give you everything is SAHAJ MARG

00:38:37.992 --> 00:38:40.327
Then follow that. Leave everything else.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:46.761
That is why I said there is no need to fast.

00:38:46.786 --> 00:38:49.002
Fasted on Karwa Choth

00:38:49.128 --> 00:38:50.366
They were ladies of U.P

00:38:50.391 --> 00:38:54.211
Are the rest of the ladies bad those who do not keep this fast?

00:38:54.236 --> 00:38:56.269
For the time being told her not to keep fast.

00:38:56.294 --> 00:38:58.293
They vomitted so much

00:38:58.318 --> 00:39:02.002
that next day they stood in front of ME, holding their ears

00:39:02.022 --> 00:39:03.197
I asked them,"What happened?"

00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:04.860
They said," Mother by mistake we observed the

00:39:04.885 --> 00:39:06.384
fast of KARWACHOTH yesterday and fell sick."

00:39:06.661 --> 00:39:08.448
I said,"You see I didn't make you fall sick.

00:39:08.473 --> 00:39:10.328
I had beforehand told you not to keep the fast on KARWACHOTH."

00:39:10.393 --> 00:39:11.541
They said earlier they would not have it like this.

00:39:11.566 --> 00:39:13.282
I said, "Earlier you had caught hold of snake in ignorance.

00:39:13.307 --> 00:39:15.237
 Now don't hold it when you have knowledge."

00:39:19.229 --> 00:39:21.306
If you want to fast, do it there is no problem.

00:39:21.331 --> 00:39:24.108
But don't do it in the name of God.

00:39:24.133 --> 00:39:25.803
You don't gain any thing by defaming HIM.

00:39:26.435 --> 00:39:27.386
HE is giving you everything

00:39:27.425 --> 00:39:29.564
Even then you want to fast, do so.

00:39:32.363 --> 00:39:34.393
So, whatever Mother says

00:39:34.418 --> 00:39:37.426
even though you may feel it strange

00:39:37.451 --> 00:39:40.532
but try to understand that this is the truth.

00:39:41.302 --> 00:39:43.779
This has been going on for the past so many years.

00:39:43.804 --> 00:39:45.428
It has no meaning.

00:39:45.517 --> 00:39:47.515
If there has been any foolishness going on for the past so many years

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.441
are you still going to do this foolishness?

00:39:49.544 --> 00:39:50.903
 Has it helped you in any way?

00:39:51.871 --> 00:39:52.885
Another thing is

00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:54.391
as I was telling Dr. Sahab

00:39:54.416 --> 00:39:56.444
Everybody says, It has never been so earlier.

00:39:56.469 --> 00:39:58.302
If it has not been so, but it will be so someday.

00:39:58.571 --> 00:40:01.462
It will take place some day.

00:40:01.487 --> 00:40:03.082
Whenever it will take place

00:40:03.107 --> 00:40:04.720
it will be said that it didn't happen earlier.

00:40:04.745 --> 00:40:06.144
Should it take place just after its birth?

00:40:06.247 --> 00:40:08.315
Should it take place just after the world creation?

00:40:09.347 --> 00:40:11.707
Such type of arguments go on like this.

00:40:11.732 --> 00:40:14.926
Because of that If a person wants to run away from Sahaj yoga

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.962
the door is open for him but he who wants to sit

00:40:17.987 --> 00:40:19.136
there is a a seat reserved for him.

00:40:19.162 --> 00:40:21.484
All of you settle down.

00:40:21.509 --> 00:40:23.598
I want all of you to settle down perfectly in Sahajyoga.

00:40:23.679 --> 00:40:26.538
This is the first thing. Everything happens later on.

00:40:28.859 --> 00:40:29.859
and settle down people.

00:40:31.313 --> 00:40:33.369
As you said: Maa you came in the form of flame.

00:40:33.394 --> 00:40:34.788
What will flame do single handed?

00:40:34.813 --> 00:40:36.344
Many flames are required.

00:40:36.369 --> 00:40:38.617
We need many flames from one flame.

00:40:38.642 --> 00:40:40.891
Only then there will be light.

00:40:41.169 --> 00:40:42.853
Had it been possible by ME alone

00:40:42.878 --> 00:40:46.929
Why would I have requested you people to settle down?

00:40:47.183 --> 00:40:51.664
One who prays to God for the betterment, move ahead smoothly

00:40:51.689 --> 00:40:53.922
You only are on the stage, not I

00:40:53.947 --> 00:40:57.356
You are on the stage. The world is watching you.

00:40:57.648 --> 00:41:00.507
Understand that the world is watching you, not to ME.

00:41:01.035 --> 00:41:04.639
They have taken that out, saying that this is Devi.

00:41:04.664 --> 00:41:07.027
I cannot be Devi.

00:41:07.052 --> 00:41:09.789
The point is that they have made a Devi

00:41:09.814 --> 00:41:12.102
Rest you handle.

00:41:17.213 --> 00:41:20.899
Delhiites are otherwise also sitting on the stage on their own.

00:41:20.908 --> 00:41:23.072
on the throne

00:41:23.097 --> 00:41:25.970
Bakasurs are sitting on the stage.

00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:27.417
They are sitting in the gallery.

00:41:27.442 --> 00:41:31.438
You are sitting on the threshold of God

00:41:31.463 --> 00:41:34.023
You sit there. People will watch you only.

00:41:34.048 --> 00:41:38.559
People sitting on the threshold

00:41:38.584 --> 00:41:41.674
will watch what are people living in Delhi doing?.

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:46.684
It is a great responsibility.

00:41:46.709 --> 00:41:49.007
There is a great responsibility on people living in Delhi.

00:41:49.032 --> 00:41:51.336
What do you have to say?

00:41:51.595 --> 00:41:57.374
Lekhak ji (writer) Yes, say!

00:41:57.399 --> 00:42:01.480
Yes, write down

00:42:01.505 --> 00:42:03.100
(UNCLEAR)

00:42:03.146 --> 00:42:05.856
It is the best

00:42:05.928 --> 00:42:08.773
 Deepa didn't come today?

00:42:08.798 --> 00:42:10.468
She is in Dharmshala

00:42:10.556 --> 00:42:12.136
Shri Mataji: She is in Dharamshala.

00:42:12.161 --> 00:42:14.819
S.Y: She is much better.

00:42:21.992 --> 00:42:22.992
Yes, you come!

00:42:25.808 --> 00:42:26.808
Open it.

00:42:33.324 --> 00:42:36.781
Fix it at bottom.

00:42:36.852 --> 00:42:51.528
music

00:42:51.553 --> 00:42:53.098
Shri Mataji to the singer: Your face has changed.

00:42:53.123 --> 00:42:57.848
Singer: Everything has wholly changed.

00:42:57.991 --> 00:43:02.988
Shri Mataji to a Sahajyogi: Just see! his face, saintly!

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:09.131
Musician: Yesterday there was a great miracle.

00:43:09.156 --> 00:43:12.672
People have defamed me. Tomorrow i will tell on the stage.

00:43:12.697 --> 00:43:26.974
Rashtrapati has given me in written, result and certificate (UNCLEAR)

00:43:26.999 --> 00:43:31.276
I got President's award, people talked all nonsense.

00:43:31.301 --> 00:43:39.277
They are talking like that. They cannot defame MOTHER'S son.

00:47:39.995 --> 00:47:41.236
It is great!

00:47:41.564 --> 00:47:54.648
Don't become Pandits now. It is really great!

00:47:54.728 --> 00:48:00.819
Actually, voice is vibrating.

00:48:01.122 --> 00:48:07.704
Because of the vibrations, it is cooling.

00:48:08.228 --> 00:48:12.188
When you sing you feel vibrates, your voice reverberates.

00:48:12.213 --> 00:48:13.923
The same is the case with him too.

00:48:13.948 --> 00:48:16.079
When he had sung earlier it was not so

00:48:16.104 --> 00:48:23.968
but since he is in (Sahaj) his voice vibrates.

00:48:24.341 --> 00:48:27.093
It is like a echo

00:48:28.141 --> 00:48:34.247
It is called PRATISATH in Sanskrit.

00:48:34.272 --> 00:48:39.878
Beautiful! He is doing so great!

00:48:39.903 --> 00:48:45.332
Such pronunciation of Sanskrit

00:48:45.403 --> 00:48:47.491
I have not heard such pure pronunciation among Punjabis.

00:48:47.516 --> 00:48:51.626
I am telling you the truth.

00:48:51.651 --> 00:48:54.331
I too have studied in Punjab.

00:48:54.538 --> 00:48:57.502
The language of that place is such

00:48:58.121 --> 00:49:01.403
And even Hindi speaking people pronounce SPASHT as ASPASHAT

00:49:01.737 --> 00:49:05.899
But I have never heard such pure pronunciation in Sanskrit language.

00:49:05.924 --> 00:49:07.821
I am telling you the truth. It is great!

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:11.267
It is great! It should be so.

00:49:17.378 --> 00:49:23.648
S.Y: Basically, Mother it is the effort of Rajesh.

00:49:23.775 --> 00:49:27.615
He has started after coming here only.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.961
(UNCLEAR)

00:49:30.358 --> 00:49:33.520
Shri Mataji: Look at Rajesh as well!

00:49:33.545 --> 00:49:36.791
Now a days he is studying Gyaneshwari.

00:49:38.307 --> 00:49:42.224
S.Y: He is the one who started (UNCLEAR) Last time when he came,

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.490
Rustam and he came that was the day this whole started.

00:49:45.522 --> 00:49:46.145
Shri Mataji: Oh! Really!

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:47.007
S.Y: About a week ago.

00:49:47.032 --> 00:49:52.258
Then started Sanskrit. Rustam didn't know DEVNAGRI LIPI(script)

00:49:52.298 --> 00:49:53.167
Can you imagine?

00:49:53.192 --> 00:49:55.705
He didn't know Devnagri.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:58.821
He never studied Devnagri. He studied in English school

00:49:58.885 --> 00:49:59.930
then stayed in England.

00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:01.496
He didn't know Devnagri.

00:50:01.521 --> 00:50:02.406
He studied Sanskrit

00:50:02.431 --> 00:50:04.695
and is writing MY names in Sanskrit.

00:50:04.721 --> 00:50:07.162
He has already written one thousand names.

00:50:08.013 --> 00:50:09.588
S.Y: Has Rustam written?

00:50:09.613 --> 00:50:13.998
 Shri Mataji: Yes, He has written one thousand names.

00:50:14.157 --> 00:50:15.394
S.Y: He is a Sanskrit scholar.

00:50:15.419 --> 00:50:16.716
Shri Mataji: He has become a Sanskrit scholar

00:50:16.764 --> 00:50:17.764
S.Y: And very inspired.

00:50:17.852 --> 00:50:20.240
Shri Mataji: Yes, even Gregoire!

00:50:20.505 --> 00:50:24.678
Gregoire has become a Sanskrit scholar.

00:50:25.442 --> 00:50:27.299
Absolutely Sanskrit scholar.

00:50:30.239 --> 00:50:36.251
How does the result of Sahajyoga come out?

00:50:36.403 --> 00:50:37.939
Because one who doesn't know even Devnagri

00:50:37.971 --> 00:50:40.106
Gregoire never not even Hindi words

00:50:40.153 --> 00:50:42.526
It is worth noticing, how beautifully he writes!

00:50:44.405 --> 00:50:47.150
One who didn't know even A,AA,I,EE (Devnagri Script)

00:50:48.065 --> 00:50:49.065
How did it happen?

00:50:49.104 --> 00:50:52.123
Our Babba doesn't know Urdu at all.

00:50:52.148 --> 00:50:53.101
I still know a little bit of it.

00:50:53.126 --> 00:50:54.352
not even a little bit of Urdu.

00:50:54.377 --> 00:50:57.984
But the poetry he has done in Urdu

00:50:58.015 --> 00:50:58.591
You listen to him.

00:50:58.616 --> 00:51:01.354
MY brother, he is a Chartered accountant.

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.922
He didn't know even the name of poetry, what is poetry

00:51:04.112 --> 00:51:07.381
He was just like a stone hearted in this field.

00:51:07.406 --> 00:51:10.270
He writes (Poetry) so beautifully, so marvelous.

00:51:11.529 --> 00:51:13.322
(UNCLEAR)

00:51:13.590 --> 00:51:15.034
He has started writing very deep (poetry)

00:51:15.455 --> 00:51:17.794
He has named himself 'Dilosh'

00:51:17.819 --> 00:51:19.572
means NIRMAL

00:51:22.553 --> 00:51:24.726
named himself, very good (poetry) he writes.

00:51:24.751 --> 00:51:28.717
MY brother himself wonders, where do YOU get these words from?

00:51:28.815 --> 00:51:29.583
says: i don't know.

00:51:29.608 --> 00:51:30.270
says I give him.

00:51:30.295 --> 00:51:32.194
I said some words I too don't know.

00:51:32.219 --> 00:51:38.302
How does one know? It is so great!

00:51:38.427 --> 00:51:40.147
He has started writing very nicely.

00:51:40.172 --> 00:51:42.286
It is so surprising how. How does one bloom?

00:51:42.397 --> 00:51:45.265
(UNCLEAR) poetry I never expected from him.

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:49.106
He is a Chartered accountant.

00:51:49.183 --> 00:51:53.292
Except Math and counting he has heard no other sound.

00:51:53.317 --> 00:51:55.110
I don't know from where he got this thing.

00:51:55.607 --> 00:51:57.353
And says, i go on writing.

00:51:57.378 --> 00:51:59.183
Now he is writing in Marathi.

00:51:59.208 --> 00:52:02.963
His Marathi language was so weak, that I used to write his essays.

00:52:03.014 --> 00:52:06.179
He is writing in Marathi.

00:52:06.204 --> 00:52:09.346
He is writing in Hindi, but out of all, the best he writes in Urdu.

00:52:10.474 --> 00:52:12.106
[ SHERO SHAYIRI ] poet's expression in poetic manner

00:52:12.131 --> 00:52:14.323
and there are no rhyming words at all.

00:52:16.649 --> 00:52:19.407
It should be said that there is actual poetry in him.

00:52:19.432 --> 00:52:20.945
Actual poetry!

00:52:21.144 --> 00:52:23.468
There is nothing useless

00:52:23.493 --> 00:52:24.573
Nothing useless!

00:52:24.598 --> 00:52:27.169
Do you see this MILAN KI SHAYIRI (poetry of union) we have got?

00:52:27.194 --> 00:52:30.126
The earlier poetry was all about gloominess

00:52:30.151 --> 00:52:31.552
VIRAH KI SHAYIRI [poetry of separation]

00:52:31.577 --> 00:52:32.976
Now it is poetry of union.

00:52:33.505 --> 00:52:36.242
You set it in his song

00:52:37.051 --> 00:52:39.638
There are so many

00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:43.583
but they were not so popular.

00:52:48.799 --> 00:52:51.233
S.Y: It is coming right from the heart.

00:52:51.258 --> 00:52:52.735
He is writing right from the heart.

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:54.127
Shri Mataji saying about HER brother:

00:52:54.254 --> 00:52:57.125
It is remarkable for him to write poetry.

00:52:57.150 --> 00:53:00.267
I know he is conditioning poetry very well.

00:53:00.290 --> 00:53:03.588
Because of Marathi he had little difficulty

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:05.845
I used to sit with him to teach him poetry.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:09.446
I would tell him that by telling you, I will lose my poetry.

00:53:09.471 --> 00:53:11.189
It doesn't enter even your head.

00:53:11.245 --> 00:53:14.103
He would ask: Why do they write?

00:53:14.128 --> 00:53:15.878
Why don't they write in a straight forward manner?

00:53:15.903 --> 00:53:18.906
writing about moon and this and that in a twisted manner

00:53:18.932 --> 00:53:19.943
it is better to say

00:53:19.967 --> 00:53:23.275
it seems (UNCLEAR)

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.478
When he was young

00:53:24.503 --> 00:53:26.027
when he was in Matric

00:53:26.106 --> 00:53:28.546
(UNCLEAR)

00:53:28.571 --> 00:53:30.822
Would say why did they need to write all this?

00:53:30.847 --> 00:53:32.451
It has caused my headache.

00:53:32.476 --> 00:53:34.837
If one has to learn this Marathi language

00:53:34.862 --> 00:53:35.586
it is a great headache.

00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:36.430
I would tell him don't learn Marathi

00:53:36.455 --> 00:53:37.998
He would say it is compulsory, what to do?

00:53:38.023 --> 00:53:40.715
Such was his condition.

00:53:41.129 --> 00:53:44.088
In Marathi he would just pass or fail.

00:53:44.998 --> 00:53:46.477
He is good at Mathematics.

00:53:46.502 --> 00:53:48.391
But I could not understand

00:53:48.416 --> 00:53:50.859
from where this new flower has bloomed.

00:53:50.913 --> 00:53:55.035
It happened like this that somewhere

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:59.651
you can say for example that a lotus has bloomed out of a rose

00:53:59.676 --> 00:54:05.069
(UNCLEAR)

00:54:05.094 --> 00:54:10.535
It is like that, can't understand anything

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.692
But it means, what an unusual, strange and

00:54:13.717 --> 00:54:15.871
an unprecedented event is going on.

00:54:15.895 --> 00:54:18.232
but like this something must come out of everybody.

00:54:18.257 --> 00:54:20.793
some miracles should take place, then it will be recognized.

00:54:21.539 --> 00:54:23.911
He (singer) is also saying that he will tell some miracle

00:54:23.936 --> 00:54:25.572
A great miracle he has come across.

00:54:25.597 --> 00:54:28.039
S.Y: Yes, really!

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:29.675
Shri Mataji: What you are saying

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.271
the reason for that is only that you are NISHKALANK (pure)

00:54:32.451 --> 00:54:34.468
Nobody can disgrace you!

00:54:34.493 --> 00:54:38.023
If somebody tries, he cannot disgrace you.

00:54:38.103 --> 00:54:43.213
Nobody can disgrace you, even a little bit

00:54:43.238 --> 00:54:46.047
Even if you think that this person is disgracing you

00:54:46.072 --> 00:54:49.350
You will see that this disgrace will be on his face.

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:55.478
In Illustrated Weekly Rajneesh sent a woman

00:54:55.503 --> 00:54:57.808
bribed her, to interview ME.

00:54:57.832 --> 00:55:00.392
and made a third Muslim lady to write

00:55:00.417 --> 00:55:02.339
and in that some wrong statements were

00:55:02.364 --> 00:55:04.954
that SHE is such

00:55:04.979 --> 00:55:09.294
HER ways are such that SHE mesmerizes. All nonsense.

00:55:09.318 --> 00:55:10.876
My husband got very angry.

00:55:10.901 --> 00:55:13.217
Especially, my brother took a dagger.

00:55:13.243 --> 00:55:15.861
Both of them said, "Now we have to drag them to the court."

00:55:15.886 --> 00:55:17.700
I told them, I am not going to the court.

00:55:17.725 --> 00:55:19.736
If you want to put up a case, you go, I am not going to the court.

00:55:19.808 --> 00:55:20.812
(UNCLEAR)

00:55:20.837 --> 00:55:22.250
I asked them what will you do?

00:55:22.276 --> 00:55:24.556
There in London people told them

00:55:24.581 --> 00:55:26.981
that they should put up a case for ten lakhs.

00:55:27.256 --> 00:55:28.490
I said, " I won't go to the court."

00:55:28.522 --> 00:55:30.268
You do whatever you want to do.

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:31.522
It is not going to pay you any dividend.

00:55:31.547 --> 00:55:32.665
I made them to understand a lot.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:35.387
I told Rajesh to talk to them.

00:55:35.412 --> 00:55:37.430
Tell them to ask for forgiveness

00:55:37.455 --> 00:55:39.129
so that this matter will be over.

00:55:39.154 --> 00:55:41.281
I don't like this court business.

00:55:41.857 --> 00:55:43.713
When nobody came to any agreement

00:55:43.738 --> 00:55:46.829
The Illustrated Weekly came to closure for six months.

00:55:46.893 --> 00:55:49.147
And they had a loss in terms of Crores.

00:55:54.361 --> 00:55:59.121
Then their employees went on a strike.

00:55:59.813 --> 00:56:02.972
Then they sent a message.

00:56:02.997 --> 00:56:06.127
They are saying why you had written against our Mataji

00:56:06.152 --> 00:56:07.396
we will go on strike.

00:56:07.421 --> 00:56:09.143
I said that they have written long back.

00:56:09.168 --> 00:56:11.086
Why are you going on a strike now?

00:56:11.195 --> 00:56:13.655
Already they have been punished

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:16.188
But they won't change.

00:56:16.810 --> 00:56:19.966
You have to set right first of all, newspaper agencies.

00:56:20.321 --> 00:56:23.011
Now you tell ME what is the need to write what Rajneesh is saying?

00:56:23.432 --> 00:56:27.685
Now a days it is Ravan UVACHA (what did Ravana say?)

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:30.953
S.Y: That is a fact.

00:56:30.978 --> 00:56:33.826
Shri Mataji: This is the Geeta of modern times.

00:56:34.196 --> 00:56:35.974
What useless he is talking?

00:56:35.999 --> 00:56:37.498
They get a lot of pleasure by publishing it.

00:56:37.523 --> 00:56:38.791
Don't know why?

00:56:39.226 --> 00:56:41.071
And now a days he is in Goa.

00:56:41.096 --> 00:56:43.056
Now a days we can see some more people.

00:56:43.081 --> 00:56:44.647
As bed bugs multiply

00:56:44.672 --> 00:56:48.324
so can be seen two to four such people in Poona.

00:56:48.533 --> 00:56:49.797
They will all be taken into account.

00:56:49.822 --> 00:56:52.678
They will surely reach Poona.

00:56:52.703 --> 00:56:55.016
Poona!

00:56:55.041 --> 00:56:58.302
They are coming out at wrong place.

00:56:59.929 --> 00:57:00.867
All this

00:57:00.892 --> 00:57:02.399
Their techniques are like

00:57:02.424 --> 00:57:05.107
it appears to be like a group

00:57:05.576 --> 00:57:07.223
They help each other.

00:57:07.248 --> 00:57:09.171
We too should have our strong group.

00:57:09.196 --> 00:57:11.272
Question doesn't arise that anybody can touch you!

00:57:11.297 --> 00:57:12.599
We should live like this.

00:57:12.907 --> 00:57:14.198
We are all one.

00:57:14.223 --> 00:57:15.190
We should have one aim.

00:57:15.215 --> 00:57:16.974
We should know this aim.

00:57:16.999 --> 00:57:20.450
Then you will enjoy your dividends yourself.

00:57:21.211 --> 00:57:25.064
But when we don't know that aim, we face problems.

00:57:27.785 --> 00:57:28.876
We have come to Delhi.

00:57:28.901 --> 00:57:30.673
We have to do something or the other here.

00:57:30.698 --> 00:57:32.088
It is New Year!

00:57:32.113 --> 00:57:34.742
You do whatever you desire.

00:57:34.768 --> 00:57:36.568
In the evening we have pujan

00:57:36.593 --> 00:57:38.584
We will see then.

00:57:38.609 --> 00:57:42.785
But all these desires should be for the betterment of everyone.

00:57:43.812 --> 00:57:46.553
Not for yourself, I take care of you.

00:57:46.578 --> 00:57:49.415
There is no worry about you. It should for everyone.

00:57:49.543 --> 00:57:50.999
It should be for the group.

00:57:51.024 --> 00:57:52.389
It should be for others.

00:57:52.414 --> 00:57:53.525
Not for yourself.

00:57:53.550 --> 00:57:55.319
You for yourself have (surrendered to ME)

00:57:55.344 --> 00:57:58.435
You said that you have surrendered yourself to ME

00:57:58.499 --> 00:58:01.711
I am already managing you.

00:58:05.037 --> 00:58:07.347
You have to take care of the whole world.

00:58:07.372 --> 00:58:11.144
Specially, We have to take care of Delhi.

00:58:12.467 --> 00:58:14.906
Is it okay!
