00:05.320 --> 00:11.120
One should not feel guilty, but face the problem,

00:11.400 --> 00:16.400
why it has not worked and the problem lies with Sahaja Yogis and nobody else.

00:16.600 --> 00:20.120
You shouldn’t blame anybody else for it.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.720
Just see yourself, what mistakes you must have committed.

00:23.800 --> 00:28.280
Could be a small or big mistake, whatever it is, face it.

00:28.360 --> 00:32.120
There’s no harm in saying, “I have done mistake.”

00:32.200 --> 00:36.400
But if you say, “Sorry,” means it goes there [in the left Vishuddhi], straight forward.

00:36.560 --> 00:40.160
No, “I have committed a mistake.”

00:40.240 --> 00:45.200
To admit that is very gracious, very beautiful

00:45.280 --> 00:48.440
and very kind to yourself for your benevolence.

00:48.520 --> 00:54.160
In Sahaja Yoga it’s one of the biggest mantras for all the Western people.

00:54.240 --> 01:00.160
They should all the time say to all the trees, all the nature around

01:00.240 --> 01:02.520
“I am not guilty”.

01:02.600 --> 01:06.520
Your ecological problem will improve

01:07.760 --> 01:11.720
because then you won’t do wrong things to spoil your ecology,

01:11.800 --> 01:14.720
you’ll be careful because you spoil it and you’ll feel guilty,

01:14.800 --> 01:17.800
“Oh, I should not have done this. Oh, I should not.”

01:17.880 --> 01:20.880
But why did you do in the first place is the point.

01:20.960 --> 01:24.000
So now, next time you are not going to do it.

01:24.080 --> 01:31.280
So many of our problems will be solved if we face them and correct them boldly.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.680
It’s possible for Sahaja Yogis because you are separated from your being; you’re away from it.

01:36.760 --> 01:42.120
You can see your body, you can see your mind, you can see your ego,

01:42.200 --> 01:46.640
you can see all of those things and you know how to put them right.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.880
You are not that, you know, so you are the Spirit

01:50.960 --> 01:55.880
and with the light of the Spirit you can correct all these things.

01:56.040 --> 01:59.920
But this guilt is something where it stops you completely

02:00.000 --> 02:03.760
from correcting or doing anything better about it

02:03.840 --> 02:10.520
or bringing any constructive thing to your own mind.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.680
This will solve many problems for America,

02:13.760 --> 02:17.400
as well as for all the Western world.

02:17.480 --> 02:22.920
Same with the Indians, that they should not think that if they are generous a little bit

02:23.000 --> 02:27.280
they can get rid of their mistakes, you see, they have to face it.

02:27.360 --> 02:30.160
It’s a different style, Indians are very clever,

02:30.240 --> 02:33.680
you know, they know how to find excuses and escapes.

02:33.760 --> 02:38.280
But, after all, it is Vishnumaya.

02:38.360 --> 02:42.760
She will show you that there is no escape, just face it.

02:42.840 --> 02:48.560
There’s no need to condemn yourself, no need to, in any way, degrade yourself

02:48.640 --> 02:52.760
or to feel inferior, but to be superior as the spirit,

02:52.840 --> 02:55.040
“Oh, I see, I watch.”

02:55.120 --> 02:59.160
Like I would say, “All right, Nirmala, I see you very well now, ah you did this.”

02:59.240 --> 03:01.240
Separate yourself from yourself.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.800
You can talk on the mirror.

03:03.880 --> 03:09.600
You can go to the river and talk there or you can go to an ocean and tell them that:

03:09.680 --> 03:14.280
“See, I’ve done this mistake and now I’m not going to do it.”

03:14.360 --> 03:17.000
You can make promises to all of these elements.

03:17.080 --> 03:22.440
Once you make these promises, this Vishnumaya will receive the message

03:22.520 --> 03:26.400
and She won’t enter into any one of these elements to disturb you.
