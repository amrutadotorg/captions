00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:11.301
In the beginning of course, the meditation takes some time.

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:13.661
But once you will know what is meditation is,

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:18.141
how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me,

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.981
how we can have a rapport with each other.

00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.821
There’s no need to have anything else in between,

00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.392
like writing letters or maybe some sort

00:00:30.473 --> 00:00:32.901
of a special connection, nothing of the kind!

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:37.221
Only thing that is needed is the meditation.

00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:40.661
In meditation you grow.

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:43.901
In that spiritually you become higher.

00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:49.821
And when that happens, you start,

00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:52.461
in a way, I would say

00:00:52.661 --> 00:00:58.141
that when you reach a state of

00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:05.061
that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.061
then you don’t want to give up your meditation.

00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:12.261
Because that time, you are absolutely one with Me.

00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:16.221
That doesn’t mean for three hours, four hours you should do meditation

00:01:16.381 --> 00:01:21.301
but it is how much intensely you are with Me is important;

00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:26.901
now it is not how much time you are with Me.

00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:29.221
Then I’m responsible for you,

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:31.061
for your children, for everyone.

00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:35.981
I am responsible for your ascent, for your protection,

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.741
to save you from all your negativity.

00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:44.021
So it’s not like a father

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:47.141
who will directly punish you,

00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:49.141
it’s not that, but it’s just

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:54.901
“All right, you are not My relation, I am out.”

00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:57.661
That’s the only thing that can happen.

00:01:57.821 --> 00:02:00.061
If you are not meditating, all right,

00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:03.661
I cannot force you, I have nothing to do with you.

00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:07.141
You may have other relationship, outside, outward.

00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:11.661
But this inner relationship, by which you get your benevolence,

00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.981
you cannot have without meditation.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.740
I’ve been telling all of you, please meditate,

00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:20.901
please meditate every day.

00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:24.741
But I think people are also not understanding

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:27.301
the importance of what I am saying,

00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:31.493
because they tell Me, “Mother, we don’t meditate.”

00:02:31.574 --> 00:02:32.741
“Why?”

00:02:32.822 --> 00:02:37.062
“Now we are realized soul, so why should we meditate?”

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:40.061
Now this instrument is fully made,

00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:42.901
but if it is not all the time connected for the mains,

00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:47.581
what’s the use of having it.

00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:51.741
In that meditation, you will feel the Love,

00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:54.741
the divine Love, the beauty of that divine Love,

00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:59.301
a complete panorama changes.

00:02:59.661 --> 00:03:02.901
A meditative person has a very different attitude,

00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:05.061
a very different temperament,

00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:08.581
a very different life and he lives always

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:12.710
in complete satisfaction with himself.

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.629
You should not just get satisfied with one, or can say,

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.029
one last drama, or one this thing, one that

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.429
But you should have a full oneness

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.869
with the Divine, full oneness.

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.429
And that is possible only if you really meditate,

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:40.309
which is quite a easy thing to do, to meditate is.

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:43.589
Some people say, Mother, we cannot get over time,

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.189
we cannot think … we are all the time thinking something,

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.029
or that time we want to see the watch.

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.189
In the beginning we may have a little problem,

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.749
I’m not saying, you may not have, you may have,

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:00.749
but that’s only in the beginning.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.029
But gradually you will be all right.

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:08.589
Gradually you will master it.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:11.829
Gradually you will know it so well

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:15.189
that you would not like to have anything else

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.829
of a cheaper type, you wouldn’t care for such a thing.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:23.669
You see, so to get to your beauty,

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:28.189
to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:30.829
which is now exposed,

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:34.269
only thing you have to do really religiously

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.476
is to meditate.
