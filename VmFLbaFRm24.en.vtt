00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.380
At the very beginning we have to know that the truth is what it is.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.980
You cannot change it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.120
You cannot transform it

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.140
And at this human awareness you cannot know it

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:09.040
That means in our evolutionary process we have reached this state of a human being

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.020
but it is not the end of our evolution

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.920
because we don´t know what is Absolute truth.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.940
Whatever I´m going to tell you today

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.860
you have to take it

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.000
with an open mind like a scientist.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.140
If it is proved

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.620
than you have to accept it as

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.600
honest people.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.680
Because it is for your benevolence,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.140
it is for the benevolence of your country,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.600
it is for the benevolence of the whole world.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:51.280
So please listen to me carefully what I have to tell you.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.920
There is within us

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.840
a power,

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.020
which is placed in the triangular bone,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.580
for our ascend.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.280
It is for our last breakthrough.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.060
And this breakthrough has to happen

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.220
as a process of our evolution.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.080
So the truth is that

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.520
you are not this body,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.160
this mind, this ego, these conditionings.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.020
But you are the Pure Spirit.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.320
And the second truth is that there is

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.100
a very subtle power of Divine Love

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:47.120
that does all the living work.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.620
We see all these beautiful flowers all around us.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:07.640
But we don´t even think whatever a miracle it is.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:20.320
That out of one seed such beautiful flowers come out.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.360
Who runs your heart?

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:34.200
The doctors may say it is the autonomous nervous system.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.160
Who is this auto?

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.040
We go to science and we find that there

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.340
are many questions which cannot be answered.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.780
Science cannot tell us why are we on this Earth.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.680
What is the purpose of life?

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.500
What is our identity?

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.820
So we take to religions.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.480
But religions have created nothing but fundamentalism.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.880
It is a blind faith.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.040
And all kinds of problems have brought up in the name of God.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.860
They are only money-oriented or power-oriented.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.940
They are not spirit-oriented.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.480
But in these modern times there are a lot of false gurus also

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.440
who have come out to make money out of your simplicity.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.840
If it is a living process, how can you pay for it?

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.240
Like this Mother Earth.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.860
How are we to pay Her for these flowers?

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.900
Also some people say we have to suffer.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.940
There is no need to suffer at all.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:23.520
Imagine if God Almighty is the father of all the fathers,

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.520
how can He want you to suffer or Him?

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.360
He is your father,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.960
full of compassion,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.940
full of joy for you.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.140
I have seen there are some false people coming

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.860
and teaching some mantras

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.600
and things like that

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.400
and some boys, I was surprised

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.420
poor things were just going on saying some mantras.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.400
If it is coming from India,

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:35.300
You should not believe that all that comems from India is good. Not at all.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.680
Be very careful.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.560
It is people who are trying to mesmerize your younger generation.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.960
As I have told you that

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.040
you have to be the Spirit.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.740
That means it is an actualization.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.300
It is a happening

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.440
of becoming.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.460
So it is not just a lecture or

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.340
or a sermon or a mental process.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.220
But a happening within you.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.660
That you become something different.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.840
We see so many problems in this world these days

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.560
You have no idea how much problematic it is

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.520
in democratic countries.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.200
But it is happening in America which is supposed to be the greatest democratic country

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.760
It is just full of idiotic and stupid people.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:45.080
It is surprising how they are taking life, for example

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:49.160
they spend all their time in absolute, stupid, nonsencial

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.320
idiotic things.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.640
I sometimes don´t understand how come

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:10.040
human beings can become like that.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.840
Also tremendous level of

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.600
an enterpreneour starts say a fashion.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.280
Say for example narrow pants.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.700
So they are all dressed up like that.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.800
Nobody has freedom to keep to their own dress.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.520
They all wear it and they get varicose veins.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.480
They wear it even then they get varicose veins.

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.820
Then they develop some other nonsense.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.900
Like six-inches of a skirt for ladies.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.620
Even in the cold of England they are wearing that kind of a dress.

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.880
They talk of individuality.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.220
Where is the individuality?

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.520
They do really very stupid things please thank God you have escaped.

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:14.000
They have got the freedom, alright, but no wisdom.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:30.240
And now it´s full of AIDS, full of schizofrenia, madness, lunacy, all kinds of funny diseases.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.480
Drugs of all kinds they are taking.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:54.880
It´s not only the children but even grown-ups in parties.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.020
They talk of drugs.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.380
They have not matured at all.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.900
I don´t say communism was the solution.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.620
But nor is democracy.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.660
Unless and until you have wisdom,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.980
both things can be very dangerous.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:48.320
Now they are selling all their junk which was not sold in their countries to you people here.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:08.240
Due to recession now they are going to Russia and all these places, even to India, to sell all their junk.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.360
But there is a solution

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.420
to all these problems.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.500
This solution lies within yourself.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.580
You don´t have to go Moon,

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.940
You don´t have to go to Jupiter to discover it.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:01.880
Most of the problems that are visible are due to human beings.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.720
Most of the human problems are beacuse of the subtle centers,

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.420
within them are in trouble.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:31.120
When this Kundalini rises,

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.300
She nourishes all these centers,

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.580
interates them and connects you to this

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.700
All-pervading Power.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.800
Because of these centers we suffer,

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.280
physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.120
No doubt, with the ascend of Kundalini

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.360
people have cured of their many incurable diseases.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.440
When the Kundalini comes

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.100
out of your fontanel bone area,

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:49.080
you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:04.800
This Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.600
...described about God Almighty and His son.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.080
but nothing about the Mother.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:35.660
The third one is the Holy Ghost which is a dove.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.520
Symbolically it is alright, it is pure and it ascends.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:58.320
But in all other religions they have described  a Primordial Mother.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:09.520
This has happened because of Paul.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.020
He was a hater of women.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.340
And he never met Christ, all stories are told.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.860
He had killed so many christians and then he wanted to jump on the platform.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.900
And he chose Peter.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:44.500
as the person who will be anointed with the highest position

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.000
in christian religion.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.640
Peter was the worst disciple of Christ.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.160
So Christ also said to Peter

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.840
that a Satan will take you over.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.120
I was myself born in a christian family.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.360
And I asked my father: "Who is this Paul?"

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.660
He was a realized soul my father,

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:39.440
and he said: "He is a squatter."

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.760
He has done a great harm to the West.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.680
by not respecting women.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:01.240
He did not respect the Mother of Christ.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.820
He calls her a woman.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.720
In Quran  Mohammed respects her very much.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.760
And said nobody should take any objection about her morality.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:42.300
This Paul´s turning of Christ´s life has really ruined the message of Christ.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.360
You find all these churches

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.120
have become very money-oriented and power-oriented.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:21.460
So now after giving up communism you might jump onto these, any of them

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.500
it´s very dangerous again.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:41.160
Even the Madonna was never a name given in the Bible to the mother of Christ.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.880
It came from the father religion.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.280
Which was before Christ.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.820
As a result the women in the West are extremely insecure.

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:27.060
I was surprised, how they have to all the time please the men and please the children.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:39.300
And are really going into the complete waste of immorality.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:51.000
India politically and economically is a hopeless case. I agree.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.620
But the society is very well named.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.580
And women don´t have to be insecure in that society.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.240
For them their power is their chastity.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.020
Even in modern times.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:39.620
So to achieve that sense of security also we have to be the Spirit.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.580
First thing that happens to you

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.080
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.600
It´s a new dimension in your awareness.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:19.980
There are thoughts which come to us from the past and the future.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.740
But we cannot be in the present.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:33.860
When the Kundalini rises she separates the thoughts.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.280
So we become thoughtless but fully aware.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.180
We jump into the present.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.560
Which is the reality.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.380
The past is finished and the future doesn´t exist.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.360
In that state you start growing spiritually.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.540
The Spirit is a universal being within you.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.840
It transcends

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.060
all barriers that we have created by our mental activity.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.760
Of ritualism, fundamentalism, all kinds of isms.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:02.780
You realize that all these religions were born on the same tree of spirituality.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.920
These people have cut them and are fighting with the dead flowers.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.020
In the state of thoughtless awareness

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:30.240
you feel your peace within yourself.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.900
This is the peace we are seeking.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
People talk of peace,

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.120
have big arguments and conferences but there is no peace within themselves.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.220
They have been given awards and this, that.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:09.140
But I have seen they are very hot-tempered people.

00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.400
So by your ascend

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.160
you become a peaceful personality,

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.600
relaxed personality, satisfied personality.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:39.240
And you become wise nad discreet.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:51.100
Because you see the reality.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:57.320
And you feel the totality.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.320
When this Kundalini pierces thought the fontanel bone area,

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.500
you start feeling cool breeze on your fingertips.

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.200
This is the All-pervading power.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.200
Which in Quran is called as Ruh.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.620
In sanskrit as Paramachaitanya.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:46.220
Your attention becomes enlightened and innocent.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:52.520
You innocence is never lost.

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.080
It is always there.

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:06.240
Only thing, because of your so called freedom there are some clouds.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:17.240
But when Kundalini rises and connects you to the All-pervading power

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.140
you become innocent, your eyes ecome innocent.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:36.120
You know the Absolute truth on your finger tips,

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.280
even the realized children can tell you

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.760
what´s wrong with your centers.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.900
Not that you can feel your own centers, that´s self-knowledge,

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.940
but also the centers of others.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.580
So you develop a new dimension

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.920
in your awareness of collective consciousness.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:26.800
Ultimately you develop the powers to raise the Kundalini of others.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.500
As one enlightened candle can enlighten many candles.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.020
The life becomes absolutely blissful.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.700
And you jump into the ocean of joy.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.520
Joy has no duality.

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:03.020
of happiness and unhappiness.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:15.280
It is the experience of joy, you feel it.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.260
Sahajayoga is working in 55 nations,

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.120
so many have been cured.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.500
so many have now the powers,

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:47.440
but I have never seen them fighting, quarreling,

00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.560
All full of humour and enjoyment.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:10.780
What a different type of life.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.360
That´s what is for you.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:30.540
You have to achieve it without any difficulties.

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.240
It is very, very simple.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.000
Sahaja means "born with you,"

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:48.560
is the right to be united, that is yoga, with this All-pervading power.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.740
For which you don´t pay.

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:05.060
But it is a collective happening

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.680
it´s a collective organism,

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.860
so you have to be collective.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.080
If one nail is cut out, it doesn´t grow.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:33.960
Now see how Germans and Austrians have come to your town

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.720
and arranged this program.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.640
How so many English going to Russia.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.760
Like there is one finger which has some pain, the whole body

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:05.040
goes to it to get it alright.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.180
So it will take hardly about ten minutes from you

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.920
to get your realization.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.840
But there are three conditions.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.700
Which are very simple.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:45.160
The first one is that

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.360
you should not feel guilty at all.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:58.140
It´s a fashion nowadays to feel guilty.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:06.360
After all, you are human beings and human beings all make mistakes.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:10.240
You are not God.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.100
If you make mistakes, let´s face it, why feel guilty?

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.560
By feeling guilty, this centre here on the left side

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.080
goes out of order.

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.800
And physically also you may suffer from angina,

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.800
or from spondylitis or from lethargic organs all over the body.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:07.540
Don´t believe people who tell you you are sinners.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:13.320
They are the greatest sinners who tell you like that.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.640
After all you are human beings, you are at the epitomy of evolution.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.820
The second condition is

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:38.040
that you have to forgive evryone in general.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.640
Logically whether you forgive or you don´t forgive, you don´t do anything.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:56.620
But if you don´t forgive,

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:00.620
than you play into wrong hands and torture yourself.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:13.080
So you don´t even have to think about them, you have to just

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:19.240
in general, say " I forgive everyone," it´s nonsense.

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.240
Also it is a myth.

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:37.480
Now there is a center within us on the optic chiasm which is like this.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:40.620
Closed.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.800
And if you don´t forgive,

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.500
then it doesn´t open.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.540
But if you forgive, it opens like this.

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:06.020
You feel much lighter and

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.180
Kundalini may pass through.

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:22.740
All your life you tortured yourself by not forgiving.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.600
And at this moment you will miss the great point

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.460
of achieving your realization.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.300
Now the third condition is

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.280
that you have to have full faith in yourself,

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.980
full confidence that you will all get your realization tonight.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:13.560
It sounds fantastic but you are fantastic.

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:20.720
You don´t know yourself. Once you know yourself, you will be amazed,

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:23.680
how many powers you have.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:29.680
What you can do to yourself and to  the whole world.

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:42.200
Unless and until this microphone is connected to the mains, it has no identity, it has no meaning.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:57.640
But as soon as you are connected to the mains,

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.940
you know what you are.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.500
These are the three conditions

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:11.960
I hope you will fulfill.

00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.540
As it is I think you are very sensible people,

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.960
the way you have elected your president,

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.600
the whole  world knows that.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.020
So now those who do not want to have their realization,

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.760
should know that I cannot force it on you.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.620
Because I respect your freedom.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.160
It´s a last judgement,

00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:16.380
you have to judge yourself.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.920
In Quran it is said that at the time of resurrection

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:26.240
your hands will speak.

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.060
They give a witness against you.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.440
And these hands will tell you what´s wrong with you and

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.280
what´s wrong with others.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.980
And if you know how to correct your centers,

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.980
you can correct yourself

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.660
and you can correct others.

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:11.940
Those who do not want to have realization, should leave the hall.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:22.540
Of course, Sahajayoga is not meant for idiots and stupid people.

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:30.500
And it´s not meant for  arrogant people either.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:39.100
Also for people who are involved in some sort of an ideology or

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.620
some sort of blind faith.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:02.800
Again I request those who do not want to have their self-realization,

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.140
they should leave the hall.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:31.720
You have to be pleasently placed to yourself,

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:38.580
now please

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:44.000
you have to remove your shoes,

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.760
because this Mother Earth also

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.300
helps us to suck in our problems.

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:18.000
Now the left and the right are two powers,

00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.980
one is for your desire

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.900
and another for action.

00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:36.120
So you have to put both your feet apart from each other

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.680
and sit comfortably.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.280
You don´t have to go to the Himalayas and stand on your head.

00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.700
You will get your realization in your seats tonight.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:08.120
So now please put your left hand

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:13.340
towards Me on your left hip or left.

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.500
Beacuse this is suggestive or symbolic that you

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:31.220
desire to have your self-realization.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.180
You have to have Pure desire.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:50.040
The right hand we use for nourishing our centers on the lefthand side of ourselves.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.500
This we do it only

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:02.580
for tonight you don´t have to do it later.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:13.140
So now please put your right hand on your heart.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.140
Somebody will show it.

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.660
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.380
If you become the Spirit, in the light of your Spirit,

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:39.220
you become your own master.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:51.020
So you have to take your right hand

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:56.280
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.500
This is the center of your mastery.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:17.060
Which is created by all the great Prophets.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.480
It has to be enlightened.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:36.140
So now you have to take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the lefthand side.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:48.060
This is the center of Pure divine knowledge.

00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.640
We will know about it later on,

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:04.860
how it caters to the Divine knowledge.

00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:28.720
Now please raise your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.440
now on your heart.

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:50.000
Now in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right.

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:04.840
I have already told you what happens to you when this center is out of care.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:17.080
Now take your right hand on your forehead across and put out your head.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:30.120
This is the center for forgiving everyone in general.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:39.480
Now please take back your right hand

00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:42.660
on the backside of your head and push back.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.100
as far as possible.

00:54:53.520 --> 00:55:02.720
This center, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction.

00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:17.540
You have to ask for forgiveness.

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:20.180
From this Divine power.

00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:29.620
Now the last center is important.

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.760
Please stretch your palm fully.

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:45.720
Put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:50.040
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:03.480
Push back your fingers as far as possible.

00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.480
Press it hard,

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:15.940
move your scalp and move it seven times slowly, clockwise.

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.900
That´s all you have to do.

00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:42.100
Now we have to close our eyes,

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:49.660
before that please see that both your feet are apart from each other

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:00.680
Put the left hand toward Me like this.

00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.600
Right hand on the heart.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.880
Do not concentrate, do not pressurize your mind.

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.740
Everything will work out spontaneously.

00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.640
Now close your eyes.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.300
And please don´t open them till I tell you.

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.480
Here you have to ask Me a fundamental question

00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:49.660
about yourself three times.

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.080
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.660
Please ask three times in your heart.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.960
Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.780
I have told you, when you become the Spirit,

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.580
you become your own master.

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:42.020
So take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:42.900
press it hard

00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:51.140
and here ask another fundamental question about yourself to Me.

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:03.520
Ask a question: "Mother, am I my own master?"

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.020
Three times.

00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:21.180
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:25.080
I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.000
Take out your hand

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:50.380
on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:03.320
Here you have to ask for Pure knowledge.

01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:13.520
Here ask 6 times because this center has got 6 petals.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:18.160
Mother please give me Pure knowledge.

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:46.400
As soon as you ask for Pure knowledge,

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:51.100
the Kundalini starts rising and we have to nourish the upper centers

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.520
with our full confidence.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:10.780
So now raise your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:14.240
on the left hand side and press it hard

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.840
here you ahve to say with full confidence 10 times,

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.060
Mother, I am my own master.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.200
I alreday told you that you are not this body, this mind, this ego

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.220
these conditionings but

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.340
you are the Pure Spirit.

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.660
So now raise your right hand on your heart and say

01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.500
with full confidence 12 times

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.820
Mother, I am the Pure Spirit.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.820
This All-pervading power is the

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.700
ocean of knowledge.

01:02:54.580 --> 01:03:00.160
It is the ocean of joy and blessings.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:10.960
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.560
Whatever misteakes you might have committed,

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:26.480
it can be easily dissolved by this power of forgiveness.

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:42.060
So now forgive yourself and raise your hand to the border of your neck and turn your head to the right.

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:59.280
Here you have to say with full confidence 16 times

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.560
Mother I am not guilty at all.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.060
I have already told you that logically

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.440
whether you forgive or you don´t forgive

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.160
you don´t do anything.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.620
But you torture yourself.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:48.920
At this junction if you don´t forgive, the center won´t open and Kundalini won´t pass.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:11.180
So please forgive all of them in general, not thinking about them.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:24.880
Now raise your right hand on the forehead across and put your head down

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.040
and here you have to say from your heart, not how many times

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:34.520
Mother, I forgive everyone in general.

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:55.180
Now without feeling guilty

01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:56.940
without counting your mistakes

01:05:57.740 --> 01:05:59.660
just for your satisfaction,

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:05.480
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:27.540
Take your hand on the backside of your head

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.400
and push back your head

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.980
and here with full confidence from your heart, not how many times -

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.380
you have to say - Divine Power if I have done wrong,

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:44.000
knowingly or unknowingly, please forogive me.

01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.960
The last center is important.

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.860
Where you have to stretch your palm fully

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240
and put the center of your palm

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.180
on top of the fontanel bone area

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.920
which is a soft bone in your childhood

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:40.680
Put down your head and push back your fingers so there is sufficient pressure on your scalp.

01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:57.460
Here again I cannot force self-realization on you

01:07:57.460 --> 01:07:58.900
you have to ask for it.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:04.400
So move your hand seven times clockwise

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:10.060
say from your heart - Mother please give me my self-realization.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.160
Please bend your head.

01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.840
Push back your fingers.

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.740
Take down your hands please and open your eyes.

01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.700
Now please put both your hands towards Me.

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.740
And don´t think.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.600
Now put the right hand towards Me like this.

01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.460
Put out your head and see for yourself

01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:19.180
if there si cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:43.280
You shouldn´t put your hand on top of your head, but away from it.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.820
Put your left hand towards Me...

01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.080
not on top, a bit away or you cannot feel it at all.

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:08.620
Please put your left hand towards Me.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:10.800
Bend your head and see for yourself

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:15.640
if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:37.200
If you have not forgiven yourself or others, it will be hot.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:44.520
Now forgive.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:51.860
Lastly again, put right hand towards me, put down your head and see for yourself

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:57.000
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:19.300
Please bend your heads.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.640
Now please raise your both your hands towards the sky like this.

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:40.340
Push back your head upward.

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:50.560
Ask any out of these three questions three times.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.260
Please ask

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:08.660
Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:20.240
Mother is this the All-pervading power of God´s Love?

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:34.520
Mother, is this the Paramachaytanya? Or Ruh?

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:39.360
Any of these questions you can ask three times.

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.180
Now please take down your hands.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.120
Put your hands like this towards Me.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.760
And don´t think.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:13.780
Those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their fingertips,

01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.500
or on their heads, palms,

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.480
or out of the fontanel bone area,

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:23.860
please raise your hands.

01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:48.220
All of you. All of you.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.680
May God bless you.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.320
Except for one or two people.
