WEBVTT

00:00.039 --> 00:07.961
They have asked me to talk about Indian
culture today

00:08.162 --> 00:15.155
because Bombay is the place where Indian
culture is disappearing,

00:15.356 --> 00:18.035
that’s what they say.

00:18.236 --> 00:25.383
But I don’t think so, because the roots
are so deep

00:25.584 --> 00:32.892
that we cannot give up that culture
so fast.

00:33.467 --> 00:43.713
Now as it is for the people who are coming
from other countries,

00:43.914 --> 00:52.036
they have to realize that this country had
no religion as such,

00:52.237 --> 00:59.559
because there was not one book, they
didn’t follow one person.

01:01.738 --> 01:09.591
They didn’t have any organizations as we
have for other religions,

01:09.792 --> 01:14.633
we never had a hierarchy, priesthood,
all that appointed.

01:14.834 --> 01:18.072
It was all done very spontaneously.

01:18.273 --> 01:25.141
The whole thing worked out very
spontaneously.

01:25.342 --> 01:28.941
But behind all that was, as I told you
before,

01:29.142 --> 01:35.415
the attitude of Indians or our style was,

01:35.616 --> 01:42.847
not to challenge or to question what these
great saints have talked about.

01:43.048 --> 01:47.159
Because we accepted their status as saints,

01:47.360 --> 01:54.930
as higher personalities in awareness,
in ascent they were higher than us.

01:55.131 --> 01:57.916
So we didn’t want to challenge them,

01:58.117 --> 02:01.380
and whatever they said we accepted.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.581
As a result that became sort of, you can
call it,

02:04.782 --> 02:10.845
a way of conduct or way of life.

02:11.046 --> 02:14.402
But as a religion we had nothing,

02:14.603 --> 02:23.507
except that later on the caste system
developed.

02:23.708 --> 02:31.410
Before that there was no caste system
because non-Brahmins wrote

02:31.611 --> 02:38.367
about Shri Rama or wrote about
Shri Krishna.

02:39.033 --> 02:44.185
It’s very surprising how we accepted
all that,

02:44.386 --> 02:49.755
never challenged whether it was written
by a Brahmin or not.

02:49.956 --> 02:54.262
Brahmin was that who knew about Brahma
principle,

02:54.470 --> 02:58.384
the principle of all-pervading Divine Love.

02:58.585 --> 03:01.284
Everybody was not a Brahmin.

03:01.485 --> 03:06.934
But later on they made it like this,
whosoever is born

03:07.143 --> 03:10.510
in a Brahmin family was a Brahmin,

03:10.711 --> 03:16.404
whosoever was born in another caste
belonged to that.

03:16.621 --> 03:23.762
But because of the father’s heritance,
you can say inherited,

03:23.963 --> 03:30.435
they also the profession that they wer
following.

03:30.636 --> 03:35.297
So according to the professions,
the religions, or we can say the castes

03:35.498 --> 03:38.788
were established; no religion, but caste.

03:38.996 --> 03:43.203
And that is how we had different, different
caste systems in India

03:43.411 --> 03:48.673
according to the professions. It is very
interesting.

03:48.874 --> 03:55.715
Recently, I discovered there is a caste
called Ghadani,

03:55.916 --> 03:59.163
among Marathas, which you may not be
knowing.

03:59.364 --> 04:05.256
They only believe in the art.

04:05.457 --> 04:12.064
They do music, or they have paintings,
they make statues,

04:12.265 --> 04:18.866
they make temples; that’s a caste,
that’s a profession.

04:19.067 --> 04:23.005
And they marry among themselves because
it is easier

04:23.206 --> 04:30.784
to marry in the same profession and to have
the same ideas

04:30.985 --> 04:37.682
and styles about life and the profession
especially.

04:37.883 --> 04:41.805
Now later on, apart from being
a profession,

04:42.006 --> 04:46.428
it started becoming a very consolidated
nonsense.

04:46.629 --> 04:53.189
And then they used, I mean I think, it is
the British who used it very much

04:53.390 --> 04:57.120
to separate us from one to another.

04:57.321 --> 05:04.398
Now the schedule caste and all that was
not also like a rigid thing.

05:04.607 --> 05:08.385
We have got saints like Chokha Mela and
all that,

05:08.586 --> 05:14.226
who were also greatly respected and
regarded.

05:14.427 --> 05:21.675
Also Ekanath, Namdev, they all tried to be
one

05:21.876 --> 05:27.330
with all the castes, and especially
the schedule caste.

05:27.531 --> 05:34.844
So this saintliness was regarded as
a another caste you can say,

05:35.045 --> 05:39.588
which did not believe in any caste
whatsoever.

05:39.789 --> 05:43.163
They had no caste, they were a caste-less
people

05:43.364 --> 05:48.604
without any religion, without any caste.

05:48.805 --> 05:54.388
So the ultimate aim of every caste was
to get to Self Realization.

05:54.589 --> 06:01.370
So they enter into the clan, you can call
it, into the system of saints.

06:01.586 --> 06:09.014
And all the saints, whether Muslims, or
Hindus or Jains or anything,

06:09.230 --> 06:16.615
they all were put together as saints,
as you can say they were Sufis.

06:16.816 --> 06:23.086
Sufis from the Muslim heritage they came.

06:23.287 --> 06:28.667
Then we had also among Jains, Tirthankaras
and all that.

06:28.868 --> 06:37.960
The main point was that they were the people
who believed in the ethical life, ethics;

06:38.161 --> 06:49.310
believed in the higher life, spiritual life
and lived like that.

06:49.511 --> 06:53.309
Now as you are all Sahaja Yogis, you have
lost your religion,

06:53.510 --> 06:58.310
lost your caste, you have lost everything.
You are Sahaja Yogis.

06:58.511 --> 07:09.265
Yogis, means you are the people who are
believing into the ethical side of life.

07:09.473 --> 07:18.611
In this country all this was used and was
exploited also,

07:18.812 --> 07:28.194
for politics, for all kinds of segregation
of people.

07:28.395 --> 07:37.004
And that has really gone into such rigid
ideas about every one, every caste,

07:37.213 --> 07:45.759
that first thing they used to ask, not now,
before, ‘What is your caste?’

07:46.038 --> 07:49.636
Now that’s over, they don’t ask, at least
thank God,

07:49.837 --> 07:54.542
that much sense is there, that they don’t
ask for the caste,

07:54.750 --> 07:58.656
but they used to ask religion and caste
formerly

07:58.857 --> 08:05.171
when we were entering into any examination
or any kind of competition.

08:05.372 --> 08:12.299
Now gradually it’s vanishing, but the
politicians wants to use caste

08:12.539 --> 08:23.159
as a method of working out the opposition
and the majority part of it.

08:23.367 --> 08:27.976
This democracy I don’t think is very
helpful to us

08:28.177 --> 08:34.221
because in democracy anybody can start
an organization,

08:34.422 --> 08:38.689
can say that, “We belong to this caste
and that caste.”

08:38.890 --> 08:43.948
And when the constitution was made also
in this country, it’s very surprising,

08:44.164 --> 08:47.863
Ambedkar was one of them who wanted

08:48.064 --> 08:53.766
that there should be a privilege for
the schedule caste for forty years.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.864
My father was there. He said, ‘No,

08:57.065 --> 09:03.090
you can have only two types, ones who
have and those who don’t have.’

09:03.291 --> 09:08.232
And that kind of thing if you have: those
who have and don’t have,

09:08.433 --> 09:11.599
it would make such a difference.

09:11.800 --> 09:16.747
Then in other countries they have
the same type,

09:16.948 --> 09:24.523
so that the needs of the people who
haven’t got the minimum necessities

09:24.724 --> 09:29.527
for a good life will be helped instead
of creating a caste.

09:29.728 --> 09:37.618
Now there’s one fellow called Mandal who
created a great problem in our country.

09:37.842 --> 09:44.138
He as a student had a car of his own, used
to live very lavishly,

09:44.339 --> 09:51.058
and he was fighting for some people who
were supposed to be downtrodden.

09:51.259 --> 09:56.588
And so many bad things have been done
because of his report that he gave.

09:56.789 --> 10:05.558
Now if he had made that kind of a proper,
sensible, ethical division in this country,

10:05.759 --> 10:09.037
things would have been much better.

10:09.238 --> 10:16.339
But now because of this problem of creating
artificial caste,

10:16.540 --> 10:19.636
this country is suffering a lot.

10:19.837 --> 10:26.955
And the caste of the gurus, the caste,
we can say, of the Sufis,

10:27.156 --> 10:32.451
or the caste of the saints is very much
polluted,

10:32.652 --> 10:41.201
and we had many people in our country who
started becoming gurus and this and that.

10:41.402 --> 10:47.971
But the main thing is the ethics, which was
the culture of this country,

10:48.172 --> 10:51.867
was the ethics - Aadhyatama.

10:52.068 --> 10:59.098
Without that they thought human beings
were worse than animals.

10:59.299 --> 11:06.837
Ethics was very important to every caste,
to every person.

11:07.043 --> 11:11.857
Even when I was young we had the same
thing.

11:12.058 --> 11:19.611
But now it has become such a mixture
and such a problem,

11:19.812 --> 11:24.856
that unless and until Sahaja Yoga really
spreads in a real way,

11:25.064 --> 11:32.150
I don’t think we can improve the condition
of this country.

11:32.365 --> 11:39.550
Now the essence of it is that once your
attention is only

11:39.798 --> 11:43.623
towards ethics and Aadhyatama (MEANS
spirituality -ed),

11:43.824 --> 11:53.104
then you start discovering all the inner
deeper meanings of your life.

11:53.305 --> 11:56.826
You work it out in a different way.

11:57.027 --> 12:00.364
In a very different way you work it out.

12:00.565 --> 12:08.432
If it is material gain, then one can become
like America.

12:08.688 --> 12:18.126
If it is some sort of a very low level
hankerings,

12:18.327 --> 12:22.932
then also you cannot be an Indian.

12:23.133 --> 12:35.468
The principles of Indian life were embedded
in spirituality, in morality.

12:35.669 --> 12:42.608
An immoral person was regarded as a very
low level person.

12:42.809 --> 12:47.734
Such a person could not get married, he had
no place in the society,

12:47.935 --> 12:54.202
he had no place even in the homes, their
own homes.

12:54.821 --> 13:06.093
That such a restriction on people, just
to see that the society is kept clean,

13:06.294 --> 13:10.882
and such a person was thrown out
of the society.

13:11.342 --> 13:16.826
Anybody who even drank wine or anything,

13:17.027 --> 13:22.785
was regarded as a person who is not
dharmic, he is adharmic.

13:22.986 --> 13:24.908
Can you believe it?

13:25.116 --> 13:29.691
Drinking was regarded as adharmic.
I think very few people

13:29.892 --> 13:35.251
must have seen drunkards, only
on the streets.

13:35.452 --> 13:41.919
When I went to Russia they asked Me,
“What do you say to ‘cheers’?”

13:42.120 --> 13:45.960
The Russians say ‘cheerio’, they don’t
say ‘cheers’.

13:46.176 --> 13:48.738
I said, “What? Cheers for what?”

13:48.939 --> 13:54.386
“For drinking. When you are on the table,
what do you say?”

13:54.587 --> 13:59.520
I said, “We never drink on the dinner
table,

13:59.721 --> 14:04.260
that’s not done in India. At least, I don’t
know if somebody does it.

14:04.461 --> 14:09.345
But it is a very, very western style
of life

14:09.546 --> 14:13.647
that openly you sit down at the dinner
table before your children

14:13.848 --> 14:20.386
and start drinking, and say ‘cheers’.
Immagine.

14:20.587 --> 14:26.738
Cheers for what? For becoming unconscious?

14:26.939 --> 14:33.009
For becoming stupid? For getting into
troubles?

14:33.210 --> 14:38.864
But it became like a practice there.

14:39.065 --> 14:46.021
Whether somebody dies in the family, they
will drink. Can you imagine?

14:46.395 --> 14:51.558
If somebody is born in the family they
will drink.

14:51.759 --> 14:55.856
So this culture, the whole culture was
so bad,

14:56.078 --> 15:02.899
even among the worst in this country
they wouldn’t do that.

15:04.288 --> 15:09.825
Secretly some people used to drink, and
they would go on the street.

15:10.026 --> 15:12.530
Then the Islamic influence came.

15:12.731 --> 15:18.483
And surprisingly when it is prohibited,
absolutely prohibited,

15:18.684 --> 15:23.500
in the Islam, to drink, they all started
drinking

15:23.701 --> 15:28.280
as a reaction, but only those Nawabs
and all that.

15:28.481 --> 15:32.404
And because of them, because they were
in authority,

15:32.605 --> 15:34.728
others also took to drinking.

15:34.929 --> 15:41.421
But still, it is not yet a custom to drink,
to celebrate something.

15:41.622 --> 15:47.800
I mean supposing, even in the church
they give drinks

15:48.001 --> 15:53.267
and they make also some sort
of a Benedictine,

15:53.468 --> 15:58.668
in the church organization. Imagine!

15:58.869 --> 16:04.845
This is such a perversion of religion.

16:05.505 --> 16:07.837
In India also, in the temples and all that

16:08.038 --> 16:11.990
they started all kinds of nonsensical
things, no doubt.

16:12.191 --> 16:17.871
But Indian philosophy is such that it gives
you complete freedom

16:18.072 --> 16:22.837
and you can do what you like. But not
in the name of religion,

16:23.038 --> 16:29.365
you can’t do it, not in the name of God,
not in the temple.

16:29.566 --> 16:34.097
And if they do it, people will throw them
away,

16:34.298 --> 16:41.007
they bring a court case, do this do that
and, I mean, just remove it completely.

16:41.208 --> 16:45.374
So it is kept pure.

16:45.574 --> 16:51.638
We had a horrible incidence of horrible
things people were doing, adharmic,

16:51.839 --> 16:56.914
but all that had to be cancelled
completely. Why?

16:57.122 --> 17:03.300
Because the people wouldn’t have it, people
wouldn’t like it.

17:03.501 --> 17:08.489
I was told that at Ganapatipule they are
secretly offering

17:08.690 --> 17:11.577
some sort of a beer to people.

17:11.778 --> 17:16.088
But if the government comes to know
about it, it will be banned.

17:16.289 --> 17:20.501
I mean, whatever is pure must be kept pure.

17:20.702 --> 17:23.018
Christ, also, He took one hunter in his
hand

17:23.242 --> 17:28.539
and started hitting people who were selling
things in the temple.

17:29.087 --> 17:37.957
So the purity of that church or the purity
of that religious place have to be kept.

17:38.158 --> 17:42.733
So the first thing I think was purity.

17:44.337 --> 17:52.446
Here now I have seen, the other day,
there was a boy, was for marriage.

17:53.076 --> 17:58.903
And it’s very surprising, they were all
very well off,

17:59.104 --> 18:02.716
very rich, everything was there.

18:02.917 --> 18:08.316
But they found out that he had
a girlfriend before.

18:08.517 --> 18:13.107
And the brother of the girlfriend tried
to stab him. Finished.

18:13.308 --> 18:17.794
Now for him to get married is an
impossibility in this country.

18:17.995 --> 18:21.768
He might get somebody from abroad, I don’t
know what they will do.

18:21.969 --> 18:29.107
But if he had a girlfriend like that,
openly, he is finished.

18:29.308 --> 18:32.914
So the restrictions came from the society,

18:33.115 --> 18:37.619
a society which was built up on ethics.

18:37.820 --> 18:43.502
And all these ethical values arepenetrating

18:43.718 --> 18:48.586
up to the lowest level, up to everywhere.

18:50.438 --> 18:54.085
But unfortunately, unfortunately

18:54.301 --> 18:58.179
now the other cultures are coming and
people think

18:58.379 --> 19:04.506
it's, it's - we are rather rigid, very
rigid people.

19:04.715 --> 19:09.748
We should really relax a little bit and
take to other things.

19:19.447 --> 19:22.835
But I have to tell you

19:24.106 --> 19:35.267
that if you go out of the line of ethics,
in any direction,

19:35.468 --> 19:40.451
the only saving is Sahaja Yoga to come back
to normalcy,

19:40.652 --> 19:42.659
there is no other way out.

19:42.860 --> 19:48.827
And once you come to Sahaja Yoga you cannot
deviate from the path of dharma.

19:49.028 --> 19:53.334
If you try to do that you go out of Sahaja
Yoga.

19:53.535 --> 19:57.274
It is as simple as that.

19:57.475 --> 20:00.948
It is not that, ‘All right, doesn’t matter.

20:01.149 --> 20:06.586
Mother should forgive.’ and these things.
I forgive, all right, I forgive,

20:06.787 --> 20:11.815
because you have got some still human
weaknesses left in you, I forgive.

20:12.024 --> 20:15.445
But in Sahaja Yoga you cannot come.

20:15.646 --> 20:20.101
Sahaja Yoga has to maintain its purity.

20:20.302 --> 20:25.552
If you allow all such people to enter
into Sahaja Yoga,

20:25.753 --> 20:31.177
then there will be no purity of Sahaja Yoga

20:31.378 --> 20:34.728
and then everybody will start doing this
or that

20:34.929 --> 20:40.020
just to say that, ‘After all, you see, we
are also Sahaja Yogis,

20:40.221 --> 20:46.613
they are also Sahaja Yogis, if they have
done it, why not we?’

20:46.814 --> 20:50.857
What is very surprising to Me is
the western people

20:51.058 --> 20:56.893
who have taken to Sahaja Yoga are
scrupulously following Sahaja Yoga.

20:57.094 --> 21:03.580
Scrupulously. I am not such a strict Guru,
as you know.

21:03.781 --> 21:09.912
But they understand one thing, that “this
is for our betterment,

21:10.113 --> 21:14.017
this is for our growth,

21:14.218 --> 21:25.268
this is a very, very important part of our
lives, that is ethics.

21:25.469 --> 21:28.161
That has to be there.”

21:28.362 --> 21:32.850
And once they understand it, I tell you,
I am surprised

21:33.051 --> 21:39.770
how these western people who have seen
their parents drinking,

21:39.971 --> 21:44.045
and also other people doing all kinds
of things,

21:44.246 --> 21:49.835
even their friends and all that, just
give up, completely.

21:50.036 --> 21:52.505
I am very proud of them.

21:52.706 --> 21:58.569
For us Indians, it is natural, because we
are brought up that way.

21:58.769 --> 22:03.921
All the time we have seen people being
corrected and,

22:04.122 --> 22:07.831
I mean of course drinking and all that
was of course not out of question.

22:08.032 --> 22:11.170
But even if somebody looks at a girl,
you know,

22:11.371 --> 22:16.821
the father would say, ‘I will pierce
through your eyes!’

22:17.022 --> 22:21.563
I mean. And that’s why the eyes remain
steady,

22:21.764 --> 22:28.101
and I don’t know how but we don’t do
all that. Normally.

22:28.302 --> 22:32.723
I mean if somebody has been abroad
and all that

22:32.924 --> 22:36.856
and thinks that they are very free people
and why not we can do,

22:37.057 --> 22:42.738
that’s a very different thing. But normally
we don’t, we don’t believe in that.

22:42.939 --> 22:48.809
Of course in India we do have some elite
societies, so called;

22:49.326 --> 22:53.227
they are the people who believe in all
kinds of elite behavior.

22:53.428 --> 22:56.367
I don’t know what is that supposed to be.

22:56.568 --> 23:03.483
Maybe some of them have started some
nonsense, especially in Bombay.

23:03.684 --> 23:07.867
Now it is spreading out also to Poona.

23:08.068 --> 23:12.406
And in Poona there are girls who are
behaving funnily.

23:12.607 --> 23:16.403
I mean I can’t believe it. They drink,
they smoke,

23:16.604 --> 23:20.787
they have become call-girls. Can you
imagine?

23:23.387 --> 23:27.078
All this has happened

23:27.279 --> 23:33.182
because I don’t know what is their idea
about life.

23:33.382 --> 23:37.910
Or maybe it’s an actress or something they
follow,

23:38.111 --> 23:42.098
but what is the life of that actress?

23:43.107 --> 23:48.756
Unethical behavior, when you compromise
with your value system,

23:48.965 --> 23:52.943
ultimately, where do you end?

23:56.094 --> 24:01.256
It’s showing results. We have AIDS, we have
so many diseases

24:01.457 --> 24:09.676
coming from this kind of irrelevant,
unethical life.

24:12.534 --> 24:19.357
It is happening everywhere to suggest that
we should take to very normal life,

24:19.558 --> 24:29.392
to very good family life of obedience and
understanding.

24:29.948 --> 24:39.328
But because you are very free in the West
it is difficult for you to accept,

24:39.529 --> 24:46.512
but once they come to Sahaja Yoga I am
really surprised, I am really surprised,

24:46.713 --> 24:53.596
how they have accepted Sahaja Yoga
so beautifully.

24:53.797 --> 24:58.410
They had the freedom, complete freedom
to do what they liked.

24:58.619 --> 25:01.418
In India we don’t have such freedom
for children.

25:01.626 --> 25:04.875
They can go wherever they like, they
can do whatever they like,

25:05.076 --> 25:08.302
the teacher cannot correct them.

25:08.779 --> 25:12.296
Because of that freedom that they had,

25:12.497 --> 25:17.086
there’s one thing good that has happened.
So many are lost, all right,

25:17.287 --> 25:21.972
but those who are saved are rare people.

25:22.173 --> 25:27.112
Because of that growth of freedom within
them I think

25:27.313 --> 25:34.294
they learn our Indian music in five months,
four months. No Indians can do it

25:34.595 --> 25:37.917
because they are restricted all the time,
they are controlled all the time,

25:38.118 --> 25:43.072
they are kept on the path of religion.

25:43.273 --> 25:50.286
So ultimately the freedom that some of you
had and enjoyed

25:50.495 --> 25:54.696
has given you a special personality

25:54.897 --> 25:59.869
that you pick up very difficult things
without any difficulty.

26:00.307 --> 26:06.070
Now whether you should have that freedom
or not is your own lookout.

26:06.271 --> 26:12.957
But too much restrictions on children,
I think, is not a good thing.

26:14.021 --> 26:19.423
Now in music, I know, Ravi Shankar when
he was young,

26:19.624 --> 26:24.000
his guru had broken a tanpura on his head

26:24.201 --> 26:31.673
because he put a wrong note, swara. Can you
imagine?

26:31.874 --> 26:36.751
They used to beat them, tie them upside
down,

26:36.952 --> 26:42.344
put them in the well, I mean all kinds
of things they did

26:42.545 --> 26:48.139
and the disciples listened to all that
discipline. Can you imagine?

26:48.340 --> 26:57.612
But I think that curbed their capacity
to absorb something difficult.

26:57.813 --> 27:03.248
This is one of the reasons why I see this
has happened,

27:03.449 --> 27:07.689
that people have picked up this difficult
music

27:07.890 --> 27:12.457
in four months, three months, it’s
a miracle we think.

27:12.658 --> 27:16.383
Why not this happens with Indians?

27:17.691 --> 27:24.069
You put them to anything, they pick it up
so fast.

27:24.270 --> 27:28.188
With Sahaja Yoga, born with Sahaja Yoga,
those who are,

27:28.389 --> 27:31.055
should be given full freedom I think.

27:31.256 --> 27:35.058
Such children should be given full freedom

27:35.259 --> 27:37.470
for they will not do anything wrong.

27:37.671 --> 27:43.679
And you will see they will pick up things
very fast.

27:44.585 --> 27:49.153
Not that westerners are more intelligent
or alert,

27:49.354 --> 27:58.927
but the way they are given freedom, their
growth, their personality.

27:59.143 --> 28:02.223
Sometimes they are like a vagabond,
I think.

28:02.432 --> 28:09.715
Sometimes just like a tomboy, sometimes
to me they look like very vulgar.

28:09.916 --> 28:22.364
But once with that wealth of freedom they
come to reality, they shine.

28:22.565 --> 28:28.650
So I would request also Indians, not
to suppress the children too much.

28:28.851 --> 28:33.170
We enjoy the children very much in India,
no doubt,

28:33.371 --> 28:37.388
but we suppress also them, very much.

28:37.596 --> 28:40.457
‘Why are you standing? Why don’t you sit
down? Why...’

28:40.658 --> 28:42.810
And children don’t mind because it is
accepted,

28:43.024 --> 28:46.258
this pattern is accepted in India.

28:46.490 --> 28:52.891
So too much restriction on children also
curbs their personality,

28:53.092 --> 28:56.690
this is what I have discovered.

28:57.134 --> 29:01.636
But the western people go through such hell
first of all,

29:01.853 --> 29:05.880
develop such problems to begin with

29:06.081 --> 29:10.313
and ultimately what happens is this,

29:11.735 --> 29:17.035
that they can be discarded as bad, bad,
bad people.

29:17.244 --> 29:22.957
But if they come as good, good, good, they
are marvelous.

29:23.602 --> 29:28.946
All the freedom they have enjoyed before
is showing results,

29:29.147 --> 29:34.350
otherwise how can this miracle happen
to western people.

29:34.955 --> 29:41.126
There is no justification. Now the problem
is to give freedom or not.

29:45.166 --> 29:55.563
We have a proper sense now, after
Realization,

29:58.159 --> 30:03.310
that a child is a born realized.

30:03.511 --> 30:08.042
In the beginning he won’t understand,
he won’t understand.

30:08.243 --> 30:13.353
But gradually such a child will show
results,

30:13.553 --> 30:19.837
maximum capacity to absorb and to express.

30:21.298 --> 30:26.439
So today I am telling you about this
freedom,

30:26.640 --> 30:30.538
which is the freedom of the Spirit.

30:30.739 --> 30:36.170
We should have understanding of such
children

30:36.371 --> 30:43.251
who have that spirituality in them.

30:44.023 --> 30:46.176
They have dharma in them.

30:46.385 --> 30:53.331
And we should not try to constrict them
or to trouble them.

30:53.532 --> 30:57.113
Let them do what they like.

30:57.314 --> 31:01.567
They’ll never do anything wrong because
they are born realized.

31:01.768 --> 31:06.528
So I am talking about the future Indians.

31:06.729 --> 31:09.984
Some of them I have seen, eight year old
children,

31:10.185 --> 31:15.458
six year old children, they are geniuses,
I tell you.

31:15.659 --> 31:22.598
They sing as if we feel that these old
musicians are reborn or what.

31:23.054 --> 31:30.999
It is very surprising how they show their
talent.

31:31.208 --> 31:36.225
There was a programme I saw on the
television of children below eight years

31:36.426 --> 31:42.650
and a three year old girl singing just like
Hirabai Barodekar.

31:42.851 --> 31:46.055
I was amazed. They are born realized

31:46.256 --> 31:52.551
but also they have the talents from their
past lives.

31:52.802 --> 31:56.686
They have got it from the past life.

31:57.481 --> 32:04.087
So we should not try to control and check
our children too much,

32:04.288 --> 32:09.501
that’s a part of our Sahaj culture.

32:09.701 --> 32:12.663
It doesn’t fit into Indian culture, I must
say,

32:12.879 --> 32:16.126
but it should fit into Sahaj culture,

32:16.327 --> 32:24.549
to understand the value of our children
who are realized souls.

32:24.750 --> 32:29.775
I enjoy their company, they speak so
sweetly of all the things,

32:29.976 --> 32:36.218
of all the persons, and they describe about
everyone so sweetly.

32:36.419 --> 32:39.104
Just allow them the freedom to talk

32:39.305 --> 32:43.359
and they’ll tell you all kinds of things.

32:45.402 --> 32:51.865
Now I have praised you a lot I think.

32:52.066 --> 32:59.085
The outsiders we can call them, not
Indians, non-Indians.

32:59.285 --> 33:06.779
And it is a fact, the way they have taken
to Sahaja Yoga is remarkable.

33:06.980 --> 33:12.799
But the way they are taking to this Indian
music and to Indian art

33:13.000 --> 33:21.627
I can’t believe it, really I can’t believe
it. I can’t understand it.

33:23.303 --> 33:27.136
So you have freedom,

33:27.346 --> 33:32.968
but now use this freedom for expression

33:33.183 --> 33:37.456
of whatever you have achieved in Sahaja
Yoga.

33:39.069 --> 33:42.757
Because you are already grown up with
your freedom

33:42.958 --> 33:49.326
and if you do not utilize that personality
full of freedom

33:49.527 --> 33:56.771
in expressing Sahaja Yoga in your own
languages,

33:56.978 --> 33:59.822
you won’t help your people.

34:00.023 --> 34:05.208
You have to help them because your
percentage is very low,

34:05.409 --> 34:07.997
your quality is high.

34:08.198 --> 34:11.644
But in your own country your percentage
is low.

34:11.845 --> 34:18.206
So you have to go all out to get them
into Sahaja Yoga

34:18.407 --> 34:26.310
So you have to go all out to get them
into Sahaja Yoga

34:26.739 --> 34:30.432
You are duty bound, I think.
