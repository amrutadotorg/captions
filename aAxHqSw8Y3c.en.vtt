00:38.959 --> 00:41.709
I’m sorry for being late.

00:41.750 --> 00:49.000
I did not know that this programme is in a beautiful place like this.

00:56.750 --> 01:04.500
And here you see a beautiful painting of Michelangelo

01:06.291 --> 01:16.417
expressing the desire of the Divine, your Father, to save you,

01:17.917 --> 01:23.625
to help you out, and is working out.

01:29.000 --> 01:49.542
In Germany we have had very great aggressive happenings

01:51.291 --> 02:06.750
and that brought forth a devastating effect on the Western life, all over.

02:07.208 --> 02:11.000
The value systems were broken,

02:11.417 --> 02:17.000
the idea of dharma was disturbed,

02:18.417 --> 02:22.417
women started behaving like men

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
and so many people died.

02:29.333 --> 02:32.417
Very young people died, very very young.

02:32.625 --> 02:36.417
All their desires were not fulfilled,

02:36.625 --> 02:52.625
all their life gave them nothing but war.

02:57.083 --> 03:00.709
That was a kind of a heatwave that came,

03:02.417 --> 03:06.500
destroying all the subtler things.

03:07.834 --> 03:14.542
When the nature gets its respite, or is angry,

03:15.125 --> 03:21.000
it destroys only gross things

03:22.125 --> 03:25.834
but when human beings start destroying

03:26.000 --> 03:34.291
they destroy even the subtler things like their value system,

03:34.625 --> 03:41.917
your character, your chastity, your innocence, your forbearance.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.834
So now the war is on on the subtler level.

03:52.291 --> 03:55.375
We have to now understand

03:55.625 --> 04:02.625
that all these things have brought such a shattering effect in the West,

04:04.000 --> 04:07.750
on the Western personality.

04:08.709 --> 04:18.750
So the first effort one has to do is to repair it,

04:21.000 --> 04:28.458
to put it straight, make it stand on its own legs.

04:30.709 --> 04:37.125
Because people lost their personality, their tradition,

04:39.625 --> 04:42.542
they had no moorings, no roots

04:44.125 --> 04:49.417
and they started moving towards anything

04:49.500 --> 04:58.999
that was brought in as some sort of a intellectual experience.

05:04.208 --> 05:07.500
The women became very independent

05:07.542 --> 05:12.917
and they thought they can work out their own problems.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.709
That they thought they can become like men.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
Here the problem started even in a worse way.

05:30.333 --> 05:32.208
Because woman is a woman

05:32.625 --> 05:37.083
and a very little thing which is, call it, a man in her

05:38.000 --> 05:44.417
and when she tries to avoid what she has

05:44.999 --> 05:49.000
and develop something that she has very little

05:50.417 --> 05:54.500
then she becomes funny.

05:55.917 --> 06:00.000
But she may be possessed by so many men who are dead,

06:02.208 --> 06:10.125
her desire to become manly can attract so many bhoots

06:10.625 --> 06:14.000
who want to enter into a woman’s mind.

06:16.125 --> 06:22.625
And when they enter they have the garb of a woman

06:24.959 --> 06:27.125
and mind of a devil.

06:30.542 --> 06:32.999
And the women can not see it

06:33.750 --> 06:36.709
because maybe with those devilish things

06:36.999 --> 06:40.083
in the wordly way they might be successful.

06:41.417 --> 06:46.500
They might be better off. Maybe they can dominate everyone,

06:48.709 --> 06:53.917
they might become meticulous like men, absolutely matter of fact,

06:56.709 --> 07:04.500
very neat, tidy, clean, devoid of all beauty and sweetness.

07:10.125 --> 07:20.709
Then these women ultimately become like vampires

07:22.291 --> 07:25.333
so though the war is over

07:25.333 --> 07:30.417
it is working through the women of Germany, I think.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.709
I’d heard this attack had come before also

07:39.750 --> 07:43.999
and there were women called as Amazonic.

07:48.917 --> 07:52.208
Now that history is repeating itself again.

07:54.208 --> 07:57.333
The other day I had an interview with a German lady

07:58.750 --> 08:02.417
and I was amazed at her attitude

08:02.999 --> 08:08.000
because I felt she’s still a Nazi in her, some Nazi bhoot is sitting in her.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.917
She was a double personality, one way she was talking sweetly,

08:11.959 --> 08:15.000
another way she was a Nazi

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
and a fascist.

08:21.083 --> 08:29.709
And very cunningly they have got arguments.

08:31.417 --> 08:34.709
The first thing they can do is to say

08:37.750 --> 08:42.125
that we are siding with downtrodden people, like India.

08:43.291 --> 08:44.959
Indians are Aryans, we are Aryans

08:46.959 --> 08:54.709
and we are people who are sympathising with Aryans.

08:57.542 --> 08:59.417
Indians are spiritual people

09:00.000 --> 09:05.625
and they feel they are like Indians of all the things, you know, can you believe it?

09:08.500 --> 09:13.417
The quality of life should improve, is the point.

09:15.500 --> 09:20.834
The quality of men is different from that of women,

09:20.999 --> 09:23.083
I have told you many a times.

09:24.709 --> 09:29.709
And if women try to be manly

09:30.917 --> 09:33.750
then they cannot achieve anything proper.

09:33.999 --> 09:36.000
We have had many like this.

09:36.417 --> 09:40.000
You have seen Mao`s wife.

09:41.917 --> 09:45.000
You have seen Mrs Chanka Sheik.

09:45.542 --> 09:49.834
Now this new lady Carlos,

09:49.917 --> 09:53.542
Carlos her name is? Marcos, Marcos.

09:54.709 --> 09:56.834
So many women like this.

09:58.291 --> 10:02.125
They always make a mess of things when they try to be manly.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.999
In the history we have many women.

10:07.417 --> 10:11.625
In India women are very well equipped.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.125
we have had women like Jhansi ki Rani

10:14.208 --> 10:18.291
who fought against the British. She was a widow.

10:18.333 --> 10:24.750
She tied her child on her back and fought the British.

10:27.000 --> 10:33.333
They say that her horse jumped from 180ft

10:33.999 --> 10:37.000
from the turret of a fort

10:38.625 --> 10:40.959
and the Britishers have written down that

10:41.000 --> 10:45.417
‘Though we have got Jhansi the victory comes to us

10:45.500 --> 10:48.709
but glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani’.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.750
We have had great women in India.

10:50.792 --> 10:52.959
Like Nur Jahan was another great woman,

10:53.083 --> 10:56.000
we had Chand Bibi, Ahalyabai

10:56.208 --> 11:00.000
but they were all women, they didn’t have ego of men.

11:02.542 --> 11:08.834
When it comes to one can work, work in the offices with men

11:08.917 --> 11:11.750
but they need not become men.

11:11.834 --> 11:14.959
I’ll tell you an example of my own.

11:16.291 --> 11:19.500
I had to build our house in Lucknow.

11:21.917 --> 11:27.417
I did it in real woman style

11:27.999 --> 11:29.999
and I built a very good house,

11:30.000 --> 11:37.999
better than any man could build in a very very cheap way.

11:39.542 --> 11:43.000
Like a man would go, first of all he’ll get an architect,

11:44.291 --> 11:46.000
go and measure everything,

11:46.999 --> 11:49.999
then he’ll try to fit everything into it beforehand.

11:50.417 --> 11:55.333
Then he will in his ego go to some expensive place shop

11:55.625 --> 11:59.000
get something expensive, be cheated by that.

12:02.959 --> 12:08.208
Then again in his ego he’ll go and get some very expensive labour

12:09.208 --> 12:13.417
and appoint somebody, he’ll be in charge of everything, in charge.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.208
I did it in a very different way.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
I had money, so went and found out

12:25.834 --> 12:30.250
who have the best people, who have the best bricks.

12:30.999 --> 12:34.000
The house was to be built by bricks.

12:35.417 --> 12:37.959
Then what else do you need?

12:37.999 --> 12:41.834
Just like a woman would cook her food, you see.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.834
You need also sand, all right.

12:45.834 --> 12:52.959
Then you need cement and you need iron bars, and labour.

12:54.709 --> 12:58.000
So I didn’t go the way men went round.

13:00.083 --> 13:06.999
I found out the man who was selling the best bricks.

13:09.917 --> 13:13.542
So he said: “I have no money because I have to put up those kiln

13:13.999 --> 13:16.250
and fill them up with the bricks

13:16.333 --> 13:20.834
and for that you require initial money.

13:21.709 --> 13:25.500
I said: “Alright, I’ll buy one whole kiln from you, whole one.

13:27.083 --> 13:29.083
How much will you take from me?”

13:29.417 --> 13:31.125
He said: “Five thousand rupees sufficient.”

13:32.000 --> 13:34.625
But if he said, “If the kiln goes off,

13:34.834 --> 13:37.333
or there’s something wrong with it, if it misfired,

13:37.417 --> 13:39.625
then it is your lookout. I said: “Doesn’t matter.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.625
You put one kiln in my name.”

13:42.999 --> 13:45.999
So I bought a complete kiln from him, complete.

13:49.333 --> 13:54.291
kiln is a thing where they put all the bricks, you see,

13:54.417 --> 13:58.291
and then cover it with mud and fire it from down.

13:58.417 --> 14:01.834
Sometimes it could be that the whole thing can go into a waste

14:02.834 --> 14:05.834
or crumple down

14:05.959 --> 14:08.583
I said: "You do like that. Only 5.000."

14:11.999 --> 14:14.083
When it is nicely fired and all that

14:14.208 --> 14:17.208
it would cost you nothing short of 50,000 rupees.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.041
Then I went to the river and I said:

14:25.208 --> 14:31.000
“How much for a one part?” – as they call it, a big area of sand.

14:31.959 --> 14:37.542
They said: “At this time, when it is summertime, it is very little,

14:37.999 --> 14:40.999
but in wintertime it will be quite a lot.”

14:41.542 --> 14:45.917
A man would go, he’d say “Alright, now you need so much, bring it now.

14:45.999 --> 14:48.417
Then you will need more, you bring it now.”

14:48.500 --> 14:52.291
But I didn’t do that, I said “Summertime is a nice thing,

14:52.333 --> 14:54.625
cheap you are getting, why not buy the whole?”

14:54.709 --> 14:59.999
So I bought the whole part, the whole area of that sand.

15:02.125 --> 15:05.542
All right. Then I went for the ironmongers.

15:05.625 --> 15:07.709
I said: "Now what about iron?"

15:07.999 --> 15:10.417
They said: “You have to order

15:10.999 --> 15:15.999
but if you order in bulk then we’ll give you much cheaper.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.083
And cash down you have to pay so much.” I said “Alright.”

15:19.125 --> 15:24.125
I ordered it. So it was all ready, just like we do for cooking,

15:24.208 --> 15:27.000
you get everything ready made, ready there.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.542
Then what we needed was wood.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.500
So they said “Wood will come from Nepal.”

15:31.625 --> 15:35.500
I said “Alright. What else?”

15:35.625 --> 15:37.834
They said: “From any other forest it can come.”

15:37.999 --> 15:45.750
So I went to a forest in the centre of India called Jabalpur

15:45.834 --> 15:48.834
and there I ordered.

15:48.999 --> 15:52.417
The whole wood was cut, newly cut.

15:52.917 --> 15:57.291
and in an auction I bought a lot of wood from there.

15:58.291 --> 16:03.000
And I got all that there, plus I got the marble from there.

16:03.125 --> 16:06.500
This marble was never used before, anywhere.

16:08.125 --> 16:12.333
I said: “It’s very simple, I can use this marble for everything.”

16:12.417 --> 16:17.834
So I got marble and wood together from that place.

16:19.083 --> 16:24.625
Then the labour. Then I asked my friends

16:24.709 --> 16:30.750
if they knew any good workers who are good at masonary work.

16:30.834 --> 16:33.500
They said: “Yes, this one is good, that one is good”

16:33.583 --> 16:36.625
so I call all of them. I said, “See now you can stay with me in this house

16:36.667 --> 16:40.000
and I’ll feed you very well and I’ll give you food

16:40.083 --> 16:42.417
and I’ll look after you very well.”

16:42.959 --> 16:46.500
So they all settled down with their family

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
and I used to cook for them.

16:50.542 --> 16:55.959
By cooking I won them over and they would do anything for me.

16:58.542 --> 17:02.417
Absolutely. They’re so kind to me,

17:02.500 --> 17:07.667
they would produce new, new technique that they knew,

17:07.999 --> 17:14.291
they would produce an effect of marble out of the cement.

17:15.291 --> 17:19.417
All kinds of art that they had they put there.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.458
So such a big house with 20 bedrooms and five drawing rooms dining rooms

17:25.999 --> 17:29.417
was created within one year’s time.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.750
Not only that but the price of the house nobody can believe

17:35.999 --> 17:40.792
was one tenth of the one that the architect would have taken.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.500
But it was all written so well, everything done so well

17:45.542 --> 17:48.333
because I didn’t know how to write accounts so what I used to do,

17:49.000 --> 17:53.500
every day I used to say “Alright, today I take out so much money,

17:54.417 --> 17:58.000
then this much was spent. Like that I wrote every day

17:59.000 --> 18:02.999
and not one single rupee was missing in that.

18:03.999 --> 18:07.125
So nobody could prosecute me, no problem

18:07.208 --> 18:10.291
otherwise all the officers who built their houses there

18:10.375 --> 18:12.500
had to go through lots of problems,

18:12.625 --> 18:16.625
their income was taxed, this thing, nothing, nothing happened.

18:17.959 --> 18:21.417
And I got such a huge house made in such a little money

18:21.542 --> 18:23.542
and such a house that people said

18:23.625 --> 18:27.000
that even Taj Mahal may fall down, this will not fall.

18:28.417 --> 18:30.709
As I made a good foundation, everything,

18:30.750 --> 18:32.875
because I had bricks so cheap.

18:33.000 --> 18:37.166
The whole of that kiln I bought for no price at all

18:37.291 --> 18:40.999
and half of it I sold back because so much remaining.

18:42.834 --> 18:45.208
Then whatever I had bought the sand I brought it,

18:45.291 --> 18:47.999
sold half of it because I didn't need it,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.834
at double the price so I got my sand free.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.250
The wood that I had brought from there

18:56.333 --> 18:59.125
I got it properly chiseled out

18:59.375 --> 19:01.333
and I had a little tank in which I put it

19:01.417 --> 19:08.625
so the whole thing became absolutely, what you call that, weatherproof.

19:08.999 --> 19:14.625
I got it out and half of it I used, half of it only,

19:14.999 --> 19:20.000
for hundred windows and sixty doors and the rest of it I sold.

19:20.083 --> 19:24.834
And even the chips were sold as burning for wood,

19:24.917 --> 19:27.999
you see burning wood, what do you call that?

19:28.417 --> 19:30.792
So you can imagine something was sold as timber

19:30.999 --> 19:33.083
and some for the huts,

19:35.500 --> 19:37.834
but I had to do cooking for them,

19:37.999 --> 19:40.208
I had to look after their comfort,

19:40.417 --> 19:45.834
I got them nice blankets and nice beds to sleep and this and that

19:45.999 --> 19:47.999
so they were very happy.

19:48.542 --> 19:52.000
That’s how a woman works out and everybody was amazed.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.959
They could not find any faults with my, accounts,

19:54.999 --> 19:57.000
they could not find faults with anything

19:57.083 --> 20:01.959
and I told all my husband’s friends to keep five miles away from me.

20:06.500 --> 20:08.709
Because he was working with the Prime Minister,

20:09.542 --> 20:13.667
people would have said that: “Alright, She’s taking bribes” and things like that.

20:13.999 --> 20:17.000
Then there was, another problem was that,

20:17.083 --> 20:21.125
they would have come and told me: “This not good, that not good.”

20:21.166 --> 20:25.999
I kept them out because only they can argue, men can only argue.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.417
Women produce the results.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.250
No conferences, nothing. I said: "Nothing doing",

20:36.333 --> 20:38.417
"Let me do the job Myself."

20:38.500 --> 20:43.709
Very nicely in the company of all these people I built the house,

20:43.750 --> 20:48.917
a beautiful house which I think they have taken a film,

20:49.625 --> 20:53.208
and you might be able to see the house that I built there.

20:56.125 --> 20:59.583
So when the woman, who is a Sahaja yogini

20:59.625 --> 21:02.583
must develop her special qualities

21:02.834 --> 21:05.917
because she is very intuitive, woman is very intuitive.

21:05.959 --> 21:09.291
She always reaches the right conclusion in no time.

21:09.333 --> 21:14.333
If she’s a woman – but if she’s half-man and a little of a woman

21:14.417 --> 21:17.999
then I don’t know what sort of a thing she is.

21:19.500 --> 21:22.959
So a woman should try to be a woman, she’s so powerful,

21:23.000 --> 21:26.709
she’s powerful like this Mother Earth who can bear every sort of thing

21:27.542 --> 21:33.083
and she can give the best that is with her.

21:34.000 --> 21:43.000
Extremely sacrificing, extremely giving, forbearing, loving, forgiving.

21:43.959 --> 21:49.000
When men develop the women’s quality then they become saints.

21:52.000 --> 21:57.959
But not the woman’s quality that they run after women.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.709
This kind of a nonsense is not there.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.542
They have to be viras, they have to be chivalrous people,

22:03.625 --> 22:07.000
They have to be brave

22:07.083 --> 22:14.999
but with that they have to develop compassion, forgiveness.

22:19.834 --> 22:22.917
But I think it is the other way round in Germany very much,

22:22.999 --> 22:25.500
and I find around also among Western Sahaja Yogis

22:25.583 --> 22:27.834
this is a very common affair going on.

22:27.917 --> 22:31.333
Women develop horrible egos.

22:33.625 --> 22:38.125
In India women work. Everything they do.

22:39.542 --> 22:44.208
We have had great orators since long time, well known.

22:45.417 --> 22:50.917
But they don’t have ego. My mother was Honours,

22:51.000 --> 22:53.417
in those days when there were only two or three women

22:53.500 --> 22:55.417
who had done such a degree,

22:55.500 --> 22:58.999
but I never saw her with any ego in her.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.709
My own daughters, one of them has done architecture,

23:06.291 --> 23:09.125
and also interior decoration, she she’s not now working

23:09.208 --> 23:11.125
because her husband is working all right,

23:11.208 --> 23:13.917
but she makes houses for others, she draws for others,

23:13.959 --> 23:19.709
she helps others freely. And she has such friends.

23:21.083 --> 23:24.000
So what is the achievement of a woman?

23:24.208 --> 23:28.250
She has more people around her.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.000
Human power.

23:34.125 --> 23:37.291
She has more human beings around her.

23:38.333 --> 23:40.208
And what is the capacity of men?

23:40.333 --> 23:42.959
They have all the bills of the house to be paid,

23:43.000 --> 23:49.417
they have to pay for the insurance, the repairs of the car.

23:49.500 --> 23:53.417
Let them do the dirty jobs.

23:56.291 --> 24:00.125
Women receive all the love letters, from the children,

24:00.208 --> 24:02.542
from the husband, from everyone.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.500
They are loved. They are cared for.

24:09.542 --> 24:11.500
Now because they have become manly

24:11.959 --> 24:14.083
they don’t have all these advantages.

24:14.208 --> 24:18.750
Like formerly if you are going in a bus they would give a seat to a lady.

24:18.834 --> 24:20.291
Now nobody does that.

24:20.709 --> 24:25.375
Once a lady was travelling, old lady

24:25.417 --> 24:28.000
and there was one young fellow sitting there.

24:28.125 --> 24:30.417
I said: “Why don’t you allow her to sit down?”

24:30.500 --> 24:31.417
He said: “Why should I?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.917
She’s also wearing a pant, I’m also wearing a pant.”

24:33.959 --> 24:37.291
She was...this old lady was wearing trousers,

24:37.333 --> 24:40.834
so he said: “Why should I give her seat, she’s wearing a trouser,

24:40.999 --> 24:43.834
I’m wearing a trouser, what’s the difference?”

24:47.291 --> 24:50.000
So all that is our advantage and privilege

24:50.417 --> 24:53.625
we are losing by becoming men.

24:55.000 --> 25:01.000
And what do we gain?

25:01.417 --> 25:04.834
Actually, on the contrary, I think in modern days

25:04.917 --> 25:08.709
women are much more slaves of men than they were before.

25:10.208 --> 25:14.000
They get very upset. Say there’s a Sahaja Yogini.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.875
Now she’s caught up very badly and she has certain problems.

25:18.999 --> 25:21.000
First thing she’ll think about

25:21.083 --> 25:23.333
“Oh God, now my husband will leave me,

25:23.417 --> 25:27.208
he’ll take away my children, where will I do?”

25:27.291 --> 25:29.083
She’ll never think of Sahaja Yoga.

25:30.333 --> 25:33.750
But I met one extraordinary woman, I must say she was a real woman.

25:34.542 --> 25:37.750
She said: “Mother, because I’m schizophrenic

25:37.834 --> 25:42.083
I want to get out of Sahaja Yoga. I’ll divorce my husband,

25:42.834 --> 25:44.083
I don’t want to see my children,

25:44.125 --> 25:47.083
Sahaja Yoga is much more important than me,

25:47.208 --> 25:51.875
than my husband and my children."

25:51.999 --> 25:53.583
"There's a woman", I said.

25:53.625 --> 25:55.917
She said: “I am schizophrenic from childhood.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.709
I’ve discovered it now and it comes back on me”.

25:58.834 --> 26:01.125
But mostly women are worried about themselves.

26:01.208 --> 26:03.208
“Oh God, I’ll have to leave my husband,”

26:04.333 --> 26:07.750
means what they were doing was to sponge on the husband.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.750
“I’ll have to leave my children.”

26:13.917 --> 26:16.999
But what about leaving Sahaja Yoga?

26:17.750 --> 26:20.417
If you think Sahaja Yoga is the most important

26:20.625 --> 26:22.917
you’ll can get rid of your schizophrenia also.

26:22.959 --> 26:26.208
Why should God help you? We are just thinking like ordinary women,

26:26.291 --> 26:28.625
about yourself, only worried about yourself.

26:31.083 --> 26:34.000
Not worried about Sahaja Yoga.

26:37.291 --> 26:41.291
Same with some men, but men are not so much frightened

26:42.917 --> 26:45.750
because they think they can stand on their legs.

26:46.709 --> 26:49.000
And women should also know now they are Sahaja Yoginis

26:49.083 --> 26:52.000
that they are Sahaja Yoginis and Mother is going to look after them.

26:52.834 --> 26:55.500
But if you are worried about yourself only, your husband,

26:55.583 --> 27:01.333
my house, my children, then you are a gone case,

27:01.417 --> 27:04.417
you are no more a woman now. It’s not the sign of a good woman.

27:06.208 --> 27:10.333
A woman is that who loves all the children.

27:13.208 --> 27:16.917
Her loving capacity’s great, but if she becomes miserly,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.625
if she becomes small-minded, then she’s not a woman.

27:22.959 --> 27:24.417
I told you about my grand-daughters,

27:24.500 --> 27:27.208
I asked them: “What do you want to be?” They’re very small.

27:27.709 --> 27:33.999
So they said: “We want to be a nurse or an air hostess.”

27:34.750 --> 27:37.083
So I said: “Why? What is so great about these jobs?”

27:38.125 --> 27:41.834
They said: “Grandmother in these two jobs only you can feed people.”

27:44.417 --> 27:47.083
There’s no other job in which you can really feed other.

27:47.166 --> 27:53.000
The joy of feeding others is greater than writing files in the office.

27:55.625 --> 28:00.208
Absolutely I tell you. It’s a horrid job to write files in the office, see.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.709
It’s better to do some nice cooking,

28:07.792 --> 28:13.000
thinking so many are going to eat and enjoy it,

28:13.083 --> 28:16.417
than to do this dirty job.

28:17.709 --> 28:20.917
But women have lost their heads, they are not level-headed now.

28:20.999 --> 28:23.999
Become stupid.

28:26.125 --> 28:30.291
Now in Germany you have to be very careful.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.000
In Austria you have to be very careful.

28:32.083 --> 28:35.125
Austrian women are great but I would say German women

28:35.208 --> 28:37.208
that you don’t try to become men.

28:37.291 --> 28:42.208
First of all the best way to stop it is not to talk too much.

28:45.417 --> 28:49.750
If you start talking like men then all the bhoots will enter into you

28:49.834 --> 28:52.500
and start talking like men only.

28:52.750 --> 28:55.291
And then you will see how the men are controlled –

28:55.375 --> 28:59.709
we Indian women know how to control our men much better than you do.

29:02.959 --> 29:06.750
Why we don’t have divorces? Why we don’t have problems?

29:06.834 --> 29:08.750
We quarrel all right, doesn’t matter,

29:08.834 --> 29:11.291
but our men don’t run after another women.

29:13.542 --> 29:17.959
We don’t dress up s.., I mean, so much, we don’t go to hairdressers,

29:18.000 --> 29:21.291
we don’t have these beauty aids, all that.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.917
So develop your self-respect.

29:25.999 --> 29:30.291
You are the Shakti. You are the power.

29:32.125 --> 29:35.834
If you make your men cabbages what sort of children you’ll have?

29:35.917 --> 29:40.333
Cabbages only. Respect them.

29:41.125 --> 29:43.917
Make them men, enjoy their manliness.

29:45.542 --> 29:49.000
Then they’ll never give you up.

29:50.291 --> 29:52.625
There’s no competition between the two.

29:54.291 --> 29:57.750
I find the main problem today in Gemany is

29:57.834 --> 30:00.709
that the women have lost their senses.

30:00.792 --> 30:04.917
This is I feel absolutely about German women.

30:07.000 --> 30:13.625
Take to music, take to art. So much scope is there.

30:13.709 --> 30:19.500
Today, who is remembered? See in here, who is remembered?

30:19.542 --> 30:24.083
A musician, Mozart. Everyone remembers Mozart,

30:24.166 --> 30:28.417
even on a chocolate you’ll find a Mozart there.

30:30.208 --> 30:33.917
I don’t know poor thing did he ever eat any chocolates or not.

30:37.125 --> 30:43.000
Or they will remember, see here, they have Michelangelo

30:43.083 --> 30:48.542
or they’ll have Leonardo da Vinci, or they’ll have somebody like that.

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
Nobody remembers who was the officer at that time,

30:57.208 --> 30:59.291
running with the file, up and down.

31:06.083 --> 31:10.917
So women have something that they can be of eternal value,

31:11.291 --> 31:12.709
that they should develop.

31:12.792 --> 31:16.500
The greatest thing is that woman can love, and love and love.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.750
But when she becomes selfish and self-centred,

31:18.834 --> 31:23.083
starts worrying about herself there’s no beauty in her love.

31:25.917 --> 31:28.000
Today I took it up specially this thing

31:28.083 --> 31:31.000
because today you are worshipping me as Kartiyeka.

31:33.750 --> 31:37.000
Kartikeya was the son of Parvati Umar.

31:44.542 --> 31:50.500
Who was just a mother of these two children, Ganesha and Kartikeya.

31:53.625 --> 32:04.333
And one day the parents Shankara and Parvati both of them said:

32:04.417 --> 32:13.709
“Out of you two, the one who goes round the Mother Earth first time

32:14.000 --> 32:17.999
will get a special prize.

32:20.000 --> 32:27.208
So Kartikeya was the manly power,absolutely, and he said:

32:27.291 --> 32:32.542
"Alright, I’ll start on his own conveyance” which was a peacock.

32:32.999 --> 32:36.125
And Ganesha said to himself:

32:36.208 --> 32:38.709
“Now look at me, I’m a little boy,

32:39.417 --> 32:44.709
I am not like him and my conveyance is a little mouse.

32:44.750 --> 32:48.917
How will I manage?” But then he thought:

32:50.125 --> 32:54.417
'My Mother is higher than the whole universe.'

32:54.625 --> 32:57.542
'What is this Mother Earth?’

32:57.999 --> 33:02.291
So this Kartykeya was out, going round the Mother Earth.

33:03.417 --> 33:06.333
Shri Ganesha went round his Mother three times.

33:07.125 --> 33:10.417
And he got the prize!

33:12.125 --> 33:16.208
Because of that motherly qualities for Him She’s the highest,

33:16.291 --> 33:19.125
even higher than Sadashiva.

33:21.709 --> 33:24.999
But surprisingly that is what Sadashiva likes.

33:25.291 --> 33:28.834
That you respect your mother. The motherhood in you.

33:29.917 --> 33:31.999
The womanhood in you.

33:32.750 --> 33:39.417
‘Where the women are respectable and respected

33:39.500 --> 33:41.709
there the Gods reside.’

33:42.625 --> 33:44.417
Women are very important.

33:44.458 --> 33:46.792
Of course I must blame the Western men also.

33:46.834 --> 33:49.000
the way they have ill-treated their women,

33:49.417 --> 33:53.083
have kept out of religion,, have always put them down,

33:53.166 --> 33:55.000
I mean, India we had Muslims doing that

33:55.208 --> 33:58.834
but they are even very sophisticated aggressors

33:58.875 --> 34:02.625
and they did it very badly and they kept all of them down.

34:02.667 --> 34:04.999
But doesn’t matter.

34:06.000 --> 34:13.000
Still, forgive them and try to be women.

34:13.208 --> 34:20.834
Very powerful. The powers of a woman are that of love,

34:21.000 --> 34:27.625
which are the powers of God. And that is to be used

34:27.750 --> 34:31.834
than to use other argumentative intellectualism, all nonsense.

34:32.709 --> 34:34.625
Don’t waste your energy with that.

34:34.999 --> 34:38.625
I would like, specially the Sahaja Yoginis of Germany,

34:40.083 --> 34:43.000
to become more and more ladylike.

34:43.959 --> 34:48.291
It doesn’t mean good cooking only but in the attitude towards life.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
To think in a wider way

34:54.417 --> 34:58.333
that the whole Sahaja Yoga depends on our love capacity.

34:58.417 --> 35:02.125
We have to be extremely loving, extremely kind,

35:02.208 --> 35:05.667
looking after Sahaja Yogis,

35:07.999 --> 35:10.417
giving them all the joy that is possible.

35:13.291 --> 35:17.999
Otherwise in this country they can become like vampires.

35:19.000 --> 35:23.291
So be very careful and for men also I would say

35:23.333 --> 35:26.999
if there are women of that kind you must respect,

35:27.542 --> 35:32.000
you must give them all their privileges, look after them.

35:33.125 --> 35:35.834
They look after children but give them all the assistance,

35:35.917 --> 35:39.125
all the money that is needed by them.

35:40.291 --> 35:43.834
Do not ask for accounts and things, let them manage it.

35:43.999 --> 35:47.500
At the most you’ll become bankrupt, as it is you are.

35:51.834 --> 35:56.083
But first see what is their attitude towards Sahaja Yoga is.

35:56.125 --> 36:01.125
I’ve seen in the families where the women are in charge of the purse

36:01.208 --> 36:04.208
always we get much more money for Sahaja Yoga work

36:04.417 --> 36:08.000
than from the houses where the men are in control.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.542
It’s very surprising. When men are in control

36:12.625 --> 36:15.208
they have to think of their car,

36:16.750 --> 36:18.917
they have to think of many big things,

36:18.999 --> 36:23.083
but when women are in control they know how to save money,

36:23.166 --> 36:25.500
as I have shown you how I have saved money.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.750
Men can never save. They can never save money.

36:29.750 --> 36:32.542
Only the women can save but if they have a larger interest

36:32.625 --> 36:36.834
otherwise if they are self indulgent they’ll finish off all the money

36:36.917 --> 36:40.083
by going into the shop to buy a shirt for a man

36:40.208 --> 36:44.208
they’ll buy all saris for themselves. They can do like that.

36:45.291 --> 36:48.542
But if they have wider interests, if they have greater interest,

36:48.625 --> 36:53.208
they can use money so cleverly

36:53.291 --> 36:57.834
that they’ll have always money to spend for others. What do I do?

36:57.917 --> 37:00.291
What has, whatever my husband gives me to run the house –

37:00.417 --> 37:03.709
it’s quite a lot I should say – but I stinge on things,

37:03.792 --> 37:08.333
I go to the main markets, get things from there,

37:08.417 --> 37:11.709
try to save money on that, save here, save on my clothes.

37:11.834 --> 37:18.208
I, first time I have given my sweaters for dry cleaning in a good shop.

37:19.000 --> 37:23.834
That’s how a woman saves and then she spends for the general good.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
Because that is her real satisfaction.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.959
If we develop that kind of a balanced view about our married life,

37:33.000 --> 37:37.834
about our social life we’ll be ideal people in this world.

37:38.542 --> 37:41.959
About school also, I have said it, very clearly.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.125
Now if you want to hear about it

37:44.208 --> 37:46.999
I would request – have you got that pamphlet with you?

37:47.083 --> 37:49.834
Wanted to read it.

37:56.333 --> 38:03.917
Uh? No you don’t have. That’s just like men.

38:07.208 --> 38:10.750
They themselves said they would like to read it here you see.

38:16.542 --> 38:23.125
If you ask men to do the cooking everything will be missing. So,

38:24.625 --> 38:28.750
Shri Mataji, may I most respectfully ask you,

38:28.834 --> 38:32.917
is there any advantage at all in being a man?

38:46.208 --> 38:49.291
Without the man woman cannot express herself.

38:49.417 --> 38:53.625
She cannot express, because she is the potential.

38:54.834 --> 38:58.625
He is the kinetic. It’s absolutely relative terminology.

38:58.709 --> 39:02.834
You cannot, exist without a man, you cannot.

39:02.917 --> 39:06.709
Even if, supposing, if you have all the fragrance in the Mother Earth

39:06.834 --> 39:08.625
unless and until you have the flowers

39:08.709 --> 39:11.709
how will you know there is fragrance in Mother Earth?

39:14.291 --> 39:17.291
Men are most important otherwise what will they do?

39:17.333 --> 39:20.333
All their energy will be all rotten.

39:26.083 --> 39:29.500
So if women are the Mother Earth you are the flowers.

39:34.083 --> 39:39.709
Advantage what? You are the people who, ...everybody sees you.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.750
Running around like Kartikeya.

39:55.333 --> 39:59.083
What can we do? You are like that.

39:59.917 --> 40:05.625
You cannot sit at home. You cannot even in the train,

40:05.709 --> 40:09.542
if you are going, you’ll find as soon as the train will stop

40:09.625 --> 40:12.999
all the men will get out of the train. They can’t sit there.

40:18.625 --> 40:22.709
Like, I told my husband:

40:22.750 --> 40:25.834
“What is this all the time you are running out of the house?

40:25.999 --> 40:28.417
Why can't you sit in the house for some time? You must sit.

40:28.625 --> 40:33.291
So he said: "No, in our side if any man, sits in the house

40:33.333 --> 40:34.834
he’s called as ghargusana",

40:34.917 --> 40:37.750
means 'who is all the time in the house', you see.

40:37.834 --> 40:39.333
And I said: “What do they call to man

40:39.417 --> 40:41.125
who always runs away from the house gharbhagna

40:41.208 --> 40:43.917
Means 'the run, runner away, who runs away'.

40:43.999 --> 40:45.709
There should be something in between.

40:45.750 --> 40:47.834
But that’s manly, it’s all right.

40:47.875 --> 40:50.959
But we can, with Sahaja Yoga, what we can do

40:50.999 --> 40:54.834
is to form a little balance between both the things.

40:57.709 --> 41:00.917
That is what Sahaja Yoga is, that it gives a balance.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.542
Then you start be…enjoying each other’s company so much

41:04.625 --> 41:08.000
that even in the house you enjoy, outside also enjoy.

41:08.208 --> 41:12.291
So you can be together in the house, also outside.

41:13.959 --> 41:18.208
The interests are the same because the interest becomes the same.

41:20.083 --> 41:23.959
Like the flowers who fall on the Mother Earth

41:25.083 --> 41:27.000
make the Mother Earth fragrant

41:27.208 --> 41:29.917
and then we can say that Mother Earth is fragrant.

41:31.542 --> 41:37.000
As beautiful as that. Alright.

41:38.208 --> 41:41.083
So for education I’ve already given instructions

41:42.083 --> 41:43.834
and I’ve already talked about it

41:43.875 --> 41:47.542
that we are not to make a big ado out of this Maria Montessori

41:47.583 --> 41:52.834
and this and that. We are going to have Sahaja Yoga schools.

41:52.917 --> 41:55.333
All nonsense, because I have seen

41:55.417 --> 41:57.000
those who are teaching in Maria Montessori style,

41:57.208 --> 41:59.834
the women have become horrible.

42:01.500 --> 42:06.083
Was amazed the amount of ego they have developed in themselves.

42:07.291 --> 42:10.625
So you become Sahaja Yoga teachers

42:11.000 --> 42:13.125
and it’s going to be a Sahaja Yoga school.

42:13.208 --> 42:21.125
In, Sydney or in Melbourne,

42:21.208 --> 42:24.750
we started the school in Melbourne very nicely

42:25.000 --> 42:28.208
and now they are going to have it in Sydney the same way.

42:28.542 --> 42:31.959
And openly it is a Sahaja Yoga school, there’s no fear about it.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.625
Openly it’s a Sahaja Yoga school,

42:34.834 --> 42:38.333
and then people have achieved so much out of it.

42:39.083 --> 42:41.750
We, why should we take any garb like that?

42:41.834 --> 42:44.834
We should go all out to say its a Sahaja Yoga school.

42:44.917 --> 42:48.000
So you, the teachers, also become experts in Sahaja Yoga,

42:48.417 --> 42:53.333
so they have to be good Sahaja Yogis, Yoginis or Sahaja Yogis.

42:53.417 --> 42:56.959
They should not be egoistical, there should be no ego in them,

42:57.000 --> 42:57.917
they should not be catching,

42:58.000 --> 43:00.500
anybody who’s catching is not a good teacher for Sahaja Yoga.

43:00.542 --> 43:05.291
It’s not like in a Maria Montessori school

43:05.333 --> 43:07.917
that in the night the teacher drinks, smokes

43:07.959 --> 43:10.500
and morning time she’s a Maria Montessori teacher.

43:11.291 --> 43:13.291
Here you have to be a Sahaja Yogini first

43:13.333 --> 43:17.083
and then only you can teach in a Sahaja Yoga school.

43:18.333 --> 43:21.417
You have to have that quality, that is very important,

43:21.500 --> 43:25.208
as it is important that we should get students who are Realized Souls

43:25.291 --> 43:27.083
or who can get Realization.

43:29.333 --> 43:35.083
Alright, so today’s puja is specially for Kartikeya.

43:36.542 --> 43:53.709
Kartikeya represents the great, we can say the captor or leader of all the ganas,

43:55.125 --> 44:01.000
of all the, like a Commander-in-Chief.

44:02.500 --> 44:07.208
Ganesha is the King but He is the Commander-in-Chief

44:07.291 --> 44:14.625
and because German character is to be in command of everything

44:14.999 --> 44:18.959
we are going to have this puja

44:19.000 --> 44:24.500
where the men will be in command of their spirits

44:26.000 --> 44:27.750
and their manly qualities

44:28.542 --> 44:32.500
and women will be in command of their womanly qualities.

44:33.542 --> 44:38.959
To be in command is different from to be a master.

44:40.291 --> 44:43.917
Master owns it, a commander does not own it.

44:46.291 --> 44:50.917
He does not own it, that is also lost.

44:51.625 --> 44:54.959
Possession is also lost, we just command it.

44:57.125 --> 44:59.959
And that is the state we have to come to now,

45:00.000 --> 45:07.417
from Ganesha state to the state of Kartikeya.

45:07.500 --> 45:08.917
The other way round.

45:08.959 --> 45:11.208
Ganesha is nice, he’s the King,

45:11.291 --> 45:16.999
very nicely sitting down with all the powers, alright?

45:17.125 --> 45:20.500
Innocence is there,

45:20.542 --> 45:27.709
but Kartikeya’s the one who commands innocence,

45:29.542 --> 45:32.750
gives you a power of that commandment.

45:35.458 --> 45:38.291
He commands. After the Guru Puja

45:38.417 --> 45:42.625
it's better that we should have the power to command others

45:43.000 --> 45:50.417
and that commanding spirit comes in the men

45:50.500 --> 45:55.999
through their talking, through their dynamism,

45:56.000 --> 45:59.208
through their personal achievements;

45:59.291 --> 46:03.500
for the women through their loving power,

46:03.583 --> 46:09.125
through their forbearance, through their gracious behaviour,

46:10.542 --> 46:13.208
forgiveness, compassion.

46:13.417 --> 46:18.625
So let us develop that today, that we can command it,

46:18.834 --> 46:21.792
means it’s not that what we have

46:21.834 --> 46:24.417
but in a position we are to command.

46:25.208 --> 46:28.709
I hope you understand what is Kartikeya.

46:28.750 --> 46:31.125
May God Bless You.

46:34.542 --> 46:37.458
So let us start the Puja.

46:49.999 --> 46:55.291
Who made this? You made it - this Ganesha?

46:55.417 --> 46:57.917
Such a sweet thing.

47:01.417 --> 47:06.834
You are very good, I must say. May God bless you!

47:12.250 --> 47:17.333
Get some German people to do it also.

47:29.999 --> 47:33.417
Let us have some more people here from Germany.

47:34.999 --> 47:37.792
Ladies also, of course.

48:43.999 --> 48:46.959
The one who has made Ganesha - is she German too?

48:50.875 --> 48:54.999
This one also should wash.

49:06.166 --> 49:10.000
All those who wrote letters for Me to come to Germany

49:10.125 --> 49:12.792
should come to wash My feet.

49:13.041 --> 49:16.750
May God bless you! May God bless you! Thank you!

49:18.999 --> 49:25.834
Take out that one from inside. Now take that out. There is no need.

55:48.875 --> 55:50.583
We call her Kamala, Kamala.

55:50.999 --> 55:53.500
Kamala is the name of the goddess, all right?

55:53.667 --> 56:02.166
Kamal Lakshmi. Kamala. May God bless you.

56:20.834 --> 56:25.583
We can have a singing little bit, because there are two ladies more.

56:27.834 --> 56:31.667
And Hugo still has to do it.

56:43.458 --> 56:46.208
Good.

57:07.000 --> 57:10.000
That's it.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
May God bless you.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.834
Come to the other side.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.917
Who are the ladies now? There are some more ladies? Finished?

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Good.

59:42.000 --> 59:46.083
Use the same water

01:00:46.417 --> 01:00:50.667
They can use the same water, because too much water already there.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.250
Now we can say the one thousand names of Kartikeya.

01:04:41.625 --> 01:04:46.000
No, 108.

01:04:49.083 --> 01:04:54.000
I thought 1000 would be good idea, but let it be 108.

01:04:58.999 --> 01:05:01.834
Let`s see how it works out with 108.

01:05:03.999 --> 01:05:06.166
Say it loudly.

01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:59.291
Say it loudly, it's not clear.

01:06:05.999 --> 01:06:08.208
No, not yet. Get him another one,

01:06:08.834 --> 01:06:10.625
let him have one more,

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:14.000
because must be clearly, otherwise it has no meaning.

01:28:54.417 --> 01:28:58.375
In these 108 names, if you have noticed,

01:28:59.792 --> 01:29:06.458
they have shown that Kartikeya is the innocence

01:29:06.834 --> 01:29:11.542
that is acting on the right hand side, in the Pingala.

01:29:11.834 --> 01:29:17.000
and that is also - it is very much related to Prana.

01:29:17.417 --> 01:29:23.208
It gives you Prana. Prana is the vital breath that we take

01:29:23.333 --> 01:29:26.166
- breathe in and breathe out.

01:29:26.417 --> 01:29:28.375
so it is related to the right side.

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:32.834
Then also it is related to eternity - Anantari.

01:29:32.999 --> 01:29:37.834
Anantar is the snake, the Shesha.

01:29:37.999 --> 01:29:41.458
which is the brother of Vishnu.

01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:46.999
So it is He who is represented here as Kartikeya.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.417
He is called as Anantar.

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.375
So he is the fire.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:58.583
He is the one who ignites within you the capacity

01:29:58.667 --> 01:30:01.000
to consume the force,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.000
also the capacity to command the people

01:30:07.417 --> 01:30:16.750
and also the capacity to be a person full of brilliance.

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:20.917
You see, an innocent person could be very brilliant.

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:27.792
All these capacities are expressed in Kartikeya's Swarupa

01:30:27.875 --> 01:30:30.000
in his state.

01:30:30.208 --> 01:30:34.000
Today by worshipping Kartikeya we have to know,

01:30:34.417 --> 01:30:38.250
that Kartikeya is now awakened within us.

01:30:38.999 --> 01:30:44.999
And with that capacity we have to fight.

01:30:45.208 --> 01:30:47.000
Ultimately He is the Nishkalanka.

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:49.417
He is the one who is the fighter.

01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:53.999
So from Ganesha to Christ to Nishkalanka.

01:30:54.208 --> 01:30:56.208
These are the three stages

01:30:56.291 --> 01:30:59.208
into which the innocence has gone.

01:30:59.291 --> 01:31:07.834
From Ganesha to Kartikeya and now to Christ.

01:31:07.999 --> 01:31:11.208
And from Christ to Nishkalanka.

01:31:11.417 --> 01:31:14.834
In the form of Nishkalanka He is innocent.

01:31:14.917 --> 01:31:18.208
so there is no Kalanka, there is no spot on Him, nothing.

01:31:18.291 --> 01:31:20.417
He is absolutely clean, immaculate.

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:22.999
Plus He is fiery.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.500
Plus He has all the qualities of Ekadesha Rudra.

01:31:27.583 --> 01:31:31.709
Means the eleven qualities or the forces of Shiva

01:31:31.792 --> 01:31:33.709
which can kill..

01:31:33.999 --> 01:31:39.709
So He has a capacity to kill and destroy that is evil,

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:46.999
and to give blessings and courage to His followers.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:52.375
This is the last incarnation, which is called Kalaki.

01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:56.166
In normal words you call it Kalaki, is actually Nishkalanka.

01:31:56.250 --> 01:31:58.000
Is the white horse.

01:31:58.125 --> 01:32:03.208
So it is the Kartikeya who sits on the white horse.

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:06.999
So how innocence grows within you now

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.417
is up to the point of Kartikeya.

01:32:11.542 --> 01:32:14.999
This has been today done on this land,

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.999
Deutschland as you call it,

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.834
where Kartikeya is to be born within you, to be awakened within you.

01:32:21.999 --> 01:32:24.000
May God bless you!

01:32:40.208 --> 01:32:43.000
Now if you want you can sing some songs

01:32:43.208 --> 01:32:45.999
as "Ya Devi Sarva Buteshu", which one you like.

01:32:46.083 --> 01:32:49.417
I would like to have ladies here, seven married ladies

01:32:54.625 --> 01:32:56.417
just to help me out.

01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:01.417
First we'll have little girls if there are in here.

01:33:01.500 --> 01:33:03.625
The little girls have to come up.

01:33:06.999 --> 01:33:10.041
Little later, when you have to garland Me, all right?

01:33:10.125 --> 01:33:12.999
Now the girls have to come.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.417
Where are the girls? All the girls have to come.

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:18.417
Who are all the other girls who are here?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.417
All right. Come along. Right, come on.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.999
You also come along, both of you.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000
All right, you also come, both of you.

01:33:44.417 --> 01:33:46.500
Sit down. Sit down.

01:33:47.625 --> 01:33:53.834
If there is any unmarried girl, big unmarried girl - please come.

01:34:02.999 --> 01:34:05.625
Somebody who is not yet married.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.999
Someone - come.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.709
Remove this one, I think. Ask somebody to remove this.

01:35:25.417 --> 01:35:29.792
Gregoire: "Shri Mataji, first before we sing the hynm to the Goddess

01:35:29.917 --> 01:35:35.917
we would like to read to You an amended version of the Lord's Prayer."

01:35:39.999 --> 01:35:41.208
Our Mother

01:35:41.417 --> 01:35:43.000
Who art on earth

01:35:43.208 --> 01:35:45.709
Hallowed be Thy name

01:35:45.999 --> 01:35:48.333
Thy kingdom come

01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.500
Thy will be done

01:35:50.625 --> 01:35:53.875
On earth as it is in heaven

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.208
Give us this day Your divine vibrations

01:35:58.417 --> 01:35:59.208
And forgive us our trespasses

01:36:03.625 --> 01:36:04.834
As we forgive those

01:36:04.834 --> 01:36:07.208
Who trespass against us

01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:09.625
And lead us not into maya

01:36:10.208 --> 01:36:12.625
But deliver us from evil

01:36:12.625 --> 01:36:14.417
For Thine is the Father

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.834
The children and the glory

01:36:16.834 --> 01:36:21.625
Forever and ever. Amen."

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.208
So very sweet.
