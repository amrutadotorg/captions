WEBVTT

00:32.382 --> 00:36.799
You all have come now to Bangalore,

00:37.000 --> 00:42.325
and yesterday you
had gone to Mysore,

00:42.526 --> 00:46.734
which was ruled by Mahishasura.

00:46.935 --> 00:50.967
That’s the reason you didn’t get your
food -

00:52.813 --> 00:55.140
it crossed you.

00:55.341 --> 01:00.696
It’s better not to eat food in such places,
isn’t it?

01:01.056 --> 01:02.545
All right.

01:02.746 --> 01:09.592
So, it’s a very beautiful place
Bangalore is.

01:09.793 --> 01:13.517
Climate is beautiful and you’ll find always

01:13.718 --> 01:19.270
these rakshasas lived in places like this.

01:19.471 --> 01:22.273
Like in Pune, you have, you know this
Rajneesh was there -

01:22.474 --> 01:25.434
here is this Mahishasura still.

01:25.635 --> 01:30.567
They always try to find places which are
cold

01:30.768 --> 01:35.061
because they have so much heat in their
body.

01:36.593 --> 01:44.154
Now as you know, there’s one more rakshasa
here who has to be exposed.

01:44.577 --> 01:50.542
And this, today through our puja, we
should achieve.

01:57.295 --> 02:03.079
In the olden days, when the Goddess had
to fight the rakshasas,

02:03.280 --> 02:12.112
the rakshasas were not involved in human
beings as such.

02:12.313 --> 02:16.577
They didn’t become gurus or anything.

02:16.778 --> 02:21.979
And so, now we find in Kali Yuga,

02:22.180 --> 02:29.762
they have gone into the brains of sadhakas,
of their devotees.

02:29.963 --> 02:32.988
It’s very difficult to remove them.

02:33.189 --> 02:37.564
And once they go into the brain
of the sadhakas,

02:37.765 --> 02:42.130
then sadhakas become, of course, possessed,

02:42.351 --> 02:47.670
they suffer, they have all kinds
of problems.

02:47.871 --> 02:51.722
Despite that, they stick onto that person

02:51.923 --> 02:56.640
because they are mesmerized, very much
mesmerized.

02:56.841 --> 03:03.027
And this mesmerism makes them absolutely
so strong headed

03:03.228 --> 03:08.393
that even if they have to die, they
won’t give up their gurus.

03:13.319 --> 03:19.797
The main thing is that in this Kali Yuga
there are so many sadhakas,

03:19.998 --> 03:23.938
they are running helter and skelter.
They are running all over,

03:24.139 --> 03:28.727
trying to find out some way of finding
the truth.

03:28.928 --> 03:34.850
While when the market is on, you know,
you get people to sell it also.

03:35.051 --> 03:37.535
So that’s how so many have come up

03:37.736 --> 03:42.743
and are trying these things, tricks,
on people all over.

03:42.944 --> 03:49.780
Most of them have gone to the Western
countries because people have money.

03:49.981 --> 03:53.536
Thank God we are not so rich in India

03:53.737 --> 03:59.044
that they could not befool us - especially
in America.

03:59.245 --> 04:06.085
And Americans took to these people as
a fish takes to water, very surprisingly.

04:06.286 --> 04:11.822
I went there and told them and warned
them - they wouldn’t listen to me.

04:12.023 --> 04:16.352
They can’t understand anything that you
can get without money.

04:16.553 --> 04:22.956
But despite all that, so many of you have
been able

04:23.157 --> 04:27.118
to come to Sahaja Yoga and get
to the reality.

04:27.319 --> 04:34.010
It’s your destiny. It’s blessings to you
of your previous lives

04:34.211 --> 04:38.450
that you could see it so clearly and come
to Sahaja Yoga;

04:38.651 --> 04:43.806
and now you have grown so much, you have
become so matured

04:44.007 --> 04:50.531
and you understand what others are doing
is absolutely wrong.

04:54.608 --> 04:58.949
Also somebody told me about this fellow
Boy John (George) misbehaving

04:59.150 --> 05:01.509
with these homosexuals and all that,

05:01.710 --> 05:04.859
and calling them “Hare Rama, Hare
Krishna” - all nonsense.

05:05.060 --> 05:10.509
Then I discovered that this story is very
prevalent in Kerala,

05:10.710 --> 05:15.377
where they say that Krishna when He became,

05:15.578 --> 05:22.375
I mean Vishnu, when He became Mohini,
He had a child from Shiva. Absurd.

05:22.576 --> 05:25.015
And now, Murti is telling me when I told
you this story,

05:25.216 --> 05:29.697
you said, “This is blasphemy, this is sin.”
Same way I feel.

05:29.898 --> 05:33.959
It’s very dangerous also to play about
with a person like Vishnu.

05:34.160 --> 05:37.099
He is a very dangerous deity.

05:37.300 --> 05:42.566
Shiva, ultimately, is very dangerous but
it takes time with Him.

05:42.767 --> 05:46.671
But as far as Vishnu is concerned, one has
to be very careful,

05:46.872 --> 05:50.692
misbehaving like this. I don’t know
what is going to happen to them.

05:50.893 --> 05:56.223
But they are so stupid, they are so stupid.

05:56.424 --> 06:03.332
One thing they should judge that if this
thing you are doing is good for them,

06:03.543 --> 06:09.217
is by God’s blessings, then why should you
get diseases?

06:10.980 --> 06:15.234
There is a regular one crore of people,
going to a nonsensical place

06:15.435 --> 06:18.316
where they have this Ayappa business,

06:18.517 --> 06:22.760
and they wear black dresses for one month,

06:22.961 --> 06:26.913
and they have their beard and everything.

06:27.114 --> 06:32.966
They starve themselves, they go up, miles
together they climb,

06:33.167 --> 06:38.179
do all kinds of things that is a sort
of a suffering for one month.

06:38.380 --> 06:45.235
And eleven months they do everything.
This kind of a nonsense, you see.

06:45.436 --> 06:51.290
So now it has become like a craze like
jogging or something like that in Kerala.

06:51.491 --> 06:56.740
And this year there were one crore
of people doing this stupid nonsense.

06:56.941 --> 07:01.133
I mean, even in India we have such stupid
people, you can see that.

07:01.334 --> 07:07.549
But the number is not so much, I must say,
as it is in America, percentage.

07:07.750 --> 07:12.182
In India, we are very conditioned
by this ritualism,

07:12.383 --> 07:15.502
especially in the South we have lots
of ritualistic things.

07:15.703 --> 07:19.771
And we are impressed by people if you take
out some watches,

07:19.972 --> 07:23.052
Swiss made watches, or things like that.

07:23.253 --> 07:26.301
To them, it’s something really remarkable
that how can you have

07:26.502 --> 07:32.539
Swiss made watches here. Very simple
people.

07:32.921 --> 07:41.379
They do not understand that none
of the incarnations did these tricks

07:41.867 --> 07:51.142
and that truth should be based on
the tradition, on the shastras.

07:51.343 --> 07:56.441
It cannot deviate and whatever deviates

07:56.642 --> 08:03.905
is actually heretic and also is blasphemy.

08:04.107 --> 08:10.742
But as I told you the other day that those
people who talk of knowledge, like Sufis,

08:10.943 --> 08:16.296
who got their realisation, real Sufis, they
were called as heretics -

08:16.497 --> 08:21.984
they were thrown out of the religion.
Also the Christians -

08:22.185 --> 08:28.725
the early Christians, who were Gnostics -
were called as mad people, heretics.

08:28.926 --> 08:32.760
In the same way, those who are following
stupid things,

08:32.961 --> 08:39.147
and are following something that is very
black and dark, negative,

08:39.348 --> 08:43.024
will definitely go against Sahaja Yoga

08:43.225 --> 08:51.556
and will say that this is something heretic
or it is something that is blasphemy.

08:52.074 --> 08:55.849
But, as you understand now what it is,

08:56.050 --> 09:01.444
we have to bring forth new laws that those
who are not Sahaja Yogis

09:01.645 --> 09:05.177
are actually, if they are practicing any
religion,

09:05.385 --> 09:09.561
they are not doing the right thing.

09:09.762 --> 09:13.370
Slowly slowly, as Vatican is getting
exposed

09:13.571 --> 09:16.327
and the Christian churches are getting
exposed,

09:16.528 --> 09:20.901
even in India, so many such organisations
are getting exposed,

09:21.102 --> 09:25.924
and people are understanding that this is
very wrong.

09:27.452 --> 09:38.314
These ideas actually have come from
incarnations only,

09:38.515 --> 09:44.038
like Adi Shankaracharya himself has said,
“Tatatkim, tatatkim, tatatkim” -

09:44.239 --> 09:47.010
if you have not followed your guru,
then “tatatkim”.

09:47.200 --> 09:51.664
So they said now any guru can come
from the jail,

09:51.865 --> 09:58.355
can be a smuggler, can be anything,
characterless person -

09:58.556 --> 10:02.611
if you call him a guru, then he is a guru.

10:03.017 --> 10:09.170
Whatever we call somebody, say we call
somebody as a guru

10:09.683 --> 10:13.083
and we stick on, “This is my guru.”

10:13.284 --> 10:18.238
But what did the guru give to you, that
nobody asks.

10:18.439 --> 10:21.426
We just feel happy, “Oh, very nice.”

10:21.627 --> 10:26.724
It’s like the worms clinging onto the lotus
and saying, “Oh, we have lotus.”

10:26.925 --> 10:31.478
What about you, you are a worm still,
what is the use of these lotuses?

10:31.679 --> 10:36.273
Or whether that is lotus or a snake, God
only knows.

10:36.474 --> 10:42.869
So a guru who doesn’t talk of realisation,
who doesn’t talk of Kundalini,

10:43.070 --> 10:48.272
who doesn’t talk of ascent, who doesn’t
talk of second birth -

10:48.473 --> 10:52.976
cannot be a guru - minimum of minimum.

10:53.872 --> 11:00.107
So like we also believe in say Rama,
“I believe in Rama.” So what?

11:00.308 --> 11:04.292
Are you obliging Rama or Rama is obliging
you?

11:04.493 --> 11:07.889
“I believe in Christ” - so what?

11:08.090 --> 11:10.527
You believe in this, you believe in that -

11:10.728 --> 11:13.724
it’s such an absurd idea, still I never
understand

11:13.925 --> 11:17.518
when people say, “I believe in this.”

11:17.719 --> 11:21.233
But what does that mean, what does that
mean?

11:21.434 --> 11:24.035
You believe in Christ.

11:24.236 --> 11:27.041
You are leading a licentious life, you are
doing all kinds -

11:27.242 --> 11:34.132
but “I believe in Christ, I believe
in God.”

11:34.333 --> 11:39.412
Doing everything against divinity, and
“I believe”.

11:39.890 --> 11:43.894
So the question comes: what do you mean
by believing?

11:44.095 --> 11:49.666
It’s like, “I believe, it is silver” -
so what? It is silver.

11:49.867 --> 11:53.623
What does it make to you to believe by that
saying something

11:53.824 --> 11:59.039
you have done great? What is great in that?

11:59.240 --> 12:03.936
Now if you say, “I believe in
Shri Mataji” - so what?

12:05.330 --> 12:10.588
All right, you believe in me because
of certain experiences - still what?

12:12.056 --> 12:18.924
Mataji should be in your life, should be
in your expression,

12:19.125 --> 12:24.733
in your behaviour, in your treatment
to others,

12:24.934 --> 12:29.231
in understanding each other, and loving
each other.

12:29.432 --> 12:32.298
That is what impresses people.

12:32.499 --> 12:35.446
People say, “All right, we’ll come to
Mataji, we’ll just pray to Her

12:35.647 --> 12:39.200
and go away - we’ll not talk to you.” Why?

12:39.401 --> 12:43.377
“Because we believe in Mataji, finished.”

12:45.277 --> 12:47.998
So now we have to understand that you
believe in Sahaja Yoga,

12:48.199 --> 12:52.810
of course, it is Shraddha (faith), it is
not a blind faith, I agreed,

12:53.011 --> 12:57.221
but still belief has to penetrate into your
being.

12:57.422 --> 13:01.819
This belief has to act, has to show
results,

13:02.020 --> 13:07.805
it has to work out in every way.

13:08.483 --> 13:12.327
Somebody might say that we believe
in Mataji and She does everything -

13:12.528 --> 13:14.889
She’ll do bhakti for us.

13:15.090 --> 13:19.850
I should sit down and sing the song
of Mataji or what.

13:21.063 --> 13:27.390
So what is going to come from your side,
that is what we have to understand;

13:27.591 --> 13:30.929
and once that starts working, then these
demons

13:31.130 --> 13:35.583
and these rakshasas will all vanish,
no problem.

13:35.830 --> 13:40.106
So: “What am I doing for Sahaja Yoga?”

13:40.307 --> 13:43.916
We should ask the question, “What am I
doing?”

13:44.117 --> 13:50.007
Now if you make this instrument, and then
if it is not doing anything,

13:50.215 --> 13:53.983
what is the use of making the instrument?

13:58.617 --> 14:03.237
Now you are the light, you have got
enlightenment:

14:03.702 --> 14:06.642
but what is the use of a light which is
hanging somewhere,

14:06.843 --> 14:10.344
which is not giving light to anyone?

14:12.194 --> 14:18.585
So when you are giving light to others,
in a very innocent manner,

14:18.786 --> 14:23.995
in a very reciprocal manner - not this way
that we are giving light

14:24.196 --> 14:27.283
because we want to have an advantage
over it,

14:27.484 --> 14:32.481
or we want to show off or any all
nonsensical things that are there.

14:32.682 --> 14:34.731
Then the derailment starts.

14:34.932 --> 14:39.170
People start saying, “Oh, I am this,
I am that.”

14:39.901 --> 14:47.135
But with full understanding, that we are
instruments in the hands of the divinity

14:47.336 --> 14:54.043
and we are just enjoying that divinity
flowing through us and working out,

14:54.244 --> 14:56.681
you won’t feel tired, you won’t feel
upset,

14:56.882 --> 15:01.839
you’ll not be in any way in trouble.

15:02.393 --> 15:05.900
But this has happened with you.

15:06.211 --> 15:11.939
You are so matured, but still, we all have
to decide

15:12.140 --> 15:17.163
that now we are going to India to get
ourselves the whole joy of the tour.

15:17.364 --> 15:20.185
But for what?

15:21.657 --> 15:26.198
Not to keep to yourself, but to share it
with others.

15:26.389 --> 15:31.201
This joy is for you to share it with
others.

15:31.402 --> 15:37.148
Unless and until you learn that, your ego
will come back again and again.

15:37.349 --> 15:42.177
And also you have seen the way

15:42.378 --> 15:48.652
people who have been even spreading Sahaja
Yoga got into the mess of ego.

15:48.853 --> 15:54.404
So one has to be very careful. The more
you are rising in your divinity,

15:54.605 --> 15:59.394
the more you are maturing, you have
to be very careful.

15:59.595 --> 16:06.782
See on a tree if you see, if there’s
a leaf, no insect will enter.

16:06.983 --> 16:12.570
If there’s a flower, the insect will come
and it will make it into a fruit.

16:12.771 --> 16:18.851
But when it is a fruit, then the insect
will enter and eat it off.

16:19.052 --> 16:22.244
So when you are becoming a fruit, you have
to be very careful

16:22.445 --> 16:25.438
that no insect should get into you.

16:25.639 --> 16:31.864
On the contrary, now you have [the]
capacity to destroy all the insects.

16:32.072 --> 16:40.097
And that is what is, I would say, is
the state where we should all come up to.

16:40.298 --> 16:42.531
So you are destroying insects on one side

16:42.732 --> 16:46.919
and satisfying people on the other side.

16:47.267 --> 16:53.641
Collectivity is, of course no doubt, is
the only way you can be cleansed;

16:53.842 --> 16:57.328
but the greater thing is to go out,
all out, to find out,

16:57.529 --> 17:00.569
“Where can I spread Sahaja Yoga?
Where can I go?

17:00.770 --> 17:04.812
What is the nearest village I can go?
Where will I work it out?”

17:05.013 --> 17:08.368
All those things the more you think,
the better it is,

17:08.569 --> 17:13.035
and you start moving in that direction.

17:13.236 --> 17:15.784
Once you start moving in that direction,
you will be surprised

17:15.985 --> 17:18.938
Sahaja Yoga will move ahead of you.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.898
You’ll meet the people whom you want,

17:22.099 --> 17:27.194
you’ll get all the necessary help that
you want,

17:27.395 --> 17:30.406
suddenly you’ll find some people who will
come down

17:30.607 --> 17:34.832
and say, “Now, what can we do for you?”

17:35.033 --> 17:40.520
Every type of help starts coming to you
the way you expand yourself.

17:40.721 --> 17:46.220
It’s like the expanding your wings, like
a bird does,

17:46.421 --> 17:53.291
and then you take off. But if you don’t
extend yourself,

17:53.531 --> 17:59.530
you keep Sahaja Yoga to yourself only,
it doesn’t work.

18:00.904 --> 18:04.961
I know you love me very much and you know
I love you very much,

18:05.162 --> 18:11.110
but don’t you think others should also
share this love,

18:11.311 --> 18:14.821
others should also have this?

18:15.022 --> 18:19.760
Now when we start struggling, we also
struggle with people

18:19.961 --> 18:24.968
who are very difficult - like “my brother,
my brother’s son...”

18:25.169 --> 18:31.213
Just don’t go near my, get away.
My is the most difficult thing.

18:31.414 --> 18:35.877
You see, in my family, I don’t touch them

18:36.100 --> 18:38.838
because once you go to my they sit
on your heads,

18:39.039 --> 18:44.608
or maybe they’ll sit on the heads of the
Sahaja Yogis or something, nothing.

18:44.809 --> 18:47.451
So don’t go to the people – “it is
my sister,

18:47.652 --> 18:50.709
she is my sister-in-law”, nothing
of the kind.

18:50.910 --> 18:56.500
What you have to do is to see what is
beyond

18:56.701 --> 19:01.080
and the more you’ll go beyond, the better
it will be.

19:02.708 --> 19:05.653
See, you can see clearly, we’ve worked
so hard in Maharashtra,

19:05.854 --> 19:11.325
it is a useless place I find. Maharashtrian
Sahaja Yogis are few, very few,

19:11.526 --> 19:14.947
but whatever are there are also not
so good.

19:15.148 --> 19:18.959
While Delhi Sahaja Yogis, now here
in Madras, in Bangalore,

19:19.160 --> 19:23.339
see what nice Sahaja Yogis are there.

19:24.549 --> 19:28.098
So much work I have done there.

19:28.299 --> 19:34.529
So those who are very near to you, always
cannot see the greatness of you.

19:34.730 --> 19:40.201
Like if you go near the big mountain, you
cannot see the big mountain,

19:40.402 --> 19:43.395
you have to be away and then you see.
In the same way,

19:43.596 --> 19:46.559
when you want to do some work with anyone,

19:46.760 --> 19:50.002
try to see that you are not closely
related,

19:50.203 --> 19:54.776
nor do you have any connections with them.
Something unknown.

19:54.977 --> 19:58.207
These people are much better for you
to follow

19:58.408 --> 20:03.509
and they will keep your attention tight,
absolutely on you.

20:03.710 --> 20:08.766
Otherwise, the people who are known
to you will trouble you.

20:08.967 --> 20:12.050
Now there are many difficulties in
spreading Sahaja Yoga -

20:12.251 --> 20:18.094
there were many, many more before, slowly
these are coming down.

20:18.295 --> 20:22.464
Naturally, it is much better than at
the time of Thomas [the Apostle]

20:22.665 --> 20:26.690
because he had to hide his treatise
to save it from others.

20:26.891 --> 20:30.070
He thought a day will come when there
will be resurrection time,

20:30.271 --> 20:33.931
then this treatise would be [revealed].
Imagine, only 48 years back,

20:34.132 --> 20:39.507
now it would be around 53 or 50 years
back, it was discovered.

20:41.051 --> 20:46.305
It was not discovered before. He had
to hide it.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.899
But now we are not to hide.

20:49.100 --> 20:54.250
We are to go all out and must know,
must forgive.

20:54.451 --> 20:59.411
That, you see, ours is an open place where
anybody can come in.

20:59.612 --> 21:02.073
So we get all kinds of people - if you go
and meet people,

21:02.274 --> 21:07.893
also there is all kinds of oppositions,
all these things, doesn’t matter.

21:08.094 --> 21:12.477
Everything can be overcome, but first is
your own initiative

21:12.678 --> 21:17.238
and your own lethargy which has to be
overcome.

21:19.852 --> 21:22.004
Then it will start spreading out.

21:22.205 --> 21:25.140
Of course, we have already lot of Sahaja
Yogis -

21:25.341 --> 21:29.243
in Russia, if you see, we have so many,
in thousands.

21:29.444 --> 21:33.602
But in every place we can have lots
of people now

21:33.803 --> 21:38.096
and I’m sure this is a nice year where they
say so, predict

21:38.297 --> 21:41.317
that Sahaja Yoga will grow very much
this year.

21:41.518 --> 21:44.530
So this is the beginning we are starting
today.

21:44.731 --> 21:47.706
I just wanted to tell you that you have
the power,

21:47.930 --> 21:51.680
you have the shakti within your reach.

21:51.881 --> 21:57.254
They said it was very cold one day before
I came here,

21:57.455 --> 22:00.797
I said, “Don’t worry.” I didn’t give
bandhan or anything.

22:00.998 --> 22:06.544
I just came here and how they know!

22:06.745 --> 22:10.943
It’s become all right, you are sitting
in your kurta pyjamas.

22:11.144 --> 22:16.392
Otherwise, you would have been in your
three-piece suits shivering.

22:16.593 --> 22:22.169
That’s how it works. But you have to be
that way dedicated.

22:22.370 --> 22:26.773
Now for all these: Surya [sun] and Chandra
[moon]

22:26.974 --> 22:33.849
and all these stars and the whole cosmos
has only one thing to do -

22:34.050 --> 22:40.211
is to see that Sahaja Yoga is spreading
well,

22:40.412 --> 22:45.627
is settling well and is achieving its goal.

22:47.570 --> 22:50.548
Every element is working it out.

22:50.749 --> 22:55.519
Everything is working - this Paramchaitanya
is working around in so many ways.

22:55.720 --> 22:58.149
You are not to be convinced about me,
I know.

22:58.350 --> 23:00.187
But now you have to be convinced
about yourself

23:00.405 --> 23:04.050
that you have all the powers within you.

23:04.251 --> 23:07.424
I mean, I don’t do anything really, to be
very frank.

23:07.625 --> 23:12.190
If I could do everything, I would not have
had you, I would have done it myself.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.584
But you have to do it - you are my
channels.

23:15.785 --> 23:21.054
You are the channels of Shakti. But do it
in a way which is gracious,

23:21.255 --> 23:25.005
which is beautiful, which is very
satisfying.

23:25.206 --> 23:30.773
Like yesterday, that musician - he just
wanted to entertain you.

23:30.974 --> 23:36.970
He wanted to play. I mean, he was
enjoying it.

23:37.171 --> 23:43.414
In the same way, we should want to do it.
I don’t have to tell you.

23:43.615 --> 23:48.841
And I am sure, in every area that you work,

23:49.042 --> 23:53.176
in every personality whom you meet,

23:53.377 --> 23:56.850
you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga
and tell them.

23:57.051 --> 24:00.440
It works. It acts.

24:00.641 --> 24:05.755
Moreover, it is behind you the whole power
of all the deities,

24:05.956 --> 24:10.004
and in front is Sahaja Yoga running
forward fast, this Paramchaitanya:

24:10.205 --> 24:12.496
“Now the Sahaja Yogis are coming,
all right,

24:12.697 --> 24:18.383
let them not eat their food, finished” -
organising.

24:18.637 --> 24:22.561
Everything so beautifully done. Now
see the arrangements and all -

24:22.776 --> 24:28.261
I mean, I was thinking such few people
here, and about 20 Sahaja Yogis in Madras -

24:28.462 --> 24:32.690
can you believe it, all this arrangement?

24:33.479 --> 24:41.217
How it’s working out, how it is giving
results, it’s really remarkable.

24:42.265 --> 24:47.189
So have faith in yourself, have faith
in all of them helping you,

24:47.390 --> 24:50.609
not to be nervous and just go ahead.

24:50.810 --> 24:55.415
Because the shakti is in you. You have
the power.

24:55.616 --> 24:59.644
Every kind of power you have, I assure
you, you have every power.

24:59.815 --> 25:01.844
Ask for it and you’ll
have it.

25:02.045 --> 25:04.577
Whatever you ask for it, it will happen.

25:04.778 --> 25:12.044
But don’t hesitate. As I said the other
day, that I make you sit on the throne,

25:12.245 --> 25:16.090
then also I put the crown on your head.

25:16.291 --> 25:23.222
And also I say, “Now you are the king,”
but still you are running away

25:23.423 --> 25:26.692
and not believing me - looking this side
with fear –

25:26.893 --> 25:30.043
“Am I a king really? How can I be?”

25:30.244 --> 25:34.417
That’s not the way. Have faith in yourself.

25:34.618 --> 25:38.564
I am very happy you all have come here.

25:38.765 --> 25:42.239
We are trying to do whatever is possible

25:42.440 --> 25:48.972
to make you comfortable and for you
to provide whatever is necessary.

25:49.173 --> 25:53.806
Of course, you are only just Spirits

25:54.007 --> 25:58.222
and you try to find the comfort of your
Spirit.

25:58.423 --> 26:03.417
I know that you are very adjusting
yourself.

26:03.872 --> 26:07.096
Everybody is surprised how you people
from the West -

26:07.297 --> 26:13.358
who just believe in materialism - can take
to Sahaja Yoga: they are quite surprised.

26:14.807 --> 26:20.516
But you are all very sweet people,

26:20.717 --> 26:27.469
I think, something very special who have
come to Sahaja Yoga.

26:28.749 --> 26:34.319
And by God’s grace, I’m sure

26:34.526 --> 26:38.943
you will be the people who will be
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga

26:39.144 --> 26:49.612
and you will build the great mansion
of Sahaja Yoga

26:49.977 --> 26:58.269
with your wisdom, faith, shakti and love.

26:58.470 --> 27:04.620
Today we’ll worship the Shakti - it’s very
much needed -

27:04.821 --> 27:10.050
the Shakti who destroyed all the devils,
all the rakshasas.

27:10.251 --> 27:16.518
That is what we are going to worship
today - the Shakti within you and without.

27:16.719 --> 27:19.786
It’s your desire which is going to work.

27:19.987 --> 27:25.247
So today we are going to worship
the Shakti itself - Mahakali.

27:25.448 --> 27:28.550
May God bless you.

27:41.811 --> 27:45.785
So, today first we’ll have the washing
of Feet

27:46.043 --> 27:49.743
and with that we’ll have (Hindi)

27:53.807 --> 27:57.360
one Atharva Shirsha we’ll do

27:57.561 --> 28:02.120
and then we can have thousand names,

28:05.288 --> 28:14.872
which are made very easily compiled
together

28:15.094 --> 28:18.389
by the Noida people, which you can sing.

28:18.590 --> 28:22.799
That’s how we can worship the Shakti.
