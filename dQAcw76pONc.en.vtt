WEBVTT

16:16.402 --> 16:21.917
Today is very bigger day for us,
also 'vasant panchami' is there

16:22.878 --> 16:26.567
Again it's national day today

16:26.935 --> 16:31.432
The people are grateful to see this day

16:31.814 --> 16:34.567
How many people had abandoned their life?.

16:35.436 --> 16:41.936
How many things have happened,
but we have not yet come to that stage.

16:42.146 --> 16:49.739
Where you know this,Yes,
the country is of great

16:49.764 --> 16:56.247
importance,People have
won the sacrifice.

16:56.272 --> 17:00.836
Even when we called up
the rebellion in this

17:00.861 --> 17:06.041
country, Gandhiji thought
that this country's

17:08.117 --> 17:11.763
That which is real wealth,
it is spiritual.

17:11.738 --> 17:15.485
Self-power is not violent
but non-violence, and

17:15.510 --> 17:19.256
therefore they will make
all over non-violence.

17:19.753 --> 17:23.503
We have won the country for
without any violence

17:23.760 --> 17:27.708
When this happened,
we do not realize that

17:27.733 --> 17:31.534
Now this is what we have
earned so much wealth,

17:32.122 --> 17:35.880
Yes, that's what we keep,
Yes, you has got diamonds

17:35.898 --> 17:38.642
In Which sacrifice to fit?

17:38.937 --> 17:44.737
So that's what it's sacrificing
They must be of this soil

17:44.554 --> 17:51.556
Whatever the sacrifice of this soil,
They have sacrificed themselves.

17:51.497 --> 17:53.244
You have nothing else to do.

17:53.244 --> 17:56.070
What is the main thing in
this country,that is, all the

17:56.095 --> 17:58.745
space that is the element,the
power of self, it is..

17:58.745 --> 18:03.246
That should be discarded on self-power.

18:03.246 --> 18:08.157
As long as the sacrifice of independence
will not be put on self-centeredness,

18:08.401 --> 18:10.056
The welfare of this country will not be there

18:10.409 --> 18:16.053
But for that, we should create such a people,
which has received this self-discipline.

18:16.177 --> 18:22.677
But I still see that the people that got self-conscious
Who has gained self-confidence

18:23.046 --> 18:31.946
They are still playing very tightly and
are living with a very frantic situation.

18:32.413 --> 18:37.669
The kind of thing that has happened to
me is so troubled me yesterday

18:37.404 --> 18:41.652
I have decided that I do not want to
talk about that anymore.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.627
Relations,How did it come?

18:45.627 --> 18:48.875
We say relation come in Maharashtra.

18:48.875 --> 18:52.127
Brothers kill you after one another

18:52.127 --> 18:55.381
Something bothered, what happened to it?

18:55.746 --> 18:58.249
That's because we took addiction.

18:58.742 --> 19:01.318
You might be surprised if
you add some additives to

19:01.343 --> 19:03.994
Vishuddhi chakra,
you do not have any kind of wisdom.

19:03.994 --> 19:05.903
He does not live nicely.

19:05.903 --> 19:11.904
He lied and did not think he had
missed anything even though he did

19:11.904 --> 19:17.657
This addiction has grown so much in
our country and it's on such a large scale,

19:17.657 --> 19:22.156
People do not notice that they are suffering,

19:23.154 --> 19:25.659
People say so many lies about.

19:25.659 --> 19:27.906
They are behaving so badly.

19:27.906 --> 19:30.907
And so much lies are in the world

19:30.907 --> 19:33.407
Yes, for the first time
to get rid of falsehood,

19:33.432 --> 19:35.652
first of all should be
left with addiction.

19:35.476 --> 19:39.972
The man who does not completely forget to addiction,
His nature will not be good.

19:39.972 --> 19:48.472
He will do falsehood, he will do a false thing
and everything that is true will be false

19:48.472 --> 19:53.973
So one day on this big day many
people spend their lives

19:53.973 --> 19:55.559
Many gave life

19:55.924 --> 19:58.124
Many have shed their blood

19:57.806 --> 20:05.698
From this time immemorial, we struggled for independence,
now for self-rule, to self-help

20:06.075 --> 20:10.284
People today pledge that we will
not do any addiction anymore

20:10.284 --> 20:11.285
Any kind

20:11.783 --> 20:13.283
This is not a difficult task

20:13.784 --> 20:17.035
I see people from foreign countries
that they are so sharp

20:17.035 --> 20:21.036
Once that is achieved, on the next day
it becomes free, by leaving everything,

20:21.036 --> 20:23.790
That was not what they were

20:24.532 --> 20:28.293
As soon as a lotus comes up in a moment,
it gets so much sweeter

20:28.293 --> 20:30.287
But not in our country.

20:30.287 --> 20:33.034
There are some types of activities in our country

20:33.265 --> 20:34.664
But this is the only way,
It's gonna be there.

20:34.664 --> 20:39.665
For ten ten years, peoples in sahajayoga
Why not make some progress?

20:39.665 --> 20:44.164
The reason is that they have not been
able to relieve themselves of addiction.

20:44.918 --> 20:46.663
This slavery should gone

20:46.663 --> 20:48.630
The slaughter of addiction is that it should go.

20:49.128 --> 20:52.124
The second guru's slavery is very terrible to you

20:52.374 --> 20:54.627
I met a gentleman yesterday

20:54.876 --> 20:56.374
They were so many years in sahajayoga.

20:56.374 --> 20:58.629
But his master's slavery is not gone

20:58.629 --> 21:00.627
So they are still in trouble.

21:00.875 --> 21:02.377
There is no one listening to these things

21:02.377 --> 21:03.884
Nobody would believe it.

21:03.884 --> 21:10.373
But if your guru is wrong, then you have
seen that you are suffering from it

21:11.122 --> 21:12.881
This slavery,
Should have gone

21:12.881 --> 21:18.135
You should keep in mind that for slavery,
People who come from Guru.

21:17.976 --> 21:20.224
They are physically afflicted

21:20.224 --> 21:26.473
If your master can not keep your body properly,
then why should such a guru be enslaved?

21:26.977 --> 21:29.478
This is superstition and it is a vengeful sign.

21:29.582 --> 21:34.589
In the vengeful symptom, Shrikrishna said,
that when a person becomes vengeful

21:34.589 --> 21:38.088
Then some unfixed things are
pulled up completely

21:38.088 --> 21:41.085
That condition only believes the truth

21:43.582 --> 21:49.087
Suppose,one bull tie to the oil extractor poll
and put scarp on eyes,He is wandering in there

21:49.087 --> 21:53.186
And no matter how much you told him
that he is wrong, he does not think so

21:53.186 --> 21:54.685
It do not go into his head

21:55.689 --> 21:58.938
This vengeful tendency is
especially in our Maharashtra.

21:58.938 --> 22:02.436
The reason we tell him the reason
is that we are very addicted

22:02.436 --> 22:06.936
And the fundamentalists, in those days
we have grown up in the customs,

22:06.936 --> 22:09.576
You never stop that fundamental.

22:10.074 --> 22:14.949
Now first of all, see that you should fast now

22:15.694 --> 22:17.312
Who said that? Which scripture?

22:17.312 --> 22:19.316
If no one says so, no one can show.

22:20.065 --> 22:22.784
If you have a passion to fast anytime.

22:22.784 --> 22:26.907
So whoever you wish about will be the same.

22:27.534 --> 22:30.656
People in our country are also starving

22:32.159 --> 22:36.653
Why should I fast even more,
I do not understand,

22:36.908 --> 22:40.049
If you would like to fast,then die

22:40.049 --> 22:44.413
It seems like the future will be hungry,
want fasting, take it.

22:46.665 --> 22:48.413
You should only get
what you are interested in.

22:48.413 --> 22:52.752
When you fast,
Then let it be hungry

22:53.003 --> 22:54.755
Then why cry?

22:55.007 --> 22:59.021
Everything is for eat and they
do not want to eat it in the name of God

22:59.021 --> 23:02.025
You should not eat it,
but eat it in the name of God

23:02.273 --> 23:05.524
Next is the path of devotion,
the path of devotion has drawn one

23:05.524 --> 23:08.016
But that's not the way it's going to be

23:08.016 --> 23:09.266
It should be noted

23:10.273 --> 23:14.136
devotion, exclusive devotion is told by Krishna

23:14.384 --> 23:20.637
The path of devotion is to sit on the ground,
to walk away from it

23:21.103 --> 23:23.385
Dress clothes, like beggar

23:23.606 --> 23:27.841
Going there playing the Manjeera,
And to break the head

23:28.095 --> 23:28.967
That is called the devotional path

23:28.967 --> 23:31.463
Who said this?

23:33.966 --> 23:41.837
Dnyaneshwar did not say that you used to go to
perform 'Hare Rama' Hare, doing there.

23:41.837 --> 23:45.585
Or do we say Vitthal Vitthal
by doing Krishna Krishna

23:45.585 --> 23:47.838
So do not go anywhere

23:50.836 --> 23:53.194
Those who wrote it did not read

23:53.194 --> 23:55.692
They did not understand
what they explained

23:55.692 --> 24:01.567
Now it is said that, 'Aata Vishwatmake...Toshawe'.

24:01.567 --> 24:05.322
He should show the spirit of the universe

24:05.322 --> 24:07.810
He should be happy

24:07.805 --> 24:13.215
Whatever sacrifice has been offered to me,
Let's be satisfied

24:13.571 --> 24:17.576
And then what to give?
Give it to Pasaydan

24:18.444 --> 24:20.198
This pasaydaan is given to you.

24:21.695 --> 24:24.694
This is what the vibrations have been
given to youvthis is pasaydaan.

24:26.695 --> 24:29.695
The dark darkness of sinful man
disappeared,did gone?

24:30.403 --> 24:33.653
Those who played majeera,
Does ignorance go?

24:34.153 --> 24:39.906
Too dry, dried, beggar
they do not have proper clothes on body.

24:40.405 --> 24:43.653
Seeing the person coming to cry
Where did the sinful man come from?

24:43.653 --> 24:47.293
And say we are devotees of Shri hari !

24:48.146 --> 24:56.143
Hey, who gave Sudama to Dwarka,
this devotee, this beggar people

24:57.894 --> 25:00.875
Why are you people defaming Krishna?

25:00.875 --> 25:04.873
Be a devotee of another person,Fraud Babaji's

25:04.873 --> 25:09.124
Whose rinkle should be counted,
This type of Babaji are many

25:09.872 --> 25:11.624
Devote them.

25:11.871 --> 25:14.262
But why do you defame Shrikrishna?

25:14.512 --> 25:17.762
Where did you not read the
description of their face?

25:18.516 --> 25:21.011
Did not read the description of his brilliance?

25:21.011 --> 25:24.512
Where he was a beggar, nobody told.

25:24.512 --> 25:30.263
Even though cows maintained,
the crown was on the head.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.752
We have already heard of it ,
about dress up

25:32.752 --> 25:36.993
Where did you hear that he was
carrying a bush in his hands beggar ?

25:36.993 --> 25:39.462
Tobacco filled in drink

25:44.462 --> 25:45.483
This is our condition

25:45.483 --> 25:50.383
But do not think about it,
And black ash on the head

25:50.634 --> 25:53.134
does he apply black ash on head

25:54.382 --> 25:59.382
How pretty even,Turns the sandal on the head

25:59.631 --> 26:07.432
That was his sign,even if you look around,
why do you walk around with black ash?

26:07.432 --> 26:09.818
With those black ashes,
it will ruin your ajnya chakra.

26:09.843 --> 26:13.681
The more you will be in a vengeful perspective.

26:15.846 --> 26:19.094
But you said that Mataji,
why do you say so?

26:19.671 --> 26:23.672
That is what they want me to tell
and it should tell you

26:23.672 --> 26:25.962
Then you got the disease
tomorrow, there were cancerous

26:25.987 --> 26:28.171
diseases, there were diseases
of the vishudhhi chakra

26:28.171 --> 26:31.672
Diseases like this,The disease happened
That is to say,Mataji what's this?

26:31.672 --> 26:37.313
We are Warkaris(devotee),
that is to blame in God

26:37.816 --> 26:40.312
This vengeful tendency should have gone

26:40.312 --> 26:44.303
Walk through the scarf on the eye.
We are in the path of devotion

26:44.303 --> 26:46.773
Hey, what's the way?

26:47.522 --> 26:49.775
God has said, Make exclusive devotion

26:49.775 --> 26:52.322
Krishna has explained it
clearly,That you will give

26:52.347 --> 26:54.772
me something,pamphlet,
fruit, and he will take it

26:54.772 --> 26:58.025
But giving it clear that you should
give exclusive devotion

26:58.025 --> 27:00.522
What else could he do?

27:01.023 --> 27:02.522
When will exclusive devotion be?

27:02.522 --> 27:06.002
When you walk aloud with God

27:06.252 --> 27:08.047
When you feel confident

27:08.047 --> 27:11.257
Whenever you worship him,
it has something meaning

27:12.254 --> 27:15.244
We have such an evil
reputation of Krishna everywhere

27:15.244 --> 27:18.242
Are doing abroad,
doing so here too.

27:18.492 --> 27:22.744
Where is Lord Krishna and
where are the people of Warakari(devotee).

27:23.045 --> 27:25.969
I do not see the compilation of the two

27:30.297 --> 27:38.046
So, whatever we are old, we want
to get the best, best of them

27:38.046 --> 27:41.293
And that which has been imposed on us,
it should be left

27:41.293 --> 27:45.301
In the Sahajayoga,
we are doing great devotion

27:45.793 --> 27:49.216
Everything happens,
but only after self-realization

27:49.216 --> 27:51.016
Before that we did not do it.

27:51.266 --> 27:53.767
Secondly, fasting is not what we do

27:53.767 --> 27:57.019
If you want to fast,then do it,
Now I am fasting already

27:57.762 --> 28:01.762
I Forever Fasting is done by your grace

28:01.762 --> 28:04.763
No lunch, no meal in the evening

28:04.763 --> 28:06.516
Something is going on

28:06.516 --> 28:09.514
If you do not want me to
fast then I can do it

28:09.514 --> 28:14.019
But even if you want to do it,
you can do it for yourself or for your body

28:14.766 --> 28:17.264
But do not tell it as a stomach disorder

28:18.516 --> 28:23.018
So we need to understand that
we are going to be vigilant,

28:23.018 --> 28:26.265
Now we do not want to
go to the royal state

28:26.265 --> 28:29.767
This peopole is other
it is of a political nature.

28:29.767 --> 28:34.477
What they did not know,
what was wrong and what was good

28:34.477 --> 28:36.479
The mistake and the good one at all

28:36.726 --> 28:39.227
That is, we feel that these
people are human or animals !

28:39.227 --> 28:45.477
They do not understand this, that
they eat cabbage, that they eat shit

28:45.477 --> 28:49.477
He also does not understand the difference,
People are royaltyers

28:49.723 --> 28:54.725
And if this state of the state came,
But a big question arises in him

28:54.725 --> 28:59.229
Because such people are
confused and completely confused

28:59.229 --> 29:01.299
So do not understand what
they want to explain

29:01.299 --> 29:04.295
So everyone thinks,
what's wrong with this?

29:04.295 --> 29:09.171
Now here London is a new one,
Exiting daily.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.667
Now there's a new one

29:10.667 --> 29:16.666
The new one happened for four years,
That needle socks into your mouth

29:17.936 --> 29:24.374
If not, then insert the pin
And paint the hair and go out.

29:24.723 --> 29:29.375
I said, why do this? they said,
So what's wrong with this?

29:29.375 --> 29:34.123
What's wrong with this?
Does we have any answer?

29:38.514 --> 29:40.767
So they do such foolishness

29:41.106 --> 29:44.856
It does not matter if you say
anything to that stupidity

29:44.856 --> 29:46.853
Because they think, we all know

29:46.853 --> 29:47.608
What's wrong or bad?

29:47.608 --> 29:49.095
What do you say?

29:49.095 --> 29:52.180
That is, the monsters are
good, the evil is also good,

29:52.205 --> 29:55.121
the thief one is good and
the Mahatma is also good.

29:55.345 --> 29:58.592
And God is good. Everything is good,
all are same.

29:58.849 --> 30:02.093
Hitler is good and krushna is also good.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.735
There is no difference between them

30:03.735 --> 30:05.734
No one should say bad .all good

30:05.734 --> 30:07.731
There is nothing bad to say

30:07.731 --> 30:09.486
This was the stage of royalness

30:09.486 --> 30:11.486
You now have the royal nature

30:11.486 --> 30:14.235
Because you are making progress now

30:14.235 --> 30:15.987
Due to the progressive country you are

30:15.987 --> 30:19.736
Now there is a humble request that
you should not progress there

30:19.736 --> 30:22.739
Now we have to make such progress right now

30:22.739 --> 30:26.690
She wants to progress
through the Crown Chakra and

30:26.715 --> 30:30.511
That is to make progress
in the higher direction

30:30.985 --> 30:33.737
For This,What's wrong with this?
What's wrong with him?

30:33.961 --> 30:35.452
Why do this?
why do that?

30:35.452 --> 30:38.459
If that desire were to happen, we would have
thought that we became a royal

30:38.459 --> 30:40.956
It's worse than vengeful.

30:42.707 --> 30:46.483
Because once you can remove
bond,But by the way, From the

30:46.508 --> 30:50.479
point of view, the restriction on the
eye, how to remove it?

30:52.453 --> 30:54.205
So,do not go to that situation.

30:54.205 --> 30:56.203
What's wrong with this
What's wrong in him

30:56.203 --> 30:58.953
You are your master in Sahajayoga.

30:58.953 --> 31:03.460
Vibrations come in your hands and
you know what's wrong with you

31:03.460 --> 31:05.143
Then,Fix Your Vibrations.

31:05.143 --> 31:08.405
But there is a situation
where people do not understand

31:08.430 --> 31:11.166
anything, whether we
have lost anything or not

31:11.650 --> 31:15.649
This situation should not occur

31:16.143 --> 31:18.648
That is my request by adding my hands

31:18.897 --> 31:25.901
Today, in this good news, we all have to tell
you that you are born in this holy soil.

31:26.397 --> 31:29.899
I now go to Coimbatore day before yesterday,
they said that you will live in Pune now ?

31:29.899 --> 31:31.648
It is said to be punyapattanum.

31:31.648 --> 31:33.645
All said by adding their hands

31:33.746 --> 31:44.648
Said, 'Why?'
... now you see it all

31:44.899 --> 31:48.395
This is what they were .it was
what they were described

31:50.646 --> 31:58.476
This story tells us that once Pundarikaksh
took his father and mother

31:58.476 --> 32:00.895
Came to Mumbai city.
Maybe even Pune has come

32:00.895 --> 32:02.646
There is a story about Pune.
Do not know if there will be any.

32:03.143 --> 32:06.645
He said to them,
'I'm not taking you anywhere now.

32:06.645 --> 32:08.588
I have served you very much

32:09.084 --> 32:11.334
Now,I'm not going to take you forward
Go where you want

32:11.334 --> 32:17.709
I am not doing your pilgrimage anymore.
He thought, saw the vaibrations and said

32:17.709 --> 32:19.455
That's it, do it

32:19.455 --> 32:23.205
You take us out of here anyhow

32:23.454 --> 32:29.207
Then do what you want to do,
As he picked it out of that village, he came to notice

32:29.207 --> 32:32.206
That's how much is my fault,
He said, forgive me

32:32.206 --> 32:33.457
Something happened to me

32:33.457 --> 32:38.956
No, no, I take you away,
Well, I think this often in Pune

32:38.956 --> 32:40.452
Mumbai has so much

32:40.453 --> 32:46.953
But now people should decide that,
to pune

32:46.953 --> 32:52.457
Which Graduation is given from Anadikal
The great saints, great masters

32:52.457 --> 32:55.705
will celebrate and will do it well

32:55.834 --> 32:59.936
Today,All of this should be decided in
the mind of the people of Pune

32:59.936 --> 33:06.185
That's the name of Pune, that's such a great name,
we get such a great principle

33:06.185 --> 33:07.437
what others do?

33:07.674 --> 33:12.178
Others do this,Others do thieves, they do this,
do not want to see others. Others Others

33:12.555 --> 33:13.761
You are ours.

33:13.920 --> 33:22.297
What attitude do we leave,Except for small attitude,
we can absorb big ideas

33:22.754 --> 33:26.754
Secondly, we have the biggest problem
in religion

33:27.433 --> 33:29.528
Today,have to say about that also

33:29.917 --> 33:35.905
It is written by Markandey Swaamy about
the idea of ​​caste from Anadikal

33:35.990 --> 33:37.732
Which is called as consciousness
in all the beings of the

33:37.757 --> 33:39.625
Goddess The Goddesses who are
situated in power in all castes,

33:39.625 --> 33:42.447
That's what we say every day,
But why we dont understand?

33:42.670 --> 33:46.297
Means,Whats goddess cast,
that is our cast

33:46.297 --> 33:49.868
Mahakali, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati are
only three caste in this world

33:49.868 --> 33:53.382
And the fourth caste is Aadishakti's,
that's your caste.

33:53.719 --> 33:55.187
It's Beyond that

33:55.553 --> 33:59.754
Those who are passionate,
their cast of Mahakali's

33:59.886 --> 34:04.226
Mahasaraswati's caste for
those who are of Royal

34:04.385 --> 34:07.401
Those who are righteous,
their castes are Mahalakshmi

34:07.480 --> 34:11.807
There are three castes in this
way and the fourth which is

34:11.832 --> 34:16.012
going on is beyond the castes,
that is to say,Trigunatit

34:16.750 --> 34:19.283
In this situation you are sitting today

34:19.372 --> 34:22.438
So do not fight on castes

34:22.454 --> 34:26.918
We are this,we are that,this,that,
Those who really do not really do anything

34:28.013 --> 34:32.407
With such a brawl,then we say that
why we have given the kingdom to them?

34:32.439 --> 34:34.001
Means Shivaji was
kunabi(lower cast)

34:34.026 --> 34:35.560
Why did give the kingdom?

34:35.566 --> 34:36.736
There are many people who say so

34:37.062 --> 34:42.252
Now who is sitting on your kingdom?
Parsi is a man coming and sitting,Tell him

34:42.427 --> 34:50.085
Came all Brahmins and say.tell,
They become friendly with all

34:50.210 --> 34:52.590
That man is good
But its meaning

34:52.599 --> 34:58.794
Who has said that?Even if Shivaji Maharaj is in situation,
you give him trouble

34:59.366 --> 35:04.224
also told Gandhi ji that you
make atonement at Nashik

35:04.629 --> 35:09.010
You make atonement,
from such a great man

35:09.478 --> 35:13.029
I once said to Mahatmaji,
'Why do you go to make atonement?

35:13.078 --> 35:16.474
He said,If I did not go,
they would've shot mi

35:17.299 --> 35:19.299
Whom did you give up?

35:20.093 --> 35:25.416
You must remove people from that class,
and this is the idea that you have

35:25.496 --> 35:28.258
That is, showing others down in religion

35:30.131 --> 35:35.404
Every time that big people were there
Everyone in this country tried this

35:35.468 --> 35:39.373
That people should remove
this idea from their minds

35:39.492 --> 35:41.809
eknath feeds water to donkey.

35:42.214 --> 35:44.054
Naamdev was a tailor.

35:44.849 --> 35:47.253
We had a gentleman butcher

35:47.293 --> 35:49.160
He is considered to be a saint.

35:49.244 --> 35:51.687
Tukaram also always used
to say that If I had

35:51.712 --> 35:55.575
become a Mahar(lower Caste),
it will good for mi

35:55.982 --> 36:01.509
Why this?That is, they are often told that
this madness of caste should be gone

36:02.226 --> 36:03.987
And so many miracles happened

36:04.105 --> 36:07.023
Their Volume came out in the Indrayani(river)
which was immersed, all happened

36:07.047 --> 36:09.198
But people have not understand that

36:09.214 --> 36:12.875
The thing which is holy is different,
the fight between castes is different

36:13.055 --> 36:15.962
They will not learn because
the eyes are close

36:16.882 --> 36:20.152
So this kind of caste does not work for us,
We do not want that kind of caste

36:20.232 --> 36:22.756
We will not do this,
we will not do that

36:25.430 --> 36:30.493
Such people who speak,
And in this way the people who spread the atmosphere

36:30.652 --> 36:32.919
There was a defect only in our country

36:33.086 --> 36:36.372
Well, it still needs to be done in practical terms

36:36.467 --> 36:39.535
that,some caste boy married with another caste girl

36:39.710 --> 36:45.249
There is no difference between them
and this kind of marriage, but they have advantages

36:45.583 --> 36:49.817
Suppose,If you married in your caste
and did Maratha in Marathas

36:50.547 --> 36:53.666
So, he has not sent anything to Diwali.

36:54.071 --> 36:58.952
How much did dowry?To talk properly,
How much did dowry?

36:59.366 --> 37:03.444
I want to get married,
then the girl should be the same

37:03.707 --> 37:08.101
If someone tricks her,
then who will come from the community?

37:08.586 --> 37:10.715
f you send the girl home,
if didnt give dowry,, But at

37:10.740 --> 37:12.752
that time can someone is
standing in the community?

37:13.086 --> 37:18.411
Dies For such castes,
oppressed people torture their girls

37:18.546 --> 37:22.602
Not only that, I feel that one of
those media is atrocity.

37:22.848 --> 37:25.520
The girls used to abuse and
torture to them

37:25.526 --> 37:29.005
It must be married in this caste,
This is a medium

37:29.235 --> 37:31.822
It is a medium to
persecute those girls

37:32.164 --> 37:37.284
We are harassing ourselves,
our own, our girls every day.

37:38.324 --> 37:44.057
If another son got good,If you got good in
the others caste, then what is the problem?

37:44.134 --> 37:46.872
What should be the problem,
there is no objection

37:47.253 --> 37:48.386
But it does not look like that

37:48.816 --> 37:50.416
It is not so practical

37:50.562 --> 37:55.473
But tomorrow in that caste left our
daughter, So that being helps you

37:55.492 --> 38:00.155
Even when it appeared front of us,
we got married in our own caste only.

38:01.853 --> 38:03.662
Stubbornness like this

38:04.011 --> 38:08.154
That is,You really have
something radish on girls head

38:10.081 --> 38:11.628
We're putting a lot of weight

38:11.756 --> 38:15.093
If you want to, you can do it in
your caste If you want,return it.

38:15.307 --> 38:17.823
But why do you bother that girl

38:18.212 --> 38:21.657
Troubled her
tomorrow,mother-in-law troubled her

38:21.765 --> 38:24.233
You do not go and say
that we married in a caste

38:24.297 --> 38:27.521
n it you will have a reputation for
being 'we married in our caste'

38:27.545 --> 38:29.640
What are you going to get?

38:30.113 --> 38:31.580
Why do you get?

38:33.586 --> 38:35.186
It is special in womens

38:35.582 --> 38:37.102
That should be in our caste

38:37.135 --> 38:41.674
So you have to showoff something after
that What you get? i do not understand.

38:42.436 --> 38:44.190
Gandhiji tried.

38:44.475 --> 38:47.008
Tilak made efforts before Gandhiji

38:47.196 --> 38:49.329
Tilak married widow himself

38:50.680 --> 38:51.958
Agarkar did

38:52.029 --> 38:57.108
How many people have tried,
but we have not fulfilled that effort

38:57.656 --> 39:02.846
Now, when it comes back to sahajayoga,
do not have to do things like casteism

39:03.089 --> 39:05.215
We do not believe in caste.

39:05.287 --> 39:08.573
We consider only cast.
that is sahajayoga.

39:08.676 --> 39:12.056
Sahajaogya is the story of World religions

39:13.064 --> 39:18.079
This is a world religion and there
is nothing like casteism, hatred etc.

39:18.167 --> 39:22.440
A single God and all the
people of mankind he created

39:22.520 --> 39:26.155
Those who have achieved God now,
when they enter the kingdom of God

39:26.235 --> 39:28.028
Do not take it there,
mad people from here.

39:28.402 --> 39:31.025
bawannakuli(caste) and this and that

39:32.525 --> 39:42.772
A gentleman said to me,caste(kul) .talk about
caste mataji, i said ..caste..you have a big.

39:43.174 --> 39:44.784
caste come from where ?

39:44.825 --> 39:47.869
Who is your goddess, from there

39:48.132 --> 39:50.199
That is, the goddess came back or not.

39:51.036 --> 39:52.236
Which is your kul(caste)?

39:52.290 --> 39:56.846
If we are of any caste,
our Goddess may be one.

39:57.005 --> 39:58.869
Suppose someone's goddess is Jagadamba.

39:59.131 --> 40:05.112
hen it can be of a goldsmith or a Brahmin.
it can be Maratha's, anyone can be.

40:05.160 --> 40:07.659
That is, whether their caste
is for Jagdamba or not.

40:07.700 --> 40:09.977
That is, the kul(caste) became Jagdamba's

40:10.271 --> 40:14.120
We have Kul(caste) from the Goddess

40:14.549 --> 40:16.191
Not from the God

40:16.517 --> 40:20.584
That is, the identity of the kul(caste)
is known on mother, and it is also true

40:21.427 --> 40:26.228
Thats why we say 'ya devi
sarvabhuteshu,jatiru pen sansthita'

40:26.308 --> 40:28.586
It's your caste,
This is your caste of greatness

40:28.845 --> 40:31.154
Now I ask what is
the kul(caste) of Shivaji?

40:31.678 --> 40:32.805
No one can tell.

40:32.867 --> 40:35.592
One might say, Jagadamba,
someone would say, Bhavani

40:35.663 --> 40:37.140
Bhavani was his mother.

40:37.434 --> 40:38.601
They have a kantyayani.

40:38.688 --> 40:40.291
kantyayani was his kul(caste).

40:40.625 --> 40:42.394
kantyayani was his
goddess kul(caste).

40:42.807 --> 40:45.300
Now, whether it is the Casteism of
their caste or not, do not know

40:45.371 --> 40:46.841
this is Casteism.

40:46.936 --> 40:47.856
This is kul(caste).

40:47.928 --> 40:49.158
This is the greatness of kul(caste).

40:49.174 --> 40:53.656
To get something done,that we are this
much kul(cast) and that much kul(caste)

40:53.680 --> 40:54.997
Type something that does not look like

40:55.045 --> 40:56.846
All will come together in drinking alcohol.

40:56.910 --> 40:59.644
If everyone wants to drink alcohol,
then they all sit together and drink.

40:59.676 --> 41:01.596
Same place

41:01.652 --> 41:05.588
When drinking,So what
do we drink alcohol?

41:05.716 --> 41:09.898
But at the time of drinking water,
we wear holy clothes.

41:13.634 --> 41:15.380
Even if you want to have cigarettes

41:15.425 --> 41:18.225
If you have half your
remaining thas is also fine

41:19.809 --> 41:24.233
But at the time of meal, however,
we are very considerate of others.

41:24.884 --> 41:27.637
That is, if you want to
work in a bad way, you want

41:27.662 --> 41:30.308
to make a thief,can anyone
ask what's your caste?

41:30.548 --> 41:34.111
When stolen, they form a team

41:34.183 --> 41:37.119
When all kind of people steal together

41:37.238 --> 41:38.557
ame is politics

41:38.674 --> 41:42.626
Nobody in politics thinks
that, what is your caste?

41:42.690 --> 41:45.634
When all bad people come
together that means politics.

41:47.182 --> 41:49.719
But you have to find out
how much you are really bad

41:49.982 --> 41:52.124
Very bad people

41:52.172 --> 41:55.410
So this is ours,
just got it right with us.

41:59.519 --> 42:05.319
This is the situation today that
you have nothing about yourself

42:05.623 --> 42:08.817
There is no self respect,Because
if there is no demonstration

42:08.842 --> 42:11.314
of self, then self respect
can come from where?

42:11.877 --> 42:15.371
It is worthless to say
that things are worthless

42:15.696 --> 42:17.783
Those things have become so important

42:18.181 --> 42:20.252
There is no attention
to the real things.

42:20.363 --> 42:21.585
It's a vengeful symptom

42:22.537 --> 42:26.637
And this vengeful sign should go through
you, so you have tried your best.

42:27.260 --> 42:32.661
The vengeful person does not
have any respect for himselfo.

42:33.138 --> 42:34.702
He does not think about himself.

42:34.877 --> 42:39.277
I have some self-respect or
should I have some self-respect

42:39.607 --> 42:41.178
And his whispering all time

42:41.425 --> 42:43.805
whispering about him,
whispering about them

42:44.131 --> 42:47.448
Something slayess,
which is called in English,like he did

42:47.781 --> 42:50.027
From here and
there,his whispering

42:50.218 --> 42:51.218
slayess

42:51.830 --> 42:55.377
Likewise,
the royal man is a terror but open

42:55.481 --> 42:58.647
Openly,
the two ,four will slap you

42:58.679 --> 43:03.546
If someone gave him two or four, he would
give two-four back, but he would openly

43:03.958 --> 43:05.189
his all apparent

43:05.197 --> 43:06.332
That is so much that .....

43:06.364 --> 43:08.578
It is open to sin,
what is bad in it?

43:08.808 --> 43:10.808
What is worse than doing it?

43:11.006 --> 43:12.878
What's wrong with that?.
say this

43:13.178 --> 43:15.725
If you want to do anything,
then there is no such thing in it

43:15.750 --> 43:18.416
In all things,
what is wrong with it.

43:18.620 --> 43:21.509
The other is ashamed to see them.
It is a condition

43:22.362 --> 43:25.218
So what is your
situation, That you know

43:25.266 --> 43:27.195
Know what is your cast

43:27.386 --> 43:31.284
And any caste has been
exhausted, means you Drowned.

43:31.657 --> 43:36.617
Then it should be multiplied
beyond this species

43:37.379 --> 43:44.343
It should be done in a multiply. And you
must be self-confident in that situation

43:44.756 --> 43:47.089
His richnees should be seen in him

43:47.463 --> 43:52.596
The second symptom of Sahajayoga is that he
should always look happy, he should look cool

43:52.975 --> 43:56.147
Kabirdas said, what do you say,
when you are happy?

43:57.275 --> 43:59.275
If you do not have fun

43:59.933 --> 44:01.933
Then you are not sahajayogi.

44:02.267 --> 44:06.934
If you find this,
We will do anything that Mataji said

44:08.524 --> 44:09.897
I have seen many people like this.

44:10.136 --> 44:12.001
I said, what are you doing?

44:12.152 --> 44:13.580
One thousand people will come.

44:14.184 --> 44:17.103
How can we do it?
Mother, we will take one thousand or three

44:17.128 --> 44:21.158
thousand men.What about it,that's
enough when we are 10 people

44:22.086 --> 44:26.321
It is fun, it is called impudence

44:26.472 --> 44:30.472
If it does not come,
then you still have not been sahajayogi

44:30.798 --> 44:32.567
What is in it, mother said.

44:32.623 --> 44:34.742
Then what is going to
happen and happening

44:35.321 --> 44:38.504
There are many people who
have benefitted from this

44:38.583 --> 44:41.094
They have seen how
much benefit it has made

44:41.225 --> 44:42.118
How much did it get

44:42.222 --> 44:43.634
But it should be anxious.

44:43.738 --> 44:45.204
Must have fun

44:45.571 --> 44:50.238
If the fun does not appear in the person,
then something has happened

44:50.712 --> 44:52.696
He did not have seriousness.

44:52.974 --> 44:56.791
whisperring in all thing,
paying Attention to small things

44:56.838 --> 45:03.299
Do not want to do that, do not want to
do it, or do something that is all fun

45:03.511 --> 45:07.251
Will be deposed,such things
not suitable to sahajayogi

45:07.402 --> 45:08.402
Just fine.

45:08.728 --> 45:13.259
If you do all the fun, then you will be surprised,
what kind of work is done? how things happen?

45:13.339 --> 45:18.163
You have come into the kingdom of God,
If will not having fun now,then when?

45:20.679 --> 45:25.819
So all this is a happy
day, It's a day of light,

45:26.191 --> 45:29.159
We got a flag of freedom.

45:29.477 --> 45:35.135
So I myself in Delhi, saw second flag.
to rising and descending,

45:35.745 --> 45:39.404
And I said that, this is the beauty
of the flag, it should remain

45:39.817 --> 45:47.281
And by that grace we all should be
fully integrated with our identity

45:48.417 --> 45:52.099
Our personality should be
completely integrated only

45:52.298 --> 45:55.057
That should be fun,
should be joyful

45:55.127 --> 45:58.024
Everyone should be
involved in the same

45:58.508 --> 46:01.555
Now these people came
from outside so much.

46:01.635 --> 46:04.420
I do not have time to talk
to them for two minutes

46:04.659 --> 46:06.801
It does not take time to sit
near them for two minutes

46:07.048 --> 46:10.413
They have come from so far, some of them
are such that I have never seen them

46:10.691 --> 46:11.691
They are in the mood

46:12.038 --> 46:14.029
I did not spend a minute with them

46:14.125 --> 46:16.617
But they do not feel anything.
In our Maharashtra not llike this

46:16.895 --> 46:18.569
Mothers did not come to my house.

46:18.633 --> 46:20.141
Not come to my premises.

46:20.641 --> 46:24.726
have not been to my center,
My, me, mine is very much.

46:24.932 --> 46:27.995
And mother did not give time to me,
Give me time.

46:28.266 --> 46:30.266
I have spent all my time in Maharashtra

46:30.500 --> 46:32.674
There is no time to talk to these people

46:32.683 --> 46:35.531
I do not even ask
him, how you are?

46:35.651 --> 46:36.492
To this date.

46:36.675 --> 46:38.781
How are you ?
It is not even said

46:38.996 --> 46:41.099
What do they come here,
and what are they?

46:41.480 --> 46:43.154
means,Thay does not meet.

46:43.306 --> 46:46.390
Went to their country,
which means that are a little too much

46:47.240 --> 46:49.382
But they never said that

46:49.486 --> 46:55.087
Mother, come to me or
come to my home. Talk to me.

46:55.206 --> 46:56.206
Never

46:57.468 --> 47:00.984
Well, secondly, if I would go to
someone, then I would go

47:01.111 --> 47:02.111
That's mine

47:02.524 --> 47:04.524
I would go wherever I want

47:04.746 --> 47:07.047
I do my convenience

47:07.182 --> 47:10.134
People will say,
why did you go to their house?

47:10.230 --> 47:13.683
Hey there, I get convenience there,
so I go, who will you say?

47:14.001 --> 47:16.968
So that's me,
that's why you're going there

47:17.493 --> 47:19.175
To force me to do so

47:19.302 --> 47:25.071
But all this is a sign of eloquence and
stupidity, that they should not be so.

47:25.381 --> 47:29.847
So everyone, for two minutes,
come for a minute to me.why?

47:31.028 --> 47:31.885
Why come?

47:31.997 --> 47:33.893
What are you going to get?

47:34.195 --> 47:37.869
troubled me and made me unhappy

47:38.116 --> 47:39.846
Then,How do i feel happy?

47:39.927 --> 47:45.132
And how will you get blessings from that
happiness? If you followed my troubles

47:45.553 --> 47:48.509
So do not insist that to
come my house.

47:48.549 --> 47:51.303
Come to me.this my should gone.

47:51.827 --> 47:54.398
Which is your house All
of my houses are there.

47:57.141 --> 47:58.061
My child,

47:58.641 --> 48:01.688
My house, my husband,
This is all vengeful symptom.

48:02.587 --> 48:08.126
It should be kept in mind that whatever
children do my, me, those children should never

48:08.468 --> 48:09.721
Can not match.

48:09.762 --> 48:13.816
you have so much heartache
in it that It's a mistake to

48:13.841 --> 48:19.243
say that, even if he is a
murderer, then he is the baby.

48:20.576 --> 48:23.131
So we are a sahajayogi
to get away from him

48:23.182 --> 48:27.282
How should your child be described? You will
not know unless you stay away and see it

48:27.302 --> 48:28.936
So do not invlove in it .

48:29.048 --> 48:32.880
And the society that will be created
by chance, That's the true quality

48:33.778 --> 48:38.981
He is a true sahajayogi and he will
be blessed with this great work

48:39.616 --> 48:42.925
May god bless you .

49:03.200 --> 49:05.875
Gulal etc ...

49:13.505 --> 49:16.711
Should get some communication back

49:17.187 --> 49:19.163
One i think that people

49:19.282 --> 49:21.187
From pune going to mumbai

49:21.324 --> 49:25.507
Mumbains,Punein,from
there,from nagar

49:25.745 --> 49:29.253
This,This and the lane in
it, do not remove

49:30.998 --> 49:35.968
Everyone should meet,Should be in
You must increase love with yourself

49:36.135 --> 49:40.201
Everyone has given
such a suggestion that

49:40.534 --> 49:42.225
It would be good for man

49:43.463 --> 49:45.828
And everyone should travel

49:45.852 --> 49:48.378
You must meet here and there

49:48.608 --> 49:50.608
Which today

49:50.980 --> 49:51.949
Sahajayoga

49:52.052 --> 49:55.404
It has spread to foreign countries.
Sahajayogi there due to it,Not mi

49:57.118 --> 50:00.065
Because I do not have so much
time, my home is there

50:00.374 --> 50:07.105
My husband ia there,So much so Month out of
my tour, Soon there are 14 countries to go

50:07.382 --> 50:09.792
So I live in a country
for 2 to 3 days

50:10.514 --> 50:14.177
But these people came here to
themselves, go there from there

50:14.343 --> 50:17.922
Go and talk to them Make
arrangements everywhere

50:17.962 --> 50:20.216
It does not matter that there are
four psyche sitting at one place

50:23.207 --> 50:27.867
People of Pune go to four places It is
necessary to go out and talk to people only

50:28.248 --> 50:30.859
But you sit in one place
There is a big problem

50:31.311 --> 50:35.083
So it should be taken into mind
That should come among themselves

50:35.504 --> 50:40.904
And when you get in touch,
It should be done as well for sahajayogi

50:41.213 --> 50:42.448
Only then will it work

50:44.154 --> 50:48.123
But that does not mean many people,
Let's know some of that and try to mess it

50:48.257 --> 50:51.930
Mother said,Then they
go with their bed

50:52.628 --> 50:56.224
And whose house a month has
stopped He came to and crying

50:57.938 --> 51:02.589
Hey Mataji stayed for a month,Now
what to do? then you said it only.

51:04.097 --> 51:06.297
Self-respect i said

51:06.709 --> 51:10.368
There is no need to stay with anyone
Do it yourself and arrange somewhere

51:10.701 --> 51:13.684
You have two days to go and
meet and ask how you are?

51:13.709 --> 51:16.857
What's not?, what to do with the
program, and what to do

51:17.769 --> 51:19.769
Now move on
