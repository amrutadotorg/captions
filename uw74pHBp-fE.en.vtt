1981_09_28 Public Program, New York, USA, DP-RAW

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:12.892
Yesterday I gave you the history of the seeking of human beings, how in three different lines we have been seeking.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:25.892
The first one as I told you on the right-hand side, where they were doing something about exciting

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.892
or awakening the deities of the elements, more in Greece and all these places they did these things,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.892
much more than they did in India. Also in India we had the Vedas,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.892
in the Vedas whatever they did was just to excite or you can say awaken the deities of the five elements.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.892
I think you all know what these five elements are, I need not tell about them.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.892
So this side that we see here is the power of action which enacts through five elements.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:20.892
This side is the power as I told you, is the power of desire, which is a power by which you are emotional.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.892
This emotional power is active as a desire power, and this power that is there which is the Kundalini,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.892
is the desire to be one with your Spirit, which is not yet manifested,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.892
that’s why it’s a sleeping power, and called as a residual power.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.892
Because it has created the whole universe that is you, and still is residual.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.892
In the center we have another power, by which we have evolved from our amoeba stage to this stage,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.892
whatever we have achieved is in our central nervous system.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.892
So we have another system which is the achievement through our evolution, that is called as central nervous system.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.892
Whatever is in our central nervous system, is the consciousness, is the present.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.892
So the right-side one, as you see here and the left-hand side one, are also two sympathetic nervous systems:

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.892
this is the left sympathetic nervous system, this is the right sympathetic nervous system.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.892
But as you are seeing here, it is a subtle – subtle body, and in the gross we can say this is the left sympathetic nervous system,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.892
this is the right sympathetic nervous system, and this is the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.892
and the central nervous system we have not shown here.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.892
Whatever you achieve as a human being is perhaps not properly understood also.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.892
Now you see, if you put an animal in a dirty place, he doesn’t know what is dirty,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.892
he doesn’t smell anything awful, he doesn’t think it’s something wrong, it can walk into any place.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.892
While for a human being it is unbearable.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.892
The achievement of our awareness as a human being is there, but is not complete. Is not full.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.892
It has not reached its maximum, or optimum, or we can say it has not got yet its own purpose.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.892
It has not reached its absolute value. And that’s why we are in a confusion.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.892
The another problem is that when the man raised his head here,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:03.892
these two powers started working within him, creating two big institutions called ego and superego.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.892
And these institutions became like balloons and they met on top of the head here,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.892
near the fontanel bone area, say about twelve years of age the whole thing gets calcified.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.892
And when it is calcified, you become the egg, you become separated, you develop your I-ness.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.892
Before that you are not.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.892
Now, an animal doesn’t have a problem of ego. I mean, he doesn’t have many problems,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.892
for example he won’t be bothered if your dollar has a problem.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.892
He won’t understand about insurances. He won’t understand so many problems that we have created for ourselves.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.892
But he doesn’t have the possibility, he doesn’t have the possibility to get realization in the first place,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:00.892
and another possibility that once he gets realization to know his Spirit.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.892
Many people have asked Me: “What about animals?”. I said: “Animals cannot get realization”.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.892
They cannot. Even, say, if there’s an animal if you vibrate that, he may carry the vibrations.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.892
Even this chair can carry the vibrations. Even these flowers can carry the vibrations.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.892
They can have vibrations, but they are not aware of them.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.892
This difference we must understand very clearly, that they are not aware.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.892
That’s why the people who have found out certain places as the places of worship,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.892
places of adoration, they are the people who are seers, who were realized souls,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.892
and they could feel the vibrations in that particular place, and that’s how they selected those places for worship and other things.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.892
Now for example I went to Kashmir once, with My husband, and we were going in the car,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.892
and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations in the air. Cool vibrations.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.892
And I told My driver, I said, “There must be some temple or something here”.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.892
He said: “There’s no temple, it’s absolutely a place which is forlorn”.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.892
But I said: “Must be about 2-3 miles a-here there must be some place of worship of someone”.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.892
“Oh – he said – there is one”, I said: “Which one?”. “It’s called as Hazratbal”,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.892
that is one hair of Mohammed Sahib is kept there. And people go to that place. Now,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.892
so many Muslims go to that place, they don’t know why they go. Some pir, some realized soul,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.892
must have told that this is a hair of Mohammed Sahib and that’s why there are vibrations, so that hair is kept there.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.892
They have fought over it, and done all kinds of things, but they don’t know what they are doing.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.892
So when I went there I saw lots of people were there, and they wouldn’t allow us to go in

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.892
because we were not Muslims according to them, but sitting down there I could feel the vibrations of Mohammed Sahib –

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.892
only one hair of Mohammed Sahib. So you can imagine how powerful these vibrations are.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.892
Now, when we say that we should not worship – in the Bible it is written that you should not worship anything

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.892
that is reproduced and created by the Mother Earth and the heavens.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.892
Now what is it, what is it created by the Mother Earth and by the heavens,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.892
which we should not reproduce? This nobody tries to find out, they think that you are not allowed to worship any form.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.892
It’s all misinterpretation; it’s completely misinterpretation. I’ll tell you, there is in Paris a church

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.892
called as – what is it called, Gavin? – [Gavin: “Notre Dame”] Notre Dame.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.892
And the – and the statue of Mary and Christ is so vibrating, from outside you can see the vibrations are coming out.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.892
Now, this must have been made by some very great artist who was a realized soul.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:06.892
For example, the Sistine Chapel in Rome has got a very beautiful frescos of Christ and all that;

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.892
and if you see that Christ, I mean, it’s absolutely vibrating.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:21.892
But down below there is a big table on which they have put Christ just bones, miserable creature,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.892
which is nowhere near Christ, I mean, it’s impossible that Christ could be like that, so miserable,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.892
ugly-looking, thin, worn out, hopeless case. How can he be Christ, I can’t understand! He carried a complete huge

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.892
big cross upon Himself – do you think these bones could have carried?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.892
And this was placed just below where in Sistine Chapel you find the Christ standing as He was. How can it be?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.892
You must understand! And all these miserable things have led to such problems,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.892
because people think that if you are seeking, you should look the most miserable person.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.892
If you are a realized soul you should be skeleton. It’s impossible to explain to them that how can it be?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.892
A person who is a realized soul never suffers. He never suffers.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.892
The other day – I’m covering this subject before coming to the chakras, because in these few days,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.892
what I have gathered is that very absurd ideas are crawling upon here in America,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.892
where people start saying that Buddha said that you must suffer.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.892
How can He say like that? It’s illogical. Impossible. How can He say that you should suffer?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.892
Because, when He saw suffering – you know the story: when He went out, He saw an old man,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.892
He saw a sick man, He saw a dead man. And the idea came into His head that “Why are they suffering?”.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.892
And then He said: “It is because they are ignorant, they should be enlightened, there should be enlightenment”.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.892
And then He went round and searched and searched and ultimately He was tired.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:13.892
He was sitting down under a banyan tree, when He received His enlightenment, spontaneously.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.892
How can He say that you must suffer?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.892
The another myth among Christians is that you must suffer. Why should you suffer?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.892
Because Christ has suffered for you, isn’t it? Has He suffered or not? If He has suffered for you,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.892
then why should you suffer any more? Or has He left something for you to be done?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.892
Was He incomplete in His suffering? Did you want Him to suffer more?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.892
Actually, this suffering business is the greatest nonsense that I have ever heard.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:56.892
The another side of the Christ is the Jews. They said that if you accept Christ – I mean, they were in a way correct,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.892
that if you accept Christ then you will have to say that you have no suffering. So don’t accept Christ.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.892
If you don’t accept Christ then “we must suffer”. Alright. So you suffer.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.892
And they suffered in Germany you know how they suffered.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.892
Now they have become ego-oriented, they are on the other side, now the shoe is on the other leg.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.892
All these mythical ideas about God, His incarnations, His aspects, is so man-made that it has become plastic,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.892
absolutely plastic, and I don’t know how you are going to destroy this plastic from the human brain.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.892
Is absolutely impossible to convince them that suffering has nothing to do with realized souls.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.892
Actually, suffering is there when you are lost in a tempest, in the water, you are worried about getting engulfed.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.892
But if you are put on the boat will you feel the suffering?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.892
If you are a Christian, if you are a realized soul, you are – if you are really baptized – really,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.892
not by just putting your hand, and “I baptize you, so-and-so, in the name of this and that”: that has no meaning at all, it’s just a drama!

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.892
You dress up well, take the little baby there, she is dressed well and nobody knows anything what’s happening,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.892
and they just put the hand – and you just accept it!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.892
This kind of baptism of course not. But the real baptism, when the Kundalini rises from here,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.892
She goes up – here She awakens Christ, where He sucks these two things, ego and superego,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.892
meaning your conditionings and your karmas, both the things, they are sucked in,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.892
and then the thing there’s an opening here.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.892
Actually you feel the softness here on your head, just like a child. He said:

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.892
“You have to be like little children to enter into the kingdom of God”.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.892
Means, what do the children have? They have a soft bone hole here.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.892
That’s how it becomes, actually it should become physically, and you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.892
So I wanted to clear you on this point, that there is no need for human beings to suffer.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:17.892
Only thing they are to be born again. Now again this is another very, very funny situation creating word is “born again”.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.892
When I came to America last time, everybody was trying to tape Me. I mean, we had much more groups than we have here now,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.892
I don’t know what has happened to them. They are all shifted, they are not here, God knows where they have gone in America,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.892
because all the time Americans are shifting, you see, they are not gruhasthas, they are not householders.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.892
They are all the time shifting from places to places, is impossible to lay hands on anyone.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.892
So somebody has gone to California, somebody has gone to Caracas, and… I mean, everybody has shifted

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:54.892
and I don’t know where are they lost. Whatever it is. Now the main thing is that, when I came here,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.892
I told them that you are to be born again, you are to be realized souls, means actually, I didn’t mean

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.892
that you go to some place and say that “I’m born again”, that sort of a thing I never said.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.892
And the gentleman who had organized the program in Los Angeles, he was very anxious that he said:

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.892
“Mother, don’t allow anybody to tape Your lectures”. But I said: “What’s the harm?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.892
I mean, after all, what’s the harm?”. He said: “No, no, but they’ll spread this”. I said: “Very good,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.892
what do I want out of them is spread the news, alright, now I’ve come and they should get their realization.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.892
This is a fact, this is the truth, and what is the harm, after all truth is truth!”.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.892
But I didn’t realize that they were so stupid, so stupid, that they started many organization on that,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.892
you see, the vibration word came after that, and the “born again”.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.892
Now, they are ‘born again’, self-certified born-agains. You find them anywhere,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.892
I met them in America… in Australia, “We are born again”.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.892
I said: “How?”. “We are born”.I said: “But how? What is your authority?”.“Bible is our authority”.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.892
I said: “But how do you say that you are born again? You must be collectively conscious, isn’t it?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.892
Something must take place in you”. They are fanatics!

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:16.892
These born-agains are nothing but another prototype of Mr. Khomeini, nothing else.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.892
They are Khomeinis, all these fanatics are nothing but Khomeinis!

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.892
In different names, in different labels, but they are not born again, they are not realized souls,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:36.892
because a realized soul is collectively conscious. He is, I’m saying to be. If he becomes.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.892
It is not just he says that “I am born again”. It’s foolish and stupid to say like that, that I am something.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.892
Supposing tomorrow I start saying that I am the Governor of this place: they will arrest Me and put Me in the lunatic asylum!

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.892
That is how people have branded themselves “We are this and we are that, and we are that”.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.892
And the another thing human beings have is to club. They always club together.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.892
You see, under any name they can club, like in England I met someone, he said:

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.892
“Oh, they are, they belong to our group”. I said: “What is your group doing?”. He said:

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.892
“You see, we, we, we have our fork and spoons put in a different way”. I said:

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.892
“Eh?”. For that they have formed the another group.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.892
I said: “Really?” “Yes, you see, our forks and spoons are not the way they put it in England, we have another group”.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.892
I mean, any nonsense they will take up to form a club, or to form a group, or a cult, or a sect,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.892
or… and then bringing God in between, you know, it is in the, “God has given us this idea”.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.892
Now, how did you get connected to God? It’s such an absurd thing going on, I mean, these sects

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.892
and all these things I just can’t understand. God has created no sects, nothing.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.892
He has only created two types of human beings, one who are realized, one who are not.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.892
There’s no third type. At the most you can say there are seekers and non-seekers,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.892
at that point where you can say those who are not realized. But I can’t think of any other thing, I mean,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.892
God has created different type of faces, for example somebody has, say, blond hair,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.892
somebody has black hair, somebody has white skin, black skin…

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.892
He had to do like that, otherwise we would all have looked like machines, like these chairs that are here,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.892
we would have had no beauty about us, isn’t it? There would have been no variety,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.892
such a boring thing to see, all these chairs morning till evening.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.892
That’s why He created this beauty, He made us so beautiful, by giving us different permutations and combinations,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.892
and things, it’s such a, such a work He has put in, while we are trying to become machine-like bolts and nuts

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:58.892
and we become sort of, as they call it the “work”, you see, the work we become of God. Which is absurd.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.892
Say, in the nature if you see, even one leaf is not just the same like the other leaf.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.892
Even there. Variety creates the beauty. And all these points, also people are there,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.892
there might be leagues here for the red hair league, and the black hair league, or maybe any sort of a,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.892
any nonsensical thing they can use it, you can’t say what, to what extent they can go in forming a club

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:33.892
Any sort of thing. And here we are to see that we are universally like this.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.892
Whether you have a black skin or a white skin, whether you have a bald head or a red head,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.892
you all have this thing inside you. All of you have got this universal thing within you,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.892
except for the devils. If you are a human being you all have this thing within you.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.892
Now, when I say this to you, you need not accept Me also, because there’s all freedom in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.892
If you don’t want to accept, is all right, but don’t deny. As a scientist, you must accept this hypothesis.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.892
Once you accept the hypothesis, you go ahead with it, see for yourself, if you get your realization,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.892
then see for yourself, go further and see about it.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.892
Now, as he said that people are saying here that we should get Shakti from anyone, everyone, is another Guru-shopping business, you see?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.892
Is – I’ve seen people who sit down and see that how much money they can spend on their seeking.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.892
So they find out, “Now, if you have to go to X you have to pay two hundred and he is hundred…

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.892
Now, how much money do I have in the bank, how will I balance it, now how many people I can go to?”.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:47.892
The idea is, as many things you can buy in the market in that little money, is all – they sit down and plan it out. You see, this is not God.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:56.892
But they will be lost with Me because you can’t just purchase Me. You cannot. Neither you can buy Him.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.892
Now, what to do now, where do I fit in? Then I don’t fit in, because there’s – according to their planning I don’t fit in,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.892
because I’m supposed to get some money out of it.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.892
And it’s such a funny sort of a clownish behavior towards religion that I was flabbergasted,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.892
when I started seeing people here, I mean, I came here no doubt, but I refused to come for nine years.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.892
I said, ‘Now these people only think of dollars, dollars, dollars: when are they going to think of God?”.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:39.892
How much money did Christ charge you? You sold Him for thirty rupees. You sold Him.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:48.892
Did He charge any money? He lived like a carpenter’s son. He had only two tunics to wear.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.892
He lived with that, but He was the king. Because such people do not care for anything, you see,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.892
nothing can make them tempted too. For such people it’s alright.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.892
If you make Me sleep on the ground it’s alright! If you make Me sleep in a palace is alright,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.892
for such people they are kings they are above all these things, you cannot lure them into anything.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.892
And that’s what was before you, Christ. Christ came on this earth before Me.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.892
Told you that what is important is your Spirit. Look after your Spirit.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:35.892
And you raised your churches, and you raised all these buildings, and all these places – where is the Spirit?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.892
The Spirit is missing. We have to pay attention to our Spirit.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.892
He has said it in many, many words, “You are to be born again”. It is, He said it,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.892
“You put Me in your heart”, all that was possible in that language, to these fishermen,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.892
He told. Of course they have honestly quoted all that, but not all that what He said.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.892
Because He also lived only for three, four years there, and He was crucified. I mean,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:14.892
imagine the stupidity of people to crucify Christ. I can tell you, if He comes to America today you may crucify Him.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:24.892
Why? Because anybody who cures in this country, he is prosecuted!

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:31.892
Your legal side is so great, you don’t know the laws of God, you don’t know these Divine laws how they work.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.892
So let us forget about this one, you are all seekers, you are special people, you are chosen people, you are men of God.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.892
You are not men of the world. Accept your position. Have your self-esteem.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.892
You are not the people who are going to seek money, and are going to judge God through money,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.892
or through positions, or anything. Like these people went to see the medias

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:10.892
and they were only impressed by My husband’s position, imagine! But you are different.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.892
You are the seekers, you are the seekers of truth, and truth you cannot purchase.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.892
I’m telling you this because I feel people need some cracking on this point.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.892
You cannot purchase, you cannot have a course, you cannot demand it.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.892
It has to work out, it’s a happening, it’s a living happening, it’s a living process, of a living God.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.892
Christ has said how many times this word ‘living’?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.892
Which is living, is here, by going to anybody you can get any number of spirits.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.892
By paying to them you can purchase nothing but spirit and your lunacy.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.892
You can get epilepsy by paying money, you can get heart attacks, you can get your blood cancers

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.892
and you can get also some horrible types of diseases, which I have seen people are getting,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.892
these horrible so-called Shakti-Pat people. One has to know, once you become the Spirit

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:24.892
you become marvelous. Your health must improve, everything must improve.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.892
So today we are here, on the chakras I have given you the introduction because you will see why you improve in health.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.892
Why there has to be improvement in health when the Kundalini rises.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.892
Now at the very outset I will tell you one thing very important, which should not really shock you,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.892
but you should know is a fact: that this one, is the first center, called as Muladhara chakra.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.892
Now, the word Muladhara means, Mula means the root. Adhara means the support.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.892
So this is the support of the root. The root is this, Kundalini, and this is the support of the Kundalini.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.892
And this is the chakra which is bestowed upon by a deity called Shri Ganesha,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:25.892
who is the embodiment of innocence. It is the same deity born at this time as Christ.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.892
Now one should know that this chakra in the gross controls the pelvic plexus.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.892
I don’t know how many of you are doctors here. But pelvic plexus also has sub-plexuses which are four in number.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.892
And they control all our excretory functions, including sex.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.892
Now, if you see it clearly, it is placed below the Kundalini. Because it’s the innocence.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.892
In the mud of excretion is put the innocence, because He is innocent.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.892
A child doesn’t understand sex, does He? He is the eternal Child. Ganesha is the eternal Child.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:19.892
Christ is an eternal Innocence. He doesn’t understand sex nor can He marry anyone –

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.892
all these ideas of Christ marrying, I mean, how can you marry a little child?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.892
He doesn’t develop ego and superego, like human beings do.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:38.892
And that’s why the head of the Child is that of an elephant, because elephant is a very, very wise animal

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.892
and there is a story about it, but that I will tell you later on.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:53.892
To show that, the person who is bestowing, or we can see [say?] the King who is enthroned here,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:03.892
is the one who is a Child, His ego and superego do not meet. He does not have I-ness.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.892
This is what was the meaning of this. In this center He resides,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:17.892
but that shows one thing very clearly: that sex has nothing to do with your realization. Kundalini is above it.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:30.892
Only this center informs that somebody is there before you who is authorized to do the job,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.892
or who is there who has got the authority which is emitting for that person, and that’s how the Kundalini rises.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.892
Just like sprouting of the seed. This is the primule you can say of the seed which rises,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:28:00.892
but the information comes through this in here, that there is somebody who is an authority, Divine authority.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.892
Authority word is very, very aggressive, Divine authority is very loving,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.892
and such a person is there and the Kundalini rises immediately.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.892
This is how the Kundalini awakening takes place.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.892
So the first and foremost thing we have to know that sex plays no part in Kundalini awakening.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.892
People go and learn sex behavior from animals: now, are you going to become animals?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.892
What is there to learning sex I just don’t, I don’t understand!

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.892
The knowledge is already there, in India nobody talks of sex the way you talk,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.892
we are producing much more children than you are producing!

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.892
Also there is another reason, as I told you yesterday that no children want to be born in Western countries,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.892
because they are killed, they are harmed, they are tortured; but in India even a person may have twelve children, he loves the children.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.892
That may be another reason we are facing that, but one of them is that they know about sex quite alright.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.892
And they don’t have children which you can call as illegitimate children.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:14.892
Very few in India illegitimate children are! Very few people divorce. I mean, they live happily!

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.892
All desires you have developed of your marriage, what have you got are divorced people,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.892
children are suffering, they are in the orphanage, and the old people are also in the orphanage.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.892
Ten husbands marry ten wives and they are planted in orphanages. No family system, nothing.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:42.892
So one has to understand that sex is placed here and is to be respected as a function,

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:50.892
and as a private function, specially to be sanctified by the public.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.892
For example, excretion of any kind: if the public has not sanctioned. For example

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.892
it has not been sanctioned that you go and do something on the street. You’ll be arrested, isn’t it?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.892
So whatever is not sanctioned to you, if you do like that, because you think you have got your liberties to do it,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.892
you will be definitely arrested and will be troubled. And we can see it in nature also

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.892
that if you do all these things, you develop horrible diseases.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.892
I was seeing the statistics of the American nude and I was amazed that 65% young people

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.892
from 25 to 40 years have some sort of a disease which is a secret disease.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:45.892
Which is a ugly disease. What a charring thing it is, just think of it. If you go through the statistics you see,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:54.892
either they suffer from impotency, or they suffer from horrible diseases which are supposed to be incurable.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:08.892
Of the sex origin. If your liberation so-called means license, was a good thing, nature would have been kinder to you. But it is not!

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.892
Apart from anything else, we have got Christ before us. Let’s see, what Christ has to say?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:21.892
He said, “Thou shalt not have adultery is said. But I say: Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:33.892
See what a powerful statement it is. Because He’s there, near the eyes. Not only the adultery part, but even the eyes.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.892
And you see here people have their eyes roving all over, like – God knows what’s happening to them.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.892
They must see every woman who’s passing, every woman must every man who’s passing.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.892
I don’t know what are they doing, wasting their attention. He has said it so clearly.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:58.892
Even in the church when they are sitting, when they are trying to worship Christ, they are doing nothing but flirting!

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.892
Have we no respect for ourselves?!

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.892
First purification point comes here. The first purification comes here. Let us face it.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.892
Of course you’ll be purified when the Kundalini rises.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.892
But I must tell you, when this center is catching, the Kundalini is sucked back.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.892
One has to raise it again and again, and again and again, and again and again, to establish realization.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.892
You can become a very dry person, an over-sexy person, it can be any perversion,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.892
or you can be all sorts of perversions, I really don’t even understand, the man becomes a woman,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.892
and a woman becomes a man, and this and that possession – all sorts of nonsensical things –

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.892
dog becomes a man, and – I mean, I just can’t understand how you are going mad with …

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.892
Hither and thither, all over the places, I mean, I don’t – I really don’t understand, I was so shocked,

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:03.892
I never knew that such things exist in this world, that human beings have gone to that limit of nonsense.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:12.892
Books have been written about it. I met two ladies in, in Basel, very near the German border.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.892
These two ladies who came to Me were horrid, absolutely horrid.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.892
And this one was there and she was shaking before Me, and all sorts of things happening to them.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.892
And I asked her, “What do you do?”. “Oh, You see, we are very qualified”. I said,

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.892
“How?” “We have done all the sophisticated methods of Freud”.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.892
I said: “Really? Now you have surpassed him or what?”. I could not give them realization!

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.892
I mean, the way you have taken Freud seriously, Christ is absolutely blurred out of your family.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.892
Christ is only for a cross to be worn, that’s all. But that far, nothing beyond.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.892
And cross is not the message of Christ, is the resurrection! You are to be resurrected,

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.892
He got His resurrection to prove that you can be resurrected.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.892
And how are we to resurrect when we have indulged so much into the nonsense of this?

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:14.892
But still I must tell you, I must confess that the grace of God has poured all its kindness now.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.892
Really, I tell you, any type of thing is really forgiven. All sins and blasphemy and all that is forgiven

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.892
and you really get your realization. I’ve seen people who are described as one of the worst

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:38.892
and the worst and the worst of all: they get their realization and that’s how they get their transformation and transmutation.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.892
It’s surprising how it’s working. It has to work! Because the creation is to be saved.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.892
It is He who is worried about His creation rather than we are worried.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:59.892
So the first chakra I have told you about, has got four – four, we call them petals,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.892
in Sanskrit language, petals. And these petals have four sub-plexuses to look after.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.892
Now, when we go to Kundalini, it has got three and a half coils.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.892
Kundalini is placed there in three and a half coil. Three and a half coil has a special meaning,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.892
and it is a mathematical calculation, three and a half is, is a mathematical calculation,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.892
and if you happen to read one of My – I think in the Advent I don’t know if is discussed it (or) not,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.892
but it’s a mathematical calculation which has got seven – actually if you see there it makes seven chakras,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.892
if you, if you push it one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, if you draw a straight vertical line.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.892
And this is also principle is used in our automatic watches,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.892
the spring that we use is a spiral which has three and a half coils.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.892
It’s a mathematical coefficience that works out.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.892
Now this Kundalini is placed in the sacrum bone, called as sacrum, that means Greek knew that it was a sacred bone.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.892
And it is said that when the body burns, this bone doesn’t burn.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.892
It remains. Unless and until terrible acid and all these things fall on it, it does not burn.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.892
And it is a sacred bone. Now. Then, I mean, on Kundalini if I have to speak, I can…

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.892
I must have spoken at least for hours. But we are now going like an introduction to all these chakras, alright?

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.892
And later on you’ll get My tapes from England and you can go through them

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.892
and see for yourself how this Kundalini is a tape recorder within us. She tapes everything.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.892
And She has got all the information as to what you have done, where you have been.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.892
As soon as the Kundalini rises, you get the information on the fingers,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.892
the realized souls get the information on the fingers. She gives information – he is catching there,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.892
is catching here, this is the problem, and this is to be corrected.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.892
I’ve seen people have got Kundalini – you’ll be amazed – so wounded, so many holes,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.892
it’s just trying to rise, you know, it’s absolutely desperate.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:25.892
It flexes at this side, that side, it cannot rise. And again it falls out, limp down, and it wants help.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.892
If this chakra (maybe the Muladhara) is catching, or this chakra is catching , then you find a big pulsation in that area,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.892
I mean you will see terrible pulsation. Just like a heart, you can see with your …

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.892
But this chakra if it’s catching, specially on the left side,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.892
means – the left side – means that a person is possessed. Unauthorized person has put some possession into him.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.892
Such a person gets specially this pulsation very strong in this area.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.892
You can see it very clearly this pulsation in people who have got a catch,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.892
in the way the Swadhistan chakra caught up on the left hand side, you get it – the nearer it is, the worse it is.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.892
It starts pulsating because it is trying to push itself, it wants to get out of the barrier,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.892
and that’s why it makes a tremendous effort to come out. But it does not. And then it sets back again.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:31.892
And again it tries. And I have seen that unless and until you clear this chakra, it doesn’t come up.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.892
Now, when you come to this chakra, which is the second as we said, why we said –

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.892
because this is connected with this like a, we can say a stock of a lotus.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:53.892
Now, this chakra is the chakra of our seeking. Navel chakra. It’s called as Nabhi chakra.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:05.892
This center is responsible for our evolution, up till now. Like from amoeba to this stage we became because of the power of this center.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.892
And this center is occupied by the Father figure, whom we call as Narayana. Lakshmi Narayana.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.892
Is the One, is the Father aspect of God. Now, one can say there is only one God. Yes, there is only one God.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:26.892
No doubt, there’s only one God. There are not many Gods. But God, who is One, has many aspects.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.892
Like you can be a doctor, you can be a husband, you can be a father, you could be a son.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.892
Now you can’t say there’s only one man. I mean, then, God is not like Rock of Gibraltar,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:47.892
that He, He has no other aspects; but even Rock of Gibraltar, if you go and study, it has got different cells of which it is made.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.892
So God has different aspects, and in those different aspects He acts differently.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.892
There’s only one God who does this, but His aspects are different.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:09.892
Now, the first aspect of God is the desire of God that He wants to create. This desire is represented by this power of His.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:19.892
The another aspect of God is here, by which He wants – He creates, He acts. He acts and creates.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.892
He is the Creator on this side. Now, the central one is the aspect of God which is the Father,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:35.892
which is the One which tries to evolve, improves His image on the reflectors that He has created.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:43.892
These are the three functions and three aspects of God. Now this aspect is the aspect of the Spirit here, we say,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:56.892
because it’s the One that the Spirit exists all the time, it is changeless, it is eternal, and it does not incarnate.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.892
In the sense that that aspect, which is the aspect of a witness, does not incarnate.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.892
That’s the God Almighty, we can say, is called as Sadashiva in Sanskrit language.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:17.892
This aspect of God does not incarnate. He never incarnates. But His power is the Adi Shakti, is the Primordial Mother,

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.892
is the Primordial Power, the Primordial Shakti, is the One that creates this whole thing.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.892
She first creates the left side, and then the right side, and then the central side.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:39.892
These are the three powers this Primordial Power has got. And then She puts this Kundalini down there,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:51.892
when you become a human being it rises, and makes you aware of that All-pervading Power which is this cool breath which you start feeling.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.892
So the witness stays in the heart – the witness is the Spirit.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.892
He is Sat-Chit-Ananda, means He is the truth, He is the attention, and He is the joy.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.892
When you get your realization, your attention becomes enlightened. Your attention becomes enlightened. How?

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.892
That I can tell you there’s someone here who is one of the first sahaja yogis we had.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:25.892
When he got his realization he asked Me: “Mother, my father has not telephoned to me all these days… (unclear due to bad quality of audio)… how is he”.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.892
I said, “You can feel him, just what is happening to him”. He just put his hands like this (inaudible due to bad quality of audio) and he got a burning here.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.892
These are the centers of your father. I said, “This one, that means something is wrong with him in the throat,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.892
maybe he is down with bronchitis, of a serious type”, because it was burning.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.892
He telephoned to Scotland and the person answered was his mother,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.892
and she told in the same language, same sentence, that he’s down with very bad bronchitis.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.892
You can even cure him sitting down. You can, because you are enlightened,

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.892
your attention is enlightened. Enlightened is not just ordinary light.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:10.892
Enlightenment means that when you are enlightened with the Divine light, in the real sense, not this artificial one,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:21.892
then your attention starts acting. It starts working out. It starts cooperating, coordinating, it’s a telecommunication and everything.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.892
Apart from that, it loves. And this All-pervading power you have to become.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.892
Actually we do not know, we are not aware of this. We do not know that there is all-power around us,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.892
that this All-pervading power is surrounding us, you are not at all aware of this.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:46.892
Is like, I say there is all music going on here, and a drama going on here – you won’t believe Me, till I put the television:

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.892
“Oh – you say – yes, it is there”. In the same way, unless and until you are put to the mains,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:00.892
you cannot feel that All-pervading power. And that is the Truth. The rest is all just a falsehood.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.892
Is fake. That’s the only thing that is the Truth is the All-pervading power.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:14.892
Whatever that All-pervading power relates to you is the truth. Like when you have that, you ask a question: “Is there God?”.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.892
You’ll get tremendous flow on your hand. But if you ask about a horrid person, who is not a Guru

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.892
but is a fake person, immediately the vibrations will stop – not only that, sometimes it may burn,

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.892
it may even give you blisters, if you just ask the question.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:38.892
It is so surprising, it is so simple, that once you jump into it, the All-pervading power starts emitting

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.892
through you and you become the vehicle of that power, and the master of it.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:51.892
Whatever way you want, you can maneuver it, you can know – now for example this gentleman has got the left side problem:

00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:00.892
how did I know? I could feel it within Myself. Now, if you put your left hand towards a person,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.892
who is a realized soul or who has the power, and put your right hand outside, the whole thing will be cleared out – aren’t you better now? –

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.892
you’ll be much more comfortable, it will go away.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.892
It has to go away, because the connection is established, now the thing is flowing in,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.892
and it just – just like the electricity flowing out. It’s so simple! It’s so simple;

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.892
to you this electricity looks very simple because your forefathers have worked for it, and they have brought it down here.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.892
To you it is just switching on on the light. But how many lives have been lost for this.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.892
How much mechanism is there, what an organization is there, everything is there.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.892
But to you it is just switch on, that’s all, finished. It’s so simple.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.892
So to look at it may look simple, but it’s a tremendous organization that works it out.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:53.892
Imagine these centers are built within us with our evolution. This is the center of when we were just carbon, up to carbon point.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.892
Carbon also is tetravalent. This is also tetravalent. Till we were carbon – carbon is a very pivotal,

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:10.892
pivotal element in all the elements, if you see the position of carbon; because when carbon started, then only life started coming.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.892
And this is how we are here up to the carbon point.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.892
After that we become human beings we start… I mean, life, then we start growing here.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:26.892
Now this grew into seven stages. We grew into, say, definitely we say ten stages,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.892
out of which eight stages brought us up to human level.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.892
Now as I told you, this is the center of creativity,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.892
means it creates all the stars and everything within us, it creates all the galaxies and all those things within us,

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.892
and is also responsible for looking after our left side psyche and the right side creativity.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.892
Say if there is an artist with us, who comes to us, you’ll find his right side Swadhisthana –

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.892
this is the Swadhisthana is (this? Unclear) also you can see here

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:08.892
immediately you’ll find that he is an artist. Immediately you’ll find that he is giving you hot vibrations on this part,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.892
means he is an artist, or maybe he has used it too much, a person who is a speaker, or a writer, and all that thing,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.892
who has used his creative power too much on the right hand side, gives you this feeling.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.892
The one who has used the left side psyche, like people who have been tampered with their psyche – you see,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:35.892
a psychologist, a person who is a psychologist, who is studying psychology – I mean, psychology cannot be studied by people who are not realized souls.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:44.892
They should not. They do not know how they are harmed by tampering with others’ psyche.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.892
They do not know how to protect themselves.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.892
For a doctor may tie up something to save himself from infections.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.892
But a psychologist does not know how he is harmed.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.892
Even if we live with a mad person, or if you go to a lunatic asylum, you catch from that people.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:08.892
That’s how your left side gets caught up and you find that left side starts working in such a manner that you develop all left side problems.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:17.892
Left side problems are depression, epilepsy – leading to all kinds of modern pressures as they call it,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:31.892
guilt, and diffidence, suicide, could be lunacy, all those things come from your left side – and last of all cancer.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.892
Cancer is caused by the left side problem and not by the right side problem.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.892
Actually, as a reaction of the right side, if you are too active – you are too active, all the time you are thinking,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.892
because this center does another very important work.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:56.892
It changes, transforms your fat into the cells for the use of your brain which, which is using it for thinking.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.892
So it goes into tremendous action when you start planning. I mean, here I have seen people plan too much.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.892
Till they say “All set”. You see, you start from the home: they start planning.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.892
There is no need to plan, I don’t understand, what is the need to plan to that extent. I mean,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.892
you are going on the road, there’s no need to plan at all! You have to work it out at the present moment.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.892
For example supposing I have to book a ticket: then that is done, to be done today.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.892
Then what is the planning? “That on the eighth I will book…”. What is the need to say that beforehand, I mean,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:36.892
when it will come to eighth you book it. But they go on like this and ultimately all plans fail, everything fails.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.892
You go to a place for example you don’t know. If you say, “Alright, we’ll go to the right”.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:51.892
But the maybe there is no road on the right, so are you going to fall into the ditch because you have planned it beforehand that “I will go to the right”?.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.892
See, you must leave it open! And the same about Kundalini, because the, when the Kundalini rises,

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.892
it’s like a car that has started – it moves, it moves, it moves – supposing it has stopped here.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.892
And somebody gives you a mantra for this one.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.892
You’ll spoil this one as well as this is already spoilt.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.892
So you’ll have a double problem, because you are saying mantra with this one.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.892
Of course any mantra you say you spoil this in any case. Apart from that,

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.892
you have no connection, nothing, you are not yet realized souls, and you are taking somebody’s name like that.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.892
For example Rama’s mantra, is Rama is here.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.892
Many people say Rama’s mantra and they have a problem with this, they can get asthma – physically.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.892
“Ah, I’m saying Rama’s mantra but I have got asthma”.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.892
What else, I mean, you must get it. If you, if you have asthma I’ll ask you, “Did you say Rama’s mantra in India?”.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.892
Absolutely it goes hand in hand, because Rama is stationed here. Alright?

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.892
Now, if you have to take His name, there should be some protocol. What is your authority?

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:06.892
Why are you taking Rama’s name? Supposing I start taking the name of your President, in his house go there and start shouting

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:36.892
So, some Rama who is working in your house and has died, or someone like that thing,

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.892
“Oh President, President”, whatever his name is, I start shouting his name. I’ll be arrested or not?

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:20.892
Or maybe, maybe at that time when you are shouting Rama’s name, maybe some servant with the name of Rama who has died,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.892
will think that “There’s a call for me”, may come and enter into your being. Mostly it happens,

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:37.000
because you have no connection with Rama Himself. With Shri Rama you have no connection.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.892
or maybe around somewhere in the atmosphere these busybodies,

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.892
anybody can enter into you and you can get possessed and you can get this asthma.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.892
This right side problem is very common with people who are suffering from this trouble.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:02.892
And this trouble comes to you because you try to be very individualistic.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.892
Like, if you are married you don’t want to create good relationships…

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.892
Can you ask him to go down, he is distracting everyone. Alright?

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:21.892
Can you ask him to come to the, to the – tomorrow, day-after-tomorrow to our place, where I will treat him. Alright?

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:33.892
He can sit there also. Alright? I’ll cure him tomorrow. Or after the program I’ll try.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.892
It’s moving, the thing is moving in him, you see, from places to places, and one has to take to it.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:44.892
There are so many here, I’ve seen so many, such strange people I’ve met on the street, such strange people.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.892
There are so many, I mean, if you, I don’t know what is the percentage of lunatics in this country,

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.892
but schizophrenic and all sorts of people, I mean you can’t say, I mean – just see, every third person

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.892
I came across has some sort of a funny thing going on in his head.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.892
I said, “Now what is it – this is the country which is invaded the most by these negative forces.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.892
And if you are going to be destroyed, you are going to be destroyed from inside, not from outside.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.892
You will not be destroyed from outside. Take it from Me. You’ll be destroyed from inside.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.892
And that you can see what’s happening, all kinds of destructive forces are working it out.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.892
And the worst of all, these horrible gurus who have come from India.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:33.892
You people had invasion on India. English had their political invasion, you had your monetary invasion on India.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:39.892
So all these horrible people are having a mental invasion on you – you are not aware of it.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.892
It’s a mental invasion on you. Very subtle mental invasion which you cannot discern –

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.892
you are enslaved, as we were enslaved by you for money.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:54.892
You see, for wheat, if they send horrible wheat to India, Americans used to say “Eh, oh, we have been very gracious”.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.892
And the wheat was so horrible that we could not eat. We threw it on the grounds, imagine,

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:07.892
we threw it on the grounds and horrible types of – what you call – acacia plants grew. We cannot destroy them.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.892
And then another type of grass which we called as Congress grass, you see –

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:19.892
because it came from America we called it Congress grass – grew all over and it covered all over crops and everything.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.892
And we, we didn’t know why were you so kind to us to send all these things.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.892
Somehow it was destroyed then, this grass, but still this horrible acacia is covering all the villages in India,

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.892
people are having a terrible time, they are poisonous; and if they hit you, you see, you are killed.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.892
And children play around – it’s a very dangerous thing. I mean, if they wanted to send wheat,

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.892
that should have been something more gracious than what they have been doing.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.892
This is how you have been very, very unpopular all over the world.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.892
Whenever you try to help anyone, you think, “Oh, you are doing too much”.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.892
While India has helped you so many ways. First of all it has helped you when you had wars,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.892
we sent Indian troops and all that all over – we never tried to show anything like that.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:08.892
You see, it is surprising how these developed nations are so ego-oriented. So ego-oriented, I mean,

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:17.892
so many things they have done that I cannot understand how human beings are not afraid of God and His wrath that can come on us.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.892
We have oppressed all the people who are already oppressed, we have tried to really crash them down.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:31.892
Now it is time for you people who are born in this country, who are special people born – you are very, very special,

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:40.892
in America we have the maximum number of crazy, you would not know; it is for you to rise above all these nonsensical things and get over it.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:51.892
And join your hands in solving the problems of these worldly things which has really oppressed the whole universe.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:58.892
And I really dependent very much on you people. I came nine years back,

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:06.892
but I found that the aggression is still bubbling in, they cannot see things; and that’s how these gurus take advantage of it.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.892
They took advantage of it, they came here: “Alright, you have got money? Pamper your ego, you can purchase us”.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.892
They pampered your ego, you thought you can pay for them, you paid for them:

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:24.892
but what did you get out of it? Is nothing but all these horrible things out of which it is very difficult to get out.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.892
Apart from that, many might have lost their chances of Self-realization.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:35.892
You are absolutely special people to be born – you have taken birth in this country with a very, very special purpose.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.892
Because I told you that you are born in this place, this is America.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.892
What a place it is. I mean, you had great people like Abraham Lincoln, great people like him, what a man he was, you had.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.892
You have forgotten him completely, his ideals and things, I mean, what a man is Abraham Lincoln.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.892
I mean, if I read about anyone in the beginning was Abraham Lincoln, I said “Look at him”.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.892
He was a realized soul! His ideals and all that are gone off. Now it is for you to establish.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:12.892
For what you (have?) to, for what God has created this America, this chakra of Vishuddhi.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.892
And this is what is starting from here that you rise up to there.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:26.892
The connection is that this seeking goes in developing

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:32.892
and there are ten principles which are described as the Ten Commandments, you can say,

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.892
or we have got ten Sutras, in Sanskrit language they are called as ten Sutras.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.892
Gandhiji put one more, by saying that we should use only Indian, Indian things, not foreign things,

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.892
because then they will dominate us. So he put ekadesha, he put one more.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:55.892
But there are ten, which are here, which are described as Ten Commandments in the Bible.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.892
And these are the ten Primordial Masters who were born on this earth.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:11.892
Say we can start from Socrates, then we can think of other, in India was Dattatreya, is the – Dattatreya is the essence.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.892
And He is born as Socrates. He is born as Lao-Tse. He is born as Abraham. As Moses.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:27.892
He is born as – up till now we can say Mohammed Sahib, Nanaka. Latest is the Sai Nath of Shirdi.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:38.892
He’s the One who represents, they all represent this Primordial Master’s principle of religion.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:50.892
Religion means the one that sustains us. These ten are our sustenance, is we can say our valences, is our quality.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:59:00.892
Like this gold has a quality that it is untarnishable, in the same way human beings have these ten qualities in them.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.892
For a dog doesn’t know what is truth and what is untruth.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:10.892
Dog doesn’t know what is, what is violence and non-violence.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:17.892
Is the human being who knows these ten things. And these are the qualities, ten qualities which are sustained

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:24.892
by the Primordial Master who is Dattatreya, who has incarnated on this earth basically ten times,

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:32.892
but there are so many upa-gurus as they call, the subsequent gurus, also who are realized souls.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:40.892
Now. At the time of Christ, John the Baptist. I mean, he was a real Baptist, he was not an untrue Baptist, he was a realized soul.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.892
Nowadays everybody’s a Baptist, without being the real Baptist.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:52.892
You have to be the real Baptist – when you are a realized soul, only then you are a real Baptist, not before that.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.892
And this special thing called as the Primordial Master,

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.892
is also within you. You can become your own Guru. Your Guru Principle is to be awakened.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.892
If the Kundalini awakens your Guru Principle, you become the Guru.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:22.892
You have to become your own Guru. On the left side is the diffidence that you cannot be a Guru. On the right side is the arrogance.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:31.892
And that’s how sometimes we, we subject ourselves to others, saying that “You are my guru”.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.892
And here we are arrogant – when we see a real Guru, we deny it.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.892
So these two sides are to be seen, and once you work it out…

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.892
For example, this gentleman who was here has a left side. Is the diffidence in him.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.892
(Please, come in. Eh? Alright. May God bless you. Alright.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.892
So left side is the one that gives you that diffidence and you subject yourself to other gurus.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.892
And you can see it on your left side Void, this is the Void.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:12.892
You can feel it on the left side Void a burning sensation. And this is a sign that you have been to some guru who has been wrong –

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:21.892
who is not a realized soul, who is a wrong type of man. Immediately you can make out from the person whether he has been to a right type of a guru or a bad type.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.892
If you have been to the right type, you get your realization just like that. You are just ready for it.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.892
He doesn’t spoil your chakras, nothing. He doesn’t give you false ideas. And you are just ready;

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.892
but he has done very great work is to establish this part in your stomach.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:45.892
That’s why Moses, Abraham, all of them talked about alcoholism, about these things, because alcohol spoils the liver.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.892
Christ did not. He was born at that time, so He talked about the eyes.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.892
He talked about the realization. He talked about the Gate, the Door.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.892
And that’s why He said you must get your resurrection. So the different aspects came at different time,

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.892
and this aspect of the Primordial Master which was Moses, you can say, Abraham,

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.892
and other people of the same type, they came to establish balance and dharma within us.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.892
Here they have not shown two other subsidiary chakras. One is the chakra of the sun

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.892
and another is of the moon. This is the moon line and this is the sun line.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.892
Now this center they should have shown here I think,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.892
which means that when you are on the sun line, you become right handed.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.892
Right handed means you are more projecting towards the future, you are thinking too much,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.892
or you are putting too much attention to your physical being. And not to your Spirit.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.892
Not to your emotional self. Now, when you start getting to the asceticism, and all sorts of nonsense like that,

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.892
become an ascetic, give up this, give up that, give up that – and you give up actually your brain,

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.892
nothing else – you become a thin person, you start moving like this and develop a horrible liver.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.892
You see? this liver may extend up to this.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.892
Now, liver is one of the, one of the very, very special organs we have got within ourselves.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.892
I mean, you would not know if you have a bad liver till you get to cirrhosis.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.892
When they will say that: “Now, last time has come, you are in for your funeral”. That’s what it is.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.892
Liver is like that, it goes on getting bad, bad, bad till you do not know.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.892
But in Sahaja Yoga immediately you will know you have a liver problem. And you will also know how to cure it.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.892
And liver is responsible for our attention, which is so important. If your liver is not alright, your attention will be horrid,

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.892
all the time you’ll be feeling sick, frustrated, embittered, you won’t like this, you won’t like that –

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:49.892
sort of a person, always annoyed, and you will not know “why I do like this, I don’t want to do it,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.892
but why am I doing like that”. So this is the one one has to look after.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.892
But when you think too much, as I told you, this center of Swadishtana,

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.892
which is bestowed upon by Brahmadeva, who is the Creator, works too hard,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:15.892
and it has no time to look after the other things like the liver, the pancreas, the spleen, the kidneys, and the uterus.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:24.892
So these things get completely neglected, and that’s how the people who think too much always get diabetes.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.892
In Sahaja Yoga diabetes is curable. Hemiplegia and all those things, and anemia and all these things are the cause of the same thing.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.892
Such people can become so very dry, really very dry because their left side goes absolutely out of order, it’s sleeping.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.892
They become emotionless. I’ve known people they came to tell Me, “Mother, I have no emotions now,

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.892
I have become a great saint, I have no emotions.” Who has told you?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:57.892
I mean, a saint has such emotions you can’t imagine. It’s such a, such a feeling!

01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:36.892
When he sees others in trouble, when he sees others drowning, then the compassion starts flowing from his eyes,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.892
I mean, if somebody says that he is a saint and he has no emotions, you throw him in the sea.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.892
He is good for nothing. A person who has no emotions is not a human being, he is worse than an animal.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:20.892
And if you see a saint, the difference is only this: that if you feel pained, then you start weeping and becoming emotional.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:37.000
But a saint is the other way round. When he sees others in pain, then the compassion fills him completely.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.892
and you can see the compassion from those eyes, absolutely the same terrific eyes become so compassionate

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:49.892
that you are surprised that how this love is flowing. And at the same time he can take a hunter in his hand and hit people;

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.892
at the same time he can be very wrathful with people who try to destroy the saints,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.892
he can be extremely wrathful, and he can be very, very, very, very dynamic.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:11.892
He can be anything; but he uses it for the purpose of one thing: is to save the saints and to make them the Spirit.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.892
His only concern is how to make them the Spirit, and for that how to save them.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:25.892
For that, whatever has to do – sometimes it can act like a tigress, just jump on people

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:34.892
who try to be injurious, or try to be sort of harmful to the children of the tigress.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.892
Or it can become so mild, so mild: I don’t know if you have seen a crocodile giving bath to her children.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.892
Her eyes become absolutely so mild, imagine. It’s like that.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:53.892
That love you start seeing in a person who is a saint and who becomes a realized soul,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.892
that he feels for others. Not for himself. He is not bothered!

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.892
Comforts do not matter – where you sit, what you need, “I must have this food”: that all nonsense, never comes in the mind.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.892
What matters is: “Oh God, what’s happening to these people, these are my children!

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.892
They are seekers, they are saints, they have been seeking for thousands of years.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:23.892
How am I to save them?”. And such people who are dry they end up in heart attacks, and another is paralysis.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.892
I mean, you should never have sympathies for people who have heart troubles.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.892
Tell them to be more loving. Spend some time with your wife. Spend some time with your children. You see,

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.892
mostly these busy people are those who are at the helm of affairs, who think that the whole world will be drowned without them.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:49.892
Actually with them it may be drowned, I don’t know about that part. Such very busy people, you see,

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:59.892
who have no time to waste in their family and who are holding the banner of some sort of a great thing so-called – t

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:07.892
hey always get heart attacks and die. If they are not shot off, they are – they get their own heart attacks and die.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:15.892
They get – can get even epilepsy, but it’s not actually the epilepsy – it looks like epilepsy

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:27.892
but it is a kind of a failure of the part of the head which is on this, the ego side.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.892
And a person can get paralyzed or he may become absolutely without any sensation in his body.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.892
These people, till they die they are very alert, their brain is very alert, despite the fact they have used their brain.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.892
Actually the nature is very balanced; they have used their brain, with their brain only they have achieved whatever they wanted to,

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.892
but their brain is alert, but their heart goes out, the balance comes in.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.892
But if you have used your heart too much, the left side as it is, too much of crying and weeping and this and that and all that,

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.892
you become – on the contrary your heart going out, your brain goes out. The balance is established.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.892
It’s surprising, that people said that in the mental hospital no use having a cardiogram.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.892
There’s no need because you don’t need it. Their heart is perfect.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.892
While they use their heart all the time, the brain goes out.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.892
And you become a brainless person or a gaga person, I don’t know all sorts of things that people get.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.892
So one has to understand that a balance is brought about by this position,

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.892
and that’s why Buddha has said “Keep in the center. Do not go to extremes”.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.892
When you go into extremes, this moves in the periphery.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.892
Supposing you are a thinker and you plan everything and you are meticulous, and this and that,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:53.892
you are thrown out of the way.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.892
Now, the extreme thing of this could create a very egoistical supra-conscious spirit in you.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:10.892
The one who we can cite was Mr. Hitler. Mr. Hitler was nothing else but a person who lived in the collective supra-conscious.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:17.892
And he charmed people by his collective consciousness – collective supra-consciousness.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:25.892
What he did is to talk so big and so nonsensical things, if you read his lectures you’ll be amazed,

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:34.892
that he said that: “We are the Germans, we are the special race, we are this and we should kill all these people”, and people believed it!

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.892
It was just a possession, a collective possession. I mean, if you talk to those Germans now, I read some articles written by them,

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.892
really they can’t understand, they said, “We were young people, we were studying, we were students, we were very good people,

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:57.892
and suddenly all this came up to us and he built us up as some sort of a martyr and all that, and we took to it”.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.892
He made it such a big religious stuff, I mean, a fanatic thing in their head, that they accepted it.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.892
This is the extreme case of fanaticism. All the fanatics are on this side. All of them are on this side.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.892
Any fanaticism I am facing. Keep away from them. They are headaches, they are bores, numbering bores.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.892
You just can’t talk to them. All the fanatics of the world if they were bores it’s all right,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.892
but they go much beyond that. Like you see Khomeini’s there. He is a good example of fanaticism.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:39.892
And what – I’m happy that Americans had a little experience of these fanatics. All fanatics catch all these people.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:46.892
These so-called Lutherans, and the so-called Pentecostal, they are nothing but they are all possessed people –

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.892
specially the Pentecostals are possessed, can’t you see them?

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.892
They are recluses, they are useless people, they are wasting themselves.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:01.892
All the spiritualists and all these people – they could be right-sided or left-sided.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:09.892
LSD takes you to the right side, because you start seeing the lights and all those hallucinations which are of the supra-conscious.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.892
Left-sided people who are there, they get into – they are all the time crying, weeping,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.892
diffident, sly type, intriguers, they are on the left hand side.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.892
But if you move too much on this side then you can also get possessed.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.892
You can get very badly possessed and this one, this movement is very painful.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.892
Is painful to the person. Because they aggress on the person.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:42.892
But if you have this kind, this type of movement on the right hand side, then you aggress others.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.892
Because this is done with the ego and this is done with the superego.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:58.892
So the person who has a left side problem is better in the society because he troubles himself, and he needs his own cure, and he is not a problem.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.892
But a person who is a egoist is such a problem that he doesn’t see, he doesn’t feel the pain of others and he gives pain to others.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.892
He talks in such a way that he hurts, and he has a very bad right Vishuddhi,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.892
and everything he does, all aggressiveness, all war and all these things are a right-sided man.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.892
And such a man can become very successful like Hitler, but ultimately he meets his doom

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:32.892
and nobody respects such a person ultimately. See, everything afterwards in history tells about the dirty things he was doing,

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.892
the sly things he was doing, or the bad things he was doing, how many he has killed,

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:44.892
what he did – everything comes out in history and he is just put into the light of history,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.892
and you start seeing that this man, who was supposed to be so successful,

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.892
“Oh, God, we do not want to know him”. One of the sahaja yogis came to Me,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.892
he told Me – he’s a French – he said, “Mother, please tell me if I was Napoleon. If I was don’t tell me,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:07.892
because then I will die”. I said, “Why?”. He said, “I feel that I’m very egoistical, after Realization

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.892
I find my ego is like this and I topple like that, and I can draw very well, and he used to draw.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:19.892
So if I was Napoleon don’t tell me, if I was don’t tell me, I will really commit suicide”.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.892
And in French, in French people if you call somebody a Napoleon, it’s a, it’s an abuse,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.892
you can imagine, Napoleon the great is being used as an abuse.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.892
So this is the thing that one has to understand, that ego-oriented person is over-disciplined,

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:43.892
may be military-like, he may not drink, smoke, you see, he may walk straight like a stick. But he is old.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.892
The other one might be indulging into all such things and he might be drinking too much,

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:54.892
and all the drunkards you find are on the left hand side. Poor things they start with a small thing.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.892
When they start it with a small thing they are driven onto this extreme, then they get caught up.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.892
Alcoholics are really, not that they drink, there’s some spirit in them that drinks.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.892
I met last time a lady from Cuba, she was a petite woman, small, thin woman, and her husband came

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.892
and told Me that she can take one whisky bottle neat! I said: “This little woman, how does she do it?!”.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.892
He said: “She does!”. And I asked her and she said: “Yes, Mother, I do”.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.892
I put her a bandhan and I found a horrible big personality in her.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.892
Horrible, tall, very hefty person. He said, “Mother, did you see that one?”.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.892
I said: “Yes, I did”. She said, “It is he who drinks, and I’m blamed”. She could see him also.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.892
Such people who are on the left side can see the spirits and the things walking in,

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:49.892
and they get all kinds of ESP experiences, and “I get a hunch” and all sorts of things – is little movement that side.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.892
And the right-sided people also can have such hunches as to what to do tomorrow,

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.892
and how to do it, and what will happen, they get all kinds of hunches.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.892
There are people who are getting photographs of the people, such people – one gentleman showed Me some photographs

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:16.892
which in an organization in (…). It’s a lady, she showed Me it’s taking out the photographs of all the horrible kings of England.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.892
As if they were dead, with their faces… it was surprising! It was surprising.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.892
And now thank God that organization is not getting any information, but it was a horrible thing, and

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.892
if you keep these photographs in your house you also get bad vibrations, you might get their spirits coming into you.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.892
In BBC the other day we saw a film where a man was possessed by a spirit of Van Gogh.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:47.892
I hope you know him, Van Gogh is the painter who paints in one line many colors like that, you see?

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.892
And this fellow was doing – actually I mean, we saw that with our own eyes – was painting just like Van Gogh.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.892
And he said that, “Van Gogh is doing this to me”.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.892
So all such things happen when you are on the left side – could be on the right side,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.892
for some artist may be on the right side. But this you can only find out with vibrations, which side you are possessed.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.892
Now I’ve told you why we have to have dharma, why we have to have Ten Commandments,

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.892
why we should be in our sustenance, so that we keep to the middle path of Sushumna,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:27.892
this center path of our evolution, and not to deviate too much to this side and not to deviate too much to that side.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:34.892
That’s the reason we had to have religions. But all religions have become fanatics. They are fanatics.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.892
So they are good for nothing, useless people.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.892
Absolutely on the contrary they have created so many sects and so many fightings that one can’t understand.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:49.892
Now, these great Incarnations have come on this earth, they all have come as one aspect.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.892
Christ has said “Those who are not against Me – with Me”.Who are those who are not against Him?

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.892
See, you didn’t even allow Him to talk! He had to fight for every-day life!

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.892
Same thing you did to Mohammed Sahib, the same thing you did to all the saints who came on this earth.

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.892
It’s not only Christ, you see the life of Socrates.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:18.892
You see the life of everyone who was like this, we had Sai Nath in India, was only hundred years back he must have died, only hundred years back.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.892
But if you see His life was a struggle! Nobody would listen to Him.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:30.892
At least there are some people here to listen to Me, but Sai Nath had about three or four disciples, that’s all.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.892
That is the sign that I must be a true Teacher, because if you have too much that means you are all mesmerized,

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:45.892
and thousands, fifty-thousand people are sitting there and somebody is throwing a red colour through a cannon and they are “ah!”, like mad.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:52.892
Is this God’s Realization? Is this spirituality? You are not to be mad people.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.892
You have to be aware, and specially alert. You become really aware,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.892
which is enlightened, your awareness has to be enlightened, you have to become that.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.892
Not to be like sheep, go there into any place, taken away anywhere – no, not that.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.892
So we have to awaken ourselves. We have to brighten ourselves and understand our responsibility.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:18.892
And we have to know that we are saints, we have come here to become our Spirits,

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.892
and the responsibility is very much great on the people of America.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:30.892
American saints have the greatest responsibility, though Sahaja Yoga has prospered so much in Australia. Most surprising.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.892
You condemned them as criminals, they went down there, they had children, grand-children,

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:44.892
and they have much less ego, much more wisdom, and that is the center of Mooladhara.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:51.892
That is the first center. Australia is the first center. And people are so wise, you won’t believe.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.892
I mean, there was not even a single seat left when I went there, and thousands of people,

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.892
the media was so sensible and so wise, and – I mean, there are seven cities

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:08.892
and all the seven cities have got centers in Sahaja Yoga. Just like villagers in India; they are so wise.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.892
As villagers in India are wise, they are that wise. And I don’t know what to say:

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.892
the persons who are supposed to be the complete wisdom here at this point, to be the witness,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.892
to be the sixteens – can you see here [points at Vishuddhi on chakra chart – ed], sub-sixteen, and I’ll talk about it next time,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.892
because I’ve told you about this center of Rama and then I’ll tell you about all these centers tomorrow, and above also.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:29.892
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:43.892
Now, if you have any questions, you ask Me. Warren: Do you have any questions?

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:57.892
Shri Mataji: Now. It’s alright. Now can I take out these fixations?. See now. Bugging, you see?

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:05.892
Warren: Yes. American special. “I’m learning some words!

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.892
Now address the questions to Me”. Warren says to somebody: “Yes. Just stand up and speak up”. A seeker asks a question).

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.892
Seeker: Why do some people lean more to the left side and others to the right side?

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.892
Shri Mataji: What’s it? Warren repeats: Why do some lean more to the left side and others lean more to the right side?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.892
Seeker: And some even in the center? Warren repeats: And some in the center?

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.892
Seeker: Is there a karmic patent or…? Warren: Is there a karmic patent, he says?

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.892
Shri Mataji: There is, you see, we are made of three gunas.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.892
And the permutations and combinations are there of these three gunas. Alright?

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:45.892
And those who are tamo gunis, more desires they have, the more sort of emotional they are, they are on the left side.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.892
Those who are ambitious, are on the right side. And those who are wiser are in the center.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.892
So it’s a temperament with which you are born. It has many reasons. It’s the background,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:05.892
it’s the things you have come out of it, and what was your education, how were your parents – I mean,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:12.892
so many things work it out, the personality. And these three gunas, tamo, rajo and sattwa gunas,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.892
these three qualities within us, work out permutations and combinations of all the people.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:26.892
And that’s how we have different type of people. And according to their style they move to one side or another.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:40.892
Alright? I will be talking about that also maybe if I have time, about tamo guna, rajo guna and sattwa guna.

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:50.892
(Lady seeker asks a question …“by balancing out of the sides”…) Shri Mataji: What’s she saying?

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:56.892
Warren repeats: Can you help people who are mentally sick, by balancing these two sides?

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.892
Shri Mataji: Of course! I have helped. And you have to help them.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.892
Lady seeker: Yes. I’m schizophrenic, that’s why I’m asking. Warren: Schizophrenia?

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:15.892
Shri Mataji: Of course. No doubt. But I hope the Americans won’t put Me in jail for saving these people!

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:24.892
My husband told Me, “Don’t touch anyone otherwise you’ll be in jail”. Of course I can. No doubt.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.892
Lady seeker: Could I learn it? Shri Mataji: What’s it? Warren: Can she learn? Lady seeker: Could I learn? Warren: Can she learn it?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:40.892
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, why not? You can. But first of all you get well. You have to be much stronger.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.892
You must learn all the ways and methods. Then you can of course, why not? Even My photograph does that.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:53.892
See, you don’t have to worry, you can use My photograph. If they don’t arrest Me for the photograph, it’s alright.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.892
They told Me you have to be a lawyer in this country to exist, I don’t know what (is that? – Barely audible) (laughter).

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.892
Warren: Yes? Shri Mataji: Yes? Seeker: Did She have a teacher?

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.892
Warren repeats: Did You have a teacher?

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:26.892
Shri Mataji: No. Seeker: No? (Somebody is heard muttering something like: “You hadn’t any teacher…” and goes on muttering)

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.892
Warren: Any other questions?

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.892
Shri Mataji: I’m born like this. I’m ancient. Antique. (laughter, She laughs) (The man from the public continues muttering)

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:43.892
Warren: Do you mind not disturbing please.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:48.892
Shri Mataji: Loudly. Whatever you say, say it loudly.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:52.892
Warren: Please, don’t disturb. If you’ve got a question specifically ask it, but don’t disturb.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.892
Shri Mataji: What did he say? Warren: He is just mumbling.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:05.892
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. You say it loudly, what did you say? (The person keeps talking lowly) Warren: No, no, he’s…Shri Mataji: What? Why? Yogi: He is a drunk.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.892
Warren: He is drunk, Mother. Shri Mataji: Is he?

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.892
Warren: Hm. Any other questions? Yes.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.892
A seeker: When everybody leaves, will we be able to continue in New York?

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.892
Warren repeats: When You leave, will they still be able to continue in New York and can learn how to grow?

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:31.892
Shri Mataji: Yes. You see, we have got somebody – Hermann has not come today, I don’t know – where is he gone, Hermann? (Warren: “He is working today”)

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:39.892
He is working today. And he has offered his place for working Sahaja Yoga. We – actually, you see,

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:47.892
we have imported people from London, who do not have houses here, and also he is from Australia.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.892
But Hermann said that he can offer his residence for the use of Sahaja Yoga to begin with, you see,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.892
because we don’t take any money, and you have to organize it yourself.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:05.892
And we have got here Christine, who is a very old Sahaja Yogini, and she can work it out.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.892
We have some other people also, who may be coming and going from Philadelphia,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:20.892
and you people could be here – I’ll also come back again if you call Me. Next year maybe. We all can go to India also.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:28.892
We are going to go to India…when? (Warren: “In…” Shri Mataji: “Eh?” Warren: “… December”) December.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.892
If you people want to come to India, we can take you down to India also, in December;

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.892
and we will have a program of about – how many days? Warren: About forty-five – fifty days.

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.892
Shri Mataji: About of forty-five – fifty days, we’ll be passing through villages and all that,

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.892
and that’s you mix up with other people, and learn about Sahaj Yog, is a very good way of learning about Sahaj Yog, you see,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.892
where you learn how to give Realization, and imbibe things, and it’s very good way.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:04.892
If you want you can come along and it is going to be quite cheap for you, only you have to pay for your food and for your travelling,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.892
that’s all, and food will be very cheaply arranged; and very good food, we can arrange that.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:17.892
And this time – last time they paid three pounds per day, this time they are going to pay four pounds per day.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:26.892
And everything can be done, we’ll go to different villages, and stay there and organize it.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:36.892
It’s not going to be any money-making proposition or anything, it’s a thing by which you go into simpler places and learn about Sahaj Yog.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:46.892
It’s better, because here, you see, it’s very quiet in this place, I feel, but otherwise in New York you have such a horrible, this signaling business, you know?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:55.892
And all the sounds – and the atmosphere is so much filled with funny sounds all over, and it’s horrifying.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.892
Warren: Mother, a lot of people have asked about the practices, how they learn the practices for Sahaja Yoga,

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:08.892
the various things they can do, that they have to do. And I think they should all know that you just come along to the group,

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:14.892
after Mother’s gone, and you’ll learn all these things. I too wanted to know how to do it,

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:18.892
as soon as I got my realization. Sometimes you are a little too keen to know…

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.892
Shri Mataji: But you can tell them how to give first of all protection to your aura.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.892
This gentleman told Me that his aura was – did get disturbed, it’s true, your aura gets disturbed.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:33.892
So you get first of all a method of first of all protecting your auras.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:43.892
And how to raise your Kundalini. This method I will teach you today. Alright? After realization. What else?

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:56.892
Warren: Yes. (A seeker asks one question: “When She talked of saving the creation… (Indistinct) Does She mean that the creation is lost?”)

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.892
Warren: The creation? (Seeker: “She said of saving the creation”.) Yes, I heard the first part. Does She mean…

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:11.892
(Seeker: “That the creation is lost, or…”- indistinct) (Warren repeats to Shri Mataji:) You spoke of saving the creation. He is asking, do You consider that the creation is lost?

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:22.892
Shri Mataji: May be, may be lost. It’s not yet lost but may be lost. You see, creation, the epitome of creation is you, is the human beings.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:31.892
Alright? If you are not saved, the creation is lost. You are to be saved. And God has to save it, it is His own creation.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:42.892
You are His creation. And He has to save it. (To Warren:) I mean, how did a drunkard come in?

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.892
Warren (to a seeker): Yes. (A seeker asks a question) Warren: Say again.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:56.892
Seeker: Does She consider the creation something apart from God? Or is the creation also God or what is it?

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.892
(Warren repeats:) Do You consider the creation something apart from God? Or is it also God or what is it?

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.892
Shri Mataji (laughing): Accha, now, you see, this is a subject which I have to deal with, alright?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.892
What is creation, what is God, how He created you, how we became human beings, it’s a big subject.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:20.892
And it’s to be handled sometime and you are to be told all about it. And I cannot just answer it in five minutes.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.892
But I will, it’s a good question and should come to you.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:30.892
But before knowing all these things and details about it, is better you get your light.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.892
Once you have your light, gradually you start understanding it. Alright?

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.892
Warren: Yes? Seeker: What is the meaning of Sahaja Yoga?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.892
Shri Mataji: Sahaja. Saha means with – ja means born. Is born with you, spontaneous. Sahaja means spontaneous.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:53.892
Whatever is living is spontaneous. You see, whatever happens spontaneously – we don’t understand the word of spontaneous also.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.892
Means a living, living expression, living manifestation is spontaneous, Sahaja. Is born with you.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.892
But today Sahaja has gone into the stage called as Maha-Yoga. Means it has become a en-masse.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:15.892
It works en-masse. Before it used to work in one person, two persons, you see – like one flower becoming a fruit in the beginning of the tree.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.892
But today the situation is such that thousands can get realization. It’s Maha-Yoga.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.892
Sahaja Yoga has matured into Maha-Yoga. Maha means the great.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:30.892
(Aside to Warren): I hope he is back – I hope he doesn’t do something to Arneau. Warren: No, the caretaker is outside.
