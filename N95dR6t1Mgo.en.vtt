00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.499
Today we have gathered here on the right occasion

00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:29.541
and very auspicious day to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:37.041
Shri Ganesha is the first Deity that was created

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:45.624
so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness,

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:55.875
with peace, bliss, and spirituality.

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:04.708
He is the source.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:11.583
He’s the source of spirituality.

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:19.749
As a result of that all other things follow.

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:25.624
Like when it rains and is windy

00:03:25.624 --> 00:03:29.583
you feel a coolness in the atmosphere.

00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:39.624
In the same way when Shri Ganesha emits His Power

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:45.583
we feel all these three things within and without.

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:56.791
But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West,

00:03:56.791 --> 00:04:07.499
that the most important fundamental Deity

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:11.499
has been completely not only neglected,

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:15.583
but insulted and crucified.

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:22.041
So today though I did not want to say anything

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:28.499
to upset you people, but I must tell you

00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:35.916
that worshiping Shri Ganesha means there has to be

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:38.708
a thorough cleansing within you.

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.458
When you worship Shri Ganesha

00:04:44.624 --> 00:04:50.583
keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean,

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.708
keep your being clean -

00:04:53.708 --> 00:04:58.791
no thoughts of lust and greed should come up.

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:02.875
Actually when the Kundalini rises

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:06.791
Ganesha had to be awakened within us,

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:09.458
the innocence has to come up –

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:19.791
which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us.

00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:27.583
If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand

00:05:27.624 --> 00:05:33.000
that we have to mature.

00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:40.583
People are sick now.

00:05:40.624 --> 00:05:45.666
All over the western life one feels they are sick.

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:50.958
Sick because they have never recognized Shri Ganesha.

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:58.541
If one Freud came that doesn’t mean that you should accept him.

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:06.624
But you did - as if it was such an important thing to be done;

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.791
there was nothing more important than that.

00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:23.708
So today we are faced with our power of ascent

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:28.000
and the power of conditionings we have had.

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:30.916
When Freud talks of conditioning he didn’t know

00:06:30.958 --> 00:06:34.000
he was putting another type of horrid conditionings on you,

00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:35.041
terrible.

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:46.000
Sex is not important for human beings at all,

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:50.916
is not at all important.

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:57.041
It is only when you want to have children

00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:59.916
actually a human being

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.624
who is of the highest level will indulge into a sex.

00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:09.624
The lure, the romance, this nonsense and all that

00:07:09.624 --> 00:07:14.583
doesn’t exist in a pure mind; it’s all a human creation.

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:28.583
And this servility one has to that is so much surprising,

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:35.916
it comes from a very low grading within us.

00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:41.583
It comes from the low-graded human beings

00:07:46.666 --> 00:07:50.541
that one becomes servile to it.

00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:53.791
You should be the master of that.

00:07:57.624 --> 00:08:01.624
And today when I see around Myself, in the West,

00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:04.791
which is also part and parcel of the same creation,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:15.583
so much of sickness that has come, I am really aghast,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.499
how to turn your attention now to the maturity of sex.

00:08:24.833 --> 00:08:29.583
When the sex matures you become a father, a mother,

00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:32.749
and a pure personality.

00:08:36.666 --> 00:08:39.916
When you hear about a ninety-year old woman

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.749
marrying a nineteen-year old boy,

00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:43.583
I mean, you just don’t understand,

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:48.624
this is - what sort of a society it has been created in this world,

00:08:48.624 --> 00:08:53.833
this kind of a stupid behaviour?

00:08:54.541 --> 00:08:56.624
We have to mature ourselves.

00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.541
That doesn’t mean I’m saying austerity at young age,

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:11.000
that doesn’t mean that. Another absurdity is that.

00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:14.499
But of course you must mature;

00:09:14.499 --> 00:09:16.666
you need a tapasya for that.

00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:22.833
Unimportant thing when become important

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:28.791
and such unimportant thing that they’re just like anything

00:09:28.833 --> 00:09:30.624
that we have, like we have hair.

00:09:30.624 --> 00:09:34.749
Even if you lose hair it means something.

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:39.000
But if you lose sex, what’s wrong with it? It’s very good.

00:09:39.041 --> 00:09:42.541
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:45.624
Such a waste of energy.

00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:55.958
So much interest, so much of a precious attention,

00:09:55.958 --> 00:09:59.041
so much of auspiciousness is spent

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.958
in this kind of a nonsensical thing.

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:09.708
So to worship Ganesha one has to understand

00:10:09.708 --> 00:10:10.749
we have to mature.

00:10:13.708 --> 00:10:15.958
Maturity has to come within us.

00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:23.666
We have to go deeper within ourselves;

00:10:23.708 --> 00:10:29.875
our attention has to go deeper within ourselves, spontaneously.

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:36.624
How do we achieve the depth if we are still like worms?

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:46.708
Otherwise it’s a great sort of a sacrifice

00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:51.708
or a pressure on people.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.749
These tags and these pressures have been very costly

00:11:01.749 --> 00:11:04.833
for you people, very costly.

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:07.875
You have paid through so much;

00:11:09.541 --> 00:11:13.458
you have gone through so much. For what?

00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:25.041
So the priorities have to change

00:11:25.041 --> 00:11:27.916
if Shri Ganesha is to be worshipped.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.791
What are we worshipping today is the innocence within us.

00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:41.541
We are worshipping that is auspicious, which is innocent.

00:11:44.791 --> 00:11:48.833
Innocence, which is deep down within us - that’s our character,

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.666
that’s our nature, that’s what we are born with –

00:11:54.458 --> 00:12:00.791
is the basic of this whole Creation;

00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:06.749
is the essence of this Creation.

00:12:10.666 --> 00:12:15.499
So when matter becomes active, all right, reproduction starts,

00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:21.499
animal stage comes in, then comes the stage of human beings

00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:24.000
who are primitive, then comes the stage

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.749
where human beings are developed.

00:12:27.791 --> 00:12:32.499
Not the way what we understand of the developed world, horrible.

00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:35.666
I’ll never call them developed by any chance at all.

00:12:36.624 --> 00:12:39.458
What is development is not outside.

00:12:39.499 --> 00:12:42.916
What is the within development one has to see.

00:12:42.958 --> 00:12:45.916
What have we grown inside?

00:12:48.583 --> 00:12:51.708
What have we got inside ourselves?

00:12:53.791 --> 00:13:00.624
Anything that gross, big, is plastic, of that kind.

00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:05.666
The one which hasn’t got any inner power grown,

00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:08.041
say, for example, I give you a mango.

00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:09.749
I said, “All right, now you eat it.”

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:14.916
And you see it just has the cover and nothing inside it,

00:13:14.916 --> 00:13:19.958
what will you eat? Will you eat that plastic?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.958
Anything that grown like that is plastic, is dead.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.666
What is the substance inside, let’s see.

00:13:38.708 --> 00:13:41.583
What is our substance within ourselves?

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:50.791
This is what Christ preached – morality point.

00:13:51.833 --> 00:13:54.916
So important for Him it was.

00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:59.041
Because after dharma, which was a balance,

00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:02.583
where of course morality is very important,

00:14:02.958 --> 00:14:09.916
but it was necessary for Christ to talk of the innate,

00:14:09.916 --> 00:14:15.000
deeper morality, which is a part and parcel of a being,

00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:18.833
it is not just taught, or told, or frightened

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:21.791
because there’s a fear of God and wrath of God.

00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:25.458
But it should be your own innate light,

00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:28.583
that’s why Christ talked about it.

00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:39.708
And the same Christ was used to demolish innocence.

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:49.458
And I would not say that people were not warned.

00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:52.041
Freud was not the only person who was born.

00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:58.791
The other day I went to Prado in Spain

00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:03.000
and I saw paintings after paintings of the hell.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.041
And all these modern times we see those lanky pankies

00:15:07.458 --> 00:15:10.041
going around without clothes, sort of people were shown

00:15:10.458 --> 00:15:12.958
with all kind of funny things, stupid things they were doing.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.875
This was Bosch. I was surprised, a German, Bosch,

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:20.583
who showed all this nonsense there, very clearly - way to hell,

00:15:20.624 --> 00:15:23.624
then the attack of the death, all these things.

00:15:24.041 --> 00:15:26.916
I mean he was quite a recent person.

00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:34.749
If you call Blake as a madcap, so what about Bosch?

00:15:34.749 --> 00:15:39.541
Everybody’s a madcap, except for the stupid useless people.

00:15:42.666 --> 00:15:50.499
So much warning has come for us. For example, we can say,

00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:53.458
since long we know about hell.

00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:57.833
Mahavira of all the persons wrote so clearly about hell.

00:15:57.875 --> 00:16:00.666
This is hell.

00:16:06.541 --> 00:16:14.833
But in the West the priorities are absolutely upside down.

00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:22.458
What is your power? Just think of it. Think within yourself.

00:16:22.499 --> 00:16:25.666
Is it mental power that’s important?

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:28.666
I have told you mental power has nothing to do,

00:16:28.708 --> 00:16:31.958
because it is just linear, it moves in one direction, falls off,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000
comes back to you. It has no substance in it.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.749
It’s just a mind projection, plastic.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.791
What is your emotional power?

00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:57.041
Emotions that you have takes you where?

00:16:59.666 --> 00:17:03.833
See you have emotions for, even good emotions you have.

00:17:03.916 --> 00:17:07.541
Say, you love your wife very much.

00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:11.583
Where does it take you?

00:17:11.624 --> 00:17:16.541
There was a poet called Tulsidasa who loved his wife very much

00:17:16.541 --> 00:17:18.916
and she had gone to her mother’s place.

00:17:19.916 --> 00:17:26.458
So he couldn’t bear it and went to see her

00:17:26.499 --> 00:17:33.749
and he climbed over to her balcony and she got a fright.

00:17:33.791 --> 00:17:34.749
She said, “How did you climb?”

00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:36.833
He said, “You had put a rope there.” She said, “No.”

00:17:36.875 --> 00:17:39.583
And they saw it was a big snake hanging.

00:17:41.749 --> 00:17:45.541
So she said, “The amount of love you have for me,

00:17:45.541 --> 00:17:47.916
if you have that for God, where will you be?”

00:17:53.833 --> 00:17:57.624
So where does these emotions take you - to frustration,

00:17:57.666 --> 00:18:00.833
to unhappiness, to our destruction.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:07.875
The mental power gives you a horrible thing called ego,

00:18:07.875 --> 00:18:10.583
which destroys others.

00:18:10.583 --> 00:18:12.833
And the emotional power gives you

00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:18.000
nothing but crying, weeping, and always feeling unhappy,

00:18:18.041 --> 00:18:21.791
“Oh, I have done so much of emotional investment

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:24.833
on such and such person and what did I get?”

00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:34.624
So it is not absolute, it’s relative.

00:18:35.958 --> 00:18:39.458
And mentally you are zero if you cannot destroy others.

00:18:39.499 --> 00:18:42.583
Emotionally you are zero

00:18:42.624 --> 00:18:50.583
because you cannot overpower people with your emotions.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.499
So what is your power? Where does your power lie?

00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:08.666
It lies in the Spirit. But even before the Spirit is achieved,

00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:14.875
what is your power? Is Kundalini? She’s sleeping.

00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:17.958
Then what is your power?

00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:23.791
Is your chastity.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.458
If a man is chaste, chaste temperament he has

00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:44.041
and he stands up in his chastity, it acts, it works.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.458
But first of all chastity pays dividend in your good health.

00:20:00.458 --> 00:20:02.624
From the face of a person you can say

00:20:02.666 --> 00:20:04.833
that this person is a chaste man.

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:15.624
Like in our Shastras used to say a Saint or a brahmachari,

00:20:15.624 --> 00:20:17.916
the one who has never had sex in life,

00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:20.624
always shining on his face.

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:25.958
And as we say that the greatest brahmachari was Shri Krishna

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.499
who has so many wives.

00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:40.624
Because no wastage of energy, no wastage of attention is on that.

00:20:40.624 --> 00:20:43.041
So the whole energy is inside.

00:20:43.458 --> 00:20:46.958
I will say today as I was coming by car it was raining,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.833
it was windy, it was very cold, but we were in the car,

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:59.541
nothing affected us, because we were quite warm inside the car,

00:20:59.541 --> 00:21:03.541
ourselves. We passed through everything, nothing touched us,

00:21:03.583 --> 00:21:09.916
nothing bothered us, we came away, everything fine. How?

00:21:09.916 --> 00:21:15.041
Because we kept to our own vehicle

00:21:15.041 --> 00:21:19.833
and the vehicle we have is our chastity.

00:21:24.583 --> 00:21:27.499
We are so particular that others must respect us,

00:21:27.541 --> 00:21:31.541
other must give us homage, otherwise we get into tempers.

00:21:34.958 --> 00:21:41.958
Did you respect yourself? Do you respect yourself?

00:21:47.791 --> 00:21:50.916
It sounds sometimes to people in the West

00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:56.916
that Mother is very trying to preach about Indian culture.

00:21:56.916 --> 00:21:59.916
Many people think that way.

00:22:01.916 --> 00:22:06.041
But I say that one has to learn science from the West.

00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:10.583
All right. One has to learn other things from the West,

00:22:10.624 --> 00:22:13.666
aesthetics, of course.

00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:19.541
Paintings and art, maybe, colour schemes.

00:22:21.624 --> 00:22:24.583
But culture you better learn from Indians.

00:22:29.666 --> 00:22:33.583
There’s dearth of culture, no culture at all, I find.

00:22:34.958 --> 00:22:39.749
What is this culture where a woman is supposed to expose her body?

00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:45.041
Is a prostitute’s culture, simple as that. Face it up.

00:22:55.791 --> 00:23:00.000
Where a woman is not supposed to respect her private parts

00:23:00.041 --> 00:23:05.499
is no culture whatsoever in the aesthetics of the Divine.

00:23:08.583 --> 00:23:15.499
So much so today that they are making a film showing Mary

00:23:15.499 --> 00:23:20.833
to be a prostitute. I mean, this is where you have ended up.

00:23:21.583 --> 00:23:26.708
In India even if you say this they’ll beat you nicely - anyone,

00:23:26.749 --> 00:23:28.875
whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian.

00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:34.916
I mean, shocking to hear that the way they talk about Christ.

00:23:34.916 --> 00:23:37.875
I mean, to an Indian it gives a shock.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:44.458
How can you talk because once you give up your chastity

00:23:44.499 --> 00:23:49.541
you can not understand that there can be someone

00:23:49.541 --> 00:23:51.916
who is absolutely chaste.

00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:55.541
For a thief everybody is a thief.

00:23:59.916 --> 00:24:04.624
Because you don’t have that respect for your chastity

00:24:04.624 --> 00:24:08.666
you can not imagine what Christ could have been.

00:24:08.666 --> 00:24:10.791
You can not imagine, you can not accept.

00:24:14.749 --> 00:24:17.958
Unbearable things are said about Christ.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.541
I tell you, unbearable, I don’t know.

00:24:20.583 --> 00:24:27.958
I’ve faced His crucifixion, which was unbearable as it was.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.499
But this kind of a thing you say about somebody;

00:24:32.499 --> 00:24:36.749
to an Indian woman if you pass such a remark,

00:24:36.749 --> 00:24:39.708
to an Indian ordinary woman, she would commit suicide.

00:24:52.541 --> 00:24:55.666
Is never said that anybody comes and says,

00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:57.708
“You looking very beautiful.” It’s all right,

00:24:57.749 --> 00:24:59.833
you can say to your mother, “you’re looking nice,” is all right,

00:25:00.749 --> 00:25:02.833
that’s different. But you don’t say to any woman like that.

00:25:12.791 --> 00:25:16.000
You have to turn yourself out.

00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:22.624
And this is one of the reasons why

00:25:22.624 --> 00:25:25.624
people are very hot-tempered.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.791
The magnet within you is Shri Ganesha.

00:25:38.791 --> 00:25:41.666
Many people know that I have a great sense of direction.

00:25:41.708 --> 00:25:44.958
That comes through this magnet which is perfect.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:53.541
This magnet is the one which keeps you sticking or adjusted

00:25:53.541 --> 00:25:58.583
or all the time pointed towards Spirit.

00:25:58.583 --> 00:26:05.708
If you don’t have the sense of chastity you will dangle this way,

00:26:05.749 --> 00:26:08.791
that way. Suddenly you become a very good Sahaja Yogi,

00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:10.000
tomorrow you become a devil –

00:26:11.624 --> 00:26:17.708
because there’s nothing that keeps you binding

00:26:20.958 --> 00:26:29.749
to the great idea of the Spirit. Let us face it up.

00:26:29.791 --> 00:26:32.875
Now the time has come for all of us, all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:26:34.749 --> 00:26:39.583
that the greatest thing within us is not sex, but is chastity.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.624
And that’s what will mature you.

00:26:58.666 --> 00:27:03.916
It’s very amazing how some people were behaving in Bordi,

00:27:03.916 --> 00:27:06.041
I came to know about it, I was amazed,

00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:10.458
how could they behave like this before the villagers of Bordi,

00:27:10.458 --> 00:27:12.541
who are innocent, simple people?

00:27:17.666 --> 00:27:22.583
But the best part of it that when you indulge into frivolous

00:27:22.624 --> 00:27:28.708
and nonsensical behaviour, insulting your chastity,

00:27:28.749 --> 00:27:31.916
you really lag in the action of it.

00:27:34.458 --> 00:27:37.041
Like, if you fritter away your petrol, your car can’t move,

00:27:37.041 --> 00:27:39.041
it’s like that, something happens to you.

00:27:43.624 --> 00:27:45.875
All the time you go on pinching people

00:27:45.875 --> 00:27:49.624
and frivolously talking to each other and to,

00:27:49.666 --> 00:27:52.583
what is the need to do all these, I just don’t understand.

00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:55.000
And then end up in the divorce case.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.041
Once I had gone to a Selfridges,

00:27:59.458 --> 00:28:01.541
I must tell you a very interesting story.

00:28:01.541 --> 00:28:06.041
And in such a crowd there were two people, man and woman,

00:28:06.458 --> 00:28:07.833
kissing each other all the time,

00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:09.791
least bothered there are other people

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:12.749
who are also going on the same escalator.

00:28:12.749 --> 00:28:16.708
Escalator they were kissing, in the thing they were kissing,

00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:19.958
I mean, torturing all the Indians who were there

00:28:19.958 --> 00:28:23.624
or maybe the other people, Chinese, for example, Egyptians.

00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:32.000
Such an exhibition going on. And I saw them next time.

00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:35.624
They were not kissing.

00:28:35.666 --> 00:28:36.749
I said, “What happened?”

00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:38.541
“We are divorced.”

00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:43.541
I said, “Why were you kissing that day so much?”

00:28:43.583 --> 00:28:46.875
So they said, “Because we were going to be divorced,

00:28:46.916 --> 00:28:49.499
so wanted to have the last bit of it.”

00:28:50.749 --> 00:28:55.624
What a level it is. Imagine what a level. What love,

00:28:55.624 --> 00:29:00.624
what feeling you have for anyone, nothing of the kind.

00:29:04.749 --> 00:29:06.791
All the time quarrelling with each other,

00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:14.000
ending up in the divorce cases and showing off all this.

00:29:14.041 --> 00:29:19.666
Any deep personality doesn’t show these things outside.

00:29:19.666 --> 00:29:24.583
Of course, I’m told here that here in the public school it is said

00:29:24.583 --> 00:29:26.916
that you should never show your emotions outside.

00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:31.499
But otherwise you can show anything else,

00:29:31.499 --> 00:29:36.499
ridiculous or shameless. But not your emotions.

00:29:37.875 --> 00:29:40.875
What an absurd place it is.

00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:48.666
You have accepted all these values

00:29:50.458 --> 00:29:52.916
just like sheep, without thinking about it.

00:29:58.791 --> 00:30:02.458
Like I was in France, one girl came and she was crying.

00:30:02.458 --> 00:30:04.666
She said, “I will - horrid, horrid,

00:30:04.708 --> 00:30:08.749
I will never go to these psychologists.”

00:30:08.791 --> 00:30:10.499
So I said, “Why?”

00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:12.916
“They were saying dirty things about my father.”

00:30:14.041 --> 00:30:15.916
Imagine.

00:30:19.875 --> 00:30:23.833
And people accepted those ideas of this horrible Freud.

00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:31.708
Is basically wrong. Whether it is historically they are,

00:30:31.749 --> 00:30:33.583
or whatever it is, you better give it up.

00:30:35.041 --> 00:30:40.958
Whatever wrong is wrong, in the Divine.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Whatever is right is right, in the Divine.

00:30:48.749 --> 00:30:52.666
But there’s a real objection now,

00:30:52.666 --> 00:30:54.916
that people when they go abroad,

00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:58.541
husband and wife and this and that, they kiss each other

00:30:58.583 --> 00:31:00.458
and tease each other. What is the need?

00:31:01.458 --> 00:31:03.875
You kiss the person and come and tell Me against that person,

00:31:03.875 --> 00:31:11.958
I’ve seen it. If there has to be some self-preservation,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.708
this has to be your chastity, your privacy.

00:31:17.958 --> 00:31:21.666
That’s why you have no willpower to do anything, no willpower.

00:31:21.666 --> 00:31:24.458
Let some stupid fellow come and tell you something,

00:31:24.458 --> 00:31:27.791
you’ll say, “All right. We accept.”

00:31:31.499 --> 00:31:35.666
What is the essence of your personality – is your chastity.

00:31:38.958 --> 00:31:42.624
And in Sahaja Yoga you can re-establish everything

00:31:42.624 --> 00:31:45.499
whatever you have lost, you can.

00:31:45.958 --> 00:31:48.749
That’s why the depth is lacking.

00:31:54.958 --> 00:31:58.791
And this is the reason there is no consistency

00:31:58.833 --> 00:32:03.666
in the temperament of people, no consistency.

00:32:05.875 --> 00:32:09.916
Now you’ll get twelve hundred people for My lecture

00:32:09.958 --> 00:32:13.541
and next day not even one, all lost.

00:32:14.458 --> 00:32:17.875
Because there’s no base, you know. Like a loose connection.

00:32:19.499 --> 00:32:24.458
There’s no connection, connection point is your chastity.

00:32:26.916 --> 00:32:31.041
So there is no consistency, sthaapayati is not there.

00:32:32.833 --> 00:32:35.541
If you tell them, “You have to get up in the morning,

00:32:35.583 --> 00:32:40.833
have a bath, do some puja,” it’s too much for them.

00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:54.791
But if you tell, say an Indian ladies or Me, if you say that

00:32:54.791 --> 00:32:56.833
“that you wear such and such dress,”

00:32:56.875 --> 00:33:03.541
I just can’t, I just can’t, no, not possible. Is not possible.

00:33:03.541 --> 00:33:06.583
I can keep the whole night awake,

00:33:06.624 --> 00:33:09.000
but that thing I can not do, just cannot do it.

00:33:11.833 --> 00:33:15.958
So the priorities are changed because where is your attention.

00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:23.000
You have everything within you.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.791
You are the storehouse of chastity, which is your power.

00:33:28.791 --> 00:33:33.791
Everything within you, nothing has gone out, it’s all there.

00:33:33.791 --> 00:33:40.458
All that fragrance is within you. Is all preserved,

00:33:40.458 --> 00:33:45.499
don’t condemn yourself. And you are so fortunate

00:33:45.499 --> 00:33:47.749
I’m here to tell you all about it.

00:33:47.791 --> 00:33:50.875
You are so fortunate I am with you.

00:33:50.916 --> 00:33:53.000
Do you understand that point?

00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:57.000
You don’t have to go to Himalayas;

00:33:57.041 --> 00:33:59.875
you don’t have to stand on your heads.

00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:05.041
You don’t have to do anything like that.

00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:10.499
You see, formerly these saints used to sit, you know,

00:34:10.499 --> 00:34:16.749
you won’t believe, in the cold frozen water or on the Himalayas

00:34:16.749 --> 00:34:20.791
in the open they used to sit for hours together

00:34:20.833 --> 00:34:25.749
Now that’s not necessary.

00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:30.791
It’s all made very easy. But change your priorities now.

00:34:34.749 --> 00:34:38.875
The whole attention once goes to your own Spirit

00:34:38.916 --> 00:34:46.666
you’ll be surprised the whole chart will change.

00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:52.958
What’s the most important thing? To meditate every day.

00:34:55.624 --> 00:34:58.958
I have seen people who want to do some course, say, for example,

00:34:58.958 --> 00:35:00.833
I told that “You better do some course.”

00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:05.000
Every day they will go for that course and join that class

00:35:05.041 --> 00:35:08.708
and they will work it out and they’ll pass that course

00:35:08.708 --> 00:35:12.499
and do it up and finish it.

00:35:12.499 --> 00:35:16.499
But meditation they cannot do regularly.

00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:25.541
But now there’s a little gap you should understand,

00:35:26.708 --> 00:35:36.749
that once we get the inkling of that joy which is eternal,

00:35:38.458 --> 00:35:41.708
we start moving towards that more and more,

00:35:41.749 --> 00:35:44.958
more and more and establishing ourselves

00:35:44.958 --> 00:35:47.958
in the ocean of that joy.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.541
A little. You see, when somebody wants you to swim,

00:35:54.583 --> 00:35:58.833
you are frightened, you don’t want to do it,

00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:01.791
you are very happy on the gross shore,

00:36:01.833 --> 00:36:05.833
you don’t want to swim. Somebody pushes you,

00:36:05.875 --> 00:36:08.624
again you are back, “No, baba, I can not do it.”

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:13.708
But once you learn to swim you enjoy that swimming.

00:36:14.875 --> 00:36:18.000
And when you like it then you want to do it every day,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.583
regularly, religiously.

00:36:22.666 --> 00:36:27.833
So there’s a little gap, which has to be achieved.

00:36:27.875 --> 00:36:33.875
Second point is that as I’ve been always saying,

00:36:33.916 --> 00:36:37.875
you are lotuses, but under a mire.

00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:40.624
And you know what mire is,

00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:47.833
while India is the ocean, so it’s very easy for the lotuses

00:36:47.833 --> 00:36:50.791
to come out of the water.

00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:54.666
But to come out of the mire is very difficult.

00:36:58.541 --> 00:37:01.666
Say, somebody falls in the mire.

00:37:02.583 --> 00:37:05.499
If you kick it, you go deeper.

00:37:05.499 --> 00:37:08.458
If you try to do anything you go deeper.

00:37:08.499 --> 00:37:12.541
Best thing is to keep watching it and still.

00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:16.916
And that’s the best way – is to witness yourself.

00:37:16.958 --> 00:37:20.583
But your attention is not all right, how will you witness?

00:37:20.583 --> 00:37:23.499
Attention is: somebody’s going that side –

00:37:23.499 --> 00:37:25.875
that person you’ll see. Another person going that –

00:37:25.875 --> 00:37:28.458
that person you’ll see, must see every person.

00:37:29.749 --> 00:37:34.708
But you don’t see the flowers, you don’t see the trees,

00:37:34.749 --> 00:37:38.583
you don’t see the Mother Earth, you don’t see anything.

00:37:38.583 --> 00:37:47.583
What you see is something hopelessly bad, worse than you.

00:37:52.791 --> 00:37:55.749
Today is the day they say one should not see the moon.

00:37:57.041 --> 00:38:00.833
If you see the moon it becomes inauspicious

00:38:00.833 --> 00:38:03.624
and you get a bad name. They say Shri Krishna saw the moon

00:38:03.624 --> 00:38:07.499
and then He got a bad name; He was ranchordas,

00:38:07.541 --> 00:38:09.875
means He had to run away from the battlefield.

00:38:09.875 --> 00:38:11.875
But that was His trick, He had to run away.

00:38:11.916 --> 00:38:13.583
So you are not supposed to see the moon.

00:38:13.583 --> 00:38:15.916
The reason is, why it is said,

00:38:15.916 --> 00:38:18.624
that today we have to see Shri Ganesh,

00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:20.958
who is the Mother Earth,

00:38:22.499 --> 00:38:24.000
who acts through Mother Earth.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.916
Most of the things that we have are from the Mother Earth.

00:38:31.583 --> 00:38:33.875
So this time you must see the Mother Earth,

00:38:33.875 --> 00:38:40.499
the Kundalini and Shri Ganesh, today.

00:38:41.624 --> 00:38:45.833
The Mother Earth has created Shri Ganesha.

00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:50.458
So you don’t see anything outside, you don’t even see the moon.

00:38:50.499 --> 00:38:53.833
Just see the Mother Earth.

00:39:02.791 --> 00:39:06.041
Because the Mother Earth in Her love

00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:09.791
and compassion has done so much for us,

00:39:09.791 --> 00:39:12.666
your Kundalini has done so much for you.

00:39:15.624 --> 00:39:20.791
And Her Son, Who is the innocence within us,

00:39:20.791 --> 00:39:27.041
is to be worshipped today because He has done the maximum.

00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:32.041
Despite all the insults we have put on Him, all the ridicule,

00:39:32.458 --> 00:39:36.541
all the filth, all kinds of nonsense,

00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:40.666
still He stands up like a little child to amuse us.

00:39:47.666 --> 00:39:50.833
If Shri Ganesha is within you become like a child,

00:39:50.875 --> 00:39:56.791
childlike innocence, you don’t get angry with somebody

00:39:56.833 --> 00:39:59.875
like a dog barks; there are some Sahaja Yogis I know

00:39:59.916 --> 00:40:04.458
who all the time barking, just like dogs or beggars in India.

00:40:09.541 --> 00:40:13.833
But you become like a child who is very sweet,

00:40:13.875 --> 00:40:16.749
who always tries to amuse you,

00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:19.749
always tries to say nice things,

00:40:19.791 --> 00:40:25.458
always tries to make you feel happy. The source of such joy.

00:40:29.541 --> 00:40:33.749
And that’s how you become a source of joy,

00:40:33.791 --> 00:40:39.749
source of happiness, source of fulfilment.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.916
All the time bubbling with laughter and happiness,

00:40:47.958 --> 00:40:55.499
bubbling with beautiful things. How the children amuse you,

00:40:55.499 --> 00:40:57.583
just see and watch.

00:40:57.583 --> 00:41:01.916
How they come round with little-little hands,

00:41:01.958 --> 00:41:04.000
how they work it out.

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:10.791
How they know what is the right thing.

00:41:10.791 --> 00:41:14.624
A child who is a Realized soul is much more sensible

00:41:14.624 --> 00:41:16.833
than a grown up person, I’ve seen that.

00:41:19.458 --> 00:41:22.833
Like My youngest granddaughter was about, I think,

00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:28.791
three years of age and the maid was folding My sari

00:41:28.791 --> 00:41:32.458
and by mistake she put it on the ground.

00:41:32.458 --> 00:41:37.499
This child just couldn’t bear it. She just lifted the sari,

00:41:37.499 --> 00:41:41.666
put it to her head and put it on the sofa.

00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:44.624
She said, “What you mean by putting this sari on the ground,

00:41:44.666 --> 00:41:46.583
what you do know about my Grandmother?

00:41:46.624 --> 00:41:49.000
She is the Goddess of Goddesses

00:41:49.041 --> 00:41:51.791
and you put Her sari on the ground.

00:41:53.041 --> 00:41:59.666
The dogs are going to bite you now,” she said, “Be careful.”

00:41:59.708 --> 00:42:03.791
And she again went and put the sari, kissed it and kissed it

00:42:03.791 --> 00:42:07.624
and said, “Mother, forgive her, Grandmother, please,

00:42:07.666 --> 00:42:11.541
forgive this woman, she doesn’t know what she’s done to You”.

00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:25.708
But that sensitivity comes from the depth of your chastity.

00:42:32.666 --> 00:42:34.916
You listen to the children and you’ll be amazed

00:42:34.916 --> 00:42:38.875
how they talk and what they say, how they behave,

00:42:38.916 --> 00:42:42.499
how they try to amuse you. I mean,

00:42:42.499 --> 00:42:44.624
in the West children are very much spoiled, I must say,

00:42:44.624 --> 00:42:47.041
they do not amuse you so much, they trouble you quite a lot.

00:42:48.875 --> 00:42:53.458
Because again, again the same thing.

00:42:54.749 --> 00:42:57.499
If the father and mother don’t have chastity,

00:42:57.541 --> 00:43:02.749
the children don’t feel all right, they don’t feel peaceful,

00:43:02.791 --> 00:43:05.583
they’ll become restless, and then they develop

00:43:05.624 --> 00:43:07.833
the same restlessness within themselves.

00:43:07.875 --> 00:43:12.916
A chaste man can never get possessed, take it from Me,

00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:21.458
can never get possessed. You might be very intelligent,

00:43:21.458 --> 00:43:23.916
you might be anything, you might be a great writer,

00:43:23.958 --> 00:43:26.958
but you can get possessed. But a chaste man,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.749
an ordinary chaste person can never get possessed.

00:43:29.749 --> 00:43:31.666
Bhoots are afraid of chaste people.

00:43:31.666 --> 00:43:35.541
If one chaste person is going on the road, all the bhoots run away.

00:43:39.666 --> 00:43:44.791
They just run away. At least I’ve known many cases

00:43:44.791 --> 00:43:48.458
but some of them I can tell you,

00:43:48.458 --> 00:43:54.541
that there were three of them,

00:43:54.583 --> 00:44:03.916
who used to go by motorcycle in the night

00:44:03.958 --> 00:44:05.958
about twelve o’clock on a road.

00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:14.791
And some people who were possessed wrote letters to Me,

00:44:14.791 --> 00:44:21.583
saying that “Please don’t allow them to go there in the night,

00:44:21.583 --> 00:44:23.833
because where should we go and stay?”

00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:29.000
I was amazed. These are the people

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.666
who were possessed by some sort of horrible bhoots

00:44:31.666 --> 00:44:34.875
who used to go and rest on these trees in the night

00:44:34.875 --> 00:44:38.041
where these three persons used to go on the motorcycle

00:44:38.458 --> 00:44:40.791
and they actually wrote letters to Me.

00:44:40.791 --> 00:44:43.666
Very possessed people, I knew them, saying that,

00:44:43.666 --> 00:44:47.875
“Ask them not to go that way, because where are we to live?”

00:44:49.499 --> 00:44:53.000
And they were like mad, mad people themselves.

00:44:53.041 --> 00:44:55.000
I said, “Why did you write like this?”

00:44:55.041 --> 00:44:59.000
They said, “These people go that way and they trouble us.”

00:45:06.708 --> 00:45:13.916
And the negative within us disappears

00:45:13.958 --> 00:45:16.875
with the light of Shri Ganesha.

00:45:21.458 --> 00:45:24.666
You can see it so clearly in another person.

00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:29.499
If you don’t have chastity you can never see

00:45:29.499 --> 00:45:32.499
who is unchaste or chaste, you can not.

00:45:32.499 --> 00:45:35.583
Everybody just the same, “Very good, very good,

00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:37.458
very nice person, very nice person”.

00:45:40.541 --> 00:45:46.041
I mean real possessed people are certified as very good people,

00:45:46.458 --> 00:45:50.583
in Sahaja Yoga also sometimes and I start wondering,

00:45:50.583 --> 00:45:55.541
“What’s happening, what is it? How is it these people

00:45:55.583 --> 00:46:02.666
are certified as that? Can’t they feel it?” There’s no light.

00:46:04.041 --> 00:46:06.041
Even if you get your Realization,

00:46:06.458 --> 00:46:12.958
even if your Spirit is working out your collective consciousness,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.916
even if you are giving Self Realization to others,

00:46:15.958 --> 00:46:19.833
you are nowhere if you have no chastity.

00:46:24.958 --> 00:46:28.791
That’s like a broken glass which is trying to reflect something;

00:46:28.833 --> 00:46:31.000
it can never give the right picture.

00:46:32.749 --> 00:46:37.458
It’s so important. And I have to tell you this now.

00:46:37.499 --> 00:46:41.958
The time has come for Me to tell you – this is the snag in our life.

00:46:44.875 --> 00:46:48.958
First thing people will ask, “Whom I’m going to marry?”

00:46:48.958 --> 00:46:55.833
What is such a hurry? Of course, marriage I call it

00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:58.541
an auspicious thing, marriage should be there,

00:46:58.541 --> 00:47:01.499
there should be a collective sanction, everything, but for what?

00:47:02.875 --> 00:47:07.833
To adore the chastity within us. Then they are married,

00:47:07.875 --> 00:47:10.541
then they have children. Then they want to have a house,

00:47:10.583 --> 00:47:12.041
then they want to have this.

00:47:12.458 --> 00:47:16.749
There’s whole such an insular business goes on, and on, and on,

00:47:16.749 --> 00:47:20.583
and the light of your life doesn’t spread.

00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:28.749
But I’ve known people who were just in the hell

00:47:28.791 --> 00:47:31.458
and have come out and have spread light,

00:47:31.499 --> 00:47:39.499
beautiful meteoric heights they have achieved.

00:47:39.499 --> 00:47:41.041
I’ve seen people like that.

00:47:45.458 --> 00:47:49.458
So today you have come to worship Shri Ganesha - within yourself.

00:47:49.458 --> 00:47:52.958
What is Me to worship as Ganesha I don’t understand.

00:47:56.791 --> 00:48:02.708
Because I’m That. When you are worshiping Me

00:48:02.749 --> 00:48:05.833
you want to have that Shri Ganesh within you awakened.

00:48:09.583 --> 00:48:12.000
Let that be awakened within you.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.458
Let what I say becomes the mantra to awaken that within you,

00:48:17.499 --> 00:48:24.458
so that as My children you enjoy the bliss of chastity

00:48:24.499 --> 00:48:29.583
as I have enjoyed all My human life and all My Divine lives.

00:48:31.708 --> 00:48:34.958
You enjoy the same quantity, that’s what I want.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.791
At least you should have the taste of it.

00:48:42.875 --> 00:48:44.791
I’m telling you about something

00:48:44.791 --> 00:48:46.791
which you may not have heard before.

00:48:46.791 --> 00:48:49.541
But you never heard about Kundalini also.

00:48:49.583 --> 00:48:53.624
You had never heard about Self Realization like this.

00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:59.958
But today I think by chance, absolutely in a Sahaja way,

00:48:59.958 --> 00:49:04.958
this Puja was arranged. I was to have this Puja in Bombay.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.916
It was all organized; people were all willing to come there

00:49:09.916 --> 00:49:15.916
to do this puja. I mean, a Ganesha Puja in England

00:49:15.916 --> 00:49:21.458
or in the West is so important that I thought better have it one,

00:49:21.499 --> 00:49:26.624
without the right time in Rome,

00:49:26.666 --> 00:49:31.875
which is one of the basic things

00:49:31.875 --> 00:49:34.708
which has ruined the chastity of human beings.

00:49:38.458 --> 00:49:42.458
Romans started it and others carried on.

00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:56.499
But it was to be here in Brighton at the Lotus Feet of Sadashiva.

00:49:56.541 --> 00:49:59.916
But the English must know

00:50:01.458 --> 00:50:06.583
that they have got such a golden land

00:50:06.624 --> 00:50:13.000
and they don’t deserve it. They have to deserve it.

00:50:14.916 --> 00:50:19.875
Imagine, you are living in the land of Sadashiva

00:50:22.041 --> 00:50:26.666
where even water beads also the snow –

00:50:26.708 --> 00:50:29.875
means like distilled water, clean, clear, white.

00:50:32.833 --> 00:50:35.583
Where Shri Ganesha is the One

00:50:37.041 --> 00:50:40.499
Who washes the feet of His Father.

00:50:42.958 --> 00:50:48.458
Where the chastity itself resides as your Mother.

00:50:50.833 --> 00:50:56.041
And you have to deserve that coveted position.

00:50:58.833 --> 00:51:01.916
English Sahaja Yogis have to come up very much.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.458
Just the opposite English were.

00:51:09.708 --> 00:51:14.833
Coming from Sadashiva’s land just the opposite.

00:51:14.833 --> 00:51:25.666
Tremendous arrogance, arrogance so horrible,

00:51:25.708 --> 00:51:28.916
which one can not think in Shiva’s place.

00:51:35.833 --> 00:51:39.708
All unchaste people are arrogant.

00:51:40.791 --> 00:51:43.749
Otherwise, how can they forgive themselves?

00:51:46.583 --> 00:51:49.875
You talk to any prostitute, in two minutes you’ll find out

00:51:49.875 --> 00:51:52.041
she’s a prostitute because she’s extremely arrogant,

00:51:52.041 --> 00:51:55.624
“What’s wrong? I’m a prostitute, so what?”

00:52:05.916 --> 00:52:10.916
Arrogance is a sign of unchaste personality.

00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:16.541
And such a person also becomes insular

00:52:16.583 --> 00:52:22.458
because he’s ashamed, ashamed to face others.

00:52:26.916 --> 00:52:29.791
But a chaste personality is open,

00:52:29.833 --> 00:52:32.541
why should he be afraid of anyone?

00:52:34.833 --> 00:52:37.583
Talks to everyone nicely,

00:52:37.583 --> 00:52:42.583
kind to everyone in all innocence and simplicity

00:52:42.624 --> 00:52:45.916
without falling in love in every third person you come across.

00:52:57.458 --> 00:53:05.041
And that, one has to realize that this country is given to you

00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:10.749
with a purpose and if you do not come up to that level,

00:53:10.749 --> 00:53:12.833
you’ll be thrown away.

00:53:21.791 --> 00:53:28.458
So respecting your chastity is real respecting Me,

00:53:28.499 --> 00:53:32.666
because I reside within you as chastity.

00:53:36.499 --> 00:53:40.041
If Shri Ganesha is the auspiciousness,

00:53:40.041 --> 00:53:43.749
I reside within you as chastity.

00:53:47.916 --> 00:53:50.000
Chastity is never aggressive,

00:53:50.041 --> 00:53:55.499
is never harsh, because there’s no need, you know.

00:53:58.624 --> 00:54:01.958
No need, you are so powerful, you are so powerful,

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.666
that there is no need to aggress anyone.

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.958
Why should you aggress, you are not frightened of anyone.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.875
It’s so generous, it’s so kind, it’s so beautiful,

00:54:16.458 --> 00:54:23.791
always fresh and young, yet so sublime and so dignified.

00:54:28.875 --> 00:54:31.749
Now twelve years have passed since I’ve been here.

00:54:31.749 --> 00:54:36.916
Two more years, very intense work is needed,

00:54:36.958 --> 00:54:42.458
within and without. Within we have to work very hard

00:54:42.458 --> 00:54:44.708
for these two years, very hard,

00:54:44.708 --> 00:54:47.708
real tapasya we have to go into,

00:54:50.958 --> 00:54:55.583
all of us, whether men or women.

00:55:01.041 --> 00:55:04.000
And then we’ll see.

00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:13.791
I can say that, we have done good job,

00:55:15.499 --> 00:55:22.624
with little jump, courage and faith we can achieve a lot.

00:55:23.458 --> 00:55:25.541
Have faith in yourself.

00:55:28.749 --> 00:55:37.458
Not mental faith but actual chastity is faith.

00:55:41.458 --> 00:55:45.041
Chastity is the consolidation of your faith.

00:55:49.749 --> 00:55:52.791
When you have faith in God, you are chaste.

00:55:52.833 --> 00:55:55.916
When you have faith in yourself you are chaste.

00:55:55.916 --> 00:55:58.708
You have faith in your wife, you are chaste.

00:55:58.708 --> 00:56:00.499
Why should you have faith in your wife?

00:56:00.499 --> 00:56:04.583
Because you are a chaste person, how can she be unchaste?

00:56:04.624 --> 00:56:09.916
Your faith in your child - is chastity, because you are chaste,

00:56:09.958 --> 00:56:12.875
how can your child be anything else?

00:56:17.458 --> 00:56:21.541
Crystalline form of faith is chastity.

00:56:22.791 --> 00:56:27.916
And that you can have even before Realization. Many have.

00:56:28.875 --> 00:56:35.958
Actually like the camphor, which, you see,

00:56:37.499 --> 00:56:41.458
is volatile and evaporates into the fragrance,

00:56:41.499 --> 00:56:48.749
in the same way we can say chastity acts into faith.

00:56:49.458 --> 00:56:51.916
If you don’t have chastity you cannot have faith,

00:56:51.958 --> 00:56:54.499
in anything.

00:56:55.791 --> 00:56:58.875
Because either you are dealing with your emotions

00:56:58.916 --> 00:57:00.833
that you are emotionally attached to Me

00:57:00.833 --> 00:57:03.041
or maybe you are mentally attached to Me.

00:57:03.708 --> 00:57:08.833
But if you have sense of chastity faith will be apparent.

00:57:08.875 --> 00:57:11.791
Within yourself you don’t have to have faith,

00:57:11.833 --> 00:57:15.499
“Now Mother I will have faith within myself.” You cannot.

00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:23.958
Faith is something, which is volatile

00:57:26.833 --> 00:57:32.666
and the volatile fragrance comes from chastity.

00:57:35.541 --> 00:57:40.458
So from today we are not going to look at the stars or the moon,

00:57:40.458 --> 00:57:43.041
but you are going to look at the Mother Earth.

00:57:45.708 --> 00:57:51.875
In the Universe She represents the Kundalini,

00:57:51.875 --> 00:58:00.666
is nothing but chastity. She’s just chastity.

00:58:01.458 --> 00:58:08.624
Can you believe it? What a power.

00:58:14.583 --> 00:58:19.624
Motherhood, everything is chastity.

00:58:22.624 --> 00:58:26.583
Fatherhood, any relationship is chastity.

00:58:30.458 --> 00:58:34.624
Purity is again the fragrance of chastity.

00:58:35.749 --> 00:58:40.458
Goodness, compassion, everything comes from chastity,

00:58:40.458 --> 00:58:43.000
a sense of chastity, which is not mental.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.624
If you are mentally chaste, you can be horrid.

00:58:46.833 --> 00:58:50.666
Like some of the nuns are or some of those people

00:58:50.708 --> 00:58:52.583
who are austere, not that.

00:58:52.624 --> 00:58:58.624
Chastity is an innate built-in Kundalini within you,

00:59:01.958 --> 00:59:09.666
which acts because it understands Me.

00:59:09.666 --> 00:59:12.458
She understands Me. She knows Me,

00:59:12.499 --> 00:59:14.958
She’s part and parcel of Me, It’s My reflection.

00:59:17.541 --> 00:59:21.583
So make your Kundalini strong by being chaste.

00:59:23.833 --> 00:59:27.875
People try to do things to look very attractive and this and that.

00:59:27.875 --> 00:59:30.458
Don’t waste your energy like this;

00:59:30.499 --> 00:59:32.583
you are saints, live like saints.

00:59:36.749 --> 00:59:42.708
Traditionally as we live, we have to live that way

00:59:42.708 --> 00:59:46.833
and evolve out of the tradition; don’t do something new,

00:59:46.875 --> 00:59:50.041
something absurd, nonsensical.

00:59:50.916 --> 00:59:52.958
We don’t have to attract anyone.

00:59:52.958 --> 00:59:57.666
Chastity is the fragrance in the flower,

00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:01.708
which attracts the bees,

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:05.916
is the honey of the flower,

01:00:05.958 --> 01:00:09.666
is the essence of our existence.

01:00:19.708 --> 01:00:23.791
So this time you are all coming to India,

01:00:24.791 --> 01:00:31.708
I have to request you to respect Me by not misbehaving.

01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:38.000
Not childishly behaving in the manner you see in the pictures

01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:40.041
and the films and all that nonsense.

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:42.499
You are above all that.

01:00:47.916 --> 01:00:58.916
Attention, achievements are to be seen

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:05.541
from the seat of your chastity.

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:09.749
We can’t leave our seats,

01:01:10.499 --> 01:01:13.583
whether we are acclaimed or not makes no difference.

01:01:13.624 --> 01:01:14.875
We can’t leave our seat.

01:01:14.916 --> 01:01:18.833
Like all these avadhootas they’ll say,

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.916
takiya sodaa sana - means we’ll not leave our seats.

01:01:21.958 --> 01:01:32.541
We are in our seats. This is our seat, in the lotus.

01:01:34.583 --> 01:01:42.041
We can’t leave the lotus. We are sitting in the lotus.

01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:49.000
That’s our seat. Then all these nonsensical things

01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:51.499
that you have acquired will drop out.

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.041
You’ll see you’ll become beautiful being.

01:01:57.708 --> 01:02:01.875
All bhoots will run away, all catches will run away.

01:02:05.833 --> 01:02:09.708
But is not austerity, again and again I’m telling you.

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:19.000
It is respect of your Being. As you respect Me outside,

01:02:19.041 --> 01:02:26.833
you respect Me within. As simple as that.

01:02:26.875 --> 01:02:34.041
Today is a great day for us to be worshipping Shri Ganesh.

01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:40.041
He is the first and the foremost to be worshipped.

01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:50.458
And when you worship Him, you must realize

01:02:51.541 --> 01:02:54.499
that you are worshipping His manifestation as well,

01:02:54.541 --> 01:02:59.458
that is of Christ. Anybody who talks cheaply about Christ,

01:03:00.499 --> 01:03:02.624
you should abhor such a person.

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:07.708
You cannot intellectualize Christ. Anybody who does it,

01:03:07.749 --> 01:03:09.875
just have nothing to do with that person.

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:20.541
Christ is innocence.

01:03:23.624 --> 01:03:26.708
If you don’t have the depth of your chastity

01:03:26.749 --> 01:03:30.749
you can’t understand Him. You cannot worship Him.

01:03:37.624 --> 01:03:40.916
That’s the best they could do, is to finish your chastity

01:03:40.916 --> 01:03:43.000
so that you never recognize Him.

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:56.833
All that comes to you through your meditative efforts.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:04:01.833
Now the effort is to be just that you have to be meditative.

01:04:01.875 --> 01:04:07.000
That’s all. Keep your meditation on.

01:04:07.041 --> 01:04:09.541
Try to be meditative. See things.

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:12.749
What is witness state is nothing but that you are meditative.

01:04:16.749 --> 01:04:24.833
So I have decided also that I’ll meet the Brighton people

01:04:24.833 --> 01:04:32.958
here tomorrow morning and I will meet all the English people

01:04:32.958 --> 01:04:36.749
if possible day after tomorrow evening

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:45.916
to tell them how important it is for them to achieve

01:04:47.499 --> 01:05:00.624
that state of purity. I think it’s working out.

01:05:00.624 --> 01:05:02.916
I really work very hard,

01:05:02.958 --> 01:05:05.791
you have no idea how much I work hard.

01:05:05.833 --> 01:05:10.666
But this is also they said that, is an idea that people think

01:05:10.666 --> 01:05:13.000
that others should do all their work.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.541
This is like pound saving, this saving, that saving

01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:22.916
and also labour saving. Let Mother do all the job for us.

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:25.875
Mother is looking after us. She should get up in the morning.

01:05:25.916 --> 01:05:27.666
She should do meditation.

01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:35.916
There is no saving.

01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:41.791
You can save everything else if you just know

01:05:41.833 --> 01:05:48.541
how to save your Spirit. Only your ascent is important.

01:05:48.541 --> 01:05:51.624
Once you ascend, everything is saved.

01:05:52.833 --> 01:05:54.958
But first save yourself.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.624
For that you have to put in effort. You have to work hard.

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:07.000
You have to go deep into you, evolve yourself.

01:06:07.041 --> 01:06:12.875
You are quite capable of it. Do not blame anyone;

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:16.583
do not blame your wife, mother, father, country anything.

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:19.000
Everyone can work it out.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.458
Don’t see other people, see yourself,

01:06:22.458 --> 01:06:25.000
“How far I have gone? What have I contributed?

01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:29.833
Let me go ahead with it.” Every one of you.

01:06:32.541 --> 01:06:34.624
I am thankful that all the people

01:06:34.666 --> 01:06:37.708
have come from all over England.

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:40.916
It was right thing to do it in a way,

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:47.041
but this country must be created of that level

01:06:47.833 --> 01:06:51.583
that it becomes pilgrimage for everybody to come here.

01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:57.499
On the contrary it should not happen

01:06:57.541 --> 01:06:58.875
that once they come to England,

01:06:58.916 --> 01:07:00.875
after that they never come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:01.791 --> 01:07:10.000
Could happen, could happen with the arrogance

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.791
that people have may be that it might become like that,

01:07:14.041 --> 01:07:16.000
that once they come here they’ll say,

01:07:16.041 --> 01:07:18.583
“No more Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it.”

01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:24.958
The other way round in India, once they go to India they stick on it.

01:07:26.541 --> 01:07:30.000
I have known some people that they came to England

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.916
and the way they, some of the Sahaja Yogis behaved

01:07:32.958 --> 01:07:36.749
and some of the ashrams run, they just ran away.

01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:37.875
“Mother nothing doing,

01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:40.583
we are not going to be in Sahaja Yoga anymore

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:44.499
after seeing your developed Sahaja Yogis in England

01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:46.583
where you have worked for twelve years.”

01:07:49.791 --> 01:07:57.541
So today we are sitting on this beautiful land of England

01:07:58.833 --> 01:08:03.875
and we have certain debts to be paid,

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.916
to be born in this country,

01:08:09.541 --> 01:08:14.916
and the debt is that we have to be great Sahaja Yogis.

01:08:17.958 --> 01:08:21.833
You can make out, very easily, who is a great Sahaja Yogi.

01:08:21.833 --> 01:08:26.624
When you say that, “shut that window,”

01:08:27.541 --> 01:08:30.624
you’ll find most of them will be sitting looking at others.

01:08:30.666 --> 01:08:34.041
I don’t say they are all English but could be.

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:44.916
Make others work is not the way.

01:08:44.916 --> 01:08:47.749
You have to be really very dedicated.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:51.541
You are not of that level, believe Me you are not of that level.

01:08:51.541 --> 01:08:54.749
Don’t look at other people who are here.

01:08:54.749 --> 01:08:57.624
You are very different type of people. You are special people.

01:09:00.458 --> 01:09:08.000
Try to be alert, respect yourself because you are English

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.624
and that you have a special responsibility.

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:18.958
So may God bless you.

01:10:08.958 --> 01:10:13.666
All the way he has brought the water of River Godhavari

01:10:13.666 --> 01:10:19.499
which flows in the Nasik, in the river, Nasik.

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:23.958
You see you know that where Shri Rama and Shri Sita

01:10:23.958 --> 01:10:26.708
and Lakshmana all lived there in Nasik.

01:10:28.541 --> 01:10:33.083
And this river is called as the Ganges of the south. Godhavari.

01:10:35.875 --> 01:10:42.458
He got the water from Godhavari. See the vibrations flowing.

01:10:44.499 --> 01:10:47.833
In the country where the rivers even are mantras,

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:54.000
their names are mantras - the whole credit goes to the Saints,

01:10:56.958 --> 01:11:06.916
to the people who lived so religiously and so much full of purity

01:11:06.916 --> 01:11:10.666
that the rivers, even if you take their names the vibration comes.

01:11:15.916 --> 01:11:21.833
See? Why not one day Thames becomes like that?

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:29.708
Through your punyas it should be.

01:11:30.624 --> 01:11:45.958
Every particle of this earth should become vibrated

01:11:47.624 --> 01:11:49.916
through your punyas only.

01:11:57.749 --> 01:12:04.541
Now we have to see that Shri Ganesha state.

01:12:05.624 --> 01:12:09.708
The people who have to worship, we have to see

01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:12.499
who are the people who have to worship.

01:12:15.666 --> 01:12:17.708
Very difficult situation.

01:12:52.791 --> 01:12:56.833
Get the small children, that’s the best.

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:00.666
Come along. Nira. Come along.

01:13:04.875 --> 01:13:10.583
Yes, yes you both come along.

01:13:12.458 --> 01:13:21.916
Very good. Great. Below ten years. All right. Sit down.

01:13:41.666 --> 01:13:44.749
All of them should be below ten years.

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.749
Not below two but below ten.

01:14:00.749 --> 01:14:03.749
All right. Come, come, come, all of you.

01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:28.624
Very good children, must say.

01:14:28.624 --> 01:14:30.708
Tremendous they are. Aren’t they?

01:14:30.708 --> 01:14:37.541
What we are going to do is to wash Mataji´s Feet.

01:14:37.541 --> 01:14:40.708
Alright? How do we wash, she is putting water on my Feet

01:14:40.708 --> 01:14:42.958
and you just have to rub. Alright.

01:14:42.958 --> 01:14:45.541
Come along, four at the time.

01:14:45.541 --> 01:14:46.916
Now who are the four?

01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:50.624
She will put the water,

01:14:50.624 --> 01:14:53.749
