AI GENERATED. But I wanted to I think some of it.

1
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.549
This is the

2
00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:20.389
the

3
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270
the.

4
00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:25.239
It

5
00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:26.799
You know as soon as the

6
00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.520
there were two persons standing and one of them was the pastor who was sing,

7
00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.740
was it there was somebody standing in.

8
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.220
She was wearing a blue suit and the car,

9
00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:51.790
but she was smelling me some uncles.

10
00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:53.740
You've been drinking

11
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.880
No I

12
00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.209
I

13
00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.040
I.

14
00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:06.399
The country.

15
00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:11.110
Can you remember we had a problem.

16
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.730
But I told you that

17
00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:17.769
You you just to come back.

18
00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:20.580
It took place in.

19
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.239
For the first time.

20
00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:30.250
talking to them you know.

21
00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.269
Well,

22
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.199
at the end of it,

23
00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.599
as if she quarrelled with her or something and

24
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.959
we wanted to go.

25
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.839
What was the quarrel between her and them and then she came,

26
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.180
but I say that are we realised or not and my head.

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.860
But I must say one what we do,

28
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but Italians have said.

29
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.610
What it really is so.

30
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.989
There's a kind of a

31
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.239
thing,

32
00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:59.169
it's very appealing their stuff.

33
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.229
they are not so dried out.

34
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.899
Right.

35
00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.320
No,

36
00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.229
they don't think that everything has come to conclusion now sort of

37
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.639
you know we are the top of the world.

38
00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:27.520
We are sorted out.

39
00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:29.330
They don't think that they think there are

40
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.050
so many things which cannot be explained and

41
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.789
they're not so absolutely sure of that.

42
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.910
I'm.

43
00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:38.779
So

44
00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:07.080
I told a few people to come tomorrow with lemons that will avoid them.

45
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.369
We have to get some lemons.

46
00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.470
We have to take some lemon and

47
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.419
and lady was depressed and all that and then we had to give photographs of.

48
00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.770
So

49
00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:32.500
you just do nothing and we are being.

50
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.850
It's fact that now they're coming under the legal.

51
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.289
An understanding of this type of food now.

52
00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.440
OK,

53
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.589
like what is that called?

54
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.869
Don't think

55
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.160
legally comes from them because

56
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.279
they must be they must be doing all these illegal things because that's good.

57
00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.100
start coming in

58
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.929
everybody started uh and.

59
00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:31.480
The

60
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.410
I don't think

61
00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:46.059
you know that now the whole authority of challenge.

62
00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:49.070
Because there are so many things,

63
00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:51.429
the frost,

64
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.459
this can,

65
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.489
this can.

66
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.869
the beauty of all is that it's expose.

67
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480
To.

68
00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:10.959
The la.

69
00:05:27.549 --> 00:05:30.980
So there is not at all for us to be worried about.

70
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.859
They just get exposed.

71
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.220
Another thing is all false would quarrel among them.

72
00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:38.079
Well,

73
00:05:38.239 --> 00:05:38.589
I first.

74
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.769
It

75
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.390
Well it was a good rule.

76
00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:45.640
Uh,

77
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.359

78
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.649
so.

79
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.179
You know,

80
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.269
of course I lagenically felt,

81
00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.290
uh,

82
00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.540

83
00:05:58.549 --> 00:05:58.559

89
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.500
What

90
00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:08.220

91
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:12.390
And I got 2 days.

92
00:06:15.019 --> 00:06:15.779
But what I said.

93
00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:20.369
yeah.

94
00:06:31.299 --> 00:06:31.309

There are also some people from the programme here.

97
00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:35.980
Yes that was already there.

98
00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.519
Yeah.

99
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:43.250
So

100
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890
I.

101
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.570
and more people come tonight.

102
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.179
And.

103
00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:20.790
Yeah,

104
00:07:25.579 --> 00:07:25.630
but you wrote your organisation.

105
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.149
What.

106
00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:32.459
What are the names.

107
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.579
The first name Lucien is in your family you know.

108
00:07:46.489 --> 00:07:46.859
Uh,

109
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:47.089
Elga.

110
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:54.480
So

111
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.959
Uh,

112
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:57.489
I

113
00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:59.750
think you have it takes up so fast.

114
00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:01.540
You don't have to.

115
00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.989
Because people are thinking about it.

116
00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:08.359
That's.

117
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.209
The

118
00:08:12.549 --> 00:08:12.600
uh.

119
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:23.859
Uh.

120
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.090
So.

121
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:33.929
See,

122
00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.039
the more opposition we have,

123
00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:38.890
that's a sure sign that they have threatened you,

124
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.808
so we shouldn't be upset with that.

125
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:41.650
But I didn't affected.

126
00:09:01.609 --> 00:09:02.349
And that is the.

127
00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:06.099
I'm something you off and I know that.

128
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.640
And to those people

129
00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:13.080
who have gone through this panic ideology.

130
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.739
are better to judge

131
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.369
and these young people are just entering into a new venture

132
00:09:21.969 --> 00:09:22.869
like this you must have seen all this.

133
00:09:23.849 --> 00:09:24.820
So for her

134
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.570
she must be understanding that this is not the end.

135
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:28.559
We have to find her and then you need to be.

136
00:09:55.909 --> 00:09:56.010
uh.

137
00:10:01.859 --> 00:10:01.960
I have.

138
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.380
You see like uh people can understand to experience this,

139
00:10:10.789 --> 00:10:14.150
but you see we have had all this kind of thing in every country.

140
00:10:14.979 --> 00:10:17.940
Every religion they have had all these kind of things,

141
00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:19.580
preaching things that.

142
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:21.530
Where have we been?

143
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.890
You see,

144
00:10:22.169 --> 00:10:22.890
everybody starts seeing.

145
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:23.070
Where are we?

146
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:23.380
Where are we.

147
00:11:18.349 --> 00:11:18.729
And in the.

148
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:34.960
And I'm so careful that

149
00:11:36.039 --> 00:11:37.190
this should not be provoked.

150
00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:39.640
Be careful with that.

151
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.020
And as you know that how gradually.

152
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:53.969
fully talk of how people when they achieve certain level of understanding.

153
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.080
You don't want the truth on their heads just like that.

154
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:07.979
Oh.

155
00:12:18.179 --> 00:12:18.400
that she wants.

156
00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:30.190
Latina.

157
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.580
But despite all that,

158
00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.919
That things can happen.

159
00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:40.679
So once you talk on this the,

160
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.520
this is nothing.

161
00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.320
I tell you that this is nothing.

162
00:12:44.729 --> 00:12:46.210
Compared to what one can.

163
00:12:47.739 --> 00:12:48.510
This is nothing.

164
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.450
Just take it.

165
00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:52.559
It's nothing to what or nothing to what will come.

166
00:12:56.729 --> 00:12:56.809
that

167
00:12:58.630 --> 00:12:58.710
I will warn you beforehand.

168
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.289
I told you

169
00:13:07.489 --> 00:13:07.700
that

170
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:11.830
The is up.

171
00:13:14.719 --> 00:13:16.070
Of the intellectuals.

172
00:13:16.789 --> 00:13:16.880
It's extremely you talk about this

173
00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:21.650
this afternoon or this morning this morning or morning.

174
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760
Also,

175
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.900
the Protestants of Protestants,

176
00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:51.520
you see,

177
00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:51.929
see,

178
00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:52.960
now I'll tell you what.

179
00:13:53.719 --> 00:13:57.880
See how Protestantism has come for the Catholics.

180
00:13:58.969 --> 00:13:59.890
They started

181
00:14:00.849 --> 00:14:02.289
What uh what you call a

182
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.460
method by which

183
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.369
the characters was absolutely gripping.

184
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.510
So Martin Luther could see so obvious it was

185
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.989
that the Pope was selling fast to the heaven.

186
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:36.429
This is what happens.

187
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:36.539
It comes out in such a funny shape that everybody.

188
00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:09.229
So actually Catholicism

189
00:15:19.049 --> 00:15:19.229
was a blow to the Jew Catholicism but the uh by

190
00:15:19.229 --> 00:15:20.659
Chris was a blow to the so he tried to deviate.

191
00:15:21.479 --> 00:15:24.679
From that and give them the right thing because he wanted to

192
00:15:24.679 --> 00:15:28.390
talk about the spiritual life and eternal life and all that.

193
00:15:43.669 --> 00:15:44.419
But so many Jews.

194
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:50.669
Now when Christ came in,

195
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.909
what he preached that also became another Bible.

196
00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:02.669
Now the only intelligent can read and split the hair out of it,

197
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.609
intelligence.

198
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.450
And then they studied it to see they twisted it to them.

199
00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:14.919
No,

200
00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.700
that they believe in it because this is what they have got the book in their hand.

201
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.739
They are now studying now.

202
00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:21.059
They are not.

203
00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:23.260
and that's how they used uh

204
00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:29.239
now uh

205
00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:31.159
uh

206
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.960
I mean actually the Catholics use the same Bible for your information.

207
00:16:36.989 --> 00:16:37.510
Of the Catholics so that more.

208
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.260
And the Muslims use the same Torah.

209
00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:43.929
The all that was.

210
00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:46.369
Jews.

211
00:16:57.169 --> 00:16:57.650
So

212
00:16:58.369 --> 00:16:59.080
then Mohammad came,

213
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.270
they denied him on those 5 books.

214
00:17:05.598 --> 00:17:08.630
Every time they did like this using a book.

215
00:17:13.409 --> 00:17:15.198
Then Martin came in.

216
00:17:15.489 --> 00:17:17.269
He revised the whole thing.

217
00:17:17.288 --> 00:17:18.948
He wanted to revise it and do it.

218
00:17:19.167 --> 00:17:19.808
He said this is.

219
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:21.650
That

220
00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.229
you should not have these uh none of these and all that

221
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.150
and it's just spontaneously.

222
00:17:27.959 --> 00:17:28.010
Protestants

223
00:17:43.069 --> 00:17:47.650
Once a priest from Protestant church went to Mahatma Gandhi and asked him what,

224
00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:49.369
why don't you become a Christian.

225
00:17:56.569 --> 00:17:57.349
So I'll be very happy,

226
00:17:57.439 --> 00:17:58.989
but which should I join.

227
00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:07.199
And which I can be.

228
00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.530
Then the fellow didn't know what to say.

229
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:15.270
OK.

230
00:18:17.229 --> 00:18:17.949
So you

231
00:18:18.829 --> 00:18:20.750
Your Bible interpretation.

232
00:18:21.689 --> 00:18:22.760
It's a last word,

233
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.469
then it should be the only one.

234
00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.880
How can there be 1,0001 interpretation?

235
00:18:27.729 --> 00:18:28.430
He la.

236
00:18:30.449 --> 00:18:30.569
Now there are so many interpretations and actually

237
00:18:30.569 --> 00:18:30.680
people are at daggers and with each other

238
00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:46.589
like in uh in the say in Ireland now.

239
00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:52.189
Think of Ireland where the all the people following Christ

240
00:18:52.189 --> 00:18:54.500
very ardently are fighting each other uh what is uh.

241
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:04.319
So decrease

242
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:07.109
decrease

243
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.760
so whatever medium they have used,

244
00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.310
whatever interpretation they have used.

245
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.420
If not,

246
00:19:20.219 --> 00:19:20.229
OK.

247
00:19:24.579 --> 00:19:24.589
It.

248
00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:27.209
Because they use their brains

249
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.599
according to their understanding,

250
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.430
there are so many Bibles and so many churches and so many problems.

251
00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.310
Now what I'm saying is that to read the Bible you must use your spirit

252
00:19:52.579 --> 00:19:52.630
is it is it sorry.

253
00:19:55.219 --> 00:19:55.290
I was

254
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.130
You can only achieve it by reality.

255
00:20:00.119 --> 00:20:00.359
It was that could be.

256
00:20:04.829 --> 00:20:05.910
But people don't want to.

257
00:20:15.469 --> 00:20:18.300
Unless they get the realisation they won't understand

258
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.020
Bible in its right.

259
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.040
One sentence of Bible that I will appear before you.

260
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:30.910
Uh,

261
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.780
the flames them.

262
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.770
They fun

263
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:46.180
fun.

264
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.489
And everybody will say something else,

265
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.650
but inside of even a person who has children.

266
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.910
who are not

267
00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:01.859
educated,

268
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.160
who can't read the Bible.

269
00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:03.920
The

270
00:21:14.079 --> 00:21:16.239
When Christ said you have to be like children,

271
00:21:16.319 --> 00:21:18.829
you meant you forget all your educational Bible.

272
00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:26.239
I did.

273
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:26.640
I love to be able to work.

274
00:21:29.209 --> 00:21:30.640
They are all complicated people

275
00:21:33.609 --> 00:21:35.150
and they have conferences and arguments and fights.

276
00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.770
And what are they getting?

277
00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.359
That donkeys hitting each other.

278
00:21:45.479 --> 00:21:47.040
That's all I feel about that.

279
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:49.079
Because this pass.

280
00:21:51.219 --> 00:21:51.270
If it is the truth,

281
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:51.339
if it is the reality,

282
00:21:51.349 --> 00:21:51.420
what is there to fight for it.

283
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.510
It should be it should be exposed to you.

284
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.459
It should be that.

285
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.750
You don't fight for your nose,

286
00:22:17.459 --> 00:22:17.500
it is your own.

287
00:22:20.069 --> 00:22:22.079
But if you want to learn it from others.

288
00:22:22.959 --> 00:22:23.020
Then

289
00:22:30.219 --> 00:22:32.800
When you are human being watch it you can brainwash them.

290
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:35.010
You can make them feel there is no God.

291
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.290
You can make anything out of them.

292
00:22:44.439 --> 00:22:45.069
They are so vulnerable

293
00:22:54.969 --> 00:22:55.099
because they live in the world.

294
00:22:55.109 --> 00:22:55.930
They have to come to that point.

295
00:22:59.119 --> 00:23:01.650
But they understand why am I doing it after all,

296
00:23:01.729 --> 00:23:02.510
what am I to gain

297
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.239
I'm not a pastor who paid for I don't take any money by God's grace,

298
00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:22.780
I have a very comfortable house of my own and I live very comfortably with my.

299
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:29.329
Ico,

300
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:30.140
nothing out of.

301
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.630
Then why am I wanting to be.

302
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:37.839
in the other room.

303
00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:37.890
So this is what,

304
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:46.300
but they don't want to think because you see anybody can brainwash

305
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:47.380
human beings.

306
00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:49.569
I see.

307
00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:50.939
I don't

308
00:23:53.959 --> 00:23:55.750
Like I went to China first

309
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:16.579
and then all talking of Mao and if Mao was born.

310
00:24:16.589 --> 00:24:16.729
Nobody would talk a sentence without Mao so the first

311
00:24:16.729 --> 00:24:16.839
person who this experience of the Bible was Mao.

312
00:24:17.699 --> 00:24:18.089
Now,

313
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:20.640
Once he died,

314
00:24:20.969 --> 00:24:22.260
then there was an earthquake,

315
00:24:22.489 --> 00:24:24.369
so now they they have forgotten about him.

316
00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:25.010
They think he was wrong.

317
00:24:36.599 --> 00:24:36.660
Some believe that he was wrong.

318
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.670
Hitler came in all the Germans believed

319
00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.050
that Hitler was absolutely correct.

320
00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.329
We are all chosen people.

321
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:44.650
We are.

322
00:24:51.709 --> 00:24:53.119
What a stupid thing to believe.

323
00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:53.410
I mean,

324
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:53.760
how can such a stupid thing like that

325
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.160
and to believing in such a nonsensical thing,

326
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.079
how much harm they have done.

327
00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:07.890
To human beings

328
00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.819
and to their basic values which are.

329
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.670
So he failed by God.

330
00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:24.219
Now they say it's a political mistake.

331
00:25:25.109 --> 00:25:25.170
He's a very nice.

332
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:39.530
That there has been lots of brainwashing going on

333
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:39.619
of these fans that you think is wrong,

334
00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:39.760
but if you go to and you talk to anybody from that country,

335
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:39.849
you'll be amazed

336
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.469
that even some Indians who are there are believing that is correct.

337
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.459
Can you believe it.

338
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:12.819
You

339
00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:17.479
don't have their own personality.

340
00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:25.790
They talk of individual,

341
00:26:26.579 --> 00:26:27.719
but I think they are

342
00:26:28.109 --> 00:26:28.609
only

343
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.989
blood type of people.

344
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:30.010
uh

345
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:38.770
uh.

346
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.109
Then an individual rises and he fights

347
00:26:43.479 --> 00:26:44.829
this kind of a thing,

348
00:26:45.319 --> 00:26:45.750
then

349
00:26:45.979 --> 00:26:49.130
others join him but they again become another club.

350
00:26:58.729 --> 00:26:58.739
uh.

351
00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.699
But it is not a living clubs.

352
00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:05.930
There is no living oneness.

353
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:06.939
Therefore we need to.

354
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.290
So it will it will be all dead and it is fine and.

355
00:27:21.709 --> 00:27:23.869
But the living thing well it is one.

356
00:27:26.619 --> 00:27:26.660
That it is completely

357
00:27:32.349 --> 00:27:32.959
uh absolutely

358
00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.199
in uh

359
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.770
uh the best of its manifestation.

360
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.709
And that is what people don't understand

361
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:46.849
that clubbing.

362
00:27:48.109 --> 00:27:49.500
As dead people

363
00:27:50.729 --> 00:27:50.750
in the.

364
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:51.770
Uh

365
00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:03.939
uh.

366
00:28:04.979 --> 00:28:06.920
I see you from any organisation?

367
00:28:07.609 --> 00:28:07.750
all go down 252 they lose because they get away

368
00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:19.310
from that.

369
00:28:20.949 --> 00:28:21.300
done

370
00:28:23.979 --> 00:28:23.989
this.

371
00:28:27.949 --> 00:28:32.630
So only the organisation that is living is the eternal organisation.

372
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.109
The you.

373
00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:41.199
But you cannot organise the living organisation

374
00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:46.520
with your mind,

375
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.359
it just is organised like all my five fingers act according to the way I want.

376
00:29:02.369 --> 00:29:08.099
I don't have to think beforehand that when I lift

377
00:29:08.099 --> 00:29:09.630
this finger finger and I don't plan it that way.

378
00:29:09.709 --> 00:29:10.910
It just happens.

379
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:12.459
The whole body reacts

380
00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.099
because it's a living

381
00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.079
in the same way if people get realisation,

382
00:29:32.239 --> 00:29:33.890
many people get realisation,

383
00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:33.920
you form

384
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.439
that great primordial being which is now awakened as the sense of that.

385
00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:43.569
the.

386
00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:00.699
The fighting going on now between Jews andros,

387
00:30:00.709 --> 00:30:04.160
the fighting going on between Khomeini and the Iraqi.

388
00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.020
The fighting going on,

389
00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:07.250
uh,

390
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:07.619
between,

391
00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:08.310
uh,

392
00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:10.020
people in say

393
00:30:10.839 --> 00:30:11.550
Chile and Argentina.

394
00:30:12.219 --> 00:30:14.260
It's all nothing but the fighting

395
00:30:14.489 --> 00:30:15.380
that gathered.

396
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.380
The Russians are fighting that.

397
00:30:28.209 --> 00:30:30.819
The so-called Christian nations like America is

398
00:30:30.819 --> 00:30:32.819
supplying all arms to all the countries.

399
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.180
Imagine that Christian nations supplying arms to all other nations.

400
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.349
are supposed to be.

401
00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:03.819
because of.

402
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:09.369
That was first British did work best,

403
00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:20.589
but then now the Swiss at this stage Swiss because all the parts of India,

404
00:31:20.819 --> 00:31:22.790
all the politicians of India,

405
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.540
all the people who are making money out of the poor people.

406
00:31:25.609 --> 00:31:41.150
Swiss.

407
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:44.770
Now they found find another monetary fund,

408
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.250
you see,

409
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.569
from this side to side,

410
00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:51.219
from that side to have a monetary fund to help the develop it.

411
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.569
I know a very good plan for Marsh always used to come to Switzerland.

412
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.930
And then it was discovered

413
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.849
that he's the one who had taken lots of money from

414
00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:11.969
from Mauritius.

415
00:32:12.989 --> 00:32:13.520
Sukarno,

416
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.189
another fellow,

417
00:32:14.339 --> 00:32:15.790
all his money was in here.

418
00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:17.229
This

419
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:19.180
Uh.

420
00:32:45.459 --> 00:32:47.459
So this is another Christian nation.

421
00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.069
One Christian nation,

422
00:32:51.099 --> 00:32:51.760
America is trying to

423
00:32:55.189 --> 00:32:55.719
send all,

424
00:32:56.089 --> 00:33:00.459
all their weapons and their bad medicines to developing countries.

425
00:33:02.844 --> 00:33:16.704
are the people who dominated all over the world up to China to get out of their place.

426
00:33:17.209 --> 00:33:25.410
They went everywhere in India for 300 years

427
00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:30.550
and now they don't Indians to stay there for 3 months.

428
00:33:48.099 --> 00:33:49.290
Look at the great Christians.

429
00:33:58.959 --> 00:33:59.060
Every lamppost in that country.

430
00:34:26.375 --> 00:34:26.385
they,

431
00:34:26.395 --> 00:34:26.455
they killed so many people.

432
00:34:26.465 --> 00:34:26.665
They were still believing in Christ and God we are killing the Jews

433
00:34:51.504 --> 00:34:53.725
Jews are killing the Arabs because they don't believe in Jews.

434
00:34:59.889 --> 00:34:59.899
I.

435
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.489
I mean,

436
00:35:07.669 --> 00:35:08.620
are supposed to be.

437
00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:14.810
We must and see that

438
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.699
we have to do a lot if we have to really make Christ live.

439
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:28.340
All right,

440
00:35:28.419 --> 00:35:28.979
that's all right.

441
00:35:38.139 --> 00:35:38.229
It was a nice

442
00:35:42.209 --> 00:35:42.679
Otherwise,

443
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:43.800
how would that not all going to do

444
00:35:45.439 --> 00:35:45.689
now what

445
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:52.889
I think you all have something to do but enjoy yourself.

446
00:35:53.949 --> 00:35:54.429
just stop

447
00:35:58.419 --> 00:35:58.429
