Navaratri Puja, Cabella, Italy
September 27, 1998

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:10.749
You can't imagine how a Mother who has so
many beautiful children sees them in such

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.530
joyous mood with their families, their children,
nicely settled down. It's very satisfying

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.520
to see you all so much in joy and complete
oneness with the Divine. One has to realize

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:45.429
only one thing: that though you are many,
still compared to the population of this world,

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:54.449
we are very few who really know the true knowledge,
the real knowledge. You are the people who

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:04.519
are knowledgeable, no doubt, but also knowledge
which is not being adorned with truth or which

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.840
is not the true knowledge has no meaning.
All that vanishes into thin air because it

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.509
is artificial.

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.509
By your kundalini awakening you all have achieved
that state where we can say you know. You

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:35.149
know what is the real knowledge is, but think
of the people who do not know what knowledge

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.780
is. We take, for example we say that our knowledge
is nothing but love, but one should understand

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:55.499
the discrimination. The knowledge that is
love within you is just emitting out from

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:04.039
your being. You don't have to assert, you
don't have to think, you don't have to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:11.039
read some sort of a poetry or go into some
romantic mood; just pure love which emits,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.730
and this is the knowledge also.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.730
How you have to relate it is this way: the
knowledge that you have about yourself is

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.959
evident, is absolutely expressed on your fingertips,
and about others also. You know about others

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.470
and about yourself. This is the greatest subtle
knowledge you have. No one knows like that.

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.209
Apart from you people, no one knows about
themselves or about others. So this knowledge

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.900
that has come to you, which is extremely subtle,
extremely secretive, is absolutely secret.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.700
If you know about somebody, you know. Others
do not know that you know about them, and

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.459
so this knowledge that you have got is nothing
but love. It's very difficult to make knowledge

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:33.079
and love put together, because our idea of
knowledge is very different, what we read

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:41.219
from the books. How can you love from the
books? What love means, our attachments: to

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.739
us, in ignorance we get attached to people,
to children, to family, to things. By getting

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:58.359
attachment it is proved that we do not have
the knowledge.

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:04.680
If you have the knowledge then all attachments
should just drop out and you should become

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.319
a global personality, a drop in the ocean.
For example, we are attached to many things,

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:18.319
like we are attached to our family. Something
happens in the family we get very disturbed,

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.190
we can't bear it. If anything happens to
our children, we feel horrible, it's just

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.970
the whole world is falling on you.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.970
Then from family you move on. You are attached
to your friends, to your neighbors; you are

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.600
also attached to your country. Attachment
to your country is also not knowledge. Once

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.310
you are a realized soul, you just start seeing
your country clearly: what wrong it has got,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:59.190
what ignorance it has got, in what darkness
it exists, and in what way it is quarrelling,

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:08.010
fighting for rights and things. But with the
knowledge that you have within yourself, you

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.640
see it so clearly what is the problem of your
country; then you try to improve that through

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:23.640
your love -- means the power of your knowledge
is love.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.150
If you have all the knowledge within you,
and if you are just sitting at home and meditating,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:37.150
it has no meaning. What you have to go is
to go about, tell people -- you have to meet

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.500
other people, your friends, your family and
other relations -- about your knowledge.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:53.180
If you cannot do that, then your knowledge
is not with love. It's such a connection

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:58.780
between the two. You feel like telling everybody
that you've got your realization. You feel

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:05.030
like telling everyone that you are a realized
soul, but in that you feel that you are expressing

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:12.030
your ego. All right, by some other ways, some
other methods, you can express to them that

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.680
you have the true knowledge. When you have
the false knowledge you can get ego. You can

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.680
think that "I know so much, I know about
this, I know the color of the carpets, all

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:34.580
the shades, everything." Any stupid thing
if you know, you think that you are very great.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:41.580
That's the sign of stupidity in your head
also, that you think this is very great to

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.180
know.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.440
Now we have discovered that through all kinds
of acquiring knowledge in the whole world,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.310
what we have achieved? Nothing. There are
wars going on. There's all kinds of destructions

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:06.310
coming in. I saw on the television this George.
It's a whirlwind which is going round and

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.620
is killing so many people; is destroying so
many people without understanding what he

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.880
is doing, but he's there and he's acting
very well. So is it that he doesn't understand,

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.880
or is it that he understands and that he is
doing something just to correct people? This

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.110
also we should have full idea.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:39.110
Like yesterday when I came here it was raining
heavily, and then I sat down and suddenly

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:46.550
it stopped, stopped till the whole program
was over. Till I spoke it was not working,

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:54.270
but suddenly when you started clapping, also
it started clapping -- that's what it was.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:01.270
So even the nature knows who you are, but
you must know the nature, this is the point.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:10.950
Nature will act according to what your level
of spirituality is.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.040
Surprisingly I always felt that there cannot
be levels of spirituality. I felt that once

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:25.040
you get realization you are there, but later
on discovered I was wrong; it is not so. Even

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:32.130
after getting realization, I found people
had so many obstructions in rising. There

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:40.010
were so many temptations which were keeping
them down. So one had to work out on different

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.730
chakras, different nadis, somehow or other
to make you perfect, because the perfection

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:55.730
within only will give you the authority to
use this knowledge.

00:08:56.579 --> 00:09:03.060
There are as I told you two ways of doing
it. The other day I told you that you should

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:10.060
not react. It's human nature to react. It's
absolutely human, but if you have to become

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:16.930
superhuman, you should not react. By not reacting
you will grow, definitely you'll grow, but

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:23.610
if you react then you cannot grow, because
you are working under the pressure of other

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:30.279
thing that is not yourself. Now supposing
as I said I see these carpets, I know the

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:37.189
color and this and that, and I react to it
-- finished. I will not have any sense of

00:09:37.189 --> 00:09:43.120
judgment if I react to it, but if I don't
react, then I'll know whether these carpets

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:50.120
have got vibrations or not. Are they emitting
vibrations or not? Now what are these vibrations?

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:54.189
That is the love.

00:09:54.189 --> 00:09:59.740
So the communication is like this: if you
have the light you can see things. So when

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:06.060
you see things the light is there, and light
gives you the perception, gives you the vision

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:13.060
to see things. In the same way when you are
enlightened, what happens that these vibrations

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.910
start flowing, just like the light, and in
that light you can see things which are good

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:25.910
and which are bad. But sometimes you put the
same parameters as human beings do. Like you

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:34.939
go to some house, a very nice house, very
good house. All these things make you very

00:10:37.189 --> 00:10:44.189
happy; but actually, what about that house?
Is it having good vibrations or it's having

00:10:48.319 --> 00:10:52.220
bad vibrations? Is it worth living there or
not?

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:58.120
Like the other day they told Me they can get
a very nice place in Milan, little beyond

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.420
Milan, on rent, very cheap. I said, "Why
is it so cheap?" Immediately I felt the

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:09.420
vibrations of the place. I said, "Did you
go and see the vibrations of that place?"

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:16.110
They went and saw -- this was all burning.
Then they found out that there was a Scientology

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:22.029
there for years together. I said, "That's
not the place where you can live. You have

00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:29.029
to have a very pure place. Even hut of a poor
man would be better than this comfortable

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:32.600
so-called place."

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:39.600
So one has to use the vibrations all the time
to understand everything that you are doing.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.310
In that also it can be misleading them. Some
people feel vibrations and they tell Me, "Mother,

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:49.930
I felt the vibrations and I felt I should
marry this man."

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.689
I said, "You did feel the vibrations?"

00:11:52.689 --> 00:11:58.670
"Yes. Yes I did, very much, and I must marry
this man."

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.559
And when I see the man I see the bhoot in
him. I said, "My God, what sort of vibrations

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:07.600
this lady has felt about him?"

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:14.600
So in your judgment what is there: there's
no pure knowledge. So see how, how connected

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:21.730
they are -- vibrations which is love; and
also the other thing which you have to have

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:30.699
is the knowledge, the pure knowledge, the
true knowledge. We can say that pure knowledge

00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:37.699
and true knowledge is like the energy, like
electricity. And the way you feel it, the

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:47.800
way you understand it, it exists -- that
is love. People don't understand also what

00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:57.399
is the love is. They get mad after someone
and say that, "Mother, I say I think that

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:03.079
I am in love with that person." And after
five days they'll come and say, "Mother,

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:10.079
no, I won't have anything to do with that
person." Why? Because you have not got the

00:13:10.569 --> 00:13:17.569
pure knowledge. You did not feel the pure
knowledge in that person through your vibrations.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:26.120
Now see how connected it is. Like we can say
the sun and the sunlight, what is the difference

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:32.490
between the two? Sun is there. When sun comes,
there's sunlight. So what is the difference?

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:39.490
Or we can say the moon and the moonlight;
what is the difference? There is no difference

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:46.740
in these two things -- one is the moon and
another is the light. So all these things

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:54.649
are very, very confusing, that we don't
understand how confused we are about it, and

00:13:55.569 --> 00:14:02.569
we don't understand how our vibrations can
mislead us. Because vibrations are there all

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:13.930
right, but sometimes even if they are missing,
just to justify yourself you will say, "We

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:21.149
have vibrations and we feel that it's very
good, excellent," and later on you'll

00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:23.749
discover that it's not so.

00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:30.749
So even now when we are realized souls, we
should know what is encompassing us, which

00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:38.059
is around us; what is that which makes us
feel that it's all right, it is good, we

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:47.399
should have it. Once we start understanding
that vibrations of pure knowledge are of a

00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:56.430
very different nature, then you're not attached
to that person, you're not attached to that

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:03.430
family, you're not attached to that country
-- nothing. But what you feel is the pure

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:05.639
vibrations coming to you.

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:12.230
This is the point which is very confusing
when you say, "My vibrations are good. I

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:19.230
like those vibrations," and while you jump
into the ocean of filth. Many people have

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:26.319
asked Me, "Mother, why is it sometimes we
make mistakes?" You do not make mistakes.

00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:32.839
It's your ignorance, which is darkness,
and that's why whenever you plunge into

00:15:32.839 --> 00:15:39.839
it you fall into trouble. So to understand
that our knowledge has to be completely clear.

00:15:41.029 --> 00:15:47.619
Like in our house supposing we have a lamp
that's dirty, you cannot get the light.

00:15:47.619 --> 00:15:54.619
In the same way if our heart is not clean
-- specially our heart, if it is not clean,

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:04.319
then we start doing things believing that
it's right, and by which we hurt yourself

00:16:04.319 --> 00:16:11.319
or others. It's a very, very common error
in human nature to identify wrong things as

00:16:14.129 --> 00:16:21.129
right and just to make themselves look such
a great, such a divine thing.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:29.800
As I told you now there are people who want
to, say, divide the country; simple reason

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:36.800
they want to divide. Now they want to divide
this thing because they want to have importance.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:43.850
The few people who want their importance will
instigate others, tell them, "All right,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:50.069
we must have freedom. If we have freedom we'll
have this country for ourselves, then we can

00:16:50.069 --> 00:16:55.720
develop ourselves." Or a part of the country
which is richer, which is better off, they

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.629
will think that "It's all right, we'll
have all the money to ourselves, we'll have

00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:06.629
everything to ourselves," so they divide.
They can divide in the name of religion, in

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:12.690
the name of prosperity -- whatever it is.
But if you divide the country actually you

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:19.690
are facing a big problem, because you have
seen that wherever people divide they fall

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:26.900
into a kind of a dark, dark dungeon from where
they cannot come out. It's just a few people

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:39.300
whose ego is that they want to have some land
as their own, but they die; not only die,

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:48.940
some of them are murdered, and like that all
that idea that "We'll have this possession

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.100
of the land" goes away.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:58.100
So in the same way we can see on smaller things
also. In smaller things also we are very much

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.780
identified, that "If I have this thing then
everything will be fine." You cannot understand

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:11.780
how people just jump at things and say, "Oh
Mother, this is ours, this is ours, we must

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:19.300
do this for ourselves," openly. They don't
think it's wrong to say that "This is

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:26.360
my country; I must do for my country." And
another says that "This is my country; I

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:33.360
must do for my country." As long as there
is this "my and I" that means there is

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.680
no knowledge.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:41.090
The knowledge as I told you, pure knowledge
is that which gives you a pure light. Pure

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:47.020
light means pure vibrations. Now vibrations
can be misleading as I told you, or could

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:53.730
be the quantity of vibrations can be less
or more. But there's another way to see

00:18:53.730 --> 00:19:00.240
-- is to see for yourself, why do you want
to do a particular thing? Mental also you

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:07.240
can use, parameter of mental understanding.
"Why do I want to do it? What is the gain

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.940
for all the people?" If you start thinking
from that angle that "What is the gain for

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:18.310
others, what will they gain by this, why should
I do it?" -- you'll be amazed. You will

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.590
get the real picture of what you are doing.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:29.590
So you must keep yourself all the time in
a state where you witness yourself. You see

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:37.320
yourself, that "Why am I doing this? What
is the purpose?" Sometimes it could be some

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.480
conditioning, could be some sort of a psychological
thing, could be anything. But if you start

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:49.480
watching carefully "Why I'm doing it?"
you'd be amazed that your vibrations itself

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:56.540
will start telling you on your fingertips.
But sometimes the vibrations are so superficially

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:02.290
coming, "Ah, I got the vibrations, I'm
this, I'm that." For this reason I am

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:08.620
saying again and again, though you are such
a nice family of Mine and we are all so much

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:15.620
blessed and we have so much of knowledge with
us, we should be very wise. If there is no

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:24.880
wisdom, if there is no wisdom, we can never
understand what we are doing.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:31.560
Now to develop this wisdom, what have you
to do? See every time, if I say anything they'll

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:38.010
come otherwise, "Mother, how do we get wisdom?
What is the way to get the wisdom?" Wisdom

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:43.840
you have already within you, Shri Ganesha
is already there, who gives you the wisdom.

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:50.840
But you must take to Shri Ganesh. There I
find people become so much addicted to Shri

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:57.870
Ganesh that they lose His identity completely,
they become very slavish about the whole thing

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:10.730
and they just believe that, oh, they are very
spiritual, they are very great. All these

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.070
false ideas are no good.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:21.570
Does your Ganesha gives you wisdom? Now you
must count, how many wise things have you

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:28.570
done so far? Where did you take a very wise
decision? Have you been wise to do something,

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:39.590
or you have been just doing it because you
are identified with a particular type of life

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:46.590
or particular type of answer? So wisdom is
a thing that gives you, first of all, complete

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:54.920
peace. If your wisdom is developed then you
become very peaceful. Because whatever people

00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:01.110
may say, whatever they may do, whatever aggression
they may do, whatever it is, you are peaceful.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:07.060
And you see the stupidity of the other person,
of the other nations, and you understand why

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:08.300
they are doing it.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:15.300
This wisdom is such an important thing in
human being, because animals don't have

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:22.660
so much wisdom as we have. Sometimes of course,
sometimes we have even less than animals have.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:29.710
But still, by experience, you see, we have
to learn that we have been making mistakes.

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:35.410
So many mistakes we have committed so far.
Now are we going to commit more mistakes or

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:42.410
are we going to be wise? Wisdom is not apparent
outside. You can't say somebody is wise

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:50.730
by looking at that person, but in vibrations
you will know that that person is extremely

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:57.730
wise. He may speak; he may not speak. If he
speaks he'll speak about something so deep,

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:06.380
so wise, and so nice, without hurting you.
This kind of a temperament if you develop

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.900
is to become wise for every question.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:17.430
For example, some are very attached to their
children; so much attached that they forget

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:23.870
that they are part and parcel of this divine
Force, and they just start doing all kinds

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:30.170
of things. The other day I met one lady whose
son was very sick, and she took him to the

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:36.230
hospital and doctors gave him all kinds of
medicines, and he became even worse. Then

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:41.320
she telephones to Me, "Mother, I don't
know what happened, I went to the doctor and

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.690
doctor gave him this and that treatment, and
the child has become sick." But why didn't

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:53.690
you ask Me before? Why did you go to the hospital
first? Lack of wisdom. I'm there, why don't

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.510
you ask?

00:23:56.510 --> 00:24:03.510
We had one case here in Cabella. There was
one child who fell down and broke his arm.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.220
Now the mother didn't show any wisdom. She
took the child to the hospital and the doctor

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.920
said, "Tomorrow we are going to operate
her and put some artificial arm inside."

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:20.330
But the father was sensible. He said, "All
right, tomorrow, no? Today I'll take the

00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:21.380
child at home."

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.500
He brought the child to Me in the night about
three o'clock. I said, "All right."

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.840
I put it right.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.000
Next day when he took it to the hospital the
doctor said, "But now there's no need

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.120
to operate because his arm is all right."

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:42.200
See the difference? One is worried, immediately
they'll go to the doctor, instead of consulting

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:48.650
Me, asking Me. They are Sahaja yogis, but
they will go and ask the doctor to do something

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:54.430
or other. Once the doctors start doing something
then they'll come to Me. There's lots

00:24:54.430 --> 00:25:01.430
of miracles must have taken place about Sahaja
Yoga, I must say, and in that you should see

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:09.020
the wisdom helps you. Of course My attention
is there always, no doubt, but still you should

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:15.130
not take it for granted; you have to ask.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:20.610
One day, you see, I was just sitting; I just
thought that I should telephone somebody in

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:27.610
the ashram of New York. I never telephone
there. So I found out the phone number, we

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:35.610
telephoned and asked if ... I said, "Is
the child all right?" So the leader there

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:46.310
was surprised, because that boy had fallen
in the water and was in the water for quite

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:53.310
some time, and he was all filled with water,
even his brain was filled with water. As usual

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.670
there were some doctors who said that he cannot
survive and even if he survives, his brain

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.910
has so much water that he cannot be normal.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:09.370
So I just said that "Don't worry." I
didn't know. Nobody told Me. "Don't

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:16.370
worry. The boy will be all right completely."
So they were surprised how I said so. Firstly

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.230
how I knew that the boy had fallen, there
was some boy like that. And then they didn't

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:30.230
know how I said he'll be all right, and
he was all right. He's perfectly all right.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:38.710
So they were surprised at My knowing about
it -- how is it that Mother knows that there's

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:43.320
a boy who is so sick?

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:50.320
Here I will say it is pure knowledge. You
see, My attention is always around you people,

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:59.740
always dealing with you people. And how I
know is this: that this attention of Mine

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:07.700
is global; so anything happens to you, any
upsetting takes place, any, I should say,

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:16.480
deviation takes place -- My attention is
there. And immediately I know there's something

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.480
wrong somewhere, and I don't know how My
attention goes to particular places, which

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:31.220
makes it ... life better, it helps people
in need. I don't do anything about this

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:40.430
attention but this attention is the wisdom,
the wisdom that spreads all over. With that

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:47.430
wisdom you know what's wrong with another
person or any other organization that is in

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:55.210
Sahaja Yoga. Everything you come to know.
If you want to know it's different, it just

00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:01.070
you know. Like you spread out everywhere.
For example, if you have to telephone, then

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:05.890
you have to use the telephone, but for Me
I don't have to use the telephone, I just

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:06.250
know.

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:13.250
So this has come from a pure innocent wisdom.
The innocent wisdom is just like a child -- it

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:22.810
is everywhere, and it communicates and it
tells what's the matter, what's the problem

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:28.490
is. Many people have been cured with Sahaja
Yoga, many have been cured. Now if they can

00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:34.320
say that "Mother, how did we get cured,
what have You done? Did You see our chakras?

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:40.260
Did You find out what was wrong with us?"
No, I haven't. I haven't, but I leave

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:47.260
it, in My wisdom I leave it to Paramchaitanya
to do the job. This is the main point is,

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:54.880
that can you leave everything to Paramchaitanya
in your wisdom? If you cannot, then yet you

00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:01.880
have not felt the real knowledge within you.
That is the level of some people are. I am

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:08.590
not now so sure about those who get realization
are all so much filled with pure knowledge.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:15.590
Some of them are, but not all of them. With
experience they learn. With meeting people,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:24.240
they learn. But as the wisdom, pure wisdom,
is difficult for them because they do not

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:34.580
rely entirely on the Paramchaitanya. Everything
happens, just Paramchaitanya knows, it understands,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:42.300
it organizes, it loves, it does everything.
That's the Energy it is. It does everything.

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:53.180
And how it manages, how we call coincidences
are really organized by Paramchaitanya.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:30:00.370
As I told you yesterday the way the rain was,
the rain came and went away. It has wisdom.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:12.180
Innately it knows I am sitting here, the program
is going to start -- stops. Flowers know

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:18.310
Me. You don't know, when we have flowers
they are of this size, I don't do anything

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:23.130
to them; they start growing, growing like
this, they blast like that. Now one would

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:30.130
say, "Mother, how do they know?" Because
they are natural. We are unnatural. We have

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:36.680
taken so many artificialities as part and
parcel of life. See all kinds of courtesies,

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:43.680
this, that -- all that's not necessary.
All these stupid practices that we have adopted

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:52.010
sometimes keep us away from pure knowledge.
And when there's no pure knowledge, we don't

00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:56.810
know anything what's happening. We just
get frightened for small things, upset for

00:30:56.810 --> 00:31:03.760
something. I mean it's something very surprising
to see Sahaja yogis getting upset.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:10.760
Among the hundred people if supposing there's
a problem, so if you are a Sahaja yogi you

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:18.710
have to just witness, and see. If you cannot
do that then you are not a Sahaja yogi. But

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:28.270
it's not like practicing, you know, like
they say if you have to have the blessings

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:37.600
of Shiva, you must say a hundred-and-eight
times His name. That's not the way -- He

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:44.600
doesn't like it. You see, nobody likes that
kind of a murmuring. You see somebody comes

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.960
and takes your name all the time near your
door, you will throw him out. So that's

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:55.960
not the way, this is a wrong idea that you
go on taking the name of somebody and that

00:31:56.770 --> 00:32:03.770
deity will help you. First of all you have
to become wise enough to understand that you

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:14.030
are a part and parcel of Paramchaitanya. Everything
will work out by that, and it works out so

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.950
beautifully. Of course some people have hard
time, I don't say they don't have. But

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:27.950
it is not hard, because if you are one with
Paramchaitanya and you know that it is doing

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:34.930
the job, you are not feeling that hardness
or sickness or anything.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:41.440
All the people who'll write to Me about
their problems, I don't know what to say.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:48.440
Could just say that "Do you believe in Paramchaitanya?"
All right. It knows. It knows what is to be

00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:56.430
done. It knows what is to be corrected. It
knows what is to be said. See, it can create

00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:01.760
poetry, it can create music, it can create
everything; but do you leave everything to

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:08.760
the Paramchaitanya? This is the second point
in wisdom: do you have wisdom to leave everything

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.550
to Paramchaitanya?

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:19.070
After experiencing also. Like there was one
lady who was going in the car and she found

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:26.070
her car and the brakes weren't braking,
and she didn't know what to do. Now if the

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:31.710
brakes are no more, how will she manage? It
was in Germany, and all the cars were moving

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:38.660
very fast, and she didn't know what to do.
So she put her head on the steering wheel

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:45.660
and she said, "I leave it to Paramchaitanya."
She said, she leaves it to Me -- all right,

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:51.920
this is the same. So by saying that, what
happened? She said, "Mother I don't know,

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:58.920
when I raised my head I found my car was taken
on one side of the road and nobody was there.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:08.570
All the cars were passing by, but somehow
or other this car was taken there very nicely

00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:13.740
by some Force."

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:20.740
So the wisdom lies in understanding the working
of Paramchaitanya: how it guides you, how

00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:28.009
it helps you, how it preserves you; how, depending
on Paramchaitanya, you can continue to be

00:34:28.009 --> 00:34:35.009
living very happily. I think in Sahaja Yoga
we have lost very few Sahaja yogis. They live

00:34:38.529 --> 00:34:43.259
for long, they don't die, and if you ask
their experiences, it's very amazing how

00:34:43.259 --> 00:34:50.259
it works out. If they don't want to live
also they can pass, but if they want to live,

00:34:54.399 --> 00:34:59.930
Paramchaitanya takes over and you can live
long. But living long doesn't mean that

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:03.859
you go on bothering yourself as to what you
will do with your money, how will you live,

00:35:03.859 --> 00:35:10.609
what will be the source. All these nonsensical
things, worries, come to you, all right. Then

00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:17.609
the Paramchaitanya says, "All right, go
on worrying." If you go on worrying, all

00:35:19.309 --> 00:35:26.309
right go on worrying, doesn't matter. What
will happen? Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.700
But Paramchaitanya can interfere, in case
you leave it to Paramchaitanya. It's said

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:40.630
many a times, "Leave it to God, leave it
to God," but "God" means ... I don't

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:47.630
know what they mean by God. God means Paramchaitanya,
God means living divine Force that is working

00:35:51.509 --> 00:35:52.309
everything.

00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:58.029
So the another way of looking at it is the
wisdom that we should understand, that each

00:35:58.029 --> 00:36:05.029
and every particle of this world is created
by Divine, by the divine Force. And this particle

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:14.039
and everything is completely under the guidance
and supervision of Paramchaitanya. Nothing

00:36:16.619 --> 00:36:23.509
can move unless until Paramachaitanya works
on them. It is something so connected, globally

00:36:23.509 --> 00:36:30.509
it's so much there that people don't realize
what they are doing, what they should have

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:38.700
done. I mean on many scales you find something
happening. Like supposing something is happening

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:45.970
now in America. Just try to find out what
America has done to other countries; immediately

00:36:47.859 --> 00:36:51.200
you'll get the answer.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:58.200
So also it takes full care of the persons
who believe in Paramchaitanya, who give everything

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:07.640
in the hands of Paramchaitanya. We give things
to the police, we'll give to the doctors,

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:14.640
we give it to the some civil people, civil
what you call them, engineers to do some things.

00:37:17.359 --> 00:37:24.359
But they can make mistakes; they can create
problems. But you leave it to Paramchaitanya.

00:37:27.940 --> 00:37:34.940
It's something so remarkable that in My
own life I have seen that all the time it

00:37:36.019 --> 00:37:38.749
works for Me.

00:37:38.749 --> 00:37:45.749
I was building a house in Pune and we had
to put a slab -- very, very big slab; needed

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:55.180
about three hundred bags of cement for that.
So I got the cement and I got the people,

00:37:56.069 --> 00:38:01.400
but they said, "You're to start early
in the morning and you can finish next morning,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.519
twenty-four hours."

00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:07.599
I said, "All right." So at about five
o'clock I told, "Let's go, the work

00:38:07.599 --> 00:38:08.059
is over."

00:38:08.059 --> 00:38:09.420
They said, "How do you know?"

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.319
I said, "I know, let's go and see."

00:38:13.319 --> 00:38:19.039
So imagine, which was going to finish after
twelve hours was already finished and all

00:38:19.039 --> 00:38:23.880
the workers were walking about. And everybody
said, "Mother, it's a miracle. How can

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.829
such a big slab be laid in such a short time?"

00:38:27.829 --> 00:38:32.680
I said, you see, to make them understand I
said, "Must be Hanumana must have done the

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.039
job."

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:39.150
But all these people, all these deities are
part and parcel of that Paramchaitanya. Now

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:45.599
you are worshipping the Mother. To worship
the Mother is the biggest thing because all

00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:52.599
these deities and everybody are Her children,
under Her command, under Her desire. So to

00:38:53.170 --> 00:39:00.170
worship the Mother, the story of as you know
about Ganesha, that the Mother said that "The

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:10.230
one who goes round the Mother Earth three
times, I will give Him a present."

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:15.440
So Shri Ganesha thought in His wisdom, "Who
is greater than My Mother? No one else."

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:22.440
Because He knew He cannot compete with His
brother who has got a peacock for a conveyance.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:31.450
So He said, "How can I go round and win
over this person?" So best is to take to

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:44.640
wisdom. "My Mother is greater than everything
else." So He went around His Mother three

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:51.640
times and He got the prize, and the other
brother was just still moving on. When He

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:56.160
came back He found that the present is already
lost.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:03.160
So again and again I'll say it is the wisdom
that helps you, the wisdom to leave everything

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:10.529
to Paramchaitanya. And this is something,
for a modern person, very difficult to understand.

00:40:10.529 --> 00:40:17.529
He can't calculate two plus two. He's
so bad because of this computers and things

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:25.930
like that, is absolutely hopeless as far as
any mathematical calculations are needed or...

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:36.599
Now I am, I must say, I don't know how to
handle any computer or any calculator; but

00:40:38.809 --> 00:40:43.859
if you ask Me just like that, "Mother, how
much will it be?" I'll say so much, and

00:40:43.859 --> 00:40:50.859
it will be that. It will be that. But I am
so sure about it, it cannot be anything else

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:59.690
but that, and it works that way. Sometimes
of course, if I want to tell some wrong thing

00:41:02.869 --> 00:41:08.940
just to mislead the person then I may say
something, but normally I know it is that.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:15.940
But I know not like the way we know; I just
know it, that's what it is, just know it.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:23.890
So I am not saying that you develop your knowledge
to that extent that you can do it, but your

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:32.739
wisdom. If you start using your wisdom, it
will always come handy. In anything that you

00:41:32.739 --> 00:41:36.819
do, think of the wisdom.

00:41:36.819 --> 00:41:43.819
My advice to you is that as your Mother loves
the whole world, loves all of you, and cares

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:54.930
for those who haven't even got realization,
you should also strive to create more people

00:41:55.079 --> 00:42:01.029
for Sahaja Yoga. But in that if you start
behaving in a manner all the time saying,

00:42:01.029 --> 00:42:06.079
"You are catching this, you are a bhoot,
you are this, you are that." I never said

00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:12.970
that to anyone, so you shouldn't say like
that. That's no love, that's no understanding.

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:19.970
The understanding is that you were just the
same as the person was and now you are knowledgeable,

00:42:21.859 --> 00:42:28.859
so you must use your knowledge to correct
that person, not to put him down. And that

00:42:29.579 --> 00:42:35.839
correction is also not verbal; it's just
through your vibrations you can correct the

00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:42.410
other person. Most of the Sahaja Yoga work
sometimes I've seen that it stops because

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:47.690
we are very methodical, we become like great
teachers, we start telling them stories, and

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:53.630
then they get fed up with you.

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:58.759
So when you are handling other people, as
I said, we have to spread the knowledge, very

00:42:58.759 --> 00:43:05.759
important, we cannot keep it to ourselves.
But it's not for any ambition, for any leadership,

00:43:05.759 --> 00:43:12.759
for any kind of recognition; but just the
use of our wisdom, use of our knowledge that

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:21.630
we want to help others out of love. Not for
any recognition, not for any position, nothing

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:28.670
-- just we want to do it because we love
them. And I am sure this will work out very

00:43:30.509 --> 00:43:36.650
effectively. And the person who will be helped,
or the persons who will be helped will be

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:41.749
just, be bound to you because they find the
true knowledge.

00:43:41.749 --> 00:43:47.180
But supposing somebody comes to you and says,
"I know the true knowledge."

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.220
You say, "You might be knowing, but I have
to know what you know."

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:57.519
Then you ask that person; then he'll give
you a big lecture. You should say, "No,

00:43:57.519 --> 00:44:01.900
that's not the thing." Just smile. Say,
"That's not the thing."

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:08.900
The thing is, true knowledge is a part and
parcel of your being. It's just within you.

00:44:12.529 --> 00:44:19.529
It is not some sort of a concrete stuff that
you have read or you have understood, but

00:44:20.359 --> 00:44:27.359
it just has become a light within you, and
that light is there. It has no ... it's

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:36.440
no necessity for you to be very well educated,
or to be very intelligent, or to be very highly

00:44:36.609 --> 00:44:43.609
placed, not necessary. It is how your heart
is clean. In the heart it resides. Imagine,

00:44:46.789 --> 00:44:52.650
all other knowledge resides in the brain,
while the pure knowledge resides in the heart.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:58.059
Very surprising.
But we do not know also that actually our

00:44:58.059 --> 00:45:00.940
heart rules the head.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:07.940
There are seven auras around the heart which
control the brain in such a manner that we

00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:15.809
act in the hands of the Paramchaitanya. Unless
and until your heart is clean, unless and

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:22.920
until in your heart you have a beautiful image
of a person who is very, very pure, you cannot,

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:38.660
you cannot do anything mentally. And from
your heart if you have to do, your heart has

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:46.690
to be very clean and extremely wise. This
is the point one has to jump into: that your

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:54.380
heart, is it wise? For example, to get attached
to someone too much, identified with some

00:45:55.450 --> 00:46:00.539
much shows that your heart is not clean. It
has so many bondages.

00:46:00.539 --> 00:46:07.539
Open your heart, fully. And that's why they
say that the Goddess resides in the Heart,

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:17.470
in the center Heart. She resides in the center
Heart because She's so balanced. She resides

00:46:19.029 --> 00:46:26.029
in the center Heart as Shakti, and She gives
you all that you want. Within you She's

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:34.660
settled down as many things. You know the
Shlokas which says that She's settled within

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:41.660
us like knowledge, She's settled within
us as memory, She is settled within us as

00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:50.839
sleep, also She's settled within us as illusion,
bhranti. She's the one who puts us into

00:46:53.509 --> 00:47:00.509
illusions because we are not yet fully perfected.
We have to become paripakwa -- means absolutely,

00:47:04.839 --> 00:47:11.839
absolutely matured. Till we are matured this
Mother Herself puts you into illusions and

00:47:17.539 --> 00:47:21.529
plays around, so that you learn how to be
wise.

00:47:21.529 --> 00:47:26.410
So one should understand that She's playing
around with you. And you should try to be

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:33.410
very careful and not to be falling into Her
maya, because if She puts you in the maya,

00:47:33.729 --> 00:47:40.729
you'll go round and round and you will reach
nowhere. So this power of bhranti is also

00:47:41.859 --> 00:47:48.400
very important, this delusion you can call
it; or else you can call it a thing by which

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:55.400
She creates a drama, in which you become like
a stupid man being found out. So this stupidity

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:07.650
and all that can be removed by this bhranti
that She creates. And this power of bhranti

00:48:09.769 --> 00:48:16.769
is because of human beings as they are, because
they will not understand something straightforward;

00:48:17.839 --> 00:48:23.259
so it has to go round and round, till they
reach a point to understand that it was the

00:48:23.259 --> 00:48:29.479
play of the Mother that brought them to this
shore of wisdom.

00:48:29.479 --> 00:48:36.479
So for us it is important to see that so much
has been done by Paramchaitanya for us, the

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:45.720
Mother has done so much for us. Now what are
we going to do ourselves to get all these

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:53.210
powers that She has given us, to be completely
enlightened and developed? What have we done

00:48:53.509 --> 00:49:00.509
so far? Nothing to be done as such but to
develop a kind of a deep devotion, deep understanding;

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:15.890
and that depth is possible, absolutely possible,
because now you are on your way to that perfection.

00:49:18.079 --> 00:49:25.079
So today in Cabella is the last puja, and
I want to tell you as a Mother that you all

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:34.710
should depend on Paramchaitanya. That's
very important, to depend on Paramchaitanya.

00:49:35.779 --> 00:49:41.839
Also there's a habit of many people to put
the blame on others, like, "I got caught

00:49:41.839 --> 00:49:47.049
up from this person and got caught up from
that person." You are caught up by yourself

00:49:47.049 --> 00:49:54.049
only. All such ideas are of no use. Face yourself,
find out about yourself, and you have to perfect

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:58.390
yourself.

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:05.099
That's so important, because at this juncture
of the time people think that something great

00:50:05.099 --> 00:50:12.099
is going to happen. I don't know. Two thousand
years according to them would be something

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:17.579
great, but I don't know, because is all
man-made, all this two thousand year and three

00:50:17.579 --> 00:50:24.579
thousand year is man-made. But I Myself feel,
as predicted by many, that possibly because

00:50:26.319 --> 00:50:33.319
of your understanding and your wisdom I'm
sure something great may happen in this world,

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:41.220
and things may be brought to a proper level
of understanding of spirituality. Because

00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:47.039
this is the Last Judgment, and in this Last
Judgment you have to play a very vital role,

00:50:47.039 --> 00:50:54.039
which I am sure you can do it, if you decide
to achieve something for the future.

00:50:55.229 --> 00:50:57.859
May God bless you.
