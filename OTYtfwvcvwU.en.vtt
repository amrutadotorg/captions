00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.358
Now, to know about a thing, you have
to meditate

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:19.548
and improve your vision, which should be
clear-cut.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:25.566
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:30.701
your particular ideas about particular
things,

00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:36.922
but it should be a vision which should be
clear-cut to you.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:42.352
With Sahaja Yoga one has to know
the protection

00:00:42.553 --> 00:00:45.948
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:52.757
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:58.857
I’m sure you will yourself experience it.

00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:05.289
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga
like this,

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.932
you just get meditative, you just get
meditative,

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:17.648
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that – just meditative.

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:24.046
And this meditative temperament, or
whatever is the state - emits vibrations.

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:28.219
It emits and creates a path for you,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.981
for your work, for your life, for
everything.

00:01:33.182 --> 00:01:37.489
You don’t have to struggle with anyone,
you don’t have to fight with anyone,

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.468
you don’t have to argue with anyone.
Just try to meditate

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:47.097
and achieve a state which I am describing
to you,

00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:54.694
where you get completely surrounded by love
and affection.

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:56.391
May God bless you all.
