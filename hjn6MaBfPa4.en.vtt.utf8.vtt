WEBVTT

00:14.160 --> 00:17.920
face yourself

00:18.560 --> 00:21.279
for becoming

00:26.880 --> 00:34.640
and then

00:30.720 --> 00:34.640
the preparation is done

00:38.160 --> 00:41.200
to become something

00:43.840 --> 00:48.879
and on the whole when you know that it

00:45.680 --> 00:52.079
is your ego and superego

00:48.879 --> 00:52.079
which are loading you up

00:53.280 --> 00:59.840
you have to scan them out with vibrato

00:56.840 --> 00:59.840
awareness

01:03.120 --> 01:05.840
now there are two

01:06.799 --> 01:09.360
types of

01:11.280 --> 01:19.360
attention we have to pay

01:15.840 --> 01:19.360
first is a constant attention

01:19.600 --> 01:25.280
that is a routine of a sahaja yogi

01:22.640 --> 01:27.840
and the second one is the emergency

01:25.280 --> 01:27.840
attention

01:31.200 --> 01:34.640
i've been saying that all the sahaja

01:33.119 --> 01:37.680
yogis must start

01:34.640 --> 01:37.680
writing their diaries

01:39.280 --> 01:45.439
one with every day's experiences

01:44.079 --> 01:49.360
if you know that you have to write a

01:45.439 --> 01:49.360
diary you'll keep your mind alert

01:50.240 --> 01:53.759
and another one whenever you get any

01:52.640 --> 01:57.360
special idea

01:53.759 --> 01:58.960
of the past or of the future also to jot

01:57.360 --> 02:01.040
it down so like that you should have two

01:58.960 --> 02:03.439
dice

02:01.040 --> 02:05.280
for your constant attention you have to

02:03.439 --> 02:08.560
fix up your mind

02:05.280 --> 02:09.520
on certain facts the first one as i said

02:08.560 --> 02:12.640
that

02:09.520 --> 02:12.640
if you keep a diary

02:12.800 --> 02:17.599
then you will know that you have to

02:16.080 --> 02:18.640
remember what important things have

02:17.599 --> 02:20.959
happened

02:18.640 --> 02:23.360
so your attention will be alert and

02:20.959 --> 02:26.480
you'll be looking out for such points

02:23.360 --> 02:27.920
where what is the thing you see

02:26.480 --> 02:29.840
and you'll be amazed if you make your

02:27.920 --> 02:34.080
attention alert

02:29.840 --> 02:38.000
what new things come to you

02:34.080 --> 02:40.959
very brilliant ideas

02:38.000 --> 02:42.239
and the miracles of life and the

02:40.959 --> 02:46.640
miracles of

02:42.239 --> 02:49.440
god's beauty and his auspiciousness his

02:46.640 --> 02:51.280
greatness his kindness his blessings how

02:49.440 --> 02:51.680
they work out if you start writing every

02:51.280 --> 02:54.879
day

02:51.680 --> 02:57.360
even two lines about it

02:54.879 --> 02:59.840
it will make your mind constantly

02:57.360 --> 03:04.319
involved with it

02:59.840 --> 03:09.519
that's a human style of doing things

03:04.319 --> 03:09.519
also you can mention in the diary

03:11.120 --> 03:14.959
what happened did you could you do your

03:13.280 --> 03:16.720
meditation did you get your time for

03:14.959 --> 03:20.400
meditation

03:16.720 --> 03:22.879
a little bit as if you are

03:20.400 --> 03:23.760
appearing for some sort of a examination

03:22.879 --> 03:25.680
or something you

03:23.760 --> 03:28.959
prepare a little note like that did i

03:25.680 --> 03:28.959
get up in the morning did i

03:29.440 --> 03:33.840
then any special thought or any special

03:33.920 --> 03:36.400
movement

03:37.599 --> 03:41.360
in the center or left or right also

03:39.760 --> 03:43.360
should be mentioned so that

03:41.360 --> 03:46.799
you keep a watch on your mind it's a

03:43.360 --> 03:50.000
very good thing to maintain a diary

03:46.799 --> 03:52.159
also you will see progressively how your

03:50.000 --> 03:55.200
ideas are changing

03:52.159 --> 03:57.680
how new priorities are settling down how

03:55.200 --> 04:00.959
you give more importance

03:57.680 --> 04:03.280
to real things and very little to unreal

04:00.959 --> 04:03.280
things

04:04.319 --> 04:07.760
i think this is a very very practical

04:06.159 --> 04:10.560
side of human beings

04:07.760 --> 04:13.200
that one should have a diary same

04:10.560 --> 04:16.000
diaries after sometimes

04:13.200 --> 04:17.120
will become historical things and people

04:16.000 --> 04:20.639
would like to see

04:17.120 --> 04:23.840
what you all have written not to be

04:20.639 --> 04:24.800
hypocritical about it or deceptive about

04:23.840 --> 04:28.880
it

04:24.800 --> 04:32.080
but quite truthful and understanding

04:28.880 --> 04:34.560
you should jot down few lies just before

04:32.080 --> 04:34.560
sleeping

04:36.560 --> 04:44.720
now we have to see that we have

04:40.720 --> 04:47.600
problems for superego and ego

04:44.720 --> 04:49.040
now superego is the left side as

04:47.600 --> 04:53.759
darkness

04:49.040 --> 04:56.800
tamagura and our past

04:53.759 --> 04:58.160
those who have left side problems should

04:56.800 --> 05:00.560
think of the future

04:58.160 --> 05:01.840
use them balance if they think of the

05:00.560 --> 05:07.039
future

05:01.840 --> 05:11.360
for example a person

05:07.039 --> 05:13.600
who is lethargic should take to working

05:11.360 --> 05:15.840
put your mind into working for the

05:13.600 --> 05:19.199
future planning what to do where to go

05:15.840 --> 05:22.880
how to do that will keep you

05:19.199 --> 05:27.120
away from drag up the

05:22.880 --> 05:29.039
left side and

05:27.120 --> 05:31.360
gradually then you can balance yourself

05:29.039 --> 05:31.360
also

05:35.039 --> 05:43.039
now the right side

05:39.759 --> 05:45.280
of a person when it is activated very

05:43.039 --> 05:45.280
much

05:46.560 --> 05:49.680
he has to balance it

05:50.560 --> 05:55.360
not with the left side but with the

05:52.960 --> 05:59.840
center

05:55.360 --> 05:59.840
that is a person who is very hardworking

06:02.720 --> 06:12.479
must develop a witness statement

06:07.759 --> 06:14.960
you try to do a work any work

06:12.479 --> 06:17.280
indulge into work in thoughtless

06:14.960 --> 06:21.919
awareness

06:17.280 --> 06:26.240
as a witness whatever work you are doing

06:21.919 --> 06:26.240
you just say that i am not doing it

06:26.880 --> 06:30.960
this you can do it after realization

06:29.360 --> 06:34.240
become thoughtlessly aware

06:30.960 --> 06:37.120
and start doing your work

06:34.240 --> 06:39.039
so the compensation of the left side is

06:37.120 --> 06:40.720
done by movement to the right

06:39.039 --> 06:43.600
and of the right side movement in the

06:40.720 --> 06:45.919
center left side is the tamaguna

06:43.600 --> 06:47.759
right side is the rajoguna the center is

06:45.919 --> 06:50.560
the septum

06:47.759 --> 06:51.599
still these are three good eyes that's

06:50.560 --> 06:54.160
not the state

06:51.599 --> 06:55.919
which you have to achieve about this

06:54.160 --> 06:58.800
i'll tell you tomorrow more

06:55.919 --> 06:58.800
how to go further

06:59.120 --> 07:07.280
after scanning out which side is weak

07:03.280 --> 07:09.120
you should plan out your style of life

07:07.280 --> 07:10.639
for example if you are extremely

07:09.120 --> 07:11.919
lethargic you cannot get up in the

07:10.639 --> 07:13.680
morning

07:11.919 --> 07:17.039
you feel very sleepy in the night you do

07:13.680 --> 07:19.120
not feel alerted then start planning

07:17.039 --> 07:21.520
as to what will you do how will you get

07:19.120 --> 07:23.280
up even puja is a good idea

07:21.520 --> 07:24.639
home is a good idea do something like

07:23.280 --> 07:26.720
that you see so that

07:24.639 --> 07:28.400
you have to do something what you call

07:26.720 --> 07:30.880
the kriya is the action

07:28.400 --> 07:32.479
get into the action some sort of action

07:30.880 --> 07:36.240
you're going to

07:32.479 --> 07:37.680
in sahaja yoga as well as in your daily

07:36.240 --> 07:40.319
life

07:37.680 --> 07:42.080
you'll be able to change that mood and

07:40.319 --> 07:43.759
come to the right side

07:42.080 --> 07:45.199
and then you go to the move your

07:43.759 --> 07:50.160
movement should be towards the

07:45.199 --> 07:50.160
satyaguna is to watch everything

07:50.800 --> 07:55.360
now at this point where you are in the

07:52.960 --> 07:55.360
center

07:56.879 --> 07:59.840
you have to see

07:59.919 --> 08:03.520
how much you are misidentified

08:04.000 --> 08:11.280
so supposing you are at the first stage

08:07.759 --> 08:14.560
of left side then you will just

08:11.280 --> 08:15.840
do dreaming oh this person is so much

08:14.560 --> 08:17.759
identified that one is so much

08:15.840 --> 08:20.720
identified as if you are the best

08:17.759 --> 08:22.240
is human nature you see well that person

08:20.720 --> 08:24.319
is like that he's like that

08:22.240 --> 08:26.319
this is very bad in the society that is

08:24.319 --> 08:28.560
going bad in the society

08:26.319 --> 08:30.400
it's better then we can also go to this

08:28.560 --> 08:32.000
limitless to that guru is very bad

08:30.400 --> 08:34.240
and that one is another mad gap like

08:32.000 --> 08:36.240
that this is all day dreaming going on

08:34.240 --> 08:37.680
how far it is affecting you how far you

08:36.240 --> 08:40.640
are improving by that is not

08:37.680 --> 08:42.560
it's just you see thinking analyzing it

08:40.640 --> 08:44.560
it's insane this stuff

08:42.560 --> 08:46.000
sitting down and just analyzing it's

08:44.560 --> 08:49.040
amazing stuff

08:46.000 --> 08:51.040
the second thing could be

08:49.040 --> 08:52.880
when you come to the second side of it

08:51.040 --> 08:54.560
is the kriya

08:52.880 --> 08:56.640
then what happens when you start doing

08:54.560 --> 08:58.399
it

08:56.640 --> 08:59.920
then at least your attention is on what

08:58.399 --> 09:01.760
you are doing

08:59.920 --> 09:04.080
it's not allowed to drift into something

09:01.760 --> 09:05.600
and which goes into any nonsense and can

09:04.080 --> 09:08.160
i mean then you don't know from where

09:05.600 --> 09:10.320
the funny thoughts are coming

09:08.160 --> 09:12.320
so you start doing something you can go

09:10.320 --> 09:14.160
and plant some trees or you can go and

09:12.320 --> 09:15.839
plant some

09:14.160 --> 09:17.360
flowers or if you want you can do some

09:15.839 --> 09:20.560
cooking you can do some work

09:17.360 --> 09:24.240
take to work that will help you

09:20.560 --> 09:26.640
any work but while doing the work

09:24.240 --> 09:28.240
the problem will be you'll develop ego

09:26.640 --> 09:29.600
that's why when you are developing the

09:28.240 --> 09:32.560
ego

09:29.600 --> 09:33.279
you have to tell yourself you are not

09:32.560 --> 09:36.080
doing mister

09:33.279 --> 09:37.200
this you are not doing this is not doing

09:36.080 --> 09:39.600
you are not doing

09:37.200 --> 09:41.279
if you go on suggesting to yourself mr

09:39.600 --> 09:42.720
ego will not come

09:41.279 --> 09:44.720
and then many things you see which

09:42.720 --> 09:45.200
normally trouble you and trouble others

09:44.720 --> 09:47.760
like

09:45.200 --> 09:49.440
you have cleaned the room all right then

09:47.760 --> 09:51.680
somebody comes and spoils it you get

09:49.440 --> 09:53.360
angry with that person

09:51.680 --> 09:55.040
naturally because you think you have

09:53.360 --> 09:56.640
done

09:55.040 --> 09:57.920
first of all you don't clean the room if

09:56.640 --> 09:59.600
you clean the room then you'll be

09:57.920 --> 10:02.080
prepared it will be dirty otherwise you

09:59.600 --> 10:02.080
do clean

10:02.880 --> 10:08.880
now if it is dirty well and good if it

10:05.600 --> 10:08.880
is not directed well and good

10:09.440 --> 10:16.000
this type of attitude you should take

10:12.880 --> 10:18.880
to jump onto saturn on sattva guna you

10:16.000 --> 10:20.079
start accepting it you become extremely

10:18.880 --> 10:23.440
mild

10:20.079 --> 10:26.800
you become a mild personality then

10:23.440 --> 10:29.680
at that time you do not discuss as to

10:26.800 --> 10:31.120
oh i don't like it this was wrong this

10:29.680 --> 10:32.800
should not have been all these things do

10:31.120 --> 10:36.640
not come to you in saturn

10:32.800 --> 10:38.480
you start seeing it that time you see

10:36.640 --> 10:41.920
that all right doesn't matter it's done

10:38.480 --> 10:45.279
it's time on the contrary you feel hurt

10:41.920 --> 10:47.519
if you are a satyaguni that

10:45.279 --> 10:50.160
by any suggestion you have suggested

10:47.519 --> 10:50.160
your ego

10:50.480 --> 10:54.880
can you get that point you feel ashamed

10:53.600 --> 10:57.519
of your ego i mean to say

10:54.880 --> 10:58.800
if you are a sabzi for example even to

10:57.519 --> 11:01.519
say that this is my car

10:58.800 --> 11:02.560
you will feel shy that's a sattvuli

11:01.519 --> 11:04.480
style

11:02.560 --> 11:06.399
or even to say why did you spoil my

11:04.480 --> 11:08.320
carpet i mean in india nobody will say

11:06.399 --> 11:10.000
i can tell you this regarded bad manners

11:08.320 --> 11:11.440
absolute bad manners

11:10.000 --> 11:12.800
if anybody comes to your house and the

11:11.440 --> 11:13.200
carpet is well they sell it doesn't

11:12.800 --> 11:14.480
matter

11:13.200 --> 11:17.120
even it is brought i don't know let it

11:14.480 --> 11:17.120
be auto burnt

11:17.440 --> 11:20.800
they'll never say that you're burnt by

11:19.120 --> 11:24.160
carpet or done anything to my

11:20.800 --> 11:24.959
is regarded bad manners like here you

11:24.160 --> 11:27.760
see

11:24.959 --> 11:28.160
somebody sleeping somebody makes the

11:27.760 --> 11:29.600
noise

11:28.160 --> 11:31.279
the person who is sleeping will never

11:29.600 --> 11:34.079
say that you are making noise

11:31.279 --> 11:36.880
let me get it he'll just get up and ask

11:34.079 --> 11:36.880
do you need anything

11:37.760 --> 11:41.040
that's difficult for people here to

11:39.279 --> 11:43.360
understand because ego is

11:41.040 --> 11:44.720
just sitting on there but these bad

11:43.360 --> 11:46.160
manners

11:44.720 --> 11:48.160
there you will find when you will go to

11:46.160 --> 11:49.279
india you'll find this these are bad

11:48.160 --> 11:52.240
manners

11:49.279 --> 11:53.200
to say that or to say oh i feel very

11:52.240 --> 11:54.959
comfortable

11:53.200 --> 11:57.680
i mean to say i feel comfortable is bad

11:54.959 --> 12:00.880
manners i mean they never say

11:57.680 --> 12:02.720
i like it so what

12:00.880 --> 12:04.720
all these words are not to be said if

12:02.720 --> 12:05.680
you are in satragoni then you just don't

12:04.720 --> 12:10.480
say

12:05.680 --> 12:12.880
you say do you like it is it comfortable

12:10.480 --> 12:16.240
would like to have this before attention

12:12.880 --> 12:16.240
goes from your side

12:17.120 --> 12:20.000
you understand that

12:20.639 --> 12:24.320
that is the style one has to develop

12:22.880 --> 12:26.240
then you are a satwa guri

12:24.320 --> 12:27.440
otherwise you are still on ego trip you

12:26.240 --> 12:32.079
see whatever you may say

12:27.440 --> 12:32.079
i don't like that i don't i who are you

12:33.279 --> 12:36.320
first of all ask the question who are

12:34.720 --> 12:38.240
you

12:36.320 --> 12:41.360
if god says i don't like you i can

12:38.240 --> 12:44.000
understand the reasons

12:41.360 --> 12:47.440
but for you to say i don't like it after

12:44.000 --> 12:47.440
all how did you come on this earth

12:49.040 --> 12:53.920
how did you get a human birth

12:52.399 --> 12:56.320
how did you get all these things nothing

12:53.920 --> 12:56.320
like that

12:56.560 --> 12:59.040
who am i

13:01.680 --> 13:07.600
i am nothing everybody who thinks i am

13:05.920 --> 13:09.440
something he should know

13:07.600 --> 13:11.040
that he is nothing makes no difference

13:09.440 --> 13:12.480
to god whether he exists or does not

13:11.040 --> 13:15.440
exist you see

13:12.480 --> 13:15.440
he's not he's just

13:16.720 --> 13:21.680
so this point if you understand that

13:19.760 --> 13:23.760
even if you do something any work you do

13:21.680 --> 13:26.880
or anything you are doing

13:23.760 --> 13:29.279
you are just doing it because you want

13:26.880 --> 13:29.279
to do it

13:31.440 --> 13:36.800
that is how you come on to satyaguna

13:34.639 --> 13:38.320
but normally it doesn't happen it

13:36.800 --> 13:40.320
happens the other way around for example

13:38.320 --> 13:44.720
a person

13:40.320 --> 13:48.160
is say

13:44.720 --> 13:50.320
doing something by any chance

13:48.160 --> 13:51.680
he feels hurt or he thinks that whatever

13:50.320 --> 13:53.839
he's done is no good

13:51.680 --> 13:54.880
people don't appreciate or maybe he

13:53.839 --> 13:56.959
might think that

13:54.880 --> 13:58.959
oh it's not up to the point or whatever

13:56.959 --> 14:01.199
it is

13:58.959 --> 14:03.199
then the reaction for him is not that he

14:01.199 --> 14:03.839
does not like to rise to satyaguna but

14:03.199 --> 14:06.959
he rises

14:03.839 --> 14:08.959
he goes back to them

14:06.959 --> 14:10.160
all right i'll not do it i'll sleep over

14:08.959 --> 14:12.959
it let them do it

14:10.160 --> 14:12.959
why should i do it

14:13.440 --> 14:17.600
so the training that you have to have

14:16.240 --> 14:21.199
through your rajaguna

14:17.600 --> 14:22.160
goes the waste it's just a training

14:21.199 --> 14:25.760
period

14:22.160 --> 14:27.519
that you have you are doing something

14:25.760 --> 14:31.440
now in the training period you have to

14:27.519 --> 14:34.720
learn only how to

14:31.440 --> 14:37.040
come in the center for example now

14:34.720 --> 14:40.240
water is required for you to swim if

14:37.040 --> 14:40.240
there is no water you cannot say

14:40.720 --> 14:44.160
all right in the same way rajoguna is

14:43.199 --> 14:47.519
required for you

14:44.160 --> 14:49.360
to come to satyukra

14:47.519 --> 14:52.160
if you do not do any work you cannot

14:49.360 --> 14:52.160
come to satoku

14:52.480 --> 14:56.000
so you are just working just to train

14:54.959 --> 14:58.560
yourself

14:56.000 --> 14:59.440
to be a witness now do you follow that

14:58.560 --> 15:01.360
point

14:59.440 --> 15:02.639
you are not doing it because you like

15:01.360 --> 15:04.480
particular thing you are used to

15:02.639 --> 15:05.040
particular thing because you want to be

15:04.480 --> 15:08.079
this

15:05.040 --> 15:08.079
this is not the way it is

15:08.959 --> 15:13.519
you are just doing it to learn how to be

15:11.440 --> 15:16.880
patient

15:13.519 --> 15:20.079
to practice your patience

15:16.880 --> 15:22.880
to see how much patient you are

15:20.079 --> 15:24.320
once you start doing it you'll be amazed

15:22.880 --> 15:27.839
that you will never feel the burden of

15:24.320 --> 15:27.839
the work

15:28.240 --> 15:34.560
but it never happens most of the people

15:32.000 --> 15:37.440
if they find their work is not effective

15:34.560 --> 15:40.079
they'll go back to tamagona

15:37.440 --> 15:41.440
there are many attitudes say is working

15:40.079 --> 15:41.759
then he thinks why should i do all the

15:41.440 --> 15:44.240
work

15:41.759 --> 15:45.839
others are not doing she'll go back to

15:44.240 --> 15:47.600
their states

15:45.839 --> 15:49.120
but those who are not working will not

15:47.600 --> 15:51.040
think that this person is working let me

15:49.120 --> 15:54.399
also work

15:51.040 --> 15:56.320
it's other way around you see

15:54.399 --> 15:58.720
this can be an attitude of some people

15:56.320 --> 16:01.839
that if this person

15:58.720 --> 16:06.079
is working let him work

16:01.839 --> 16:08.320
this is even a meaner stuff avoid just

16:06.079 --> 16:09.680
you go to a restaurant and somebody

16:08.320 --> 16:12.639
takes out the purse others start looking

16:09.680 --> 16:17.199
this side that's what you mean

16:12.639 --> 16:18.560
i mean everybody should come forward

16:17.199 --> 16:20.399
and once you are paid you played it

16:18.560 --> 16:20.880
finished then you just don't start

16:20.399 --> 16:26.160
counting

16:20.880 --> 16:26.160
why did i pick once you try

16:26.399 --> 16:31.120
or any work has to be done go forward

16:28.639 --> 16:34.399
with it do it with your heart

16:31.120 --> 16:36.079
don't worry if others have not done it

16:34.399 --> 16:37.920
just do it for its pleasure and the

16:36.079 --> 16:39.839
pleasure only you will get

16:37.920 --> 16:41.680
well you will do it with the

16:39.839 --> 16:43.040
understanding that it's a training

16:41.680 --> 16:45.600
period you are better trained than the

16:43.040 --> 16:45.600
other one is

16:46.320 --> 16:50.000
you are at a higher class than the other

16:48.240 --> 16:53.120
one so we have to

16:50.000 --> 16:53.120
be at a higher class

16:53.759 --> 17:00.240
for that this is just a training on

16:56.959 --> 17:03.279
and that's how we can really

17:00.240 --> 17:04.079
put our preparation into practice into

17:03.279 --> 17:07.280
all details

17:04.079 --> 17:10.079
to see how we work out our ego

17:07.280 --> 17:10.799
and superego today in the morning i have

17:10.079 --> 17:14.160
told you that

17:10.799 --> 17:17.199
your intellect must

17:14.160 --> 17:18.000
imbibe this within itself all right and

17:17.199 --> 17:22.319
now i'm telling

17:18.000 --> 17:22.319
you that your action

17:22.720 --> 17:27.439
action that you do must

17:27.760 --> 17:36.000
be every time branded by you as

17:32.880 --> 17:36.000
just your training

17:36.960 --> 17:42.480
any action you do sometimes you have to

17:39.919 --> 17:44.559
drive for miles together

17:42.480 --> 17:46.080
you're trying your patience you see them

17:44.559 --> 17:46.480
doing everything say they have to do go

17:46.080 --> 17:49.440
for

17:46.480 --> 17:51.360
say helicopter or say if they have to

17:49.440 --> 17:55.120
drop from the

17:51.360 --> 17:55.120
what you call them drop down

17:55.600 --> 18:00.480
parachutes or helicopter you take away

17:59.280 --> 18:02.960
or whatever it is

18:00.480 --> 18:03.760
you go on doing it again and again isn't

18:02.960 --> 18:05.760
it

18:03.760 --> 18:07.440
you practice it again you drop many

18:05.760 --> 18:09.520
times you break your legs you break your

18:07.440 --> 18:12.400
hands you do this and do that

18:09.520 --> 18:14.000
then you become a master you understand

18:12.400 --> 18:16.320
my point

18:14.000 --> 18:18.080
driving same way till you become a

18:16.320 --> 18:20.000
master you go on in the same way

18:18.080 --> 18:22.640
you are doing this work just to master

18:20.000 --> 18:25.520
your patience

18:22.640 --> 18:25.520
and that your love

18:26.160 --> 18:31.679
is your love how much you love really

18:29.600 --> 18:34.480
if you really love someone you are never

18:31.679 --> 18:34.480
tired of working

18:37.039 --> 18:41.440
you are never upset with working but if

18:40.160 --> 18:43.679
you don't love

18:41.440 --> 18:44.799
you start counting how much money how

18:43.679 --> 18:48.480
much work

18:44.799 --> 18:50.799
how many hours how much to be paid

18:48.480 --> 18:53.919
all artificiality comes because there is

18:50.799 --> 18:53.919
no love involved in you

18:54.320 --> 18:58.000
whatever you don't want to do you don't

18:55.760 --> 18:58.000
do it

18:58.240 --> 19:03.600
to begin with to begin with you just

19:01.360 --> 19:07.280
don't do what you don't like

19:03.600 --> 19:08.240
to begin with but once you have mastered

19:07.280 --> 19:10.480
that

19:08.240 --> 19:13.600
then you have to master it that you do

19:10.480 --> 19:13.600
something that you don't like

19:13.760 --> 19:18.080
like meeting some buddhist for example

19:16.480 --> 19:21.840
you don't want to meet

19:18.080 --> 19:24.400
you want to run but you go little nearer

19:21.840 --> 19:25.520
you see then develop a immunity for

19:24.400 --> 19:28.720
these buddhis

19:25.520 --> 19:28.720
after some time will not cast

19:29.679 --> 19:33.760
you have to develop the immunity isn't

19:31.280 --> 19:38.000
it otherwise one person comes and

19:33.760 --> 19:40.000
everybody's head goes out

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
it's not the fellow improving you all go

19:40.000 --> 19:44.799
out

19:42.000 --> 19:45.919
so all these things are all these events

19:44.799 --> 19:49.280
are for your

19:45.919 --> 19:49.280
training your immunity

19:49.440 --> 19:55.679
your immunity is to be trained

19:53.840 --> 19:59.440
and when it is so when we are training

19:55.679 --> 19:59.440
ourselves we should take it as a job

20:01.120 --> 20:06.960
but the attitude should be extremely

20:04.840 --> 20:10.400
positive

20:06.960 --> 20:13.760
extremely positive and

20:10.400 --> 20:18.000
all that is should be expressed in your

20:13.760 --> 20:21.200
notebook whether you got dejected

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
or you got upset and disgusted you want

20:21.200 --> 20:27.919
to run away from it all sorts of things

20:24.000 --> 20:27.919
it's just a training to your mind

20:30.000 --> 20:34.799
whatever is the situation wherever one

20:33.600 --> 20:38.000
has to live

20:34.799 --> 20:41.679
whatever one has to do

20:38.000 --> 20:45.200
you should do whatever may be the

20:41.679 --> 20:45.200
circumstances conditions

20:45.520 --> 20:48.880
you'll be amazed you will not even know

20:47.200 --> 20:50.320
what you have eaten in the morning what

20:48.880 --> 20:52.000
you have it means

20:50.320 --> 20:53.600
whether you are eaten or not you will

20:52.000 --> 20:56.799
not

20:53.600 --> 20:56.799
you will not fuss about it

20:56.880 --> 21:02.559
do not worry about it you will not think

20:58.799 --> 21:06.159
about it

21:02.559 --> 21:06.159
but this being

21:06.400 --> 21:16.080
the a is to reach the satavura

21:10.480 --> 21:16.880
every other thing becomes 0. the

21:16.080 --> 21:19.360
greatest

21:16.880 --> 21:22.720
hurdle comes to sahaja yogis i've seen

21:19.360 --> 21:22.720
when they start organizing

21:22.960 --> 21:27.360
they start organizing something now

21:25.600 --> 21:29.919
somebody wants something

21:27.360 --> 21:31.200
so they'll run up to get the thing for

21:29.919 --> 21:33.280
that person

21:31.200 --> 21:34.960
now just have said that you must look

21:33.280 --> 21:36.880
after the needs of others

21:34.960 --> 21:38.960
but if i'm sitting here and there's a

21:36.880 --> 21:41.600
lecture on then you better be

21:38.960 --> 21:42.640
just listening to me you see this also

21:41.600 --> 21:45.120
is

21:42.640 --> 21:46.480
that how to have your prayers at this

21:45.120 --> 21:49.600
time one

21:46.480 --> 21:52.240
something working on you

21:49.600 --> 21:54.159
this is the first thing you have to do

21:52.240 --> 21:56.640
not that at this time you go

21:54.159 --> 21:56.640
and cook

21:57.280 --> 22:02.640
you have known the story of two sisters

21:59.600 --> 22:06.640
attending on christ

22:02.640 --> 22:09.760
all right so at this time

22:06.640 --> 22:13.280
what is your first job is to try

22:09.760 --> 22:15.200
to be more exposed to me

22:13.280 --> 22:16.400
so that automatically you go into your

22:15.200 --> 22:21.760
subtotal

22:16.400 --> 22:24.080
this is the best but if i am not there

22:21.760 --> 22:26.480
and when you are alone or when we are

22:24.080 --> 22:30.159
with other sahaja yogis

22:26.480 --> 22:31.200
you must now compete in rising higher

22:30.159 --> 22:33.280
and higher

22:31.200 --> 22:35.679
from tamaguna to rajaguna and from

22:33.280 --> 22:37.760
rajaguna to sato

22:35.679 --> 22:39.039
but actually by realization you have

22:37.760 --> 22:43.520
gone beyond

22:39.039 --> 22:46.880
these three ones you have gone beyond it

22:43.520 --> 22:46.880
actually that is what has happened

22:47.280 --> 22:52.559
but like clouds they cover you again and

22:50.320 --> 22:52.559
again

22:53.120 --> 22:57.280
and when the sky is covered with those

22:55.679 --> 22:59.520
clouds

22:57.280 --> 23:03.120
you cannot see the sun you cannot see

22:59.520 --> 23:03.120
the moon you cannot see the stars

23:03.200 --> 23:06.720
so we have to know how these clouds are

23:05.120 --> 23:08.960
coming into us

23:06.720 --> 23:10.400
and that's how we go into our complete

23:08.960 --> 23:12.960
analysis

23:10.400 --> 23:14.240
how these clouds are coming to us we

23:12.960 --> 23:17.760
find out about our

23:14.240 --> 23:20.400
different chakras what are the chakras

23:17.760 --> 23:20.400
we are catching

23:21.039 --> 23:25.280
here comes the another constant

23:23.840 --> 23:28.480
attention

23:25.280 --> 23:30.080
towards our channel are our vibrations

23:28.480 --> 23:33.520
all right or not

23:30.080 --> 23:36.320
why are we getting our vibrations

23:33.520 --> 23:37.919
if not what chakra am i catching what

23:36.320 --> 23:40.559
must be the catch

23:37.919 --> 23:42.400
i must raise my kundalini see for myself

23:40.559 --> 23:45.039
where is the catch

23:42.400 --> 23:47.120
do i do my meditation or not if i do it

23:45.039 --> 23:50.480
am i doing it just dozingly or

23:47.120 --> 23:53.039
am i really in it am i

23:50.480 --> 23:53.919
really feeling it or not am i alert or

23:53.039 --> 23:57.360
not

23:53.919 --> 24:00.240
all this is to be assiduously

23:57.360 --> 24:02.080
sincerely absolutely truthfully should

24:00.240 --> 24:05.279
be worked out

24:02.080 --> 24:07.840
because it is a process between

24:05.279 --> 24:07.840
yourselves

24:09.520 --> 24:13.840
see it's a very funny it is so funny

24:12.320 --> 24:20.960
relationship

24:13.840 --> 24:20.960
that it is satisfied with happening

24:21.200 --> 24:26.480
you have to be satisfied with yourself

24:24.559 --> 24:28.400
there's nobody mataji is not concerned

24:26.480 --> 24:33.840
nobody is concerned it is you

24:28.400 --> 24:33.840
are concerned with yourself

24:34.159 --> 24:36.240
you
