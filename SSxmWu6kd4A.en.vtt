00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:26.208
Sankranti Puja, Rahuri, India

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:37.417
January 14th, 1987

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:37.291
Today is the day where we celebrate the change

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:42.834
of the axis of the Sun and that He moves

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:48.041
towards the tropic of cancer.

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:59.250
Tropic of cancer is the one

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.959
which represents the motherhood,

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:17.625
the motherhood of the Earth.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:31.000
This tropic of Cancer has passed through

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
quite a big area of land

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:39.709
while the tropic of Capricorn has not.

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:45.667
And the area through which it has passed

00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:49.917
it has created

00:02:52.208 --> 00:03:01.375
different beautiful manifestation

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.959
of the motherhood qualities on this Earth.

00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:13.709
We celebrate this change

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.667
because the Sun has now moved into the new

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:29.208
dimension so that all over the world

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:37.834
there will be the warmth of the Sun.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.250
Warmth of the Sun

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.917
represents the warmth of God's love.

00:03:53.125 --> 00:03:56.333
This is the reason why we celebrate

00:03:57.333 --> 00:04:02.125
this festival

00:04:03.583 --> 00:04:06.000
by giving you some sort of a sweet

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:09.417
made out of sesame seeds.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.166
Sesame seeds are given because they are also heat giving

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:24.417
and now as we are coming from the cold,

00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:31.000
we come to the hot season, in a way hotter season,

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:36.959
so to prepare you with that warmth of the Sun.

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:43.208
These special things are made out of the seed

00:04:43.792 --> 00:04:49.375
of sesame to represent the oncoming warmth

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.709
and the warm of the Sun.

00:04:57.208 --> 00:05:00.125
Though in India the heat is too much,

00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:07.583
still people are waiting for this time to come in

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.999
and they celebrate it with such a warm heart.

00:05:12.458 --> 00:05:17.000
At this time it is said that

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:26.291
they give you this sesame seed and the sugar to eat,

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:30.959
but now you must speak in a sweet manner,

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:36.125
"gudd gudd bola", means you must speak in the sweet manner.

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:41.750
Speaking in the sweet manner is very important.

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:47.083
Some people think it is smart to speak in a rude manner

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:52.750
or is very intelligent to shout on people,

00:05:55.667 --> 00:06:00.000
but no one likes this kind of a personality.

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:06.667
You may be intelligent, you may be very sharp or smart,

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:11.999
maybe on a television people may like to see you,

00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:17.125
but not as companions, as friends.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.667
To speak in a very sweet manner

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:31.500
is a sign of good breeding, good culture and fear of God.

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:35.041
Those who fear God will never speak

00:06:35.583 --> 00:06:38.834
rudely to another person, because in another person

00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:42.291
also the same spirit is shining

00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:47.750
and why should we be sharp or angry with another person

00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:53.458
who is created by God Almighty as we are created.

00:06:54.375 --> 00:06:59.583
So this loving, beautiful relationship

00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:01.333
that we have with each other,

00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:03.500
after Sahaja Yoga especially,

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:08.667
let us express in talking to each other sweetly.

00:07:09.125 --> 00:07:13.041
There are so many ways by which we could be sweet.

00:07:16.542 --> 00:07:19.834
There are little, little things if you do,

00:07:21.166 --> 00:07:23.375
you can create lot of sweetness,

00:07:23.917 --> 00:07:29.125
but you need not a sharp tongue, but a sharp memory.

00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:32.375
I try these things many a times.

00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:38.500
Once one of the Sahaja Yogi,

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.000
who is a very good Sahaja Yogi and an active Sahaja Yogi,

00:07:42.417 --> 00:07:45.250
was going in the car with Me

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:54.208
and his knife was stolen by the driver or somebody

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:57.667
and he got very angry with the driver.

00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:00.999
I said, "Forget it, you see he is an poor man,

00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:05.291
so he has taken it away, doesn't matter, just forget it."

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:08.000
He says, "No, it was because it's a present to me

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:10.542
from somebody who was in Switzerland and

00:08:10.875 --> 00:08:13.375
it's a Swiss knife which I was keeping with me.

00:08:13.792 --> 00:08:18.250
So I feel sorry that I have lost it."

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:20.834
When I went to Switzerland I bought that kind of a

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:23.083
same knife for him.

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:26.792
When I came, when I gave him,

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:28.709
he didn't have words to say anything.

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:32.083
He said, "Mother, how did You remember?

00:08:32.542 --> 00:08:34.000
After such a long time how did you manage

00:08:34.792 --> 00:08:36.041
to get this knife?"

00:08:36.792 --> 00:08:37.959
I said, "I have a very good memory."

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:41.333
That's the trouble with Me.

00:08:41.917 --> 00:08:45.083
The memory is so good that sometimes,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.375
I just don't know,

00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:51.834
I may embarrass some people with My memory.

00:08:52.166 --> 00:08:55.999
It is that good, I don't forget anything whatsoever.

00:08:56.417 --> 00:08:58.208
I, of course, forget all the bad things,

00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:02.041
because no use remembering bad things,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.625
no use thinking of them.

00:09:05.083 --> 00:09:09.250
Because of forgiveness you can always forget the bad things.

00:09:09.792 --> 00:09:11.709
And if you remember the good things

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:15.417
your joy becomes multiplied.

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:17.959
If you try to remember something bad

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:19.917
then your joy goes down.

00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:22.041
Every time you see a person try to remember

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:25.542
what good that person has done to you.

00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:28.000
What good that person has.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:31.083
If you have memory for good things

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:35.834
you will have a very nice time.

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:39.999
Now today is the day when you are all leaving India.

00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:42.667
Some of you will be leaving day after tomorrow.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:44.083
Whatever it is,

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.959
I have to tell you one thing, that

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:53.375
whatever was possible has been done here, for you people

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:56.375
to give you joy and happiness.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.125
Now when you are going back,

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.041
try to remember all that was said to you.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.000
All that was nice.

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:05.917
How people praised you.

00:10:06.333 --> 00:10:09.500
How they loved you. How they were kind to you.

00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:11.959
How you met some nice people.

00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:14.417
What nice experiences you had

00:10:14.875 --> 00:10:18.500
but don't brood over things which are worthless.

00:10:18.834 --> 00:10:22.125
All right, somebody must have said something harsh to you

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.500
or you might have said something harsh to someone,

00:10:24.917 --> 00:10:26.500
just forget it.

00:10:26.999 --> 00:10:29.417
Try to understand that you are spoiling

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:32.291
your chances of enjoying life.

00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:40.542
Nobody is hurt by that so try to be extremely happy

00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:42.917
that you have met so many people,

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:44.875
that you have had weddings,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.917
that you have seen so many weddings.

00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:51.125
We have had a nice time and every bit of it was

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.667
full of joyous vibrations.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.709
Of course, today some of you would be a little unhappy

00:10:58.125 --> 00:11:01.750
I can understand that because your spouses are leaving,

00:11:02.208 --> 00:11:04.417
somebody's husbands are going away or

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.375
somebody's wives are going away.

00:11:06.792 --> 00:11:07.875
So I can see some of them

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.625
are looking rather miserable about it.

00:11:17.417 --> 00:11:19.875
But that's a good thing because it is out of love

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:23.667
and out of attraction for each other,

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.458
for enjoying the company of each other.

00:11:26.792 --> 00:11:29.083
That's suggestive of something very good to Me

00:11:29.417 --> 00:11:31.959
but still I would say that, after all,

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:34.375
you are going to meet each other

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.999
and remember all the good things that

00:11:36.417 --> 00:11:38.083
you have said to each other,

00:11:38.458 --> 00:11:41.583
you have enjoyed with each other and try to keep happy.

00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:44.834
Because these days will pass very fast.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:47.291
In Sahaja Yoga you just forget time, everything,

00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:51.083
the time passes so fast and all these things will pass over

00:11:51.417 --> 00:11:55.417
and you will be again united with your husbands or wives,

00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:57.125
whatever may be the case.

00:11:57.709 --> 00:12:00.917
So there is nothing to feel very sad about all these things,

00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:03.250
and to keep smiling and laughing,

00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:04.917
so when they are departing also,

00:12:05.417 --> 00:12:08.917
they should not feel, see your last face full of tears but,

00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:15.999
but remember the face of assurance and courage,

00:12:16.375 --> 00:12:18.750
that the hope is there,

00:12:19.083 --> 00:12:20.458
we are going to meet very soon and

00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:23.333
there is nothing to feel very sad about it.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.333
Today is the day to make joy and to enjoy everything

00:12:27.834 --> 00:12:33.333
and to feel the blessings of God all around us.

00:12:33.792 --> 00:12:37.750
The Sun has come back in His own glory

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:43.834
and we have to wish Him all success in the coming year,

00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:46.041
because in this part of Maharashtra

00:12:46.417 --> 00:12:48.333
as you know there has been no rain.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.709
There has been problems with them and

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.333
we have to wish Him success

00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:58.041
so that He can bring forth the rain

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.959
and all that is needed out of this solar energy

00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:07.709
that we have in this country.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.917
And you have to be beaming like the Sun

00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:14.959
when you go back to your countries.

00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:18.917
That your countries are not so hot as ours are neither

00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:22.625
you have that much of warmth there and you can find

00:13:22.999 --> 00:13:26.458
that why people are so warm and so much loving because

00:13:26.875 --> 00:13:28.500
we have the Sun with us.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.417
Now you carry the Sun with you and you give them love

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.709
and affection and warmth and let them feel that the Sun

00:13:38.083 --> 00:13:40.625
has been brought from India by you.

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:43.083
Whenever I have traveled anywhere, in any country,

00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:46.041
the Sun used to be there very bright, so they said that,

00:13:46.625 --> 00:13:49.250
there is a saying that, when the Indians travel

00:13:49.999 --> 00:13:51.500
they carry the Sun with them.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.875
Of course you can't carry the Sun in your pockets

00:13:54.542 --> 00:13:56.709
but we must be carrying it in our hearts, the Sun.

00:13:57.208 --> 00:13:59.125
That must be the reason that's why

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.709
the Sun was shining so well

00:14:01.333 --> 00:14:02.834
and everybody came out with their good dresses

00:14:03.208 --> 00:14:04.999
and everything was ...were, and were enjoying.

00:14:05.583 --> 00:14:07.333
So this is what it is,

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:09.625
that you have to carry the Sun with you

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:13.625
speaking sweetly today and forever to each other

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.750
to be friendly, to be helpful, to be kind

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.792
because you are yogis,

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:20.375
you are not ordinary people.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.834
You are yogis, you represent that category of people

00:14:24.083 --> 00:14:25.709
who are known for their righteousness,

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:28.834
for their goodness and for their compassion and love.

00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:31.917
So I wish you all best of luck.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.542
Enjoy your journeys,

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:36.750
enjoy everything and pass this joy

00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:38.417
that you have achieved here,

00:14:38.959 --> 00:14:40.542
to other people, to other Sahaja Yogis

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.999
and to other people who are not even Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:46.750
May God bless you with that.

00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:49.000
Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.

00:14:49.375 --> 00:14:52.000
Today is an auspicious day and on this day we give sesame

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:55.875
seeds to others and ask them to talk sweetly.

00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:59.125
We tell others but it would be better if we tell it

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:02.959
to ourselves also because it is easier to tell others

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.667
to talk sweetly but: “I’ll talk harshly.”

00:15:06.458 --> 00:15:08.083
With this habit of ours have created

00:15:08.834 --> 00:15:12.166
wrong ideas about ourselves. We do not have any idea

00:15:13.333 --> 00:15:17.083
of the blessings that God has bestowed upon us.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.625
God has given such a lot of blessings to us in this country.

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:24.208
But in this country people do not care much for cleanliness.

00:15:25.291 --> 00:15:27.625
In this country there are different types of germs

00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:30.792
and parasites.

00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.000
I feel that we have all the parasites of the whole world

00:15:33.542 --> 00:15:35.834
in this country. We even have parasites which

00:15:36.291 --> 00:15:38.709
cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:42.458
If these parasites go to the other countries they will die.

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:45.000
Because of the cold they cannot survive.

00:15:45.458 --> 00:15:48.166
Due to the Sun, there are so many parasites in this country.

00:15:49.417 --> 00:15:51.792
Once a scientist asked Me, “How is it possible to remain

00:15:52.709 --> 00:15:56.041
alive with so many parasites present in your country?”

00:15:56.583 --> 00:15:58.792
I replied that “In this country, the people are not only

00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:01.375
alive but live with joy and happiness,

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.000
with a lot of bliss and happiness.”

00:16:04.417 --> 00:16:06.083
The reason for this is the Sun.

00:16:06.583 --> 00:16:08.083
The Sun has taught us to keep our homes open

00:16:08.792 --> 00:16:10.333
and also open our hearts.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.458
In England, if you have to go out somewhere

00:16:16.166 --> 00:16:19.125
then you have to spend at least fifteen minutes just to put

00:16:19.625 --> 00:16:21.125
on the right clothes.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.542
It’s as if you are wearing a shield before going out,

00:16:23.834 --> 00:16:27.959
otherwise you might catch a cold and affect your head.

00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.625
This is the situation there.

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:34.083
Today you are sitting here in the open but we cannot sit

00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:36.583
like this in England or in any other Western country.

00:16:38.041 --> 00:16:41.250
Because of the weather these countries have become very cold.

00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:47.125
Even in our country there are areas (city), for example

00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:52.333
if you go to cities like Bhowali or the other side of

00:16:53.417 --> 00:16:57.208
Nainital and Dehradun and very close to the Himalayas, then

00:16:58.125 --> 00:17:02.834
you can find the cold weather as in the other countries.

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:08.667
There, it is also cold like in England and America.

00:17:09.458 --> 00:17:12.000
But in these cold countries not even birds or insects

00:17:12.458 --> 00:17:13.542
can survive.

00:17:14.709 --> 00:17:18.291
There are a lot of forests with beautiful flowers in them.

00:17:20.417 --> 00:17:22.250
They call it a valley of flowers.

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.625
There are so many beautiful flowers – as if it is a paradise

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.333
on earth – but this feeling is only for a moment.

00:17:28.417 --> 00:17:30.667
It is so cold there that we cannot even open our eyes

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.834
to see that beautiful place.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.208
We have to wear spectacles otherwise our eyes are hurt,

00:17:36.792 --> 00:17:38.125
because of the cold.

00:17:38.959 --> 00:17:40.709
But in spite of the cold,

00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:43.583
those countries have progressed so much.

00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:48.500
They have fought against the nature and the cold climate

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.417
and strengthened their countries.

00:17:54.291 --> 00:17:57.417
In spite of having a lot of sun, we have not been able

00:17:58.125 --> 00:18:00.333
to exploit its advantages.

00:18:00.875 --> 00:18:02.667
We can also produce solar energy.

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:05.458
If we use the solar energy we will never have a dearth

00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:07.375
of (electrical) energy.

00:18:07.709 --> 00:18:09.667
Even the cars can run on solar energy.

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:11.709
But the attention of the politicians here in India

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.083
is elsewhere and due to this fact, we cannot exploit

00:18:14.542 --> 00:18:17.500
the advantages from the sun but suffer from it.

00:18:17.917 --> 00:18:21.917
If we do not go to the extremes then we can do a lot of work.

00:18:22.417 --> 00:18:24.000
The main thing which we can learn from the Sun

00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:27.834
is Its capacity of giving. It always gives.

00:18:28.917 --> 00:18:32.041
It does not take anything but always gives.

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.083
Due to this tremendous giving power of the Sun

00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:39.667
we can have rain, we can have crops and living beings.

00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:42.166
If we did not have the sun then we would not have anything.

00:18:42.625 --> 00:18:44.041
It is due to the giving power of love of the Sun only, that

00:18:44.542 --> 00:18:46.917
we have been able to reach this state.

00:18:47.208 --> 00:18:49.250
Thus what we have to learn from the Sun is that we should

00:18:49.542 --> 00:18:51.417
also develop the power of giving.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.542
If we look around us we will find people who will always

00:18:53.875 --> 00:18:56.458
think, “How I can save money and keep it for myself?”

00:18:56.834 --> 00:18:59.291
Even if I give money for some programs, some people still

00:18:59.542 --> 00:19:01.667
think how they can save money from that also.

00:19:02.125 --> 00:19:04.542
Even if I have given them some money to spend they always

00:19:04.834 --> 00:19:08.000
have a tendency to save money from everything. Why?

00:19:08.417 --> 00:19:10.208
Because there is a tendency to hold on to something.

00:19:10.458 --> 00:19:12.542
If someone goes to the market and they find that prices

00:19:12.834 --> 00:19:14.458
have risen, and if we ask, “Why?” they reply that

00:19:14.792 --> 00:19:16.750
“Because the others have increased the prices,

00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:18.250
that’s why I also increase the price.”

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:20.917
If the (cost) prices of the commodities are not rising then

00:19:21.583 --> 00:19:23.917
why do they raise the (selling) price?

00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:28.000
They have always a tendency to suck the energy of others.

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.792
Even if I want to make a small ceremony for a festive

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.083
occasion, then others tell Me,

00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:44.834
“Shri Mataji you will not be able to succeed.”

00:19:45.834 --> 00:19:48.417
When I ask, “Why?” the reply is that people are corrupt and

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:50.875
they will eat (grab) money.

00:19:51.333 --> 00:19:54.166
As I eat the food they eat money, so maybe we will not get

00:19:54.625 --> 00:19:57.000
along together. It is such an absurd thing.

00:19:57.333 --> 00:19:59.083
Those who are responsible for the country’s welfare,

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.625
those who are the administrators and those on whom the power

00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:04.875
has been bestowed by God, even they do not understand that

00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:08.417
we have to give.

00:20:08.917 --> 00:20:13.000
This quality of giving one has to learn from the Sun:

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.041
that we have come (on this earth) to give and not to take.

00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:19.750
This complete change from within has to be reached with

00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:21.750
an understanding that we have to give and not to take.

00:20:22.208 --> 00:20:24.291
We have to have the passion of giving.

00:20:24.792 --> 00:20:27.625
It’s as if when a mother knows that “Today my son is coming”

00:20:27.875 --> 00:20:29.583
then with passion she thinks, “What can I do for him,

00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:32.667
what food can I cook for him?”

00:20:32.917 --> 00:20:35.208
This is the passion which a mother has.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.291
Even if she doesn’t have the ingredients, she might borrow

00:20:38.667 --> 00:20:41.417
them from the neighbors and prepare some sweets for you.

00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:44.166
She always feel that she has not done enough.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.542
Unless and until we have this kind of collective passion

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:50.709
from inside and have this kind of feeling about others,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.166
no country can progress, neither our own nor other countries.

00:20:54.667 --> 00:20:57.375
But we always have the urge to take things from others,

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.959
to plunder from others, to borrow from others or

00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:02.125
to deceive others. Because of this urge our children

00:21:02.542 --> 00:21:04.959
will suffer, we will suffer and we will not be able

00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:08.125
to achieve anything in this country.

00:21:08.583 --> 00:21:12.291
In My in-law’s village (inaudible)…to build a lake.

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.166
The government gave them money in thousands for the purpose.

00:21:15.667 --> 00:21:17.417
But the lake was never built.

00:21:17.709 --> 00:21:20.000
They said that they had dug a hole to make a lake but then

00:21:20.291 --> 00:21:22.875
they covered it again since they did not find any water.

00:21:23.166 --> 00:21:25.750
But in fact the hole was never dug.

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:28.458
So where did the money go?

00:21:28.917 --> 00:21:30.542
They sent it to Switzerland (bank).

00:21:30.542 --> 00:21:32.291
So the banks will again borrow from Switzerland and send

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.041
the money again to Switzerland.

00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:36.041
If the Sun acts in this way then we cannot survive

00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:37.834
even for one day.

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:41.375
If he alone eats (consumes) everything, what can we eat?

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.625
Today we are celebrating the SANKRANTI.

00:21:45.333 --> 00:21:50.083
Sankranti means a sort of Kranti (revolution) by which

00:21:50.417 --> 00:21:52.000
we acquire the habit of giving.

00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:56.333
Everybody says that we should have the habit of giving

00:21:56.875 --> 00:21:59.625
but most of the people believe in donating something

00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:02.333
to the priest.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.333
Also, many people preach the art of giving

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:08.667
just to fill their own pockets.

00:22:09.208 --> 00:22:10.875
This doesn’t have any meaning.

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:15.875
There is always a question of whom to give and why to give.

00:22:16.417 --> 00:22:18.792
In fact, in all liberty and freedom, we should see

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:21.750
for ourselves what we are giving for our country,

00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:25.500
for our brothers and sisters and our neighbors.

00:22:26.542 --> 00:22:29.583
We should not be selfish, but give with all our heart

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.041
so that we get all the joy of giving.

00:22:33.999 --> 00:22:37.208
When we give with all our heart, the joy that we get

00:22:38.166 --> 00:22:41.583
cannot be compared with any other joy.

00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:44.750
If we want to feel this kind of joy only, then we should

00:22:45.166 --> 00:22:50.083
celebrate the SANKRANTI today.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:56.458
Our nature should become like the Sun.

00:22:57.542 --> 00:23:00.750
Whatever he is doing, he doesn’t have the feeling that

00:23:01.375 --> 00:23:04.999
he is doing something. He is doing everything in AKARMA

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.999
(without the feeling of doing anything) and constantly

00:23:08.458 --> 00:23:11.583
burning himself and giving you joy, light,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.709
the essence of living, and he nourishes you.

00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:19.875
We see the Sun every day and many people do Namaskar also,

00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:22.041
but we only do Namaskar without imbibing

00:23:22.375 --> 00:23:23.834
his qualities of giving.

00:23:24.417 --> 00:23:26.417
I told you a very small thing:

00:23:26.875 --> 00:23:29.542
that every Sahaja yogi

00:23:29.834 --> 00:23:33.125
should plant a banyan tree in his garden.

00:23:33.583 --> 00:23:35.000
Why do we have to take money from the government

00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:36.875
for this purpose?

00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:38.542
Just to plant a tree and put a fence around that

00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:40.583
tree doesn’t need much money.

00:23:40.999 --> 00:23:42.291
Even to smoke bidi (tobacco) costs more.

00:23:42.709 --> 00:23:44.667
Try to do this small thing so that others should see that

00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:46.542
you are at least doing something.

00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:49.000
In spite of this we always think how we can get money

00:23:49.417 --> 00:23:51.291
from others, how we can plunder others and how we can

00:23:51.792 --> 00:23:53.917
save money at others cost.

00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:56.500
Because of these tendencies within us,

00:23:56.959 --> 00:23:59.375
our country can never progress.

00:23:59.959 --> 00:24:02.125
We did not have these tendencies before in people,

00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:04.750
in the earlier days.

00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:08.709
I can tell you that when I was young I saw people who

00:24:08.959 --> 00:24:12.291
believed only in giving and never in taking.

00:24:12.959 --> 00:24:15.917
I saw them giving only, they did not like taking.

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.041
Even the parents did not like it if the children took

00:24:20.667 --> 00:24:23.125
something from others and would tell them to return it.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.208
I still remember in My father’s house they had made

00:24:25.208 --> 00:24:27.166
some chairs and also an umbrella, out of silver.

00:24:27.625 --> 00:24:30.667
Everybody asked, “Why did you make these out of silver?”

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.166
So the reply was, “When we have marriage ceremonies,

00:24:33.166 --> 00:24:35.458
instead of borrowing or hiring them,

00:24:35.709 --> 00:24:37.250
it would be better that we have them with us once

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.208
and for all, because if we had to hire then sometimes

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.250
we did not get them in time because the earlier person

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.875
who had borrowed had not returned them.

00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:44.542
And sometimes these umbrellas were lost because someone

00:24:44.542 --> 00:24:46.458
had never returned them and so they got lost.”

00:24:46.709 --> 00:24:47.917
So what I wanted to say is that if we have money,

00:24:48.375 --> 00:24:49.750
we should invest it into something collective.

00:24:49.999 --> 00:24:51.291
If you want to construct a badminton court,

00:24:51.291 --> 00:24:53.709
then in that court everybody should be able to come

00:24:53.709 --> 00:24:55.166
and play and we should not say that only my children

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.083
should play in that court. If somebody buys a car,

00:24:57.375 --> 00:24:58.625
we should be able to take all the children to school.

00:24:59.041 --> 00:25:01.333
Thus we should buy a big car so that all the children

00:25:01.834 --> 00:25:03.291
can be taken to school.

00:25:03.875 --> 00:25:05.458
This habit of being collective and being useful

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.750
to everybody, one should learn from the Sun.

00:25:08.041 --> 00:25:09.999
And today is a special day when we can learn this thing

00:25:10.291 --> 00:25:13.709
from the Sun. And we should take a vow that

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:17.333
“I’ll do something which is collective.”

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.291
I do not understand how people can eat without caring

00:25:20.709 --> 00:25:22.250
for the common public.

00:25:23.125 --> 00:25:24.999
You do not even worry about your neighbors and do not

00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:26.750
do anything for the common people.

00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:30.458
I told you a very small thing is to plant a tree.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.542
We have got so many yogis in Maharashtra,

00:25:33.917 --> 00:25:36.291
even if each one plants one tree and looks after it,

00:25:36.709 --> 00:25:39.125
this will be certainly helpful to everybody.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.250
Thus I request all of you to do something collective and

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.750
it will be useful to everybody.

00:25:46.417 --> 00:25:49.041
But one should never think how much will I earn from it

00:25:49.375 --> 00:25:50.917
and make money out of it.

00:25:51.375 --> 00:25:53.291
It should not happen like the way we give money

00:25:53.709 --> 00:25:55.000
to the priest.

00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.583
One should open his heart and lovingly do something

00:25:57.875 --> 00:25:59.583
for the collective and feel the joy out of it.

00:26:00.417 --> 00:26:02.375
One should make it a habit.

00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:04.542
I do not want to say that others should have

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.834
everything for free.

00:26:07.208 --> 00:26:08.959
I never said that you do something for free for

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.291
the people who have come from abroad.

00:26:11.792 --> 00:26:14.250
If you look at them you will see that they have brought

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:18.625
so many things for you from abroad to give you as presents.

00:26:19.208 --> 00:26:21.375
Of course I have contributed a lot.

00:26:21.792 --> 00:26:23.709
But they have also brought a lot of things of their own.

00:26:24.083 --> 00:26:25.875
When I saw the presents here, I thought that they were

00:26:25.875 --> 00:26:27.834
the presents which I had bought in Rome for you

00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:29.959
but then they told Me that these were the presents

00:26:30.375 --> 00:26:32.417
which they bought themselves and they had not

00:26:32.417 --> 00:26:34.709
brought My presents.

00:26:35.083 --> 00:26:37.166
They felt such a lot of joy to bring so many things

00:26:37.458 --> 00:26:38.625
for you.

00:26:38.999 --> 00:26:41.667
They do not even know in Italy to whom these presents were

00:26:41.917 --> 00:26:44.041
to be given but they do not bother.

00:26:44.291 --> 00:26:46.083
They leave it to Me to give them to the Sahaja yogis

00:26:46.458 --> 00:26:48.125
here in India.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.750
But in India we have a tendency to think only about

00:26:51.083 --> 00:26:53.458
our children and about our mother.

00:26:53.834 --> 00:26:55.959
Then the mother comes walking, limping on one leg.

00:26:56.291 --> 00:26:58.750
Then you start saying that “My mother did not get

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.834
a high quality sari.”

00:27:01.208 --> 00:27:04.583
Since I do not have one I give her a simple sari.

00:27:04.959 --> 00:27:07.500
This is the tendency here.

00:27:07.834 --> 00:27:10.125
But with the people from abroad it is just the opposite.

00:27:10.417 --> 00:27:12.542
When they came here they came with so many presents

00:27:12.542 --> 00:27:15.709
it seems they brought two tons of presents from abroad.

00:27:16.041 --> 00:27:18.166
Even My hands starting paining while giving these

00:27:18.542 --> 00:27:20.417
two tons of presents.

00:27:20.792 --> 00:27:23.667
What I want to say is that they do not expect anything

00:27:24.083 --> 00:27:25.959
from you. But your behavior should be such as to show

00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:28.583
an example for them. And you should show them that

00:27:28.583 --> 00:27:31.000
you are in no way inferior to them,

00:27:31.417 --> 00:27:33.458
“We are here really to serve you, to welcome you,

00:27:33.792 --> 00:27:35.083
whatever is possible from our side

00:27:35.083 --> 00:27:37.000
we do not hesitate to do.”

00:27:37.333 --> 00:27:39.041
It doesn’t cost any money nor any hard work.

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.917
The only thing is that we should change our outlook.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.834
If even after coming in Sahaja Yoga we are not able

00:27:44.834 --> 00:27:46.709
to change our nature in this manner then I do not feel

00:27:46.709 --> 00:27:49.333
that we can change the entire humanity with Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:49.583 --> 00:27:51.583
The biggest quality in us is to give to others.

00:27:52.083 --> 00:27:54.083
And this quality we should imbibe within us.

00:27:54.083 --> 00:27:56.041
In Sahaja yoga your Kundalini is awakened and you

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.250
realize your spirit but the essence of spirit is like that

00:27:58.792 --> 00:28:00.625
of the Sun and this essence is of giving.

00:28:01.041 --> 00:28:03.625
If you have seen one photograph of Mine, there is the Sun

00:28:03.875 --> 00:28:05.583
shining on My heart; in fact there is a Sun in My heart

00:28:05.875 --> 00:28:08.208
and because of this I never feel that I should take something

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.000
from them or to plunder anybody.

00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:14.125
I do not understand from which part of your head this idea

00:28:14.667 --> 00:28:16.208
of plundering them comes from.

00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:19.166
This is a very strange behavior.

00:28:19.583 --> 00:28:21.375
Sahaja yogis should not think in this way but on the contrary

00:28:21.625 --> 00:28:23.667
every day we must think what we can give or do for others.

00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:25.959
In Rahuri itself I have started an organization

00:28:26.208 --> 00:28:27.792
whose name is “SAHAJ STREE SUDHAR” or “SAMAJSUDHAR”

00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:29.709
(association for the welfare of women).

00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:31.999
Through Life Eternal Trust we cannot use the money for

00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:33.792
the welfare of the women thus we had to create

00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:35.375
this organization.

00:28:35.667 --> 00:28:37.542
This organization has been registered and people from Canada

00:28:37.875 --> 00:28:40.083
and elsewhere are ready to donate to it but here I do not

00:28:40.458 --> 00:28:42.125
find anybody to work for this organization.

00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:45.083
If the local women take it upon themselves to work for this

00:28:45.333 --> 00:28:47.375
organization only then it will succeed.

00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:49.542
We have acquired land and all the facilities but we do not

00:28:49.917 --> 00:28:52.208
find time to devote for this organization.

00:28:52.834 --> 00:28:54.417
So how can we go to this place?

00:28:54.417 --> 00:28:56.208
But one should remember that people are coming from abroad

00:28:56.208 --> 00:28:58.125
with the money to donate for your organization.

00:28:58.375 --> 00:28:59.750
They have brought fourteen machines for the women here.

00:29:00.542 --> 00:29:02.625
You can see women loitering about without doing anything.

00:29:03.083 --> 00:29:04.875
You can ask them to work so that they can earn

00:29:04.875 --> 00:29:07.583
something out of it. And they can prosper.

00:29:07.583 --> 00:29:10.041
At least these things we should try to think about.

00:29:10.417 --> 00:29:12.041
Instead of that we always think about ourselves.

00:29:12.291 --> 00:29:13.875
So the persons who are in Sahaja Yoga should know that this

00:29:14.208 --> 00:29:15.959
selfish attitude is not accepted in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:16.709 --> 00:29:18.583
We should think in terms of global advantage.

00:29:18.875 --> 00:29:20.792
The lives (Vibhouti) of saint are for the salvation

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:22.458
of the world. And also for the salvation of saint lives,

00:29:22.792 --> 00:29:24.000
this world exists.

00:29:24.417 --> 00:29:26.500
Thus the saints will be blessed by this attitude…

00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:30.041
(VIBHOUTI means Ashes with which Shiva is decorated).

00:29:30.583 --> 00:29:33.875
Now you have become saints you should behave like saints

00:29:34.208 --> 00:29:36.417
and the first quality of a saint is giving.

00:29:36.417 --> 00:29:39.750
You have never heard of a saint plundering anybody.

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.542
If a saint thinks of cheating he does not remain a saint.

00:29:43.917 --> 00:29:45.792
Thus from our side we should always think how much

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.792
we can give and what we can give,

00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:52.458
how much love we can give.

00:29:52.834 --> 00:29:54.417
And how many people we can help.

00:29:54.875 --> 00:29:56.542
All our attention should be for this purpose.

00:29:57.417 --> 00:29:59.208
Nowadays there are welfare associations

00:29:59.667 --> 00:30:02.041
just for election purposes.

00:30:02.458 --> 00:30:05.417
We should not create any such type of welfare association.

00:30:05.959 --> 00:30:07.208
But we should create associations in which we can

00:30:07.583 --> 00:30:09.500
work selflessly and our love should be NIRVAJYA (selfless)

00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:12.500
and we should not expect anything in return.

00:30:12.834 --> 00:30:15.083
And there are no limits for our love, it is an endless love.

00:30:15.458 --> 00:30:17.542
When we have this kind of love automatically

00:30:17.999 --> 00:30:19.834
we will know what is to be done.

00:30:19.834 --> 00:30:21.583
The improvements should be done gradually and every

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.417
Sahaja yogi should contribute to this collective welfare.

00:30:25.417 --> 00:30:26.625
We should try to devote our time for this purpose and

00:30:26.917 --> 00:30:28.667
work hard to achieve our goals. It should not happen

00:30:29.083 --> 00:30:31.417
that “Shri Mataji has come, She gives a talk,

00:30:31.417 --> 00:30:33.542
and when She goes everything is finished.”

00:30:33.542 --> 00:30:35.542
These people (from abroad) have done a lot.

00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:37.999
They have started schools and social welfare.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.125
We should also start something in this manner.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:42.375
Sahaja Yoga should not become an association of people

00:30:42.917 --> 00:30:44.999
who have realized the spirit and are swimming in the joy

00:30:44.999 --> 00:30:48.000
but are lazy lumps.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.709
It should not happen this way.

00:30:51.709 --> 00:30:54.959
We should try to see how we can help others.

00:30:54.959 --> 00:30:57.875
We should open our eyes to look around us with love

00:30:57.875 --> 00:31:00.208
and try to see how we can help others.

00:31:00.667 --> 00:31:04.834
Still I have not been able to move to India.

00:31:05.208 --> 00:31:07.291
Once I come back to India you will see that

00:31:07.583 --> 00:31:09.834
I will make everyone work.

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:11.959
Thus it is advisable to start working before I come.

00:31:11.959 --> 00:31:14.458
Sahaja Yoga is not meant only for sitting and meditating.

00:31:14.458 --> 00:31:16.333
For meditating why do you need Sahaja Yoga?

00:31:16.792 --> 00:31:18.333
You can go the Himalayas.

00:31:18.709 --> 00:31:20.417
If you want to stay here and be in Sahaja Yoga then

00:31:20.667 --> 00:31:22.709
the common people should be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:23.208 --> 00:31:25.291
But Sahaja Yoga should not become like these

00:31:25.291 --> 00:31:27.125
modern welfare organizations.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.834
We should try to achieve our goals with full sincerity

00:31:30.125 --> 00:31:32.417
and only then we can say that we have established Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.333
Now I heard a lot of praise for Me.

00:31:36.875 --> 00:31:39.709
I heard the songs and they gave Me a lot of Joy and

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:42.667
satisfaction that people have recognized Me.

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.583
But you should remember one thing – you should work

00:31:45.834 --> 00:31:47.458
in order to know yourself because you cannot see

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.417
yourself in the mirror.

00:31:49.834 --> 00:31:51.875
You should be able to see what you have achieved,

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.999
like in the earlier days you used to look after

00:31:54.417 --> 00:31:56.375
your household, your children. In the same manner,

00:31:56.625 --> 00:31:58.959
if you are not able to work for the collective,

00:31:58.959 --> 00:32:01.125
then in My opinion, you have not achieved anything

00:32:01.417 --> 00:32:03.417
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:03.667 --> 00:32:05.709
You have remained where you were,

00:32:06.041 --> 00:32:08.000
you have not progressed at all.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:12.458
Next year when I come, you should be able to tell Me

00:32:12.917 --> 00:32:14.999
how many banyan trees you have planted.

00:32:15.542 --> 00:32:19.041
Secondly, you should be able to tell Me what collective

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.166
or social work you have done.

00:32:21.625 --> 00:32:23.750
If you try to look around you will definitely be able

00:32:24.166 --> 00:32:26.291
to see some collective work which you can do

00:32:26.709 --> 00:32:28.542
and you should do.

00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:31.125
I’m sure you will be able to do it very well.

00:32:31.542 --> 00:32:33.417
It doesn’t need any money – only you have to decide

00:32:33.959 --> 00:32:35.375
within your heart. When I started Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:35.792 --> 00:32:37.333
at that time I’d given realization to one lady only

00:32:37.792 --> 00:32:39.625
and I started without any money.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.291
I did not have support from anybody but even then

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:44.417
I started Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:44.959 --> 00:32:48.000
But because of honesty of the work and the consistency,

00:32:48.417 --> 00:32:50.417
it has spread so much.

00:32:50.792 --> 00:32:51.917
Now each one of you, man or woman,

00:32:52.583 --> 00:32:54.999
you have the responsibility that when you will

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.792
introduce Sahaja Yoga to the general public,

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:02.250
you will be able to give them some proof of the general

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.834
well being. You need not break any law for this.

00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:08.500
You need not do anything wrong nor need you do

00:33:08.792 --> 00:33:11.667
anything unlawful. In a very simple way if you just

00:33:12.041 --> 00:33:14.333
open your eyes you will be able to see what you can do

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.417
for the general welfare of the people,

00:33:16.417 --> 00:33:18.750
how you can help the wellbeing of the people.

00:33:19.291 --> 00:33:21.250
And I’m here to give you all the strength and energy

00:33:21.625 --> 00:33:23.166
to do this work.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.417
We do not need any vote nor any money or anything else.

00:33:25.792 --> 00:33:27.375
You should give you Me a promise that without expecting

00:33:27.667 --> 00:33:29.625
anything in return you will start working for

00:33:29.625 --> 00:33:32.500
the welfare of the people.

00:33:32.875 --> 00:33:35.000
Sometimes, it might so happen that when people start

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.625
some welfare work they go round asking for funds.

00:33:37.625 --> 00:33:39.625
This is wrong. We should not ask for money in the beginning.

00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:42.250
First you should start some work which does not need money.

00:33:42.542 --> 00:33:44.500
Everyone feels that without money we cannot do anything.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.792
You have got the powers so why do you need money?

00:33:47.166 --> 00:33:50.458
If somebody is sick or not well in your neighborhood

00:33:50.834 --> 00:33:54.625
then you can go and visit him and try to soothe that person.

00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:57.542
Instead of that, what I see is that

00:33:57.917 --> 00:33:59.333
you bring the sick person to Me.

00:33:59.709 --> 00:34:01.041
The other day, someone brought

00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:02.834
an injured person to Me. He had a broken arm.

00:34:03.083 --> 00:34:04.834
A Sahaja yogi could have treated him in two minutes and

00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:06.834
made him well but instead of that, they brought him to Me

00:34:07.125 --> 00:34:08.333
and that too right in the middle of a public program

00:34:08.625 --> 00:34:10.125
and asked Me to treat his arm.

00:34:10.458 --> 00:34:11.792
You are so many and all the powers are flowing

00:34:12.125 --> 00:34:14.083
through your hands but still you do not use them.

00:34:14.417 --> 00:34:18.125
If you are not able to treat even these small ailments

00:34:18.917 --> 00:34:22.999
what is the use of you being a Sahaja yogi? Someone says,

00:34:23.834 --> 00:34:26.500
"my mother is sick, my father has broken his leg.”

00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:31.625
Instead of bringing them to Me you can easily treat them.

00:34:32.041 --> 00:34:35.083
You do have the powers, try to use them.

00:34:35.709 --> 00:34:37.750
Thus you should be able to help the people without

00:34:38.667 --> 00:34:41.834
expecting anything in return and with full Joy.

00:34:42.417 --> 00:34:45.125
You will be able to feel a lot of joy when you have

00:34:45.667 --> 00:34:48.250
the feeling that you do not do anything but you are just

00:34:50.667 --> 00:34:53.583
an instrument of God and you are living in this world,

00:34:54.709 --> 00:34:57.999
in this country and you are giving something special to them.

00:34:58.625 --> 00:35:01.083
It is such a big thing, such a big understanding.

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:02.959
With such a feeling, if all of you decide to work,

00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:06.375
then, you will be able to do something for others

00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:10.166
and other people will see what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.999
Now people think what is Sahaja Yoga –

00:35:14.542 --> 00:35:17.041
just everybody meditating together and that’s all.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.792
Even if there is some problem in the country Sahaja yogis

00:35:20.041 --> 00:35:22.166
are just sitting in meditation.

00:35:22.542 --> 00:35:24.417
One man came and told Me, “My wife doesn’t cook.”

00:35:24.417 --> 00:35:26.458
I asked, “Why?” He said, “She just meditates.”

00:35:26.875 --> 00:35:28.625
So I said, “Is it so? But who told her that?”

00:35:28.875 --> 00:35:30.959
First she should cook, for meditation even

00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:33.166
five minutes are sufficient.

00:35:33.417 --> 00:35:35.667
I have given you the power and the energy to cook well.

00:35:35.667 --> 00:35:38.750
Thus one should have the confidence

00:35:40.333 --> 00:35:43.667
that you are capable of work.

00:35:44.166 --> 00:35:46.166
I am giving you the powers, you can assimilate them.

00:35:46.458 --> 00:35:48.667
If you just meditate every day it is not sufficient.

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:50.999
You have to see what wellbeing you are

00:35:51.458 --> 00:35:55.000
giving to the others.

00:35:55.709 --> 00:35:57.750
But instead of that, you always think about your own wellbeing

00:35:57.999 --> 00:35:59.667
and come and ask Me to treat your son, your father,

00:35:59.667 --> 00:36:01.458
your mother, or ask that you should get a good job.

00:36:01.709 --> 00:36:02.875
And you want that I should also come to your house

00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:04.041
to eat, do this, do that.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.250
This way, you try to impose your will upon Me

00:36:06.458 --> 00:36:10.041
but about you, what can you do?

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.166
You should always remember that you have to do something.

00:36:13.458 --> 00:36:15.125
“I will show Shri Mataji what I’m capable of,

00:36:15.542 --> 00:36:17.250
to do something special.”

00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:20.709
We should decide this once and for all.

00:36:21.166 --> 00:36:26.166
I have an image in front of My eyes as Shri Gyaneshwara

00:36:26.583 --> 00:36:32.667
has said, "BOLTE PIYUSHANCHE SAGAR."

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.208
(Words or sayings are like the oceans of nectar)

00:36:40.041 --> 00:36:42.917
Where is it? I want to see it.

00:36:44.417 --> 00:36:46.999
Thus on this auspicious day I give you

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.250
all My sweet blessings that you will help everyone

00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:52.166
and look after their wellbeing and you will treat

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:56.125
everyone with love and you will talk sweetly,

00:36:56.667 --> 00:36:59.458
full of love.

00:37:23.709 --> 00:37:25.333
He is saying you should put your hands

00:37:25.917 --> 00:37:28.750
like this to say that you are bound by Mother's words.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:32.000
And we will try to do good to others and

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:35.667
we will be very kind to each other.

00:37:40.083 --> 00:37:44.291
I've been telling them that we have to be collective

00:37:44.834 --> 00:37:47.083
not among only Sahaja Yogis but with others also.

00:37:47.458 --> 00:37:49.709
We should see surroundings, what's wrong where,

00:37:50.125 --> 00:37:55.333
how we can help. We have many social obligations

00:37:55.709 --> 00:37:57.458
which we have to fulfill.

00:37:57.834 --> 00:38:00.583
Now you have reached the stage where you can do that

00:38:00.959 --> 00:38:06.542
without forming any social organization which collects money

00:38:06.959 --> 00:38:09.458
and have saints and things that kind of a nonsense.

00:38:09.917 --> 00:38:13.875
But you can see around yourself who are the needy,

00:38:14.208 --> 00:38:16.417
to whom you can help.

00:38:16.834 --> 00:38:18.959
And that is how you can really give

00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:23.000
a very positive form to Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:38.792 --> 00:38:40.792
Marathi

00:38:59.333 --> 00:39:00.667
Rahurila

00:48:25.959 --> 00:48:29.083
I'll be giving this water to all of you

00:48:29.709 --> 00:48:34.959
all the leaders and aslo..

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:37.542
you can take it.

00:48:38.375 --> 00:48:39.834
this water is very good for

00:48:40.291 --> 00:48:45.166
all diseases of the Mooladhara chakra.
