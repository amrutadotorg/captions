00:17.959 --> 00:26.208
Sankranti Puja, Rahuri, India

00:28.834 --> 00:37.417
January 14th, 1987

01:31.166 --> 01:37.291
Today is the day where we celebrate the change

01:38.125 --> 01:42.834
of the axis of the Sun and that He moves

01:43.625 --> 01:48.041
towards the tropic of cancer.

01:54.834 --> 01:59.250
Tropic of cancer is the one

02:02.000 --> 02:06.959
which represents the motherhood,

02:12.166 --> 02:17.625
the motherhood of the Earth.

02:25.333 --> 02:31.000
This tropic of Cancer has passed through

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
quite a big area of land

02:35.583 --> 02:39.709
while the tropic of Capricorn has not.

02:42.834 --> 02:45.667
And the area through which it has passed

02:47.291 --> 02:49.917
it has created

02:52.208 --> 03:01.375
different beautiful manifestation

03:02.959 --> 03:07.959
of the motherhood qualities on this Earth.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.709
We celebrate this change

03:16.250 --> 03:20.667
because the Sun has now moved into the new

03:23.917 --> 03:29.208
dimension so that all over the world

03:32.083 --> 03:37.834
there will be the warmth of the Sun.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.250
Warmth of the Sun

03:45.709 --> 03:50.917
represents the warmth of God's love.

03:53.125 --> 03:56.333
This is the reason why we celebrate

03:57.333 --> 04:02.125
this festival

04:03.583 --> 04:06.000
by giving you some sort of a sweet

04:06.667 --> 04:09.417
made out of sesame seeds.

04:10.000 --> 04:19.166
Sesame seeds are given because they are also heat giving

04:20.458 --> 04:24.417
and now as we are coming from the cold,

04:25.041 --> 04:31.000
we come to the hot season, in a way hotter season,

04:31.667 --> 04:36.959
so to prepare you with that warmth of the Sun.

04:38.999 --> 04:43.208
These special things are made out of the seed

04:43.792 --> 04:49.375
of sesame to represent the oncoming warmth

04:50.000 --> 04:54.709
and the warm of the Sun.

04:57.208 --> 05:00.125
Though in India the heat is too much,

05:00.792 --> 05:07.583
still people are waiting for this time to come in

05:08.250 --> 05:11.999
and they celebrate it with such a warm heart.

05:12.458 --> 05:17.000
At this time it is said that

05:19.166 --> 05:26.291
they give you this sesame seed and the sugar to eat,

05:26.875 --> 05:30.959
but now you must speak in a sweet manner,

05:31.583 --> 05:36.125
"gudd gudd bola", means you must speak in the sweet manner.

05:36.709 --> 05:41.750
Speaking in the sweet manner is very important.

05:42.542 --> 05:47.083
Some people think it is smart to speak in a rude manner

05:47.667 --> 05:52.750
or is very intelligent to shout on people,

05:55.667 --> 06:00.000
but no one likes this kind of a personality.

06:00.625 --> 06:06.667
You may be intelligent, you may be very sharp or smart,

06:07.959 --> 06:11.999
maybe on a television people may like to see you,

06:13.125 --> 06:17.125
but not as companions, as friends.

06:17.750 --> 06:23.667
To speak in a very sweet manner

06:24.375 --> 06:31.500
is a sign of good breeding, good culture and fear of God.

06:32.041 --> 06:35.041
Those who fear God will never speak

06:35.583 --> 06:38.834
rudely to another person, because in another person

06:39.417 --> 06:42.291
also the same spirit is shining

06:42.792 --> 06:47.750
and why should we be sharp or angry with another person

06:48.166 --> 06:53.458
who is created by God Almighty as we are created.

06:54.375 --> 06:59.583
So this loving, beautiful relationship

07:00.041 --> 07:01.333
that we have with each other,

07:01.417 --> 07:03.500
after Sahaja Yoga especially,

07:04.999 --> 07:08.667
let us express in talking to each other sweetly.

07:09.125 --> 07:13.041
There are so many ways by which we could be sweet.

07:16.542 --> 07:19.834
There are little, little things if you do,

07:21.166 --> 07:23.375
you can create lot of sweetness,

07:23.917 --> 07:29.125
but you need not a sharp tongue, but a sharp memory.

07:29.834 --> 07:32.375
I try these things many a times.

07:33.417 --> 07:38.500
Once one of the Sahaja Yogi,

07:38.625 --> 07:42.000
who is a very good Sahaja Yogi and an active Sahaja Yogi,

07:42.417 --> 07:45.250
was going in the car with Me

07:46.750 --> 07:54.208
and his knife was stolen by the driver or somebody

07:54.667 --> 07:57.667
and he got very angry with the driver.

07:58.041 --> 08:00.999
I said, "Forget it, you see he is an poor man,

08:01.375 --> 08:05.291
so he has taken it away, doesn't matter, just forget it."

08:05.667 --> 08:08.000
He says, "No, it was because it's a present to me

08:08.333 --> 08:10.542
from somebody who was in Switzerland and

08:10.875 --> 08:13.375
it's a Swiss knife which I was keeping with me.

08:13.792 --> 08:18.250
So I feel sorry that I have lost it."

08:18.709 --> 08:20.834
When I went to Switzerland I bought that kind of a

08:21.125 --> 08:23.083
same knife for him.

08:23.583 --> 08:26.792
When I came, when I gave him,

08:27.166 --> 08:28.709
he didn't have words to say anything.

08:29.083 --> 08:32.083
He said, "Mother, how did You remember?

08:32.542 --> 08:34.000
After such a long time how did you manage

08:34.792 --> 08:36.041
to get this knife?"

08:36.792 --> 08:37.959
I said, "I have a very good memory."

08:38.583 --> 08:41.333
That's the trouble with Me.

08:41.917 --> 08:45.083
The memory is so good that sometimes,

08:45.500 --> 08:47.375
I just don't know,

08:49.417 --> 08:51.834
I may embarrass some people with My memory.

08:52.166 --> 08:55.999
It is that good, I don't forget anything whatsoever.

08:56.417 --> 08:58.208
I, of course, forget all the bad things,

08:58.583 --> 09:02.041
because no use remembering bad things,

09:02.750 --> 09:04.625
no use thinking of them.

09:05.083 --> 09:09.250
Because of forgiveness you can always forget the bad things.

09:09.792 --> 09:11.709
And if you remember the good things

09:12.375 --> 09:15.417
your joy becomes multiplied.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.959
If you try to remember something bad

09:18.458 --> 09:19.917
then your joy goes down.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.041
Every time you see a person try to remember

09:22.583 --> 09:25.542
what good that person has done to you.

09:25.959 --> 09:28.000
What good that person has.

09:28.417 --> 09:31.083
If you have memory for good things

09:33.083 --> 09:35.834
you will have a very nice time.

09:36.583 --> 09:39.999
Now today is the day when you are all leaving India.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.667
Some of you will be leaving day after tomorrow.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.083
Whatever it is,

09:44.750 --> 09:47.959
I have to tell you one thing, that

09:48.625 --> 09:53.375
whatever was possible has been done here, for you people

09:53.792 --> 09:56.375
to give you joy and happiness.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.125
Now when you are going back,

09:59.500 --> 10:02.041
try to remember all that was said to you.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.000
All that was nice.

10:04.458 --> 10:05.917
How people praised you.

10:06.333 --> 10:09.500
How they loved you. How they were kind to you.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.959
How you met some nice people.

10:12.291 --> 10:14.417
What nice experiences you had

10:14.875 --> 10:18.500
but don't brood over things which are worthless.

10:18.834 --> 10:22.125
All right, somebody must have said something harsh to you

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
or you might have said something harsh to someone,

10:24.917 --> 10:26.500
just forget it.

10:26.999 --> 10:29.417
Try to understand that you are spoiling

10:29.792 --> 10:32.291
your chances of enjoying life.

10:32.875 --> 10:40.542
Nobody is hurt by that so try to be extremely happy

10:41.083 --> 10:42.917
that you have met so many people,

10:43.375 --> 10:44.875
that you have had weddings,

10:45.250 --> 10:46.917
that you have seen so many weddings.

10:47.208 --> 10:51.125
We have had a nice time and every bit of it was

10:51.500 --> 10:54.667
full of joyous vibrations.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.709
Of course, today some of you would be a little unhappy

10:58.125 --> 11:01.750
I can understand that because your spouses are leaving,

11:02.208 --> 11:04.417
somebody's husbands are going away or

11:04.750 --> 11:06.375
somebody's wives are going away.

11:06.792 --> 11:07.875
So I can see some of them

11:08.250 --> 11:11.625
are looking rather miserable about it.

11:17.417 --> 11:19.875
But that's a good thing because it is out of love

11:20.250 --> 11:23.667
and out of attraction for each other,

11:24.083 --> 11:26.458
for enjoying the company of each other.

11:26.792 --> 11:29.083
That's suggestive of something very good to Me

11:29.417 --> 11:31.959
but still I would say that, after all,

11:32.333 --> 11:34.375
you are going to meet each other

11:34.750 --> 11:35.999
and remember all the good things that

11:36.417 --> 11:38.083
you have said to each other,

11:38.458 --> 11:41.583
you have enjoyed with each other and try to keep happy.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.834
Because these days will pass very fast.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.291
In Sahaja Yoga you just forget time, everything,

11:47.625 --> 11:51.083
the time passes so fast and all these things will pass over

11:51.417 --> 11:55.417
and you will be again united with your husbands or wives,

11:55.792 --> 11:57.125
whatever may be the case.

11:57.709 --> 12:00.917
So there is nothing to feel very sad about all these things,

12:01.166 --> 12:03.250
and to keep smiling and laughing,

12:03.709 --> 12:04.917
so when they are departing also,

12:05.417 --> 12:08.917
they should not feel, see your last face full of tears but,

12:11.041 --> 12:15.999
but remember the face of assurance and courage,

12:16.375 --> 12:18.750
that the hope is there,

12:19.083 --> 12:20.458
we are going to meet very soon and

12:20.917 --> 12:23.333
there is nothing to feel very sad about it.

12:23.750 --> 12:27.333
Today is the day to make joy and to enjoy everything

12:27.834 --> 12:33.333
and to feel the blessings of God all around us.

12:33.792 --> 12:37.750
The Sun has come back in His own glory

12:38.333 --> 12:43.834
and we have to wish Him all success in the coming year,

12:44.208 --> 12:46.041
because in this part of Maharashtra

12:46.417 --> 12:48.333
as you know there has been no rain.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.709
There has been problems with them and

12:51.000 --> 12:52.333
we have to wish Him success

12:53.041 --> 12:58.041
so that He can bring forth the rain

12:59.000 --> 13:04.959
and all that is needed out of this solar energy

13:05.375 --> 13:07.709
that we have in this country.

13:09.750 --> 13:12.917
And you have to be beaming like the Sun

13:13.291 --> 13:14.959
when you go back to your countries.

13:15.542 --> 13:18.917
That your countries are not so hot as ours are neither

13:19.208 --> 13:22.625
you have that much of warmth there and you can find

13:22.999 --> 13:26.458
that why people are so warm and so much loving because

13:26.875 --> 13:28.500
we have the Sun with us.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.417
Now you carry the Sun with you and you give them love

13:32.750 --> 13:37.709
and affection and warmth and let them feel that the Sun

13:38.083 --> 13:40.625
has been brought from India by you.

13:40.959 --> 13:43.083
Whenever I have traveled anywhere, in any country,

13:43.542 --> 13:46.041
the Sun used to be there very bright, so they said that,

13:46.625 --> 13:49.250
there is a saying that, when the Indians travel

13:49.999 --> 13:51.500
they carry the Sun with them.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.875
Of course you can't carry the Sun in your pockets

13:54.542 --> 13:56.709
but we must be carrying it in our hearts, the Sun.

13:57.208 --> 13:59.125
That must be the reason that's why

13:59.500 --> 14:00.709
the Sun was shining so well

14:01.333 --> 14:02.834
and everybody came out with their good dresses

14:03.208 --> 14:04.999
and everything was ...were, and were enjoying.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.333
So this is what it is,

14:07.875 --> 14:09.625
that you have to carry the Sun with you

14:10.041 --> 14:13.625
speaking sweetly today and forever to each other

14:14.000 --> 14:16.750
to be friendly, to be helpful, to be kind

14:17.250 --> 14:18.792
because you are yogis,

14:19.125 --> 14:20.375
you are not ordinary people.

14:20.750 --> 14:23.834
You are yogis, you represent that category of people

14:24.083 --> 14:25.709
who are known for their righteousness,

14:25.959 --> 14:28.834
for their goodness and for their compassion and love.

14:29.291 --> 14:31.917
So I wish you all best of luck.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.542
Enjoy your journeys,

14:33.959 --> 14:36.750
enjoy everything and pass this joy

14:37.125 --> 14:38.417
that you have achieved here,

14:38.959 --> 14:40.542
to other people, to other Sahaja Yogis

14:41.000 --> 14:43.999
and to other people who are not even Sahaja Yogis.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.750
May God bless you with that.

14:46.999 --> 14:49.000
Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.

14:49.375 --> 14:52.000
Today is an auspicious day and on this day we give sesame

14:53.125 --> 14:55.875
seeds to others and ask them to talk sweetly.

14:56.834 --> 14:59.125
We tell others but it would be better if we tell it

14:59.999 --> 15:02.959
to ourselves also because it is easier to tell others

15:03.500 --> 15:05.667
to talk sweetly but: “I’ll talk harshly.”

15:06.458 --> 15:08.083
With this habit of ours have created

15:08.834 --> 15:12.166
wrong ideas about ourselves. We do not have any idea

15:13.333 --> 15:17.083
of the blessings that God has bestowed upon us.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.625
God has given such a lot of blessings to us in this country.

15:20.959 --> 15:24.208
But in this country people do not care much for cleanliness.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.625
In this country there are different types of germs

15:28.291 --> 15:30.792
and parasites.

15:31.041 --> 15:33.000
I feel that we have all the parasites of the whole world

15:33.542 --> 15:35.834
in this country. We even have parasites which

15:36.291 --> 15:38.709
cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

15:39.291 --> 15:42.458
If these parasites go to the other countries they will die.

15:42.959 --> 15:45.000
Because of the cold they cannot survive.

15:45.458 --> 15:48.166
Due to the Sun, there are so many parasites in this country.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.792
Once a scientist asked Me, “How is it possible to remain

15:52.709 --> 15:56.041
alive with so many parasites present in your country?”

15:56.583 --> 15:58.792
I replied that “In this country, the people are not only

15:59.542 --> 16:01.375
alive but live with joy and happiness,

16:02.250 --> 16:04.000
with a lot of bliss and happiness.”

16:04.417 --> 16:06.083
The reason for this is the Sun.

16:06.583 --> 16:08.083
The Sun has taught us to keep our homes open

16:08.792 --> 16:10.333
and also open our hearts.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.458
In England, if you have to go out somewhere

16:16.166 --> 16:19.125
then you have to spend at least fifteen minutes just to put

16:19.625 --> 16:21.125
on the right clothes.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.542
It’s as if you are wearing a shield before going out,

16:23.834 --> 16:27.959
otherwise you might catch a cold and affect your head.

16:29.083 --> 16:30.625
This is the situation there.

16:30.959 --> 16:34.083
Today you are sitting here in the open but we cannot sit

16:34.625 --> 16:36.583
like this in England or in any other Western country.

16:38.041 --> 16:41.250
Because of the weather these countries have become very cold.

16:43.583 --> 16:47.125
Even in our country there are areas (city), for example

16:49.291 --> 16:52.333
if you go to cities like Bhowali or the other side of

16:53.417 --> 16:57.208
Nainital and Dehradun and very close to the Himalayas, then

16:58.125 --> 17:02.834
you can find the cold weather as in the other countries.

17:03.625 --> 17:08.667
There, it is also cold like in England and America.

17:09.458 --> 17:12.000
But in these cold countries not even birds or insects

17:12.458 --> 17:13.542
can survive.

17:14.709 --> 17:18.291
There are a lot of forests with beautiful flowers in them.

17:20.417 --> 17:22.250
They call it a valley of flowers.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.625
There are so many beautiful flowers – as if it is a paradise

17:25.250 --> 17:27.333
on earth – but this feeling is only for a moment.

17:28.417 --> 17:30.667
It is so cold there that we cannot even open our eyes

17:31.250 --> 17:32.834
to see that beautiful place.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.208
We have to wear spectacles otherwise our eyes are hurt,

17:36.792 --> 17:38.125
because of the cold.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.709
But in spite of the cold,

17:41.125 --> 17:43.583
those countries have progressed so much.

17:44.166 --> 17:48.500
They have fought against the nature and the cold climate

17:49.500 --> 17:52.417
and strengthened their countries.

17:54.291 --> 17:57.417
In spite of having a lot of sun, we have not been able

17:58.125 --> 18:00.333
to exploit its advantages.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.667
We can also produce solar energy.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.458
If we use the solar energy we will never have a dearth

18:05.959 --> 18:07.375
of (electrical) energy.

18:07.709 --> 18:09.667
Even the cars can run on solar energy.

18:09.999 --> 18:11.709
But the attention of the politicians here in India

18:12.000 --> 18:14.083
is elsewhere and due to this fact, we cannot exploit

18:14.542 --> 18:17.500
the advantages from the sun but suffer from it.

18:17.917 --> 18:21.917
If we do not go to the extremes then we can do a lot of work.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.000
The main thing which we can learn from the Sun

18:24.291 --> 18:27.834
is Its capacity of giving. It always gives.

18:28.917 --> 18:32.041
It does not take anything but always gives.

18:32.750 --> 18:36.083
Due to this tremendous giving power of the Sun

18:36.834 --> 18:39.667
we can have rain, we can have crops and living beings.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.166
If we did not have the sun then we would not have anything.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.041
It is due to the giving power of love of the Sun only, that

18:44.542 --> 18:46.917
we have been able to reach this state.

18:47.208 --> 18:49.250
Thus what we have to learn from the Sun is that we should

18:49.542 --> 18:51.417
also develop the power of giving.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.542
If we look around us we will find people who will always

18:53.875 --> 18:56.458
think, “How I can save money and keep it for myself?”

18:56.834 --> 18:59.291
Even if I give money for some programs, some people still

18:59.542 --> 19:01.667
think how they can save money from that also.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.542
Even if I have given them some money to spend they always

19:04.834 --> 19:08.000
have a tendency to save money from everything. Why?

19:08.417 --> 19:10.208
Because there is a tendency to hold on to something.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.542
If someone goes to the market and they find that prices

19:12.834 --> 19:14.458
have risen, and if we ask, “Why?” they reply that

19:14.792 --> 19:16.750
“Because the others have increased the prices,

19:16.999 --> 19:18.250
that’s why I also increase the price.”

19:18.583 --> 19:20.917
If the (cost) prices of the commodities are not rising then

19:21.583 --> 19:23.917
why do they raise the (selling) price?

19:24.667 --> 19:28.000
They have always a tendency to suck the energy of others.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.792
Even if I want to make a small ceremony for a festive

19:31.000 --> 19:33.083
occasion, then others tell Me,

19:43.166 --> 19:44.834
“Shri Mataji you will not be able to succeed.”

19:45.834 --> 19:48.417
When I ask, “Why?” the reply is that people are corrupt and

19:48.792 --> 19:50.875
they will eat (grab) money.

19:51.333 --> 19:54.166
As I eat the food they eat money, so maybe we will not get

19:54.625 --> 19:57.000
along together. It is such an absurd thing.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.083
Those who are responsible for the country’s welfare,

19:59.500 --> 20:01.625
those who are the administrators and those on whom the power

20:01.917 --> 20:04.875
has been bestowed by God, even they do not understand that

20:05.375 --> 20:08.417
we have to give.

20:08.917 --> 20:13.000
This quality of giving one has to learn from the Sun:

20:14.250 --> 20:17.041
that we have come (on this earth) to give and not to take.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.750
This complete change from within has to be reached with

20:20.166 --> 20:21.750
an understanding that we have to give and not to take.

20:22.208 --> 20:24.291
We have to have the passion of giving.

20:24.792 --> 20:27.625
It’s as if when a mother knows that “Today my son is coming”

20:27.875 --> 20:29.583
then with passion she thinks, “What can I do for him,

20:29.875 --> 20:32.667
what food can I cook for him?”

20:32.917 --> 20:35.208
This is the passion which a mother has.

20:35.500 --> 20:38.291
Even if she doesn’t have the ingredients, she might borrow

20:38.667 --> 20:41.417
them from the neighbors and prepare some sweets for you.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.166
She always feel that she has not done enough.

20:44.500 --> 20:48.542
Unless and until we have this kind of collective passion

20:48.792 --> 20:50.709
from inside and have this kind of feeling about others,

20:51.000 --> 20:54.166
no country can progress, neither our own nor other countries.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.375
But we always have the urge to take things from others,

20:57.750 --> 20:59.959
to plunder from others, to borrow from others or

21:00.166 --> 21:02.125
to deceive others. Because of this urge our children

21:02.542 --> 21:04.959
will suffer, we will suffer and we will not be able

21:05.166 --> 21:08.125
to achieve anything in this country.

21:08.583 --> 21:12.291
In My in-law’s village (inaudible)…to build a lake.

21:12.750 --> 21:15.166
The government gave them money in thousands for the purpose.

21:15.667 --> 21:17.417
But the lake was never built.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.000
They said that they had dug a hole to make a lake but then

21:20.291 --> 21:22.875
they covered it again since they did not find any water.

21:23.166 --> 21:25.750
But in fact the hole was never dug.

21:25.999 --> 21:28.458
So where did the money go?

21:28.917 --> 21:30.542
They sent it to Switzerland (bank).

21:30.542 --> 21:32.291
So the banks will again borrow from Switzerland and send

21:32.625 --> 21:34.041
the money again to Switzerland.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.041
If the Sun acts in this way then we cannot survive

21:36.041 --> 21:37.834
even for one day.

21:38.125 --> 21:41.375
If he alone eats (consumes) everything, what can we eat?

21:42.250 --> 21:44.625
Today we are celebrating the SANKRANTI.

21:45.333 --> 21:50.083
Sankranti means a sort of Kranti (revolution) by which

21:50.417 --> 21:52.000
we acquire the habit of giving.

21:52.625 --> 21:56.333
Everybody says that we should have the habit of giving

21:56.875 --> 21:59.625
but most of the people believe in donating something

22:00.041 --> 22:02.333
to the priest.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.333
Also, many people preach the art of giving

22:06.625 --> 22:08.667
just to fill their own pockets.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.875
This doesn’t have any meaning.

22:11.625 --> 22:15.875
There is always a question of whom to give and why to give.

22:16.417 --> 22:18.792
In fact, in all liberty and freedom, we should see

22:19.166 --> 22:21.750
for ourselves what we are giving for our country,

22:22.041 --> 22:25.500
for our brothers and sisters and our neighbors.

22:26.542 --> 22:29.583
We should not be selfish, but give with all our heart

22:30.250 --> 22:33.041
so that we get all the joy of giving.

22:33.999 --> 22:37.208
When we give with all our heart, the joy that we get

22:38.166 --> 22:41.583
cannot be compared with any other joy.

22:42.333 --> 22:44.750
If we want to feel this kind of joy only, then we should

22:45.166 --> 22:50.083
celebrate the SANKRANTI today.

22:51.500 --> 22:56.458
Our nature should become like the Sun.

22:57.542 --> 23:00.750
Whatever he is doing, he doesn’t have the feeling that

23:01.375 --> 23:04.999
he is doing something. He is doing everything in AKARMA

23:05.750 --> 23:07.999
(without the feeling of doing anything) and constantly

23:08.458 --> 23:11.583
burning himself and giving you joy, light,

23:12.000 --> 23:16.709
the essence of living, and he nourishes you.

23:17.041 --> 23:19.875
We see the Sun every day and many people do Namaskar also,

23:20.291 --> 23:22.041
but we only do Namaskar without imbibing

23:22.375 --> 23:23.834
his qualities of giving.

23:24.417 --> 23:26.417
I told you a very small thing:

23:26.875 --> 23:29.542
that every Sahaja yogi

23:29.834 --> 23:33.125
should plant a banyan tree in his garden.

23:33.583 --> 23:35.000
Why do we have to take money from the government

23:35.291 --> 23:36.875
for this purpose?

23:37.291 --> 23:38.542
Just to plant a tree and put a fence around that

23:38.875 --> 23:40.583
tree doesn’t need much money.

23:40.999 --> 23:42.291
Even to smoke bidi (tobacco) costs more.

23:42.709 --> 23:44.667
Try to do this small thing so that others should see that

23:44.667 --> 23:46.542
you are at least doing something.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.000
In spite of this we always think how we can get money

23:49.417 --> 23:51.291
from others, how we can plunder others and how we can

23:51.792 --> 23:53.917
save money at others cost.

23:54.291 --> 23:56.500
Because of these tendencies within us,

23:56.959 --> 23:59.375
our country can never progress.

23:59.959 --> 24:02.125
We did not have these tendencies before in people,

24:02.709 --> 24:04.750
in the earlier days.

24:05.333 --> 24:08.709
I can tell you that when I was young I saw people who

24:08.959 --> 24:12.291
believed only in giving and never in taking.

24:12.959 --> 24:15.917
I saw them giving only, they did not like taking.

24:16.500 --> 24:20.041
Even the parents did not like it if the children took

24:20.667 --> 24:23.125
something from others and would tell them to return it.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.208
I still remember in My father’s house they had made

24:25.208 --> 24:27.166
some chairs and also an umbrella, out of silver.

24:27.625 --> 24:30.667
Everybody asked, “Why did you make these out of silver?”

24:31.250 --> 24:33.166
So the reply was, “When we have marriage ceremonies,

24:33.166 --> 24:35.458
instead of borrowing or hiring them,

24:35.709 --> 24:37.250
it would be better that we have them with us once

24:37.250 --> 24:39.208
and for all, because if we had to hire then sometimes

24:39.500 --> 24:41.250
we did not get them in time because the earlier person

24:41.250 --> 24:42.875
who had borrowed had not returned them.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.542
And sometimes these umbrellas were lost because someone

24:44.542 --> 24:46.458
had never returned them and so they got lost.”

24:46.709 --> 24:47.917
So what I wanted to say is that if we have money,

24:48.375 --> 24:49.750
we should invest it into something collective.

24:49.999 --> 24:51.291
If you want to construct a badminton court,

24:51.291 --> 24:53.709
then in that court everybody should be able to come

24:53.709 --> 24:55.166
and play and we should not say that only my children

24:55.500 --> 24:57.083
should play in that court. If somebody buys a car,

24:57.375 --> 24:58.625
we should be able to take all the children to school.

24:59.041 --> 25:01.333
Thus we should buy a big car so that all the children

25:01.834 --> 25:03.291
can be taken to school.

25:03.875 --> 25:05.458
This habit of being collective and being useful

25:05.750 --> 25:07.750
to everybody, one should learn from the Sun.

25:08.041 --> 25:09.999
And today is a special day when we can learn this thing

25:10.291 --> 25:13.709
from the Sun. And we should take a vow that

25:14.250 --> 25:17.333
“I’ll do something which is collective.”

25:18.000 --> 25:20.291
I do not understand how people can eat without caring

25:20.709 --> 25:22.250
for the common public.

25:23.125 --> 25:24.999
You do not even worry about your neighbors and do not

25:25.375 --> 25:26.750
do anything for the common people.

25:27.375 --> 25:30.458
I told you a very small thing is to plant a tree.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.542
We have got so many yogis in Maharashtra,

25:33.917 --> 25:36.291
even if each one plants one tree and looks after it,

25:36.709 --> 25:39.125
this will be certainly helpful to everybody.

25:39.500 --> 25:43.250
Thus I request all of you to do something collective and

25:43.875 --> 25:45.750
it will be useful to everybody.

25:46.417 --> 25:49.041
But one should never think how much will I earn from it

25:49.375 --> 25:50.917
and make money out of it.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.291
It should not happen like the way we give money

25:53.709 --> 25:55.000
to the priest.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.583
One should open his heart and lovingly do something

25:57.875 --> 25:59.583
for the collective and feel the joy out of it.

26:00.417 --> 26:02.375
One should make it a habit.

26:02.667 --> 26:04.542
I do not want to say that others should have

26:05.000 --> 26:06.834
everything for free.

26:07.208 --> 26:08.959
I never said that you do something for free for

26:09.250 --> 26:11.291
the people who have come from abroad.

26:11.792 --> 26:14.250
If you look at them you will see that they have brought

26:14.250 --> 26:18.625
so many things for you from abroad to give you as presents.

26:19.208 --> 26:21.375
Of course I have contributed a lot.

26:21.792 --> 26:23.709
But they have also brought a lot of things of their own.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.875
When I saw the presents here, I thought that they were

26:25.875 --> 26:27.834
the presents which I had bought in Rome for you

26:28.083 --> 26:29.959
but then they told Me that these were the presents

26:30.375 --> 26:32.417
which they bought themselves and they had not

26:32.417 --> 26:34.709
brought My presents.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.166
They felt such a lot of joy to bring so many things

26:37.458 --> 26:38.625
for you.

26:38.999 --> 26:41.667
They do not even know in Italy to whom these presents were

26:41.917 --> 26:44.041
to be given but they do not bother.

26:44.291 --> 26:46.083
They leave it to Me to give them to the Sahaja yogis

26:46.458 --> 26:48.125
here in India.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.750
But in India we have a tendency to think only about

26:51.083 --> 26:53.458
our children and about our mother.

26:53.834 --> 26:55.959
Then the mother comes walking, limping on one leg.

26:56.291 --> 26:58.750
Then you start saying that “My mother did not get

26:58.750 --> 27:00.834
a high quality sari.”

27:01.208 --> 27:04.583
Since I do not have one I give her a simple sari.

27:04.959 --> 27:07.500
This is the tendency here.

27:07.834 --> 27:10.125
But with the people from abroad it is just the opposite.

27:10.417 --> 27:12.542
When they came here they came with so many presents

27:12.542 --> 27:15.709
it seems they brought two tons of presents from abroad.

27:16.041 --> 27:18.166
Even My hands starting paining while giving these

27:18.542 --> 27:20.417
two tons of presents.

27:20.792 --> 27:23.667
What I want to say is that they do not expect anything

27:24.083 --> 27:25.959
from you. But your behavior should be such as to show

27:26.166 --> 27:28.583
an example for them. And you should show them that

27:28.583 --> 27:31.000
you are in no way inferior to them,

27:31.417 --> 27:33.458
“We are here really to serve you, to welcome you,

27:33.792 --> 27:35.083
whatever is possible from our side

27:35.083 --> 27:37.000
we do not hesitate to do.”

27:37.333 --> 27:39.041
It doesn’t cost any money nor any hard work.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.917
The only thing is that we should change our outlook.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.834
If even after coming in Sahaja Yoga we are not able

27:44.834 --> 27:46.709
to change our nature in this manner then I do not feel

27:46.709 --> 27:49.333
that we can change the entire humanity with Sahaja Yoga.

27:49.583 --> 27:51.583
The biggest quality in us is to give to others.

27:52.083 --> 27:54.083
And this quality we should imbibe within us.

27:54.083 --> 27:56.041
In Sahaja yoga your Kundalini is awakened and you

27:56.500 --> 27:58.250
realize your spirit but the essence of spirit is like that

27:58.792 --> 28:00.625
of the Sun and this essence is of giving.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.625
If you have seen one photograph of Mine, there is the Sun

28:03.875 --> 28:05.583
shining on My heart; in fact there is a Sun in My heart

28:05.875 --> 28:08.208
and because of this I never feel that I should take something

28:08.500 --> 28:11.000
from them or to plunder anybody.

28:11.875 --> 28:14.125
I do not understand from which part of your head this idea

28:14.667 --> 28:16.208
of plundering them comes from.

28:16.625 --> 28:19.166
This is a very strange behavior.

28:19.583 --> 28:21.375
Sahaja yogis should not think in this way but on the contrary

28:21.625 --> 28:23.667
every day we must think what we can give or do for others.

28:24.083 --> 28:25.959
In Rahuri itself I have started an organization

28:26.208 --> 28:27.792
whose name is “SAHAJ STREE SUDHAR” or “SAMAJSUDHAR”

28:28.166 --> 28:29.709
(association for the welfare of women).

28:30.125 --> 28:31.999
Through Life Eternal Trust we cannot use the money for

28:32.333 --> 28:33.792
the welfare of the women thus we had to create

28:34.166 --> 28:35.375
this organization.

28:35.667 --> 28:37.542
This organization has been registered and people from Canada

28:37.875 --> 28:40.083
and elsewhere are ready to donate to it but here I do not

28:40.458 --> 28:42.125
find anybody to work for this organization.

28:42.625 --> 28:45.083
If the local women take it upon themselves to work for this

28:45.333 --> 28:47.375
organization only then it will succeed.

28:47.667 --> 28:49.542
We have acquired land and all the facilities but we do not

28:49.917 --> 28:52.208
find time to devote for this organization.

28:52.834 --> 28:54.417
So how can we go to this place?

28:54.417 --> 28:56.208
But one should remember that people are coming from abroad

28:56.208 --> 28:58.125
with the money to donate for your organization.

28:58.375 --> 28:59.750
They have brought fourteen machines for the women here.

29:00.542 --> 29:02.625
You can see women loitering about without doing anything.

29:03.083 --> 29:04.875
You can ask them to work so that they can earn

29:04.875 --> 29:07.583
something out of it. And they can prosper.

29:07.583 --> 29:10.041
At least these things we should try to think about.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.041
Instead of that we always think about ourselves.

29:12.291 --> 29:13.875
So the persons who are in Sahaja Yoga should know that this

29:14.208 --> 29:15.959
selfish attitude is not accepted in Sahaja Yoga.

29:16.709 --> 29:18.583
We should think in terms of global advantage.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.792
The lives (Vibhouti) of saint are for the salvation

29:20.792 --> 29:22.458
of the world. And also for the salvation of saint lives,

29:22.792 --> 29:24.000
this world exists.

29:24.417 --> 29:26.500
Thus the saints will be blessed by this attitude…

29:26.875 --> 29:30.041
(VIBHOUTI means Ashes with which Shiva is decorated).

29:30.583 --> 29:33.875
Now you have become saints you should behave like saints

29:34.208 --> 29:36.417
and the first quality of a saint is giving.

29:36.417 --> 29:39.750
You have never heard of a saint plundering anybody.

29:40.250 --> 29:43.542
If a saint thinks of cheating he does not remain a saint.

29:43.917 --> 29:45.792
Thus from our side we should always think how much

29:46.000 --> 29:47.792
we can give and what we can give,

29:48.041 --> 29:52.458
how much love we can give.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.417
And how many people we can help.

29:54.875 --> 29:56.542
All our attention should be for this purpose.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.208
Nowadays there are welfare associations

29:59.667 --> 30:02.041
just for election purposes.

30:02.458 --> 30:05.417
We should not create any such type of welfare association.

30:05.959 --> 30:07.208
But we should create associations in which we can

30:07.583 --> 30:09.500
work selflessly and our love should be NIRVAJYA (selfless)

30:09.999 --> 30:12.500
and we should not expect anything in return.

30:12.834 --> 30:15.083
And there are no limits for our love, it is an endless love.

30:15.458 --> 30:17.542
When we have this kind of love automatically

30:17.999 --> 30:19.834
we will know what is to be done.

30:19.834 --> 30:21.583
The improvements should be done gradually and every

30:23.000 --> 30:25.417
Sahaja yogi should contribute to this collective welfare.

30:25.417 --> 30:26.625
We should try to devote our time for this purpose and

30:26.917 --> 30:28.667
work hard to achieve our goals. It should not happen

30:29.083 --> 30:31.417
that “Shri Mataji has come, She gives a talk,

30:31.417 --> 30:33.542
and when She goes everything is finished.”

30:33.542 --> 30:35.542
These people (from abroad) have done a lot.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.999
They have started schools and social welfare.

30:38.500 --> 30:40.125
We should also start something in this manner.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.375
Sahaja Yoga should not become an association of people

30:42.917 --> 30:44.999
who have realized the spirit and are swimming in the joy

30:44.999 --> 30:48.000
but are lazy lumps.

30:48.500 --> 30:51.709
It should not happen this way.

30:51.709 --> 30:54.959
We should try to see how we can help others.

30:54.959 --> 30:57.875
We should open our eyes to look around us with love

30:57.875 --> 31:00.208
and try to see how we can help others.

31:00.667 --> 31:04.834
Still I have not been able to move to India.

31:05.208 --> 31:07.291
Once I come back to India you will see that

31:07.583 --> 31:09.834
I will make everyone work.

31:09.834 --> 31:11.959
Thus it is advisable to start working before I come.

31:11.959 --> 31:14.458
Sahaja Yoga is not meant only for sitting and meditating.

31:14.458 --> 31:16.333
For meditating why do you need Sahaja Yoga?

31:16.792 --> 31:18.333
You can go the Himalayas.

31:18.709 --> 31:20.417
If you want to stay here and be in Sahaja Yoga then

31:20.667 --> 31:22.709
the common people should be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

31:23.208 --> 31:25.291
But Sahaja Yoga should not become like these

31:25.291 --> 31:27.125
modern welfare organizations.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.834
We should try to achieve our goals with full sincerity

31:30.125 --> 31:32.417
and only then we can say that we have established Sahaja Yoga.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.333
Now I heard a lot of praise for Me.

31:36.875 --> 31:39.709
I heard the songs and they gave Me a lot of Joy and

31:40.083 --> 31:42.667
satisfaction that people have recognized Me.

31:43.500 --> 31:45.583
But you should remember one thing – you should work

31:45.834 --> 31:47.458
in order to know yourself because you cannot see

31:47.750 --> 31:49.417
yourself in the mirror.

31:49.834 --> 31:51.875
You should be able to see what you have achieved,

31:52.500 --> 31:53.999
like in the earlier days you used to look after

31:54.417 --> 31:56.375
your household, your children. In the same manner,

31:56.625 --> 31:58.959
if you are not able to work for the collective,

31:58.959 --> 32:01.125
then in My opinion, you have not achieved anything

32:01.417 --> 32:03.417
through Sahaja Yoga.

32:03.667 --> 32:05.709
You have remained where you were,

32:06.041 --> 32:08.000
you have not progressed at all.

32:08.500 --> 32:12.458
Next year when I come, you should be able to tell Me

32:12.917 --> 32:14.999
how many banyan trees you have planted.

32:15.542 --> 32:19.041
Secondly, you should be able to tell Me what collective

32:19.500 --> 32:21.166
or social work you have done.

32:21.625 --> 32:23.750
If you try to look around you will definitely be able

32:24.166 --> 32:26.291
to see some collective work which you can do

32:26.709 --> 32:28.542
and you should do.

32:29.583 --> 32:31.125
I’m sure you will be able to do it very well.

32:31.542 --> 32:33.417
It doesn’t need any money – only you have to decide

32:33.959 --> 32:35.375
within your heart. When I started Sahaja Yoga,

32:35.792 --> 32:37.333
at that time I’d given realization to one lady only

32:37.792 --> 32:39.625
and I started without any money.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.291
I did not have support from anybody but even then

32:42.625 --> 32:44.417
I started Sahaja Yoga.

32:44.959 --> 32:48.000
But because of honesty of the work and the consistency,

32:48.417 --> 32:50.417
it has spread so much.

32:50.792 --> 32:51.917
Now each one of you, man or woman,

32:52.583 --> 32:54.999
you have the responsibility that when you will

32:55.250 --> 32:58.792
introduce Sahaja Yoga to the general public,

32:59.500 --> 33:02.250
you will be able to give them some proof of the general

33:02.500 --> 33:05.834
well being. You need not break any law for this.

33:06.125 --> 33:08.500
You need not do anything wrong nor need you do

33:08.792 --> 33:11.667
anything unlawful. In a very simple way if you just

33:12.041 --> 33:14.333
open your eyes you will be able to see what you can do

33:14.750 --> 33:16.417
for the general welfare of the people,

33:16.417 --> 33:18.750
how you can help the wellbeing of the people.

33:19.291 --> 33:21.250
And I’m here to give you all the strength and energy

33:21.625 --> 33:23.166
to do this work.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.417
We do not need any vote nor any money or anything else.

33:25.792 --> 33:27.375
You should give you Me a promise that without expecting

33:27.667 --> 33:29.625
anything in return you will start working for

33:29.625 --> 33:32.500
the welfare of the people.

33:32.875 --> 33:35.000
Sometimes, it might so happen that when people start

33:35.000 --> 33:37.625
some welfare work they go round asking for funds.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.625
This is wrong. We should not ask for money in the beginning.

33:39.625 --> 33:42.250
First you should start some work which does not need money.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.500
Everyone feels that without money we cannot do anything.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.792
You have got the powers so why do you need money?

33:47.166 --> 33:50.458
If somebody is sick or not well in your neighborhood

33:50.834 --> 33:54.625
then you can go and visit him and try to soothe that person.

33:56.333 --> 33:57.542
Instead of that, what I see is that

33:57.917 --> 33:59.333
you bring the sick person to Me.

33:59.709 --> 34:01.041
The other day, someone brought

34:01.041 --> 34:02.834
an injured person to Me. He had a broken arm.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.834
A Sahaja yogi could have treated him in two minutes and

34:05.041 --> 34:06.834
made him well but instead of that, they brought him to Me

34:07.125 --> 34:08.333
and that too right in the middle of a public program

34:08.625 --> 34:10.125
and asked Me to treat his arm.

34:10.458 --> 34:11.792
You are so many and all the powers are flowing

34:12.125 --> 34:14.083
through your hands but still you do not use them.

34:14.417 --> 34:18.125
If you are not able to treat even these small ailments

34:18.917 --> 34:22.999
what is the use of you being a Sahaja yogi? Someone says,

34:23.834 --> 34:26.500
"my mother is sick, my father has broken his leg.”

34:27.417 --> 34:31.625
Instead of bringing them to Me you can easily treat them.

34:32.041 --> 34:35.083
You do have the powers, try to use them.

34:35.709 --> 34:37.750
Thus you should be able to help the people without

34:38.667 --> 34:41.834
expecting anything in return and with full Joy.

34:42.417 --> 34:45.125
You will be able to feel a lot of joy when you have

34:45.667 --> 34:48.250
the feeling that you do not do anything but you are just

34:50.667 --> 34:53.583
an instrument of God and you are living in this world,

34:54.709 --> 34:57.999
in this country and you are giving something special to them.

34:58.625 --> 35:01.083
It is such a big thing, such a big understanding.

35:01.333 --> 35:02.959
With such a feeling, if all of you decide to work,

35:03.375 --> 35:06.375
then, you will be able to do something for others

35:07.041 --> 35:10.166
and other people will see what Sahaja Yoga is.

35:12.500 --> 35:13.999
Now people think what is Sahaja Yoga –

35:14.542 --> 35:17.041
just everybody meditating together and that’s all.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.792
Even if there is some problem in the country Sahaja yogis

35:20.041 --> 35:22.166
are just sitting in meditation.

35:22.542 --> 35:24.417
One man came and told Me, “My wife doesn’t cook.”

35:24.417 --> 35:26.458
I asked, “Why?” He said, “She just meditates.”

35:26.875 --> 35:28.625
So I said, “Is it so? But who told her that?”

35:28.875 --> 35:30.959
First she should cook, for meditation even

35:31.208 --> 35:33.166
five minutes are sufficient.

35:33.417 --> 35:35.667
I have given you the power and the energy to cook well.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.750
Thus one should have the confidence

35:40.333 --> 35:43.667
that you are capable of work.

35:44.166 --> 35:46.166
I am giving you the powers, you can assimilate them.

35:46.458 --> 35:48.667
If you just meditate every day it is not sufficient.

35:48.667 --> 35:50.999
You have to see what wellbeing you are

35:51.458 --> 35:55.000
giving to the others.

35:55.709 --> 35:57.750
But instead of that, you always think about your own wellbeing

35:57.999 --> 35:59.667
and come and ask Me to treat your son, your father,

35:59.667 --> 36:01.458
your mother, or ask that you should get a good job.

36:01.709 --> 36:02.875
And you want that I should also come to your house

36:03.125 --> 36:04.041
to eat, do this, do that.

36:04.250 --> 36:06.250
This way, you try to impose your will upon Me

36:06.458 --> 36:10.041
but about you, what can you do?

36:10.500 --> 36:13.166
You should always remember that you have to do something.

36:13.458 --> 36:15.125
“I will show Shri Mataji what I’m capable of,

36:15.542 --> 36:17.250
to do something special.”

36:17.625 --> 36:20.709
We should decide this once and for all.

36:21.166 --> 36:26.166
I have an image in front of My eyes as Shri Gyaneshwara

36:26.583 --> 36:32.667
has said, "BOLTE PIYUSHANCHE SAGAR."

36:35.500 --> 36:39.208
(Words or sayings are like the oceans of nectar)

36:40.041 --> 36:42.917
Where is it? I want to see it.

36:44.417 --> 36:46.999
Thus on this auspicious day I give you

36:47.500 --> 36:49.250
all My sweet blessings that you will help everyone

36:49.999 --> 36:52.166
and look after their wellbeing and you will treat

36:52.500 --> 36:56.125
everyone with love and you will talk sweetly,

36:56.667 --> 36:59.458
full of love.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.333
He is saying you should put your hands

37:25.917 --> 37:28.750
like this to say that you are bound by Mother's words.

37:29.250 --> 37:32.000
And we will try to do good to others and

37:32.375 --> 37:35.667
we will be very kind to each other.

37:40.083 --> 37:44.291
I've been telling them that we have to be collective

37:44.834 --> 37:47.083
not among only Sahaja Yogis but with others also.

37:47.458 --> 37:49.709
We should see surroundings, what's wrong where,

37:50.125 --> 37:55.333
how we can help. We have many social obligations

37:55.709 --> 37:57.458
which we have to fulfill.

37:57.834 --> 38:00.583
Now you have reached the stage where you can do that

38:00.959 --> 38:06.542
without forming any social organization which collects money

38:06.959 --> 38:09.458
and have saints and things that kind of a nonsense.

38:09.917 --> 38:13.875
But you can see around yourself who are the needy,

38:14.208 --> 38:16.417
to whom you can help.

38:16.834 --> 38:18.959
And that is how you can really give

38:19.333 --> 38:23.000
a very positive form to Sahaja Yoga.

38:38.792 --> 38:40.792
Marathi

38:59.333 --> 39:00.667
Rahurila

48:25.959 --> 48:29.083
I'll be giving this water to all of you

48:29.709 --> 48:34.959
all the leaders and aslo..

48:36.500 --> 48:37.542
you can take it.

48:38.375 --> 48:39.834
this water is very good for

48:40.291 --> 48:45.166
all diseases of the Mooladhara chakra.
