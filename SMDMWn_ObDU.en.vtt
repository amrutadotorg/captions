00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.833
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Krishna Puja.

00:00:16.374 --> 00:00:24.583
We have to understand clearly that Shri Krishna

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:30.042
is a very, very important deity within us

00:00:31.374 --> 00:00:34.958
because He is the Vishnu,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.167
who resides in the Void,

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.917
in the Nabhi.

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:52.708
He is the one who generates Dharma within us.

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:56.958
When you got your realization I didn’t tell you,

00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:59.583
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

00:01:00.042 --> 00:01:05.000
I never told you that “This is not good. That is not good.”

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:07.500
You just did it

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:14.209
because Shri Vishnu was awakened within you.

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:17.375
He is in the Void

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:21.917
and if He is awakened

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:30.042
He brings you to the light,

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:33.958
removes your ignorance, removes your darkness,

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:38.458
and you start seeing that

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.833
whatever you were doing was destructive for you,

00:01:44.374 --> 00:01:49.042
and that’s how the dharma is established.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:53.125
Of course, the Dharma was established also

00:01:53.583 --> 00:01:59.750
by all the ten Gurus who came on this earth,

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:04.416
the prophets, who taught us about dharma.

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:18.583
So this combination of Shri Vishnu

00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:22.375
and the ten Gurus

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:28.209
is to establish Dharma within us.

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:31.541
Now this Dharma is taught by prophets,

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:33.625
as you have seen everywhere.

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:37.416
They have said, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.209
They have talked of Ten Commandments.

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:46.583
Every prophet has talked about Dharma, what is to be done,

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:51.416
up to a point when Christ also had to talk about it

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:55.958
and He says, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:02:56.375 --> 00:03:04.666
But Shri Krishna is the one

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:10.750
who says that “I come on this earth

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:21.209
when there is a glani, means demise, of Dharma.”

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:24.833
When the Dharma becomes weak

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.583
then He comes on this Earth,

00:03:28.084 --> 00:03:30.792
and then He destroys the people

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.416
who are responsible

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:45.875
for bringing Dharma to this level of doom.

00:03:46.958 --> 00:03:49.875
The second thing He says, that

00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:55.500
“I protect the saints. I protect the saints

00:03:56.875 --> 00:04:04.708
and I kill all those who are devils or who are satanic,

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:06.708
who are destructive.”

00:04:07.084 --> 00:04:08.750
These are His promises

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:13.625
which He gave long time back as Shri Krishna.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:18.833
As Vishnu we know Him only as the one

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.167
who is the giver of Dharma, mainly.

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:27.375
But all His potent qualities really were expressed

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:29.875
when He came as Shri Krishna.

00:04:30.334 --> 00:04:33.458
At the time of Shri Rama also these qualities

00:04:33.917 --> 00:04:36.833
could not be expressed in that way.

00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:42.125
So Shri Krishna’s first half of His life

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.875
He spent in Gokul and Vrindavan

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:53.000
where He showed His beautiful expression of His character,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.458
as He made it,

00:04:57.917 --> 00:05:01.125
what He calls as Leela, Leeladhara,

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:06.334
the one who said that you become a witness;

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:11.250
you witness the whole world like a drama,

00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:12.917
Sakshi Swarupa.

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:19.958
And then once you see the whole world as just

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:27.625
a child watches, in a child-like mirth and joy, you enjoy life.

00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:29.375
That has happened to you people

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.833
that you have become like citizens of Vrindavan and Gokul,

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:36.917
the way you are enjoying yourself,

00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:42.625
enjoying each other’s company, enjoying the bliss of God.

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:45.917
Then He showed also by killing Kaliya,

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:48.583
by killing Putana and other people,

00:05:49.042 --> 00:05:55.875
that if anybody tries to trouble such joyous children of God,

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.125
He is the one who will definitely protect

00:06:02.458 --> 00:06:06.750
and kill all such evil forces which are troublesome.

00:06:07.292 --> 00:06:12.084
But later on He becomes the king,

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.625
and when He becomes the king

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.374
He uses His powers in a different way.

00:06:20.708 --> 00:06:24.792
First of all, if you see His own uncle, His own relation,

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:28.625
His own uncle, mother’s brother, was Kansa,

00:06:29.084 --> 00:06:31.167
and was such a bad man.

00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:35.833
So Shri Krishna didn’t spare him, He killed him.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.458
He killed so many people.

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:42.583
Before becoming the king, He killed so many people.

00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:50.334
Now what does that mean, that His own uncle He killed?

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:58.375
One quality that He has, which Christ had, we can say,

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:04.374
or so many saints had, is forgiveness.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.583
He did not believe in forgiveness.

00:07:09.084 --> 00:07:14.167
He’s the only one who said that, “I have to punish.”

00:07:14.625 --> 00:07:17.875
We have to have somebody who should punish also.

00:07:18.292 --> 00:07:20.000
If you are like Shiva,

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:23.209
then Shiva used to even love rakshasas

00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:28.250
and in His innocence He used to give them also blessings.

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:35.250
But Shri Krishna did not believe in forgiveness at all

00:07:36.084 --> 00:07:40.167
because it was important that there should be

00:07:40.458 --> 00:07:42.708
somebody with a very stern mind,

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:46.958
with such a stern understanding that a devil is a devil,

00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:50.792
and devil must be killed.

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:56.750
He has done in His lifetime,

00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:00.125
if you see, killing of so many people.

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:02.958
That doesn’t mean that we have right to kill anybody.

00:08:03.292 --> 00:08:06.167
He was Shri Krishna; we are not.

00:08:06.708 --> 00:08:10.666
We have to forgive because we are human beings.

00:08:11.084 --> 00:08:14.708
Once we forgive we transfer all our anger,

00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:23.416
all our attitude of taking revenge, to Shri Krishna.

00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:27.042
He takes over.

00:08:27.374 --> 00:08:30.334
Once you say that “I forgive,” then He takes over,

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:33.625
because He does not forgive.

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:38.875
He will immediately take over from you

00:08:39.375 --> 00:08:43.334
and if it is justifiable, if it is necessary

00:08:43.625 --> 00:08:49.375
He will punish the people who are torturing saints,

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.666
who are destroying the dharma.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.292
Now it is very surprising

00:08:56.583 --> 00:09:00.334
that whatever is preached by the person,

00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:05.084
that area becomes just the opposite of it.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.042
Is very surprising.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.375
Like we said that Christ said,

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:15.833
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:20.084
Christians are the worst as far as their eyes are concerned.

00:09:20.708 --> 00:09:27.125
In the same way, in the Hindu religion it is said that

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:31.375
everybody has the spirit.

00:09:31.792 --> 00:09:36.625
Still the Hindus believe in the different castes and communities

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:40.625
and fight with each other.

00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:47.250
Everything that was preached, just the opposite of it is followed.

00:09:47.666 --> 00:09:50.374
If you read even Koran, in the Koran,

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.334
Mohammed Sahib has all the time

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:56.292
said about rahmat, means compassion.

00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:58.375
But you don’t find it anywhere.

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:00.416
He has not said about shariat,

00:10:00.792 --> 00:10:02.167
He has not said of many things

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.666
which are being practiced by Muslims, just on their own.

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:09.458
He never said that women should cover their face

00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:12.042
or cover their heads,

00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:15.917
but it is practiced and not practiced but vengeance.

00:10:16.334 --> 00:10:21.833
So what it shows to us is this, that whatever is preached,

00:10:22.209 --> 00:10:26.541
just the opposite of that people try to do.

00:10:29.084 --> 00:10:33.917
And when such things happen, the dharma goes down.

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:40.000
Now as you know that Krishna, His country is America.

00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:42.292
He rules over America.

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:50.833
So it is a rich country because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

00:10:51.374 --> 00:10:54.958
He is the Lord of wealth.

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:59.084
So, He has given wealth to America.

00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:07.250
Then He is Vachana, means communication.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:13.541
His another quality is that He is the one who communicated.

00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:18.541
It was He who danced with gopis and gopas.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.958
It was He who transferred His powers to them.

00:11:26.416 --> 00:11:32.583
So the communication part is one of His greatest qualities

00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:35.334
that is working in America.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.917
So they are going just the opposite way

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:44.125
that if there is a war, say, with Saddam Hussein,

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.458
so America is going.

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:49.500
If there’s Korean War, America is going.

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:54.541
Everywhere there is any problem, America has to go.

00:11:54.792 --> 00:11:56.125
I mean, one can ask question,

00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:58.125
“Who are you? Why, why are you bothered?

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.416
Keep to your own country enjoying yourself.

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.625
Why are you sending troops all over?

00:12:02.958 --> 00:12:04.375
Why are you looking after everyone?”

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.334
Even the formation of UN and all that is done

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:11.666
under the guidance of the Americans.

00:12:12.042 --> 00:12:14.334
They play a very important part

00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:18.292
in the formation of this United Nations

00:12:18.708 --> 00:12:24.000
and one world and peace and all sorts of things.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:30.833
But actually, if you see, the main thing that Krishna had taught,

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.708
they are missing.

00:12:34.084 --> 00:12:35.750
They are all right for communication.

00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:39.583
They are all right for establishing

00:12:39.917 --> 00:12:42.750
relationships between countries.

00:12:43.167 --> 00:12:47.334
But the worst thing they have done is that there is no dharma,

00:12:47.625 --> 00:12:51.334
no idea of dharma, no morality.

00:12:52.292 --> 00:12:55.917
Democracy without morality.

00:12:56.374 --> 00:13:01.875
To talk of morality in America is something out of the blue.

00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:06.875
They cannot understand anyone who talks of morality.

00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:11.583
Now, of course, the pangs of their doings

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:15.000
is really torturing them.

00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:19.500
And also they are realizing, some of them,

00:13:19.833 --> 00:13:23.125
that because of immoral behavior

00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:28.167
they have come to a point where

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:32.833
sixty-five percent people of that country who are Americans

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:39.583
may suffer from some disease or may just die out

00:13:40.042 --> 00:13:42.292
at a very young age.

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:47.833
When it is coming

00:13:48.292 --> 00:13:55.167
as a starking

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.375
information is a shock.

00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:06.416
But despite that, despite all this,

00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:09.917
they are still going on with it and thinking that

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:15.167
“No, no, no, it’s all right. It’s not for us. What is there to worry?”

00:14:15.708 --> 00:14:19.792
Now His punishments have started,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.167
which they don’t realize how the punishment has started.

00:14:24.541 --> 00:14:29.125
Now supposing somebody is leading an immoral life

00:14:29.583 --> 00:14:34.084
and as a result he develops some disease.

00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:39.125
Now this disease is not curable.

00:14:39.958 --> 00:14:43.042
They try everything to find out the ways and methods

00:14:43.375 --> 00:14:45.917
of curing these diseases which are coming

00:14:46.292 --> 00:14:49.875
out of immoral living. They cannot.

00:14:50.334 --> 00:14:56.458
It’s an impossible task for all the medical sciences of America

00:14:56.708 --> 00:15:00.833
to find out how to cure these particular diseases

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:03.583
which are coming out of immorality.

00:15:03.917 --> 00:15:06.917
But the worst part is that they cannot even say

00:15:07.334 --> 00:15:11.209
that immorality is wrong.

00:15:11.792 --> 00:15:17.541
They cannot even openly admit that immoral behavior

00:15:17.958 --> 00:15:21.292
leads to these things.

00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:26.292
And this immorality is completely neglected

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.500
in a country of Shri Krishna where He was born,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.833
always He says, just to establish morality.

00:15:38.125 --> 00:15:41.167
Artificial morality, that is there,

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:45.084
like the Islamic talk about or the Christians talk about

00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:50.750
or Hindus talk about, is artificial, where they are hypocritical.

00:15:51.209 --> 00:15:53.541
They follow one code of conduct

00:15:53.958 --> 00:16:01.042
and another they have for themselves secretly adopted.

00:16:01.416 --> 00:16:05.125
But America is an open thing.

00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:08.875
Whatsoever they are doing they are not hiding it.

00:16:09.334 --> 00:16:11.458
They say, “We don’t believe in hypocrisy.”

00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:13.541
So they are not hiding it.

00:16:13.917 --> 00:16:17.875
And this has led this country, such a vast,

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.833
beautiful, rich, prosperous country,

00:16:21.209 --> 00:16:24.750
into such a ditch that I do not know

00:16:25.167 --> 00:16:27.875
how it is going to recover unless and until

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.750
it takes to Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:31.167 --> 00:16:37.416
Now another thing what dharma does to a normal person?

00:16:38.084 --> 00:16:41.125
A dharmic person is the one who is always

00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:43.875
introspective by nature.

00:16:44.334 --> 00:16:51.167
He tries to see, “Am I doing things all right? Is it correct?”

00:16:51.625 --> 00:16:56.708
He doesn’t allow his mind to justify wrong things.

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:00.250
That is one of the signs of a real dharmic person.

00:17:00.583 --> 00:17:02.209
He may not be a Sahaja yogi.

00:17:02.708 --> 00:17:08.708
But he will ask himself, “Is it right or is it wrong?”

00:17:09.209 --> 00:17:14.458
But that capacity is completely gone in America.

00:17:14.917 --> 00:17:17.833
They never try to introspect themselves.

00:17:18.334 --> 00:17:22.374
On the contrary, they always say, “What’s wrong?”

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:26.500
Those people who go on like this

00:17:26.917 --> 00:17:34.583
will definitely fall into a mess of things

00:17:34.958 --> 00:17:42.500
that will have no moral conductor, moral guidance.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:51.500
It is introspection which gives you a awakened conscience.

00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:55.374
It’s conscience which tells you, “This is wrong.”

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:57.875
They may be guided in one part.

00:17:58.292 --> 00:18:00.917
For example, you see, they might say that

00:18:01.374 --> 00:18:05.500
“We are all right in administration,” maybe, or,

00:18:05.917 --> 00:18:12.374
“We are all right for, say, our railways, our shipping,

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:17.374
our other things, or maybe other economic banks

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:19.374
or whatever it is.”

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.708
But all these things are extremely superficial

00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:26.625
for human beings and they are outside.

00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:32.250
The inside is all managed by the conscience

00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:38.374
and also through moral inspection of yourself.

00:18:38.792 --> 00:18:41.416
People say, “Mother, what is this conscience is?”

00:18:41.875 --> 00:18:43.292
This conscience is there.

00:18:43.708 --> 00:18:49.042
It is there all the time, but a person who has to be

00:18:49.458 --> 00:18:53.250
conscious about it. “I have a conscience”.

00:18:53.792 --> 00:18:57.500
And this conscience has to answer.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.625
That conscience that is within us is,

00:19:02.042 --> 00:19:07.666
is the light of Shri Krishna within us even before realization.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.708
As you know, the ascent takes place, of Kundalini,

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.334
through the Sushumna which is guided by Mahalakshmi.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:20.416
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.958
By listening to your conscience

00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:34.666
you develop a proper channel of Mahalakshmi within yourself.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.583
But the people who have no conscience,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.209
in a particular line it’s not so; it is in every line, in every way.

00:19:42.583 --> 00:19:44.375
Otherwise, one chakra will be all right,

00:19:44.792 --> 00:19:47.167
another chakra will be in jeopardy.

00:19:47.583 --> 00:19:51.500
So the conscience has to be referred to,

00:19:52.042 --> 00:19:55.292
which is beyond rationality. It is not rationality.

00:19:55.792 --> 00:19:58.917
Something may look like rational to kill somebody

00:19:59.334 --> 00:20:00.875
or to snatch somebody’s money

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:05.209
or to grab somebody’s land. May seem.

00:20:05.666 --> 00:20:10.042
But conscience will tell you that this is not right.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.875
At a time when people invaded so many countries

00:20:14.292 --> 00:20:17.750
and tried to overpower them,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.708
it was America which was the only country,

00:20:21.084 --> 00:20:24.416
you must understand, never went out of their bounds

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:27.374
to become empires.

00:20:27.833 --> 00:20:30.084
Very surprising, what kept them there.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.416
Because at that time when all this nonsense was going on

00:20:33.792 --> 00:20:38.917
all over the world, and that era when people

00:20:39.292 --> 00:20:41.209
didn’t mind subjecting other people,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.666
taking away their lands and becoming this thing,

00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:49.250
America had stopped at that time.

00:20:49.666 --> 00:20:52.334
Before doing that, they had done once for all.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:55.958
They had occupied the area, they became the landlords,

00:20:56.292 --> 00:20:59.167
they became this. Of course they were foreigners.

00:20:59.583 --> 00:21:01.708
But after having done that,

00:21:02.209 --> 00:21:05.541
the era when the people started expanding their empire,

00:21:06.042 --> 00:21:08.917
they did not do it.

00:21:09.416 --> 00:21:13.125
Now what is the reason? Why they didn’t do it?

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:14.500
We should ask a question:

00:21:14.875 --> 00:21:17.666
when others were expanding their empires,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
why did not America do it?

00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:24.875
The reason is very simple.

00:21:25.209 --> 00:21:28.750
At that time some great people with great conscience

00:21:29.167 --> 00:21:31.167
were born in that country

00:21:31.583 --> 00:21:35.042
and they guided that country.

00:21:35.458 --> 00:21:39.666
Like, you can say, Washington was there.

00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:45.541
Of course, there were so many people, whom if I name there,

00:21:45.917 --> 00:21:47.666
there will be a big list of those people.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.084
But if you see their character, their life, the way they lived.

00:21:51.416 --> 00:21:53.625
Abraham Lincoln, if you see his life,

00:21:54.084 --> 00:21:57.000
full of conscience, full of conscience.

00:21:57.458 --> 00:22:02.666
And they didn’t allow the nation to be drifted away

00:22:03.084 --> 00:22:06.084
to the ambition of gathering other countries

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.750
and making them their slaves and ...

00:22:09.167 --> 00:22:11.625
This they didn’t do.

00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:17.917
So in the first place when the,

00:22:18.334 --> 00:22:20.833
when, I should say, Columbus went there, conquered them,

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:26.375
and tried to … actually, he didn’t do much.

00:22:26.833 --> 00:22:29.458
But Spanish and then others, and then Anglo-Saxons,

00:22:29.833 --> 00:22:32.541
all of them, when they conquered that country,

00:22:32.958 --> 00:22:35.666
once they settled down there,

00:22:36.209 --> 00:22:41.541
as if that era was over for them once for all,

00:22:42.042 --> 00:22:45.334
and then they started talking about freedom,

00:22:45.792 --> 00:22:50.042
of democracy, of higher values.

00:22:50.583 --> 00:22:57.666
But the karmas of their past,

00:22:58.292 --> 00:23:03.458
the way they killed so many aboriginals,

00:23:03.958 --> 00:23:06.500
so many Red Indians,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.042
will not be forgiven by Shri Krishna

00:23:11.541 --> 00:23:16.917
unless and until now they take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:21.708
Despite that time when they did not try

00:23:22.209 --> 00:23:25.541
to overpower other countries and to spread their empire

00:23:25.958 --> 00:23:31.750
and do all kinds of cruelties, like Hitler, they didn’t do that.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:35.416
And they always stood for something that is justice …

00:23:35.917 --> 00:23:37.625
tried to, I mean, at least.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.666
Then they became hypocritical also but on the whole,

00:23:42.042 --> 00:23:45.042
on the face of it, they tried to show

00:23:45.374 --> 00:23:48.374
that they are for uniting the whole world.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:53.458
They are against racialism, against fundamentalism, all these,

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:59.209
I mean, just some sort of an idealism they propagated.

00:23:59.666 --> 00:24:06.000
But despite all that, all these ideas of self-destruction

00:24:06.374 --> 00:24:08.917
started working in them.

00:24:09.209 --> 00:24:14.334
So I would say it is nothing but their karmas

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:18.541
are working against them.

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:25.292
And that’s how the violence is so much rampant there.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.416
So many diseases, so many things,

00:24:28.917 --> 00:24:34.209
it is very remarkable that all these troubles have started

00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:38.750
very, very recently in America,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.958
because the exposure is coming up.

00:24:45.416 --> 00:24:48.374
To add up to that, we had lots of false gurus

00:24:48.708 --> 00:24:53.958
who went there and captured

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.792
innocent, simple people who were seeking the truth.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.416
We have lost so many of them in America.

00:25:00.792 --> 00:25:05.917
Also there, I would say, in the atmosphere where these

00:25:06.416 --> 00:25:09.334
curses of the people whom they had killed,

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:14.625
which reacted, and they took to something that was wrong.

00:25:15.042 --> 00:25:17.666
Why should they have taken to wrong things

00:25:18.042 --> 00:25:21.500
as far as their personal life is concerned?

00:25:21.958 --> 00:25:24.125
Freedom was given to them

00:25:24.583 --> 00:25:28.625
but they thought freedom is there also to ruin themselves

00:25:29.084 --> 00:25:32.375
or to make a mess out of their lives.

00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:36.708
This is a wrong idea which worked in them.

00:25:37.209 --> 00:25:39.500
Then the whole idea became collective.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.583
When it became collective they found out that people

00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:45.750
like all those things that are destructive.

00:25:46.292 --> 00:25:48.292
So, we have Hollywood there,

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.375
we have all such organizations and musicians

00:25:52.917 --> 00:25:59.875
and big, big, we can say, destructive forces

00:26:00.708 --> 00:26:08.000
which have formed groups and militant organizations

00:26:08.375 --> 00:26:15.625
which openly say that “We are that.”

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.833
For example, only in America we have satan’s,

00:26:23.292 --> 00:26:27.500
satan’s organization, devils’ organizations.

00:26:28.084 --> 00:26:32.292
Then there’s witchcraft. Openly.

00:26:32.792 --> 00:26:38.000
Openly, they are registered organizations in America,

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.958
when nowhere in the world you can have such a thing

00:26:41.292 --> 00:26:43.292
that this is a black magic organization,

00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:45.250
this is a witchcraft organization,

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:48.833
openly they are registered there.

00:26:49.334 --> 00:26:52.541
So to such an extent they have gone;

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.458
and accepted collectively.

00:26:56.917 --> 00:27:01.583
The reason is the punishment.

00:27:02.334 --> 00:27:07.708
That’s why America is the most difficult place for us,

00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:11.500
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:14.583
One must have real sympathy for them.

00:27:15.084 --> 00:27:19.583
They are now passing through the phase of punishment,

00:27:20.167 --> 00:27:24.958
because their forefathers did all kinds of wrong things

00:27:25.375 --> 00:27:30.375
and they, too, never accepted Dharma as a principle of life.

00:27:31.167 --> 00:27:34.375
They thought that Dharma means killing your freedom;

00:27:34.833 --> 00:27:39.334
dharma means it takes away your personal, private life

00:27:39.708 --> 00:27:45.458
into the hands of something else.

00:27:45.917 --> 00:27:50.875
So to establish Dharma in America,

00:27:51.666 --> 00:27:53.375
what can we do?

00:27:53.833 --> 00:27:56.541
I’ve been to America at least ten times

00:27:56.958 --> 00:28:00.292
more than I’ve been to Russia

00:28:00.833 --> 00:28:07.958
and I want to really somehow or other bring to their notice that

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.500
"You have lost your Dharma."

00:28:10.875 --> 00:28:12.374
But this will never appeal to them

00:28:12.708 --> 00:28:14.042
because they are very egoistical.

00:28:14.416 --> 00:28:17.458
If you tell them like that, then they’ll be very angry.

00:28:17.917 --> 00:28:20.334
On the contrary, those who tell them, like Rajneesh

00:28:20.666 --> 00:28:24.167
and all these people, “Oh, this, no dharma,” their weaknesses,

00:28:24.583 --> 00:28:27.875
their egos are pampered. Then they are very happy.

00:28:28.334 --> 00:28:30.875
So it’s a difficult task in that country

00:28:31.292 --> 00:28:35.458
to make people understand that you are under punishment,

00:28:35.917 --> 00:28:38.625
that this punishment you can only overcome

00:28:39.042 --> 00:28:41.292
if you become Sahaja yogis.

00:28:41.666 --> 00:28:45.334
With Sahaja Yoga their dharma will be awakened

00:28:45.792 --> 00:28:51.209
and all their punishments and all their curses will be over.

00:28:51.625 --> 00:28:54.209
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga much more

00:28:54.583 --> 00:28:56.416
than any other country.

00:28:56.875 --> 00:29:00.375
My concern for America is for the same reason.

00:29:00.958 --> 00:29:03.375
I’m not saying so much about South America

00:29:03.917 --> 00:29:06.250
but more about the North America.

00:29:06.666 --> 00:29:09.750
But even in South America, what I found is

00:29:10.292 --> 00:29:18.334
that it is a kind of a nation

00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:26.374
where they have no guidance at all about Dharma, no guidance.

00:29:27.167 --> 00:29:30.084
Openly they are doing carnival, this, that.

00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:35.708
I mean, how can you do it in a country, all those things?

00:29:36.125 --> 00:29:39.666
They are following the footsteps of North America.

00:29:40.125 --> 00:29:43.000
Like in North America they have that Halloween nonsense.

00:29:43.374 --> 00:29:44.833
I mean, imagine openly on the street

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.125
doing Halloween nonsense.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:49.042
So they are following carnival.

00:29:49.458 --> 00:29:52.416
To them, “Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

00:29:52.792 --> 00:29:56.416
as if there is a very big achievement and going into that carnival

00:29:56.792 --> 00:29:57.917
from all over the places.

00:29:58.374 --> 00:30:02.583
From Australia people are coming down.

00:30:03.875 --> 00:30:09.167
All this is working against them very much.

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:12.875
Their situation is so bad in so many ways

00:30:13.375 --> 00:30:20.000
that it is not easy to explain why they are going to that limit.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:26.625
Like thirteen-year-old girls are made into prostitutes in Brazil.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:30.458
Openly.

00:30:31.334 --> 00:30:35.375
All their trees are cut in Amazon. Openly.

00:30:35.917 --> 00:30:38.875
Whole smuggling is done, openly.

00:30:39.334 --> 00:30:41.750
Their politicians are corrupt.

00:30:42.125 --> 00:30:45.583
There, I mean, so much of black magic there,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.917
so much of black magic. Openly that.

00:30:49.374 --> 00:30:55.375
They are just following the footsteps of North America.

00:30:55.875 --> 00:31:00.833
The Dharma is like this Catholic Church is there.

00:31:01.334 --> 00:31:04.792
What is it going to teach them Dharma, this Catholic Church?

00:31:05.292 --> 00:31:08.374
So they go to church, they do everything

00:31:08.792 --> 00:31:14.792
and they come back home with same ideas that they have.

00:31:15.374 --> 00:31:19.374
There are countries and countries which are so very poor.

00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:25.000
So that shows that Kubera’s attention is not on that country.

00:31:25.541 --> 00:31:29.042
Normally, poor people are dharmic, normally.

00:31:29.666 --> 00:31:31.833
Because you see, money gives them these ideas

00:31:32.292 --> 00:31:35.167
to do all nonsensical things and ego.

00:31:35.625 --> 00:31:40.750
Normally, the poor people are dharmic but there it is different.

00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:44.209
They indulge into black magic too much.

00:31:44.583 --> 00:31:47.374
They were telling Me that it is the black magic

00:31:47.666 --> 00:31:50.209
which came from Africa and they have accepted.

00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:54.250
But so much it is developed in South America

00:31:54.666 --> 00:31:57.792
that it is impossible to understand that

00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:01.000
how they have accepted this nonsense

00:32:01.458 --> 00:32:04.792
so easily to curse themselves.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.000
Now, we have to understand that these problems

00:32:08.334 --> 00:32:13.666
also exist within ourselves, on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:32:14.458 --> 00:32:20.375
If we have to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra all right,

00:32:21.042 --> 00:32:26.167
we have two sides as you know, is the left and the right.

00:32:26.833 --> 00:32:34.374
So the right side is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is speaking,

00:32:34.833 --> 00:32:37.958
which is talking about Dharma,

00:32:38.374 --> 00:32:43.708
which is on the aggressive side, we can say.

00:32:44.583 --> 00:32:48.084
Now those people who are aggressive,

00:32:48.583 --> 00:32:50.375
who talk in an aggressive manner,

00:32:50.792 --> 00:32:56.666
who are, say, trying to dominate others by their talks,

00:32:57.375 --> 00:33:01.250
are the people who are right-sided.

00:33:01.666 --> 00:33:06.250
I’ve seen people, those who really do wrong things.

00:33:06.625 --> 00:33:10.792
Say, a person, a servant steals something.

00:33:11.374 --> 00:33:15.374
You call him, he’ll be so rude to you that you’ll be amazed.

00:33:15.708 --> 00:33:17.084
This man is so rude.

00:33:17.458 --> 00:33:22.375
How can he, how can have been able to steal something?

00:33:22.833 --> 00:33:26.917
He’s not afraid; he’s answering you back so nicely.

00:33:27.375 --> 00:33:29.625
So those people who are right-sided

00:33:30.042 --> 00:33:32.583
can cover up any sin that they have committed,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.250
any wrong they have done,

00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:38.000
any murder they have done, by their talk.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:43.334
It could be a talk which is very aggressive, blatant.

00:33:43.708 --> 00:33:47.875
People might think, “Oh, how can that be?

00:33:48.292 --> 00:33:51.458
This man is telling so loudly everything,”

00:33:51.917 --> 00:33:54.917
and you just, you are stunned and you think,

00:33:55.292 --> 00:33:58.334
“No, it’s not possible. How can a person who says this thing ?”

00:33:58.708 --> 00:34:02.958
In this way we, too, as ordinary human beings,

00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:07.917
indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things

00:34:08.375 --> 00:34:12.292
and then we try to justify it by talking,

00:34:13.167 --> 00:34:15.042
wriggling out of it.

00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:21.917
You know as many criminals, war criminals,

00:34:22.374 --> 00:34:25.917
have come out of it by just talking,

00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:29.750
by creating stories, by showing something like that.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.209
That also is with all human beings,

00:34:33.625 --> 00:34:36.666
they have this capacity to say something

00:34:37.084 --> 00:34:41.334
by which to hide whatever wrong you are doing.

00:34:41.708 --> 00:34:43.958
But it is never realized by them

00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:49.084
that whatever harm you have done is not going to be forgiven

00:34:50.334 --> 00:34:53.833
and will be less forgiven when you talk like this,

00:34:54.374 --> 00:34:57.250
because Shri Krishna is finished.

00:34:57.792 --> 00:35:03.167
If you start justifying, rationalizing all your wrong things,

00:35:03.792 --> 00:35:08.708
then you will be punished and you will be punished very badly

00:35:09.167 --> 00:35:13.792
in so many ways that you will not know how to get it out of it.

00:35:14.292 --> 00:35:18.833
Physically, mentally, emotionally, every way you’ll be.

00:35:19.416 --> 00:35:26.708
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have a temperament,

00:35:27.167 --> 00:35:31.625
a culture, a style, a behavior

00:35:32.084 --> 00:35:34.875
which has got the quality of Shri Krishna,

00:35:35.292 --> 00:35:40.458
which is called as madhurya, means melodious, melodious.

00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:45.416
We should talk in such a manner that it should be melodious.

00:35:45.917 --> 00:35:48.958
The person who listens to you,

00:35:49.416 --> 00:35:57.000
listens as if he’s listening to the flute of Shri Krishna.

00:35:57.458 --> 00:36:01.750
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be sweet like that.

00:36:02.209 --> 00:36:07.541
When you talk to someone it should be melodious.

00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:10.084
It should not be aggressive, at all,

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.458
but on the contrary it should be melodious.

00:36:13.958 --> 00:36:17.833
It should not be sarcastic; it should not hurt another person.

00:36:18.334 --> 00:36:22.917
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming

00:36:23.292 --> 00:36:25.875
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

00:36:26.292 --> 00:36:30.042
So in no way one should hurt.

00:36:30.583 --> 00:36:35.250
I wish all the Sahaja yogis develop that melodious voice

00:36:35.541 --> 00:36:39.209
of Shri Krishna as their Vishuddhi is awakened.

00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:45.792
Madhurya, in his behavior, madhurya is – you see,

00:36:46.167 --> 00:36:50.792
while talking to someone there are so many gestures by which

00:36:51.209 --> 00:36:55.000
you can express your madhurya.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.625
For example, specially in Italy and other places,

00:37:01.042 --> 00:37:02.833
I’ve seen people use too much of their hands.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:04.917
This is also Shri Krishna’s style.

00:37:05.374 --> 00:37:07.125
So they use their hands in such a way

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.209
that sometimes you don’t understand what they are meaning.

00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:13.875
And sometimes it can be quite aggressive also,

00:37:14.292 --> 00:37:15.875
the way they use their hands.

00:37:16.292 --> 00:37:19.209
Now, the hands must be used in such a way

00:37:19.625 --> 00:37:22.625
that it should create madhurya.

00:37:23.084 --> 00:37:28.209
I’ve seen this in Russia or specially in Eastern blocs

00:37:28.583 --> 00:37:32.000
where people, they have to express their love

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:37.125
– [just put like this, it’s cold] – if they have to say namaste.

00:37:37.541 --> 00:37:40.084
The whole expression is so sweet,

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:46.750
and also their heart is very full when they see Me.

00:37:47.167 --> 00:37:49.209
So they don’t know how to express it.

00:37:49.583 --> 00:37:53.917
So they just put their hands like this.

00:37:54.374 --> 00:37:56.541
Or they feel shy, they do like this.

00:37:57.084 --> 00:38:01.167
Very, very sweet things they express through their hands,

00:38:01.458 --> 00:38:06.958
through their eyes. It is the tears, you see,

00:38:07.374 --> 00:38:15.000
that really create such clouds of, I should say,

00:38:15.334 --> 00:38:18.042
very dense clouds of compassion in My heart

00:38:18.458 --> 00:38:23.000
when I see their eyes expressing their love for Me.

00:38:23.458 --> 00:38:28.708
Everything, the tears, everything, that’s the face,

00:38:29.125 --> 00:38:34.292
the eyes, the hands, all these belong to Shri Krishna.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.917
So in their behavior, in their talking,

00:38:38.375 --> 00:38:42.042
how they express themselves.

00:38:42.541 --> 00:38:44.250
You can use the same eyes

00:38:44.666 --> 00:38:46.708
for showing your temper and getting angry.

00:38:47.167 --> 00:38:49.958
Many people use eyes for controlling others.

00:38:50.374 --> 00:38:53.833
They’ll put their eyes like this, stare at someone, try to control.

00:38:54.334 --> 00:39:00.541
They may use their eyes also for condemning someone.

00:39:01.042 --> 00:39:05.374
Also sometimes they use, sort of spit at someone

00:39:05.875 --> 00:39:12.000
or try to show the tongue to insult someone.

00:39:12.458 --> 00:39:19.292
So in the behavior also we must have a kind of a sweetness.

00:39:19.708 --> 00:39:22.875
Like when I went to, went to England first,

00:39:23.374 --> 00:39:26.209
I was, you see, I learnt English in My own way.

00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:28.666
But when I went there newly they said,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.084
“Now, if you have to say word like ‘thought’

00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:34.084
you must say ‘thought’.” I said, “What?”

00:39:34.458 --> 00:39:37.792
“You must take out your tongue and say ‘thought’”.

00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:41.625
I said, “Is absurd. Why should you take out your tongue?”

00:39:42.042 --> 00:39:45.167
He said, “Unless and until you take out your tongue like that

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.958
is not something, proper expression.”

00:39:50.375 --> 00:39:52.375
So I said, “This is English. You have developed

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.833
some nonsensical things, to show tongue at it, everyone.”

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.167
Even a child, you know, when he gets angry

00:39:58.500 --> 00:39:59.833
automatically he shows his tongue.

00:40:00.209 --> 00:40:06.292
So you see all these expressions are – and making faces now,

00:40:06.666 --> 00:40:09.833
as they say that ‘stiff upper lip,’ you see.

00:40:10.167 --> 00:40:13.375
You must have heard about that, with a nose like that, you see,

00:40:13.708 --> 00:40:16.833
snooty nose or a face where you just make your faces

00:40:17.292 --> 00:40:23.458
and make a crooked face just to tease someone

00:40:23.917 --> 00:40:28.583
or to make an expression out of your nose.

00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:30.375
Also people do it like this, you see,

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.666
to show as if you are sneezing at that person.

00:40:34.167 --> 00:40:36.708
All these things, expressions, are coming

00:40:37.209 --> 00:40:43.833
out of Shri Krishna’s grace, but the power of that is madhurya,

00:40:44.374 --> 00:40:47.625
is the sweetness, the melodiousness;

00:40:48.125 --> 00:40:54.084
the rapport should be so sweet that that rapport should create

00:40:54.541 --> 00:40:57.708
tremendous joy and tremendous happiness.

00:40:58.125 --> 00:41:02.541
As you have heard the song of Baba Mama’s on My eyes:

00:41:02.958 --> 00:41:07.042
only I looked at him, I say with that glance

00:41:07.375 --> 00:41:10.500
– that generated that beautiful music in him.

00:41:10.958 --> 00:41:14.917
So, as far as possible, as far as possible,

00:41:15.334 --> 00:41:18.833
try to put your eyes on the greenery; that’s the best.

00:41:19.334 --> 00:41:23.750
Then it soothes down and also you develop

00:41:24.209 --> 00:41:26.917
the soothing quality of the greenery.

00:41:27.374 --> 00:41:30.000
I always tell people that “Better see the greenery around,

00:41:30.416 --> 00:41:31.666
how it soothes your eyes.”

00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:35.666
In the same way you should try to soothe

00:41:36.458 --> 00:41:38.917
the other person when you talk to that person.

00:41:39.292 --> 00:41:40.875
The person must melt.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:45.167
Instead of that, if you start arguing and fighting with that person,

00:41:45.583 --> 00:41:46.750
that person will never melt.

00:41:47.084 --> 00:41:51.209
On the contrary, you’ll be adding fire, more fire to that person.

00:41:51.708 --> 00:41:55.541
That was the quality of Shri Krishna, is the madhurya,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.792
and that it is expressed in His lifetime

00:42:01.209 --> 00:42:05.250
how He beautifully managed to say things

00:42:05.625 --> 00:42:11.875
in His own sweetness, specially in His childhood.

00:42:12.666 --> 00:42:16.209
The another quality which Shri Krishna has, which

00:42:16.541 --> 00:42:22.708
we can express through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

00:42:23.042 --> 00:42:25.042
But there are two types of diplomacies:

00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:27.917
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

00:42:28.374 --> 00:42:33.042
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have to take to

00:42:33.416 --> 00:42:37.416
a certain standard or you don’t have to read some books

00:42:37.917 --> 00:42:41.125
to know what is diplomacy.

00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:44.708
Is a genuinely it comes to you.

00:42:45.125 --> 00:42:48.375
It, the whole thing works very sweetly,

00:42:48.833 --> 00:42:51.833
in such a genuine manner.

00:42:52.292 --> 00:42:55.042
I, I have used it many-a-times Myself,

00:42:55.416 --> 00:42:57.875
and you all can use it also many-a-times.

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.292
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry with them;

00:43:01.708 --> 00:43:04.416
not possible if you are angry.

00:43:04.917 --> 00:43:08.875
Now, there’s a story I’ve told you about some,

00:43:09.334 --> 00:43:10.666
this Gagangiri Maharaj.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.084
I went to meet him and he was very angry

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.209
because he could not stop the rain.

00:43:16.708 --> 00:43:18.000
He was supposed to stop the rain.

00:43:18.374 --> 00:43:19.958
And I was all drenched.

00:43:20.334 --> 00:43:22.042
And he was so angry and he said that

00:43:22.374 --> 00:43:24.625
“Is it my ego You are trying to control?”

00:43:24.958 --> 00:43:27.541
and like that he started little bit fighting with Me.

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:29.833
I said, “No, that’s not the reason.”

00:43:30.334 --> 00:43:33.541
He said, “Why? Why did You not allow me to stop the rain?

00:43:33.875 --> 00:43:34.708
You are all drenched.”

00:43:35.042 --> 00:43:37.583
I said, “Because you are a sanyasi

00:43:37.917 --> 00:43:39.209
and you bought a sari for Me.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.374
I would not take a sari from a sanyasi.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.833
So I had to get drenched, for your sake.”

00:43:44.334 --> 00:43:48.792
The whole thing finished off.

00:43:49.375 --> 00:43:52.583
The whole anger, temper, finished off.

00:43:53.125 --> 00:43:55.917
This is how we have to melt people.

00:43:56.375 --> 00:44:01.583
The diplomacy is not convincing anybody

00:44:01.958 --> 00:44:05.750
with his intellect or by temper or anything

00:44:06.167 --> 00:44:12.084
but it is to melt away another person by your goodness,

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.917
by your good words, by your sweet words,

00:44:15.334 --> 00:44:17.167
by your forgiving nature.

00:44:17.583 --> 00:44:22.250
This quality He had and He tried this on many people.

00:44:22.625 --> 00:44:25.374
It worked on some; it did not work on some.

00:44:25.833 --> 00:44:27.375
He didn’t feel it’s a failure.

00:44:27.875 --> 00:44:29.875
It’s the reaction of the another person

00:44:30.292 --> 00:44:32.375
which is important to be seen.

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:36.292
So this quality of Right Vishuddhi you should have,

00:44:36.666 --> 00:44:41.458
is to talk to others and melt them away.

00:44:41.792 --> 00:44:45.917
I hope in America people develop this quality

00:44:46.375 --> 00:44:50.250
and try to improve relations with each other.

00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:53.583
Actually, to talk to they are very sweet, I must say.

00:44:54.042 --> 00:44:55.625
They get very friendly with you.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.625
You give them any number of presents,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.666
they’ll be very happy but they’ll never give you any present.

00:45:01.084 --> 00:45:03.042
You call them for dinner, anything,

00:45:03.458 --> 00:45:06.209
they’ll ten times they will come to your house for dinner

00:45:06.625 --> 00:45:08.541
but they will never call you for dinner.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.416
You see, they are very friendly as long

00:45:11.792 --> 00:45:13.334
as you are doing anything for them.

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:17.292
But when it comes to returning it they find it difficult;

00:45:17.708 --> 00:45:21.292
they don’t do it. So, you see the whole thing amounts

00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:24.917
to be a very sweet exploitation of another person.

00:45:25.416 --> 00:45:28.334
This is what is to be understood that by sweetness

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:32.125
you are not going to exploit anyone but by sweetness

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:36.375
you are going to melt that person and bring him to the level

00:45:36.792 --> 00:45:42.209
that he can understand what is goodness.

00:45:42.875 --> 00:45:45.666
Now, about South America, I’ve already told you

00:45:46.167 --> 00:45:50.750
that they are extremely simple and innocent people.

00:45:51.167 --> 00:45:54.042
They are very poor, simple, innocent,

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.500
but what has entered them into is this black magic,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.792
and which they are now realizing, luckily,

00:46:02.209 --> 00:46:05.000
that this is black magic which is troubling them.

00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:07.917
But somehow they have depended on it so much,

00:46:08.334 --> 00:46:09.416
on the left side.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.042
They feel very guilty about it; they feel very bad.

00:46:12.374 --> 00:46:14.750
All the time you find them absolutely guilty.

00:46:15.209 --> 00:46:16.708
Their whole behavior is that

00:46:17.167 --> 00:46:19.250
as if they have done something wrong

00:46:19.666 --> 00:46:22.541
but they do not know how to correct themselves.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.583
So for us is important not to feel guilty about anything.

00:46:28.042 --> 00:46:30.625
We are all Sahaja yogis.

00:46:31.042 --> 00:46:33.708
How can we have guilt after all, when we are the spirit?

00:46:34.084 --> 00:46:35.833
Spirit cannot have the guilt.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.084
So this guilt has to go away.

00:46:38.458 --> 00:46:43.583
But by guilt what do we do, what we lose is the witness power,

00:46:44.042 --> 00:46:47.125
because when there is a guilt we put it here, the guilt is there.

00:46:47.541 --> 00:46:50.042
But we cannot see.

00:46:50.416 --> 00:46:53.750
We cannot witness what’s wrong

00:46:54.209 --> 00:46:56.167
and we do not want to face the difficulty,

00:46:56.458 --> 00:47:00.374
our mistakes or the difficulty we have.

00:47:00.792 --> 00:47:02.875
Just put it as a guilt here, finished.

00:47:03.209 --> 00:47:05.209
Is stored up there nicely, guilt.

00:47:05.625 --> 00:47:07.292
But we do not want to face it.

00:47:07.666 --> 00:47:11.792
For example a man, say, or a woman is very cruel by nature.

00:47:12.167 --> 00:47:15.708
Then suddenly she realizes that she has been cruel

00:47:16.125 --> 00:47:18.084
or whatever it is. So she puts it down there,

00:47:18.416 --> 00:47:20.292
“Oh, I’ve been very bad. I’ve been very cruel,

00:47:20.625 --> 00:47:24.458
this thing, that thing.” But she doesn’t face it.

00:47:24.833 --> 00:47:27.250
Facing means she should know, “Why was I cruel?

00:47:27.541 --> 00:47:29.708
What was the need for me? I should not have been cruel

00:47:30.125 --> 00:47:33.541
and now I will not be cruel anymore.” That finishes off.

00:47:33.958 --> 00:47:37.500
But, “I’m very guilty about it. I’m very guilty about it,”

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.958
doesn’t help. On the contrary, you know,

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:41.875
what are the problems are of the guilt,

00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:46.583
and the same problems are today faced by South America.

00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:49.958
When I went there I was surprised that in Brazil

00:47:50.375 --> 00:47:55.750
the man who was the topmost there talked to Me in a manner,

00:47:56.167 --> 00:47:58.583
“Oh, we are, we know we have lots of defects.

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:01.084
We know we are no good,” this, that.

00:48:01.541 --> 00:48:04.708
What I just say, why doesn’t he correct?

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.292
If he knows this is the mistake, this is the thing,

00:48:10.666 --> 00:48:12.833
why shouldn’t he correct? Then he told Me that

00:48:13.250 --> 00:48:15.750
“You write to me all the things You found wrong with us.”

00:48:16.209 --> 00:48:17.958
And it was really very sweet of him.

00:48:18.416 --> 00:48:22.000
So then one journalist came and we told him.

00:48:22.334 --> 00:48:24.458
And now I think they are doing something about it.

00:48:24.792 --> 00:48:27.375
They are trying to improve it and things will improve definitely.

00:48:27.875 --> 00:48:32.375
But on the contrary I found that Russia is very different.

00:48:32.708 --> 00:48:35.958
In Russia they never said, “We are guilty,” or anything,

00:48:36.374 --> 00:48:38.917
nothing of the kind. They never said so.

00:48:39.374 --> 00:48:41.209
They said, “That time is over now.

00:48:41.541 --> 00:48:44.792
We are in the kingdom of God. Finished.

00:48:45.167 --> 00:48:49.167
So that is over. We are now in the Kingdom of God

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.209
and we have to enjoy life.” Everything positive.

00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:55.792
Never talked of their past, of their governments

00:48:56.167 --> 00:49:00.708
or this happened, or Stalin or Lenin or anyone.

00:49:01.167 --> 00:49:04.250
They were not concerned. They were above it.

00:49:04.666 --> 00:49:06.958
“So why should we worry?” They said, “Why should we worry?

00:49:07.292 --> 00:49:08.792
Let them fight. Let them do what they like.”

00:49:09.209 --> 00:49:11.833
They don’t want to know anything about their politics,

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.167
about their problems or anything.

00:49:15.583 --> 00:49:17.375
They think, “Our problems are solved.

00:49:17.792 --> 00:49:19.541
We are now realized souls.

00:49:19.958 --> 00:49:22.750
We are enjoying ourselves. Let us enjoy.”

00:49:23.167 --> 00:49:26.375
Very straight-forward way of understanding Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:26.875 --> 00:49:28.833
But I’ve seen people, they write to Me

00:49:29.209 --> 00:49:31.625
ten pages of their confessions as if I am a priest,

00:49:32.042 --> 00:49:35.375
Catholic priest, you see, all about their, what they have done,

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.833
this they have done, and I don’t want to read it.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.958
Just throw it or I burn it off.

00:49:41.416 --> 00:49:43.917
So they try to confess. There’s no need to confess.

00:49:44.375 --> 00:49:48.084
There’s nothing to say. And not to dwell upon

00:49:48.375 --> 00:49:51.625
what wrongs you have done, but now enjoy what you have got it.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.583
It’s like this: supposing a beggar is made a king, all right?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.374
Then he should enjoy his kingdom, should behave like a king.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:01.708
But still he remembers his past more,

00:50:02.125 --> 00:50:03.666
so anybody who passes by he says,

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
“Give me five rupees or five pounds.” It’s like that.

00:50:08.375 --> 00:50:10.374
Once you are in the Kingdom of God,

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.833
know that you are in the Kingdom of God.

00:50:13.292 --> 00:50:18.125
But this black magic business is very, very dangerous

00:50:18.541 --> 00:50:20.209
and it can act through anyone.

00:50:20.541 --> 00:50:23.541
It can act through your relations, act through your friends,

00:50:23.917 --> 00:50:25.250
act through anyone.

00:50:25.541 --> 00:50:28.833
So one has to be very careful that you do not become,

00:50:29.209 --> 00:50:32.084
because of your guilt business or whatever it is,

00:50:32.541 --> 00:50:36.167
you become vulnerable to black magic.

00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:39.250
It can ruin you. It can ruin your families.

00:50:39.666 --> 00:50:42.583
Even if you are a Sahaja yogi it can ruin you.

00:50:43.125 --> 00:50:46.666
So this guilt business has to be given up completely.

00:50:47.084 --> 00:50:49.583
You should not be guilty. Guilt is put into you.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.666
Somebody can say, “Oh you are so bad.

00:50:52.084 --> 00:50:54.958
You didn’t do this for me. You didn’t do that,”

00:50:55.292 --> 00:50:57.209
or something like that. They put ideas.

00:50:57.583 --> 00:50:59.875
Then you start feeling, “Oh, I should have done this for them.

00:51:00.167 --> 00:51:03.125
I should have. It was wrong on my part,” or something,

00:51:03.416 --> 00:51:04.375
and then the guilt starts.

00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:06.541
Instead of doing something for that person

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.833
or instead of understanding that this all nonsense,

00:51:10.292 --> 00:51:13.374
they go on brooding on that, brooding and then suddenly

00:51:13.708 --> 00:51:19.625
they find they are in the trouble of getting possessed

00:51:20.042 --> 00:51:22.792
or being affected by black magic.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:26.958
So one has to forget it and get into the atmosphere

00:51:27.374 --> 00:51:32.375
where you know that you are now in the kingdom of God.

00:51:32.917 --> 00:51:36.458
For Shri Krishna, whatever is to be said is less than

00:51:36.875 --> 00:51:38.958
what He’s said always, I always feel,

00:51:39.375 --> 00:51:46.375
and that His main work is through our brain.

00:51:46.875 --> 00:51:50.917
That is Virata. He works through our brain.

00:51:51.416 --> 00:51:53.666
And as Shiva works through our heart,

00:51:54.042 --> 00:51:55.875
He works through our brain.

00:51:56.374 --> 00:52:01.958
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,

00:52:02.374 --> 00:52:05.958
all the subtleties of the brain and the knowledge

00:52:06.458 --> 00:52:10.084
starts manifesting and expressing itself.

00:52:10.458 --> 00:52:12.334
But the greatest thing that happens,

00:52:12.666 --> 00:52:14.541
that integration takes place in your brain.

00:52:14.958 --> 00:52:16.833
It’s not that your heart wants one thing

00:52:17.292 --> 00:52:19.167
and your brain wants another thing.

00:52:19.583 --> 00:52:21.000
The integration takes place.

00:52:21.334 --> 00:52:22.917
And when that integration takes place

00:52:23.334 --> 00:52:26.583
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

00:52:27.042 --> 00:52:31.374
Even without thinking about it, without reading about it,

00:52:31.708 --> 00:52:33.666
you just become dharmic.

00:52:34.042 --> 00:52:36.000
You are not to be told that you have to be dharmic.

00:52:36.375 --> 00:52:39.583
Innately you become dharmic because your brain,

00:52:40.042 --> 00:52:44.209
which normally is used for rationality,

00:52:44.666 --> 00:52:46.541
for justifying all that is wrong,

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.292
becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

00:52:51.666 --> 00:52:55.167
This is the greatest thing that Shri Krishna does to you

00:52:55.583 --> 00:53:00.458
is to make your brain, brain itself dharmic.

00:53:00.917 --> 00:53:10.000
It becomes a vehicle of understanding Dharma,

00:53:10.833 --> 00:53:20.209
of leading a dharmic life and of standing firmly on Dharma.

00:53:20.666 --> 00:53:27.250
It’s the brain; it is the brain which really,

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:33.750
mostly, takes you away from Dharma, apart from black magic.

00:53:34.334 --> 00:53:39.042
But once your Sahasrara is opened out,

00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:45.042
Virata is expressed.

00:53:45.458 --> 00:53:47.625
Then you are amazed at yourself.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.375
The one who was indulging into everything thinking,

00:53:50.708 --> 00:53:53.375
“This is pleasure. This is my right. I should have done it.

00:53:53.833 --> 00:53:55.458
Who else can tell me?” and all that,

00:53:55.792 --> 00:53:58.750
suddenly you become a prophet.

00:53:59.167 --> 00:54:02.334
This is the greatest blessing of Shri Krishna

00:54:02.666 --> 00:54:07.875
that He is Virat, and the Virat is your brain,

00:54:08.374 --> 00:54:12.458
and the brain of God Almighty is Virat.

00:54:12.917 --> 00:54:15.500
So this is what one has to realize,

00:54:15.875 --> 00:54:19.374
that after realization a person gets ideas

00:54:19.708 --> 00:54:23.334
which are always constructive, and if they are not,

00:54:23.583 --> 00:54:25.334
then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

00:54:25.792 --> 00:54:30.084
Constructive and dharmic, that is very, very important

00:54:30.458 --> 00:54:35.334
for us to understand, where is our mind going?

00:54:35.792 --> 00:54:42.625
Is it contradicting, it is telling something else than what it is?

00:54:43.292 --> 00:54:47.792
We have to just keep a watch and you’ll be amazed to see

00:54:48.167 --> 00:54:52.167
how your brain has changed its ways.

00:54:52.666 --> 00:54:56.250
The upside brain has become normal.

00:54:56.666 --> 00:55:03.374
This you can get very easily if you just meditate

00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:09.833
every day and see for yourself how the expression

00:55:10.292 --> 00:55:15.458
of your Sahasrara is penetrating into your being

00:55:15.917 --> 00:55:18.917
and is acting in your life.

00:55:19.334 --> 00:55:23.125
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

00:55:23.583 --> 00:55:27.583
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,

00:55:27.958 --> 00:55:30.292
and others will never doubt you.

00:55:30.583 --> 00:55:32.875
May God bless you.
