1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,160
Attachment to money, attachment to people, attachment to this

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,160
is nothing but a hook which hooks you to baser levels.

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,720
You have to rise above,

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,640
and then you really enjoy the beauty of richness.

5
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,960
As I told you the other day, I see all beautiful things.

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,680
It's nice I don't possess them.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,480
See now these carpets are spread here.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,880
If they were Mine, I should worry, “Oh God, now

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,640
I hope they are not going to be spoilt.

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,760
I hope nobody sits on them.

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,720
I hope they are insured, so nobody runs away with that.”

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,360
But when they don't belong to Me, I'm enjoying them better.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,080
Other people's things is a better idea.

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,040
This myth carries us to such an extent of stupidity

15
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,800
that sometimes I feel whether these human beings are human beings,

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,680
or they are their possessions.

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,760
Their Spirit is lost,

18
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,040
everything is lost, they're not bothered.

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,880
But if their little position is lost, they weep and wail,

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,160
as if they are dead, their forefathers are dead hundred times.

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,800
But people like Me are just batchas, emperors.

22
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:53,440
They are not bothered. To them comfort cannot capture,

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,960
they don’t need any comfort. If you have comfort

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,440
it crawls upon you, it makes you a slave, too.

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,320
If you seek comfort you are in for enslavement,

26
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,040
take it from Me. Any kind of comfort.

27
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,480
It's only human beings who can become really so crazy.

28
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,200
No animal can become. There is another type of a comfort,

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,680
is that a mental idea

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,320
that everybody must appreciate,

31
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,040
and that you should be able to overpower others.

32
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,160
This also comes I think from Nabhi Chakra.

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,960
Is a kind of a feeling

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,560
that you should be able to overpower many people,

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,880
they should look at you.

36
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,360
These days in London there are women who are suffering from

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,760
a funny disease called anorexia, where they just don't eat.

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,480
Women just don't eat because they should be thin and skinny.

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,440
For what? For what you should be thin and skinny?

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,480
Because you look attractive, but for what?

41
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,600
I don't think skinny people look attractive by any chance.

42
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,720
Horrible they are. They create only pity

43
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,800
and you feel you know repulsive about the whole stuff.

44
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,320
Once a beauty queen came to see Me.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,000
I thought she was a T.B. patient.

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
And I said, “You look all right but

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
it seems you are a T.B. patient.”

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,600
She said, “No Mother, I've got a beauty prize.” “Yes?

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,320
Who were the people? Doctors must have given it

50
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
because they want some patients there.”

51
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,360
This is the trouble,

52
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,320
we go out of the way to trouble our Nabhi,

53
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,520
not to eat your food, fasting.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,520
If you want to fast this life, next life you will not have any food.

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,640
Thank you very much. No food.

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,240
Fasting? All right,

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,000
you’ll have a permanent fasting. What do you say?

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,400
You don't have to do any fasting. Why do you want to fast?

59
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,480
And even if you want to fast

60
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,400
because you want to change the timing or maybe

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,160
for your health's sake, it's all right.

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,240
But why in the name of God you want to malign Me?

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,240
You have got everything to eat and you don’t want to eat.

64
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
Those who have got food to eat, they don’t want to eat.

65
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,960
Next life they become poor and then they blame the rich.

66
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,880
But in last life you'd been wanted to fast,

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,600
so this life you are not given any food, because you asked for it.

68
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
And that is how also the Nabhi Chakra gets you twisted,

69
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,720
when you fast like mad.

70
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,880
There is no need to fast in the name of God.

71
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,440
God has given you all the wealth, all the beauty,

72
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,160
all the love. Actually in Sahaja Yoga

73
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,680
if you fast in My name, I think it's horrible

74
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,040
because if you want to trouble your Mother

75
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,160
or to make Her uneasy, or to take a revenge on Her,

76
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,280
then you say, “Mother, I'm not going to eat my food.”

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Then Mother is finished. That's the best way to conquer Her.

78
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,360
To say, “Mother I'm not going to eat my food.”

79
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,640
So this kind of a mad fasting

80
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
is also very bad for your Nabhi and when you do that

81
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,800
then you have a problem because you are invaded

82
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,800
by your left-sided, what you call, beyond

83
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,800
the Ida Nadi, you have the collective subconscious;

84
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,440
and you are invaded by them.

85
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,800
And you are in for trouble, physically, mentally, emotionally.

86
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,560
And mostly those people who fast are very hot tempered.

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,760
The day they are fasting day is there, never go near them.

88
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,200
Because they are already planning what they are going to eat.

89
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,400
And in the morning they plan and they don't get it,

90
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,080
so they are very angry for that part.

91
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,120
All these asahaja things are not going to help you.

92
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,680
You have to be normal people.

93
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,240
You don't have to put up into tension yourself for Sahaja Yoga,

94
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,680
Nothing. Be normal. Be nice people.

95
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,480
Don't torture yourself.

96
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,480
That is one point on the Nabhi on the left hand side

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,960
and on the right hand side: don't get into indulgences.

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Don't pamper yourself.

99
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,600
Both things are the same for Sahaja Yoga.

100
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,160
Whether you starve or you overeat, is the same.

101
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,800
There is no difference between the two,

102
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,560
because if you are not on the seat,

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
whether you are on the left

104
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,480
falling on the right, does it make any difference?

105
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,880
So to be on the seat is to be

106
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,480
in the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

107
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,680
And I have described to you how Shri Lakshmi is a lady

108
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,720
and in Her left hand She has got two lotuses and the right,

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,160
one lotus, and right hand another lotus on top, which shows a person

110
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,720
who is balancing. She’s balancing on a lotus.

111
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,280
Imagine. She’s standing on a lotus. That means She is balancing.

112
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,320
And She’s balancing, She’s standing there

113
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,440
and She is holding two lotuses in Her hand showing

114
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,040
that She’s like a lotus.

115
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,360
A person who is a rich man, Lakshmi Pati,

116
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,440
has to be like a lotus, warm, pink, warm.

117
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,240
And even a horrible thing, like

118
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,320
wasp-like thing. I don’t know what you call it in English,

119
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,120
you don’t have that black thing.

120
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,120
We have a very black wasp, you see, which is hard,

121
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,840
hard like nut and has angular thorny legs.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,200
That black thing comes in

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,600
and is good for nothing, but it comes in

124
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,160
for the residence, for the ashraya,

125
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,320
the lotus keeps it

126
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,960
on top of it’s corolla, which is a very, very soft thing,

127
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,640
with all love.

128
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,880
And in the night it closes down so that

129
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,040
the poor insect who is just like a nut

130
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,040
should not get any trouble from the outside weather.

131
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,280
Like a mother who takes the child in the armchair,

132
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,960
that love should be there for a Lakshmi Pati.

133
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,240
How many are Lakshmi Pati’s like that? Have you seen any?

134
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,160
If they see somebody who is coming with money propositions,

135
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
then they may open their doors.

136
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,920
Otherwise, they have no love for anybody.

137
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,720
For those who come for their ashrayas, for their help,

138
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,480
they are not there.

139
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,600
On the other side are the people

140
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:42,560
who are so repulsive. They are not like lotus.

141
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,640
There is no fragrance. They are such miserly people

142
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,200
that they stink of miserliness.

143
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,040
While the lotus gives its fragrance

144
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,440
through that mud, to that horrible thing

145
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,440
that even the little worms which crawl upon

146
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,560
those lotus petals smell of this beautiful fragrance.

147
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,360
This is what it has to be. It has to give.

148
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,560
It has to be beautiful. It has to be cozy.

149
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,880
It has to be welcoming.

150
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,360
Then another hand is giving.

151
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,280
The Lakshmi is always giving. She doesn’t receive;

152
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,160
She just gives.

153
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,120
If you are really a Lakshmi Pati

154
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,240
you don’t want to have anything from anyone. You don’t receive.

155
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,680
If you are really rich, who can enrich you more?

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,240
What can you give to a person who is fully rich? There is no

157
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,520
way of entering into it now it’s all up to the brim.

158
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,120
He’s rich up to the brim. Then what will you give?

159
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,040
You cannot give anything.

160
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
But where you have to give means that he’s a beggar –

161
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,840
he’s still a beggar.

162
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,880
All of these so-called rich people who still are hankering money

163
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,160
are still beggars, they are not rich.

164
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,760
They may think themselves. Empty vessels, but they are not rich

165
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,280
because they are still expecting money.

166
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,680
So, it is important that we should understand,

167
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,440
the money is not the way.

168
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,800
Money takes us away from dharma.

169
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,560
It takes us away from God. It takes us away from reality.

170
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,080
It covers our eyes. We don’t think

171
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,480
that we have to follow a path of righteousness and of virtue

172
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,400
because we think we are rich, God is going to be afraid of us.

173
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880
We can even purchase Him and can

174
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
manage Him by giving some bribes.

175
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,640
That’s not so.

176
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,520
You must face yourself. You have to face yourself.

177
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,240
That it’s not the money that’s going to give you that elation,

178
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:22,200
that higher life, but it is the love of God,

179
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,640
the honesty of seeking, honesty.

180
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,320
That is the quality of this chakra is the Satya,

181
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,640
Vishnu, is the Satya.

182
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
He’s the Narayana. Narayana means Satya.

183
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,520
So there cannot be Satya Narayan, isn’t it?

184
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,880
Narayan is Satya, then how can there be Satya Narayan?

185
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,200
But we have many Satya Narayana Pujas.

186
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,000
For all these Satya Narayanas, Sahaja Yogis are not supposed to go.

187
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,880
They can only go to Narayana Puja

188
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,760
because Satya Narayana is that path which is added to it

189
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,480
for camouflaging, is meant for these

190
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,680
horrible Brahmins who make you pay. For what?

191
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,480
Sahaja Yogis are not allowed to go to Satya Narayana Puja.

192
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,120
They can have Narayana Puja.

193
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,440
And what is Narayana ultimately becomes?

194
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,640
In the Nabhi Chakra

195
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:32,280
Narayana existed since He was created by the Devi.

196
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,880
And It looks after

197
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,040
the seeking, the nourishing of the seeking like a father,

198
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,840
and then It incarnates again and then It incarnates again

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,520
to help our seeking to a higher position and a higher position

200
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:59,120
till it reaches a point where you start seeking God Almighty.

201
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,560
Then you jump into the Shakti of Mahalakshmi.

202
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,280
Then you are in the hands of Mahalakshmi Shakti.

203
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,320
Means Lakshmi evolves into Mahalakshmi principle.

204
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,760
Now this Mahalakshmi principle resides

205
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,000
in the central path of Sushumna.

206
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:35,360
And this central path of Sushumna is to be established fully

207
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,040
and awakened when the Kundalini rises.

208
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,320
When the Kundalini does not rise,

209
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,760
this path is kept absolutely black.

210
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,720
It is absolutely black, there is nothing in it

211
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,480
except for the deities

212
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:58,200
who are lying without any light.

213
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,840
When the Kundalini rises, then only these deities get awakened

214
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,720
and when they get awakened this Sushumna path,

215
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:15,320
this central path of Mahalakshmi starts acting

216
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:21,400
as the balancing power, to begin with at the Nabhi chakra.
