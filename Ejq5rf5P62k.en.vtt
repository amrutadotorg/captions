00:00:01.417 --> 00:00:03.959
Oh! Very beautiful.
Who's done it?

00:00:09.417 --> 00:00:11.208
You did?

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:17.458
Very good,very beautiful,
absolutely good.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:25.500
Everything.

00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:32.875
What's her name?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.583
Sue Williams.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.417
Thank you very much,
very beautifully done.

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:02.792
You can't move further?

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:06.667
You are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:12.291
and there should not be
controversy between you.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:20.417
You should all think of
the same thing, isn't it?

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:26.417
I feel sorry so many
standing outside.

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:29.333
Come in, come in!

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:34.041
Can you move
the piano behind?

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:44.500
You are from Como?

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:47.333
See! He could come!

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:13.542
I'm happy to see all of you here.

00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:18.875
May God bless you.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.208
You are so many.

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.834
And you can afford to have a hall,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.333
all of you sitting there,

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:32.999
and I feeling comfortable.

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:41.500
After all, you are
all Sahaja Yogis,

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:44.542
all brothers and sisters.

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:51.959
and you don't mind
any inconvenience,

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:55.333
but if we can make
something convenient,

00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:57.583
we should do it.

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:11.583
No,no, I have no trouble, I have
come all the way from India!

00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:26.125
For My convenience you

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.125
take no such a note.

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:34.166
See, wherever you are, wherever
you have the programme,

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:36.709
I'll go there.

00:03:36.917 --> 00:03:40.834
As long as possible
I will definitely go.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.375
These days, life is much
more comfortable

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:01.542
but when I was working
in the villages.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.500
I used to go on
the bullock cart.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.583
You've got photograph,
you can see

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.792
- on the bullock cart to go
for miles together.

00:04:15.917 --> 00:04:18.250
I knew I had to
do all that.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:23.125
If I have to get Sahaja Yogis,
I have to work that way.

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:26.959
And I was
quite prepared.

00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:30.709
I never felt any
exhaustion

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:34.500
with it, never.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:39.917
On the contrary, after I meet
you all I feel so happy.

00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:50.375
Now, is there somebody
who has problems?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.542
Anybody -  who
has problems...

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:05.875
Alcohol, drinking,
alcohol.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.125
They are not in
Sahaja Yoga? - No.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.166
Why not? You are
the mother?

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:19.458
Yes...and
my husband.

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:21.542
How about
the children?

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.750
I have two
children with him.

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:26.999
The children are...are they
Sahaja Yogis your children?

00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.125
Not, the two older
children not.

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.750
How many children
you have? - Four.

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:33.291
Four children,
four children

00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:35.709
They are not
Sahaja Yogis?

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:39.583
Only my two
young ones.

00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:44.166
Two young children in Sahaja Yoga and the
two older ones are not in Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:46.542
husband is not
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:50.041
Surprising.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:02.166
But here the family system is
good compared to, say, in England,

00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:07.834
where the family breaks
after some time.

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:11.834
At least here,
is much better.

00:06:27.125 --> 00:06:30.333
Shri Mataji, we in America
have a problem,

00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:33.250
that the seekers don't
stay in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:39.917
The seekers take their
realisation in America, and they don't stay in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:41.375
This is our problem.

00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:45.250
They don't stay.
Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:48.917
Why?
I don't know Shri Mataji.

00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:52.208
It's not complete.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.125
If they have a complete
realisation,

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:01.917
they will
have to come.

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:08.000
They are not complete.
Just half way.

00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:16.291
They drink? Yes, Shri Mataji.
- That's the point.

00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:21.709
After coming to Sahaja Yoga
you cannot drink

00:07:21.875 --> 00:07:22.792
Yes, Shri Mataji

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:28.250
And that must be the reason
they don't want to come.

00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:33.917
But you give them bandhans.
And beat them with shoes.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:41.458
Who are those...
your mother, father?

00:07:41.834 --> 00:07:44.667
My mother, my father,
yes. My good friends

00:07:46.166 --> 00:07:50.125
- they take realisation but they
don't stay as Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:53.166
Because they drink.
- Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:07:56.333 --> 00:07:58.000
See now

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:07.375
all your countries have
indulged into drinking.

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:13.250
All over Europe, you see,
and it's a little fight,

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.500
because for them
drinking is their life.

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:20.959
We have to give
them bandhans.

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:28.709
If you give them bandhans,
all of you put together

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.000
then they cannot
run away.

00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:35.875
Bandhan has
to be given.

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:39.750
All of you should
give bandhan.

00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:53.041
That's how they have
worked out in India.

00:08:53.999 --> 00:08:59.208
And India is, you know, how
Sahaja Yoga is strong there.

00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:02.291
The reason is
if they find

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:06.750
parents are not coming, or maybe children
are not coming or whatever it is,

00:09:07.542 --> 00:09:10.000
they all work it out

00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:14.000
by giving them
bandhans.

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:21.875
But first thing, you should
regularly come to SahajaYoga.

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:25.500
Regularly.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.542
It is not half way,

00:09:28.999 --> 00:09:32.333
like today you come and
then you don't come.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.291
That's not proper.

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:39.041
That's - you
cannot progress.

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:45.208
You have to come
to the programmes,

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:48.166
all of you, regularly.

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:50.875
Because you know,

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:54.917
realisation is
not easy thing.

00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:57.959
Nobody had it
before.

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:01.166
Now you have got it.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:05.250
So you have to maintain
it and keep it up.

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:08.750
Once you start
developing that

00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:13.458
the female of
the house also changes.

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:17.375
Greatest problem
of Europe is

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.583
- real problem, that
they drink.

00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:25.500
Drinking is the
main problem.

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:29.542
And that's why they don't want
to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.041
But they can give their
parents, but not Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:39.041
This is the trouble
with them.

00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:48.125
Parents can be given up, in case they
do not take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:49.417 --> 00:10:51.875
You should show
you don't like it.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.583
Why don't they
want Sahaja Yoga

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:02.375
Because they drink, Shri Mataji.
Ah? - Because they drink.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.333
Now this is the curse of
Europe, that they all drink.

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:13.834
And drinking is something
very difficult.

00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:17.375
They can't give it up, poor
things, they are slaves.

00:11:18.166 --> 00:11:19.999
Slaves of drinking.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.166
So by your behaviour, and
by your affection,

00:11:26.834 --> 00:11:29.583
I'm sure you can
win them over.

00:11:30.542 --> 00:11:34.125
What's the use - people who
drink die so early?

00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:38.999
You must have heard that
they die very fast.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:44.417
But despite that they don't realise
that one should not drink.

00:11:44.792 --> 00:11:50.125
Because it has become an open
market now for people.

00:11:49.999 --> 00:11:53.542
This is the biggest
problem of Europe.

00:11:54.291 --> 00:11:59.041
But do you know it is
much worse in America.

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:08.125
America's problem
is so funny

00:12:08.542 --> 00:12:12.583
that people who
do Sahaja Yoga

00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:16.375
cannot convince
their parents.

00:12:17.583 --> 00:12:20.959
And they think
they have freedom

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.542
to do whatever
they like.

00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:30.333
And some of the Sahaja Yogis have lost
their parents at a very early age.

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:33.875
Very early age.

00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:37.458
Also they have parents

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:42.583
who had heart...
heart attacks.

00:12:43.999 --> 00:12:45.583
All kinds of attacks.

00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:49.667
Not only heart but any
other disease they get.

00:12:50.041 --> 00:12:52.250
It's very funny,

00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:58.875
which they don't understand how
important it is to get realisation.

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:03.458
So you should try
to talk to them,

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:06.667
that "what is the aim
of your life."

00:13:07.959 --> 00:13:12.375
You must ask them: "What
is the aim of your life?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.583
You want to die or you
want to live?" - First question.

00:13:19.625 --> 00:13:22.375
If they say they want
to die, let them die.

00:13:22.709 --> 00:13:28.417
You should say: "Should we supply with
some wines for you when you die?"

00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:31.208
Make fun of it.

00:13:33.792 --> 00:13:35.542
Make a fun.

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:40.542
So they will realise  that they
are stupid, who are drinking,

00:13:40.999 --> 00:13:43.000
and they are slaves.

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:45.834
Slaves of drinking.

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:51.125
They are not drinking because
they are free people.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.125
Because they
drink, they die.

00:13:56.999 --> 00:13:58.959
And die very fast.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.834
The complication of the
societies is so much.

00:14:05.125 --> 00:14:10.417
That I have seen people who were
rich, who had nice children,

00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:14.542
but they have lost
their parenthood.

00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:20.291
They have lost the children, and
they have no money also. They are on the street.

00:14:24.542 --> 00:14:29.041
Drinking is the best way
to waste all your money.

00:14:32.458 --> 00:14:35.000
They think then when
you say "don't drink",

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:38.959
you are interested in
their money, maybe.

00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:44.125
God knows what they think because I don't
understand the psychology of people

00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:46.250
who drink.

00:14:47.166 --> 00:14:49.709
There are some
bhoots I think

00:14:49.999 --> 00:14:52.583
who give them
ideas like this.

00:14:53.166 --> 00:14:55.750
And they cannot
give up drinking.

00:14:57.375 --> 00:14:58.999
Very wrong.

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:03.750
Where - in what book,

00:15:04.834 --> 00:15:07.875
I mean like Bible or
any book is said,

00:15:08.458 --> 00:15:10.583
that drinking is good?

00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:14.750
Did Christ drink?

00:15:15.917 --> 00:15:19.500
They will follow
Christianity.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.208
they will follow
Christianity.

00:15:25.166 --> 00:15:27.667
and not follow Christ.

00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:30.500
It's like that.

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:35.417
Christ never drank. His
parents didn't drink.

00:15:35.834 --> 00:15:39.667
Now what makes them think
that they have a right to drink?

00:15:43.917 --> 00:15:46.166
Specially for Christians.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.417
Stupid they are if they think
that drinking is their right.

00:15:53.291 --> 00:15:57.000
And then they have
problems with drinking.

00:15:58.208 --> 00:16:01.667
Perhaps you know what
problems there are.

00:16:02.417 --> 00:16:06.667
You can find out what happens
when people are drunk.

00:16:07.125 --> 00:16:10.667
What happens to them,
where do they go,

00:16:11.583 --> 00:16:13.750
what is their position.

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:18.917
You can find out
their friends,

00:16:19.333 --> 00:16:24.333
where are they, what they are
doing, how are they living.

00:16:25.834 --> 00:16:31.125
You'll be amazed, that they are
already on their way out.

00:16:35.041 --> 00:16:39.291
If you show your wisdom to
them, with assertion,

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.125
they will be
coming around.

00:16:44.583 --> 00:16:49.000
You have to tell them.There's nothing
to feel shy about it.

00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:54.750
You have to tell them what
happens with drinking.

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:58.041
What is so great
about it?

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.917
Europe problem
is drinking - first.

00:17:06.917 --> 00:17:11.041
The second problem
is parenthood.

00:17:12.333 --> 00:17:16.458
Parents don't understand the
responsibility of their children,

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:22.709
that all their lives they are going
to be children of yours.

00:17:23.792 --> 00:17:26.125
And you have to
look after them.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.542
There is no way
of getting it out.

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:34.000
First of all why should
you have children?

00:17:34.542 --> 00:17:40.166
And if you have children, you have
to jolly well look after them.

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:46.041
But I have seen that in Europe
people are really stupid.

00:17:48.041 --> 00:17:50.917
They don't understand
this simple fact,

00:17:51.999 --> 00:17:55.750
that if we cannot look
after ourselves,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.625
who will look after
our children?

00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:03.458
Very irresponsible.

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:09.166
Also the society is such, that
in the society also,

00:18:09.709 --> 00:18:14.250
they just believe in drinking.
All of them.

00:18:17.125 --> 00:18:20.375
Indians who do
not drink in India,

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:23.333
- here they come
and drink.

00:18:25.125 --> 00:18:27.041
When they come here

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.709
then they think it is something
ideal, and they drink.

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:36.375
I have known many like
that who came abroad

00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:38.959
and started drinking.

00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:42.917
So this is the big problem.

00:18:43.709 --> 00:18:47.875
You should openly talk
about it, to everyone

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.834
That what is drinking
is stupidity

00:18:52.333 --> 00:18:57.917
- to become stupid,
by paying for it.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:04.500
Huh! You have to pay, and
you have to become mad.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.333
Just imagine.

00:19:07.875 --> 00:19:12.999
If you make fun of it, and if
you can tell them the truth

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:19.250
I am sure they are all with the
intelligence, they will understand.

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:22.291
But you should all
the time tell them.

00:19:27.959 --> 00:19:30.667
The third problem is
that here it is

00:19:30.959 --> 00:19:36.000
till you are an adult
you are away and free.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.375
But I can't understand

00:19:40.709 --> 00:19:44.792
- you are born
from your parents

00:19:45.542 --> 00:19:48.166
and how do you become
free after eighteen years

00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:52.208
or whatever age it is.

00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:54.458
How can that be?

00:19:57.250 --> 00:20:00.875
It's like a tree
producing fruits

00:20:01.208 --> 00:20:04.375
and the people take away
their fruits and eat it.

00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:09.542
We are not trees. We
are human beings

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.250
We can't behave like trees

00:20:14.542 --> 00:20:16.999
which do not show
any interest

00:20:17.542 --> 00:20:20.375
in their children
after

00:20:20.917 --> 00:20:24.875
certain cutting
has happened.

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.375
But it's very
surprising.

00:20:29.792 --> 00:20:34.500
See, for us Indians it's
absolutely surprising

00:20:34.959 --> 00:20:38.041
that they can forget about
their own children?

00:20:38.834 --> 00:20:40.500
How can
they do it?

00:20:42.291 --> 00:20:45.709
You have got writers who
have written stories

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:48.875
and they have written
so many things here,

00:20:49.375 --> 00:20:52.959
that how can parents
be stupid like that?

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:56.250
Whatever may be

00:20:56.583 --> 00:20:59.041
- whatever may be
your father or mother

00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:02.542
- they may be poor or
rich, whatever it is

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:05.458
- they are
your parents!

00:21:06.041 --> 00:21:09.291
And parents are there
to look after you.

00:21:10.417 --> 00:21:15.583
The stupid thing is that they make
the child look after themselves

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.458
When he is eighteen years
of old, he earns of his own

00:21:21.834 --> 00:21:24.500
and the parents:
"Alright, go ahead."

00:21:25.792 --> 00:21:28.542
They want to shirk all
the responsibility.

00:21:29.542 --> 00:21:31.500
Never heard of
such a thing.

00:21:31.709 --> 00:21:35.458
This is a very
recent fashion

00:21:40.291 --> 00:21:45.250
When Abraham Lincoln was
there, did it happen like that?

00:21:52.709 --> 00:21:55.291
Did it happen
with Christ

00:21:56.583 --> 00:22:02.333
that Mother gave him up and said:"Alright,
go ahead and get yourself crucified!"

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.125
How can parents
behave like this?

00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:13.000
They have no heart?

00:22:15.375 --> 00:22:18.542
That they have no love
for their own children?

00:22:22.041 --> 00:22:24.250
India may not
be that rich,

00:22:24.458 --> 00:22:28.750
but people are loving
their children

00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:39.291
Children also here do
not listen to their parents,

00:22:40.166 --> 00:22:42.583
because parents don't
look after them.

00:22:43.583 --> 00:22:47.709
Can you imagine
a society

00:22:48.417 --> 00:22:51.166
religion, or whatever
you may call

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.834
-  people have no connection
with each other.

00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:02.041
But in Sahaja Yoga we
are all connected.

00:23:02.792 --> 00:23:04.583
We are all one.

00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:07.959
And we want to
be together

00:23:08.792 --> 00:23:13.667
with all our so-called
differences

00:23:14.999 --> 00:23:16.792
We are Indians,

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:21.792
we are Africans,
we are English

00:23:23.208 --> 00:23:26.375
but we are
all Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:30.375
And this is what you
have to tell them,

00:23:30.667 --> 00:23:33.458
that what kind of
friends you have.

00:23:33.709 --> 00:23:37.166
They just come here for
drinking and go away.

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:40.125
They'll not even
stand by you.

00:23:40.792 --> 00:23:44.542
But our friends are
our dear friends.

00:23:47.834 --> 00:23:52.417
Sahaja Yogis sometimes make
mistakes, doesn't matter.

00:23:52.999 --> 00:23:58.542
But they are Sahaja Yogis, and they are
one and they help each other.

00:23:59.875 --> 00:24:03.458
See how many countries have
come together in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:07.125
and they have such
friendship with each other,

00:24:07.875 --> 00:24:10.999
that you may not
have with the people

00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:14.999
who are born on the
same side of the Earth.

00:24:16.709 --> 00:24:21.834
You won't recognize
each other.It's horrible.

00:24:22.792 --> 00:24:26.875
I tell you I am sometimes
surprised the way

00:24:27.208 --> 00:24:30.333
parents don't think much
of their parents.

00:24:31.417 --> 00:24:35.583
Parents do not think
that they are parents,

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:39.583
and the children
don't think

00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:44.542
that we are children
of these parents.

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:48.208
I don't know what
has done that

00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:53.166
It's the money as they say, it's
the money, money they earn.

00:24:53.458 --> 00:24:58.166
Alright, so what do you do with
that money, make yourself miserable

00:24:58.542 --> 00:25:01.291
and make everyone
miserable?

00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:05.667
You don't even respect money,
because when you drink

00:25:05.917 --> 00:25:08.041
how much money
you waste?

00:25:09.917 --> 00:25:12.834
Does it go for
any help?

00:25:15.041 --> 00:25:20.208
Then drinking, it's - here,
I was surprised

00:25:22.999 --> 00:25:27.959
many have given up, luckily
have given up, and are happy.

00:25:29.291 --> 00:25:32.750
It's one thing,
that in Europe

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.166
drinking is a big
social event

00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:43.458
and everybody thinks they must
drink otherwise they are not human beings.

00:25:45.166 --> 00:25:49.750
They have to become mad,
otherwise they are not.

00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:56.542
Now the parents will understand
if you join together

00:25:57.583 --> 00:26:01.709
You can bring them round, there are
people who have done like that.

00:26:02.999 --> 00:26:05.250
All the Sahaja
Yogis together

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.834
have managed to bring the whole
Johnnies to Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:14.542 --> 00:26:17.125
When they will see
that you are happy,

00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:22.583
you don't tell lies, and you are
honest, and you are humble

00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:26.792
- what more do
you want?

00:26:30.583 --> 00:26:32.709
But they will
go to church,

00:26:33.041 --> 00:26:36.959
call themselves Christians,
and behave like Satan.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:41.917
See their behaviour.

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:44.500
They don't even care
for their children

00:26:44.667 --> 00:26:47.834
because they have certain
habits they have developed.

00:26:48.166 --> 00:26:51.166
"Why can't you give up
those bad habits?"

00:26:51.917 --> 00:26:55.834
- this is the point you
should ask your parents.

00:26:56.542 --> 00:27:00.041
"Why don't you give
up this dirty stuff

00:27:00.999 --> 00:27:03.917
which is just
making you mad?"

00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:10.458
Drinking makes people
mad, I tell you,

00:27:10.792 --> 00:27:13.542
and all their value
system is lost.

00:27:14.208 --> 00:27:16.125
Whatever you
may be

00:27:16.417 --> 00:27:20.166
whatever your
education,

00:27:20.583 --> 00:27:24.959
all is useless if
you take to drinks.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.208
You have no personality
after that.

00:27:31.959 --> 00:27:36.667
Nothing [unclear] -
the way you behave,

00:27:37.583 --> 00:27:40.291
and when people
get drunk,

00:27:40.542 --> 00:27:44.375
do you see how they
behave in a funny manner

00:27:47.792 --> 00:27:50.417
So just detest it

00:27:50.959 --> 00:27:54.041
and tell your parents
you don't like drinking.

00:27:54.667 --> 00:27:58.458
We don't want you to drink,
why do you drink?

00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:05.792
You can tell them!
Why do you drink?

00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:09.458
Because by drinking
they become mad...

00:28:11.792 --> 00:28:16.750
it is better to get a certificate
from mad house.

00:28:22.417 --> 00:28:26.500
You Sahaja Yogis now
realize this is madness

00:28:26.959 --> 00:28:28.750
and you have
to tell them

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:33.834
that we think that you are all
mad who sit down and drink.

00:28:37.834 --> 00:28:39.750
What do you want?

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.959
Drinking, what does
it give you?

00:28:49.709 --> 00:28:53.834
First of all you must seek
peace of your mind.

00:28:55.291 --> 00:28:57.709
That's not possible
if you drink,

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.417
have you heard of somebody who has
peace of mind because they drink?

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.667
When he dies,
maybe!

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:17.291
So it is to be told
to them frankly

00:29:18.792 --> 00:29:23.458
why do you drink,what is the
need to waste all the money.

00:29:28.417 --> 00:29:32.250
Mostly I have seen that they drink
because they are so ignorant,

00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:38.333
that they don't know there is
a higher life and better life

00:29:38.917 --> 00:29:43.709
by which you can control
your body, control everything.

00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:50.291
Once they come to
know they will realize

00:29:50.542 --> 00:29:53.458
that this drinking
makes you a slave

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.333
they are slaves
you see,

00:29:57.375 --> 00:30:01.750
and when they tell you something you
should say: "we don't want to listen to slaves,

00:30:03.166 --> 00:30:05.041
you are all slaves

00:30:05.542 --> 00:30:08.333
- there's no harm in
telling like this.

00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:13.000
"You are slaves and we don't
want to listen to slaves."

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.542
You see in India I don't know somehow
we have solved the problem,

00:30:22.583 --> 00:30:24.667
people don't drink so much,

00:30:25.333 --> 00:30:31.250
because from the very beginning there
the drinking is regarded as a very bad thing.

00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:36.834
If a girl knows that the fellow
drinks she will never marry.

00:30:38.542 --> 00:30:43.834
So society doesn't
accept drinking

00:30:44.709 --> 00:30:46.500
is a good thing

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:51.125
while your  society
is no society

00:30:52.125 --> 00:30:55.458
because there is no friendship

00:30:55.625 --> 00:30:58.667
there is no understanding

00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:03.834
and they don't think of
improving the life.

00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:10.333
What do they think?
They are very selfish

00:31:10.709 --> 00:31:13.041
and they think
of themselves

00:31:13.625 --> 00:31:15.792
selfishness in the sense

00:31:16.166 --> 00:31:20.542
that becoming mad is
very great selfishness.

00:31:23.542 --> 00:31:25.709
They become mad,

00:31:26.333 --> 00:31:29.917
and go on becoming more
mad and more mad

00:31:30.125 --> 00:31:32.125
and it is a sickness,

00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:36.792
you should tell them
that this is sickness.

00:31:37.458 --> 00:31:42.208
"You are sick people already
and we don't want to follow you."

00:31:44.208 --> 00:31:47.208
Don't be rude but you
should tell them.

00:31:47.834 --> 00:31:51.917
Drinking is sickness,
you say I said it.

00:31:54.375 --> 00:31:56.583
I don't mind.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.250
Have you seen a man
who is drunk?

00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:08.000
What do you
think of them?

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:12.041
They are more
than mad people.

00:32:13.792 --> 00:32:17.125
People are mad because
something gone wrong.

00:32:17.959 --> 00:32:22.000
But these are mad because
they have been drinking

00:32:24.583 --> 00:32:27.542
so you have to tell them:
"You are all mad.

00:32:28.166 --> 00:32:30.834
You are going to ruin your country."

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.959
So many things I have seen,
what happens in the West

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.125
my own experience.

00:32:40.875 --> 00:32:43.250
See, I am working
in Maharastra,

00:32:43.417 --> 00:32:47.917
working in India
in different places

00:32:49.291 --> 00:32:53.125
but there is no
problem with them

00:32:54.875 --> 00:32:57.542
when they are
realised souls

00:32:58.291 --> 00:33:02.583
but here with realised souls
also I find problems.

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:08.750
There is no problem in India
if there is realised souls,

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.917
they are purely
realised

00:33:12.583 --> 00:33:16.041
and here  there
are problems

00:33:17.208 --> 00:33:21.250
even with the
realised people.

00:33:25.333 --> 00:33:27.999
Here there are some
Sahaja Yogis

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.500
who made illegal money.

00:33:33.166 --> 00:33:38.250
They are Sahaja Yogis, I know for
definite, but they have done like that

00:33:42.125 --> 00:33:44.291
they have been saved,

00:33:45.041 --> 00:33:49.792
but not in the Heaven.

00:33:52.667 --> 00:33:55.834
They work it out,
save themselves

00:33:57.166 --> 00:34:00.333
but everything happens.

00:34:02.333 --> 00:34:06.500
Some people say: "Mother we
drink very little." But why?

00:34:08.667 --> 00:34:10.208
Very common

00:34:11.709 --> 00:34:15.709
very little we drink' but why?
Why do you want to drink

00:34:15.917 --> 00:34:17.959
and waste your money,

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.000
first of all wasting
your money.

00:34:27.625 --> 00:34:29.417
It's very sad

00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:34.417
that all people who are
so well educated,

00:34:34.959 --> 00:34:38.999
so well off, become
so mad

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:42.208
- I don't understand.

00:34:42.999 --> 00:34:46.999
And if your parents are
drinking they are mad.

00:34:48.709 --> 00:34:51.709
You have to treat
them like mad people.

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:55.375
Then they will
realize,

00:34:57.959 --> 00:35:00.500
you should tell them off,

00:35:01.834 --> 00:35:06.000
that you want to waste all
your money in drinking.

00:35:07.291 --> 00:35:11.959
In India we have that way
very strong Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:17.917
They break the bottles, if
they come in the house.

00:35:18.875 --> 00:35:20.917
or what they do

00:35:21.583 --> 00:35:27.333
they break the...anything!

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.291
The parents become
really funny

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:40.709
because they can't understand what
is happening to these children.

00:35:41.417 --> 00:35:43.667
But they are
Sahaja Yogis,

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.959
so they don't like it and
they just throw them out.

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:50.500
There is no humbleness

00:35:50.917 --> 00:35:55.208
needed with
the mad people.

00:35:55.875 --> 00:35:59.208
You have to see that they
give up their drinking,

00:35:59.959 --> 00:36:01.917
very important,

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.709
and not to feel
shy about it.

00:36:09.417 --> 00:36:11.875
If you correct
your parents

00:36:12.542 --> 00:36:15.250
you correct the
whole nation.

00:36:19.417 --> 00:36:22.250
So you all have
to work it out

00:36:22.542 --> 00:36:25.333
and discuss among
yourselves

00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:29.583
and tell:"Oh my
Father drinks a lot."

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.999
So you ask your friend
to come and put him right.

00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:37.583
You can make fun
of them, they are mad!

00:36:39.999 --> 00:36:45.458
Do not take  them seriously,they
are mad, have pity on them,

00:36:46.959 --> 00:36:49.291
and work it
out that way.

00:36:49.583 --> 00:36:52.208
You have so many
friends together.

00:36:53.333 --> 00:36:55.875
Drinking is the
curse in the West,

00:36:57.875 --> 00:37:02.750
and how it has come - I think some
satanic force has worked,

00:37:04.417 --> 00:37:07.250
they never used to
drink so much before.

00:37:08.375 --> 00:37:09.834
No!

00:37:10.625 --> 00:37:13.000
Now I don't know,

00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:17.667
you walk on the street and
you find so many of them

00:37:18.542 --> 00:37:20.583
walking along.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.458
So Sahaja Yogis should see that
they don't drink themselves

00:37:28.792 --> 00:37:32.583
and don't allow
anybody to drink,

00:37:32.792 --> 00:37:36.166
your father, mother,
brother

00:37:37.583 --> 00:37:40.500
you have to tell them:
"You are all mad!

00:37:42.875 --> 00:37:45.250
Go to some
mad house!"

00:37:46.166 --> 00:37:49.750
Once you tell them
they will realize,

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:54.959
it's only you who
can correct them.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:57.917
I may do anything

00:37:58.125 --> 00:38:02.125
but first of all these people
should give up drinking?!

00:38:04.583 --> 00:38:07.709
You have lot of strength
as Sahaja Yogis

00:38:07.959 --> 00:38:11.041
and you have to work
out on your parents.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:17.166
How many of your parents
are drinking? Raise your hands.

00:38:20.792 --> 00:38:22.834
Your parents also?

00:38:23.291 --> 00:38:24.834
Bah prai!

00:38:30.834 --> 00:38:32.458
Just imagine.

00:38:35.458 --> 00:38:41.458
You should all oppose
their drinking, openly.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:50.583
You should say I don't like to
talk to people who drink. Like that.

00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:54.792
You go on and you'll be
surprised they'll come round.

00:38:59.959 --> 00:39:05.792
It is absolutely
depending on you.

00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:12.709
If your parents are drinking you
have to take a very strong view.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.375
And you have so many other
friends, also, to help you.

00:39:18.375 --> 00:39:20.500
Make fun of them.

00:39:21.166 --> 00:39:23.709
Somebody should
copy

00:39:23.999 --> 00:39:28.917
as to how they behave after
drinking, how they walk.

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:34.583
You should not insult
them but to copy them.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:39.917
Once they will know
there is no respect

00:39:40.667 --> 00:39:44.333
and care for the parents
they'll be alright.

00:39:48.208 --> 00:39:51.166
But even if they drink

00:39:52.834 --> 00:39:55.125
you are not so
much bothered

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:59.917
you are not bothered as
to - if they are drinking,

00:40:00.792 --> 00:40:05.208
but you should say that youare all
mad, where will you be going?

00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:08.625
What will happen
to you?

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.709
You can talk like elderly
people with them

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:25.542
and also see that they don't
have friends who drink

00:40:26.583 --> 00:40:30.458
if they have friends like that
you'd better tell the friends.

00:40:38.333 --> 00:40:39.625
You see

00:40:40.208 --> 00:40:44.834
it's not only you get responsibility
when you get your realization

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.667
but it is your
absolute responsibility

00:40:49.959 --> 00:40:51.542
that

00:40:51.917 --> 00:40:56.291
you improve your parents and
improve your brothers and sisters,

00:41:03.458 --> 00:41:05.959
you have to boss
over them

00:41:07.333 --> 00:41:12.375
and you have to tell
them, nothing to feel shy.

00:41:14.041 --> 00:41:16.458
Because they are
mad, you know!

00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:27.417
Very important for
Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.458
My experience
is this,

00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:36.333
that there are
Sahaja Yogis

00:41:36.792 --> 00:41:39.709
in the West who
are born,

00:41:40.792 --> 00:41:43.125
who get realization,

00:41:43.375 --> 00:41:47.500
who are very good, who are excellent,
I don't have to say anything.

00:41:48.875 --> 00:41:53.000
But they are humble
before their parents.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.709
You try to show that
you don't like it.

00:42:00.667 --> 00:42:03.291
If they are drinking
don't sit there

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.709
get out of
that place.

00:42:07.542 --> 00:42:10.166
You should try to denounce
the whole thing.

00:42:10.583 --> 00:42:12.500
There's no harm.

00:42:16.959 --> 00:42:21.750
If somebody says harsh
words you fight it back.

00:42:22.291 --> 00:42:27.417
But what about all these drunkards
who are sitting and drinking?

00:42:27.834 --> 00:42:30.000
You have to
tell them all.

00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:34.625
It's only you who can
improve your society.

00:42:36.917 --> 00:42:40.792
I'm here to
tell you,

00:42:48.375 --> 00:42:51.917
but you people
are very subdued.

00:42:54.166 --> 00:42:58.999
How many of you fight with the
parents, tell me, raise your hands.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.834
Hardly any.

00:43:11.999 --> 00:43:15.250
You are afraid of them,
these drunkards?

00:43:22.041 --> 00:43:24.542
They should be
afraid of you

00:43:25.875 --> 00:43:28.458
and hide themselves
somewhere

00:43:31.959 --> 00:43:35.166
If there are bottles in the
house you break them.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.583
Of course!

00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:42.417
You throw them
away,break them

00:43:42.875 --> 00:43:45.458
That's how you
have to fight them.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:54.792
How did we manage the British
to go away from India?

00:43:58.542 --> 00:44:00.667
By protesting!

00:44:06.583 --> 00:44:08.667
By protesting

00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:13.250
their domination,
that's all! Simple!

00:44:16.208 --> 00:44:18.792
And they
went away.

00:44:19.041 --> 00:44:22.041
Can you imagine, there
was no war, nothing,

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:24.500
and they all left us.

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.500
Because they say it is
cold that's why they drink.

00:44:34.917 --> 00:44:40.417
No need, there is no
need to drink for that.

00:44:42.999 --> 00:44:47.917
I know so many Indians,
so many of them,

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:51.458
they don't drink

00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:57.000
they have never seen
such a cold country.

00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:01.583
Now also many Russians
they don't drink.

00:45:02.583 --> 00:45:04.959
Very cold country,
Russians.

00:45:05.250 --> 00:45:09.583
And they don't allow their parents
also to drink, you know, Russians.

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:14.667
They are very brave,
the way they fought.

00:45:15.208 --> 00:45:19.000
You know how Hitler was
trying to dominate them,

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:22.333
but they got
all the power.

00:45:22.834 --> 00:45:25.792
So the Russians are
not so, I should say,

00:45:25.999 --> 00:45:28.500
So the Russians are
not so, I should say,

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.542
fashionable.

00:45:33.542 --> 00:45:35.041
You are Russian, na?

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:37.542
That I can...
- Ukraine leader.

00:45:39.834 --> 00:45:41.792
Agree.

00:45:42.709 --> 00:45:46.208
Russians are very
very brave people.

00:45:48.458 --> 00:45:51.291
And they have fought
their parents.

00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:56.041
And now in Russia we have
such a lot of Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:57.417 --> 00:46:01.166
It will happen that
Russia will become whole

00:46:03.792 --> 00:46:06.000
realised soul.

00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:11.250
While here the great people who
think no end of themselves

00:46:11.709 --> 00:46:16.208
will be all ending up
in the lunatic asylum.

00:46:22.542 --> 00:46:25.291
So today's My
lecture remember

00:46:25.458 --> 00:46:29.166
that you have every right
to oppose your parents

00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:31.375
if they are drinking.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:38.959
What they think that you want
all the money, that's why.

00:46:40.041 --> 00:46:43.166
But you should say:
"We don't want your money".

00:46:48.041 --> 00:46:50.792
So now if you
are a leader,

00:46:51.458 --> 00:46:54.333
and there are who
are leading,

00:46:55.041 --> 00:46:58.417
you should remember if you
are opposing your parents.

00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:00.792
What do you care?

00:47:04.542 --> 00:47:07.709
Russians are very
brave, I must say.

00:47:08.542 --> 00:47:11.583
They have told
their parents off

00:47:12.542 --> 00:47:14.750
Even authorities.

00:47:17.375 --> 00:47:21.750
Why? Because they
are communists? Is it that?

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.750
Because they are
free-minded people.

00:47:28.458 --> 00:47:31.208
After all you are
all Sahaja Yogis,

00:47:31.458 --> 00:47:36.250
and what right they have
got to dominate you.

00:47:40.709 --> 00:47:43.959
They have no right,
they are drunkards

00:47:44.333 --> 00:47:46.875
how can they dominate you?

00:47:47.542 --> 00:47:50.291
You tell them ,you are
drunkards, don't talk!

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.208
No harm.

00:47:57.667 --> 00:48:02.750
You have to fight, you have to fight
your parents, very important.

00:48:04.291 --> 00:48:06.583
I'm with you.

00:48:12.792 --> 00:48:14.792
May God bless you.

00:48:20.542 --> 00:48:26.041
They will fight for democracy,
this, that. It's all demonocracy,

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.792
What is their democracy?

00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:34.291
When they drink what business
they have got to dominate you?

00:48:35.875 --> 00:48:39.125
Who are they? Drunkards,

00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:42.542
put them down!

00:48:43.709 --> 00:48:45.333
You have to now fight.

00:48:45.542 --> 00:48:49.625
The time has come, too
much time you have spent

00:48:49.959 --> 00:48:52.291
and tolerated them.

00:48:52.583 --> 00:48:54.583
What have
they done?

00:48:55.583 --> 00:48:57.250
Nothing.

00:49:02.166 --> 00:49:05.291
I must say Russians
are very clever,

00:49:05.625 --> 00:49:09.291
and very brave.

00:49:11.291 --> 00:49:12.417
Yes!

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.959
You know how they
made Hitler run away.

00:49:18.792 --> 00:49:21.834
Man like Hitler ran
away from there.

00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:23.959
How did they
manage?

00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:28.333
Because basically
they are honest

00:49:28.667 --> 00:49:30.333
and brave

00:49:33.792 --> 00:49:38.500
So we do not drink so why
should we be cowards?

00:49:39.208 --> 00:49:42.834
Only the drunkards
can be cowards.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.417
You are not drunkards,

00:49:46.792 --> 00:49:48.959
so you should be
brave and tell

00:49:49.125 --> 00:49:52.792
your parents and improve
your family life.

00:49:54.333 --> 00:49:57.125
Here I find the family

00:49:58.125 --> 00:50:00.667
life is so horrible.

00:50:01.667 --> 00:50:05.125
Parents are funny,
mothers are funny,

00:50:06.125 --> 00:50:10.583
how can they be? How can
you be their children?

00:50:11.458 --> 00:50:15.917
You should say that we are ashamed
to be the children of drunkards.

00:50:18.166 --> 00:50:20.125
They will realize.

00:50:30.917 --> 00:50:33.542
Russians have
given up drinking.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.500
Those who are
Sahaja Yogis,

00:50:37.999 --> 00:50:41.250
they have given
up completely.

00:50:50.041 --> 00:50:53.500
I don't know what has
made them like that.

00:50:56.041 --> 00:51:00.709
They are neither interested in
money or position or anything.

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.375
Sahaja Yogis.

00:51:11.166 --> 00:51:16.542
The Indians have
got a heritage

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:22.417
but they also,they come to
England they start drinking.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:31.375
They think people don't drink
because they are not free.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.291
What is the idea?

00:51:35.667 --> 00:51:38.333
If you are free you
should be able to drink,

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.000
you should
become mad?

00:51:41.709 --> 00:51:44.458
That's freedom,
isn't it?

00:51:46.875 --> 00:51:49.625
Now you can tell
them: "You are mad!"

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:55.333
You are drinking so
you are mad.

00:51:57.417 --> 00:51:59.750
Tell them I have
said it.

00:52:05.875 --> 00:52:08.417
Alright now are
you convinced?

00:52:16.709 --> 00:52:17.834
Now...

00:52:26.959 --> 00:52:29.583
Everybody's getting
vibrations?

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.333
Is there somebody who is not
getting? Please raise your hand.

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:40.750
See

00:52:41.667 --> 00:52:45.583
How collective you are
and how powerful.

00:52:47.709 --> 00:52:52.875
But I have seen that Sahaja Yogis
are so afraid of their parents.

00:52:53.208 --> 00:52:57.166
That they group together
like two cowards.

00:52:58.875 --> 00:53:00.834
You should be brave

00:53:01.375 --> 00:53:06.000
and tell them off, you have
got the power to do that

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.291
If you can

00:53:09.917 --> 00:53:14.291
change your parents you have
done a big job to them.

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.417
What else can you
do for them?

00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:24.542
If the parents are changed
you have done a big job.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.875
What do you say?

00:53:31.583 --> 00:53:33.542
You are too mild.

00:53:34.583 --> 00:53:38.709
You take two, three Sahaja
Yogis and beat them nicely.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:50.041
Otherwise they beat in
any case after drinking.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.500
With drinking
they do!

00:53:59.041 --> 00:54:01.125
It's very sad.

00:54:02.041 --> 00:54:05.417
You all are free
country people,

00:54:08.041 --> 00:54:10.417
but you have
to fight, without

00:54:11.125 --> 00:54:14.041
the fight it won't
work out.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:18.417
So I want you all
to meet each other,

00:54:18.999 --> 00:54:22.208
and have complete
sense,

00:54:22.875 --> 00:54:26.041
that you are
Sahaja Yogis.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.500
that means you are
being blessed by God.

00:54:31.417 --> 00:54:34.917
And you are
representative of God.

00:54:35.875 --> 00:54:40.333
And you are not going to
take to these dirty things.

00:54:42.999 --> 00:54:45.250
Respect yourselves,

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:48.375
respect!

00:54:51.125 --> 00:54:55.166
You can tell your parents we
cannot respect you for drink.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.625
Tell them.

00:54:58.291 --> 00:55:01.208
You can tell them
I have said so.

00:55:06.417 --> 00:55:09.291
Look at Christ how
he fought.

00:55:12.166 --> 00:55:15.709
What sort of
Christians they are...

00:55:17.625 --> 00:55:20.458
Drinking, drinking, drinking.

00:55:28.250 --> 00:55:32.333
But in India - why don't they
drink? They don't drink.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:42.542
They just live without
drinking, they are doing well.

00:55:49.375 --> 00:55:54.333
I think you take
from Me that courage

00:55:54.959 --> 00:55:57.417
to fight your parents.

00:56:00.333 --> 00:56:02.417
Next time when
I come,

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:05.500
I don't want to see
anybody saying

00:56:05.709 --> 00:56:08.709
that the parents
don't listen.

00:56:23.417 --> 00:56:27.875
When they are drunk you can
hit them with the spoon.

00:56:38.583 --> 00:56:41.999
Even in Russia they
drink quite a lot,

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.792
but those who have got
realisation don't drink.

00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:49.500
At any reason.
They don't drink.

00:56:50.834 --> 00:56:53.542
That's why I think
communism is good.

00:56:53.875 --> 00:56:56.583
Because they have
so much courage!

00:57:00.667 --> 00:57:02.542
With all this democracy

00:57:02.709 --> 00:57:06.709
you are all becoming demons,
nothing but demons.

00:57:09.792 --> 00:57:12.792
So today I take
your promise,

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:18.333
that you will manage
your parents well.

00:57:23.542 --> 00:57:25.750
Thank you very much.

00:57:27.417 --> 00:57:32.500
Anybody has any
problems, you tell me.

00:57:34.542 --> 00:57:38.166
Mother, in my school
there are many students

00:57:38.375 --> 00:57:41.333
whose family, they drink
and they're all split up.

00:57:41.542 --> 00:57:43.333
They are very
disturbed.

00:57:43.625 --> 00:57:45.291
I can't hear him.

00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:49.709
He says that in his school
many friends, familly drink,

00:57:49.834 --> 00:57:53.041
and the parents split, divorced.
Because of drinking.

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:58.750
When? When they
have time free?

00:58:00.291 --> 00:58:05.500
And they're all disturbed, the
students are all disturbed, Mother.

00:58:05.999 --> 00:58:07.250
They want what?

00:58:09.875 --> 00:58:13.458
The students - their parents
drink and separate.

00:58:13.709 --> 00:58:15.667
There are lots
of problems,

00:58:15.792 --> 00:58:17.417
and the young students
are very upset about it.

00:58:17.583 --> 00:58:20.000
You break
their bottles.

00:58:22.834 --> 00:58:25.667
You tell them
I have told you.

00:58:26.999 --> 00:58:30.834
You break their bottles, you
see the bottle and break it.

00:58:31.458 --> 00:58:33.333
Then you see.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.417
We have done
that in India,

00:58:37.458 --> 00:58:40.750
you know when we were
asking for independence?

00:58:41.709 --> 00:58:47.375
The children, they used
to break their bottles.

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:54.667
With the bottles in, you can
never enjoy your freedom.

00:58:56.041 --> 00:58:57.999
You break it!

00:59:09.709 --> 00:59:11.500
Any question?

00:59:18.417 --> 00:59:23.792
We shouldn't insult them but you
can break the bottles alright.

00:59:27.542 --> 00:59:33.875
Shri Mataji thank you, that you come
to Burwood , thank you.

00:59:34.125 --> 00:59:36.583
May God bless you.
