00:23.512 --> 00:26.090
Now, the best way would be to pray.

00:26.291 --> 00:28.942
Prayer is very great thing for
sahaja yogis.

00:29.143 --> 00:31.180
Pray with your heart.

00:31.381 --> 00:34.535
First of all, you must ask for strength
from Mother.

00:34.736 --> 00:38.627
“Give me strength so that I be genuine,
I won’t deceive myself.”

00:38.828 --> 00:41.611
You are deceiving yourselves,
morning till evening.

00:41.812 --> 00:44.291
“Give me strength that I face myself

00:44.492 --> 00:48.299
and say it with my heart that I try
to improve myself.”

00:48.500 --> 00:52.135
Because these are defects which are
not your own, they are outside.

00:52.336 --> 00:56.529
If they fall off, you’ll feel all right,
you’ll be perfect.

00:56.730 --> 01:05.239
Now, then you should ask for
forgiveness, pray for forgiveness.

01:05.440 --> 01:11.692
There should be prayer, said that,
“Forgive me because I have been ignorant,

01:11.893 --> 01:15.723
I did not know what to do, I have done
mistakes – so You please forgive me.”

01:15.924 --> 01:19.621
That is the first thing one has to ask,
is the forgiveness.

01:19.822 --> 01:24.856
Then second thing you ask for is,
“Give me a sweet tongue.

01:25.057 --> 01:29.086
A method by which I become
communicative with others,

01:29.287 --> 01:33.859
others respect me, they like me,
they like my presence.

01:34.060 --> 01:38.330
Give me strength. Give me love,
give me that beauty of culture,

01:38.531 --> 01:42.534
beauty of understanding that everybody
loves me, wants me.”

01:42.735 --> 01:45.408
Ask for that.

01:45.609 --> 01:53.072
In the prayer you ask that, “Oh Lord,
give me the sense of security of my Spirit,

01:53.556 --> 02:00.018
so that I do not feel insecure, by which
I trouble others, or get angry.

02:00.219 --> 02:03.026
Give me sense of my own dignity,
so that I do not feel

02:03.227 --> 02:06.391
that I am belittled or somebody
has littled me.”

02:06.592 --> 02:09.422
If you are at a higher position
nobody can belittle you.

02:09.623 --> 02:13.641
It’s only you belittled by your
foolishness and doubtfulness.

02:13.842 --> 02:19.367
Ask for strength that, “Give me
my witness-state,

02:20.731 --> 02:24.555
give me satisfaction.” Ask from
Me satisfaction.

02:24.756 --> 02:28.156
“Let me feel my satisfaction from
what I have.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.859
Whatever I have, whatever I eat,
everything,

02:31.060 --> 02:33.922
take out my attention away from
all these things.”

02:34.123 --> 02:36.162
You know that your attention
is in the stomach,

02:36.363 --> 02:37.797
and those who are very much
interested

02:37.998 --> 02:42.572
in food will get liver, in any case,
whatever you may try.

02:46.311 --> 02:49.041
“In anything like this, wherever
my attention is going,

02:49.242 --> 02:53.094
please give me strength to pull it
back. Chittanirodh.

02:53.295 --> 02:57.898
Teach me how to avoid things
that tempt me,

02:58.099 --> 03:01.167
that take away my attention,

03:01.692 --> 03:06.295
take away my thoughts. Give me
witness-state

03:06.496 --> 03:08.811
by which I see the whole drama.

03:09.012 --> 03:12.748
Let me never spite others
and criticize others.

03:12.949 --> 03:17.147
Let me see my mistakes,
not others.

03:17.348 --> 03:19.866
Let me see why people are not
happy with me.

03:20.067 --> 03:24.404
Give me strength to have a very
sweet tongue and a sweet nature

03:24.605 --> 03:29.209
so that others like my company,
they enjoy my company.

03:29.410 --> 03:34.363
Let me be like a flower and not
like a thorn.”

03:34.564 --> 03:38.074
You have to pray. All these prayers
are going to help you.

03:38.275 --> 03:40.801
Then ask for the greatest prayer
which reduces wrath that,

03:41.002 --> 03:44.629
“Please keep me away from ego

03:44.830 --> 03:48.982
that gives me ideas that I’m superior
to others, I’m better than others,

03:49.183 --> 03:53.365
or in any way it takes away
my meekness and my humility.

03:53.566 --> 04:00.029
Give me natural humility by which I can
penetrate into the hearts of people.”

04:00.230 --> 04:03.399
Just you have to bend your head
and you go up to your heart.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.821
You have to bend your head.

04:07.756 --> 04:12.079
Just to bend your head and there is
your heart where resides the Spirit.

04:12.280 --> 04:16.871
Be with it. If you are any way
hurting your ego,

04:17.080 --> 04:19.840
or you are hurting somebody’s ego –
it’s just the same.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.918
You’ll behave in the same manner,
in the same egoistical manner.

04:23.119 --> 04:26.348
So try to understand that these things
have to go away.

04:26.549 --> 04:29.363
The best is to pray and ask for help.

04:29.564 --> 04:32.763
Prayer is a very big thing, but with
your heart pray that,

04:32.964 --> 04:36.885
“God give us strength and that growth

04:37.086 --> 04:39.606
that we can please our Mother
sometimes.

04:39.807 --> 04:42.759
We want to please our Mother,
we want to see Her happy.”

04:42.960 --> 04:45.849
The only thing that will really give
Me happiness is

04:46.050 --> 04:49.870
that the way I love you, you love
each other.
