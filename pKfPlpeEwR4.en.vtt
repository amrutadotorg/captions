00:00:23.512 --> 00:00:26.090
Now, the best way would be to pray.

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:28.942
Prayer is very great thing for
sahaja yogis.

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:31.180
Pray with your heart.

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:34.535
First of all, you must ask for strength
from Mother.

00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:38.627
“Give me strength so that I be genuine,
I won’t deceive myself.”

00:00:38.828 --> 00:00:41.611
You are deceiving yourselves,
morning till evening.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.291
“Give me strength that I face myself

00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:48.299
and say it with my heart that I try
to improve myself.”

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.135
Because these are defects which are
not your own, they are outside.

00:00:52.336 --> 00:00:56.529
If they fall off, you’ll feel all right,
you’ll be perfect.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.239
Now, then you should ask for
forgiveness, pray for forgiveness.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.692
There should be prayer, said that,
“Forgive me because I have been ignorant,

00:01:11.893 --> 00:01:15.723
I did not know what to do, I have done
mistakes – so You please forgive me.”

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:19.621
That is the first thing one has to ask,
is the forgiveness.

00:01:19.822 --> 00:01:24.856
Then second thing you ask for is,
“Give me a sweet tongue.

00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:29.086
A method by which I become
communicative with others,

00:01:29.287 --> 00:01:33.859
others respect me, they like me,
they like my presence.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.330
Give me strength. Give me love,
give me that beauty of culture,

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:42.534
beauty of understanding that everybody
loves me, wants me.”

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.408
Ask for that.

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:53.072
In the prayer you ask that, “Oh Lord,
give me the sense of security of my Spirit,

00:01:53.556 --> 00:02:00.018
so that I do not feel insecure, by which
I trouble others, or get angry.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.026
Give me sense of my own dignity,
so that I do not feel

00:02:03.227 --> 00:02:06.391
that I am belittled or somebody 
has littled me.”

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:09.422
If you are at a higher position
nobody can belittle you.

00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:13.641
It’s only you belittled by your
foolishness and doubtfulness.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:19.367
Ask for strength that, “Give me
my witness-state,

00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:24.555
give me satisfaction.” Ask from
Me satisfaction.

00:02:24.756 --> 00:02:28.156
“Let me feel my satisfaction from
what I have.

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:30.859
Whatever I have, whatever I eat,
everything,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.922
take out my attention away from
all these things.”

00:02:34.123 --> 00:02:36.162
You know that your attention
is in the stomach,

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:37.797
and those who are very much
interested

00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:42.572
in food will get liver, in any case,
whatever you may try.

00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:49.041
“In anything like this, wherever
my attention is going,

00:02:49.242 --> 00:02:53.094
please give me strength to pull it
back. Chittanirodh.

00:02:53.295 --> 00:02:57.898
Teach me how to avoid things
that tempt me,

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.167
that take away my attention,

00:03:01.692 --> 00:03:06.295
take away my thoughts. Give me
witness-state

00:03:06.496 --> 00:03:08.811
by which I see the whole drama.

00:03:09.012 --> 00:03:12.748
Let me never spite others 
and criticize others.

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:17.147
Let me see my mistakes,
not others.

00:03:17.348 --> 00:03:19.866
Let me see why people are not
happy with me.

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:24.404
Give me strength to have a very
sweet tongue and a sweet nature

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:29.209
so that others like my company,
they enjoy my company.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.363
Let me be like a flower and not
like a thorn.”

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:38.074
You have to pray. All these prayers
are going to help you.

00:03:38.275 --> 00:03:40.801
Then ask for the greatest prayer
which reduces wrath that,

00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:44.629
“Please keep me away from ego

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.982
that gives me ideas that I’m superior
to others, I’m better than others,

00:03:49.183 --> 00:03:53.365
or in any way it takes away 
my meekness and my humility.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:04:00.029
Give me natural humility by which I can
penetrate into the hearts of people.”

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.399
Just you have to bend your head
and you go up to your heart.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.821
You have to bend your head.

00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:12.079
Just to bend your head and there is
your heart where resides the Spirit.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.871
Be with it. If you are any way
hurting your ego,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.840
or you are hurting somebody’s ego –
it’s just the same.

00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:22.918
You’ll behave in the same manner,
in the same egoistical manner.

00:04:23.119 --> 00:04:26.348
So try to understand that these things
have to go away.

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:29.363
The best is to pray and ask for help.

00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:32.763
Prayer is a very big thing, but with
your heart pray that,

00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:36.885
“God give us strength and that growth

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:39.606
that we can please our Mother
sometimes.

00:04:39.807 --> 00:04:42.759
We want to please our Mother,
we want to see Her happy.”

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.849
The only thing that will really give
Me happiness is

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.870
that the way I love you, you love
each other.
