00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.080
Today we are going to worship

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.920
the Devi, we call her Amba,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.480
and by many other names.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.160
She is the last, we should say, the ''residual power''

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.120
When she has done everything

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.080
she becomes the Kundalini

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.200
and settles in the triangular bone of yours.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.880
This is the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.960
But actually she is expressed

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.840
more on the left side,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.560
because that time she is purely the Amba.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.000
This left side is a very, very important

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.320
thing for all the human beings.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.880
lf you have no left side, you cannot balances to begin with.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.320
And it is said that

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.080
she gives you a real personality

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.240
of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.160
That is, your left side, if it is weak,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.160
then you have to worship her;

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:30.400
and request her that ''Please enrich our left side''.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.920
By enriching your left side,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.920
what she does, she is a comforter,

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.240
So, what does she give you? First of all, she makes you rest.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.200
It is said that she makes you rest.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.960
That is, she makes you sleep.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.920
lf you are too much thinking about future

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.920
and you are so much indulging into the futuristic planning,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.920
you have some problems;

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.840
but the best thing is if you can sleep,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.560
then it is a great comfort,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.360
it is a very great comfort to you that you can sleep

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.880
and that you can take some rest.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.680
Without her you cannot sleep: absence of her, you cannot sleep.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.880
So sleeping is a very important function

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.240
of the body, which is brought forth by the left side.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.960
That's why we worship her,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.360
because she should give us rest.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.040
She's the one who gives you peace;

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.760
She's the one who

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.400
gives you also illusions,

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.080
called as Bhranti.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.720
She gives you all the artistic talents,

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.080
she protects you.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.400
But this part that is she is

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.280
creating illusions for you

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.640
that's very, very important.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.880
Because those people who are against Divine,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:50.280
who are trying to be away from the reality,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.880
she creates illusions for them.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.800
So she separates you from those people,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.320
while you know the reality

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.440
and all such people who are

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.240
troubling or trying to destroy her work

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.520
She is the one who creates illusions.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.160
She is the one who resides as the Kundalini.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:35.120
So we can say that part of her is the Kundalini,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.200
but another part that she has

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.960
is the one which resides in the left side.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.960
Now there are seven

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.760
levels

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.840
which she resides.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.240
Once you start enjoying her on the first level,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.280
then She has all these qualities described to you.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.840
That She is peace,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.920
She is the one who gives you love,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.160
She is the one who creates

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.920
all the beautiful things for you.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.680
She is the Mother.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.200
And what She expects you is to enjoy her protection,

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.960
enjoy her love and be always

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.400
under her complete protection.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.920
So this is a very important part of her work.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.440
And the second one is that She is the Kundalini.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.360
So She also acts on seven levels.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.920
Seven levels She moves, we can say horizontally,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.040
and seven levels she moves upward.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.840
And all these seven levels, on both of the sides.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.560
She does tremendous work for us.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.400
How she protects us through these seven levels, is like this,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.720
that even if you start going towards the left side,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.000
there are seven Deities

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.880
which try to throw you back into normalcy.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.360
There are Shankini, Dhankini, these are the names.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:17.280
And by that you try to come to normal conditions.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.920
Now for example, many psychosomatic diseases

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:28.160
which come to us, like cancer and so many others;

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:33.240
psychosomatic means it is physical

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.960
as well as it is emotional.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.000
So these psychosomatic troubles

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.960
start coming from the left side.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.400
Sometimes you are too much on the right side,

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.800
then suddenly you are thrown to the left side, suddenly.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.080
And then the movement like a pendulum, you can go any far.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.080
But there are seven powers on the left-hand side

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.360
which protect you from getting into these diseases;

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.040
also reducing

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.240
their intensity.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:27.200
So at one time, she is the one who is peace giving,

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.680
she is the one who looks after you and protects you,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:43.120
and she is the one who saves you from psychosomatic diseases.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.200
ls a very powerful entity.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.840
lf she was not there l don't know what would have happened.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.200
So we should worship her within ourselves.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.840
We should respect her, and understand her;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.520
she is your Mother.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.480
As Kundalini she is your particular Mother.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.120
She is the one, Amba,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.880
who gives you your second birth.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:30.240
And as the left side

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.640
goddess she gives you

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.120
a very good support in your ascent.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.560
A very good support in your ascent.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.120
Without her you could not balance yourself.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.000
This goes too far sometimes

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.240
when people are too much on the right side.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.720
Then they get diseases which are very funny.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.280
They can get heart-attack, they can get paralysis.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.840
They also get the right side completely paralyzed.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.920
They can't walk, they can't lift themselves.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.240
This is too much of right side movement.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.800
So then she is the one

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.280
who makes you feel bad about it.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:39.120
She is the one who suggests that you give up your right side

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.920
and take more to the left side.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.720
So that doesn't mean that right side,

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.840
if it is cured by the left side,  it is very good.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.920
For example, a person who is very arrogant, egotistical,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:03.720
such a man may become absolutely docile,

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:11.000
and people might think he is cured. No. He is on the left side.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:17.360
Though he has become docile, still he is not normal.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.160
Still he is very much wrong because he is on the left side.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:31.680
On the left side one starts getting many diseases like schizophrenia

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.320
on the upper level of this group.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.920
This side these same seven centers

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:45.440
act to give you very serious troubles.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.880
One of them is that people become schizophrenic.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.120
It can be cured;

00:12:54.480 --> 00:13:00.480
it can be cured if you can move that person to the center.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.880
And by Kundalini awakening you can do it.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:10.000
Then people also become mad, lunatic.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:15.200
But all the troubles of the right side disappear.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.320
Such people who have moved to the left side

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.160
won't have liver problems.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.640
They might have enlarged liver,

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.240
but over-active liver they won't have.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:33.200
They won't have other symptoms like asthma, heart attack.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.800
They cannot have heart attack. They'll give heart attacks to others

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.800
but they themselves don't get heart attacks.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.280
So this

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.200
sudden movement of your attention into the left side

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.800
is all the time guarded by these seven entities,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.520
or goddesses,who look after you.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.800
But still if you go on with it:

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.920
for example you go to the false gurus;

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.560
then what do the false gurus do?

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.800
They put you to your left side.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.880
They'll give you a name, some name,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.320
it could be the name of a servant, or anyone

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.240
whom they have captured and whom they are looking after

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:31.880
as a kind of a possession for others.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.160
This is tantrika, they people possess

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.040
the spirits of these dead people

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.360
and use them to entice you.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.960
So when you start

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.800
getting into the left side by any means,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.960
you can get it by worrying too much,

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:01.880
you can get it by feeling very sorry for something,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:05.920
or crying, weeping, anything,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.440
then your right side problems disappear.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:18.440
That is why you do it. But it goes too far.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.960
The right side problems are, if they are cured,

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.440
you get the left side problems which are much more dangerous.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.800
l told you all kinds of psychosomatic diseases,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.200
l don't want to give the list to frighten you,

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.280
but they all come from the left side.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:48.000
Now, because the right side is a sort of completely

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.040
cured, as they say, people think that it is a very good idea

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.360
to get possessed by some spirit.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.440
So these false gurus, what they do,

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:07.640
they master these dead spirits.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.520
How? l mean, they know how to do it;

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.200
l need not tell you, you are not going to do it.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:22.840
And they master it and they tell you that ''You take this name''.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.920
You start taking the name of some sort of a God-knows-what.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.640
They don't tell that you take the name of any incarnation,

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.040
but they'll tell you ''Take the name of Ram''.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.440
Ram's name is not taken like that,

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:45.000
it has to be Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, Shri Mataji.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.880
So they never put Shri, they just tell you ''Take these names'',

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:54.160
and by these names what happens is that you go

00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:00.160
to the left side because of these dead spirits, they capture you.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.960
There are dead spirits on the left side

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.920
and there are dead spirits on the right side.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:14.400
lf they are on the right side they are very ambitious people,

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:21.720
and they try to capture you. It is a very

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:31.240
frightening explanation of the whole thing.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:36.360
Once they capture you, if you go to the right side,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.840
you get all right side ''qualities'', you are not normal.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.400
Sometimes you feel you are going in the air somewhere,

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.960
you have seen something which you would normally not see.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:00.240
Like two Americans came to see me and they were journalists.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.560
So l asked them ''Why are you here?''

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.800
They said ''Mother, you make us like Harishchandra''.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
There was one fellow called Harishchandra who was a journalist.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.400
l said, ''But, like him?''

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:20.960
Because he used to travel in the air, and he used to get news,

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:27.320
like he would tell, about what is happening in some part

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:46.000
some part of Bombay

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.760
like we have a Juboo Beach

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.000
So one day in the newspaper it came out what happened at Juboo Beach

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.920
and his name was there,

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.240
the one who is the correspondent was Mr Harishchandra.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.760
So, how did Harishchandra tell you my name?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.960
l cured him, while you want to get into his trouble?

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:26.200
So we want to have this ''astral travel'', Americans,

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.760
''For what?'' ''Because we are journalists

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.280
and we'll know so much about everything

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.920
we want to travel all over''.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.080
l said ''This l don't do''.

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.480
lf you are doing astral travel, of course l can reduce it .

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:47.280
So all these gurus had mastered

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.920
also this art of astral travel,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.960
controlling some dead spirits who were right sided.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:03.160
So right sided spirits are very ambitious

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.960
and they do all kinds of healings,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.760
and all kinds of predictions,

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.000
because they are futuristic.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.320
Sometimes they know, sometimes they don't know.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.240
But it is all coming from a wrong source;

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.040
so getting into that trap is not a very good thing.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.800
lf somebody is possessed like that,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.280
then such a person starts doing all kinds of wrong things.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.240
Like it will try to grab your house,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:50.200
to grab your money, to deceive you,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.400
run away with your wife, all kinds of things

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:57.040
which are absolutely wrong.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:03.200
Because the influence of the right side increases with it.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:08.600
Also there are some drugs, when you take them,

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.800
like LSD and all that,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.920
you go to the right side and then you start seeing colours,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.120
and people think it is a very great thing to see colours,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.160
because normally you don't see colours.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.520
They don't know basically what is wrong with them.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.080
But basically what is wrong with them is that

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:34.400
there is a bhoot, there is some sort of a ghost

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.800
which is very right sided, has gone into their being

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.080
and trying to work it out.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:47.200
But the left side bhoots are different then.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.960
They are sly and they teach you peevish things.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:22:00.680
They may also try to entice you

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.400
to such an extent that a person can tell lies to any limit.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.840
He tells lies, then he tries to secretly take away your money,

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.800
take away whatever you have,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.760
all kinds of planning secretive takes place,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.200
nothing is open,

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.280
and you do it without even understanding.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.880
But all these people are more interested

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:39.880
in achieving some sort of a very material advancement,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:45.240
whether it is on the right side or the left side.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.240
Many things happen like fundamentalism.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:54.520
lf you are a fundamentalist then these bhoots take over

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.040
and they try to overpower you.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.360
They try to teach you how to

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:07.160
kill people who do not belong to your religion or to your sect.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:13.080
They give ideas and they fight and they quarrel and they kill.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.480
But the Mother Earth

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:23.120
or the sea, anything,

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:29.120
any one of these elements can work out the destruction.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.440
Ln such places you'll find

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.160
big earthquakes taking place and destroying them.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.200
Or there could be a hurricane that will come and destroy them.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.960
Of course some innocent people are also killed with them.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:52.320
It could be anything that you do wrong,

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:59.280
it is being corrected by all these five elements.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:06.640
Ln lndia we had a place called as Latur

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.960
where people used to drink and drink and drink.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:17.320
Once they went for drinking

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:24.480
when they had immersed the statue of Shri Ganesha.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:30.680
That we do, we put it in the sea,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.080
after three days, maybe seven days or ten days.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:37.280
And they came back from there,

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.920
and they had gone for drinking after that

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:44.240
and they were completely drunk

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.840
and still they were singing the praise of Shri Ganesh

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.200
and saying all kinds of filthy things,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:57.080
unholy things, dirty things, we can call them

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.200
or lots of abuses they were using.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:07.720
Fulfilling that desire to be nasty, to be bad.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.720
And suddenly an earthquake came.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.360
They were all dancing, and they all went inside

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.280
the Mother Earth and were finished.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:27.720
We had a center there, surprisingly, that center was not touched.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:35.240
About 100 yards away there was a round circle created

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.280
so nobody could go out, and they were amazed how is it

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.040
that this center has not been touched at all.

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.800
That's the power of the goddess.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.280
At the same time,

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.440
when she sees these negative people are coming

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.280
to torture or to trouble,

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.200
it's the goddess who saves the right type of people.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.160
As you know, normally always, if there is one good person,

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.080
there will be a hundred bad people getting after them.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.360
And that person feels so lost,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:23.440
but then the goddess helps that man,

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:27.480
and saves that one, or that human being,

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:32.800
from the troubles from the negative force.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:39.000
So this mother of yours fights

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:44.160
all kinds of negative forces.

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.160
They can be, as l told you, drunkards who drink.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.560
So she starts destroying.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:57.080
At a lower level she'll destroy their liver,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.800
at an even greater level she'll destroy their family,

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.880
she'll destroy their money.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.960
l've not heard of anywhere a statue erected of a drunkard, never.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.200
Nowhere where drinking is a fashion,

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.840
where drinking is a daily worship in a way,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.760
but l have never seen anywhere.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.560
How is it that nobody has erected

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.720
any statue of a man who was drunk?

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.200
It would be nice to show that, but no.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.680
Because the wisdom prevails and people understand

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:42.000
what is the destructive force.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:04.720
So, one can get possessed by any such idea.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.680
See, like Hitler,

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.920
he got the idea that he is the monarch of everything,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.240
and he has every right to destroy the Jews.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.520
And he was destroying; he destroyed so many people.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.360
But, what happened at the end?

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.760
He was using the swastika which is the symbol of Shri Ganesh,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:37.440
and with that he was fighting. But luckily it so happened

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.320
that the Mother entered into his mind.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.920
By that he lost Bhranti,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:52.040
illusions, he lost the power of Ganesha, how to use it.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:58.080
And he was using a stencil, and because of the stencil

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:05.720
the second, l should say, printing of the Swastika

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:11.880
was the other way round which was for destruction.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.160
So he printed the other kind of swastika.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.480
As a result he got destroyed.

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.880
So this is the Bhranti part.

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.080
That she enters into your mind and puts you into a Bhranti,

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:31.680
means into an illusion. You commit mistakes.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.440
lf it had not happened

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.640
so many people would have been finished by now.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.440
So she enters into the mind of such people

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.480
for trying to destroy human beings,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.840
for trying to destroy anything,

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.840
and puts ideas in such a manner that they die

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.840
or they get self-destruction.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.400
That is why it is written that she is a Bhranti within us.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:04.520
She creates such an illusion within us that,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.400
that a person who tries to be harmful, to be troublesome,

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.800
to be destructive, gets destroyed.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.320
All kinds of things she can put,

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.080
and that's how so many people have survived in this world,

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.880
otherwise so many would have been finished

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.280
and there would have been the kingdom of the Satan.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.960
But it's this goddess is the one who saves us.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:38.080
Symbolically they have said that she has killed so many demons.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.440
Actually she has,

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:45.920
it is not that she has killed them in a symbolic way.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:51.200
There were demons and demons and even today we have demonic people.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.880
And all of them

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.200
will not only be killed but will be finished forever.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.000
l have seen in Russia, l have seen in many countries,

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:07.240
those people once upon a time were regarded as Gods has finished.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.840
It happens in every country.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:14.840
Wherever there are wrong type of people, they're exposed

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.840
and people don't even want to look at their photographs.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.560
They have thrown away their statues.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:26.080
All this happens because this goddess is the one

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.360
who creates an illusion for people.

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.800
Now supposing there is a person who is very demonic,

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.200
who is going to destroy everyone.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.400
Then the people who are wise will understand,

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:48.160
but those who are not, will take to her and get destroyed with him.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.200
Like this thousands of people have been destroyed.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.800
Because they didn't see the right point.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.400
They couldn't understand what is right and what is wrong.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.880
So this idea of right and wrong also

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:08.680
is completely confused by her

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:13.160
so that those who are wrong type can be destroyed.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.160
We don't want them on this earth.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.720
Those who are troublesome,

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:23.240
who are destructive, who are argumentative, will be all destroyed.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.880
But by themselves only they will be destroyed.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.320
It is not necessary for the goddess to do that.

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.840
So this is the one which many people ask me,

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.080
Why it is said that Bhranti Rupena Samstita?

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.400
Why does she exist as an illusion?.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:47.320
This is the reason that your discriminating power is challenged.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.280
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, a real Sahaja Yogi,

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.240
then you can feel on your fingertips

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.880
if the person whom you are following

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.440
is a good man or a bad man.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:06.840
And then you can tell others also that don't

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.000
So many seekers are destroyed like that.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.920
Wrong type of gurus came, and they just followed them.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.760
Stupid, they were absolutely stupid gurus,

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.960
and these were stupid people,

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.920
l don't know why they followed them. It was so obvious

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:29.320
that they were just after some sort of a Rolls Royce or something.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.560
l have seen them,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:38.200
so mad that they can't get out of it.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:46.480
There are people now who are following all kinds of wrong gurus;

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:52.320
one of them is now very much liked by the lndians all over

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.520
when they are abroad, not in lndia so much.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.080
So they follow that Babaji, all right.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.080
And this Babaji is the one,

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.240
he takes money, he steals money,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.240
he steals ornaments, he does all kinds of things.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.840
But they don't mind. Whatever he is doing is all right.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:21.040
And this Babaji is the one, is to be destroyed.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.800
But the advantage of having this Babaji is this,

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.120
that you have all kinds of stupid people on this earth,

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:35.080
so they have no discrimination,

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:40.160
and they fall prey to these Babajis finished.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.080
They'll get heart attacks, they'll become blind, they'll get cancer,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:49.640
they'll get all kinds of troubles and that destroys them.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.840
But it is surprising, human beings are such

00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:57.280
that they see a person being destroyed by a Babaji,

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:01.000
or some guruji lady,

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:06.360
and still one is killed and this also goes forward .

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:12.480
It is something surprising, that human beings don't see

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.200
that the person is destroyed.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:18.360
Like l have told you many a time since,

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.080
people who are going to the pub,

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.400
they see from the pub people coming out and falling on the ground.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:33.160
And they queue up to go inside again, to come back and fall.

00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.720
It is very surprising, isn't it?, they have no brains.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.600
Why do they want to go to the pub?

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:42.960
lf they have seen already somebody falling down.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.840
But they do it.

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.640
Now this is the Last Judgement, as l told you,

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.200
and at this time

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.760
you have to see what's happening to the person

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.360
who has gone by wrong methods

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.000
or by the help of some of these gurujis.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:06.200
It is very clear, if you want to see it, very clear.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.560
How they are destroying themselves.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.080
''ln any case'', they say, ''ln any case we have to die,

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.880
so why not go to the pub?'' l mean, what's this?

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:20.560
This kind of argument they give, so stupid

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.280
as if they have no brains, no intelligence

00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.440
to understand that a person has gone

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.480
and he came back from there and he has fallen on the ground,

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.880
and nobody to pick him up.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.880
And they are doing it.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:41.800
And they said that Christ did it, that he gave wine to people.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.160
Now, no, he cannot, he is perfect.

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.840
He didn't give wine, he gave them

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:53.080
just an ordinary juice of the grapes.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:58.920
How can you make wine in one second, can you?

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.200
But that's how they explain it;

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:06.320
all their bad things are explained by their stupid intelligence

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.080
and they go for destruction.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.240
And now in Kali Yuga

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.240
destruction is working very fast.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.200
Why? Because people have lost their discrimination.

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.320
They are no more discreet,

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:42.360
and so many people have lost it, it's not few.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.640
And it is a fashion to become indiscreet.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.880
l said, ''Why are they doing like this?''

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.240
''Mother, this is a fashion''.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.720
Any stupid thing is a fashion.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.240
Now you take to that stupid thing and then you are in trouble.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.920
Nowadays of course there's a fashion that women,

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.160
especially in America l have seen,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:10.040
they want to wear just straps over their

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.720
frocks, whatever you may call it.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:17.800
Just straps, and both the chakras are left open.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.680
They're very important chakras,

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.800
you should not even wear sleeveless,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.800
they should be always covered.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
All other chakras we cover, except for Agnya

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.160
which we also cover with kumkum.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.040
By that, how many diseases can come. You can get sinus,

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.400
start from sinus, you can get eye trouble,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.800
you can get paralysis of both the hands.

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:47.840
You can get also Parkinson.

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.240
All sorts of diseases can come

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.600
because these are two very important chakras,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.320
one is the Sri Chakra, which is on the right side

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.240
and another is the Laleeta Chakra on the left-hand side.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:05.480
You should never, never expose these chakras, also the knees.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.200
But it is a fashion nowadays to show the knees, l don't know,

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.080
l can't understand the logic behind it.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.920
What is in the knees?

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.040
Why people want to see the knees of people?

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.320
l mean l just don't understand.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.840
There's no logic, it's senseless!

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.000
At first l never understood it,

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.800
and now l have understood that they want to attract men!

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.200
lf men are attracted by your knees,

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.000
what sort of men they must be?

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:44.080
l don't understand such men also.

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.280
Men will be fully dressed while women will expose both the Nabhis

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.400
and both the chakras which are so important.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.200
And that is the fashion!.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:01.760
Tomorrow the fashion will start that you shave your heads.

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.640
So everybody will shave.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:09.800
As if it's like a flock of sheep

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:15.240
who don't understand, they go by the collective happening.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:18.200
So there's a fashion which is actually collective.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:24.680
And that's how it finishes off their sense, completely.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.200
You see it every day and you don't understand.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.680
l have seen even lndian women who are abroad,

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.200
they also try to copy the fashions.

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.880
And they also expose both their chakras,

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.040
and then they get into troubles.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.240
It's very surprising.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.120
At least in lndia it's not regarded as a

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.480
good men to see a woman like that.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.040
But when they have come abroad they have learnt this

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:57.400
a great knowledge how to expose your body.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.840
The other side of it could be even more serious,

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.360
like you cover your face.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.040
Mohamed-Saab must have thought of the modern times

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.680
and said, ''Cover your face.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.800
Cover your body. Cover yourself completely,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
so that you are safe as a woman and men are safe

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.040
because they are not attracted''.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.440
l mean this is going to the extremes.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:25.800
And it was to be worked out that way. But it does not.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:30.200
l have seen also Muslim women are so stupid

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.320
when they are facing their husbands,

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:34.840
the way they behave to attract their husbands,

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.920
and the way the husbands try to dominate. It is too much!

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.840
So this is the Bhranti.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:48.800
The Bhranti created by the Mother, the Amba.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.640
She creates this Bhranti

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.160
and with this Bhranti l have seen people can go amok

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.400
and they don't know they are going amok,

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:02.120
because all of them are going that side. So what?

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.680
Like there's a story

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.800
about a father told his son

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.120
that ''Which ever way people go, you must follow them''.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:19.040
So he saw many people going and he followed them.

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.920
Where does he go? To a funeral!

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:26.360
That doesn't mean don't use your brains!

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.160
This is said of course.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:35.800
Also you will see what they do is this,

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:42.760
that say many people are going, say,

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.280
to something wrong,

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.880
they have no brains of their own, no individuality, nothing,

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.360
they just follow it. They don't see what they have achieved,

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:57.920
what have they got, what is the use, nothing.

00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:03.040
Even when you buy something you want to find out

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.800
what is the quality; the person who has purchased,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.400
how is he using, everything you want to find out.

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.720
But when it comes to following the fashion, nobody thinks about it.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:19.280
And the fashion is created to be fool people, also, l think so.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:26.000
It is something very funny

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.840
creation of the evil force,

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.200
so that human beings should be destroyed.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.280
It is, they say, the designers.

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:41.920
l say it is nothing, designers or anything,

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:47.440
but is their aggressive force, their negative force

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.000
which works on you;

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.280
and who saves you is the Mother on the left side.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.640
She has got seven curtains. Seven boundaries

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.080
she doesn't want you to cross over.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.800
But human beings say: ''Why not? Why not me?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.280
lf they have gone to hell, l'll also go to hell''.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:14.160
All right. That's been made already for you, so go ahead.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:17.400
So that's why she creates the Bhranti;

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:23.160
because some people have to go out, out of this circulation,

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.840
out of this evolution process. Let them go out.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.720
This is the Last Judgement. All right, that's how you'll be judged,

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.920
by your own stupidity you'll be judged.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.360
l have told so many Sahaja Yogis something small,

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:44.880
that you must put some oil in the nights

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:47.240
and the morning time you wash.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.920
But they don't do it.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.280
But by doing that what happens is that you soothe yourself,

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.040
you sleep well.

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:02.080
Oiling is a very good thing. We need it all of us,

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.880
especially in this cold weather, we need it.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.280
But they won't put it.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.800
They'll neglect themselves.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.760
Because they think they're Sahaja Yogis

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.200
they are protected, Mother can oil them.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.840
It's not so. You have to look after yourself.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:25.560
As far as the body is concerned, the mind is concerned,

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.720
you are responsible for your body.

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:46.640
With Sahaja Yoga you will understand what's wrong with you,

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:48.400
what you are doing wrong.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.840
l mean l tell you some things which are very important,

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:57.920
but to you they may not be, but you should try that.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.000
As it is you are Realised Souls, your spirit is there,

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.840
you can feel the vibrations,

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:07.960
and you can understand what's wrong with the person.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.080
Mostly what l have seen, now it is much less,

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:18.480
that people only inform me always about people who are possessed.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.960
''Mother, such and such person is possessed''.

00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.000
''Mother this person has got this possession''.

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.920
l said, ''But, throw them out!'' That's all!

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.760
Why do you want me to bother about them?

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.920
Just throw them out!

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.040
Then after going out of Sahaja Yoga they will realise,

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.720
then they will say ''Mother we don't want to go out of Sahaja Yoga''

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.840
Why? Because they know that now

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.920
they are completely away

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.440
from reality and from safety.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.640
So they want to come back.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.120
Those who can come back can come back.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.000
But those who should not come back should never come back.

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:12.280
Because they are so mad that they'll create a fashion of madness,

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.080
and people can get influenced by that.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:21.080
So to get influenced by others is not a sign of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.640
He can influence others,

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:29.960
but how does he get influenced by others but for Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:32.960
Sahaja Yoga is the discriminating power.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.760
And who has given you this is the Kundalini.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.840
So this Kundalini which is your mother,

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.600
the one which is now in your triangular bone, also

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.160
gives you all the qualities and all the beauties of your being.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.800
Of course l have told you so many things about

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.320
Kundalini that l need not tell you.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.240
But she also can correct the left side.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.600
Some people have a habit

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.880
of all the time crying and weeping over. l don't know.

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.400
Every time you meet them they are in tears:

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.800
''And what has happened?''

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.160
''Mother this has happened, that has happened'' and all that.

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.720
They write letters after letters to me,

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.880
telling about their woes, their troubles and this and that.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.280
Baba you are Sahaja Yogis now.

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:30.040
Now you are in the Garden of Eden,

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.280
you are in the heavens.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.760
And why are they thinking about all the hellish things

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.200
which are not important? Why?

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.240
Because you haven't got your individuality either.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:15.880
Now as Sahaja Yogis you have to develop your discrimination

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:20.040
of understanding what others are.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.800
Also about yourself.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.040
Why do you hanker after things? Try to understand.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.800
What is so great about it?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.120
Why do you want to do it?

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:41.600
Question yourself. ls it some possession?

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:45.000
ls it some fashion?

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:51.520
Or is it your individual feeling?

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.800
So, l'm trying to tell you

00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:00.200
that this left side of yours is so protective,

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.280
at the same time

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.080
if you are very aggressive about your left side

00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:14.280
you are thrown from one to another to another to another into hell.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.400
And then you suffer.

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:24.840
So you must understand, your wisdom should be there,

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:29.360
which you can develop very much with the help of the left side.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.760
Wisdom can be very well developed.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:38.880
Now there's somebody, say a Sahaja Yogi, so called,

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:46.000
and he is absolutely aggressive, money-oriented, deceitful

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.920
and you get into his trap.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.200
ln Hindi we call it Chakkar, Chakkar.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:02.800
And once you get involved into that you go on drifting;

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.320
still your left side will protect, up to a point.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:15.240
But if you are too much of it, it throws you ''Get out, get out''.

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:20.000
Now the time has come for all of us to understand

00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:21.800
that you are all Sahaja Yogis

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.120
and you have a very big responsibility,

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:30.080
very, very big responsibility that you should do

00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:34.880
what your enlightened conscience tells you.

00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:41.160
Take to your enlightenment and live under that light,

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:45.040
and don't jump in the darkness.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:47.960
And by that you will also understand

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:52.240
who is the right person and who is not the right person.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:58.480
Even in Sahaja Yoga this negativity can work,

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.080
it works.

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:04.440
And one should not get involved

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.960
into any negative thoughts of others,

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:13.080
or negative doing of others.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.200
It's a warning today l wanted to give you all,

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.360
because you people are

00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:26.520
very much there, to enjoy.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:34.040
Look after your attention, where does it go.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.760
There is so many beautiful things, see the flowers, so beautiful!.

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.880
See this thing they have made so beautifully.

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:44.280
It makes my heart jump with joy;

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.280
while some people don't even notice.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.080
The other day l asked somebody,

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.960
''Who had made that flower arrangement?'' ''Which flower?''

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:58.000
l said ''The one that was there'' ''Which one?''

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.040
So l told the names of the flowers. ''We never saw''

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.280
Where were you looking,

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.280
that you couldn't see the flowers?!

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:10.720
Because your eyes are so stupid

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.920
that they cannot see the beauty.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:18.920
They are engulfed with all kinds of negative things.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:24.920
So the goddess has to kill all the rakshasas.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:30.080
l don't know how many she has killed, and again they are back.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:34.280
And again people are being trapped.

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.160
This is going on.

00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:42.200
So these rakshasas are there and you have to pin-point them.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.200
And tell people ''Where are you going? He's a rakshasa.

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:52.080
What he has done, what has he achieved?''

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:56.360
Now you should talk like that;

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.360
openly.

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:05.120
So you can save many people who are going to these rakshasas,

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:11.040
who are coming in such clothes that you cannot make them out.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:16.920
They will be destroyed, one by one,

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.880
but when they are in the heart

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:23.040
of so many people how can you destroy them?

00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.160
So it is for you people to tell them

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:30.880
what these rakshasas are doing.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.240
l know their tricks,

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:39.160
but the worst part is that the human beings fall into their tricks.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:44.840
So you have to be very self-understanding.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.000
Ask always the question ''Why?

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.960
Why am l attracted to this?

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.040
What is the gain?''

00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:57.200
Ask yourself this question.

00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.920
You'll find

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.920
that after coming to Sahaja Yoga you have gained so much.

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.440
So now, why have this false idea?

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:12.760
why go after false things, negative things?

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.040
That's what Sahaja Yogis have to do,

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.280
because not that they're responsible for others,

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.800
they are responsible for themselves also.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.360
Now the sweetest thing said about her is

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.200
that she gives you Shraddha.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.800
Shraddha we can translate it as faith.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:44.400
To have faith, rightly not wrongly.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:50.360
People take full advantage if you have wrong faiths.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.640
But faith is very important, that she gives also.

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.280
And that's very joy-giving.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:06.000
The faith is very joy-giving.

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:11.800
But when the incarnations lived, nobody believed in them.

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:17.040
They had no faith in them. Christ, they crucified,

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:21.480
nobody stood up to say, ''Why are you crucifying him?''

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:27.720
All of them; nobody could have

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.920
that faith to stand up.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.840
They may fight for their own country,

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.280
they may fight for their religion or own nonsense,

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.840
but, ''That a man, this man, is really the Truth,

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:47.680
he is the one who is an incarnation'', nobody will say it.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.400
So yesterday l was stunned

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:57.840
to see the drama they have shown.

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:01.000
l mean, l couldn't face myself, l should say.

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:03.280
Though it's the Truth, of course, l agree.

00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.880
But l couldn't face myself.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:10.000
l am too humble to accept such a thing,

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:16.080
and it's very ingenious, it's very great to create such a drama

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:21.280
and of all the things. At first l had said that

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.760
the English have such a sense of drama,

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.280
they had people like Shakespeare and all that,

00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:31.280
and the way they were producing drama l couldn't understand.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.960
But this one was the last word on perfection.

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:38.880
So much so that l couldn't say a word about it.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.920
l was just stunned.

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:46.000
The Truth that they have propounded.

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.440
But in my lifetime

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.880
you will have no doubts, if you have some sense in you.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.040
Because so many miracles are taking place.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.280
Today only somebody told me:

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:08.280
''Somebody had cancer,

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:12.800
ulcer and all kinds of things,

00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.800
and after Sahaja Yoga she went to the hospital and she had nothing''.

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.800
All such miracles are taking place. Leave alone.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.120
Also there are never have happened like this

00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:31.280
that there are photographs of mine

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:36.080
where you see, is remarkable.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:39.000
Even the scientists are surprised at it,

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:43.280
how these photographs are coming.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:48.000
Actually there was Shri Ganesha standing behind it actually.

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.960
Only in one camera it came.

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:55.320
It is just for you people to have faith.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.760
Because when the person is not there,

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:02.280
like Christ is no more, now everybody's going to church.

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:05.920
Shri Rama is not there so they are all singing his praise.

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:11.280
Shri Krishna is not there so they are ''Hari Rama, Hari Krishna''.

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:16.880
So when there is Sakshat, when that is before you,

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.280
you don't accept.

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:23.280
Because perhaps you don't believe you can deserve it, perhaps.

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:25.960
Or may be it is,

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.880
l don't know, human beings it is very difficult to understand them.

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:32.000
When you are standing before them they don't believe.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.280
When you are no more, then they will believe.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.280
It is a very funny thing, isn't it?

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:40.800
All through out if you see the history of spirituality

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.920
this has been going on.

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:49.320
Gyanadeva showed some miracles, still

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:53.360
only the wise, only the sensible

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.960
could understand and believe it.

00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:00.200
And there is so few that as a result

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:04.440
such people are crucified, killed or done anything.

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.440
They have tried that with me,

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:14.120
but you know in this life l have come in all Forms,

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.000
and nobody can destroy me:

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:22.080
Unless and until l want to finish myself, no one can.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.680
The powers are of love, affection, compassion,

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.080
but also there's a power

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.240
which completely corrects other people.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.880
So

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.600
to you people not to have faith in Sahaja Yoga

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.200
shows complete blankness,

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.080
you have seen the photographs,

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.080
you have seen everything, you have known the miracles,

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.000
it has happened to you. You have the experience of Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.400
Despite that your faith is so weak.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.080
She's the one who gives you faith,

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.880
so you have to praise her, you have to fall at her feet,

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.200
you have to worship her and ask her

01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:15.280
''Oh Mother, give us that faith''.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.920
And with this faith you'll be amazed,

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.360
any person who has this kind of a faith,

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.440
he tells me ''Mother, please, do this''

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:27.240
It happens. It just happens.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:34.280
Such right they have got to ask for anything. It works out.

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:38.000
But first your faith should be solid.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.000
Faith should be real.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.720
lf it is real and if it is deep,

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.280
you can achieve whatever you want.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.040
Not wrong, but good things.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.800
And so try to develop that faith

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.920
and as a faith gives you such joy and happiness,

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.760
you get committed, you get involved,

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:08.280
and you don't want to get out of it.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.360
So the greatest thing is the blessing

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.880
of the left side is the faith.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.840
Faith which is pure,

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:25.960
faith can be translated as, we can say, Vishwas

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:30.240
but not. Faith is Shraddha.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:36.160
Shraddha means something that is within;

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.040
which has no doubts,

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.800
which has no doing as such, it is just there.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.280
So you should now develop faith

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.680
about yourself and about Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:57.040
lf your faith is strong you will see many miracles also.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:00.400
But with miracles, with everything,

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.440
still if you don't understand

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:08.960
then it is your discretion.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:16.000
May God Bless You.
