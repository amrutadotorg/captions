1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,160
This Spirit when it manifests, it also gives you a state

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,800
which we call as collective consciousness.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,350
Is the state by which you become you, again I say become

4
00:00:16,457 --> 00:00:18,920
- it's actualization, it is not just talking -

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,360
you become conscious collective,

6
00:00:21,493 --> 00:00:22,653
means you become

7
00:00:22,852 --> 00:00:26,253
conscious of another person's centers on your fingertips.

8
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:29,173
You also become Self aware,

9
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:30,813
you know about yourself,

10
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:33,853
what centers are catching, where are we going.

11
00:00:34,053 --> 00:00:39,293
Like a person who becomes mentally upset, he doesn’t know,

12
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,653
really becomes mad,

13
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:43,893
goes to lunatic asylum and dies, he does not know.

14
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:46,852
But in Sahaja Yoga immediately you can find out

15
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:50,173
that there’s something going wrong with your mental side.

16
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,613
If a person gets into cancer,

17
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:57,852
he might get, gets into the state of galloping cancer, about to die,

18
00:00:58,013 --> 00:01:00,053
then he may discover that he has got cancer.

19
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,613
But in Sahaja Yoga if there’s a little imbalance,

20
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,533
immediately it shows on your fingertips, and if you know

21
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:12,173
how to do it, how to correct it, then every problem is solved.

22
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:16,013
So as I told you yesterday, yoga has double meaning.

23
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:19,253
Yoga means union with the Divine, that’s one.

24
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:22,933
and the second one is the expertise, the depthness,

25
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,933
what we call in Sanskrit kaushalam.

26
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,813
You must have a depthness,

27
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:30,334
how to handle this all-pervading Power that is flowing through us,

28
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:33,933
how to understand ourselves, how to understand others,

29
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:38,053
that’s an important part of Sahaja Yoga.

30
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:41,773
First of al a little light is enlightened.

31
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:44,813
You get the experience of the Spirit to begin with.

32
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:46,693
It's an actualization.

33
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:49,413
But then you must make it grow.

34
00:01:49,613 --> 00:01:52,213
Christ has given beautiful parables

35
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:55,093
explaining this, the sprouting of the seeds,

36
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:57,693
which were thrown on the rocks,

37
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:02,013
some were thrown in the good soil and somewhere neglected.

38
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:04,733
And we find that everyday happening.

39
00:02:04,893 --> 00:02:07,693
Thousands come to My program and then I find

40
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:09,852
some of them are lost in the rocks,

41
00:02:10,013 --> 00:02:11,933
some of them are wasted,

42
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,693
but some of them become huge big trees

43
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:18,053
to give shade, joy and support to others.

44
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:19,973
We have to change this world.

45
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,053
How are we going to change this world, this horrible world

46
00:02:23,253 --> 00:02:27,013
which is just under precipices of destruction?

47
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:30,053
The only way is that we have to change ourselves.

48
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:33,253
That’s the transformation just waiting to happen.

49
00:02:33,334 --> 00:02:35,412
It's nothing that I am doing about you,

50
00:02:35,493 --> 00:02:37,813
I really tell you, I don’t do anything.

51
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:41,333
I don’t do anything, I’m just waiting to get it.

52
00:02:41,573 --> 00:02:43,613
You just catch upon it and you get it.

53
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:47,173
I’m maybe just triggering it, but you can trigger it also.

54
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:51,613
So one has to understand that you have to be honest to yourself,

55
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:53,493
you have to be fair to yourself.

56
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:56,613
You have to understand your value, you must know your worth,

57
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,852
that you are a human being created

58
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:02,253
out of small things like amoeba, from carbon,

59
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:04,773
and today you are sitting here as human beings,

60
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,933
you must be something very special.

61
00:03:07,133 --> 00:03:10,013
And this special thing has to become that thing

62
00:03:10,213 --> 00:03:12,813
which will make you understand what you are.

63
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,013
Only thing you are not yet connected.

64
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:19,973
Only thing is that you have not yet felt that divinity within you.

65
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:22,653
We are all potentially divine.

66
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,173
We have to just feel that divinity within us.

67
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:29,413
But as a result of that, you are such a powerful personality,

68
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:31,253
power of love.

69
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:34,453
We have never used the power of love,

70
00:03:34,653 --> 00:03:37,333
We have only used the power of hatred so far.

71
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:40,893
Power of love is much above power of hatred.

72
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:45,413
It can angle all hatred, can just

73
00:03:45,613 --> 00:03:48,013
suck in everything that is hatred.

74
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:51,573
It’s very simple. Very simple methods are to be put,

75
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,693
only you must have desire to get transformed.

76
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:59,213
Now the third thing that happens with Self Realization

77
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:06,293
is that you get a state of peace, of bliss and of joy.

78
00:04:07,852 --> 00:04:11,773
When the Kundalini rises above this Agnya chakra

79
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:14,613
you become thoughtlessly aware.

80
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:18,173
It's called as Nirvichara Samadhi. Thoughtlessly aware,

81
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:20,413
when there is no thought in your mind.

82
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:22,253
If you want, you can think.

83
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:24,813
If you want you can think, but if you don’t want,

84
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,533
you can be in that state when you don’t think.

85
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:29,493
Actually it’s maddening sometimes

86
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:33,333
the way man is thinking morning till evening,

87
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:37,453
yarns after yarns, useless things, a joyless pursuit.

88
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,852
But when this thinking stops, you are above the thoughts.

89
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:45,493
I would say to give it a similitude,

90
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:49,133
that the waves of thought come and go away.

91
00:04:49,493 --> 00:04:51,733
Another thought comes and goes away.

92
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:55,853
We are jumping on the cusp of the thought all the time

93
00:04:56,053 --> 00:05:02,053
Supposing we can just get

94
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:06,173
in the center of the thought,

95
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,693
that is the present.

96
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:12,733
If we can, could stop at the present moment,

97
00:05:12,893 --> 00:05:14,933
then we are not worried about the thoughts.

98
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,773
Like the waves of water, if you are in the waves,

99
00:05:17,933 --> 00:05:19,573
you are frightened of that.

100
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:21,693
But supposing you are in a boat

101
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:25,493
then you can see the waves and enjoy them.

102
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,933
In the same way what happens to you

103
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:34,533
that you jump up to a higher state of existence

104
00:05:34,733 --> 00:05:39,173
through which you see the thoughts

105
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,853
if you want, you don’t want to see you can, you need not see.

106
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:48,293
Now the thoughts that you see also, are very wide and deeper

107
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:50,453
where you get inspirations.

108
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:53,453
That’s why, as Dr. Warren has told you,

109
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,253
that your creativity improves.

110
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:59,813
You can become tremendously dynamic.

111
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:02,493
Because your time is not wasted in wasteful things.

112
00:06:02,693 --> 00:06:04,813
You just know this is it.

113
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:08,013
This is the exact, this is what we have to do.

114
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,973
And that’s how people get rid of

115
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:14,013
many of their problems of mental tensions.

116
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:17,693
There’s no tension at all. You don’t have any worries.

117
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:20,853
You just see the thing like the witness.

118
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:23,693
You become the witness of the whole drama.

119
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:25,093
When you are in the drama,

120
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:27,693
you think you are a part and parcel of the drama

121
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:30,013
sometimes you weep with it and cry with it.

122
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:33,453
But when the drama is over, you realize it was just a drama.

123
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:34,733
“I was not there”.

124
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,653
In the same way it happens to you,

125
00:06:36,852 --> 00:06:38,973
that you achieve a witness state.

126
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:43,133
It happens to you. Even if you want to get involved, you cannot.

127
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,773
You just cannot get it.

128
00:06:44,933 --> 00:06:46,933
That’s how you can solve the problems better

129
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,973
because you are away from the problems.

130
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:51,852
You can see what the problem is, but when you are in it,

131
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:55,973
you are upset, full of tension, worries,

132
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:59,573
and sometimes people get so upset with it

133
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:02,573
that they commit suicides, when they find no solution.

134
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,533
But if you are away from it,

135
00:07:04,733 --> 00:07:08,173
then you can definitely solve the problem.

136
00:07:08,893 --> 00:07:11,613
Now this witness state has to grow within you

137
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:16,733
gradually, with little understanding and with little meditation,

138
00:07:16,893 --> 00:07:20,013
which is very simple, which you can do very easily.

139
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:22,174
Nothing has to be done about.

140
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:25,253
But first thing you must know, it is actualization,

141
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:28,813
it is not your mental projection that is going to do anything.

142
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:32,973
Like we may say, "we are all brothers and sisters". We say so.

143
00:07:33,773 --> 00:07:36,613
But when it comes to wars, we become enemies.

144
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:39,693
Even in a family there are brothers and sisters,

145
00:07:39,852 --> 00:07:42,333
when it comes to property, they fight.

146
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:46,248
Not in Sahaja Yoga. You really become part and parcel of each other.
