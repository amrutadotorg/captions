SHRI MATAJI: Not that one.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.041
That's for Mataji Nirmala Devi, not for Shri Krishna.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.041
Before you come to America you must learn to take coke, isn't it?

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.542

who were looking after the herds of cows

00:55:12.083 --> 00:55:14.083
and He had to take the butter

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.542
and now when you come to America you have to take coke.

00:55:17.041 --> 00:55:21.000
Better to have diet-coke. [inaudible]

00:55:22.041 --> 00:55:27.041
And if you go to Italy you have to eat Pizzas.

00:55:31.041 --> 00:55:34.000
That's all the play.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Now,

A child should not be restless. It should be able to sit quiet,

otherwise it is not a good sign, especially in the Puja

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:34.542

ANOTHER YOGI: From Bethlehem.

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:22.125

YOGI: Like what? SHRI MATAJI: L ike Svastika.

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:32.208
YOGI: [inaudible] YOGIS: Like Svastika.

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:43.250
SHRI MATAJI: We have to do something about it,

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.125
no doubt, I agree with you ...

01:21:47.333 --> 01:21:53.083
May God bless you. Please work it out.

01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:59.333
You brought something. Why? She is been giving all things.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.333
May God bless you. YOGINI: I am extremely shivering,

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.083
SHRI MATAJI: Ah? YOGINI: I wanted to give you, to you in Italy,

01:22:05.208 --> 01:22:07.583
but I didn't, I couldn't think, Shri Mataji.

01:22:08.083 --> 01:22:11.083
SHRI MATAJI: Aha, that's beautiful.

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:14.125
You know in this one also from My face,

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:17.125
from when I am smiling the vibrations are coming out.

01:22:17.250 --> 01:22:21.291

01:22:23.041 --> 01:22:24.333
Yes. SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

01:22:28.083 --> 01:22:33.208
YOGI: Another copy? ANOTHERYOGI: The whole book.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.041
SHRI MATAJI: This is a beautiful photograph.

01:22:40.166 --> 01:22:43.125
I don't know how she got it, on the top of My head.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:47.083
YOGINI: Sahasrara-Day-Puja, Shri Mataji.

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:49.250
In Vienna.

01:22:52.041 --> 01:22:55.041
SHRI MATAJI: That's another one.

01:22:55.208 --> 01:22:59.208
She has done some very good photographs.

01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:03.250
And this one, can you beat it?

01:23:04.041 --> 01:23:07.250
YOGINI: That's Gregoires, Mother. SHRI MATAJI: It's Gregoires, but still

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.125
look at the red. This says automatically it came like that,

01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:14.208
like little [inaudible] which

01:23:14.333 --> 01:23:17.333
was not that red, but again it has come up.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.291
YOGI: It became red like Kumkum?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.125
SHRI MATAJI: Not Kumkum, it's red, shining red.

01:23:31.125 --> 01:23:35.125
This is another one, you see? YOGI: Ah?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:40.166
SHRI MATAJI: This Baby is crying.

01:23:45.125 --> 01:23:48.333
One better there, see this one.

01:23:57.166 --> 01:24:00.000
It is very beautifull photographs, I might [inaudible]. This is the one

01:24:00.125 --> 01:24:02.125
where We went up -

01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:05.125
YOGI: Ah Matterhorn, Matterhorn. SHRI MATAJI: Matterhorn.

01:24:05.250 --> 01:24:07.333
OGI: The same shape is India up side down. SHRI MATAJI: Yes,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.125
but it is actually Ganeshas faces, you see

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:14.208
there are Ganeshas, one Ganesha is like this, another

01:24:14.333 --> 01:24:16.333
like that, another like that.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.208
Four Ganeshas put together.

01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:25.291
This one is remarkable. How did you get My hair like that?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.125
YOGINI: Ah, You just moved it, I don't know, it came out [inaudible].

01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:32.041
YOGI: Nilachikurya. YOGINI: It's a ...

01:24:32.166 --> 01:24:34.291
SHRI MATAJI: Nilachikurya. YOGINI: Nagas

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.041
SHRI MATAJI: Nagas. YOGINI: Gregoire said Nagas.

01:24:38.208 --> 01:24:41.000
SHRI MATAJI: It's very nice, it is very beautiful, she has

01:24:41.125 --> 01:24:45.125
a talent for that.

01:24:46.041 --> 01:24:49.041
A real talent I must say.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.083
YOGI: We should publish a book of

01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:56.542
colour-photographs of You, Shri Mataji.

01:24:57.041 --> 01:24:59.291
SHRI MATAJI: Yeah. YOGIS: It would be a bestseller, Shri Mataji.

01:25:00.041 --> 01:25:03.250
SHRI MATAJI: This looks like as if I am sitting in the Himalayas

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:10.166
and it was not such a wild thing there, nothing, it's in a village.

01:25:11.208 --> 01:25:15.250
I can't explain it. This is another very beautiful.

01:25:19.291 --> 01:25:22.250
It's very nice, see that, very well.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.166
You all can go through it and see for yourself.

01:25:27.166 --> 01:25:29.166
Very beautiful.

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:44.250
What have you written? YOGINI: This is the translation in Italian,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.125
from Saundaryalahari from Adi Shankara Charya.

01:25:47.250 --> 01:25:50.291
SHRI MATAJI: Oh I see, but then who is going to tran-

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.166
which one it is you, just tell Me.

01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:54.125
YOGINI: It's all of it. SHRI MATAJI: Now I see.

01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:57.250
YOGINI: And we would like to publish it, publish it.

01:25:58.125 --> 01:26:01.333
SHRI MATAJI: Oh I ... YOGINI: It's all You.

01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:08.250
I couldn't written, I couldn't have written.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Complete.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Very beautiful.

01:26:19.125 --> 01:26:23.291
Very well done. May God bless you.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.333
So now it's over. Can I get that?

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.041
Angela, you have given a very beautiful present, I tell you,

01:26:42.166 --> 01:26:45.125
I have never seen one like that before.

01:26:45.250 --> 01:26:48.250
Your present was very beautifull, I have never seen something like that,

01:26:49.125 --> 01:26:52.250
that made out of hand, that kind of a shape I have not seen.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.291
Hands that I have seen, but to make something out of hands

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.250
is a very good idea. We can do it in India if you want to

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:04.000
but I don't think we try.

01:27:24.125 --> 01:27:27.250
Easy for you to get up, but for Me it is difficult.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.250
Now the feet have gone up complete blown up.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.208
YOGIS: Oh yes, oh, it's well enough, Shri Mataji, SHRI MATAJI:No shoes.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.041
YOGI: No shoes.

01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:47.166
YOGI: [inaudible]. SHRI MATAJI: You can take off the ornaments I think.

01:27:49.083 --> 01:27:53.125
I thank all of you very well, thank you.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.291
Put them together.

01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:20.041
I give you the Mangala-sutra.

01:28:38.125 --> 01:28:41.125
Yes, put it together.

01:29:02.041 --> 01:29:06.041
YOGIS: Bolo Shri Jagad Mata Shri Mataji ki - jay!

01:29:06.208 --> 01:29:11.125
Bolo Shri Viratangana Swamini Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi ki - jay!

01:29:11.250 --> 01:29:13.125
SHRI MATAJI: Ah, that's the names of the Goddess,

01:29:13.250 --> 01:29:18.208
as Virata-Viratangana.

01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:30.125
May God bless you.

01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:33.250
