00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:13.646
Sloth is such a devious thing that you do not see it.

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:17.042
It explains everything. If you say, “Oh I am sick”

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:21.471
it will say, “Oh you are so sick 
you should go to the hospital”.

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:25.644
If you say, “I’m tired” it will say, 
“You are extremely tired”.

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:31.439
Why should you be so tired? 
It is nothing but your Sloth is telling you that,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.505
“You are extremely tired, 
you better not do meditation

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:39.905
now you are extremely tired. 
You better take some rest, is important”.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:44.043
Sloth is worse than superego and ego.

00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:48.591
Is a kind of an inertia which pulls you down,

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:53.722
and that inertia you have to really throw away 
and get out of it.

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:59.869
Because it explains everything, you like it, 
because it gives you little comfort,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.012
and you want to rely on your Sloth.

00:01:04.213 --> 00:01:08.839
But Krishna has said in Gita, that Sloth is the worst thing

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.502
that can happen to human beings. If they take to Sloth,

00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:19.708
if they accept Sloth, they will have 
all explanations for being Slothful.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.637
He, “Alasya”, He calls it, is the worst disease 
according to Him,

00:01:23.838 --> 00:01:28.530
for any aspirant of spiritual life.

00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:35.186
You may think that, “You see, I’m not well now”

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:38.058
or anything, Sloth can give you any ideas.

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.212
Because I don’t have that 
so I don’t know what ideas it gives you

00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:47.561
but it can give you any kind of idea 
that would be very, very appealing to you

00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:50.498
because it knows how to please your ego.

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:57.008
Sloth is a ego-satisfying thing, ego-pampering stuff,

00:01:57.089 --> 00:02:00.698
and it makes you feel that, “Oh you are very tired”. 
What are you tired about?

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.220
You are all young people, why should you be tired?

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.817
You get tired so soon, is nothing but your Mr. Sloth 
telling you you are tired.

00:02:10.018 --> 00:02:15.984
You'll be surprised, after feeling tired 
you'll run for two miles, you can run.

00:02:16.293 --> 00:02:24.820
Now why Sloth works Sahaja Yoga so adversely?

00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:29.543
Why Sloth works out against Sahaja Yoga so much?

00:02:29.744 --> 00:02:36.805
The reason is, because we are not yet 
identified with our wellbeing.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:40.850
We do not think that 
“We have to be better, we have to improve,

00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:45.212
we have to go further, there’s a big gap, 
we have to do it”.

00:02:45.413 --> 00:02:50.945
We are not identified with our progress. 
Supposing if I tell you, in England,

00:02:51.146 --> 00:02:56.110
that if you run two miles every day in the morning, 
you will get a beauty prize,

00:02:56.311 --> 00:03:03.809
99.9% people, of women of this country, 
would be running early in the morning.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.930
Supposing if somebody tells men

00:03:08.145 --> 00:03:14.112
that, “You will get Mr. Universe if you run 
every day five miles in the morning”,

00:03:14.313 --> 00:03:20.533
there will be, I don’t know, 99.999% people 
may be running like that,

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:23.740
because we are identified 
with that kind of a competition

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.213
which is very materialistic, which is of no value.

00:03:31.414 --> 00:03:36.292
But when you give up even that competition 
you fall into another competition

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:40.476
is everybody is competing each other in Sloth.

00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:44.116
They will get up in the morning, see around,

00:03:44.317 --> 00:03:47.607
“Now, Cooly’s still sleeping, all right, let me sleep”.

00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:51.181
So Cooly will think, “He’s still sleeping, let me sleep”.

00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:59.118
So there is a big competition on as to 
who is going to wake up first,

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.825
who is going to do this.

00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:07.259
And if somebody gets up then one starts finding faults that, 
“He got up but what?

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.105
He was just taking tea” or “He was talking”.

00:04:10.306 --> 00:04:12.220
What about you? You were still in bed!

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.391
At least he got up, was talking, doesn’t matter. 
But he was kicking.

00:04:16.592 --> 00:04:21.107
What about you who was still slumbering in the bed?

00:04:21.308 --> 00:04:25.360
Now it’s such a childlike thing, I mean, 
it’s such a childish thing to talk about

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.338
with such intellectuals as you are, 
such well read and such well posted people.

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.292
That doesn’t behove Me, 
a Mother of such great people, to talk like this,

00:04:35.493 --> 00:04:40.951
but sometimes I find My Sahaja Yogis 
are like two year old children,

00:04:41.152 --> 00:04:46.054
and then I have to tell them that, 
“Now you are grown up”.
