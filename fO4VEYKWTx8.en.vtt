00:00:01.104 --> 00:00:09.290
... is the principle of that
pulsating part, that power within us,

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.170
which we have to feel, and
which pulsates in everything.

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:19.500
It happens with Sahaja Yoga, no
doubt, that the Kundalini rises,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:30.801
but that is not the end of it, because human being
is the instrument in which this light is manifested.

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:36.849
But once it is manifested it is not necessary
that it would be all the time burning properly.

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:48.399
There is a possibility, mostly it is a
possibility, that the light can go out.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.385
If a wind upside is against it, then it can go out.

00:00:53.415 --> 00:01:00.215
It can also subside a little bit. It may come
out it may flicker, it may dwindle a little bit.

00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:15.064
Because human beings, as they are, they
have got into three complications.

00:01:17.103 --> 00:01:23.906
As soon as they become human beings these three complications start in them.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:33.117
And because of three, these three complications, one has to know that if you have to get out of that you have to break certain knots.

00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:41.899
They are called as granthis in the Sanskrit language — which are giving you this falsehood — is the vitathat (वितथता)

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.055
Falsehood that we think that you see, “In
this world, after all everything is science,

00:01:47.097 --> 00:01:52.315
and everything is what we see and everything beyond…”
And all those sorts of things are really false

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.785
because, unless and until you rise
into Reality, you believe in them.

00:01:55.785 --> 00:02:01.283
After all what is God? And what is all this
talk of religion? What is the talk of Christ?

00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:03.033
And what is the talk of all these things?

00:02:03.057 --> 00:02:13.638
So all these problems become sort of identified with you.
Absolutely you believe in the falsehood all the time.

00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:18.179
You are more concerned about the
falsehood than about the truth.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:24.457
Even if you are concerned about the truth,
when you are born with the seeker’s mind,

00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:27.537
then you try to seek and you try to
think of something that is beyond,

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.247
you try to understand

00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:32.438
that there must be something
beyond and something must happen.

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:36.388
But still, you see, you are bound

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:40.726
by these three complications
in life, by which ...

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:45.136
these three complications we
accept the world as it is.

00:02:45.153 --> 00:02:49.116
Because we do not know the Reality. The
problem is we do not know the Reality.

00:02:49.116 --> 00:02:55.636
Till we come inside the Reality, we
really do not know even what is Reality.

00:02:55.676 --> 00:03:02.936
What is the basic substance
of our being, how do we live,

00:03:02.977 --> 00:03:09.917
what is the subtle being, how do we live and what is our aim, what we have to fulfil?

00:03:09.917 --> 00:03:13.357
All these questions are very vague in our mind.

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:17.921
Then we start seeking here and there, we go
round here and there and try to find out.

00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:24.051
We talk to people, we read books and especially
we go to books which are philosophical

00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:32.560
and try to find out about what
must be done about Reality.

00:03:32.565 --> 00:03:37.535
Why are we drawn towards this? Why are we not happy? Why do we feel dissatisfied in life?

00:03:37.581 --> 00:03:41.018
Why do we all the time
hanker after sometimes,

00:03:41.018 --> 00:03:47.231
something and we do not feel fulfilled within ourselves and, why don’t we understand the meaning of our own being?

00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:49.341
Why are we driven like this?

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:51.141
All these questions come to us…

00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:52.361
Please come in!

00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:59.461
All these questions come to us
and we start seeking about it.

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:05.480
And actually our priorities, before
we get into it, are so false

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.871
because we do not know Reality.

00:04:07.877 --> 00:04:10.377
So I mean, it’s not your fault, itself,

00:04:10.377 --> 00:04:16.087
if you do not know Reality, and then naturally…For example, somebody, to catch the train itself is very important,

00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:19.439
then to go in time is very important,
then to get some money is important

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.999
and to get to a house is important, and
then to have some children is important.

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:27.169
All these things become very much
more important than they should be.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:31.241
While the main thing, that is to seek within yourself:

00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:35.055
the point of what are we to seek
and what is so important about it,

00:04:35.055 --> 00:04:38.145
that every scripture
has talked about this,

00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:42.019
that you must seek within yourself,
you must find out yourself who you are.

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:46.100
What is the reason? Why all of
them have been so much stressing?

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.140
So until you enter into it you will not know.

00:04:51.158 --> 00:04:56.054
It is such a vicious circle, because of these
three complications I was telling you about.

00:04:56.076 --> 00:05:03.016
Because if, as it is described, that your
Spirit is absolutely a detached personality,

00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:11.776
it’s a detached being; it is not contaminated by
anything. It is absolutely complete by itself.

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:15.336
It is joy, it is bliss, it is the truth.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.027
And where are we then?

00:05:17.027 --> 00:05:23.577
Why are we in such a mood that we have something very important for us in our life,

00:05:23.587 --> 00:05:26.087
very special for us?

00:05:26.087 --> 00:05:32.857
We think that, “Oh, this must be done. I must
get myself insured! I must do these things.”

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.617
Then why, if that Spirit is such a powerful
thing, then what is the complication?

00:05:38.617 --> 00:05:45.310
What are the complications we have and
how do we get rid of these complications?

00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:52.990
Through your evolution from the amoeba stage, you can say, even from the absolutely from the, we call it the jad, the dead,

00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:58.000
from the absolutely from the
material stage to this state,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.308
it has achieved quite a
lot of detachment in a way.

00:06:01.308 --> 00:06:07.246
The detachment has come in a way that
you understand that you are not the dead;

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.520
no, you are not. That much at least
everybody knows, that you are not.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.690
There are so many things
you are identified with

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.440
but at least you know
that you are not dead.

00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:23.000
With the growth of materialism and by
changing matter and its forms and all that,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.180
then you realise one more thing: that
matter doesn’t give us happiness.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.907
I mean many people through
evolution realise it:

00:06:29.911 --> 00:06:34.627
that matter is not the end of our lives
and it is not going to give us happiness.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.571
Then, in the subtler form,
when you evolve even more,

00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:43.740
then you go into the arts and
the beauty of the matter:

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:49.349
then you start seeing little deeper
than what the matter means to you,

00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:57.931
and you start thinking about its beauty,
its forms, its combinations and its harmony.

00:06:57.928 --> 00:07:01.538
So the subtleties
about matter develop,

00:07:01.538 --> 00:07:05.838
up to a point, through your
rationality and understanding,

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:13.058
that you realise that this is... this
art, also has its finite nature:

00:07:13.058 --> 00:07:15.278
I mean how far can you go with it?

00:07:15.278 --> 00:07:20.218
And even if you have art and you become an artist and you are aesthetically very rich…

00:07:20.238 --> 00:07:26.278
there are people who can be called as masters of art and those who are really aesthetically evolved people,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:30.658
but if you go and see their lives you get a shock you realise what kind of artists are these?

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:36.398
I mean, they are producing art and beautiful things and nothing goes inside! They are very materialistic,

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:41.878
they can be mad people or they can
be absolutely obnoxiously boring.

00:07:41.898 --> 00:07:47.888
So why is it that these artists, you see
those who are creating all this,

00:07:47.888 --> 00:07:53.898
supposed to be something which is joy-giving, are so boring themselves and nothing goes inside them!

00:07:53.898 --> 00:07:59.718
And apart from that they are so oppressive,
and so much sometimes can be very egoistical

00:07:59.718 --> 00:08:06.895
or can be very, very methodical or meticulous and they could be absolutely mathematical about things.

00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:11.136
You start understanding that they are
not that abstract, as they produce.

00:08:11.136 --> 00:08:15.296
You see, they give some ideas, some
projections they do, but they may not be so.

00:08:15.331 --> 00:08:16.846
So again you start thinking:

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.125
how is it that this matter, which
has gone to this subtle state,

00:08:21.134 --> 00:08:23.585
which is called as art and artists,

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:30.570
why is it that this matter has not anything
in it to offer us of that eternal value

00:08:30.587 --> 00:08:34.930
or of that nature which is promised
to us through our scriptures?

00:08:34.943 --> 00:08:39.030
So some people do at this point,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:46.813
definitely they step over, I would say,
or they just collapse on that point.

00:08:46.811 --> 00:08:50.161
In the sense then they think, “Oh,
then there is nothing like scriptures.

00:08:50.161 --> 00:08:55.361
It’s all a mess. It’s all wrong. There may
not be anything. It’s a tall story told to us.

00:08:55.381 --> 00:09:00.321
And there may not be any truth about it, that
there is all pervading power and there is this God

00:09:00.316 --> 00:09:02.557
and you can become one with
God. It cannot be true.

00:09:02.596 --> 00:09:07.507
After all you can see that there is
so much of poverty in this world,

00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:11.597
there is so much of pain in this world, people are so unhappy, how can there be a God

00:09:11.587 --> 00:09:14.027
Who can tolerate all this?”

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.000
I get letters of that kind
many a times, you see,

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:20.520
that, “How people are so unhappy
and they are this and that

00:09:20.544 --> 00:09:24.885
and then how can you talk of God?”

00:09:24.911 --> 00:09:28.235
So this is the one complication we have

00:09:28.235 --> 00:09:30.865
and this is the complication
comes in, because

00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:39.976
the Atma, the Spirit, is enveloped
by our attention into the matter;

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:44.372
because the matter has risen, our
attention has come from matter,

00:09:44.374 --> 00:09:50.222
and it has risen up to a
point where there is a knot

00:09:50.226 --> 00:09:56.914
by which we cannot see the
Spirit but we see the matter.

00:09:56.932 --> 00:09:59.985
This knot, I mean there’s a
big controversy about names.

00:09:59.995 --> 00:10:04.985
I would not like you to confuse it but we
can say like that, this knot is the knot

00:10:05.005 --> 00:10:15.374
which is the knot between
the Spirit and the matter,

00:10:15.393 --> 00:10:21.358
which is called as jad-prakruti (जड
प्रकृति) in the Sanskrit language.

00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:25.859
This is the first knot which
is a very difficult knot.

00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:28.409
We think, “This jug is mine.”

00:10:28.409 --> 00:10:30.329
And we think, “This chair is mine.”

00:10:30.308 --> 00:10:33.989
Even if somebody offers you a
chair, “Come along sit here!”

00:10:34.021 --> 00:10:36.161
and the another person is sitting
little bit lower, she’ll say, “Oh,

00:10:36.182 --> 00:10:39.351
she has given her a
chair which is higher!”

00:10:39.368 --> 00:10:44.848
All kinds of complications human beings
have! You know, it’s very delicate they are.

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:52.267
They are so foolishly, sometimes, identified with things, like supposing a person…if you go more and more in the politics now,

00:10:52.267 --> 00:10:55.627
there’s a prime minister and he thinks
that someone is sitting on a chair,

00:10:55.642 --> 00:11:01.067
and he thinks that somebody is going to occupy that chair, then you see, all kinds of funny things start in his mind

00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:06.107
and all kinds of complications start. And he
thinks that he’ll be dislodged from that chair

00:11:06.107 --> 00:11:10.487
by which he’s been a prime minister, so he
starts working out his own plans and things.

00:11:10.487 --> 00:11:12.987
I mean the priorities are so much changed!

00:11:12.987 --> 00:11:16.511
Then you will start, sort of what
you call, canvassing for him

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:18.411
and everybody going
for an election,

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:19.718
and everybody fighting.

00:11:19.718 --> 00:11:23.408
I mean, the whole world is a
madhouse at these things you see:

00:11:23.408 --> 00:11:27.558
how to achieve that chair, that position,
by which he can become the prime minister.

00:11:27.589 --> 00:11:29.842
And the other one doesn’t come.
The other side working it out

00:11:29.842 --> 00:11:34.809
and, you see, it is very ‘important’. But what is
he putting on the chair, is another dead stuff.

00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:37.329
You see one dead is adorned by another dead.

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:43.147
He’s dead as far as so many things are
concerned which are thought as the truth,

00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:47.107
because he doesn’t know the truth. Now
supposing you make somebody as a high priest.

00:11:47.114 --> 00:11:49.154
Now he is a high priest on a chair.

00:11:49.155 --> 00:11:55.034
To me, I see one dead thing sitting
on another dead thing, that’s all.

00:11:55.054 --> 00:11:59.964
Because the chair doesn’t understand these things, the one
who’s put on the chair doesn’t understand anything either,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.027
because it hasn’t got the
awareness to see what is the truth.

00:12:03.027 --> 00:12:06.657
So what’s the use of doing
such a jocular thing?

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:11.874
It’s really a joke, but people are very
serious about it indeed. Very serious things,

00:12:11.874 --> 00:12:16.224
absolutely, they do all kinds of things
for these elections. It’s so serious,

00:12:16.224 --> 00:12:19.004
but if you stand from this angle

00:12:19.004 --> 00:12:24.524
and you should see that you start looking at it and you say, “What’s this? I never expected. What’s all going on?”

00:12:24.524 --> 00:12:26.714
You see, it’s quite silly.

00:12:26.729 --> 00:12:30.861
But we have to accept it
because we have misidentified

00:12:30.861 --> 00:12:34.281
through this one granthi, or
you can call it this knot

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:40.985
of the jadaprakruthi or what
you call as this matter.

00:12:41.001 --> 00:12:47.830
Now for a Sahaja Yogi it is essential to see how far he is identified with his jadaprakruthi.

00:12:47.877 --> 00:12:52.550
It’s very important to see how
far is he identified with his,

00:12:52.550 --> 00:13:01.219
what you call the attachment or
the covering of this deadening.

00:13:01.265 --> 00:13:05.689
All that is subconscious is, all
what you call conditioning, is done.

00:13:05.689 --> 00:13:08.499
Everything that is dead is dead.

00:13:08.532 --> 00:13:17.462
Whether it is your dead matter or a
dead thought, it’s just the same.

00:13:17.481 --> 00:13:23.301
And the more you hover on it. You see, there are silly people I have known: I mean they have come to me in their thing.

00:13:23.301 --> 00:13:28.341
You see, supposing a wife has died, say
about thirty-five years back. Alright?

00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:30.861
So he is here weeping and crying,

00:13:30.861 --> 00:13:35.581
writing poetry about her. She’s dead about twenty-five years back. She might have been reborn as a child somewhere

00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:38.391
or something like that. He can’t
marry her again, nothing of the kind,

00:13:38.406 --> 00:13:42.901
but he’s writing poetry about her, crying and
weeping. And he expects everybody to weep.

00:13:42.901 --> 00:13:46.011
There are people, I have seen, they
sit down and they just weep about it.

00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:55.181
They just play records and things, melancholy things and just wasting all their precious tears on something that is dead and finished.

00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:58.009
Now, there’s no need to weep about
it, but they’ll go on like that

00:13:58.009 --> 00:14:01.969
and they enjoy such a thing very much
and they appreciate it very much.

00:14:01.996 --> 00:14:06.986
It’s most surprising! But people go on
wasting their energy, they enjoy it in a way,

00:14:07.016 --> 00:14:12.886
the way it is written down, the
whole melancholy of singing their

00:14:12.914 --> 00:14:18.986
damaged experiences and
remembering them in your memory.

00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:25.543
Whatever was false, actually should become
nothing in your mind when you reach Reality.

00:14:25.543 --> 00:14:30.043
So the memory in a Sahaja Yogi

00:14:30.053 --> 00:14:34.463
is of no value, much value. Because
whatever he had, was in a dead condition.

00:14:34.483 --> 00:14:38.123
He was not sensitive to
All-pervading Power at that time.

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:40.649
He was just dealing with dead stuff, you see.

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:43.746
And that was what I was surprised
when many people told me

00:14:43.746 --> 00:14:48.426
that, “Mother, after becoming a Sahaja Yogi now we can’t read any more melancholy poets.”

00:14:48.449 --> 00:14:52.229
I said, “Thank God a lot of time
is now saved for meditation!”

00:14:52.229 --> 00:14:57.469
Otherwise imagine all of them coming
with very melancholy faces to me,

00:14:57.482 --> 00:15:00.712
and saying that, “Mother you
know, this poet has written…”

00:15:00.727 --> 00:15:04.107
Already there are bombardments of people
who read all kinds of books, that,

00:15:04.107 --> 00:15:08.407
“Why such a person should write like that? And why such a person should write like that?”

00:15:08.452 --> 00:15:12.317
In the same way they would say, why
is such a person like Lord Byron?

00:15:12.317 --> 00:15:13.722
I don’t even see
his face you see,

00:15:13.722 --> 00:15:17.652
when we pass that way! I say he’s
really melancholia personified!

00:15:17.682 --> 00:15:23.154
And he made everybody miserable himself! What was he crying about? I mean if you see his life: whom did he make happy?

00:15:23.154 --> 00:15:27.514
He made everyone happy, and was crying all
the time and still making everybody unhappy?

00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:33.244
So this kind of a person is there! All this
is dead and takes you towards the dead.

00:15:33.251 --> 00:15:38.403
So dead and dead things can
never give you happiness.

00:15:39.883 --> 00:15:43.561
On the contrary it gives you
habits, they give you habits.

00:15:43.561 --> 00:15:49.860
And these habits come to you like, say, you are habituated to sit on the chair, you cannot sit on the ground.

00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:53.051
Now if I tell the Sahaja Yogis they
must learn to sit on the ground

00:15:53.071 --> 00:15:56.270
they will immediately start that, “We must sit on the ground!” That’s not the point!

00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:59.849
What I am saying the habit the chair
has given should be got rid of.

00:15:59.844 --> 00:16:02.864
But for that you don’t waste your
energies, for heaven’s sake!

00:16:02.864 --> 00:16:08.194
Because if I say that then you shouldn’t try wasting your energy in getting rid of the habits that were there.

00:16:08.194 --> 00:16:14.620
On the contrary if you put your attention
to your Spirit, to what you have achieved,

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:18.100
to where you are, gradually you’ll find
your habits will drop out like that.

00:16:18.114 --> 00:16:24.215
You have known that. We have had alcoholics with us here; terrible alcoholics who could not give up alcohol,

00:16:24.215 --> 00:16:25.544
and they have given up.

00:16:25.534 --> 00:16:29.354
We have had people who have taken drugs;
they have given up without any difficulties.

00:16:29.413 --> 00:16:35.679
Cigarettes they have given up. I mean there are also some higher vices and bigger vices also people have given up.

00:16:35.713 --> 00:16:39.399
And some vices which one cannot
mention, people have given up.

00:16:39.422 --> 00:16:43.123
So this happens when your
attention goes to your Spirit.

00:16:43.123 --> 00:16:47.033
And this is a very big
detachment that comes to you

00:16:47.052 --> 00:16:55.713
through your ascent, into that realm
where you feel the All-pervading.

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:58.233
Means automatically
your detachment works.

00:16:58.233 --> 00:17:06.273
Means your attention has felt, definitely, that oneness with Reality. Otherwise why are you getting detached?

00:17:06.273 --> 00:17:11.473
And spontaneously it happens. Suddenly you’ve matured so much. Sahaja Yogis matured so fast.

00:17:11.473 --> 00:17:16.303
I mean it’s a jet-like maturity, I think. Because
when they rise nobody understands, you see.

00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:19.127
Whenever they say something people
say, “What are you talking about?”

00:17:19.127 --> 00:17:23.777
Because they are at such a different level that others just don’t understand what they are talking about,

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:25.775
and they find it very
difficult to understand.

00:17:25.775 --> 00:17:30.723
Easiest thing, whatever they talk, the others say, “What, what are you saying about, we don’t follow?”

00:17:30.745 --> 00:17:35.313
So the attention when it enters
into that, your habits drop out.

00:17:35.313 --> 00:17:39.690
But for that it is essential that your
attention should be on your Spirit.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:46.273
Now what is the beauty of Spirit for a Sahaja Yogi? What does he get out of the Spirit? What is the manifestation of Spirit is?

00:17:46.273 --> 00:17:54.397
That when his attention is absolutely
one with the Atman, with the Spirit,

00:17:54.397 --> 00:18:00.767
then there is a manifestation of vibrations.
You start getting cool breeze in your hands.

00:18:00.777 --> 00:18:09.801
Now these vibrations are there from the very beginning of the matter, up to the vibrations where you come up to a human level.

00:18:09.828 --> 00:18:13.620
So you can call them, these are
like, electromagnetic vibrations.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:19.768
But when they go on improving. You see, in the
beginning, they just look like electromagnetic,

00:18:19.768 --> 00:18:23.202
then they look like more. There
is emotions in it, you see.

00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:28.060
Then you go little ahead, then you
find that these vibrations also act.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.440
These vibrations also
think, they also report.

00:18:31.468 --> 00:18:35.988
So, you see, gradually you will find
that with the growth of human being,

00:18:35.988 --> 00:18:37.328
as a human being from matter,

00:18:37.328 --> 00:18:42.298
these vibrations have also manifested
into different categories.

00:18:42.327 --> 00:18:46.712
To begin with, these vibrations are only
electromagnetic, you can say, in the matter.

00:18:46.712 --> 00:18:53.667
Say if you have Sulphur Dioxide as a molecule you will find sulphur and dioxide both are vibrating all the time like that.

00:18:53.693 --> 00:18:57.483
But when it goes on manifesting
more and more. That’s the basics,

00:18:57.482 --> 00:19:07.833
then gradually the manifestation of these higher things can be perceived through our understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:07.833 --> 00:19:11.107
But for a normal person it is only electromagnetic.

00:19:11.107 --> 00:19:17.507
Now supposing a matter, which is, say,
just a matter, say a dead matter, it is.

00:19:17.507 --> 00:19:20.877
Now it is not aware that it has
got vibrations to begin with.

00:19:20.877 --> 00:19:22.557
It is not aware.

00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:27.507
It doesn’t even think about it. I mean, it has
no awareness at all of any kind, it’s just dead.

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:32.717
So, but there are vibrations, there are
electromagnetic vibrations, but it is not aware.

00:19:32.717 --> 00:19:38.691
Now supposing such a dead matter, if you tell that dead matter that you have vibrations it will say, “What are you talking about?

00:19:38.699 --> 00:19:41.999
I have never felt!” But
somebody else can feel it,

00:19:41.999 --> 00:19:49.204
that there are electromagnetic vibrations. In the same way every human being has got these vibrations within him in the Spirit.

00:19:49.202 --> 00:19:53.584
But they are only manifested
when he gets Realisation.

00:19:53.655 --> 00:20:01.295
So, the second category of the same thing, the same vibrations, start expressing higher and higher qualities about it.

00:20:01.295 --> 00:20:10.360
Like from one seed a tree grows and the flowers come out, and they give fragrance: like that the growth is more and more.

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:15.975
But the basic is electromagnetic
vibrations that you can feel it everywhere

00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:19.445
in the matter with your naked
eyes, a human being can see it.

00:20:19.445 --> 00:20:25.225
Now see your own growth. Have you recognised it that animals don’t know that there are electromagnetic vibrations,

00:20:25.225 --> 00:20:28.245
but human beings have?

00:20:28.284 --> 00:20:38.318
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that there are not only electromagnetic but there are all kinds of manifestations of these vibrations.

00:20:38.318 --> 00:20:44.668
So electromagnetic are important at a point and then other vibrations are even much more important.

00:20:44.688 --> 00:20:53.408
So all these vibrations are coming, combined together, absolutely completely, in a human being, which they manifest gradually.

00:20:53.472 --> 00:20:57.932
And they act according
to the need of the time.

00:20:57.932 --> 00:21:03.402
So much so that in these vibrations
there is somebody who thinks,

00:21:03.402 --> 00:21:05.902
the vibrations who think,

00:21:05.902 --> 00:21:08.072
the vibrations who cooperate,

00:21:08.072 --> 00:21:11.312
who cure,

00:21:11.346 --> 00:21:14.232
who relay things, who report things.

00:21:14.232 --> 00:21:21.526
All that you think in the human awareness that you are doing it, like telecommunications, you have got big telecommunications:

00:21:21.526 --> 00:21:27.614
sitting down here you can say show some things that are happening in India or something like that.

00:21:27.614 --> 00:21:34.356
In the same way these vibrations can report things to you. The complete telecommunication is built in these vibrations!

00:21:34.356 --> 00:21:38.016
Then you can cure people
sitting down here.

00:21:38.051 --> 00:21:41.643
You can raise their
kundalinis sitting down here.

00:21:41.671 --> 00:21:48.983
You can work out on people sitting down here.
All these far fetched things are possible.

00:21:48.993 --> 00:21:53.110
Those who have been Sahaja Yogis have
realised it and seen it and worked it out.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:59.780
And it’s most surprising. Now we have a lady here sitting down: her husband used to drink a lot, everybody knows the story very well.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:06.946
And we just sent some vibrations and he’s stopped his drinking. He stopped his drinking.

00:22:06.986 --> 00:22:14.696
And just to convince that through vibrations it was done I used something which is very simple, is a lime, is a living lime.

00:22:14.726 --> 00:22:16.708
And we put our vibrations into that

00:22:16.714 --> 00:22:19.118
and we put them near
the head of the patient

00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:24.158
and they suck the negativity of the
person and the person gives up drinking.

00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:27.446
You have seen one boy who used
to come here, a little boy,

00:22:27.453 --> 00:22:32.036
who would run all over the places and
would not sit down even for a minute.

00:22:32.036 --> 00:22:33.826
He was possessed, he was horrid.

00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:36.922
And now he’s a sensible boy.
He’s started going to school.

00:22:36.952 --> 00:22:39.452
He never used to utter even a
word, now he’s started speaking.

00:22:39.472 --> 00:22:41.894
So all these things happened with the lime?

00:22:41.894 --> 00:22:45.840
Now he said, “How is it, Mother,
a lime is such a thing now?”

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:55.103
For a very, sort of, up to date person, it is a little funny to see limes being used for vibrations!

00:22:55.119 --> 00:23:00.309
But they are actually ultra-modern
things you know, they are ultra-modern.

00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:01.683
I am not talking of only modern

00:23:01.683 --> 00:23:05.483
but ultra-modern things are limes;
are the very ultra-modern things.

00:23:05.504 --> 00:23:07.967
Because you vibrate the ultra-modern limes

00:23:07.975 --> 00:23:13.187
by your vibrations, and you
put them under the pillow.

00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:15.514
Now these limes have a speciality.

00:23:15.514 --> 00:23:18.714
And this have been found out by
many people long time back:

00:23:18.714 --> 00:23:22.934
that they have a speciality to suck in the vibrations and contain the vibrations

00:23:22.939 --> 00:23:25.695
or to, not only electromagnetic,

00:23:25.712 --> 00:23:30.365
but quite a lot of vibrations can be in it, because
they are living and they have a coefficience.

00:23:30.394 --> 00:23:32.634
They have a kind of coefficience

00:23:32.644 --> 00:23:35.254
by which they suck in
these vibrations in them,

00:23:35.274 --> 00:23:40.684
and then they relay, they throw these
vibrations whenever it is necessary.

00:23:40.684 --> 00:23:42.347
It's not the limes that do it

00:23:42.368 --> 00:23:46.697
but the vibrations who are contained in
them that they do. How? I will tell you.

00:23:46.715 --> 00:23:49.215
You can think of a battery being created.

00:23:49.215 --> 00:23:51.875
You create a battery. Now the battery cannot do anything

00:23:51.883 --> 00:23:55.725
but if you take the battery near
some points then it starts working,

00:23:55.746 --> 00:24:00.346
because it is inside it. In the same
way we really make it into a battery.

00:24:00.386 --> 00:24:03.566
When they are near the heads of
the people, these limes, you see.

00:24:03.566 --> 00:24:07.686
They are doing nothing, but these vibrations
come out and they start working it out.

00:24:07.726 --> 00:24:10.906
It’s a perfect team. They do
it, they know, they are perfect.

00:24:10.906 --> 00:24:14.246
You don’t have to tell them. They
understand much more than you do.

00:24:14.246 --> 00:24:16.092
They are controlled much better

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:21.156
and they know how to find the
ways to extract the negativity,

00:24:21.156 --> 00:24:23.561
which sounds very
funny to other people.

00:24:23.582 --> 00:24:27.791
That’s why I tell all the Sahaja Yogis,
“Don’t give out all the secrets just now.

00:24:27.791 --> 00:24:33.182
Let them come in slowly. Let them settle down,
let them get vibrations and then we’ll talk.”

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.721
Because I have seen if you not only talk,

00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:38.891
but if they see that I am handling
some limes, some people run away,

00:24:38.891 --> 00:24:41.281
thinking that it’s all
hocus-pocus, you see.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.780
They don’t want to believe
in it. Really it is a fact!

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.540
Because people believe in
some sort of a funny thing.

00:24:46.552 --> 00:24:48.801
Supposing I have big circus

00:24:48.809 --> 00:24:50.707
and all those things
that the people do,

00:24:50.733 --> 00:24:56.109
I don’t know what all they do, but some sort
of a funny thing, you see, they like it.

00:24:56.117 --> 00:24:58.252
For example, if I make
you all jump on your heads

00:24:58.274 --> 00:25:01.792
and shout loudly and make
some nuisance out of it

00:25:01.824 --> 00:25:04.842
there will be thousands coming
to this group I can assure you.

00:25:04.848 --> 00:25:09.306
But, if you see, you are
really knowing about Reality

00:25:09.312 --> 00:25:12.926
and if you are handling the vibrations
within you people won’t come.

00:25:12.936 --> 00:25:17.767
And that’s why many people go to that. Why?

00:25:17.767 --> 00:25:22.136
Because the same, the complication, the
complication is still at work you see.

00:25:22.166 --> 00:25:24.666
So to please them you have
to use the complications.

00:25:24.666 --> 00:25:27.291
And those who do not want

00:25:27.306 --> 00:25:31.146
people to know Reality or those who
I would say do not know Reality,

00:25:31.186 --> 00:25:35.726
those people who just want to make use
of all this, they use this complication.

00:25:35.726 --> 00:25:42.612
So they try on human beings and that’s how they trap the disciples and that’s how they manage thousands of people

00:25:42.612 --> 00:25:46.240
bringing money and giving them honour

00:25:46.271 --> 00:25:50.370
and all those things which are useless
for a person who has known Reality.

00:25:50.376 --> 00:25:54.352
For him money makes no difference. I mean
he understands the joke of the money

00:25:54.355 --> 00:25:57.342
and he understands the
joke of everything else.

00:25:57.366 --> 00:26:02.086
But those who want to use this complication...

00:26:02.086 --> 00:26:07.928
So this one is described, I mean... I will
use the name that was used by Shankaracharya,

00:26:07.928 --> 00:26:12.518
because you see everybody is not a
realised-soul and of a great authority,

00:26:12.546 --> 00:26:18.681
but we have to have some people as authority. So Shankaracharya has called this as Brahmagranthi he calls it Brahmagranthi.

00:26:18.681 --> 00:26:25.016
Brahmagranthi he says, because the Brahma
is the vibrating force, Brahma is Om.

00:26:25.066 --> 00:26:26.379
That is the vibrating force,

00:26:26.379 --> 00:26:34.599
because it’s the vibrations, that’s
why he calls it as the Brahmagranthi.

00:26:34.606 --> 00:26:40.021
Now the second one is the one by which
we think that we can do something.

00:26:40.071 --> 00:26:46.171
Now this one is the superego one, the first one I told you about: creates the superego, this granthi, the knot, you see..

00:26:46.191 --> 00:26:48.451
How do you have a knot?

00:26:48.461 --> 00:26:51.971
I’ll give you an example of a
balloon, say, for example, a balloon.

00:26:51.971 --> 00:26:54.482
Now a balloon has lots of air in it,

00:26:54.482 --> 00:26:59.882
but it will all pass out, it won’t be
there, if there is no knot there, you see.

00:26:59.901 --> 00:27:03.136
But if there is a knot you can hold the balloon all right.

00:27:03.136 --> 00:27:06.411
And this is the balloon we have in
our head which we call as superego,

00:27:06.421 --> 00:27:10.551
which we can see here
clearly. Can you show them?

00:27:10.551 --> 00:27:13.863
The black one, you know. The
black, real one, is this one:

00:27:13.863 --> 00:27:20.471
is the superego by which you get possessed, and
you get all mad and you do all kinds of things.

00:27:20.503 --> 00:27:23.003
This is the Brahmagranthi. This knot is there.

00:27:23.003 --> 00:27:29.483
And this knot, you see, first
starts at the Mooladhara. Now...

00:27:29.536 --> 00:27:34.433
It starts from there. The knot starts from
there, can you imagine! It starts from there!

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.889
Because this one is made of prithvi-tattwa,
is made of the earth element,

00:27:39.922 --> 00:27:45.289
so from the very beginning from the
earth element itself, the knot starts.

00:27:47.534 --> 00:27:53.734
But as there is a knot: you see, when you make
a knot always there is an unwinding, always.

00:27:53.766 --> 00:27:56.644
You come by a staircase
you always can go down it.

00:27:56.676 --> 00:28:02.004
Is there a staircase by which you
cannot go down but only come up?

00:28:02.038 --> 00:28:06.796
In the same way, if you have made a knot,
there must be a way of going out of the knot.

00:28:07.938 --> 00:28:11.756
So the going out of the knot is
worked out through Sahaj Yoga.

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:14.396
That also is done through vibrations.

00:28:14.439 --> 00:28:17.256
That the first, this
knot, has to be released.

00:28:17.274 --> 00:28:21.516
Once this knot is released
then only the Kundalini starts.

00:28:21.551 --> 00:28:25.979
This is the first knot. This
is much more important.

00:28:25.979 --> 00:28:34.819
So this first knot is very strong among
Indians and is not so strong with you people.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:36.762
Though in a way you have
done one great harm

00:28:36.762 --> 00:28:41.162
but this one is not so strong in you
people, at least those who are seekers.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.580
You are not so materialistic:

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.598
in the sense at least in your rationality,

00:28:47.598 --> 00:28:49.068
I think you are.

00:28:49.068 --> 00:28:52.578
But I would say that you are not
so much worried about your food

00:28:52.578 --> 00:28:55.012
and things like that, so
much as the Indians are.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.972
I mean they can’t help it.

00:28:56.972 --> 00:29:00.292
They have to worry about their
food and all these things.

00:29:00.288 --> 00:29:03.957
Of course you get your doles, you are
not so much worried about these things.

00:29:03.972 --> 00:29:11.975
But there is also another problem that comes up with all this affluence, that in a very subtle way,

00:29:11.975 --> 00:29:16.129
very subtle way, you are
materialistic, you are.

00:29:16.153 --> 00:29:21.933
Because if you see, if there is 1p increase,
you see, the whole thing topples down,

00:29:21.933 --> 00:29:23.721
which won’t happen in India.

00:29:23.721 --> 00:29:26.511
Even if there is a 3p
increase nobody would bother,

00:29:26.511 --> 00:29:29.321
because they’ll say, “Alright, we’ll
not eat that, we’ll have another one!”

00:29:29.353 --> 00:29:32.264
You see, because they are so
much used to a kind of calamity

00:29:32.264 --> 00:29:37.199
all the time falling on them. “All right if we can’t
get bread, we’ll make something else, all right.”

00:29:37.206 --> 00:29:40.118
So like that they are not so much
disturbed as you people are.

00:29:40.128 --> 00:29:45.486
Because you become over-sensitive, even to
your materialism you are very sensitive

00:29:45.493 --> 00:29:49.618
and your materialism starts becoming
so funny that it amounts to fuss,

00:29:49.618 --> 00:29:54.133
and it’s fussy. It’s a fussy materialism
which is such a headache, I tell you,

00:29:54.155 --> 00:29:59.755
that I mean even what people are
wearing and how they are dressed…

00:29:59.755 --> 00:30:02.206
Now supposing you are wearing a suit,

00:30:02.215 --> 00:30:06.076
then they say it’s not good because, “He’s
a very suity fellow. He’s a suity fellow.”

00:30:06.095 --> 00:30:07.915
Now if he is not wearing a suit,

00:30:07.915 --> 00:30:11.945
then, “He’s very casual,” you see. Sort of
everything has a name something like that.

00:30:11.986 --> 00:30:15.617
And everything can be discarded
under some banner or something.

00:30:15.617 --> 00:30:19.060
I mean who has got time to
think about who is wearing what,

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.010
who’s a suity or a
booty or whatever it is?

00:30:21.064 --> 00:30:24.958
You see! But these things make
you sort of brand a person,

00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:31.124
that a person, his house is like this, then he
must be like this. It is not so. It is not.

00:30:31.142 --> 00:30:34.482
You see, here the knot is
so subtle in the sense

00:30:34.482 --> 00:30:37.252
that rationality, gives you this sense,

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:45.592
that by judging it, that by that you judge a person, you judge a person, by his appearance.

00:30:48.641 --> 00:30:56.846
Say supposing I wear a horn, you can say,

00:30:56.846 --> 00:30:59.146
and I try to do some tricks, you see,

00:30:59.137 --> 00:31:02.036
some jugglery for you. Supposing
I show you some money,

00:31:02.036 --> 00:31:09.627
taking out some sort of... some sort
of a ring or something like that.

00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:14.796
It may really make you feel that,
“There must be something about it!”

00:31:14.814 --> 00:31:19.946
Or even higher than that if I say that, “All
right, you can have your sex habits as you like.

00:31:19.946 --> 00:31:23.686
You can have ten women around you. It
doesn’t matter and you can meet God.”

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:29.833
And if you see someone like that you can call him a sadhu, you can. I mean, it is such a big myth,

00:31:29.853 --> 00:31:32.043
it is such a big falsehood.

00:31:32.043 --> 00:31:38.283
It is absolutely nothing but, I
would say, complete darkness, it is.

00:31:38.319 --> 00:31:43.849
But people will accept
it, because it will sound

00:31:43.889 --> 00:31:48.109
very fantastic to them, because
it will support that materialism

00:31:48.109 --> 00:31:52.459
that exists within a person
like that. You see?

00:31:52.487 --> 00:31:57.027
In India, say there is a saint and who
says that by sex you will go to God.

00:31:57.065 --> 00:31:59.093
Immediately people will
jump on him, because

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.775
you see, we are so much
endowed with sex energy,

00:32:01.775 --> 00:32:04.275
hoping we are going to
get these higher things.

00:32:04.306 --> 00:32:12.366
All these things happen in a society which is
supposed to be absolutely non-materialistic.

00:32:12.392 --> 00:32:14.232
So this materialism works out

00:32:14.262 --> 00:32:16.432
and this granthi, what I
call the Brahmagranthi,

00:32:16.415 --> 00:32:24.820
is the involvement, or you can say the
falsehood, the falsehood, of matter.

00:32:24.862 --> 00:32:30.789
The falsehood of matter works through this
and one goes on believing it and believing it.

00:32:30.825 --> 00:32:36.849
So the second thing starts with it that
people say, “Let us give up this falsehood.”

00:32:36.886 --> 00:32:40.756
And they start all kinds of
another artificial methods.

00:32:40.756 --> 00:32:43.316
After all, materialism gives you artificiality,

00:32:43.316 --> 00:32:51.333
in the sense that when your attention is
involved into things which are not real,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:57.750
which is not Reality, then naturally it is an
artificial stuff.  Everything becomes artificial.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:01.990
And when the artificiality
becomes too much,

00:33:02.012 --> 00:33:05.860
then what happens, artificially
you try to give it up.

00:33:05.899 --> 00:33:08.799
This is the second side of it.

00:33:08.839 --> 00:33:12.229
The second side of it is artificially
you think, “We should give it up.”

00:33:12.229 --> 00:33:18.619
For example, you will say, “All right, from today I am going to wear a dress like an ascetic!

00:33:19.759 --> 00:33:25.008
We had some people who said that, “We cannot give up these dresses of primitive people.” I said, “But why?”

00:33:25.008 --> 00:33:28.759
“Because we want to become primitive!”
Now you cannot become primitive.

00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:33.939
It’s a fact! You must accept it. Yes, all right,
dress up as you like, it’s nothing important.

00:33:33.959 --> 00:33:38.509
You see, you dress up like anything but you don’t think by dressing up anything you are going to become anything.

00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:41.639
Nothing! It is not important at all.

00:33:41.655 --> 00:33:45.305
Whatever way you may dress up, whatever things you may dress up, whatever you may do,

00:33:45.319 --> 00:33:50.355
has no bearing on your inner yoga.

00:33:50.374 --> 00:33:52.647
Inner yoga works out by itself,

00:33:52.652 --> 00:33:54.237
it works out through chakras,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.377
it goes inside, it’s a subtle thing which
is a detached thing from, how you dress:

00:33:58.393 --> 00:34:01.557
how you walk, how you talk is not the point.

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:05.649
Once this yoga works out then of
course, the things change outside;

00:34:05.649 --> 00:34:07.279
because your faces glow,

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:10.339
you become magnetic,

00:34:10.339 --> 00:34:13.689
you talk in a way which is authoritative,

00:34:13.729 --> 00:34:15.309
you start curing people,

00:34:15.318 --> 00:34:20.589
you start doing many things which shows that you are a different person: that’s a very different thing altogether.

00:34:20.618 --> 00:34:26.077
But normally by doing it outside,
artificially doing something:

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:31.047
you see this is another kind of
a granthi, you can call a knot.

00:34:31.047 --> 00:34:36.183
And this knot starts by
identifying yourself,

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:44.250
by thinking that if you do something
then you are going to achieve it.

00:34:44.287 --> 00:34:52.565
By... by sort of doing some sort of an effort

00:34:52.565 --> 00:34:56.225
or by doing some sort of a penance

00:34:56.225 --> 00:34:59.665
or sort of standing on your
heads or so called Hatha Yoga,

00:34:59.665 --> 00:35:03.978
or all these things that people
do in the name of God also.

00:35:03.994 --> 00:35:09.037
All these things you think you are
going to achieve, is another falsehood.

00:35:09.047 --> 00:35:13.384
Because with this falsehood that
knot becomes stronger and stronger.

00:35:13.384 --> 00:35:18.267
Doing anything, is what you call the Rajoguna,
is the Rajoguna, is the Right side action.

00:35:18.267 --> 00:35:22.145
The Left Side action just now I described
to you, which starts from the Mooladhara.

00:35:22.172 --> 00:35:25.645
And the Right Side action, which is
the Rajoguna which is within you,

00:35:25.652 --> 00:35:33.409
which is the activity within us,

00:35:33.441 --> 00:35:36.259
by which we do something,
we want to do something;

00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:41.809
which is done through our ahamkara,
is through our ego which is there.

00:35:41.841 --> 00:35:47.664
And all this also,
doesn’t lead you anywhere,

00:35:47.696 --> 00:35:54.203
because whatever you do, you do not
do any living work, you do all dead.

00:35:54.251 --> 00:35:56.751
Supposing you have made this
chair: what have you done?

00:35:56.751 --> 00:36:01.504
You have just changed a tree into a dead
stuff and then made a chair, that’s all .

00:36:01.504 --> 00:36:04.931
dead into dead. You have created all
this, it’s all dead and that is all dead

00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:08.933
Any living work human
beings have done? Nothing.

00:36:12.396 --> 00:36:18.676
And, if evolution is a living process you are
doing all living: you have to do something living.

00:36:18.698 --> 00:36:25.956
On the contrary if you are doing something dead and believing that you are doing something living, then it’s even a greater falsehood.

00:36:25.956 --> 00:36:29.316
But if you realise that we are
doing nothing, that is living,

00:36:29.316 --> 00:36:30.676
for that something has to happen,

00:36:30.676 --> 00:36:36.316
that we should be endowed with that
Power by which we do living things:

00:36:36.336 --> 00:36:39.692
if this is accepted then the
thing works out, otherwise not.

00:36:39.692 --> 00:36:43.292
If people think, “No, I
am the prime minister!”

00:36:43.292 --> 00:36:47.362
say, “I am the king!” “I am the XYZ!”

00:36:47.362 --> 00:36:53.644
you may be anything, still
for God you are a dead person.

00:36:53.665 --> 00:36:55.925
It matters nothing to God.

00:36:55.961 --> 00:37:00.999
You might be an engineer, all right
you are, you arrange, say for example

00:37:01.017 --> 00:37:05.009
you arrange a machinery
or something to work out.

00:37:05.065 --> 00:37:07.795
Even if you go to Moon, what is it?

00:37:07.799 --> 00:37:12.045
Dead going to the dead and coming
back dead! What have you achieved?

00:37:12.053 --> 00:37:13.613
Going to the Moon, what did you get?

00:37:13.613 --> 00:37:18.393
Those stones, things, and what are you
going to put them in, on your heads?

00:37:18.415 --> 00:37:22.205
What living thing have you done
out if it? Just think it over.

00:37:24.678 --> 00:37:27.731
What efforts! What mind!

00:37:30.426 --> 00:37:33.056
Then coming to religion, also
we behave in the same manner.

00:37:33.056 --> 00:37:35.481
We think if we go to church, now for example

00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:39.996
some people believe in it. Of course, I mean
some of you are sensible enough to understand

00:37:39.996 --> 00:37:44.086
that by going to church and listening to a
priest you are not going to achieve anything.

00:37:44.106 --> 00:37:45.936
Is a sensible thing, that way.

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:49.906
But even by going to temples, you are
not going to achieve it, take it from me.

00:37:49.918 --> 00:37:52.699
Going to any lectures, you
are not going to achieve it.

00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:58.829
They are just going to talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, which is a dead thing, which becomes a dead in your mind  nothing but conditioning takes place.

00:37:58.829 --> 00:38:02.169
By reading books, you are not
going to achieve it either.

00:38:02.169 --> 00:38:06.789
Books are dead: you read the books you
accumulate more dead on your left hand side.

00:38:06.827 --> 00:38:11.981
By the Right side, you do the thing
by accumulating the Left Side.

00:38:11.999 --> 00:38:15.311
But you use also the Left
Side for your Right side.

00:38:15.339 --> 00:38:18.862
Because, you see, if you have read a
book, then, so, “Yes, yes, yes! You see!

00:38:18.862 --> 00:38:21.609
Now Mataji is not that person, you see,

00:38:21.609 --> 00:38:26.669
because there was in this book this was
written and how Mataji explains that?”

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:31.492
So all the time you are playing with these
two knots within you Rajoguna and Tamoguna:

00:38:31.492 --> 00:38:37.934
these two knots are within you and that’s
why your attention is not on the Spirit.

00:38:42.425 --> 00:38:47.162
Third is the Sattvoguna, you can call
it: the one by which we try to know God;

00:38:47.172 --> 00:38:51.702
is the one by which we try to see things
that, “No, this is not all right!”

00:38:51.702 --> 00:38:55.693
“We give up this and give up that
and we should take to Rajoguna.”

00:38:55.727 --> 00:38:58.482
We should give up Rajoguna and
we should take to Sattvoguna:

00:38:58.482 --> 00:39:04.822
is the central path, where we try to say, “We
must be God. But what can we do to be God?”

00:39:04.865 --> 00:39:07.685
Like I have told you, people
think that by meditating...

00:39:07.685 --> 00:39:08.725
You see some people have told me

00:39:08.725 --> 00:39:11.495
“Oh, I have been meditating Mother
for the last twenty-five years!”

00:39:11.512 --> 00:39:13.167
“Now,” I said, “what have
you been meditating?”

00:39:13.167 --> 00:39:20.832
I mean, there have been people I have known
who have been ‘meditating’. But where, and how?

00:39:20.854 --> 00:39:23.982
It’s funny, you know, how people can do it.

00:39:24.034 --> 00:39:27.814
We had neighbours there, and
somebody had given them a mantra

00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:30.583
and he was a man, a very
big man, I should say,

00:39:30.592 --> 00:39:34.063
he was really governor of
the Reserve Bank of India!

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.230
And they would get up four o’clock till six o’clock,

00:39:36.261 --> 00:39:40.080
they were meditating and saying some sort
of a mantra, absolutely rumble tumble,

00:39:40.089 --> 00:39:44.530
and they were doing it and doing it and doing
it till it was about twenty years you see!

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:52.800
Till they absolutely became dilapidated, their hands became like this, feet became like this and swollen bodies and all that, and then they died.

00:39:52.843 --> 00:40:01.545
Till then they were going on and on until the end! And even when they were laid down in bed they could not move on, still they were on with it!

00:40:01.575 --> 00:40:07.035
They had become completely dead. You won’t believe how they had become. I wish I had shown you their photographs.

00:40:07.035 --> 00:40:08.315
Absolutely bedridden,

00:40:08.315 --> 00:40:12.255
and their bodies were swollen up and
they could not even move their legs

00:40:12.255 --> 00:40:17.485
and food was given to them and somebody
used to take them out and do everything.

00:40:17.505 --> 00:40:24.502
I mean, they couldn’t move any part of their body, they were all deadened and finished, like that, and still they were saying the mantras!

00:40:24.502 --> 00:40:28.212
I said, “Now when are you going to
get the fruit of all these mantras?”

00:40:28.224 --> 00:40:30.784
They said, “You see our
mother…” They have a mother,

00:40:30.821 --> 00:40:35.054
and their mother has promised that,
“When you will die you will get it.”

00:40:35.059 --> 00:40:36.443
They died and nothing happened!

00:40:36.443 --> 00:40:40.673
The body was so heavy nobody could
lift it, and it was a big problem.

00:40:40.687 --> 00:40:43.962
So they were deadening themselves, all the
time they were deadening and deadening!

00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:50.842
Instead of going towards life, they
were deadening themselves only.

00:40:50.859 --> 00:40:53.349
Now, you see, I could
not tell them anything

00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:55.549
because they were not very
willing to listen to me.

00:40:55.569 --> 00:40:58.709
They had become so much addicted
to that habit of saying mantra,

00:40:58.716 --> 00:41:01.569
that even doctors could
not do anything about it,

00:41:01.569 --> 00:41:04.769
nobody could do, they would not take any
medicine, they were just doing mantras only.

00:41:04.817 --> 00:41:09.140
Their mouth was saying mantra and
the whole body was stiff like that!

00:41:11.436 --> 00:41:14.207
And they died and people said, “What
great people have died, you know!

00:41:14.234 --> 00:41:16.907
We must take their
darshanas they have died.”

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:19.740
Now, you start looking at them
and you say, “Now, what to do?”

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.857
And the people they came and they
said, “Oh, great people have died!

00:41:22.878 --> 00:41:25.378
Then they took the name
of God till the end!”

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.870
And then you blame God:

00:41:26.883 --> 00:41:32.080
“Why, you see, why is that they took the
name of God and why did they die like that?”

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:34.545
I mean you must see where
you are hitting your head!

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.485
Supposing that is the door and if
you go on hitting your head here

00:41:37.485 --> 00:41:41.864
and then you say, “Mother we hit our head for
twenty years why didn’t you find the way?”

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:48.910
I mean this is not the way! The way is
there. That’s the way you have to get it.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:52.110
If this is not the way,
why are you hitting there?

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.292
This is because of the Rajoguna problems,

00:41:54.292 --> 00:41:57.502
the Rajoguna problem that we
can do something about it.

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:01.493
People just cannot believe that
you cannot do anything about it,

00:42:01.513 --> 00:42:08.503
because in a very, very subtle
way Mr. E-G-O is present!

00:42:08.537 --> 00:42:13.374
You say anything to them immediately it
comes up like a snake, I have seen it.

00:42:13.418 --> 00:42:16.488
“Oh, Mataji said that! No, I can’t
bear it! Why did she say that?”

00:42:16.508 --> 00:42:22.302
I mean, why did I say, means I see things and that’s why I am saying! You will also come on this side one day and you will start seeing.

00:42:22.302 --> 00:42:25.608
And what I say is absolute
truth or not you can verify it!

00:42:25.624 --> 00:42:27.418
But why should I say, is the main point!

00:42:27.418 --> 00:42:29.258
I don’t want to disturb you.

00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:33.979
I have brought you here and I have called
you here to give you something special.

00:42:33.987 --> 00:42:37.517
All right now if that is so,
let us have a compact of it,

00:42:37.517 --> 00:42:40.407
some sort of a compact deal about it,

00:42:40.407 --> 00:42:44.704
that I give you something and then
you receive it and the compact,

00:42:44.704 --> 00:42:48.045
the whole thing, should work in you, and then you decide about it.

00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:50.425
Instead of that if one word you say,

00:42:50.419 --> 00:42:54.835
immediately the snake comes, “Oh!
She said this to us, let’s walk out!”

00:42:54.852 --> 00:42:57.352
Now what should I say? “You are all right”?

00:42:57.352 --> 00:43:03.992
“You need not seek. You are perfect”? Is that the way should I pamper your ego?

00:43:04.024 --> 00:43:05.544
No, it should not be so.

00:43:05.544 --> 00:43:08.044
Neither do I condemn
anybody. I do not say that,

00:43:08.044 --> 00:43:11.351
“It is because you are like
this ,you are condemned!” — no!

00:43:11.372 --> 00:43:12.961
But you must see the Reality,

00:43:12.945 --> 00:43:16.461
that you are not there as yet, the Reality has not come to you,

00:43:16.485 --> 00:43:18.091
you must see the Reality as a whole.

00:43:18.102 --> 00:43:20.515
For example, I am a Mother and
you are hitting your head here.

00:43:20.515 --> 00:43:23.505
Now if I tell you, “My child for
heaven’s sake don’t hit your head,

00:43:23.505 --> 00:43:25.765
you will break your head. Go there, there’s the door.”

00:43:25.766 --> 00:43:29.202
Then you say, “I’m on my own,
who are you to tell me?”

00:43:29.242 --> 00:43:31.073
Now this is a bit too much
for a Mother to bear.

00:43:31.073 --> 00:43:36.523
Now she says, “Please see, this is
the door you get out of this door.”

00:43:36.523 --> 00:43:39.723
That’s why you need a Mother,
you don’t need anybody else.

00:43:39.754 --> 00:43:41.738
Because anybody else would
just say, “Oh, all right,

00:43:41.738 --> 00:43:47.328
you go ahead! Break your head
and finished with everything!

00:43:47.352 --> 00:43:50.123
Good riddance of the bad rubbish!”
But a Mother is not like that.

00:43:50.123 --> 00:43:53.293
She thinks about it, she thinks,
“Oh, my children are there,

00:43:53.334 --> 00:43:57.253
they are seeking, they are seekers. I have
to go on telling them and telling them,

00:43:57.253 --> 00:44:00.053
so that at least they open themselves.”

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:01.649
But they’ll go on
hitting their heads,

00:44:01.649 --> 00:44:07.935
whatever you may try, you see unless and
until this wisdom comes into the head.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.680
And it’s such a vicious circle, I tell you.

00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:13.917
The wisdom cannot come till
this lowest granthi breaks,

00:44:13.939 --> 00:44:19.603
the lowest knot breaks, where a person
starts understanding one simple point:

00:44:19.603 --> 00:44:22.539
that human beings cannot do it.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.015
God has to do it.

00:44:29.062 --> 00:44:31.562
So the surrendering starts.

00:44:31.562 --> 00:44:37.725
God has to do it. You cannot do it. Only thing
we have to say, “Oh, Lord please!” that’s all.

00:44:37.795 --> 00:44:39.935
You have to just knock at the door.

00:44:39.935 --> 00:44:45.835
You don’t have to argue out whether Christ was correct or not, whether Buddha was correct or not — don’t discuss any dogmas.

00:44:45.835 --> 00:44:54.855
All these people, all those who are supposed to be in charge of religions, have created nothing but useless dogmas to quarrel and fight!

00:44:54.845 --> 00:44:58.305
And I was amazed to see these people
when they have their meetings:

00:44:58.325 --> 00:45:00.895
“We have to discuss who is
going to be elected for this

00:45:00.895 --> 00:45:07.895
and what is going to be the agenda
for the budget of this thing,

00:45:07.919 --> 00:45:12.059
and then lastly what will be
the menu for the next year?”

00:45:12.086 --> 00:45:17.466
That’s all they do! I mean if that is God’s
job, I am quite surprised and you should be.

00:45:17.466 --> 00:45:26.596
I mean is this the way these people are going to bring Reality within you by bringing you all kinds of unreal and useless things?

00:45:26.633 --> 00:45:29.587
And they are doing it, and we are
in it all the time, we are in it.

00:45:29.587 --> 00:45:32.517
We are identified with it, because.....

00:45:32.552 --> 00:45:33.692
BREAK IN RECORDING

00:45:33.692 --> 00:45:36.192
...this yellow stuff, you see, absolutely.

00:45:36.192 --> 00:45:42.072
It gives you also. To me, it
gives me nauseous, a feeling of...

00:45:42.072 --> 00:45:44.305
Most of these people,
egoistical, have bad liver

00:45:44.332 --> 00:45:49.635
and also they have, they get
this trouble of migraine.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:53.240
And also they get all liver problems

00:45:53.240 --> 00:46:00.520
and this yellow colour especially is
expressing their liver temperaments.

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:05.563
Then on top of that, they think,
“What’s wrong in doing anything?”

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:13.614
Already we are on one side then, “What’s wrong?” then starts, then we start drinking,

00:46:13.606 --> 00:46:17.544
because we must deny all that is good.

00:46:17.583 --> 00:46:20.483
Now let me tell you one thing:

00:46:20.503 --> 00:46:28.073
whatever things people do which are egoistical,
the things that they do that destroys them.

00:46:28.073 --> 00:46:34.396
You see, it’s sort of a thing they want to destroy themselves. Perhaps in a subtle way their ego wants to destroy itself.

00:46:34.396 --> 00:46:39.913
It is such a thing that they work
it out in such a sub-human way.

00:46:39.926 --> 00:46:44.356
For example, for a person like me, I
cannot understand a man who goes to a pub

00:46:44.356 --> 00:46:48.026
and sees another person coming
in and falling down all over:

00:46:48.026 --> 00:46:52.082
you see such a man coming
out then how do you enter in?

00:46:52.108 --> 00:46:53.728
It’s like a lunatic asylum!

00:46:53.709 --> 00:46:57.072
I mean if you go to lunatic asylum
and you see a lunatic coming out, .

00:46:57.072 --> 00:46:58.912
then you would not like to go inside

00:46:58.908 --> 00:47:02.868
But this, I can’t understand
how human beings do. They see.

00:47:02.868 --> 00:47:08.378
Now you know it very well that nobody so far has been even honoured because he’s a drunkard.

00:47:08.384 --> 00:47:12.008
Has there been anybody in the whole world?

00:47:12.018 --> 00:47:16.778
While the whole world drinks,
but is there anybody honoured?

00:47:16.818 --> 00:47:20.818
In the history I would like to
know: was anybody honoured?

00:47:20.835 --> 00:47:28.458
Any man who has deceived his wife and has married ten women has been honoured for that? Is there anybody honoured?

00:47:34.257 --> 00:47:38.957
I mean they say that many geniuses,
I call them geniasses, are like that.

00:47:38.957 --> 00:47:43.496
You see, maybe they are just like the
radiograms from where some music is coming,

00:47:43.496 --> 00:47:46.126
but it doesn’t do anything inside it.

00:47:46.158 --> 00:47:48.278
And they, if they
become your models,

00:47:48.292 --> 00:47:52.908
you might be becoming geniasses
yourself, without even any genius in you.

00:47:54.262 --> 00:48:01.206
So all funny models we set up but
do we ever erect their statues?

00:48:01.233 --> 00:48:06.466
Do we garland them? Do
we worship them? Why?

00:48:06.503 --> 00:48:07.911
Anybody may say against Christ,

00:48:07.911 --> 00:48:11.991
I don’t say that anybody can stop you,
I mean because you are on your own.

00:48:12.013 --> 00:48:16.413
You see, on your own trip is one of
the worst trips that I could think of.

00:48:16.413 --> 00:48:21.633
What have you found so far to be on your own?
Nothing! You haven’t found your own properties.

00:48:21.633 --> 00:48:26.683
You haven’t found out your own nature. You
have not found out the beauty that you are.

00:48:26.727 --> 00:48:33.387
What are you all with? Will you go out
anywhere without taking any money with you?

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.910
You don’t even have a ticket!

00:48:38.376 --> 00:48:41.686
So just it’s a joke, that you
are on your own. You are not!

00:48:41.686 --> 00:48:43.993
You are not, because your own is missing,

00:48:43.993 --> 00:48:47.183
is missing, it’s not there.
We have to find out that own.

00:48:47.206 --> 00:48:49.771
Our attention should be on that own.

00:48:49.771 --> 00:48:57.006
And why, why do we always indulge into
these three complications all the time.

00:48:57.005 --> 00:49:00.765
Like even in the centre, is about Sattvoguna.

00:49:00.765 --> 00:49:07.880
Because we feel many people do feel:
that’s also a very modern blessing,

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:11.840
I would say, that everyone
feels the need to seek.

00:49:13.365 --> 00:49:18.341
But when you see how
Joan of Arc was punished

00:49:18.341 --> 00:49:20.641
and how things happened in the past,

00:49:20.641 --> 00:49:24.591
how people were mad and dogmatic and
egoistical in the name of religion:

00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:27.200
you don’t know what to do.
You see the funny people!

00:49:27.198 --> 00:49:29.290
Then you get all these
horrible gurus coming here

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:31.890
and taking from you and
doing all kinds of things.

00:49:31.899 --> 00:49:33.469
You think, “What’s all going on?”

00:49:33.479 --> 00:49:37.645
Then you see people giving you sermons
and lectures and all their private life:

00:49:37.645 --> 00:49:42.419
nothing in them bubbling, nothing so
special, nothing so sweet about them.

00:49:42.442 --> 00:49:45.204
Then you feel, “What is this going on?”

00:49:45.204 --> 00:49:48.526
And that is the central path
where you are really seeking

00:49:48.526 --> 00:49:53.516
and then you say, “No, let me do it
myself!” I can assure you, you cannot,

00:49:53.528 --> 00:49:55.255
it’s not meant to be.

00:49:55.275 --> 00:49:57.435
Why?

00:49:57.435 --> 00:50:04.465
I mean if somebody says, “All right you come
to my house. Just come down and you’ll get it.”

00:50:04.477 --> 00:50:08.377
Then why do you want to do it
still? What is the reason?

00:50:09.847 --> 00:50:11.565
There are many people
who have been here

00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:14.695
who don’t like when I tell them,
“Please give up this mantra of yours.

00:50:14.729 --> 00:50:16.675
It’s not going to do
any good to you!”

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:19.800
They say, “Why Mataji?” As
if they become the mantra!

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.730
And the mantra itself is “Rumble tumble”!
Nobody knows a word about Sanskrit!

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:29.760
Nobody knows a word about what it means, where to take which mantra. There is no living process behind it — nothing!

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.793
I am shocked at it sometimes.

00:50:33.843 --> 00:50:37.393
Sometimes I feel, instead of
water you are taking poison

00:50:40.123 --> 00:50:42.131
And when you tell about the Reality

00:50:42.131 --> 00:50:45.881
and you tell them, “This is how it works
out, and it has to work out within you.

00:50:45.903 --> 00:50:50.573
It is an internal working. It is an internal yoga

00:50:50.573 --> 00:50:53.713
which has to work out, which you have to
feel it yourself; you have to see yourself

00:50:53.713 --> 00:50:58.451
and you have to see it in others, and you
have to work it out.” People don’t like it.

00:50:59.887 --> 00:51:06.918
This is also because of the third
misidentification you have of your Sattvoguna.

00:51:06.947 --> 00:51:09.747
Because artificiality starts
from the very beginning,

00:51:09.747 --> 00:51:14.967
the artificiality goes on and on, till even
you come to Sattvoguna which is the seeking

00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:18.447
In seeking also there’s artificiality.

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:25.578
Now if I may tell you that I
can see you through and through:

00:51:25.603 --> 00:51:28.328
it’s a fact. I can.

00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:32.608
Now you put up a show before me,
whatever show you want, but I can see it.

00:51:36.144 --> 00:51:39.399
But I do not show that,

00:51:39.424 --> 00:51:41.814
I don’t want to show, it’s all right.

00:51:41.814 --> 00:51:48.054
Sometimes I am very unhappy when I see some
people; I know there’s a big problem about them.

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:54.331
You haven’t got that experience, but supposing
when you become a Sahaj Yogi you will feel it.

00:51:54.331 --> 00:51:59.365
Those who have got it can feel it. You
will feel so concerned about things.

00:51:59.402 --> 00:52:02.446
And sometimes you feel very
elated to see some people

00:52:02.446 --> 00:52:07.352
are in a very good shape and
some are in a very elated shape.

00:52:09.083 --> 00:52:12.696
I can see you through and
through. I can see everything.

00:52:12.736 --> 00:52:17.746
But still my love, you see,

00:52:17.819 --> 00:52:25.610
is such that it doesn’t allow me to see
those things that will recede my attention.

00:52:28.005 --> 00:52:30.505
I can see my love working it out:

00:52:30.505 --> 00:52:35.565
It tries to build it and make
it. I have to work it out.

00:52:35.565 --> 00:52:40.985
But then my attention is a very special
stuff: it goes to a great extent.

00:52:41.002 --> 00:52:44.142
Now the love and the attention play a part.

00:52:44.152 --> 00:52:51.942
In my case, you see, my love is in my
heart, it’s my Left Side. This one is not.

00:52:51.988 --> 00:52:54.698
It plays hand in hand with the attention.

00:52:56.802 --> 00:53:01.252
Now attention is in the centre and my
Sahaja Yoga is on the right hand side.

00:53:03.922 --> 00:53:09.852
So the attention is also very stubborn:

00:53:11.674 --> 00:53:15.564
it plays, to a point,
it goes up to a point,

00:53:15.575 --> 00:53:20.694
then it recedes back, again, it goes
down and says, “All right, forget it!

00:53:20.727 --> 00:53:23.781
You just can’t do it, not yet.”

00:53:29.133 --> 00:53:38.627
Because, you see, love can
also spoil, so they balance.

00:53:38.637 --> 00:53:43.558
Like in a driving you have
an accelerator and a brake.

00:53:43.577 --> 00:53:46.046
You can put an
accelerator to a point

00:53:46.046 --> 00:53:51.407
but if it goes beyond a point then it might
spoil the whole show, so you have to put it down.

00:53:51.406 --> 00:53:58.054
It has to keep in relation with the whole
programme, with all the people around.

00:53:58.076 --> 00:54:01.376
Now say if there’s a
person who comes here,

00:54:01.382 --> 00:54:05.886
who is a very troublesome fellow, he has very
bad vibrations, he drinks and he troubles us,

00:54:05.886 --> 00:54:09.226
and he just comes here to
disturb us; he argues.

00:54:09.256 --> 00:54:11.809
One day I tolerate him,

00:54:11.837 --> 00:54:15.589
second time I tolerate, third time he
doesn’t turn up, he just doesn’t turn up!

00:54:15.596 --> 00:54:18.856
People don’t know how he doesn’t
come, “Oh, he was transferred.”

00:54:18.916 --> 00:54:22.786
I didn’t do that but it happens.

00:54:24.747 --> 00:54:26.260
The attention just recedes:

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:31.860
no importance to such a person; he is
useless, because what he can achieve?

00:54:32.717 --> 00:54:35.249
Thousands and millions can
be given it just like this.

00:54:35.249 --> 00:54:39.399
Why should God worry about people who are
not interested in their own well-being?

00:54:39.431 --> 00:54:42.699
He’s not going to fall at their feet. He
can create the whole universe; I mean,

00:54:42.699 --> 00:54:46.449
He can create all other
types of human beings.

00:54:48.317 --> 00:54:50.817
So this is also there, this attention, you see:

00:54:50.817 --> 00:54:53.520
it’s a very proud stuff.

00:54:53.539 --> 00:55:00.190
It has its own protocol and these protocols
are divided into these seven centres.

00:55:00.225 --> 00:55:04.755
And any one of these Deities, specially
Christ, the Lord as you call Him,

00:55:04.755 --> 00:55:12.276
He is really the Lord you know, not an easy
person, if He gets angry, it’s impossible.

00:55:12.326 --> 00:55:16.129
He loves you; no doubt, but to a point.

00:55:19.183 --> 00:55:21.449
He loves me much more than He loves you.

00:55:21.449 --> 00:55:27.739
If He finds that there is a problem for
me He will have nothing to do with you.

00:55:29.981 --> 00:55:34.747
As long as you are receiving it,
and behaving yourself, all right.

00:55:34.797 --> 00:55:37.232
Same about Mahavira,
same about Buddha:

00:55:37.238 --> 00:55:42.668
we are on one side. So they
all support, they all help,

00:55:42.696 --> 00:55:53.423
and all of them are absolutely in unison and
in complete understanding; nobody fights them.

00:55:53.447 --> 00:55:56.577
It’s a complete integration.

00:55:56.577 --> 00:55:58.127
Only I am the person in between,

00:55:58.132 --> 00:56:01.867
trying to say, “All right, just for a little
bit, let’s have it this way and that way.

00:56:01.894 --> 00:56:05.181
Let’s do it, you see.” Like a chairman
sitting on the chair and telling them,

00:56:05.181 --> 00:56:09.674
“All right. It’s all right now. Please
forgive! Please forgive me now!”

00:56:09.689 --> 00:56:12.189
But somehow (unclear).

00:56:14.139 --> 00:56:16.399
It happens.

00:56:16.419 --> 00:56:21.757
Then for a Sahaja Yogi it is essential
to know there are certain rules

00:56:21.757 --> 00:56:24.257
and regulations of Sahaj Yoga.

00:56:27.389 --> 00:56:30.069
Immediately your vibrations are less
to begin with.

00:56:31.803 --> 00:56:32.831
I don’t do anything.

00:56:32.862 --> 00:56:34.811
People say, “Mother you have
taken away my vibrations!”

00:56:34.845 --> 00:56:39.529
I say, “Why should I? I am so anxious to
give it away! I mean I am fed up of it!”

00:56:39.556 --> 00:56:43.066
I would love to give
everything, all this to you.

00:56:43.107 --> 00:56:45.480
But if there’s something wrong
with you what am I to do?

00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.933
Now supposing you put a lid

00:56:47.945 --> 00:56:50.883
on top of a pitcher and put it in the Ganges

00:56:50.921 --> 00:56:55.033
and you say, “No! Ganges is
flowing, now what am I to do?”

00:56:55.063 --> 00:56:57.363
Remove the lid!

00:56:59.663 --> 00:57:02.163
And it is very subtle, very subtle.

00:57:02.163 --> 00:57:04.150
You don’t realise how subtle it is,

00:57:04.154 --> 00:57:10.113
only in vibrations: “Oh God! I’ve
lost my vibrations!” That’s all!

00:57:10.143 --> 00:57:15.048
So vibrations are the most
important things for Sahaja Yogis.

00:57:15.111 --> 00:57:19.141
The most important thing is to achieve
a complete state of vibrations,

00:57:19.164 --> 00:57:23.151
when your Realisation is
completely integrated,

00:57:23.168 --> 00:57:33.380
your physical being, your emotional being, your Spiritual being is complete, in unison, there’s a complete balance within you.

00:57:33.424 --> 00:57:37.487
Then only the vibrations flow and
that’s why antar-yoga is important.

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:39.831
It is not only lecturing that is
going to help you. Of course,

00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:43.241
there are vibrations in
it and they work out:

00:57:43.256 --> 00:57:49.256
I try through my vibrations of my
words, I try to disentangle you.

00:57:49.256 --> 00:57:53.714
But that is to a point, where you have
to yourself take up and work it out,

00:57:53.748 --> 00:57:57.084
the antar-yoga, the inner yoga,

00:57:57.136 --> 00:58:01.504
by working it out in a way
that you sit down, meditate

00:58:01.504 --> 00:58:06.026
and do various things that
Sahaj Yoga has suggested.

00:58:08.183 --> 00:58:12.487
Now I have, you know that, my
grandchildren are realised-souls and

00:58:12.507 --> 00:58:14.737
they’re very high quality realised-souls

00:58:14.737 --> 00:58:17.867
and they understand a lot about
Kundalini from very childhood.

00:58:17.923 --> 00:58:22.018
Yesterday one of the girls was
feeling the Left Nabhi very much,

00:58:22.024 --> 00:58:26.398
all over, and she said, “Now
I will know how to remove it.”

00:58:26.404 --> 00:58:30.738
And she brought pieces of paper
and she tied them round her there.

00:58:30.738 --> 00:58:32.655
Then she took vibrations like that.

00:58:32.655 --> 00:58:37.725
So she said that, “Now they are all
passing into this paper!” You see.

00:58:37.725 --> 00:58:39.605
Actually while doing that,

00:58:39.625 --> 00:58:41.585
she was giving bandhan to it.

00:58:41.585 --> 00:58:45.395
She was moving her own vibrations
around it, she was binding them.

00:58:45.407 --> 00:58:50.444
And then she took them and she said, “Alright,
put them in the fire,” and they burned it.

00:58:50.444 --> 00:58:54.973
And her tension was reduced. And
everywhere, everybody felt better.

00:58:55.003 --> 00:58:57.243
It’s so fantastic it is!

00:58:57.243 --> 00:58:58.513
And now this girl is seven

00:58:58.513 --> 00:59:02.533
but I have a granddaughter, she’s
hardly two, and she’s very great too.

00:59:02.542 --> 00:59:05.332
She just comes on to the point.
She says, “This is the problem!”

00:59:05.382 --> 00:59:09.692
And I have a grandson who just climbs
on somebody and he clears them out.

00:59:09.692 --> 00:59:12.192
His vibrations are clear,
people have seen it.

00:59:12.192 --> 00:59:15.984
And there are many children like
that, who are born in this country.

00:59:15.984 --> 00:59:17.275
How are you going to understand it?

00:59:17.275 --> 00:59:21.985
Only by attending to some sort of a
meditation course or something like that?

00:59:21.992 --> 00:59:25.354
Paying for it? No, you
have to be lively people.

00:59:26.997 --> 00:59:29.817
Sahaja Yogis should realise one thing:

00:59:29.817 --> 00:59:38.880
that they are the foundation
of the new world.

00:59:41.189 --> 00:59:44.557
This is a very, very big responsibility.

00:59:44.557 --> 00:59:47.727
And the foundations have to be very solid.

00:59:47.761 --> 00:59:50.559
They are made out of
stones, no doubt,

00:59:50.559 --> 00:59:59.515
but they have to be really solid, absolutely
solid, because they are in the foundation.

01:00:01.544 --> 01:00:04.738
They are chiselled out much more.

01:00:04.764 --> 01:00:07.264
They are to be cleared out much more.

01:00:07.264 --> 01:00:11.114
But if the foundation is not good

01:00:11.113 --> 01:00:18.554
we cannot build the complete edifice,
you cannot do anything about it.

01:00:18.562 --> 01:00:25.324
First, the foundation is important, and that’s why it’s nice we are getting a few people.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:28.495
But it’s taking a bit too much time,
I think, the foundation itself.

01:00:28.495 --> 01:00:32.015
Every stone has to look after oneself,

01:00:32.055 --> 01:00:35.045
and has to work it out
in a much deeper way

01:00:35.045 --> 01:00:40.890
and work out the vibrations
and must evolve the methods,

01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:44.500
all the methods, by which
your depth is created.

01:00:44.499 --> 01:00:52.279
Nothing is important but this: that every
one of you should be real solid people.

01:00:52.297 --> 01:01:03.621
In the end, I will just tell you that the subtle part of these chakras, is how to understand them.

01:01:03.655 --> 01:01:10.655
The first side, the first entanglement
with the jada-prakruti as you call it,

01:01:10.655 --> 01:01:13.694
the matter, is to know the auspiciousness,

01:01:14.835 --> 01:01:19.715
auspiciousness of things: what is
auspicious, what is not auspicious.

01:01:21.757 --> 01:01:24.707
If you understand the auspiciousness

01:01:24.724 --> 01:01:31.427
then you will understand that you can
overcome the binding of the matter.

01:01:31.447 --> 01:01:34.767
Now, even auspiciousness can
become quite maddening to people.

01:01:34.787 --> 01:01:38.517
I have seen it. I have seen people
washing their hands fifty-five times,

01:01:38.547 --> 01:01:41.552
pulling their hair hundred
times. That’s not the way.

01:01:41.557 --> 01:01:46.192
But you must understand what is
auspicious, what is not auspicious.

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.600
For example,

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:54.380
we can say,

01:01:54.410 --> 01:02:02.140
how we sit in a programme
is not important so much.

01:02:02.159 --> 01:02:06.851
You may be little bit sometimes pushing back,
pushing forward, may be sitting any way:

01:02:06.851 --> 01:02:09.116
that’s not important.

01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:14.867
But the auspiciousness of sitting is that: have
you reverence in your mind when you are sitting?

01:02:14.907 --> 01:02:17.557
There should be a reverence in you.

01:02:17.557 --> 01:02:20.397
When you are sitting for your meditation,

01:02:20.417 --> 01:02:24.747
are you taking upon yourself that,
“Oh, I am going to achieve it today."

01:02:24.777 --> 01:02:30.017
or out of reverence you are sitting in a
surrendering mood, in a surrendering position?

01:02:30.017 --> 01:02:33.977
The reverence part is very important,
once you start understanding reverence.

01:02:33.977 --> 01:02:36.937
I have seen people putting
both their legs towards me,

01:02:36.955 --> 01:02:41.963
sitting down like that. I have seen people
with very arrogant ways of sitting.

01:02:41.963 --> 01:02:44.409
For example, sitting like this, you see,

01:02:44.439 --> 01:02:49.179
before anybody who is supposed to be
revered: you should not sit like this.

01:02:49.179 --> 01:02:51.679
If you sit like this then there is no reverence.

01:02:51.679 --> 01:02:54.921
This is you sit when you are
in the authority yourself!

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:58.181
You should sit with your both legs
like this and sit in reverence.

01:02:58.197 --> 01:03:00.277
Now this pose is not important.

01:03:00.297 --> 01:03:05.357
You can be absolutely burning with ego
within you and could be sitting like this.

01:03:05.357 --> 01:03:10.637
So I’m again telling you:
auspiciousness is what is within you,

01:03:10.656 --> 01:03:13.788
what you think about it,
what is happening to you:

01:03:13.788 --> 01:03:19.428
Are you feeling reverence within you? Are
you feeling the reverence by your pose?

01:03:19.446 --> 01:03:22.027
This is your own judgment.
This is your decision.

01:03:22.036 --> 01:03:28.046
This is nothing to do with how you should sit,
whether you sit on your one leg or two legs,

01:03:28.046 --> 01:03:29.407
it’s not the most important thing,

01:03:29.407 --> 01:03:35.476
but do you feel that, by this you are
relaxed and you are in a reverence position?

01:03:38.178 --> 01:03:42.258
This is the thing. If you feel you are in
a reverence position, that’s all right.

01:03:42.278 --> 01:03:45.998
That is what you have to do, is
to understand auspiciousness.

01:03:45.998 --> 01:03:48.498
An example I will tell
you, of auspiciousness:

01:03:48.498 --> 01:03:53.048
for example, now, you
are a wife in a family,

01:03:53.048 --> 01:03:54.781
you are a husband in a family.

01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:59.691
Now how you treat your wife? Do you
treat her like a goddess of the family?

01:03:59.729 --> 01:04:01.618
Do you?

01:04:01.634 --> 01:04:06.549
Do you treat your husband as a
man who brings God in the family?

01:04:06.555 --> 01:04:11.528
You see, this auspiciousness is the way,
how you feel about, is the auspiciousness.

01:04:11.546 --> 01:04:16.388
How you feel about a chair? You
sit on the chair; say for example,

01:04:16.431 --> 01:04:21.393
now how do you feel about the chair? Do you
feel it’s a chair because it’s very expensive?

01:04:21.393 --> 01:04:25.786
Because it is your own? Or because
somebody has given you?

01:04:25.812 --> 01:04:31.462
The reverence is there, about the chair, that, “No,
it is the chair which was occupied by my mother

01:04:31.478 --> 01:04:34.982
so it is to be revered, or by my
father, so it is to be revered,

01:04:34.982 --> 01:04:39.151
or it is just a chair which
is handled just for utility

01:04:39.151 --> 01:04:43.271
or you have just got it for a
some sort of a deviant thing?

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:47.059
Wherever you sit, now, say for
meditation: you are sitting in a place.

01:04:47.059 --> 01:04:51.049
I have seen people doing all kinds of
funny things, in the name of meditation.

01:04:51.066 --> 01:04:54.596
For example, they’ll be
smoking first, you see.

01:04:54.596 --> 01:04:59.396
Now what are you going to do? The
smoke, the what do you call the.....

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.404
ashtray would be just there

01:05:01.418 --> 01:05:06.398
and then they would put their feet like
this, “Now let us do the meditation!”

01:05:09.146 --> 01:05:11.646
This aspect is very much
missing here because

01:05:11.646 --> 01:05:16.806
people have lost all that. I think they
had it very much there, but it is lost.

01:05:16.806 --> 01:05:19.666
And auspiciousness is a very, very sort of a thing

01:05:19.676 --> 01:05:22.306
which gradually, when you train
yourself, you’ll understand.

01:05:22.356 --> 01:05:26.596
And by auspiciousness you will
understand the value of matter.

01:05:26.639 --> 01:05:30.497
You will not value the matter then,
but the auspiciousness of it.

01:05:30.521 --> 01:05:38.813
To you, the important thing will be say a
hair from the head of Mohammed Prophet.

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:44.383
It’s much more auspicious than
all the world put together.

01:05:44.383 --> 01:05:46.383
I went to Kashmir as I told you,

01:05:46.383 --> 01:05:51.383
and we were just crossing through and I asked
the driver, I said, “What’s this place?”

01:05:51.383 --> 01:05:54.903
He said, “Why?” I said.
“Is there any temple here?

01:05:54.946 --> 01:05:57.663
What is this place?
It’s so beautiful?”

01:05:57.694 --> 01:06:01.664
So my husband looked around, he said, “What’s beautiful about it? I don’t understand.

01:06:01.664 --> 01:06:03.494
There’s nothing here, around?”

01:06:03.494 --> 01:06:09.337
He said, “No, there is nothing. But there’s
a place just there, you can see that,

01:06:09.347 --> 01:06:12.497
where the hair of Mohammed Prophet is kept.”

01:06:12.497 --> 01:06:15.085
I said, “That’s it!”

01:06:15.135 --> 01:06:20.405
No joy, beauty, I could ever get
it from anywhere from any place.

01:06:20.405 --> 01:06:25.980
It could be very beautiful, you may
feel that, “This is the heaven here!” .

01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:27.630
For me it may not be there.

01:06:27.629 --> 01:06:33.339
It may be that place where one hair of
Mohammed Prophet is sitting.

01:06:33.352 --> 01:06:35.222
It’s auspicious.

01:06:35.222 --> 01:06:38.942
Auspiciousness is judged through vibrations.

01:06:38.969 --> 01:06:42.845
So you cannot say, “How are you
to judge the auspiciousness?”

01:06:42.863 --> 01:06:47.265
Through your vibrations you can. So use your
vibratory awareness for auspiciousness.

01:06:48.935 --> 01:06:51.435
That’s how you can look after your Left Side,

01:06:51.435 --> 01:06:54.454
which I have told you
in a very short way.

01:06:54.488 --> 01:06:56.548
For that you don’t
have to read books

01:06:56.555 --> 01:06:59.708
and you don’t have to say, “How many
times, Mother, I should wash my hands?

01:06:59.708 --> 01:07:03.963
How many times I should give
this bandhan and all that?”

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:08.904
It’s only when you get your vibrations the
best, that’s the most auspicious time.

01:07:08.914 --> 01:07:11.414
Keep it at that point, because
again into the rituals

01:07:11.414 --> 01:07:15.274
you’ll go, “Hold it with your left hand
and hold it with your right hand,”

01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:19.223
and all going wrong. And then some, “Oh,
Mother I did the wrong way!” Then what is it?

01:07:19.254 --> 01:07:20.649
That’s not the way!

01:07:20.649 --> 01:07:23.153
The thing is, the essence of it,

01:07:23.153 --> 01:07:27.193
if you get your vibrations all right,
that’s what is to be auspicious.

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:30.200
Maybe when you are sitting down you
are not getting your vibrations,

01:07:30.237 --> 01:07:32.470
you think that maybe might
go something wrong with it:

01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:36.110
is it I am not revered properly?
Let me have the vibrations.

01:07:36.154 --> 01:07:37.648
Why, what’s the matter?

01:07:37.648 --> 01:07:41.384
Why is it that I am not
feeling the vibrations well?

01:07:41.384 --> 01:07:45.105
That’s how it should be. You can
judge it through your vibrations

01:07:45.139 --> 01:07:47.899
Now auspiciousness is very
important for Sahaja Yogis

01:07:47.919 --> 01:07:53.117
because all that they do
should be auspicious.

01:07:53.137 --> 01:07:57.846
Whatever is inauspicious
you shouldn’t do.

01:07:57.857 --> 01:08:00.247
Now you will be surprised,
sometimes you might think

01:08:00.247 --> 01:08:03.837
that say going to a particular
place is very important.

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:07.367
But maybe you will find that
you have lost your purse

01:08:07.367 --> 01:08:11.420
or you cannot go there or may be that
somehow or the other that the road is blocked,

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.820
you have to go by another way.

01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:14.610
Accept it!

01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:17.110
Maybe that is auspicious.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.179
Maybe that you have
to go that way.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:22.239
Maybe there is somebody who
is waiting for you there,

01:08:22.252 --> 01:08:25.829
you have to give your vibrations to
that place, there is some need there

01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:28.539
because you are an instrument
of auspiciousness.

01:08:28.539 --> 01:08:30.648
You have to spread the auspiciousness.

01:08:30.657 --> 01:08:36.469
And what is auspiciousness? Is
nothing but the blessings of God.

01:08:36.489 --> 01:08:39.339
To feel the blessings of God.

01:08:39.369 --> 01:08:41.869
He blesses you all the time.

01:08:41.869 --> 01:08:45.809
His hand is all the time on
your hand, He looks after you.

01:08:45.809 --> 01:08:48.572
When you seek auspiciousness
you seek His hand.

01:08:48.572 --> 01:08:51.939
You are always under His hand.

01:08:53.882 --> 01:08:58.899
He’s your shepherd. You are all
the time under His guidance.

01:08:58.929 --> 01:09:03.899
That is what auspiciousness
is, in the real sense.

01:09:03.919 --> 01:09:06.299
To feel it, all angels around you.

01:09:06.299 --> 01:09:11.260
Everybody is there to help. Everybody
is trying to bring you to Reality:

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:14.879
that is the auspiciousness.

01:09:14.879 --> 01:09:21.089
Once you start doing it gradually you will
find the joy of living will pour into you,

01:09:21.106 --> 01:09:28.696
the joy of God’s blessings will pour
into you, when you will feel His hands.

01:09:28.696 --> 01:09:33.756
It is not important that you become
a very successful person in life.

01:09:33.756 --> 01:09:36.826
I have seen such successful people
in life, so-called successful:

01:09:36.826 --> 01:09:42.501
so unhappy, so miserable, so terrible
and so boring and so troublesome.

01:09:44.902 --> 01:09:48.202
They are good for nothing! People say,
“Oh! He has died, it’s a good thing!”

01:09:50.982 --> 01:09:54.242
They have done no good to anybody,
nobody bothers about them.

01:09:54.242 --> 01:09:56.292
When they are in position
people look after them,

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:58.825
once they are gone nobody
even bothers about them.

01:10:00.046 --> 01:10:05.302
Auspiciousness gives you the
right idea of Divine importance,

01:10:05.333 --> 01:10:08.439
means where the Divinity
flows behind you

01:10:08.447 --> 01:10:12.753
and goes around you and takes you
around and gives you the complete joy:

01:10:12.753 --> 01:10:16.013
the movement of the wind.

01:10:16.013 --> 01:10:19.013
It’s a beautiful thing to be auspicious.

01:10:20.511 --> 01:10:25.003
It takes you away from inauspiciousness
when you ask for auspiciousness.

01:10:26.633 --> 01:10:28.861
But do not make a ritual out of it,

01:10:28.861 --> 01:10:31.701
which I want to tell you hundred
and hundred and one times

01:10:31.733 --> 01:10:34.233
that do not make a ritual of anything

01:10:34.233 --> 01:10:37.431
because you deaden it, like
all other people have done it.

01:10:37.431 --> 01:10:41.900
I hope after my death you
people do not do all this.

01:10:41.919 --> 01:10:45.180
Because then it becomes a superstition.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.819
Auspiciousness should never
be confused with superstition.

01:10:49.819 --> 01:10:52.319
Because people were not that alert

01:10:52.319 --> 01:10:55.989
and not so subtle they could
not make out what is ugliness,

01:10:55.989 --> 01:10:59.569
that is superstition, and what is
beauty, that is auspiciousness.

01:10:59.569 --> 01:11:03.119
They made all mistakes and they
committed all these crimes

01:11:03.119 --> 01:11:07.362
But you people be careful,
because you are subtle people.

01:11:09.232 --> 01:11:12.642
Do not make it a superstitious thing,

01:11:12.654 --> 01:11:16.332
but an auspicious thing.

01:11:16.352 --> 01:11:20.291
When you speak, it
should be auspicious.

01:11:20.302 --> 01:11:24.001
I have seen many people have a habit
of speaking very inauspicious things,

01:11:24.001 --> 01:11:27.721
especially with the left
Vishuddhi – very inauspicious.

01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:33.855
Like you invite somebody to
your house for a dinner party.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:39.433
And he says, “Oh! I saw such a crowd coming
in I felt that there was a fire on!”

01:11:41.395 --> 01:11:44.796
And what a thing to say! He
thinks he has been smart,

01:11:44.815 --> 01:11:47.315
a very smart man to
say such a thing.

01:11:48.865 --> 01:11:54.505
Or he’ll utter a very dirty joke at the
time when there’s a wedding going on.

01:11:54.526 --> 01:11:55.745
There are many people.

01:11:55.754 --> 01:12:02.384
The inauspiciousness can
form such a satanic force.

01:12:02.412 --> 01:12:06.394
Most of the tantrism has come
out of inauspicious people.

01:12:08.911 --> 01:12:14.948
Do you know this, that tantrism is
nothing but inauspicious mastery?

01:12:16.878 --> 01:12:19.378
Before the Deity, before the Gods,

01:12:19.378 --> 01:12:22.528
if you do something
extremely inauspicious,

01:12:22.559 --> 01:12:27.218
you make the attention of the Gods and
all its protection to get out of it

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:32.975
and then you do all satanic things there.
This is the basis of all these tantrikas.

01:12:39.281 --> 01:12:43.977
What is hell? Is nothing
but inauspicious living.

01:12:44.001 --> 01:12:47.881
Because the attention of this God is
not on you, the blessings are not there.

01:12:50.519 --> 01:12:57.159
Then you will understand that
vibrations teach you auspiciousness.

01:12:59.234 --> 01:13:01.734
You think of somebody and
you get stinging, “Oh God!

01:13:01.734 --> 01:13:05.105
What a man he is!” You may
think he is a very big man

01:13:05.119 --> 01:13:08.869
immediately you say, “Oh, he is inauspicious.
We have nothing to do with him.”

01:13:10.935 --> 01:13:16.580
Sahaja Yogis should not aspire for the
worldly success and worldly things,

01:13:16.604 --> 01:13:20.444
but for auspicious things, so that
they get the blessings of God.

01:13:20.464 --> 01:13:23.874
Because those who have got also
all kinds of worldly things

01:13:23.884 --> 01:13:30.384
are the most wretched souls ever living
and are a curse to this Mother Earth.

01:13:30.384 --> 01:13:33.334
She is fed up with them. They are sinful.

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:41.094
I do not want to tell you, if
people behave in this manner,

01:13:41.112 --> 01:13:42.894
where they will go
and what will happen,

01:13:42.894 --> 01:13:45.815
because that’s too much for
me to say at this juncture.

01:13:45.814 --> 01:13:47.774
But that is what it is

01:13:47.773 --> 01:13:56.803
about, I would say, your great poet, say
Blake, has talked about it and told about it.

01:13:56.843 --> 01:13:59.493
The Hell, he has described.

01:13:59.493 --> 01:14:03.943
So many of them have described,
I do not want to elaborate on it.

01:14:03.943 --> 01:14:08.513
The other side is the Right side, how
to get out of the second side of it.

01:14:11.646 --> 01:14:15.743
What is the subtle point of the Right side?

01:14:15.766 --> 01:14:18.266
Is discipline.

01:14:21.166 --> 01:14:25.896
You see, first you have to say,
England was a very disciplined country,

01:14:25.906 --> 01:14:29.506
over disciplined, artificially disciplined,

01:14:29.516 --> 01:14:32.016
militarily regimented type.

01:14:32.016 --> 01:14:34.366
I do not mean that discipline at all.

01:14:34.366 --> 01:14:39.034
The discipline which is in
you.  It comes automatically.

01:14:42.425 --> 01:14:45.265
Not regimentation! Again the
confusion should not be there,

01:14:45.265 --> 01:14:47.655
because I want to make
it extremely clear.

01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:52.635
It’s very easy to confuse
things because of these knots.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:59.355
So, when I say that you must have discipline,

01:14:59.362 --> 01:15:02.235
is an inner discipline, absolute inner.

01:15:02.235 --> 01:15:05.127
You don’t have to do anything
about it, but it is built in,

01:15:05.154 --> 01:15:09.677
because you start enjoying
that discipline within you.

01:15:09.703 --> 01:15:14.474
Discipline is, in Sanskrit language,
we can call it as sadachar

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:17.780
is ‘good behaviour,’ actually,
if you translate it.

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.800
But is much more than that,

01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:23.090
is much more sadachar is much more.

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:27.272
It is a discipline: what time
we get up in the morning?

01:15:27.277 --> 01:15:30.550
How do we greet the morning?

01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:33.357
The sun has risen.

01:15:33.346 --> 01:15:35.437
“What’s wrong in getting
up at ten o’clock?”

01:15:35.437 --> 01:15:37.937
“Nothing wrong my child,

01:15:39.227 --> 01:15:42.444
but you are losing the
beauty of the morning.”

01:15:42.457 --> 01:15:46.594
Morning time is the time when the
sun is coming, the rays are coming.

01:15:46.594 --> 01:15:51.681
That is the special time when the
sun throws its real rays of Divinity.

01:15:53.721 --> 01:15:56.221
Actually the Right side is the sun side,

01:15:56.221 --> 01:16:00.093
and it starts with your rising
in the morning, very much.

01:16:00.075 --> 01:16:04.333
But not the hatha yogi style
where you become bony people,

01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:08.643
where you fast for three hundred days

01:16:08.643 --> 01:16:12.133
and then three hundred days
you go on shouting at people

01:16:12.133 --> 01:16:14.633
and three hundred days
you start cursing them.

01:16:16.503 --> 01:16:17.883
I do not mean that.

01:16:17.893 --> 01:16:24.293
By discipline I mean that a certain
amount of respect for yourself.

01:16:24.303 --> 01:16:27.583
It is a respect. As there is auspiciousness,

01:16:27.586 --> 01:16:30.906
this is a respect of your
own being because it is ego.

01:16:30.906 --> 01:16:33.306
How much you respect
your ego, Let me see?

01:16:36.404 --> 01:16:41.504
Assert your ego is different from
respecting your ahambhav, your dignity.

01:16:45.394 --> 01:16:49.975
Your position in life,
how much do you respect?

01:16:50.015 --> 01:16:52.515
Do you sell it for money?

01:16:52.515 --> 01:16:56.424
Do you sell it for a chair?

01:16:56.441 --> 01:16:58.941
Do you sell it for any positions in life?

01:17:02.391 --> 01:17:04.891
A kind of a discipline within yourself:

01:17:04.891 --> 01:17:07.391
not to jabber too much,

01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:13.779
not to talk less. But that doesn’t
mean that you try the balancing of it

01:17:13.779 --> 01:17:18.859
it’s something innately built in which
can work out through Sahaja Yoga

01:17:18.859 --> 01:17:21.989
if you see your vibrations, again.

01:17:25.249 --> 01:17:27.749
You have to be respectable.

01:17:30.174 --> 01:17:35.103
In the first one, you have to respect, and in
the second one, you have to be respectable.

01:17:36.653 --> 01:17:39.153
Respect yourself.

01:17:40.303 --> 01:17:44.001
People think that, supposing
they don’t bathe their body

01:17:44.007 --> 01:17:46.841
for months together, “What’s
wrong?” Nothing wrong.

01:17:48.385 --> 01:17:53.075
If you do not respect yourself,
nature is not going to respect you

01:17:56.003 --> 01:18:01.993
Physically you should respect,
mentally, emotionally.

01:18:01.993 --> 01:18:08.703
If say you like to see pornographic photos

01:18:08.748 --> 01:18:11.248
you have no respect for yourself.

01:18:15.678 --> 01:18:19.618
If you want to eat filth, you
have no respect for yourself.

01:18:20.925 --> 01:18:26.235
You want to waste your eyes, you want
to waste your attention with this.

01:18:30.283 --> 01:18:35.634
You shouldn’t like anything that
is absurd, useless, frivolous.

01:18:35.635 --> 01:18:43.869
You shouldn’t charge your chakras with
something nonsensical and filthy.

01:18:43.909 --> 01:18:49.685
When you start respecting yourself you
will really know how to respect others.

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:53.354
Those who cannot respect
themselves cannot respect others.

01:18:58.354 --> 01:19:01.074
And respect that is good in others.

01:19:03.734 --> 01:19:07.171
And do not worry about their faults
but respect them for their good

01:19:07.177 --> 01:19:11.961
so that you also have good in
you and you respect yourself.

01:19:11.959 --> 01:19:16.327
That is not asserting, this
respect is never asserting,

01:19:16.317 --> 01:19:18.817
it’s very comforting,

01:19:18.849 --> 01:19:27.447
extremely comforting. A person who respects
himself is the most congenial person to live with.

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:29.962
He doesn’t come forward too much,

01:19:29.982 --> 01:19:32.652
neither he recedes back too much.

01:19:32.652 --> 01:19:37.354
He’s just there.

01:19:38.804 --> 01:19:40.454
Like a wise man,

01:19:40.454 --> 01:19:44.689
you know he’s there: you can
always approach such a person.

01:19:47.493 --> 01:19:49.993
He doesn’t do anything outwardly.

01:19:49.993 --> 01:19:52.493
He doesn’t try to show off.

01:19:52.493 --> 01:19:57.082
He doesn’t try to create a
sort of an aura about him.

01:19:57.113 --> 01:20:03.682
He’s not boasting about himself.

01:20:04.997 --> 01:20:07.497
Ego can be easily handled

01:20:08.517 --> 01:20:11.017
if you respect yourself.

01:20:18.367 --> 01:20:20.867
Then you will not feel hurt.

01:20:20.867 --> 01:20:27.561
Because who can be insulting
but yourself to yourself?

01:20:30.624 --> 01:20:35.887
Supposing there are some

01:20:35.887 --> 01:20:38.674
dogs barking at an elephant,

01:20:38.707 --> 01:20:43.268
he just, “Swish, swish,” he goes on like that. Have you seen an elephant? Very interesting.

01:20:43.268 --> 01:20:45.058
He walks and his majestic way.

01:20:45.058 --> 01:20:49.490
And he finds some dog barking he just,
“Swish, swish!” Very nicely he does.

01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:52.668
He puts them like that, you see. Like
a little child whistling at that

01:20:52.668 --> 01:20:57.335
and goes on its own majestic way. He says,
“Oh you doggy! It’s all right, come along.”

01:20:57.335 --> 01:21:00.628
He is not bothered as to how they treat him.

01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:04.954
They bark at him and he just
walks, in his dignity.

01:21:04.954 --> 01:21:09.230
That’s why we say that an elephant
is a very dignified animal.

01:21:09.247 --> 01:21:12.274
It walks with its dignity.

01:21:14.414 --> 01:21:17.864
A person like that doesn’t take to
cheap fashions and cheap things:

01:21:17.898 --> 01:21:21.881
he is in his own dignity.

01:21:21.911 --> 01:21:27.351
He does not try to adjust himself to the
norms of things that they have created.

01:21:27.351 --> 01:21:29.831
You cannot play into the
hands of these bogus people,

01:21:29.835 --> 01:21:33.085
who say that your weight should
be, I don’t know how much,

01:21:33.085 --> 01:21:37.525
and your this thing should be so
much. All the women trying to do that.

01:21:37.555 --> 01:21:40.055
Tomorrow they may come and say
your hair should be so long.

01:21:40.055 --> 01:21:43.263
So you become like this, so all
the women trying to do that.

01:21:43.283 --> 01:21:46.744
You must wear wigs, so everybody
is trying to wear wigs.

01:21:46.764 --> 01:21:51.024
You don’t play into their hands anymore
once you start respecting yourself.

01:21:52.924 --> 01:21:58.419
Like in India, they started a
fashion of sleeves you see.

01:21:58.436 --> 01:22:01.369
They started first from
here, so much sleeves.

01:22:01.376 --> 01:22:05.776
Then they said, “So much sleeves, so much
sleeves,” then some said, “So much sleeves!”

01:22:05.776 --> 01:22:09.726
Then some said, “So much
sleeves!” You see, it goes on.

01:22:09.746 --> 01:22:12.246
So somebody asked
me, “What about you?”

01:22:12.246 --> 01:22:15.736
I said, “I had them from my, the very beginning,

01:22:15.759 --> 01:22:19.926
and I am going to have them that way only,
because it’s too much to run this race. I cannot!”

01:22:24.646 --> 01:22:28.760
Because I have a tailor who does this job, now,
I have no time to waste for all this nonsense,

01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:32.300
and why? What is the need?

01:22:34.213 --> 01:22:36.958
Whatever has been found out
traditionally is accepted.

01:22:36.958 --> 01:22:40.738
And you will find all these
fashions drop out just like that!

01:22:42.658 --> 01:22:45.818
Now, in our saris also, we
have fashions come up.

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:49.138
You see, there was a fashion of sari
where they wanted to have a mini saris.

01:22:49.148 --> 01:22:52.964
You see, whatever fashions you have
they want to have the fashion!

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:55.468
And you don’t know about
this? It’s very interesting.

01:22:55.468 --> 01:22:59.408
They used to have mini saris. So mini
saris could be only up to this point.

01:23:00.524 --> 01:23:04.469
And they started going up,
up to this point, you know.

01:23:04.484 --> 01:23:06.609
Some people tried to do it on all them,

01:23:06.609 --> 01:23:11.055
and then they gave up, they said, “It’s
nothing doing! It doesn’t look nice, you see.”

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:15.869
And it was started by a company because
they wanted to sell more yarn, you see.

01:23:15.897 --> 01:23:20.879
By mini saris they could sell more yarn and
charge the same for a sari because half-sari

01:23:20.879 --> 01:23:24.366
and you sell it as a mini. It’s
only mini, and money is double!

01:23:24.383 --> 01:23:29.156
So they tried it! But it failed in
India, so the sari remains the same.

01:23:29.162 --> 01:23:33.972
Then they started printing only the front part of
the saris, this is a new fashion, then another.

01:23:33.972 --> 01:23:38.457
I said, “Nothing doing! You better buy one
traditional sari which lasts you all your life!”

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:40.972
You can sort it out. All these
things fall off, you see.

01:23:40.972 --> 01:23:43.602
Like in Victorian times they
must have worked out many things

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:45.282
it falls off. Then something falls off.

01:23:45.295 --> 01:23:48.883
Something traditional that is
there may not be useful today

01:23:48.888 --> 01:23:53.625
but something eternally traditional will be
there all your life. That is really traditional.

01:23:53.625 --> 01:23:59.979
Whichever falls off, which goes off, people find
it useless, it is no good, then throw it out.

01:23:59.999 --> 01:24:02.109
Now many things that you are
doing, for example nowadays

01:24:02.109 --> 01:24:08.089
people are putting those
pins inside the cheeks.

01:24:08.103 --> 01:24:11.003
Now, they are putting them I have seen
them: putting them in nose there,

01:24:11.003 --> 01:24:14.049
putting a pin here; putting a pin here.

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:18.723
This all will go away! After some time you will
find them putting something in their hair.

01:24:18.715 --> 01:24:21.215
Let them do it. They are foolish people.

01:24:21.215 --> 01:24:25.725
But this is nothing. They can do something
in a very subtle manner, you see.

01:24:25.744 --> 01:24:28.244
Like the Elizabethan collar you had.

01:24:28.244 --> 01:24:33.694
Because Queen Elizabeth had some problem in the back here, so they started Elizabethan collar.

01:24:33.694 --> 01:24:36.509
So everybody started wearing
an Elizabethan collar.

01:24:36.509 --> 01:24:40.859
Then, at the time of Victoria, she had
some sort of a problem at the back here.

01:24:40.892 --> 01:24:44.299
So, she started a thing. Everybody
started wearing it. Why?

01:24:46.439 --> 01:24:48.939
You have your attire, dress, your sitting position.

01:24:48.939 --> 01:24:52.364
Your thinking itself is
not fashioned by others,

01:24:54.104 --> 01:24:58.579
it is only fashioned through
your vibratory awareness.

01:25:03.841 --> 01:25:05.509
Immediately if you read a book,

01:25:05.507 --> 01:25:09.457
you come on to the point and you
say, “Oh! This is not true,

01:25:09.487 --> 01:25:12.983
but it is this what is true in this!”

01:25:13.003 --> 01:25:14.633
Immediately you start
scanning the books:

01:25:14.633 --> 01:25:16.963
you know which is the true book,
which is not the true book.

01:25:16.963 --> 01:25:19.463
You just don’t read nonsense,
because you know it’s all falsehood,

01:25:19.463 --> 01:25:22.333
it’s all story telling.

01:25:22.333 --> 01:25:24.133
You do not want to read
something nonsensical.

01:25:24.151 --> 01:25:29.111
So you just understand the sense and
the nonsense of it. So it works out.

01:25:29.143 --> 01:25:32.771
And that’s how, when you
start respecting yourself,

01:25:32.793 --> 01:25:34.882
respecting your thoughts,

01:25:34.893 --> 01:25:37.232
respecting your inspirations,

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:39.732
your dreams,

01:25:39.732 --> 01:25:42.902
your aspirations, your visions,

01:25:44.642 --> 01:25:49.755
write them down. Whatever
thought you get, write it down.

01:25:49.755 --> 01:25:52.255
Whatever inspiration
you get, write it down.

01:25:52.255 --> 01:25:57.172
Whatever visions you think you should
have for yourself, write it down.

01:25:57.172 --> 01:26:03.762
All that you think that should be the
future, write it down, and pray for it.

01:26:03.782 --> 01:26:07.562
The greatest quality on this one
is when you respect yourself.

01:26:08.492 --> 01:26:13.026
When you respect yourself, you are respected.

01:26:13.034 --> 01:26:16.094
By whom? By the Gods,

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:20.975
by the Divine Force, by all the angels,

01:26:20.984 --> 01:26:25.775
and whatever you want to do, will be done.

01:26:25.805 --> 01:26:28.985
Then it comes, “Thy will be done!”

01:26:31.015 --> 01:26:35.914
But that will has to come
out of respect for yourself.

01:26:38.256 --> 01:26:41.246
If it is coming out of some
other considerations,

01:26:41.246 --> 01:26:45.296
for example, now in Bombay
they want to have an ashram.

01:26:45.326 --> 01:26:48.286
People have all funny ideas about ashrams.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:50.176
They want to have an ashram:

01:26:50.176 --> 01:26:54.256
why having this ashram? Some people
are very clever, I know all of them.

01:26:54.268 --> 01:26:57.996
And they think they can
make some money out of it.

01:26:57.996 --> 01:26:59.681
Foolish things as they are.

01:26:59.684 --> 01:27:02.184
Then some of them think
that by staying there,

01:27:02.184 --> 01:27:04.684
“We can pass our old age very nicely,

01:27:04.684 --> 01:27:08.926
it will be a cheap thing, because Mataji
is not going to charge anything extra,

01:27:08.926 --> 01:27:12.663
so it will be a nice cheap
thing. Let’s buy that.”

01:27:12.666 --> 01:27:16.113
Some of them are thinking,
“It’s a very good place where,

01:27:16.126 --> 01:27:22.496
in young age we can go there and, it will
be a good idea, we can run away from work.

01:27:22.496 --> 01:27:27.446
We’ll stay in the ashram and after all
Sahaja Yoga won’t be that hard work you see.

01:27:27.486 --> 01:27:30.356
So it will be nice living there.”

01:27:30.386 --> 01:27:33.796
All these considerations, when they
are in the minds of the people

01:27:33.796 --> 01:27:36.986
you will never get your ashram
done, take it from me.

01:27:36.986 --> 01:27:39.486
“We’ll sleep till ten o’clock,
who is going to wake us up?”

01:27:39.486 --> 01:27:43.457
“We’ll do whatever we like in the ashram.
We’ll use it for our own purposes,”

01:27:43.457 --> 01:27:47.036
“We will not do any meditation. We
will not do anything, whatsoever!”

01:27:47.036 --> 01:27:52.712
“We’ll do no work at all. We’ll not help
anything in the organising of Sahaja Yoga

01:27:52.712 --> 01:27:55.212
or an organising people,
we will not bring them.”

01:27:55.212 --> 01:27:57.712
After all what will happen?

01:27:57.712 --> 01:28:00.212
You’ll lose your vibrations.

01:28:03.772 --> 01:28:06.272
If you respect yourself,

01:28:06.272 --> 01:28:09.124
the expression of your
Self must be respected.

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:13.494
Tell your body to behave itself,

01:28:13.494 --> 01:28:16.910
tell your mind to behave itself,

01:28:16.906 --> 01:28:20.304
and tell your emotions to behave itself.

01:28:20.324 --> 01:28:24.886
I have seen people hankering
after a girlfriend or a boyfriend

01:28:24.916 --> 01:28:28.293
and asking for this and asking for that.

01:28:31.936 --> 01:28:36.533
And then coming to me and telling, “Mother, what
can I do about this girlfriend or a boyfriend?”

01:28:36.533 --> 01:28:40.766
or some sort of a thing like that.

01:28:40.775 --> 01:28:44.766
All these things are not going to help you.

01:28:44.772 --> 01:28:49.491
You have to respect yourself.
You are an entity by yourself.

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:52.452
You are not going to bow down to anyone.

01:28:52.468 --> 01:28:57.795
You are not going to accept anything.

01:28:57.795 --> 01:29:06.041
You are not going to accept anything
that is not respectable for you.

01:29:08.328 --> 01:29:12.841
And this is how you are going
to manage your Right Side.

01:29:12.841 --> 01:29:17.273
Now the centre part is very
important in your seeking.

01:29:21.123 --> 01:29:26.377
In your seeking

01:29:26.374 --> 01:29:30.437
you have to know that you
are seeking your Spirit.

01:29:31.642 --> 01:29:37.872
You are seeking that your attention
should now pour through your Spirit.

01:29:37.882 --> 01:29:42.829
You are not seeking the Spirit but you
are going to become one with the Spirit.

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:46.747
That is your seeking is.

01:29:49.393 --> 01:29:55.836
For that, it is very important
to know about your own chakras.

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:00.396
You must know how they are
caught up and face up to it.

01:30:00.415 --> 01:30:02.455
You must face the truth there.

01:30:02.455 --> 01:30:06.305
You have to be absolutely
honest and truthful about it.

01:30:06.305 --> 01:30:08.715
That’s the point in the centre.

01:30:08.715 --> 01:30:12.868
If you are honest, the
centre point will work out.

01:30:12.868 --> 01:30:18.185
For example, I’ll tell you: I cured a
gentleman who was suffering from, say, cancer.

01:30:19.683 --> 01:30:22.446
I cured him, all right.
He has gone away.

01:30:22.463 --> 01:30:24.326
He didn’t even write
a letter of thanks.

01:30:24.326 --> 01:30:27.046
And if anybody asks him he says,
“Oh no, still I am waiting.”

01:30:27.046 --> 01:30:30.326
Four years have passed, three years have
passed and still "I am waiting for it."

01:30:30.326 --> 01:30:33.726
I don’t know.” He was to
die in three month’s time!

01:30:33.749 --> 01:30:36.249
He has been dishonest to God.

01:30:36.249 --> 01:30:39.336
He should have told people,
“No, Mother has cured me!”

01:30:39.369 --> 01:30:43.362
Then he gets back his cancer.

01:30:43.359 --> 01:30:46.298
And then he blames God for that.

01:30:47.569 --> 01:30:49.688
So truth must be accepted.

01:30:49.688 --> 01:30:52.998
You have to be truthful and
honest for the central path,

01:30:52.998 --> 01:30:55.959
absolute on the truth.

01:30:55.978 --> 01:31:00.405
“Yes, this is the truth we have found
out, we have felt the vibrations.”

01:31:00.411 --> 01:31:03.535
“We are not feeling the vibrations,”

01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:06.101
or there is some mixture.

01:31:06.101 --> 01:31:09.671
“Yes, I am catching on this.” There are many
people say, “No Mother, I’m not catching!”
