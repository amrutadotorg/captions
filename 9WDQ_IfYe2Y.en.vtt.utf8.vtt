00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
- It's that where the cities work.
- You can go for your work.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.580
Staying in the city is not so good for sahaja yogis.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.280
You see, vibration-wise and also not good for your lungs, you see.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.120
It's better to be little away if you want to meditate and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.760
First and foremost thing is that you have to ascend; For that you should be in a place which will help you to ascend

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.840
otherwise if you live in the city, the city have baba, the city all nonsense - can't even meditate properly

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.540
and it's so polluted, it spoils your lungs completely. So it would be nice, it would be little away from the city.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.940
Try to find some house of that kind

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.520
and first you have to give a mortgage for that house which you can do all of you put together

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.820
and then you have to pay the rent of the house as the mortgage, part of the mortgage, so you own it also.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.340
I think, we desire for some time [UNCLEAR], I'll let You know, Mother.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:22.100
- [UNCLEAR]
- He's saying, "I have desired for some time to earn something rather than pay rent."

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.420
You see if you can, whatever is possible, you see, if you can own something, nothing like it but can you -

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.940
you see, this is the way I said that you first pay the first installment - I'd like to know what is it?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.380
How much do you have to pay for the first installment? They said, " It is 10%." If you take a big house,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.340
then 10% would be quite a lot then can somebody pay so much?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.300
- No, so then renting is the best.
- Long journeys

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.400
I mean, in sahaja terms 20 years is not, is an awful long time but

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.460
in terms of a lease it's not very long. You can ask for 20 years lease and

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.900
It can be more; In London you can get it for 99 years lease, you see

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.940
and so you can shift to a place like that and there's also some short leases also - that's very cheap.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.840
So you have to go through all that because you can't afford to pay the basic [DEPOSIT].

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.780
Like in Melbourne, somebody has offered 30 thousand

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.020
but with 30 thousand, three hundred thousand

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.080
pounds worth of thing - is it big enough, yeah - if you are outside?

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.960
Yes Shrimataji, real estate is not as expensive in Brisbane or around Brisbane.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.740
- but you check this side
- It's much cheaper here; Real estate is much cheaper here.
- I see.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.560
So how much, do you think, a big house will cost here?

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.260
- Hardly 70 thousand.
- Very big house?
- Big house

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.760
- Two hundred, say two hundred thousand
- Two hundred thousand

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.840
so 10% would be 20 thousand, so you'll have to put in about 10 thousand pounds, alright?

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.080
I can organize that 10 thousand - I'll see. Then, is it alright?

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:41.360
- Then you can pay the mortgage?
- I'm not sure we would, Shri Mataji.
- Because if you have a lease for say, fifty

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.980
- His work?
- You can go for your work

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.200
Staying in the city is not so good for sahaja yogis, you see, vibration-wise

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.380
and also not good for your lungs, you see. It's better to be little away if you want to meditate and [UNCLEAR].

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.380
First and foremost thing is that you have to ascend, for that you should be in  a place which will help you to ascend.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.180
Otherwise if you live in the city, the city have baba, in the city all nonsense - can't even meditate properly

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.440
and it's so polluted, it spoils your lungs completely so it would be nice, it would be little away from the city.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:40.300
Try to find some house of that kind and first you have to give a mortgage for that house

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.620
which you can do with all of you put together and then you have to pay the rent of the house

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.500
as the mortgage, part of the mortgage so you own it also.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.440
I think, we desire for some time to earn [UNCLEAR] a place, I'll let You know, Mother.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:08.860
- Didn't follow that.
- He's saying I have desire for sometime to earn something rather than pay rent.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.120
You see, if he can, whatever is possible. You see if you can own something, nothing like it but can you;

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:25.340
You see, this is the way I said that you first pay the first installment - I would like to know what is it.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.640
How much do you have to pay for the first installment? They said, "It is 10%."

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.140
If you take a big house, then 10% would be quite a lot and can somebody pay so much?

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.960
- No. So then renting is the best.
- Long term lease.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:53.060
I mean, in sahaja terms twenty years is not, is an awful long time but

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.200
in terms of a lease it's not very long. you can ask for twenty year lease

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.260
It can be more; In London you can get it for 99 years lease, you see,

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:16.160
and so you can shift to a place like that and there's also some short leases also, that's very cheap.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.500
So, you have to go through all that because you can't afford to pay the basic [DEPOSIT].

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.580
Like in Melbourne somebody has offered thirty thousand

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.120
but with thirty thousand, 300 thousand pounds worth of thing is it big enough? Yeah.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.580
- If you are outside?
- Yes, Shri Mataji. Real estate is not as expensive in Brisbane or around Brisbane

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.540
- if you take this side.
- It's much cheaper here, Shri Mataji. Real estate is much cheaper here.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.780
- I see. So how much, you think, a big house will cost here?

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.840
- Hardly 70 thousand.
- Very big house?
- Big house.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.420
- Two hundred, say two hundred thousand
- Definitely.
- Two hundred thousand

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.520
So, 10% would be twenty thousand. So you'll have to put in about ten thousand pounds, alright?

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.320
I can organize that ten thousand - I'll see.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:22.720
Then, is it alright? Then you can pay the mortgage?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:30.460
- I'm not sure - we would share.
- Because if you have a lease for say 15 years, 20 years then you can pay.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.280
Shri Mataji, I live in a house in [UNCLEAR]

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:45.520
and so we could get some money by selling that house although that's a wise thing to do

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:52.320
- just sold my house [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:57.580
He has a house of his own which he could sell to get the money

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:04.700
- I just could, I can't hear because of [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, better [UNCLEAR] it down

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:12.100
- So?
- He says that he has a house that he earns, because he could sell to raise money but he doesn't know whether that's a good idea.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:18.500
Why not, if you can sell that, you can have another bigger house

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:23.180
and in the rent you can have mortgage as well as they can pay back your money.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:29.340
I think what Mother is saying if you did that, you would be in your house and you would rent it to the collective.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.760
- So in fact you could [UNCLEAR]
- No, no, no that he cannot do because

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.200
you see, the amount that he'll have to pay - how much would you fetch from your house?

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.600
- Mother, I get eighty thousand
- About?

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.920
- Eighty thousand
- That doesn't solve the problem

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.620
- It's a big, big deposit eighty thousand.
- Yes it is big deposit

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.620
but that doesn't solve the problem; They have to get the mortgage as well.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.000
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Alright. Then you can compensate it. With the rent

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:11.120
- he can take his own money and the money can go to mortgage as well.
- Hmm. Oh, yes, yes.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:20.480
I'll show the house and if that's suitable option was taken would the house be mine

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.580
Yes, to be, to be this thing, the house should be in your name and mortgage has to be taken - alright?

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.360
and that mortgage can be completed by the rent of these people that they are giving

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.480
plus you can also, they can pay you the money that you have paid for.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.620
Alright, so that that house then becomes the house of these people.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:49.560
Naturally, once they've paid you back then that house becomes the collective property.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.760
Mother, You, You said in the other cities that You want people to live together.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.560
- Yes.
- He's thinking of having a lot of people in one place for

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:09.620
- a lot of smaller [UNCLEAR] spread around.
- No, no, no. You should have

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:15.540
- one big house in which all of you should live - like Burwood.
- Yes, Mother.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.200
That's My - the children and everyone and you could even have a school.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:32.120
As many as can live in that. They should sell all - all of them should sell their houses and adjust it.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:41.820
There're some very nice properties, not very far from here, where you can buy an acre or so of land

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.460
and still be very close to the city.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:52.240
It's much better this kind of thing, if you can do it. Nothing like it if that works out, nothing like it.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:04.340
Yes, in Brisbane you can do that - it is still small. In Sydney if you want to go out - it takes all day to get there.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:11.380
- [UNCLEAR]
- In Brisbane it's possible to do that - you want to have a land outside

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:18.620
- because it's still very close but in Sydney it takes you half a day to get there so it's not good.
- That's correct.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.840
- So you'll buy the land you mean to say - is he saying so?
- He could

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.360
- No it's - then mortgage you can't get na? If you have a house
- You have to build the house on it

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.380
- They give mortgage for building the house?
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, particularly if you own the land

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:42.660
- Is it so? Then you can work it out.
- You have options.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:52.700
A large house, no house and build the house you want [UNCLEAR] you are in Perth, fine, possibly.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.720
- Renovating
- Renovating

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.940
- He now working her out
- Yes, Mother.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.000
First you must find out a big property which is already there - it'll be better.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.140
- [UNCLEAR - I ASKED?] already there.
- Yes, that is the best.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.640
Then renovate it or alter it to suit. Possibly add on to it.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:27.920
For the time being, I think, that's a better idea is to get the house and put the deposit there

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:36.340
and start it in the big house a big property. Also they know each [UNCLEAR] and then charge the rent from the people

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:41.340
which will repay your money as well as the mortgage.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:50.020
- Better now? You put it here also
- Yes, Mother.
 - To that side

00:12:54.780 --> 00:13:01.700
- [UNCLEAR] lunch and then rest, alright. Could I have some lunch?
 - Yes

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:08.600
I think, you just sit down and first of all, find out. If you have the newspaper, I might be able to see something.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:14.240
[LAUGHTER] Let's have the newspaper.

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:21.260
Everyday you have to find out - it's very easy. How we got Shudy Camp? How we did it? I mean, it's all remarkable!

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.800
In sahaja yoga every thing works out, if you have desire.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:33.220
They have to have pure desire and do not go on diverting your mind. Just put your attention to it. You want to have an ashram - it will work.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.580
- [UNCLEAR] Little table
- Hmm

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.500
- Where would You like to have Your lunch Mother?
- Inside.
 - Inside

00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:01.640
- [YOGIS CONVERSING]
- I'll see to

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.520
- [UNCLEAR] for tonight.
- It's beautiful!

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:16.100
- There were three [UNCLEAR] in three different packets
- Friday, yesterday and today, Mother

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.780
- Yeah.
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.980
[UNCLEAR] color again.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.040
Even London it's selling here

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.940
Where do you have this?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:01.460
- This is for the whole of the Australia?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:15.320
- They have also the same mantras, save dollars
- Plus payment

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:25.380
[UNCLEAR] They have got royal [UNCLEAR] things and all these for sale.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.160
[UNCLEAR]

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:58.520
- This is for Victoria?
- No, for Queensland, Shri Mataji.
- This is all Victoria.

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:05.280
No, no this is all, this is the  Golf course, New South Wales, this is all Central and North Queensland

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.100
These all places are all too far away have to be houses

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:23.780
- It is not
- Saturday is the best paper, much better [UNCLEAR]

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:32.600
Quite cheap this one is - see; Five bedrooms, stately home, plus five what

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:38.860
- 106
- 106
- Just imagine!

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:53.520
- Which one?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.580
- About 60 kilometers away. It's too far
- Hot?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:06.680
I don't think this paper is very good, Shri Mataji. They don't put very much in here Sunday paper; It's all in a Saturday

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.320
- [UNCLEAR] No, you see, this was
- Sixty miles away it's too far

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.660
- Oh, I see.
- that's why it's cheap

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:30.660
This is the Saturday paper [UNCLEAR]

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:16.540
- Excuse me Shri Mataji. Would you like some [UNCLEAR - FRUIT?]?
- Now, just see this one.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:25.100
There are for renovation also some - it's quite big.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.740
- This one is [UNCLEAR]
- Very far away?
- That's very far

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.620
- Very far away?
- No, it's about ten kilometers from here, Mother.
- It's not much ten kilometers

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:44.400
- There's another one, quite big.
- Yeah, it's bigger - expensive.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.860
- This will be
- They've not given.
- half a million dollars.
- But here it's uh..

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.100
- This one is nice
- Yes
- and this is some for renovation also.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:06.640
- This whole thing Mother is the old Queensland [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.500
-  and underneath you can do [UNCLEAR] as well - add two floors.
 - This is for renovation but is it alright?

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.560
- This is 
- Area. Annh?
- in a city, very close to the city
- So?

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.820
- Price is not there.
- This is for auction, means go auctions.
- Let us see this.
- Hmm

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:35.400
If you are on the lookout, you might get this. Quite nice; I think, it's quite big also but it hasn't got too many bedrooms and

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:43.120
This fairly small block of land is over 20, 21.6 purchase.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:49.060
- Means quite small?
- Uh.. It's about three quarters of the size of this block.
- Uhh!

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.880
- Very small!
- Yes, Mother.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:02.960
- This is extra large, they said, 'This is extra large house.'
- Hmm. This one looks nice, Mother.
- Hmm. 
- Three [UNCLEAR]

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.300
- This also is auctioned?
- Yes. This big block of land 56 purchase.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.280
[UNCLEAR]

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.460
- This is nice, I think, this looks alright.Why not see this one?
- Yes, Mother.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:25.900
This looks alright to Me.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:35.580
- It's quite spread out
- Yes, Mother.
- Good, then you can do something more than, if the land is too much

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:48.740
and they say, 'Extra large'. This one is

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.220
- It's far away?
- Uh.., somewhere outside, yes.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:03.560
- It's about 15 kilometers from the city, that's 20 kilometers from here.
- Uh huh.

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:13.080
- This [UNCLEAR] is only 10 kilometers you said.
- Yes, but the other thing also is some of the children have started in some schools

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:19.960
- and we better have them going to the same schools, perhaps,  rather than have them change
- To what schools they are going to?

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:27.700
Uh.. this boy Chris is going to High school this year and [UNCLEAR] State School

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:33.120
and so we were thinking of standing [UNCLEAR] in the city.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:41.260
No, but they can come to the school - no problem. See, what I'm trying to say is that, after some time we'll send them to India, isn't it, in any case.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:48.660
It's a question of... [LAUGHTER]

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:04.860
- This one, Mother [UNCLEAR] 10 acres.
- But acres what to do - you can't do anything, na.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:13.340
- Unnh?
- Nice and quiet in there [UNCLEAR] 
- No, no but, you see, you cannot, if you have such a lot of acres, what do you do there?

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:22.820
- Look at that, is it helpful?
- Umm. It could be used for farming or growing vegetables.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:29.840
- [UNCLEAR]
- There's a dam on it. Probably something about one acre will be there or half acre

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:36.520
- Has too much, you see, is a waste; You can't build anything - if you can, then it's alright.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.700
[UNCLEAR - DO NOT?] have too much space.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.100
This one is [UNCLEAR - VERY BIG?]

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:23.160
-  Here this, this is in a city again -
-  Unnh, very big
- houses will be very close together.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.780
- Not very big blocks are there
- About six, six acres is alright?

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:35.480
- Each [UNCLEAR -FRONT?] is for [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm. It's located 800 kilometers away

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:42.760
- Too much! So you have to find out something about, between six and ten.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:50.680
You see something like that? Something. You can. I mean, if you are on the lookout you can easily find out - no problem.[UNCLEAR]

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.820
- Hamilton - very far away?
- Ah.. no Mother, it is just across the river.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:03.260
- That's where
- You know, I listened you out. I think, I can get you on a 845 plane out of Auckland

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:09.000
- Oh, that's very good!
- which will get You in early in the, You know, mid-morning.
- Yes, that's alright! That's very good.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:17.120
- This is where all the very rich people live.[UNCLEAR]
- Is it? But you can live there - why not? [UNCLEAR - YOU ARE NO LESS?]

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:25.140
- It's on the way to the airport, Mother; It's very nice.
- It's a very big block of land
- Let's see, let's see
 - Half acre.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:35.960
- See it's very good is the area is, square meter is not much. Two thousand - two thousand is not much
- Less than half an acre.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:43.700
- Oh, I see - is the area
- Yes.
- What is it? How much you have here?

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:51.440
- Four bedrooms.
- Won't work out
- Yes Mother.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:00.300
- Need not go to a place which has got few this things but this is very far away, you said.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.700
- Yes Mother - 800 kilometers
- Hmm.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:12.400
You have to find out, I mean, I don't know where - which is the closer and which is not but, you see, there're so many

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:18.900
every Saturday. Just go through them and see for yourself whatever you like. These are all for

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:25.280
- uh.. this is all for auctions, I think.
- Yes.
- Why do they auction it?

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.300
- The more expensive ones will be auctioned.
- Oh!
- So the agents make more money.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.420
This, this kind of thing you should see always because you can renovate them and they are better houses always.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.520
- And I don't know which place is - what is this one is?
- This is [UNCLEAR], this is across the river

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.920
- but that is 5 kilometers from here
- Hmm
- It's again a very expensive area

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:23.720
Unnh. It will be, it is [ UNCLEAR] in the, it will be. You should try to make it a

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:32.680
little out; Also good for children. You see, the atmosphere in the city is not so good for their lungs and things - it's also difficult

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.980
Where is Cashmere Place?

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.960
- I don't know that one, Mother.
- It is not so expensive.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.880
- The houses don't seem to be very expensive here, I don't see
- This is the cheapest place in Australia

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.760
- Which one?
- Brisbane is cheapest place in Australia.
- Then you should, you should have, then why not?

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:15.080
Very cheap!

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:34.360
Here they have not written how much [UNCLEAR]

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.720
- Three bedroom
- Three bedroom
- [UNCLEAR]

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.300
You can find out.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:55.460
Children should be out. I don't like them to stay in the cities - it's not good.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.740
They get all the bad things of the city only

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:06.200
- Here lots of nice places are near the
- [UNCLEAR]
- near the ocean.
- [UNCLEAR - YEAH?]

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.000
It's quite good; I don't know how many bedrooms [UNCLEAR]

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:12.300
- Three bedrooms [UNCLEAR]
- Three bedrooms and study

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:24.080
- You will find out - it's not difficult. If it's for renovation, it will be cheaper and we all can renovate it, you see.
- Yes, Mother.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:38.920
It's simple. You should sit down nicely with about five, six newspapers

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.920
and give it to everyone. Let them sit down and find out for themselves

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.620
[UNCLEAR] and if it is for renovation, nothing like it because then you can renovate it the way you like

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:53.080
- and lots of things you can do with it
- and get together to do the work

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:58.480
- Yes, that's a very good idea.
- Yeah
- When you live there, [UNCLEAR] renovating it also

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.820
Better now? Little ice has cured you - just imagine.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:13.500
Doctors will not tell you what is - virus, this, that all kinds of stories.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:20.140
Then I take your leave now, I leave it to you people. Sit down properly and just find out

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.900
because making it will be difficult. You are getting them so cheap just now, maybe,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.420
that the prices are low - why not buy one? Then we'll see about it later.

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.560
Alright, may God bless you!

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:44.840
- This chair is a rocking chair.
- You want [UNCLEAR]
