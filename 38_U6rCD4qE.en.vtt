Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella (Italy), 30 August 1992.

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:09.794
Last time you had asked Me for Gurupada,

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:18.851
and you should know that the essence of Guru

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:22.634
is Shri Ganesha, the innocence.

00:00:24.354 --> 00:00:29.914
You must be knowing the story of a very devoted wife,

00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:34.234
faithful wife, of a sati.

00:00:36.114 --> 00:00:38.674
Her name was Anasuya,

00:00:39.034 --> 00:00:45.074
and she was so religious

00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:48.834
and so dedicated

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:53.394
that they say that the wives of all the gods,

00:00:53.634 --> 00:01:00.234
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, got very jealous of her.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:07.201
So they told their husbands that "You must go and test her,

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:13.514
if she's really a woman with chastity or not."

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.754
So all of them came down as sadhus,

00:01:17.954 --> 00:01:21.714
dressed up like sanyasis.

00:01:22.874 --> 00:01:27.554
And she said she wanted to serve them,

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:30.554
give them something. They said, "No, we want to have food."

00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:33.954
She said, "All right, come and sit down."

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:37.434
She cooked food for them.

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:40.394
So they said, "No, we will not have the food

00:01:40.554 --> 00:01:43.954
unless and until you take out all your clothes.

00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:48.354
We'll only have the food if you take out all your clothes."

00:01:48.994 --> 00:01:51.754
She said, "Is it so?" She said, "Yes."

00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:56.394
So she made them into little, little children, three little children,

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:59.674
and then she became nude,

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:03.714
because innocent doesn't understand anything about it.

00:02:04.314 --> 00:02:07.114
And then she joined them together,

00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:11.554
their three innocences were joined together

00:02:14.074 --> 00:02:20.634
and they got their Gurupada.

00:02:21.514 --> 00:02:25.634
That's how the Adi Guru was created.

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:31.914
So the first thing is that if you want your Gurupad,

00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:34.754
you have to be innocent.

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:40.074
"Innocent" is a very vague term, very vague,

00:02:42.514 --> 00:02:47.954
and difficult to really understand what is innocent.

00:02:48.714 --> 00:02:51.634
But what is the nature of innocence?

00:02:51.954 --> 00:02:57.394
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

00:02:57.754 --> 00:02:58.434
First of all

00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:05.674
He's endowed with wisdom,

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:12.514
and He puts wisdom into us.

00:03:13.554 --> 00:03:20.554
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:28.034
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:35.154
It is He who puts genetics in us.

00:03:37.114 --> 00:03:43.114
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

00:03:44.114 --> 00:03:47.234
and when He puts wisdom in us,

00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:52.074
then we are wise.

00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:58.634
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

00:03:59.794 --> 00:04:03.554
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

00:04:03.794 --> 00:04:05.354
They have no wisdom.

00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:09.034
They do things without wisdom.

00:04:09.274 --> 00:04:14.554
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

00:04:14.914 --> 00:04:18.194
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,

00:04:18.394 --> 00:04:20.634
whatever it is - you may brand yourself with anything;

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.114
but you can see from their behavior they're,

00:04:23.354 --> 00:04:27.034
that they have no wisdom at all.

00:04:29.154 --> 00:04:34.354
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

00:04:35.194 --> 00:04:37.394
In some people who are not yet evolved,

00:04:37.554 --> 00:04:40.434
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

00:04:40.794 --> 00:04:44.034
this wisdom is lacking.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.194
Apart from that,

00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:53.794
this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

00:04:55.914 --> 00:05:02.194
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

00:05:03.154 --> 00:05:06.394
all kinds of bad habits.

00:05:06.914 --> 00:05:10.834
We don't like to look at nudity.

00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:17.354
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

00:05:19.154 --> 00:05:24.634
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

00:05:25.514 --> 00:05:32.114
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

00:05:32.834 --> 00:05:38.474
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:43.634
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

00:05:44.074 --> 00:05:47.394
We are automatically dharmic.

00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:49.554
We don't kill others,

00:05:49.834 --> 00:05:51.674
we don't aggress others,

00:05:51.994 --> 00:05:53.954
we don't torture others.

00:05:54.234 --> 00:05:59.434
We do not occupy anybody else's land or house

00:05:59.634 --> 00:06:03.274
or take away anything,

00:06:04.274 --> 00:06:07.714
another's property or another's things.

00:06:08.114 --> 00:06:13.114
This wisdom comes to you through Shri Ganesh.

00:06:13.634 --> 00:06:20.394
In short, He makes you absolutely ready for Self-Realization.

00:06:21.234 --> 00:06:24.754
It is He only ultimately

00:06:25.074 --> 00:06:26.834
who looks after us

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:31.754
at the time of our nirvana, at the time of our realization,

00:06:32.394 --> 00:06:35.234
because

00:06:35.514 --> 00:06:40.434
He stops all other activities of excretion

00:06:40.914 --> 00:06:47.834
when you are ascending into new realm.

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:53.034
You have seen, I'm sitting here for nine hours, ten hours.

00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:55.874
Once I sat down for eighteen hours together,

00:06:56.074 --> 00:06:59.554
didn't go at all, even to bathroom.

00:07:00.034 --> 00:07:05.194
Because it is He who stops all these activities -

00:07:05.474 --> 00:07:09.314
even when kundalini is rising, it stops.

00:07:10.274 --> 00:07:13.794
So this wisdom is innate,

00:07:14.234 --> 00:07:18.194
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

00:07:18.394 --> 00:07:22.914
He becomes, manifesting in us -

00:07:23.114 --> 00:07:27.714
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

00:07:28.394 --> 00:07:32.434
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

00:07:32.674 --> 00:07:36.714
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:07:37.074 --> 00:07:39.634
You become the child,

00:07:39.874 --> 00:07:42.434
at that time you become a child.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.674
And with the kundalini rising,

00:07:44.874 --> 00:07:48.394
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

00:07:49.074 --> 00:07:51.643
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

00:07:51.818 --> 00:07:54.874
He's the power in the kundalini.

00:07:55.354 --> 00:07:57.914
He gives wisdom in the brain.

00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:03.274
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:07.874
all your attachments which are wrong,

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:13.874
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

00:08:14.794 --> 00:08:17.394
He changes, your genetics are changed.

00:08:17.674 --> 00:08:21.314
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

00:08:21.554 --> 00:08:23.874
about the same I would say,

00:08:24.234 --> 00:08:30.314
and the genetics of other people would be different.

00:08:30.794 --> 00:08:33.514
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:36.834
because Indians normally are very wise people.

00:08:37.018 --> 00:08:39.586
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

00:08:39.707 --> 00:08:42.794
the superiority of races from wisdom point of view,

00:08:42.994 --> 00:08:44.474
Indians are very wise.

00:08:44.714 --> 00:08:48.194
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

00:08:48.434 --> 00:08:51.674
Even the children I have seen, children from the West

00:08:51.954 --> 00:08:54.314
when they go to India: they went for this school,

00:08:54.435 --> 00:08:57.312
they are doing all kinds of destructive things to themselves --

00:08:57.433 --> 00:08:59.113
nobody could understand.

00:08:59.234 --> 00:09:01.914
Once they jumped into a dirty pond.

00:09:02.234 --> 00:09:03.554
They got malaria.

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:07.834
Then they ran out of the house, of the school

00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:12.874
and came out and went to the roads, went to the shops.

00:09:13.314 --> 00:09:14.754
So they put a gate.

00:09:14.994 --> 00:09:17.914
When they put the gate the newspaper is criticizing us,

00:09:18.194 --> 00:09:21.114
there's no sense in it, every school has a gate.

00:09:21.554 --> 00:09:27.674
So these all unwise, stupid things they do because they lack wisdom.

00:09:28.114 --> 00:09:30.434
A child who has wisdom is extremely cautious,

00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:32.714
he understands the importance of his life.

00:09:33.034 --> 00:09:35.834
He respects his parents, he respects everything

00:09:36.194 --> 00:09:39.554
- automatically, you don't have to tell them.

00:09:39.914 --> 00:09:45.434
Automatically they know what is dharma is, you don't have to tell them.

00:09:45.914 --> 00:09:52.194
That wisdom, this great deity of Ganesha,

00:09:52.714 --> 00:09:55.994
He took His form as Jesus Christ.

00:09:56.394 --> 00:10:03.434
And you all accepted Him as the Lord, which is true also.

00:10:04.714 --> 00:10:09.634
But because your Ganesh Principle was not

00:10:09.954 --> 00:10:13.274
so much developed in these Western countries,

00:10:13.554 --> 00:10:16.954
people took to stupid things.

00:10:17.434 --> 00:10:22.474
This pornography and this kind of a interest in nude women shows

00:10:22.674 --> 00:10:26.994
that there is no wisdom in them, there is no Ganesha in them.

00:10:27.115 --> 00:10:30.434
Though they follow Christ, it's just a lipservice going to the church.

00:10:30.634 --> 00:10:33.386
I don't know if the church also has any Ganesha in them,

00:10:33.507 --> 00:10:35.234
they have no Ganesha.

00:10:35.474 --> 00:10:37.674
The way they lead their life, nobody can say

00:10:37.874 --> 00:10:41.114
they have any sense of holiness and auspiciousness.

00:10:41.394 --> 00:10:45.554
As soon as you get wisdom, you understand holiness and auspiciousness.

00:10:45.794 --> 00:10:48.194
Before that you just call "holy father",

00:10:48.394 --> 00:10:50.514
and holy father is doing all kinds of things

00:10:50.714 --> 00:10:54.994
which can create holes in the organization;

00:10:55.634 --> 00:11:00.874
who takes money, bribes, creates bombs, have women,

00:11:01.074 --> 00:11:05.674
I mean everything -- how can he be holy?

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:10.234
So this wisdom part is so important,

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:12.624
and that's what we should ask

00:11:12.745 --> 00:11:14.994
Ganesha, to make us like children.

00:11:15.194 --> 00:11:20.754
Children have basically wisdom, but not all the children.

00:11:20.954 --> 00:11:22.114
This is the thing is,

00:11:22.354 --> 00:11:26.234
that children in which Shri Ganesha has activated,

00:11:26.514 --> 00:11:31.274
has put this genetic of wisdom, it is there.

00:11:33.074 --> 00:11:36.794
This is one of the greatest things we have to think about:

00:11:36.994 --> 00:11:42.074
is it wise, it is sane? It's not to be logically -

00:11:42.274 --> 00:11:45.274
logically if you believe in something then you can go wrong,

00:11:45.474 --> 00:11:48.113
because there's no strength from within.

00:11:48.234 --> 00:11:51.753
But innately if it becomes that, you won't do it at any cost.

00:11:51.874 --> 00:11:53.673
Now you know yourself,

00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:56.193
all the Sahaja yogis are so different:

00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:58.474
they behave differently, they stand differently,

00:11:58.674 --> 00:12:01.308
they talk differently, they think differently, they

00:12:01.429 --> 00:12:02.914
- everything is different.

00:12:03.114 --> 00:12:06.794
Suddenly he has become, they have become like that.

00:12:07.674 --> 00:12:11.834
And you can't understand, how is it we have become like this?

00:12:12.754 --> 00:12:15.274
They were drinking, they were smoking, drug-taking,

00:12:15.474 --> 00:12:16.634
everything they did.

00:12:16.874 --> 00:12:19.514
But how is it suddenly you changed?

00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:24.634
Because Shri Ganesha has put this wisdom in you.

00:12:26.554 --> 00:12:30.274
Now if you see His character, it's very interesting to watch.

00:12:30.674 --> 00:12:35.314
He's a child, and He's entirely dedicated to His Mother.

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:41.114
He doesn't know any other god, anything else -- complete dedication.

00:12:42.474 --> 00:12:44.074
But is it so with us?

00:12:44.274 --> 00:12:48.874
There also sometimes I find some of the Sahaja Yogis are lacking.

00:12:49.474 --> 00:12:53.914
They lack sincerity, loyalties.

00:12:54.154 --> 00:12:57.434
And I'm shocked sometimes at the periphery they are like that;

00:12:57.674 --> 00:13:01.114
that means they have to ascend still.

00:13:01.994 --> 00:13:03.874
People who have worked with Me,

00:13:04.074 --> 00:13:06.514
I have always tried to pay them sufficiently.

00:13:06.714 --> 00:13:08.314
There's no need to pay,

00:13:08.514 --> 00:13:11.634
because after all I have done so much for your building,

00:13:11.914 --> 00:13:13.634
your body, why should I pay you?

00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:15.554
But I always pay sumptuously,

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:17.434
I look after them, give them ...

00:13:17.634 --> 00:13:21.554
My, My loyalties to you and love cannot be challenged.

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:25.434
But I find them, them being very selfish sometimes,

00:13:25.674 --> 00:13:26.994
extremely selfish.

00:13:27.194 --> 00:13:31.114
They'll do half the work and run away, sometimes they are ....

00:13:31.354 --> 00:13:36.034
their problems, their own problems are much more important.

00:13:36.674 --> 00:13:41.914
Or they just try to find some excuse.

00:13:43.074 --> 00:13:45.394
So many Sahaja Yogis are also like that.

00:13:45.674 --> 00:13:47.234
They are not sincere.

00:13:47.474 --> 00:13:49.914
Sahaja Yoga has given them so much.

00:13:50.114 --> 00:13:53.554
We have to always find out, are we sincere to Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:53.954 --> 00:13:56.314
What are we doing for Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:56.554 --> 00:13:59.794
What have we achieved and what are we doing?

00:14:00.074 --> 00:14:03.554
On the contrary, they become liabilities on Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:03.914 --> 00:14:08.274
Ganesha is never a liability on His Mother.

00:14:14.274 --> 00:14:19.834
For example, someone becomes sick.

00:14:20.154 --> 00:14:23.554
All right, Sahaja Yoga can help you -

00:14:23.754 --> 00:14:27.394
may be, may not be; may be cured, may not be cured.

00:14:27.714 --> 00:14:30.554
If they are not cured then they will say that "See now,

00:14:30.754 --> 00:14:33.714
I was not cured. I'm going to leave Sahaja Yoga."

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:37.434
Then one has to say, "Please leave."

00:14:38.274 --> 00:14:41.714
With the slightest thing they go off, not understanding

00:14:41.954 --> 00:14:45.394
what is important.

00:14:46.474 --> 00:14:49.834
Then they are liabilities, like somebody gets married,

00:14:50.074 --> 00:14:52.434
comes here, "I don't like this wife." Now do what you like,

00:14:52.634 --> 00:14:56.794
the wife sits on My head, and the husband also.

00:14:57.354 --> 00:14:59.314
All kinds of liabilities come in,

00:14:59.554 --> 00:15:03.074
"My husband doesn't do Sahaja Yoga, what should I do?"

00:15:03.314 --> 00:15:06.034
You solve the problem with your husband.

00:15:06.234 --> 00:15:08.314
You solve the problem with your children.

00:15:08.554 --> 00:15:12.234
You have the power to do it; have patience, work it out.

00:15:12.434 --> 00:15:15.554
They'll put us into cases, this, that.

00:15:15.834 --> 00:15:18.234
It is only Sahaja Yogis who can harm Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:18.434 --> 00:15:19.554
can you believe that?

00:15:19.754 --> 00:15:21.714
Nobody else can touch it.

00:15:21.914 --> 00:15:24.194
Unless and until a Sahaja Yogi misbehaves,

00:15:24.394 --> 00:15:26.714
nobody can touch Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:29.034
So we have many cases like that.

00:15:29.234 --> 00:15:30.794
I mean, they have seen My photographs,

00:15:30.994 --> 00:15:32.754
they have seen miraculous photographs,

00:15:32.954 --> 00:15:36.194
they have had realization, everything happened to them,

00:15:36.394 --> 00:15:38.954
they have been so many times helped.

00:15:39.154 --> 00:15:42.514
But suddenly they say, "I want to leave Sahaja Yoga."

00:15:42.714 --> 00:15:44.234
"Very good," I say,

00:15:44.434 --> 00:15:47.954
"those who have to leave should leave immediately."

00:15:48.154 --> 00:15:53.114
As it is there's very little space left in the Heaven,

00:15:54.434 --> 00:15:57.914
and no place for such half-hearted people.

00:15:58.154 --> 00:16:00.314
If they have to leave, they should leave.

00:16:00.554 --> 00:16:04.554
You have to have Ganesha as your ideal.

00:16:04.834 --> 00:16:07.421
It should not be that "I worship Ganesha."

00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:09.592
That way you were worshipping Christ,

00:16:09.713 --> 00:16:11.713
you were worshipping this, worshipping that.

00:16:11.834 --> 00:16:15.194
But what has come inside you, is the point.

00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:19.114
Have you got Shri Ganesha within you?

00:16:19.634 --> 00:16:25.194
Are you following Shri Ganesha with the same devotion, dedication?

00:16:25.554 --> 00:16:30.554
If you ... But you are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

00:16:31.074 --> 00:16:35.874
Shri Ganesha was made with immaculate conception.

00:16:36.514 --> 00:16:39.754
You are also made the same way.

00:16:40.314 --> 00:16:43.994
Your kundalini was raised, was given you the realization

00:16:44.194 --> 00:16:47.514
and you got your second birth, and now you are Sahaja yogis.

00:16:47.714 --> 00:16:51.114
All these things have happened to you

00:16:51.314 --> 00:16:55.434
without having a father.

00:16:57.994 --> 00:17:00.194
If I had not told you that you have a Father,

00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:03.554
you would never have known.

00:17:05.794 --> 00:17:07.354
Like, other gurus, you see,

00:17:07.554 --> 00:17:11.634
they don't want to give credit to anyone.

00:17:12.914 --> 00:17:14.554
So this actually has happened with you,

00:17:14.754 --> 00:17:19.793
you are being made in the same manner as Shri Ganesh.

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.513
Of course you must be having something, you know,

00:17:22.634 --> 00:17:25.194
otherwise I could not have made -- that's also true.

00:17:25.474 --> 00:17:30.754
Supposing the kundalini was missing, now what could I have done?

00:17:31.434 --> 00:17:35.754
If not missing, if it was absolutely crooked;

00:17:36.034 --> 00:17:36.914
if not crooked,

00:17:37.114 --> 00:17:41.154
supposing there were some chakras which were horribly damaged.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:47.834
So, you were also people just ready to have your realization,

00:17:48.194 --> 00:17:50.114
that you were seeking it truly,

00:17:50.434 --> 00:17:56.354
that you had the pure desire to become Sahaja Yogis, no doubt.

00:17:56.794 --> 00:18:00.154
Still, when the growth is taking place,

00:18:00.474 --> 00:18:02.354
you must watch,

00:18:02.554 --> 00:18:07.154
you must see how much sincerity we are giving,

00:18:07.394 --> 00:18:13.354
with what dedication we are working out?

00:18:13.714 --> 00:18:16.234
Now, we have people

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:20.034
who must have gone for postering somewhere, some places

00:18:20.354 --> 00:18:22.034
- not now, it's long time back -

00:18:22.274 --> 00:18:25.794
so they charged Me for their coffee also.

00:18:26.194 --> 00:18:29.194
I said, "All right." Thank God they were not smoking,

00:18:29.394 --> 00:18:33.154
otherwise they would have charged Me!

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:40.234
So from that level, now we are very much changed,

00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:43.234
and some of them have become perfect Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:43.514 --> 00:18:46.714
But still we have people on the periphery,

00:18:47.034 --> 00:18:49.274
and they get nervous at the smallest thing.

00:18:49.514 --> 00:18:53.034
Yesterday there was a storm - has to be a storm.

00:18:53.314 --> 00:18:53.954
You don't know,

00:18:54.154 --> 00:18:59.914
when Christ was carrying His disciples there was a very big storm,

00:19:00.554 --> 00:19:02.354
and then He stopped it.

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.874
Yesterday when you started singing the songs,

00:19:05.074 --> 00:19:06.794
then only the storm stopped,

00:19:07.114 --> 00:19:10.714
just to prove that these songs have such power.

00:19:10.939 --> 00:19:12.633
If such things don't happen,

00:19:12.754 --> 00:19:15.682
how will you know that these songs have the power?

00:19:15.803 --> 00:19:18.879
You think you are just singing just because you are singing.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.331
No, it has a power, these are mantras, these are

00:19:21.452 --> 00:19:23.783
all awakened songs.

00:19:23.904 --> 00:19:27.434
And then it stopped.

00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:30.834
They were saying, "Should we say mantras?" I said,

00:19:31.034 --> 00:19:33.513
"No, nothing." I didn't say things, what you have to do.

00:19:33.634 --> 00:19:36.234
Suddenly they thought of singing,

00:19:36.434 --> 00:19:38.354
and then it worked out.

00:19:38.714 --> 00:19:41.274
Because every time if I have to suggest,

00:19:41.474 --> 00:19:44.914
then when will you use your power?

00:19:45.194 --> 00:19:46.754
All such incidents take place,

00:19:46.954 --> 00:19:49.274
now it was Shri Ganesha's special trick.

00:19:49.395 --> 00:19:50.896
He's the real judge for you.

00:19:51.017 --> 00:19:53.634
You must know because you have seen in Sistine Chapel,

00:19:53.794 --> 00:19:57.434
He is standing there and moving you left and right.

00:19:57.794 --> 00:20:00.514
So there is a testing point also.

00:20:00.714 --> 00:20:03.754
In Sahaja Yoga the door is open, this way.

00:20:04.034 --> 00:20:06.434
But there's a bigger door on the back side

00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:09.514
to throw out people.

00:20:14.314 --> 00:20:18.514
And the judgment is not done by Me so much as by this Ganesha.

00:20:18.754 --> 00:20:22.994
He judges you, and then you are thrown out.

00:20:23.434 --> 00:20:26.154
Then to come back is very difficult.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:30.154
Even if you come back you are suspicious of yourself,

00:20:30.394 --> 00:20:32.634
and others are also suspicious of you.

00:20:32.954 --> 00:20:36.234
So you see, what you have to understand

00:20:36.434 --> 00:20:38.994
is that this is a judgment point.

00:20:39.194 --> 00:20:41.914
Introspect yourself, find out,

00:20:42.154 --> 00:20:46.554
"Am I wise? If I'm doing this, am I doing wise things?

00:20:46.914 --> 00:20:49.314
Is it wise for me to do?

00:20:49.634 --> 00:20:53.274
Is it all right for me as a Sahaja Yogi to do it?

00:20:53.554 --> 00:20:54.954
Should I do it or not?"

00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:57.114
At every point you should see.

00:20:57.314 --> 00:20:59.994
I mean, you know that I don't want any money,

00:21:00.115 --> 00:21:02.672
and I don't want any presents -- I've said hundred times,

00:21:02.793 --> 00:21:03.913
but they won't listen.

00:21:04.034 --> 00:21:04.907
Now they are saying that

00:21:05.028 --> 00:21:07.381
"Mother if you stop giving us present, we'll stop."

00:21:07.502 --> 00:21:10.313
I said, "You stop first, then I'll stop."

00:21:10.434 --> 00:21:12.554
But despite all this quarrel and fight,

00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:14.190
there's one thing definitely:

00:21:14.311 --> 00:21:18.071
there's love, and you want to express it.

00:21:18.274 --> 00:21:22.274
But love here is not attached;

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:28.794
it's detached love, where it flows to its greatest extent,

00:21:29.154 --> 00:21:32.794
takes all the responsibility.

00:21:34.514 --> 00:21:36.634
There is people, there are people

00:21:36.834 --> 00:21:39.154
who go on criticizing other Sahaja Yogis

00:21:39.394 --> 00:21:41.074
-- I have seen it, it's very common.

00:21:41.274 --> 00:21:44.074
That's a sign of a very low type of a Sahaja Yogi,

00:21:44.394 --> 00:21:46.634
because he doesn't see what's wrong with him.

00:21:46.834 --> 00:21:48.794
He's trying to criticize others,

00:21:49.114 --> 00:21:52.554
does he see what is wrong with him?

00:21:52.874 --> 00:21:56.394
There are other kinds of Sahaja Yogis

00:21:56.874 --> 00:22:01.554
who do not realize that they are like ganas.

00:22:01.994 --> 00:22:06.034
They are like ganas, and imagine the ganas, how quick they are.

00:22:06.394 --> 00:22:11.114
The Ganesha is creating those ganas,

00:22:11.314 --> 00:22:14.194
and they are in the sternum bones first,

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:16.674
and then they go all over the body.

00:22:16.914 --> 00:22:20.514
As soon as this Center Heart, the Mother's place,

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:25.474
starts little bit vibrating, they get alerted.

00:22:25.794 --> 00:22:28.234
So we have to be alert.

00:22:28.674 --> 00:22:32.034
It's very important that we have to be alert.

00:22:32.274 --> 00:22:34.114
For about twelve years of your age

00:22:34.314 --> 00:22:38.234
these ganas stay there in the sternum bone,

00:22:38.434 --> 00:22:40.594
and then they go to the whole body,

00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:42.273
because they are matured enough.

00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:44.910
They are kept there till they are completely matured

00:22:45.031 --> 00:22:46.794
to fight the enemies.

00:22:47.034 --> 00:22:51.074
And they know what kind of enemies they have, they know everything:

00:22:51.274 --> 00:22:55.554
what kind of fighting is needed, what kind of opposition is there.

00:22:55.874 --> 00:23:01.314
They will just select and they will appoint themselves,

00:23:01.514 --> 00:23:05.194
who should fight whom, who should do this.

00:23:05.474 --> 00:23:10.554
But they just don't sit all the time in the Mother's house.

00:23:10.794 --> 00:23:15.194
So we have to go to the people.

00:23:15.794 --> 00:23:18.754
We have to go into the Virata's body.

00:23:18.954 --> 00:23:22.874
We have to move out, we have to go all out;

00:23:23.074 --> 00:23:26.554
without having any fear you have to fight them.

00:23:26.675 --> 00:23:28.802
Not to sit at home crying like a baby,

00:23:28.923 --> 00:23:31.274
now you are all grown-up people.

00:23:31.514 --> 00:23:38.394
So this is what is written in the Buddha's future life,

00:23:38.554 --> 00:23:43.554
that He becomes Matreya, means He has three Mothers in Him

00:23:43.754 --> 00:23:44.874
"Ma treya."

00:23:45.074 --> 00:23:48.394
But also that He goes all out in the society,

00:23:48.634 --> 00:23:53.554
He goes out everywhere and He changes people.

00:23:53.994 --> 00:23:58.914
When you asked for Gurupada you don't know, you were in trouble.

00:23:59.514 --> 00:24:02.994
Guru doesn't sit at home.

00:24:03.234 --> 00:24:06.194
He has to go all out, meet all kinds of people,

00:24:06.394 --> 00:24:10.794
tell them about Sahaja Yoga; not to be afraid.

00:24:10.915 --> 00:24:12.659
You have to live in the society,

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.064
you don't have to have exclusive society

00:24:15.185 --> 00:24:18.994
where we enjoy bhajans and things - that's over now.

00:24:19.274 --> 00:24:23.554
I mean, of course we'll always have bhajans, it doesn't mean that.

00:24:23.954 --> 00:24:27.034
But you have to go beyond.

00:24:27.314 --> 00:24:31.194
Not only to be involved only in your own problems

00:24:31.394 --> 00:24:35.794
which are being now solved, so only in Sahaja Yoga,but Sahaja Yogis;

00:24:35.994 --> 00:24:38.114
but you have to go all out,

00:24:38.314 --> 00:24:39.794
meet other people,

00:24:39.994 --> 00:24:41.394
tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:41.554 --> 00:24:44.554
The best is to wear badges so people ask, "Who is this?"

00:24:44.754 --> 00:24:49.034
- then you can talk to them, your friends, your society.

00:24:49.234 --> 00:24:52.194
You don't have to give up anything,

00:24:52.514 --> 00:24:54.634
don't have to give up anything.

00:24:54.874 --> 00:25:00.196
You are detached, you just go and see for yourself, this is wrong.

00:25:00.317 --> 00:25:02.631
Like yesterday they showed all kinds of things,

00:25:02.752 --> 00:25:04.674
also disco dance they showed you.

00:25:04.874 --> 00:25:07.714
You should go to the disco and give them the pamphlets,

00:25:07.914 --> 00:25:11.834
show them, "What are you doing, are you mad?"¨

00:25:14.554 --> 00:25:16.874
Or do this kind of a disco more there

00:25:17.074 --> 00:25:19.034
so they'll say, "What's wrong with them?"

00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:23.034
Then you say, "We are copying you."

00:25:26.834 --> 00:25:28.419
That will put them down.

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.234
You see a lady who is, say, smoking and this and that,

00:25:31.434 --> 00:25:34.112
standing with a pose - go and stand before her with a pose

00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:35.833
and smoking like this.

00:25:35.954 --> 00:25:38.794
She'll stop it.

00:25:39.434 --> 00:25:42.234
So by copying them, one way,

00:25:42.514 --> 00:25:45.554
showing them what they are - another, writing.

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:47.154
You must have writing.

00:25:47.354 --> 00:25:50.714
It's very important to write and answer.

00:25:50.914 --> 00:25:53.474
I must tell that there's a very nice article

00:25:53.674 --> 00:25:55.274
which has come now with Me,

00:25:55.395 --> 00:25:57.787
and the English Sahaja Yogis should take it from Me

00:25:57.908 --> 00:25:59.708
and answer the gentleman.

00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:03.754
It's very important. It's in My room, I'll give them.

00:26:04.874 --> 00:26:07.274
You must know what's happening all around -

00:26:07.514 --> 00:26:10.954
what's happening in Bosnia,

00:26:11.154 --> 00:26:13.554
what's happening in Italy, what's happening here.

00:26:13.754 --> 00:26:15.754
You should read newspapers.

00:26:15.954 --> 00:26:18.554
You can see television also,

00:26:18.874 --> 00:26:21.474
when - and now, when you are matured.

00:26:21.674 --> 00:26:23.314
Otherwise if you see television,

00:26:23.554 --> 00:26:27.274
you'll go mad like other television people are.

00:26:27.474 --> 00:26:31.234
So what's the use of seeing the television?

00:26:32.234 --> 00:26:35.034
But if you see the television with a detached mind,

00:26:35.234 --> 00:26:39.114
you'll immediately get the point where you have to hit.

00:26:39.434 --> 00:26:43.314
Otherwise you are sitting in the house nicely covered up,

00:26:43.514 --> 00:26:48.714
"Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother." That's not so.

00:26:51.914 --> 00:26:55.914
Ganesha gives powers to these ganas and they fight.

00:26:56.234 --> 00:26:58.274
That's why He's called as Ganapati.

00:26:58.474 --> 00:27:00.474
If you want to call Me Ganapati,

00:27:00.674 --> 00:27:03.474
then you have to be like ganas

00:27:03.794 --> 00:27:07.914
who go all out, and work it out.

00:27:08.234 --> 00:27:11.194
In so many ways, there's so many tricks

00:27:11.475 --> 00:27:13.072
which you can play on these people

00:27:13.193 --> 00:27:15.193
and try to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:15.314 --> 00:27:18.194
And with you is this all-pervading Power.

00:27:18.474 --> 00:27:19.754
You should not shun them.

00:27:19.954 --> 00:27:23.154
For example, laws of your countries are so horrible,

00:27:23.474 --> 00:27:26.754
some of the laws are so horrible, the peculiar type.

00:27:26.994 --> 00:27:28.674
You should write.

00:27:28.914 --> 00:27:33.754
There's no equity, there's no sense in so many laws that you have,

00:27:33.954 --> 00:27:35.194
which are money-oriented

00:27:35.394 --> 00:27:39.674
- say, in France they have very, very funny laws.

00:27:40.114 --> 00:27:44.354
And they never maintain the law, they don't believe in it.

00:27:45.074 --> 00:27:50.714
There's no morals, there are no laws. You write to them.

00:27:53.034 --> 00:27:56.194
You must go and see newspaper people, tell them about it.

00:27:56.394 --> 00:27:59.074
Try to now assert yourself.

00:27:59.314 --> 00:28:00.714
Unless and until you do that,

00:28:00.914 --> 00:28:05.634
nobody is going to get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:06.074 --> 00:28:08.714
You might get very great people out of that.

00:28:08.954 --> 00:28:12.194
You can invite some people, you can call them.

00:28:12.514 --> 00:28:15.514
The modus operandi of these gurus I have seen.

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:18.554
They write very nice letters to all these big, big johnnies,

00:28:18.754 --> 00:28:20.714
as soon as they go to some house.

00:28:20.914 --> 00:28:24.514
Then they seek interview, go and see that person, talk to him.

00:28:24.794 --> 00:28:27.954
They carry, you see, a sort of a -

00:28:28.394 --> 00:28:31.914
you can say a kind of a

00:28:35.874 --> 00:28:37.994
negotiations, you can call it,

00:28:38.234 --> 00:28:42.114
or a some sort of a panel will go and see them.

00:28:42.354 --> 00:28:44.634
It's all that level. And then they show them books.

00:28:44.794 --> 00:28:47.074
"See now this is happening, why don't you take to it?

00:28:47.274 --> 00:28:49.114
We don't want money,"  this thing, that thing.

00:28:49.354 --> 00:28:52.774
You might get lots of people. But you have to invite them,

00:28:52.895 --> 00:28:56.193
because unless and until you invite them, they'll not come to you.

00:28:56.314 --> 00:28:59.274
So you have to invite them, and you have to tell them

00:28:59.474 --> 00:29:01.514
that "We want to meet you. This is it."

00:29:01.714 --> 00:29:05.954
Out of at least hundred, if not, at least twenty will reply.

00:29:06.075 --> 00:29:08.083
They would like to meet you. You should say:

00:29:08.204 --> 00:29:09.993
"We found out this, we found out that."

00:29:10.114 --> 00:29:13.754
So now today as Ganesha's ganas

00:29:14.034 --> 00:29:16.154
you have to do this special work,

00:29:16.474 --> 00:29:19.074
is to understand now you are matured enough,

00:29:19.274 --> 00:29:21.474
you have to go in the society.

00:29:21.794 --> 00:29:22.954
Now if you get upset,

00:29:23.075 --> 00:29:25.926
"Mother, I went there and this happened and that happened."

00:29:26.047 --> 00:29:28.154
It doesn't matter.

00:29:28.394 --> 00:29:30.194
You are not going to be crucified,

00:29:30.514 --> 00:29:32.274
you are not going to be murdered.

00:29:32.554 --> 00:29:35.674
And do you know there's all the time My protection on you?

00:29:35.994 --> 00:29:38.314
If you want you can see a photograph we have,

00:29:38.514 --> 00:29:43.074
with, ah, him, you can see that, complete protection.

00:29:43.434 --> 00:29:47.234
It follows you, you have seen light on your heads.

00:29:47.564 --> 00:29:49.808
You are the marked people, who are going -

00:29:49.929 --> 00:29:52.794
you are already sitting in the Kingdom of God.

00:29:52.994 --> 00:29:54.914
Why should you be afraid?

00:29:55.154 --> 00:29:57.714
Why should you not meet people?

00:29:58.074 --> 00:30:00.554
Then also I said, make some music.

00:30:00.754 --> 00:30:02.993
Like yesterday's, I liked the way they were singing.

00:30:03.114 --> 00:30:05.569
At least, you see, whatever they were singing,

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:12.234
may not be pop music sort or something, but it was clear.

00:30:13.354 --> 00:30:17.234
The message should be clear - you can use pop style, doesn't matter -

00:30:17.514 --> 00:30:19.914
but the message should be clear, it should not be

00:30:20.114 --> 00:30:22.874
- I can never understand what they are singing.

00:30:23.234 --> 00:30:25.794
So every word should be clear-cut.

00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:29.634
We can go all out to have real publicity,

00:30:29.874 --> 00:30:33.234
but for that we need people who are really matured enough.

00:30:33.434 --> 00:30:35.474
Otherwise with the slightest provocation

00:30:35.714 --> 00:30:39.634
they get upset, start fighting - finished.

00:30:40.634 --> 00:30:41.914
Also we should not say

00:30:42.114 --> 00:30:44.634
that "You are intellectual, you cannot understand."

00:30:44.834 --> 00:30:47.834
You say "You can, mentally also you can understand,

00:30:48.114 --> 00:30:50.474
we can explain to you." Prepare yourself.

00:30:50.714 --> 00:30:53.954
We can even have some sort of seminars or classes

00:30:54.194 --> 00:30:56.474
where we can discuss about these things.

00:30:56.674 --> 00:30:59.194
In the pujas you can have some sort of a

00:30:59.434 --> 00:31:01.514
- morning time is always free -

00:31:01.794 --> 00:31:05.314
some sort of a seminar or a discussion,

00:31:05.514 --> 00:31:08.354
or they call a brain trust or whatever it is.

00:31:08.475 --> 00:31:10.238
And there you can discuss things,

00:31:10.359 --> 00:31:12.679
how we can proceed, what we can do.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.314
Now the time has come. It's over now,

00:31:15.514 --> 00:31:18.954
all this preparation is over, you are prepared for it.

00:31:19.154 --> 00:31:22.234
Now you have to go all out, tell people.

00:31:22.554 --> 00:31:25.994
You know these people from this Brahmakumari what they tell,

00:31:26.234 --> 00:31:27.994
"Now the doomsday has come.

00:31:28.194 --> 00:31:30.994
You are all going to be doomed" - openly -

00:31:31.354 --> 00:31:35.874
"and so that you give us money, you'll be saved."

00:31:36.714 --> 00:31:40.074
So now you have to say that "This is the last judgment.

00:31:40.314 --> 00:31:43.714
You take your realization, otherwise you'll be doomed."

00:31:43.994 --> 00:31:46.514
Unless and until you take your realization,

00:31:46.754 --> 00:31:51.274
without your ascent you cannot get out of your genetic problems.

00:31:51.834 --> 00:31:54.714
All these genetic problems can be only solved

00:31:54.954 --> 00:31:57.554
if you get your realization.

00:31:57.914 --> 00:32:01.434
So you have to tell others, "Get out of your personal problems."

00:32:01.714 --> 00:32:06.154
"Mother, my wife has no children." It doesn't matter.

00:32:06.394 --> 00:32:08.114
There are so many children in this world,

00:32:08.314 --> 00:32:11.314
you are doing a good work by not having a child.

00:32:11.674 --> 00:32:14.394
And if you want to have a child, you can adopt a child.

00:32:14.634 --> 00:32:19.114
Then, "My child is like this, my child is like that, my child ..."

00:32:19.514 --> 00:32:21.954
So much attachment to children I've never seen.

00:32:22.194 --> 00:32:24.474
Before marriage

00:32:24.754 --> 00:32:28.794
if they have children, I've seen people treat them better.

00:32:28.994 --> 00:32:31.343
But if they are married, they kill their children.

00:32:31.464 --> 00:32:33.113
So many people kill their children,

00:32:33.234 --> 00:32:35.354
abuse their children, do all kinds of things.

00:32:35.554 --> 00:32:37.634
But once they are Sahaja Yogis they,

00:32:37.874 --> 00:32:43.554
from this end to that end, they just get glued to their children.

00:32:44.114 --> 00:32:50.354
So there should be a detached attitude towards everything,

00:32:51.674 --> 00:32:55.474
and no attachments. Then only you'll be free.

00:32:55.874 --> 00:32:59.514
But that doesn't mean that you are not doing your duty,

00:32:59.714 --> 00:33:04.074
your nourishment that is needed.

00:33:04.434 --> 00:33:06.234
You have to give love to everyone,

00:33:06.474 --> 00:33:08.074
you have to care for everyone,

00:33:08.274 --> 00:33:10.754
but you shouldn't get attached.

00:33:11.074 --> 00:33:14.834
I have seen people, they get attached even to Sahaja yogis.

00:33:15.114 --> 00:33:18.554
One Sahaja yogi misbehaved and went out of the Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:18.834 --> 00:33:22.634
ten Sahaja Yogis went away with him.

00:33:22.914 --> 00:33:25.714
They are not attached to Me but to that stupid Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:25.914 --> 00:33:28.434
He went to Nepal, he learnt some avidya,

00:33:28.634 --> 00:33:32.314
he came back, and they went away with him.

00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:36.274
That shows you have not developed your personality.

00:33:36.474 --> 00:33:40.994
How dare anybody influence you and say that get out of Sahaja Yoga!

00:33:41.194 --> 00:33:44.914
If you have a matured personality and responsibility, you will say

00:33:45.114 --> 00:33:49.754
"I have to do Sahaja Yoga work. That's the main thing I have to do."

00:33:50.394 --> 00:33:53.754
You must know that though you look ordinary people,

00:33:54.074 --> 00:33:57.114
but God has chosen you.

00:33:57.394 --> 00:34:04.114
If any one of you do not do Sahaja Yoga work, who will be blamed?

00:34:05.074 --> 00:34:07.874
In every aspect of life one should understand.

00:34:07.995 --> 00:34:10.754
You see, I don't say that you give Me money or anything,

00:34:10.875 --> 00:34:12.269
I don't want anything from you;

00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:14.350
as it is you know how much I am spending.

00:34:14.471 --> 00:34:17.274
But definitely if money is needed somewhere,

00:34:17.514 --> 00:34:21.474
you must go all out to help with money also.

00:34:21.874 --> 00:34:25.394
People will, they spend money in, say, races

00:34:25.714 --> 00:34:29.474
or spend money on some sort of a pub.

00:34:29.794 --> 00:34:31.514
All that money is saved now,

00:34:31.834 --> 00:34:33.954
you don't have to go to a pub, nothing.

00:34:34.274 --> 00:34:38.394
So if money is needed, you have to spend.

00:34:38.794 --> 00:34:41.034
Then another thing is, people just start asking

00:34:41.234 --> 00:34:44.394
why it's so expensive, why this, why that?

00:34:44.714 --> 00:34:49.154
In Sahaja Yoga everybody knows accounts, everybody has accounts,

00:34:49.514 --> 00:34:53.314
there's nothing secret - where money goes, what we are using for.

00:34:53.514 --> 00:34:55.674
How do you have this, say, tent?

00:34:55.874 --> 00:34:58.674
How do you have this land?

00:34:58.914 --> 00:35:02.034
How do you have Daglio?

00:35:05.025 --> 00:35:06.952
Just think, and nobody thinks like that,

00:35:07.073 --> 00:35:10.193
from where Mother gets money to do all this things?

00:35:10.314 --> 00:35:15.394
I don't need such a big castle, do I - for what?

00:35:15.954 --> 00:35:20.994
I've already bought another house in London from My own money. Why?

00:35:21.474 --> 00:35:25.394
It's already you have spent so much money for this Shudy Camp.

00:35:25.674 --> 00:35:28.314
It's giving no money at all.

00:35:28.634 --> 00:35:31.994
Well, I don't need Sahaja Yoga, it is you people who need it.

00:35:32.314 --> 00:35:36.474
And if you start saving money on that also,

00:35:36.794 --> 00:35:39.674
then I don't know what to say to you.

00:35:39.994 --> 00:35:41.154
It doesn't mean like

00:35:41.275 --> 00:35:44.237
in the church they say you must give money and all that,

00:35:44.358 --> 00:35:47.878
but your dedication.

00:35:48.874 --> 00:35:51.074
If you have the dedication

00:35:51.314 --> 00:35:55.274
then you will yourself think, that is my responsibility.

00:35:55.395 --> 00:35:58.116
On the contrary, you'll say, "Oh, you need money? All right."

00:35:58.237 --> 00:36:00.072
Now school has to be built.

00:36:00.193 --> 00:36:02.753
Who has built Vashi?

00:36:02.874 --> 00:36:04.954
Who has built this Ganapatipule?

00:36:05.274 --> 00:36:09.874
Who has built such a big ashram now you'll see in Delhi?

00:36:12.154 --> 00:36:16.914
Who has donated money for Sahaja Yoga so far?

00:36:18.834 --> 00:36:20.514
You all have prospered in life,

00:36:20.714 --> 00:36:23.074
you all have got sufficient money,

00:36:23.274 --> 00:36:27.754
but what are you doing?

00:36:31.634 --> 00:36:35.554
So in this aspect is,

00:36:35.794 --> 00:36:41.314
you have to see that you do your level best for Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:41.714 --> 00:36:44.394
Another side is your creativity.

00:36:44.714 --> 00:36:48.754
There have been very great artists who came out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:48.994 --> 00:36:50.994
If they have to give any present

00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:54.674
they'll give the smallest possible, the cheapest possible.

00:36:54.994 --> 00:36:59.194
The most expensive one they keep with themselves and sell it.

00:36:59.514 --> 00:37:01.394
If they could give even one piece like that

00:37:01.634 --> 00:37:05.394
we can sell it in the market, just for Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:05.834 --> 00:37:09.914
But they'll give something very cheapish which cannot be used;

00:37:10.194 --> 00:37:13.554
it's just adding up to My personal archives.

00:37:14.074 --> 00:37:17.834
But if they give something sensible it can be sold.

00:37:18.194 --> 00:37:21.474
The musicians who go abroad, they can give some,

00:37:22.194 --> 00:37:25.634
their programs and things can make some money.

00:37:25.994 --> 00:37:29.874
And also if it is needed, that money can be used.

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:32.794
Do you know we, I just asked once

00:37:33.034 --> 00:37:36.314
that collect some money for Indian project,

00:37:36.674 --> 00:37:38.674
one year, in Sahasrara.

00:37:38.914 --> 00:37:39.914
You must know that,

00:37:40.114 --> 00:37:43.714
that there were only five thousand pounds collected,

00:37:44.074 --> 00:37:47.474
and I was so ashamed that they are still there as it is,

00:37:47.754 --> 00:37:49.754
in the bank.

00:37:49.994 --> 00:37:52.634
How can you send five thousand to India?

00:37:52.834 --> 00:37:55.874
What will they think of you?

00:37:59.114 --> 00:38:04.554
Even the school for you, it is for your children,

00:38:06.794 --> 00:38:08.274
not for Indian children.

00:38:08.514 --> 00:38:13.034
But still it will be built by Indians, I know that -- or by Me.

00:38:14.154 --> 00:38:16.194
Thus we should realize

00:38:16.474 --> 00:38:18.754
that if we are wasting some money somewhere,

00:38:19.034 --> 00:38:21.714
we can utilize some money for Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:21.954 --> 00:38:25.754
We should have some money for our organization.

00:38:26.114 --> 00:38:29.514
Otherwise this is how, whatever we save on food or anything,

00:38:29.714 --> 00:38:31.434
that's very little amount;

00:38:31.674 --> 00:38:34.954
but still we are managing.

00:38:36.554 --> 00:38:41.674
Every guru takes money outside first and then come to the puja

00:38:42.314 --> 00:38:47.474
- outside, and that too, real, sumptuous one.

00:38:47.899 --> 00:38:49.246
I don't need any money.

00:38:49.367 --> 00:38:53.314
Even your puja money, everything, you know it goes into silver,

00:38:53.634 --> 00:38:56.994
because you cannot have puja with plastics.

00:38:57.314 --> 00:39:03.274
So to understand this you have to have auspiciousness, holiness.

00:39:03.754 --> 00:39:06.394
Now, you call Me "Holy Mother,"

00:39:06.754 --> 00:39:09.554
but are you respectful like that?

00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:14.634
Do you know what I am? Ganesha knew.

00:39:14.954 --> 00:39:18.434
Once, His Father said that

00:39:18.634 --> 00:39:21.634
"Whosoever goes round the Mother Earth first,

00:39:21.914 --> 00:39:25.154
I'll give that person a present."

00:39:25.634 --> 00:39:28.354
So another brother, Kartikeya,

00:39:28.674 --> 00:39:33.714
He had a nice vahana, a nice vehicle -

00:39:34.034 --> 00:39:36.354
was a peacock,

00:39:36.634 --> 00:39:42.834
while Ganesha had just a little rat, a mouse,

00:39:43.354 --> 00:39:45.794
and He could never have competed with Him.

00:39:46.114 --> 00:39:48.074
So He said, "Who is greater than My Mother?

00:39:48.314 --> 00:39:49.834
She is the greatest of all.

00:39:50.154 --> 00:39:52.914
What is this Mother Earth or anyone?

00:39:53.035 --> 00:39:55.302
She can create so many Mother Earths like that."

00:39:55.423 --> 00:39:58.114
So He just went round Her and He got the prize,

00:39:58.314 --> 00:40:02.474
and this Kartikeya was still flying.

00:40:04.914 --> 00:40:10.034
So that is what it is, to understand the auspiciousness.

00:40:11.394 --> 00:40:14.714
I mean, though I must say I'm a Mahamaya, no doubt, it's not easy.

00:40:14.914 --> 00:40:18.714
You will never know Me fully, never -- that should not be;

00:40:18.994 --> 00:40:22.914
because then you won't sit here, you'll all run away.

00:40:23.114 --> 00:40:25.274
But despite that, try to understand.

00:40:25.514 --> 00:40:29.354
As Ganesha has understood His Mother, you have to understand.

00:40:29.714 --> 00:40:34.074
That extent is rather difficult, but still try:

00:40:34.634 --> 00:40:37.554
that this is the Power sitting before you.

00:40:37.874 --> 00:40:41.354
How we behave, how we talk, how we take decisions,

00:40:41.634 --> 00:40:44.874
what we do, is all wrong.

00:40:45.634 --> 00:40:49.074
If this doesn't penetrate into your brains

00:40:49.434 --> 00:40:52.194
that means kundalini has not come there.

00:40:52.474 --> 00:40:57.034
People could not raise even one kundalini, one person's kundalini.

00:40:57.434 --> 00:41:00.474
Even this artist who came, she said, "How can it be possible?

00:41:00.834 --> 00:41:03.834
I'm not so - I've done nothing.

00:41:04.114 --> 00:41:08.194
I'm not a person who is a saint. How can I get realization?"

00:41:08.394 --> 00:41:12.354
She was telling Me like this, "How can it be, Mother?"

00:41:13.234 --> 00:41:15.634
But you all got it, no doubt you have,

00:41:15.914 --> 00:41:18.114
none of you have doubts about it.

00:41:18.314 --> 00:41:21.034
And not only that it's happening through Me,

00:41:21.234 --> 00:41:22.754
but you also can do it now.

00:41:22.954 --> 00:41:27.474
Who can do this kind of a thing, in the history of spirituality?

00:41:27.874 --> 00:41:34.354
But I keep a kind of a image of Myself,

00:41:34.554 --> 00:41:37.194
I joke, I make fun,

00:41:38.154 --> 00:41:42.914
I do everything just like a normal mother.

00:41:43.274 --> 00:41:46.754
But that should not give you liberties -- that should not.

00:41:46.954 --> 00:41:49.194
Some people have written very rude letters to Me.

00:41:49.394 --> 00:41:51.474
I must tell you: be careful,

00:41:51.754 --> 00:41:54.667
you can't write rude letters to Me.

00:41:54.788 --> 00:41:56.913
Better not. When you suffer then you'll say,

00:41:57.034 --> 00:41:59.033
"Mother, this has happened, that has happened."

00:41:59.154 --> 00:42:01.873
You have no business to write rude letters to Me.

00:42:01.994 --> 00:42:05.954
And though I read them and I forgive, no doubt,

00:42:06.154 --> 00:42:09.794
because you are ignorant. But you must have knowledge,

00:42:10.074 --> 00:42:11.394
you must understand this,

00:42:11.554 --> 00:42:14.994
that Whom are you writing and what you are writing.

00:42:16.194 --> 00:42:18.874
This side is, of course,

00:42:19.114 --> 00:42:24.914
we have to see that Shri Ganesha has also a parasha in his hand.

00:42:25.634 --> 00:42:32.674
He is one of the most strict deity, very strict.

00:42:34.154 --> 00:42:36.954
Others may little bit hesitate,

00:42:37.194 --> 00:42:40.234
but He cannot tolerate. That's why Christ has said that

00:42:40.434 --> 00:42:42.114
"I will tolerate anything against Me,

00:42:42.314 --> 00:42:46.954
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

00:42:48.114 --> 00:42:54.394
Clearly He has warned - clearly,

00:42:56.154 --> 00:42:59.634
because He has a parasha in His hand

00:43:00.194 --> 00:43:04.234
and people get punished, no doubt.

00:43:05.794 --> 00:43:09.394
So this is another thing one has to understand,

00:43:09.674 --> 00:43:12.994
that Shri Ganesha has this parasha.

00:43:13.274 --> 00:43:16.874
And you too all have this parasha in your hand,

00:43:17.114 --> 00:43:20.234
which you don't know.

00:43:21.554 --> 00:43:26.034
Anybody who will try to trouble you will be in trouble.

00:43:28.394 --> 00:43:31.954
But what is missing is the faith.

00:43:32.194 --> 00:43:35.514
not blind but enlightened faith.

00:43:35.834 --> 00:43:39.474
If you have enlightened faith, then it works.

00:43:39.914 --> 00:43:43.194
There's one gentleman working in London airport,

00:43:43.394 --> 00:43:45.474
he's an Indian

00:43:45.674 --> 00:43:49.754
but I think he was looked after by some Western foreigner people

00:43:50.034 --> 00:43:51.474
- very good man.

00:43:51.714 --> 00:43:56.074
So he cannot come to program, he is very busy and all that, he cannot.

00:43:56.994 --> 00:44:00.674
But if I am in the airport he knows I am there.

00:44:00.954 --> 00:44:04.114
Some people tried to trouble him.

00:44:05.194 --> 00:44:09.754
So he said that "Don't trouble me.

00:44:09.954 --> 00:44:12.994
My Mother is very strong, you know; don't trouble me."

00:44:13.234 --> 00:44:16.034
They wouldn't listen, three of them.

00:44:16.274 --> 00:44:19.874
And the three of them next day lost their jobs.

00:44:19.995 --> 00:44:22.232
He said, "Why?" They said, "We don't know.

00:44:22.353 --> 00:44:24.794
The boss told us, 'You get out of the jobs.'

00:44:24.994 --> 00:44:27.794
We don't know how we lost our jobs."

00:44:28.274 --> 00:44:32.074
And still today they haven't got jobs.

00:44:35.994 --> 00:44:37.674
He said, "I had told you."

00:44:37.795 --> 00:44:40.552
They said, "Who is your Mother? Let us meet Her also.

00:44:40.673 --> 00:44:43.833
You see, this is what has happened to us, sorry we did this to you..."

00:44:43.954 --> 00:44:47.274
But nothing works out now.

00:44:48.634 --> 00:44:52.714
So you must have full faith in Sahaja Yoga,

00:44:53.034 --> 00:44:56.354
in Me, and in yourself.

00:44:56.475 --> 00:44:58.647
Those who do not have faith in themselves,

00:44:58.768 --> 00:45:01.554
how can they have faith in others?

00:45:03.354 --> 00:45:06.834
This is another one thing you must understand,

00:45:07.114 --> 00:45:10.674
that you have tremendous powers,

00:45:11.114 --> 00:45:14.194
tremendous powers if you have faith.

00:45:14.554 --> 00:45:16.674
You'll just pray,

00:45:16.795 --> 00:45:18.945
"Mother, I want this gentleman to be cured,

00:45:19.066 --> 00:45:20.464
or this lady to be cured."

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:22.874
It will be cured, you don't have to even touch that person --

00:45:23.114 --> 00:45:25.274
but your faith.

00:45:25.474 --> 00:45:28.114
Like yesterday they brought one lady.

00:45:28.354 --> 00:45:30.474
I was very busy, I was talking, doing this,

00:45:30.674 --> 00:45:33.314
and these are only two,three days when I have to really

00:45:33.514 --> 00:45:38.514
work very hard  with all the problems, and I couldn't see her.

00:45:38.754 --> 00:45:41.474
I said, "Why don't you go and cure? You can cure."

00:45:41.674 --> 00:45:44.154
Why should any Sahaja Yogi suffer from anything

00:45:44.354 --> 00:45:47.674
when there are other Sahaja Yogis?

00:45:47.994 --> 00:45:49.514
Why should I cure anymore?

00:45:49.714 --> 00:45:53.434
You all just put your hands and see if you can cure or not.

00:45:53.874 --> 00:45:56.994
Even your prayers are so powerful, you have no idea.

00:45:57.274 --> 00:45:58.794
Just pray.

00:45:59.074 --> 00:46:02.434
You have got the parasha in your hand, and nobody can harm you.

00:46:02.794 --> 00:46:06.834
And you have got the hand that can bless others.

00:46:07.434 --> 00:46:09.394
You have got that.

00:46:09.674 --> 00:46:14.354
You start your generosity and see, the Lakshmi will flow.

00:46:14.754 --> 00:46:16.634
But if you are not generous,

00:46:16.834 --> 00:46:19.834
calculating each and every pai - finished.

00:46:20.154 --> 00:46:22.154
Why should you?

00:46:22.474 --> 00:46:25.274
The Lakshmi will serve you.

00:46:25.634 --> 00:46:28.794
Know your powers, as Shri Ganesha knew it very well.

00:46:29.034 --> 00:46:30.794
He never bothered.

00:46:30.994 --> 00:46:34.314
Even with an elephant head He managed so many things.

00:46:34.634 --> 00:46:38.194
With human heads you should manage much better -

00:46:38.874 --> 00:46:42.634
or do you need elephant heads?

00:46:46.074 --> 00:46:47.634
Then another thing He has,

00:46:47.874 --> 00:46:51.194
that He's a satisfied person, extremely satisfied.

00:46:51.514 --> 00:46:54.514
And what He eats is a modoka, they have given Me just now here,

00:46:54.754 --> 00:46:57.634
is the modoka He eats.

00:46:58.394 --> 00:47:04.834
So that means that He eats something which is substantial,

00:47:05.234 --> 00:47:07.354
which has got all these dry fruits

00:47:07.554 --> 00:47:10.114
and everything in it, that's what He eats.

00:47:10.474 --> 00:47:16.474
And that is one capacity He has,

00:47:16.954 --> 00:47:18.634
to eat;

00:47:18.914 --> 00:47:21.354
because you can please Him by giving Him things.

00:47:21.554 --> 00:47:23.554
But Mine is just the other way round:

00:47:23.794 --> 00:47:26.274
I can't eat much, and you want to give Me.

00:47:26.554 --> 00:47:30.314
I don't know, He has taken all My capacity to eat, I think.

00:47:30.634 --> 00:47:32.554
But He can eat well.

00:47:32.834 --> 00:47:35.034
And whatever you eat,

00:47:35.274 --> 00:47:40.154
if you think of Him, "Shri Ganesha, I offer you this food also,"

00:47:40.554 --> 00:47:45.034
you'll never find dearth of food at all, never.

00:47:47.314 --> 00:47:52.834
Anything you want - like the other day it was very hot.

00:47:53.234 --> 00:47:56.074
They said, "Mother, let's cool it down."

00:47:56.274 --> 00:47:57.634
I said, "All right."

00:47:57.834 --> 00:47:59.394
As soon as we cooled it down,

00:47:59.634 --> 00:48:02.474
left to the right, Shri Ganesha comes in.

00:48:02.794 --> 00:48:04.754
So He came with full force,

00:48:04.954 --> 00:48:06.114
He cooled it down

00:48:06.314 --> 00:48:09.114
and rained, and rained and rained, brought water also

00:48:09.314 --> 00:48:11.514
because there was no water in these streams.

00:48:11.754 --> 00:48:16.074
You had to do your footsoaking, so water came also.

00:48:17.194 --> 00:48:21.434
And what a testing it - in one thing, how much happened.

00:48:21.994 --> 00:48:24.834
He tested you, He saw you, nothing happened.

00:48:25.074 --> 00:48:27.914
Even a little tent was not blown off.

00:48:28.274 --> 00:48:31.634
It was all fun.

00:48:34.394 --> 00:48:36.514
This is what is,

00:48:36.874 --> 00:48:40.474
that you are also a testing ground for others.

00:48:40.914 --> 00:48:43.074
Immediately you will know what sort of a man is.

00:48:43.274 --> 00:48:46.554
You are so powerful.

00:48:47.314 --> 00:48:50.914
Use your powers, use your powers.

00:48:51.114 --> 00:48:54.674
But what happens if your attention is on other things,

00:48:54.954 --> 00:48:57.914
it's not pure. Attention is on other

00:48:58.114 --> 00:49:03.394
- keep attention on Shri Ganesh,

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:06.554
keep attention on Me.

00:49:06.994 --> 00:49:09.434
Everything will work out. Why should you work when

00:49:09.634 --> 00:49:12.274
He is there to work out everything for you,

00:49:12.514 --> 00:49:16.114
His ganas are there to work out for you?

00:49:16.514 --> 00:49:20.474
So put your attention in such a way

00:49:20.714 --> 00:49:27.834
that you know you are alert, daksha, you are alert,

00:49:28.074 --> 00:49:31.634
you know where is your attention going.

00:49:32.234 --> 00:49:36.394
And then you see the attention how it works.

00:49:37.154 --> 00:49:42.634
I never expected that I'll mature you so fast, but you have matured.

00:49:44.474 --> 00:49:48.634
But unless and until you know yourself fully what you have got,

00:49:48.914 --> 00:49:52.074
how am I to give you certificate?

00:49:52.274 --> 00:49:55.187
Even if I give certificate you won't believe.

00:49:55.308 --> 00:49:57.183
Like they say you have graduated.

00:49:57.304 --> 00:50:01.424
Now you are not only graduated, but you are masters.

00:50:01.634 --> 00:50:05.754
Otherwise I would never have told you to ask for Gurupada.

00:50:07.234 --> 00:50:09.154
You are praveenas now.

00:50:09.394 --> 00:50:11.394
"Praveen" means a master.

00:50:11.794 --> 00:50:13.554
Use your mastery.

00:50:13.874 --> 00:50:16.634
But still you are sitting at home, this, that,

00:50:16.834 --> 00:50:20.074
"My father is sick." Go and treat him

00:50:20.354 --> 00:50:23.554
- you are a master.

00:50:24.154 --> 00:50:28.114
Like Shri Ganesha, such a little thing like that

00:50:28.474 --> 00:50:32.074
is the master, you are also masters.

00:50:32.634 --> 00:50:36.314
The ladies also should know they are also masters.

00:50:36.834 --> 00:50:39.194
Instead of getting involved into smaller things

00:50:39.394 --> 00:50:43.474
and brickbats and all that, rise!

00:50:49.034 --> 00:50:52.874
The another great quality of Him is that

00:50:53.154 --> 00:50:58.554
He uses His teeth to write.

00:50:58.754 --> 00:51:03.234
Teeth come to you from Shri Krishna --

00:51:04.554 --> 00:51:08.394
wisdom of Shri Krishna which becomes the Virat, the brain.

00:51:08.794 --> 00:51:11.994
So He uses the teeth to write.

00:51:12.314 --> 00:51:15.714
He wrote Mahabharata with His teeth.

00:51:16.154 --> 00:51:20.394
So it is said that you must use

00:51:21.514 --> 00:51:25.314
your brain

00:51:26.554 --> 00:51:29.754
with the enlightenment of Shri Krishna

00:51:30.074 --> 00:51:33.274
and write, write, and write,

00:51:33.674 --> 00:51:38.514
and produce it into books.

00:51:38.834 --> 00:51:43.834
All these gurus have been successful because they created books.

00:51:44.554 --> 00:51:47.834
And these books were read by people

00:51:48.034 --> 00:51:50.114
and they were so much impressed,

00:51:50.314 --> 00:51:54.194
because anything black and white becomes something great.

00:51:54.514 --> 00:51:57.234
You can also make nice dramas as you have made.

00:51:57.474 --> 00:52:00.154
You can approach the televisions

00:52:00.354 --> 00:52:02.754
and things, that "We have a nice drama for children."

00:52:02.954 --> 00:52:06.554
Now think about going in to people,

00:52:06.954 --> 00:52:09.234
live in the society, live with them,

00:52:09.554 --> 00:52:13.034
deliver to them what you have got it. It's your duty.

00:52:13.434 --> 00:52:16.474
It's not only that but it is also,

00:52:16.754 --> 00:52:20.434
it's a special privilege to you.

00:52:20.714 --> 00:52:24.914
I mean, for today as it is we had to delay,

00:52:25.154 --> 00:52:29.354
and I've tried to give you

00:52:29.634 --> 00:52:31.874
some points about Shri Ganesh.

00:52:32.154 --> 00:52:35.274
I think even if you give Me hundred lectures I cannot finish it,

00:52:35.474 --> 00:52:38.674
it's so great, it's like an ocean to Me.

00:52:39.154 --> 00:52:42.634
So I hope you will understand the essential,

00:52:43.314 --> 00:52:46.434
the fundamental principles of Shri Ganesha,

00:52:46.674 --> 00:52:51.514
and what is innocence is. The first is wisdom.

00:52:55.454 --> 00:52:59.654
May God bless you all.
