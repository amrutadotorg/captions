Sahajayoga and essential medicine

00:00:08.366 --> 00:00:13.994
Shri Mataji Nirmaladevi- grandmother,
scholar and freedom fighter.

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:20.770
As a child she lived in Gandhiji’s ashram,
as a student she studied medicine

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.259
and as cry for freedom swept India
she fought for her nation’s independence.

00:00:26.557 --> 00:00:31.455
The year 1970 was about her most important role.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:39.611
The discovery of development of sahajayoga,
a movement which is now spreading in worldwide.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:44.390
Sahajayoga is a science of
integration which results

00:00:44.485 --> 00:00:48.391
in man’s mental, physical
and spiritual wellbeing.

00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:52.393
The union of mind heart and spirit
is a achieve through the working

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:56.619
of a subtle energy system
within each one of us.

00:00:56.803 --> 00:01:13.596
“That you are not this body, this mind, these
conditionings, this ego but we are the spirit.

00:01:14.059 --> 00:01:25.147
You don’t have to accept what I am saying blindly because
blind faith leads to fanaticism.

00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:31.151
But as scientist you must keep
your mind open and see for

00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:39.819
yourself what I am saying if it is
so honestly you must accept it.”

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.910
In today’s society this subtle energy system which
has its origins in very

00:01:44.973 --> 00:01:47.999
roots of our being has been neglected.

00:01:48.044 --> 00:01:50.039
It is out of balance.

00:01:50.163 --> 00:01:55.785
Today’s physical and psychological diseases
are gross expressions of a subtle system in

00:01:55.822 --> 00:01:59.408
dire need of repair and nourishment.

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:03.063
Our collective desire of a peace and rejuvenation

00:02:03.092 --> 00:02:06.310
is a yearning coming from deep within.

00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:09.970
It is a reflection of our internal condition.

00:02:10.123 --> 00:02:26.352
“We know so much though science about
our civilization our advancement .

00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:36.329
This is a advancement of a tree which has
grown outside very much but if we do not

00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:42.656
know our roots we will be destroyed.

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:48.954
So it is important to know about our roots.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:56.245
"Within each individual the subtle energy
system or subtle body is divided into 3 channels

00:02:56.568 --> 00:03:00.297
right, left and centre.

00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:03.682
The right side channel corresponds
to right sympathetic chain

00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:08.982
of the autonomic nervous system and
left hemisphere of the brain.

00:03:09.077 --> 00:03:12.541
While the left side connects to
the right hemisphere of the brain

00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:15.968
and corresponds to the left sympathetic chain.

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:20.538
If a person suffers a stroke in
the right lobe of the brain

00:03:20.612 --> 00:03:25.731
it is commonly known that the left
side of the body becomes effective.

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:29.451
In line with the opinion of
the psychologist sahajayoga

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:32.469
identifies the right hemisphere of the brain has

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:35.318
been responsible for the
functions of the lateral,

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.575
artistic, expressive thinking. Those
functions traditionally believed

00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:45.547
to be more predominant in a females.
The left hemisphere corresponds

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:50.457
to functions of the linear,
computational and mathematical logic

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:56.426
traditionally considered to be
predominant brain activity in males.

00:03:56.539 --> 00:04:02.137
Dr. Carl Gustakh Jung well known analytical psychologist

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.588
identifies the left and right side as the anama and anami

00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:12.374
with the collective unconscious lying in the central channel.

00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:16.924
Through he studies he observe that in the every women

00:04:16.968 --> 00:04:22.777
there is a masculine aspect within her
psyche the architect of the animus and

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.753
for every men the feminine counterpart the anima.

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:33.876
Jung was always aware of the imbalance in
western culture in favour of the masculine

00:04:33.912 --> 00:04:39.130
seen in a preference for logic,
analysis and external achievement.

00:04:39.198 --> 00:04:42.597
These are all claims for mascular side or right

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.887
side of the psyche
within all human beings.

00:04:46.224 --> 00:04:54.883
A right side channel also provides the energy
needed for plan, act, analyze and predict.

00:04:54.955 --> 00:05:00.823
On the physical level it
corresponds to liver and pancreas.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:10.387
“This power of action moves on the
right side of the spinal cord

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:14.180
and coming to the optic
chiasma it crosses over;

00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:24.294
passes to the left side and creates
an institution called ego.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.122
The institution of ego is a myth.

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:39.990
What we do is to get something dead like
some trees dead so make some platform

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:46.291
or some furniture, we take
some stones and make a hall

00:05:46.355 --> 00:05:49.525
and we think we have done a great job.

00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:54.750
Actually what we have done is to reconstructed the dead.

00:05:54.847 --> 00:05:58.679
But while doing it we get the feeling

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:00.663
that we have done it something.

00:06:00.663 --> 00:06:04.629
That is how our ego develops.

00:06:06.795 --> 00:06:15.848
This channel on the right hand side caters
to your future.

00:06:15.848 --> 00:06:27.246
So those people who plan too much think too much
exhaust the energy of this centre

00:06:27.246 --> 00:06:33.772
because this centre has
the first responsibility

00:06:33.772 --> 00:06:39.283
to convert the fat cells in the
stomach for the use of the brain

00:06:39.413 --> 00:06:45.973
which is overused to make them into gray cells.

00:06:45.992 --> 00:06:58.179
So when you start thinking too much it has to
work more for this very important function.

00:06:58.232 --> 00:07:05.212
When it starts working for one function the other functions are neglected

00:07:05.288 --> 00:07:10.766
and the other functions are it has to cater,

00:07:10.835 --> 00:07:18.407
to nourish or to give energy to your liver, to your pancreas, to your spleen,

00:07:18.474 --> 00:07:23.260
to your kidneys and part of your intestine.”

00:07:23.315 --> 00:07:27.282
Western medicine has followed the path of right side

00:07:27.345 --> 00:07:29.980
pulling a part dissecting or analyzing

00:07:30.036 --> 00:07:34.074
with little regard for the whole working mechanism of the human being.

00:07:34.148 --> 00:07:40.291
“Of course when you neglect your liver you know liver as they say you

00:07:40.346 --> 00:07:42.854
will live till your liver will allow.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:49.761
Now this liver has to clean all the

00:07:49.816 --> 00:07:57.875
poison from your body. It comes out as
heat and is delivered to the blood stream.
。

00:07:57.923 --> 00:08:02.748
But when this is neglected
this poor liver doesn’t know

00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:10.242
how to function without the energy and all
the heat is accumulated in the liver.

00:08:10.318 --> 00:08:14.651
So a person suffers
from liver trouble

00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:17.840
and symptoms are he gets migraine,

00:08:17.905 --> 00:08:24.351
he cannot see the sun then also
he gets very hot tempered,

00:08:24.377 --> 00:08:29.830
irritable, angry because
there is so much of heat.

00:08:29.867 --> 00:08:37.083
Then this heat passes; I was telling
in Canberra most of the Bureaucrats

00:08:37.123 --> 00:08:39.472
have this problem

00:08:39.472 --> 00:08:44.337
because they plan too much and where do we land with

00:08:44.337 --> 00:08:46.948
that planning oh God all knows.

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:54.950
So then this heat passes
upward and downward

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:04.407
so when it passes downward it gives you a
very bad problem of terrible constipation

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:11.055
because the heat constitutes
your intestine large intestines.

00:09:11.099 --> 00:09:15.725
It also coagulates your kidneys
by which you have kidney trouble

00:09:15.758 --> 00:09:18.003
you cannot pass your urine.

00:09:18.036 --> 00:09:25.114
Then you go on the dialysis and
you are certified as really dead.

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.256
Because you cannot last longer.

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:33.004
So very expensive treatment but
doctors do not tell you frankly

00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:34.814
that oh, you are not going to live.

00:09:34.814 --> 00:09:40.862
Then this heat can pass upward
and when it goes upward

00:09:40.888 --> 00:09:46.166
it goes say to your right
heart as shown there.

00:09:46.218 --> 00:09:50.094
As a result of that you develop asthma.

00:09:50.154 --> 00:09:54.487
Of course asthma is connected  also with the left side.

00:09:54.543 --> 00:09:58.590
So when this triggering is
done by the left side

00:09:58.646 --> 00:10:02.541
then you get this horrible disease called asthma.

00:10:02.571 --> 00:10:09.230
Then this heat can go upward and can ruin your throat.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:13.610
It can freeze your right arm.

00:10:13.658 --> 00:10:22.148
It can make your left eye red
and also your left ear deaf.

00:10:22.206 --> 00:10:30.960
But by chance if such a person is
young and using too much physical

00:10:31.008 --> 00:10:37.259
energy and mental energy as well as
drinking a lot he can have a very

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:42.299
fatal heart attack very massive one
and he may die in very early in age.

00:10:42.407 --> 00:10:45.493
You must know that all such attacks in

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.999
young age always are fatal.

00:10:48.042 --> 00:10:56.289
But when you see to the
other side is that there

00:10:56.325 --> 00:11:00.270
is a pancreas which is neglected

00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:03.967
as a result of the
neglect of the pancreas

00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:06.958
you develop a disease called diabetes.

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:12.520
Even the mothers who are extremely
planning type and thinking

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.281
type give that disease
to their children

00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:18.299
and children are
born with diabetes.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:24.443
Then you have the third problem with the spleen.

00:11:24.497 --> 00:11:27.602
This is the most dangerous one.

00:11:27.683 --> 00:11:31.992
Now a days as the life is
we are all time bound

00:11:32.056 --> 00:11:35.054
very particular about time.

00:11:35.134 --> 00:11:39.309
As a result of that we have
become extremely hectic.

00:11:39.522 --> 00:11:42.538
Supposing if you sleep very late in a night

00:11:42.578 --> 00:11:45.163
then you have to get up early in the morning somehow.

00:11:45.217 --> 00:11:50.251
Somehow get into your clothes
and run to the office.

00:11:50.312 --> 00:11:55.059
Don’t even take your breakfast; your
wife will give you so on the way in

00:11:55.075 --> 00:12:00.926
the car you are eating your breakfast
and then you read the newspaper.

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:05.111
You get a shock of your life because
so many horrible things are happening.

00:12:05.244 --> 00:12:09.802
Newspaper will never give something
that is good or is doing well.

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:14.549
But something that is gone wrong to
give a sensational feeling.

00:12:14.585 --> 00:12:19.476
It’s just a sometimes horrible
thing so early in the morning

00:12:19.516 --> 00:12:23.357
if you read something that is horrible being
a human being then you sometimes shocked.

00:12:23.412 --> 00:12:28.470
Then you find there is a
jam on the way and you

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:31.557
get so upset and all
your peace is disturbed.

00:12:31.606 --> 00:12:38.079
Now this spleen is responsible for
creating red blood corpuscles

00:12:38.138 --> 00:12:42.112
when you are in emergency.
You must have seen when you eat

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:44.725
your food and you run you get a pain here.

00:12:44.755 --> 00:12:49.679
That’s because your spleen is
trying to pump out new RBC’s.

00:12:49.715 --> 00:12:58.952
Now to create that poor this spleen has
to work very hard but it cannot

00:12:59.007 --> 00:13:01.728
understand the crazy hectic personality.

00:13:01.776 --> 00:13:05.206
Every time it tries to cope with it.It goes crazy.

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:09.831
So such a spleen becomes crazy and ultimately leads

00:13:09.871 --> 00:13:11.420
some triggering on the left hand side;
最终这种情况触发了左边的问题；

00:13:11.435 --> 00:13:18.068
you develop a horrible disease called as leukemia or blood cancer.

00:13:18.102 --> 00:13:24.704
also your intestinal problems, the pain
in stomach and all that indigestion

00:13:24.776 --> 00:13:28.638
all go hand in hand
only because of the

00:13:28.685 --> 00:13:35.570
one centre only on right hand side. I have
not even described the left side centre.

00:13:35.594 --> 00:13:41.702
So if I describe all this the whole
Materia Medica will be described.

00:13:41.753 --> 00:13:46.965
It’s like that. So all the permutations
and combinations of these centres

00:13:47.015 --> 00:13:55.943
give you physical problem then the left
side gives you the mental problem.”

00:13:56.046 --> 00:14:00.869
Jung called the left side the
collective subconscious.

00:14:00.904 --> 00:14:04.496
This side of our psyche
is very complex and

00:14:04.515 --> 00:14:09.121
affects it can have on our physical
wellbeing are devastating.

00:14:09.158 --> 00:14:19.932
“Because as it has been hypothesized in
Sahajayoga that there are 7 main plexuses

00:14:19.979 --> 00:14:27.320
and their functioning is dependent upon
the individuals psycho social behavior.

00:14:27.384 --> 00:14:35.091
This is advancement in the understanding of
psychosomatic medicine and human physiology.

00:14:35.119 --> 00:14:43.215
For the first time it is possible to find the links between the behavior and the disease.

00:14:43.254 --> 00:14:48.468
Because up till
now it was only thought that stress

00:14:48.577 --> 00:14:54.597
can cause a variety of diseases
from diabetes, hypertension, asthma,

00:14:54.653 --> 00:15:00.883
rheumatoid arthritis, etc. etc. cancer even.
But it was not known

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:04.660
why a particular individual will get a particular
disease.”

00:15:04.725 --> 00:15:08.947
“ if you read disease in
medical literature you find

00:15:09.003 --> 00:15:11.990
you could say that it
is psychological stress

00:15:12.035 --> 00:15:16.179
which is responsible for increasing
incidence of hypertension

00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:21.163
in most of the western countries, developing
countries as well as the developed countries

00:15:21.208 --> 00:15:25.247
and we found by our first thesis you
see on which work was done that

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:29.793
this could be a very important if
a person practices sahajayoga

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:32.627
this stress factor can be managed very nicely.

00:15:32.707 --> 00:15:37.036
Because all the parameters you see
for testing whether a person is in a

00:15:37.096 --> 00:15:40.132
state of stress,
tension or anxiety are

00:15:40.183 --> 00:15:43.214
in his relaxed
strain who are done

00:15:43.235 --> 00:15:46.473
and that we found that a
person who do sahajayoga

00:15:46.545 --> 00:15:51.791
only for 20 minutes a day
you see in about 3-4 months time that

00:15:51.847 --> 00:15:53.331
there were changes in the blood,

00:15:53.363 --> 00:15:54.640
there were changes in heart,

00:15:54.712 --> 00:15:57.201
there were changes in the lactrine cyclograph,

00:15:57.236 --> 00:16:00.236
there were changes in
the muscle activity

00:16:00.251 --> 00:16:02.456
and the changes
in the neurotransmitter.”

00:16:02.474 --> 00:16:05.003
In the essential  hypertension group we have taken

00:16:05.053 --> 00:16:09.813
25 female patients of
a similar age group

00:16:09.863 --> 00:16:13.099
and socioeconomic status

00:16:13.118 --> 00:16:18.737
and out of these 15 patients
voluntarily consented

00:16:18.798 --> 00:16:23.486
to practice sahajayoga while 10
patients acted as controls

00:16:23.575 --> 00:16:30.819
and these patients initially both the groups
were on drugs also.

00:16:30.897 --> 00:16:40.523
The initial blood pressure in the sahajayoga group
was 169/109 mm of mercury

00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:49.136
and in the control group it
was 166/111 mm of mercury

00:16:49.178 --> 00:16:54.793
and as the study
progressed for four months

00:16:54.829 --> 00:17:00.646
we observed that many of the
patients gradually could be taken

00:17:00.716 --> 00:17:07.345
of the antihypertense of medication
and at the end of 4 months all the

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:10.830
patients in the sahajayoga group could be taken

00:17:10.885 --> 00:17:15.204
of the antihypertense of
medication and the blood pressure

00:17:15.282 --> 00:17:20.768
had reached the level of
135/83 mm of mercury.

00:17:20.843 --> 00:17:28.459
While the control group blood pressure remained
at 167/111 mm of mercury

00:17:28.526 --> 00:17:33.866
and this shows that it is possible to treat this condition

00:17:33.947 --> 00:17:40.164
essential hypertension by practice of
sahajayoga and without taking medicines.”

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:46.182
“ In my hospital I began to hold

00:17:46.217 --> 00:17:48.938
use sahajayoga treatment on children and

00:17:49.052 --> 00:18:00.066
it so nice to see how it’s possible
to resolve many questions, many problems

00:18:00.149 --> 00:18:09.078
corresponds child 7 yrs and
he had big liver 1 cms

00:18:09.207 --> 00:18:17.558
and lot of problems with joints and doctors
could not make correctly diagnose.

00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:23.289
But when
I feel what chakras were affected.

00:18:23.345 --> 00:18:28.833
It was most swadhishthan, nabhi and agya

00:18:28.861 --> 00:18:36.998
and after first my cleaning liver decreased 4 cm

00:18:37.075 --> 00:18:43.682
and everyday more one cm and after
10 days he was absolutely well.

00:18:43.765 --> 00:18:52.674
He had lot of neurological problem
like teak like neurotic reaction

00:18:52.761 --> 00:18:58.200
and when he came back father
couldn’t recognize him.

00:18:58.245 --> 00:19:03.082
He sit quietly without problem. But of course

00:19:03.128 --> 00:19:08.563
you can’t introduce sahajayoga only
in children mother has to be very very

00:19:08.612 --> 00:19:16.308
with the children and the same
and its usefull in other disease

00:19:16.358 --> 00:19:23.131
or for reference I worked in department of
intensive care and recepation.

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:33.344
Sometimes I rise kundalini and severe attack of
bronchial asthma disappear and many other cases .

00:19:33.383 --> 00:19:43.798
Now I began to with one group of
sahajayoga in hospital doctors,

00:19:43.826 --> 00:19:53.465
nurses and other during about
2 months we began to start probably hospital

00:19:53.497 --> 00:19:56.472
and it gives effect.

00:19:56.472 --> 00:20:01.633
I am so happy that I stay in sahajayoga.

00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:05.067
and everyday thanks Shri Mataji.
Jai Shri Mataji.”

00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:10.529
Western medicine has enhanced the quality
of our life enormously

00:20:10.529 --> 00:20:15.556
and enables us to experience hillo to
unknown heights in medical efficiency.

00:20:15.556 --> 00:20:21.957
But in doing so it has lost sight of the whole.

00:20:21.957 --> 00:20:26.960
By contrast medical doctrines
such as traditional Chinese medicine

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:32.961
approach the human being as a whole
personality the emotional stability,

00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:35.858
mental attitude spiritual requirement and

00:20:35.858 --> 00:20:42.259
also sense morality are considered in a
traditional chinese process of medical treatment.

00:20:42.259 --> 00:20:46.113
As a result traditional
Chinese medicine treatment

00:20:46.139 --> 00:20:49.539
has a subtlety which
western medicine lacks.

00:20:49.583 --> 00:20:52.240
With this realization we have tried to

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.652
translate Chinese medicines into western
culture and into western contexts

00:20:58.652 --> 00:21:03.104
but in doing so the foundation has largely been lost.

00:21:03.104 --> 00:21:06.769
The focus in western medicine remains set up on the element

00:21:06.769 --> 00:21:13.340
and not upon a whole person or his
subtle relationship with the universe.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:18.775
Like Jung’s anima and animus the
yin and yang represents the

00:21:18.801 --> 00:21:23.968
masculine or feminine or right
or left side of our psyche.

00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:27.755
The yang being masculine active right side and

00:21:27.755 --> 00:21:33.327
yin being the feminine passive side.

00:21:33.327 --> 00:21:36.985
Viewed in a light of sahajayoga we can see

00:21:36.985 --> 00:21:39.970
how this parallel is the subtle system.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:45.909
In sahajayoga Tao refers to the
balancing of right and left side.

00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:50.871
When this balance is maintained the
healing energy is able to travel

00:21:50.871 --> 00:21:55.228
on the central channel to integrate
and nourish all the energy centers

00:21:55.228 --> 00:22:00.575
and ultimately keep us in harmony
with the balance of nature.

00:22:00.575 --> 00:22:05.069
“As we have two sides in our system of

00:22:05.069 --> 00:22:07.408
autonomous nervous system left and right

00:22:07.408 --> 00:22:10.505
which we call as left and right
sympathetic nervous system.

00:22:10.505 --> 00:22:20.185
The left side caters for our emotions, for our
past, our desires.

00:22:20.185 --> 00:22:26.730
The right side caters for our action physical and mental.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.758
If we indulge into one too much and go too far with it

00:22:30.758 --> 00:22:34.586
you develop an imbalance within yourself.

00:22:34.586 --> 00:22:39.992
In the centre lies the third power which
we call as parasympathetic nervous system.

00:22:39.992 --> 00:22:43.599
This is channel which is the central
path of ascent.

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:48.448
When the kundalini rises through it, it brings you in
the balance

00:22:48.448 --> 00:22:53.191
because it rises in the
centre of the system.

00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:57.616
So this is a minimum that happens
that you develop your balance.”

00:22:57.616 --> 00:23:06.979
The ascent which is the awakening
of this feminine energy coiled

00:23:06.979 --> 00:23:13.234
and sleeping in our sacrum bone nourishes
and revives the subtle system.

00:23:13.257 --> 00:23:18.898
She is like the Mother Earth
or our own Mother soothing,

00:23:18.924 --> 00:23:24.663
nourishing and sustained the
powers of gentle and strong.

00:23:24.697 --> 00:23:29.824
She is the kundalini the very root of our existence.

00:23:29.824 --> 00:23:36.034
Within her lies the potential for us to
become complete in knowledge of ourselves.

00:23:36.034 --> 00:23:42.017
“All right what I tried to show them that this
is the left side this is the right side.

00:23:42.017 --> 00:23:44.775
This is the left sympathetic nervous system

00:23:44.775 --> 00:23:47.040
and same this is the right
sympathetic nervous system

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.197
and really spinal cord
looks like this and

00:23:50.197 --> 00:23:55.038
inside here is the spinal cord which has
the centres in it.

00:23:55.038 --> 00:23:57.118
The subtle centres.

00:23:57.118 --> 00:24:00.539
Now when you start using
the energy of these

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:07.482
centres say too much on the right
and it starts moving more towards

00:24:07.482 --> 00:24:11.839
the right and there is a constriction
and the power becomes less because

00:24:11.839 --> 00:24:16.242
you are exhausted going more towards
the right side.

00:24:16.242 --> 00:24:19.935
Suddenly something happens that from left there is a jerk

00:24:19.935 --> 00:24:23.634
then the connection is completely broken.

00:24:23.634 --> 00:24:25.585
This is on its own.

00:24:25.585 --> 00:24:28.901
It starts
working on its own that’s we say

00:24:28.901 --> 00:24:33.935
that this has become malignant and no
relationship with the whole

00:24:33.964 --> 00:24:36.413
to have the proportionate growth.

00:24:36.413 --> 00:24:39.218
So if the nose starts developing it can cover

00:24:39.218 --> 00:24:42.226
your eyes and cover your mouth everything.

00:24:42.226 --> 00:24:46.181
This is how a cancer is set
in or any other disease

00:24:46.181 --> 00:24:52.323
so many psychosomatic disease are nothing but
somatic is from right side and when

00:24:52.323 --> 00:24:56.838
the psyche gives in then it becomes a
psychosomatic.

00:24:56.928 --> 00:25:02.442
There are so many diseases which are more psychosomatic
than the physical

00:25:02.442 --> 00:25:09.953
and these we call them as incurable can be easily cured
by kundalini awakening

00:25:09.953 --> 00:25:14.286
because when kundalini passes through this she
just integrates them for example

00:25:14.286 --> 00:25:20.099
she going like this then she goes into
this integrates them.

00:25:20.099 --> 00:25:25.320
Just like she strings them like pearls and so they

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.577
are brought round and also
she nourishes that centre

00:25:29.577 --> 00:25:36.009
that’s how people get cured automatically
by themselves by their own power.”

00:25:36.009 --> 00:25:39.981
Again if we look at traditional Indian medicine

00:25:39.981 --> 00:25:45.573
the purpose of Ayurvedic medicine was
to integrate the mental, physical

00:25:45.573 --> 00:25:48.295
and spiritual wellbeing of patient.

00:25:48.295 --> 00:25:52.826
The identification of three
points of reference bile,

00:25:52.852 --> 00:25:56.937
phlegm and wind corresponds
in sahajayoga to the

00:25:56.937 --> 00:26:01.364
manifestation of right, left and
central channels respectively.

00:26:01.364 --> 00:26:05.707
“As you know that health is normally that is not diseased

00:26:05.707 --> 00:26:10.070
but it is the state of
complete mental, physical,

00:26:10.096 --> 00:26:13.735
emotional, spiritual
and social wellbeing.

00:26:13.735 --> 00:26:19.506
Now this spiritual aspect of health
has been missed in modern medicine.

00:26:19.506 --> 00:26:24.155
It is not known, taught or practiced in modern medicine.

00:26:24.155 --> 00:26:30.287
This word kundalini does not find
mention in the modern medical textbooks

00:26:30.287 --> 00:26:37.339
but it was mentioned in and may
mentioned Indian medical textbooks

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:41.329
of Ayurveda and many other religious
textbooks religious scriptures.”

00:26:41.329 --> 00:26:46.928
“There is a subtle power which is
all pervading of God’s love which

00:26:46.928 --> 00:26:56.348
manifests all the thing like living
work, all nourishment all balancing.

00:26:56.348 --> 00:26:58.345
It’s so balanced.

00:26:58.345 --> 00:27:05.554
If the pacific was slightly deeper than
this; there would have been problems.

00:27:05.554 --> 00:27:15.630
If Himalaya was say one and half times than what it is there
would have been problems.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.981
So everything is so balanced in nature.”

00:27:18.981 --> 00:27:26.269
"Which is the subtle energy
all around us which organizes us and

00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:31.243
which nourishes us, does all the
living work and above all it loves us”

00:27:31.243 --> 00:27:38.544
Sahajayoga takes us back to this original
desire and in practice for future.

00:27:38.544 --> 00:27:43.905
In adressing of spiritual needs
of the human being sahajayoga has

00:27:43.931 --> 00:27:49.666
potential to bring balance back into
west and back into western medicine.

00:27:49.666 --> 00:27:54.632
The essence of sahajayoga is not to cure
people.

00:27:54.657 --> 00:28:00.067
This is a side effect of the subtle
system bring itself into balance

00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:05.680
As its called sahajayoga enables
us to discover our true selves

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.503
the purpose of our being, the true meaning of why we are here.

00:28:11.503 --> 00:28:19.796
“The reason is you
have to now become the spirit

00:28:19.796 --> 00:28:39.899
go beyond your physical, emotional,
mental being and become the spirit.

00:28:39.899 --> 00:28:51.060
Because spirit is the
reflection of God all mighty

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:57.883
and spirit is the universal being within you.

00:28:57.883 --> 00:29:10.139
When you become the spirit you
become a universal being.”
