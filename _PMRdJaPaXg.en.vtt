00:00:01.865 --> 00:00:05.425
It is said that God is love.

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:10.940
We have heard that many a times,

00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:17.555
and many people have explained in their own ways what is love.

00:00:19.548 --> 00:00:26.311
But to feel that love is the best way of understanding it.

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:38.522
Even if you explain or describe in all details,

00:00:51.863 --> 00:00:59.839
though it is described in all details,

00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:11.551
you cannot enjoy love without experiencing it.

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:22.406
This experience comes to us

00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:31.597
because God, Himself, has placed within us the mechanism

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:41.420
to absorb this love and to manifest it.

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:50.171
It is a very delicate mechanism within us, extremely delicate.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.340
This mechanism is placed in our heart,

00:02:04.317 --> 00:02:11.480
and by our ignorance, so many times,

00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:22.542
we spoil this mechanism or disturb it,
or sometimes even completely destroy it.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:30.672
The light of love is joy.

00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:41.080
Anything else cannot give you joy.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:52.029
It’s only the love that you feel in your heart gives you joy.

00:02:55.453 --> 00:03:01.202
This mechanism acts in seven layers within us.

00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:06.483
In the periphery of these seven layers,

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:16.322
we have got ripples of this joy arising;

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:26.944
they come to the shores of our brain and create the bubbles of joy.

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:36.785
But again if the brain is a very rational rock

00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:45.748
then these bubbles dissolve, giving no effect to the rock.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.686
So a loving person is thousand times better than a rational person.

00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:08.893
But most of the people feel this love only on the periphery of the

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:16.472
outermost layer, which is the light of the Mooladhara.

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:28.846
As you know that Mooladhara has got excretory effects

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:37.108
and how important or relieved we feel when our excretions are all right.

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.767
It’s a basic thing.

00:04:41.262 --> 00:04:48.117
But that relief gives you a kind of a joy and happiness.

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:59.197
Is very gross, is very “low type” as they call it,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:08.733
but very important  for us to get that joy.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:25.303
But to make this joy not so dominating over all other joys of

00:05:25.493 --> 00:05:32.237
deeper sensitivity, is to be innocent.

00:05:33.824 --> 00:05:38.709
I know one cannot be innocent, you have to be innocent yourself.

00:05:38.897 --> 00:05:44.986
But with Sahaja Yoga you can by clearing your Mooladhara.

00:05:47.276 --> 00:05:53.067
So that’s very important that our Mooladharas must be clear,

00:05:53.238 --> 00:06:00.343
our innocence must be established, so that these gross joys do not

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:13.726
cover the entire spectrum of our life and make us slaves of these gross joy-giving reliefs.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:24.933
But to clean your Mooladhara does not mean by any chance in Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:32.349
to get after any kind of obsession and obstruction,

00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:41.019
but to give a natural release, like an innocent child,

00:06:43.797 --> 00:06:52.029
to these ripples, which need not go back

00:06:53.336 --> 00:06:58.905
to all the other layers of joy.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:09.956
You must have seen, when the ripples in a ocean touch the shores,

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:12.678
they turn back.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.884
If the shores are made of very hard rocks

00:07:22.122 --> 00:07:31.605
this turning can be very deep and the waves can go much deeper.

00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:38.670
If the brain is very ego-oriented, is covered with ego,

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:46.719
then these joys have a much greater significance in life than normally it is.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:57.150
Innocence is the only way one can neutralise

00:07:57.516 --> 00:08:08.168
those ripples coming back on the other six very important layers.

00:08:10.949 --> 00:08:17.852
As you go forward you know in the second layer is the joy of creativity.

00:08:19.607 --> 00:08:26.879
In the joy of creativity, when the joy of creativity comes within us,

00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:34.382
it again comes back to the periphery.

00:08:34.573 --> 00:08:37.915
For some people it is so important, so maddening,

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:40.494
to create something – they are mad after it.

00:08:40.597 --> 00:08:43.524
And they think it is something so important to do,

00:08:43.695 --> 00:08:50.323
to create some thought, to create some book, to create some artistic impressions or something.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:55.448
For some people it’s very important, so they create.

00:08:57.109 --> 00:09:07.201
And this creativity when it hits some rational mind,

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:13.318
it gives him the same kind of a deeper reaction,

00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:18.807
that a person starts thinking that he is the greatest of all

00:09:18.896 --> 00:09:22.479
and whatever he does to the rest of the world is all right as long as

00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:25.800
he’s a great creator of thought or ideas.

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:33.563
Such a man can become very, very dogmatic,

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:37.591
dominating and could be tyrannical,

00:09:37.988 --> 00:09:43.583
because he thinks whatever he does is showing results, showing success according to him.

00:09:43.732 --> 00:09:47.189
He rationalises the whole thing and the whole thing goes back,

00:09:47.347 --> 00:09:52.215
much deeper into him, covers all other his chakras.

00:09:53.747 --> 00:10:02.978
So the neutralising of this second layer is thoughtless awareness.

00:10:08.495 --> 00:10:11.550
Nirvikhar, nirvichar.

00:10:11.995 --> 00:10:17.106
When your awareness is enlightened – samadhi –

00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:26.865
and you are in nirvichar state, then whatever you create, you just see it.

00:10:27.516 --> 00:10:35.720
In thoughtless awareness you really enjoy
whatever you see or whatever you create.

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:39.599
You are in thoughtless awareness.

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:45.667
That is how it is kept to the periphery.

00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:48.745
It is important that it should be kept,

00:10:48.848 --> 00:10:54.752
coming on the brain, because brain is the one which records it.

00:10:56.313 --> 00:11:02.805
And if the brain is such a solid stuff that it cannot record, it is not sensitive,

00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:13.475
most of it is lost in giving it a reaction, and the whole joy is finished.

00:11:15.134 --> 00:11:18.600
For example you create some painting.

00:11:19.704 --> 00:11:23.343
You just create it and just look at it without any thought.

00:11:23.605 --> 00:11:28.722
The complete joy of your heart which you have poured onto that canvas

00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:34.559
will be filling you completely and you’ll feel the flow of joy going down.

00:11:37.363 --> 00:11:44.991
If creation is done in thoughtless awareness, then it’s the most pure.

00:11:45.718 --> 00:11:51.573
Apart from that, it is the most beautiful, it is the most perfect,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.293
because such a painting or such an art

00:11:56.444 --> 00:12:05.786
or such a creation, such a thought, such a book, such an idea, will emit vibrations.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:16.687
The co-efficience to emit vibrations will be complete if it is done in thoughtless awareness.

00:12:16.849 --> 00:12:23.177
That’s why those who are realised souls, when they create something,

00:12:24.818 --> 00:12:31.117
or they produce something, you find

00:12:32.015 --> 00:12:39.598
it easy to find out whether it is giving vibrations or not, very easy.

00:12:43.329 --> 00:12:55.600
In the same way you go to the third very, very important centre of your Nabhi,

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:06.198
Nabhi or you can call it the Navel Chakra.

00:13:08.999 --> 00:13:18.986
The joy of feeling that you have eaten the food cannot be described.

00:13:20.446 --> 00:13:25.712
In Marathi they’ll say, “Ata tsangla pote bharla amtza”
(now my stomach is nicely full)

00:13:26.442 --> 00:13:32.028
If you are hungry you won’t even take to Sahaj Yog,
you won’t take to God.

00:13:32.104 --> 00:13:38.524
Even if God is standing before you you’ll say,
“First, fill my stomach, oh God, then I will talk to You"

00:13:39.969 --> 00:13:44.494
”And when you eat the food the joy you get out of that

00:13:44.693 --> 00:13:48.815
also goes to the periphery, as usual.

00:13:51.381 --> 00:13:59.301
If it goes to a rational rock, as I said,

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:08.025
then again the effect is deeper.

00:14:08.842 --> 00:14:14.412
If you start thinking about it,

00:14:14.566 --> 00:14:21.331
you feel, “I have had my food, others must have,” and this and that and all those things.

00:14:22.215 --> 00:14:28.245
And then you think that “I must have more of this and more of that.

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:37.166
I must have something more to fill my, feed my stomach.

00:14:37.624 --> 00:14:42.611
Now when you are – say, you have a limited stomach,

00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:46.650
you can’t eat mounds of food.

00:14:46.849 --> 00:14:49.818
Some people can eat, I don’t know,

00:14:49.929 --> 00:14:53.127
otherwise somebody will start arguing on that.

00:14:53.285 --> 00:14:56.675
Some may be eating quite a lot, I don’t deny that.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.661
But normally people have very limited stomach.

00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:06.690
Then when your stomach is limited, you start thinking, “Oh!

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:10.336
My stomach is limited still the joy of the Nabhi chakra is not yet complete,

00:15:10.423 --> 00:15:12.894
let me think of something else.

00:15:13.633 --> 00:15:17.973
” So you end up with, maybe with alcohol,

00:15:18.107 --> 00:15:22.151
because alcohol you think takes no space in the stomach.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:27.816
You think it has a different spacing in the stomach.

00:15:27.911 --> 00:15:30.294
I have seen people drinking beer.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:34.839
I was surprised you cannot drink so much of water as people can drink beer!

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:41.053
Most surprising, pints of pints of beer they can go on drinking,

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.339
and they never feel satisfied.

00:15:46.869 --> 00:15:55.136
At this time, the movement starts towards the left of the joy.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:01.200
This is the beginning of the left side, we start.

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:07.167
And that time, you think that by getting drunk you are getting

00:16:07.421 --> 00:16:12.455
into a very romantic mood, or some sort of a nonsense like that.

00:16:13.122 --> 00:16:19.452
Then you start spending all your time, wasting your life, taking to laziness, to inertia.

00:16:19.801 --> 00:16:22.645
You may take to drugs.

00:16:28.824 --> 00:16:36.880
This is, I would say, can reach up to the heart of a person or to the liver of the person.

00:16:37.777 --> 00:16:40.767
The liver goes on becoming solid and solid.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.333
The more you drink the worse you become.

00:16:47.448 --> 00:16:52.107
So, man goes on, wasting his time

00:16:52.282 --> 00:16:58.451
trying to get joy out of something which is so dangerous for your being.

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:01.656
Anybody who says that drinking is very bad,

00:17:01.783 --> 00:17:04.301
people immediately say that “Oh, he is absolutely

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:08.587
Victorian,” or I don’t know, whatever it is they brand the person.

00:17:09.402 --> 00:17:16.154
Now how to get rid of Nabhi complication?

00:17:19.935 --> 00:17:24.479
Because these joys are so temporary, you will see in every case.

00:17:24.715 --> 00:17:28.593
Now Nabhi joy is also very temporary.

00:17:29.419 --> 00:17:32.785
And you do not also enjoy it much, if you could,

00:17:32.881 --> 00:17:36.596
you would not go into it again and again.

00:17:38.382 --> 00:17:43.691
So the neutralising point is satisfaction.

00:17:45.826 --> 00:17:48.004
You should feel satisfied.

00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:51.834
You have eaten all right two morsels, feel satisfied –

00:17:51.988 --> 00:18:00.933
even with two morsels you will be much happy
than like a bakasur if you eat a mound of rice.

00:18:01.671 --> 00:18:07.906
To be satisfied is the only way you can neutralise your Nabhi.

00:18:08.438 --> 00:18:14.253
In all your wants, material wants, there’s no end to it.

00:18:14.797 --> 00:18:20.627
You go on supplying any number of things, you’ll go on asking for more.

00:18:24.273 --> 00:18:26.340
But you have not enjoyed anything.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.005
You have bought one piece of cloth,

00:18:30.172 --> 00:18:35.150
you’ve made a shirt for yourself – you want to have another one

00:18:35.277 --> 00:18:39.607
because a person who is working in your office has got this kind of a shirt.

00:18:40.012 --> 00:18:43.433
So you’ll run all over the world to find that shirt.

00:18:43.569 --> 00:18:47.124
But the one who is wearing the shirt, he’s running

00:18:47.315 --> 00:18:51.897
all over the world to find a shirt as you have made!

00:18:53.976 --> 00:19:01.951
So this madness goes on increasing and the Nabhi chakra remains in a big turmoil.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.291
So one of the neutralising points, most important is satisfaction of Nabhi.

00:19:10.688 --> 00:19:14.820
At every point you should try to feel satisfied.

00:19:15.732 --> 00:19:21.164
“All right, if I haven’t got it, I am satisfied.

00:19:21.374 --> 00:19:24.132
” At that moment you will get the joy.

00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:30.034
“I have got this thing, all right I am satisfied.
” You’ll get the joy.

00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:35.243
And others will be also in happy disposition.

00:19:35.553 --> 00:19:39.355
Imagine a man who is gregarious, living in a house.

00:19:39.461 --> 00:19:44.687
I mean you just don’t like such a man, it looks so odd.

00:19:47.104 --> 00:20:03.890
MARATHI  -  4 MINUTES

00:21:56.564 --> 00:22:01.541
So satisfaction is the only way one can enjoy

00:22:02.612 --> 00:22:06.135
Even say I'm speaking in English.

00:22:08.662 --> 00:22:14.368
if you just see are you enjoying the satisfaction of it?

00:22:15.313 --> 00:22:17.424
Supposing I was not a Maharashtrian,

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.582
I could have been born a Japanese, or a Chinese.

00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:26.118
And supposing I was speaking in Chinese with three thousand words,

00:22:26.951 --> 00:22:32.367
“ting tung tang,” then what who’d have understood Me?

00:22:37.644 --> 00:22:42.628
So again here we come to the same question, are we satisfied?

00:22:42.827 --> 00:22:45.509
Whatever we get.

00:22:46.904 --> 00:22:51.514
Those who are looking for amrut, for ambrosia,

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:57.020
do not bother about the words, they just want to pick up

00:22:57.075 --> 00:23:01.663
what Mataji’s saying is the essence – pick it up.

00:23:02.444 --> 00:23:07.282
That’s how you are going to feel satisfied.

00:23:13.059 --> 00:23:19.130
Now the, you have seen now about

00:23:19.707 --> 00:23:24.649
I was even satisfied with this heavy stuff.
[Mother jokes as the microphone is moved)

00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:54.795
For example if I want to be dissatisfied now,

00:23:55.192 --> 00:24:02.861
I can say, “Why do you put it up, two colours before Me

00:24:03.511 --> 00:24:06.119
and this dirty handkerchief?”

00:24:07.659 --> 00:24:09.850
Or I can say something else.

00:24:10.178 --> 00:24:14.033
There’s no end to madness, if you start with dissatisfaction.

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:21.308
But if you start with satisfaction, then that’s the point.

00:24:21.765 --> 00:24:27.401
You don’t have to go further – this way, that way – you just go deep.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.774
In Marathi language also some things can be said “Mala udatatsa nai, mala tsalatatsa

00:24:37.159 --> 00:24:43.615
nai, tav lawala ki gele, asasts kara tasats kara”.

00:24:45.436 --> 00:24:51.009
Such a person is such a headache I tell you.

00:24:57.705 --> 00:25:01.856
He is such a person as soon as you see you feel,  “Oh God,

00:25:01.998 --> 00:25:07.050
what have I done today to deserve this?”

00:25:09.625 --> 00:25:16.125
A person should live in this world like the flowers.

00:25:17.665 --> 00:25:21.862
You can’t see them, how they bloom, what time they bloom.

00:25:22.047 --> 00:25:31.731
But when they bloom, can only feel their fragrance, their love.

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:43.648
Satisfaction you cannot have without realisation.

00:25:44.387 --> 00:25:48.078
So before that, if I say, “You should be satisfied,” it’s just brainwashing.

00:25:48.229 --> 00:25:49.328
You cannot be.

00:25:49.495 --> 00:25:54.646
After realisation, because you have found that what satisfies your Spirit.

00:25:55.449 --> 00:25:58.087
That’s why your priorities change.

00:25:58.202 --> 00:26:02.635
You get satisfied for nothing at all.

00:26:09.489 --> 00:26:13.691
You may do lots of labour to achieve something

00:26:14.946 --> 00:26:20.696
and you can be absolutely frustrated and unhappy person,

00:26:22.541 --> 00:26:25.417
and you can be all the time blaming yourself.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:30.621
And the same person can be the happiest person.

00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:33.958
Some people do this much of work.

00:26:34.075 --> 00:26:36.770
You tell them, “Go and get a flower.

00:26:36.926 --> 00:26:41.567
“Oh Mataji, very difficult these days, You know?” Started.

00:26:42.051 --> 00:26:44.423
To get one flower, it means,

00:26:44.573 --> 00:26:47.070
“Nowadays it’s very expensive, You don’t know.

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:50.830
It used to be one pies, now it is at least two annas.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:52.342
Very difficult.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.053
“Accha baba, take two annas and go and get it“.
“But how will I go?

00:26:56.193 --> 00:26:59.702
The bus is very difficult these days…” Started.

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:04.036
“The flower will never come, your two annas will be lost.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.197
Your bus fare will be lost.

00:27:11.989 --> 00:27:19.596
So a person who is satisfied is the most efficient person.

00:27:21.142 --> 00:27:30.493
Our country suffers from Nabhi Chakra, that’s why we are very inefficient people.

00:27:30.977 --> 00:27:33.870
For everything we have excuses.

00:27:34.038 --> 00:27:41.043
Like, “This is not working, because this was not working.

00:27:41.705 --> 00:27:46.960
” Our inefficiency comes out of Nabhi Chakra problem.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:54.209
If you are a satisfied person, your work is very satisfying also.

00:27:57.268 --> 00:28:04.072
If a lady has a good Nabhi, when she cooks her food,

00:28:05.874 --> 00:28:10.243
with very little food you feel very satisfied.

00:28:11.926 --> 00:28:16.201
Whatever she will do will be excellent.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:27.280
So for all Nabhi problems, one mantra one must remember is of satisfaction.

00:28:33.718 --> 00:28:37.639
Now we go to Void, though in the seven layers

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.801
it is little confused with Nabhi, but we have to see to Void also.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:53.508
In dharma, in sustenance, we get happiness about it.

00:28:56.011 --> 00:29:02.042
When we try to be nice to someone we get happiness out of it.

00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:10.463
But some people who are supposed to be dharmic can be horrid.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:16.605
So boring that you would like to run away from such people all your life.

00:29:16.782 --> 00:29:19.591
They are supposed to be very religious people,

00:29:19.742 --> 00:29:24.163
they get up at four o’clock in the morning,
torture everyone around,

00:29:24.282 --> 00:29:29.731
then they do their aarti, rubbing of, what you call, the sandalwood.

00:29:29.869 --> 00:29:34.983
Then having a bath with a big stotra going on.

00:29:35.213 --> 00:29:37.033
Everybody must wake up.

00:29:37.088 --> 00:29:42.951
Maybe, the mother has slept very little – she is looking after her children

00:29:43.093 --> 00:29:48.115
or something, something going on – they must disturb everyone, saying that they are dharmics.

00:29:48.297 --> 00:29:52.237
Very hot tempered, angry people.

00:29:53.646 --> 00:30:08.310
This dharma can be neutralised  in a very, very simple way,

00:30:09.739 --> 00:30:27.186
that, dharma is your own concentration, inward.

00:30:28.113 --> 00:30:35.324
Like you want to donate something to someone, it’s just between you and God,

00:30:35.428 --> 00:30:41.561
there is no expression of it outside at all.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:46.249
If you are honest – God save Me from many honest people,

00:30:46.331 --> 00:30:51.131
I tell you, some of these so-called honest can be so blunt that you cannot go near them.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:55.915
They think if they are honest then they have a right to cut everybody’s throat.

00:31:11.816 --> 00:31:14.154
In Marathi language you see,

00:31:14.297 --> 00:31:18.043
we have beautiful names for such people you see.

00:31:18.418 --> 00:31:28.229
Who are ‘karmathas’ and absolutely ‘dandeshahi’ we call them, ‘dandadharis’.

00:31:28.515 --> 00:31:32.453
Such a pundit if he is going from this side, go from the other side of the road.

00:31:32.563 --> 00:31:35.152
Otherwise he might just hit you hard.

00:31:35.242 --> 00:31:36.836
You ask him, “What is it?

00:31:36.852 --> 00:31:38.628
Why did you hit me hard?”

00:31:38.835 --> 00:31:47.859
“Because you are not supposed to take
your parting to that extreme of the head.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.757
Mataji has said, ‘The parting should be in the centre!’

00:31:51.928 --> 00:31:56.594
But it is for you I have said it not for anybody else.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:06.031
It should be concentrated on yourself – the dharma is for ourselves.

00:32:06.922 --> 00:32:09.402
“Mataji has said…”

00:32:09.604 --> 00:32:12.448
I am surprised sometimes at what I am saying.

00:32:12.561 --> 00:32:14.448
So many people have this bad habit

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.493
of going around saying, “Mataji has said that this should be done.

00:32:17.582 --> 00:32:19.612
Mataji has said this should be done.

00:32:19.719 --> 00:32:25.569
” I don’t know if I have said it or not. But why do you say?
You should say, “I say. ”

00:32:26.165 --> 00:32:30.676
Why don’t you say that “I say as sahaja yogi.

00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:37.321
But it is all your own.

00:32:37.955 --> 00:32:46.893
It’s your own clearing that is important in dharma and not anybody else’s.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:55.418
There’s a relationship between you and your Guru.
Direct.

00:32:56.005 --> 00:33:01.000
Supposing you come and tell Me something that
“Mataji, this is between You and me."

00:33:02.096 --> 00:33:05.952
That is between you and Me, though I’m not bound by it, not at all.

00:33:06.175 --> 00:33:12.178
If it is necessary I may speak it out,
but 99% I’ll keep it that as a secret.

00:33:12.281 --> 00:33:18.821
So it is the secrecy of your own dharma.
The beauty of it is like this.

00:33:19.363 --> 00:33:22.332
You see the subtleties – ‘sukshmat baga’.

00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:27.345
If you are a dharmic man – it’s so sweet, you know?

00:33:27.742 --> 00:33:38.313
Suddenly you’ll find the shine appearing
like a diamond suddenly, with all the facets.

00:33:38.744 --> 00:33:44.885
Suddenly you’ll find a person, “Oh, what a beautiful man he is!”

00:33:45.687 --> 00:33:51.472
But you are not looking after yourself, looking after everybody’s dharmas.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:59.249
Then the same thing will happen, that the joy of dharma will only

00:33:59.773 --> 00:34:04.109
felt, will  be felt if you limit it to yourself.

00:34:04.459 --> 00:34:07.730
That cannot be shared.

00:34:08.634 --> 00:34:11.169
Virtues cannot be shared.

00:34:11.303 --> 00:34:17.287
Can I share My virtues with you? I cannot.

00:34:21.732 --> 00:34:24.036
You can support it.

00:34:24.593 --> 00:34:27.838
Somebody has the virtuous man, then you can support him.

00:34:28.058 --> 00:34:34.299
But the joy of that dharma, that rasa,

00:34:34.562 --> 00:34:39.839
falling into your heart, nobody else can enjoy it.

00:34:40.068 --> 00:34:43.713
You enjoy your own chastity.

00:34:47.934 --> 00:34:52.354
It is of course written, “Thou shalt not do, thou shalt not do…”

00:34:52.505 --> 00:34:58.190
These are all commandments have come, but they can come only from God not from you.

00:34:58.578 --> 00:35:02.632
Once you start doing it to others, you are finished!

00:35:03.189 --> 00:35:08.272
You have lost the joy of your dharma.

00:35:10.224 --> 00:35:16.254
Now we have one Mr. Kulkarni here, his dharma is like that.

00:35:17.952 --> 00:35:20.587
There are moni like Mr. Patil is there.

00:35:20.705 --> 00:35:22.039
So many like that.

00:35:22.131 --> 00:35:25.941
I mean I don’t want to name any more, otherwise “j” will start, jealousy.

00:35:26.124 --> 00:35:29.076
But we have lots of people,

00:35:29.478 --> 00:35:36.831
who have a dharma within them, which just shows you, suddenly.

00:35:37.536 --> 00:35:45.132
And you try to test them, they will just tell you, “Pan Mataji, tejat amtsa tsukel dar”

00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:50.243
Absolutely on the point of dharma if you are,

00:35:50.485 --> 00:35:53.746
you will never teach dharma to others.

00:35:53.921 --> 00:35:57.436
Preaching religion is against religion.

00:35:57.661 --> 00:36:00.875
You cannot preach, how can you preach religion?
I cannot understand,

00:36:01.018 --> 00:36:04.964
till today I have not been able to understand, how can you preach religion?

00:36:05.367 --> 00:36:13.615
We can only evolve our own, imbibe our own, except for the people who are incarnations.

00:36:13.813 --> 00:36:18.374
They can tell what is religion, but they cannot put religion into you.

00:36:18.564 --> 00:36:25.357
And when you start enjoying that religion within you,

00:36:26.341 --> 00:36:29.950
you start having that more and more within yourself,

00:36:30.264 --> 00:36:34.732
then you start respecting yourself. Your self-respect comes in.

00:36:37.813 --> 00:36:50.175
So, we take it to this, that religion is the respect.

00:36:51.464 --> 00:37:00.500
The neutralisation of using religion for wrong things, is respect.

00:37:01.929 --> 00:37:06.936
Respect every other person; respect his religion.

00:37:07.243 --> 00:37:11.934
Respect the principles of other religions, of religion I am saying.

00:37:12.485 --> 00:37:15.777
Otherwise you will get up and start running behind bhoots!

00:37:15.886 --> 00:37:18.011
Again discrimination should be there.

00:37:18.164 --> 00:37:25.580
I am saying respect the religion that is within you and the religion in another person.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:30.470
Maybe, secretly that person is very religious.
Outwardly he doesn’t show off.

00:37:34.758 --> 00:37:37.274
All the centres if I have to talk it will be too much

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.633
Whatever you say, I have no desire!

00:38:01.845 --> 00:38:06.876
So we come to religions, which is a part of Nabhi.

00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:15.882
The satisfaction of religion is only possible

00:38:16.068 --> 00:38:22.372
when you learn to respect other people, their religion, their styles.

00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:26.069
Because in Sahaja Yoga very commonly…

00:38:26.496 --> 00:38:29.690
There is a Marathi word for that, “khul.

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:34.052
” In English I don’t know. A ‘kink’, kink, I think is the word.

00:38:34.474 --> 00:38:40.323
That, “He’s catching there, she’s catching there,
Mrs. that thing is catching, is that thing is catching…”

00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:42.649
Is a crack in the head.

00:38:42.808 --> 00:38:47.502
For sahaja yogis it’s very common are, what is catching in you?

00:38:47.914 --> 00:38:50.690
Everybody is caught up by you and here you are,

00:38:50.753 --> 00:38:53.280
“That person is catching there, that person is catching there.

00:38:53.319 --> 00:38:56.456
This person has this catch, that – another has that catch.

00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:04.211
” This is how Sahaja Yoga is going to improve, or fall down?

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:10.235
Without telling that person, without talking to him about it,

00:39:10.568 --> 00:39:13.293
you can correct his catches and your own.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.907
Why are you catching?
Because you have some weakness.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:20.467
I never catch from anyone.

00:39:20.711 --> 00:39:23.964
So to denounce somebody or to put down somebody is not proper,

00:39:24.059 --> 00:39:26.989
that shows that you have less strength.
So you should say that

00:39:27.091 --> 00:39:32.122
“Mother I have less strength and
because that person has so much of this kind of a vibrations

00:39:32.217 --> 00:39:33.856
I feel little bad.

00:39:34.024 --> 00:39:36.610
If the whole world is all right and then you are going to feel

00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:39.005
all right then what’s the use of having this light?

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:42.800
Just think of this.

00:39:43.859 --> 00:39:48.004
That we’ll say that “All right, I am the light

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.469
and I have to give light, I am a realised soul.

00:39:50.609 --> 00:39:55.423
But when all the lights are all right, then only I will be with them.

00:39:55.747 --> 00:39:59.269
” So what a light-and-a-half, what’s the use of having such a light?

00:39:59.578 --> 00:40:05.279
We should have such lights that can go in the darkness and finish the darkness.

00:40:10.956 --> 00:40:16.617
That light is the light of dharma within us.

00:40:16.919 --> 00:40:20.412
It is not – how many times you meditate, how many times you sit in the water,

00:40:20.468 --> 00:40:23.629
put your feet in the water, or use My photograph

00:40:23.716 --> 00:40:26.285
or what you do and all these rituals – it is not that,

00:40:26.341 --> 00:40:30.340
it is how much dharma is within your heart.

00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:39.440
Sharayu’s mother is another very great example, of that dharma.

00:40:39.741 --> 00:40:43.284
There’s so many of them, but I’m mentioning all the senior people

00:40:43.346 --> 00:40:46.892
because you don’t feel jealous of them much.

00:40:49.106 --> 00:40:53.864
So try to imbibe the dharma within yourself.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:05.247
And then you will see eventually

00:41:05.462 --> 00:41:08.249
you’ll become a very generous-hearted person, very generous-hearted

00:41:08.326 --> 00:41:11.356
because you starting tolerating everyone.

00:41:15.415 --> 00:41:18.675
Even generous as far as money is concerned, that’s something so gross.

00:41:18.763 --> 00:41:21.739
I mean, a person who is a kanjus (stingy) of money is absolutely gross.

00:41:21.807 --> 00:41:25.215
But beyond that is tolerating other people.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:30.231
There are some people who have a nice house –
they don’t want anybody else to come in.

00:41:30.684 --> 00:41:34.418
In London it’s very common.
I have seen in England, very common.

00:41:34.537 --> 00:41:38.500
They’ll have a huge nice house, all the time they are cleaning, sweeping, swabbing,

00:41:38.586 --> 00:41:39.861
putting, polishing.

00:41:39.894 --> 00:41:44.536
Even rat won’t enter that house!

00:41:46.113 --> 00:41:49.743
And they used to say, “You have a open house or what?”

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:51.883
I said, “Yes, I mean you have a closed one?”

00:41:51.936 --> 00:41:54.978
I didn’t know what is a closed house?

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.310
Say, “Our comfort is ours.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:00.495
Saturday, Sunday should be our own and we cannot

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:03.749
share it with anyone,” that sort of a temperament.

00:42:05.376 --> 00:42:09.852
Then you start tolerating, you become generous.

00:42:12.454 --> 00:42:16.019
You start giving for others.

00:42:17.712 --> 00:42:22.335
Giving vibrations.

00:42:29.015 --> 00:42:37.453
So, you know that I have told many people who catch on Nabhi or void,

00:42:37.714 --> 00:42:41.694
that today you do some daan (charity).

00:42:43.615 --> 00:42:48.745
So they will go and give it to Indira Gandhi,

00:42:49.809 --> 00:42:53.745
because they want a seat in the election.

00:42:55.385 --> 00:42:58.654
This is the specialty of rational people.

00:43:05.896 --> 00:43:09.558
So do some daan.

00:43:11.281 --> 00:43:15.493
There are so many places where one can give gifts.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.712
Of course Sahaj Yoga is one of the greatest places where you should give daan,

00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:22.557
but…there are so many places.

00:43:23.651 --> 00:43:29.038
But don’t remember and go and tell them that “All right, I’ll give you five rupees,

00:43:29.187 --> 00:43:34.766
but you will have to put my at least initials in the marble.

00:43:36.884 --> 00:43:38.375
Kan-ju-sha!

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:49.407
You don’t see initials, of mine, in the marble, with the black.

00:43:49.595 --> 00:43:59.424
Generosity just flows, it flows and emits by itself and you just starting enjoying it.

00:44:05.599 --> 00:44:15.786
Now the most important Chakra is that of the Jagadamba, is the heart,

00:44:21.412 --> 00:44:27.123
and this gives you joy.

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:39.976
At a point where you have relationships with your children.

00:44:45.966 --> 00:44:51.395
The people who are generous for them the whole world is their own children.

00:44:52.926 --> 00:44:56.569
” For everyone the love flows.

00:44:58.626 --> 00:45:04.562
Everybody’s worry is the worry of that person.

00:45:05.418 --> 00:45:14.580
This comes from the centre heart that you try to mother every person.

00:45:15.356 --> 00:45:17.798
That feeling is there.

00:45:18.113 --> 00:45:29.773
But the anti, anti-joy people are,

00:45:30.368 --> 00:45:34.726
“This is my son, this is my daughter.

00:45:34.951 --> 00:45:39.186
Now the son will bring a dowry, so keep some good food for him

00:45:39.284 --> 00:45:42.722
and to the daughter give her some dahi bhaat (curd with rice).

00:45:46.082 --> 00:45:52.461
” Then goes little further, “This is my son and this is my daughter

00:45:53.529 --> 00:45:56.743
I must get all the money in the world,

00:45:57.085 --> 00:46:02.250
live like a miserly fellow, to spend in the marriage of my children.

00:46:04.492 --> 00:46:07.885
Then? What happens to you?

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:15.257
You are left high and dry, children go away, then don’t even look at you.

00:46:17.195 --> 00:46:21.535
Then, “This is my father, this is my mother.

00:46:22.115 --> 00:46:27.446
This is my daughter, this is my son,

00:46:28.018 --> 00:46:31.017
and I have to look after them after all.

00:46:31.114 --> 00:46:35.549
So I can make some black market money, what is the harm after all?

00:46:35.668 --> 00:46:37.368
You see I have to look after.

00:46:37.492 --> 00:46:41.323
” This is rationality against the heart.

00:46:42.625 --> 00:46:48.885
The ones whom we so-called protect, we put them into sin!

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:55.171
Go further, “This is my son, this is my daughter.

00:46:55.694 --> 00:46:58.846
They must become prime ministers after me.

00:47:00.022 --> 00:47:02.060
” Or they must get money.

00:47:03.492 --> 00:47:07.373
“So what can I do?
He is my son, he is looking after me, this is my son;

00:47:07.484 --> 00:47:11.372
he knows all these things that I have done.

00:47:11.538 --> 00:47:17.014
So, after all even if the whole country goes to dogs what does it matter?

00:47:18.062 --> 00:47:20.353
I am a mother/I am a father,

00:47:20.473 --> 00:47:23.922
I must look after my children, that’s my first and primal duty.

00:47:25.572 --> 00:47:32.639
So the joy is absolutely killed.

00:47:32.821 --> 00:47:38.995
Because you see your children misbehaving, you see your children going to dogs.

00:47:39.598 --> 00:47:43.734
You see them going away from God to hell.

00:47:43.952 --> 00:47:50.403
Many parents are responsible for sending their children to hell.

00:47:50.617 --> 00:47:56.398
They are supposed to be looking after their children.

00:47:56.981 --> 00:48:05.708
Then the other extreme, of course you know that,
when you get such examples

00:48:06.621 --> 00:48:10.159
then the reaction comes in where like [in] the West:

00:48:10.223 --> 00:48:14.185
you just don’t care for your children – throw them in the dust.

00:48:24.959 --> 00:48:32.780
So, these protective measures we take, or these paternal feelings we have,

00:48:37.705 --> 00:48:44.215
should be without any attachment and fear.

00:48:45.324 --> 00:48:49.121
Any fear! Insurance.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:53.421
“Children, must get insurance money,

00:48:53.707 --> 00:48:57.520
because tomorrow we die, what will happen to them?”

00:48:57.796 --> 00:49:01.028
What about these birds?
They never insure themselves.

00:49:01.916 --> 00:49:08.087
So insure yourselves, insure everyone, go on worrying about your children.

00:49:18.171 --> 00:49:27.118
All sorts of efforts we put in to give protection because we have fear,

00:49:27.542 --> 00:49:30.079
we have fear of the future.

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:41.640
And this fear of the future could be got rid of; then

00:49:42.786 --> 00:49:45.817
our protection will be at a time when they need the protection,

00:49:45.865 --> 00:49:50.185
when they do not need the protection
we are not going to give them any protection.

00:49:50.352 --> 00:49:56.888
Then only our protective joy will be complete.

00:50:07.011 --> 00:50:18.559
So the protection is given by the Goddess to Her bhaktas,

00:50:19.465 --> 00:50:25.853
not to abhaktas, not to rakshashas.

00:50:27.634 --> 00:50:30.686
But you people do not discriminate in protection.

00:50:30.869 --> 00:50:34.065
To you a son who is born who maybe a rakshas also,

00:50:34.303 --> 00:50:36.663
“Doesn’t matter, give him protection.

00:50:37.203 --> 00:50:43.160
” Others are to be protected from him, but you are protecting [him].

00:50:43.581 --> 00:50:47.603
People are frightened of your son,

00:50:49.225 --> 00:50:54.457
but you will be protecting him still, giving all protection

00:50:54.637 --> 00:51:01.702
and encouraging him to kill others, removing their protection and giving them fear.

00:51:03.289 --> 00:51:06.116
So what is the essence?

00:51:08.306 --> 00:51:15.482
First and foremost is, essence of Heart Chakra is security,

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:19.329
is to feel your own security yourself.

00:51:22.466 --> 00:51:26.715
Feel your own security within yourself.

00:51:27.016 --> 00:51:34.733
Only the realised can feel that security because they know they have their Atma – their Spirit.

00:51:35.852 --> 00:51:40.692
At small, small things, we destroy our security;

00:51:40.891 --> 00:51:46.449
like supposing you wear a blue shirt and a black pant – finished,

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:50.920
you can’t walk on the street because everybody will start criticising.

00:51:51.070 --> 00:51:59.209
You will wear a red pant (trousers) just to match with the blue one, and get some trouble.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.967
But you cannot wear something different because the whole world

00:52:02.991 --> 00:52:05.620
will be saying, “Oh God you are wearing this and that!”

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.769
So the complete security within yourself is that,

00:52:09.849 --> 00:52:14.705
that you are the Self and these things are not important.

00:52:15.081 --> 00:52:20.057
If you are a secured man your children will also find that out, that,

00:52:20.192 --> 00:52:26.275
their security lies in finding their own securities.

00:52:27.156 --> 00:52:32.418
They themselves will say, “Now, don’t try to help us to spoil us.

00:52:33.175 --> 00:52:39.615
Do not give us things by which we feel more insecure.

00:52:43.044 --> 00:52:49.052
” And such children would be really brave children, like Shivaji was.

00:52:49.539 --> 00:52:54.197
His mother gave him all the protection no doubt, but she made a Shivaji out of him.

00:52:54.364 --> 00:52:59.945
Any mother who all the time sort of, we see hankers after the son or the daughter and

00:53:00.028 --> 00:53:06.166
weeping and crying, must know that she has to create a Shivaji out of him because,

00:53:06.268 --> 00:53:08.318
she is a sahaja yogini.

00:53:09.025 --> 00:53:13.990
They have to carry the swords of their Mother.

00:53:14.442 --> 00:53:20.641
These crying babies, what are we going to do with them?

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:33.249
Feel your own security, and then the joy of that security will take you to your depth.

00:53:33.916 --> 00:53:36.784
Why are you insecured in life?

00:53:37.406 --> 00:53:38.895
Money?

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:43.646
Kasli vivanchana! (which account)

00:53:44.725 --> 00:53:54.284
The person who has God, who has got now the blessings of the Divine,

00:53:55.348 --> 00:53:58.248
what more does he want?

00:53:58.607 --> 00:54:02.375
Because your God is Almighty.

00:54:02.749 --> 00:54:06.720
Nobody’s might is greater than that of your Father’s.

00:54:06.927 --> 00:54:09.656
Nobody dare touch you on any point.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:21.868
But your faith is lacking and that’s why start with your faith in yourself.

00:54:22.678 --> 00:54:26.422
Make the faith sit in your Heart Chakra,

00:54:26.715 --> 00:54:30.866
and that faith is going to give you the joy of security.

00:54:31.787 --> 00:54:37.605
Faith is the answer for all the insecurities of the world.

00:54:58.687 --> 00:55:06.137
So now we come to the chakra of Vishuddhi.

00:55:08.748 --> 00:55:18.458
Vishuddhi Chakra can be divided into two is: here and Hamsa, there are two chakras.

00:55:21.078 --> 00:55:30.162
And Vishuddhi Chakra is, as you know, is the chakra of Viraat,

00:55:31.225 --> 00:55:34.946
where we have to seek ourselves in others.

00:55:35.407 --> 00:55:39.027
We have to seek our Atma in another person.

00:55:39.191 --> 00:55:41.731
We have to feel his Atma, we have to feel everybody’s Atma,

00:55:41.754 --> 00:55:46.517
we have to feel everyone else, we have to feel it.

00:55:48.048 --> 00:55:52.757
And how to do it, Krishna has taught us, is madhurya.

00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.050
Is the sweet… is the sweetness.

00:56:00.273 --> 00:56:04.028
Madhurya is the essence of sweet.

00:56:05.583 --> 00:56:12.147
Feel others with the sweetness of it that,
you are going to feel a flower; you are going to

00:56:12.377 --> 00:56:16.306
smell the fragrance of the other flower.

00:56:16.454 --> 00:56:19.118
Which has a different fragrance from yours.

00:56:19.237 --> 00:56:23.440
Feel that person with that sweetness as you feel the flower.

00:56:23.618 --> 00:56:27.858
How you catch the flower, how you smell it, how carefully

00:56:27.979 --> 00:56:32.912
you don’t even break a little of that so that you get the complete fragrance.

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:36.370
That fragrance you can only feel

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.307
if you have that sweetness, that mamadhuryaadhurya.

00:56:42.867 --> 00:56:47.155
And that sweetness of yours is so joy-giving.

00:56:47.370 --> 00:56:53.703
How you say things sweetly, how you express yourself sweetly.

00:56:54.274 --> 00:56:57.862
But in Marathi language, very difficult!

00:57:20.465 --> 00:57:23.786
I think the sharpness of tongue,

00:57:23.914 --> 00:57:27.644
the cutting nature of tongue, sarcasm,

00:57:27.745 --> 00:57:34.054
the so-called brilliance of expression,

00:57:34.228 --> 00:57:37.598
sometimes it is better to be with a buddhu (fool) than to be with such

00:57:37.654 --> 00:57:39.881
an intelligent man who is all the time “shap shap shap”,

00:57:39.963 --> 00:57:43.254
going on, hitting you, morning till evening.

00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:52.331
Then you say harsh things, then develop a guilt.

00:57:52.482 --> 00:57:57.692
Then you develop a guilt, then you have to say more harsh things.
It goes on.

00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:08.940
So this kind of a behaviour is because

00:58:09.161 --> 00:58:20.420
when we speak we do not have a sensitivity to feel another person.

00:58:20.662 --> 00:58:23.668
Put yourself in the same situation.

00:58:23.898 --> 00:58:27.689
How will you feel?

00:58:29.941 --> 00:58:41.452
So at the Vishuddhi level – madhurya, such a simple thing it is.

00:58:42.092 --> 00:58:43.182
Develop.

00:58:43.432 --> 00:58:45.125
You have to develop a method.

00:58:45.284 --> 00:58:48.236
Especially Maharashtrians must develop.

00:59:44.735 --> 00:59:51.957
The sweetness of your tongue, the sweetness of your talking, the sweetness of meeting people

00:59:53.083 --> 00:59:57.124
The whole the thing, you know, the sweetness itself gives you such a joy

00:59:57.284 --> 01:00:00.632
to meet such a people person who is so sweet and nice.

01:00:17.104 --> 01:00:18.924
Anybody who comes to your house must wear a shield.

01:00:38.506 --> 01:00:45.075
So, it is important that the language should be extremely sweet for a sahaja yogi.

01:00:45.168 --> 01:00:48.572
On that point they are going to judge you, I can tell you this much.

01:00:48.659 --> 01:00:51.716
Sharp-tongued people, nobody’s going to accept.
They’ll say, “He sahaja yogi ahe?

01:00:58.386 --> 01:01:03.938
The other antithesis of this is – in Marathi it’s better said is:

01:01:08.602 --> 01:01:12.620
Is that – even if you cut the throat with a hair, you won’t know the person has cut

01:01:12.663 --> 01:01:16.409
your throat and still he is talking to you so sweetly.

01:01:18.971 --> 01:01:26.939
These are two extremes, which are very dangerous for Sahaja Yoga and for sahaja yogis,

01:01:28.034 --> 01:01:38.439
the centre is very easy that when you speak to someone, say it with your heart.

01:01:41.246 --> 01:01:45.497
Say with the blessings of your Atma.

01:01:49.699 --> 01:01:53.228
Sometimes one has to say something sharp, it’s important.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:58.059
Specially for Me, which is a very hard task, but I have to use sometimes some very sharp

01:01:58.133 --> 01:02:01.352
language because nothing goes into the head sometimes.

01:02:01.797 --> 01:02:04.448
But you people better avoid it.

01:02:04.535 --> 01:02:09.767
You leave it to Me, because I am so good at this, that from one side

01:02:10.067 --> 01:02:14.713
I’ll say something, the other side immediately I know how to plaster you, properly.

01:02:14.821 --> 01:02:19.020
So you don’t try these tricks. You see.

01:02:19.912 --> 01:02:24.347
This is My style, which is a very difficult thing!

01:02:24.521 --> 01:02:30.114
I do say things, but they are hitakari (meaning: ‘which do benevolence’).

01:02:30.728 --> 01:02:39.153
If I even harsh with you sometimes, if I scold you sometimes, sometimes I have to be sharp,

01:02:39.476 --> 01:02:45.286
you know that I love you very much – that, I’ve established within you.

01:02:45.484 --> 01:02:51.264
First you establish your love in another person then say.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:59.805
This is the way you can overcome this problem of Vishuddhi

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:02.932
and how do you learn?

01:03:03.667 --> 01:03:05.438
Just by witnessing.

01:03:05.541 --> 01:03:08.309
Like two nice friends talking to each other.

01:03:08.455 --> 01:03:12.848
Just witness how they’re enjoying.

01:03:12.984 --> 01:03:16.096
Just witness the drama!

01:03:17.358 --> 01:03:19.854
You’ll pick it up in no time, just like that.

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:28.191
The sweetness will be flowing into you.

01:03:28.402 --> 01:03:40.442
Become so soft in your behaviour, in your countenance, in your faith

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:17.324
People should say that “You are a realised soul, I can see that.

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.932
” It should be so evident.

01:04:19.996 --> 01:04:24.038
So give up your last practices and habits.

01:04:24.606 --> 01:04:27.887
Try to be friendly with each other.

01:04:28.335 --> 01:04:33.555
Shri Krishna’s beauty was that He had friends… Gopas.

01:04:33.632 --> 01:04:39.521
And what was the quality of the Gopas compared to Shri Krishna? You see?

01:04:39.656 --> 01:04:43.030
But how He got friendly with them. Friendship.

01:04:43.728 --> 01:04:48.215
Friendship! Now, how I am to describe to you the friendship of it, you see?

01:04:51.473 --> 01:04:57.725
Marathi language has great words, which I think, which you cannot express in English.

01:04:57.901 --> 01:05:03.135
But in friendship you’ll find that enjoyment.

01:05:03.214 --> 01:05:06.852
But if you are not a witness, then what you will see?

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.419
In friendship it works both ways.

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:19.552
You’d never trouble each other but whenever there is difficulty,

01:05:19.631 --> 01:05:22.377
you can smell it, you can feel it.

01:05:23.123 --> 01:05:26.161
In Sahaja Yoga it has happened, miracles like this.

01:05:26.277 --> 01:05:31.491
One lady told Me, that she was in great difficulty once

01:05:31.722 --> 01:05:33.795
and she didn’t know what to do.

01:05:33.913 --> 01:05:37.324
And she just thought of somebody who was a sahaja yogi, she said,

01:05:37.376 --> 01:05:40.295
“Just now if you can come, my problem can be solved,”

01:05:40.359 --> 01:05:43.303
and there was a knock and he was at the door.

01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:45.872
And she opened the door and she was surprised,

01:05:45.983 --> 01:05:49.245
and he solved the problem. She said, “How are you here?”

01:05:49.356 --> 01:05:55.246
He said, “I don’t know why, you know the bus stopped here,
I felt like getting down and seeing you.

01:05:56.910 --> 01:06:03.094
So this samuhik chetana, this universality, you can feel it on your Vishuddhi Chakra.

01:06:03.873 --> 01:06:07.660
So that you become a part and parcel of the Viraat.

01:06:07.775 --> 01:06:13.970
Once you are fully part and parcel, all of you can feel each other.

01:06:14.117 --> 01:06:17.871
But without sweetness you cannot.

01:06:17.999 --> 01:06:22.678
Imagine the nose fighting the eyes and the mouth fights fighting the ears:

01:06:22.805 --> 01:06:24.896
what will happen to a person?

01:06:24.999 --> 01:06:27.049
Same is the condition of Viraat today.

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:29.893
Sometimes the ears are blowing, sometimes the head is blowing.

01:06:29.978 --> 01:06:35.718
The Viraat doesn’t know what to do, because you all are fighting with each other.

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:38.174
Think of something sweet.

01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:42.471
But in that universality is the point, not one person

01:06:47.152 --> 01:06:50.421
Because he was with me in the college is not there.

01:06:50.603 --> 01:06:55.094
Because you are born of the same Mother; you have the same Mother.

01:06:55.506 --> 01:06:58.306
Out of Her Sahastrara we are all born,

01:06:58.386 --> 01:07:03.489
that’s why we are all brothers and sisters of equal merit and credit.

01:07:03.682 --> 01:07:06.133
This is what one has to feel.

01:07:08.133 --> 01:07:13.225
So for Vishuddhi Chakra: universality through sweetness,

01:07:13.543 --> 01:07:16.415
the sweetness of relationships.

01:07:19.709 --> 01:07:25.221
Hamsa Chakra is a part of Vishuddhi Chakra on which I’ve spoken very little

01:07:25.796 --> 01:07:33.649
and which I would like to speak also later on, on a very, very bigger scale one day.

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:44.589
Is the Abstract, the Inner Current of all this Universe that is created,

01:07:45.045 --> 01:07:55.317
it’s Pranava itself which is so pure, complete purity within yourself, absolute purity.

01:07:55.595 --> 01:07:58.956
Nothing but vibrations.

01:08:02.193 --> 01:08:10.072
That is only possible through developing your vibratory awareness and your discrimination.

01:08:10.350 --> 01:08:15.735
Nothing but vibrations – your vibratory awareness is the only way you see, smell,

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:19.222
feel, everything through vibratory awareness.

01:08:23.804 --> 01:08:27.335
I have seen people behaving funnily in that also,

01:08:27.473 --> 01:08:30.983
like in everything they’ll say, “Let me see the vibration of this, let me see the vibration;

01:08:31.079 --> 01:08:32.817
let me see the vibration of that.

01:08:32.914 --> 01:08:36.735
” Then they’ll say, “Your vibrations are not all right.
His vibrations are not right.

01:08:36.917 --> 01:08:40.590
This is not the way to make fun of vibrations.

01:08:41.606 --> 01:08:47.587
A state must come when you don’t have to see vibration, just feel it!

01:08:50.882 --> 01:08:57.337
That should be the state, that sign [that] your pranava is full.

01:08:57.892 --> 01:09:01.864
I never feel anything, neither vibrations nor any chakras, nothing.

01:09:01.912 --> 01:09:05.819
I have to ask you, because for Me nothing catches!

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:10.721
Imagine such a gross person, nothing catches.

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:16.442
Nothing I can feel, where is the problem – I have to ask you,
“Baba, where is the problem of this gentleman?”

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.611
It is so bad.

01:09:20.384 --> 01:09:26.065
But only thing that happens is that anybody who comes before Me

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:31.193
just gets it, gets cured, and I’m nothing but vibrations.

01:09:33.917 --> 01:09:36.330
When you face Me, it just works.

01:09:36.330 --> 01:09:38.000
When I speak, it works.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.920
I don’t do anything, rationally I don’t understand.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.520
But these vibrations themselves, the energy goes, works it out, that works it out,

01:09:44.623 --> 01:09:46.051
that works it out.

01:09:46.136 --> 01:09:49.867
It works out all over, in the whole world.

01:09:49.955 --> 01:09:52.475
I do not consult It, I do not ask It.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.785
It’s working on Its own.

01:09:53.879 --> 01:09:55.977
If I want I will ask, otherwise I will not.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.481
If I don’t want to feel you, I will not feel you.

01:09:58.573 --> 01:10:01.823
There might be a rakshasa sitting next to Me, he might be shivering,

01:10:01.926 --> 01:10:03.845
but nothing will happen to Me.

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:10.137
I can stop his shivering if I want to, if I don’t want I will ask him to shiver.

01:10:10.829 --> 01:10:13.312
I am not bothered!

01:10:14.328 --> 01:10:24.196
Because when on vibrations the responsibility is there, on vibrations, which is My Light,

01:10:24.727 --> 01:10:26.068
I leave them alone.

01:10:26.187 --> 01:10:29.211
They are very well trained.They know everything.

01:10:29.345 --> 01:10:35.614
They are absolutely pure, as My name is, they are absolutely pure.

01:10:35.757 --> 01:10:38.315
I have no problem with them.

01:10:38.448 --> 01:10:42.365
I play here and there, that’s a different point.

01:10:42.606 --> 01:10:47.294
I try to cover them up sometimes,
I create a maya, it’s different, that’s another style.

01:10:47.434 --> 01:10:51.776
But as far as the vibrations are concerned, they are absolutely pure.

01:10:51.871 --> 01:10:54.038
That’s why they are so effective.

01:10:54.107 --> 01:10:57.096
So keep your vibrations pure.

01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:59.489
Without any intention.

01:11:09.927 --> 01:11:12.172
Just now as I was coming,

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:17.697
Modi was saying that “Mother, we pray to You
that let all the good people be elected for the election.

01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:21.448
’” I said, “As far as vibrations are concerned,

01:11:21.575 --> 01:11:26.067
let them go to this extent that they can create an atmosphere

01:11:26.464 --> 01:11:32.720
of understanding, but purification of vibrations is your job.

01:11:32.932 --> 01:11:39.117
” If you are negative people, if this country is filled
with negative people, they’ll get negative rulers.

01:11:39.297 --> 01:11:42.525
Then they will learn through and understand it and get out.

01:11:42.636 --> 01:11:44.778
So this is it.

01:11:49.613 --> 01:11:51.732
How far can they go?

01:11:51.915 --> 01:11:56.063
See they will act, do whatever it is possible for them.

01:11:56.158 --> 01:12:01.450
But it is your freedom which has to decide, so how it goes out.

01:12:03.299 --> 01:12:10.568
Then we come to Agnya Chakra, which is the Light Itself.

01:12:11.825 --> 01:12:21.493
That is the one that enlightens your attention. Agnya Chakra.

01:12:22.721 --> 01:12:31.127
That is the Light by which you see everything, after Realisation.

01:12:32.459 --> 01:12:41.422
And when you know you are the Light, and when you know that you are the Eternal Light,

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:44.460
that nothing can kill you,

01:12:48.505 --> 01:12:55.762
Once you know that in your Agnya

01:12:56.593 --> 01:13:01.273
then all the fears and domination disappear just like that.

01:13:05.683 --> 01:13:10.120
Because it is the Light of Love that does not dominate

01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:18.750
nor is afraid because it knows it is eternal,
it is not afraid of death or of crucifixion or of anything.

01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:34.149
So to allow the joy of Agnya to penetrate within you

01:13:35.157 --> 01:13:42.323
is to stabilise your Light.

01:13:43.849 --> 01:13:52.880
In that Light you will enjoy your sacrifice.

01:13:53.943 --> 01:13:57.177
Like the martyrs who kill themselves with joy.

01:13:57.328 --> 01:14:03.359
In the same way whatever trouble you have to put in for Sahaja Yoga
you will do it with joy.

01:14:03.557 --> 01:14:09.061
Anything that you have to face, any kind of sacrifice.

01:14:12.379 --> 01:14:17.197
Now the Sahaja Yogis are of a great understanding, have developed a lot,

01:14:17.309 --> 01:14:22.940
but in the beginning we had sahaja yogis – you don’t know what headaches I had with them.

01:14:23.567 --> 01:14:27.002
They used to say, “Mataji, we went there to talk to that man

01:14:27.106 --> 01:14:32.423
and we had to take some tea on the way, will you pay for that?”

01:14:40.725 --> 01:14:44.446
How much Mataji is going to pay for this and how much Mataji is going to pay for that

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:48.047
and how much She is going to look after us and how much money we are going to save out

01:14:48.106 --> 01:14:53.146
of this arrangement or that arrangement is calculated first of all.

01:14:55.003 --> 01:14:58.488
And by coming to Sahaja Yoga if you can become a leader,

01:14:58.551 --> 01:15:03.436
or if you can get elected, all these things were calculated.

01:15:04.214 --> 01:15:16.396
But you have to become the Light – the Light that never dies, which is above all the joys.

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:28.623
The Son who crucified Himself for the sake of His Mother’s work.

01:15:29.592 --> 01:15:40.887
Who carried the cross, in the presence of a Mother who was so powerful.

01:15:42.011 --> 01:15:50.910
Such children you have to be to carry the light.

01:15:51.066 --> 01:15:52.436
Sacrifice.

01:15:52.694 --> 01:15:55.651
The enjoyment of sacrifice.

01:15:57.226 --> 01:15:59.187
Otherwise…

01:16:02.463 --> 01:16:06.169
troubling your Mother for nothing at all.

01:16:08.782 --> 01:16:13.207
How much you can sacrifice – tana, mana, dhana.
(body, mind, wealth)

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:34.690
Sacrifice, for your emancipation, for your Light being kept alive.

01:16:35.993 --> 01:16:39.934
Early in the morning one has to get up at four o’clock –
it’s too much for a English people.

01:16:40.006 --> 01:16:41.490
That is the greatest sacrifice.

01:16:41.568 --> 01:16:43.410
You can tell them anything else.

01:16:43.455 --> 01:16:47.540
If you ask them they’ll give you £10, but don’t wake them up in the morning,

01:16:47.659 --> 01:16:50.423
because if they have to do dhyana in the morning is horrible, then

01:16:50.463 --> 01:16:54.264
if you ask them to take a bath, that’s the worst of all!

01:16:54.822 --> 01:16:59.676
To get up in the morning, have a bath and then do dhyana, is too much.

01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:03.532
But for Indians [Mother speaks in Marathi.

01:17:16.702 --> 01:17:19.354
Here Indians will get up – if you tell them four o’clock – [at] three o’clock,

01:17:19.453 --> 01:17:24.781
have their bath, four times they will have, sit down for dhyan, and all that they will do.

01:18:54.742 --> 01:18:55.862
Sacrifice, what all do we sacrifice – these stones, and this dust?

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:18.200
For what?
For the Eternal Life.

01:19:32.293 --> 01:19:34.238
It’s out of proportion you are going to get.

01:19:34.516 --> 01:19:40.926
This is not sacrifice, this is not even the slightest [fraction of]

01:19:43.465 --> 01:19:47.766
the value of what you are going to get.

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:51.116
Out of proportion it is.

01:19:51.551 --> 01:19:53.010
I don’t know how to tell.

01:19:53.152 --> 01:19:57.709
It’s out of proportion.

01:19:59.942 --> 01:20:04.378
But that proportion you can only see when you have Light.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:08.865
When the Light starts it goes to eternity.

01:20:09.810 --> 01:20:17.206
In the same way this Eternal Life encompasses the whole world,

01:20:17.309 --> 01:20:21.672
and you know the whole world within yourself.

01:20:22.907 --> 01:20:31.315
So the last chakra is of Sahastrara, the core of your heart,

01:20:33.092 --> 01:20:41.354
which is a very important centre because it is in the core of your heart.

01:20:41.453 --> 01:20:49.363
It’s surrounding your heart, and all the seven chakras have got their seats there.

01:20:50.507 --> 01:20:57.372
These are the seats which receive the joy and communicate to the heart.

01:21:06.434 --> 01:21:10.969
In Sahastrara, if you are there,

01:21:11.089 --> 01:21:13.485
already so many things you have got.

01:21:13.595 --> 01:21:18.990
You’ve got your vibrations, you’ve got your powers.

01:21:22.318 --> 01:21:27.066
But it’s the most tricky centre.

01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:31.018
It’s a Mahamaya.

01:21:31.121 --> 01:21:34.262
Kalki in a Mahamaya shape.

01:21:34.563 --> 01:21:38.280
Is a complete illusion.

01:21:46.825 --> 01:21:54.163
In the Sahastrara, the joy of Sahastrara

01:21:54.344 --> 01:21:59.100
is the joy of the entire thing, because all seven seats are there.

01:21:59.313 --> 01:22:06.159
If you can capture your Sahastrara, in complete recognition

01:22:06.636 --> 01:22:11.999
of this Mahamaya, complete recognition –

01:22:12.285 --> 01:22:16.531
which is a very difficult thing because always a maya is there –

01:22:17.837 --> 01:22:22.136
then, there’s nothing to talk about.

01:22:25.617 --> 01:22:29.718
Then see how your heart enlarges, see now.

01:22:31.591 --> 01:22:34.938
Just recognise.

01:22:40.308 --> 01:22:46.964
See the expansion of your heart, it will cover all your entire being, just recognise!

01:22:47.424 --> 01:22:50.604
That’s why we have puja here.

01:22:50.792 --> 01:22:54.268
I have allowed you to have My puja only for one reason,

01:22:54.338 --> 01:22:59.215
is that’s the only way you can recognise Me by seeing vibrations, by seeing chakras,

01:22:59.318 --> 01:23:03.165
by feeling them, by getting them more, by correcting yourself .

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:06.681
This is why I’ve agreed to have these pujas.

01:23:08.419 --> 01:23:13.650
But if you do not recognise, and do puja, it is useless for you, it’s very bad.

01:23:13.743 --> 01:23:15.547
Just recognise!
