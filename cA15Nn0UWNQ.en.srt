1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,330
Then this second center that we have, is very important,

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,630
which is called as the Swadisthana.

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,735
This center looks after physical

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,862
and our mental activities.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,240
Perhaps the doctors don’t know

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,416
that it has a very important work to do,

7
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:34,119
is that it has to nourish the brain

8
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:38,539
with new cells,

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,789
because all the time the brain is using

10
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,090
these cells for its activity.

11
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,690
So the energy has to go from this center,

12
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,179
up there you can see

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,049
and then it nourishes the center,

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,906
it nourishes the brain

15
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:01,239
through its activity.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,359
Now when we are very futuristic

17
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,143
or we are using too much of our brain, I should say,

18
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:08,250
too much of our brain activity we have,

19
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,854
we are futuristic, we are planning too much,

20
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:14,850
thinking too much, all the time 
thoughts and thoughts and thoughts,

21
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,280
that time we are using the energy of this center.

22
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:25,290
But this center has another very important thing to be done,

23
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,310
that it goes round, as you see,

24
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,250
it moves all round here

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,890
is shown here directly but it’s connected to the center

26
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:35,450
and it moves round and round and round,

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,590
and gives energy to this area

28
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,510
where we have our liver, our pancreas,

29
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,690
our spleen, kidney, and parts of intestines.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,759
Now if you start exhausting ourselves with too much thinking,

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,560
then the main work of this center suffers

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,710
and that’s how we develop all these diseases 
of all these organs:

33
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:05,619
like for example, with liver you develop a liver problem.

34
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,600
Liver problem means that liver has a function

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,799
to emit heat from your body, which is poison,

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,690
into the bloodstream.

37
00:02:17,891 --> 00:02:22,600
But when liver gets upset, we should say,

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,599
the heat is retained in the liver.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,187
It passes upward and downward.

40
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:30,559
When it passes upward it affects

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,201
a center there, as you can see, 
which we call as the right heart,

42
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:37,789
and people develop what we call 
the disease as asthma.

43
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,310
And when it passes downwards

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:42,499
it reaches the kidneys and coagulates

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,159
and you get kidney troubles,

46
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,811
for which we have to go on dialysis and ultimately to die.

47
00:02:50,012 --> 00:02:56,098
So this heat is created because our liver is out of gear.

48
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:59,069
At the same time this heat can also pass,

49
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,207
if a person, say, at a very young age drinks

50
00:03:02,408 --> 00:03:05,607
and puts in too much of physical efforts

51
00:03:05,807 --> 00:03:08,637
and is all the time busy thinking, thinking,

52
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:12,190
he might get a very fatal heart attack,

53
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,920
because this heat can go towards his heart

54
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,569
and just collapse it.

55
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,590
Also those people work very hard like that

56
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,203
can get a very massive heart attack.

57
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:25,619
But the people who have other problems,

58
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,536
on the left-hand side, are different type.

59
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:32,023
They are the people who have lethargic organs.

60
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,302
These organs do not work,

61
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:36,279
and when they do not work

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,450
then they have all the other problems

63
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,510
of the left side, as we call it;

64
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,289
and this also causes another serious problem

65
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,750
of psychosomatic troubles.

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,430
Now the essence of this center

67
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:53,737
is that it is creativity.

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,830
When the Kundalini nourishes this center,

69
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,030
people become extremely creative.

70
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,910
Now you have seen these artists who are playing here.

71
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,880
They were very simple, ordinary artists,

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,870
but after coming to Sahaja Yoga

73
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,210
suddenly they have bloomed so much.

74
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,760
The most surprising thing is that people,

75
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,890
say, even from Switzerland

76
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,080
who do not know a word of Sanskrit,

77
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,135
who do not know a word of Hindi language

78
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:23,770
have composed poems, they have put them to tunes,

79
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,550
and they sing as good as these people can sing.

80
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,449
It's impossible to believe that even the English

81
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,337
who were so difficult to even pronounce

82
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:36,050
one sentence in Hindi language,

83
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:40,250
are now fluently speaking Sanskrit 
and talking all these things;

84
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,276
because of this creativity improves you.

85
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:47,640
We have so many artists in India 
who came to Sahaja Yoga,

86
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,786
I don’t know if you know their names or not

87
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:53,040
like Amjad Ali, Jalota, so many of them.

88
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,562
They got their Realization

89
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:58,079
and after that, now today they are 
very well-known artists.

90
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,770
Also the paintings: we have some Australian people,

91
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,230
who became quite good artists,

92
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,150
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:11,879
So it gives you a sense of aesthetics,

94
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,030
and also it gives you the energy to express yourself.

95
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,698
Now if you have the technique of how to create anything

96
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:24,230
say you want to make a house or you want to paint,

97
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,865
or if you want to do something,

98
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:29,310
mouldings or anything that you want to do

99
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,430
if you have the technique,

100
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,230
the creativity, the power of creativity 
starts pouring in you,

101
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,043
and you start producing things

102
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:41,480
on which you cannot even have thought of,

103
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,650
and these things happen to a person.

104
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,249
So a person can become extremely dynamic with this.

105
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:51,880
But if with that you do not keep your 
Sahaja Yoga practice,

106
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,839
means if you do not keep your connection 
with the Divine,

107
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,390
then the energy gets exhausted.

108
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,190
That’s why Self-Realization is very important

109
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,960
for every artist,

110
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,710
that he should get his connection

111
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,730
with this All-pervading Power

112
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:11,470
which is the combination of all the powers,

113
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,370
so that he doesn’t feel exhausted with it.

114
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,845
Not only that, but all the time 
this source is flowing into him.

115
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:22,450
Constantly it has to flow, and that’s why 
you have to do

116
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,407
a little practice of Sahaja Yoga,

117
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:27,220
after getting your Realization, 
as I told you yesterday,

118
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,430
that now you don’t stop at this point,

119
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,690
you have to make the connection perfect.

120
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,413
Without the connection,

121
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,469
it may be that you may go down.

122
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,748
So it’s best is to keep your connection on 
and work it out,

123
00:06:41,949 --> 00:06:46,150
to give full respect to yourself,

124
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:48,049
to your being.

125
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:50,600
You are not an ordinary thing,

126
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,060
you are not a chicken or something like that.

127
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,679
You are a human being.

128
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,040
And the beauty that is within you 
is to be discovered,

129
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,773
is to be nourished

130
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:02,390
and to be proud of.

131
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,007
It is such a great thing you have within yourself,

132
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:08,159
the powers, which I’ll tell you one by one.
