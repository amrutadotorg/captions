WEBVTT

00:03.083 --> 00:07.208
Today we have gathered here

00:07.709 --> 00:11.250
to worship Shri Krishna,

00:12.709 --> 00:16.333
the one who was Virat,

00:18.458 --> 00:24.000
who fought all kinds of evil

00:27.166 --> 00:31.208
without entering into the arena.

00:32.417 --> 00:36.417
Shri Krishna’s life,

00:37.083 --> 00:43.333
it’s sense of is very ... a beautiful,

00:44.583 --> 00:52.083
creative and loving thing;

00:54.542 --> 01:00.166
but to understand Him, it is not easy.

01:02.083 --> 01:08.041
For example, in Kurukshetra,

01:09.208 --> 01:12.000
where the war was going on

01:12.667 --> 01:17.375
and Arjuna became depressed

01:19.166 --> 01:21.291
and he said that

01:21.667 --> 01:27.583
“Why should we fight, fight our own kith and kin,

01:28.375 --> 01:31.667
fight our own close relations,

01:32.208 --> 01:34.417
friends and our gurus?

01:36.542 --> 01:39.542
Is it religion? Is it dharma?”

01:41.041 --> 01:43.333
Before that, in Gita,

01:44.500 --> 01:48.667
Shri Krishna has described a personality

01:49.166 --> 01:52.709
which is a sage.

01:53.458 --> 01:57.709
We can call him a saint. Or He called it a sityapragya.

01:59.333 --> 02:05.125
So when asked what is the definition of the sityapragya,

02:05.500 --> 02:08.041
the description He gave was

02:08.625 --> 02:12.625
about a person  who is absolutely at peace with himself

02:13.333 --> 02:16.333
and at peace with his atmosphere.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.041
Is very surprising.

02:21.333 --> 02:25.542
All this knowledge He gave in the

02:26.542 --> 02:29.166
first place in Gita.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.583
That is — that is the best,

02:33.166 --> 02:35.625
that He called as the Gnyanamarga.

02:36.166 --> 02:41.166
That is Sahaj Yoga, by which you get the subtle knowledge.

02:44.625 --> 02:50.500
But at the same time, when you see Him advising Arjuna,

02:53.500 --> 03:00.083
it is very surprising that here he’s talking only of spirituality,

03:01.208 --> 03:04.667
of complete detachment

03:05.583 --> 03:11.166
and there He’s telling Arjuna  that “You go and fight.

03:13.166 --> 03:15.000
They are already dead people.

03:15.166 --> 03:16.542
Whom are you fighting?”

03:18.083 --> 03:24.125
This conflict is difficult to understand,

03:24.667 --> 03:28.542
that how could Shri Krishna, the same person

03:28.709 --> 03:33.458
who is preaching that ‘you all have to become sityapragya’,

03:34.041 --> 03:38.417
suddenly starts telling Arjuna

03:38.625 --> 03:41.417
that ‘you go and fight the force’.

03:44.291 --> 03:48.417
One side it is complete detachment

03:49.333 --> 03:51.709
and another side is the war.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.333
How will you explain this?

03:57.500 --> 04:00.291
Is Shri Krishna’s

04:02.083 --> 04:05.166
own words, one can say

04:06.375 --> 04:11.000
that “Once you are

04:11.625 --> 04:13.709
a Realised Soul

04:14.625 --> 04:19.333
and you have reached that highest position

04:20.041 --> 04:22.542
in your awareness,

04:23.208 --> 04:26.125
to you everything is futile.

04:27.417 --> 04:31.333
But just now, what you have to do

04:32.250 --> 04:35.667
is to save the dharma

04:38.375 --> 04:41.208
— not the dharma that people talk about.

04:41.583 --> 04:47.083
But the dharma  means evolutionary process of human beings,

04:48.083 --> 04:52.333
which is going on and if all the good people,

04:53.166 --> 04:56.250
those who stand for righteousness, are finished,

04:56.500 --> 05:01.625
then how will this evolutionary

05:02.458 --> 05:05.583
power will be saved?

05:06.625 --> 05:11.166
So you have to save them and for that, if you have to kill,

05:11.709 --> 05:14.291
you don’t kill anybody, they’re already dead

05:14.583 --> 05:16.667
because they’re not evolved souls

05:17.125 --> 05:19.709
and they don’t care for their Realisation.

05:23.333 --> 05:28.208
So you have to fight them. You have to fight the negative forces.

05:29.417 --> 05:32.208
You have to fight the wrongdoers”.

05:32.500 --> 05:36.000
All this He explains

05:36.417 --> 05:38.709
in a very beautiful manner,

05:40.166 --> 05:44.542
that we have within us

05:47.375 --> 05:51.041
three kinds of powers, which we also know,

05:53.417 --> 05:58.542
and by the middle one that we have,

05:59.375 --> 06:06.333
we rise above all these material,

06:07.166 --> 06:10.458
physical, mental, emotional

06:11.333 --> 06:13.709
— all these problems facing us

06:14.250 --> 06:18.667
into a new realm of spirituality.

06:20.625 --> 06:24.291
And that’s what He wanted – to save

06:26.125 --> 06:29.417
from the cruel people, from the aggressive,

06:30.291 --> 06:33.667
who were also misleading others.

06:35.333 --> 06:39.125
It’s a very good understanding,

06:40.250 --> 06:44.500
if you have, that who is your relation,

06:46.208 --> 06:49.583
who is your brother, who is your sister?

06:50.709 --> 06:55.709
Those who are evolved souls are your relations.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.375
They are your own

06:59.083 --> 07:02.417
and, for them, if you have to fight the people

07:02.709 --> 07:05.291
who are aggressive people, you better do it.

07:05.583 --> 07:10.083
You have to do it. That is the way of dharma.

07:12.417 --> 07:18.458
So we have three paths, as you know, in Sahaja Yoga.

07:20.291 --> 07:23.125
The one is of bhakti.

07:23.625 --> 07:28.166
Bhakti is where you sing the praise of God,

07:28.458 --> 07:32.709
have devotion, do all kinds of rituals, everything

07:33.625 --> 07:38.125
and you think that you are very close to God.

07:41.041 --> 07:45.041
This is one which is being accepted

07:45.250 --> 07:49.583
by many, many people and by many so-called religions,

07:51.166 --> 07:54.709
that we must have complete dedication for God.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.709
How did — you are not yet connected to God.

07:59.458 --> 08:03.709
How, what are you doing? How can you have any dedication to God,

08:04.417 --> 08:07.625
with whom you are not at all connected?

08:11.083 --> 08:15.583
The second one was the karma,

08:17.166 --> 08:19.709
that you do your work.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.709
You go on doing your work

08:23.166 --> 08:25.500
with a detached mind. I mean it’s not possible,

08:26.291 --> 08:30.500
but that’s what they say and we are doing our karmas,

08:31.083 --> 08:35.083
good karmas, we do all kinds of good things,

08:35.542 --> 08:40.542
go to various places for our cleansing,

08:41.166 --> 08:46.041
meet many great people of spirituality,

08:47.125 --> 08:52.333
go to all various places and pray.

08:53.709 --> 08:58.500
Visit all auspicious places which are being described.

08:59.417 --> 09:03.083
All kinds of rituals, we do for that.

09:03.417 --> 09:06.125
That is the karma yoga.

09:06.542 --> 09:10.583
And that is what the karma yoga, according to us, is the right side.

09:12.291 --> 09:15.583
Many people, as you know, are right-sided.

09:17.208 --> 09:22.709
Right-sided people are the people who are, as you know,

09:23.333 --> 09:26.125
full of ego, arrogance

09:26.542 --> 09:30.625
and think  no end of themselves, very difficult to correct them.

09:31.458 --> 09:34.125
They also never see anything wrong with them.

09:34.542 --> 09:38.250
Whichever way they act, they think is all right.

09:39.333 --> 09:42.542
That is the karma yoga,

09:43.291 --> 09:48.041
but He has said that

09:49.083 --> 09:51.583
whatever karmas you do,

09:53.125 --> 09:57.667
whatever its fruits are, that you cannot say.

09:59.417 --> 10:03.041
He said it in a very uncertain manner

10:04.542 --> 10:09.542
because definitely, if He had said it with certainty,

10:10.458 --> 10:13.083
people would never have understood Him.

10:13.500 --> 10:18.417
So He said it is not possible that whatever karmas you are doing

10:19.625 --> 10:22.375
could be the karmas

10:22.625 --> 10:26.625
which will get you the blessings of the Divine....

10:28.375 --> 10:32.542
(MARATHI)... He has said it.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.500
So then, which karmas we should do?

10:37.417 --> 10:39.583
Or should we give up all the karmas?

10:40.291 --> 10:42.458
All the action, we should give up?

10:43.208 --> 10:46.583
People were in two minds.

10:47.083 --> 10:52.125
This is the style of Shri Krishna, is to put people in two minds

10:52.458 --> 10:55.041
so they use their discretion.

10:55.458 --> 11:01.458
And third one is the discretion, which He calls as the Gnyanamarg,

11:02.625 --> 11:06.500
is the central path, by which you evolve.

11:07.291 --> 11:09.667
You evolve into a new state,

11:10.375 --> 11:14.667
into a new state of your mind, a new state of your being,

11:15.333 --> 11:20.291
by which you become

11:23.542 --> 11:27.667
absolutely above every nonsense.

11:28.583 --> 11:34.291
Also you are endowed with power to fight whatever is bad,

11:34.625 --> 11:40.041
whatever is corrupting, whatever is killing this one.

11:42.125 --> 11:48.291
At that stage, you are equipped with a  divine power

11:49.041 --> 11:54.041
that you can finish off anything that is negative around you.

11:57.542 --> 12:03.000
This is to be understood that that’s a state.

12:03.583 --> 12:08.709
That’s not just talking. That’s not just believing that I am that,

12:09.333 --> 12:14.667
but it’s a state. If you come up to that state

12:15.291 --> 12:18.041
where you are beyond all these things

12:19.083 --> 12:23.166
and you have all the knowledge, pure knowledge,

12:23.375 --> 12:27.583
the subtle knowledge of being, this is the Gnyanamarg.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.291
Many people say that

12:32.625 --> 12:36.083
everybody cannot go to Gnyanamarg and, for that, you have to have a

12:36.333 --> 12:38.625
special type of personality,

12:40.709 --> 12:43.333
but this is very misleading.

12:43.709 --> 12:47.291
Everyone can go into Gyanamarg.

12:48.041 --> 12:52.417
It is very, very innately built within us,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.250
this evolutionary attention, attainment.

12:56.709 --> 13:00.375
It is within us and all of us can have that.

13:01.375 --> 13:06.542
Only thing is we have no confidence perhaps

13:07.417 --> 13:10.208
that we go on avoiding it

13:10.542 --> 13:16.417
and go to cheaper things like becoming devoted to something,

13:16.667 --> 13:22.125
doing some sort of a ritual, going to some sort of a holy place,

13:22.375 --> 13:27.417
all kinds of nonsense, which doesn’t give you the evolutionary

13:28.166 --> 13:35.667
ascent by which you know the knowledge,

13:36.125 --> 13:38.583
the pure  knowledge, the real  knowledge.

13:41.291 --> 13:44.625
So far, whatever you have known was written in the book,

13:45.208 --> 13:47.417
whatever your parents told you,

13:47.709 --> 13:50.583
or whatever you have explored outside.

13:51.375 --> 13:55.417
But the knowledge which is the purest,

13:56.000 --> 13:59.417
which is the real knowledge,

14:00.583 --> 14:07.250
which is the gnyana, that you can only get through your ascent

14:07.542 --> 14:14.083
and establish in yourself properly in that state.

14:15.083 --> 14:18.041
If you go on denying it, you cannot make out.

14:18.375 --> 14:23.208
But everyone has right to get it. You need not be educated,

14:24.208 --> 14:27.083
you need not be a very simple person,

14:27.417 --> 14:30.083
you need not be very rich or poor,

14:30.250 --> 14:34.333
makes no difference,  as long as you are a human being

14:34.667 --> 14:37.000
and a humble human being,

14:37.291 --> 14:41.083
thinking that you have to achieve that state.

14:41.709 --> 14:45.458
You all can get that state, which you know very well.

14:47.083 --> 14:52.709
And at that state you become absolutely knowledgeable,

14:54.125 --> 14:57.625
knowledgeable about yourself, knowledgeable about others,

14:58.250 --> 15:01.625
knowledgeable about everything that goes around.

15:02.667 --> 15:08.500
But this state must be maintained and try to go above that state

15:09.709 --> 15:12.667
where you have no more doubts left in you.

15:13.709 --> 15:16.250
This is what Shri Krishna taught

15:17.125 --> 15:19.625
and this is what one has to achieve,

15:20.333 --> 15:24.083
but He, being a diplomat, He tried to

15:24.291 --> 15:29.291
tell you other stories. “Try this, try that, this, that.”

15:30.709 --> 15:35.208
But actually what He has praised is gnyanamarg.

15:36.458 --> 15:40.500
Ours is a gnyanamarg. That is the knowledge,

15:41.250 --> 15:45.291
the path of knowledge in which you have to know all the knowledge.

15:46.333 --> 15:49.667
Unless and until you have the whole knowledge,

15:51.041 --> 15:55.041
you are not yet a gnyani, a person who knows.

15:56.208 --> 16:01.542
In this way, He has established that our evolutionary process

16:02.333 --> 16:09.709
has to come beyond all other human awareness.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.542
Other human awareness

16:13.208 --> 16:17.625
is of a no value for a special  personality.

16:19.125 --> 16:23.500
Now he knows something, say, ‘how many miles it is

16:23.667 --> 16:28.500
from here say to New York or what trains go there’.

16:29.208 --> 16:31.583
All this knowledge is not real

16:32.583 --> 16:37.250
— ‘how much this cloth will cost, how much this carpet will cost,

16:37.500 --> 16:40.166
in what shop you can get. All this knowledge

16:40.417 --> 16:44.000
is just useless, is not the real knowledge.

16:46.542 --> 16:51.250
Such a person doesn’t know this kind of knowledge,

16:52.041 --> 16:56.667
but what he knows is the knowledge about your being,

16:58.041 --> 17:01.208
knowledge about the whole universe,

17:02.166 --> 17:07.208
which is not how many stars there are

17:08.041 --> 17:12.500
or how many universes there are. No

17:14.041 --> 17:16.709
it is the subtle inner

17:18.291 --> 17:21.542
personality of everything, he knows.

17:22.625 --> 17:28.333
In that subtlety, he discovers  so many new things

17:28.709 --> 17:31.166
which he may not even heard about,

17:31.667 --> 17:38.333
and, thus you reach a state of great knowledgeable personality.

17:39.542 --> 17:44.625
This is what we have to achieve. We are born as human beings

17:46.041 --> 17:49.125
and we know so many things already.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.083
People know so many things, but they don’t know the actual.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.458
This knowledge doesn’t come

17:57.000 --> 18:00.000
through your reading or through your

18:00.291 --> 18:04.166
intellectual pursuit or for your emotional movement — no.

18:05.375 --> 18:12.041
It is shaswat.  It is all the time there.

18:13.083 --> 18:15.667
It exists. It will exist.

18:16.458 --> 18:22.125
And it is just to be understood, just to be

18:22.625 --> 18:25.583
known to yourself what it is.

18:26.542 --> 18:31.041
It cannot change. It cannot be remoulded.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.041
It is what it is.

18:37.709 --> 18:40.625
And that is what you know now.

18:41.667 --> 18:44.208
Nobody would doubt that

18:45.667 --> 18:50.291
because those who have got this state, they may doubt,

18:51.083 --> 18:53.667
they may call you crazy, they may think anything,

18:54.333 --> 18:57.625
but with the open eyes, whatever you say (is) the truth.

18:58.417 --> 19:02.583
In the same way, with the open heart and a open brain, when you

19:03.250 --> 19:05.625
know that, that is the real truth

19:06.125 --> 19:09.166
and that is what is to be known.

19:10.166 --> 19:13.583
For that, according to Shri Krishna,

19:14.375 --> 19:20.208
you have to go through various tests.

19:20.709 --> 19:25.500
One is you go on praying to Him.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.709
He says, “You go on praying to Me

19:31.208 --> 19:35.083
and if you give Me flowers I’ll take. If you give Me water I’ll take

19:36.208 --> 19:39.291
Whatever you’ll give Me, I’ll take.”

19:40.458 --> 19:44.208
He says clearly, but

19:47.125 --> 19:53.166
what will you make out of that is very important.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.500
He doesn’t say,

19:55.709 --> 19:59.000
“If you give Me something, I’ll give you something.” That 's it.

20:00.500 --> 20:05.625
So what should be the state?

20:06.500 --> 20:10.375
What should be the condition? He said,

20:11.166 --> 20:13.667
“If you praise Me, if you do bhakti for Me,

20:14.125 --> 20:17.417
you are giving Me presents, you are doing all sorts of things,

20:18.250 --> 20:20.458
you are very dedicated, but

20:22.417 --> 20:28.000
you should do ananyabhakti. Word is ananya.

20:28.667 --> 20:31.375
Ananya means when there is not the other,

20:33.542 --> 20:38.250
when we are one, when we are connected,

20:39.542 --> 20:43.041
then the bhakti you do that time,

20:43.250 --> 20:46.125
whatever music you have of devotion,

20:46.375 --> 20:48.458
whatever flowers you give,

20:48.709 --> 20:51.375
whatever expression you have,

20:52.041 --> 20:53.625
it should be ananya”.

20:54.083 --> 20:57.041
That’s the word He said, that “Do ananya bhakti....

20:59.125 --> 21:03.125
(MARATHI) ...whatever you give Me,  I’ll take”.

21:04.166 --> 21:08.500
He’ll take everything. He’s the one who is the only,

21:09.041 --> 21:11.417
Gopta means He is the only enjoyer.

21:12.041 --> 21:15.166
“But what will you get,”

21:16.458 --> 21:21.041
He says, “when you do ananyabhakti?”

21:22.041 --> 21:24.250
Means ‘when you are one with Me.’

21:25.375 --> 21:28.500
That means you are connected with Him.

21:29.291 --> 21:35.333
That’s how He has explained bhakti, what is bhakti is very clearly.

21:35.583 --> 21:37.583
But people don’t understand.

21:38.083 --> 21:41.208
They think that bhakti means you go on singing

21:41.375 --> 21:45.417
“Hari Rama, Hari Krishna,” this and that, is bhakti. Is not.

21:46.667 --> 21:49.250
If that was real, they would have achieved something,

21:49.375 --> 21:52.667
but they did not. Now don’t blame Krishna for that.

21:53.375 --> 21:57.709
He has clearly said it should be ananyabhakti.

21:58.333 --> 22:02.291
Only by changing your dress, wearing a particular

22:02.583 --> 22:07.375
type of style, that’s not it. That’s all so outward.

22:08.041 --> 22:15.083
It’s just to show off, but actually ananyabhakti is within yourself

22:15.458 --> 22:19.625
when you are within that state when you are one with the Divine.

22:20.417 --> 22:24.542
Unless and until that state you have achieved, not only that,

22:25.083 --> 22:29.166
but have established, it doesn’t give you anything.

22:30.041 --> 22:33.291
Many people have told Me, “We are doing so much

22:33.583 --> 22:36.667
of bhakti yog, Mother. We don’t get anything.”

22:37.291 --> 22:40.041
“Really, what sort of bhakti yog?”

22:40.542 --> 22:44.625
We do — read Shri Krishna’s Gita.

22:45.083 --> 22:50.333
Every morning (we) get up at four o’clock, take bath, read Krishna’s

22:51.709 --> 22:55.458
Gita, do this, do that.Then we sing bhajans, this.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.667
We never get anything.

23:00.458 --> 23:05.500
So what is the reason?”

23:06.500 --> 23:10.542
Reason is that you are not one with God.

23:12.083 --> 23:17.500
And when you are one with God, then what does He give you?

23:19.458 --> 23:26.291
He won’t give you cheap things which will vanish in no time,

23:27.250 --> 23:31.542
but of some eternal nature. So He gives  you

23:33.125 --> 23:37.709
peace, peace of the heart.He gives you balance.

23:39.250 --> 23:45.583
Also He gives you a tranquil temperament,

23:48.166 --> 23:55.667
joy of life. All these things are there within us

23:56.500 --> 24:03.333
if we have the bhakti which is after being united,

24:04.208 --> 24:08.041
after the yoga, with the Yogeshwara.

24:10.208 --> 24:16.333
This is what one has to understand.Now, there are many karma yogis

24:17.375 --> 24:20.667
who go on working mad, absolute madly.

24:21.667 --> 24:24.625
They think we are doing, after all,

24:25.375 --> 24:31.458
without any desire we are serving people,

24:32.083 --> 24:35.625
we are serving the nation, we are serving this.

24:36.667 --> 24:39.375
Ultimately, what do you get?

24:41.542 --> 24:45.083
What you get may be money. Might be you might

24:45.291 --> 24:48.333
get a good house, maybe all these things,

24:49.500 --> 24:52.208
but you don’t get peace of heart.

24:53.083 --> 24:57.500
You don’t get peace of mind. You don’t get that joy,

24:58.417 --> 25:04.583
that joy which has no boundaries, which cannot be explained,

25:06.208 --> 25:09.417
which cannot be described,

25:10.458 --> 25:14.208
that boundless joy, you don’t have.

25:15.583 --> 25:20.125
And you don’t get that eternal peace,

25:21.208 --> 25:23.291
which can stop wars.

25:25.041 --> 25:28.333
Completely, it can abolish this

25:28.709 --> 25:31.709
cruel nature of human beings.

25:32.667 --> 25:37.083
That you don’t get.  But apart from that,

25:37.667 --> 25:41.375
you get the powers.

25:42.583 --> 25:45.041
You get the knowledge —

25:45.291 --> 25:48.542
knowledge, the subtle knowledge about everyone.

25:49.583 --> 25:54.291
You know about everyone, where are they missing the point.

25:56.083 --> 25:59.166
You know about yourself and about others.

26:00.208 --> 26:05.166
This knowledge you get, not in the college or in the schools,

26:06.000 --> 26:09.667
but within yourself is the ocean of knowledge

26:10.583 --> 26:15.583
and whichever way you want to see, whichever you want to achieve,

26:16.375 --> 26:19.709
is there, there present.

26:21.041 --> 26:25.542
That is what is the real knowledge, what we call

26:26.417 --> 26:28.667
that you achieve through the

26:29.458 --> 26:32.625
sukshagnyana means the subtle knowledge,

26:33.291 --> 26:37.333
knowledge about chakras, knowledge

26:37.542 --> 26:42.041
about the universe. Everything you can get out of this.

26:42.333 --> 26:48.208
But then you get more interested in giving knowledge to others.

26:49.250 --> 26:51.625
You don’t want to know so many thing then.

26:52.333 --> 26:56.625
What is the need to know about banking,

26:57.166 --> 27:02.250
say, about who is the richest man in the whole world?

27:02.583 --> 27:07.709
All these things you don’t want to know. Your whole attitude changes

27:08.458 --> 27:14.542
and what you get is nothing but a kind of a tranquil mind

27:15.208 --> 27:18.542
which knows everything that is to be known..

27:20.375 --> 27:22.709
That is what one has to achieve

27:23.542 --> 27:28.458
Now this country of yours, America, is very kharmakandi.

27:29.709 --> 27:33.500
It goes on doing work, work, work. They’re workaholics.

27:34.583 --> 27:37.542
They work so hard and what do you get?

27:39.250 --> 27:41.709
You get children who are drug addicts.

27:42.500 --> 27:45.250
You get wives who are running here and there.

27:45.625 --> 27:51.291
You get broken families and no peace.

27:53.041 --> 27:55.375
You support wars.

27:56.458 --> 28:03.500
Only thing is that so far this country is being protected in a way,

28:04.709 --> 28:09.208
but also you have destroyed so many aboriginals,

28:10.125 --> 28:14.500
so many fundamental things that you should have preserved.

28:15.709 --> 28:18.500
A day may come when they will realise

28:19.083 --> 28:23.125
that this is what they have been doing and this was really wrong.

28:23.583 --> 28:29.667
A day will come when we’ll have so many Realised Souls in America.

28:31.375 --> 28:37.709
But just now the situation is (that) the people are just gone

28:39.125 --> 28:42.709
mad with the idea of making money

28:44.291 --> 28:47.375
and they discover that ‘Now no more, finished.

28:49.208 --> 28:55.083
So now what to do?’ What to do? Come to Sahaja Yoga.

28:57.250 --> 29:03.333
Do Sahaj Yoga and then you will get the treasures of your being

29:04.291 --> 29:09.125
which are within you, which will give you all the comfort,

29:09.542 --> 29:15.625
all the joy and all the supremacy that any

29:16.709 --> 29:20.333
amount of money, any amount of power can’t give.

29:21.500 --> 29:24.041
This is what we have to do,

29:24.542 --> 29:29.208
is to take to Sahaja Yoga and make others also Sahaja Yogis

29:29.625 --> 29:34.542
so that they also get that peace, joy and satisfaction;

29:35.709 --> 29:39.583
and this madness of running from one thing to another

29:40.041 --> 29:45.083
will be finished because you can never be satisfied with that.

29:45.709 --> 29:49.458
Want to buy today one thing, then tomorrow want another thing,

29:50.041 --> 29:53.583
then want to doing another thing. You are never satisfied.

29:54.500 --> 29:58.166
You don’t get any joy out of what you are desiring.

29:58.667 --> 30:04.041
So your pure desire, it should be to be one with the Divine.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.250
That is how it will work out.

30:09.125 --> 30:12.083
Shri Krishna’s specialty was that

30:14.000 --> 30:17.709
He always supported people who were Realised Souls,

30:18.250 --> 30:22.208
who were on the right path, who were doing righteous things.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.709
He would never support anybody

30:26.291 --> 30:30.291
who may be well off, who may be great thing.

30:30.709 --> 30:33.583
Like a great king was Duryodhana.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.625
He invited Shri Krishna to his house,

30:39.542 --> 30:44.333
to his big palace to be his guest.

30:45.500 --> 30:51.417
Shri Krishna said, “I am sorry.” He went to Vidura,

30:51.583 --> 30:58.583
who was the son of a maid, Dasaputra,

31:00.208 --> 31:06.500
because Vidura was a Realised Soul. Because he was a Realised Soul,

31:07.083 --> 31:11.125
to Him he was much higher, much greater

31:11.333 --> 31:14.709
than Duryodhana – who was a ruler because he was a crook,

31:15.375 --> 31:17.458
because he was a bad man.

31:18.375 --> 31:22.333
So the discrimination between good and bad

31:23.250 --> 31:26.000
becomes one in your mind,

31:26.375 --> 31:32.500
becomes one of your inner temperament,

31:34.166 --> 31:37.208
then you are always very much satisfied

31:38.208 --> 31:42.417
because you know you are not been doing

31:43.166 --> 31:45.458
something that is wrong.

31:46.625 --> 31:50.709
The discrimination is the gift of Shri Krishna.

31:52.333 --> 31:58.083
Apart from anything else, He gives us the gift of discrimination.

31:59.583 --> 32:06.417
That is His style, I should say, to teach you how to discriminate

32:07.041 --> 32:12.083
and then you become experts on discrimination, on vibrations.

32:13.542 --> 32:18.166
On vibrations, you can judge everything so clearly,

32:19.083 --> 32:22.166
so beautifully.  Others may not agree with you,

32:22.333 --> 32:24.709
that’s a different point; but you know

32:25.083 --> 32:26.709
what is right and what is wrong.

32:28.041 --> 32:31.250
And that is what Shri Krishna’s gift is.

32:32.041 --> 32:37.250
As it is, you know He is controlling sixteen sub-chakras within us.

32:38.166 --> 32:44.208
He controls everything. He controls your throat, nose, eyes, ears.

32:46.625 --> 32:51.709
All these things He controls, but ultimately, what does He say?

32:54.667 --> 33:00.250
He says He is the Virat. Virat means the one who is the great,

33:00.667 --> 33:05.291
great lord,

33:07.625 --> 33:12.542
what we call “akbar” and that’s what in the Muslim

33:13.542 --> 33:17.250
thing  they accept that Allahu Akbar.

33:17.542 --> 33:20.375
I mean, because it is in a poetry, it’s partly

33:20.709 --> 33:25.333
clear, partly not clear, but He was a Virata

33:26.041 --> 33:29.625
and He showed His form to Arjuna

33:30.583 --> 33:36.250
and Arjuna was amazed to see His form, that He’s the Virata.

33:37.083 --> 33:42.500
He’s the one who is great, absorbing everything

33:43.125 --> 33:46.500
and He’s the one who is taking out everything.

33:47.166 --> 33:53.208
He’s a Yama. He is the one who is the god of death.

33:54.291 --> 33:58.667
He’s so many. You know His names are there written down.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.250
All these powers are with you,

34:02.709 --> 34:07.041
which He uses wherever it is needed.

34:08.166 --> 34:12.166
So the Sahaja Yogis first have the power of satisfaction.

34:12.625 --> 34:14.625
It’s tremendous practice, satisfaction.

34:15.166 --> 34:17.583
Imagine in this place,

34:18.125 --> 34:22.291
you are all enjoying so much, you are living here so happy.

34:22.667 --> 34:25.166
Shows what? You are so satisfied.

34:25.542 --> 34:27.208
Otherwise nobody would like.

34:27.417 --> 34:30.625
They would say, “No, we want some nice place. What is this?

34:31.083 --> 34:35.166
We don’t want to live here with everyone.” But to live with others,

34:35.291 --> 34:39.583
this collectivity also is the blessing of Shri Krishna.

34:40.709 --> 34:45.291
He teaches you to be collective, the fun of collectivity,

34:45.542 --> 34:49.709
the enjoyment of collectivity. A person who is secluded,

34:50.291 --> 34:52.625
who keeps himself off like a drunkard

34:53.083 --> 34:56.041
is not  the one who worships Shri Krishna.

34:56.291 --> 35:00.291
The one who is one with Shri Krishna enjoys everyone

35:01.125 --> 35:05.125
who are there, specially if they are all Realised Souls,

35:05.417 --> 35:08.291
that person enjoys their company very much.

35:08.709 --> 35:13.417
That is something so easily understood in your lives

35:13.625 --> 35:17.542
if you see how you live happily, morally,

35:18.083 --> 35:23.041
absolutely perfect; in no way you do anything immoral

35:23.333 --> 35:29.208
steal anything or have bad feelings for other people.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.208
It’s something surprising that has happened to you,

35:32.417 --> 35:34.709
that you are all living so happily

35:35.458 --> 35:39.583
in one place together with satya.

35:41.417 --> 35:45.291
His collectivity is to be understood

35:45.542 --> 35:48.208
because I always say

35:48.375 --> 35:51.375
that Shri Krishna is the deity of America.

35:52.458 --> 35:55.166
America is also very collective.

35:55.417 --> 35:58.709
Like it will be interested in every country.

35:59.333 --> 36:01.667
It will be bothered about everyone,

36:02.250 --> 36:04.500
but in a wrong way tries to help.

36:05.125 --> 36:08.291
Always it is never in the right way.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.208
Now, supposing there is a country where

36:11.333 --> 36:13.500
they are producing a lot of drugs.

36:13.709 --> 36:17.625
Why not invade that country, instead of invading other countries.

36:18.667 --> 36:22.041
He’s like that. Discrimination is missing.

36:22.625 --> 36:25.125
Unless and until you have that,

36:25.333 --> 36:28.458
you cannot use your power of collectivity properly.

36:29.208 --> 36:32.542
Though they are collective, but what collective work have they done?

36:33.125 --> 36:36.500
Even now, they want to say they are separate, they are different.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.333
“Whatever problems we are facing are our own.”

36:40.375 --> 36:45.417
So this collectivity has been so much minimised

36:45.709 --> 36:48.458
in a country of Shri Krishna itself.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.125
Though they have that within themselves,

36:52.417 --> 36:56.208
a feeling that they should talk about every country,

36:56.458 --> 36:59.125
they should give lead to every country,

36:59.375 --> 37:02.083
they should consult every country, but

37:02.375 --> 37:07.125
always take a wrong decision about those countries.

37:07.458 --> 37:11.041
This comes because they are not discriminating.

37:11.542 --> 37:14.041
They should be discriminating.

37:14.375 --> 37:18.667
So many things can be said about Vishuddhi chakra,

37:19.542 --> 37:25.667
but specially I am more concerned about two chakras on two sides.

37:26.125 --> 37:30.291
One of them is, as you know, is the Lalita chakra on left side

37:30.500 --> 37:33.000
and Shri chakra on the right side.

37:33.625 --> 37:36.166
I’ve always told ladies that

37:36.417 --> 37:38.542
please keep this covered.

37:39.041 --> 37:42.083
It looks so simple. It’s very important.

37:42.667 --> 37:48.417
Don’t expose this because power of this should be preserved —

37:49.166 --> 37:54.208
Shri chakra and Lalita chakra, they’re very important.

37:55.125 --> 37:57.583
They are, I should say, feminine powers

37:58.417 --> 38:02.375
and they are the feminine powers of Shri Krishna,

38:03.417 --> 38:08.709
which must be understood that whatever way you respect your body,

38:09.208 --> 38:13.667
that is the way your chakras are and that is the way you suffer.

38:14.583 --> 38:18.667
For example, (if) you do not respect Shri Ganesha, you will suffer.

38:21.333 --> 38:24.375
And if you respect Ganesha and do not behave in a manner

38:24.542 --> 38:28.333
that you should behave, you will suffer. You’ll have problems.

38:28.709 --> 38:31.500
So the whole body reacts.

38:32.667 --> 38:40.125
Body reacts to outside influences in such a manner

38:40.709 --> 38:43.542
that you start seeing there is something wrong

38:45.291 --> 38:49.250
somewhere and that’s why you behave like this.

38:55.458 --> 39:02.083
Apart from that, eyes are supplied by this chakra,

39:04.166 --> 39:11.375
so when you look at something, it should be very pure glance.

39:12.125 --> 39:15.583
The purer it is, the better you will enjoy.

39:16.458 --> 39:20.583
But if the glance is not pure,

39:21.458 --> 39:26.583
is shifty, going from here to there, there to there,

39:28.166 --> 39:34.542
then you are actually going against your dharma,

39:35.000 --> 39:39.041
against your evolutionary process and one day will come

39:39.250 --> 39:43.500
when you might become blind, you might develop cataracts.

39:44.000 --> 39:47.291
You might develop all kinds of diseases of the eyes,

39:49.250 --> 39:53.208
which are very important to pay attention to it.

39:54.250 --> 39:59.291
Then this connect(ion) also goes to the tongue.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.125
The tongue is looked after,

40:04.667 --> 40:07.166
but those people have a very bad habit

40:07.417 --> 40:12.417
of suddenly saying horrible things, of suddenly saying

40:13.041 --> 40:18.333
very bad words or sometimes getting after somebody

40:18.542 --> 40:21.166
with the very bad remarks.

40:21.500 --> 40:24.709
All such things are very bad for the tongue

40:25.417 --> 40:28.000
and this is what Shri Krishna doesn’t like.

40:28.583 --> 40:33.083
In case you use your tongue for saying harsh things to others,

40:33.291 --> 40:39.333
being sarcastic, being harsh on others,

40:40.125 --> 40:42.417
using abusive word,

40:43.291 --> 40:48.583
your tongue, one day, I don’t know how it will react.

40:50.291 --> 40:52.417
It will react in different ways.

40:53.041 --> 40:55.667
God knows, it might become thick. It won’t move.

40:56.333 --> 40:58.625
God knows, it might be sucked inside.

40:59.250 --> 41:03.250
That’s the physical side of it, but also mental side of it,

41:03.625 --> 41:06.291
that you will [not] know what you are talking about.

41:06.500 --> 41:09.458
If you say something, you’ll say something else.

41:10.333 --> 41:15.083
It’s possible with your tongue. It’s quite possible

41:15.333 --> 41:20.208
that we may not be able to talk, may not be able to say anything.

41:20.417 --> 41:27.083
Anything is possible if you try to trouble

41:27.500 --> 41:32.250
your tongue like that, using it for wrong purposes.

41:32.709 --> 41:40.083
Tongue is not for being used for

41:40.333 --> 41:46.166
abusive things,as well as for — some people try to be

41:46.375 --> 41:51.250
extra kind and gentle and this and that

41:51.709 --> 41:54.458
to achieve some ends.

41:55.417 --> 42:00.041
This kind of thing also is very, very much — is dangerous

42:00.500 --> 42:04.083
for the tongue and you might develop blisters on your tongue

42:04.583 --> 42:08.125
to such an extent that people who even

42:08.709 --> 42:12.000
go on saying harsh things to others and all that

42:13.000 --> 42:17.291
can develop a kind of a cancer.

42:18.625 --> 42:23.417
Some people think that if you bear up everything is good. Is not.

42:24.375 --> 42:28.667
If somebody is trying to oppress you, don’t try to bear it.

42:29.333 --> 42:33.333
Throw it away because if you bear also,

42:33.667 --> 42:37.583
you can move to the left and you can get horrible things

42:38.166 --> 42:42.041
like cancer. You can get cancer.

42:42.583 --> 42:45.709
Those who are aggressive, they can get also diseases;

42:46.125 --> 42:49.709
and those (who) are very much, I should say,

42:50.291 --> 42:53.291
bearing type also get into trouble.

42:54.166 --> 42:57.417
So you should be in a balanced state,

42:58.083 --> 43:00.250
should not accept anything.

43:01.166 --> 43:04.542
Supposing anybody calls you name just keep quiet look at that person

43:04.709 --> 43:07.667
that’s all. Know that he’s a stupid fool.

43:08.375 --> 43:10.208
But don’t accept it.

43:10.500 --> 43:14.458
If you accept it and go on crying about it and weeping about it,

43:15.542 --> 43:19.166
then you can get cancer. But supposing

43:19.625 --> 43:22.375
somebody says something, you should know (he) is a stupid fool,

43:22.583 --> 43:25.500
just keep out of it, then nothing can happen.

43:27.583 --> 43:32.000
So both ways one has to be careful because Krishna is

43:32.458 --> 43:36.375
playing around and He sees how far you can go.

43:39.041 --> 43:44.667
Now throat — throat is very important. We should look after it.

43:47.083 --> 43:50.250
Those people who shout,

43:52.000 --> 43:56.625
scream ultimately can lose their power of speech,

43:57.709 --> 44:04.000
can become frantic with their problems of the throat,

44:04.625 --> 44:07.625
specially throat can develop horrible disease

44:08.625 --> 44:14.125
by which you just — they can just get swollen up.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.625
We call it snake disease

44:19.500 --> 44:25.125
and you feel suffocated. So when you talk to someone, talk clearly,

44:25.583 --> 44:31.375
in a sweet manner, but don’t shout at the person, never.

44:32.208 --> 44:35.625
Neither you try to show peevishness in your speech.

44:37.166 --> 44:40.542
If you are peevish, then cancer can set in.

44:41.333 --> 44:44.625
So both ways you have to be careful, as you are Sahaja Yogis.

44:45.041 --> 44:47.000
You have to have this knowledge,

44:47.375 --> 44:51.208
that you will not do, bear anything nonsensical if anybody speaks —

44:51.625 --> 44:54.000
means you should not accept it.

44:54.166 --> 44:56.500
One may say something to you. It’s all right.

44:57.041 --> 44:59.041
And sometimes you should tell him off

44:59.250 --> 45:01.625
that “You were saying like this, (it) is not so.”

45:02.375 --> 45:06.583
It’s best is not to bear it up and to suffer.

45:07.083 --> 45:09.709
You’re not Christ. You don’t have His powers.

45:11.083 --> 45:13.667
Because if you do that, you’ll develop cancer.

45:14.583 --> 45:19.083
So try to be in a way just in the centre,

45:20.458 --> 45:23.583
watching everything, if there’s aggression

45:24.000 --> 45:28.125
or if there’s recession (reception) —one of the two things

45:28.709 --> 45:32.542
you must not give in to any of these attitudes,

45:32.667 --> 45:35.542
but develop an attitude  of standing

45:36.166 --> 45:38.709
very firmly on your own grounds.

45:39.458 --> 45:43.625
For example, there was a Chinese story I read

45:44.375 --> 45:48.166
that there once — a king wanted his

45:48.375 --> 45:51.083
two cocks to win in a race,

45:51.542 --> 45:54.625
so they said you send them to a sage and train them up.

45:55.333 --> 45:59.208
So he has sent them to a sage. They were trained very well.

45:59.709 --> 46:05.250
And when they were brought, they stood in the arena

46:06.125 --> 46:09.625
and many cocks were there, who started attacking them,

46:10.458 --> 46:13.458
but these two were standing like this, least bothered.

46:14.709 --> 46:18.333
They tried and tried, but these two were standing like this.

46:20.250 --> 46:23.000
As a result, all of them ran away.

46:23.709 --> 46:26.250
So that’s what is the character you should have.

46:26.709 --> 46:30.125
Is not to bend to something because somebody is aggressive

46:30.500 --> 46:35.709
and also not to aggress others,

46:36.625 --> 46:40.583
not to torture other, not to sit on somebody’s head.

46:40.709 --> 46:43.542
It’s very, very dangerous  for your throat

46:44.041 --> 46:47.417
and such a throat will always, will always be in danger

46:47.667 --> 46:50.208
of getting some horrible diseases.

46:51.166 --> 46:55.583
All this I’ve told you because so many things we know about,

46:56.041 --> 46:58.583
we should reach it. We have

46:59.166 --> 47:02.125
— but we have very subtle knowledge about  Vishuddhi chakra.

47:02.417 --> 47:04.375
We should also have little gross,

47:04.583 --> 47:06.709
that what can happen to our Vishuddhi chakra

47:07.291 --> 47:10.166
if we try not to look after it.

47:12.417 --> 47:17.500
So this is what is Shri Krishna’s work. Also teeth He looks after.

47:18.583 --> 47:22.250
Ears He looks after. You know what is to be done

47:22.500 --> 47:28.083
about the teeth and the ears. These are His own sixteen —

47:30.625 --> 47:35.458
we can say — works. We can call them as karias, sixteen

47:36.125 --> 47:40.166
on which He works on different, different levels.

47:40.625 --> 47:45.625
And you must try to develop our powers of our

47:47.291 --> 47:52.375
Vishuddhi chakra by so many ways and

47:52.667 --> 47:57.333
so many exercises, by understanding

47:58.083 --> 48:02.542
what goes wrong with us when we do not understand

48:02.667 --> 48:06.000
and value our Vishuddhi chakra.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.583
Now America is the Vishuddhi of the whole world,

48:11.583 --> 48:15.625
so it is very important that the people who are in charge here

48:16.333 --> 48:20.667
should know all the powers of Vishuddhi,

48:21.333 --> 48:23.709
plus how to preserve it

48:24.583 --> 48:28.667
and how to expand it

48:29.208 --> 48:32.333
to the whole world. With these two hands

48:32.625 --> 48:34.667
also are from Vishuddhi chakra

48:35.250 --> 48:39.083
and, with that, you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

48:40.083 --> 48:43.667
You have to go to different worlds, different countries,

48:44.500 --> 48:49.625
to — even to small villages you have to spread Sahaja Yoga.

48:50.333 --> 48:53.709
Only in the hands first, you see the cool breeze.

48:54.458 --> 49:01.208
That means it is you feel the universal

49:03.583 --> 49:06.458
power of the Divine in your life.

49:06.709 --> 49:10.250
So this is the collective, universal love

49:10.667 --> 49:13.667
that comes to your hand and teaches you.

49:14.542 --> 49:17.542
So it’s such an important chakra is this.

49:18.083 --> 49:21.250
In the same way, America’s very important

49:21.458 --> 49:24.542
and, as citizens of America, you should try

49:24.709 --> 49:28.333
to maintain the religion the dharma here

49:28.500 --> 49:33.709
and to create a great understanding

49:34.458 --> 49:39.709
for world problems and try to give love

49:40.333 --> 49:44.709
to all the people from whatever country they will be coming.

49:46.041 --> 49:47.709
May God bless you all.
