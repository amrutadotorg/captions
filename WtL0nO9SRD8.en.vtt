WEBVTT

00:01.230 --> 00:10.955
Today we are going to do the puja
of Adi Shakti.

00:17.340 --> 00:24.132
It’s a difficult subject to talk about
Adi Shakti

00:25.773 --> 00:35.286
because it’s not easy to understand

00:35.919 --> 00:41.780
that Adi Shakti is the power of Sadashiva.

00:42.026 --> 00:48.028
Sadashiva is the God Almighty.

00:49.051 --> 00:53.203
She is His breath, as they some people
call it.

00:53.404 --> 00:57.803
Some say She is the desire

00:59.676 --> 01:09.602
and some say that She’s the entire power
of Sadashiva,

01:09.909 --> 01:19.549
and Sadashiva cannot do anything without
Her powers.

01:23.341 --> 01:32.154
This subject has been described by many
people in various books in different ways.

01:32.959 --> 01:39.234
But actually we need not go

01:39.435 --> 01:43.693
to the background of the creation
of Adi Shakti,

01:43.894 --> 01:50.723
for that at least you’ll need seven
lectures. But we’ll come to the point

01:50.924 --> 01:56.516
where Adi Shakti started working on this
Mother Earth.

01:58.130 --> 02:00.728
The first thing is we must know,

02:00.929 --> 02:06.676
that She created a Kundalini in the Mother
Earth itself

02:07.711 --> 02:16.612
and She created Shri Ganesha out of
the Mother Earth, it’s very interesting.

02:16.813 --> 02:22.336
So the Mother Earth becomes a very
important thing for us.

02:22.537 --> 02:26.897
If we do not know how to respect the Mother
Earth,

02:27.368 --> 02:33.083
we do not know how to respect ourselves.

02:33.464 --> 02:38.780
The expression of Adi Shakti within you
is the Kundalini, no doubt.

02:38.981 --> 02:43.839
That is the reflection of Adi Shakti
in you.

02:44.040 --> 02:50.211
But the reflection in the Mother Earth is
also expressed,

02:50.412 --> 02:59.626
as you all know, in different places,
different countries, different cities,

02:59.827 --> 03:08.847
as the manifestation of chakras and
Adi Shakti’s creations.

03:09.048 --> 03:17.777
It was very important first to create
a very holy Mother Earth

03:17.978 --> 03:22.130
for human beings to be born on that.

03:23.011 --> 03:33.925
So the reflection of the Adi Shakti as
Kundalini first was on the Mother Earth.

03:34.126 --> 03:42.511
Kundalini is a, we should say, is a wee
part of the Adi Shakti,

03:43.157 --> 03:51.850
or we can say that She is the desire,
pure desire of the Adi Shakti.

03:52.051 --> 03:58.169
So Adi Shakti is the desire, complete
desire of Sadashiva

03:58.370 --> 04:11.441
and Kundalini, Adi Kundalini, is the desire,
complete desire of Adi Shakti.

04:11.822 --> 04:16.101
Now this one was first expressed

04:17.675 --> 04:23.219
in the Mother Earth, inside the Mother
Earth.

04:24.655 --> 04:30.393
Inside the Mother Earth, the Kundalini
came up

04:31.317 --> 04:38.267
in such a way that it cooled down the inner
part of the Mother Earth

04:38.489 --> 04:41.892
as much as it could,

04:42.978 --> 04:55.228
and then it manifested on the surface
of the earth as different chakras.

04:56.938 --> 05:04.973
So it’s tremendous similarity that we have

05:06.219 --> 05:13.243
with Virata, the Mother Earth and the human
beings.

05:15.094 --> 05:26.966
If all of them are being reflected by
the Adi Kundalini,

05:27.167 --> 05:33.150
so there has to be a great connection
between them.

05:34.016 --> 05:43.758
It is not understood by human beings how
they are connected to this Mother Earth.

05:43.959 --> 05:49.223
This Kundalini passed through different
centers, creating different centers

05:49.424 --> 05:56.912
in the Mother Earth and ultimately broke
through Kailasha.

05:57.113 --> 06:00.771
And I don’t know how many have you been
to Kailash you’ll see

06:00.972 --> 06:06.968
tremendous vibrations flowing out
of Kailash.

06:07.791 --> 06:12.923
Now the way we insult our Mother Earth,

06:13.217 --> 06:20.892
what we are doing is we are insulting
the Adi Shakti.

06:21.210 --> 06:27.220
So many ways there are we should respect
the Mother Earth.

06:27.421 --> 06:35.371
I mean it was an Indian custom to begin
with, when you got up from your bed

06:35.572 --> 06:39.452
and you touched the Mother Earth with
your feet,

06:39.653 --> 06:44.477
you have to say, “Oh Mother Earth, please
forgive me

06:44.678 --> 06:49.183
because I’m touching you with my feet”.

06:51.318 --> 07:00.329
All the movements of Mother Earth are
controlled by this inner Kundalini,

07:00.530 --> 07:04.370
which is the reflection of Adi Shakti.

07:04.571 --> 07:10.448
The gravity that it has also is
the manifestation

07:10.649 --> 07:16.379
of the Kundalini of the Mother Earth.

07:16.580 --> 07:25.963
Now, why we are suffering in this beautiful
planet,

07:26.164 --> 07:32.612
because we do not respect what we have
to respect the most.

07:32.813 --> 07:38.003
Mother Earth is to be respected, meaning
what?

07:38.204 --> 07:47.219
Meaning that whatever is created on this
earth, by the movement of the earth,

07:47.420 --> 07:54.578
by the sea, by all the elements, has to be
respected.

07:54.947 --> 08:03.501
Today’s problem is pollution, all kinds
of things people talk of.

08:03.702 --> 08:08.656
The reason behind it, people never
understood the importance

08:08.857 --> 08:16.549
of all these five elements which are
supportive of our life.

08:16.750 --> 08:21.592
So to respect the Mother Earth people do
Bhumi Puja.

08:21.793 --> 08:25.119
Many people, when they are building
a house,

08:25.320 --> 08:30.115
they will do the Bhumi Pujan, means they
will respect the Mother Earth,

08:30.316 --> 08:36.342
because if She is not being respected maybe
there could be an earthquake,

08:36.543 --> 08:46.659
which means that this Mother Earth
understands, knows and acts.

08:48.183 --> 08:55.577
It acts in such a manner that human beings
don’t understand why such things happen.

08:55.778 --> 09:02.260
Now, we can say that, in a place called
Latur,

09:02.784 --> 09:13.432
it was Shri Ganesha’s fourteenth day and
they had to submerge

09:14.177 --> 09:23.477
the statues into the sea or into the river,
so they went all out, singing, dancing.

09:23.678 --> 09:28.816
After coming from there they all started
drinking,

09:29.175 --> 09:36.418
and drinking is not liked by Mother Earth
at all.

09:36.619 --> 09:42.275
If you are drunk and you are walking
on the road you’ll fall down.

09:42.846 --> 09:52.788
It so happened with their drinking that
a big earthquake broke in,

09:52.989 --> 09:57.858
and all those who were dancing, were
drinking, all of them

09:58.059 --> 10:03.325
were engulfed into that earthquake by
Mother Earth.

10:03.526 --> 10:11.320
Only our center, which is there, was
surrounded by a big gap

10:11.521 --> 10:20.680
but nothing happened to our center and not
one single Sahaja Yogi was ruined by that.

10:20.881 --> 10:26.776
We can understand because we are Sahaja
Yogis, how the Mother Earth has acted

10:26.977 --> 10:31.553
to save those people, who were Sahaja
Yogis.

10:31.754 --> 10:38.659
So the understanding of Mother Earth about
saints is very great.

10:38.860 --> 10:47.386
She knows who is a saint, She knows
the feet of a saint

10:47.587 --> 10:53.740
and that’s why, you know so many things
were created, like Moses,

10:53.941 --> 10:59.984
He went to the sea and the Mother Earth
came up, for them to walk through.

11:00.185 --> 11:07.552
If all the Jews had walked, it would not
have worked, but it was Moses

11:07.753 --> 11:14.546
and His saintliness that the Mother Earth
Herself came up and helped.

11:14.747 --> 11:25.266
In the same way when Rama was building
a big bridge between Lanka and India,

11:25.467 --> 11:29.641
the Mother Earth came up as a bridge.

11:29.934 --> 11:37.564
So we should not try to curse the Mother
Earth for any mishaps on this Earth.

11:37.778 --> 11:43.601
If people are saintly they will be always
protected by Mother Earth.

11:43.802 --> 11:49.499
She will always try to give them whatever
they want.

11:49.700 --> 11:56.337
You can see in the minute way, that
supposing now, in our Cabella here,

11:56.538 --> 12:02.086
the roses are of such a big size, such
a big size roses,

12:02.295 --> 12:08.821
you won’t find such big size in the whole
world. But we have here, such big ones.

12:09.022 --> 12:13.897
In Pratisthan we had

12:15.298 --> 12:21.220
flowers of sunflower so big as that.
One man could not lift it.

12:21.421 --> 12:26.767
Now, how is it all this is happening
in particular places?

12:26.968 --> 12:32.212
Is the Mother Earth who knows who is living
here,

12:32.413 --> 12:41.605
who is walking on Her back we should say,
or on Her soil,

12:41.806 --> 12:46.596
because Mother Earth understands
vibrations.

12:46.797 --> 12:54.155
Now, certain places we say that are very
holy.

13:00.611 --> 13:07.627
How have they discovered that these places
are holy, because of magnetic forces.

13:07.828 --> 13:12.834
The magnetic forces in England I was
surprised, were crossing each other

13:13.035 --> 13:15.965
at a place called Oxted where we lived.

13:16.166 --> 13:20.759
They were crossing since long, but we lived
there later on.

13:20.960 --> 13:30.146
So Mother Earth also organizes and arranges
things for saintly people.

13:30.347 --> 13:36.956
It's very interesting to see how the Mother
Earth guides you in a proper way.

13:37.157 --> 13:40.107
I mean, I don't know how many instances
I can give you.

13:40.308 --> 13:45.833
But we don’t understand the value of
the understanding of this Mother Earth

13:46.034 --> 13:52.107
and Her loving protection for all
he saints.

13:52.328 --> 13:59.155
In the same way, we have to understand how
the whole atmosphere, the rain,

13:59.356 --> 14:03.397
comes in at the right time, the moon,
the sun,

14:03.598 --> 14:10.471
everything works out in such a beautiful
manner because they know it’s a saint.

14:10.672 --> 14:17.795
They know these are saintly people sitting
here. They know that they are pure people,

14:17.996 --> 14:24.604
that they are the essence of life and they
should be looked after,

14:24.805 --> 14:29.053
they should be cared for, they should be
bothered for.

14:29.254 --> 14:35.497
It is not bothered about people who are
of no use.

14:35.698 --> 14:42.195
For example now for Haj, so many people
went and so many were killed.

14:42.396 --> 14:47.253
Some went to Amarnath and they were killed
because they were not saints,

14:47.454 --> 14:53.031
just ritualistic people, going for a ritual
which,

14:53.232 --> 15:02.413
in the discretion of the Mother Earth, was
of no avail and of no advantage to them.

15:02.614 --> 15:05.952
But nobody learns from this, nobody learns.

15:06.072 --> 15:10.139
When so many people were going to say,
Amarnath were killed,

15:10.340 --> 15:14.680
Pakistan said, “See, they should not have
gone to this Amarnath,

15:14.881 --> 15:20.949
it’s a false place, why did they go there?
And by going there

15:21.150 --> 15:25.594
what has proved is that it’s not a holy
place”.

15:25.795 --> 15:29.540
But when the Haj thing took place, they had
nothing to say,

15:29.741 --> 15:32.791
they didn’t know how to explain this
Haj business

15:32.992 --> 15:37.765
and the killing – dying of so many people.

15:37.966 --> 15:45.490
The reason is this, that these people have
been going to Haj all the time.

15:45.691 --> 15:49.513
Once there was a stampede with thirty-two
thousand people being

15:49.714 --> 15:54.171
injured and troubled and killed. Now this
is it.

15:54.372 --> 16:02.482
Now, what is Mother Earth suggesting, that
going to these places,

16:02.688 --> 16:09.358
holy places, they are really holy, no doubt;
going to these places,

16:09.559 --> 16:13.724
you are not doing any spiritual ascent.

16:13.925 --> 16:21.151
You are not achieving anything by going
to these places, which are really holy.

16:21.352 --> 16:25.210
That cannot be challenged. They are holy
places.

16:25.411 --> 16:30.263
You must be knowing that I was born
in Chindwara, and Mecca and Chindwara

16:30.464 --> 16:35.905
are on the same Cancer line. How is it?

16:36.106 --> 16:43.075
What is about Mecca? Mecca is
Makkeshwarashiv – it’s a Shiva.

16:43.276 --> 16:49.856
Why did Mohammed Sahib ask people
to worship a stone?

16:50.057 --> 16:54.805
He didn’t believe in stones, He was against
all kinds of idol worship;

16:55.006 --> 16:59.818
then why did He say this black stone,
which is there, has to be worshipped,

17:00.019 --> 17:03.635
for that people have to go there. What was
the reason?

17:03.836 --> 17:08.977
Because He could feel the vibrations, He
could feel that it’s a swayambhu,

17:09.178 --> 17:13.030
so He said it. So all the Muslims like mad
are going there.

17:13.231 --> 17:19.673
By going there nobody has improved, I have
not seen anybody improved by going to Mecca.

17:19.874 --> 17:24.049
It's just a kind of a ritual. They think
if they go there,

17:24.250 --> 17:28.239
when they will die tomorrow they will tell
God, “See now, we have a certificate,

17:28.440 --> 17:31.369
we have been to Mecca.”

17:33.372 --> 17:39.202
Like our pope once upon a time used to give
certificate, that when you go to heaven,

17:39.403 --> 17:45.436
you can show the certificate that now you
are a real Christian.

17:45.637 --> 17:52.589
In this way, all these artificial things
came up, but there is reality behind it.

17:52.790 --> 17:59.161
The difference is the reality is for
the real people and not for false people.

17:59.362 --> 18:02.497
But this ritualism has grown too much.

18:02.698 --> 18:09.708
Like in India we have many swayambhus
created by the Kundalini again I would say,

18:09.909 --> 18:13.106
and which are really worshipped.

18:13.307 --> 18:20.027
I’ve been to most of them and I was
surprised that most of the pujaris

18:20.228 --> 18:25.297
were suffering from some sort of a serious
disease. Like one was a paralyzed fellow.

18:25.498 --> 18:29.722
He said, “We are serving this God here,
and You said this is swayambhu;

18:29.923 --> 18:33.446
then Mother, how, why is it we are
suffering from this disease?”

18:33.647 --> 18:38.442
I said, “Because you are just making money.
You can’t make money out of God.

18:38.643 --> 18:43.034
If you don’t want to serve God, you don’t
stay here, but if you want to serve God,

18:43.235 --> 18:48.223
then you can stay here, but don’t make
money out of this”.

18:48.424 --> 18:55.503
It’s very common, I have seen, those people
who make money get paralysis, I’ve seen it.

18:57.568 --> 19:05.263
It’s a very deep understanding all these
elements, Mother Earth,

19:05.464 --> 19:10.215
everybody has about everything.

19:11.286 --> 19:16.422
Because their Kundalini is not like your
Kundalini,

19:16.623 --> 19:26.780
which is, though in itself is pure, but
because of your human endeavors,

19:26.981 --> 19:32.429
human mistakes, ego, superego, all sorts
of nonsense,

19:32.630 --> 19:41.111
the Kundalini is not so sensitive, nor does
it tell you what is happening.

19:41.312 --> 19:50.558
It has to be very alert, sensitive
spirituality within you,

19:50.759 --> 19:57.812
by which you can say immediately what you
think,

19:58.013 --> 20:02.796
what you know, what you understand about
anything.

20:02.997 --> 20:08.650
But the problem is that this doesn’t exist.

20:08.937 --> 20:13.883
Why is it you should not be so sensitive?

20:14.092 --> 20:18.556
On the contrary, I have seen, if their
mind works against somebody,

20:18.757 --> 20:21.394
then they start saying, “You are catching
on this, you are catching on that,

20:21.514 --> 20:27.013
you are catching on that”. Actually
the person who’s saying that is catching.

20:27.715 --> 20:33.193
So with this thing one has to understand
that if we are the true reflection

20:33.394 --> 20:44.705
of Adi Shakti, then we should be pure,
absolutely pure, like the white snow.

20:44.906 --> 20:49.900
Even one black drop – that’s why I wore
today the white sari -

20:50.101 --> 20:53.919
falls on the white, it shows.

20:54.182 --> 21:04.633
You should be so white that anything,
any minute black spot

21:04.834 --> 21:14.483
also should be seen by you, and in others
also to be felt by you.

21:15.110 --> 21:29.591
If that height is achieved by pure life,
by pure thinking, by pure heart,

21:29.792 --> 21:35.707
it is not necessary to manipulate anything;
no, no need at all.

21:35.908 --> 21:42.997
It’s all natural like the Mother Earth is.
Does She manipulate anything? Nothing.

21:43.198 --> 21:48.215
Just see how spontaneous She is. You put
a seed in the Mother Earth

21:48.416 --> 21:52.327
and see how it sprouts.

21:52.528 --> 21:58.351
She is so spontaneous, Her activity is so
spontaneous, we never wonder about it.

21:58.552 --> 22:02.595
See different types of flowers, different
types of fragrance,

22:02.796 --> 22:06.938
different types of shrubs and trees,

22:07.139 --> 22:12.425
how She grows with such balance in every
place.

22:12.626 --> 22:21.959
In every minute atom and molecule of that
Mother Earth there is sense.

22:23.939 --> 22:31.769
So before us is the best reflection of the
Adi Shakti and that is this Mother Earth.

22:31.970 --> 22:35.150
So first we must respect the Mother Earth.

22:35.351 --> 22:38.995
I like you people because you are sitting
on the ground, it’s very good.

22:39.196 --> 22:43.939
For meditation if you can sit on the Mother
Earth it will be extremely good

22:44.140 --> 22:49.184
because the special quality of the Mother
Earth, which also I have unfortunately,

22:49.385 --> 22:56.493
that I suck your problems. She too sucks
your problem

22:56.694 --> 23:02.227
and when She sucks your problem you get
rid of them without any difficulties.

23:02.428 --> 23:09.589
So, if you cannot, say, sit on the ground,
then you take a stone, better is,

23:09.790 --> 23:16.016
or you can have a marble, or something which
is natural on which you should try to sit.

23:16.217 --> 23:20.457
But if you sit on the plastic and do your
meditation, I don’t know

23:20.658 --> 23:24.339
what is going to help you – the plastic?

23:24.575 --> 23:29.103
That’s why I request you always, that use
natural things,

23:29.304 --> 23:36.490
because natural things can absorb your
problems very well.

23:36.783 --> 23:40.238
Unnaturally also we live otherwise.

23:40.439 --> 23:44.270
You see it is on the physical line, also
on mental line.

23:44.471 --> 23:53.562
On mental line what do we do, that we go on
arguing, explaining,

23:53.763 --> 23:58.703
it’s going on and on and on and on! There’s
no end to it.

23:58.904 --> 24:04.280
One should get headache, you see, actually
with all that. But if you are spontaneous,

24:04.481 --> 24:08.622
if you are very spontaneous, immediately
you will know

24:08.823 --> 24:14.257
what the other fellow is trying to do or
to say or to communicate.

24:14.458 --> 24:16.747
You don’t need much thinking about it,

24:16.948 --> 24:21.420
because you can absorb even the thought
of another person.

24:21.621 --> 24:26.466
Absorb doesn’t mean that you take the bad
thing of that person,

24:26.667 --> 24:32.826
but it’s like the sieving out. You absorb
what another person is saying

24:33.027 --> 24:35.893
and you sieve it out.

24:37.725 --> 24:44.092
Now the problem of this Adi Shakti is this,
that I decided

24:44.293 --> 24:51.981
that I will have all of you enter into
My body, absorb all of you.

24:52.186 --> 24:56.268
It’s a very dangerous game I know, but
I did play,

24:56.469 --> 25:01.125
because I’m supposed to do at this stage
of time,

25:01.326 --> 25:05.071
that I should absorb you all in My body.

25:05.272 --> 25:09.308
So with you, all your problems are also
gone into Me,

25:09.509 --> 25:12.491
all your troubles also have gone into Me.

25:12.692 --> 25:17.030
But by absorbing it, see, it’s like ocean
into which you are put

25:17.231 --> 25:26.394
and you are cleansed. But what about
the ocean?

25:26.791 --> 25:33.530
Ocean has got still your problems and things
lingering and they are very troublesome.

25:33.731 --> 25:39.210
So the best thing would be for you
to cleanse yourself.

25:39.456 --> 25:44.596
Cleansing is very important through
introspection.

25:44.797 --> 25:48.062
But doesn’t mean thinking, never means
thinking.

25:48.263 --> 25:53.737
But introspection means meditation and that
you all should meditate.

25:53.938 --> 25:58.468
I must tell you, we had a meeting
of the leaders

25:58.669 --> 26:02.331
and they came out and sat in the drawing
room.

26:02.532 --> 26:07.039
As soon as they assembled I had such
a severe pain in the stomach

26:07.240 --> 26:12.955
and I had such a bad diarrhea that you
can’t believe.

26:13.156 --> 26:17.784
Now, who has got those problems, I don’t
know.

26:22.304 --> 26:25.340
Who has brought these problems, I don’t
know.

26:25.541 --> 26:32.406
But as a Mother, as a Mother, I don’t mind
anything,

26:32.607 --> 26:36.643
as long as you all get well and purified.

26:36.844 --> 26:41.628
Just like as the Mother Earth cares for you,
I also care for you.

26:41.829 --> 26:45.989
And just like as the Mother Earth loves you,
I also love you,

26:46.190 --> 26:49.409
whether you are bad or good is not
the point.

26:49.610 --> 26:56.527
But to be kind to Me if you could try to be
really good Sahaja Yogis,

26:56.728 --> 27:02.231
not a showoffs, not business-like, not only
thinking type,

27:02.432 --> 27:06.113
not argumentative, not criticizing others;

27:06.314 --> 27:11.102
if you just try to meditate every day ten
to fifteen minutes,

27:11.303 --> 27:17.074
I tell you, My health will be first class.
Because I have taken your injections inside

27:17.275 --> 27:21.586
and they start torturing My life for nothing
at all.

27:21.787 --> 27:27.475
See so, now, it’s a risk I have run, and
I am sure you are all very sensible people,

27:27.676 --> 27:31.870
and you will understand that your Mother
shouldn’t suffer.

27:32.071 --> 27:35.211
This is every-day crucifixion for Me
sometimes you know,

27:35.412 --> 27:41.083
and I don’t know what to say. For example,
the other day in Delhi,

27:41.284 --> 27:44.982
one gentleman who is a leader, came to Me,
to see Me,

27:45.183 --> 27:49.483
and My one foot started going like that
and paining so much.

27:49.650 --> 27:52.560
I mean I didn’t know what to tell him that,
“You get out now,”

27:52.761 --> 27:54.952
because I just can’t hurt him, you know.

27:55.072 --> 27:59.032
But I said, “What’s the matter, where have
you been, what did you do?”

27:59.233 --> 28:04.512
And so he realized and he went out, and
really it improved.

28:04.713 --> 28:10.580
Nearness also, I think, has an effect,
because if a man like that is,

28:10.781 --> 28:15.798
or a lady like that is full of problems and
she comes

28:16.014 --> 28:24.025
very much closer to My attention, then I
have to take up the cross, it’s like this.

28:24.226 --> 28:30.288
A very simple understanding should be that,
“Why are we in Sahaja Yoga?”.

28:30.494 --> 28:37.758
We are in Sahaja Yoga to ascend, to go
higher and higher, as you sang yesterday.

28:37.959 --> 28:43.773
It was very entertaining yesterday the way
you talked about your

28:43.974 --> 28:51.770
ambition to be higher and higher. Really
it was very joy-giving, no doubt.

28:51.971 --> 28:58.052
But what are we doing about it, what are
we trying about it, we should see.

28:58.253 --> 29:02.378
Seriously we must think, are we meditating,

29:02.579 --> 29:07.821
are we all doing something to elevate
others also,

29:08.022 --> 29:11.859
to give realizations to others? Specially
women I have seen,

29:12.060 --> 29:16.889
don’t do much of this, which is very bad,
because you are the mothers.

29:17.090 --> 29:21.308
You have to go all out to give realizations
to others.

29:21.509 --> 29:27.170
But men are more active that way and women
are not. So it works the other way round.

29:27.371 --> 29:33.285
Now on one side the men are, I think are
active but don’t meditate.

29:33.486 --> 29:38.812
Women meditate and men do the outside work,
it’s sort of a part-time,

29:39.013 --> 29:46.977
or you can call it a good labor division
that, “You meditate at home

29:47.178 --> 29:50.381
and we’ll go all out”. It’s not going
to work out.

29:50.582 --> 29:57.595
So one has to meditate and one has to also
go out

29:57.796 --> 30:03.090
to spread Sahaja Yoga.  Both things have
to be done.

30:03.291 --> 30:09.668
Supposing now you meditate and you don’t
spread Sahaja Yoga, you will never ascend.

30:09.869 --> 30:15.552
Because after all this Kundalini, you see,
She’s a sensible woman, na,

30:15.753 --> 30:22.713
She’s very sensible. She thinks, “Why
should I make her a saint?

30:22.914 --> 30:28.224
What is the use?”. Sahaja Yoga is not
individualistic,

30:28.425 --> 30:34.654
it’s not for one person to become a saint
and sit somewhere, it’s not like that.

30:35.182 --> 30:39.213
It’s not meant for one person, for oneself,

30:39.414 --> 30:43.723
it’s not individualistic. It’s a collective
happening.

30:43.924 --> 30:46.990
So if you are not helping to
the collective,

30:47.191 --> 30:51.700
Kundalini says, “All right, you are
all right as it is”, just like our body.

30:51.901 --> 30:56.152
See, in our body if one organ says,
“All right, now I am all right,

30:56.353 --> 31:01.057
I am not going to work out”, or one cell
says that, “I am not going to now grow,

31:01.177 --> 31:05.119
it’s all right. Why should I worry about
the whole body?”, it won’t work.

31:05.320 --> 31:09.833
It’s a living, it’s a living organism,
I have told you hundred times,

31:10.034 --> 31:18.330
when it is a living organism it has to grow,
it has to grow and also to absorb.

31:18.531 --> 31:22.307
To have energy you have to meditate and
you have to grow.

31:22.508 --> 31:26.848
If you don’t grow, you are finished. You
are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

31:27.049 --> 31:33.976
I wouldn’t call a person a Sahaja Yogi who
has not even given one person realization.

31:34.456 --> 31:39.755
Cannot be a Sahaja Yogi, Sahaja Yogi has
to give realizations to others.

31:39.956 --> 31:43.786
Apart from other activities, the main
activity should be

31:43.987 --> 31:46.976
how we give realizations to others.

31:47.177 --> 31:52.609
Unless and until we really look after that
side of life

31:52.810 --> 31:57.217
we can never, never grow in Sahaja Yoga.

31:57.795 --> 32:05.554
For example now, take My position. I’m
all right, I’m complete, I have no problem.

32:05.772 --> 32:14.195
But why did I work so hard and wanted
so many Sahaja Yogis, why?

32:14.396 --> 32:18.388
What was the - I don’t have to grow either,
I’m overgrown already.

32:18.589 --> 32:21.953
I don’t have to do it, but why? What is
the need?

32:22.154 --> 32:26.229
The need is like this, the need is of love.

32:26.430 --> 32:30.530
I have so much love that I have
to channelize it.

32:30.731 --> 32:35.607
If I don’t I’ll suffocate, I can’t love
Myself.

32:35.815 --> 32:40.670
So this love has to spread. For that I have
to have you people,

32:40.871 --> 32:44.969
who can take this love to others and make
them happy.

32:45.170 --> 32:50.292
This is a kind of a vision I have,

32:50.493 --> 32:57.885
and in this special time, it was promised
by many people, by many saints,

32:58.086 --> 33:04.841
and it is so obvious that you are all
specially chosen for this kind of thing.

33:05.042 --> 33:10.742
Now how far you understand your importance
is a different point.

33:15.217 --> 33:22.100
You do for your emancipation, all right,
you meditate.

33:22.301 --> 33:29.303
But if you are not channelizing the love,
the Divine love, what is the use?

33:29.504 --> 33:33.171
Now supposing I repair something very
nicely:

33:33.372 --> 33:38.272
I repair this machine nicely, put it right,
everything, and I don’t speak,

33:38.473 --> 33:41.750
what’s the use of having this?

33:42.282 --> 33:47.004
In the same way, if you work very hard,
I know people who get up at four o’clock,

33:47.205 --> 33:50.247
have their baths, do meditation,

33:50.448 --> 33:54.969
sit down, in the night again they sit down
for meditation.

33:55.170 --> 34:01.264
But they never go out, they never talk
to others, they never spread Sahaja Yoga.

34:01.465 --> 34:08.864
They do not give Divine love to others, so
how can this great problem of this world

34:09.065 --> 34:15.114
be solved, that it has no love? It has
never known Divine love.

34:15.295 --> 34:21.248
It has to be given to them.

34:21.449 --> 34:30.776
They have to feel this Divine love, this
power of Adi Shakti.

34:30.977 --> 34:36.038
They have to know it. Otherwise you have
been selfish, I would say,

34:36.239 --> 34:42.634
that you had a nice time having all this
and you have not given it to others.

34:42.872 --> 34:47.268
This is the reason why Sahaja Yoga
sometimes fails

34:47.469 --> 34:52.905
to create a proper balanced personality
in a human being.

34:53.106 --> 34:57.180
Some people are like this, that now
supposing

34:57.381 --> 35:01.997
a Sahaja Yogi has married another Sahaja
Yogi, take a position like that.

35:02.198 --> 35:07.571
Now My desire is that they should develop
a complete understanding of each other,

35:07.772 --> 35:15.105
love for each other, but love for Sahaja
Yoga and for others.

35:15.306 --> 35:23.135
This is the only way we can justify
marriage in Sahaja Yoga,

35:23.336 --> 35:29.243
otherwise why should they marry? But
doesn’t happen like that.

35:29.444 --> 35:35.820
What happens is once they are married then
either they will quarrel,

35:36.021 --> 35:40.704
they will ask for divorce; if that doesn’t
happen luckily,

35:40.905 --> 35:44.274
because in Sahaja Yoga so easy to get
married, you know.

35:44.475 --> 35:50.535
If that doesn’t happen, then they start
having their own family,

35:50.736 --> 35:59.078
their own homes, they are again becoming
very small, very, very small, very limited.

35:59.279 --> 36:03.230
Did you come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

36:04.640 --> 36:07.167
You have to realize your responsibility.

36:07.287 --> 36:12.176
See this Mother Earth, how She knows
Her responsibility.

36:12.377 --> 36:18.917
She’s just made out of nothing but soil,
some mud, but look at Her.

36:19.118 --> 36:23.960
How She is conscious, how She is
particular, how She works it out,

36:24.161 --> 36:27.193
how She is attentive, how She is careful.

36:27.394 --> 36:32.759
While you, though you have been blessed
so much by everything

36:32.960 --> 36:37.831
you are, are you thinking of giving it
to others?

36:38.032 --> 36:44.388
With twelve disciples, whatever was
the problem of Christianity, I mean

36:44.589 --> 36:52.584
it was nothing good job, I must say, but
still Christianity spread out.

36:53.157 --> 36:57.242
Islam was not a very good job either,
it spread out.

36:57.443 --> 37:04.384
All those bad jobs have spread out so much,
so why not the good job of Sahaja Yoga?

37:04.585 --> 37:08.798
It has to spread, it has to go to various
places.

37:08.999 --> 37:13.167
Try and find out where you can go and talk
about it

37:13.368 --> 37:18.299
and do something good to others and help
them somehow

37:18.500 --> 37:28.770
to rise above this common existence
of misery, unhappiness and destruction.

37:29.001 --> 37:34.125
The time is very short and I think if you
see the time,

37:34.326 --> 37:38.969
the rate at which we are moving is not
proper.

37:39.170 --> 37:42.626
We have to be much faster, we have to go
much ahead

37:42.827 --> 37:48.224
and we have to create much more Sahaja
Yogis

37:48.425 --> 37:56.668
through our consistent, very intensive
effort.

37:56.869 --> 38:02.910
But we - it’s a side issue, you see, it’s
by the way, Sahaja Yoga is by the way.

38:03.111 --> 38:07.044
And this is where we are failing in our
responsibility.

38:07.228 --> 38:09.740
We have to learn from the Mother Earth.

38:09.941 --> 38:15.189
You might say that, “Mataji, how can we be
like you? After all You are Adi Shakti”.

38:15.390 --> 38:18.405
Many people say that. “You are Adi Shakti,
so what,

38:18.606 --> 38:21.681
you see, with one finger You can move
things like that”.

38:21.882 --> 38:27.834
But why should I? Why should I, what
is the need?

38:28.253 --> 38:33.462
So in that reflection that you are Me,

38:33.663 --> 38:38.477
in that reflection that the Mother Earth
is Me,

38:38.678 --> 38:43.424
in that beautiful creation within you,

38:43.625 --> 38:51.733
you have to become very sensitive
to the need of the world.

38:52.015 --> 38:56.421
What is the need of the world? Today,
if you fail,

38:56.622 --> 39:01.824
the whole thing will fail forever. Only
very few will be there.

39:02.025 --> 39:09.084
So the need for you is to spread Sahaja
Yoga, because this love

39:09.285 --> 39:14.769
is not only for you. Is not to be enjoyed
by you,

39:14.959 --> 39:22.722
but is to be enjoyed by as many possible
in the whole world.

39:22.923 --> 39:28.993
So today we have to decide that, as
the children of Adi Shakti,

39:29.194 --> 39:34.529
we have to go all out, everywhere, every
corner,

39:34.730 --> 39:44.171
we have to shout and we have to tell loudly
what is the time in which we are living,

39:44.372 --> 39:56.364
and what is the responsibility that you
have to fulfill as Sahaja Yogis.

39:56.565 --> 40:00.574
There must be some reason why you are here.

40:00.775 --> 40:06.627
Like in the beginning, Sahaja Yogis used
to ask Me, “Mother, was I this last life,

40:06.828 --> 40:11.651
was I Shivaji last life?” I said, “What’s
the use?

40:11.852 --> 40:15.065
You might have been anything, but what are
you today is much higher”.

40:15.266 --> 40:20.078
Try to understand. You might be, say,
Napoleon,

40:20.279 --> 40:27.170
you might be, say, one of the kings say,
or maybe the queen from somewhere.

40:27.371 --> 40:33.042
So what, what did they do? Did they raise
anybody’s Kundalini?

40:33.243 --> 40:37.765
Did they have any power? Even the disciples
of Christ

40:37.966 --> 40:43.428
or even Mohammed Sahib’s disciples, anyone
- did they do it?

40:43.629 --> 40:48.476
Did they have any understanding
of Kundalini?

40:48.677 --> 40:56.564
Did they have any love for others, that
they should give them realization?

40:56.765 --> 41:00.552
There were some Sufis, they never gave
realization to anyone.

41:00.753 --> 41:04.204
There were so many saints who never gave
realization to anybody.

41:04.405 --> 41:07.196
Mohammed Sahib never gave realization
to anybody.

41:07.397 --> 41:11.525
Gautam Buddha never gave realization
to anybody, think of it.

41:11.726 --> 41:15.536
Christ never gave realization to anybody.
Anybody.

41:15.737 --> 41:22.104
Krishna did not do it, Rama did not. Nobody
- but you can do it!

41:23.748 --> 41:29.075
You can do it and you know everything about
Kundalini.

41:29.276 --> 41:35.705
It’s a very big thing because you are
children of the Adi Shakti.

41:35.906 --> 41:40.148
You are here and your Mother is here.

41:40.349 --> 41:47.288
It’s a very, very fortunate thing for Me
that you are here.

41:47.489 --> 41:53.200
I’m very proud of you, but again and again
I have to tell you that

41:53.401 --> 41:59.667
the work has to be with a faster speed,
we have to move with a faster speed

41:59.868 --> 42:02.949
and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

42:03.150 --> 42:09.902
It is rather, rather difficult for Me to say
something forcefully,

42:10.103 --> 42:15.632
that’s not My nature you know. Can’t get
into tempers and cannot get angry,

42:15.833 --> 42:22.943
and I cannot forcefully say something
to you, but if you fail,

42:23.144 --> 42:28.676
then only thing will be that you have
failed Me completely.

42:28.886 --> 42:34.181
It means that, nothing less than that, and
if you don’t want to do it,

42:34.382 --> 42:39.777
then I would request all of you to take a
vow today that you will spread Sahaja Yoga

42:39.978 --> 42:43.376
and you will talk about Sahaja Yoga, know
about Sahaj Yog.

42:43.577 --> 42:46.148
There are many who don’t know anything.

42:46.349 --> 42:50.049
Also it’s very surprising they are Sahaja
Yogis, they don’t know anything.

42:50.250 --> 42:54.020
And don’t create problems for Me, like
marriage:

42:54.221 --> 42:57.259
“We can’t now live now with the wife,
we can’t live with the husband”.

42:57.460 --> 43:03.010
All sorts of nonsensical problems people
create for Me in Sahaja Yoga.

43:03.211 --> 43:07.993
Are you here to create problems, or
to remove problems of people?

43:08.194 --> 43:13.650
So on the whole we have done well I must
say, but it’s not the final.

43:13.851 --> 43:19.876
We have to work faster with more enthusiasm
and joyfully.

43:20.077 --> 43:24.086
You don’t know what joy you get when you
give realization to somebody.

43:24.287 --> 43:30.137
It’s the most joyful moment is when you
give realizations to others.

43:30.338 --> 43:34.272
Just try, you must try once, you’ll
enjoy it,

43:34.473 --> 43:38.675
then you’ll want more and more and more.
Now after Sahaja Yoga really

43:38.876 --> 43:44.741
the want disappears into this desire that,
“My God, this man is going,

43:44.942 --> 43:46.875
should I call him and give him
realization?”

43:47.076 --> 43:49.403
On the street you will feel like calling
him, “Come here, come here,

43:49.604 --> 43:54.582
I want to give you something”, then make
him sit down, give realization.

43:54.783 --> 43:59.361
This will be your style, like mad - you’ll
say, “Oh no, no, look at this,

43:59.562 --> 44:04.439
this gentleman is without any realization,
let us give him”.

44:04.626 --> 44:07.221
You’ll have to go to churches, you’ll have
to go to universities,

44:07.341 --> 44:09.626
you have to go to all such congregations

44:09.827 --> 44:12.957
where they have no idea about what they
can achieve;

44:13.158 --> 44:17.238
and then tell them without any fear,
without any malice.

44:17.439 --> 44:19.858
You can talk to them and you should tell
them,

44:20.059 --> 44:22.494
“Now we are here to help you, for your
good.

44:22.695 --> 44:26.314
We have not come for our good but for your
good, now listen to us”.

44:26.515 --> 44:32.603
And I am sure, very sure, that the Kundalini
within you will be very happy.

44:32.804 --> 44:38.033
She is not happy you see, She is not happy
with people who are not using her fully.

44:38.234 --> 44:42.962
So She will be very happy to help you and
to do the needful

44:43.163 --> 44:46.361
for the emancipation of the whole world.

44:46.496 --> 44:49.376
May God bless you.
