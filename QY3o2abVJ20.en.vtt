00:00.000 --> 00:08.290
I had a special purpose in coming to Ganpatipule, apart from that it was a very beautiful place
and very relaxing for all of you.

00:08.290 --> 00:20.960
The reason is – I found this place had vibrations
which will clear you out very easily, first

00:20.960 --> 00:21.970
of all.

00:21.970 --> 00:27.650
But you have to desire it, really, ardently.

00:27.650 --> 00:32.320
You should have that desire otherwise the
Kundalini may not rise.

00:32.320 --> 00:37.390
That is a very important point; that you have
to desire your ascent, nothing else.

00:37.390 --> 00:44.039
It’s not a place you have come for a holiday
or just for some sort of a relaxation or for

00:44.039 --> 00:54.590
some enjoyment or sleeping or anything, but
you have come here for a penance, for a tapasya,

00:54.590 --> 00:59.519
to clear out yourself completely.

00:59.519 --> 01:07.890
This is a place of Shri Ganesha’s temple
which is not very much frequented by people

01:07.890 --> 01:09.470
and it’s still very, very pure.

01:09.470 --> 01:16.930
And I thought that the Ganesh principle will
be awakened in you which is the source of

01:16.930 --> 01:17.930
everything.

01:17.930 --> 01:29.820
Shri Ganesha’s principle, as you know, in
a very large way or expansive way, we call

01:29.820 --> 01:36.990
it ‘the innocence’, but we do not know
the intricacies and the details to which it

01:36.990 --> 01:40.250
can go and work it out.

01:40.250 --> 01:48.660
Shri Ganesha’s innocence has a tremendous
power to purify people, to make you holy,

01:48.660 --> 01:51.060
to make you auspicious.

01:51.060 --> 01:56.520
A person who has got Shri Ganesha’s principle
awakened is auspicious in his presence.

01:56.520 --> 02:02.390
Such a person, whenever he moves, things move
in a direction that the coefficience works

02:02.390 --> 02:12.140
out, it becomes absolutely auspicious; auspiciousness
which cannot be achieved without Shri Ganesha’s

02:12.140 --> 02:13.140
help.

02:13.140 --> 02:18.560
Now this auspiciousness, now we Sahaja Yogis
believe into; that there is something like

02:18.560 --> 02:23.520
auspiciousness by which everything works out
smoothly.

02:23.520 --> 02:31.340
Everything we feel is done by God’s power,
that we are all the time wanted by nature,

02:31.340 --> 02:36.040
loved by surroundings and the atmosphere.

02:36.040 --> 02:41.840
But this understanding can only come if you
have that pure desire within you, that you

02:41.840 --> 02:42.840
have to ascend.

02:42.840 --> 02:48.189
You have come here to ascend, not to enjoy
yourself or a place of resort or something

02:48.189 --> 02:52.129
like that.

02:52.129 --> 02:59.239
This principle is very much awakened, as you
see, in the local people here.

02:59.239 --> 03:02.549
And how spartan they are, how hard working.

03:02.549 --> 03:08.499
They’ve been awake for days together and
nights together but still they are very, very

03:08.499 --> 03:13.209
relaxed and they do not need any help.

03:13.209 --> 03:15.779
Just in that enthusiasm they are working out!

03:15.779 --> 03:24.310
So the second blessing of Ganesha is that
He’s playful, He’s prasanna, He’s always

03:24.310 --> 03:25.840
a pleasing personality.

03:25.840 --> 03:27.659
He dances.

03:27.659 --> 03:29.299
He pleases you.

03:29.299 --> 03:32.590
He has ways and methods of pleasing you.

03:32.590 --> 03:39.620
And in the same way, a person who has that
awakened Ganesha within him is all the time

03:39.620 --> 03:46.129
a very pleasing personality, not a drawn-out
face, not a face that repels you, the face

03:46.129 --> 03:57.959
that makes you feel unhappy, but is a personality
that makes you very easy, very understandable,

03:57.959 --> 04:03.450
likeable: that sort of a personality you develop.

04:03.450 --> 04:11.269
But, so far as the life has been abroad, I
have seen that the situation has been very

04:11.269 --> 04:12.269
different.

04:12.269 --> 04:22.270
And the aggressiveness and the quarrelsomeness,
we can say, the hurting capacity, is so over-developed

04:22.270 --> 04:32.710
that you have to somehow or other, succumb
completely to the auspiciousness of Shri Ganesha.

04:32.710 --> 04:38.830
Because all the instruments that were to be
used for spreading Sahaja Yoga or for spreading

04:38.830 --> 04:45.389
the love of God, for spreading auspiciousness
of God, working out His designs and plans

04:45.389 --> 04:54.300
and adjusting yourself to the laws of God’s
desires – it was very important that we

04:54.300 --> 05:03.080
should have had our instruments done in such
a way that they were absolutely useful.

05:03.080 --> 05:12.840
On the contrary we have misused them, spoiled
them and have completely made them unholy.

05:12.840 --> 05:17.270
So that’s another point: we have to look
at ourselves here, what have we been doing

05:17.270 --> 05:25.639
to ourselves, what is the need for us to make
ourselves unholy and why should we be unholy.

05:25.639 --> 05:30.849
When Shri Ganesha is there, we can make ourselves
very holy, auspicious.

05:30.849 --> 05:32.940
Now no use believing that we are perfect!

05:32.940 --> 05:35.990
Those who believe like that cannot ascend.

05:35.990 --> 05:40.240
Everybody must know there are lots of imperfections
and, “These imperfections in me that are

05:40.240 --> 05:43.360
[there] should be conquered and [are] to be
found out."

05:43.360 --> 05:46.660
Only in the light of Shri Ganesha’s innocence
you can see.

05:46.660 --> 05:55.950
A little child can show you how we are stupid
and foolish and how we behave.

05:55.950 --> 06:01.229
So many times you must have seen [that] children
come out with such utterances that the elders

06:01.229 --> 06:03.920
are put to shame!

06:03.920 --> 06:14.449
So the child-like temperament can be developed
if we awaken the Shri Ganesha’s principle

06:14.449 --> 06:22.110
within ourselves; which is a very, very powerful,
very, very powerful Deity.

06:22.110 --> 06:26.319
A very powerful Deity.

06:26.319 --> 06:36.650
Because a child, supposing one child is lost,
say a child runs away or if a child is hanging

06:36.650 --> 06:43.939
somewhere on a tree – the whole community
will rush to take out the child, the concern

06:43.939 --> 06:45.460
will be there.

06:45.460 --> 06:50.110
Even in the Western countries, I have seen,
if one little girl is tortured, everybody

06:50.110 --> 06:53.349
is worried about the child, everybody opposes
that.

06:53.349 --> 06:59.520
Maybe there are some horrible people, no doubt,
maybe there are more than they are here, but

06:59.520 --> 07:01.330
one gets concerned.

07:01.330 --> 07:14.080
So a child, itself, is a very sort of a source
of getting all the protection from everywhere.

07:14.080 --> 07:18.300
Because the child is growing, the child is
growing.

07:18.300 --> 07:21.030
Everybody wants to help the child.

07:21.030 --> 07:26.580
So in the same way when this Ganesha principle
is developed into you, you realise that you

07:26.580 --> 07:29.099
have to grow, you are still growing.

07:29.099 --> 07:35.949
A little child learns so many words in such
a short time that we cannot learn afterwards

07:35.949 --> 07:36.949
when we are grown up.

07:36.949 --> 07:42.740
Say, after sixty, if you have to learn even
three sentences, it’s impossible!

07:42.740 --> 07:49.560
So the child is growing and his curiosity
and his capacity to know more things is also

07:49.560 --> 07:54.129
very much sharp and he starts learning more.

07:54.129 --> 07:55.419
He doesn’t think he knows everything.

07:55.419 --> 07:58.810
The ones who think like that are not yet born
properly.

07:58.810 --> 08:01.530
“I don’t know anything!

08:01.530 --> 08:03.599
I have to know this, I have to know that.

08:03.599 --> 08:04.599
I have to know that.

08:04.599 --> 08:06.960
I don’t know anything so far."

08:06.960 --> 08:10.069
And the children do it so easily you must
have seen.

08:10.069 --> 08:18.719
A little bit you do this way or that way,
they immediately follow you.

08:18.719 --> 08:24.080
So what you have to do is to know that you
are still in a child stage, you are growing.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.930
We have to humble down and we have to know
a lot.

08:27.930 --> 08:32.320
And from wherever we have to know, we have
to know.

08:32.320 --> 08:39.870
The arrogance, the idea that we know a lot
itself is very, very dangerous for the growth,

08:39.870 --> 08:41.650
very dangerous.

08:41.650 --> 08:45.740
And that is what one has to give up and should
know that we do not know anything but we have

08:45.740 --> 08:46.930
to know.

08:46.930 --> 08:51.310
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga settle
down as, “We are Sahaja Yogis,” but don’t

08:51.310 --> 08:52.930
know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

08:52.930 --> 08:53.930
So many of them!

08:53.930 --> 08:56.230
Specially the ladies, I am surprised.

08:56.230 --> 08:58.310
They know very little about Sahaja Yoga.

08:58.310 --> 08:59.310
It’s rather surprising.

08:59.310 --> 09:04.000
Now in Sahaja Yoga there’s nothing like
women or men, everybody has equal rights.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.680
It’s not the job of women just to sing songs.

09:06.680 --> 09:07.680
No!

09:07.680 --> 09:08.680
It’s not!

09:08.680 --> 09:11.430
They have to know each and everything about
Sahaja Yoga.

09:11.430 --> 09:15.730
They have to know what are the diseases, how
they are cured, what are the mental problems,

09:15.730 --> 09:17.860
how are these chakras are made.

09:17.860 --> 09:18.860
Everything they have to know.

09:18.860 --> 09:20.830
The medicines they have to know, the psychology.

09:20.830 --> 09:23.570
They have to know the Divine powers.

09:23.570 --> 09:27.560
Everything they have to know, how it works
out.

09:27.560 --> 09:31.779
And that ignorance will never be forgiven
because you are the ones who have to talk

09:31.779 --> 09:34.660
about it to others.

09:34.660 --> 09:38.390
The third thing is: a child is never a silly
person, never silly.

09:38.390 --> 09:41.310
He never does something in a silly way.

09:41.310 --> 09:46.250
While you see many people who are brought
up in a very strict way become suddenly very

09:46.250 --> 09:48.270
silly at an old age.

09:48.270 --> 09:49.270
Very silly.

09:49.270 --> 09:52.170
This phenomenon I see much more in the West.

09:52.170 --> 09:59.410
Suddenly they become, trying to be very youngish-type
and just they’ll clap like this and start

09:59.410 --> 10:01.149
behaving in a very funny manner.

10:01.149 --> 10:03.449
I used to wonder, “What’s wrong with them?

10:03.449 --> 10:05.310
Why are they behaving like this?”

10:05.310 --> 10:07.720
But it is, I think they are bottled up.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.790
And then suddenly they try to behave.

10:10.790 --> 10:12.130
But they (children) are not.

10:12.130 --> 10:14.980
A child is never a silly person.

10:14.980 --> 10:18.180
On the contrary, if there’s somebody silly
they said, “He’s a clown!”

10:18.180 --> 10:20.000
They’ll come and tell me, “He’s a clown,
you know.

10:20.000 --> 10:26.170
He’s not all right!” or, “He’s a buffoon!”

10:26.170 --> 10:27.170
Whatever words they know they’ll express.

10:27.170 --> 10:28.779
They don’t like [it].

10:28.779 --> 10:33.220
They start wondering, “What’s the matter
with this person?”

10:33.220 --> 10:41.670
So all these things come to us because we
have no idea that we have to grow in a steady,

10:41.670 --> 10:45.970
understanding awareness, awareness.

10:45.970 --> 10:51.779
Not in how you express yourself in Sahaja
Yoga, how you do things in Sahaja Yoga.

10:51.779 --> 10:58.220
It is how you are aware of it inside.

10:58.220 --> 11:06.389
In the same way emotionally: when I say something,
I don’t think people understand what I mean.

11:06.389 --> 11:08.050
Now I said that, “You put on bindis."

11:08.050 --> 11:12.320
Again I find you are just the same!

11:12.320 --> 11:13.850
At least here you should.

11:13.850 --> 11:14.920
This is Ganesha’s mark.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.840
They would not put it.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.230
It’s so many times I have said it.

11:20.230 --> 11:23.690
I mean, how much time does it take to put
it on?

11:23.690 --> 11:27.680
Now this is a very common things that are
going on.

11:27.680 --> 11:33.130
Now another thing is that a child doesn’t
want to be dishevelled at all.

11:33.130 --> 11:36.300
Today one child had gone for a bath and was
coming back.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.880
His father wanted him to see me, he said,
“No, my clothes are not all right.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.399
my hair are all dishevelled.

11:41.399 --> 11:42.399
How can I see Mother?”

11:42.399 --> 11:47.470
So he went back, he put some oil on his hair,
properly he dressed up, smartly.

11:47.470 --> 11:52.740
When we were young, we always knew all the
Western people were very smartly dressed,

11:52.740 --> 11:54.490
properly groomed.

11:54.490 --> 11:56.960
They would never come with dishevelled hairs.

11:56.960 --> 12:01.100
But he said, “No, my hair [is] all dishevelled,
how can I go and see Mother?”

12:01.100 --> 12:05.430
So we have to give up these funny ideas of
fashions and all that, because this will all

12:05.430 --> 12:09.730
go away, you’ll lose your hair, you’ll
all become bald-headed to look very funny.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.070
There’s no wisdom in it.

12:12.070 --> 12:13.250
But a child has wisdom!

12:13.250 --> 12:14.360
He wouldn’t come.

12:14.360 --> 12:20.100
He dressed up himself properly, then he came
and stood before me.

12:20.100 --> 12:26.480
And this is what we have to understand: that
our appearances are the expression of our

12:26.480 --> 12:32.259
inner being and we have to do certain things
because we do not know to accept things, how

12:32.259 --> 12:34.300
to do things like a child does.

12:34.300 --> 12:40.160
A child if you tell him anything, he obeys
and he listens.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.899
Otherwise the child is not a normal child.

12:42.899 --> 12:46.660
In India if there’s a child who doesn’t
obey, they just thrash him nicely, put him

12:46.660 --> 12:52.780
in the room for three days, make him starve
and put him right; nothing doing!

12:52.780 --> 12:57.240
That doesn’t mean the people are harsh here
with children.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.050
Nobody kills children or anything.

12:59.050 --> 13:03.519
But you have to be very, very careful with
your children, you shouldn’t allow them

13:03.519 --> 13:16.920
to be lousy, to be untidy, to be languid,
like lotus-eaters or like people who have

13:16.920 --> 13:18.620
no smartness about them.

13:18.620 --> 13:24.589
You are all Sahaja Yogis and you have to be
like that in that way.

13:24.589 --> 13:30.730
A child’s another attribute is that he hits
always the principle of everything.

13:30.730 --> 13:33.089
Always the principle.

13:33.089 --> 13:36.000
A child sees to the principle of everything.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.050
And the questions they ask sometimes are so
remarkably collective that I am surprised

13:41.050 --> 13:44.120
how they go to that point.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.720
They never waste time in frivolous things,
never.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.339
Never waste time in frivolous things, talking
of frivolous things.

13:50.339 --> 13:51.339
Nothing of the kind.

13:51.339 --> 13:56.889
I haven’t seen children talking about their
clothes or about the seats they have got or

13:56.889 --> 13:59.120
the houses – nothing of the kind.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.720
They are busy doing some construction!

14:01.720 --> 14:02.720
Very busy, you see.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.660
You ask them, “What are you doing?”

14:04.660 --> 14:09.550
“You see, we are trying to tie up the whole
of the airport,” or the whole of Bombay,

14:09.550 --> 14:10.779
like that they will tell you.

14:10.779 --> 14:12.080
They are very busy people.

14:12.080 --> 14:17.860
If you see Realised souls who are children,
they are always worried about the collective.

14:17.860 --> 14:22.480
And that’s what should be your situation
that you should be all the time worried about

14:22.480 --> 14:29.920
the collective as a child is: that, “How
I will help the collective?”

14:29.920 --> 14:34.470
But not worried about yourself, “What is
my personality, am I that impressive?

14:34.470 --> 14:36.690
If I go to people, will they believe that
I’m something?

14:36.690 --> 14:37.690
A Realised-soul?

14:37.690 --> 14:42.319
Or I am like other women or other men who
are going to the hairdressers and having all

14:42.319 --> 14:48.240
kinds of hairdressing up and wearing all kinds
of funny dresses to impress others?

14:48.240 --> 14:52.420
Am I looking like a saint?

14:52.420 --> 14:55.709
Am I behaving like a saint?”

14:55.709 --> 14:57.970
These things should come to you very easily.

14:57.970 --> 15:07.029
If you tell a child, “You are a Sahaja Yogi,”
they say so, “I am a Sahaja Yogi, I can’t

15:07.029 --> 15:08.509
do that way!”

15:08.509 --> 15:14.060
All the nonsense starts after they develop
their ego.

15:14.060 --> 15:18.339
And then they start behaving in a funny way
and it develops much more in the West earlier,

15:18.339 --> 15:21.140
but here it takes time.

15:21.140 --> 15:26.459
And the children are just accepting whatever
God gives them.

15:26.459 --> 15:30.430
To them alertness is so natural.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.199
If there’s an aeroplane that’s going,
they’ll say, “Bye bye aeroplane."

15:34.199 --> 15:36.040
Then there are ships are going, “Bye bye."

15:36.040 --> 15:39.870
To the sea they’ll say, “All right, sea,
we’ll come and see you tomorrow!”

15:39.870 --> 15:41.029
Everything is within their mind.

15:41.029 --> 15:42.649
To them everything is there.

15:42.649 --> 15:46.269
They’ll come, you ask them, “How did you
like it?”

15:46.269 --> 15:48.050
“Oh, we liked the grass very much.

15:48.050 --> 15:52.529
It was nice,” and everything they will tell
you, the details about everything.

15:52.529 --> 15:54.449
So alert!

15:54.449 --> 15:56.440
And then they will say, “Oh, Why didn’t
you do this?

15:56.440 --> 15:59.950
You could have put some flowers here, you
could have done some flowers, would have looked

15:59.950 --> 16:03.110
nice for the hut."

16:03.110 --> 16:07.380
Or something, a suggestion they will give.

16:07.380 --> 16:09.080
Very particular on cleanliness, anything.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.490
And in childhood children get up very early.

16:11.490 --> 16:15.639
All the children in childhood get up very
early.

16:15.639 --> 16:20.379
It’s a nuisance for mothers but they get
up very early and that’s how I also get

16:20.379 --> 16:22.060
up very early.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.029
Getting up early is a child-like behaviour.

16:24.029 --> 16:30.500
Because the birds are singing, the sun is
rising, such beauty in the sky and, “And

16:30.500 --> 16:31.529
Why am I sleeping?”

16:31.529 --> 16:33.540
They’ll wake up the whole house!

16:33.540 --> 16:37.390
But people don’t like it, sometimes they
beat, not in India.

16:37.390 --> 16:39.519
In India people try to get up early in the
morning.

16:39.519 --> 16:43.670
It’s regarded as something very dharmic
and good.

16:43.670 --> 16:47.630
Even if we sleep late, we’ll get up early
in the morning, that’s one thing.

16:47.630 --> 16:50.750
Then you can sleep in the daytime.

16:50.750 --> 16:56.110
But nobody sleeps over this thing like nine
o’clock, ten o’clock, nobody sleeps like

16:56.110 --> 16:57.110
that.

16:57.110 --> 17:02.019
I mean, I have a problem, I don’t know what
to do with myself.

17:02.019 --> 17:06.100
You can sleep in the daytime for a while if
you want to overcome the night sleep and all.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.370
And you can be quite fresh.

17:07.370 --> 17:12.059
And you can be quite all right in the evening
if you sleep for a while.

17:12.059 --> 17:16.410
But a child doesn’t think too much, he doesn’t
plan too much.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.189
He makes fun out of everything.

17:18.189 --> 17:21.020
You take them anywhere, say, you take them
to an airport.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.610
There’s nothing to be played about [there]!

17:22.610 --> 17:26.679
They’ll find out some groove somewhere,
they’ll jump in that, they’ll hide there,

17:26.679 --> 17:27.679
play there.

17:27.679 --> 17:32.419
They can make play out of any gross stuff
that we think is useless, they’ll make out

17:32.419 --> 17:33.690
of it.

17:33.690 --> 17:39.909
They’re very constructive and playful and
that is what we have to be, Make play out

17:39.909 --> 17:40.909
of your life.

17:40.909 --> 17:41.909
Everything!

17:41.909 --> 17:46.990
You see, meeting people, talking to them:
it should come naturally, not artificially.

17:46.990 --> 17:50.360
Also some people, I have seen, have a habit
of putting up an expression all the time,

17:50.360 --> 17:53.450
like a smile or a frown or this thing.

17:53.450 --> 17:55.309
Children are never like that.

17:55.309 --> 17:56.690
Their muscles are so supple.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.460
They react all the time.

17:58.460 --> 18:03.490
Sometimes when they are happy, when they are
unhappy, everything.

18:03.490 --> 18:07.320
The muscles all the time are acting like that.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.320
Nobody is tense.

18:08.320 --> 18:14.990
That’s why we have problems with our faces,
because we keep them in one style.

18:14.990 --> 18:19.380
And these days the more miserable, you are
regarded as more handsome!

18:19.380 --> 18:22.920
That’s finished!

18:22.920 --> 18:26.720
Or else some people just go on smiling all
the time like this, it’s very bad.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.190
Or all the time absolutely feeling unhappy.

18:29.190 --> 18:39.510
You should allow the action of your emotions
to be expressed on your face.

18:39.510 --> 18:43.730
I am told that it is said that, “There should
be no emotions shown on your faces."

18:43.730 --> 18:46.679
I mean, I can’t understand!

18:46.679 --> 18:50.000
What is the use of such a personality who
doesn’t show any emotions?

18:50.000 --> 18:53.670
I mean, you are not a stone are you?

18:53.670 --> 18:59.120
So all these foolish, stupid ideas which are
given to us should be given up.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.120
And we should smile, we should laugh, naturally.

19:02.120 --> 19:05.419
We should talk to people in a natural way.

19:05.419 --> 19:07.860
And the child is extremely dignified.

19:07.860 --> 19:10.880
Shri Ganesha dances with His dignity.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.610
He doesn’t do frivolous, nonsensical things.

19:13.610 --> 19:23.860
In His rise and in His fall and in His movements
and His steps, He’s nothing but His weight.

19:23.860 --> 19:26.030
So something cheapish He doesn’t do.

19:26.030 --> 19:29.230
In the same way there should be dignity throughout.

19:29.230 --> 19:31.690
Dignified behaviour should be within us.

19:31.690 --> 19:36.630
Now you have to judge yourself, how far you
have become Shri Ganesha within yourself.

19:36.630 --> 19:37.799
Are you innocent?

19:37.799 --> 19:41.960
You think of cheating others, spoiling others.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.390
Like my television, I was amazed!

19:43.390 --> 19:47.630
I mean, I can never think of spoiling a television
and this and that.

19:47.630 --> 19:50.120
These ideas, from where do they come into
your heads?

19:50.120 --> 19:51.120
Why should we?

19:51.120 --> 19:55.240
I have never done it all my life, something
like that.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.360
You know that I have always paid every duty,
everything.

19:58.360 --> 20:03.261
Why should we do such a nonsensical [thing],
to spoil the television and spoil it, make

20:03.261 --> 20:05.600
it look cheaper, for what?

20:05.600 --> 20:08.760
How much are you going to save out of it?

20:08.760 --> 20:12.410
But all these ideas come into your heads,
I just don’t know from where.

20:12.410 --> 20:13.450
Why cheat?

20:13.450 --> 20:14.830
We are Sahaja Yogis.

20:14.830 --> 20:16.309
We cannot cheat anyone.

20:16.309 --> 20:20.330
I mean, you can tell the customs, “This
is the situation is.

20:20.330 --> 20:23.299
If you allow we’ll go, otherwise we’ll
stay."

20:23.299 --> 20:26.669
It’s a negative attitude.

20:26.669 --> 20:27.680
Never comes to children.

20:27.680 --> 20:30.330
They are so plain and simple.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.919
Once we had gone, I must tell you how children
are so simple.

20:33.919 --> 20:43.080
Once we had gone inside a port and my nephew
gave me two tins of cheese and we were bringing

20:43.080 --> 20:44.360
it out.

20:44.360 --> 20:49.779
So my daughter who was a very small girl,
so when we were coming and he asked, “Do

20:49.779 --> 20:50.779
you have anything?”

20:50.779 --> 20:52.970
I said, “We have some two tins of cheese."

20:52.970 --> 20:55.190
“Yes, yes and we’re going to eat it also.

20:55.190 --> 20:57.140
See we have opened one and we are eating!”

20:57.140 --> 21:00.200
The customs fellow was so impressed by her
innocence.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.010
He says, “For your eating?”

21:02.010 --> 21:05.270
“Yes, yes for our eating, we have taken
it.

21:05.270 --> 21:06.460
Is it all right?”

21:06.460 --> 21:09.980
He said, “It’s all right."

21:09.980 --> 21:17.659
You see, the simplicity and innocence is itself
a certificate for you,.

21:17.659 --> 21:18.740
Not this cunning methods.

21:18.740 --> 21:19.929
What is there?

21:19.929 --> 21:24.220
I mean, precisely on the phone I tell them,
“Oh baba, for heaven’s sake!

21:24.220 --> 21:26.830
I’ll pay every duty, you don’t have to
do anything.

21:26.830 --> 21:29.830
Just put this thing there, tell that it is
mine.

21:29.830 --> 21:33.010
You don’t have to do anything.

21:33.010 --> 21:37.390
Declare it, this that."

21:37.390 --> 21:38.480
Why?

21:38.480 --> 21:41.890
Where is our mind going?

21:41.890 --> 21:44.630
It’s all right!

21:44.630 --> 21:47.270
How much are we going to lose in there?

21:47.270 --> 21:49.409
How much have we gained so far in money?

21:49.409 --> 21:50.740
What do we have?

21:50.740 --> 21:54.810
Saving money here, saving money there.

21:54.810 --> 21:57.679
Children don’t do like that!

21:57.679 --> 21:59.850
No, they don’t.

21:59.850 --> 22:06.950
Like my grandson, he was saying, “Why do
you stay in this wretched place?

22:06.950 --> 22:08.720
Very bad vibrations in London!”

22:08.720 --> 22:13.460
I said, “You see, your grandfather has to
stay here for earning money."

22:13.460 --> 22:14.460
He said, “Money?

22:14.460 --> 22:18.309
Why do you need so much money for, why do
you need money, why don’t you come to India?”

22:18.309 --> 22:19.539
I said, “You need money."

22:19.539 --> 22:23.440
So when my husband came back, he took out
a two-p, he said, “You want money?

22:23.440 --> 22:24.440
Have it!

22:24.440 --> 22:25.440
Now put it on your head!

22:25.440 --> 22:28.300
Why do you want to have money?”

22:28.300 --> 22:30.660
And my husband didn’t know where to look.

22:30.660 --> 22:33.010
“You want money, all right, have it, put
it on your head!”

22:33.010 --> 22:38.090
He was a little boy, you see!

22:38.090 --> 22:40.250
But interest in money starts later on.

22:40.250 --> 22:46.460
As soon as there’s money we start looking
at it, when we grow up, otherwise we don’t.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.870
All this money interest starts going later
on.

22:48.870 --> 22:50.030
What is for Ganesha?

22:50.030 --> 22:53.270
Money is the dust of His feet.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.270
What for Him gold?

22:54.270 --> 22:55.930
What for Him anything?

22:55.930 --> 23:00.309
Whether He wears a crown of gold or He doesn’t
wear anything makes no difference!

23:00.309 --> 23:01.309
He’s is there!

23:01.309 --> 23:03.000
His head is just the same.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.710
Out of respect, out of adoration, people might
give Him gold or anything just to feel satisfied,

23:07.710 --> 23:08.710
it’s alright.

23:08.710 --> 23:12.300
For Him what does it matter?

23:12.300 --> 23:18.990
And any child who is a real child will not
accept anything from anybody else, nothing.

23:18.990 --> 23:23.309
But if he takes, he will think, “How should
I return it back?”

23:23.309 --> 23:24.309
Always!

23:24.309 --> 23:27.130
I know my own grandchildren have done it.

23:27.130 --> 23:32.380
If you give them something, they’ll make
a heart, put inside that, write it down nicely

23:32.380 --> 23:37.440
and when I come out of my bathroom, they’ll
give me that heart, you see, that, “Thank

23:37.440 --> 23:40.110
you very much,” for this and that.

23:40.110 --> 23:45.640
But when we grow up we even forget to thank
people, we take everything for granted, we

23:45.640 --> 23:46.640
don’t have that.

23:46.640 --> 23:50.450
We just think we have to judge everyone all
the time, “That’s not good, this is not

23:50.450 --> 23:51.930
good, could have been better!”

23:51.930 --> 23:56.490
We never think, “This is given to us, be
thankful!”

23:56.490 --> 23:58.830
Count your blessings.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.520
But for children it’s not so.

24:00.520 --> 24:06.900
If you give them a small thing, they’ll
keep it, “This is given to me by my grandmother!”

24:06.900 --> 24:11.289
I have seen this in my own grandchildren.

24:11.289 --> 24:15.640
The eldest one when she was small I gave her
a little sari, a very small one just for her

24:15.640 --> 24:16.640
to wear.

24:16.640 --> 24:21.059
So when I went there she said, “You see,
nani, I must tell you one thing serious is

24:21.059 --> 24:22.059
happening."

24:22.059 --> 24:23.059
I said, “What?”

24:23.059 --> 24:27.580
“You see, the sari you gave me, I’ve kept
it very carefully but my mother is trying

24:27.580 --> 24:28.580
to be funny!”

24:28.580 --> 24:29.580
I said, “What happened?”

24:29.580 --> 24:33.020
“You know, she didn’t give it to anyone
but she showed it to some people, she should

24:33.020 --> 24:34.440
not have shown it!”

24:34.440 --> 24:36.100
Very seriously!

24:36.100 --> 24:42.000
They are so sweet and so beautiful when they
say things.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.590
Like once I had given her a Wendy house and
a Wendy house she made it nicely, she called

24:47.590 --> 24:51.250
her mother, “I have made a very nice house
for you, come along!”

24:51.250 --> 24:53.380
So my daughter is rather tall.

24:53.380 --> 24:58.110
She found it difficult, she went inside the
Wendy house and sat there and she said, “Haa!

24:58.110 --> 24:59.549
So what have you got for me to eat?”

24:59.549 --> 25:08.190
She said, “Mummy, when you go to somebody’s
house you don’t say such a thing!”

25:08.190 --> 25:09.190
And she laughed.

25:09.190 --> 25:10.450
And she laughed so much that she broke all
her Wendy house.

25:10.450 --> 25:17.030
So she came out and she told Me, “Grandma,
you have not given any good training to your

25:17.030 --> 25:18.690
daughters!

25:18.690 --> 25:22.559
First of all, she comes to my house, asks
funny questions and then she breaks my house,

25:22.559 --> 25:27.200
do you do like this to anyone else?”

25:27.200 --> 25:31.799
How innocent and simple they are!

25:31.799 --> 25:34.630
Like that there are so many things I can tell
you [that] I have seen.

25:34.630 --> 25:37.120
The way they talk and say things, and all
that.

25:37.120 --> 25:44.779
So simple and so good and so collective and
so beautiful.

25:44.779 --> 25:46.920
In the same way we have to be.

25:46.920 --> 25:51.750
Another thing, a child doesn’t have any
fear.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.059
A child doesn’t have any fear.

25:54.059 --> 25:55.590
Ganesha has no fear at all.

25:55.590 --> 25:59.750
In the same way you should have no fear, no
fear at all, no fear.

25:59.750 --> 26:03.990
As long as your Mother is with you why should
you have any fear?

26:03.990 --> 26:05.720
Fear of this, fear of that, “I am frightened."

26:05.720 --> 26:07.120
“I can’t do this,” “I can’t do that."

26:07.120 --> 26:09.030
That children never do.

26:09.030 --> 26:13.460
They’ll try everything, if you tell them.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.000
You should have no fear.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.340
I don’t know what fear is.

26:20.340 --> 26:24.210
In the same way you should have no fear, no
fear of anything.

26:24.210 --> 26:26.429
Nothing is going to go wrong with you.

26:26.429 --> 26:27.620
But don’t do wrong things.

26:27.620 --> 26:31.620
If you do wrong things it will repel, it will
work out on you.

26:31.620 --> 26:37.250
But don’t do wrong things, be straight forward
and nothing can harm you, nothing can harm

26:37.250 --> 26:38.250
you.

26:38.250 --> 26:43.929
We have had so many experiences of this, how
everywhere laid down for you, everybody is

26:43.929 --> 26:45.610
looking after you.

26:45.610 --> 26:48.660
There are so many Deities who are working
out things out for you.

26:48.660 --> 26:55.970
But you have to be, you have to be, extremely
careful that you do not develop this fear

26:55.970 --> 26:57.110
business.

26:57.110 --> 27:01.140
Because fear takes you to the Left side and
once you go to the left side, you know the

27:01.140 --> 27:04.140
problems of the Left side is – first of
all -you go against Ganesha.

27:04.140 --> 27:08.590
Ganesha is standing at the base of the Left.

27:08.590 --> 27:13.700
And then you develop cancers, you develop
all these things, fear, fear, fear and emotional

27:13.700 --> 27:15.899
problems and all these things come.

27:15.899 --> 27:19.919
In emotions you should be bubbling with joy.

27:19.919 --> 27:25.000
Joy is your emotion.

27:25.000 --> 27:31.049
In action you should be thoughtless.

27:31.049 --> 27:34.250
And in ascent you should be surrendered.

27:34.250 --> 27:40.190
That’s all, it’s very simple, three mantras
are very simple for children.

27:40.190 --> 27:45.149
They are like that.

27:45.149 --> 27:56.529
Today at the base of the Shri Ganesha’s
hill, we have to think of awakening the Ganesh

27:56.529 --> 27:57.640
tattwa within us.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.419
For that we have to meditate.

27:59.419 --> 28:01.660
We have to think about it.

28:01.660 --> 28:04.820
We have to put our time to it.

28:04.820 --> 28:10.919
Actually if I were you, I may not sleep at
all, I will go to the seashore, sit down there,

28:10.919 --> 28:12.320
meditate the whole time!

28:12.320 --> 28:17.722
Before breaking the Sahastrara I kept awake
for two nights and I was just all alone, all

28:17.722 --> 28:25.419
alone near the sea, all alone the whole night,
working it out, for two nights.

28:25.419 --> 28:27.221
But what do we do?

28:27.221 --> 28:30.950
We think about our comforts, we think about
this, about that.

28:30.950 --> 28:32.120
It’s not so!

28:32.120 --> 28:33.120
You are here!

28:33.120 --> 28:35.700
Such a chance!

28:35.700 --> 28:40.450
We get tired because we think too much.

28:40.450 --> 28:46.480
We know how to get out of this tiredness and
this and that.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.490
So this is a very good chance for you [that]
we have come here.

28:49.490 --> 28:51.660
Of course it’s a beautiful place and all
that.

28:51.660 --> 28:56.320
But it’s mainly the thing why I thought
of bringing you here [is] that it may suddenly

28:56.320 --> 29:04.110
give you a big boost up and you might rise
very high; for which I may not be able to

29:04.110 --> 29:12.840
really arrange otherwise, this kind of ascent
which is possible.

29:12.840 --> 29:16.000
Many of the Indians have not even seen this
place before.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.250
It’s such a beautiful place and they are
surprised that in India we have such beautiful

29:19.250 --> 29:21.460
places!

29:21.460 --> 29:31.590
And after coming here they have felt the beauty,
the auspiciousness, the wisdom of choosing

29:31.590 --> 29:33.919
this place.

29:33.919 --> 29:37.740
It’s so lovable, so beautiful.

29:37.740 --> 29:44.730
But I hope I see the effects of that in you.

29:44.730 --> 29:47.190
Now you have to go and have your food.

29:47.190 --> 29:50.840
We have a very generous man who is cooking
for you.

29:50.840 --> 29:56.660
Be careful!

30:05.960 --> 30:09.760
You shouldn’t spoil your health!

30:09.780 --> 30:13.000
Specially for those who have to go with us
ahead.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.019
So be careful!

30:14.019 --> 30:15.390
They’re very generous people.

30:15.390 --> 30:19.910
My brother and the gentleman who is cooking
for you – both are competing in generosity.

30:19.910 --> 30:22.860
So you be careful!

30:22.870 --> 30:29.450
Now only the Sahaja Yogis from abroad and
non-vegetarians have to go first and then

30:29.450 --> 30:35.440
the vegetarians will go and after that we’ll
have some music program.

30:35.440 --> 30:37.820
That’s how it is going to be.

30:37.820 --> 30:44.830
Tomorrow morning I expect you to go for meditation
about five o’clock in the morning.

30:44.830 --> 30:47.570
Then have your bath in the sea.
