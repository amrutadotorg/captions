00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.290
I had a special purpose in coming to Ganpatipule, apart from that it was a very beautiful place
and very relaxing for all of you.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:20.960
The reason is – I found this place had vibrations
which will clear you out very easily, first

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.970
of all.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.650
But you have to desire it, really, ardently.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.320
You should have that desire otherwise the
Kundalini may not rise.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.390
That is a very important point; that you have
to desire your ascent, nothing else.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.039
It’s not a place you have come for a holiday
or just for some sort of a relaxation or for

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:54.590
some enjoyment or sleeping or anything, but
you have come here for a penance, for a tapasya,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.519
to clear out yourself completely.

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:07.890
This is a place of Shri Ganesha’s temple
which is not very much frequented by people

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.470
and it’s still very, very pure.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.930
And I thought that the Ganesh principle will
be awakened in you which is the source of

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.930
everything.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:29.820
Shri Ganesha’s principle, as you know, in
a very large way or expansive way, we call

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.990
it ‘the innocence’, but we do not know
the intricacies and the details to which it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.250
can go and work it out.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:48.660
Shri Ganesha’s innocence has a tremendous
power to purify people, to make you holy,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.060
to make you auspicious.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.520
A person who has got Shri Ganesha’s principle
awakened is auspicious in his presence.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.390
Such a person, whenever he moves, things move
in a direction that the coefficience works

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:12.140
out, it becomes absolutely auspicious; auspiciousness
which cannot be achieved without Shri Ganesha’s

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.140
help.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.560
Now this auspiciousness, now we Sahaja Yogis
believe into; that there is something like

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.520
auspiciousness by which everything works out
smoothly.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.340
Everything we feel is done by God’s power,
that we are all the time wanted by nature,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.040
loved by surroundings and the atmosphere.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.840
But this understanding can only come if you
have that pure desire within you, that you

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.840
have to ascend.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.189
You have come here to ascend, not to enjoy
yourself or a place of resort or something

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.129
like that.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:59.239
This principle is very much awakened, as you
see, in the local people here.

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.549
And how spartan they are, how hard working.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.499
They’ve been awake for days together and
nights together but still they are very, very

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:13.209
relaxed and they do not need any help.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.779
Just in that enthusiasm they are working out!

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:24.310
So the second blessing of Ganesha is that
He’s playful, He’s prasanna, He’s always

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.840
a pleasing personality.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.659
He dances.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.299
He pleases you.

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.590
He has ways and methods of pleasing you.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.620
And in the same way, a person who has that
awakened Ganesha within him is all the time

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.129
a very pleasing personality, not a drawn-out
face, not a face that repels you, the face

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:57.959
that makes you feel unhappy, but is a personality
that makes you very easy, very understandable,

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.450
likeable: that sort of a personality you develop.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.269
But, so far as the life has been abroad, I
have seen that the situation has been very

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.269
different.

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:22.270
And the aggressiveness and the quarrelsomeness,
we can say, the hurting capacity, is so over-developed

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:32.710
that you have to somehow or other, succumb
completely to the auspiciousness of Shri Ganesha.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.830
Because all the instruments that were to be
used for spreading Sahaja Yoga or for spreading

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.389
the love of God, for spreading auspiciousness
of God, working out His designs and plans

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:54.300
and adjusting yourself to the laws of God’s
desires – it was very important that we

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:03.080
should have had our instruments done in such
a way that they were absolutely useful.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:12.840
On the contrary we have misused them, spoiled
them and have completely made them unholy.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.270
So that’s another point: we have to look
at ourselves here, what have we been doing

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:25.639
to ourselves, what is the need for us to make
ourselves unholy and why should we be unholy.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.849
When Shri Ganesha is there, we can make ourselves
very holy, auspicious.

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.940
Now no use believing that we are perfect!

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.990
Those who believe like that cannot ascend.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.240
Everybody must know there are lots of imperfections
and, “These imperfections in me that are

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.360
[there] should be conquered and [are] to be
found out."

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.660
Only in the light of Shri Ganesha’s innocence
you can see.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:55.950
A little child can show you how we are stupid
and foolish and how we behave.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:01.229
So many times you must have seen [that] children
come out with such utterances that the elders

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.920
are put to shame!

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:14.449
So the child-like temperament can be developed
if we awaken the Shri Ganesha’s principle

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:22.110
within ourselves; which is a very, very powerful,
very, very powerful Deity.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.319
A very powerful Deity.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:36.650
Because a child, supposing one child is lost,
say a child runs away or if a child is hanging

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.939
somewhere on a tree – the whole community
will rush to take out the child, the concern

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.460
will be there.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.110
Even in the Western countries, I have seen,
if one little girl is tortured, everybody

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.349
is worried about the child, everybody opposes
that.

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:59.520
Maybe there are some horrible people, no doubt,
maybe there are more than they are here, but

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.330
one gets concerned.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:14.080
So a child, itself, is a very sort of a source
of getting all the protection from everywhere.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.300
Because the child is growing, the child is
growing.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.030
Everybody wants to help the child.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.580
So in the same way when this Ganesha principle
is developed into you, you realise that you

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.099
have to grow, you are still growing.

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:35.949
A little child learns so many words in such
a short time that we cannot learn afterwards

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:36.949
when we are grown up.

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:42.740
Say, after sixty, if you have to learn even
three sentences, it’s impossible!

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:49.560
So the child is growing and his curiosity
and his capacity to know more things is also

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.129
very much sharp and he starts learning more.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:55.419
He doesn’t think he knows everything.

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:58.810
The ones who think like that are not yet born
properly.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.530
“I don’t know anything!

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.599
I have to know this, I have to know that.

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:04.599
I have to know that.

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:06.960
I don’t know anything so far."

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.069
And the children do it so easily you must
have seen.

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:18.719
A little bit you do this way or that way,
they immediately follow you.

00:08:18.719 --> 00:08:24.080
So what you have to do is to know that you
are still in a child stage, you are growing.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.930
We have to humble down and we have to know
a lot.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.320
And from wherever we have to know, we have
to know.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:39.870
The arrogance, the idea that we know a lot
itself is very, very dangerous for the growth,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.650
very dangerous.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.740
And that is what one has to give up and should
know that we do not know anything but we have

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.930
to know.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.310
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga settle
down as, “We are Sahaja Yogis,” but don’t

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.930
know a word about Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:53.930
So many of them!

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.230
Specially the ladies, I am surprised.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:58.310
They know very little about Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.310
It’s rather surprising.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:04.000
Now in Sahaja Yoga there’s nothing like
women or men, everybody has equal rights.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.680
It’s not the job of women just to sing songs.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.680
No!

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.680
It’s not!

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.430
They have to know each and everything about
Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.730
They have to know what are the diseases, how
they are cured, what are the mental problems,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.860
how are these chakras are made.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.860
Everything they have to know.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.830
The medicines they have to know, the psychology.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.570
They have to know the Divine powers.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:27.560
Everything they have to know, how it works
out.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.779
And that ignorance will never be forgiven
because you are the ones who have to talk

00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:34.660
about it to others.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.390
The third thing is: a child is never a silly
person, never silly.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.310
He never does something in a silly way.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.250
While you see many people who are brought
up in a very strict way become suddenly very

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.270
silly at an old age.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.270
Very silly.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.170
This phenomenon I see much more in the West.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:59.410
Suddenly they become, trying to be very youngish-type
and just they’ll clap like this and start

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.149
behaving in a very funny manner.

00:10:01.149 --> 00:10:03.449
I used to wonder, “What’s wrong with them?

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:05.310
Why are they behaving like this?”

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.720
But it is, I think they are bottled up.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.790
And then suddenly they try to behave.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.130
But they (children) are not.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:14.980
A child is never a silly person.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.180
On the contrary, if there’s somebody silly
they said, “He’s a clown!”

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.000
They’ll come and tell me, “He’s a clown,
you know.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.170
He’s not all right!” or, “He’s a buffoon!”

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:27.170
Whatever words they know they’ll express.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.779
They don’t like [it].

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:33.220
They start wondering, “What’s the matter
with this person?”

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:41.670
So all these things come to us because we
have no idea that we have to grow in a steady,

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.970
understanding awareness, awareness.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:51.779
Not in how you express yourself in Sahaja
Yoga, how you do things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:58.220
It is how you are aware of it inside.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:06.389
In the same way emotionally: when I say something,
I don’t think people understand what I mean.

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:08.050
Now I said that, “You put on bindis."

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.320
Again I find you are just the same!

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.850
At least here you should.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.920
This is Ganesha’s mark.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.840
They would not put it.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.230
It’s so many times I have said it.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.690
I mean, how much time does it take to put
it on?

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.680
Now this is a very common things that are
going on.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:33.130
Now another thing is that a child doesn’t
want to be dishevelled at all.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:36.300
Today one child had gone for a bath and was
coming back.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.880
His father wanted him to see me, he said,
“No, my clothes are not all right.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.399
my hair are all dishevelled.

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:42.399
How can I see Mother?”

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:47.470
So he went back, he put some oil on his hair,
properly he dressed up, smartly.

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:52.740
When we were young, we always knew all the
Western people were very smartly dressed,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.490
properly groomed.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.960
They would never come with dishevelled hairs.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.100
But he said, “No, my hair [is] all dishevelled,
how can I go and see Mother?”

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.430
So we have to give up these funny ideas of
fashions and all that, because this will all

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:09.730
go away, you’ll lose your hair, you’ll
all become bald-headed to look very funny.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.070
There’s no wisdom in it.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.250
But a child has wisdom!

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:14.360
He wouldn’t come.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.100
He dressed up himself properly, then he came
and stood before me.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:26.480
And this is what we have to understand: that
our appearances are the expression of our

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.259
inner being and we have to do certain things
because we do not know to accept things, how

00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:34.300
to do things like a child does.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:40.160
A child if you tell him anything, he obeys
and he listens.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.899
Otherwise the child is not a normal child.

00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:46.660
In India if there’s a child who doesn’t
obey, they just thrash him nicely, put him

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:52.780
in the room for three days, make him starve
and put him right; nothing doing!

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.240
That doesn’t mean the people are harsh here
with children.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.050
Nobody kills children or anything.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.519
But you have to be very, very careful with
your children, you shouldn’t allow them

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:16.920
to be lousy, to be untidy, to be languid,
like lotus-eaters or like people who have

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.620
no smartness about them.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:24.589
You are all Sahaja Yogis and you have to be
like that in that way.

00:13:24.589 --> 00:13:30.730
A child’s another attribute is that he hits
always the principle of everything.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.089
Always the principle.

00:13:33.089 --> 00:13:36.000
A child sees to the principle of everything.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.050
And the questions they ask sometimes are so
remarkably collective that I am surprised

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.120
how they go to that point.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.720
They never waste time in frivolous things,
never.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.339
Never waste time in frivolous things, talking
of frivolous things.

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:51.339
Nothing of the kind.

00:13:51.339 --> 00:13:56.889
I haven’t seen children talking about their
clothes or about the seats they have got or

00:13:56.889 --> 00:13:59.120
the houses – nothing of the kind.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.720
They are busy doing some construction!

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.720
Very busy, you see.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.660
You ask them, “What are you doing?”

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.550
“You see, we are trying to tie up the whole
of the airport,” or the whole of Bombay,

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.779
like that they will tell you.

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:12.080
They are very busy people.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:17.860
If you see Realised souls who are children,
they are always worried about the collective.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.480
And that’s what should be your situation
that you should be all the time worried about

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:29.920
the collective as a child is: that, “How
I will help the collective?”

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.470
But not worried about yourself, “What is
my personality, am I that impressive?

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.690
If I go to people, will they believe that
I’m something?

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:37.690
A Realised-soul?

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:42.319
Or I am like other women or other men who
are going to the hairdressers and having all

00:14:42.319 --> 00:14:48.240
kinds of hairdressing up and wearing all kinds
of funny dresses to impress others?

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.420
Am I looking like a saint?

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.709
Am I behaving like a saint?”

00:14:55.709 --> 00:14:57.970
These things should come to you very easily.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:07.029
If you tell a child, “You are a Sahaja Yogi,”
they say so, “I am a Sahaja Yogi, I can’t

00:15:07.029 --> 00:15:08.509
do that way!”

00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:14.060
All the nonsense starts after they develop
their ego.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.339
And then they start behaving in a funny way
and it develops much more in the West earlier,

00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:21.140
but here it takes time.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.459
And the children are just accepting whatever
God gives them.

00:15:26.459 --> 00:15:30.430
To them alertness is so natural.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.199
If there’s an aeroplane that’s going,
they’ll say, “Bye bye aeroplane."

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:36.040
Then there are ships are going, “Bye bye."

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:39.870
To the sea they’ll say, “All right, sea,
we’ll come and see you tomorrow!”

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.029
Everything is within their mind.

00:15:41.029 --> 00:15:42.649
To them everything is there.

00:15:42.649 --> 00:15:46.269
They’ll come, you ask them, “How did you
like it?”

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:48.050
“Oh, we liked the grass very much.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.529
It was nice,” and everything they will tell
you, the details about everything.

00:15:52.529 --> 00:15:54.449
So alert!

00:15:54.449 --> 00:15:56.440
And then they will say, “Oh, Why didn’t
you do this?

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.950
You could have put some flowers here, you
could have done some flowers, would have looked

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:03.110
nice for the hut."

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.380
Or something, a suggestion they will give.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.080
Very particular on cleanliness, anything.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.490
And in childhood children get up very early.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:15.639
All the children in childhood get up very
early.

00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:20.379
It’s a nuisance for mothers but they get
up very early and that’s how I also get

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:22.060
up very early.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.029
Getting up early is a child-like behaviour.

00:16:24.029 --> 00:16:30.500
Because the birds are singing, the sun is
rising, such beauty in the sky and, “And

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.529
Why am I sleeping?”

00:16:31.529 --> 00:16:33.540
They’ll wake up the whole house!

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:37.390
But people don’t like it, sometimes they
beat, not in India.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.519
In India people try to get up early in the
morning.

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:43.670
It’s regarded as something very dharmic
and good.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.630
Even if we sleep late, we’ll get up early
in the morning, that’s one thing.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:50.750
Then you can sleep in the daytime.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:56.110
But nobody sleeps over this thing like nine
o’clock, ten o’clock, nobody sleeps like

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.110
that.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:02.019
I mean, I have a problem, I don’t know what
to do with myself.

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:06.100
You can sleep in the daytime for a while if
you want to overcome the night sleep and all.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.370
And you can be quite fresh.

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:12.059
And you can be quite all right in the evening
if you sleep for a while.

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:16.410
But a child doesn’t think too much, he doesn’t
plan too much.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:18.189
He makes fun out of everything.

00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:21.020
You take them anywhere, say, you take them
to an airport.

00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.610
There’s nothing to be played about [there]!

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:26.679
They’ll find out some groove somewhere,
they’ll jump in that, they’ll hide there,

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:27.679
play there.

00:17:27.679 --> 00:17:32.419
They can make play out of any gross stuff
that we think is useless, they’ll make out

00:17:32.419 --> 00:17:33.690
of it.

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:39.909
They’re very constructive and playful and
that is what we have to be, Make play out

00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:40.909
of your life.

00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:41.909
Everything!

00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:46.990
You see, meeting people, talking to them:
it should come naturally, not artificially.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.360
Also some people, I have seen, have a habit
of putting up an expression all the time,

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.450
like a smile or a frown or this thing.

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:55.309
Children are never like that.

00:17:55.309 --> 00:17:56.690
Their muscles are so supple.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.460
They react all the time.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:03.490
Sometimes when they are happy, when they are
unhappy, everything.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.320
The muscles all the time are acting like that.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.320
Nobody is tense.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:14.990
That’s why we have problems with our faces,
because we keep them in one style.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:19.380
And these days the more miserable, you are
regarded as more handsome!

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.920
That’s finished!

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.720
Or else some people just go on smiling all
the time like this, it’s very bad.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.190
Or all the time absolutely feeling unhappy.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:39.510
You should allow the action of your emotions
to be expressed on your face.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.730
I am told that it is said that, “There should
be no emotions shown on your faces."

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:46.679
I mean, I can’t understand!

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:50.000
What is the use of such a personality who
doesn’t show any emotions?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.670
I mean, you are not a stone are you?

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:59.120
So all these foolish, stupid ideas which are
given to us should be given up.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.120
And we should smile, we should laugh, naturally.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:05.419
We should talk to people in a natural way.

00:19:05.419 --> 00:19:07.860
And the child is extremely dignified.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.880
Shri Ganesha dances with His dignity.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.610
He doesn’t do frivolous, nonsensical things.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:23.860
In His rise and in His fall and in His movements
and His steps, He’s nothing but His weight.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.030
So something cheapish He doesn’t do.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.230
In the same way there should be dignity throughout.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.690
Dignified behaviour should be within us.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:36.630
Now you have to judge yourself, how far you
have become Shri Ganesha within yourself.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.799
Are you innocent?

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:41.960
You think of cheating others, spoiling others.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.390
Like my television, I was amazed!

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.630
I mean, I can never think of spoiling a television
and this and that.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.120
These ideas, from where do they come into
your heads?

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.120
Why should we?

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.240
I have never done it all my life, something
like that.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.360
You know that I have always paid every duty,
everything.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.261
Why should we do such a nonsensical [thing],
to spoil the television and spoil it, make

00:20:03.261 --> 00:20:05.600
it look cheaper, for what?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.760
How much are you going to save out of it?

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:12.410
But all these ideas come into your heads,
I just don’t know from where.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:13.450
Why cheat?

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.830
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.309
We cannot cheat anyone.

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:20.330
I mean, you can tell the customs, “This
is the situation is.

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.299
If you allow we’ll go, otherwise we’ll
stay."

00:20:23.299 --> 00:20:26.669
It’s a negative attitude.

00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:27.680
Never comes to children.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.330
They are so plain and simple.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.919
Once we had gone, I must tell you how children
are so simple.

00:20:33.919 --> 00:20:43.080
Once we had gone inside a port and my nephew
gave me two tins of cheese and we were bringing

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.360
it out.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:49.779
So my daughter who was a very small girl,
so when we were coming and he asked, “Do

00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:50.779
you have anything?”

00:20:50.779 --> 00:20:52.970
I said, “We have some two tins of cheese."

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:55.190
“Yes, yes and we’re going to eat it also.

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.140
See we have opened one and we are eating!”

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.200
The customs fellow was so impressed by her
innocence.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.010
He says, “For your eating?”

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.270
“Yes, yes for our eating, we have taken
it.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.460
Is it all right?”

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.980
He said, “It’s all right."

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:17.659
You see, the simplicity and innocence is itself
a certificate for you,.

00:21:17.659 --> 00:21:18.740
Not this cunning methods.

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.929
What is there?

00:21:19.929 --> 00:21:24.220
I mean, precisely on the phone I tell them,
“Oh baba, for heaven’s sake!

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.830
I’ll pay every duty, you don’t have to
do anything.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.830
Just put this thing there, tell that it is
mine.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.010
You don’t have to do anything.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:37.390
Declare it, this that."

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.480
Why?

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.890
Where is our mind going?

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.630
It’s all right!

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.270
How much are we going to lose in there?

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:49.409
How much have we gained so far in money?

00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:50.740
What do we have?

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.810
Saving money here, saving money there.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.679
Children don’t do like that!

00:21:57.679 --> 00:21:59.850
No, they don’t.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:06.950
Like my grandson, he was saying, “Why do
you stay in this wretched place?

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.720
Very bad vibrations in London!”

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.460
I said, “You see, your grandfather has to
stay here for earning money."

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.460
He said, “Money?

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:18.309
Why do you need so much money for, why do
you need money, why don’t you come to India?”

00:22:18.309 --> 00:22:19.539
I said, “You need money."

00:22:19.539 --> 00:22:23.440
So when my husband came back, he took out
a two-p, he said, “You want money?

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.440
Have it!

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440
Now put it on your head!

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.300
Why do you want to have money?”

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.660
And my husband didn’t know where to look.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.010
“You want money, all right, have it, put
it on your head!”

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:38.090
He was a little boy, you see!

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.250
But interest in money starts later on.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:46.460
As soon as there’s money we start looking
at it, when we grow up, otherwise we don’t.

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.870
All this money interest starts going later
on.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.030
What is for Ganesha?

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:53.270
Money is the dust of His feet.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.270
What for Him gold?

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:55.930
What for Him anything?

00:22:55.930 --> 00:23:00.309
Whether He wears a crown of gold or He doesn’t
wear anything makes no difference!

00:23:00.309 --> 00:23:01.309
He’s is there!

00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:03.000
His head is just the same.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.710
Out of respect, out of adoration, people might
give Him gold or anything just to feel satisfied,

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:08.710
it’s alright.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.300
For Him what does it matter?

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:18.990
And any child who is a real child will not
accept anything from anybody else, nothing.

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:23.309
But if he takes, he will think, “How should
I return it back?”

00:23:23.309 --> 00:23:24.309
Always!

00:23:24.309 --> 00:23:27.130
I know my own grandchildren have done it.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:32.380
If you give them something, they’ll make
a heart, put inside that, write it down nicely

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:37.440
and when I come out of my bathroom, they’ll
give me that heart, you see, that, “Thank

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.110
you very much,” for this and that.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:45.640
But when we grow up we even forget to thank
people, we take everything for granted, we

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.640
don’t have that.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.450
We just think we have to judge everyone all
the time, “That’s not good, this is not

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:51.930
good, could have been better!”

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:56.490
We never think, “This is given to us, be
thankful!”

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.830
Count your blessings.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.520
But for children it’s not so.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:06.900
If you give them a small thing, they’ll
keep it, “This is given to me by my grandmother!”

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.289
I have seen this in my own grandchildren.

00:24:11.289 --> 00:24:15.640
The eldest one when she was small I gave her
a little sari, a very small one just for her

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.640
to wear.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.059
So when I went there she said, “You see,
nani, I must tell you one thing serious is

00:24:21.059 --> 00:24:22.059
happening."

00:24:22.059 --> 00:24:23.059
I said, “What?”

00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:27.580
“You see, the sari you gave me, I’ve kept
it very carefully but my mother is trying

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.580
to be funny!”

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.580
I said, “What happened?”

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.020
“You know, she didn’t give it to anyone
but she showed it to some people, she should

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.440
not have shown it!”

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.100
Very seriously!

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:42.000
They are so sweet and so beautiful when they
say things.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.590
Like once I had given her a Wendy house and
a Wendy house she made it nicely, she called

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.250
her mother, “I have made a very nice house
for you, come along!”

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.380
So my daughter is rather tall.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:58.110
She found it difficult, she went inside the
Wendy house and sat there and she said, “Haa!

00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:59.549
So what have you got for me to eat?”

00:24:59.549 --> 00:25:08.190
She said, “Mummy, when you go to somebody’s
house you don’t say such a thing!”

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:09.190
And she laughed.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.450
And she laughed so much that she broke all
her Wendy house.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:17.030
So she came out and she told Me, “Grandma,
you have not given any good training to your

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.690
daughters!

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:22.559
First of all, she comes to my house, asks
funny questions and then she breaks my house,

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:27.200
do you do like this to anyone else?”

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.799
How innocent and simple they are!

00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:34.630
Like that there are so many things I can tell
you [that] I have seen.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:37.120
The way they talk and say things, and all
that.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:44.779
So simple and so good and so collective and
so beautiful.

00:25:44.779 --> 00:25:46.920
In the same way we have to be.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:51.750
Another thing, a child doesn’t have any
fear.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.059
A child doesn’t have any fear.

00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:55.590
Ganesha has no fear at all.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:59.750
In the same way you should have no fear, no
fear at all, no fear.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:03.990
As long as your Mother is with you why should
you have any fear?

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:05.720
Fear of this, fear of that, “I am frightened."

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:07.120
“I can’t do this,” “I can’t do that."

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.030
That children never do.

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.460
They’ll try everything, if you tell them.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.000
You should have no fear.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.340
I don’t know what fear is.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:24.210
In the same way you should have no fear, no
fear of anything.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.429
Nothing is going to go wrong with you.

00:26:26.429 --> 00:26:27.620
But don’t do wrong things.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.620
If you do wrong things it will repel, it will
work out on you.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:37.250
But don’t do wrong things, be straight forward
and nothing can harm you, nothing can harm

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.250
you.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:43.929
We have had so many experiences of this, how
everywhere laid down for you, everybody is

00:26:43.929 --> 00:26:45.610
looking after you.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.660
There are so many Deities who are working
out things out for you.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:55.970
But you have to be, you have to be, extremely
careful that you do not develop this fear

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.110
business.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:01.140
Because fear takes you to the Left side and
once you go to the left side, you know the

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.140
problems of the Left side is – first of
all -you go against Ganesha.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.590
Ganesha is standing at the base of the Left.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:13.700
And then you develop cancers, you develop
all these things, fear, fear, fear and emotional

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.899
problems and all these things come.

00:27:15.899 --> 00:27:19.919
In emotions you should be bubbling with joy.

00:27:19.919 --> 00:27:25.000
Joy is your emotion.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.049
In action you should be thoughtless.

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:34.250
And in ascent you should be surrendered.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:40.190
That’s all, it’s very simple, three mantras
are very simple for children.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:45.149
They are like that.

00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:56.529
Today at the base of the Shri Ganesha’s
hill, we have to think of awakening the Ganesh

00:27:56.529 --> 00:27:57.640
tattwa within us.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.419
For that we have to meditate.

00:27:59.419 --> 00:28:01.660
We have to think about it.

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.820
We have to put our time to it.

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:10.919
Actually if I were you, I may not sleep at
all, I will go to the seashore, sit down there,

00:28:10.919 --> 00:28:12.320
meditate the whole time!

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.722
Before breaking the Sahastrara I kept awake
for two nights and I was just all alone, all

00:28:17.722 --> 00:28:25.419
alone near the sea, all alone the whole night,
working it out, for two nights.

00:28:25.419 --> 00:28:27.221
But what do we do?

00:28:27.221 --> 00:28:30.950
We think about our comforts, we think about
this, about that.

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:32.120
It’s not so!

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.120
You are here!

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.700
Such a chance!

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:40.450
We get tired because we think too much.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:46.480
We know how to get out of this tiredness and
this and that.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:49.490
So this is a very good chance for you [that]
we have come here.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.660
Of course it’s a beautiful place and all
that.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.320
But it’s mainly the thing why I thought
of bringing you here [is] that it may suddenly

00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:04.110
give you a big boost up and you might rise
very high; for which I may not be able to

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:12.840
really arrange otherwise, this kind of ascent
which is possible.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.000
Many of the Indians have not even seen this
place before.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.250
It’s such a beautiful place and they are
surprised that in India we have such beautiful

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:21.460
places!

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:31.590
And after coming here they have felt the beauty,
the auspiciousness, the wisdom of choosing

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.919
this place.

00:29:33.919 --> 00:29:37.740
It’s so lovable, so beautiful.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:44.730
But I hope I see the effects of that in you.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.190
Now you have to go and have your food.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.840
We have a very generous man who is cooking
for you.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.660
Be careful!

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.760
You shouldn’t spoil your health!

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.000
Specially for those who have to go with us
ahead.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.019
So be careful!

00:30:14.019 --> 00:30:15.390
They’re very generous people.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:19.910
My brother and the gentleman who is cooking
for you – both are competing in generosity.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.860
So you be careful!

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:29.450
Now only the Sahaja Yogis from abroad and
non-vegetarians have to go first and then

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:35.440
the vegetarians will go and after that we’ll
have some music program.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.820
That’s how it is going to be.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:44.830
Tomorrow morning I expect you to go for meditation
about five o’clock in the morning.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.570
Then have your bath in the sea.
