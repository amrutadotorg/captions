00:05:52.283 --> 00:05:55.492
Ask her. Natalie, come here.

00:05:56.492 --> 00:05:59.242
Join hands with Danya.

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.742
Are you all right, Ray, now?

00:06:31.242 --> 00:06:33.867
Put kumkum to everyone. Just take that, see,

00:06:34.158 --> 00:06:36.283
you can leave that here.

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.492
All the ladies, put it on.

00:07:13.832 --> 00:07:17.707
Yesterday one boy stood up and asked Me a question,

00:07:18.217 --> 00:07:20.593
that "When we are such a yoga bhoomi,

00:07:21.134 --> 00:07:23.134
we are such a holy country,

00:07:23.634 --> 00:07:26.259
why is it that all the discoveries in the science

00:07:26.522 --> 00:07:27.819
are made in the West?"

00:07:28.015 --> 00:07:29.681
"Very good question," I said.

00:07:30.134 --> 00:07:33.051
I said, "That is the knowledge of the tree,

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:35.384
as I have told you; that's the knowledge of the tree.

00:07:35.675 --> 00:07:38.134
And what have they achieved is now the end of it,

00:07:38.384 --> 00:07:41.259
and now they want to know the knowledge of the roots.

00:07:42.217 --> 00:07:43.634
That's why they are here."

00:07:44.134 --> 00:07:45.800
So to know the knowledge of the roots,

00:07:46.134 --> 00:07:48.259
first of all we must have humility about it.

00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:50.675
We have not known this knowledge yet,

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:54.509
never known what is in the Kingdom of God.

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.259
As Krishna has said, this tree grows downward

00:07:58.925 --> 00:08:01.925
and the roots are in the brain - clearly.

00:08:02.509 --> 00:08:05.509
So it is an ascent to go to the roots,

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.009
it's a different style.

00:08:07.343 --> 00:08:10.134
Kundalini has to rise upward to go to the roots,

00:08:10.468 --> 00:08:13.009
and to enter into the roots

00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:19.092
what we have to do is to know about it.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.009
Now all these things, like I said yesterday

00:08:22.343 --> 00:08:24.217
that you put on bindi.

00:08:24.593 --> 00:08:28.009
Now this is also - thank God,

00:08:28.217 --> 00:08:29.800
despite all changes in the Bible,

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:31.134
it's written in the Bible

00:08:31.468 --> 00:08:33.468
that you'll be known by the mark you'll be carrying.

00:08:33.675 --> 00:08:35.800
Now let's see how many are courageous, even in India,

00:08:36.092 --> 00:08:37.343
to carry this mark.

00:08:37.675 --> 00:08:39.343
That's why you people catch so fast,

00:08:39.634 --> 00:08:41.009
one of the reasons why you people catch.

00:08:41.343 --> 00:08:43.343
First of all the eyes are not steady.

00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:45.884
You are not used to the steady eyes, you see,

00:08:46.134 --> 00:08:47.509
as the Indians have very steady eyes.

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.675
They are, from childhood they are taught,

00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:51.593
"Where is your attention?"

00:08:51.925 --> 00:08:54.593
All the time they are asked, "Where is your attention?"

00:08:55.343 --> 00:08:57.884
There are some Western Sahaja yogis standing at the back.

00:08:58.259 --> 00:09:00.800
Please give them a chair to sit,

00:09:01.134 --> 00:09:04.593
since they are not able to sit on the ground.

00:09:05.925 --> 00:09:07.301
So where is your attention?

00:09:07.717 --> 00:09:10.842
Now the attention is so disturbed all the time

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.092
and that's why you catch very fast,

00:09:13.426 --> 00:09:14.967
and when you catch from your eyes,

00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:17.051
it goes through your Agnya Chakra.

00:09:17.384 --> 00:09:19.633
Now this is the protection of Agnya Chakra;

00:09:19.842 --> 00:09:22.551
it's actually the blood of Christ that you wear.

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:24.217
But people must have that courage.

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:26.426
They'll wear a cross, but not this.

00:09:27.468 --> 00:09:28.967
In the Western countries it's very difficult

00:09:29.217 --> 00:09:31.759
for people to have that much courage to put on this.

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:32.967
They will have excuses,

00:09:33.217 --> 00:09:35.301
"Mother, we'll lose our jobs," this, that.

00:09:35.593 --> 00:09:37.217
Every sort of an excuse is there.

00:09:37.551 --> 00:09:39.468
But if you are courageous people,

00:09:39.759 --> 00:09:42.176
then you have to start wearing it some time.

00:09:42.468 --> 00:09:45.884
Maybe in the night you start first, then in the daytime.

00:09:46.593 --> 00:09:48.551
Slowly, slowly you can creep into it.

00:09:48.842 --> 00:09:51.551
That's the only thing I think you people have to wear

00:09:51.842 --> 00:09:53.343
- that's important.

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:55.884
That will be a good idea, because you will not catch.

00:09:56.134 --> 00:09:58.009
Because you go outside, your attention is outside,

00:09:58.343 --> 00:10:01.009
you see what's happening outside, the atmosphere is bad.

00:10:01.343 --> 00:10:04.468
Moreover, if you put this on it will not only protect you,

00:10:04.759 --> 00:10:07.134
but also protect others.

00:10:07.967 --> 00:10:09.551
They will have a new idea.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.717
After all, you will dress up like them,

00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:13.634
you are just like them - you have to be.

00:10:14.092 --> 00:10:15.343
But you have to protect,

00:10:15.551 --> 00:10:17.967
and for protection you have to wear something like that.

00:10:18.217 --> 00:10:20.551
I found that when I went first to England

00:10:20.842 --> 00:10:23.593
they used to laugh at Me, looking at My red mark.

00:10:23.884 --> 00:10:25.717
I mean, if they wear lipsticks it's all right,

00:10:25.967 --> 00:10:28.717
even if they are clowns, if they are hippies,

00:10:28.967 --> 00:10:32.301
they are punks, it's all right;

00:10:32.593 --> 00:10:35.092
but if you wear a proper thing which is scientific,

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.468
it's most scientific.

00:10:36.675 --> 00:10:38.593
So to understand the science of the roots

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:41.009
you must understand what it means,

00:10:41.259 --> 00:10:42.967
why this culture is like this:

00:10:43.217 --> 00:10:46.217
because it is more towards the roots,

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.593
the movement is not towards the tree.

00:10:48.884 --> 00:10:50.634
And the tree, where it has ended up?

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.134
Beyond the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.593
So now they are returning back.

00:10:55.884 --> 00:10:58.259
To go from the leaf to the roots is very difficult,

00:10:58.593 --> 00:11:01.634
but to go from the roots to the leaves is easier.

00:11:03.551 --> 00:11:06.468
So for this ascent we have to be humble,

00:11:06.884 --> 00:11:10.426
to know about the knowledge - knowledge about the roots.

00:11:10.717 --> 00:11:14.842
Now why they put on, all of them, is this is the reason,

00:11:15.551 --> 00:11:18.759
that to protect your Agnya. First of all there's no entry.

00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:23.092
That's why, once an Indian gets realization, he ascends.

00:11:24.217 --> 00:11:26.092
He doesn't go on catching again;

00:11:26.426 --> 00:11:29.551
I mean, this doesn't happen here.

00:11:31.176 --> 00:11:33.301
This is one of the things one has to do.

00:11:33.593 --> 00:11:35.217
Now the second thing is the puja.

00:11:35.551 --> 00:11:39.634
The puja has its effect on everyone,

00:11:39.884 --> 00:11:41.217
but according to your depth;

00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:44.092
and that's for that you have to have shraddha, faith.

00:11:44.343 --> 00:11:46.176
If your mind is still thinking,

00:11:46.468 --> 00:11:48.593
you cannot achieve much in puja.

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:51.884
While for Indians, to attend a puja is the highest.

00:11:52.176 --> 00:11:54.217
They don't mind My lecture, anything;

00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:55.717
if they miss the program, doesn't matter,

00:11:55.967 --> 00:11:57.384
any music program is all right,

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:00.092
any kind of discomfort is all right

00:12:00.343 --> 00:12:01.925
- as long as they can attend to puja.

00:12:02.176 --> 00:12:03.551
Today people have come

00:12:03.842 --> 00:12:06.092
from two hundred to three hundred miles for this puja,

00:12:06.384 --> 00:12:08.301
all the way,

00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:12.551
because they know this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:12:12.842 --> 00:12:14.343
For that you have to do the puja.

00:12:14.634 --> 00:12:16.343
If you have to ascend, you have to do it.

00:12:16.593 --> 00:12:18.884
But you are still in the same level;

00:12:19.217 --> 00:12:23.176
if you are still thinking about the tree style,

00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:24.759
then you'll go downward.

00:12:25.092 --> 00:12:28.717
To move inward, you have to have all these instruments.

00:12:29.009 --> 00:12:31.301
One of them is of puja.

00:12:31.634 --> 00:12:35.551
Now for puja, are we prepared?

00:12:36.634 --> 00:12:38.176
Are we in that mind,

00:12:38.426 --> 00:12:41.176
whatever time it has to start, will start?

00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:43.884
First of all, we have tied our watches quite tight.

00:12:44.176 --> 00:12:46.717
Thank God, I lost My watch last night!

00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:58.884
So now the watches have tied us up so much

00:12:59.217 --> 00:13:02.301
that now eleven o'clock puja means eleven o'clock.

00:13:02.633 --> 00:13:05.717
It's not like that - it depends on.

00:13:06.759 --> 00:13:10.468
It is the natural growth of our being,

00:13:10.842 --> 00:13:13.343
it is the natural working of our growing.

00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:15.217
When I came here, you'll be amazed,

00:13:15.468 --> 00:13:18.343
all My right side was paralyzed, absolutely paralyzed.

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:21.301
Right foot was paralyzed, I just couldn't move My legs,

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:26.343
and all the feet had become like a fossilized stuff,

00:13:26.634 --> 00:13:28.717
and I didn't know what was happening.

00:13:29.176 --> 00:13:32.717
The reason is, everybody has been thinking too much.

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:35.759
Now the attention should be how we are,

00:13:36.051 --> 00:13:39.092
what are we doing about ourselves, that's very important;

00:13:39.426 --> 00:13:40.717
how far we have achieved.

00:13:40.967 --> 00:13:44.759
But on the contrary, the attention is disturbed

00:13:44.967 --> 00:13:48.301
by many things. One of them may be the marriages,

00:13:48.634 --> 00:13:50.468
that marriages have to take place,

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:52.343
what's going to happen and all that.

00:13:52.633 --> 00:13:55.551
But at puja time it has no meaning.

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:59.633
Nothing has importance than but to develop yourself,

00:13:59.884 --> 00:14:00.967
and this is what it is:

00:14:01.217 --> 00:14:03.967
at this time you have to develop your roots.

00:14:04.343 --> 00:14:05.634
And to develop your roots,

00:14:05.967 --> 00:14:08.176
it's a different science altogether.

00:14:08.633 --> 00:14:12.633
The another thing is that you can achieve

00:14:14.551 --> 00:14:19.009
the movement of the tree by aggressiveness, by aggressing.

00:14:19.842 --> 00:14:22.717
But when you aggress in the human mind,

00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:26.217
then you are drawn towards the Mooladhara more,

00:14:26.468 --> 00:14:29.301
towards the gravity force,

00:14:29.634 --> 00:14:31.842
and you go down towards the dead;

00:14:32.092 --> 00:14:34.092
the materialism starts coming up.

00:14:34.343 --> 00:14:38.301
Because it's upside down, human growth is upside down.

00:14:38.551 --> 00:14:41.468
You know the brain is here, not at the feet.

00:14:42.217 --> 00:14:44.759
It starts from the brain, the growth starts from the brain;

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:47.633
as you know as doctors that the whole thing is here

00:14:47.884 --> 00:14:51.634
and the nerves go down, they do not start from the feet.

00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:55.176
So when you start putting your attention to your

00:14:55.426 --> 00:14:58.634
outward growth, you go towards materialism automatically.

00:14:59.051 --> 00:15:00.967
Then you find matter has nothing to do,

00:15:01.301 --> 00:15:04.051
you have fossilized yourself. So then you come back.

00:15:04.301 --> 00:15:07.051
Now you have to change your attitude completely

00:15:07.343 --> 00:15:08.759
towards this new learning,

00:15:09.092 --> 00:15:12.301
and this new learning is that you have to

00:15:12.634 --> 00:15:15.551
develop a humble attitude, first of all.

00:15:15.842 --> 00:15:19.634
And secondly, what are we going to achieve

00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:25.426
in our ascent through learning the different tantra,

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:30.343
the mechanism, the divine mechanism - how to work it out.

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:35.426
The person who is extremely efficient in the other field

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:38.092
might become completely inefficient in this field,

00:15:38.343 --> 00:15:44.051
absolutely useless: possessed, aggressive, good for nothing,

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:50.092
hot-tempered, hot-tempered, and also devoid of any love,

00:15:50.343 --> 00:15:51.884
affection, compassion.

00:15:52.092 --> 00:15:54.842
Like they were shocked to hear

00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:57.301
that people kill their children in England,

00:15:57.551 --> 00:15:58.634
they couldn't believe it.

00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:00.634
They can't believe even one child killed like that.

00:16:00.842 --> 00:16:03.009
They think that English are perfect people,

00:16:03.343 --> 00:16:04.717
how can they kill their children?

00:16:05.009 --> 00:16:07.634
They are very perfect according to Indians.

00:16:07.884 --> 00:16:11.634
Indians have no idea as to what kind of life they lead there.

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:13.217
So when I told them,

00:16:13.468 --> 00:16:15.634
"You are sadly mistaken, they are very unhappy people.

00:16:15.967 --> 00:16:18.675
Don't think that by developing radios and all these things,

00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:20.717
they are happy. They are all mad.

00:16:20.967 --> 00:16:22.426
They sit before the television,

00:16:22.634 --> 00:16:25.842
then they can't do without it, they become televisions.

00:16:26.092 --> 00:16:27.717
And the television is exploiting them,

00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:29.634
putting wrong ideas into their heads,

00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:32.717
and they're brainwashed, they are very conditioned"

00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:34.092
- they can't believe it.

00:16:34.343 --> 00:16:36.633
They can't believe that people could be that cruel

00:16:36.842 --> 00:16:40.633
in the West; because the growth is towards materialism,

00:16:40.842 --> 00:16:45.551
so they are becoming gross, insensitive, immoral,

00:16:45.842 --> 00:16:50.301
and also devoid of any compassion and love.

00:16:51.468 --> 00:16:54.217
So first of all, as I said yesterday you should say,

00:16:54.426 --> 00:16:56.633
"I'm not French" - you should say, "I am not a Westerner."

00:16:56.842 --> 00:16:59.426
Let's see, that may work out, work out better,

00:16:59.634 --> 00:17:02.967
"I'm not a Westerner." Maybe when you enter a university

00:17:03.176 --> 00:17:04.759
- supposing you are in Oxford University

00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:06.343
and then you go to the Cambridge University,

00:17:06.551 --> 00:17:09.884
you have to wear the badge of the Cambridge University.

00:17:10.176 --> 00:17:12.884
In the same way now you have changed your nationality,

00:17:13.176 --> 00:17:15.633
I think you should say, "I'm not a Westerner now anymore."

00:17:15.842 --> 00:17:19.092
Maybe the passport might say anything, doesn't matter.

00:17:19.842 --> 00:17:22.633
But you have a special privilege in India as Sahaja yogis,

00:17:22.842 --> 00:17:24.717
you know that. As Sahaja yogis the government

00:17:24.967 --> 00:17:26.967
has accepted you. If you want to stay here forever,

00:17:27.301 --> 00:17:29.842
they'll have no objection.

00:17:49.092 --> 00:17:55.884
So this, whatever is now we think works out

00:17:56.343 --> 00:17:58.884
on the tree level, has to be changed.

00:17:59.301 --> 00:18:02.884
Here everything becomes united, synthesized.

00:18:03.217 --> 00:18:06.717
The whole tree is synthesized in a seed.

00:18:06.967 --> 00:18:08.634
So if you have to become the root,

00:18:08.884 --> 00:18:10.759
you have to come down to the position where,

00:18:11.051 --> 00:18:14.717
how to synthesize. Now grouping is a wrong thing.

00:18:15.051 --> 00:18:17.551
If you group yourself as English, this, that,

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:19.717
or Indians or anything, is wrong.

00:18:20.051 --> 00:18:22.343
In Sahaja Yoga we don't believe in all that.

00:18:22.633 --> 00:18:25.092
There is no differentiation

00:18:25.426 --> 00:18:27.759
between one Sahaja yogi and another Sahaja yogi,

00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:29.426
because it is Vishwa Dharma.

00:18:29.633 --> 00:18:31.092
But we say this is Vishwa Dharma,

00:18:31.426 --> 00:18:33.633
but we are not out of it as yet,

00:18:33.759 --> 00:18:39.509
we are not yet in the same pendal where we should be.

00:18:39.717 --> 00:18:42.301
We still separate, we are still different,

00:18:42.633 --> 00:18:46.301
we have to still mix up from one country to another country.

00:18:46.633 --> 00:18:49.092
We have to all become one with each other,

00:18:49.343 --> 00:18:51.634
understanding each other;

00:18:52.509 --> 00:18:54.842
then only the problems of the West will go away.

00:18:55.092 --> 00:18:58.217
As a result of this right-sided movement

00:18:58.509 --> 00:19:01.343
I feel that people are really becoming idiotic.

00:19:01.634 --> 00:19:05.759
I categorize them as idiotic or stupid, and all that.

00:19:06.051 --> 00:19:07.176
I mean I don't how,

00:19:07.426 --> 00:19:09.551
what categories they will fall into later on,

00:19:09.842 --> 00:19:12.759
where there have been not such categories before.

00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.717
I mean, they might form a new dimension of stupidity.

00:19:17.634 --> 00:19:19.092
This is what I feel,

00:19:19.426 --> 00:19:23.551
that unless and until you now learn about this new yantra,

00:19:23.842 --> 00:19:24.842
the new method:

00:19:25.092 --> 00:19:27.634
in that you don't see to the physical comfort,

00:19:27.925 --> 00:19:30.509
you don't see to the so-called emotional pampering.

00:19:30.842 --> 00:19:32.343
All these things you don't see,

00:19:32.633 --> 00:19:35.217
but where do you go - into innocence.

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:40.301
The quality of the matter itself is innocence, the essence.

00:19:40.633 --> 00:19:42.842
So the quality, I should say,

00:19:43.092 --> 00:19:45.551
or the essence of everything you become.

00:19:45.759 --> 00:19:46.759
You become the essence.

00:19:47.092 --> 00:19:48.634
But for that you have to move inward,

00:19:48.925 --> 00:19:51.051
and the inward movement is only possible

00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:54.176
when you understand and respect,

00:19:54.509 --> 00:20:00.051
and think yourself privileged to be able to do all this.

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:02.633
But you have to understand why I tell you.

00:20:02.842 --> 00:20:04.634
I have nothing to gain out of you.

00:20:04.967 --> 00:20:07.176
Now one should not think I'm trying to make you Indians,

00:20:07.426 --> 00:20:11.092
but supposing you wear here three-piece suit and a tie,

00:20:11.426 --> 00:20:12.343
what will happen to you?

00:20:12.633 --> 00:20:15.717
I mean, you'll all get boils in the body.

00:20:16.759 --> 00:20:18.842
According to the climate you have to change,

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:20.717
and you enjoy this dress very much

00:20:20.967 --> 00:20:22.509
because it is very comfortable.

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:25.176
You enjoy the river baths, it's very comfortable.

00:20:25.509 --> 00:20:27.509
In this country that suits you better.

00:20:27.717 --> 00:20:30.842
So in the same way this new life that we are entering in,

00:20:31.176 --> 00:20:34.925
we have to understand that the outside is not important

00:20:35.176 --> 00:20:36.717
- the inside is important.

00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:38.967
And for that whatever is to be done outside,

00:20:39.217 --> 00:20:41.426
we have to do it, we have to do it.

00:20:41.634 --> 00:20:43.176
We have to learn it, we have to understand it,

00:20:43.426 --> 00:20:45.384
what is this, what is that.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.176
Now because you are scientists, you are Westerners,

00:20:49.551 --> 00:20:52.509
you have an advantage over Indians I should say,

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:54.301
or in science, all right.

00:20:54.633 --> 00:20:56.426
In this science they have an advantage over you.

00:20:56.634 --> 00:20:58.634
Doesn't matter, it's all right.

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:01.051
They chose this place to come in,

00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:02.717
you chose that place to come in;

00:21:02.967 --> 00:21:04.967
because you're brave people I think, first of all,

00:21:05.384 --> 00:21:08.717
and secondly that you wanted to do some good there maybe.

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:11.384
But for that you must learn.

00:21:11.634 --> 00:21:14.634
Like we say our scientists here are brave people

00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:16.633
that they are trying to learn science,

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:18.551
they want to go abroad and learn about it

00:21:18.842 --> 00:21:20.551
and bring some science to us.

00:21:20.842 --> 00:21:24.509
In the same way now you are the ambassadors

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.800
from all these countries, of divinity,

00:21:27.176 --> 00:21:29.800
ambassadors of divinity. You have to carry divinity,

00:21:30.092 --> 00:21:33.051
because it has been worked out in this country.

00:21:33.301 --> 00:21:35.717
As you can see clearly it is so, accept it;

00:21:35.967 --> 00:21:37.925
there's nothing to feel bad about it.

00:21:38.092 --> 00:21:40.217
Because you're attached to a certain nationality

00:21:40.426 --> 00:21:42.551
and all that you think, there's nothing to feel bad.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.092
In India people feel very proud

00:21:44.384 --> 00:21:47.176
if they have to go abroad to learn science.

00:21:47.634 --> 00:21:49.384
Even if they are vegetarians,

00:21:49.634 --> 00:21:51.509
they don't mind doing biology dissection

00:21:51.717 --> 00:21:54.426
or anything because it is science, it is knowledge.

00:21:54.633 --> 00:21:57.259
So for knowledge's sake you have to do all these things.

00:21:57.509 --> 00:21:59.426
And once you realize that for knowledge's sake

00:21:59.634 --> 00:22:04.092
you are working it out, it's going to help you a lot.

00:22:05.384 --> 00:22:09.051
This one, this today's puja, it has a special meaning

00:22:09.301 --> 00:22:11.717
because yesterday was Datta Jayanti,

00:22:12.051 --> 00:22:16.509
means the birth of Dattatreya.

00:22:18.092 --> 00:22:19.842
And you know the story of Dattatreya,

00:22:20.176 --> 00:22:21.717
most of you know the story of Dattatreya,

00:22:22.051 --> 00:22:25.967
that Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha tried to take a test

00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:30.842
of Adi Shakti, called Anasuya.

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:37.092
They came to Her place and asked Her for alms.

00:22:37.384 --> 00:22:40.051
And it's supposed to be a great privilege in India

00:22:40.384 --> 00:22:42.426
to give alms to others,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.426
to - I mean, it's a great privilege to attend to guests,

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.092
it's a great privilege to be generous,

00:22:50.426 --> 00:22:53.551
it's a great privilege to distribute things to others.

00:22:53.842 --> 00:22:54.717
It's a great privilege.

00:22:54.967 --> 00:22:57.967
Like yesterday, you see, My sari for this puja

00:22:58.301 --> 00:22:59.426
was left somewhere out.

00:22:59.675 --> 00:23:02.634
So I had bought a sari for some lady here, so she said,

00:23:02.925 --> 00:23:05.551
"I would like this sari to be presented at the puja."

00:23:05.842 --> 00:23:06.967
But I said, "I'll return it you."

00:23:07.176 --> 00:23:08.717
She said, "That's a greater privilege, too."

00:23:08.967 --> 00:23:10.634
They didn't mind the sari was left out,

00:23:10.925 --> 00:23:13.551
they said it's a greater privilege - the attitude.

00:23:13.842 --> 00:23:15.259
So the attitude is to be changed,

00:23:15.509 --> 00:23:16.842
that so far we are going downward,

00:23:17.092 --> 00:23:18.925
now the attitude should be upward.

00:23:19.259 --> 00:23:21.551
And for that, we have to understand

00:23:21.925 --> 00:23:24.551
the method by which we are going to climb up.

00:23:24.842 --> 00:23:26.259
Like you have to go to the mountains,

00:23:26.509 --> 00:23:28.426
you must know how to do the mountaineering.

00:23:28.717 --> 00:23:32.051
You cannot just state yourself, "Now I'm going to Himalayas"

00:23:32.384 --> 00:23:34.301
- nobody will allow you.

00:23:34.675 --> 00:23:37.092
So one has to qualify, and in qualifying

00:23:37.426 --> 00:23:40.092
you have to have that humility, otherwise it won't work out.

00:23:40.426 --> 00:23:43.259
So I have to make a very clear statement,

00:23:43.509 --> 00:23:46.092
that you change your nationality

00:23:46.426 --> 00:23:49.925
from the worldly nationality to the heavenly nationality.

00:23:50.176 --> 00:23:52.675
And there, whatever is needed we'll be doing it,

00:23:52.967 --> 00:23:55.551
we'll be accepting it, we'll be managing it.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.675
For that you don't have to change anything like that,

00:23:59.925 --> 00:24:04.967
but you have to transform yourself into a new personality;

00:24:05.551 --> 00:24:08.551
new personality, where you are safe.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.051
Now just see, putting on that, how much Agnya has come down

00:24:12.301 --> 00:24:13.301
- just see.

00:24:13.509 --> 00:24:17.176
My foot was paralyzed, absolutely paralyzed when I walked in.

00:24:17.551 --> 00:24:20.800
I couldn't walk. I didn't know how I was going to take bath.

00:24:21.051 --> 00:24:23.092
I had to massage it, and then it came down.

00:24:23.509 --> 00:24:27.800
So just see putting that, just see that, how powerful it is.

00:24:34.675 --> 00:24:37.967
See - vibrations started flowing.

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:49.384
But people are somehow in the West very much frightened

00:24:49.675 --> 00:24:52.176
that they will lose their nationality.

00:24:52.509 --> 00:24:56.551
I mean, because - I feel, because the way they went all out

00:24:56.925 --> 00:24:58.675
to destroy all the world and to destroy them,

00:24:58.925 --> 00:25:01.384
and put their own nationality on others.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.176
If you go to America - like yesterday I said,

00:25:05.426 --> 00:25:07.675
"Thank God Columbus did not go to India,

00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:11.925
he went …" I said, "Thank God, Hanumana pushed him

00:25:12.134 --> 00:25:14.259
on the other side.

00:25:14.925 --> 00:25:17.675
Otherwise we all would have been finished here, this … "

00:25:17.925 --> 00:25:19.717
You see, poor man, he didn't want to do all that,

00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:21.967
but all those followed him just went and finished.

00:25:22.259 --> 00:25:24.259
You can't find one aboriginal,

00:25:24.509 --> 00:25:28.259
one person from those old Indians in Argentina.

00:25:28.551 --> 00:25:30.051
I went to Argentina and they said,

00:25:30.301 --> 00:25:32.800
"In the museum you can find them"- just imagine.

00:25:33.092 --> 00:25:36.092
Not only Argentina but also other places,

00:25:36.509 --> 00:25:40.384
like I went to Chile: not a single person.

00:25:40.675 --> 00:25:44.051
Only in Bolivia I found some of them, that's all.

00:25:44.384 --> 00:25:46.092
But it is such a mixture there too,

00:25:46.426 --> 00:25:48.176
because I think the people ran away to the hills

00:25:48.551 --> 00:25:49.800
and managed themselves.

00:25:50.134 --> 00:25:53.301
And whatever picture they have put about them,

00:25:53.633 --> 00:25:54.842
as if they are the cruel.

00:25:55.176 --> 00:25:57.259
Poor things, they have been all killed

00:25:57.551 --> 00:26:00.633
absolutely by white men, no doubt about it.

00:26:00.967 --> 00:26:03.800
It's horrible to go and kill others, go into their land,

00:26:04.092 --> 00:26:06.551
occupy it because you have got machinery, everything,

00:26:06.842 --> 00:26:08.675
you can kill all of them.

00:26:09.509 --> 00:26:10.675
All this has been done.

00:26:10.967 --> 00:26:14.717
Now we are entering into a new era where we have to love.

00:26:15.134 --> 00:26:18.384
We don't have to aggress, we have to embrace.

00:26:21.551 --> 00:26:23.551
This is another era altogether.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.925
That aggression of Napoleon is over now.

00:26:27.301 --> 00:26:29.633
It's a new thing we have started, into another world,

00:26:29.842 --> 00:26:32.509
when we have to get more people,

00:26:34.051 --> 00:26:35.967
we have to synthesize the whole thing.

00:26:36.384 --> 00:26:38.842
And when you aggress, you start analyzing

00:26:39.384 --> 00:26:40.925
- nothing to analyze.

00:26:41.259 --> 00:26:43.426
Are you feeling better now?

00:26:44.176 --> 00:26:45.633
Put on little bigger one.

00:26:45.925 --> 00:26:47.717
See, you have a big forehead, then put on big,

00:26:48.051 --> 00:26:50.176
the very big - why do you put the little, small one?

00:26:50.426 --> 00:26:51.967
… on her head.

00:26:52.301 --> 00:26:54.551
Fashion should not be done in these things.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.134
There should be no fashioning

00:26:56.426 --> 00:26:59.551
as far as your religious duties are concerned,

00:26:59.842 --> 00:27:02.967
you should not. There is nothing like fashion.

00:27:04.259 --> 00:27:09.259
Fashion is a human affair, it's not divine.

00:27:10.633 --> 00:27:13.301
Look at these trees, how do they fashion themselves?

00:27:13.593 --> 00:27:17.717
Towards the sun. Every leaf is exposed to the sun,

00:27:18.051 --> 00:27:21.633
every leaf; because it has to get chlorophyll,

00:27:21.925 --> 00:27:25.176
it has to get the power of the sun in itself,

00:27:25.509 --> 00:27:27.800
so the every leaf is towards the sun.

00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:30.134
They don't do any fashions, do they?

00:27:30.509 --> 00:27:32.551
So another point is the individualism

00:27:32.842 --> 00:27:35.633
that is started in the West is nonsense.

00:27:36.259 --> 00:27:38.675
To show off that "I'm something different,"

00:27:39.051 --> 00:27:41.176
you become stupid.

00:27:41.633 --> 00:27:43.967
But to be one with everyone

00:27:44.301 --> 00:27:46.842
is the real individualism, I think.

00:27:48.176 --> 00:27:51.176
To be like everyone is the best.

00:27:51.675 --> 00:27:54.509
It's very difficult, it's very difficult

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.633
to become one with everyone, because ego is so much.

00:27:57.925 --> 00:28:00.176
Some people have ego which hurts others,

00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:04.051
and some have whose ego is hurt - both just the same.

00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:06.134
So to overcome all these things,

00:28:06.426 --> 00:28:10.301
forget about that kind of attitude of descending downward.

00:28:10.593 --> 00:28:12.800
But for the ascent whatever is required

00:28:13.134 --> 00:28:16.925
is you look upward to God, look upward to Him

00:28:17.301 --> 00:28:21.800
with complete faith - shraddha.

00:28:22.134 --> 00:28:26.051
Then I don't have to touch you, you need not see Me.

00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:31.384
It exists everywhere, you can get the blessings everywhere.

00:28:31.675 --> 00:28:34.426
You don't have to do anything special for it

00:28:34.717 --> 00:28:36.176
- just that shraddha.

00:28:36.426 --> 00:28:39.009
But for that, certain mechanisms are to be put right,

00:28:39.176 --> 00:28:42.593
specially the Agnya needs repairs, quite a lot.

00:28:43.925 --> 00:28:47.509
That wheel is out of gear, and that must be put right.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.551
Mr. Patankar was yesterday was rather angry

00:28:50.842 --> 00:28:52.633
with the so-called educated people.

00:28:52.925 --> 00:28:55.301
They are educated in English language, that's the problem,

00:28:55.717 --> 00:28:57.509
the language is like that.

00:28:57.925 --> 00:28:59.092
They think no end of themselves.

00:28:59.384 --> 00:29:00.551
He said, "They didn't touch Your feet."

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.092
If they learn English language they will not touch My feet,

00:29:04.717 --> 00:29:07.092
because in English language touching the feet

00:29:07.384 --> 00:29:10.384
is regarded as something horrible, I think.

00:29:12.384 --> 00:29:14.301
That's why he felt very sad about it.

00:29:14.633 --> 00:29:16.842
But this is all architecture has come from England,

00:29:17.092 --> 00:29:19.967
everything has come from Germany or from France.

00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:22.384
Our telephones have come from France.

00:29:22.717 --> 00:29:25.259
No wonder they work like this!

00:29:26.384 --> 00:29:28.259
It's all the French who brought this,

00:29:28.509 --> 00:29:30.259
and again they have got a big - I don't know,

00:29:30.509 --> 00:29:32.384
if I meet Rajiv Gandhi I'll tell him

00:29:32.633 --> 00:29:35.051
that at least don't give telephones to French.

00:29:35.301 --> 00:29:40.717
They has given such a big, very big order to the French.

00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:43.842
And now the helicopters they are buying from England,

00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:45.051
thank God they've stopped it.

00:29:45.343 --> 00:29:46.925
God knows what will happen to the helicopters,

00:29:47.176 --> 00:29:49.176
coming down in India from England.

00:29:49.426 --> 00:29:52.051
Like that you see they now are depending on the Third World

00:29:52.217 --> 00:29:53.967
for their progress, because they don't know

00:29:54.217 --> 00:29:55.509
where to send their own things

00:29:55.717 --> 00:29:56.967
which are created by their machines.

00:29:57.301 --> 00:29:59.633
But the way they do it: I mean, just imagine

00:29:59.842 --> 00:30:02.551
the kind of phones we have here, all done by French,

00:30:02.759 --> 00:30:05.301
not Indians. Why blame the Indians for that?

00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:07.884
Is done by the French, horrid, they have been like this

00:30:08.134 --> 00:30:11.384
since long, and they are just the same.

00:30:11.593 --> 00:30:14.675
And again now we have given order to the French,

00:30:15.009 --> 00:30:16.675
because we thought only French can cure

00:30:17.009 --> 00:30:18.509
the French telephones.

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.259
I don't know what they are going to do

00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:22.134
any justice to us or not.

00:30:22.384 --> 00:30:26.384
So, as that machine is to be worked out,

00:30:26.675 --> 00:30:29.176
our own machine is to be worked out;

00:30:29.633 --> 00:30:32.633
and that machine is gone downward.

00:30:32.925 --> 00:30:37.384
Let us raise it up, upward towards God in surrender,

00:30:37.675 --> 00:30:41.800
in understanding, because you are specially chosen people

00:30:42.259 --> 00:30:43.717
in that area.

00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:46.884
Like the lotuses you have to come out of the mud,

00:30:47.176 --> 00:30:50.384
and don't imbed yourself in the mud more and more.

00:30:50.675 --> 00:30:52.800
Try to push yourself out of that,

00:30:53.051 --> 00:30:56.384
so that the fragrance of divinity will spread in that mud,

00:30:56.633 --> 00:31:00.800
and make the whole of that Western world a beautiful place,

00:31:01.134 --> 00:31:02.259
beautiful place.

00:31:02.509 --> 00:31:04.384
Whatever has been done is done.

00:31:04.717 --> 00:31:06.884
I know one thing: without forgiveness,

00:31:07.176 --> 00:31:09.675
nothing is going to work out. Done is done.

00:31:09.925 --> 00:31:13.717
Erring is human, doesn't matter; whatever is done is done.

00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:15.884
Whatever they have done is done.

00:31:16.176 --> 00:31:17.593
It's all right, forgive them.

00:31:17.884 --> 00:31:20.759
Forgiveness is the only way they can come up.

00:31:21.176 --> 00:31:25.384
And when they are forgiven, they have to also realize now

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.800
that we have to rise;

00:31:28.343 --> 00:31:30.051
because the world they have created

00:31:30.384 --> 00:31:34.176
has really ruined themselves.

00:31:34.593 --> 00:31:37.633
If they rise now the whole place can become fragrant,

00:31:37.925 --> 00:31:42.009
as I told you, like the lotus that comes out of the mud.

00:31:42.343 --> 00:31:44.884
It's a very wrong idea people have here about the West,

00:31:45.176 --> 00:31:47.717
that you are the happiest people living around.

00:31:48.176 --> 00:31:51.884
So it is better that we

00:31:54.633 --> 00:31:57.675
tell them that "No, we are not happy there."

00:31:58.009 --> 00:32:00.675
You, what you have got is something precious.

00:32:00.925 --> 00:32:02.343
They also try to follow you,

00:32:02.675 --> 00:32:04.675
and that following is going so far

00:32:04.925 --> 00:32:06.633
that maybe one day you will have to come

00:32:06.884 --> 00:32:08.717
and teach them Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:09.009 --> 00:32:11.009
Because they are on the other side of the circle;

00:32:11.259 --> 00:32:12.675
they are now trying to learn English,

00:32:12.925 --> 00:32:15.675
master English language, and becoming sahibs.

00:32:15.925 --> 00:32:17.343
They will come out with tailcoats,

00:32:17.633 --> 00:32:20.675
and you'll have to tell them that better wear your dresses!

00:32:22.633 --> 00:32:27.384
So we should be wise, we should be sensible,

00:32:27.925 --> 00:32:30.468
and the stupidity and the silly temperament

00:32:30.759 --> 00:32:32.593
that we have developed, we should give up.

00:32:32.925 --> 00:32:34.633
Suddenly people bubble out, I see that.

00:32:34.925 --> 00:32:36.884
You see, there's no balance.

00:32:37.176 --> 00:32:40.259
The maturity shows when you have a balance.

00:32:40.468 --> 00:32:41.675
You should be happy, I know;

00:32:42.009 --> 00:32:44.134
but all the time smiling, putting up a show,

00:32:44.468 --> 00:32:46.925
or sort of suddenly coming out with funny remarks

00:32:47.176 --> 00:32:49.675
and silly remarks shows you are not matured enough.

00:32:49.925 --> 00:32:50.884
You have to mature.

00:32:51.134 --> 00:32:54.593
In Sahaja Yoga you mature, and if you do not mature

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.384
then Sahaja Yoga has done no good to you.

00:32:57.426 --> 00:33:00.009
So you have to be very, very careful about that part.

00:33:03.551 --> 00:33:05.759
I hope I've been able to tell you all about it.

00:33:06.009 --> 00:33:07.176
Now what should I tell you ?

00:33:07.967 --> 00:33:09.633
I was just praising you,

00:33:09.925 --> 00:33:11.967
just praising you in front of others.

00:33:12.593 --> 00:33:14.426
I tell them not to behave like stupid people,

00:33:14.633 --> 00:33:15.800
and for you I must tell you

00:33:16.051 --> 00:33:19.717
that you need not blindly imitate them.

00:33:20.842 --> 00:33:23.134
Whatever we have got is a very great heritage.

00:33:23.384 --> 00:33:24.842
It should be carefully maintained.

00:33:25.092 --> 00:33:28.301
By looking at these people, if we try to imitate them

00:33:28.551 --> 00:33:29.884
it will be a foolish behavior on our part.

00:33:30.092 --> 00:33:35.551
Their life is not balanced but has gone to extremes.

00:33:36.301 --> 00:33:38.551
I have stayed there for twelve years.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.759
Thus I have spent a TUP (twelve years)

00:33:41.051 --> 00:33:42.675
so I just wanted to tell you

00:33:42.925 --> 00:33:45.009
that you should not blindly follow them.

00:33:46.009 --> 00:33:50.009
Though old is gold, whatever is oldish  is not good.

00:33:50.259 --> 00:33:52.051
So oldish is not good.

00:33:52.301 --> 00:33:56.675
The concept of oldish has also come recently.

00:33:57.343 --> 00:33:59.967
For example, from the Muslims we have learnt to harass the women,

00:34:00.217 --> 00:34:02.593
from the English we have learnt to give dowry.

00:34:03.259 --> 00:34:07.468
Now we have entered a new rules (of life)

00:34:07.634 --> 00:34:11.800
and in these new rules we need not give dowry

00:34:12.092 --> 00:34:13.633
(to our daughters who are married).

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:15.134
The daughters have been given half the property.

00:34:15.426 --> 00:34:16.468
This system is correct.

00:34:16.717 --> 00:34:18.426
But here the daughters will not take, and neither give.

00:34:23.509 --> 00:34:26.800
Thus we should not learn these things from them.

00:34:27.134 --> 00:34:30.633
We should keep to our behavior of remaining humble,

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.759
to lead a balanced life as taught to us by our ancestors,

00:34:33.009 --> 00:34:35.134
and discard whatever is oldish.

00:34:35.343 --> 00:34:36.800
There are many oldish customs lingering in us.

00:34:37.092 --> 00:34:38.717
For example, the domination of Brahmins in the temples

00:34:39.009 --> 00:34:40.593
has to be given up.

00:34:40.842 --> 00:34:42.176
They all have nicely fooled us.

00:34:42.468 --> 00:34:44.426
Secondly, the custom of fasting  has to be given up.

00:34:44.717 --> 00:34:46.384
I've told you hundred of times not to fast,

00:34:46.633 --> 00:34:48.301
but eat whatever is needed for the body,

00:34:48.551 --> 00:34:50.301
but people tell Me that "we cannot give up fasting."

00:34:50.551 --> 00:34:52.092
But the worst oldish, very dirty habit we have acquired

00:34:52.384 --> 00:34:53.426
is consuming tobacco.

00:34:53.675 --> 00:34:55.343
We are not able to give up tobacco,

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:56.884
because we do not have enough strength .

00:34:59.092 --> 00:35:01.134
Tobacco, mishri (chewing tobacco with lime),

00:35:01.384 --> 00:35:02.884
who has brought these things to our country?

00:35:03.176 --> 00:35:04.967
From where did the word "tobacco"  come?

00:35:05.259 --> 00:35:07.217
There was no word for tambakou in Sanskrit language.

00:35:08.551 --> 00:35:10.176
We did not cultivate tobacco earlier.

00:35:10.468 --> 00:35:11.633
It is the English who have brought it to our country.

00:35:15.343 --> 00:35:16.884
The English have brought it here.

00:35:17.842 --> 00:35:19.634
That's why we call it tambakou,

00:35:19.967 --> 00:35:21.633
which has come from the word tobacco.

00:35:21.884 --> 00:35:26.009
Where is the word tambakou in our Marathi language?

00:35:26.301 --> 00:35:28.259
It has been brought here from outside.

00:35:28.509 --> 00:35:34.259
Initially the Muslims cultivated it to some extent in our country,

00:35:34.468 --> 00:35:36.675
but these people (English) have brought cigarette

00:35:36.925 --> 00:35:38.925
and other things here on a large scale.

00:35:39.217 --> 00:35:41.426
They use it on a mass scale in their country.

00:35:41.675 --> 00:35:46.092
They have also exported tobacco and ganja (sort of a drug) to China.

00:35:46.343 --> 00:35:48.509
In our Marathi language I never heard of the word ganja

00:35:48.675 --> 00:35:50.301
and charras (another sort of drug).

00:35:51.509 --> 00:35:54.634
If you try to consume ganja  and charras

00:35:55.343 --> 00:35:57.134
you will become like the English.

00:35:57.426 --> 00:35:58.759
It's up to you to decide.

00:36:01.633 --> 00:36:03.717
Thus whatever is given to us.

00:36:04.009 --> 00:36:06.259
We never had tobacco in our country, you'll be surprised.

00:36:06.551 --> 00:36:09.009
There's no word for tobacco in Sanskrit language.

00:36:09.759 --> 00:36:13.051
This was brought partly, of course, partly I should say,

00:36:13.343 --> 00:36:15.259
by the Muslims and then by the

00:36:15.633 --> 00:36:20.343
- the smoking was taught to us only by English.

00:36:20.593 --> 00:36:22.925
We didn't know that, what was smoking,

00:36:23.259 --> 00:36:25.009
we never knew smoking business.

00:36:25.217 --> 00:36:26.925
Muslims did have a little bit of it,

00:36:27.259 --> 00:36:29.800
but that started quite late.

00:36:30.217 --> 00:36:32.259
But actually this cigarette and this,

00:36:32.509 --> 00:36:34.384
all this has started after the English came in,

00:36:34.633 --> 00:36:36.384
"making it handy," you see.

00:36:36.759 --> 00:36:38.051
They used to have hookahs.

00:36:38.384 --> 00:36:40.468
That was rather difficult to make,

00:36:40.759 --> 00:36:42.509
so they could do it only very little bit.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.800
It was a long time back in the Islamic culture.

00:36:46.134 --> 00:36:49.176
But the real, this cigarette business, this ego business

00:36:49.509 --> 00:36:51.593
has come from the English, no doubt about it.

00:36:51.842 --> 00:36:54.675
And the Portuguese, Portuguese and the French,

00:36:55.009 --> 00:36:56.384
they taught us all these things.

00:36:56.633 --> 00:36:57.925
So what I'm trying to tell them,

00:36:58.134 --> 00:37:01.009
that whatever is oldish should be given up.

00:37:01.301 --> 00:37:02.633
Whatever is old is gold,

00:37:02.925 --> 00:37:05.426
but whatever is oldish that we call as junnat,

00:37:05.634 --> 00:37:06.967
should be given up.

00:37:10.343 --> 00:37:15.593
We have the custom of wearing saris with thick borders.

00:37:15.842 --> 00:37:17.009
This is a very good custom.

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.468
Thick borders symbolizes maryadas,

00:37:19.634 --> 00:37:21.092
and when we wear saris with thick borders

00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:22.301
we stay in our maryadas.

00:37:22.551 --> 00:37:24.884
Young girls can dress up whatever way they like,

00:37:25.134 --> 00:37:26.675
but young women, specially married women,

00:37:26.967 --> 00:37:28.384
should wear saris with thick borders.

00:37:28.634 --> 00:37:30.884
If you give up wearing saris with thick borders

00:37:31.134 --> 00:37:35.884
then you will lose all the art, all the art.

00:37:36.217 --> 00:37:39.259
Weavers will lose all the art of weaving.

00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:42.551
If we do not construct our houses as per the old style,

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.634
then we will lose all the ancient art of building beautiful houses.

00:37:47.009 --> 00:37:51.593
These people like our houses built on the old style,

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:54.426
not the new style.

00:37:55.259 --> 00:37:57.009
The reason is that the old style has got beauty in it,

00:37:57.301 --> 00:38:00.675
and which might be lost if we built houses anyhow.

00:38:00.884 --> 00:38:02.343
Even the earlier huts were much better.

00:38:03.967 --> 00:38:05.634
Instead of this

00:38:05.967 --> 00:38:07.551
occurring at a later stage,

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.217
once we lose all the art in the future it'll be too late.

00:38:09.509 --> 00:38:11.925
Thus whatever is our ancient art has to be preserved,

00:38:12.176 --> 00:38:13.468
since it has beauty in it.

00:38:13.759 --> 00:38:17.468
For example we have … type of saris which are called bugdya,

00:38:17.675 --> 00:38:20.633
nowadays the women do not even know the names of these saris.

00:38:20.842 --> 00:38:24.343
That's why we should always use the saris

00:38:24.593 --> 00:38:27.509
which have been woven by us. They are good.

00:38:27.717 --> 00:38:31.217
I think saris with thick borders suit better for the married women.

00:38:31.468 --> 00:38:33.509
If the saris do not have thick borders, it does not suit them.

00:38:33.717 --> 00:38:35.842
Married women should always wear saris with thick borders.

00:38:36.675 --> 00:38:39.176
It is not an oldish custom, but is a very beautiful custom.

00:38:39.426 --> 00:38:42.384
It looks nice, it matches with the women, it looks graceful,

00:38:42.633 --> 00:38:45.800
it has got a look of a well-bred woman.

00:38:46.051 --> 00:38:48.717
It is our culture, which we should not abandon

00:38:48.967 --> 00:38:50.426
and become like them (English).

00:38:52.134 --> 00:38:53.593
We should not try to acquire their culture,

00:38:53.759 --> 00:38:55.301
because our culture is very great.

00:38:55.593 --> 00:38:57.051
If we pave our way by understanding

00:38:57.343 --> 00:38:59.343
what has gone wrong with their culture,

00:38:59.633 --> 00:39:01.509
then we can progress well.

00:39:01.759 --> 00:39:03.343
We can accept their progress in science,

00:39:03.634 --> 00:39:05.759
but in doing so if we lose our cultural heritage

00:39:06.051 --> 00:39:08.301
then we will become like them.

00:39:08.593 --> 00:39:10.343
They kill their children.

00:39:10.593 --> 00:39:12.925
Husband and wife cannot stay together even for two years.

00:39:13.259 --> 00:39:17.217
All of them stay in orphanages, waiting for death to come.

00:39:19.343 --> 00:39:22.675
In our society we have to preserve our goodness and kindness.

00:39:22.925 --> 00:39:25.426
Instead of that, we have acquired whatever is wrong with others.

00:39:25.633 --> 00:39:27.176
First we had learnt from the Muslims,

00:39:27.426 --> 00:39:28.842
and now we are learning from these people.

00:39:29.092 --> 00:39:31.009
If we absorb the dirt from them,

00:39:32.176 --> 00:39:34.384
how can our houses remain clean?

00:39:34.634 --> 00:39:36.759
We were supposed to be clean and well-mannerly people,

00:39:37.009 --> 00:39:37.967
and now we have acquired many wrong things from others.

00:39:38.259 --> 00:39:40.009
Thus we have to abandon these things and cleanse ourselves.

00:39:45.259 --> 00:39:46.925
Now, I've told them what is the importance of puja

00:39:47.176 --> 00:39:48.468
but you know these things,

00:39:48.717 --> 00:39:50.009
so I did not explain it to you.

00:39:50.301 --> 00:39:52.426
But in puja one should have shraddha,

00:39:52.675 --> 00:39:54.634
and we should not quarrel during the puja.

00:39:54.967 --> 00:39:57.009
It does not matter who does the puja

00:39:57.301 --> 00:39:59.925
since everyone is equally benefited from it,

00:39:59.925 --> 00:40:01.593
depending upon the shraddha you have,

00:40:02.633 --> 00:40:04.259
depending upon the shraddha you have.

00:40:06.605 --> 00:40:09.605
Your pitchers will be filled up as much you have the shraddha.

00:40:10.509 --> 00:40:13.343
I would say for the ladies, can come and sit here this side

00:40:13.633 --> 00:40:16.509
a little bit. It's very hot for you. Move forward.

00:40:16.675 --> 00:40:20.134
Specially people who are so hot should not sit that side.

00:40:21.675 --> 00:40:22.675
Better sit ….

00:40:22.759 --> 00:40:25.051
Please let those ladies sit this side.

00:40:25.343 --> 00:40:27.633
They cannot bear the sun. Let them sit here.

00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:28.842
They are our guests.

00:40:29.217 --> 00:40:31.551
Come along, this side.

00:40:34.925 --> 00:40:38.176
If you had put something there, you could have managed it.

00:40:42.925 --> 00:40:44.884
Little bit also one must understand,

00:40:45.134 --> 00:40:46.468
that they are doing everything.

00:40:46.675 --> 00:40:48.593
We must also do something about it.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.468
Everything they arrange, we just come

00:40:50.759 --> 00:40:53.426
and sit down like gods; it's not a good thing, is it?

00:40:53.967 --> 00:40:55.717
You could have - such a long time was there,

00:40:56.051 --> 00:40:58.176
why didn't you put something there to protect yourselves?

00:40:58.426 --> 00:41:00.134
It's not difficult.

00:41:04.468 --> 00:41:06.717
Now for these. You come this side also.

00:41:06.967 --> 00:41:08.634
You can come this side. Come along.

00:41:08.842 --> 00:41:10.967
Please give them place to sit.

00:41:11.217 --> 00:41:14.717
Come along. You get up from there. Hello - you get up,

00:41:14.967 --> 00:41:17.633
three of you. Come this side.

00:41:20.967 --> 00:41:23.051
The ladies who are in the - no, you are all right, I think.

00:41:23.301 --> 00:41:25.800
Are you all right, are you? All right, behind you.

00:41:27.925 --> 00:41:29.675
Behind you these people can come this side,

00:41:30.009 --> 00:41:31.717
a little bit move this side.

00:41:32.593 --> 00:41:36.343
Not in the sun, they are already in the sun.

00:41:38.343 --> 00:41:41.634
If we make some shade on this side …

00:41:43.925 --> 00:41:46.176
Is it all right?

00:41:46.759 --> 00:41:49.426
Let them sit. There is shade on the other side,

00:41:49.759 --> 00:41:51.717
there is shade. Sit in the front where there is shade.

00:41:52.092 --> 00:41:53.593
Please have a seat.

00:41:54.134 --> 00:41:55.800
Hello - you come this side.

00:41:56.092 --> 00:41:58.092
There is place for you here.

00:41:58.384 --> 00:42:00.634
Come here, this side. This side you come along.

00:42:00.884 --> 00:42:03.634
Ladies need not go there, so come along this side.

00:42:03.925 --> 00:42:05.468
Let them sit.

00:42:05.884 --> 00:42:08.468
The men can come this side.

00:42:13.759 --> 00:42:16.134
Yes, the men can come this side.

00:42:16.384 --> 00:42:18.925
No, no, you'd better come this side.

00:42:19.884 --> 00:42:23.009
Why don't you move this side a little bit?

00:42:30.217 --> 00:42:32.551
Also we must think what we can arrange,

00:42:32.759 --> 00:42:33.800
what we can help them.

00:42:34.134 --> 00:42:37.092
Like yesterday, how they managed, arranged - when I went,

00:42:37.343 --> 00:42:38.675
they did not know I was going to the thing.

00:42:38.925 --> 00:42:40.925
When I came back, how they arranged for Me,

00:42:41.259 --> 00:42:42.217
how they were running.

00:42:42.509 --> 00:42:45.092
I mean, I'm also your Mother, am I not?

00:42:45.551 --> 00:42:48.134
Then we should think about these things,

00:42:50.009 --> 00:42:54.800
what we can do, how we can help them; everybody should.

00:42:55.633 --> 00:42:57.343
Just leave it, leave it just like that.

00:42:57.717 --> 00:42:59.551
Since they have not made any arrangements

00:42:59.842 --> 00:43:01.301
what can be done, let them sit as they are.

00:43:01.759 --> 00:43:04.509
You can move a little bit this side.

00:43:07.384 --> 00:43:10.925
Hello - you move this side a little bit.

00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:15.092
You can also move a little bit.

00:43:15.343 --> 00:43:17.884
I don't want you to get into sun, you'll have trouble.

00:43:19.426 --> 00:43:22.884
No, but they can move the sound equipment a little this side.

00:43:23.259 --> 00:43:25.759
Just move it, a little bit ….

00:43:43.468 --> 00:43:45.884
As soon as the sun comes up, you see,

00:43:46.217 --> 00:43:48.884
it will be all right, but still ….

00:43:51.925 --> 00:43:55.509
Just sit in the shade, sit as much as possible in the shade.

00:43:59.301 --> 00:44:02.301
If there is no shade you can sit in the front.

00:44:02.717 --> 00:44:05.967
In the puja it is better to sit in the shade.

00:44:06.551 --> 00:44:10.717
I am always standing in here above you. Do not worry.

00:44:14.406 --> 00:44:16.739
Please sit here in front of Me. It's better to sit in the shade.

00:44:40.675 --> 00:44:47.259
Is there somebody to say the mantras? Please call Gavin.

00:44:50.675 --> 00:44:54.343
Yesterday you didn't come to My feet - you should have.

00:44:56.884 --> 00:44:59.259
Please leave it now, otherwise it'll be late.

00:44:59.633 --> 00:45:02.176
Let them sit in the sun

00:45:02.259 --> 00:45:06.759
Catching on the left Heart and left Swadisthan.

00:45:12.217 --> 00:45:13.551
Yesterday you should have come;

00:45:13.842 --> 00:45:16.551
I mean, you'll be doing in the pujas everything, so …

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.009
Is there somebody here to say the mantras?

00:45:24.967 --> 00:45:28.343
Has Mr. Gholap arrived? Please call him.

00:45:29.468 --> 00:45:31.884
Does he know it?

00:45:33.675 --> 00:45:39.259
It's catching very badly - Heart, left Swadisthan.

00:45:42.925 --> 00:45:45.925
Say Atharva Sheersha. Mr. Gholap has not come.

00:45:54.217 --> 00:45:59.800
Where has Mr. Gholap gone? Has he not come?

00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:04.509
Please call him for doing the puja.

00:46:05.634 --> 00:46:09.384
Please start the puja with the Atharva Sheersha.

00:46:16.925 --> 00:46:19.343
Please start now.
