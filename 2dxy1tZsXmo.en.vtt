05:52.283 --> 05:55.492
Ask her. Natalie, come here.

05:56.492 --> 05:59.242
Join hands with Danya.

06:23.409 --> 06:25.742
Are you all right, Ray, now?

06:31.242 --> 06:33.867
Put kumkum to everyone. Just take that, see,

06:34.158 --> 06:36.283
you can leave that here.

06:37.409 --> 06:40.492
All the ladies, put it on.

07:13.832 --> 07:17.707
Yesterday one boy stood up and asked Me a question,

07:18.217 --> 07:20.593
that "When we are such a yoga bhoomi,

07:21.134 --> 07:23.134
we are such a holy country,

07:23.634 --> 07:26.259
why is it that all the discoveries in the science

07:26.522 --> 07:27.819
are made in the West?"

07:28.015 --> 07:29.681
"Very good question," I said.

07:30.134 --> 07:33.051
I said, "That is the knowledge of the tree,

07:33.259 --> 07:35.384
as I have told you; that's the knowledge of the tree.

07:35.675 --> 07:38.134
And what have they achieved is now the end of it,

07:38.384 --> 07:41.259
and now they want to know the knowledge of the roots.

07:42.217 --> 07:43.634
That's why they are here."

07:44.134 --> 07:45.800
So to know the knowledge of the roots,

07:46.134 --> 07:48.259
first of all we must have humility about it.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.675
We have not known this knowledge yet,

07:51.009 --> 07:54.509
never known what is in the Kingdom of God.

07:54.759 --> 07:58.259
As Krishna has said, this tree grows downward

07:58.925 --> 08:01.925
and the roots are in the brain - clearly.

08:02.509 --> 08:05.509
So it is an ascent to go to the roots,

08:05.800 --> 08:07.009
it's a different style.

08:07.343 --> 08:10.134
Kundalini has to rise upward to go to the roots,

08:10.468 --> 08:13.009
and to enter into the roots

08:15.884 --> 08:19.092
what we have to do is to know about it.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.009
Now all these things, like I said yesterday

08:22.343 --> 08:24.217
that you put on bindi.

08:24.593 --> 08:28.009
Now this is also - thank God,

08:28.217 --> 08:29.800
despite all changes in the Bible,

08:30.092 --> 08:31.134
it's written in the Bible

08:31.468 --> 08:33.468
that you'll be known by the mark you'll be carrying.

08:33.675 --> 08:35.800
Now let's see how many are courageous, even in India,

08:36.092 --> 08:37.343
to carry this mark.

08:37.675 --> 08:39.343
That's why you people catch so fast,

08:39.634 --> 08:41.009
one of the reasons why you people catch.

08:41.343 --> 08:43.343
First of all the eyes are not steady.

08:43.675 --> 08:45.884
You are not used to the steady eyes, you see,

08:46.134 --> 08:47.509
as the Indians have very steady eyes.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.675
They are, from childhood they are taught,

08:50.009 --> 08:51.593
"Where is your attention?"

08:51.925 --> 08:54.593
All the time they are asked, "Where is your attention?"

08:55.343 --> 08:57.884
There are some Western Sahaja yogis standing at the back.

08:58.259 --> 09:00.800
Please give them a chair to sit,

09:01.134 --> 09:04.593
since they are not able to sit on the ground.

09:05.925 --> 09:07.301
So where is your attention?

09:07.717 --> 09:10.842
Now the attention is so disturbed all the time

09:11.301 --> 09:13.092
and that's why you catch very fast,

09:13.426 --> 09:14.967
and when you catch from your eyes,

09:15.301 --> 09:17.051
it goes through your Agnya Chakra.

09:17.384 --> 09:19.633
Now this is the protection of Agnya Chakra;

09:19.842 --> 09:22.551
it's actually the blood of Christ that you wear.

09:22.759 --> 09:24.217
But people must have that courage.

09:24.426 --> 09:26.426
They'll wear a cross, but not this.

09:27.468 --> 09:28.967
In the Western countries it's very difficult

09:29.217 --> 09:31.759
for people to have that much courage to put on this.

09:32.009 --> 09:32.967
They will have excuses,

09:33.217 --> 09:35.301
"Mother, we'll lose our jobs," this, that.

09:35.593 --> 09:37.217
Every sort of an excuse is there.

09:37.551 --> 09:39.468
But if you are courageous people,

09:39.759 --> 09:42.176
then you have to start wearing it some time.

09:42.468 --> 09:45.884
Maybe in the night you start first, then in the daytime.

09:46.593 --> 09:48.551
Slowly, slowly you can creep into it.

09:48.842 --> 09:51.551
That's the only thing I think you people have to wear

09:51.842 --> 09:53.343
- that's important.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.884
That will be a good idea, because you will not catch.

09:56.134 --> 09:58.009
Because you go outside, your attention is outside,

09:58.343 --> 10:01.009
you see what's happening outside, the atmosphere is bad.

10:01.343 --> 10:04.468
Moreover, if you put this on it will not only protect you,

10:04.759 --> 10:07.134
but also protect others.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.551
They will have a new idea.

10:09.842 --> 10:11.717
After all, you will dress up like them,

10:12.009 --> 10:13.634
you are just like them - you have to be.

10:14.092 --> 10:15.343
But you have to protect,

10:15.551 --> 10:17.967
and for protection you have to wear something like that.

10:18.217 --> 10:20.551
I found that when I went first to England

10:20.842 --> 10:23.593
they used to laugh at Me, looking at My red mark.

10:23.884 --> 10:25.717
I mean, if they wear lipsticks it's all right,

10:25.967 --> 10:28.717
even if they are clowns, if they are hippies,

10:28.967 --> 10:32.301
they are punks, it's all right;

10:32.593 --> 10:35.092
but if you wear a proper thing which is scientific,

10:35.468 --> 10:36.468
it's most scientific.

10:36.675 --> 10:38.593
So to understand the science of the roots

10:39.009 --> 10:41.009
you must understand what it means,

10:41.259 --> 10:42.967
why this culture is like this:

10:43.217 --> 10:46.217
because it is more towards the roots,

10:46.800 --> 10:48.593
the movement is not towards the tree.

10:48.884 --> 10:50.634
And the tree, where it has ended up?

10:50.800 --> 10:53.134
Beyond the Mooladhara Chakra.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.593
So now they are returning back.

10:55.884 --> 10:58.259
To go from the leaf to the roots is very difficult,

10:58.593 --> 11:01.634
but to go from the roots to the leaves is easier.

11:03.551 --> 11:06.468
So for this ascent we have to be humble,

11:06.884 --> 11:10.426
to know about the knowledge - knowledge about the roots.

11:10.717 --> 11:14.842
Now why they put on, all of them, is this is the reason,

11:15.551 --> 11:18.759
that to protect your Agnya. First of all there's no entry.

11:19.009 --> 11:23.092
That's why, once an Indian gets realization, he ascends.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.092
He doesn't go on catching again;

11:26.426 --> 11:29.551
I mean, this doesn't happen here.

11:31.176 --> 11:33.301
This is one of the things one has to do.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.217
Now the second thing is the puja.

11:35.551 --> 11:39.634
The puja has its effect on everyone,

11:39.884 --> 11:41.217
but according to your depth;

11:41.551 --> 11:44.092
and that's for that you have to have shraddha, faith.

11:44.343 --> 11:46.176
If your mind is still thinking,

11:46.468 --> 11:48.593
you cannot achieve much in puja.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.884
While for Indians, to attend a puja is the highest.

11:52.176 --> 11:54.217
They don't mind My lecture, anything;

11:54.509 --> 11:55.717
if they miss the program, doesn't matter,

11:55.967 --> 11:57.384
any music program is all right,

11:57.717 --> 12:00.092
any kind of discomfort is all right

12:00.343 --> 12:01.925
- as long as they can attend to puja.

12:02.176 --> 12:03.551
Today people have come

12:03.842 --> 12:06.092
from two hundred to three hundred miles for this puja,

12:06.384 --> 12:08.301
all the way,

12:09.009 --> 12:12.551
because they know this is the knowledge of the roots.

12:12.842 --> 12:14.343
For that you have to do the puja.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.343
If you have to ascend, you have to do it.

12:16.593 --> 12:18.884
But you are still in the same level;

12:19.217 --> 12:23.176
if you are still thinking about the tree style,

12:23.426 --> 12:24.759
then you'll go downward.

12:25.092 --> 12:28.717
To move inward, you have to have all these instruments.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.301
One of them is of puja.

12:31.634 --> 12:35.551
Now for puja, are we prepared?

12:36.634 --> 12:38.176
Are we in that mind,

12:38.426 --> 12:41.176
whatever time it has to start, will start?

12:41.426 --> 12:43.884
First of all, we have tied our watches quite tight.

12:44.176 --> 12:46.717
Thank God, I lost My watch last night!

12:53.551 --> 12:58.884
So now the watches have tied us up so much

12:59.217 --> 13:02.301
that now eleven o'clock puja means eleven o'clock.

13:02.633 --> 13:05.717
It's not like that - it depends on.

13:06.759 --> 13:10.468
It is the natural growth of our being,

13:10.842 --> 13:13.343
it is the natural working of our growing.

13:13.634 --> 13:15.217
When I came here, you'll be amazed,

13:15.468 --> 13:18.343
all My right side was paralyzed, absolutely paralyzed.

13:18.759 --> 13:21.301
Right foot was paralyzed, I just couldn't move My legs,

13:21.551 --> 13:26.343
and all the feet had become like a fossilized stuff,

13:26.634 --> 13:28.717
and I didn't know what was happening.

13:29.176 --> 13:32.717
The reason is, everybody has been thinking too much.

13:33.009 --> 13:35.759
Now the attention should be how we are,

13:36.051 --> 13:39.092
what are we doing about ourselves, that's very important;

13:39.426 --> 13:40.717
how far we have achieved.

13:40.967 --> 13:44.759
But on the contrary, the attention is disturbed

13:44.967 --> 13:48.301
by many things. One of them may be the marriages,

13:48.634 --> 13:50.468
that marriages have to take place,

13:50.759 --> 13:52.343
what's going to happen and all that.

13:52.633 --> 13:55.551
But at puja time it has no meaning.

13:55.759 --> 13:59.633
Nothing has importance than but to develop yourself,

13:59.884 --> 14:00.967
and this is what it is:

14:01.217 --> 14:03.967
at this time you have to develop your roots.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.634
And to develop your roots,

14:05.967 --> 14:08.176
it's a different science altogether.

14:08.633 --> 14:12.633
The another thing is that you can achieve

14:14.551 --> 14:19.009
the movement of the tree by aggressiveness, by aggressing.

14:19.842 --> 14:22.717
But when you aggress in the human mind,

14:22.967 --> 14:26.217
then you are drawn towards the Mooladhara more,

14:26.468 --> 14:29.301
towards the gravity force,

14:29.634 --> 14:31.842
and you go down towards the dead;

14:32.092 --> 14:34.092
the materialism starts coming up.

14:34.343 --> 14:38.301
Because it's upside down, human growth is upside down.

14:38.551 --> 14:41.468
You know the brain is here, not at the feet.

14:42.217 --> 14:44.759
It starts from the brain, the growth starts from the brain;

14:45.009 --> 14:47.633
as you know as doctors that the whole thing is here

14:47.884 --> 14:51.634
and the nerves go down, they do not start from the feet.

14:51.967 --> 14:55.176
So when you start putting your attention to your

14:55.426 --> 14:58.634
outward growth, you go towards materialism automatically.

14:59.051 --> 15:00.967
Then you find matter has nothing to do,

15:01.301 --> 15:04.051
you have fossilized yourself. So then you come back.

15:04.301 --> 15:07.051
Now you have to change your attitude completely

15:07.343 --> 15:08.759
towards this new learning,

15:09.092 --> 15:12.301
and this new learning is that you have to

15:12.634 --> 15:15.551
develop a humble attitude, first of all.

15:15.842 --> 15:19.634
And secondly, what are we going to achieve

15:20.301 --> 15:25.426
in our ascent through learning the different tantra,

15:25.717 --> 15:30.343
the mechanism, the divine mechanism - how to work it out.

15:31.633 --> 15:35.426
The person who is extremely efficient in the other field

15:35.634 --> 15:38.092
might become completely inefficient in this field,

15:38.343 --> 15:44.051
absolutely useless: possessed, aggressive, good for nothing,

15:44.343 --> 15:50.092
hot-tempered, hot-tempered, and also devoid of any love,

15:50.343 --> 15:51.884
affection, compassion.

15:52.092 --> 15:54.842
Like they were shocked to hear

15:55.009 --> 15:57.301
that people kill their children in England,

15:57.551 --> 15:58.634
they couldn't believe it.

15:58.884 --> 16:00.634
They can't believe even one child killed like that.

16:00.842 --> 16:03.009
They think that English are perfect people,

16:03.343 --> 16:04.717
how can they kill their children?

16:05.009 --> 16:07.634
They are very perfect according to Indians.

16:07.884 --> 16:11.634
Indians have no idea as to what kind of life they lead there.

16:12.009 --> 16:13.217
So when I told them,

16:13.468 --> 16:15.634
"You are sadly mistaken, they are very unhappy people.

16:15.967 --> 16:18.675
Don't think that by developing radios and all these things,

16:18.967 --> 16:20.717
they are happy. They are all mad.

16:20.967 --> 16:22.426
They sit before the television,

16:22.634 --> 16:25.842
then they can't do without it, they become televisions.

16:26.092 --> 16:27.717
And the television is exploiting them,

16:27.967 --> 16:29.634
putting wrong ideas into their heads,

16:29.967 --> 16:32.717
and they're brainwashed, they are very conditioned"

16:33.051 --> 16:34.092
- they can't believe it.

16:34.343 --> 16:36.633
They can't believe that people could be that cruel

16:36.842 --> 16:40.633
in the West; because the growth is towards materialism,

16:40.842 --> 16:45.551
so they are becoming gross, insensitive, immoral,

16:45.842 --> 16:50.301
and also devoid of any compassion and love.

16:51.468 --> 16:54.217
So first of all, as I said yesterday you should say,

16:54.426 --> 16:56.633
"I'm not French" - you should say, "I am not a Westerner."

16:56.842 --> 16:59.426
Let's see, that may work out, work out better,

16:59.634 --> 17:02.967
"I'm not a Westerner." Maybe when you enter a university

17:03.176 --> 17:04.759
- supposing you are in Oxford University

17:05.051 --> 17:06.343
and then you go to the Cambridge University,

17:06.551 --> 17:09.884
you have to wear the badge of the Cambridge University.

17:10.176 --> 17:12.884
In the same way now you have changed your nationality,

17:13.176 --> 17:15.633
I think you should say, "I'm not a Westerner now anymore."

17:15.842 --> 17:19.092
Maybe the passport might say anything, doesn't matter.

17:19.842 --> 17:22.633
But you have a special privilege in India as Sahaja yogis,

17:22.842 --> 17:24.717
you know that. As Sahaja yogis the government

17:24.967 --> 17:26.967
has accepted you. If you want to stay here forever,

17:27.301 --> 17:29.842
they'll have no objection.

17:49.092 --> 17:55.884
So this, whatever is now we think works out

17:56.343 --> 17:58.884
on the tree level, has to be changed.

17:59.301 --> 18:02.884
Here everything becomes united, synthesized.

18:03.217 --> 18:06.717
The whole tree is synthesized in a seed.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.634
So if you have to become the root,

18:08.884 --> 18:10.759
you have to come down to the position where,

18:11.051 --> 18:14.717
how to synthesize. Now grouping is a wrong thing.

18:15.051 --> 18:17.551
If you group yourself as English, this, that,

18:17.759 --> 18:19.717
or Indians or anything, is wrong.

18:20.051 --> 18:22.343
In Sahaja Yoga we don't believe in all that.

18:22.633 --> 18:25.092
There is no differentiation

18:25.426 --> 18:27.759
between one Sahaja yogi and another Sahaja yogi,

18:27.967 --> 18:29.426
because it is Vishwa Dharma.

18:29.633 --> 18:31.092
But we say this is Vishwa Dharma,

18:31.426 --> 18:33.633
but we are not out of it as yet,

18:33.759 --> 18:39.509
we are not yet in the same pendal where we should be.

18:39.717 --> 18:42.301
We still separate, we are still different,

18:42.633 --> 18:46.301
we have to still mix up from one country to another country.

18:46.633 --> 18:49.092
We have to all become one with each other,

18:49.343 --> 18:51.634
understanding each other;

18:52.509 --> 18:54.842
then only the problems of the West will go away.

18:55.092 --> 18:58.217
As a result of this right-sided movement

18:58.509 --> 19:01.343
I feel that people are really becoming idiotic.

19:01.634 --> 19:05.759
I categorize them as idiotic or stupid, and all that.

19:06.051 --> 19:07.176
I mean I don't how,

19:07.426 --> 19:09.551
what categories they will fall into later on,

19:09.842 --> 19:12.759
where there have been not such categories before.

19:13.051 --> 19:16.717
I mean, they might form a new dimension of stupidity.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.092
This is what I feel,

19:19.426 --> 19:23.551
that unless and until you now learn about this new yantra,

19:23.842 --> 19:24.842
the new method:

19:25.092 --> 19:27.634
in that you don't see to the physical comfort,

19:27.925 --> 19:30.509
you don't see to the so-called emotional pampering.

19:30.842 --> 19:32.343
All these things you don't see,

19:32.633 --> 19:35.217
but where do you go - into innocence.

19:35.967 --> 19:40.301
The quality of the matter itself is innocence, the essence.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.842
So the quality, I should say,

19:43.092 --> 19:45.551
or the essence of everything you become.

19:45.759 --> 19:46.759
You become the essence.

19:47.092 --> 19:48.634
But for that you have to move inward,

19:48.925 --> 19:51.051
and the inward movement is only possible

19:51.301 --> 19:54.176
when you understand and respect,

19:54.509 --> 20:00.051
and think yourself privileged to be able to do all this.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.633
But you have to understand why I tell you.

20:02.842 --> 20:04.634
I have nothing to gain out of you.

20:04.967 --> 20:07.176
Now one should not think I'm trying to make you Indians,

20:07.426 --> 20:11.092
but supposing you wear here three-piece suit and a tie,

20:11.426 --> 20:12.343
what will happen to you?

20:12.633 --> 20:15.717
I mean, you'll all get boils in the body.

20:16.759 --> 20:18.842
According to the climate you have to change,

20:19.176 --> 20:20.717
and you enjoy this dress very much

20:20.967 --> 20:22.509
because it is very comfortable.

20:22.759 --> 20:25.176
You enjoy the river baths, it's very comfortable.

20:25.509 --> 20:27.509
In this country that suits you better.

20:27.717 --> 20:30.842
So in the same way this new life that we are entering in,

20:31.176 --> 20:34.925
we have to understand that the outside is not important

20:35.176 --> 20:36.717
- the inside is important.

20:36.967 --> 20:38.967
And for that whatever is to be done outside,

20:39.217 --> 20:41.426
we have to do it, we have to do it.

20:41.634 --> 20:43.176
We have to learn it, we have to understand it,

20:43.426 --> 20:45.384
what is this, what is that.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.176
Now because you are scientists, you are Westerners,

20:49.551 --> 20:52.509
you have an advantage over Indians I should say,

20:52.800 --> 20:54.301
or in science, all right.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.426
In this science they have an advantage over you.

20:56.634 --> 20:58.634
Doesn't matter, it's all right.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.051
They chose this place to come in,

21:01.301 --> 21:02.717
you chose that place to come in;

21:02.967 --> 21:04.967
because you're brave people I think, first of all,

21:05.384 --> 21:08.717
and secondly that you wanted to do some good there maybe.

21:09.301 --> 21:11.384
But for that you must learn.

21:11.634 --> 21:14.634
Like we say our scientists here are brave people

21:14.967 --> 21:16.633
that they are trying to learn science,

21:16.842 --> 21:18.551
they want to go abroad and learn about it

21:18.842 --> 21:20.551
and bring some science to us.

21:20.842 --> 21:24.509
In the same way now you are the ambassadors

21:24.800 --> 21:26.800
from all these countries, of divinity,

21:27.176 --> 21:29.800
ambassadors of divinity. You have to carry divinity,

21:30.092 --> 21:33.051
because it has been worked out in this country.

21:33.301 --> 21:35.717
As you can see clearly it is so, accept it;

21:35.967 --> 21:37.925
there's nothing to feel bad about it.

21:38.092 --> 21:40.217
Because you're attached to a certain nationality

21:40.426 --> 21:42.551
and all that you think, there's nothing to feel bad.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.092
In India people feel very proud

21:44.384 --> 21:47.176
if they have to go abroad to learn science.

21:47.634 --> 21:49.384
Even if they are vegetarians,

21:49.634 --> 21:51.509
they don't mind doing biology dissection

21:51.717 --> 21:54.426
or anything because it is science, it is knowledge.

21:54.633 --> 21:57.259
So for knowledge's sake you have to do all these things.

21:57.509 --> 21:59.426
And once you realize that for knowledge's sake

21:59.634 --> 22:04.092
you are working it out, it's going to help you a lot.

22:05.384 --> 22:09.051
This one, this today's puja, it has a special meaning

22:09.301 --> 22:11.717
because yesterday was Datta Jayanti,

22:12.051 --> 22:16.509
means the birth of Dattatreya.

22:18.092 --> 22:19.842
And you know the story of Dattatreya,

22:20.176 --> 22:21.717
most of you know the story of Dattatreya,

22:22.051 --> 22:25.967
that Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha tried to take a test

22:26.259 --> 22:30.842
of Adi Shakti, called Anasuya.

22:32.551 --> 22:37.092
They came to Her place and asked Her for alms.

22:37.384 --> 22:40.051
And it's supposed to be a great privilege in India

22:40.384 --> 22:42.426
to give alms to others,

22:42.800 --> 22:47.426
to - I mean, it's a great privilege to attend to guests,

22:47.800 --> 22:50.092
it's a great privilege to be generous,

22:50.426 --> 22:53.551
it's a great privilege to distribute things to others.

22:53.842 --> 22:54.717
It's a great privilege.

22:54.967 --> 22:57.967
Like yesterday, you see, My sari for this puja

22:58.301 --> 22:59.426
was left somewhere out.

22:59.675 --> 23:02.634
So I had bought a sari for some lady here, so she said,

23:02.925 --> 23:05.551
"I would like this sari to be presented at the puja."

23:05.842 --> 23:06.967
But I said, "I'll return it you."

23:07.176 --> 23:08.717
She said, "That's a greater privilege, too."

23:08.967 --> 23:10.634
They didn't mind the sari was left out,

23:10.925 --> 23:13.551
they said it's a greater privilege - the attitude.

23:13.842 --> 23:15.259
So the attitude is to be changed,

23:15.509 --> 23:16.842
that so far we are going downward,

23:17.092 --> 23:18.925
now the attitude should be upward.

23:19.259 --> 23:21.551
And for that, we have to understand

23:21.925 --> 23:24.551
the method by which we are going to climb up.

23:24.842 --> 23:26.259
Like you have to go to the mountains,

23:26.509 --> 23:28.426
you must know how to do the mountaineering.

23:28.717 --> 23:32.051
You cannot just state yourself, "Now I'm going to Himalayas"

23:32.384 --> 23:34.301
- nobody will allow you.

23:34.675 --> 23:37.092
So one has to qualify, and in qualifying

23:37.426 --> 23:40.092
you have to have that humility, otherwise it won't work out.

23:40.426 --> 23:43.259
So I have to make a very clear statement,

23:43.509 --> 23:46.092
that you change your nationality

23:46.426 --> 23:49.925
from the worldly nationality to the heavenly nationality.

23:50.176 --> 23:52.675
And there, whatever is needed we'll be doing it,

23:52.967 --> 23:55.551
we'll be accepting it, we'll be managing it.

23:55.800 --> 23:59.675
For that you don't have to change anything like that,

23:59.925 --> 24:04.967
but you have to transform yourself into a new personality;

24:05.551 --> 24:08.551
new personality, where you are safe.

24:08.800 --> 24:12.051
Now just see, putting on that, how much Agnya has come down

24:12.301 --> 24:13.301
- just see.

24:13.509 --> 24:17.176
My foot was paralyzed, absolutely paralyzed when I walked in.

24:17.551 --> 24:20.800
I couldn't walk. I didn't know how I was going to take bath.

24:21.051 --> 24:23.092
I had to massage it, and then it came down.

24:23.509 --> 24:27.800
So just see putting that, just see that, how powerful it is.

24:34.675 --> 24:37.967
See - vibrations started flowing.

24:46.051 --> 24:49.384
But people are somehow in the West very much frightened

24:49.675 --> 24:52.176
that they will lose their nationality.

24:52.509 --> 24:56.551
I mean, because - I feel, because the way they went all out

24:56.925 --> 24:58.675
to destroy all the world and to destroy them,

24:58.925 --> 25:01.384
and put their own nationality on others.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.176
If you go to America - like yesterday I said,

25:05.426 --> 25:07.675
"Thank God Columbus did not go to India,

25:07.967 --> 25:11.925
he went …" I said, "Thank God, Hanumana pushed him

25:12.134 --> 25:14.259
on the other side.

25:14.925 --> 25:17.675
Otherwise we all would have been finished here, this … "

25:17.925 --> 25:19.717
You see, poor man, he didn't want to do all that,

25:20.051 --> 25:21.967
but all those followed him just went and finished.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.259
You can't find one aboriginal,

25:24.509 --> 25:28.259
one person from those old Indians in Argentina.

25:28.551 --> 25:30.051
I went to Argentina and they said,

25:30.301 --> 25:32.800
"In the museum you can find them"- just imagine.

25:33.092 --> 25:36.092
Not only Argentina but also other places,

25:36.509 --> 25:40.384
like I went to Chile: not a single person.

25:40.675 --> 25:44.051
Only in Bolivia I found some of them, that's all.

25:44.384 --> 25:46.092
But it is such a mixture there too,

25:46.426 --> 25:48.176
because I think the people ran away to the hills

25:48.551 --> 25:49.800
and managed themselves.

25:50.134 --> 25:53.301
And whatever picture they have put about them,

25:53.633 --> 25:54.842
as if they are the cruel.

25:55.176 --> 25:57.259
Poor things, they have been all killed

25:57.551 --> 26:00.633
absolutely by white men, no doubt about it.

26:00.967 --> 26:03.800
It's horrible to go and kill others, go into their land,

26:04.092 --> 26:06.551
occupy it because you have got machinery, everything,

26:06.842 --> 26:08.675
you can kill all of them.

26:09.509 --> 26:10.675
All this has been done.

26:10.967 --> 26:14.717
Now we are entering into a new era where we have to love.

26:15.134 --> 26:18.384
We don't have to aggress, we have to embrace.

26:21.551 --> 26:23.551
This is another era altogether.

26:23.800 --> 26:26.925
That aggression of Napoleon is over now.

26:27.301 --> 26:29.633
It's a new thing we have started, into another world,

26:29.842 --> 26:32.509
when we have to get more people,

26:34.051 --> 26:35.967
we have to synthesize the whole thing.

26:36.384 --> 26:38.842
And when you aggress, you start analyzing

26:39.384 --> 26:40.925
- nothing to analyze.

26:41.259 --> 26:43.426
Are you feeling better now?

26:44.176 --> 26:45.633
Put on little bigger one.

26:45.925 --> 26:47.717
See, you have a big forehead, then put on big,

26:48.051 --> 26:50.176
the very big - why do you put the little, small one?

26:50.426 --> 26:51.967
… on her head.

26:52.301 --> 26:54.551
Fashion should not be done in these things.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.134
There should be no fashioning

26:56.426 --> 26:59.551
as far as your religious duties are concerned,

26:59.842 --> 27:02.967
you should not. There is nothing like fashion.

27:04.259 --> 27:09.259
Fashion is a human affair, it's not divine.

27:10.633 --> 27:13.301
Look at these trees, how do they fashion themselves?

27:13.593 --> 27:17.717
Towards the sun. Every leaf is exposed to the sun,

27:18.051 --> 27:21.633
every leaf; because it has to get chlorophyll,

27:21.925 --> 27:25.176
it has to get the power of the sun in itself,

27:25.509 --> 27:27.800
so the every leaf is towards the sun.

27:28.051 --> 27:30.134
They don't do any fashions, do they?

27:30.509 --> 27:32.551
So another point is the individualism

27:32.842 --> 27:35.633
that is started in the West is nonsense.

27:36.259 --> 27:38.675
To show off that "I'm something different,"

27:39.051 --> 27:41.176
you become stupid.

27:41.633 --> 27:43.967
But to be one with everyone

27:44.301 --> 27:46.842
is the real individualism, I think.

27:48.176 --> 27:51.176
To be like everyone is the best.

27:51.675 --> 27:54.509
It's very difficult, it's very difficult

27:54.800 --> 27:57.633
to become one with everyone, because ego is so much.

27:57.925 --> 28:00.176
Some people have ego which hurts others,

28:00.509 --> 28:04.051
and some have whose ego is hurt - both just the same.

28:04.509 --> 28:06.134
So to overcome all these things,

28:06.426 --> 28:10.301
forget about that kind of attitude of descending downward.

28:10.593 --> 28:12.800
But for the ascent whatever is required

28:13.134 --> 28:16.925
is you look upward to God, look upward to Him

28:17.301 --> 28:21.800
with complete faith - shraddha.

28:22.134 --> 28:26.051
Then I don't have to touch you, you need not see Me.

28:26.509 --> 28:31.384
It exists everywhere, you can get the blessings everywhere.

28:31.675 --> 28:34.426
You don't have to do anything special for it

28:34.717 --> 28:36.176
- just that shraddha.

28:36.426 --> 28:39.009
But for that, certain mechanisms are to be put right,

28:39.176 --> 28:42.593
specially the Agnya needs repairs, quite a lot.

28:43.925 --> 28:47.509
That wheel is out of gear, and that must be put right.

28:47.800 --> 28:50.551
Mr. Patankar was yesterday was rather angry

28:50.842 --> 28:52.633
with the so-called educated people.

28:52.925 --> 28:55.301
They are educated in English language, that's the problem,

28:55.717 --> 28:57.509
the language is like that.

28:57.925 --> 28:59.092
They think no end of themselves.

28:59.384 --> 29:00.551
He said, "They didn't touch Your feet."

29:00.800 --> 29:04.092
If they learn English language they will not touch My feet,

29:04.717 --> 29:07.092
because in English language touching the feet

29:07.384 --> 29:10.384
is regarded as something horrible, I think.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.301
That's why he felt very sad about it.

29:14.633 --> 29:16.842
But this is all architecture has come from England,

29:17.092 --> 29:19.967
everything has come from Germany or from France.

29:20.301 --> 29:22.384
Our telephones have come from France.

29:22.717 --> 29:25.259
No wonder they work like this!

29:26.384 --> 29:28.259
It's all the French who brought this,

29:28.509 --> 29:30.259
and again they have got a big - I don't know,

29:30.509 --> 29:32.384
if I meet Rajiv Gandhi I'll tell him

29:32.633 --> 29:35.051
that at least don't give telephones to French.

29:35.301 --> 29:40.717
They has given such a big, very big order to the French.

29:41.509 --> 29:43.842
And now the helicopters they are buying from England,

29:44.051 --> 29:45.051
thank God they've stopped it.

29:45.343 --> 29:46.925
God knows what will happen to the helicopters,

29:47.176 --> 29:49.176
coming down in India from England.

29:49.426 --> 29:52.051
Like that you see they now are depending on the Third World

29:52.217 --> 29:53.967
for their progress, because they don't know

29:54.217 --> 29:55.509
where to send their own things

29:55.717 --> 29:56.967
which are created by their machines.

29:57.301 --> 29:59.633
But the way they do it: I mean, just imagine

29:59.842 --> 30:02.551
the kind of phones we have here, all done by French,

30:02.759 --> 30:05.301
not Indians. Why blame the Indians for that?

30:05.509 --> 30:07.884
Is done by the French, horrid, they have been like this

30:08.134 --> 30:11.384
since long, and they are just the same.

30:11.593 --> 30:14.675
And again now we have given order to the French,

30:15.009 --> 30:16.675
because we thought only French can cure

30:17.009 --> 30:18.509
the French telephones.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.259
I don't know what they are going to do

30:20.509 --> 30:22.134
any justice to us or not.

30:22.384 --> 30:26.384
So, as that machine is to be worked out,

30:26.675 --> 30:29.176
our own machine is to be worked out;

30:29.633 --> 30:32.633
and that machine is gone downward.

30:32.925 --> 30:37.384
Let us raise it up, upward towards God in surrender,

30:37.675 --> 30:41.800
in understanding, because you are specially chosen people

30:42.259 --> 30:43.717
in that area.

30:44.051 --> 30:46.884
Like the lotuses you have to come out of the mud,

30:47.176 --> 30:50.384
and don't imbed yourself in the mud more and more.

30:50.675 --> 30:52.800
Try to push yourself out of that,

30:53.051 --> 30:56.384
so that the fragrance of divinity will spread in that mud,

30:56.633 --> 31:00.800
and make the whole of that Western world a beautiful place,

31:01.134 --> 31:02.259
beautiful place.

31:02.509 --> 31:04.384
Whatever has been done is done.

31:04.717 --> 31:06.884
I know one thing: without forgiveness,

31:07.176 --> 31:09.675
nothing is going to work out. Done is done.

31:09.925 --> 31:13.717
Erring is human, doesn't matter; whatever is done is done.

31:14.009 --> 31:15.884
Whatever they have done is done.

31:16.176 --> 31:17.593
It's all right, forgive them.

31:17.884 --> 31:20.759
Forgiveness is the only way they can come up.

31:21.176 --> 31:25.384
And when they are forgiven, they have to also realize now

31:25.800 --> 31:27.800
that we have to rise;

31:28.343 --> 31:30.051
because the world they have created

31:30.384 --> 31:34.176
has really ruined themselves.

31:34.593 --> 31:37.633
If they rise now the whole place can become fragrant,

31:37.925 --> 31:42.009
as I told you, like the lotus that comes out of the mud.

31:42.343 --> 31:44.884
It's a very wrong idea people have here about the West,

31:45.176 --> 31:47.717
that you are the happiest people living around.

31:48.176 --> 31:51.884
So it is better that we

31:54.633 --> 31:57.675
tell them that "No, we are not happy there."

31:58.009 --> 32:00.675
You, what you have got is something precious.

32:00.925 --> 32:02.343
They also try to follow you,

32:02.675 --> 32:04.675
and that following is going so far

32:04.925 --> 32:06.633
that maybe one day you will have to come

32:06.884 --> 32:08.717
and teach them Sahaja Yoga.

32:09.009 --> 32:11.009
Because they are on the other side of the circle;

32:11.259 --> 32:12.675
they are now trying to learn English,

32:12.925 --> 32:15.675
master English language, and becoming sahibs.

32:15.925 --> 32:17.343
They will come out with tailcoats,

32:17.633 --> 32:20.675
and you'll have to tell them that better wear your dresses!

32:22.633 --> 32:27.384
So we should be wise, we should be sensible,

32:27.925 --> 32:30.468
and the stupidity and the silly temperament

32:30.759 --> 32:32.593
that we have developed, we should give up.

32:32.925 --> 32:34.633
Suddenly people bubble out, I see that.

32:34.925 --> 32:36.884
You see, there's no balance.

32:37.176 --> 32:40.259
The maturity shows when you have a balance.

32:40.468 --> 32:41.675
You should be happy, I know;

32:42.009 --> 32:44.134
but all the time smiling, putting up a show,

32:44.468 --> 32:46.925
or sort of suddenly coming out with funny remarks

32:47.176 --> 32:49.675
and silly remarks shows you are not matured enough.

32:49.925 --> 32:50.884
You have to mature.

32:51.134 --> 32:54.593
In Sahaja Yoga you mature, and if you do not mature

32:54.800 --> 32:57.384
then Sahaja Yoga has done no good to you.

32:57.426 --> 33:00.009
So you have to be very, very careful about that part.

33:03.551 --> 33:05.759
I hope I've been able to tell you all about it.

33:06.009 --> 33:07.176
Now what should I tell you ?

33:07.967 --> 33:09.633
I was just praising you,

33:09.925 --> 33:11.967
just praising you in front of others.

33:12.593 --> 33:14.426
I tell them not to behave like stupid people,

33:14.633 --> 33:15.800
and for you I must tell you

33:16.051 --> 33:19.717
that you need not blindly imitate them.

33:20.842 --> 33:23.134
Whatever we have got is a very great heritage.

33:23.384 --> 33:24.842
It should be carefully maintained.

33:25.092 --> 33:28.301
By looking at these people, if we try to imitate them

33:28.551 --> 33:29.884
it will be a foolish behavior on our part.

33:30.092 --> 33:35.551
Their life is not balanced but has gone to extremes.

33:36.301 --> 33:38.551
I have stayed there for twelve years.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.759
Thus I have spent a TUP (twelve years)

33:41.051 --> 33:42.675
so I just wanted to tell you

33:42.925 --> 33:45.009
that you should not blindly follow them.

33:46.009 --> 33:50.009
Though old is gold, whatever is oldish  is not good.

33:50.259 --> 33:52.051
So oldish is not good.

33:52.301 --> 33:56.675
The concept of oldish has also come recently.

33:57.343 --> 33:59.967
For example, from the Muslims we have learnt to harass the women,

34:00.217 --> 34:02.593
from the English we have learnt to give dowry.

34:03.259 --> 34:07.468
Now we have entered a new rules (of life)

34:07.634 --> 34:11.800
and in these new rules we need not give dowry

34:12.092 --> 34:13.633
(to our daughters who are married).

34:13.800 --> 34:15.134
The daughters have been given half the property.

34:15.426 --> 34:16.468
This system is correct.

34:16.717 --> 34:18.426
But here the daughters will not take, and neither give.

34:23.509 --> 34:26.800
Thus we should not learn these things from them.

34:27.134 --> 34:30.633
We should keep to our behavior of remaining humble,

34:30.800 --> 34:32.759
to lead a balanced life as taught to us by our ancestors,

34:33.009 --> 34:35.134
and discard whatever is oldish.

34:35.343 --> 34:36.800
There are many oldish customs lingering in us.

34:37.092 --> 34:38.717
For example, the domination of Brahmins in the temples

34:39.009 --> 34:40.593
has to be given up.

34:40.842 --> 34:42.176
They all have nicely fooled us.

34:42.468 --> 34:44.426
Secondly, the custom of fasting  has to be given up.

34:44.717 --> 34:46.384
I've told you hundred of times not to fast,

34:46.633 --> 34:48.301
but eat whatever is needed for the body,

34:48.551 --> 34:50.301
but people tell Me that "we cannot give up fasting."

34:50.551 --> 34:52.092
But the worst oldish, very dirty habit we have acquired

34:52.384 --> 34:53.426
is consuming tobacco.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.343
We are not able to give up tobacco,

34:55.593 --> 34:56.884
because we do not have enough strength .

34:59.092 --> 35:01.134
Tobacco, mishri (chewing tobacco with lime),

35:01.384 --> 35:02.884
who has brought these things to our country?

35:03.176 --> 35:04.967
From where did the word "tobacco"  come?

35:05.259 --> 35:07.217
There was no word for tambakou in Sanskrit language.

35:08.551 --> 35:10.176
We did not cultivate tobacco earlier.

35:10.468 --> 35:11.633
It is the English who have brought it to our country.

35:15.343 --> 35:16.884
The English have brought it here.

35:17.842 --> 35:19.634
That's why we call it tambakou,

35:19.967 --> 35:21.633
which has come from the word tobacco.

35:21.884 --> 35:26.009
Where is the word tambakou in our Marathi language?

35:26.301 --> 35:28.259
It has been brought here from outside.

35:28.509 --> 35:34.259
Initially the Muslims cultivated it to some extent in our country,

35:34.468 --> 35:36.675
but these people (English) have brought cigarette

35:36.925 --> 35:38.925
and other things here on a large scale.

35:39.217 --> 35:41.426
They use it on a mass scale in their country.

35:41.675 --> 35:46.092
They have also exported tobacco and ganja (sort of a drug) to China.

35:46.343 --> 35:48.509
In our Marathi language I never heard of the word ganja

35:48.675 --> 35:50.301
and charras (another sort of drug).

35:51.509 --> 35:54.634
If you try to consume ganja  and charras

35:55.343 --> 35:57.134
you will become like the English.

35:57.426 --> 35:58.759
It's up to you to decide.

36:01.633 --> 36:03.717
Thus whatever is given to us.

36:04.009 --> 36:06.259
We never had tobacco in our country, you'll be surprised.

36:06.551 --> 36:09.009
There's no word for tobacco in Sanskrit language.

36:09.759 --> 36:13.051
This was brought partly, of course, partly I should say,

36:13.343 --> 36:15.259
by the Muslims and then by the

36:15.633 --> 36:20.343
- the smoking was taught to us only by English.

36:20.593 --> 36:22.925
We didn't know that, what was smoking,

36:23.259 --> 36:25.009
we never knew smoking business.

36:25.217 --> 36:26.925
Muslims did have a little bit of it,

36:27.259 --> 36:29.800
but that started quite late.

36:30.217 --> 36:32.259
But actually this cigarette and this,

36:32.509 --> 36:34.384
all this has started after the English came in,

36:34.633 --> 36:36.384
"making it handy," you see.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.051
They used to have hookahs.

36:38.384 --> 36:40.468
That was rather difficult to make,

36:40.759 --> 36:42.509
so they could do it only very little bit.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.800
It was a long time back in the Islamic culture.

36:46.134 --> 36:49.176
But the real, this cigarette business, this ego business

36:49.509 --> 36:51.593
has come from the English, no doubt about it.

36:51.842 --> 36:54.675
And the Portuguese, Portuguese and the French,

36:55.009 --> 36:56.384
they taught us all these things.

36:56.633 --> 36:57.925
So what I'm trying to tell them,

36:58.134 --> 37:01.009
that whatever is oldish should be given up.

37:01.301 --> 37:02.633
Whatever is old is gold,

37:02.925 --> 37:05.426
but whatever is oldish that we call as junnat,

37:05.634 --> 37:06.967
should be given up.

37:10.343 --> 37:15.593
We have the custom of wearing saris with thick borders.

37:15.842 --> 37:17.009
This is a very good custom.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.468
Thick borders symbolizes maryadas,

37:19.634 --> 37:21.092
and when we wear saris with thick borders

37:21.301 --> 37:22.301
we stay in our maryadas.

37:22.551 --> 37:24.884
Young girls can dress up whatever way they like,

37:25.134 --> 37:26.675
but young women, specially married women,

37:26.967 --> 37:28.384
should wear saris with thick borders.

37:28.634 --> 37:30.884
If you give up wearing saris with thick borders

37:31.134 --> 37:35.884
then you will lose all the art, all the art.

37:36.217 --> 37:39.259
Weavers will lose all the art of weaving.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.551
If we do not construct our houses as per the old style,

37:42.800 --> 37:46.634
then we will lose all the ancient art of building beautiful houses.

37:47.009 --> 37:51.593
These people like our houses built on the old style,

37:51.800 --> 37:54.426
not the new style.

37:55.259 --> 37:57.009
The reason is that the old style has got beauty in it,

37:57.301 --> 38:00.675
and which might be lost if we built houses anyhow.

38:00.884 --> 38:02.343
Even the earlier huts were much better.

38:03.967 --> 38:05.634
Instead of this

38:05.967 --> 38:07.551
occurring at a later stage,

38:07.800 --> 38:09.217
once we lose all the art in the future it'll be too late.

38:09.509 --> 38:11.925
Thus whatever is our ancient art has to be preserved,

38:12.176 --> 38:13.468
since it has beauty in it.

38:13.759 --> 38:17.468
For example we have … type of saris which are called bugdya,

38:17.675 --> 38:20.633
nowadays the women do not even know the names of these saris.

38:20.842 --> 38:24.343
That's why we should always use the saris

38:24.593 --> 38:27.509
which have been woven by us. They are good.

38:27.717 --> 38:31.217
I think saris with thick borders suit better for the married women.

38:31.468 --> 38:33.509
If the saris do not have thick borders, it does not suit them.

38:33.717 --> 38:35.842
Married women should always wear saris with thick borders.

38:36.675 --> 38:39.176
It is not an oldish custom, but is a very beautiful custom.

38:39.426 --> 38:42.384
It looks nice, it matches with the women, it looks graceful,

38:42.633 --> 38:45.800
it has got a look of a well-bred woman.

38:46.051 --> 38:48.717
It is our culture, which we should not abandon

38:48.967 --> 38:50.426
and become like them (English).

38:52.134 --> 38:53.593
We should not try to acquire their culture,

38:53.759 --> 38:55.301
because our culture is very great.

38:55.593 --> 38:57.051
If we pave our way by understanding

38:57.343 --> 38:59.343
what has gone wrong with their culture,

38:59.633 --> 39:01.509
then we can progress well.

39:01.759 --> 39:03.343
We can accept their progress in science,

39:03.634 --> 39:05.759
but in doing so if we lose our cultural heritage

39:06.051 --> 39:08.301
then we will become like them.

39:08.593 --> 39:10.343
They kill their children.

39:10.593 --> 39:12.925
Husband and wife cannot stay together even for two years.

39:13.259 --> 39:17.217
All of them stay in orphanages, waiting for death to come.

39:19.343 --> 39:22.675
In our society we have to preserve our goodness and kindness.

39:22.925 --> 39:25.426
Instead of that, we have acquired whatever is wrong with others.

39:25.633 --> 39:27.176
First we had learnt from the Muslims,

39:27.426 --> 39:28.842
and now we are learning from these people.

39:29.092 --> 39:31.009
If we absorb the dirt from them,

39:32.176 --> 39:34.384
how can our houses remain clean?

39:34.634 --> 39:36.759
We were supposed to be clean and well-mannerly people,

39:37.009 --> 39:37.967
and now we have acquired many wrong things from others.

39:38.259 --> 39:40.009
Thus we have to abandon these things and cleanse ourselves.

39:45.259 --> 39:46.925
Now, I've told them what is the importance of puja

39:47.176 --> 39:48.468
but you know these things,

39:48.717 --> 39:50.009
so I did not explain it to you.

39:50.301 --> 39:52.426
But in puja one should have shraddha,

39:52.675 --> 39:54.634
and we should not quarrel during the puja.

39:54.967 --> 39:57.009
It does not matter who does the puja

39:57.301 --> 39:59.925
since everyone is equally benefited from it,

39:59.925 --> 40:01.593
depending upon the shraddha you have,

40:02.633 --> 40:04.259
depending upon the shraddha you have.

40:06.605 --> 40:09.605
Your pitchers will be filled up as much you have the shraddha.

40:10.509 --> 40:13.343
I would say for the ladies, can come and sit here this side

40:13.633 --> 40:16.509
a little bit. It's very hot for you. Move forward.

40:16.675 --> 40:20.134
Specially people who are so hot should not sit that side.

40:21.675 --> 40:22.675
Better sit ….

40:22.759 --> 40:25.051
Please let those ladies sit this side.

40:25.343 --> 40:27.633
They cannot bear the sun. Let them sit here.

40:27.967 --> 40:28.842
They are our guests.

40:29.217 --> 40:31.551
Come along, this side.

40:34.925 --> 40:38.176
If you had put something there, you could have managed it.

40:42.925 --> 40:44.884
Little bit also one must understand,

40:45.134 --> 40:46.468
that they are doing everything.

40:46.675 --> 40:48.593
We must also do something about it.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.468
Everything they arrange, we just come

40:50.759 --> 40:53.426
and sit down like gods; it's not a good thing, is it?

40:53.967 --> 40:55.717
You could have - such a long time was there,

40:56.051 --> 40:58.176
why didn't you put something there to protect yourselves?

40:58.426 --> 41:00.134
It's not difficult.

41:04.468 --> 41:06.717
Now for these. You come this side also.

41:06.967 --> 41:08.634
You can come this side. Come along.

41:08.842 --> 41:10.967
Please give them place to sit.

41:11.217 --> 41:14.717
Come along. You get up from there. Hello - you get up,

41:14.967 --> 41:17.633
three of you. Come this side.

41:20.967 --> 41:23.051
The ladies who are in the - no, you are all right, I think.

41:23.301 --> 41:25.800
Are you all right, are you? All right, behind you.

41:27.925 --> 41:29.675
Behind you these people can come this side,

41:30.009 --> 41:31.717
a little bit move this side.

41:32.593 --> 41:36.343
Not in the sun, they are already in the sun.

41:38.343 --> 41:41.634
If we make some shade on this side …

41:43.925 --> 41:46.176
Is it all right?

41:46.759 --> 41:49.426
Let them sit. There is shade on the other side,

41:49.759 --> 41:51.717
there is shade. Sit in the front where there is shade.

41:52.092 --> 41:53.593
Please have a seat.

41:54.134 --> 41:55.800
Hello - you come this side.

41:56.092 --> 41:58.092
There is place for you here.

41:58.384 --> 42:00.634
Come here, this side. This side you come along.

42:00.884 --> 42:03.634
Ladies need not go there, so come along this side.

42:03.925 --> 42:05.468
Let them sit.

42:05.884 --> 42:08.468
The men can come this side.

42:13.759 --> 42:16.134
Yes, the men can come this side.

42:16.384 --> 42:18.925
No, no, you'd better come this side.

42:19.884 --> 42:23.009
Why don't you move this side a little bit?

42:30.217 --> 42:32.551
Also we must think what we can arrange,

42:32.759 --> 42:33.800
what we can help them.

42:34.134 --> 42:37.092
Like yesterday, how they managed, arranged - when I went,

42:37.343 --> 42:38.675
they did not know I was going to the thing.

42:38.925 --> 42:40.925
When I came back, how they arranged for Me,

42:41.259 --> 42:42.217
how they were running.

42:42.509 --> 42:45.092
I mean, I'm also your Mother, am I not?

42:45.551 --> 42:48.134
Then we should think about these things,

42:50.009 --> 42:54.800
what we can do, how we can help them; everybody should.

42:55.633 --> 42:57.343
Just leave it, leave it just like that.

42:57.717 --> 42:59.551
Since they have not made any arrangements

42:59.842 --> 43:01.301
what can be done, let them sit as they are.

43:01.759 --> 43:04.509
You can move a little bit this side.

43:07.384 --> 43:10.925
Hello - you move this side a little bit.

43:13.634 --> 43:15.092
You can also move a little bit.

43:15.343 --> 43:17.884
I don't want you to get into sun, you'll have trouble.

43:19.426 --> 43:22.884
No, but they can move the sound equipment a little this side.

43:23.259 --> 43:25.759
Just move it, a little bit ….

43:43.468 --> 43:45.884
As soon as the sun comes up, you see,

43:46.217 --> 43:48.884
it will be all right, but still ….

43:51.925 --> 43:55.509
Just sit in the shade, sit as much as possible in the shade.

43:59.301 --> 44:02.301
If there is no shade you can sit in the front.

44:02.717 --> 44:05.967
In the puja it is better to sit in the shade.

44:06.551 --> 44:10.717
I am always standing in here above you. Do not worry.

44:14.406 --> 44:16.739
Please sit here in front of Me. It's better to sit in the shade.

44:40.675 --> 44:47.259
Is there somebody to say the mantras? Please call Gavin.

44:50.675 --> 44:54.343
Yesterday you didn't come to My feet - you should have.

44:56.884 --> 44:59.259
Please leave it now, otherwise it'll be late.

44:59.633 --> 45:02.176
Let them sit in the sun

45:02.259 --> 45:06.759
Catching on the left Heart and left Swadisthan.

45:12.217 --> 45:13.551
Yesterday you should have come;

45:13.842 --> 45:16.551
I mean, you'll be doing in the pujas everything, so …

45:16.800 --> 45:20.009
Is there somebody here to say the mantras?

45:24.967 --> 45:28.343
Has Mr. Gholap arrived? Please call him.

45:29.468 --> 45:31.884
Does he know it?

45:33.675 --> 45:39.259
It's catching very badly - Heart, left Swadisthan.

45:42.925 --> 45:45.925
Say Atharva Sheersha. Mr. Gholap has not come.

45:54.217 --> 45:59.800
Where has Mr. Gholap gone? Has he not come?

46:00.759 --> 46:04.509
Please call him for doing the puja.

46:05.634 --> 46:09.384
Please start the puja with the Atharva Sheersha.

46:16.925 --> 46:19.343
Please start now.
