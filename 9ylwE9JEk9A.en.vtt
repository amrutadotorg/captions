00:00:00.017 --> 00:00:08.336
We can say, in 1970, 5th May,

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:21.689
first time, the collective Spirit of God opened out.

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:34.286
So far the blessings of God came to human beings individually as grace.

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:43.401
And they received their Self-realisation individually, one by one.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.272
And the method for individual realisation

00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:58.616
was just the opposite of the collective.

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:09.660
First they had to establish their dharma, cleanse themselves fully,

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:13.376
desiring all the time for their salvation,

00:01:13.577 --> 00:01:16.267
putting their attention to their salvation,

00:01:16.468 --> 00:01:22.297
as you call it Ishwara Pranidhan (desire for God), thinking of God,

00:01:22.498 --> 00:01:32.541
asking for His grace and acting

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:40.684
in a scrupulous, dharmic ways to keep themselves pure.

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:49.530
They had to control their mind, control their desires,

00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:53.110
control their action in such a manner

00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:59.045
that they absolutely kept to the centre path.

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:06.733
And when they could get through all that,

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:11.507
testing and immunity, and when they deserved [it],

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:20.378
then only the grace of Mother gave them Realisation.

00:02:20.894 --> 00:02:25.692
This pattern was on for some time.

00:02:31.378 --> 00:02:39.022
These few people who got Realisation

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:46.045
did lots of wonderful things to prepare for Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:46.246 --> 00:02:53.449
They were in every field of life, but very few and unique.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.215
For example, in India and in many other places in ancient times,

00:02:58.416 --> 00:03:09.834
they discovered the unique gifts of the Mother Earth;

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:17.344
what you call as the swayambhus – created by themselves.

00:03:18.217 --> 00:03:22.319
These stones or stone images,

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.115
which were thrown out by the Mother Earth,

00:03:27.316 --> 00:03:30.655
were discovered by these saints.

00:03:30.762 --> 00:03:35.375
They put shrines there, they worshipped them

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:42.519
and, by worshipping, they made these images vibrate -

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.884
more of vibrations and vibrate that area.

00:03:51.204 --> 00:03:55.802
All over the world there are such stones,

00:03:56.003 --> 00:04:01.533
but only the saints could discover them.

00:04:01.787 --> 00:04:08.850
Then they established the importance of virtue in life:

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:17.299
how virtue can give you health, wealth and prosperity

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.430
which is glorifying

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:31.724
and not which is degrading or which is destructive.

00:04:33.751 --> 00:04:42.966
They established schools and universities, specially in India.

00:04:43.968 --> 00:04:47.859
And today, even today, in India,

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:52.706
the families which belong to one university

00:04:52.827 --> 00:04:56.968
carry the name of that university as their gotras.

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:05.044
And even today the families belonging to one (the same) gotra cannot marry.

00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:12.960
They prepared young children, educated them,

00:05:13.161 --> 00:05:17.493
in such a manner that they led a very dharmic life,

00:05:17.694 --> 00:05:25.884
enjoyed their married life fully and then they matured in such a manner

00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:37.872
that they got their realisation and lived a life of complete enjoyment.

00:05:41.362 --> 00:05:48.142
Thus they distracted the attention of people which was outside,

00:05:48.343 --> 00:05:54.508
to inner deeper values, by their own example,

00:05:54.709 --> 00:06:01.483
by their own behaviour, by their own style of enjoyment,

00:06:01.684 --> 00:06:07.357
by leading a very cheerful and a happy life.

00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:17.718
All this permeated a kind of confidence in God, religion,

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:28.660
and a very good, balanced life.

00:06:31.146 --> 00:06:44.339
They have really done a great job of first building, the scaffoldings

00:06:44.540 --> 00:07:02.947
of the huge, great building of Sahaja Yoga which is going to come now.

00:07:03.148 --> 00:07:10.063
They are just like nuts and bolts in our whole working.

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:23.880
Their desire to establish dharma was so great

00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:36.130
that complete Divine force of Mahakali was working through them.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:45.159
Then they put it to the action with such understanding and such wisdom.

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:56.396
Great scriptures were written by them

00:07:56.497 --> 00:08:00.836
and for many years, thousands of years,

00:08:01.037 --> 00:08:05.611
they were the guiding lines for people.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:18.620
Only in the modern times, if you say about a thousand years or so,

00:08:18.758 --> 00:08:28.262
people started doubting them.

00:08:33.114 --> 00:08:38.889
Before that people used to doubt themselves.

00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:45.201
They used to doubt that, "We are not yet capable.

00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:50.805
We are not good enough. We cannot do it better, but they are perfect.

00:08:51.006 --> 00:08:54.342
Whatever they have said is all right."

00:08:54.543 --> 00:09:02.730
There was no doubting about the incarnations

00:09:02.882 --> 00:09:06.260
or about these saints, what they said.

00:09:06.461 --> 00:09:10.682
But the doubting was about themselves

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:14.919
that, "How is it that this is the good path, we know,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:21.408
this is the real path, we know; still we are going in the wrong direction?"

00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:24.747
If you read the poems of those days, it’s all the time [expressing] that,

00:09:24.948 --> 00:09:36.797
"Why, despite the desire to be good, to be upright, to be righteous,

00:09:36.998 --> 00:09:44.964
why am I roaming into wrong paths and wilderness?"

00:09:45.165 --> 00:09:54.174
The writers in those days always showed that a good righteous man

00:09:54.375 --> 00:10:02.144
was rewarded by God’s blessings.

00:10:03.657 --> 00:10:12.672
But all this started toppling down with the ego developing

00:10:12.926 --> 00:10:17.935
and the super-ego challenging.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.220
Confusion started coming into the minds of people

00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:28.112
and they started doubting those great realised souls

00:10:28.313 --> 00:10:32.778
instead of doubting themselves.

00:10:32.961 --> 00:10:39.587
Because they could not reach anywhere near these great saints,

00:10:39.788 --> 00:10:46.681
some of them were influenced by many satanic forces around

00:10:46.882 --> 00:10:52.525
and played into their hands and started doubting

00:10:52.726 --> 00:10:59.085
those realised people and all these great scriptures.

00:11:00.148 --> 00:11:04.715
So, [on] the one side we have

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:09.266
the doubting people, the another side the fanatics.

00:11:09.484 --> 00:11:14.765
Those who tried to adhere more and more

00:11:14.765 --> 00:11:18.304
to the teachings had to become fanatics,

00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:22.182
so they became fanatics.

00:11:22.383 --> 00:11:27.706
And those who started doubting also could not show

00:11:27.907 --> 00:11:34.668
any benefits of doubting,

00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:37.917
could not convince the fanatics that they were wrong.

00:11:38.118 --> 00:11:43.738
So on one side we had fanatics and another side the doubting people.

00:11:43.939 --> 00:11:48.192
It’s like standing between the two stools.

00:11:48.192 --> 00:11:53.472
The real religion in man collapsed.

00:11:53.587 --> 00:11:57.549
There cannot be a new religion.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:04.977
Religion is a continuous living process within us which is our sustenance.

00:12:05.178 --> 00:12:14.681
It’s like a ladder on which we climb,

00:12:14.882 --> 00:12:21.291
leaving one by one, step by step, but not leaving the ladder.

00:12:22.612 --> 00:12:27.146
All others are required.

00:12:31.348 --> 00:12:40.202
So the ultimate had to be established

00:12:40.339 --> 00:12:49.684
because of these two types of emergence,

00:12:49.774 --> 00:12:56.060
one doubting, another fanatics.

00:13:00.773 --> 00:13:10.576
Both had not known God, both had not achieved Reality,

00:13:10.653 --> 00:13:18.771
and they criticised each other

00:13:18.821 --> 00:13:24.947
because both of them did not know what Truth was.

00:13:28.086 --> 00:13:37.720
I took My birth at a point where these confusions had started,

00:13:37.921 --> 00:13:43.751
showing its results even on the physical plane.

00:13:45.975 --> 00:13:55.008
All imbalances of life react physically, mentally, emotionally,

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:59.292
also spiritually.

00:14:03.018 --> 00:14:11.203
When I started looking around I was amazed

00:14:11.297 --> 00:14:19.705
how ignorance had made people naive,

00:14:19.906 --> 00:14:25.596
like a cloud of ignorance which came on them.

00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:30.816
Formerly people had this much understanding,

00:14:31.017 --> 00:14:36.154
this much sensitivity to know what is right and what is wrong.

00:14:36.355 --> 00:14:38.535
Even if they were wrong they knew that

00:14:38.736 --> 00:14:42.275
wrong was wrong and right was right.

00:14:42.387 --> 00:14:49.103
But in this [world’s] confused state I was born,

00:14:49.235 --> 00:14:57.314
and I knew I was to open the Sahasrara.

00:15:00.088 --> 00:15:09.089
So I started My work after My first shocks.

00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:15.369
I decided not to talk about it to anyone

00:15:15.369 --> 00:15:23.974
and lead a very, very normal life of a very ordinary person,

00:15:24.064 --> 00:15:28.227
not to be very striking,

00:15:28.362 --> 00:15:38.840
because, like Christ when He was born, a star came up.

00:15:39.041 --> 00:15:48.526
That’s how the king Herod
came to know about Him,

00:15:48.642 --> 00:15:55.447
and his forces worked and you know the story what happened.

00:15:58.952 --> 00:16:05.370
If you are born with any striking signs

00:16:05.528 --> 00:16:09.392
the negativity immediately finds you out.

00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:19.790
As it is it found Me out and just after the 15th day of My birth,

00:16:19.991 --> 00:16:25.527
there was a very big accident as you know.

00:16:29.013 --> 00:16:33.543
I had to really, really work, very, very, very hard

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:38.332
to enter into your being

00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:44.245
to find out the different permutations and combination.

00:16:45.675 --> 00:16:48.466
First of all, I had to find out your basic problems,

00:16:48.667 --> 00:16:52.737
what are your basic problems are.

00:16:53.884 --> 00:16:57.036
Once you handle the basics then you can handle

00:16:57.036 --> 00:17:01.381
the permutations and combinations.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:06.544
After finding the basic problems, I started finding out

00:17:06.745 --> 00:17:11.688
your permutations and combinations and I was amazed

00:17:11.889 --> 00:17:20.998
how human beings were placed to their outside world

00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:26.264
and how they reacted to their outside world, and I identified

00:17:26.465 --> 00:17:31.546
that these permutations and combinations which formed within themselves

00:17:31.747 --> 00:17:36.131
were also capped by their other identifications,

00:17:36.332 --> 00:17:39.101
like the society in which they were born,

00:17:39.302 --> 00:17:45.538
like the nation in which they were born, like the ideas that were there.

00:17:45.739 --> 00:17:49.225
All these things became much more important

00:17:49.426 --> 00:17:53.062
than the Original Being, which is Universal, within you.

00:17:53.263 --> 00:17:56.572
And every individual had taken

00:17:56.572 --> 00:18:01.097
a very odd, funny, awkward type of a shape

00:18:01.238 --> 00:18:05.418
which I didn’t know how to reduce and how

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:08.525
to bring it to proper growth level

00:18:08.726 --> 00:18:12.288
by which they start their growth.

00:18:12.489 --> 00:18:18.502
It was a very, very hard work and the nights after nights I used to work,

00:18:18.703 --> 00:18:24.085
while leading a very, very ordinary life of a very normal person.

00:18:24.286 --> 00:18:35.506
I used to deliberately behave

00:18:35.707 --> 00:18:38.631
like a very simple ordinary student

00:18:38.832 --> 00:18:44.027
and show all My ignorance about things, but sometimes, you know,

00:18:44.228 --> 00:18:51.835
Truth has an awkward habit of slipping out and it used to show itself.

00:18:51.975 --> 00:18:57.646
Then this working started and one of the biggest major problems

00:18:57.847 --> 00:19:04.668
of human beings I found was the family life and that’s why I married.

00:19:04.869 --> 00:19:09.929
I wanted to study what are the problems of family life.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:15.458
And then I started facing these problems as if they were My own

00:19:15.659 --> 00:19:18.235
and started understanding

00:19:18.235 --> 00:19:21.607
why people behave in this manner and that manner.

00:19:21.808 --> 00:19:24.306
Because these connections are to be done,

00:19:24.507 --> 00:19:28.806
of course by you, but much more by the Divine Force

00:19:29.007 --> 00:19:35.081
and if I could know what are your problems, I would be able to act.

00:19:35.282 --> 00:19:42.621
Then other problems like political, economic and all these problems also,

00:19:42.822 --> 00:19:47.431
I tried to study because they became so important for human beings,

00:19:47.631 --> 00:19:51.140
which are of absolutely artificial value, but they did.

00:19:51.341 --> 00:19:56.366
So I had to see to that, what makes them do this and what makes them do that.

00:19:56.566 --> 00:20:05.273
Sort of a Human Behaviour Science I had to study for years.

00:20:05.474 --> 00:20:10.916
And then as you start unfolding

00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:14.959
or you can say, unentangling or disentangling,

00:20:15.104 --> 00:20:23.054
or taking out the knots of a bundle,

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:27.464
you reach a point where all the knots are opened out

00:20:27.664 --> 00:20:31.467
and one knot is still left, you see, which is to be opened out.

00:20:31.668 --> 00:20:38.722
And that was done on the 5th of May 1970.

00:20:38.968 --> 00:20:46.363
And once that had [been] done, the collective phenomena started working.

00:20:46.564 --> 00:20:48.972
And the greatest collective phenomena was that

00:20:48.972 --> 00:20:57.542
the Shri Chakra being on this Earth could be felt through your fingers.

00:20:57.666 --> 00:21:06.554
This was never before so, nobody felt the fingers enlightened,

00:21:06.755 --> 00:21:11.089
nobody felt the vibrations on the fingers as such,

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.389
but they felt it within themselves

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:20.644
because the rising of the Kundalini and everything

00:21:20.845 --> 00:21:23.502
and the way they developed themselves inside,

00:21:23.703 --> 00:21:30.649
they were more concerned about one individual.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:36.782
They developed their inner being much more than their collective being.

00:21:36.983 --> 00:21:44.799
But now because the Sahasrara of the Universe was opened out,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.488
everybody started feeling the vibrations around them with their own hands.

00:21:51.689 --> 00:21:57.026
That means the chakras themselves were feeling before

00:21:57.227 --> 00:22:05.826
[but] now the fingers, which are manifested

00:22:05.975 --> 00:22:10.965
from the power of a particular chakra or chakras

00:22:10.965 --> 00:22:13.621
could feel the vibrations.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:20.416
That means the sensitivity of the Divine, which was in the chakras,

00:22:20.617 --> 00:22:28.863
spread out to peripheries to such an extent that
the human being could feel it on the fingers.

00:22:29.328 --> 00:22:32.631
This was fantastic.

00:22:35.955 --> 00:22:45.283
So My job was to move from the centre to the periphery.

00:22:45.484 --> 00:22:51.726
While moving that, whatever are the obstacles I met,

00:22:51.927 --> 00:22:55.532
I had to clear them out, one after another.

00:22:55.733 --> 00:22:59.414
And then, once all the obstacles are cleared out

00:22:59.615 --> 00:23:04.672
and all the network is properly done,

00:23:04.816 --> 00:23:14.546
then to generate the energy through this happening of Sahasrara Day.

00:23:15.007 --> 00:23:21.072
So you can imagine how important is this day.

00:23:21.732 --> 00:23:26.008
Now this much is for Myself.

00:23:26.209 --> 00:23:30.805
I don’t know how many of you really know how much the Divine had to work

00:23:31.006 --> 00:23:36.249
and how many of you are really thankful

00:23:36.249 --> 00:23:43.197
to the Divine for this tremendous
work, which was done through ages

00:23:43.398 --> 00:23:49.843
and now specially for these forty seven years of My life.

00:23:50.049 --> 00:23:53.274
Relentlessly it worked, keeping up the facade

00:23:53.274 --> 00:23:58.662
of a very normal, ordinary person.

00:24:01.286 --> 00:24:07.155
Because it had to reach to the ordinary,

00:24:07.283 --> 00:24:12.531
not to the extraordinary, but to the ordinary.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.579
And one had to take out the extraordinary qualities in the ordinary

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.580
by making them deeper. This was the tremendous task.

00:24:25.781 --> 00:24:33.519
But then I must say, that the Sahaja Yoga, when it started working out,

00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:46.634
I also was given very great workers, tools of Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:52.214
who took it up upon themselves as their own responsibility.

00:24:54.043 --> 00:24:56.119
And you all should be thankful to them,

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:03.356
because they really worked very hard with Me,

00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:07.074
taking [it] up upon themselves as their own responsibility.

00:25:07.275 --> 00:25:09.689
Very few, but they did.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.838
The rest of them can be divided into many categories:

00:25:14.039 --> 00:25:17.432
Some of them just came for their own treatment

00:25:17.633 --> 00:25:20.300
or something like that, of a very low level.

00:25:20.501 --> 00:25:23.013
Or for their relations; when they got realisation

00:25:23.214 --> 00:25:26.469
they got all their sick relations to Me.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.092
Then some of them came for their financial

00:25:29.293 --> 00:25:32.318
and all sorts of mental problems.

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:37.896
Then some of them came for their family and spiritual problems,

00:25:38.097 --> 00:25:42.623
for getting rid of that.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:54.340
But the ones who took it up as their own responsibility,

00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:57.476
that this is what they have to do, this is their life,

00:25:57.677 --> 00:26:03.575
this is what their complete meaning is,

00:26:03.654 --> 00:26:08.759
they put entirely their attention to it

00:26:08.882 --> 00:26:19.669
and they worked it out, whatever was possible, on their own level.

00:26:23.175 --> 00:26:28.558
So today we have to understand one thing

00:26:28.745 --> 00:26:32.200
that we really need those brave people

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:39.263
and those people who feel responsible,

00:26:39.392 --> 00:26:49.813
which is a very important virtue of Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:59.665
While personal things, your own chakras and your own problems

00:26:59.866 --> 00:27:03.007
and all that is not important,

00:27:03.208 --> 00:27:05.980
because if the whole improves you are going to improve too.

00:27:06.181 --> 00:27:08.975
If the whole of the body improves you are going to improve.

00:27:09.176 --> 00:27:12.217
But if one finger improves [and] the rest of the body is suffering,

00:27:12.418 --> 00:27:15.578
you are not going to be happy either.

00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:21.003
So the main thing is what are you doing for Sahaja Yoga?

00:27:21.204 --> 00:27:26.628
What you can do? How far you can go? How you are going to work it out?

00:27:26.829 --> 00:27:32.547
In every walk of life and field of life, those who really work it out

00:27:32.756 --> 00:27:36.428
as a great responsibility upon themselves,

00:27:36.629 --> 00:27:43.680
are the ones [who] will be given more and more powers and chances.

00:27:44.212 --> 00:27:47.690
Then in Sahaja Yoga you will find it’s so simple and clean,

00:27:47.891 --> 00:27:51.019
absolutely clean.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:55.136
There is nothing hanky-panky about it.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:28:03.542
Right from money up to the point of you
people [who] are confiding things into Me.

00:28:03.742 --> 00:28:07.465
You have been telling Me all about you, and I know everything about you,

00:28:07.666 --> 00:28:11.147
which I have taken into My Ocean of Love,

00:28:11.147 --> 00:28:15.106
and have tried to help you in every way,

00:28:15.252 --> 00:28:19.073
outside inside, solving your problems.

00:28:19.274 --> 00:28:27.591
It is so transparent to see how Sahaja Yoga is so much a Mother to you.

00:28:29.006 --> 00:28:32.667
But while taking all the advantage with it,

00:28:32.868 --> 00:28:36.706
still you are more identified with your own enjoyments

00:28:36.907 --> 00:28:41.993
and your own idea of enjoyment.

00:28:42.194 --> 00:28:45.201
You people still do not enjoy that collective Spirit

00:28:45.402 --> 00:28:51.815
which was opened on the 5th May 1970.

00:28:51.928 --> 00:28:58.257
You still, in companionship, in company with each other,

00:28:58.458 --> 00:29:07.355
you enjoy it more like people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:11.310
Now today is the day to make a big determination

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:17.478
that you will start enjoying your collective Spirit.

00:29:20.747 --> 00:29:26.648
Everything for the collectivity, then the enjoyment will be maximum.

00:29:26.849 --> 00:29:30.722
You will never feel that you have sacrificed anything.

00:29:30.923 --> 00:29:35.298
But unless and until we have more of such people,

00:29:35.499 --> 00:29:39.443
the other dishwashers are of no use.

00:29:39.644 --> 00:29:45.589
Just dishwashers or of a very low grade Sahaja Yogis are absolutely useless,

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:51.012
who just want to take advantage and have a nice time, and all that type of people.

00:29:51.213 --> 00:29:55.858
They are not going to make much mark for us.

00:29:56.058 --> 00:29:59.089
You don’t need much intelligence for that,

00:29:59.089 --> 00:30:01.677
you don’t need much money for that.

00:30:01.755 --> 00:30:08.703
You don’t need anything but a complete desire.

00:30:10.709 --> 00:30:16.793
And one should know that, here, we are going to gain our own flowering,

00:30:16.994 --> 00:30:24.575
the flowering of the whole, of which we are the part and parcel.

00:30:24.776 --> 00:30:30.341
So you must make a determination

00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:34.729
not to bring Sahaja Yoga to your personal level

00:30:34.821 --> 00:30:40.492
or to your limited problems, or to your own relationships.

00:30:40.693 --> 00:30:50.720
It is the relationship of the Creation with God.

00:30:50.929 --> 00:30:54.929
It’s not your relationship or anybody else’s relationship.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:59.673
As in any machine, all the wires must be connected to the mains

00:30:59.874 --> 00:31:02.085
through one main wire, in the same way

00:31:02.286 --> 00:31:04.589
you all must be connected to God

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:08.514
individually so that you all are connected among yourselves.

00:31:08.715 --> 00:31:11.289
I’ve been saying this again and again and again

00:31:11.490 --> 00:31:18.336
because at Sahasrara you are being blessed of this collective Spirit.

00:31:18.544 --> 00:31:22.483
The second very important point is

00:31:22.483 --> 00:31:28.618
of complete integration within and without.

00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:32.249
Within, unless and until there is integration,

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:37.602
we cannot bring forth the outside integration.

00:31:37.803 --> 00:31:45.089
The complete integration within, comes by dedicating yourself

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:49.842
to your own improvement.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:58.726
First and foremost is: time must be given for your development.

00:31:58.927 --> 00:32:04.541
Not to show Me or not to show anyone. It is between you and yourself.

00:32:04.742 --> 00:32:09.972
You have to work hard to cleanse yourself.

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:19.564
Easy to live comfortably with all the horrible chakras within us,

00:32:19.642 --> 00:32:24.461
but it is easier also and the best, most enjoyable

00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:30.823
is, to have very clean chakras.

00:32:31.016 --> 00:32:37.856
And it comes [by], first of all, is sincerity.

00:32:37.977 --> 00:32:45.778
First of all is complete sincerity. Are we sincere to ourselves?

00:32:45.888 --> 00:32:49.973
Sometimes it is misunderstood. People think if you have to be sincere to ourself,

00:32:50.174 --> 00:32:53.458
we should deny Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:53.659 --> 00:32:59.599
Sahaja Yoga is the union between you and God,

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:07.584
and the sincerity must be full, must be complete.

00:33:07.785 --> 00:33:15.774
Any kind of insincerity which comes into you is extremely detrimental.

00:33:15.998 --> 00:33:22.208
So you must know that, as your Mother has sincerity about you,

00:33:22.409 --> 00:33:28.823
you must also have sincerity about yourself.

00:33:30.182 --> 00:33:33.014
Then you will start enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:33.215 --> 00:33:38.169
That is very important to create integration within you

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:42.232
because if it is sincerity, it comes from your heart.

00:33:42.433 --> 00:33:46.967
If it is coming from your heart then your body, your mind,

00:33:47.168 --> 00:33:54.320
your intelligence, everything will work hard to fulfil it.

00:33:54.528 --> 00:34:00.680
But if it is not coming from your heart it is going to be a superficial thing.

00:34:00.881 --> 00:34:05.615
So you try to feel it from your heart.

00:34:05.993 --> 00:34:11.335
That’s what it means: sincerity. Do not depend on anyone –

00:34:11.536 --> 00:34:20.247
your wife, husband, children – nothing – mother, father. It’s your own.

00:34:21.151 --> 00:34:25.437
So you have to work in such a way that you get complete integration

00:34:25.638 --> 00:34:34.028
and the driving force towards integration is a very simple one: is sincerity.

00:34:36.003 --> 00:34:44.426
Thus you will know that automatically you are getting integrated.

00:34:44.627 --> 00:34:50.462
The another factor [which] is important is patience.

00:34:50.605 --> 00:34:54.014
You must have patience with others,

00:34:54.215 --> 00:35:00.116
because if you do not have patience, your sincerity will start doubting itself.

00:35:00.317 --> 00:35:04.264
So you must have patience and to get patience,

00:35:04.465 --> 00:35:10.603
you must know what you have been so far and where are you.

00:35:10.804 --> 00:35:13.952
When you will know what you were, you will have patience with others,

00:35:14.153 --> 00:35:17.740
tremendous patience.

00:35:17.773 --> 00:35:25.421
And by having patience with others, your sincerity will be all the time complete.

00:35:25.638 --> 00:35:31.274
By your sincerity, you will be completely integrated.

00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:34.950
So we come to the point of sincerity.

00:35:35.151 --> 00:35:41.809
Now let us go deeper into it: how the sincerity is to be maintained.

00:35:41.965 --> 00:35:46.406
First of all we have to make some determinations,

00:35:46.607 --> 00:35:50.105
sankalpas (vows), of being sincere.

00:35:50.306 --> 00:35:58.432
Then we have to act by finding out how do we get insincere on what points.

00:35:58.633 --> 00:36:04.033
You are good at analysing, you can find it out: how do you get insincere,

00:36:04.033 --> 00:36:08.038
on what points you get insincere, what are the correcting points.

00:36:08.239 --> 00:36:12.049
Keep a control on your mind to see how does it become insincere.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:17.275
You’ll be amazed that it’s simpler to be sincere than to be insincere.

00:36:17.476 --> 00:36:23.242
Is the easiest thing is to be sincere than to be deceiving,

00:36:23.443 --> 00:36:29.255
because you don’t have to think. To be sincere you don’t have to think.

00:36:29.456 --> 00:36:32.350
If you have to be insincere you have to think, plan out

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:40.279
and to find out methods, all the loopholes
and escapes, by which you have to run away.

00:36:40.408 --> 00:36:43.315
If you have to be captive of your sincerity,

00:36:43.516 --> 00:36:45.943
you don’t have to worry about anything

00:36:46.144 --> 00:36:50.206
and that sincerity itself is rewarding.

00:36:50.407 --> 00:36:54.031
This principle must be written down in your hearts

00:36:54.232 --> 00:36:57.930
that sincerity itself is rewarding.

00:36:58.131 --> 00:37:02.766
You don’t have to go to anybody else

00:37:02.967 --> 00:37:09.142
to ask for the reward of sincerity, sincerity itself rewards you.

00:37:09.343 --> 00:37:13.575
And that’s why you start enjoying your own sincerity.

00:37:13.776 --> 00:37:17.341
If you start seeing all these things as a witness,

00:37:17.542 --> 00:37:23.804
that how your sincerity has made you so beautiful, so dignified

00:37:24.005 --> 00:37:30.157
and how you have started rising in your self-esteem,

00:37:30.283 --> 00:37:34.724
you’ll be amazed how sincerity itself is a big force

00:37:34.925 --> 00:37:44.322
which will manifest its living dynamism
in you and you’ll be a transformed person.

00:37:44.523 --> 00:37:49.718
This transformation within you is going to change the whole world.

00:37:49.918 --> 00:37:56.414
People are going to see that you are no more a confused person,

00:37:56.623 --> 00:37:59.155
you are not a person who is doubting

00:37:59.155 --> 00:38:01.777
and neither you are a person who is a fanatic.

00:38:01.977 --> 00:38:06.772
You are not a blind person and you are a person who is alert and aware

00:38:06.973 --> 00:38:11.079
and who can see things better than others.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.528
So, Divine is only interested in such people.

00:38:15.729 --> 00:38:21.915
As I have told you before that Divine is more interested

00:38:22.116 --> 00:38:25.742
in a little worm which is alert and aware

00:38:25.742 --> 00:38:30.304
than in a palace of a king which is dead.

00:38:30.373 --> 00:38:37.703
The more alert you become the more Divine takes interest in you.

00:38:38.549 --> 00:38:43.821
But this alertness is nothing but the enlightenment of your sincerity.

00:38:44.022 --> 00:38:47.698
You’ll be amazed how sincerity is the thing.

00:38:47.899 --> 00:38:54.546
That means you are loyal to yourself. You have to be loyal and not disloyal.

00:38:54.747 --> 00:38:58.394
The loyalty to yourself is sincerity

00:38:58.394 --> 00:39:01.970
and that is how I have managed Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:02.096 --> 00:39:05.594
But sincerity is My nature, I don’t have to strive for it.

00:39:05.594 --> 00:39:11.271
I cannot get out of it.
While, if I am your ideal,

00:39:11.271 --> 00:39:16.231
you should try to imbibe My nature within yourself.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:23.330
And then you will be amazed how you are connected with Me.

00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:28.762
Then we all move like one wave,

00:39:28.963 --> 00:39:33.464
one being, one personality.

00:39:33.665 --> 00:39:41.485
That is the achievement of this Sahasrara Day.

00:39:42.631 --> 00:39:49.104
Sincerity of purpose brought in action, not theory and philosophy,

00:39:49.305 --> 00:39:57.358
but in action, active sincerity, in every way, and patience,

00:39:57.559 --> 00:40:03.588
all these things will bring forth the complete integration within.

00:40:03.789 --> 00:40:07.593
Once your transformation starts working out,

00:40:07.794 --> 00:40:11.652
if human beings start getting transformed,

00:40:11.853 --> 00:40:16.952
tomorrow you will be placed at the helm of affairs everywhere in the society.

00:40:17.153 --> 00:40:22.156
Try to contact other people at your own level.

00:40:22.357 --> 00:40:25.554
Whatever may be the category of life you are leading,

00:40:25.554 --> 00:40:33.350
please try to contact them. By doing so, you create an atmosphere

00:40:33.551 --> 00:40:43.330
which starts another circle of evolution

00:40:43.531 --> 00:40:51.408
which is the outside integration, where the societies get integrated.

00:40:51.609 --> 00:41:02.717
All the people who profess different religions come to this Sahaja Yoga

00:41:02.918 --> 00:41:09.332
which is today the fruit of all the religions.

00:41:09.489 --> 00:41:14.583
The integration between political and economic situations,

00:41:14.784 --> 00:41:22.721
complete ideologies will integrate, because
the source of all these is the same.

00:41:22.817 --> 00:41:31.856
It has gone into disintegration because of its artificial identifications.

00:41:32.057 --> 00:41:36.051
That’s how we’ll integrate the whole world

00:41:36.051 --> 00:41:41.726
into a beautiful integrated Creation,

00:41:41.877 --> 00:41:47.705
with the purpose of blissful existence

00:41:47.906 --> 00:41:52.434
for all of us to enjoy.

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:57.646
Good times are ahead now. Maybe next Sahasrara Day,

00:41:57.847 --> 00:42:05.290
if I am with you, we will start seeing what I have said today.

00:42:05.719 --> 00:42:10.352
But today all of you must know

00:42:10.553 --> 00:42:19.151
that you are the base of Sahaja Yoga in UK and in Europe.

00:42:19.352 --> 00:42:28.719
Try to become sincere and sincere and sincere and enjoy your sincerity.

00:42:37.068 --> 00:42:47.249
I bless you all with your sincerity and today I have to tell you

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:53.926
a few more secrets about Sahaja Yoga is that,

00:42:54.127 --> 00:43:00.783
for the puja, we should not get people who are of mediocre nature,

00:43:00.984 --> 00:43:06.081
because to bear up puja is very difficult.

00:43:07.356 --> 00:43:13.127
People have not yet understood the value of My Being,

00:43:13.266 --> 00:43:22.625
of My feet, of My hands, they cannot, they do not deserve to be here.

00:43:22.826 --> 00:43:25.354
So do not get anybody because he is your friend,

00:43:25.555 --> 00:43:30.485
or a sister, or a brother just down here.

00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:35.674
Is wrong. You are spoiling the chances of the poor person,

00:43:35.875 --> 00:43:40.705
because it is too much for him, he cannot bear it.

00:43:40.906 --> 00:43:44.425
It is meant for very few people.

00:43:44.626 --> 00:43:52.109
So remember that it is not meant for many people.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:44:02.322
Now what we call as the charan-amrut is, means the ambrose of My feet,

00:44:02.523 --> 00:44:12.125
or you can say ambrose of My feet, is not meant for everyone.

00:44:12.326 --> 00:44:18.493
Neither the blessings of the puja are not meant for everyone.

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:24.265
So try to avoid people who are not yet fully equipped.

00:44:24.466 --> 00:44:27.923
First thing they will start is doubting.

00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:35.043
If they do not doubt, also, there will be a problem with the protocol.

00:44:35.244 --> 00:44:38.574
They won’t be able to accept it with that protocol.

00:44:38.775 --> 00:44:44.145
It’s a very great privilege to be here

00:44:44.346 --> 00:44:51.385
and this privilege cannot be granted to every person.

00:44:55.685 --> 00:45:00.942
If you could understand this is the secret of Sahaja Yoga

00:45:01.143 --> 00:45:09.205
and in this secret, you have to get very few people to begin with.

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:17.756
Everything is going to be exposed one day, but not to everyone.

00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:30.427
If you can recognise this that you are privileged,

00:45:30.628 --> 00:45:37.303
then you will behave in a way that you have been given this privilege.

00:45:37.703 --> 00:45:45.554
Today’s day there are many people in the whole world who are meditating.

00:45:46.559 --> 00:45:51.447
I am thinking of all those people.

00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:55.877
You have to also think [of] all of them

00:45:55.964 --> 00:46:00.751
and know that they are part and parcel of My Being as you all are

00:46:00.952 --> 00:46:05.200
and you are the alert ones.

00:46:05.403 --> 00:46:13.758
So, at this time in this puja, you are not only doing puja for yourself,

00:46:13.959 --> 00:46:19.823
for London people, but for the whole world.

00:46:20.021 --> 00:46:26.152
Not only for Sahaja Yogis who are all over, of course for them also,

00:46:26.353 --> 00:46:35.410
but in this puja, you are expressing yourself as Sahaja Yogis,

00:46:35.611 --> 00:46:40.691
who have recognised Me and are requesting to bless the rest of the people

00:46:40.892 --> 00:46:46.804
so that they also recognise Me as you have recognised.

00:46:49.353 --> 00:46:57.002
By this puja, I hope recognition will be much more clearer.

00:46:57.203 --> 00:47:01.526
By My recognition only you will recognise yourself

00:47:01.727 --> 00:47:06.678
and the whole thing will work out in a very, very beautiful manner.

00:47:06.879 --> 00:47:10.862
As I have said, next year, on 5th of May,

00:47:11.063 --> 00:47:14.616
we’ll see the results of what I am saying today.

00:47:14.817 --> 00:47:18.205
Only thing [is] I want you to be sincere,

00:47:18.205 --> 00:47:22.132
not to play games in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:22.222 --> 00:47:25.267
It will harm you very much

00:47:25.468 --> 00:47:38.618
and harm also other Sahaja Yogis, so don’t try to play games.

00:47:38.819 --> 00:47:46.991
It will harm you because you will be harming the path of emancipation

00:47:47.192 --> 00:47:54.793
and as a result, you will be punished; as a result you, will be the loser.

00:47:54.994 --> 00:48:02.308
So please try to be sincere. It is not difficult.

00:48:02.647 --> 00:48:05.666
This is not the way to be taken: many people I have seen,

00:48:05.867 --> 00:48:08.722
they think I am chastitising and all these words are wrong

00:48:08.923 --> 00:48:11.102
for Mataji it should not be used, [that]

00:48:11.303 --> 00:48:15.073
there are many words which should not be used for Me.

00:48:15.274 --> 00:48:19.882
It is just your privilege to be here

00:48:20.083 --> 00:48:24.439
and [you] must understand that privileges are given to people

00:48:24.439 --> 00:48:27.549
who are deserving.

00:48:27.644 --> 00:48:32.062
I am telling you these things because you are deserving.

00:48:32.263 --> 00:48:38.073
And in that condition, you must understand that this is a great privilege

00:48:38.274 --> 00:48:43.416
that I am telling you all these things and that you should feel enamoured

00:48:43.617 --> 00:48:50.026
that I am telling you that sincerity is the key of your success.

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:52.936
It’s a privilege. I am giving you the key.

00:48:53.136 --> 00:48:56.960
While as it is, you see, the Western mind is,

00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:00.506
people think that, if you tell somebody something like that,

00:49:00.506 --> 00:49:06.397
they can use a word like ‘chastitise’ (sic) and all these words are not to be.

00:49:06.712 --> 00:49:11.222
Must use words which are protocolish. [It’s] not proper.

00:49:11.423 --> 00:49:16.586
If in your protocol you are not alright, you know how you start fitting

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:22.075
wrong bolts into wrong nuts and spoil the whole joke,

00:49:22.276 --> 00:49:25.676
so be careful as to how you take it.

00:49:25.877 --> 00:49:27.877
Take it as a privilege.

00:49:28.078 --> 00:49:31.689
It’s a VIP treatment for you, you are all VIP’s.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:37.934
I cannot talk like this to the multitudes, but I can tell you this,

00:49:38.135 --> 00:49:42.393
because I want to give you the complete keys.

00:49:42.615 --> 00:49:46.503
If you can look at yourself as how privileged you are

00:49:46.503 --> 00:49:53.651
and understanding it, understanding what all Sahaja Yoga is,

00:49:53.651 --> 00:50:03.684
then you will understand that what a privilege
it is for you to be here, what fortune,

00:50:03.885 --> 00:50:12.057
what reward for what you have done.

00:50:12.258 --> 00:50:24.964
How many lives have been completely rewarded by being here.

00:50:25.318 --> 00:50:33.357
This will help you to do puja in a more sincere manner.

00:50:33.576 --> 00:50:36.640
May God bless you.

00:50:36.787 --> 00:50:42.541
Now we must meditate, also, after puja,

00:50:42.742 --> 00:50:48.905
because My vibrations you do not suck in without meditation, I have seen.

00:50:49.106 --> 00:50:54.177
And always it happens. So far I have had very few pujas

00:50:54.378 --> 00:50:57.544
in which My whole vibrations were sucked in.

00:50:57.745 --> 00:51:01.153
If you have sincerity about it, really the sincerity part of it,

00:51:01.354 --> 00:51:06.146
you’ll suck all My vibrations.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:10.734
Tell your mind not to ask questions and to misbehave,

00:51:10.935 --> 00:51:14.511
but to suck the vibrations clearly.

00:51:14.712 --> 00:51:18.218
This is for your own nourishment,

00:51:18.419 --> 00:51:25.175
for your own growth, for your own enjoyment.

00:51:25.376 --> 00:51:26.814
May God bless you.

00:51:27.015 --> 00:51:34.428
Today I am so heavy laden already, that I can’t open My eyes.

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:39.458
May God bless you.
