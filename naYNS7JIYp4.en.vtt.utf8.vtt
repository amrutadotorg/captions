00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.800
Shri Krishna resides in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.000
In the center He resides as Shri Krishna.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.480
On the left-hand side His power, Vishnumaya, His sister, resides.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.200
There He resides as Gopala,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.680
as the one who lived in Gokul played as a child.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.360
On a right-hand side He resides

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.520
as the king who ruled in Dwarika, the king Shri Krishna.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.880
These are the three sides of our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.320
The people who use their right side to dominate others,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.600
use their voice to put down people,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.440
to show their authority,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.400
shout at people,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.240
are the people who get affected by the right side.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.480
The right side is caught up

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.840
on the physical side you get a very big problem,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.040
because the Right Heart cannot work out its flow.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.560
So you get what you call asthma and all these diseases.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.000
But specially when the Right Heart is affected

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.520
by the fathers problem.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.720
On the left side is the Vishnumaya,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.720
is the sisterly relationship.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.880
When the sister who is your pure relation

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.200
is not treated as the sister,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.560
when the attitude of a person towards women

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.320
is of indulgence and of lust,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.920
then he develops the Left Vishuddhi.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.680
When he develops a Left Vishuddhi very strongly

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.560
and if he has a bad Agya of he has eyes which are roving eyes,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.200
then this Left Vishuddhi causes lot of trouble.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.760
Left Vishuddhi can be also caused by, as you know,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.680
by feeling guilty about things for nothing at all.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.160
All these problems arise from Vishuddhi.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.320
But Vishuddhi Chakra has a specialty.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.640
When the humane beings raised their head upward

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.920
from Mother Earth towards the sky,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.200
sky is, ether is Shri Krishna's nature,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.280
when it raises head towards the ether, towards the sky,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.480
then this Vishuddhi Chakra developed into a different dimension

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.000
and people started developing ego and superego.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.200
Superego was already developed,

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.120
but ego developed in such a way,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.880
that it started suppressing the superego.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.480
That's how you have got conditionings on one side

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.520
of the Vishuddhi and ego on the other side.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.800
When I told you the other day that you give up your free will

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.440
in the sense that when you raised your head

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.440
you did it through your free will with your power of growing,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.800
that you had as animals.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.120
After that now you have reached to the humane level.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.600
And to rise above the humane level now

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.880
you have to do is to seek your complete freedom.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.960
And for that Vishuddhi Chakra is going to help you a lot.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.400
On this Vishuddhi Chakra we have to really pay full attention.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.080
It is such a complicated Chakra.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.280
It has all the vowels of a Devanagari's script

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.560
emitting out of the sound

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.720
of the shakti that is passing through it,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.480
of the Kundalini that is passing through it.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.080
So all the vowels are heard on these Chakras.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.920
These vowels are, as you know, sixteen in number.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.400
Without the vowel

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.800
in the Devanagari you cannot write anything.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.880
Vowels are the sustenance,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.600
are the power that

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.240
supports every consonant.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.720
So it's very important that our vowels

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:08.840
have to be fully nourished and respected.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.680
The movement of the neck,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.120
as you have seen in all international life,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.160
if you see, everybody has practically the same.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.520
Even those who cannot hear,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.560
those who do not understand your language,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.560
you can nod like this,

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.760
can say, "No", like this.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.680
Everyone understand this is "Yes" or "No".

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.640
In some particular area

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.080
of course they have little different type of nodding.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.480
But too much of nodding of head is not a very good sign.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.600
I have seen people in the West,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.160
if you tell them something

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.560
to show that they appreciated it,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.920
they'll go on for quite some time.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.680
That's not necessary.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.040
Just have to say, "Alright", or "I've understood it", that's all.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.680
You have to use your voice

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.160
instead of nodding like this all the time.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.800
Is very bad, very-very bad for the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.800
Or some of them are the other way round.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.720
That whatever it is they'll put up their head like this

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.960
and they won't talk properly,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.440
they will not say a word, they'll just keep quiet.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.560
You may go on pinching them, doing anything, they won't badge.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.400
This kind of personality is also very much detrimental

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.400
to the growth of their evolution.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:40.200
Apart from that, their Vishuddhi becomes a very big problem.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.000
Because of Vishuddhi there are so many problems.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.120
Like angina you develop because of Vishuddhi.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.560
You develop spondylosis because of Vishuddhi.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.680
Sometimes people lose their voices completely.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.520
Sometimes they have all the time coughing.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.720
And there are so many physical problems

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.960
out of Vishuddhi because, as I said,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.640
this a very-very complicated center,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.080
which looks after your ear, nose, throat, all the sixteenth

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.960
sub plexuses are there, which are looked after by this center.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.120
But above all is the center of discrimination.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.320
The center of discrimination only comes when you are free people.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.440
Till you are biased, till you have your own concept,

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.640
you cannot be discrete.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.160
And that's the one point where one must understand

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.360
that to achieve your complete freedom,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.240
you have to get your Vishuddhi Chakra cleared out.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:46.640
First and foremost thing is that we must speak in a sweet manner,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.760
speak to someone in a sweet manner,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.400
not artificially, but sweetly.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.720
Speak in a manner that another person likes it.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.200
Saptyam vadeyt, priyam vadeyt.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.480
Speak the truth, don't tell the lies.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.400
If you go on telling lies after some time,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.360
even if you tell the truth, it will become a lie.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.320
But if you are telling the truth,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:16.360
that even if you tell a lie, it becomes a truth.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.280
Now some people

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.000
think that they can be cunning,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.760
by their talks they can cheat people.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.520
But actually they are cheating themselves.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.320
All such people who cheat others

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.120
by sweet talks, by artificial talks

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.200
or by some maneuvering

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.160
go to such a horrible state

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.120
and in this Kali Yuga specially they are cursed

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.040
and they get exposed and people know about them,

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.760
that these are the greatest liars ever known.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.880
Now the times are coming

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.040
when all such people will be exposed

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.520
very much more than they have been ever exposed.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.120
So be careful not to think that you can cheat.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.760
In Sahaja Yoga specially you cannot cheat.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.480
Those who try to cheat sometimes think that,

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.200
"We can befool Mother, we can some or other carry on.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:27.600
If we see in front of Mother She won't know, what we are up to".

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.880
Is not so.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.560
I may not say, I may use My discretion not to say,

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.360
I may allow you to have a long way, but be careful.

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.800
Do not come into My illusions,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.600
I'm very illusive.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.040
And when I play My illusions you will suddenly find yourself

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.040
in a very difficult situation and then you will say,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.880
"Mother, why am I in this situation?"

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.960
So this is one of the qualities of Shri Krishna

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.240
that He is the one who becomes illusive.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.600
And His illusiveness not cunning but illusive.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.120
In His illusiveness He exposes people to themselves.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.680
There are so many stories of Shri Krishna

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.240
in which He had illusively acted to give

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.200
greater joy to some people,

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.600
to give nice lessons to some people

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.640
and sometimes to punish.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.880
For us it is important, that we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.480
in this lifetime we have a chance

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.640
our Kundalini has risen,

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.640
that we can face ourselves,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.720
that we can correct our chakras,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.400
that we know about ourselves,

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.480
that we know where is the problem is.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.960
I've known of people who were caught up with left Vishuddhis

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.560
and have become devilish by nature, devilish.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.560
They have gone out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.680
they have criticized Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.880
they have tried to trouble Me a lot.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160
So don't think that if Vishuddhi is spoiled

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.280
there's nothing so special about it.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.280
It can be a very dangerous center.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.560
Of course, Heart, Agya and Vishuddhi, these three centers

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.680
one has to guard against

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.960
because three of them can allow you

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.200
or can force you to become one with identification

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.600
of evil as your own.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.600
You might just feel that it's nice to be evil;

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.720
you might just feel that it is a great fun to be evil

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.160
and you might become evil.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:52.360
So at the Vishuddhi Chakra one has to be extremely careful.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.680
Vishuddhi Chakra you looks after so many things,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.080
specially your skin, your eyes.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.040
Skin is now I've seen people who have bad Vishuddhi

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.080
can have all kinds of funny troubles with their skins.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:08.440
Of course, it has to do with your liver,

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.800
but skin is the way it shines,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.640
the way it glows,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.720
depends on how you smile,

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.880
how you look at the world.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.480
Many people have a habit of smiling for nothing at all.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.560
Specially women I have seen, ladies I have seen,

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.120
they just smile stupidly.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.320
That's not [inaudible], one should not be stupid.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.320
Stupidity is against Shri Krishna's principle.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.720
Like you have seen the stupid people, how they are.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.320
Their tongue is always halfway out.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.560
If you have noticed the stupid man,

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.480
his face is that, his tongue is always out,

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:02.480
mouth half open and he looks like a dumbfound fool.

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.600
Now in this only the Vishuddhi plays the part.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.640
Another one is the one where

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.920
you get the Vishddhi's straits.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.680
So such a person has very purse lips,

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.400
angry lips and he doesn't talk.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.560
The another one might even get the expression of an idiot,

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.360
but could be just making a face like that.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:41.320
Because if he's cunning he may take a

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.680
I would say a kind of a

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.560
rupa or... (yogi: "Mask").

00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:53.680
Mask you can say, a mask on his face,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:59.280
that he is an idiot and make high to deceive you.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.520
So nothing is definite about Vishuddhi.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.720
Whatever may be the expression of a person,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.040
a person may look very innocent.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.920
Because that's the thing you can do with your Vishuddhi.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.400
You are free because you've raised your head

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.640
and this point you have achieved, this kind of a special aptitude

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.440
that you can deceive yourself and you can deceive others.

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.840
Some people look extremely innocent on the face.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.560
They may look to be very simple people,

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.520
but may turn out to be horrid.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.640
Some people may look to be idiotic,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.560
but may be very intelligent.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.840
So it is how you play with your Vishuddhi

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:45.720
which is, which is responsible.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.680
But the main thing what I'm trying to tell you,

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.160
that you can maneuver your Vishuddhi.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.400
The way you want to put your expression,

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.280
the way want you make your face,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.440
the way you want to suggest something,

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.600
all you can maneuver

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.880
and you can keep your heart away from it.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.480
In the heart you may have poison for a person,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.040
but outwardly you may say

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:11.040
to that person in a very sweet manner something

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.960
that a person might feel impressed.

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.080
But in this all this behavior, pattern of behavior,

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.360
you are deceiving yourself, not deceiving the another person.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.760
Because yourself is Spirit,

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.280
which knows you very well.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.680
And this will go on and on

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.240
for all your lives that have to come.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:40.320
So there is no need in any way to be artificial in your expression,

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.200
there is no need to hide anything in your expression.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.480
Of course, I mean, if you don't like someone

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.400
you need not just say, "I don't like you",

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.560
but in that case you have to be

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.800
not also so much appreciative of the person,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.760
that he's deluded into your appreciation.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:02.760
Now, eyes are very important

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.720
and eyes in a way are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.760
because the muscles of the eyes

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.720
are looked after by Vishuddhi.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.880
And the kind of the muscles we have

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.640
which pull our eyes,

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.360
which close our eyelids and all that is very much suggestive.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:29.320
You must noticed that there are some people who come to Me,

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.200
their eyes go on like this.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.600
When they close their eyes, they cannot keep it shut.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.160
There are some people, when they open their eyes to Me

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.920
they just keep the eyes open, they just cannot close it.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.720
Both are in trouble.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.360
The ones which are the ones,

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.800
which are just keeping the eyes open all the time,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.920
are the people having supraconscious.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.560
And those who flicking their eyes are having the subconscious.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.720
Some people have also

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:08.120
habit of eh keeping the eyes in an angle all the time

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.480
they never see you straight,

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.800
but in angle they'll see.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.320
Ah, they think it's sometimes it's very fashionable sometimes,

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.880
ladies think it's a very good way of looking at people

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.160
and some of them have such eyes

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.600
that they'll go on and looking and boring

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.680
their greedy eyes onto others,

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.960
or their lusty eyes onto others.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.920
This is the worst thing you can do to your eyes,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.880
because such people are easily can become blind.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.760
Such people might have trouble of the eyes.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.600
Specially reddening of the eyes

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.520
can come to such people

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.840
very much, very quickly.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.400
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes very pure.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.280
The eyes of an Yogeshwara, who was Shri Krishna.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.160
He was a witness,

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.000
He, He was on this Earth,

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.480
He play, He played with Radha. He married five women,

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.360
they were the five elements.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.440
Sixteen thousand women He married,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.480
they were His sixteen thousand powers,

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.960
but He was Yogeshwara.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.720
He was Yogeshwara;

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.400
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about them, at all.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.480
He was beyond them, He was Yogeshwara.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.600
That was the testing point of His,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.240
that He had no lust in His eyes about these women that He had.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.280
Such an Yogeshwara is there!

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.120
Of course, I don't expect you to be Shri Krishna.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.440
But you have your wife.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.280
Those who do not have wife must look forward to a wife.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.480
That we'll get wives and will be,

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.560
ah, we'll have a wife and think of a wife,

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.880
who will be your own

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:57.000
so that your eyes will not fall onto every woman

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.160
who comes across ah with that kind of a thing.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.480
I've seen people, even the photographs or anything they see,

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.080
it's surprising, I mean, there's nothing in the photograph,

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.200
what is in a photograph?

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.840
But even a photograph can attract their attention,

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.720
I mean, I don't know what can attract their attention like this.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.080
But they are so vulnerable and they have no control over their eyes.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.720
No control, they become absolutely lost and they have no control.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.360
That shows that they have no powers in them

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.440
and they are slaves of their responses.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.360
For the eyes are very-very important as Christ has said,

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:34.360
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes".

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.920
There should be no adultery.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:41.640
Some people have a habit of showing anger with the eyes, you see.

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.320
If they have to show anger with their eyes

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.960
they'll just go on looking like this and show the anger.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.480
I need there not do that to you, but.

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:57.400
And the angry eyes you see are another dangerous things

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.840
to do with your eyes,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.160
because then they can become mesmeric.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.880
If you start putting your eyes onto something

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.280
and concentrating on it your eyes might become mesmeric

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.640
means bhoots will start coming out of your eyes.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.920
First of all you'll catch bhoots in your eyes,

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.920
they'll settle down there and then

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.520
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.600
It's a very-very dangerous thing

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.960
to go on looking at something continuously with concentration.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.600
There's another kind of a stupid thing or a bhootish thing maybe,

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.240
that people ask you to meditate here. It's absolutely wrong.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.640
In Gita it is written, still it is wrong.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.600
Nobody should put attention here.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.480
Instead of put attention, put attention at the door.

00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:48.320
What's the use of looking at a window?

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.960
You can't get out of it, can you?

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:55.200
If you have to look at anything be on a lookout for the door.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.120
And the door is here.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.680
The door of Sahasrara is to be open out.

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.480
So you should not try to concentrate on this path.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.600
Many people who have concentrated on this path have become mad.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.360
When they become mad, people say,

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.720
"These are Yogi but has got [SOUNDS LIKE - unmanitasha]."

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.520
That he moves like a madcap.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.960
How can a Yogi be a madcap?

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.960
That means he's united with God. Is He mad?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.360
All such mad people are really mad,

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.720
they've nothing to do with God, definitely.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.040
But there are people who believe in such things,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.120
"Oh, he is in love with God,"

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.760
so he just jumps on the stage and goes into ecstasy,

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.360
dances like a madcap.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.800
How can God be mad?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.520
First position is this that the sanest personality is God,

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.160
has to be.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.960
From where do the sanity comes?

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.320
So this is one thing one has to understand,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.200
that any such practices

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:02.320
can lead you to lunacy and one should not doing.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.640
Thirdly in the indiscretion that one has

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.480
comes from people who are good hearted, nice people,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:16.080
but they get kind away by the smiles of others

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.320
or by the artificial goodness they show on their faces.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.240
I've known some people, they always have a face like

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.600
as if they are all the time smiling.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.160
No, I can't do that way.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.000
All the time if you look at someone like this, you see.

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.920
It means as if you are mocking at the person.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.520
And there are people I've seen who just like this

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.160
all the time have them [lips] like this.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.880
So, one should not be always in one pose.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.400
Sometimes this muscles can get very weak

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.800
and start paining if you take one.

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:54.880
There are some others

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.920
who always try to show they are very miserable.

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.880
I don't know what do they want to attract.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.000
Attract the attention of others,

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.640
attract ah the bhoots in themselves

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.640
or I don't know what are they up to,

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.280
why can't they keep a normal face.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.240
Even while sitting in dhaan, or meditation,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.720
I've seen that trying to show Me or may whatever it is,

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.040
because My eyes are mostly closed, but doesn't matter.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.720
When I open My eyes I find some people like this, like that.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:33.160
Why? What is the need? You have to have a balanced face.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.280
That's what Shri Krishna had described the Sthita Pragya,

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.400
One who is balanced,

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.600
who doesn't laugh like an idiot,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.200
who laughs, but not like an idiot.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:51.240
Nor he's a serious like another kind of an idiot.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.320
So both the things are not at all

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.840
expression of your inner being.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.400
Such a person is, as I told you today,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.440
is not frivolous, but not serious either,

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.400
but full of joy within himself.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.200
He doesn't want you to be unhappy,

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.360
never would like that you should be unhappy people.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.240
But human beings if they want to be unhappy,

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.520
what can anybody help,

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.840
because they have got the free will to be unhappy.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.920
They have got a free will to cut their nose,

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.080
they've a free will to cut their ears,

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.760
they've a free will to commit suicide.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.560
They have this free will so-called.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:40.160
Now the greatest freewill comes from Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.080
as I told you and that's why we call Him Yogeshwara,

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.800
He is the Ishwara of Yoga.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.720
The establishment of Yoga is possible

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.400
when you surrender yourself to Shri Krishna.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.600
Completely surrenders yourself to Shri Krishna.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.400
Your Yoga will be established. Means what?

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:05.160
Means all your balances will be established.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.880
You go into complete balance

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.400
and that balance is complete because Vishnu,

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.880
Who is the Incarnation for sustaining the dharma,

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.040
Who is responsible for giving you the balance,

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.760
becomes complete in the form of Shri Krishna.

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.600
That's why He said that, "You leave all the dharmas

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.080
[SOUNDS LIKE - sarva dharma nam partitte jam ma meik shana wraja]",

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.480
that's why surrender all of them to Me.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.960
So all the dharmas if you put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.880
means if you follow His ideals,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.520
then all your dharmas are balanced.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:56.880
But after Realization you go beyond dharma.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.400
Whenever you go wrong in dharma,

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:02.960
[SOUNDS LIKE - dharmatchutta] as they call it,

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.480
when you go wrong in dharma,

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.600
that's the time you have to surrender yourself to Shri Krishna,

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.360
so that He establishes your dharma.

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.480
There are so many dharmas.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:16.720
There is the pati dharm -

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.760
husbands dharma, patni dharma - wive's dharma,

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.600
father's dharma, mother's dharma, son's dharmas,

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.280
the [SOUNDS LIKE - rashtra] dharma - means the nations dharma.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.040
Then you have all kinds of dharmas also

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.960
of we can say ah where one has to bow

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:40.200
to the higher things of life.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.960
But then He says, "[SOUNDS LIKE - Sarva dharma anam pari tedg]"

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.840
"Forget all the dharmas."

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.400
"[SOUNDS LIKE-Maa meikam charanam gachchhami ]", -

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.280
"Just surrender your dharmas, all of them to Me",

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.520
that is at Vishuddhi.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.400
At Vishuddhi Chakra you surrender all your other dharmas.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.920
It means that it all gets sublimated,

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.760
it all gets complete, the wholesomeness is achieved

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.400
because He is collective being,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.640
He is the Virat,

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:26.160
because He is the integrated form of all the dharmas

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.200
and He is the Virata in our brain.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.960
He represents our brain.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.760
And when this Virat in us is awakened fully,

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.880
then all the dharmas become natural with us.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.600
We don't have to do any dharmas,

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.200
we don't have to be conscious of any dharmas,

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.360
but automatically we become dharma ourselves.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.320
For example, there are people now, say, Christ;

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.720
we can take example of Christ.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.720
He was dharma personified.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.880
He would not steal money from anybody, will He?

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:07.680
Will He run away with somebody's wife, will He?

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:11.560
When He do anything wrong? No, He cannot.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.360
Why? Because He was Dharma.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.480
So now you have become dharmateet,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.520
means you have entered into the kingdom of God,

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.080
into the Virata's conditions

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.320
and there your condition is such that your state is such,

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:33.040
your state is such, that you are dharma.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.360
If you try to do adharma, you'll suffer.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.960
If you try to do wrong, you'll suffer.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:42.960
Here I don't have to tell you to be righteous;

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.240
I don't have to tell you, there's no need.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.280
I don't have to tell you that you tell the truth.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.400
I don't have to tell you, "Don't steal".

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.720
I don't have to do all these things.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.160
Only thing I can tell you

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:56.120
that get rid of your ego and superego, that's all.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.280
In a very general terminology.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:04.560
But you will follow Christ automatically,

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:09.120
you will follow Krishna automatically, Sahaj,

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.480
because now you have gone beyond dharma,

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.040
you have crossed the limits of dharma

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.200
where you had to follow a dharma,

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:21.560
now you have become the dharma.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.000
Where you will stand, wherever you will be

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.280
dharma will stand with you.

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.080
People will look at you and say, "Here is a dharma standing,

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.480
he's the dharma to be worshipped".

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.600
Not because of anything but because your state

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.000
is that of dharma, you have gone beyond that.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.920
Supposing this is loudspeaker I'm using today to talk to you.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.920
But supposing this loudspeaker becomes part and parcel of Me,

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.120
I don't have to use this, I go beyond it.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.560
In the same way

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.880
you are using the dharma first of all to establish yourself.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.880
But when you go beyond dharma

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.840
into the state of Virata,

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.240
then you don't need any dharma,

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.640
you become the dharma of Virat.

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.560
Now, what is the dharma of Virat,

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.680
what is the dharma of Shri Krishna

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.360
is collectivity.

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.000
Krishna

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:29.040
is the Brain.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.360
Shiva is the Heart

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.240
and Brahmadeva is the Liver.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.400
Now what's the faculty of this brain is?

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:44.880
That the tree of life of evolution grows downward as He says.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.240
And this tree is growing downwards

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.800
of awareness from the brain.

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.560
But if you have to go to the roots

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:59.160
you have to ascend and that ascent you have achieved,

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.040
now you have gone to the roots of your brain

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.800
where all your roots are enlightened,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.640
all your nerves are enlightened,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.040
your brain is enlightened,

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.000
you are an enlightened person.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.320
When you are in darkness

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.280
you may catch hold of a snake as rope,

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.080
but when you are in light you will drop it.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.320
In the same way, when you become enlightened,

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.200
your dharma is enlightened.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.560
You don't have to take to any guru

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.360
or to any book or to anyone,

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.840
you know yourself in your own life that this is wrong.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.600
Now the collectivity part of it is very important.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:42.400
Anybody who cannot be collective is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.720
Not yet a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.560
Collective in the sense

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.600
that anybody who cannot live with other Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.200
who tries to find faults with someone all the time,

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:56.120
wants to run away with his wife

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.120
and'll stay somewhere else or with her husband,

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.360
who wants to get out, is not a person who's collective.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.040
There's no need to say

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:07.440
that, "I cannot live under the circumstances

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.000
in which Sahaja Yogis can live".

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.440
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if are a Yogi, you can live.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.360
Look at Me, I'm such an old woman, I can live anywhere.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:17.840
You take Me to a village,

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.680
you take Me to any place I'm not bothered

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.520
about any physical comforts at all.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.560
Because I'm comfortable within Myself.

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.920
My comforts are within.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.400
In the same way, a person who is not collective,

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.920
like many people just come to Pujas, that's all.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.560
It's like going to the church only once in Christmas

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.280
and then say, "Christ doesn't look after us".

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.040
Of course, not going to church and you don't meet Christ,

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.560
but I mean to say that just to have a casual way

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.040
of Sahaja Yoga you cannot gain.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.280
You have to be collective.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.520
And collective means

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.600
that at every collective program you should be there.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.360
You should always meet collectively,

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:02.120
meditate collectively, live collectively,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.560
and try to find ways and methods of being collective.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.840
There are so many evil forces,

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.600
which are all the time trying to attack collectivity.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.240
First they will attack the leaders.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.880
That's the first thing.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.160
Any leader tell somebody, "You shouldn't do like this",

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.360
immediately that person will start spreading stories against,

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.960
"That leader is very bad, he's like this, he's very harsh.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:28.160
He didn't garland me, he didn't give me this, that".

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.840
How can you garland a bhoot, can you?

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:37.520
That if that in that ah doesn't work out

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.160
then they have their sly methods

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:42.120
of going round and talking something here and there

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:45.440
in the ears to create some sort of a politics.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:50.320
All such people will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.480
As there is a centrifugal and a centripetal force,

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.960
both acting equal and opposite.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.000
Anybody who goes against collectivity,

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.440
who sticks to their bhoots, sticks to their negativity

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.440
will have to get out of Sahaja Yoga

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.080
and that's is to be remembered,

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.040
that to be collective is to be joyous,

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.680
is to be progressive, to be going further.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:21.440
It was alright when people were meditating in the Himalayas.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.200
It was alright at that time they were all alone,

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:25.640
meditating all alone,

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.560
to achieve something for the collective.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:34.720
But they also did not get their Realization.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.160
When you have got your Realization remember this.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:42.000
Now you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.000
into the Kingdom of Virat

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:50.240
where you are a part and parcel of a collective being.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.120
You are not alone, you cannot be single out,

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.160
you cannot separate yourself.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:02.120
Now you are awakened in the body of Virata

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.320
and you cannot get out of it.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.400
If you try to get out of it, you cannot be nourished.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.760
Supposing, I take out part of My body.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.840
Will it be nourished by this body? It won't.

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.760
In the same way you have now become

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.240
part and parcel of that collectivity

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.560
and that collectivity that Virat is going to look after you,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.000
going to nourish you,

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.240
going to do the everything that is necessary

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.040
for your spiritual, physical, mental, emotional,

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.480
even financial development.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.440
But if you cut it short, if you

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.480
try to block the collectivity,

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.560
if you try to make problems for collectivity

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.240
or even if you try just to get out of the collectivity,

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:52.360
then that is not our interest, that is not our work.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.760
This is to be understood fully,

00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:00.160
in every way possible

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.280
and this when is understood in a proper way,

00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.120
you should know that

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.880
collectivity is not only your advancement,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.360
is not only your development,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:17.120
is not only your achievements,

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.080
is the achievement of the whole humanity.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:26.440
The purpose of your creation

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.040
is fulfilled by that.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.840
Those people who live in the ashram

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.640
are better of always, than the people who live alone, always.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.000
They will always have better results,

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:46.160
than the people who live alone.

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.640
Maybe they live alone

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.520
because they want to have a little private life or a privacy.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.760
But their privacy is not going to help them.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.880
That's not going to help them at all.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.760
The more we live together,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.560
the more you reside together,

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.000
the more you enjoy together,

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:09.520
there will be greater chances of your advancement.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.520
The more you will try to make yourself private,

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.400
the more you'll try to get out of it,

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.880
whatever explanation you may give,

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.440
God understands, very well.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.000
So all such things where you cut off yourself

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.680
from the mainstream,

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:27.600
you try to get out of the main stream,

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.360
then there is a big problem for you.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.680
Of course, for certain conveniences you may,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.160
for your certain understanding you may,

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.000
but you should enjoy more the company of Sahaja Yogis,

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.400
than your own private company

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.800
in the dingy room of yours.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.000
That is one thing you can judge yourself.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.080
Do you all enjoy the company of Sahaja Yogis

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.600
or you enjoy the company

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:01.840
of three-four of your family people together in a circus.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.400
Judgment is your own.

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.680
Yogi "A difficulty Shri Mataji".

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.840
Nothing is difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.400
It is the simplest thing to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:19.800
And even more simple to be collective.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.880
To be uncollective you have to do something.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.440
Like I said that it is very easy not to drink.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.160
Mean, I mean, drink some wines and things.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.920
Because if you don't want to drink you are sitting at home,

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.440
it's alright, don't have to do anything.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.960
But supposing you have to drink,

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.640
then you have to go a pub or you have to go somebody,

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.360
open the bottle, get a particular type of a glass,

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.640
pour it down, this, that.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:45.840
In India, for example, where there is prohibition,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:47.640
you are sitting with a fright.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.840
But for a person who just drinks water he doesn't have to do it.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.560
So to do wrong one has to do something.

00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:02.880
But to be good you don't have to do much.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.560
Is absolutely labor saving, energy saving process

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.080
You see, to do bad, supposing, you see,

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.920
I ah want to harm somebody,

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:21.760
I'll have to go out of the way to find out ways, methods.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.720
If I to tell lies I have to think of ten lies to cover that one lie.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.160
But if I tell the truth, finished,

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:32.480
I am still I've told the truth, finished, with few words it's done.

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.240
So to be collective is much more easier.

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.880
Of course, not for crooked people,

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.040
because crooked people whenever they move

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:42.560
their angularities trouble others.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:47.560
You see, like ah ah poking ah of thorns.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.520
But those who are flowers they fitting anywhere,

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.520
people like them.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.800
They like their fragrance,

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.800
they look at them, they enjoy them beautiful things.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.320
Now see, today they are looking like lotuses.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.440
How is it? Without doing anything they have become lotuses.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.320
How? How they have become like lotuses?

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.680
Whether they are lotuses or they are daisies God only knows.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.760
But they have become lotuses Sahaj.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.480
How? Because they are one with God.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.120
When we stand in our own way,

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.120
when we try to do something privately,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.960
then God said, "Alright, go private'.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:41.880
But when we are public He looks after us.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.920
And then in Sahaj Yoga, as you know,

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.800
that collective growth

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:56.720
is the only way we understand Sahaj Yoga.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.960
Somebody knows something, somebody knows something else,

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:02.160
somebody knows something else.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.560
When we are collective,

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.880
then we really understand every aspect of Sahaj Yoga.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.480
Supposing, there is somebody a scientist,

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.240
somebody is a musician,

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:14.800
somebody is another thing.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.720
We cannot know everything.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.480
So you know something from this one,

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:19.760
something from that one,

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.200
something from that.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:24.560
So all the rivers has it's flowing into that collectivity

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.680
and you enjoy the ocean of these ah rivers.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.920
You don't have to go to all the rivers in India,

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.040
like you go from Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Kaweri

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.400
you thousands of lives.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.800
Go to the sea, all of them are there.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:48.760
Like that you have to enjoy the sea where everything meets.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:53.960
All kinds of beautiful things are there and you enjoy that.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.480
I hope this Puja which is a very remarkable Puja.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:01.800
Firstly so many things are Sahaj.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.040
Firstly they told Me

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.960
the telephone number of this place is 32 16 32.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:16.240
He, He's accompanied by 64 Yoginis, Shri Krishna.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.080
So 32 on this side and 32 on that side and He sitting here

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:25.200
This place is called as Black ah Lake.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.440
Krishna is black.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.800
This place they got suddenly

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:32.120
and this is the only place in this

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:36.680
so-called military regime of Switzerland

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:41.240
where people can sleep on the ground.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.440
You are not supposed to sleep on the ground.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.080
If there's no cot you hang in the

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.360
air, but you cannot touch the ground.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.480
That kind of the stupid military business is here.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.720
Where to find such a sensible, practical,

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:01.760
such a cheap place for you is godsent.

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:06.520
We are here surrounded by beautiful things with the cows,

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:11.720
so many cows at the time when it is Krishna's birthday.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.800
So many cows, so fond of cows

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.200
and the cows when they their bells

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.480
move in the morning I heard, in the evening so beautiful

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.320
and when they are moving home in the evening

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.920
how the as they call [SOUNDS LIKE -guraj] -

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.120
is the dust of their feet was filling the sky

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.840
is just Gokul here I felt.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.680
Today also there's one thing more one has to say,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.560
that is the sixteenth Shri Krishna Puja.

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:47.160
So in so many ways this is a very great Puja

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:51.040
which you are attending for which

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.840
people have to take thousands and thousands of janmas (births)

00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.520
do so many punyas, which you have got so Sahaj,

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.400
because there must be something about you people also.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.880
May God bless you.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.600
Now, what are we decided?

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:43.880
Now they have got ah mantras

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:48.360
written in Sanskrit that

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:56.600
and 108 Names of Shri Krishna [NOT AUDIBLE] they got.

00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.160
The one, one Rustam has done them in Sanskrit

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.080
and Gregoire has done them in.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.360
I think everybody's hearing Me, aren't you?

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:09.960
And Gregoire has because you have to hear Me from Sahastrara,

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.360
you can.

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:16.320
And Gregoire has done in English language.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:21.480
So we'll have

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:27.280
two types of Sanskrit and English words,

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:32.880
describing Shri Krishna's nature.

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.480
"Now today let the all the Sagittarius to [INAUDIBLE- My Puja?].

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.560
It's Krisna's rashi Sagittarius, [SOUNDS LIKE - nurtaras].

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.200
Sagittarius, how many you are? Come along.

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:38.480
"Dhanur dhara - that is one of the Names of Shri Krishna ...

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:43.120
[A FEW INDIAN WORDS] or Madhusudana."
