00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:10.059
The Shakti of forgiveness too is great.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.999
You should also learn to forgive.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.205
I see that, in Sahaja Yoga people forgive very little.

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:16.609
Learn to forgive,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.606
Without forgiving, you cannot get realisation on your own.

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.832
For example, if somebody has hurt you,

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.311
and you didn't forgive him, then what did you do?

00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:28.068
You didn't do anything.

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:32.743
If you didn't forgive, means, you didn't do anything.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:36.353
Even if you forgive, strictly speaking means you didn't do anything.

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:37.867
But if you say, i forgive,

00:00:37.948 --> 00:00:42.467
then by not forgiving, you were playing in other's hands

00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:45.138
he loses all his Shakti.

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:48.067
The destructive power gets destroyed.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.193
But those who are forgiving,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.907
their Shakti is so powerful, that wherever they stand,

00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:57.943
because of their forgiveness, people can become pious.

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:00.877
Their vices of numerous births, can be washed out.

00:01:01.168 --> 00:01:02.757
From all previous birth's

00:01:03.023 --> 00:01:06.352
whatsoever problems, they have accumulated, can be over,

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:08.280
because, he they have forgiven.

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:11.407
Redemption from all sins is obtained only by kshma Shakti.

00:01:11.668 --> 00:01:16.434
Many a times, we say to God, "You are ocean of forgiveness !"

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:19.353
We also say, that you are the remover of sins.

00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:22.126
We also say, "Destroy our papaas."

00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:24.286
How can He do? Only by forgiveness !

00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:26.417
By his uttering only one word 'forgive',

00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:30.394
by his one sight, by the sight of forgiveness only,

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:32.214
all the sins are destroyed.

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:34.975
But because we have not seen such people,

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:38.689
We don't even think about such people,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.826
We can't even believe, that such people can be in the world.

00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:46.377
We have to find such people today.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.376
And you know, what you were, are not today.

00:01:51.457 --> 00:01:53.854
and what you are today, you won't be like that tomorrow.

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:56.464
Tommorow, such people will be in Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:59.296
who have kindness, forgiveness and peacefulness.

00:01:59.977 --> 00:02:02.163
All these Shakhtis, are ignited.

00:02:02.364 --> 00:02:05.245
On account of those, We will get all type of

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:08.110
comfort, pleasure and peace in the whole universe.

00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:12.289
Those who have said,"I will do this, i will do that,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.977
will bring all the comfort to the world,"

00:02:15.058 --> 00:02:18.371
and many have said, that the world should be filled with happiness.

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:24.781
Marx has said, and you have come to know that many saints have said,

00:02:25.236 --> 00:02:28.732
that whole world should be joyful. How can it be?

00:02:28.813 --> 00:02:30.117
There is only one way.

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:35.065
When a human being, in his ascent, will find his Kundalini awakened

00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:41.127
then his mental, spiritual and physical, material assets

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:44.985
not only this much, but in all respects

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:48.545
his Shakti will be so transformable,

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:50.815
that he will be able to transform every thing.

00:02:50.902 --> 00:02:54.967
If there is any problem he will transform it
if there is a wave he will transform it

00:02:55.048 --> 00:02:57.249
if there is a mountain he can climb it.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.094
This great Shakti can come inside your being through Kundalini,

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:02.996
because you have achieved your Spirit.

00:03:03.077 --> 00:03:05.494
So to receive this Shakti,

00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:08.439
the small small laws of Sahaja Yoga should be followed.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.524
First of all, forgive your self,

00:03:10.637 --> 00:03:13.212
first of all, love yourself,

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:16.444
First of all know your self esteem.
