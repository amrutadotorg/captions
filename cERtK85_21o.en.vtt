00:11:14.849 --> 00:11:20.362
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:26.966
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

00:11:41.135 --> 00:11:52.823
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

00:11:53.024 --> 00:12:05.824
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:16.728
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

00:12:16.929 --> 00:12:20.704
of the Mother and Christ.

00:12:36.119 --> 00:12:41.349
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:47.915
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

00:12:54.527 --> 00:12:58.507
And when they could not explain it,

00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:06.467
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

00:13:16.432 --> 00:13:19.631
Even before Christ, they used to have

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:24.215
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

00:13:24.416 --> 00:13:31.406
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

00:13:46.024 --> 00:13:53.167
to worship what they call Yahovah.

00:13:58.261 --> 00:14:05.155
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

00:14:12.004 --> 00:14:17.979
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

00:14:20.003 --> 00:14:24.732
She incarnated before also.

00:14:26.592 --> 00:14:31.350
She incarnated as Sita,

00:14:32.861 --> 00:14:38.849
and then She incarnated as Radha,

00:14:39.168 --> 00:14:44.476
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:49.764
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

00:14:49.965 --> 00:14:55.090
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

00:15:03.424 --> 00:15:09.033
He was the son of Radha.

00:15:09.547 --> 00:15:15.317
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

00:15:17.627 --> 00:15:27.093
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

00:15:30.025 --> 00:15:34.576
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

00:15:34.777 --> 00:15:43.832
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:57.480
All the description about Jesus Christ

00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:05.196
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

00:16:14.194 --> 00:16:21.710
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

00:16:21.911 --> 00:16:24.323
with immaculate conception,

00:16:24.532 --> 00:16:30.617
which She had done before also, as Radha.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:57.178
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:10.235
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:23.402
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

00:17:23.603 --> 00:17:29.515
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:42.639
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

00:17:46.373 --> 00:17:58.468
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

00:18:04.953 --> 00:18:13.973
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

00:18:14.174 --> 00:18:18.998
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:25.416
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

00:18:40.273 --> 00:18:47.766
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

00:18:54.783 --> 00:19:03.671
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:17.145
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:26.575
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

00:19:28.266 --> 00:19:32.875
because He is just vibrations.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:43.514
So when you do puja to Me,

00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:50.039
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:04.631
If they had done puja to Christ -

00:20:04.832 --> 00:20:12.545
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

00:20:19.165 --> 00:20:26.957
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

00:20:27.158 --> 00:20:36.381
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:52.102
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

00:20:58.586 --> 00:21:07.332
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:20.751
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

00:21:25.012 --> 00:21:30.465
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:35.917
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

00:21:40.194 --> 00:21:43.696
which is the swayambhu,

00:21:44.548 --> 00:21:48.352
is created by the Mother Earth.

00:21:49.376 --> 00:21:55.812
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

00:22:01.496 --> 00:22:08.708
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

00:22:17.004 --> 00:22:25.573
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:36.196
So I went to see that place

00:22:36.397 --> 00:22:43.973
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

00:22:44.174 --> 00:22:48.670
about say, five inches, at the most.

00:22:55.453 --> 00:22:59.633
And the face was just like Mine,

00:23:01.331 --> 00:23:04.741
exactly like Mine.

00:23:04.942 --> 00:23:11.971
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

00:23:12.172 --> 00:23:20.760
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

00:23:32.727 --> 00:23:35.301
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

00:23:35.502 --> 00:23:41.281
and they started following under a rock,

00:23:46.089 --> 00:23:52.792
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

00:23:56.975 --> 00:23:58.821
And in that light they walked,

00:23:59.022 --> 00:24:02.207
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

00:24:02.408 --> 00:24:08.381
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

00:24:20.892 --> 00:24:27.290
So they worship that statue in that place.

00:24:30.932 --> 00:24:36.935
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

00:24:41.076 --> 00:24:44.894
as I give you vibrations,

00:24:45.095 --> 00:24:48.487
but not so much

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.055
as I give you.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:56.273
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

00:24:56.474 --> 00:25:00.413
who might be giving you vibrations.

00:25:03.879 --> 00:25:08.047
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

00:25:08.248 --> 00:25:11.804
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

00:25:12.005 --> 00:25:16.452
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

00:25:26.766 --> 00:25:29.961
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:34.839
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:49.950
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

00:25:56.287 --> 00:26:01.017
and there are many sweet water wells there.

00:26:03.482 --> 00:26:06.752
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

00:26:06.953 --> 00:26:10.527
many people took photograph.

00:26:14.366 --> 00:26:20.593
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

00:26:22.746 --> 00:26:27.954
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

00:26:28.155 --> 00:26:37.947
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

00:26:38.169 --> 00:26:43.751
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

00:26:57.183 --> 00:27:02.200
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:07.365
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:20.252
Same is the puja.

00:27:20.593 --> 00:27:27.950
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

00:27:31.158 --> 00:27:39.360
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

00:27:46.009 --> 00:27:52.746
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

00:28:00.804 --> 00:28:03.338
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

00:28:03.539 --> 00:28:12.447
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

00:28:19.888 --> 00:28:28.283
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

00:28:32.183 --> 00:28:35.942
what powers He gives you.

00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:38.758
When you praise those qualities,

00:28:38.959 --> 00:28:45.835
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

00:28:56.545 --> 00:29:00.302
This is how the Divine works,

00:29:02.085 --> 00:29:07.167
as if you get charged with those qualities.

00:29:11.174 --> 00:29:17.478
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:28.982
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

00:29:33.952 --> 00:29:37.776
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

00:29:37.977 --> 00:29:43.075
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

00:29:48.124 --> 00:29:50.789
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

00:29:50.989 --> 00:29:54.348
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:58.919
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:19.942
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

00:30:30.527 --> 00:30:34.233
It could not happen earlier,

00:30:36.141 --> 00:30:43.975
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:55.932
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

00:30:56.133 --> 00:30:59.094
that I look like you, I behave like you,

00:30:59.295 --> 00:31:01.181
I have made Myself exactly like you -

00:31:01.382 --> 00:31:05.498
very difficult to make, but I have.

00:31:26.848 --> 00:31:30.858
And this body has to bear lots of things

00:31:31.059 --> 00:31:40.796
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

00:31:51.573 --> 00:31:54.922
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

00:31:55.123 --> 00:31:58.901
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

00:31:59.102 --> 00:32:03.138
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

00:32:03.339 --> 00:32:08.666
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

00:32:08.867 --> 00:32:12.306
and moving very fast.

00:32:25.021 --> 00:32:29.155
Now I have to bear it.

00:32:29.356 --> 00:32:34.465
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

00:32:41.251 --> 00:32:47.090
Because He is very direct,

00:32:49.418 --> 00:32:55.987
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:08.340
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:16.595
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

00:33:30.812 --> 00:33:35.110
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:39.817
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

00:33:40.033 --> 00:33:44.468
so I take time to take them out.

00:34:00.136 --> 00:34:02.564
So all these things are very symbolic,

00:34:02.765 --> 00:34:07.777
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

00:34:13.355 --> 00:34:18.788
And that symbol actually acts.

00:34:22.317 --> 00:34:25.064
For example if you give somebody a flower,

00:34:25.265 --> 00:34:30.071
that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

00:34:30.272 --> 00:34:34.725
and gratitude comes in.

00:34:43.106 --> 00:34:48.544
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

00:34:48.745 --> 00:34:57.037
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

00:35:09.442 --> 00:35:13.922
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

00:35:14.123 --> 00:35:17.135
and of their blessings on you.

00:35:17.336 --> 00:35:22.142
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

00:35:30.936 --> 00:35:34.973
That is how the Divine acts.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:47.033
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

00:35:51.914 --> 00:35:54.381
Now we are doing puja at this time,

00:35:54.582 --> 00:35:58.661
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

00:35:58.862 --> 00:36:06.205
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

00:36:20.859 --> 00:36:24.707
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

00:36:24.908 --> 00:36:27.602
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

00:36:27.803 --> 00:36:32.875
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

00:36:33.076 --> 00:36:36.085
Now they are getting the same blessings,

00:36:36.286 --> 00:36:38.032
though you are doing the puja

00:36:38.233 --> 00:36:43.012
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

00:37:00.885 --> 00:37:08.873
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

00:37:09.074 --> 00:37:12.457
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

00:37:12.658 --> 00:37:16.981
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

00:37:17.182 --> 00:37:22.126
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

00:37:40.975 --> 00:37:44.418
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

00:37:44.619 --> 00:37:50.211
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

00:37:59.174 --> 00:38:02.413
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

00:38:02.614 --> 00:38:08.127
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

00:38:19.603 --> 00:38:27.075
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

00:38:33.033 --> 00:38:37.364
So you should be very relaxed about it.

00:38:38.777 --> 00:38:43.418
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

00:38:45.451 --> 00:38:48.494
May God bless you all.

00:38:52.736 --> 00:38:56.827
[I think – he finds it difficult to sit
in the lap.

00:38:57.028 --> 00:38:59.953
He can sit at the back if he likes,
this gentleman.

00:39:00.154 --> 00:39:03.398
This little boy is too much for him to sit
like [that] –

00:39:03.599 --> 00:39:05.531
you can sit comfortably, be comfortable,

00:39:05.732 --> 00:39:09.120
there’s nothing to feel bad.]

00:39:10.489 --> 00:39:14.403
Now, they have to wash the Feet.

00:39:17.663 --> 00:39:20.059
The children have to wash the Feet

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:26.832
and we’ll be singing that time the praise
of Shri Ganesha.
