1
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:32,590
After the great tour of U.K. I feel very confident
that Sahaja Yoga is taking its roots, and

2
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,420
you can see some of the plants coming up.

3
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,760
It's surprising, when I declared that it may
be the last tour I'll be doing of U.K. that

4
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,430
things have started working out.

5
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:52,469
Everywhere we went it was very good and successful,
specially certain places it was very miraculous.

6
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:59,970
You must have heard about the lady who would
not go out of her house, was suffering from

7
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,250
agoraphobia, and the press challenged us that
she should be cured because she can't go out

8
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,570
of the house.

9
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,509
And only on her photograph and treatment she
got cured, and now she's walking about, and

10
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:18,100
they have given a big report saying that the
Guru fulfills Her promise.

11
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,920
This is one of them and there are many things
have happened of this kind, of which you should

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,260
get the report.

13
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:36,870
I must say I found all the Sahaja Yogis very
cooperative, very alert, very helpful and

14
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,090
extremely progressive.

15
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:46,600
And I was happy that they are trying to come
up and improve themselves, build themselves

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,570
up, and are doing much better than what I
had expected, really.

17
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:57,350
I was very, very enamored by all of them,
and I hope that by the time it is twelve years,

18
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:03,159
we'll be all absolutely top class Sahaja Yogis
of the world.

19
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:13,170
Now today is a very great day of Raksha Bandhan,
so I have to tell you something about Raksha

20
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,380
Bandhan.

21
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:41,470
Before that we have to talk about the maryadas
that are to be observed by Sahaja Yogis.

22
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:49,450
One of the things I discovered here in the
West, that though we have understood the importance

23
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,150
of Mooladhara, which is very important and
that unless and until we re-establish our

24
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:03,580
Mooladhara fully we are not going to have
a speediest ascent.

25
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,670
Despite all that, still there are lingering
things you see around.

26
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:20,700
Like people start choosing their life partners
in Sahaja Yoga.

27
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,930
That is not allowed, that is not allowed.

28
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:37,069
You are not to spoil your ashrams, your centers,
using them for a marriage-searching society.

29
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,629
You must respect, this point you must respect.

30
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:48,050
If you have to marry, then you can find your
life partner outside Sahaja Yoga - to begin

31
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,050
with.

32
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:57,510
But if you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga, then
you should not go on searching people in Sahaja

33
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,510
Yoga.

34
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:04,190
Is a very dangerous thing for Sahaja Yoga
itself and for you people.

35
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,610
That is one thing one should never try to
do with Sahaja Yogis.

36
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,519
For all practical purposes you are brothers
and sisters.

37
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,829
And that's why I always encourage marriages
between people who belong to another country

38
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,910
or another centers.

39
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:33,240
As we are now having a marriage - big program
- I would say that most of the marriages which

40
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,639
were done like that are very successful than
the marriages that were selected and were

41
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:40,639
done.

42
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,710
It's very wrong to do such a thing as to arrange
your marriage with a Sahaja Yogi by yourself.

43
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,520
It will be dangerous.

44
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,090
I don't want to say anything; but it won't
turn out to be good, because it is anti-God

45
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,090
activity, absolutely anti-God.

46
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:02,240
You are supposed to develop your brahmacharya,
you are supposed to develop your Mooladhara.

47
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,029
Instead of that, if you start using a Sahaja
Yogini or a Sahaja Yogi for the selection

48
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:11,199
of your married life, it's going to be very,
very troublesome.

49
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,189
Your Mooladhara will not settle down.

50
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:18,219
I mean that's a very bad stroke for your development.

51
00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:24,060
Because of the background and the kind of
conditioning you have had, you people don't

52
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,569
understand that it is important to maintain
the purity of the centers, and of every place.

53
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:36,279
So any such relationship in one city is a
very wrong thing.

54
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,279
It spoils everyone.

55
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:44,289
To add up to the trouble, it's a habit of
people, I have heard, that they try to tease

56
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,569
that "You look better together, you are nice
together."

57
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:49,490
They tease and enjoy.

58
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:57,219
It's a kind of a very perverted enjoyment
of Mooladhara, to tease others "You are looking

59
00:05:57,219 --> 00:05:59,449
very nice with him, and you better marry."

60
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:01,889
It's a kind of a romantic nonsense.

61
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:06,939
Of course, for all this, yogis - they have
to have a brahmacharya.

62
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:10,250
But even if you can't have brahmacharya you
must have maryadas.

63
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:17,110
Not to tease each other and enjoy that kind
of a nonsense, when the marriage is not settled.

64
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,879
If marriage is settled, it is all right.

65
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,569
And this kills completely the joy of marriage,
because there is no curiosity left.

66
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:28,500
And many a times I find that absurd relations
are established.

67
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,410
Some of them are really no good.

68
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,169
And they will really be detrimental, and some
of them never are established.

69
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:41,099
So if they are established, they are wrong;
and if they are not established, they are

70
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,099
heartbreaking.

71
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:44,969
So all this kind of thing you should not do.

72
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:51,219
You have got experiences of people who married
outside and brought wonderful people to Sahaja

73
00:06:51,219 --> 00:06:52,219
Yoga.

74
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:53,780
If you can do it, you should do it.

75
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:59,529
But if you have to marry Sahaja Yogis, you
should not marry them at the cost of destroying

76
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:02,210
the purity and the idealism it has.

77
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:08,569
For your own sake, for your own pleasures,
you should not spoil the name of Sahaja Yoga.

78
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:13,710
That is one thing I have seen, so I would
say that today, as it is the day of purity

79
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,919
between relationships, let us know that you
have to treat each other as brothers and sisters.

80
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,599
No such play should be followed.

81
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:26,729
Don't allow your mind to drift into this.

82
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:29,580
Because if you allow, then there's no end
to it.

83
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,759
As it is, you know how hard it is to bring
you back to normal.

84
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:42,449
When Christ had said, "Thou shalt not have
adulterous eyes," He didn't say it because

85
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:43,669
it was not practical.

86
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,939
It is quite practical for Sahaja Yogis.

87
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:49,149
And there is nothing to worry about marriages
so much.

88
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:50,280
What is so important?

89
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,559
So many are married and what has happened
to them.

90
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:58,180
Even with Sahaja Yoga marriage, some of them
have failed because of these bad habits.

91
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,729
So you better get rid of these bad habits
before marriage, because after marriage also

92
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,779
they go on like this, and searching for boys
and girls.

93
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:12,199
Because if these habits are not curbed before
marriage, then they go on lingering on.

94
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,919
So one should not try to do all these things
before marriage.

95
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,229
And I have seen such marriages are never,
never successful so far.

96
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,319
And even if they are, it is a sort of make-believe
thing.

97
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:26,479
It doesn't give real joy, it's a joyless pursuit.

98
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,520
Maybe in one case, may be successful; that
doesn't mean that you should take any help

99
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,349
from such difficult things, but have normal
marriages which are enjoyable, which have

100
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:42,080
created permanent bondages between people.

101
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:50,300
All the marriages ...

102
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:58,490
Now we have to understand the maryadas, about
which I have told you before also.

103
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,670
The relationships between men and women are
only pure if a certain amount of boundaries

104
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,320
are kept.

105
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:16,810
Like, supposing you have milk in one container
and you have got something else in another

106
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:17,930
container.

107
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:23,649
To keep the purity of one container, you have
to keep it in its bounds, in the cup.

108
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:29,690
If you allow them to mix up, if they fall
together and they mix up, then there is no

109
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,690
purity.

110
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,400
It's a simple thing like that.

111
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,399
One should understand that we have to understand
that how to keep our relationships in proper

112
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,269
respect to each other's modesty and chastity.

113
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:52,980
Now for example, there is a girl who is younger
to you.

114
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,069
You must keep all the distance from such a
person.

115
00:09:57,069 --> 00:10:00,699
If she is much older than you, then it is
all right.

116
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:07,279
You can talk, laugh, joke - she's much older
than you.

117
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,410
But normally with a girl who is younger to
you, even much younger, you should try to

118
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:17,440
keep away, after all if she is a young girl;
not with the children, but still.

119
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,380
You must learn these things: how to maintain
a distance.

120
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:31,329
Now, there is a man who is younger to you,
then you must not have any funny ideas about

121
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,860
such a person - is absolutely absurd.

122
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,490
If some gentleman is younger to you, it is
only in perversion you do such things.

123
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,470
See, you should not have any funny ideas about
that person.

124
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:49,579
It's only done when there are emergencies,
when there is no possibility of a marriage,

125
00:10:49,579 --> 00:10:55,939
when there are so many women or so many men
- or under perverted conditions.

126
00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:00,069
We don't have none of these conditions here,
so we have to behave like normal people.

127
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:05,310
And when the proper atmosphere is given to
us, why not make use of it?

128
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,880
Why should we create absurd things?

129
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,310
Then they come out to Me saying that "Mother,
now we have decided to marry.

130
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,350
Let us marry."

131
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,350
I have to say "Yes."

132
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,790
To many things I don't want to say "Yes" but
I have to say "Yes."

133
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,930
But creates a very bad precedent.

134
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,910
Maybe that in certain cases, as an exceptional
case, I might have chosen to marry somebody

135
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,100
like that.

136
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,240
But that doesn't mean you should take things
into your hands, and just start doing things

137
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,040
like that, so that I'll have problems later.

138
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,860
Because once you do like that, then anybody
starts doing it.

139
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,550
It's a kind of an aggressiveness, that you
arrange something, come to Me, say.

140
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,550
"Mother, we want to marry."

141
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,570
Now what am I to say?

142
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,189
"All right, marry."

143
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:46,889
But it creates a problem for Me, for the rest
of the people.

144
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,069
They will say, "All right.

145
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:53,160
If he has married a girl who is twenty years
younger, why not I marry a girl who is thirty

146
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,160
years younger?"

147
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
You must understand My problems.

148
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,850
If you ask Me for something, "Mother, should
I do it?"

149
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,680
You really force Me into it.

150
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,519
I have to say "Yes" because I cannot be very
strict with you, because I am your Mother.

151
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,439
But you should be sensible what to ask Me,
how far to go.

152
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,769
This is the biggest maryada you have to learn.

153
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:12,690
Suddenly you will come, "Mother, should I
sit here?"

154
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,740
What do I say?

155
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,610
Should I make this gentleman sit here?

156
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,610
What should I say?

157
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,610
All right.

158
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,209
You yourself should not ask such a question.

159
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:26,139
Because sometimes you give undue importance
to somebody, who is "my brother," who is "my

160
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:29,790
sister" -something - and make that person
sit on My head.

161
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,050
Sometimes you telephone to Me, "Mother, she
would like to talk to You."

162
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,270
Who is she?

163
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,270
Is she all right?

164
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,300
Should we take her to Mother?

165
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,920
Is she capable of talking to Mother?

166
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,510
What is her condition?

167
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,649
Will she trouble Mother?

168
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:45,279
Nobody thinks about it.

169
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:51,019
So you must first establish your relationship
with Me of proper understanding that you should

170
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:52,950
not try to trouble Me.

171
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:57,529
But this is something is not yet in My hands.

172
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:01,180
I think because people do not understand what
they are doing.

173
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,129
So first try to see that you don't try to
take advantage of Me.

174
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:10,889
And secondly, don't try to bring people to
Me who do not deserve it.

175
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,170
There is no need to waste My time with them.

176
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:20,209
I have so much things to be done, so many
ideas to be formulated.

177
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:21,260
I have to work so hard.

178
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,439
You know, I am working harder than any one
of you, those who are doing Sahaja Yoga.

179
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:31,060
And at this age, if you try to trouble Me
like that, I don't know how to tell you that

180
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,060
don't you trouble Me.

181
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,069
In the presence of the person you will come,
you will bring the person on My head, "Oh,

182
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:38,389
that person has come from Timbuktu, and I
have brought her."

183
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:39,910
Just you do it.

184
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,990
It is aggressiveness only.

185
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,610
Please don't try to do that.

186
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,370
This is a wrong thing to do.

187
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:49,759
So the maryadas are to be established first
with Me, that understand that you should not

188
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,160
try to trouble Me at all like this.

189
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,189
Secondly, you must try to please Me by being
good people.

190
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:02,259
I hear that somebody is trying to be very
egoistical.

191
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:06,519
He doesn't even put on My tapes, he just gives
his own lectures.

192
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:08,500
This kind of a thing is very surprising.

193
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,329
How can people do like that?

194
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,600
Try to bring down your egos, super egos.

195
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,920
You must learn to please Me, Prasanna bhava
He Devi, Prasanna bhava.

196
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,620
(Note: Sanskrit meaning "the Goddess is to
be pleased by Her devotees") If you cannot

197
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,420
make the Devi Prasanna ( pleased), what will
be your achievement?

198
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,970
As Rustom says, I am Mahamaya.

199
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,560
All right, but don't you know that I am that?

200
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,100
So try to keep to it.

201
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:35,860
And keep that understanding that if you have
to grow, we must have proper relationship

202
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:36,860
with Mother.

203
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,529
And we must understand what will displease
Her the most.

204
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:42,329
"Am I pleasing Her by doing this?"

205
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,999
But if you force Me, "If it pleases You, we'll
do."

206
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,370
Then what am I to say?

207
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,230
"All right, go ahead."

208
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,220
If it pleases Me I'll just spontaneously say,
"ll right, it pleases Me.

209
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,220
Go ahead do it."

210
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,199
Like that, so many things are there that people
just try to force on Me and I say "Yes."

211
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,889
But I am very cunning and clever in that,
because I tell in a way that you should realize

212
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:04,420
that it is not joy giving.

213
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,170
All right, whatever it is.

214
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:12,720
Now the second thing is that the maryadas
of relationships between you is relationship

215
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,059
of pure love, of purity.

216
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,759
Unless and until you develop pure relationships,
you are going to be ruined.

217
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,270
See, this finger has to have pure relationship
with this hand.

218
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,930
Supposing if this finger has some dirty feelings
about this hand, it may dirty it, it may spoil

219
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,930
it.

220
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:36,529
In the same way, we should have extremely
pure relationships with each other.

221
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:42,709
Means, we should try to give our heart to
another person without any lust or greed in

222
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,180
it, that we should try to do.

223
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,779
Try to help each other.

224
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:51,550
I find when they feel in a lusty way, or a
greedy way attached to others - this is not

225
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,529
for the Sahaja Yogis, but non Sahaja Yogis
- they get so much interested in that person.

226
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:57,009
It's a very baser way of attachment.

227
00:15:57,009 --> 00:16:02,529
But in Sahaja Yoga, your attachment is with
your Spirit, with your Atma.

228
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,040
And Atma is the purest form of our being.

229
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,579
We have to keep it absolutely pure.

230
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:13,680
And then the enjoyment is higher than any
romance, any marriage, any worldly thing.

231
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,129
It's the highest and the top-most.

232
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,860
First achieve that.

233
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,570
First of all you should arise and achieve
that.

234
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,180
Achieve that purity.

235
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,470
That is very important.

236
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:31,170
Now the relationship between the men and women:
have told you that you should not try to enter

237
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,300
into any bedrooms where the ladies are.

238
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,300
It's not proper.

239
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,689
Nor the women should enter into men's thing.

240
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:39,100
But it is very common.

241
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,930
Women should not behave in the way other women
behave.

242
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:48,690
Like, I was told in a wedding in Maharashtra
that the women went and took out all their

243
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:49,690
clothes.

244
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,119
I mean, that is not England; they got a shock,
you know.

245
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,899
Some of them lost their appetite for three,
four days.

246
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:56,769
They have never seen such women in their lifetime.

247
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,290
They went and took out their clothes suddenly,
all of them.

248
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,800
I mean, they were shocked, so much shocked
that three, four days they didn't eat their

249
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,040
food.

250
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,309
So you have no business to shock them also.

251
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:11,089
Because if you go to somebody's country, you
must know in what way they live.

252
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,790
It's never done; nobody becomes nude like
that.

253
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:20,809
And about twenty girls, if suddenly they become
nude, what will happen?

254
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:24,819
So the sense of shame must be developed among
men and women.

255
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,549
It looks nice, it looks beautiful.

256
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:32,210
It gives you an additional charm if you have
the sense of shame, a little bashfulness.

257
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,370
See, your Princess of Wales is regarded as
something beautiful.

258
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,460
She is bashful.

259
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,730
Her bashfulness is so natural.

260
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:46,771
That bashfulness is not there, like a - I
don't know what animal does that, but somebody

261
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:48,260
who has no shame.

262
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,409
I mean, I just don't know which one is that.

263
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:53,010
Everybody has a sense of shame, even animals.

264
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,720
So why shouldn't we have that sense of shame?

265
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,870
How to behave towards women, how to be ... Suddenly
there is no need to just ... I have seen one

266
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:12,760
lady going from England to India, and she
just went and put a big slap on the back of

267
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,960
Mr. Modi, "Hello Modi, how are you?"

268
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,450
And Modi got such a shock.

269
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:24,250
She did not mean, she was innocent, but that's
not the way in Sahaja Yoga we are going to

270
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,250
behave.

271
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:33,140
Like some sort of a debonair or some sort
of a fantastic - what you call - a modern

272
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,520
woman, you see.

273
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,880
One must understand one must have a sense
of shame.

274
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,230
How do you talk, even with Me they will talk
with a hand like that "Mother, You see this

275
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,230
thing is happening."

276
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,620
But there's no need to do all that, you see.

277
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,580
Talk in a way that is gentle and beautiful.

278
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,909
The other day I met a very nice taxi fellow.

279
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:55,360
And I tell you, his gestures and things were
so beautiful.

280
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Immediately I said, "He is a realized soul."

281
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,730
He would not say anything without putting
his hand like this, and with his eyes down

282
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,730
below.

283
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,970
He would not say something like that, nothing
of the kind.

284
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,230
So sweet he was, his whole gesture.

285
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,549
He is an Englishman.

286
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:10,200
Brought up and bred here.

287
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,990
Not a single vulgar word he said.

288
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,080
Like one of your players was so stupid.

289
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,460
When Princess Anne went to meet him he said
all kinds of things, you see.

290
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,779
It's kind of an ego, or stupidity - I don't
know.

291
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:25,429
Because, how you talk, how you speak, everything
should be saintly.

292
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,820
You are saints now, do you realize?

293
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,760
You are all saints.

294
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,831
So how you behave with dignity towards each
other, how you respect their dignity, how

295
00:19:35,831 --> 00:19:38,119
you live, is very important.

296
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:43,170
And that you should try to maintain in a way
that looks like a saintly behavior.

297
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,620
You have to be a saint.

298
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:49,840
And that is not difficult for you, to take
to that, that you behave in a manner that

299
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,500
you are saints.

300
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,130
This is very important I must tell you because
I have seen that these maryadas.

301
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:09,900
It would be killing, it would be absolutely
killing Sahaja Yoga, if you do not keep your

302
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,950
maryadas.

303
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,210
That is one of the most essential things one
has to know.

304
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:22,919
I have told you again and again how you dress
up, how you bear yourself up, how you talk,

305
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:29,019
how you listen to others more than you talk
yourself, how you become non-aggressive, is

306
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,730
the best way to impress people and to express
Sahaja Yoga.

307
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,309
I tell you, as it is, people have started
saying, "They are very beautiful people, you

308
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,050
can see they are very beautiful.

309
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,380
You can see they are very different type.

310
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,380
It's something different.

311
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,380
They are something great."

312
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,930
People have started saying that.

313
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,030
But still we lack in certain things.

314
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:57,840
Like we start going on a plane which is not
suitable to our stature, to our dignity, to

315
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,380
our position as saints.

316
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,290
We are all prophets, and prophets have to
behave like prophets.

317
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,409
They can not behave like cheap-type people.

318
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:08,260
So, in that we have to understand the maryadas.

319
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,090
Now the maryada to your leaders also, you
should be respectful.

320
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:18,809
I have seen that nobody calls any body - even
the children will call somebody, say, elderly

321
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:23,210
person also - never they, say, call them uncle
or anything like that.

322
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,679
It's a wrong thing.

323
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:31,039
You must teach your children to call elders
by the name as brother or uncle or someone.

324
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,850
Give some respect to the elders.

325
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:36,990
But when the leader is also not respected,
what is the question of it?

326
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:45,019
I have seen little boys calling big, married
people with three, four children, by name.

327
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:46,120
That's not our style.

328
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
You should never do it.

329
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,490
I saw this - even My husband's office has
this problem.

330
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,360
Because when I came, you see, they always
called you by name.

331
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,000
"Tom"- he's such a big man, he's called as
"Tom", and all that.

332
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,779
So C.P. looked at it...

333
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:04,179
And we always call them - even the drivers,
we call them by the name "Mister," you see.

334
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:06,440
So we could not understand why is it like
this.

335
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,100
You see, it being democratic or something
like this.

336
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,570
You see that's how you become demonocratic.

337
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,140
We must respect.

338
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,309
We must respect each other, must call them
by higher names.

339
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:23,730
Specially when in a meeting, there are people,
you should call them - each other, even your

340
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:26,230
friends - by "Mister so and so."

341
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,470
It's all right for Me to call you.

342
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:33,870
It would look very funny if I call "Mr. Brown"
or "Mr. Reeves" because they are My children,

343
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,510
you see, I am their Mother.

344
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:41,440
But for you, because you are equal, at least
call them "Mister" and say something in a

345
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,779
way which is beautiful.

346
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,900
Like the English language has many words as
"please, thank you."

347
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,140
All these must be used profusely, profusely.

348
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,820
We are going back a little bit.

349
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,880
We are now becoming much more modern.

350
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:05,970
That we should give up and become less modern
and more elevating.

351
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:17,350
Now the whole idea of this maryada is such
that when you have called somebody as a sister

352
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,760
or a brother then it is not only lip service:
You are my sister.

353
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,880
It is something innate, and very deep.

354
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,080
You have to develop that feeling of a sister.

355
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,890
Because that's how your sublimity will go
up, your left Visshuddhi will improve, your

356
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,200
Vishnumaya will be satisfied.

357
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,380
If you call somebody a sister, the sisterly
and daughterly relationships, and motherly

358
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:48,880
relationships, always bring down, you see,
the so-called ego, which is hiding in the

359
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,159
left Visshuddhi.

360
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,679
So try to be kind and gentle with the person
whom you call the sister.

361
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,179
Stand by her, look after her.

362
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:03,080
If somebody you call your brother, you have
to pray for his protection, then you must

363
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,590
know that you have a right to ask him for
his protection also.

364
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:13,170
But you must also give something to him, and
you must try to look after him, welcome him

365
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:21,029
to your house, and treat him as a part and
parcel of your being, because he is very much

366
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:24,910
near to you because he is your brother, and
he's very much closer to you.

367
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,679
But such a brother should not try to dominate
the wife.

368
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,919
This is the maryada, again.

369
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,700
Like a brother or somebody is very friendly
with the brother, or a lady is friendly as

370
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,230
a sister, then she should not try to put a
wedge between the husband and wife.

371
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,480
That is the worst thing to do, is to put a
wedge between husband and wife.

372
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,540
Anybody who tries that must know that he is
a mean person.

373
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,740
One should never try to put a wedge between
husband and wife.

374
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,149
I know there are problems between husband
and wife, I will put them right.

375
00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:55,389
But you don't try to put any wedge between
them.

376
00:24:55,389 --> 00:24:57,260
And don't try to create a problem.

377
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,700
If it is problematic, it is for Me to solve,
not you people don't have to solve.

378
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,720
And don't interfere with their married life.

379
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,980
Let them be as they are.

380
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:09,390
I will find out how they are; I will try to
help them.

381
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,220
But it's very wrong to play with their married
life or with their marriage problems, and

382
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,289
suddenly jump on somebody, is a very wrong
thing, which is very common here.

383
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,950
A woman is in distress, you see, a man will
come to help her.

384
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,820
Even if she is married, he will elope with
her.

385
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:30,750
This is how he comes to help her in the distress,
to create another distress for her.

386
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:37,309
So this is how one should understand that
this kind of a cheap heart-giving business,

387
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:40,730
and taking business, is not for Sahaja Yoga.

388
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,630
In our heart resides the Spirit.

389
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:50,230
We are dignified people, and in that dignity
we have to rise and live with that dignity.

390
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:57,059
Not to cheaply allow the Spirit to be insulted
or dominated or subjugated to anyone.

391
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:04,950
Now the relationship with children also one
should understand.

392
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:13,360
I have seen some people have a habit of getting
a child very much closer, and pampering them,

393
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,529
"Oh, this child is this thing.

394
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:16,529
Oh, that child..."

395
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:21,350
Let the parents handle the child, you just
don't interfere with other's children.

396
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,420
Don't interfere much with them.

397
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,900
If you find any child is such and such, inform
Me, I will cure the child.

398
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,040
But if a child is being spoilt by you, it's
the worst thing to do is to harm that child,

399
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,590
is to spoil.

400
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,460
Children here are very clever and intelligent,
you must know.

401
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,520
They are very good at manipulating.

402
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,320
They will, because they are extremely precocious.

403
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,770
They are realized souls; they are born in
this country.

404
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,460
What a combination!

405
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:52,400
At that time you must be very careful as to
their training.

406
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,559
From the first five years all the parents
must be extremely strict with children, extremely

407
00:26:58,559 --> 00:26:59,559
strict.

408
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:04,510
Don't allow them to overpower you or manipulate
you.

409
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,179
It's very important.

410
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:11,960
If you allow them to overpower you or to dominate
you, they'll sit on your head.

411
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,549
Tell them not to do like that.

412
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:18,019
And one day you will come and say, "Mother,
what to do, these are realized souls and,

413
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:19,549
you see, we were looking after them."

414
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:20,549
They are not deities.

415
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:24,080
They are not deities to be worshipped.

416
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,809
They are only realized souls.

417
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:27,520
So keep them at that point.

418
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,990
And you are My trustees of those children.

419
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,460
And if you spoil them, it is you who will
he held responsible.

420
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,471
You have no business to spoil the lives of
these children as Sahaja Yogis, and their

421
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:40,120
chances of ascent.

422
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,360
So if they are born-realized, they are not
deities; this you must understand.

423
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,840
They are not beyond corruption, they are not
beyond all kinds of things.

424
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:54,380
So this, if you understand this little point,
that dealing with your children you have to

425
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
be really strict.

426
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,660
They must know how to meditate, they must
know how to pray, they must know how to respect;

427
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,450
and all the good things you must teach your
children.

428
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,380
And don't allow them to sit on your head.

429
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,659
Many people have ruined the lives of their
children like this.

430
00:28:08,659 --> 00:28:13,309
Now will you please see that such child is
brought into proper level?

431
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:18,650
If the child is trying to take liberties with
you, and cheeky and does not listen, please

432
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:24,090
give that child to some other Sahaja Yogi
to look after, whom you think can look after,

433
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,860
and see that the child is put right.

434
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,250
Nip in the bud is the best way, because we
don't want to have children who are spoilt,

435
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:38,779
who are spoiling other children, nor we want
children who are subjected to such children.

436
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:44,610
So, you can have proper children, well-behaved
children, sensible, wise children.

437
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:51,110
Because they can really be a drag on you,
on Me, on everyone, if you do not properly

438
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,110
bring them up.

439
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,259
And they are our liabilities; we have to look
after them.

440
00:28:56,259 --> 00:29:02,360
So the relationship between the father and
children, mother and children, is important.

441
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,909
Actually the mother should look after the
child much more.

442
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,630
And the child must respect.

443
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,179
Father should never scold the mother in the
presence of the child.

444
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,210
That's one thing one must understand, that
if the father starts scolding the mother in

445
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,190
the presence of the child, the child will
have no respect for the mother.

446
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,019
But the respect must be maintained, because
if the wife respects the husband, then the

447
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:24,710
child will know how to respect her and the
husband too.

448
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,750
So the whole thing is built up like that.

449
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,250
Is a kind of a pattern for children to follow.

450
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:36,429
One should not try to dominate the husband,
at least in the presence of children.

451
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,799
That's very wrong.

452
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,620
Because then the children learn that trick
and they start dominating you.

453
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,460
So it flows from you to children.

454
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,230
So try to see that if you have to do anything
then you do it yourself.

455
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,220
And respect the husband and in a way that
is very obvious to the child that the father

456
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,769
is respected by mother.

457
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:59,150
And they are just like monkeys.

458
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,289
The way you behave, they behave.

459
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:05,640
So you allow them to behave in a particular
manner, they will behave that way.

460
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,679
But if you put a good pattern of behavior,
they will imbibe it.

461
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,790
The other day I was thinking, how Indian children
are so obedient, so sensible.

462
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,830
They will never ask for it.

463
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:12,870
"I want this, I want that."

464
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,870
They never manipulate.

465
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,870
What happens?

466
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,870
What happens, how do they do it?

467
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:25,970
The reason is, I think, the good pattern in
the house.

468
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:29,470
Everybody knows whom to respect, how to respect,
how to behave.

469
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:35,480
The relationship in Sahaja Yoga has to be
even more than this, much more subtler.

470
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:41,850
For example, if - this I have said before
also - if we are in a room, try to give another

471
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,950
person always, try to do for them.

472
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:51,260
If you have to pay, better pay yourself, not
that wait for another person.

473
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,620
Try to do it yourself.

474
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,770
Run forward to do it.

475
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,780
You see, if someone is carrying the luggage,
you run, you do it.

476
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,929
That is the way a Sahaja Yogi should be.

477
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:01,019
Mostly, children are like that.

478
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,649
They will say, "I'll get it, I'll do it, I'll
receive it."

479
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:08,909
May be ego, you might call it, but whatever
it is, but that is the sign you all have to

480
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:17,200
achieve by organizing a proper type of an
image for the whole society.

481
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,930
That if somebody needs something, you run.

482
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,930
"You want water?

483
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:20,930
All right...

484
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,930
You want this thing?

485
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,930
You take mine."

486
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,930
Food also - same thing.

487
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,750
First let others have, not that you should
first have anything.

488
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:33,549
How you eat your food is very important, everything
is very important for the children to see,

489
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,710
and to behave like that.

490
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:42,070
In money matters also, I have seen that people
should be very, very sensible and should have

491
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,389
proper maryadas.

492
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:48,669
Now with Me, whatever maryadas you want to
keep, you must understand.

493
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:51,289
It is very embarrassing to talk about it.

494
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:57,820
But so far, as you know, I had to shell out
lot of money to manage many funds, many things.

495
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:06,740
And last time also we had many people who
came to eat, doesn't matter.

496
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:17,960
At the time now, when we are talking about
maryadas, we must know that, in any case,

497
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,379
Mother should not be made to pay any more.

498
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:28,620
Because we are so many, we should try to manage,
if possible.

499
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,610
Like yesterday, I had a person from BBC, and
he said, "It is wrong of You not to take any

500
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,610
money from them."

501
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,080
I said, "Where is the money?

502
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,590
No question of taking, I have to pay Myself."

503
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:43,330
I said, "It is so invaluable that how can
you charge for it?

504
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:46,070
You cannot charge for it, it is very invaluable.

505
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,190
The Spirit is very invaluable, and you cannot
charge for it."

506
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,289
So he was insisting.

507
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:53,470
I mean, he took half an hour on this subject
only.

508
00:32:53,470 --> 00:33:00,600
He said, "This Anglo-Saxon brain won't understand
unless and until You make it a little more

509
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,710
money-oriented or something."

510
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,210
I said, "I cannot.

511
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,899
Tell me how much is to be paid."

512
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:08,120
Just to shut him down, I said, "What about
Christ?

513
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,580
How much money did He take?

514
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,799
By God's grace I am quite well off and I really
don't need either.

515
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,899
But He needed, still He never took any money
from anyone."

516
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:19,779
Then he kept quiet.

517
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:27,520
But this is what it is, you see, that people
think that you are getting it easy, cheap

518
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,570
and that's why you want to take advantage,
which is wrong.

519
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:34,380
You must respect.

520
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:42,450
You must respect and understand that it is
never good to take any advantage of it.

521
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:48,559
On the contrary, whenever it is possible you
should try to do whatever is possible for

522
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,559
Sahaja Yoga.

523
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,059
It's very important.

524
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:52,940
Try to surrender.

525
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,129
Not that I will take any money from you, you
know that.

526
00:33:55,129 --> 00:33:56,990
I don't want any money or anything.

527
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,990
But surrender yourself absolutely to Sahaja
Yoga.

528
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,740
That is the best way people have risen and
have done so well.

529
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:15,230
Now the relationship among yourselves, among
different groups, among different nations:

530
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,950
we should try to help people.

531
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:23,360
Supposing there is a couple now, wants to
go to India to get married.

532
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,580
Now if they don't have money, of course I
am there.

533
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,950
I said, "All right, they need not pay any
money, I'll pay for them."

534
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:38,710
But Warren has put down his foot, he says,
"Why not the people, or the center, help them

535
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,290
out, for the time being?"

536
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:45,400
You see because now, supposing they have helped
somebody - he had no money, he went to India,

537
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,900
he got married and then he got lost, you see,
he misbehaved, in the sense that he doesn't

538
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:55,210
talk to anyone, he thinks no end of himself,
then he started behaving in a funny manner.

539
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,320
So a kind of a feeling came into their mind
that "Why should we do it?

540
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,160
If you do it for somebody, then he behaves
like that.

541
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,180
If you try to help somebody..."

542
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,940
Is this a natural reaction that if you try
to do something for someone then people try

543
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
to misbehave?

544
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,820
That's not so.

545
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,910
Must be one person has done it, that doesn't
mean that everybody has done it.

546
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,910
That's what it is.

547
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:22,780
They say that a kind of a barrier is built
in a person who is helped by us, and his ego

548
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,700
is challenged, and he tries to behave in a
manner which was never known before.

549
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,630
And he starts behaving in such a funny manner
that he doesn't talk to anyone, he keeps out

550
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,350
and he becomes mad with his ego.

551
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,630
So his ego is hurt.

552
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,230
There's nothing to feel hurt.

553
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,910
Because if you have no money and if it is
one part and one body, if somebody's helping

554
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,970
you out, doesn't matter.

555
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,480
You can help, when you are well off, to somebody
else.

556
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,400
But when it comes to you, you give up.

557
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,270
So this is a very absurd type of a behavior
of one individual, or two or three, or maybe

558
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,270
five or ten.

559
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,270
Doesn't matter.

560
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,300
But still we must not forget that we have
to help.

561
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,650
We have to help as many as possible.

562
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:03,260
And we must try to do whatever is possible
for us, for others.

563
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
This is important.

564
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,880
If we cannot do for a group, like Sahaja Yogis,
whom are we going to help?

565
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,540
So we have to give that help.

566
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,990
Now in Sahaja Yoga itself, on the subtle basis
we should not try to judge anybody's vibrations.

567
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:19,200
It is very common in people, "Oh, you are
caught up on your Agnya.

568
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,220
Oh, you have got this wrong, let me clear
you out.

569
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,290
You sit down."

570
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,530
Morning till evening, without meditating,
they are clearing each other's chakras and

571
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,770
catching on themselves.

572
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,840
It's an absolutely wrong idea.

573
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:33,680
Everybody, individually, should sit before
the photograph, get the vibrations, every

574
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,700
morning, there should be a discipline.

575
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,600
You must know that the system of Sahaja Yoga
today has worked out this way that I have

576
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,360
given you Realization just to say that "Let
your light be enlightened."

577
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:48,790
Now you have to see your lamp, if it is clean
or not - only possible when the light is enlightened.

578
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,070
See your lamp, if it is enlightened or not.

579
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:55,890
See, if somebody is over-aggressive, then
it's all right, you make a joint attack on

580
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,660
that person, and tell-off that person.

581
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,810
Or there are leaders who will do it.

582
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,930
But everybody should not judge others.

583
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,550
You better judge yourself, cleanse yourself,
look after yourself.

584
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,120
And also try to see how your lamp is.

585
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Is it clean?

586
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,100
Mother has given us the light to see; and
why not see?

587
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:16,240
So if you work it out on these lines, you'll
go very fast.

588
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,120
And you have to, now, perfect yourself.

589
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,250
We have so many Sahaja Yogis.

590
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:22,750
But how many are perfect?

591
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,880
This is the point.

592
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,830
Now your relationship to Sahaja Yoga is also
very important.

593
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,100
There's a maryada about it very much.

594
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,300
Sahaja Yoga should not be taken for granted.

595
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,180
Anybody who thinks he has got Realization
and now he is sitting on top of the world

596
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,630
- is not so.

597
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,751
You must work it out, you have to have discipline.

598
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:46,540
The same gentleman, the BBC fellow, was saying
that it was before, for years together, you

599
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:55,120
had to live in celibacy and wash the feet
and sweep steps of the temple and do all kinds

600
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:00,160
of things, work hard, do this, do that - and
then they would raise it to one chakra.

601
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,870
I said, "Now we do it the other way round."

602
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:08,850
First build the dome and then the foundation.

603
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,750
Sahaja Yoga is like that.

604
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:15,340
So that with the dome you understand, you
are protected, you are looked after.

605
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,110
But people take it for granted, like.

606
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,290
"Mother will do it.

607
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,370
Leave it to Mother."

608
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,490
No, it is not so.

609
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:23,060
You are My hands.

610
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,890
Supposing My hands have to lift this, I should
say that Nirmala will do it?

611
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,890
Now, which is Nirmala?

612
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,760
These hands are the Nirmala at this point.

613
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,430
So, many people drift like that.

614
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:38,150
So, to Sahaja Yoga also, your attitude should
be of respect.

615
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:43,590
You should not try to put yourself into bandhan
before others, you should not try to do these

616
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:47,030
things; but in a dignified way you must respect
Sahaja Yoga.

617
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:51,850
And foremost of all, to Sahaja Yoga your relationship
should be that you should know Sahaja Yoga,

618
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,850
what it is.

619
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:57,810
Otherwise every time if you have to talk about
Sahaja, Gavin must come, or somebody.

620
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,810
Why?

621
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:02,400
Gavin did not know a word about Sahaja Yoga,
he did not know a word about Indian mythology,

622
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,660
he did not know anything, he did not know
what Realization is.

623
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:08,320
He studied, he's even studying Sanskrit.

624
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,020
Like many of you have done it.

625
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,690
But all of you, one and all, should become
a big pandit.

626
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:16,990
But you get lost in your marriage problems.

627
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:18,730
Then your children's problems.

628
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,270
Then "my mother," then "my sister."

629
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,750
I mean, it will take too much time for you.

630
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,470
First of all you should see, "I am a Sahaja
Yogi.

631
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,760
Let me get to work."

632
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,580
And it creates problems for us also.

633
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,940
Because your wife will sue you, your children
will come round, this, that.

634
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,010
You should say, "I have nothing to do, I am
going to study Sahaja Yoga."

635
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:41,920
I was surprised that many people have taken
Advent just like as a bible, just as a bible.

636
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,920
They never read it.

637
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,910
I was surprised that some people do not know
what I have written in the Bible.

638
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,680
So it is like the Jews, you see, having a
Golden Bible tied up here.

639
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,240
They keep The Advent in a very good cover
near the photograph, worship it - finished.

640
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
Then the knowledge goes into them.

641
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
You must read some chapters at least of Advent,
if not anything else.

642
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
There are so many books you can read; I have
told you.

643
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
Try to make your own library.

644
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Try to improve in it.

645
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Everybody must try to get perfection - perfectionism.

646
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
You should never be a liability on Sahaja
Yoga, but a great asset of Sahaja Yoga.

647
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
That's what everybody should try to be.

648
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
That, your problems I will solve.

649
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
But you solve your ascent.

650
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
That is very important.

651
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
You must ascend.

652
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Otherwise, whatever problems I solve, you
get into another problem, then you get into

653
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
another problem.

654
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240
Now the relationship - say you have an ashram;
somebody has bought it.

655
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
Now, nobody should think that "This is my
house."

656
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,240
Now this is the best way to get out of this
idea of possession.

657
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Because then I trouble you.

658
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
That's the place where Mahamaya plays.

659
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
If you say, "This is my house," then you will
have it.

660
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
And you will have it forever.

661
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
So such things you should never develop, the
feeling that "this (is my house)."

662
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Now I have seen people, they go into an ashram,
and then they think this is their house.

663
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,240
They live there.

664
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
They manipulate all the money that they save
and this and that, and develop this, want

665
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
to make everything comfortable.

666
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
They never think, "This is not my ashram;
I am doing it because I am a Sahaja Yogi.

667
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,240
This is the Ashram of Mother.

668
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,240
I have to do it."

669
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,240
But that detachment is not there.

670
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Not at all a detachment.

671
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
And it is something surprising, that if you
have to go to Himalayas and make an insurance

672
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
policy, then what's the use of coming to Sahaja
Yoga?

673
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,240
It is as absurd as that.

674
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,240
We are writing two insurance policies, that
"I have gone to Himalayas.

675
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
When I die, give my property to this one.

676
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
If I don't die, I will come back after that."

677
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,240
And nicely packing up in a nice plastic bag
so that ice doesn't spoil it.

678
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
It's as absurd as that.

679
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
So you should not have anything.

680
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Now some people have a habit, "Oh, I'll get
a house for myself.

681
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Get my wife there, children there."

682
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Finished.

683
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
All such people should, for a change, leave
their houses, come to ashram, put some other

684
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
people in their house.

685
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Because they are getting attached, you see.

686
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
How will you get detached?

687
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Is there any way out?

688
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Because that is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

689
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
Unless and until you are detached, you cannot
ascend.

690
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Supposing you have all the tentacles down
here on the Mother Earth, and you say, "Let

691
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
this plane fly," how will it go?

692
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
So those people who have houses of their own,
or buildings of their own or anything - flats

693
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
- should give up their houses.

694
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
Not to be that comfortable.

695
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Get out of it.

696
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
Ask some other people to shift, and you shift
to the ashram.

697
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
Go on shifting, training your mind to shift,
to live with everyone, to be able to share

698
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
and to do things.

699
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
I have changed forty houses after My marriage,
you can imagine.

700
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,240
And the kind of a house I have to carry on
with is a very multi-purpose house.

701
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,240
And I have changed, so far, forty houses,
and if I change now this house, it will be

702
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
the forty-first.

703
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
You can imagine, I have been married forty
years and forty houses I have changed.

704
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,240
So the relationship of purity must be understood,
in everything.

705
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,240
Is it pure relationship?

706
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,240
Am I living in this ashram in pure relationship?

707
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
Because this is the house that is giving me
comfort, that's why I am living in this house;

708
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,240
or am I just living here, just because it's
an abode - I am here today, and I will be

709
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,240
there tomorrow?

710
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
You will be amazed, you will enjoy every part
of life.

711
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
As soon as you are attached, you are doomed.

712
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
It's a headache to be attached to someone.

713
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
Then you hanker.

714
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
"My wife has not arrived.

715
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Oh God, what to do now?

716
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,240
I must telephone to her, get her here."

717
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,240
But if you are detached about it she'll come
in time.

718
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Not only that, but you will enjoy her company.

719
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
Otherwise you'll shout at her, "Why didn't
you come in time?

720
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
I was waiting for you."

721
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Then why were you waiting to scold her, and
shout at her and spoil all the relationship?

722
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
Just see, the absurdity of the whole thing
is the attachment.

723
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,240
You should get completely detached about everything,
and you will enjoy, just enjoy.

724
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,240
But in that also, one has to judge.

725
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,240
You are really enjoying or you are just making
a drama out of it?

726
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,240
Try to be sincere.

727
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,240
Purity is brought forth by sincerity.

728
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,240
If you are not sincere to yourself and to
others, you can not be pure.

729
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
And purity is the main thing you have to achieve
in Sahaja Yoga, apart from the unity, which

730
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
I have given you.

731
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
But if you do not use this unity for purity
- no use.

732
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
So this light should give you complete wisdom
that you enjoy a pure, good life.

733
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
You are married.

734
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
All right, you have life of enjoyment with
your wife - that I have already described

735
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
to you.

736
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
And with your wife how to behave also, I have
described to you many a times, or with your

737
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
husband.

738
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
But when it comes to others, you should have
absolutely pure relationship of no exploitation.

739
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Even there are flirting exploitations - as
the same as money exploitations.

740
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
Here if you exploit somebody by money it's
called a "thug".

741
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
But flirting is not called anything.

742
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
I think that is a much worse crime, according
to Christ.

743
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
So you have to be careful on this point, and
understand that relationship with each other

744
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,240
has to be pure.

745
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
Now there are people who have, say, horrible
wives or horrible husbands.

746
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
I don't mind, they can give them up.

747
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,240
If they are absolutely impossible, if they
are spoiling their purity, if they are torturing

748
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
their lives, then the best is to get rid of
them.

749
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
I don't mind.

750
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Because if they are so bad that you cannot
use them - just like this body, if it is so

751
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
bad, it's better to give up and die.

752
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
So that let that relationship die out.

753
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
But that death should come to you as a very
forceful help; otherwise, after that, if you

754
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
become a nervous personality, what's the use?

755
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
So what you have to do after such a thing
has happened - that you have given up such

756
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
a relationship - then, if you have to go to
courts and all that, you should give up Sahaja

757
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Yoga for the time being.

758
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
Solve your problems.

759
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
Solve your court problems, everything, then
come to Sahaja Yoga.

760
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,240
We do not want to get involved into this kind
of a thing at all, that we have broken any

761
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,240
family or anything.

762
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
If you cannot carry on with a wife, not that
Sahaja Yoga should be an excuse.

763
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,240
Because you can not carry on with her, you
should have this thing - go out of Sahaja

764
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
Yoga, do what you like with your wife, finish
it off once for all.

765
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
And you should tell her, "I am no more a Sahaja
Yogi."

766
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Get it out, and then come to Sahaja Yoga.

767
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
But by coming to Sahaja Yoga you will be really
troubling Me too much.

768
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,240
So I have to make a humble request to you,
that if you have any a such problem, do not

769
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
allow any child who is younger than a proper
age - sixteen years - to be kept in the ashram

770
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,240
without taking a full permission, written
permission from the parents.

771
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,240
Or a wife who has made problems with the husband,
should not be allowed to come and stay in

772
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,240
the ashram with the children unless and until
it is resolved.

773
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,240
We are not responsible for all kinds of problems.

774
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Then people who are sick or mentally deranged
should not be kept in the ashram.

775
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,240
That is also quite a sympathetic attitude
of so many Sahaja Yogis.

776
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Ashram is for the best people, not for the
lunatics.

777
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,240
So please do not get such people who are no
good.

778
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,240
We do not want such people to come in the
ashram who are going to ruin the reputation

779
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
of the ashram.

780
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
So coming to the relationship of Vishnumaya,
is that Vishnumaya is the One Who is the sister,

781
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
sister of Shri Krishna.

782
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
She is the One Who announced the coming of
Shri Krishna.

783
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
She is the One Who sacrificed Her life to
save Shri Krishna's life.

784
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
Vishnumaya is the One Which surrounds Shri
Krishna; and She was born as Draupadi Who,

785
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
you know, was later on humiliated by Duryodhana,
and it was Shri Krishna Who came and helped

786
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Her.

787
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
So it's a very sweet relationship of purity,
of help.

788
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
A very delicate relationship is to be maintained
of a brother and a sister.

789
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
And that is a special relationship today.

790
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
Those who want to tie the Rakhis to a sister
should tie today before Me, it will be a good

791
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
idea.

792
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
It is a greater relationship than any other
relationship.

793
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Because here somebody is your own sister,
is all right.

794
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
But if she is not your own sister you should
know that you all are born of one Mother.

795
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
So the brother and sister relationship should
be all right.

796
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
In that also one should not have preferences
- because some would like to have a rich sister,

797
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
or some sort of a nonsense like that.

798
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
Or somebody would like to have the most miserable
one.

799
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,240
This is all the maya.

800
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
But a relationship with a person with whom
you would like to be happy, you should tie

801
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
the rakhi.

802
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
And if there is anybody left out, you should
not try to do that.

803
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
So anybody who is listening, I would say that
best thing would be to have your lucky dips.

804
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
I think for people, something like that could
be done so that they choose their sisters

805
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
and tie the things.

806
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
Which ever way you like you choose it.

807
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
But I have got some nice rakhis for you, that
should be done today.

808
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,240
And I will be very happy.

809
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
And then we'll do this little havana for the
Vishnumaya.

810
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
May God bless you.

811
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
TIE THE RAKHI AND HAVAN:

812
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
(Informal conversation with yogis about who
will live in which ashrams)

813
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
This house has too much right-side.

814
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,240
[Inaudible] It's a very right-sided house,
it's very right-sided.

815
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
I don't know; you have to, little bit, fill
with some left-sided [inaudible].

816
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
absolutely right-sided.

817
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
There is one more thing I have to tell, which
he had asked Me to talk to you.

818
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
I don't know if you are interested, but they
are showing some sort of a program at seven

819
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
o'clock on Saturday.

820
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
They are showing some program of revelation,
how people see lights, things like that.

821
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Sahaja Yogis must know why these things happen.

822
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
Like, one gentleman suddenly felt a flash.

823
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,240
He went to a lady and she was a widow lady,
her husband had died in climbing, and he himself

824
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,240
used to climb a lot with him.

825
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,240
And the husband died, so he went to get the
lady, the widow.

826
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,240
And she was telling all the stories, and he
felt very sad about it, and suddenly - he

827
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,240
didn't like the way she was telling the stories,
I think - and suddenly he felt a flash on

828
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,240
his head, of light.

829
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
And then he felt tremendous compassion for
her.

830
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,240
What must have happened, can you tell?

831
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
No, I'll tell you what must have happened:
the Kundalini must have risen.

832
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,240
He used to climb and do all these right-sided
business, so it must have spread - one possibility

833
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
- on the right side.

834
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
It could have been that, without Kundalini
awakening also, the sympathetic might have

835
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,240
broken its way to the right because he's too
much right-sided and all that.

836
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,240
And ultimately with these things, he might
have broken himself to the right and gone

837
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
to the right most probably.

838
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
But by going too much to the right, you see,
he must have felt the pull of the left, because

839
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,240
right is too much pulled out, then you sink
to the left.

840
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
And that's how he must have felt the compassion
for the lady.

841
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
But could be also with Kundalini.

842
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,240
With some people it can happen that Kundalini,
at the time of such tension and problems,

843
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,240
sometimes rises and tries to... because It's
a parasympathetic thing.

844
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,240
Might rise and just soothes the person, at
that point.

845
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,240
But most probably, I think, it is the sympathetic
activity which he was doing, and suddenly

846
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
the whole thing flashed into the right, then
he went to the left.

847
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Another lady who did some dirty act on the
stage, some filthy act, and she was not very

848
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,240
happy with it.

849
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,240
Though it was indecent, she had to do it.

850
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,240
And she did that on the stage, and after that
she was feeling very sad, and then suddenly

851
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,240
she felt a lot of fire in her stomach, tremendous
heat in her stomach.

852
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
And then in the morning, when she looked in
the mirror, she felt her eyes were all heated

853
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,240
up, and heat was coming out of her eyes, when
she looked at her eyes she felt very sad about

854
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
it, and all her body was frozen.

855
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,240
And this is the one where, I think, is Shri
Ganesha's anger, that He showed Himself as

856
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,240
the Mooladhara heat, and from the eyes Christ,
His heat was coming.

857
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
And because the heat was all consumed in those
chakras the rest of the body was heat.

858
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,240
One fellow has an experience that from his
back he gets cool breeze coming out, but not

859
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,240
from his head, because, I think, should be
an Agnya bhoot was blocked, so he's just emitting

860
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,240
from his back only, and the Kundalini is trying
to come out.

861
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240
(With) some people, the Kundalini will rise,
definitely.

862
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
The reason is this: that so many now of you
have got Realization.

863
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,240
And I have told you that once a particular
number of people gets it people will get the

864
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,240
experiences.

865
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
But getting the experience is a very vague
thing.

866
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,240
They are just vague; they do not know what
it is.

867
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
So it may be also that hundred monkey syndrome
has started and that people are getting this

868
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
Kundalini awakening within themselves.

869
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,240
Because suddenly so many revelations are coming
forward.

870
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,240
[Shri Mataji asks for the center leaders to
come and perform the Havan]

871
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,240
Let this fire light go into your Left Vishuddhi
and cleanse it completely, burn off all baddha.

872
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,240
May God bless you

873
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,240
So we had this complete, this Vishnumaya where
we have never done before.

874
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,240
And Left Vishuddhi has been the biggest problem
of this country - feeling guilty and all that.

875
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,240
So now I'm sure the people will come out of
it, and will try to show everyone not with

876
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,240
ego but with complete balanced mind, the dignity
of Sahaja Yogis.

877
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,240
May God bless you

878
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
Now, we have decided not to have too many
marriages in Switzerland, because, as you

879
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,240
see now, we cannot go up to that point where
we can have marriages.

880
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:57,240
It's all full of snow, you cannot have fire,
you cannot have all the arrangements.

881
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,240
Even a garland of flowers may cost you fifty
pounds.

882
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,240
And it's not going to be cheaper marriage,
in the sense that everything is so expensive,

883
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
even if you find out in the market.

884
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Now I have to make a request to you people:
those who want to get married in Switzerland

885
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
should be mostly the people who want to remarry,
or those people who can not at all afford

886
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
to go to India.

887
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
But try to help the people who do not have
enough to go to India, that they get married

888
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,240
in India.

889
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
It's much easier, it's much [inaudible], much
more simple.

890
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,240
All right?

891
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
So, if you understand that, if you can go
to India and if you have leave, then do it.

892
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,240
It's better to do it there.

893
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,240
And you need not jump...They say that [Indian
saying], means a person who is very anxious

894
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,240
to get married, doesn't even raise the head-dress
here, he ties upon his knee.

895
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,240
So one should not be that much excited.

896
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
Take a very sensible view of the whole thing,
those who want to get married.

897
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,240
And we have decided on the people who could
marry in Switzerland.

898
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
So those who have no money or something, apart
from this you should try to help them if possible,

899
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,240
every way possible.

900
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,240
I will also try to help.

901
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,240
Now another thing I have to say is that you
all have to send some money for My travel,

902
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,240
because I have to travel now.

903
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
We have been traveling throughout England,
again I have to travel; and if there is no

904
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
travel money, you know who has to pay the
amount.

905
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
But the people will be again replacing the
money of the travel, which will again be there

906
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,240
ready for other travel.

907
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,240
As it is, for India and all that, you don't
have to pay.

908
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,240
But, I think that, if you decide that I have
to travel, that you should pay for My traveling,

909
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,240
then it is better that you should send some
money for the traveling.

910
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
We have been all over the country and, so
far, nobody has paid anything for travel.

911
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,240
So please try to send the traveling money
to Gavin Brown, and all the money that you

912
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
want to contribute to him and the travel.

913
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
Now another one, we have decided now to keep
the emergency money.

914
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Plus, if you people donate more than the travel
money, or the money you want to donate for

915
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,240
the programs and all that, should be in the
emergency money.

916
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,240
It can be used for other things like mailing,
for photography or any kind of such expenses

917
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,240
where you have to have a hall - all these
things.

918
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,240
Certain people, like Isle of Wight people
have sent five-hundred pounds for the program,

919
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,240
within three persons it was too much so I
decided to pay half of it to them back to

920
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,240
the travel money.

921
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,240
Then we have to buy one tape recorder which
will cost about sixteen hundred, fifty in

922
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,240
the market, for which we have money - not
the whole but we have lot of it - and we have

923
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,240
to buy that also.

924
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,240
So the only now money left with us is emergency
money and the travel money.

925
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,240
Out of it, the travel money is very limited.

926
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,240
If I have to travel, then either I pay and
then we reimburse, or something like happens.

927
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,240
It's a big problem, because how to adjust
it and how to do it?

928
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,240
So keep it free from all these problems.

929
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
If you people donate some money for the travel
money to Gavin Brown, it will be easier, which

930
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,240
will be again replaced by the people.

931
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,240
But just now the traveling is important, for
which you have to pay.

932
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,240
And the rest of it, just now, is that we don't
have to pay much for anything else.

933
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
So that all the money should transfer to the
travel money - for the time being, only for

934
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,243
the time being.
