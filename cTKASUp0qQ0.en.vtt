00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.760
The Chakra of the Goddess

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:25.840
lies behind the sternum bone in the spinal cord.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.640
This Chakra is placed above the Bhavasagara,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.800
above the Void, as we call it in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.520
And the bridge that has to be crossed

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:58.560
by the bhaktas, by the seekers, is guarded by.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.600
She's the one, She helps Her children to come

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.680
through that passage

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.520
when there are negative forces trying to attack on a seeker.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.920
This chakra is placed at the back of the sternum bone as I told you.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.160
In childhood, the antibodies are formed

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.760
in the sternum bone.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:49.240
They are the warriors or the Sainikas of the Devi.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.480
Until the age of 12 years they grow and multiply,

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:05.440
and ultimately they all get distributed all over the body,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.560
and a human being is made

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.160
able to face any outside invasion on him.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:33.200
These antibodies know how to fight.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.280
They are extremely confident

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.520
and they know who are their enemies.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.160
They've all these messages built in themselves.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.560
So when the anti-God element enters into the being

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.000
through any process,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.640
say, through food, through words,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.160
through action, through devilish people,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.720
or black magic,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.480
these antibodies combine together,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.760
collectively fight the invaders.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:39.240
Those who do not have their Central Heart properly developed

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.840
suffer from tremendous insecurity all their lives.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.080
When they are children,

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.000
you try to control them by frightening.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.640
These children later on become extremely insecure.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.080
They are afraid of darkness, they are afraid of night.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.320
Some of them are afraid of everything.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.640
Because the antibodies that are built in the body

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.720
are not sufficient in number

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.160
and being this center so weak,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.520
the person feels extremely insecure.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.000
Later on in life when the child goes to the school

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:54.600
or he tries to work out something for the future,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.560
then also his confidence can be shaken

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.480
by parents, teachers, and outside people.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:13.280
So it is very important to understand children who are growing.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.160
In the West they analyze everything

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.480
and try to put human beings into compartments.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.040
First the child, is a child according to them,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.320
child has no innocence,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.040
and he's extremely selfish.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.040
Second part is adolescence,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.480
which they think is a very arbitrary, moody stuff.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:56.760
In India, we do not know that there is something like adolescence.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.640
Now these adolescent people form a group,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.680
and they start criticizing or making fun of all the elders.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.480
At a very young age it starts.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.200
First they make fun of the teachers, then of the parents,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.400
then of all the people who are senior to them.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.960
They start becoming extremely active in their brains

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.600
because they see too many televisions and things like that,

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.200
and then they start behaving at a very young age

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.640
in such violent ways that one cannot imagine.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.120
I used to live about 25 miles away from London.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.960
And every time I would go to London,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.560
I would find some children doing some sort of a mischief, somewhere.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.720
One day some of them entered into my compartment,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:10.360
and they started pulling out all the covers,

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.960
thrusting their knives into the seats,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.120
opening out all the upholstery.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.960
I was just sitting and watching.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.280
So I said, "Now are you tired? Please sit down.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.400
What's the problem?"

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.920
They said, "We are all very angry." I said, "For what?

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.760
Why are you angry?" Said, "We are just angry."

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.200
I said, "But you have to be angry for something."

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.520
They were children going to good schools definitely,

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.240
wearing very good clothes.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.880
And then I had to, when the train stopped, I called the ticket collector

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.680
and told him that these boys have been

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.520
doing all this hooliganic, hooliganism

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.440
in the compartment and you better look at it.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.480
And he came in and he said, "this is a common thing"

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.960
and then somehow or other he took them out.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.440
But the only thing I felt about them is,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.200
that all of them had their Center Heart catching.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:30.040
On the Kundalini, they were catching their Center Heart.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.560
But when they saw Me, they sat down.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.640
They were quiet, they listened to Me.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.960
I settled their Center Heart.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.600
And most of them said, "We are angry with our mother."

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.280
"Why?" "Because our brothers are angry."

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.200
"But why your brothers are angry?"

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.840
Then I discovered that Freud has given these funny ideas

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.360
against the mother.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.520
Mother itself, can you imagine!

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.720
What a anti-God activity it is.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.640
To an Indian, Mother is the primal thing

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.600
any Indian.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.400
Because his sense of security lies in the mother.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.280
Even if the father is hot-tempered,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.640
is angry, still they depend on the mother.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.760
Because mother knows when to get angry

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.360
and when not to get angry. She has the discrimination.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.760
And she is the one who protects them.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.960
The idea of Mother is completely blasted in the West,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.440
and this is the reason why

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.120
the children of that country feel so insecure,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:03.240
and when they grow, they are extremely insecure.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.920
You won't believe

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.880
that all the time they are polishing their brass,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.440
cleaning their house,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.280
but not even a rat enters their houses.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.480
And if they have to talk to someone,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.240
they'll make a person stand outside and talk from inside,

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.240
specially in London,

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.960
because they are literally frightened.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.120
Nobody will believe,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.760
the British who ruled us, are such frightened people.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.600
But they are.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.760
They are frightened of each other, they are frightened of themselves.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:44.080
The reason is, the Center Heart is absolutely weak.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.960
I've told you the first reason, the family insecurities.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.280
The child does not know when he comes back from school,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.480
whether his mother would be there or she would be gone.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.120
They don't have mothers who can bear a lot from the husbands

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.600
and smile and show no signs of their agony to their children.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.880
But the mothers in that country, I've seen,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.600
always try to use their children

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.040
from all kinds of emotional blackmail, you can call it.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.960
They try to torture the child

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.200
by telling all the things the husband is doing to them

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.840
and whatever is the problem they are facing with the husbands.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.920
So the child is not secured by the mother, but, on the contrary,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:40.800
child starts giving security to mother there.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.680
At a very young age it starts,

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.760
and the child becomes extremely negative

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.120
and left-sided. He feels that he's born in a place

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.640
full of hatred, insecurity, and fear.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.200
When a person is frightened,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.400
this center start breathing fast,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:09.200
giving rhythmic instructions to all the antibodies.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:16.080
With that you feel you are getting a palpitation in the heart.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.520
This palpitation is nothing

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.960
but a signal to all the antibodies to fight

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.520
the emergency of an attack.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:43.680
But when somebody builds up insecurity later on in life,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.680
it becomes a physical problem.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.960
If they have insecurities earlier,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.200
it is an emotional problem.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.760
But later on in life,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:01.680
when one develops a insecurity - any kind,

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.480
like a wife is insecure about her husband;

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.040
husband is a loafer or a bad man,

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.520
and carrying on with other women,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:18.520
so the motherhood of the wife is challenged.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.680
And when her motherhood is challenged,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:25.760
she may get the weakening of this center,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.520
by which she may suffer quite a lot

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.600
and may have even breast cancer.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.120
These insecurities can be also self-made, imaginary.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.960
People can just think about it

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.520
and build up some sort of insecurities,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:48.880
which are of no actual existence.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.880
But such fears are very much more in the West.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:00.120
Because the life in the West has no mooring,

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.720
has no explanation.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.040
Whatever you ask them, they'll say, "What's wrong?"

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.200
A husband will say, "What's wrong?" in having a keep.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.600
And the wife will also say,

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.160
"All right, if he wants to have a keep, let him have it."

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.680
In India, no woman would tolerate such a situation.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.040
She would starve, she would do everything,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.800
but she will never touch a man who has a keep.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:34.680
So the basis of the strength of Indian women

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.440
is their sense of chastity.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:41.200
The sense of chastity

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:45.520
in the Indian women is so great

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.440
that nothing can deter them

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.200
as long as they are chaste.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.520
But if they are not chaste,

00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.360
then fear settles in them very fast.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.880
Chastity is the strength of women.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.520
And that's why those women who have fear, mostly,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.600
have a problem of their chastity being challenged.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:22.560
A woman who is frightened that her chastity may be disturbed,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:30.920
also can develop a problem with the Heart Chakra.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:38.000
Such women can develop

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.600
breast cancers, breathing troubles,

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.040
and other kind of frightening diseases

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.120
on the emotional level also.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.280
This Chakra is ruined in women

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.240
when they lose their only child;

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:05.760
because their motherhood is finished, they feel.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.960
And that is the worst thing that can happen to a woman,

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.960
if she's a woman.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.760
But if she's not a woman, she doesn't feel much,

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.360
and she just behaves in a very manly way.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.320
And that's what I've seen in the West,

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.360
that women really don't much care when their children die.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.840
But it is because they are not women.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.840
If you are a woman

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.040
you definitely feel for your children and their death.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.120
But after some time,

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.720
such a woman comes back again

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.880
and she accepts the life as it is, for the sake of her husband,

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.920
or may be if she has more relations or other children.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.160
She becomes extremely powerful

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.000
as a reaction to what has happened to her.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:10.200
That's only possible if your center of Heart is all right.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.800
Such women do not grudge, do not complain,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.520
are extremely serene,

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.120
and can bear up lots of things.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.360
They are extremely tolerant

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:28.120
and can go to any extent to help their children,

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:31.360
but they are never spoiling their children.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.200
They never spoil their children,

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.200
because they understand

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.280
spoiling is much worse than beating the child.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.880
They never spoil the children, nor ever pamper them,

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.920
and never get dominated by their children.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.440
They know, "I have to guide the child

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.520
and have to look after the child."

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.440
So they look after all the ideals and righteousness

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.280
and the virtues of the child.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.120
And if he tries to get out of it,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.200
they go all out to win him over back to virtue

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.680
and to better life.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:14.040
But those people, those women, who do not care

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.120
for actual growth of the child,

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.440
may just avoid it and escape it.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.120
In the men, this chakra is caught up

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.600
if they have lost their mother very early,

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.960
or if their mother by chance is a very cruel woman.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.680
Also this chakra can be caught up by men,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.160
if they have been to wars,

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.840
and if they have seen frightful things in the war.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:52.120
Such people could be extremely emotional

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.400
and could be easily befooled

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.600
by people who try to win over their emotions.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.040
This Heart Center is caught up by various emotional problems

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.200
in human beings.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.280
Husband and wife, if they all the time quarrel,

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.600
there's always quarrelling in the house,

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.960
especially if the mother is very dominating,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.680
the child develops this center.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.600
And if the father is very dominating,

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.440
the child develops this - the Heart itself.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.960
So it is very important that

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.760
husband and wife should never quarrel

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.040
in the presence of their children.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:37.040
Center Heart can be developed in countries

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.680
where there's all fear, people are frightened.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.280
It can be developed by other things

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.440
by which people are frightened.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.040
Reading books of bad gurus

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.200
and reading the books about

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.040
shocking things, like many people who read

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.440
the Kundalini's book have got Center Heart

00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.200
because they are so frightened about the Kundalini!

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.440
Anything that frightens you if you read

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.520
can make your heart very, very weak and dangerous.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:12.440
So the right side of every human being

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.520
represents the fatherhood, the Fatherhood.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.280
And the Fatherhood of a man is very important.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.520
If this center is spoilt,

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.440
or if there's something wrong with it,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.440
then you get asthma as a disease.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.440
Asthma is only caused

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.880
by this center being spoilt

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.280
or some other combinations with this center.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.360
Asthma is very common among girls and boys.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.800
And the relationship with the father,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.080
or the understanding of the father,

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.760
or your own fatherhood is not all right,

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.440
you get this trouble of asthma,

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.680
and for that one has to ask the questions to the sadhakas,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.680
what sort of a father you have. As one gentleman came and asked Me,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.960
"Why everybody's asking me, what sort of a father you have?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.960
What sort of a - everybody asked me, what about your father,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.440
what about your father?

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.520
What has my father to do with me?"

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.760
Actually everybody feels the Right Heart,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.880
and they have to ask about the father.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.280
Because father resides in the Right Heart,

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.720
and the principle of fatherhood, if it is spoilt,

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.960
if there is a problem with the principle of fatherhood,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.520
then you get this problem and many other problems

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.680
which I do not want to discuss now at length.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.120
But you can understand a person who has no father,

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.280
how diffident he is, and how he behaves,

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.600
and also such people, those who have not known a father,

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:45.880
can become very wayward, licentious or permissive,

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.200
or could be very much secretly licentious.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.960
The people who lose their father do not

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.360
have that lacking - a lacking --

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.840
they lack in that discipline that the father gives them.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.600
Or could be, such people

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.200
could take to a very remorse and unhappy life.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.120
Or they could be very hard on their children,

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.200
or could be extremely kind and spoil the children.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.320
It could be any way. So it has of both the reactions,

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.520
either too much of love-giving or too much of strictness.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.200
It can be anything.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.520
Or a person could be of this kind,

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.520
may be very strict in childhood,

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.600
and could be extremely lavish in old age.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.200
It's a - it is a very imbalanced personality.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.120
So the person who has no father

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.440
has to know that his father is Shri Rama.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.280
He should not worry about anything.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.680
He is the One, with one arrow

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.960
He can kill any number of people.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.680
So he should have no fear, at all,

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.280
about his father not being there

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.520
or father being dead or something happening like that.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.000
On the contrary, if the father is dead,

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.200
it's better to tell him not to worry about you

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.040
and that you are all right,

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.200
so that you leave your father in peace

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.880
and ask him to take his birth,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.760
than to bind him to this earth.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.040
This is the Right Heart and the Left Heart is the mother,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.040
actually your own mother, whosoever it is.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.280
That is the motherhood, in the sense,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:25.760
that if your mother has been extremely unkind

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.960
and extremely funny,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.040
or your relationship with mother is bad,

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.360
then know that there's something wrong on the Left Heart

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.880
which is indicated in you.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.080
So these two points are very important in human beings.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.200
If a Sahaja Yogi just decides that

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.280
"I have a Father and a Mother;

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.040
God Almighty is my Father and my Mother"

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.280
then these problems can be easily solved.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.760
But in Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.760
it is not what you think that works out, it does not.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.960
Like in the car if you sit down and think that,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.960
"I am going to Connaught Place", you won't move.

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:04.760
You have to move your hands.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.760
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga you have to move your hands.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.120
Clear you Chakras, move them higher and put them up.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.880
It's not what you think is important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.200
Not at all. You may think that,

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.360
"I'm doing very well in Sahaja Yoga, I'm very good",

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:20.520
but it's not so.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:26.600
It is what you actually achieve, your ascent is the point.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.760
So, as in the car, as I told you,

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.360
you cannot just sit down and think and do the job.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.600
In the same way, you have to run this machine,

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:39.120
and you have to see that you get all this movement.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.520
There should be "ghati" in you. Otherwise,

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.280
there is no sense in just talking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.960
thinking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.200
and convincing yourself that you are a great Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.960
It is how you manifest it is the point,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.040
which very few people understand.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.200
Very, very few people understand that

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.960
it has to be manifesting, it has to be karyanmit.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.360
It is not just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk morning till evening.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.600
Even when I'm talking, now I'm opening your heart,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.040
Heart Center.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.960
I'm working it.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.600
Even I'm talking, also I'm opening. It's working.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.960
You will see your Heart Chakra is open

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.600
by the time I finish My lecture.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.680
It is so, because I know how to do it.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.120
When I talk I'm just watching

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.120
where the Chakras are catching,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.360
what's happening and I'm catching all these points and touching it

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.880
and trying to open it.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.360
And that's how it should be, that even when you talk it should be karyanvit.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.680
Even when you are quiet and raising hands

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.880
it should be karyanvit.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.760
Whatever you do, you should be karyanvit.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:42.880
Even if you glance at anyone it should be karyanvit,

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.440
it should not be just

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:51.720
a kind of a jabbering that we do sometimes about Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.880
The greatest fear human beings have

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.280
that they think they have done lots of mistakes,

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.960
and these mistakes are too many,

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.960
and they can never get Realization,

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.520
they'll be doomed, they'll be going to hell.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.680
This is not true, at all true.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.600
Nobody is going to go hell

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.120
if they you do not want to.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.960
If you want to stop it, you can stop it.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.520
The time has come.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.880
You are going to be blessed and blessed for ever.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.360
So may God bless you!

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.960
Today's lecture I've given you

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.600
in a way that you should understand importance

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.680
of confidence, but not by saying, "I am confident."

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.440
Because when you say outwardly you are actually egoistical.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.520
But when you say in your vibrations,

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.080
then you are confident.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.880
May God bless you all!
