1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:10,820
Today is a special day of Guru Nanaka’s
birthday.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:24,810
We have celebrated one Guru puja and, as you
know that, Guru Nanak was also the incarnation

3
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,460
of the Primordial Master.

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,290
The same Spirit came on this Earth.

5
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:43,459
And he’s the one who tried to re-establish
the work of Mohammed.

6
00:00:43,459 --> 00:00:54,510
Mohammed was the incarnation of the same Spirit
– the Primordial Master.

7
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,590
He came on this earth to establish the religion.

8
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:12,420
Islam is the name of that religion, is the
religion of every Sahaja Yogi, of every Christian,

9
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,449
of every Hindu.

10
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:28,610
We all belong to one religion which believes
in expanding our awareness to the new perception

11
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:36,299
of collectivity.

12
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:57,190
From human level to the higher level where
you can perceive and manifest the Divine Power.

13
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:04,629
This is the religion we are following.

14
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:13,929
All the religions were established on this
Earth to create the seekers.

15
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,030
You are the seekers.

16
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,330
You are the “men of God."

17
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:24,090
Now, all of you have to become prophets.

18
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:32,000
And to become prophets today’s Sahaja Yoga
has taken the form of Mahayoga.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,179
All of you have to become prophets.

20
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:45,840
The prophets have two special qualities, as
all the prophets had: First of all, they have

21
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,319
to talk about spiritual education.

22
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,840
All of them did that.

23
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:05,170
Mohammed Saheb did it, Raja Janaka did it,
Nanaka did it, Moses did it, Abraham did it.

24
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:24,000
All of them prophesised and taught you how
to lead yourself in the right path, by the

25
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,760
right action, by leading a right life.

26
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:41,020
You are going to be the prophets of a little
different nature.

27
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:59,530
You are prophets, you are Islamic, you are
Jews, you are Parsees, you are all those,

28
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:18,879
but you are going to become prophets which
are called as “pir’ in Islam, in Hindu

29
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,230
scriptures it’s called as “Atmasakshatkari’,
“Atmajas."

30
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:39,220
In the way Nanaka has described, he calls
them “par."

31
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:49,030
But you are endowed with a greater power.

32
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,960
There’s more power in you.

33
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:59,590
There they had a bigger propensity.

34
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:08,460
You have another delicate power by which you
can raise the Kundalini of people.

35
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:18,870
You are going to be prophets who are going
to make others prophets.

36
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:26,950
Not only to establish religion but to make
them prophets.

37
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:32,230
This is the most important thing.

38
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:42,420
Not just to maintain a static state of righteous
religious good people but to evolve those

39
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:49,540
seekers, those righteous, good, religious
people into prophets.

40
00:05:49,540 --> 00:06:01,290
And those prophets whom you will evolve will
also be the same type of prophets but they

41
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:10,670
will also have this additional power by which
they will also evolve.

42
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,290
That is why it is a Mahayoga.

43
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:30,640
This is the greatest work in the history of
all spiritual history, that you are the prophets

44
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:39,170
who are looking after the men of God, and
you are going to transform them into prophets.

45
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:54,070
To have so many prophets now, for me – you
can’t imagine how happy I must be feeling.

46
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:05,720
I have been, sometimes, very, very sharp with
you.

47
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,650
Sometimes I had to goad you.

48
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:20,590
Sometimes I had to love you, express my love
in that way, that you could feel that Mother

49
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,870
is very kind.

50
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:31,050
Sometimes I had to be very critical.

51
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,390
Sometimes also angry.

52
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,910
Behind all these aspects of your Mother, She
is nothing but Love.

53
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:47,260
Because She loves you so much, and She knows
that you have to be the prophets.

54
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:54,361
Your calibre may not be of the same level
as those prophets, maybe – you can’t say

55
00:07:54,361 --> 00:08:01,950
– but definitely you have got special powers.

56
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:12,880
Like, you can say, an old Rolls Royce might
be a better car as far as the propensity goes,

57
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,010
or an effect goes, or its behaviour goes – is
a good car.

58
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:27,250
But one of the modern ones may have more capacity
to show new acrobats.

59
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:36,489
For example it may tumble down, it may go
round the whole place and nothing will happen

60
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:37,489
to it.

61
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:44,570
Maybe, after some time, you might find a car
which goes half way and comes up a little,

62
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:52,630
like a hovercraft and then goes in the air,
and then again drops back.

63
00:08:52,630 --> 00:09:11,930
So, this new generation of great prophets
are here before me.

64
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:21,640
But the big difference between them and you
is this: that none of them had a Mother to

65
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:35,580
guide them, to love them, to encourage them
when they were depressed, and also to spoil

66
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,410
them.

67
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:52,580
But you have here a Mother who may apparently
look to be spoiling her children.

68
00:09:52,580 --> 00:10:03,580
But She is the Master of Masters and She knows
how far to take them and how to correct them.

69
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:12,240
Now, for all of you, I have to tell you that
you have to develop your independent discretion.

70
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:21,130
First of all we have to know that, in this
new realm where you have entered, you have

71
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:30,240
to have proper spiritual education, about
which I have given you so many lectures and

72
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,349
things.

73
00:10:31,349 --> 00:10:38,729
But education doesn’t mean listening to
lectures after Realisation, it means it should

74
00:10:38,729 --> 00:10:47,890
be imbibed within you, it should penetrate
into your veins, and into your every artery,

75
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,719
into every cell of your being.

76
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:56,570
You have to educate yourself spiritually.

77
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:09,240
And Guru Nanaka prophesised, just like William
Blake, that, “The men of God are going to

78
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:16,599
come during Kali Yuga, and there will be many
prophets who will be transforming prophets,

79
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:24,950
who will be transforming people into prophet
state,” [this] he had prophesised.

80
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,149
They have all prophesised about you!

81
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:38,100
Now you have to prophesise (sic) about those
who are going to be prophets.

82
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:47,270
But, as it is, you know that we need spiritual
education.

83
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:54,300
Because your Guru is a Mother we lack discipline.

84
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:00,219
There’s complete freedom for all of you.

85
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:05,669
You know that if you go to a guru what kind
of discipline you have to observe!

86
00:12:05,669 --> 00:12:10,380
I mean the real one, also.

87
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,730
Unreal, of course.

88
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,260
But even the real ones, how they test your
attention.

89
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:24,529
Even for the smallest thing, how they treat
you.

90
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:32,969
I’ll give an example of Ravi Shankar, who
was a very great, you know, who is a very

91
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:43,810
great sitar player: my father was an advisor
to the Maharaja of Maihar where their guru

92
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,260
(Allauddin Khan) was living.

93
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:53,740
This guru was a Muslim but he used to worship
Kali, Mother.

94
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,070
He used to worship Mother!

95
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,810
And [a] very self disciplined man.

96
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:06,350
They say he died at the age of 110 or 120
– Allauddin Khan Saheb.

97
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,840
And this Ravi Shankar was there.

98
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:19,770
I saw him as a young man, and this Ali Akbar
(Allauddin Khan’s son) whom you heard.

99
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,109
They were literally frightened of their guru,
who was a master himself.

100
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:28,440
He knew so many of these instruments.

101
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:37,639
One day my father, whom he used to respect
very much, always used to bow to him, though

102
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,130
he was a Muslim, they touched feet because
my father was a great connoisseur of music,

103
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:50,359
and a supporter of music, and he bowed to
him and he said, “Now, should I play?”

104
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:52,810
So he said, “Why not ask your disciple,
this Ravi Shankar, to play?”

105
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:57,560
And he said, “Yes, yes, come along, play."

106
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
he said, “Not today sir.

107
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,960
Please, not today."

108
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,550
he was very frightened.

109
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:08,209
Then he said, “Alright, let it be!” he
started playing.

110
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:10,060
He used to play on mrudangam.

111
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,459
Used to play beautiful mrudangam – tremendous!

112
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:19,240
I mean, you can’t imagine! he was a Realised-soul,
no doubt.

113
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:26,539
Then Ravi Shankar, when he finished and he
bowed to my father and he went away.

114
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:31,829
Then Ravi Shankar came to my father and he
said, “Don’t ask me to play before my

115
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:35,020
guruji!” he lifted his head and said, “See
here.

116
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,949
Do you see this bump?

117
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:44,359
This morning only, he hit me with my sitar,
which he broke, and this is the bump I have

118
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,359
got!”

119
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:47,990
So my father said, “What did you do?”

120
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,350
he said, “Only one note I played wrong!

121
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:58,820
That too not wrong but little out of tune,
and on that point he has broken this part

122
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:04,030
of my head and I have been in this terrible
pain and he said, “You are not to see any

123
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,030
doctor!”

124
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,030
And really there was a big bump.

125
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,839
He had covered it like that, with the hair.

126
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:21,649
(Laughter) That’s why today they have fame
as great masters, because to be masters you

127
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:27,789
have to obey your master and to discipline
yourself.

128
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:36,960
The spiritual education in Sahaja Yoga, under
Mataji Nirmala Devi, is absolutely left to

129
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:57,700
your own wisdom: there is no force, there
is no compulsion, there is no organisation.

130
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:07,039
It is you who has to feel the joy of your
Spirit and it is you who has to share it with

131
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,039
others.

132
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:16,620
It is you who has to raise the Kundalini of
others.

133
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:36,370
Now, today, when we are thinking of a Great
Prophet who, on this Earth, came to establish

134
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:42,620
good relationships between Hindus and Muslims.

135
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:50,479
Imagine, when Mohammed Sahib came he did not
know that he was facing these horrible people

136
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:53,810
there who murdered him.

137
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:57,209
Actually they murdered him.

138
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,609
They gave him poison.

139
00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:12,120
And when he died he said that, “There will
not be any need for any prophet to come in."

140
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:17,140
Naturally, if you torture somebody, what else
he’s going to say?

141
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:24,370
Also, he felt that whatever he has said, being
such a truth, it will definitely prosper and

142
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,300
the seed has been sown.

143
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:34,350
And he said, “There is no need for another
advent of a master."

144
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:46,980
But he found out that there was a big aggression
by the so-called followers of Mohammed, who

145
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:54,350
talked of nothing but rehmat (رحمت) – is
compassion.

146
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:08,140
Now, before his death he encountered all kinds
of attacks from the negative people.

147
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,030
Of all of them, the worst of all!

148
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,220
I think he has suffered the worst.

149
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:23,740
He had to move from places to places, hiding
the children away from negative forces, [from]

150
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,880
tribes to tribes.

151
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:40,530
It was a tremendous life, the way he led it.

152
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:51,470
And all his life there was nothing but struggle
for existence.

153
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,550
Only struggle for existence.

154
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:13,490
When Nanaka came in, he saw that Hindus and
Muslims were fighting, so he started his theme

155
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:27,080
with Kabira, saying that, “Ram and Rahim
are both the same, and how can you differentiate

156
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,320
between the two?”

157
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,230
All their theme was like this, of integration
of these two main religions which existed

158
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:40,310
in India.

159
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,170
That time, there was no question of giving
Realisation.

160
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:50,100
People were trying to defend their faiths
and fight each other and kill each other.

161
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Imagine!

162
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,190
Created by the same Spirit!

163
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,400
Fighting among themselves!

164
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,740
How silly it must be, and absurd.

165
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,050
In many places Nanak Saheb has proved that
he was Mohammed.

166
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:10,720
Once, he was lying down and his feet were
towards Mecca.

167
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,110
So people said, “How can you put your feet
towards Mecca?”

168
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,800
He had Muslim disciples and also Hindu disciples.

169
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,130
He said, “Alright, whichever way you say,
I’ll put my feet."

170
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,500
He turned round his feet.

171
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,060
They said, “Still you are towards Mecca."

172
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:30,730
He went round and round and round [but] still
they saw him facing Mecca!

173
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:43,680
And they could not understand how it was that
he was facing, his feet were towards Mecca,

174
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,440
that Mecca was at his lotus feet.

175
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,560
Same with Mohammed.

176
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:59,510
Now, all these great incarnations had a special
power over water.

177
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:09,820
Because you know, in the stomach we have our
Void and Nabhi Chakra which is made of ocean.

178
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:19,920
Ocean represents the incarnation of Adi Guru
– Dattatreya.

179
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,500
These had great powers over oceans and over
water.

180
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:32,620
Like Moses – he crossed the ocean by creating
a road.

181
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:39,070
That’s one of the very significant things
which shows that the Void can be crossed with

182
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,850
the help of the Guru.

183
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:48,320
And even Mohammed Saheb had a tremendous power
over ocean.

184
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:56,950
Then, Nanaka once put his hand on a rock and
water started coming out of that.

185
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,950
People were amazed how it started.

186
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,490
And that’s why it is called as ‘Punja-saheb’.

187
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,050
‘Punja’ means ‘the hand’.

188
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,110
‘Punja’ means ‘the five fingers’,
like this.

189
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:18,030
What do you say to this, this part, [of the]
hand?

190
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,890
Hand with five fingers?

191
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,970
Yogis: This is the palm.

192
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,530
Shri Mataji: No, no, not the palm!

193
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,220
The whole thing.

194
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,220
Like this is a punja.

195
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,220
‘Hand’.

196
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,220
Yogis: The hand.

197
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,220
The open hand.

198
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,910
Shri Mataji: But hand can be like this (a
fist) you see?

199
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,910
This way.

200
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,460
There’s no word, alright.

201
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,930
So this is ‘punja’ – this is five.

202
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:50,960
And ‘punjab’ is five waters, five rivers
– in that area – are called Punjab.

203
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,140
Now, another thing about these: all these
incarnations had to deal with your attention.

204
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,850
So they were particular about looking after
your attention.

205
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:12,910
And that is why, from the time Moses or Abraham
came in, they talked of no alcoholism.

206
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,530
All of them.

207
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:24,040
It is written very clearly in The Bible that
the strong alcohols, fermented, should not

208
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
be taken.

209
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,950
If you don’t want to read it, one need not.

210
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,000
But they think it was Moses who said it and
Christ did not say – so Christians can take

211
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,980
it, the Moses people should not take it.

212
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,970
There is no breaking of link between Moses
and Christ.

213
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,340
They are of the same tree, of the same pattern,
of the same thing.

214
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:51,950
But those who want to use Moses for their
own purpose will follow as much as Moses has

215
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:57,860
said, and those who want to follow Christ
will follow only as much as Christ has said,

216
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,690
because it’s very good for them.

217
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:07,880
For such useless people Sahaja Yoga has no
place.

218
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:17,240
We have to understand that all these people
have said for our good and for the maintenance

219
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:25,410
of our spiritual life and none of them are
to be criticised or to be challenged but to

220
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,870
be fully respected as our Guru.

221
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,310
All of them.

222
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:39,670
Whether one belongs to Islam religion or to
the Jew religion or to the Christian religion

223
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,230
or to the Hindu religion.

224
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:48,120
And if they are fanatic they are going against
their guru – it is against their guru.

225
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,970
So, they were against fanaticism.

226
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,920
First thing they were against [was] alcoholism.

227
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,320
That’s the first thing, they thought, because
somehow human beings take to alcoholism very

228
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
fast.

229
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:07,360
At the time of Mohammed Saheb, people did
not know how to smoke.

230
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,670
Then they developed, became modern.

231
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,540
At the time of Nanaka they started smoking
so he prohibited that.

232
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:23,110
But Mohammed Sahib said that, “Anything
that goes against your awareness, any intoxication

233
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:34,920
of any kind” – he generally, he gave a
very general instruction, “is against God."

234
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:44,510
So, our training, our spiritual education
should be that we cannot be fanatics anymore.

235
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:53,220
If you are fanatic anymore, or you are identified
with any one of your old ideas, then beware!

236
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,360
Be very, very careful!

237
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,810
You cannot have fanatic ideas anymore if you
want to be a good Sahaja Yogi or a Maha Yogi

238
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:15,180
– meaning a person who is a prophet, not
only a prophet, but who is capable of transforming

239
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:21,290
others into prophets.

240
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:25,990
First is, you have to be away from alcoholism.

241
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,870
You should be deadly against it.

242
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:37,150
Whenever you have a chance you find it that
it is possible for you to say something against

243
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,150
alcoholism.

244
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:42,500
It should be absolutely boycotted.

245
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:55,290
Every place, anywhere you meet, it should
be smoking or any kind of intoxication, drugging,

246
00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:03,330
anything, has to be completely branded as
anti-God, anti-Sahaja Yoga.

247
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:08,570
Then, fanaticism of any kind.

248
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,030
That lingers on.

249
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:14,400
This is another very deep misidentification.

250
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,280
I am aware of it.

251
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:26,190
I did not talk of Catholicism till the other
day I went to Portugal, when I had to talk.

252
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,000
So I said [for the] first time.

253
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,400
I never talked about Protestants before, till
I had to talk that they are another mad race

254
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,400
going round!

255
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,510
There are 27 churches of this kind.

256
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:49,680
None of them, except for we, are really Christians.

257
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:58,270
All are nonsensical fanatics: Seventh Day
Adventists and Pentecostals, and this and

258
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:00,230
that.

259
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,550
All are absurd ideas!

260
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,970
All are playing into the hands of bhoots,
take it from me.

261
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:10,060
They have nothing to do with God, they are
anti-God.

262
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:18,350
All those who still stick on to all these
churches and to this kind of fanaticism – I

263
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:25,730
am saying here of churches because here I
have to talk about churches – should know

264
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,960
that all these churches have now become the
place of bhoots.

265
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:36,730
You’ll go to one church and you’ll rush
to me!

266
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:43,990
From my house I see in the night, hosts of
bhoots waiting out of the church.

267
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:52,830
(Laughter) I do not know! (laughing) And somehow
it’s happening that, whatever house I decide

268
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,830
to stay in, there’s a big church in front
of me.

269
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,930
(Laughter) It may be a Catholic church, may
be a Protestant church.

270
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:06,270
And they have seen to it that they make it
really bhootish by making all those who die

271
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,490
stay in that church.

272
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,050
They are not Realised people.

273
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:19,130
Realised people only should be buried and
all others should be burnt off.

274
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,130
It’s better.

275
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:22,420
At least the bhoots go out of them.

276
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,630
And they are roaming about in the church,
and you are taking the children down there

277
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,560
into the cemetery!

278
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:35,340
Apart from that wherever there is a anadhikaar
cheshta (अनधिकार चेष्टा

279
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,350
meaning ‘unauthorised activity’) – when
it is unauthorised – Gods do not exist there.

280
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,450
They leave the place.

281
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:48,590
So, we have to know that we are no more fanatics.

282
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,560
First and foremost thing is that we cannot
be fanatics.

283
00:29:52,560 --> 00:30:00,930
Now, training ourselves is very important,
spiritual education is very important.

284
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:09,120
But in Sahaja Yoga, as your Mother is a very
kind teacher, but even such a kind teacher

285
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:16,680
is not such a help sometimes because all corrections
are left to yourself, and then you commit

286
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,940
really blunders and then you think, “Why
didn’t Mother tell us?

287
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:25,360
Why didn’t She protect us, why didn’t
She correct?”

288
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,600
But this is the style I have adopted because
in modern times, Sahaja Yoga is working out

289
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,850
because I do not challenge your ego.

290
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,970
Otherwise you would have crucified me long
time back.

291
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:44,240
So I leave it to you to decide to discipline
yourself.

292
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,330
It is for you to discipline yourself and understand
yourself.

293
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:56,840
Now, the best way to discipline yourself is
to find out, “What’s wrong with me?”

294
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Not with others.

295
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,360
We are very good at that.

296
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,670
I have seen every day there’s some complaint
about somebody coming from someone.

297
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:12,650
But there are very few who will say, “This
is wrong with me, Mother, what to do?”

298
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,740
So just try to find out what is wrong with
you.

299
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,190
You are like a fort.

300
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:24,200
The fort has some sort of a weakness.

301
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:32,410
So, the man in charge of the fort – what
do you call him?

302
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:39,390
We call kiledaar ( किलेदार ) because
a fort is kila and the gentleman is the owner

303
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,910
of the kila, is called as kiledaar.

304
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:50,800
Now, this kiledaar finds out what are the
weak points of the fort and he sees to it

305
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,350
that they are all corrected one by one.

306
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:57,480
We are just the other way round.

307
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,500
We know we have weaknesses which we hide and
keep them there as they are.

308
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:09,120
Whatever strong points we have that we boast
of and we try to see the weaknesses of others,

309
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,030
and from these loopholes all these negative
things creep in and suddenly you find that

310
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,730
you are finished.

311
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:25,490
So try to find out what are your weaknesses.

312
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:34,240
One of the weaknesses, which is very common
is that we are very materialistic people,

313
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,770
we are still very materialistic, extremely
materialistic.

314
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:47,680
And the materialism is getting subtler and
subtler the subtler we be.

315
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,180
Try to give up some things.

316
00:32:50,180 --> 00:33:00,300
Keep a kind of a little balanced attitude,
a little detached attitude, not too many things.

317
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,710
Few things of value.

318
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,110
Try to detach yourself.

319
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,270
I don’t say you become sanyasis.

320
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,110
That is also another thing against.

321
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,600
But from inside you detach.

322
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:27,030
See, I’m wearing a very nice sari, but from
inside see what is the colour.

323
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,360
(Laughter)

324
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,590
From inside you should be detached, not from
outside.

325
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,730
So that, try to practice this detachment.

326
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,850
Whatever you want to possess, you just don’t
possess.

327
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:45,350
Teach your body, teach your mind: “No!

328
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,540
You want a shirt?

329
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,470
No!Nothing doing!”

330
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,470
You try.

331
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,370
Train up your body.

332
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:58,520
Now some people want comfort, the body wants
comfort.

333
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,320
Alright, “You want comfort?

334
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:07,530
No, I will sleep on the ground and teach you
a lesson!”

335
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,689
Teach your body a lesson!

336
00:34:10,689 --> 00:34:14,259
Teach your wants and desires a lesson!

337
00:34:14,259 --> 00:34:16,719
Let’s see what happens.

338
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,570
Now, I don’t know why, but in England it
should not be so.

339
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,790
I mean I expected people absolutely detached
because they have got everything.

340
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:31,800
But here it is much more attachment than detachment.

341
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,179
There is no satisfaction of any kind.

342
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:50,949
So, a kind of a detachment must be developed,
to your desires, to your belongings, to your

343
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:58,089
possessions and whatever kind of a material
aspect you want to build up.

344
00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:06,109
I always said that you must not look like
people who are coming from the lunatic asylum,

345
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:13,179
that’s true, but you should also not look
like a dandy person, with a flair, a big bow

346
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:16,720
here, and a sort of a thing.

347
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,659
You should be in the centre.

348
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:24,070
And how are you in centre?

349
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,310
When you are detached.

350
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,860
Then nothing can impress you.

351
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:34,189
But that doesn’t mean…some people I’ve
seen that outside they make a show, that they

352
00:35:34,189 --> 00:35:40,220
are absolutely dishevelled, absolutely in
a very filthy condition, smelling like pigs.

353
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,960
(Laughter) They think they are going to take
an avatara of Varaha (boar incarnation of

354
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,899
Shri Vishnu) by smelling like pigs!

355
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:56,600
And all sorts of funny things they do in the
name of detachment.

356
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,149
No – detachment is within.

357
00:35:59,149 --> 00:36:03,949
Try to practice it.

358
00:36:03,949 --> 00:36:07,379
That is one of the educations you have to
develop.

359
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:09,679
How do you develop that detachment?

360
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,429
Is by giving things away.

361
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:17,629
Not to me, but giving things away to others.

362
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:21,699
Say you reach a certain state of – say you
have two suits.

363
00:36:21,699 --> 00:36:25,150
If you have a third one then give it away.

364
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,189
Give away things.

365
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:34,579
It’s a very good way of developing detachment,
and enjoying the giving away than possessing.

366
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:42,440
It’s greater, is much greater, take it from
me, is much greater than possessing.

367
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:54,129
Now for you, at this stage, I cannot say,
but maybe after some time, it will become

368
00:36:54,129 --> 00:37:01,080
that I prophesise that you will become sinless,
absolutely sinless.

369
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,810
You cannot do sin and whatever you do will
not be sin.

370
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,990
I am sinless.

371
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:13,060
Even if I rob you of all your wealth nobody
can say I have committed sin.

372
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,270
I am absolutely sinless.

373
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:23,480
Even if I kill thousands and thousands of
people nobody would say that I have killed

374
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,260
because I am sinless.

375
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:36,240
But, despite all that state, I do not commit
any so-called sin because I have to lay down

376
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,720
my life in such a way that you people follow.

377
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,839
That you should not tomorrow say that, “Mother
did this, She has done this so why not we?”

378
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,649
That’s why I’m so very particular.

379
00:37:50,649 --> 00:38:00,560
At the same point I would like to tell you
that today Chaya, in her sweetness, went and

380
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,169
bought a very expensive sari.

381
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:12,240
And she brought with such love and affection
to me, that I had told her just buy me a £10

382
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,710
worth of a shawl and she couldn’t bear the
idea.

383
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:27,790
But she should know [that] for me anything
is valuable that you give to me.

384
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,649
Nothing expensive is needed.

385
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:38,230
Even if you give me the most expensive I have
every right on that.

386
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:46,760
But you must understand that if this practice
is continued too much it will create a bad

387
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
public opinion.

388
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,770
So, at the most, definitely decide that you’ll
give me only two saris, that’s all.

389
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,599
I don’t need even these two.

390
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:58,850
And I can have all of them.

391
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:04,640
So, the situation is such that we have to
be very careful about the public opinion,

392
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,080
and people may start saying tomorrow, “Oh!

393
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,990
Mother, She wears all expensive saris."

394
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,030
Let my husband buy for me, he has lots of
money!

395
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,490
And you can buy me very ordinary things.

396
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,169
And I told once Modi that, “You buy me khadi
(homespun) saris, that’s the best,” but

397
00:39:22,169 --> 00:39:23,280
he couldn’t bear it.

398
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,550
It was too much for him.

399
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:30,230
He says that, “Mother, we are middle class
people and we are giving you something middle

400
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,230
class."

401
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,230
I said, “Alright."

402
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,530
So, once for all I told them, “Alright,
you buy some saris."

403
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,880
And then I bought for them, one of them is
this one, and I don’t know if the whole

404
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,800
money is paid – most of the money I have
paid.

405
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,790
But still, you know, there was somebody who
came out with an objection!

406
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:55,570
I know you love me very much and you want
to do something for me like that, but I would

407
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:03,230
request that try to get things which are sober
and simple for me.

408
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:09,819
By God’s Grace, you should know your Mother
is looked after, you don’t have to worry.

409
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:20,480
Supposing I was a beggar then you would have
had to spend much more money but that is not

410
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,480
so.

411
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,080
And it is not that it is in any way wrong,
on the contrary, it’s a very great thing.

412
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:30,040
After all these are going to be in your Mother’s
personal archives and people are going to

413
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:35,230
see what saris you people gave me, and they’re
going to be very happy – of course, no doubt

414
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:37,930
– and that’s going to be very, very great
for you.

415
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:44,340
But, still, where the public is concerned
you be careful and understand that when you

416
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:52,010
do anything like that for me, this public
is mad and we have to keep a proper balance.

417
00:40:52,010 --> 00:41:03,599
Now, about training yourself, as I said, detachment,
then another thing is astuteness – astuteness.

418
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,869
Try to develop astute habits – astute – specially
for religious work.

419
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:16,840
First of all understand that you have to give
some money for Sahaja Yoga work.

420
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,610
In that you should be astute.

421
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:25,130
I was amazed to hear from some people that
for food also you want to have free – that

422
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,359
sometimes you had food you didn’t pay even
one pound.

423
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:30,090
I mean this is absurd.

424
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:36,290
If you were beggars is alright, but for Sahaja
Yoga, first of all, it’s not too much.

425
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,220
But little you have to pay.

426
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,609
And you should not make your Mother pay for
you.

427
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:42,609
It’s wrong.

428
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:47,040
I never said this before, but today I’m
telling you.

429
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,000
Not aesthetically, but spiritually it is wrong
that I should pay for you.

430
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,210
It’s alright – I may give you a dinner,
it’s different, I may give you anything,

431
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:04,100
it’s different, but that you should not
try to take advantage in any way or exploit

432
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:13,619
in any way this Mother of yours, who has got
lots of things other than what you know of,

433
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,050
which can work out against your spiritual
growth.

434
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:20,530
So just don’t do anything like that.

435
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,970
No exploitation.

436
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,419
Learn that.

437
00:42:25,419 --> 00:42:30,270
Those who have done such a thing must decide
that no more like that.

438
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:35,689
Now, I’ll tell you a difference between
Indians and you people is this: that an Indian

439
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:37,970
would never do that.

440
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:43,619
We had one Indian coming here and he was not
such a big Sahaja Yogi, but he used to come

441
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:47,820
for his puja, and he would not take money
for his puja and these people had to fight

442
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,820
with him.

443
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,629
Ask him, he’s sitting down, he would not
take.

444
00:42:50,629 --> 00:42:55,349
But how materialistic we are!

445
00:42:55,349 --> 00:43:00,990
And then, when people mesmerise you then you
buy a Rolls Royce for that person, and here

446
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:06,630
a Mother is giving you all the freedom, so
you are exploiting your Mother!

447
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,330
“I have no job,” all this is wrong.

448
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:15,760
You must pay for your food, and must pay where
you have to pay.

449
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,100
That’s your dharma, that’s your religion,
of every Sahaja Yogi.

450
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:26,040
Alright, you need not pay too much, but you
must pay where it has to be paid.

451
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,980
And never take a parasitic attitude.

452
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,369
That will kill your growth, will dwarf you.

453
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:36,510
I am warning you about it.

454
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,510
Astuteness.

455
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:43,159
For payment, for accounting, for everything,
one has to be extremely astute.

456
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:48,689
Like, I’ll tell you, I have seen people
used to come to my house, long time back – I

457
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:52,669
shouldn’t say this but [it] used to be so
funny – they would go in the kitchen, take

458
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:55,550
out anything, eat anything, walk off anywhere.

459
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,689
It was amazing!

460
00:43:57,689 --> 00:43:59,240
Our cooks could not understand.

461
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,510
Nobody could understand such people.

462
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:06,439
Just coming in the house, walking into the
kitchen, taking off whatever they like, eat

463
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:07,439
anything.

464
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:08,439
Like bounders!

465
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:21,000
This training has to come within you where
you must realise and understand that astuteness

466
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,319
towards Sahaja Yoga has to be maintained.

467
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:34,609
Like going into the ashram, walking into somebody’s
kitchen, taking out things.

468
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:41,520
Using the ashram in a state as if it does
not matter.

469
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,520
It’s ashram!

470
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,740
It’s a pure thing.

471
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:46,750
You cannot fight in an ashram.

472
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,439
You cannot talk loudly in an ashram.

473
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:52,099
You have to lead a pure life in an ashram.

474
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:54,839
You cannot play games with each other.

475
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,480
You cannot make it dirty.

476
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,569
You cannot spoil it, otherwise your spiritual
growth won’t come up.

477
00:45:00,569 --> 00:45:06,179
This is the simplest thing one should know,
is to respect Sahaja Yoga.

478
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:09,189
Love without respect has no meaning.

479
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:13,869
You have to respect, and respect the place,
respect everything.

480
00:45:13,869 --> 00:45:18,369
Keep it clean, be astute about it.

481
00:45:18,369 --> 00:45:21,210
And this is one of the greatest trainings.

482
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:27,129
I don’t know how, but to a British mind
it should not be told, because they are known

483
00:45:27,129 --> 00:45:28,740
for this kind of a training!

484
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:40,199
But I don’t know, because now you are saints,
I think, I feel that you have had other kind

485
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:45,560
of training before, that you are born as saints.

486
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:54,750
Perhaps you have no self-esteem yet, of the
value that should be given to your own character.

487
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,449
Without that, nobody is going to be impressed
by you.

488
00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:02,220
Nobody is going to be impressed by you.

489
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,000
Nobody is going to become a prophet.

490
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,830
You have to first of all impress.

491
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,890
You have to dress up in such a way that you
impress others.

492
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:14,850
It’s a very important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

493
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,609
You have to talk in such a way that you impress
others.

494
00:46:17,609 --> 00:46:22,919
Supposing somebody’s very fat, he must reduce,
somebody’s very thin, he must put on.

495
00:46:22,919 --> 00:46:25,939
He must try to have a body of the centre.

496
00:46:25,939 --> 00:46:31,050
Should not allow the body to move this way
or that way.

497
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:38,679
One has to be in a proper shape, in proper
dress, because you have to impress on others.

498
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:43,310
You must know that if the personality is not
impressive how are you going to communicate?

499
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:48,829
Because first of all the people see you, those
of you who come to you, see your outside.

500
00:46:48,829 --> 00:46:52,939
They don’t see your vibrations they see
your outside.

501
00:46:52,939 --> 00:47:01,199
So, all of you must learn how to dress up
and how to behave towards others, how to appear

502
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:07,480
before others, how to talk to others, so that
you become prophets who will do wonders and

503
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:15,850
who will transform many, many, many more people
into the same state as you are.

504
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:21,339
Now, this training you have to take yourself.

505
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:27,179
The another point in training in Sahaja Yoga
is that you have to read.

506
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:36,669
There are many people who have not read even
Gregoire’s book, leave alone any other.

507
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:44,869
You have to learn certain things like chakras
and centres and mantras and you have to dedicate.

508
00:47:44,869 --> 00:47:49,772
Even people like Vivekanada’s who never
got Realisation – do you know, these people,

509
00:47:49,772 --> 00:47:54,399
twelve people – they used to study for fourteen
hours.

510
00:47:54,399 --> 00:48:03,389
Now you will know what to study, what not
to study, and even if you study wrong things,

511
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:04,389
you will know where it is wrong.

512
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:05,389
So you have to study.

513
00:48:05,389 --> 00:48:08,689
For example, there are Jews with us – let
them study Torah and see there where is it,

514
00:48:08,689 --> 00:48:10,000
Sahaja Yoga, in there written down.

515
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,620
Find it out!

516
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,329
If you are Christians read the Bible, find
out.

517
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:19,800
You should read Gita, you should read Upanishadas,
and you should be masters.

518
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:27,179
You’ll find that Sahaj Yoga is such a light
that you will know what it is.

519
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:33,669
We have got the Devi’s names and the Sahastranamas:
try to read them and try to understand the

520
00:48:33,669 --> 00:48:37,540
meaning of that and try to understand what
it means, how far it goes.

521
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:43,050
That’s how the depth of your knowledge will
increase and your Sahaja Yoga will tell you

522
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:48,699
what is right and what is wrong.

523
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:54,559
Now emotionally, some of you have terribly
emotional weaknesses: the idea of ‘love’.

524
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:02,050
[About] that I must speak to you because it
has come from a group of people who went into

525
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:04,760
another style against the ego-oriented people.

526
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,370
And they believe that love means hugging each
other, kissing each other.

527
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:13,540
This type [of] nonsense is not love.

528
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:22,199
Love is this, that flows, that is love.

529
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:25,250
And understand the person through this alone.

530
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:31,340
And all nonsensical loves that people talk
of is not love.

531
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:37,599
When a person loves you he doesn’t stare
into you.

532
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:48,240
If somebody stares into you then know he does
not love you – he’s full of a bhoot.

533
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:56,319
Only when a realised soul is angry he stares
to drive out the badhas.

534
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:02,159
So, anybody who stares into your eyes and
says, “I have love,” then know that it

535
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:03,169
is mesmerism.

536
00:50:03,169 --> 00:50:13,130
With discretion you will know this: that anybody
who loves, only a glance is sufficient.

537
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:25,829
But when it is an anti-Christ activity going
on then you can stare at that person and the

538
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:27,309
thing increases.

539
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:34,020
So the idea of love is so absurd.

540
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:43,730
Love is the one that corrects, that improves,
that elevates, which is blissful.

541
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:50,359
The relationship is blissful, not hallucinations.

542
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:58,699
And this blissfulness is only felt through
vibrations not through by hugging or by kissing

543
00:50:58,699 --> 00:51:05,160
or anything, just through vibrations.

544
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:10,830
Of course, I don’t say you should not hug
each other and you should not kiss each other

545
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:14,060
– you should, but that’s not the way it
is expressed, it’s through the vibrations.

546
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:22,179
It’s the pure love of your being which emits
just like light.

547
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:31,939
Everything should be done in the proper education
of the spiritual love.

548
00:51:31,939 --> 00:51:36,649
We are people of dignity and sobriety.

549
00:51:36,649 --> 00:51:39,649
I have told you this before.

550
00:51:39,649 --> 00:51:43,609
Like, some people have a habit of doing this
in the — no!

551
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:54,530
If you are sitting in a posture try to sit
for at least an hour – try.

552
00:51:54,530 --> 00:52:01,720
I have sat on one posture for nine hours,
people have seen: didn’t go to bathroom

553
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,449
or eat anything and just sitting there nine
hours.

554
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:10,490
This is known as baithak is ‘the seat’.

555
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:15,349
And this baithak has to be great in Sahaja
Yoga.

556
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:20,899
Try to establish your baithak, that is very
important, so that your attention is brought

557
00:52:20,899 --> 00:52:26,470
in line with your Mooladhara and is straight
there.

558
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:35,710
Once you do that, practice it, you will find
your spiritual growth would be better.

559
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:38,939
Walk erect, be straight.

560
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:43,389
In your talks be straight, kind and gentle.

561
00:52:43,389 --> 00:52:44,720
Need not shout.

562
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,169
No Sahaja Yogi should shout at anybody else,
should play games with another, should not

563
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:59,000
in any way be angry with each other – is
prohibited.

564
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:05,010
Should not get into any tantrums of pulling
your hair or doing something like that – is

565
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,100
all nonsensical.

566
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,730
You have to be very, very dignified.

567
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:19,130
But another foxy method which we employ very
much is to tease and provoke another Sahaja

568
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:24,619
Yogi, which is even worse, because it hits
you at a subtler point.

569
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:28,859
Try to be straight, straightforward.

570
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:35,069
Allow your mind to come to normal when you
talk.

571
00:53:35,069 --> 00:53:44,139
If you have to say something, wait and try
to say something nice, not artificial.

572
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:50,689
Try to say something from your heart, not
to show off.

573
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:58,409
In talking also too much quietness is not
good, too much talking is not good.

574
00:53:58,409 --> 00:54:03,349
Some suffer from too much talking and some
do not talk at all.

575
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:09,250
It’s better to talk whenever it is necessary.

576
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:15,480
Talk something sweet, no sharpness and sarcasm.

577
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,439
That will spoil your Vishuddhi.

578
00:54:18,439 --> 00:54:22,130
Sarcasm is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

579
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:27,439
You are not to be sarcastic to each other.

580
00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:38,399
Because of a new generation and a new race
that you are, you have to learn that to keep

581
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:44,530
your vibrations alright you have to have collectivity
within you.

582
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:50,270
Because you are collectively so much charged
that’s why the Kundalini’s rising.

583
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:59,699
If your collectivity breaks then it’s a
very, very, very, very wrong thing.

584
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:07,409
So, try to be nice to each other, kind to
each other, try to understand each other’s

585
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:08,409
problem.

586
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:16,869
And never, never complain to me about any
other Sahaja Yogi – till I ask.

587
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:19,210
It’s prohibited!

588
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:24,240
If you have to say, tell me about yourself.

589
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,030
Unless and until of course something happens,
then it’s alright, but not against anyone.

590
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:35,339
Because you will only see the bad points of
the another person and you will not imbibe

591
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:36,530
the good points.

592
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:43,470
You have to meditate and think about what
you have to do to become the real prophets

593
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:47,299
of modern times of Mahayoga.

594
00:55:47,299 --> 00:55:52,439
How you have to dress up, how you have to
behave, how you have to talk, and how you

595
00:55:52,439 --> 00:55:59,169
have to be kindly, that you have to decide.

596
00:55:59,169 --> 00:56:12,380
On this day, I would say that I have talked
a lot and only thing that you have to do is

597
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,970
to imbibe it in you and not on others, that’s
all.

598
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:27,189
To others you have to be kind, you have to
be sweet, you have to be patient, gentle.

599
00:56:27,189 --> 00:56:32,320
Now, today’s puja has to be very simple
because it is the puja of Guru, who is an

600
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,320
avadhuta.

601
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:40,639
Avadhuta, as I told you, always teaches you
that the whole thing is futile, all this pattern

602
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:41,800
is futile.

603
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:47,409
He even doesn’t talk of any Deities, because
he says, “Alright, let’s worship the Abstract.

604
00:56:47,409 --> 00:56:49,560
Why talk of the Deity?”

605
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,770
Though they will talk of the Mother, alright.

606
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,990
All of them talk of the Mother.

607
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:58,020
But not of a Deity, because they think if
you talk of the Deity, people will talk more

608
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:01,369
about the Deity and not about the essence.

609
00:57:01,369 --> 00:57:02,659
But talk is a talk.

610
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:12,899
Only at this stage you are prophets who are
talking about the Deities, and who are giving

611
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:18,619
Realisation, and who know the Abstract is
flowing through them.

612
00:57:18,619 --> 00:57:21,040
You are empowered to do that.

613
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,939
You know all about Deities, and you know all
about their mantras and you know how to awaken

614
00:57:24,939 --> 00:57:27,419
them and you know about yourself.

615
00:57:27,419 --> 00:57:29,040
You are all very great.

616
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,299
This may be the last puja now in London.

617
00:57:33,299 --> 00:57:46,339
As a great thing we are worshipping today
Guru Nanaka, that’s me [so] that – may

618
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:53,730
you become great Guru Nanakas.

619
00:57:53,730 --> 00:57:58,419
All of them were created by Adi Shakti.

620
00:57:58,419 --> 00:58:02,000
All these Gurus were created by her.

621
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:12,689
And today I say that you all become as great
as Guru Nanak, as great as Moses, as great

622
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:19,949
as Sai Nath, as great as Nanaka, Janaka, Mohammed.

623
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:25,590
All [of you] have to become as great as all
these great incarnations.

624
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:26,800
Just desire!

625
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,270
Have earnestness in you and alertness to achieve
it.

626
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:36,419
[Only] earnestness is not sufficient, you
have to be alert.

627
00:58:36,419 --> 00:58:43,189
I have already told you how to practice this
alertness.

628
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:44,299
Try to do it.

629
00:58:44,299 --> 00:58:49,641
I have told Hari certain things, you can ask
him, and I have told other people also, how

630
00:58:49,641 --> 00:58:55,530
to become alert, and how to change your little
habits here and there.

631
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:00,330
Anything overdoing should be stopped: taking
of too much tea, taking of too much milk,

632
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:01,760
eating too much, too much reading.

633
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,310
Anything like that, just try to moderate.

634
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:11,199
Moderation has to be brought in, and you will
be surprised [that] you can master your tongue,

635
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:12,869
you can master it.

636
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:21,199
May God bless you all, this day, in the name
of Nanaka I bless you all with that great

637
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:28,839
Spirit of Master, which you all should become
– the great prophets who are going to change

638
00:59:28,839 --> 00:59:38,540
all the men of God into prophets.

639
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:44,089
May God bless you!

640
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:48,909
Today the puja has to be in a different way
if you don’t mind.

641
00:59:48,909 --> 00:59:56,809
Gavin, first of all you do me any favour.

642
00:59:56,809 --> 01:00:07,649
I have to tell you that today I want to give
some presents to you all and accordingly I

643
01:00:07,649 --> 01:00:12,369
have brought some presents for you all.

644
01:00:12,369 --> 01:00:19,319
Because these are material things, but all
are used by me, all are vibrated, and very

645
01:00:19,319 --> 01:00:22,230
spontaneously we are going to choose them
all.

646
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:26,000
It was within two hours time we have done
some choosing.

647
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,770
But in this one has to understand that it’s
all done just to express the Dhanesh Shakti

648
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:36,470
of the Mother, just that She loves to give.

649
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:42,409
She loves to give.

650
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:47,899
Just out of joy that I had in Hampstead, I
felt I should now give you something.

651
01:00:47,899 --> 01:00:56,699
It’s beautiful there and that’s how we
have today tried to make some arrangement

652
01:00:56,699 --> 01:00:59,710
for that kind of a thing.

653
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:10,649
So just before the puja I wanted to announce
this and then we can have the puja – very

654
01:01:10,649 --> 01:01:18,720
simple one, because today is a day of simplicity
– complete surrendering.

655
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:33,740
Just imagine that these two colours are in
the Void, green and yellow, and if you mix

656
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,649
them what is the colour you get?

657
01:01:38,649 --> 01:01:40,360
Green and yellow?

658
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,629
You get the blue.

659
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:47,470
So the green is the Nature.

660
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:52,300
So an avadhuta has to become one with the
Nature.

661
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:58,929
This is the sign of the Surya nadi, the Sun.

662
01:01:58,929 --> 01:02:07,780
That means an avadhuta has to be brilliant
like the Sun, brilliant like the Sun, and

663
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:12,679
that detached as the Sun is.

664
01:02:12,679 --> 01:02:14,419
All the detachment must come into him.

665
01:02:14,419 --> 01:02:18,349
He need not have liver on Sun line.

666
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:22,810
He will not have liver if he knows what to
eat and what not to eat.

667
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:37,560
Normally all these gurus ate fruits, and they
ate meat, never fats and that’s how they

668
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,333
kept their liver alright.

669
01:02:39,536 --> 01:02:49,117
This is, these are the two combinations which
are there in the Void.

670
01:02:49,117 --> 01:02:53,867
And the combination of these two, when they
combine, it makes a blue.

671
01:02:53,867 --> 01:02:54,867
What is the blue?

672
01:02:54,867 --> 01:02:55,867
Is the water.

673
01:02:55,867 --> 01:02:57,466
So, in the water.

674
01:02:57,466 --> 01:03:03,006
Now see the Gurus are surrounding the Lakshmi
on the Nabhi.

675
01:03:03,006 --> 01:03:08,786
On the Nabhi is the Lakshmi is in the centre
and they are surrounding her.

676
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,796
They are her beauty.

677
01:03:10,796 --> 01:03:14,726
Without vairAgnya, without ascetic temperament,
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

678
01:03:14,726 --> 01:03:16,041
It has no meaning.

679
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:19,431
It is expressed in giving, is giving.

680
01:03:19,571 --> 01:03:26,111
That is what it means, that without vairAgnya
the Lakshmi has no meaning.

681
01:03:26,141 --> 01:03:31,011
Without the feeling of giving Lakshmi has
no meaning.

682
01:03:31,031 --> 01:03:35,100
Why should Lakshmi come to anyone if they
do not want to give?

683
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,483
And that is what one has to understand, is
the significance of giving.

684
01:03:40,553 --> 01:03:46,221
Now, today’s speciality is this, that: though
I am the Lakshmi – alright, I am the Mahalakshmi

685
01:03:46,221 --> 01:03:52,801
in everything – but I am also Vairagyi,
I am the detached.

686
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:56,140
The One who is Nirmama, is beyond.

687
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:59,430
Nobody can tie me, nobody can.

688
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,620
Nothing can bound me.

689
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:05,551
I just talk but it has no meaning, I am beyond.

690
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:09,451
In the same way, all of you should try to
be beyond.

691
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:16,780
So, from the Lakshmi angle I want to give
you something, because Lakshmi looks after

692
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:19,780
the saints, and the saints have to be detached.

693
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:24,610
That is the way it is going to work out.

694
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:32,220
I hope you won’t go back and wear kashayas,
the orange robes (laughter).

695
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:38,710
Discretion, discretion, has to mature.

696
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,170
It’s the maturity of discretion now.

697
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:48,560
So, now, for puja today, Chaya, let’s have
a very simple puja, whichever way you like.

698
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:51,090
Now, have you got Guru’s names?

699
01:04:55,244 --> 01:04:56,795
Just see it, their name.

700
01:04:56,795 --> 01:04:59,315
That I know, Graham.

701
01:05:17,818 --> 01:05:19,578
Guillemette: Guillemette.

702
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:21,938
Shri Mataji: Loudly.

703
01:05:21,988 --> 01:05:23,838
Guillemette: Guillemette.

704
01:05:24,408 --> 01:05:26,647
Gavin Brown: Guillemette.

705
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:30,728
Shri Mataji: How do you spell?

706
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:36,432
Gavin Brown: G-u-i-l-l-e-m-e-t-t-e.

707
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:39,782
Shri Mataji: What’s your name, please?

708
01:05:40,113 --> 01:05:41,973
Loudly.

709
01:05:41,953 --> 01:05:43,112
Brian: Brian

710
01:05:43,142 --> 01:05:46,132
Shri Mataji: Brian?

711
01:05:46,247 --> 01:05:47,712
Rachel: Rachel

712
01:05:47,768 --> 01:05:49,298
Shri Mataji: Rachel?

713
01:05:49,892 --> 01:05:51,642
Christopher: Christopher

714
01:05:51,696 --> 01:05:53,562
Shri Mataji: Christopher?

715
01:05:53,596 --> 01:05:55,162
Christopher: Nicolas

716
01:05:55,227 --> 01:05:56,751
Shri Mataji: Nicolas.

717
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:59,367
Shri Mataji: What’s your name please?

718
01:05:59,427 --> 01:06:04,107
Richard: Richard Mother.

719
01:06:04,157 --> 01:06:05,577
Bernard: Bernard

720
01:06:05,797 --> 01:06:07,366
Shri Mataji: Bernard.

721
01:06:07,457 --> 01:06:08,517
What’s your?

722
01:06:08,587 --> 01:06:12,318
Ian: Ian

723
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:17,789
Shri Mataji: Now who else is here?

724
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:19,670
Eileen?

725
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:21,079
I now here.

726
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:26,113
You haven’t washed my hands?

727
01:06:26,113 --> 01:06:27,273
No, Isodor has.

728
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:28,733
Alan you have?

729
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:29,983
Never?

730
01:06:29,983 --> 01:06:33,453
Imagine! (laughter) Alright.

731
01:06:33,453 --> 01:06:37,774
So let’s have the start.

732
01:06:56,888 --> 01:07:06,750
Gavin Brown: Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur
Devo Maheshwara, Guru Sakshat Parabrahma,

733
01:07:06,764 --> 01:07:10,160
Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma, Tasmai Guruve namaha.

734
01:07:10,344 --> 01:07:13,460
Shri Mataji: You all know the meaning of this?

735
01:07:13,558 --> 01:07:17,360
Gurur Brahma, Gurur Vishnu, Gurur Devo Maheshwara.

736
01:07:17,619 --> 01:07:31,889
The Guru is the creator, Guru is the protector,
and Guru is the existence and the destroyer.

737
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:45,829
Guru is the embodiment of the Parabrahma,
it’s the beyond state.

738
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:53,599
And to such a Guru we bow.

739
01:07:53,599 --> 01:08:07,788
Just a little you can take it on your fingers
you can dip it, you see, and put it on your

740
01:08:07,788 --> 01:08:08,788
forehead, maybe.

741
01:08:08,788 --> 01:08:10,089
It’s a water which is now [vibrated].

742
01:08:10,089 --> 01:08:11,089
Haa!

743
01:08:11,089 --> 01:08:13,599
You will feel better.

744
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:19,849
On the Sahasrara you can put it.

745
01:08:19,849 --> 01:08:26,548
Just sprinkle it all over you can.

746
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:29,418
Let him do.

747
01:08:29,418 --> 01:08:34,438
Sprinkle it all over.

748
01:08:50,955 --> 01:08:54,555
Who are these?

749
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:58,731
Maria is here.

750
01:08:58,776 --> 01:09:00,741
Yes.

751
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:03,511
Jaldi karo! (hindi: do it quickly)

752
01:09:03,571 --> 01:09:09,661
Five people together should come forward – alright?

753
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:10,910
Come along!

754
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:11,751
Five of you.

755
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:12,378
Yes.

756
01:09:12,487 --> 01:09:16,656
Come along!

757
01:09:43,921 --> 01:09:46,981
Get your finger into there and to my hand.

758
01:09:47,076 --> 01:09:51,065
Turn it like that, clockwise, with both the
hands.

759
01:09:51,065 --> 01:09:52,065
Alright.

760
01:09:52,065 --> 01:09:54,071
Now you rub your own hand.

761
01:09:54,131 --> 01:09:56,061
Now come along, you do it.

762
01:09:56,115 --> 01:09:58,065
Come along.

763
01:09:58,065 --> 01:10:00,024
Rub it.

764
01:10:00,024 --> 01:10:01,975
It’s good.
