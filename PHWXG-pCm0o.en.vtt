00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:44.639
… blessings to have such a nice place where
we all can meet and do the work of God. Sahaja

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:07.039
Yogis have to remember that we are here to
do God’s work and whatever blessings we

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:17.149
get, these are just guidelines to know that
God is creative.

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:25.379
I think the London Sahaja Yogis are real,
really blessed ones, really blessed ones.

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:32.579
The way they get one after another beautiful
places to live in. And, we all should be very,

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:40.079
very thankful for what God has been very kindly
suggested to us.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:49.379
I came here in the afternoon just to see the
place. As I looked at these trees and the

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:09.559
garden and the flowers – all of them are
here specially, very specially to tell you

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:25.199
that God is creative. We have to learn a lot
through them: how they grow, how they expose

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:41.719
themselves maximum to the rays of the sun,
how they suck their nourishment – all this

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:57.169
is a great training for all of us. They are
absolutely entirely surrendered to God and

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:10.659
to human beings who are the epitome of this
civilization. So, it’s such a big thing

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:22.690
that we have a place which is unbelievably
great and that we have to be very grateful.

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:35.409
Count your blessings, count your blessings.
There are still so many lost, so many who

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:46.839
are going to be lost, but you are in the right
path. This is sort of an advanced payment.

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.810
[laughter]

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:01.810
It’s so beautiful and so sweet but one has
to know, as I told you before, that we are

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.560
not going to stay in the ashram just to make
our life convenient and leisurely. That’s

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:21.560
not the way we should look at things. If you
have to live in the ashram, we have to discipline

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:30.750
ourselves. You have to better yourself, everyday
you have to rise. Certain rules and regulations

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:40.139
of the ashram must be observed. There should
be no idea of a democratic government where

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:48.849
everybody has a right to vote and can demand
what they want. On the contrary, it is the

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:57.409
great privilege that you are supposed to enjoy
the blessings. It’s a great advantage for

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:10.689
you that you are so fortunate to see these
things with your eyes open, that God exists

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:20.569
and He rewards. This understanding should
give you more and more courage and complete

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:38.740
willingness to improve yourself. This is the
most important thing. Sahaja Yoga is of course

00:07:39.849 --> 00:07:46.719
as you know is for your transformation and
an ashram is for your improvement. So, those

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:51.839
people who are going to stay here or those
who are going to visit here have to relatively

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:58.839
see how they are improving and growing. There
are many things which are going to come for

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:05.839
us. They look material but they have an atmosphere
of spirituality.

00:08:09.429 --> 00:08:13.469
Try to settle down with yourself. Don’t
quarrel [It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:20.429
name but can’t make it out] He wants you
to be comfortable. After a month you’ll

00:08:20.429 --> 00:08:24.960
get all the Sahaja Yogis who have to stay
here. We’ll sort it out and then they will

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.649
be allowed to stay here. Till then we have
to see what people are coming from abroad,

00:08:29.649 --> 00:08:36.579
they must also have proper places to live
in. At the most a month, some people would

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:43.579
like to stay here, but some of you will have
to be here to look after them, to give them

00:08:46.309 --> 00:08:53.309
all your help. Those who have car, who have
time, should come down here and start it out.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:09:02.550
We have to organize it on proper lines. There
are three Sahaja Yogis are coming across the

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:12.980
oceans, and one of them also to stay here.
Try to make their stay comfortable. They are

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:24.660
your brothers of great achievements, and we
have to respect them and look after them.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.600
I’m happy we have here from America another
great Sahaja Yogi. Try to help them. Whatever

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.870
they need, whatever they want to do, they
want to go out – make arrangements, make

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:51.870
it easy. If they want a car or anything, try
to help them.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:02.170
Secondly, you must keep it clean, look after
it. You have entered into another arena now,

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:12.470
on another level where your own comforts should
not be considered, it’s the comfort of others.

00:10:12.829 --> 00:10:18.520
Now, you are at a giving stage. So, what are
we going to give others, you have to see.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.920
Not what we are going to have “Oh this is
not good, there’s no hot water, there’s

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.920
this thing.” – all you forget, you will
not need anything.

00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:39.779
So many will be pouring down. Who else has
come for Guru Puja now? Apart from Herman.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.670
You have come from where?

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.959
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

00:10:45.959 --> 00:10:48.260
Oh I see, good.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:55.260
So, all those who are coming from anywhere
else, you see, have to stay. And those people

00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:04.890
who want to look after them, you can have
turns.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:09.730
Now today is the … what is the date today?

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:10.809
Yogi: Seventeenth.

00:11:10.809 --> 00:11:17.809
Shri Mataji: All right! Modi is coming on
the nineteenth, I believe. He’s coming on

00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:26.409
nineteenth. Anybody who is going to organize
here, food and all that … Michael? Who else

00:11:26.409 --> 00:11:27.250
with you?

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.770
Is David? Where is David?

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:35.770
There he is. All right! So, I’ll give you
a check of thousand pounds which you can cash.

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:48.589
Get all the ration and everything with some
girls here.

00:11:48.589 --> 00:11:54.089
I’m not going to pay. You have money in
the bank. Now, don’t get upset. I see some

00:11:54.089 --> 00:11:56.669
people frowning [laughter]

00:11:56.669 --> 00:12:03.669
I’m not going to pay anymore now. Finished!
All right. So, we have money in the bank and

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:14.209
that money has to come handy now. So, about
thousand pounds I would like to sanction.

00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:18.650
And, David you. Michael. Who else is here?

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:25.199
All right. That’s good. So four of you put
together, you decide what you want to buy.

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:30.669
And, some ladies you need here to help. Who
will be here?

00:12:30.669 --> 00:12:31.569
Kay?

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:38.569
Who else? Those who are free. You – two.
Who else?

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:47.829
All right for the time being. Two of you and
four of these boys. The rest of you should

00:12:57.089 --> 00:13:03.659
not shift here, should not stay here. But
once, you see, these people are over, finished

00:13:03.659 --> 00:13:08.880
with it, then you can shift here. We’ll
see that. For now, we have two ladies who

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:15.850
are willing to stay here and four gentlemen.
All right? At least till the Guru Puja it’ll

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:21.709
be quite busy, I think, lots of people will
be coming. So, some more ladies who can spare

00:13:21.709 --> 00:13:28.640
their time for these three-four days should
also raise their hands, I think, these three-four

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:35.640
days. All right? Who else?

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.110
What are you doing, Tanya?

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.360
Tanya: I’m working.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:47.270
Shri Mataji: You are working, won’t be free.
All right. So about, say, three ladies are

00:13:52.419 --> 00:13:54.600
there.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:01.600
So, three and four – seven people. Till
the Guru Puja, we can manage somehow and then

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:27.110
we’ll see what happens.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.029
Hello?

00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:38.029
It’s all right. It’s all right. [inaudible]
The children are [inaudible]

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:58.620
So, those who are already here … who are
those who are staying here?

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:06.959
You are staying here and who? John, you are
there – four of you. Four. Five. Five of

00:15:09.659 --> 00:15:16.659
you are here. Six? Six of you. Who is in Chelsham
Road now? What the girls are there? Michael

00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:26.589
you are not here?

00:15:26.589 --> 00:15:33.589
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

00:15:33.779 --> 00:15:40.779
No, I think you come along. Till the Guru
Puja, you see, you need here some people to

00:15:44.789 --> 00:15:51.079
really do the job. You may go to sleep there
if there’s no room, if there are too many

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:54.350
people. I think we can manage.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:16:01.350
Guru Puja is on the twenty-fourth only. So,
hardly there are three-four days. I mean,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:09.850
when will you go to Guru Puja? Evening? Friday
evening or Friday morning?

00:16:12.809 --> 00:16:14.919
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:21.919
Friday? Friday. So, you see, hardly anytime.
Today is what… let Me see… Monday, Tuesday…

00:16:25.429 --> 00:16:32.429
four-five days. All right. I may also shift
Myself. If the servants are here – no problem.

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.959
They will cook for Me.

00:16:38.959 --> 00:16:41.459
But what the gas is working here?

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:44.449
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

00:16:44.449 --> 00:16:51.449
Gas is not here. So, how do we cook?

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:58.919
[Yogi responds – gas has been disconnected
downstairs… - inaudible]

00:17:01.039 --> 00:17:01.659
Is it?

00:17:01.659 --> 00:17:05.150
[Yogi responds – yes, I’ve had a look
downstairs]

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:12.150
So, if you get the gas, then it’s very easy.
I can get the servants here. Then, I can shift

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:20.360
Myself in a way. All right?

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.710
If there are say, five people – you five
people and three ladies – they can cook

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:44.690
for you, no problem, all of you. But gas you
must have. Without gas they cannot manage.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.159
The water is running there? Hot and cold,
both?

00:17:48.159 --> 00:17:49.880
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:56.880
Just cold. So, how will you have hot water?
Is there an arrangement?

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.480
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:11.480
All right. So, gas connection if you can get
it tomorrow … is it possible?

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:19.450
Yogi: Yes, I can get the gas connected as
well as I can get the hot water running.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.770
Shri Mataji: Without that how will you manage,
I just can’t understand.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.169
Yogi: They’ll have to do it tomorrow night.

00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:34.960
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course! Is there an electric
cooker here?

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.130
Yogi: No. We only got one electric kettle
at the moment.

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:44.130
Shri Mataji: No, you have to have the gas.
Otherwise it won’t work out. If they connect

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:52.210
it tomorrow, the servants can come and start
cooking. In any case, I’ll ask them to shift

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:58.740
everything here, whatever is possible - vegetables
and ghee and all that. Plus, I’ll give you

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:03.250
money to buy rice perhaps we may need.

00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:10.250
So, about four people: gentlemen would be
five and ladies would be three. Five and three

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.990
– eight persons. All right.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:22.950
As soon as the gas is connected, they can
shift here. That’s the point is. Gas must

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:29.950
be connected. Otherwise, where will they cook?
You see, there’s no electrical cooker.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:37.330
Yogini: Mother, I’ve got a smaller electric
cooker – just two rings and smaller than

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.130
oven. Perhaps it would be a start.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.220
Shri Mataji: Start, we can!

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:54.220
Yogini: I’ve got it in the car actually.

00:19:56.179 --> 00:20:01.780
Shri Mataji: Is it? [laughter]

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:08.780
Yogini: Because, we drove it from London to
Brighton but we didn’t unload it and so,

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.809
we brought it all the way back but I couldn’t
understand why. [laughter]

00:20:13.809 --> 00:20:19.880
Shri Mataji: Now, what do you say to that,
[It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:25.340
name but can’t make it out]. I was wondering
how is she got the thing… [laughter]. So,

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:32.340
we don’t have to worry about anything whatsoever.
But still we’ll need gas thing, but for

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:38.780
the time being it’s good. All right, you
shift it here.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.190
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.840
So, better do something with the gas also.
All right? Because without the gas, so much

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.540
cooking cannot be done. Partly, as she said.
So, better unload the thing and put it down

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.220
there.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.970
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.710
Gas, on your own?

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:04.710
Yogi: It will be better if we had a gas man
there. [laughter]

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:13.250
Shri Mataji: You better go and tell them,
“if you don’t connect, we’ll connect

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:20.250
ourselves [laughter].” I tell you, so many
beautiful things happening. So, we have to

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:30.960
have that hot water started immediately as
soon as the gas. So, tomorrow morning what

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.980
time, John, you think you can do for the gas?

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:34.420
Yogi: nine o’clock

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:41.240
Shri Mataji: So, let him come here by nine
o’clock? Then, you go ahead with him, and

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:48.240
get the man and get it done. All right. Douglas,
I know you can manage. Douglas is really a

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:57.960
daring person. The way he has fought all the
TM bhoots, you see, they’re all literally

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:01.710
frightened of him. [laughter]

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:07.880
You must see today’s article in The Times.
Did you read? Horrible article. Did you see

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:14.080
the… My God! You must see that. He was very
upset - David Krall. He came down and showed

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.580
Me the article. It was horrible. They are
already trying to advertise it and do all

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.480
kinds of things and, there’s somebody whom
they have paid perhaps for writing. David

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.690
can tell you. David, have you got the article?

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:27.970
[Yogi responds.]

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:34.970
So, we are going to work on that. Horrible
article! He was very upset – David. [laughter]

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:44.870
All right, he is going to get the photocopy.
Give it to Gavin. Give it to Gavin. Hold it

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:57.700
with the prong. [laughter]

00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:11.490
So shameless and so fraudulent! It’s all
falsehood they are talking; absolute falsehood.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:17.840
So many people are levitating. Their guru
is levitating in the room. Everybody is levitating

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.600
there, you see. All falsehood, they can disappear
in thin air.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:29.600
Yogi: It’s all Your work, mother. [Everyone
bursts into laughter]

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:37.140
And, seventeen thousand people are following…
seventeen million or something.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.130
Yogis: Three hundred million.

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:46.130
Shri Mataji: Three hundred million. All false.
All, I tell you, all falsehood. But, I tell

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:53.620
you, these media people don’t understand
what they are up to. One has to write something

00:23:55.030 --> 00:24:02.030
to them that this all is false. Very disastrous!
Horrible!

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:11.840
Yogi: Media is skeptical of it … enlightenment,
world peace. They had to have metal detector

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.860
when they went to their head quarter. [inaudible]

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.780
Shri Mataji: We have our own detector.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:22.840
Yogi: Yes.

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:29.840
Shri Mataji: Isn’t it? With our detector
we found that you are devils.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:36.960
So, once we have this then it all came so
fast. Isn’t it? Doesn’t matter. So, you

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.299
arrange the first floor and the second floor
for all the people who want to come. You keep

00:24:49.299 --> 00:24:56.299
the first floor for the ladies and the second
for the men. All right? Not the other way

00:24:57.559 --> 00:25:03.600
round. Because there would be many who would
be married with children. But most of them

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:09.380
will be in Brighton – directly going to
that. But Jason, have you been able to receive

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:14.940
their information about when they are coming,
how they are going, what place they want,

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.010
how they want to be allotted?

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:22.700
Jason: Some of them, Mother, yes. We have
the French people, most of them arriving on

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:29.700
Saturday while some going directly to the
place on Friday. The Swiss people are arriving

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:37.559
about 3 o’clock Friday afternoon. I think
also, the Italians are coming about that time.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.480
Phil Ward is in charge of organizing shuttle
and cars to bring them from the station to

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:51.480
the seminar. The Swiss people and probably
the Italians also would like to stay here

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:59.370
Sunday night because their flight goes on
Monday.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.750
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s [inaudible]. Also,
you will be surprised that this is on your

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:09.380
way to Brighton. So, even if they are coming
earlier you can give this address to them

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:14.990
so that they can come here first. And, from
here you can take some sort of a bus or something

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.240
to take all of them together.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.760
Jason: Yes, Mother. There’s a green bus
that goes from Heathrow Airport to Gatwick

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:28.760
Airport that goes almost right pass the door…
[inaudible]

00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:40.919
Shri Mataji: But why not make one place for
them to meet first of all? Some of them are

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:53.720
coming from the back doors also or what? Are
they coming from the Brighton side?

00:26:53.720 --> 00:27:00.720
Jason: Yes, Mother. Some of them. [Inaudible]

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:07.960
Shri Mataji: But if they are
coming on a Sunday here or something, why
not they come here?

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.080
Jason: That will be after the Puja. [Inaudible]

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.809
Shri Mataji: So how many will be here actually?

00:27:30.809 --> 00:27:36.150
Jason: On Sunday night, probably about fifty
or so.

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.080
Shri Mataji: Fifty here?

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.919
Jason: Just for the Sunday night but maybe
there will be others ….[Inaudible]

00:27:40.919 --> 00:27:46.910
Shri Mataji: All right. So, for Friday how
many will be here?

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.790
Jason: Not sure… [Inaudible]

00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:58.790
[Shri Mataji greets someone on the side]

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:06.270
Yogi: Three Italians are coming on Thursday
night.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.840
Shri Mataji: Thursday night?

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.230
Yogi: And Friday morning seven o’clock is
arriving a group with …

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.530
Shri Mataji: Friday morning?

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:20.720
Yogi: Friday morning. And they want to stay
in the Ashram. I’ll bring them here.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.040
Shri Mataji: All right. So, keep it Thursday.
Say so from … it’s going to be on. But

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.410
I mean gas has to be there. As soon as gas
is there I can shift here. No problem. But

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:37.410
gas has to be here. I’ll bring the servants
also with Me.

00:28:38.429 --> 00:28:43.760
But after the Puja, after the thing Sunday
we should find out exactly how many people

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:47.500
are coming here, because Sunday night food
can be cooked here for them. Isn’t it? And,

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.160
they go on Monday morning?

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:58.160
Shri Mataji: That’s it. So, we can arrange
that also. It could be arranged very clearly.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:07.470
Nick, you have got this van till tomorrow?

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:19.530
Nick: Yes, Mother. I should be able to extend
it. [Inaudible]

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:24.970
Shri Mataji: All right. So tomorrow, why don’t
you send the van to Me?

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:25.440
Nick: Yes, Mother.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.980
Shri Mataji: All right. Then, we’ll extend
it. I’ll pay for the extension.

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.000
Nick : There’s no need for that, Mother.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.840
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. One day, I’ll pay
for it. All right? So, you send the van tomorrow

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:42.840
to Me and then extend it. Hmm? Yes, tomorrow
if you send Me the van, I can send Debbie,

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:48.870
and if the gas is fixed, they can start cooking
here. Even for… I mean you can cook for

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:53.549
few people on that but ten people I don’t
know.

00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:55.799
Yogini responds [Inaudble]

00:29:55.799 --> 00:30:02.799
Shri Mataji: Best is to have

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:42.700
the gas, you see.

00:30:57.419 --> 00:31:04.419
He has given birth. Hello! He has given birth.
I mean not he. [laughter] His wife has given

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:56.440
birth to a baby boy and you know they had
very bad time with the twins that they had.

00:31:56.559 --> 00:32:02.590
It’s horrible. Tenants had an effect on
the baby and the thing was delayed by about

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:09.590
one week but the baby is very healthy – nine
pound something and I have given him the name

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:16.970
Janak - Janaka. I hope you are happy with
the name. He’s a very sweet baby. All right.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:26.750
Now, those who are coming from outside like
... are you come from Northampton, Southampton?

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:35.520
Who else? All of you. Where are you staying
now? Where are you staying tonight? You’ll

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:47.690
go back? You won’t come here? I mean, you
are not going to stay till Guru Puja? You

00:32:51.679 --> 00:32:53.549
want to stay here?

00:32:53.549 --> 00:32:58.110
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:05.110
All right. All right, you’ll go back to
Southampton and then you will come. So, how

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:17.220
are you? How is your wife? Same? So, she is
here or in Spain?

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.429
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:33:26.429 --> 00:33:33.410
She is in Cambridge. How is the baby? He’ll
come round.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:40.410
Boghdan, how are you? How is your wife?

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:58.820
So, for you four-five people who are staying
here after getting the gas, you see – after

00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:06.900
getting the gas, again I say, you come and
see Me tomorrow. Someone having any problem

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:13.900
over here you better stay with Me for the
time being till we get gas. What about his

00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:23.589
food? Let him in Chelsham Road, I think till
then. If we get the gas tomorrow then there’s

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:29.520
no problem, you see. Then we will call you
from Chelsham Road. All right? Let him be

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.690
there at Chelsham Road. Who’s at Chelsham
Road now?

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:36.359
All right, Graham [We are not sure if Shri
Mataji says Graham or not] you are organizing

00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:43.359
there. So, look after him. And, if we get
the gas tomorrow then he can shift here. All

00:34:48.490 --> 00:34:50.049
right?

00:34:50.049 --> 00:34:57.049
How are you? All right? You wrote a very nice
letter to that man, that newspaper fellow.

00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:13.309
Horrible. Just imagine I never even asked
anybody to take out the coat or anything.

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:20.450
In general way I said you take out your coats.
They have objection even for that. Can you

00:35:21.569 --> 00:35:28.569
meditate with your raincoat on you? Absurd,
I tell you! How can these newspaper people

00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:36.069
be so stupid to write all that? I can’t
understand.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:43.940
Yogini; Mother, sorry to interrupt You. There’s
been a very funny new development, because

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:56.690
this horrible man’s name has appeared in
the newspaper again. In Brighton, this horrible

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:05.420
nudist beach which makes us so sick, we heard
some very good news. By Your Grace, they want

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.200
to take away the nudist beach.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:15.289
Shri Mataji: Nudist?

00:36:15.289 --> 00:36:22.289
Yogini: The horrible naked beach they want
to take away. But, the man who would not take

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:38.970
off his shoes before You, has written to the
newspaper saying “Nudist beach is very good,

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:51.430
everyone should take out all their clothes.”

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:58.430
Shri Mataji: Except for the raincoat! Look
at this stupidity! [laughter] Now, what do

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.319
you say to these real stupid people, you know.

00:37:04.319 --> 00:37:08.549
Why not write a strong letter to editor of
this?

00:37:08.549 --> 00:37:10.259
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:37:10.259 --> 00:37:17.259
Why do they give him so much importance? Who
is he? He is the Managing Director of what

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:21.700
company? Better…

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.420
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:30.420
Better write to them. All of you should do
it. Stupid fellow! Stupid people live here,

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:47.390
I tell you. What were you saying? John was
telling Me something about you.

00:37:50.019 --> 00:37:57.019
Yes, you communicated something to John? John,
didn’t you say?

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:04.369
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:05.839
Paste?

00:38:05.839 --> 00:38:10.269
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:38:10.269 --> 00:38:16.430
That is sandalwood paste to be made with a
stone, that one. John, you know what he told

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:23.430
Me he wants to know the name of the stone
that is to sit on his head. [laughter]

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:28.049
I said, “Stone!” I mean I’m quite strange
but not to that extent. [laughter]

00:38:28.049 --> 00:38:35.049
I couldn’t understand. I’m sorry for that.
All right, this is the stone I was saying

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:41.989
or any stone like this, anyone which you can
rub. This is the thing – chandan, you can

00:38:41.989 --> 00:38:44.430
put it. [Shri Mataji talks in the side]

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:51.430
All right. So, with just this thing I said,that
on the stone is I’m rubbing it. Show him

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.430
that, Gavin.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:13.430
Because of the heat, you see. Chandan is the
best for heat. If you get blisters due to

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:31.039
heat or anything – just rub this and put
it on the thing – very good. Have you heard

00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:42.979
of any famous astrologer called M. K. Gandhi,
anyone of you?

00:39:42.979 --> 00:39:45.680
Yogi: Yes.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:52.680
Shri Mataji: Have you? I’ve never heard.

00:39:55.119 --> 00:40:02.119
Yogi: I’m sure I’ve seen his advertisements.

00:40:04.559 --> 00:40:11.559
Shri Mataji: He’s telling others good things
about Me.

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:21.390
That’s Athena. Athena, now, what’s happening?
Now, slowly. What happened? One chana. I only

00:40:30.609 --> 00:40:37.609
had three of them just now. All right, how
many do you want? As soon as I eat the chana,

00:40:40.349 --> 00:40:47.269
the Ganas are standing there. [laughter]

00:40:47.269 --> 00:40:54.269
The Ganas are waiting to have some. That’s
their share. All right.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:11.920
Now, we will have the puja and then we will
have more chana. All right, sit down. It’s

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:52.769
all right.

00:41:56.859 --> 00:42:03.859
[Yogi says something – inaudible]

00:42:19.029 --> 00:42:21.519
Have you read the letter of Patrick?

00:42:21.519 --> 00:42:28.519
What can I say? Very uncertain. Only good
news is that one Mr. Marwah who was going

00:42:41.519 --> 00:42:48.519
to do all our publicity work has been elected
as the Mayor, Mayor of Los Angeles. That’s

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:57.930
a very big news and this may do something
good, I think. So, first I’m going to do

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:03.329
all this in Los Angeles. Actually, I’ll
go to New York only to meet the Sahaja Yogis

00:43:03.329 --> 00:43:10.099
there. And, then I will… as the program
is… you know the program, everything…

00:43:10.099 --> 00:43:16.819
I’m happy you could come because they are
really worried about American tour. How they

00:43:16.819 --> 00:43:23.819
will take it, whether it will be successful
or not? It will be!

00:43:25.219 --> 00:43:32.219
Lets look at these nice Yogis people… just
look at them. Not worse person has seen them

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:43.170
levited. But they are telling all lies, you
see. “There is very much better coordination

00:43:45.959 --> 00:43:52.890
of the body and the mind.” Can you believe
such a false story?

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:59.890
So, I told him that you should meet this Dr.
Fredick or what was his name? Fredick? Ah,

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:05.359
Frenny. You go and see him. Show him this
article. You should say that we all want to

00:44:05.359 --> 00:44:11.219
protest. He himself will be very happy. That
this is how he is going to cheat us, he is

00:44:11.219 --> 00:44:17.119
fraudulent. And, why not we all put together?
Write a letter to the editor that, “You

00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:24.119
have no business to publicize such a person
who has ruined the lives of so many.”

00:44:24.969 --> 00:44:31.969
Have you got that article of Madhu Dave…
Madhu Jain?

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.150
[Yogi response inaudible.]

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:46.150
Activities in India… six thousand crores,
ah? And, what David Praul told Me is this

00:44:51.089 --> 00:44:56.910
that so much has been written against him
but there is no mention of it. So, you take

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:03.759
David Praul, you and Frenny and all these
people put together. Make a very strong letter

00:45:03.759 --> 00:45:10.140
about it and let Dr. Frenny put it in. And
say, there are people here who can really…

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:17.140
thousands of people who can say what I’m
saying. Get hold of him.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:30.200
The doctor friend of Rustom, did you contact
him? John, did you give him the address of

00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:37.519
the doctor? Did you tell them about it? I
think Pamela was there. Pamela?

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.309
[Pamela response inaudible]

00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:48.309
What about that doctor? Did you tell him that
he should come for the Puja? Then what did

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.039
he say?

00:45:51.039 --> 00:45:53.160
[Pamela response inaudible]

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.979
What did he say?

00:45:55.979 --> 00:45:58.089
[Pamela response inaudible]

00:45:58.089 --> 00:46:05.089
Hmm… See, all such like that Di, Lady Di
or whoever she is… how is she now?

00:46:09.959 --> 00:46:15.660
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:22.059
So, why not take her help also in writing.
Now, you see, Warren is coming, all these

00:46:22.059 --> 00:46:27.549
people are coming – you can all put facts
together. See this Dr. Frenny – all of you.

00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:32.309
And, tell him what he’s doing and what sort
of trouble he has given to others and how

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:38.140
he has taken the money. You go and tell him
very strongly. You, especially, we have to

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:43.930
save others now. It’s very important. Another
thing he says that Atlanta someplace somewhere

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:48.479
has all people have become very peaceful.
Naturally, if you make somebody into a cabbage

00:46:48.479 --> 00:46:55.479
they will be. But the majority of the people,
I mean the greater percentage of the people

00:46:57.469 --> 00:47:04.469
who are in Ireland and who are in Israel have
become much more violent. One percent in Ireland

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:19.029
and three percent in Israel. And, you see,
how they are behaving. So, this Atlanta we

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:26.930
cannot find out but what about these two places?

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:31.549
This Madhu… if you get his thing you can
write down. He says that wherever his ashrams

00:47:31.549 --> 00:47:38.549
are nothing grows. Even the cows become barren.
Or you can ask Murray how it was published.

00:47:51.329 --> 00:47:55.219
It was sent to us, I think.

00:47:55.219 --> 00:47:59.329
Yogi: Murray has that?

00:47:59.329 --> 00:48:06.329
Shri Mataji: Murray has that so ask Murray
to help you there. All right? Now, one thing

00:48:08.259 --> 00:48:15.259
you can catch on him which you can play about
to say that he is anti-Christ. Whatever he

00:48:17.309 --> 00:48:23.680
preaches is anti-Christ. Because he leads
a life of licentiousness? himself and you

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.969
can give the example of Linda’s things that
was written. She has written it down. Then

00:48:27.969 --> 00:48:33.150
he himself is making money out of us and has
got all the material things of the world at

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:40.150
the cost of his disciples. He is an anti-Christ
and there is no relationship of his work with

00:48:46.049 --> 00:48:52.890
Christ, first of all. And, secondly you can
also put Karpur Gaurav and all that are actually

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:56.019
the worship of I think Shiva or something.

00:48:56.019 --> 00:49:03.019
[Shri Mataji asks someone in Hindi is the
Karpur Gaurav mantra is for Shivji or not.]

00:49:21.279 --> 00:49:28.279
It is the Shiva’s worship. So, what they
tell them is the idol worship of Shiva – put

00:49:30.119 --> 00:49:37.119
it down. But because they don’t know any
Sanskrit they go on saying. All right? Modi

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:44.410
will be coming, he will give you the complete
shloka. It’s Shiva’s worship. So, that

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:47.430
will go in the Christian mind here.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:54.430
Then, another good news is: Rustom has said
that in the Koran there is a description of

00:49:58.819 --> 00:50:05.289
Kundalini. They call it Assas and that at
the resurrection time, the Kundalini will

00:50:05.289 --> 00:50:11.339
be awakened by Mahdi. It’s all there. So
many things in the Koran, he was saying that

00:50:11.339 --> 00:50:18.339
there are seven heavens, firmaments, through
which human beings has to pass, one has to

00:50:19.569 --> 00:50:21.329
ascend through this.

00:50:21.329 --> 00:50:26.680
But I was reading a book given to Me by one
of the Sahaja Yogis in Brighton. It’s very

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:33.680
clearly said in that there are angels of the
Mother and angels of the heavens and then

00:50:38.819 --> 00:50:45.819
seven of them and seven of these and everything.
And, according to My calculation it is describing

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:54.410
Monday as the sabbath - Monday. Because as
you go you see, the Creator is on the third

00:50:55.569 --> 00:51:01.999
day or second day. It should be on the third
day. It’s the second day. First is the angel

00:51:01.999 --> 00:51:08.999
of the joy. And, that is Shiva. So, it is
Monday. Like that. Very clearly. And it is

00:51:09.219 --> 00:51:13.239
all written down, it’s preserved, and they
have just taken it out and translated. Can

00:51:13.239 --> 00:51:18.089
you imagine? We have got now the scriptures
to go with. Those books are with Me – two

00:51:18.089 --> 00:51:23.609
of them. Can you get those books for Me, from
some shop?

00:51:23.609 --> 00:51:30.609
Who game Me that book? You gave Me, yes!

00:51:31.239 --> 00:51:33.789
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:37.180
Only through your University?

00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.729
[Yogi response inaudible]

00:51:39.729 --> 00:51:46.729
You can? So, can you, two-three people buy
that and go through it. And, you’ll be amazed.

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:55.170
I mean, that’s the real Bible, you can say,
about Christ. Even the Bible, which is written

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:05.400
now about the ten commandments, everything
this is related. Because that’s the original

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:12.400
one they found Out. Can you imagine? And,
these laws that were written in Bible at the

00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:22.789
time of Moses, which are called Shariat in
the Islamic religion, are because the people

00:52:22.809 --> 00:52:29.719
had become so bad, so bad that they had to
put such terrible, strict laws that anybody

00:52:29.719 --> 00:52:35.900
does that must be cut – his throat must
be cut, his hands must be cut, legs must be

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:41.969
cut. All this is only because of these things
happening in those days. The people were so

00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:46.190
bad, so much on the decline that they had
to change all that and they started this.

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:53.190
This is very clearly written there. Better
get those two books and prepare it in that

00:52:54.459 --> 00:52:59.219
line. It will be good idea.

00:52:59.219 --> 00:53:06.219
All right. You want to wash My feet? This
water – you can wash My feet. You go around

00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:15.089
and put everywhere here. Shining these days
a bit too much. You see, when we went to Malmo,

00:53:37.479 --> 00:53:44.479
I said seven mantras for the sun and the sun
came out. And since that day it’s beautiful.

00:56:32.209 --> 00:56:39.209
All right.

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:50.410
Can you

00:58:26.849 --> 00:58:33.849
wash My feet?

00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:03.630
[Talk in

01:02:20.439 --> 01:02:27.439
this CD seems

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:38.550
to

01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:01.920
start mid-sentence.]
