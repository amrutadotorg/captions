WEBVTT

02:37.639 --> 02:44.639
… blessings to have such a nice place where
we all can meet and do the work of God. Sahaja

03:00.039 --> 03:07.039
Yogis have to remember that we are here to
do God’s work and whatever blessings we

03:10.149 --> 03:17.149
get, these are just guidelines to know that
God is creative.

03:18.379 --> 03:25.379
I think the London Sahaja Yogis are real,
really blessed ones, really blessed ones.

03:25.579 --> 03:32.579
The way they get one after another beautiful
places to live in. And, we all should be very,

03:33.079 --> 03:40.079
very thankful for what God has been very kindly
suggested to us.

03:42.379 --> 03:49.379
I came here in the afternoon just to see the
place. As I looked at these trees and the

04:02.559 --> 04:09.559
garden and the flowers – all of them are
here specially, very specially to tell you

04:18.199 --> 04:25.199
that God is creative. We have to learn a lot
through them: how they grow, how they expose

04:34.719 --> 04:41.719
themselves maximum to the rays of the sun,
how they suck their nourishment – all this

04:50.169 --> 04:57.169
is a great training for all of us. They are
absolutely entirely surrendered to God and

05:03.659 --> 05:10.659
to human beings who are the epitome of this
civilization. So, it’s such a big thing

05:15.690 --> 05:22.690
that we have a place which is unbelievably
great and that we have to be very grateful.

05:28.409 --> 05:35.409
Count your blessings, count your blessings.
There are still so many lost, so many who

05:39.839 --> 05:46.839
are going to be lost, but you are in the right
path. This is sort of an advanced payment.

05:52.339 --> 05:54.810
[laughter]

05:54.810 --> 06:01.810
It’s so beautiful and so sweet but one has
to know, as I told you before, that we are

06:08.889 --> 06:14.560
not going to stay in the ashram just to make
our life convenient and leisurely. That’s

06:14.560 --> 06:21.560
not the way we should look at things. If you
have to live in the ashram, we have to discipline

06:23.750 --> 06:30.750
ourselves. You have to better yourself, everyday
you have to rise. Certain rules and regulations

06:33.139 --> 06:40.139
of the ashram must be observed. There should
be no idea of a democratic government where

06:41.849 --> 06:48.849
everybody has a right to vote and can demand
what they want. On the contrary, it is the

06:50.409 --> 06:57.409
great privilege that you are supposed to enjoy
the blessings. It’s a great advantage for

07:03.689 --> 07:10.689
you that you are so fortunate to see these
things with your eyes open, that God exists

07:13.569 --> 07:20.569
and He rewards. This understanding should
give you more and more courage and complete

07:31.740 --> 07:38.740
willingness to improve yourself. This is the
most important thing. Sahaja Yoga is of course

07:39.849 --> 07:46.719
as you know is for your transformation and
an ashram is for your improvement. So, those

07:46.719 --> 07:51.839
people who are going to stay here or those
who are going to visit here have to relatively

07:51.839 --> 07:58.839
see how they are improving and growing. There
are many things which are going to come for

07:58.839 --> 08:05.839
us. They look material but they have an atmosphere
of spirituality.

08:09.429 --> 08:13.469
Try to settle down with yourself. Don’t
quarrel [It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

08:13.469 --> 08:20.429
name but can’t make it out] He wants you
to be comfortable. After a month you’ll

08:20.429 --> 08:24.960
get all the Sahaja Yogis who have to stay
here. We’ll sort it out and then they will

08:24.960 --> 08:29.649
be allowed to stay here. Till then we have
to see what people are coming from abroad,

08:29.649 --> 08:36.579
they must also have proper places to live
in. At the most a month, some people would

08:36.579 --> 08:43.579
like to stay here, but some of you will have
to be here to look after them, to give them

08:46.309 --> 08:53.309
all your help. Those who have car, who have
time, should come down here and start it out.

08:55.550 --> 09:02.550
We have to organize it on proper lines. There
are three Sahaja Yogis are coming across the

09:05.980 --> 09:12.980
oceans, and one of them also to stay here.
Try to make their stay comfortable. They are

09:17.660 --> 09:24.660
your brothers of great achievements, and we
have to respect them and look after them.

09:25.600 --> 09:32.600
I’m happy we have here from America another
great Sahaja Yogi. Try to help them. Whatever

09:38.800 --> 09:44.870
they need, whatever they want to do, they
want to go out – make arrangements, make

09:44.870 --> 09:51.870
it easy. If they want a car or anything, try
to help them.

09:55.170 --> 10:02.170
Secondly, you must keep it clean, look after
it. You have entered into another arena now,

10:05.470 --> 10:12.470
on another level where your own comforts should
not be considered, it’s the comfort of others.

10:12.829 --> 10:18.520
Now, you are at a giving stage. So, what are
we going to give others, you have to see.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.920
Not what we are going to have “Oh this is
not good, there’s no hot water, there’s

10:21.920 --> 10:28.920
this thing.” – all you forget, you will
not need anything.

10:32.779 --> 10:39.779
So many will be pouring down. Who else has
come for Guru Puja now? Apart from Herman.

10:40.860 --> 10:43.670
You have come from where?

10:43.670 --> 10:45.959
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

10:45.959 --> 10:48.260
Oh I see, good.

10:48.260 --> 10:55.260
So, all those who are coming from anywhere
else, you see, have to stay. And those people

10:59.809 --> 11:04.890
who want to look after them, you can have
turns.

11:04.890 --> 11:09.730
Now today is the … what is the date today?

11:09.730 --> 11:10.809
Yogi: Seventeenth.

11:10.809 --> 11:17.809
Shri Mataji: All right! Modi is coming on
the nineteenth, I believe. He’s coming on

11:20.409 --> 11:26.409
nineteenth. Anybody who is going to organize
here, food and all that … Michael? Who else

11:26.409 --> 11:27.250
with you?

11:27.250 --> 11:28.770
Is David? Where is David?

11:28.770 --> 11:35.770
There he is. All right! So, I’ll give you
a check of thousand pounds which you can cash.

11:41.750 --> 11:48.589
Get all the ration and everything with some
girls here.

11:48.589 --> 11:54.089
I’m not going to pay. You have money in
the bank. Now, don’t get upset. I see some

11:54.089 --> 11:56.669
people frowning [laughter]

11:56.669 --> 12:03.669
I’m not going to pay anymore now. Finished!
All right. So, we have money in the bank and

12:08.360 --> 12:14.209
that money has to come handy now. So, about
thousand pounds I would like to sanction.

12:14.209 --> 12:18.650
And, David you. Michael. Who else is here?

12:18.650 --> 12:25.199
All right. That’s good. So four of you put
together, you decide what you want to buy.

12:25.199 --> 12:30.669
And, some ladies you need here to help. Who
will be here?

12:30.669 --> 12:31.569
Kay?

12:31.569 --> 12:38.569
Who else? Those who are free. You – two.
Who else?

12:40.829 --> 12:47.829
All right for the time being. Two of you and
four of these boys. The rest of you should

12:57.089 --> 13:03.659
not shift here, should not stay here. But
once, you see, these people are over, finished

13:03.659 --> 13:08.880
with it, then you can shift here. We’ll
see that. For now, we have two ladies who

13:08.880 --> 13:15.850
are willing to stay here and four gentlemen.
All right? At least till the Guru Puja it’ll

13:15.850 --> 13:21.709
be quite busy, I think, lots of people will
be coming. So, some more ladies who can spare

13:21.709 --> 13:28.640
their time for these three-four days should
also raise their hands, I think, these three-four

13:28.640 --> 13:35.640
days. All right? Who else?

13:39.860 --> 13:40.110
What are you doing, Tanya?

13:40.110 --> 13:40.360
Tanya: I’m working.

13:40.270 --> 13:47.270
Shri Mataji: You are working, won’t be free.
All right. So about, say, three ladies are

13:52.419 --> 13:54.600
there.

13:54.600 --> 14:01.600
So, three and four – seven people. Till
the Guru Puja, we can manage somehow and then

14:20.110 --> 14:27.110
we’ll see what happens.

14:28.850 --> 14:31.029
Hello?

14:31.029 --> 14:38.029
It’s all right. It’s all right. [inaudible]
The children are [inaudible]

14:51.620 --> 14:58.620
So, those who are already here … who are
those who are staying here?

14:59.959 --> 15:06.959
You are staying here and who? John, you are
there – four of you. Four. Five. Five of

15:09.659 --> 15:16.659
you are here. Six? Six of you. Who is in Chelsham
Road now? What the girls are there? Michael

15:23.919 --> 15:26.589
you are not here?

15:26.589 --> 15:33.589
[A yogi speaks – inaudible]

15:33.779 --> 15:40.779
No, I think you come along. Till the Guru
Puja, you see, you need here some people to

15:44.789 --> 15:51.079
really do the job. You may go to sleep there
if there’s no room, if there are too many

15:51.079 --> 15:54.350
people. I think we can manage.

15:54.350 --> 16:01.350
Guru Puja is on the twenty-fourth only. So,
hardly there are three-four days. I mean,

16:02.850 --> 16:09.850
when will you go to Guru Puja? Evening? Friday
evening or Friday morning?

16:12.809 --> 16:14.919
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

16:14.919 --> 16:21.919
Friday? Friday. So, you see, hardly anytime.
Today is what… let Me see… Monday, Tuesday…

16:25.429 --> 16:32.429
four-five days. All right. I may also shift
Myself. If the servants are here – no problem.

16:36.630 --> 16:38.959
They will cook for Me.

16:38.959 --> 16:41.459
But what the gas is working here?

16:41.459 --> 16:44.449
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

16:44.449 --> 16:51.449
Gas is not here. So, how do we cook?

16:51.919 --> 16:58.919
[Yogi responds – gas has been disconnected
downstairs… - inaudible]

17:01.039 --> 17:01.659
Is it?

17:01.659 --> 17:05.150
[Yogi responds – yes, I’ve had a look
downstairs]

17:05.150 --> 17:12.150
So, if you get the gas, then it’s very easy.
I can get the servants here. Then, I can shift

17:13.360 --> 17:20.360
Myself in a way. All right?

17:34.840 --> 17:39.710
If there are say, five people – you five
people and three ladies – they can cook

17:39.710 --> 17:44.690
for you, no problem, all of you. But gas you
must have. Without gas they cannot manage.

17:44.690 --> 17:48.159
The water is running there? Hot and cold,
both?

17:48.159 --> 17:49.880
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

17:49.880 --> 17:56.880
Just cold. So, how will you have hot water?
Is there an arrangement?

18:00.600 --> 18:04.480
[Yogi responds - inaudible]

18:04.480 --> 18:11.480
All right. So, gas connection if you can get
it tomorrow … is it possible?

18:12.450 --> 18:19.450
Yogi: Yes, I can get the gas connected as
well as I can get the hot water running.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.770
Shri Mataji: Without that how will you manage,
I just can’t understand.

18:26.770 --> 18:30.169
Yogi: They’ll have to do it tomorrow night.

18:30.169 --> 18:34.960
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course! Is there an electric
cooker here?

18:34.960 --> 18:37.130
Yogi: No. We only got one electric kettle
at the moment.

18:37.130 --> 18:44.130
Shri Mataji: No, you have to have the gas.
Otherwise it won’t work out. If they connect

18:46.850 --> 18:52.210
it tomorrow, the servants can come and start
cooking. In any case, I’ll ask them to shift

18:52.210 --> 18:58.740
everything here, whatever is possible - vegetables
and ghee and all that. Plus, I’ll give you

18:58.740 --> 19:03.250
money to buy rice perhaps we may need.

19:03.250 --> 19:10.250
So, about four people: gentlemen would be
five and ladies would be three. Five and three

19:13.500 --> 19:17.990
– eight persons. All right.

19:17.990 --> 19:22.950
As soon as the gas is connected, they can
shift here. That’s the point is. Gas must

19:22.950 --> 19:29.950
be connected. Otherwise, where will they cook?
You see, there’s no electrical cooker.

19:30.330 --> 19:37.330
Yogini: Mother, I’ve got a smaller electric
cooker – just two rings and smaller than

19:40.990 --> 19:45.130
oven. Perhaps it would be a start.

19:45.130 --> 19:47.220
Shri Mataji: Start, we can!

19:47.220 --> 19:54.220
Yogini: I’ve got it in the car actually.

19:56.179 --> 20:01.780
Shri Mataji: Is it? [laughter]

20:01.780 --> 20:08.780
Yogini: Because, we drove it from London to
Brighton but we didn’t unload it and so,

20:10.160 --> 20:13.809
we brought it all the way back but I couldn’t
understand why. [laughter]

20:13.809 --> 20:19.880
Shri Mataji: Now, what do you say to that,
[It seems that Shri Mataji says someone’s

20:19.880 --> 20:25.340
name but can’t make it out]. I was wondering
how is she got the thing… [laughter]. So,

20:25.340 --> 20:32.340
we don’t have to worry about anything whatsoever.
But still we’ll need gas thing, but for

20:32.780 --> 20:38.780
the time being it’s good. All right, you
shift it here.

20:38.780 --> 20:41.190
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

20:41.190 --> 20:45.840
So, better do something with the gas also.
All right? Because without the gas, so much

20:45.840 --> 20:51.540
cooking cannot be done. Partly, as she said.
So, better unload the thing and put it down

20:51.540 --> 20:52.220
there.

20:52.220 --> 20:54.970
[Yogi says something – inaudible.]

20:54.970 --> 20:57.710
Gas, on your own?

20:57.710 --> 21:04.710
Yogi: It will be better if we had a gas man
there. [laughter]

21:07.210 --> 21:13.250
Shri Mataji: You better go and tell them,
“if you don’t connect, we’ll connect

21:13.250 --> 21:20.250
ourselves [laughter].” I tell you, so many
beautiful things happening. So, we have to

21:24.660 --> 21:30.960
have that hot water started immediately as
soon as the gas. So, tomorrow morning what

21:30.960 --> 21:32.980
time, John, you think you can do for the gas?

21:32.980 --> 21:34.420
Yogi: nine o’clock

21:34.420 --> 21:41.240
Shri Mataji: So, let him come here by nine
o’clock? Then, you go ahead with him, and

21:41.240 --> 21:48.240
get the man and get it done. All right. Douglas,
I know you can manage. Douglas is really a

21:52.090 --> 21:57.960
daring person. The way he has fought all the
TM bhoots, you see, they’re all literally

21:57.960 --> 22:01.710
frightened of him. [laughter]

22:01.710 --> 22:07.880
You must see today’s article in The Times.
Did you read? Horrible article. Did you see

22:07.880 --> 22:14.080
the… My God! You must see that. He was very
upset - David Krall. He came down and showed

22:14.080 --> 22:19.580
Me the article. It was horrible. They are
already trying to advertise it and do all

22:19.580 --> 22:23.480
kinds of things and, there’s somebody whom
they have paid perhaps for writing. David

22:23.480 --> 22:26.690
can tell you. David, have you got the article?

22:26.690 --> 22:27.970
[Yogi responds.]

22:27.970 --> 22:34.970
So, we are going to work on that. Horrible
article! He was very upset – David. [laughter]

22:37.870 --> 22:44.870
All right, he is going to get the photocopy.
Give it to Gavin. Give it to Gavin. Hold it

22:50.700 --> 22:57.700
with the prong. [laughter]

23:04.890 --> 23:11.490
So shameless and so fraudulent! It’s all
falsehood they are talking; absolute falsehood.

23:11.490 --> 23:17.840
So many people are levitating. Their guru
is levitating in the room. Everybody is levitating

23:17.840 --> 23:22.600
there, you see. All falsehood, they can disappear
in thin air.

23:22.600 --> 23:29.600
Yogi: It’s all Your work, mother. [Everyone
bursts into laughter]

23:31.230 --> 23:37.140
And, seventeen thousand people are following…
seventeen million or something.

23:37.140 --> 23:39.130
Yogis: Three hundred million.

23:39.130 --> 23:46.130
Shri Mataji: Three hundred million. All false.
All, I tell you, all falsehood. But, I tell

23:46.620 --> 23:53.620
you, these media people don’t understand
what they are up to. One has to write something

23:55.030 --> 24:02.030
to them that this all is false. Very disastrous!
Horrible!

24:04.840 --> 24:11.840
Yogi: Media is skeptical of it … enlightenment,
world peace. They had to have metal detector

24:14.940 --> 24:18.860
when they went to their head quarter. [inaudible]

24:18.860 --> 24:21.780
Shri Mataji: We have our own detector.

24:21.780 --> 24:22.840
Yogi: Yes.

24:22.840 --> 24:29.840
Shri Mataji: Isn’t it? With our detector
we found that you are devils.

24:29.960 --> 24:36.960
So, once we have this then it all came so
fast. Isn’t it? Doesn’t matter. So, you

24:44.160 --> 24:49.299
arrange the first floor and the second floor
for all the people who want to come. You keep

24:49.299 --> 24:56.299
the first floor for the ladies and the second
for the men. All right? Not the other way

24:57.559 --> 25:03.600
round. Because there would be many who would
be married with children. But most of them

25:03.600 --> 25:09.380
will be in Brighton – directly going to
that. But Jason, have you been able to receive

25:09.380 --> 25:14.940
their information about when they are coming,
how they are going, what place they want,

25:14.940 --> 25:16.010
how they want to be allotted?

25:16.010 --> 25:22.700
Jason: Some of them, Mother, yes. We have
the French people, most of them arriving on

25:22.700 --> 25:29.700
Saturday while some going directly to the
place on Friday. The Swiss people are arriving

25:30.559 --> 25:37.559
about 3 o’clock Friday afternoon. I think
also, the Italians are coming about that time.

25:41.990 --> 25:44.480
Phil Ward is in charge of organizing shuttle
and cars to bring them from the station to

25:44.480 --> 25:51.480
the seminar. The Swiss people and probably
the Italians also would like to stay here

25:52.370 --> 25:59.370
Sunday night because their flight goes on
Monday.

25:59.740 --> 26:03.750
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s [inaudible]. Also,
you will be surprised that this is on your

26:03.750 --> 26:09.380
way to Brighton. So, even if they are coming
earlier you can give this address to them

26:09.380 --> 26:14.990
so that they can come here first. And, from
here you can take some sort of a bus or something

26:14.990 --> 26:16.240
to take all of them together.

26:16.240 --> 26:21.760
Jason: Yes, Mother. There’s a green bus
that goes from Heathrow Airport to Gatwick

26:21.760 --> 26:28.760
Airport that goes almost right pass the door…
[inaudible]

26:33.919 --> 26:40.919
Shri Mataji: But why not make one place for
them to meet first of all? Some of them are

26:47.120 --> 26:53.720
coming from the back doors also or what? Are
they coming from the Brighton side?

26:53.720 --> 27:00.720
Jason: Yes, Mother. Some of them. [Inaudible]

27:00.960 --> 27:07.960
Shri Mataji: But if they are
coming on a Sunday here or something, why
not they come here?

27:23.240 --> 27:27.080
Jason: That will be after the Puja. [Inaudible]

27:27.080 --> 27:30.809
Shri Mataji: So how many will be here actually?

27:30.809 --> 27:36.150
Jason: On Sunday night, probably about fifty
or so.

27:36.150 --> 27:37.080
Shri Mataji: Fifty here?

27:37.080 --> 27:40.919
Jason: Just for the Sunday night but maybe
there will be others ….[Inaudible]

27:40.919 --> 27:46.910
Shri Mataji: All right. So, for Friday how
many will be here?

27:46.910 --> 27:51.790
Jason: Not sure… [Inaudible]

27:51.790 --> 27:58.790
[Shri Mataji greets someone on the side]

27:59.270 --> 28:06.270
Yogi: Three Italians are coming on Thursday
night.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.840
Shri Mataji: Thursday night?

28:10.840 --> 28:15.230
Yogi: And Friday morning seven o’clock is
arriving a group with …

28:15.230 --> 28:16.530
Shri Mataji: Friday morning?

28:16.530 --> 28:20.720
Yogi: Friday morning. And they want to stay
in the Ashram. I’ll bring them here.

28:20.720 --> 28:26.040
Shri Mataji: All right. So, keep it Thursday.
Say so from … it’s going to be on. But

28:26.040 --> 28:30.410
I mean gas has to be there. As soon as gas
is there I can shift here. No problem. But

28:30.410 --> 28:37.410
gas has to be here. I’ll bring the servants
also with Me.

28:38.429 --> 28:43.760
But after the Puja, after the thing Sunday
we should find out exactly how many people

28:43.760 --> 28:47.500
are coming here, because Sunday night food
can be cooked here for them. Isn’t it? And,

28:47.500 --> 28:50.160
they go on Monday morning?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.160
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

28:51.160 --> 28:58.160
Shri Mataji: That’s it. So, we can arrange
that also. It could be arranged very clearly.

29:00.470 --> 29:07.470
Nick, you have got this van till tomorrow?

29:12.530 --> 29:19.530
Nick: Yes, Mother. I should be able to extend
it. [Inaudible]

29:23.470 --> 29:24.970
Shri Mataji: All right. So tomorrow, why don’t
you send the van to Me?

29:24.970 --> 29:25.440
Nick: Yes, Mother.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.980
Shri Mataji: All right. Then, we’ll extend
it. I’ll pay for the extension.

29:27.980 --> 29:30.000
Nick : There’s no need for that, Mother.

29:30.000 --> 29:35.840
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. One day, I’ll pay
for it. All right? So, you send the van tomorrow

29:35.840 --> 29:42.840
to Me and then extend it. Hmm? Yes, tomorrow
if you send Me the van, I can send Debbie,

29:42.940 --> 29:48.870
and if the gas is fixed, they can start cooking
here. Even for… I mean you can cook for

29:48.870 --> 29:53.549
few people on that but ten people I don’t
know.

29:53.549 --> 29:55.799
Yogini responds [Inaudble]

29:55.799 --> 30:02.799
Shri Mataji: Best is to have

30:35.700 --> 30:42.700
the gas, you see.

30:57.419 --> 31:04.419
He has given birth. Hello! He has given birth.
I mean not he. [laughter] His wife has given

31:49.440 --> 31:56.440
birth to a baby boy and you know they had
very bad time with the twins that they had.

31:56.559 --> 32:02.590
It’s horrible. Tenants had an effect on
the baby and the thing was delayed by about

32:02.590 --> 32:09.590
one week but the baby is very healthy – nine
pound something and I have given him the name

32:09.970 --> 32:16.970
Janak - Janaka. I hope you are happy with
the name. He’s a very sweet baby. All right.

32:19.750 --> 32:26.750
Now, those who are coming from outside like
... are you come from Northampton, Southampton?

32:28.520 --> 32:35.520
Who else? All of you. Where are you staying
now? Where are you staying tonight? You’ll

32:40.690 --> 32:47.690
go back? You won’t come here? I mean, you
are not going to stay till Guru Puja? You

32:51.679 --> 32:53.549
want to stay here?

32:53.549 --> 32:58.110
[Yogi response inaudible]

32:58.110 --> 33:05.110
All right. All right, you’ll go back to
Southampton and then you will come. So, how

33:10.220 --> 33:17.220
are you? How is your wife? Same? So, she is
here or in Spain?

33:21.500 --> 33:26.429
[Yogi response inaudible]

33:26.429 --> 33:33.410
She is in Cambridge. How is the baby? He’ll
come round.

33:33.410 --> 33:40.410
Boghdan, how are you? How is your wife?

33:51.820 --> 33:58.820
So, for you four-five people who are staying
here after getting the gas, you see – after

34:01.909 --> 34:06.900
getting the gas, again I say, you come and
see Me tomorrow. Someone having any problem

34:06.900 --> 34:13.900
over here you better stay with Me for the
time being till we get gas. What about his

34:16.589 --> 34:23.589
food? Let him in Chelsham Road, I think till
then. If we get the gas tomorrow then there’s

34:25.429 --> 34:29.520
no problem, you see. Then we will call you
from Chelsham Road. All right? Let him be

34:29.520 --> 34:31.690
there at Chelsham Road. Who’s at Chelsham
Road now?

34:31.690 --> 34:36.359
All right, Graham [We are not sure if Shri
Mataji says Graham or not] you are organizing

34:36.359 --> 34:43.359
there. So, look after him. And, if we get
the gas tomorrow then he can shift here. All

34:48.490 --> 34:50.049
right?

34:50.049 --> 34:57.049
How are you? All right? You wrote a very nice
letter to that man, that newspaper fellow.

35:06.309 --> 35:13.309
Horrible. Just imagine I never even asked
anybody to take out the coat or anything.

35:13.450 --> 35:20.450
In general way I said you take out your coats.
They have objection even for that. Can you

35:21.569 --> 35:28.569
meditate with your raincoat on you? Absurd,
I tell you! How can these newspaper people

35:29.069 --> 35:36.069
be so stupid to write all that? I can’t
understand.

35:36.940 --> 35:43.940
Yogini; Mother, sorry to interrupt You. There’s
been a very funny new development, because

35:49.690 --> 35:56.690
this horrible man’s name has appeared in
the newspaper again. In Brighton, this horrible

35:58.420 --> 36:05.420
nudist beach which makes us so sick, we heard
some very good news. By Your Grace, they want

36:10.010 --> 36:13.200
to take away the nudist beach.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.289
Shri Mataji: Nudist?

36:15.289 --> 36:22.289
Yogini: The horrible naked beach they want
to take away. But, the man who would not take

36:31.970 --> 36:38.970
off his shoes before You, has written to the
newspaper saying “Nudist beach is very good,

36:46.940 --> 36:51.430
everyone should take out all their clothes.”

36:51.430 --> 36:58.430
Shri Mataji: Except for the raincoat! Look
at this stupidity! [laughter] Now, what do

37:01.930 --> 37:04.319
you say to these real stupid people, you know.

37:04.319 --> 37:08.549
Why not write a strong letter to editor of
this?

37:08.549 --> 37:10.259
[Yogi response inaudible]

37:10.259 --> 37:17.259
Why do they give him so much importance? Who
is he? He is the Managing Director of what

37:20.559 --> 37:21.700
company? Better…

37:21.700 --> 37:23.420
[Yogi response inaudible]

37:23.420 --> 37:30.420
Better write to them. All of you should do
it. Stupid fellow! Stupid people live here,

37:40.390 --> 37:47.390
I tell you. What were you saying? John was
telling Me something about you.

37:50.019 --> 37:57.019
Yes, you communicated something to John? John,
didn’t you say?

37:59.950 --> 38:04.369
[Yogi response inaudible]

38:04.369 --> 38:05.839
Paste?

38:05.839 --> 38:10.269
[Yogi response inaudible]

38:10.269 --> 38:16.430
That is sandalwood paste to be made with a
stone, that one. John, you know what he told

38:16.430 --> 38:23.430
Me he wants to know the name of the stone
that is to sit on his head. [laughter]

38:24.210 --> 38:28.049
I said, “Stone!” I mean I’m quite strange
but not to that extent. [laughter]

38:28.049 --> 38:35.049
I couldn’t understand. I’m sorry for that.
All right, this is the stone I was saying

38:35.630 --> 38:41.989
or any stone like this, anyone which you can
rub. This is the thing – chandan, you can

38:41.989 --> 38:44.430
put it. [Shri Mataji talks in the side]

38:44.430 --> 38:51.430
All right. So, with just this thing I said,that
on the stone is I’m rubbing it. Show him

39:03.460 --> 39:06.430
that, Gavin.

39:06.430 --> 39:13.430
Because of the heat, you see. Chandan is the
best for heat. If you get blisters due to

39:24.039 --> 39:31.039
heat or anything – just rub this and put
it on the thing – very good. Have you heard

39:39.239 --> 39:42.979
of any famous astrologer called M. K. Gandhi,
anyone of you?

39:42.979 --> 39:45.680
Yogi: Yes.

39:45.680 --> 39:52.680
Shri Mataji: Have you? I’ve never heard.

39:55.119 --> 40:02.119
Yogi: I’m sure I’ve seen his advertisements.

40:04.559 --> 40:11.559
Shri Mataji: He’s telling others good things
about Me.

40:14.390 --> 40:21.390
That’s Athena. Athena, now, what’s happening?
Now, slowly. What happened? One chana. I only

40:30.609 --> 40:37.609
had three of them just now. All right, how
many do you want? As soon as I eat the chana,

40:40.349 --> 40:47.269
the Ganas are standing there. [laughter]

40:47.269 --> 40:54.269
The Ganas are waiting to have some. That’s
their share. All right.

41:04.920 --> 41:11.920
Now, we will have the puja and then we will
have more chana. All right, sit down. It’s

41:45.769 --> 41:52.769
all right.

41:56.859 --> 42:03.859
[Yogi says something – inaudible]

42:19.029 --> 42:21.519
Have you read the letter of Patrick?

42:21.519 --> 42:28.519
What can I say? Very uncertain. Only good
news is that one Mr. Marwah who was going

42:41.519 --> 42:48.519
to do all our publicity work has been elected
as the Mayor, Mayor of Los Angeles. That’s

42:50.930 --> 42:57.930
a very big news and this may do something
good, I think. So, first I’m going to do

42:58.890 --> 43:03.329
all this in Los Angeles. Actually, I’ll
go to New York only to meet the Sahaja Yogis

43:03.329 --> 43:10.099
there. And, then I will… as the program
is… you know the program, everything…

43:10.099 --> 43:16.819
I’m happy you could come because they are
really worried about American tour. How they

43:16.819 --> 43:23.819
will take it, whether it will be successful
or not? It will be!

43:25.219 --> 43:32.219
Lets look at these nice Yogis people… just
look at them. Not worse person has seen them

43:36.170 --> 43:43.170
levited. But they are telling all lies, you
see. “There is very much better coordination

43:45.959 --> 43:52.890
of the body and the mind.” Can you believe
such a false story?

43:52.890 --> 43:59.890
So, I told him that you should meet this Dr.
Fredick or what was his name? Fredick? Ah,

44:00.150 --> 44:05.359
Frenny. You go and see him. Show him this
article. You should say that we all want to

44:05.359 --> 44:11.219
protest. He himself will be very happy. That
this is how he is going to cheat us, he is

44:11.219 --> 44:17.119
fraudulent. And, why not we all put together?
Write a letter to the editor that, “You

44:17.119 --> 44:24.119
have no business to publicize such a person
who has ruined the lives of so many.”

44:24.969 --> 44:31.969
Have you got that article of Madhu Dave…
Madhu Jain?

44:36.440 --> 44:39.150
[Yogi response inaudible.]

44:39.150 --> 44:46.150
Activities in India… six thousand crores,
ah? And, what David Praul told Me is this

44:51.089 --> 44:56.910
that so much has been written against him
but there is no mention of it. So, you take

44:56.910 --> 45:03.759
David Praul, you and Frenny and all these
people put together. Make a very strong letter

45:03.759 --> 45:10.140
about it and let Dr. Frenny put it in. And
say, there are people here who can really…

45:10.140 --> 45:17.140
thousands of people who can say what I’m
saying. Get hold of him.

45:23.200 --> 45:30.200
The doctor friend of Rustom, did you contact
him? John, did you give him the address of

45:30.519 --> 45:37.519
the doctor? Did you tell them about it? I
think Pamela was there. Pamela?

45:40.170 --> 45:41.309
[Pamela response inaudible]

45:41.309 --> 45:48.309
What about that doctor? Did you tell him that
he should come for the Puja? Then what did

45:49.630 --> 45:51.039
he say?

45:51.039 --> 45:53.160
[Pamela response inaudible]

45:53.160 --> 45:55.979
What did he say?

45:55.979 --> 45:58.089
[Pamela response inaudible]

45:58.089 --> 46:05.089
Hmm… See, all such like that Di, Lady Di
or whoever she is… how is she now?

46:09.959 --> 46:15.660
[Yogi response inaudible]

46:15.660 --> 46:22.059
So, why not take her help also in writing.
Now, you see, Warren is coming, all these

46:22.059 --> 46:27.549
people are coming – you can all put facts
together. See this Dr. Frenny – all of you.

46:27.549 --> 46:32.309
And, tell him what he’s doing and what sort
of trouble he has given to others and how

46:32.309 --> 46:38.140
he has taken the money. You go and tell him
very strongly. You, especially, we have to

46:38.140 --> 46:43.930
save others now. It’s very important. Another
thing he says that Atlanta someplace somewhere

46:43.930 --> 46:48.479
has all people have become very peaceful.
Naturally, if you make somebody into a cabbage

46:48.479 --> 46:55.479
they will be. But the majority of the people,
I mean the greater percentage of the people

46:57.469 --> 47:04.469
who are in Ireland and who are in Israel have
become much more violent. One percent in Ireland

47:12.029 --> 47:19.029
and three percent in Israel. And, you see,
how they are behaving. So, this Atlanta we

47:22.180 --> 47:26.930
cannot find out but what about these two places?

47:26.930 --> 47:31.549
This Madhu… if you get his thing you can
write down. He says that wherever his ashrams

47:31.549 --> 47:38.549
are nothing grows. Even the cows become barren.
Or you can ask Murray how it was published.

47:51.329 --> 47:55.219
It was sent to us, I think.

47:55.219 --> 47:59.329
Yogi: Murray has that?

47:59.329 --> 48:06.329
Shri Mataji: Murray has that so ask Murray
to help you there. All right? Now, one thing

48:08.259 --> 48:15.259
you can catch on him which you can play about
to say that he is anti-Christ. Whatever he

48:17.309 --> 48:23.680
preaches is anti-Christ. Because he leads
a life of licentiousness? himself and you

48:23.680 --> 48:27.969
can give the example of Linda’s things that
was written. She has written it down. Then

48:27.969 --> 48:33.150
he himself is making money out of us and has
got all the material things of the world at

48:33.150 --> 48:40.150
the cost of his disciples. He is an anti-Christ
and there is no relationship of his work with

48:46.049 --> 48:52.890
Christ, first of all. And, secondly you can
also put Karpur Gaurav and all that are actually

48:52.890 --> 48:56.019
the worship of I think Shiva or something.

48:56.019 --> 49:03.019
[Shri Mataji asks someone in Hindi is the
Karpur Gaurav mantra is for Shivji or not.]

49:21.279 --> 49:28.279
It is the Shiva’s worship. So, what they
tell them is the idol worship of Shiva – put

49:30.119 --> 49:37.119
it down. But because they don’t know any
Sanskrit they go on saying. All right? Modi

49:37.940 --> 49:44.410
will be coming, he will give you the complete
shloka. It’s Shiva’s worship. So, that

49:44.410 --> 49:47.430
will go in the Christian mind here.

49:47.430 --> 49:54.430
Then, another good news is: Rustom has said
that in the Koran there is a description of

49:58.819 --> 50:05.289
Kundalini. They call it Assas and that at
the resurrection time, the Kundalini will

50:05.289 --> 50:11.339
be awakened by Mahdi. It’s all there. So
many things in the Koran, he was saying that

50:11.339 --> 50:18.339
there are seven heavens, firmaments, through
which human beings has to pass, one has to

50:19.569 --> 50:21.329
ascend through this.

50:21.329 --> 50:26.680
But I was reading a book given to Me by one
of the Sahaja Yogis in Brighton. It’s very

50:26.680 --> 50:33.680
clearly said in that there are angels of the
Mother and angels of the heavens and then

50:38.819 --> 50:45.819
seven of them and seven of these and everything.
And, according to My calculation it is describing

50:47.410 --> 50:54.410
Monday as the sabbath - Monday. Because as
you go you see, the Creator is on the third

50:55.569 --> 51:01.999
day or second day. It should be on the third
day. It’s the second day. First is the angel

51:01.999 --> 51:08.999
of the joy. And, that is Shiva. So, it is
Monday. Like that. Very clearly. And it is

51:09.219 --> 51:13.239
all written down, it’s preserved, and they
have just taken it out and translated. Can

51:13.239 --> 51:18.089
you imagine? We have got now the scriptures
to go with. Those books are with Me – two

51:18.089 --> 51:23.609
of them. Can you get those books for Me, from
some shop?

51:23.609 --> 51:30.609
Who game Me that book? You gave Me, yes!

51:31.239 --> 51:33.789
[Yogi response inaudible]

51:33.789 --> 51:37.180
Only through your University?

51:37.180 --> 51:39.729
[Yogi response inaudible]

51:39.729 --> 51:46.729
You can? So, can you, two-three people buy
that and go through it. And, you’ll be amazed.

51:48.170 --> 51:55.170
I mean, that’s the real Bible, you can say,
about Christ. Even the Bible, which is written

52:01.190 --> 52:05.400
now about the ten commandments, everything
this is related. Because that’s the original

52:05.400 --> 52:12.400
one they found Out. Can you imagine? And,
these laws that were written in Bible at the

52:15.789 --> 52:22.789
time of Moses, which are called Shariat in
the Islamic religion, are because the people

52:22.809 --> 52:29.719
had become so bad, so bad that they had to
put such terrible, strict laws that anybody

52:29.719 --> 52:35.900
does that must be cut – his throat must
be cut, his hands must be cut, legs must be

52:35.900 --> 52:41.969
cut. All this is only because of these things
happening in those days. The people were so

52:41.969 --> 52:46.190
bad, so much on the decline that they had
to change all that and they started this.

52:46.190 --> 52:53.190
This is very clearly written there. Better
get those two books and prepare it in that

52:54.459 --> 52:59.219
line. It will be good idea.

52:59.219 --> 53:06.219
All right. You want to wash My feet? This
water – you can wash My feet. You go around

53:08.089 --> 53:15.089
and put everywhere here. Shining these days
a bit too much. You see, when we went to Malmo,

53:37.479 --> 53:44.479
I said seven mantras for the sun and the sun
came out. And since that day it’s beautiful.

56:32.209 --> 56:39.209
All right.

56:43.410 --> 56:50.410
Can you

58:26.849 --> 58:33.849
wash My feet?

59:56.630 --> 01:00:03.630
[Talk in

01:02:20.439 --> 01:02:27.439
this CD seems

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:38.550
to

01:11:54.920 --> 01:12:01.920
start mid-sentence.]
