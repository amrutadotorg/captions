00:26:03.585 --> 00:26:07.203
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:26:14.092 --> 00:26:16.729
In the medical studies

00:26:17.352 --> 00:26:21.332
whatever we have discovered so far

00:26:22.783 --> 00:26:25.522
is there already available.

00:26:39.652 --> 00:26:44.491
And whatever we can discover with human awareness

00:26:44.516 --> 00:26:46.634
has its own limitations.

00:26:57.569 --> 00:26:58.997
Supposing

00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:08.374
it is said that

00:27:08.399 --> 00:27:11.288
the human body does not accept

00:27:11.313 --> 00:27:16.383
any foreign thing into its being,

00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:29.771
but when the foetus is implanted,

00:27:29.796 --> 00:27:33.052
then it is looked after, it's not thrown out,

00:27:33.077 --> 00:27:36.625
it's looked after and thrown out at the right time.

00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:51.795
Also the role of acetylcholine and adrenaline in our body,

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:54.466
mode of action cannot be explained

00:27:54.491 --> 00:27:58.529
because sometimes they augment, sometimes they relax.

00:28:17.255 --> 00:28:20.263
We cannot even explain the action of our spleen,

00:28:20.288 --> 00:28:22.491
there are so many things that cannot be explained

00:28:22.516 --> 00:28:25.760
through medical achievements.

00:28:33.303 --> 00:28:36.286
So we have to know there is much to be known

00:28:36.311 --> 00:28:38.326
and much to be found out.

00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:48.011
So I would like you all

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:52.594
to know something of the beyond which is not known so far.

00:28:58.326 --> 00:29:03.560
And for you I would request to have

00:29:04.753 --> 00:29:07.329
an open mind of a scientist

00:29:13.782 --> 00:29:16.819
to see for youself if it is true or not.

00:29:21.563 --> 00:29:24.027
Till then it's like a hypothesis.

00:29:27.038 --> 00:29:32.191
So Sahaja Yoga gives you the complete picture,

00:29:32.412 --> 00:29:34.173
total picture,

00:29:34.467 --> 00:29:37.574
of the totality of consciousness.

00:29:45.395 --> 00:29:49.790
And as you grow higher and higher in Sahaja Yoga you yourself

00:29:50.535 --> 00:29:57.776
understand and can work out this great system.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.607
First we have to accept

00:30:07.632 --> 00:30:11.418
that we are not only this human body,

00:30:15.608 --> 00:30:17.558
nor our emotions,

00:30:19.027 --> 00:30:23.321
and neither our ego and conditionings,

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:32.389
but we are the Spirit, the pure Spirit.

00:30:36.324 --> 00:30:39.007
The another thing one has to understand,

00:30:39.032 --> 00:30:42.504
that there is an all-pervading Power of Love

00:30:48.474 --> 00:30:53.475
which does all this living work of creating flowers,

00:30:53.541 --> 00:30:57.317
creating fruits, making us human beings.

00:31:05.744 --> 00:31:09.584
Of course in the science there is no place for love as such,

00:31:09.825 --> 00:31:12.739
it doesn't talk of love.

00:31:19.329 --> 00:31:23.339
But even the doctors have to love their patients

00:31:23.364 --> 00:31:25.948
otherwise they cannot dedicate.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:36.540
So first the doctor has to become the Spirit

00:31:36.565 --> 00:31:40.116
and has to feel the cool vibrations around him,

00:31:40.141 --> 00:31:45.693
which are the proof of this all-pervading Power of Love.

00:31:58.553 --> 00:32:01.737
Now this is the instrument which you have to use,

00:32:01.762 --> 00:32:05.840
first of all for cleansing yourself and for cleansing others.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.462
In the medical terminology we can say that

00:32:18.487 --> 00:32:22.683
the parasympathetic nervous system is looked after by the central channel

00:32:22.708 --> 00:32:27.486
and the left and right is looked after by two more channels.

00:32:41.141 --> 00:32:42.821
According to Sahaja Yoga

00:32:42.846 --> 00:32:46.835
left and right sympathetic are two separate energies.

00:32:55.104 --> 00:32:57.904
The left one is the one which comforts us,

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.850
the right one is the one which counsels us

00:33:00.879 --> 00:33:05.278
and the centre one is the one which redeems us.

00:33:19.615 --> 00:33:23.177
So all this is after Realization,

00:33:26.464 --> 00:33:29.131
because you have to have the connection.

00:33:34.558 --> 00:33:39.446
Now in human beings these centres are

00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:42.788
in the spinal cord and also in the brain.

00:33:53.743 --> 00:33:55.743
And they are formed like this,

00:33:55.768 --> 00:33:57.602
from the left and from the right,

00:33:57.627 --> 00:34:00.294
both put together is the central system.

00:34:13.039 --> 00:34:16.828
The triangular bone in which this Kundalini resides

00:34:17.324 --> 00:34:20.595
is called as Sacrum as you know.

00:34:28.326 --> 00:34:30.826
‘Sacrum’ means ‘sacred’

00:34:33.525 --> 00:34:35.545
so the Greeks knew about it

00:34:37.776 --> 00:34:42.186
and they put that word in the medical terminology also, ‘sacred’.

00:34:48.673 --> 00:34:50.901
So according to Sahaja Yoga

00:34:50.926 --> 00:34:55.526
we are actually basically three types of people.

00:35:02.447 --> 00:35:06.346
Firstly, either we go to the left or to the right.

00:35:10.353 --> 00:35:14.541
Left side is our desires

00:35:15.861 --> 00:35:19.101
that have worked out and also

00:35:19.312 --> 00:35:23.158
whatever doesn’t work out goes into our subconscious

00:35:23.282 --> 00:35:24.743
on the left side,

00:35:33.995 --> 00:35:36.529
and then into collective subconscious.

00:35:42.895 --> 00:35:46.136
We can say that it looks after our psyche.

00:35:50.353 --> 00:35:52.689
It starts from down below there,

00:35:52.811 --> 00:35:54.677
from the last centre,

00:35:54.824 --> 00:35:58.067
goes upward, crosses over at the optic chiasma

00:35:58.067 --> 00:36:01.670
and creates what you call as the superego

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:04.773
in the psychological terms,

00:36:04.798 --> 00:36:06.614
means the conditioning.

00:36:18.812 --> 00:36:23.866
The lowest centre also nourishes the pelvic plexus,

00:36:31.873 --> 00:36:34.473
which is responsible for our excretion.

00:36:38.826 --> 00:36:41.314
Also it looks after sex.

00:36:47.193 --> 00:36:51.986
So one has to have sane ideas about sex,

00:36:57.939 --> 00:37:04.811
because this channel originates from the last centre.

00:37:10.788 --> 00:37:15.000
But when Freud talked of psyche,

00:37:15.066 --> 00:37:18.544
he perverted the whole thing.

00:37:26.548 --> 00:37:32.304
Instead of telling people how to safeguard this centre,

00:37:32.491 --> 00:37:38.556
how to safeguard the centre of innocence

00:37:39.844 --> 00:37:44.168
by looking after the sex habits,

00:37:44.576 --> 00:37:46.912
he just told the other way round.

00:38:01.582 --> 00:38:04.568
He related everything to sex

00:38:04.593 --> 00:38:07.302
as if human beings are just sex points.

00:38:16.032 --> 00:38:22.626
And he formed a very funny self-opiniated ideology

00:38:22.651 --> 00:38:27.617
that every man has sex feelings for his mother. Horrible!

00:38:40.795 --> 00:38:44.645
On this mental projection he based all his theories

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.340
and people thought it was so-called ‘freedom’

00:38:55.365 --> 00:38:57.789
to have sex the way they like.

00:39:07.434 --> 00:39:09.500
They didn’t even challenge him.

00:39:09.577 --> 00:39:12.844
He became more than Christ to them in the West.

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:24.529
As a result we have now the invasion of AIDS,

00:39:28.177 --> 00:39:33.137
we have got all kinds of these diseases like gonorrhoea

00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:35.331
and all these serious diseases,

00:39:35.456 --> 00:39:41.560
which are, they say so, at least 60 percent in America.

00:39:50.606 --> 00:39:53.168
All related to sex organs.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.586
It was always called as 'private', ‘private parts’,

00:40:01.611 --> 00:40:04.940
but it was never understood what does it mean.

00:40:16.861 --> 00:40:20.651
Now so the left side is the psychic problem

00:40:25.373 --> 00:40:31.995
and the right side is the physical problems, somatic problems.

00:40:37.648 --> 00:40:43.705
Now the somatic problems are when we work too hard

00:40:44.737 --> 00:40:48.324
and think too much, we are futuristic,

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:51.142
then we start using this centre,

00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:01.164
the second centre.

00:41:03.155 --> 00:41:04.835
When we think too much,

00:41:05.208 --> 00:41:09.842
then we have to supply energy for the brain.

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:20.320
So all the energy of this centre goes to such a brain

00:41:20.345 --> 00:41:22.654
which thinks too much, which is futuristic.

00:41:28.675 --> 00:41:33.228
And other important functions it has to do,

00:41:33.228 --> 00:41:34.828
which are neglected.

00:41:43.714 --> 00:41:46.705
So the right-sided problems are caused by,

00:41:46.705 --> 00:41:49.637
neglect by liver, overactive liver.

00:41:54.676 --> 00:41:59.650
You get diabetes because pancreas is not looked after.

00:42:07.327 --> 00:42:12.779
You get leukemia because spleen is not looked after.

00:42:19.205 --> 00:42:20.505
You get

00:42:22.313 --> 00:42:25.577
high blood pressure because kidneys are in trouble.

00:42:31.299 --> 00:42:36.050
As the heat of the liver ascends you get asthma.

00:42:42.383 --> 00:42:46.211
We all know that the brain is like a spongy matter

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.202
and in a way coagulates.

00:43:01.977 --> 00:43:03.897
Same thing happens to kidneys

00:43:03.922 --> 00:43:07.005
when the heat goes to the kidneys.

00:43:12.048 --> 00:43:13.848
They cannot pass the urine,

00:43:13.873 --> 00:43:17.018
the urine circulates in the body and in the blood.

00:43:23.385 --> 00:43:25.652
Also it causes constipation.

00:43:29.849 --> 00:43:35.079
So heat is the symptom of disease

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:46.225
and coolness is the symptom of benevolence.

00:43:54.041 --> 00:43:55.041
So

00:43:56.664 --> 00:43:59.554
they have experimented with helium gas

00:43:59.707 --> 00:44:03.126
and when they gave heat to helium

00:44:03.151 --> 00:44:07.503
they found out that all the molecules were fighting with each other.

00:44:17.581 --> 00:44:19.951
And when they cooled it,

00:44:20.512 --> 00:44:23.712
then they found all the molecules were collective.

00:44:31.679 --> 00:44:35.104
Now the third type of diseases are psychosomatic,

00:44:35.129 --> 00:44:36.729
combination of both.

00:44:40.313 --> 00:44:42.727
But those who are psychosomatic

00:44:42.896 --> 00:44:47.605
they have more problems with the psyche than with the physical.

00:44:55.057 --> 00:44:57.680
I'll explain to you about cancer,

00:44:57.680 --> 00:44:59.847
which is psychosomatic according to us.

00:45:08.185 --> 00:45:13.412
All these viruses are the dead plants or dead animals,

00:45:13.787 --> 00:45:15.227
maybe microscopic,

00:45:15.419 --> 00:45:18.747
which have gone out of the circulation of evolution.

00:45:29.802 --> 00:45:33.699
They reside in the area which we call as collective subconscious.

00:45:43.318 --> 00:45:46.947
Doctors have reached the certain understanding about it,

00:45:46.972 --> 00:45:48.706
little certain understanding,

00:45:48.768 --> 00:45:52.072
that they say there are proteins 53 and 58,

00:45:52.072 --> 00:45:54.939
which trigger the cancer.

00:46:06.937 --> 00:46:10.539
Also they say that this

00:46:14.523 --> 00:46:19.490
cancer is caused to a person

00:46:19.895 --> 00:46:23.689
when he goes into some sort of a shock or something

00:46:23.839 --> 00:46:28.769
and this attack comes from, triggering comes from

00:46:28.951 --> 00:46:34.618
the area which was built within us since our creation.

00:46:51.713 --> 00:46:54.146
This is the same area, which I'm telling you,

00:46:54.171 --> 00:46:57.854
is the collective subconscious where everything that is dead is there.

00:47:06.132 --> 00:47:09.360
So there are people, also human beings who are dead,

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.760
are hanging round there, dead souls.

00:47:16.123 --> 00:47:18.014
Now if I tell you something

00:47:18.039 --> 00:47:21.239
which you may not have heard with medical science,

00:47:26.402 --> 00:47:28.580
but I'll give you the complete picture

00:47:28.605 --> 00:47:30.481
in any case to understand.

00:47:34.037 --> 00:47:36.049
There is the soul

00:47:37.664 --> 00:47:41.987
which is made of causal of all the elements,

00:47:50.587 --> 00:47:55.418
which is attached in loops on the back side of our body,

00:48:06.624 --> 00:48:08.548
in all the seven centres

00:48:08.573 --> 00:48:12.164
plus the Sacrum bone where it resides.

00:48:18.688 --> 00:48:20.495
It makes seven loops.

00:48:23.762 --> 00:48:25.122
I have told them,

00:48:25.147 --> 00:48:29.020
because after Realization you can see many loops like that,

00:48:29.045 --> 00:48:30.751
round round things in loop,

00:48:30.776 --> 00:48:33.512
you see them like chakras and one into another,

00:48:33.537 --> 00:48:36.573
many of them, sometimes together, sometimes only one.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.663
Also you can see little sparks like commas,

00:48:47.688 --> 00:48:50.922
that is the Chaitanya, that is the vibrations.

00:49:00.231 --> 00:49:04.052
Now I have told them that these are the dead souls

00:49:04.222 --> 00:49:05.639
hanging around.

00:49:11.748 --> 00:49:17.706
Now this soul is reflected on our cells in the receptor area.

00:49:27.066 --> 00:49:32.311
Recently, very recently in America they have now pictured

00:49:34.479 --> 00:49:36.621
the receptor of a cell.

00:49:44.765 --> 00:49:47.294
It exactly looks like the one

00:49:47.294 --> 00:49:50.558
you see after Realization in the air, exactly.

00:49:57.527 --> 00:50:02.032
But when another soul sits on the being

00:50:02.174 --> 00:50:05.064
then it is reflected on the cells.

00:50:08.301 --> 00:50:10.235
Dead soul, another dead soul.

00:50:20.216 --> 00:50:22.072
It affects the soul,

00:50:22.072 --> 00:50:28.228
it affects them because it is reflected in the cell,

00:50:28.253 --> 00:50:34.191
it is also affects the receptor.

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:46.617
Then this soul, new soul, which is there,

00:50:46.642 --> 00:50:49.885
it might get attached to anyone of the centres

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:55.207
or to all of them depends on affects the cells also.

00:51:07.645 --> 00:51:11.383
And they create all this dopamine series

00:51:11.408 --> 00:51:15.615
which causes epilepsy, mental problems,

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.317
also cancer, also AIDS, also all these things.

00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:32.188
So if they are viruses, then it’s not so bad,

00:51:32.213 --> 00:51:35.309
I mean only one portion can be affected,

00:51:35.334 --> 00:51:38.533
but it can travel from one to another.

00:51:46.031 --> 00:51:51.557
But if it’s a human possession then it’s very difficult.

00:52:00.324 --> 00:52:04.546
So now in Sahaja Yoga to cure the diseases

00:52:04.546 --> 00:52:06.479
which you are giving me here,

00:52:07.147 --> 00:52:10.383
out of which I'll give it out to you is:

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:14.017
hypertension can be caused both of them,

00:52:14.034 --> 00:52:17.118
heart disease could be also from the same.

00:52:17.118 --> 00:52:19.700
Epilepsy definitely from the left side.

00:52:19.835 --> 00:52:23.163
Migraine or sick headaches could be from both sides.

00:52:28.752 --> 00:52:30.690
All these bone diseases...

00:52:30.934 --> 00:52:35.529
Is this like, what you call, arthritis?

00:52:36.236 --> 00:52:39.033
It is this also is psychosomatic.

00:52:39.058 --> 00:52:41.525
Leukemia is definitely psychosomatic,

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:43.437
tumours are psychosomatic,

00:52:43.462 --> 00:52:46.461
women diseases, fibrosis, menopause...

00:52:46.685 --> 00:52:53.819
menopause is not a disease, it’s a normal thing.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:08.622
Inflammation of the pancreas could be also psychosomatic.

00:53:14.054 --> 00:53:17.817
Cholecystitis need not be, need not be,

00:53:17.988 --> 00:53:20.316
it is, it can be somatic also.

00:53:22.548 --> 00:53:26.810
No, actually cholecystitis is left-sided, is left-sided, sorry.

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:44.735
Sciatica could be both, could be psychosomatic, could be somatic.

00:53:48.957 --> 00:53:52.346
All mental diseases — left-sided, absolutely.

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:55.391
Schizophrenia — absolutely.

00:53:55.797 --> 00:54:01.174
Alcoholism is created by right side, creating left side problems.

00:54:04.358 --> 00:54:06.838
Arthritis — psychosomatic.

00:54:08.084 --> 00:54:11.390
Varicosity is right-sided.

00:54:14.139 --> 00:54:17.162
Now bad habits, like drug addiction, smoking,

00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:21.643
homo sexuality and all kind of perverted sex,

00:54:22.182 --> 00:54:25.830
too much indulgence into sex is all due to psychosomatic,

00:54:25.885 --> 00:54:28.352
or left-sided, absolutely left-sided.

00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:36.465
See, drug addiction, smoking...

00:54:37.572 --> 00:54:40.669
smoking creates left side problem

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.227
because one feels guilty.

00:54:49.147 --> 00:54:56.209
But we can say, perverted sex habits

00:55:00.703 --> 00:55:04.262
and flirting of the eyes,

00:55:12.441 --> 00:55:13.944
and AIDS,

00:55:17.586 --> 00:55:20.345
and what you call,

00:55:21.137 --> 00:55:22.874
too much of sex,

00:55:26.341 --> 00:55:27.922
or rigidity,

00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:38.360
and also interest in, I've said,
perverted sex you call that,

00:55:38.599 --> 00:55:41.054
all this is due to the left side,

00:55:41.393 --> 00:55:45.068
is some sort of a possession.

00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:56.418
Infantile paralysis is left-sided, same thing,

00:55:56.443 --> 00:56:01.168
multiple sclerosis absolutely this left, this centre.

00:56:05.245 --> 00:56:08.637
We cured the other day one lady of multiple sclerosis

00:56:08.646 --> 00:56:12.038
in about ten minutes and she started walking so fast.

00:56:20.169 --> 00:56:22.563
Then, what is there, neurosis —

00:56:22.588 --> 00:56:26.577
neurosis could be from both the sides

00:56:27.053 --> 00:56:28.592
[UNCLEAR]

00:56:32.665 --> 00:56:37.861
Parkinson’s also from the same, left side.

00:56:38.535 --> 00:56:44.532
Rheumatism is the Nabhi, left side.

00:56:45.512 --> 00:56:47.968
Muscular dystrophy also left side.

00:56:51.605 --> 00:56:53.368
Stroke could be depends on:

00:56:53.393 --> 00:56:56.826
if it is on the left-hand side, then it is from the somatic side;

00:56:56.851 --> 00:57:00.495
if it is on the right-hand side, then it is from the left side.

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:16.284
Then there is yuppie’s disease —

00:57:20.149 --> 00:57:24.035
yuppie’s disease is where you are very hard working,

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.682
you are extremely futuristic

00:57:26.707 --> 00:57:29.854
and use your conscious mind too much,

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:31.559
studying too much also.

00:57:41.122 --> 00:57:44.514
Then the conscious mind becomes absolutely paralyzed.

00:57:49.189 --> 00:57:51.151
You are walking all right

00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:54.437
and suddenly you are conscious that you are walking —

00:57:54.462 --> 00:57:56.183
you just paralyzed.

00:58:01.695 --> 00:58:06.649
I had told about yuppie’s disease about eight years back in America,

00:58:06.783 --> 00:58:08.488
that it will come.

00:58:08.729 --> 00:58:10.663
But they didn't listen to Me.

00:58:17.508 --> 00:58:20.108
Now it is a very, very serious disease,

00:58:21.557 --> 00:58:22.778
very serious

00:58:24.375 --> 00:58:29.088
and it's fast spreading, very fast spreading.

00:58:30.925 --> 00:58:35.800
I told them about AIDS about I think

00:58:36.571 --> 00:58:38.456
fourteen years back.

00:58:43.742 --> 00:58:45.487
They laughed at Me.

00:58:47.215 --> 00:58:48.735
Now they are in it.

00:58:51.932 --> 00:58:55.616
Diabetes is partly, very partly

00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:58.477
we should say left, but mostly right.

00:59:03.623 --> 00:59:05.957
Cancer is, any cancer is like this:

00:59:05.982 --> 00:59:10.848
you see, this is the centre and centre is giving energy on both the sides.

00:59:19.498 --> 00:59:24.532
And when you move one too much,

00:59:24.557 --> 00:59:27.458
because of using left or right, specially right,

00:59:27.483 --> 00:59:29.550
when you use too much of right,

00:59:29.577 --> 00:59:32.199
the exhaustion takes place [UNCLEAR].

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:42.140
So you are vulnerable.

00:59:47.532 --> 00:59:51.721
And suddenly happens from the left side, it breaks.

00:59:55.853 --> 00:59:59.218
And the connection with the whole is lost.

01:00:03.698 --> 01:00:07.348
So these proteins, like 53, 58,

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:09.659
they are very ego-oriented

01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:17.730
and arbitrary.

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:25.800
Whatever cell they touch, that becomes malignant.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:34.456
Thus, malignancy is set in.

01:00:38.044 --> 01:00:40.511
Same women suffer from breast cancer.

01:00:44.835 --> 01:00:47.262
The centre of heart

01:00:49.485 --> 01:00:51.296
is the Mother’s centre.

01:00:55.971 --> 01:00:58.871
When the motherhood is challenged of a woman,

01:00:58.963 --> 01:01:03.357
supposing the husband has flirt and he keeps her always insecure,

01:01:14.983 --> 01:01:19.211
or she’s very much sort of insecure otherwise also

01:01:19.573 --> 01:01:22.628
then this centre gets tarnished.

01:01:31.042 --> 01:01:35.274
Now this centre produces antibodies to fight the diseases

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:38.267
in the sternum bone as you all know

01:01:42.529 --> 01:01:44.546
till the age of twelve years.

01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:52.600
And then they are distributed all over.

01:01:56.430 --> 01:02:00.073
So whenever there is any fear the sternum bone shakes

01:02:00.098 --> 01:02:02.098
and it's like a remote control

01:02:02.157 --> 01:02:06.316
and sends messages to all the antibodies to fight.

01:02:20.872 --> 01:02:25.870
So if you can establish the security of such a lady

01:02:27.113 --> 01:02:30.863
through Kundalini awakening, nourishing her centre here,

01:02:30.888 --> 01:02:32.684
her cancer can be cured.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.360
When they are in very advance stages,

01:02:46.995 --> 01:02:51.103
they do not have that will-power left.

01:02:56.958 --> 01:03:01.502
Then it’s better to remove the breast and then establish your security.

01:03:12.322 --> 01:03:14.815
Already there are diseases also

01:03:14.879 --> 01:03:20.054
which are caused by the lethargic organs.

01:03:25.523 --> 01:03:28.282
When heart is lethargic you get angina.

01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:39.483
When this centre of Vishuddhi catches on the left side here,

01:03:39.508 --> 01:03:41.055
when you feel guilty,

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:45.715
then the blood cannot flow to the head,

01:03:54.935 --> 01:03:57.121
then it has to work very hard

01:04:00.731 --> 01:04:04.437
and such a heart becomes tired and lethargic.

01:04:09.235 --> 01:04:13.250
So in Sahaja Yoga we have two types of organs:

01:04:13.311 --> 01:04:16.505
one are overactive and one are lethargic.

01:04:26.393 --> 01:04:29.860
It's lucky that the photograph also have vibrations.

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:40.346
So the doctors should first of all establish themselves properly,

01:04:40.371 --> 01:04:42.051
cleanse themselves nicely

01:04:49.181 --> 01:04:50.919
and protect themselves,

01:04:52.905 --> 01:04:56.071
then they can also learn how to cure others.

01:04:59.606 --> 01:05:02.418
But in the beginning, you can use the photographs

01:05:02.443 --> 01:05:06.421
and with the photographs how to cure you can find out from the centres,

01:05:15.594 --> 01:05:18.515
for every, left side or right side,

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:22.855
there are only three types: left side, right side or psychosomatic.

01:05:32.716 --> 01:05:34.744
But as I told you,

01:05:34.927 --> 01:05:39.259
that psychosomatic is first has to be dealt only on the left side.

01:05:45.533 --> 01:05:49.286
I think I've dealt with many diseases

01:05:50.904 --> 01:05:54.138
and if you have any other problems

01:05:54.673 --> 01:05:58.001
you should let me know what is to be done.

01:05:58.026 --> 01:05:59.975
There is one more, I must say,

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.583
that I've seen some children suffering from hyperactivity.

01:06:21.203 --> 01:06:26.566
Even diabetes comes from the same reason of a children.

01:06:27.032 --> 01:06:31.832
Children get diabetes with the same disease of which I'm telling.

01:06:36.685 --> 01:06:41.068
At the time when the mother is pregnant,

01:06:41.346 --> 01:06:44.399
she should not work very hard.

01:06:44.463 --> 01:06:46.377
She should take rest more.

01:06:54.179 --> 01:06:56.985
She should not think too much

01:06:57.010 --> 01:07:02.117
but read something soothing things, something nice.

01:07:10.972 --> 01:07:13.032
Best is to meditate.

01:07:14.706 --> 01:07:17.106
At that time if mother is overactive

01:07:17.131 --> 01:07:19.664
and thinking of the futuristic things,

01:07:19.689 --> 01:07:22.223
children are born with these diseases.

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:34.314
And if she’s hectic,

01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:37.271
the child may get leukemia

01:07:46.632 --> 01:07:50.024
because you know spleen will use for all emergencies,

01:07:50.049 --> 01:07:52.783
because it produces red blood corpuscles.

01:08:02.425 --> 01:08:05.708
But you are hectic, panicked all the time,

01:08:06.835 --> 01:08:11.121
rushing about, then poor spleen doesn't understand.

01:08:22.953 --> 01:08:27.306
It becomes erratic and also it becomes crazy I must say.

01:08:32.403 --> 01:08:36.568
This could be for even grownups, same thing.

01:08:37.594 --> 01:08:39.594
This is also for the grownups.

01:08:42.002 --> 01:08:47.461
Now when suddenly something triggers from the left side

01:08:47.587 --> 01:08:51.119
as a shock maybe, as some sort of a sadness,

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:53.339
maybe accident, anything,

01:09:02.662 --> 01:09:04.549
it triggers leukemia,

01:09:08.721 --> 01:09:10.678
as well as in the children.

01:09:13.259 --> 01:09:16.694
But the worst thing that is very difficult

01:09:17.221 --> 01:09:19.474
for anybody to understand

01:09:19.629 --> 01:09:23.713
is there are negative forces working.

01:09:30.913 --> 01:09:33.179
They work through negative people.

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.291
These can come as false gurus

01:09:40.316 --> 01:09:45.093
or some parapsychology or mesmerism,

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.161
anything like that.

01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:59.586
All these things are done

01:09:59.611 --> 01:10:04.352
through putting some sort of a dead soul on your soul.

01:10:11.628 --> 01:10:14.249
So one has to be very careful.

01:10:17.131 --> 01:10:19.808
For this you cannot charge money

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:22.608
because it's a living process of evolution.

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:32.446
Anything living: for example, you sow the seed —

01:10:32.471 --> 01:10:35.767
you don’t pay any money to Mother Earth, she does it.

01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:45.498
It is built in the seed as well as the Mother Earth.

01:10:45.523 --> 01:10:47.052
You don't pay anything.

01:10:52.553 --> 01:10:55.668
We also take all the living processes for granted

01:10:55.693 --> 01:10:57.343
without thinking about it.

01:11:03.372 --> 01:11:05.052
There’s no obligation.

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:12.123
But all these horrible people are money-oriented.

01:11:19.874 --> 01:11:22.774
They have no purity of heart, purity of eyes.

01:11:26.402 --> 01:11:29.112
They are interested in women or men,

01:11:29.137 --> 01:11:31.870
all kinds of thing, dirty things they do.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:39.379
The most important thing

01:11:39.404 --> 01:11:42.428
they cannot explain how they do it.

01:11:51.561 --> 01:11:54.413
They cannot relate it to medical science

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.118
or to any science.

01:12:03.797 --> 01:12:07.061
Now there are some people who are trying to market,

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:11.286
marketing in Ayurveda. This is another trick.

01:12:17.359 --> 01:12:19.777
That's the Indian system medical.

01:12:22.431 --> 01:12:27.318
Firstly, there is no need to have any guru for that,

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.743
you can always get it in the market.

01:12:36.438 --> 01:12:41.845
But these medicines are made out of absolutely fresh leaves,

01:12:42.116 --> 01:12:46.902
fresh roots, everything fresh, that only grows in India.

01:12:46.927 --> 01:12:48.372
Fruits, fresh fruits.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:00.978
For example, you people take Liv 52 here,

01:13:01.003 --> 01:13:04.298
is made from a little fruit

01:13:04.323 --> 01:13:07.680
we call as aronya in India, from that, aronya.

01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:26.792
So if you eat for a week aronya your liver is all right,

01:13:26.817 --> 01:13:29.306
you don't have to take this Liv 52 all your life.

01:13:37.182 --> 01:13:39.665
And they are very limited, few,

01:13:39.690 --> 01:13:42.762
but there are some medicines which are very few,

01:13:42.787 --> 01:13:46.099
which are there, which can be helpful,

01:13:52.789 --> 01:13:57.040
which can be also made into pills and could be selled.

01:13:57.881 --> 01:13:59.783
Could be make into pills.

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:11.053
Next time I'll try to bring some for you.

01:14:13.159 --> 01:14:17.011
But the best way is Sahaja Yoga, is your own power.

01:14:21.343 --> 01:14:25.311
If you need any additional help then we do use vibrated water,

01:14:25.455 --> 01:14:29.080
vibrated sugar, vibrated salt

01:14:29.304 --> 01:14:33.299
and also we use certain these medicines little vibrated.

01:14:35.129 --> 01:14:37.341
Very, very, very few.

01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:47.595
And also Hatha Yoga, some exercises we tell you

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.954
whenever it is necessary, very few.

01:14:57.377 --> 01:15:03.846
Like wherever there is a chakra damaged

01:15:03.846 --> 01:15:06.242
because of some physical problem,

01:15:06.242 --> 01:15:12.403
we try to give that particular Hatha Yoga exercise, precisely.

01:15:21.116 --> 01:15:23.281
But the way people do Hatha Yoga

01:15:23.306 --> 01:15:27.566
is taking all the medicines from the medicine chest,

01:15:27.591 --> 01:15:30.394
without knowing what to take, what not to take.

01:15:39.563 --> 01:15:41.630
Actually it is not Hatha Yoga —

01:15:41.655 --> 01:15:44.235
Ha Tha, means both the Nadis have to be used,

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:46.068
it's only Ha they use.

01:15:53.193 --> 01:15:56.265
And this can cause such an imbalance within you,

01:15:56.307 --> 01:16:00.081
that [UNCLEAR] can become extremely dry,

01:16:05.725 --> 01:16:09.717
hot tempered and may divorce his wife,

01:16:09.749 --> 01:16:12.078
may not produce any children.

01:16:20.667 --> 01:16:24.652
Now the women who are very right-sided, over right-sided,

01:16:24.677 --> 01:16:27.577
very left-sided also cannot produce children.

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:39.588
And they have so many problems otherwise.

01:16:44.086 --> 01:16:47.801
So that means is that we have to be in the centre,

01:16:51.488 --> 01:16:54.159
our Kundalini should be fixed permanently

01:16:54.184 --> 01:16:56.455
with that all-pervading Power

01:17:00.345 --> 01:17:03.353
and the flow should be all the time within you.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.168
But apart from physical, mental and emotional life,

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:13.344
you have the spiritual life,

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:22.926
which is much more miraculous,

01:17:27.052 --> 01:17:28.878
which is very blissful

01:17:31.832 --> 01:17:36.361
and when you understand how this power of Love looks after you,

01:17:36.429 --> 01:17:37.970
you are amazed.

01:17:49.568 --> 01:17:51.768
You don't worry about anything.

01:17:55.392 --> 01:17:58.126
That's what doctor Wallace told about Me,

01:17:58.151 --> 01:18:00.941
that he cannot cope with Me.

01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:04.583
But the main thing is I don't do anything.

01:18:10.142 --> 01:18:13.641
If I'm travelling I'm there, if I'm with you I'm here,

01:18:13.665 --> 01:18:15.261
so what am I doing?

01:18:22.434 --> 01:18:24.643
So I don't think I do anything.

01:18:27.112 --> 01:18:29.683
My love just flows, that's all,

01:18:29.708 --> 01:18:31.770
I know that it flows, that's all,

01:18:31.795 --> 01:18:33.422
but I don't do anything.

01:18:39.037 --> 01:18:41.225
Because that is My nature.

01:18:48.832 --> 01:18:51.904
That's how it is going to work out with you all,

01:18:51.929 --> 01:18:55.139
but I will advise you first not to touch the patient,

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:56.812
use the photograph.
