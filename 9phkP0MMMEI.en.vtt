00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:09.454
This is the left side, this is the right side.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.220
This is the left sympathetic nervous system and&nbsp;
this is the right sympathetic nervous system&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.354
and really the spinal cord looks like this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.740
and inside here is the spinal&nbsp;
cord which has the centres in it.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.918
The subtle centres.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.264
Now when you start using the energy of&nbsp;
these centres, say too much on the right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.076
and it starts moving more towards&nbsp;
the right and there is a constriction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.378
and the power becomes less because you are&nbsp;
exhausting it, going more towards the right side.

00:00:43.378 --> 00:00:47.514
Suddenly something happens and&nbsp;
from the left, if there is a jerk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.774 --> 00:00:50.825
the connection is completely broken.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.440
This is on its own.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.730
It starts working on its own.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.450
That is what you say that&nbsp;
this has become malignant.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.920
It has no relationship with the whole to&nbsp;
have proportionate growth so if the nose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.649
starts developing it can cover&nbsp;
your eyes and cover your mouth, everything.

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.362
This is how a cancer is&nbsp;
setting or any other disease.

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:16.996
So many psychosomatic diseases are nothing but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.420
somatic is from the right side and when the psyche&nbsp;
gives in, then it becomes a psychosomatic disease.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.613
There are so many diseases which&nbsp;
are more psychosomatic than physical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.880
and these we call them as incurable,&nbsp;
can be easily cured by Kundalini&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.580
awakening because when Kundalini passes&nbsp;
through this, she just integrates them.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.320
For example, sheâ€™s going like this then&nbsp;
she goes into this integrates them.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.291
Just like she strings them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:52.275
also she nourishes that centre.

00:01:52.744 --> 00:01:57.912
That is how people get cured, automatically&nbsp;
by themselves by their own power.
