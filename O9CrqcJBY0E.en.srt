1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,217
[Shiva] has the power to give you vibrations.

2
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:13,154
He gives you vibrations.

3
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:21,487
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

4
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:24,406
but He makes the vibrations.

5
00:00:24,487 --> 00:00:28,240
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

6
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:32,403
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

7
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,447
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

8
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:42,656
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

9
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:47,321
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

10
00:00:48,612 --> 00:00:52,362
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

11
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,406
Today only I was explaining

12
00:00:57,487 --> 00:01:01,073
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

13
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:04,031
and has done so much study of bhakti

14
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:06,281
and all that and knew so much,

15
00:01:06,362 --> 00:01:10,325
just merged into Me.

16
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:13,906
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

17
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:15,781
because normally people don't do.

18
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:17,906
When they are reading about Devi they think,

19
00:01:17,987 --> 00:01:21,823
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."
You see, it's separate things.

20
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:25,862
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

21
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,240
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

22
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:32,531
It's written that how You are gentle,

23
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:35,531
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

24
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:37,531
how She looks after me,

25
00:01:37,612 --> 00:01:40,322
how Her attention is on me."

26
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:44,280
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

27
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:47,031
every glance is an inspection."

28
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:49,240
But "inspection" not a very good word,

29
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:54,191
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

30
00:01:55,487 --> 00:01:58,115
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

31
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:01,864
You are all the time - when I listen to music

32
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:05,364
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

33
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:09,406
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

34
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:12,929
All the time I feel Your love."

35
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,406
That's how the bhakti comes in.

36
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,115
So if you have vibrations

37
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:24,135
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

38
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:26,990
No,

39
00:02:27,071 --> 00:02:31,071
it means the joy of bhakti.

40
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,531
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

41
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:42,653
It's the ocean of love that is God.

42
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:45,572
You just get drenched into it.

43
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:48,112
There's no words to it.

44
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:56,904
And that is what when you feel,
you must know that

45
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:01,612
you have taken the spirit

46
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:07,196
as a real connection

47
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:11,862
between you and your Mother,

48
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:15,528
or your Father.

49
00:03:17,487 --> 00:03:22,987
There's no differentiation.

50
00:03:25,403 --> 00:03:27,551
You are one

51
00:03:28,987 --> 00:03:32,031
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

52
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:35,240
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

53
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:39,153
You are one in that bhakti.

54
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:43,361
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

55
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:49,403
because not man-made.

56
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:57,361
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

57
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:03,240
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

58
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:05,987
but is the bhakti.

59
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,279
That is the joy

60
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:12,198
of Shiva's quality,

61
00:04:12,279 --> 00:04:15,695
the quality of joy that He adds

62
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:19,237
to our life.

63
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:24,281
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

64
00:04:24,362 --> 00:04:26,698
Same thing the joy,

65
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,781
that "I'm loved so much by God,

66
00:04:29,862 --> 00:04:32,156
that God loves me,

67
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:36,200
that I have a meaning in life."

68
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:42,217
Then the ego drops out first of all,

69
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:48,197
and also the conditionings drop out.
