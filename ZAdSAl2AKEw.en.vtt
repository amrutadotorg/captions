00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:14.640
So, you move to the third center&nbsp;
which we call as the Nabhi chakra.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.177
This center is, on one side, is made&nbsp;
of water and another side with fire.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.554
Around it are our ten valencies, which we can&nbsp;
call as our innate religion within ourselves.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:50.580
Now this Nabhi itself – or we can call the solar&nbsp;
plexus or we can say the Navel chakra – gives us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.540
as soon as the Kundalini rises,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.660
she awakens this and the light when&nbsp;
it spreads, you become religious.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.821
I don't have to tell you&nbsp;
anything, you just become.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.280
I don't have to say that you don't take drugs.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.660
You just don't take it.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.046
Overnight I have seen people have given up drugs.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.780
Overnight, alcoholism, overnight, everything.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.060
And they enjoy their virtues.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.200
That's the best part of it.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.420
Some people think, "Well then,&nbsp;
what is the fun?" What is this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.838
that you take something in the pub&nbsp;
and next day you have hangover?

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.546
Here you take something and next&nbsp;
day you are much better off.

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:39.000
It never comes down.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.280
It never gives you a reaction.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.960
It's not artificial.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.700
It's not intoxicating.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.779
It is from your nerves it is bubbling out.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.520
So, this is the center which is very important in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.404
us because most of us have&nbsp;
a problem with this center.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:15.900
And here we have a capacity, by this&nbsp;
center, that we enjoy our generosity.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.920
Now all matter whatever it&nbsp;
is – we are materialistic,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.680
materialistic, it is a good&nbsp;
idea to be materialistic.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.140
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.397
that you can give it to others&nbsp;
suggesting your love in it.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.433
I think that's the only thing a matter can do.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.640
And in a very special way&nbsp;
you can express that love.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:55.920
For example, somebody likes a particular thing –&nbsp;
you go all the way to get it and give that small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:06.960
thing, very small thing, to the person and the&nbsp;
joy, not out of the money that you have spent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.084
but the feelings you have expressed of&nbsp;
knowing what that person would love.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.560
And this kind of a depth develops within you.

00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:32.879
Such lovable, beautiful society you enter into.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.796
And you don't need anything because&nbsp;
everybody is looking after your needs.

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:43.755
Now I have told them I love flowers&nbsp;
because I don't take anything else.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.900
So, you must see whenever I come My house is so&nbsp;
filled with flowers that My husband was saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.360
"Let us go and live in the garden&nbsp;
and let the flowers be here."

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.180
So, you see, the joy of&nbsp;
giving comes from this center.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:12.360
And whatever you eat, whatever you have&nbsp;
to eat, whatever is good for you, you eat.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.620
You don't have to bother as to&nbsp;
what to eat, what not to eat.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.640
You just eat whatever is good&nbsp;
for you, benevolent for you.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.400
You become so wise. And also you please others.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.780
You don't displease others by saying&nbsp;
"this is bad food, I want that."

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.820
"I want" goes away.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.445
What do you want?

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.560
So the - like you could say a candle which is&nbsp;
not enlightened, is waiting to be enlightened,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.780
is asking for the light, "I want light".

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.460
But once it is enlightened, it gives light&nbsp;
to others, automatically; supposed to be.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:08.340
In the same way you also start giving your light,&nbsp;
your love, your joy to others, automatically.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.560
I don't have to tell you.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.120
Nobody has to go through any&nbsp;
Ten Commandments anymore.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.082
Those days are gone.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.740
Now automatically you become like that.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:34.380
Very beautiful people, very&nbsp;
affectionate and glorious, I should say.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.740
If you see the glow on the face of&nbsp;
Sahaja Yogis, the face itself is radiant.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.908
Many people drop out their ten&nbsp;
years to twenty years in their age.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.115
And they are so enthusiastic, never get tired.
