00:08.433 --> 00:14.640
So, you move to the third center
which we call as the Nabhi chakra.

00:17.460 --> 00:24.177
This center is, on one side, is made
of water and another side with fire.

00:26.880 --> 00:34.554
Around it are our ten valencies, which we can
call as our innate religion within ourselves.

00:36.840 --> 00:50.580
Now this Nabhi itself – or we can call the solar
plexus or we can say the Navel chakra – gives us,

00:52.560 --> 00:54.540
as soon as the Kundalini rises,

00:55.980 --> 01:00.660
she awakens this and the light when
it spreads, you become religious.

01:00.660 --> 01:04.821
I don't have to tell you
anything, you just become.

01:05.820 --> 01:08.280
I don't have to say that you don't take drugs.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.660
You just don't take it.

01:09.660 --> 01:13.046
Overnight I have seen people have given up drugs.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.780
Overnight, alcoholism, overnight, everything.

01:15.780 --> 01:18.060
And they enjoy their virtues.

01:18.060 --> 01:20.200
That's the best part of it.

01:20.820 --> 01:24.420
Some people think, "Well then,
what is the fun?" What is this

01:25.260 --> 01:30.838
that you take something in the pub
and next day you have hangover?

01:31.740 --> 01:36.546
Here you take something and next
day you are much better off.

01:36.932 --> 01:39.000
It never comes down.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.280
It never gives you a reaction.

01:41.280 --> 01:42.960
It's not artificial.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.700
It's not intoxicating.

01:45.420 --> 01:48.779
It is from your nerves it is bubbling out.

01:50.160 --> 01:53.520
So, this is the center which is very important in

01:53.520 --> 01:58.404
us because most of us have
a problem with this center.

02:00.420 --> 02:15.900
And here we have a capacity, by this
center, that we enjoy our generosity.

02:19.140 --> 02:22.920
Now all matter whatever it
is – we are materialistic,

02:22.920 --> 02:25.680
materialistic, it is a good
idea to be materialistic.

02:26.340 --> 02:31.140
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters are,

02:31.920 --> 02:36.397
that you can give it to others
suggesting your love in it.

02:36.900 --> 02:40.433
I think that's the only thing a matter can do.

02:42.300 --> 02:46.640
And in a very special way
you can express that love.

02:47.100 --> 02:55.920
For example, somebody likes a particular thing –
you go all the way to get it and give that small

02:55.920 --> 03:06.960
thing, very small thing, to the person and the
joy, not out of the money that you have spent,

03:08.100 --> 03:15.084
but the feelings you have expressed of
knowing what that person would love.

03:17.340 --> 03:22.560
And this kind of a depth develops within you.

03:25.361 --> 03:32.879
Such lovable, beautiful society you enter into.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.796
And you don't need anything because
everybody is looking after your needs.

03:39.718 --> 03:43.755
Now I have told them I love flowers
because I don't take anything else.

03:43.860 --> 03:48.900
So, you must see whenever I come My house is so
filled with flowers that My husband was saying,

03:48.900 --> 03:52.360
"Let us go and live in the garden
and let the flowers be here."

03:54.960 --> 04:00.180
So, you see, the joy of
giving comes from this center.

04:01.320 --> 04:12.360
And whatever you eat, whatever you have
to eat, whatever is good for you, you eat.

04:13.020 --> 04:16.620
You don't have to bother as to
what to eat, what not to eat.

04:16.620 --> 04:20.640
You just eat whatever is good
for you, benevolent for you.

04:20.640 --> 04:26.400
You become so wise. And also you please others.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.780
You don't displease others by saying
"this is bad food, I want that."

04:30.780 --> 04:32.820
"I want" goes away.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.445
What do you want?

04:38.520 --> 04:46.560
So the - like you could say a candle which is
not enlightened, is waiting to be enlightened,

04:48.180 --> 04:51.780
is asking for the light, "I want light".

04:52.380 --> 04:59.460
But once it is enlightened, it gives light
to others, automatically; supposed to be.

04:59.460 --> 05:08.340
In the same way you also start giving your light,
your love, your joy to others, automatically.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.560
I don't have to tell you.

05:10.560 --> 05:15.120
Nobody has to go through any
Ten Commandments anymore.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.082
Those days are gone.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.740
Now automatically you become like that.

05:20.400 --> 05:34.380
Very beautiful people, very
affectionate and glorious, I should say.

05:34.380 --> 05:40.740
If you see the glow on the face of
Sahaja Yogis, the face itself is radiant.

05:42.300 --> 05:46.908
Many people drop out their ten
years to twenty years in their age.

05:47.100 --> 05:53.115
And they are so enthusiastic, never get tired.
