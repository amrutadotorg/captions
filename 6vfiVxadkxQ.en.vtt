00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:13.458
What's in? Come on, who is going to play that?

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:14.667
That's great.

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:16.208
Sit down. Sit down.

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:21.625
Ah, the roses are growing in sizes. Do you see that?

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:24.667
Yogi: Huge, Mataji. They are huge.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.542
But they are growing in sizes.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.667
Your vibrations I think.

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.208
All right. So now.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.667
I'm sorry we, we had to do this sully, [dumb] thing today.

00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:45.333
And because situations

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:50.500
with the situations one has to exist,

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:52.291
that is what is the situation is today.

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:55.709
I may  not be able to come back for Krishna Puja

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:57.500
Navaratri

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.959
but - Navaratri, sorry, Navaratri

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
May not be, may be, I can't say.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:04.959
But whatever it is.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.208
We should have a little Puja.

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.667
That's what was the desire.

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.458
So we will do it.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.083
Now, only you, you have not much time.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:21.542
But you can say the mantras

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.208
and somebody can just wash My Feet

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:25.417
and then My hands.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.375
You see it takes about five minutes to wash the Feet.

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:31.417
Yogi: Should we say Your hudred and eight names?

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.417
There's a translation in English.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.417
That we will. All right.

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:40.125
If you think so. But I think better is to say mantras, it's better,

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.625
The mantras of the chakras, you see.

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:46.291
It is better to say because

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.458
That also it's very important to say the mantras of the chakras

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:50.500
Yogi: From the beginning?

00:01:50.625 --> 00:01:51.959
No from the end, [yes]

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.667
So you say one and then repeat from one to another.

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:06.625
Now, start it.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:07.999
Yogi: We can start with Shri Ganesha.

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:09.625
Ganesha, Shri Ganesha.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.125
Yogi: Three times, Shri Ganesha

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:13.041
Yes, yes.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.875
Just start pouring the water.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.208

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.542

00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:14.208
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.917
Now, Krishna, Shri Krishna.

00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:22.542
Yogi: Shri Krishna, une fois.

00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:28.375
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:32.417
Shri Krishna Sakshat

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:36.792
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

00:06:37.208 --> 00:06:43.083
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:45.125
Now, Shri Rama.

00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:47.083
Yogi: Shri Rama

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.417
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:56.166
Shri Rama Sakshat

00:06:56.792 --> 00:07:00.667
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.750
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:08.125
Now, Shiva.

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:09.750
Yogi: Shri Shiva.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.959
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.750
Shri Shiva Sakshat

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:23.125
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

00:07:23.625 --> 00:07:29.417
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:33.417
Now... Jesus.

00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:34.917
Yogi: Shri Jesus.

00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:40.417
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:44.250
Shri Jesus Sakshat

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:48.583
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:53.959
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:55.083
Now, Virata.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.625
Yogi: Shri Virata, une fois.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:02.542
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.333
Shri VirataSakshat

00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:10.875
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

00:08:11.166 --> 00:08:16.999
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:08:17.417 --> 00:08:18.083
Omkara.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.333
Yogi: Shri Omkara.

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:25.166
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:29.208
Shri Omkara Sakshat

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:33.458
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:38.917
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:40.583
Now, Kalki.

00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:46.375
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:50.291
Shri Kalki Sakshat

00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:54.667
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

00:08:55.083 --> 00:09:00.834
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:09:01.542 --> 00:09:02.792
Now, Nirmala.

00:09:04.625 --> 00:09:08.834
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:09:09.291 --> 00:09:12.750
Shri Nirmala Sakshat

00:09:13.417 --> 00:09:17.208
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:22.583
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:09:22.709 --> 00:09:26.041
Now say the Sahasrara's mantras. Three.

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:27.709
Sahasrara Swamini

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.333
Moksha Pradayini

00:09:29.542 --> 00:09:31.041
Sahaja Yoga Dayini.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.041
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:09:37.333 --> 00:09:41.542
Shri Sahasrara Swamini

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:46.208
Moksha Pradayini Mataji

00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:52.041
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:53.166
Sahaja Yoga Dayini.

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:58.250
Om Twameva Sakshat

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:04.417
Shri Sahaja Yoga Dayini Sakshat

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:08.792
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:14.917
Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:20.125
Now, after saying all these mantras

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:23.709
You have reached up to Sahasrara

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:28.250
and you have also pierced through the Sahasrara.

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:34.500
The most effective mantra you know, is Nirmala.

00:10:35.542 --> 00:10:38.458
And that works the best for Sahasrara.

00:10:39.166 --> 00:10:43.375
Now, one thing we must know, if somebody's Sahasrara is catching,

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:45.792
then such a person should be avoided.

00:10:46.917 --> 00:10:50.792
It is very easy to find out a person who catches Sahasrara.

00:10:51.208 --> 00:10:54.208
We are not here to denounce anyone or to say "no" to anyone.

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:56.125
But you'll be amazed

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:58.125
if you come in contact with some of these people,

00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:00.999
if you are not fully matured, you do catch.

00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:03.458
And you start changing your temperament,

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:05.166
your nature, everything.

00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:11.041
Now, for that we must understand anybody who is catching Sahasrara,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.291
must be avoided.

00:11:14.542 --> 00:11:17.250
There is nothing to feel bad, just tell that person

00:11:17.583 --> 00:11:19.500
that "your Sahasrara is catching

00:11:19.792 --> 00:11:23.000
and the best thing is that you clear out your Sahasrara".

00:11:23.709 --> 00:11:25.667
If your Sahasrara is catching that means

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:27.500
"there is a barrier between you and our Mother,

00:11:27.625 --> 00:11:29.500
and we don't want to know about you".

00:11:29.792 --> 00:11:32.250
So, for the time being till you clear your Sahasrara

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.542
you better not come to the ashram,

00:11:35.834 --> 00:11:37.458
better not come to the programme.

00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:38.583
Clear out yourself.

00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:41.375
Let us see if your Sahasrara it's cleared out.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:44.625
I did not meet Martha but if you can pass them the thing

00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:47.709
that both of them were catching on their Sahasrara

00:11:47.999 --> 00:11:51.792
when they came to the programme in India.

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:55.458
And they informed Me that their Sahasrara is very badly catching.

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:57.583
Actually I did not know what they were doing here,

00:11:57.792 --> 00:11:59.875
what was the problem till her letter came to Me.

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:02.500
But this is the main thing and not to feel bad

00:12:02.709 --> 00:12:05.166
because if your Sahasrara is catching and you come here

00:12:05.542 --> 00:12:07.583
then what happens you cannot improve

00:12:07.834 --> 00:12:09.417
because the bhoots won't leave you.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:11.999
And also the people who are here will be affected.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.959
So, one thing one should remember, even her daughter-in-law

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.750
I must say you must avoid her.

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:21.000
Like I know I shouldn't say this but her daughter-in-law was

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.417
very much catching on the Sahasrara the other day I saw her.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:24.875
So she has to be careful.

00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:27.583
You should not tell her in a way that

00:12:27.792 --> 00:12:29.458
she should feel hurt, in any way, nothing.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:31.166
I mean not that she's bad.

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:33.041
She's a good person, all of them are good.

00:12:33.417 --> 00:12:35.250
But if the Sahasrara is catching

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:37.667
she might be catching for Martha, she can be.

00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:40.542
But she must clear it out by getting out of Martha

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:42.667
because this is one thing we have to remember

00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:44.834
that ashram must be kept pure.

00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:47.250
Ashram must be kept pure.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.750
Then I would say that also Briggite,

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:52.000
your son, elder son, has a problem.

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:56.834
You better look after him and be, completely be in charge.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.333
See how he behaves, because he has got something from his father,

00:13:00.583 --> 00:13:01.917
which must be taken out.

00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:03.041
So you look after him.

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.208
There is, what we have to do, everybody has to improve and improve.

00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:10.792
Another is Andre. Andre you still you are not all right.

00:13:10.999 --> 00:13:13.500
So you  have to put your left hand towards the photograph

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.375
with the light and put your right hand to the Mother Earth.

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:19.917
You see, if there are people who do not improve they should give up

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:21.375
because we cannot work it out.

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.875
So you please put your left hand towards the photograph

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:25.458
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.834
They should all improve.

00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:29.667
And no use talking to other people because they catch

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:31.999
and they get into trouble.

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:34.333
So what's the use of troubling others?

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:36.959
The best is that you cure yourself, you should be all right.

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:41.041
There is no hatred, there is no anger, there's nothing.

00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:43.333
It is just a simple understanding

00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:45.333
that just now there is an infection within us.

00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:46.750
We should keep out from others.

00:13:46.999 --> 00:13:51.291
In Japan, if you go, even you may be the president of any place.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.375
You see, one president of this Akai fellow, he came to see Me.

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:59.834
He had a big bandage just like a, I don't know, like Hanumana,

00:14:00.083 --> 00:14:00.709
you see, big thing here.

00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:02.959
I said, "What is this?". I felt very funny.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:04.125
You see, he came to see Me all the way

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.999
You see, a VIP, this that and here you come with that.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.600
He said, "I'm sorry, I've got cold. I don't want to give you."

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:12.750
Yogi: Sensitive.

00:14:12.959 --> 00:14:14.125
Very sensible.

00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:21.917
So in a way it is to be understood that we have been catching,

00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:24.125
we have been doing wrong,

00:14:24.291 --> 00:14:27.583
in the sense that we are meeting people when we are catching.

00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:30.625
So see that your Sahasraras are kept clear.

00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:32.333
For that is very simple.

00:14:32.542 --> 00:14:34.959
You see I've seen miracles happening to people

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.375
when they know how to surrender entirely.

00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:39.417
But if there is barrier in the heart,

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:41.000
the heart is not clean, you see,

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.542
then Sahasrara catches.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.667
Because you know, it is heart chakra.

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:47.000
It is so made that is the heart chakra.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.583
From the heart you must get to it.

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:52.041
So that put Me in your heart,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.875
put Me in your heart. It will work out.

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:56.667
But these people who are just on the periphery catch

00:14:56.875 --> 00:14:57.875
very much from others.

00:14:58.083 --> 00:15:00.250
So be careful not to catch.

00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:03.000
If you catch try to beat yourself with shoes

00:15:03.208 --> 00:15:05.125
or do something to get yourself all right.

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:08.999
And everybody should work it out that way so that you ascend.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.959
If your quality improves a lot then there will be no problem.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.166
Then another thing I've told here

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:17.709
that there are many old people who come to program.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:20.125
So I've told Arneau, I've told all of you

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:27.917
that let Jaqueline and yeah, our Genevieve

00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:30.083
and Madeleine, and all these people,

00:15:30.291 --> 00:15:32.834
elderly people should all join together.

00:15:33.041 --> 00:15:36.500
All join together, you look after them, talk to them.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.917
Also eledrly men should join together

00:15:39.083 --> 00:15:40.917
to talk to them because they like to talk,

00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:44.291
come round, and this thing. They don't trust young people.

00:15:44.583 --> 00:15:45.875
So you be careful on that.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.333
And it will be very helpful if you can

00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:53.250
first let them talk, let them take charge

00:15:53.458 --> 00:15:55.166
and then gradually come to this.

00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:58.834
And there will be some very good news coming to you

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:00.125
about the ashram, I'm sure.

00:16:00.417 --> 00:16:02.250
I bless you. May God bless you.

00:16:02.417 --> 00:16:04.917
Try to be in the ashram at least for two three weeks,

00:16:05.083 --> 00:16:06.750
so that you learn certain disciplines.

00:16:06.875 --> 00:16:08.667
And disciplines must be maintaned.

00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:10.333
Do not challenge Arneau for that.

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:13.083
You must discipline yourself, there is an emergency,

00:16:13.291 --> 00:16:16.999
and your disciplined life will tell everybody else that

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:18.166
it is going to work

00:16:18.375 --> 00:16:21.583
You should not side with your sister, brother or anyone.

00:16:21.792 --> 00:16:23.959
You must side with the Divine.

00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:26.959
So that you can cure brother, sister, everyone.

00:16:27.166 --> 00:16:32.458
So try to work it out this way, that the whole thing cleanses.

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.041
Mother is cleaning you all the time.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:36.041
Morning till evening I'm doing nothing but cleansing.

00:16:36.458 --> 00:16:39.500
But you also should do some cleansing, isn't it?

00:16:39.917 --> 00:16:40.999
That's very important.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.917
So now I take your leave.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.917
And there's, this is vibrated water.

00:16:47.083 --> 00:16:48.917
You can use it for whatever you like.

00:16:49.166 --> 00:16:52.041
I will vibrate that with My hand. [I won't be able to wash it.]

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:55.166
My hands with that.

00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:59.834
And this one here, yes, this one you put it here. Just put it.

00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.542
No, no, you put all that in here.

00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:07.625
Yogi: In the, in the big one?

00:17:07.834 --> 00:17:09.041
Yes.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.083
No, no, no, no. This, all this.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.333
This water can be removed.

00:17:18.542 --> 00:17:20.999
Yogi: Shri Mataji can we just put a garland on You? Just...

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.667
Yes, yes, while going I'll take it.

00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.917
Can you bring some pot like this?

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:31.583
Something to wash My hands.

00:17:39.709 --> 00:17:42.999
Now some ladies should open the sari only to Me.

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:45.166
This sari has put a bondage on Me.

00:17:47.917 --> 00:17:50.041
Some seven ladies. Married ladies.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.750
You give a sari to them and you take a fruit in that.

00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:10.500
First let Me wash this you see, that is important.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:11.834
Did you bring a pot?

00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:16.500
That's too small.

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:23.583
That's it...

00:18:25.625 --> 00:18:27.000
Just open. Look at this.

00:18:27.208 --> 00:18:29.667
This is also you people are so lucky to get it.

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.125
You got it so cheap, do you know?

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:33.083
We paid eight hundred rupees for this sari.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:35.083
Yogi: Seven hundread, Shri Mataji.

00:18:35.458 --> 00:18:37.709
You can't believe it, you can't belive it, you see.

00:18:37.999 --> 00:18:40.125
You can't get it for less than three thousands.

00:18:41.583 --> 00:18:44.750
You are people so lucky, you have no idea how lucky you are.

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:46.166
Just imagine.

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.959
Can you get such a sari?

00:18:48.375 --> 00:18:50.208
The other way round. Just show them.

00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:52.000
Now put it on Me.

00:18:53.041 --> 00:18:54.458
Put everything on My hands.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.208
Ghee a little. Little bit ghee. Little.

00:18:57.709 --> 00:19:01.792
Just a bit. Just a bit. That's all.

00:19:03.875 --> 00:19:04.999
Now put all the...

00:19:06.291 --> 00:19:09.583
Yogi: Curd? All of it?

00:19:09.834 --> 00:19:10.667
Yes, yes.

00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:16.834
Now put that.

00:19:18.792 --> 00:19:20.583
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:19:22.709 --> 00:19:24.208
You have more curd, na?

00:19:24.375 --> 00:19:25.250
Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:19:25.417 --> 00:19:27.166
You have to put more curd.

00:19:29.041 --> 00:19:33.166
Yes, it's all right. Now you pour it, the other.

00:19:33.583 --> 00:19:34.583
Yogi: Milk?

00:19:34.792 --> 00:19:36.125
Milk, it's all right.

00:19:42.959 --> 00:19:44.750
The other should be this side.

00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:54.542
Now, water.

00:19:57.999 --> 00:20:01.166
See the sari. This is your luck I tell you.

00:20:03.792 --> 00:20:06.750
I mean your wedding saris we bought

00:20:06.999 --> 00:20:08.458
compared to that, look at this.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:18.875
You be careful with mixing up with people.

00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:20.667
You shouldn't come.

00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:22.875
This is not all right. Get somebody else. All right?

00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:24.291
I'm sorry but it is so.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.375
Don't get friendly with her.

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:28.709
You see, it's a fraternity of bhoots.

00:20:28.959 --> 00:20:31.750
If there is a slightest bhoot in you it will combine another bhoot.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.375
She will go down, you will go down.

00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:35.208
Try to keep with positive people.

00:20:37.834 --> 00:20:40.125
Annie how are you? You are not all right.

00:20:40.709 --> 00:20:42.041
What's the matter with you?

00:20:47.583 --> 00:20:49.999
Why? Les miserable?

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:52.375
Even more.

00:20:52.959 --> 00:20:54.083
I don't know why it is so.

00:20:54.208 --> 00:20:57.208
You should improve, you should see your vibrations, work it out.

00:20:57.375 --> 00:20:58.999
You see so many years you have been with Me.

00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:00.375
What will people think?

00:21:17.166 --> 00:21:20.667
Now next time I'm not going to see such faces, all right?

00:21:20.792 --> 00:21:22.500
Everybody like a flower.

00:21:23.834 --> 00:21:25.125
What makes you look like that?

00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:30.166
Work it out, see your vibrations, you know it very well.

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:33.333
Work it out. Marie has improved so much, you see.

00:21:34.208 --> 00:21:35.834
What about you? You should improve also.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.417
You have such a nice husband.

00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:40.208
Or you are quarreling with him?

00:21:41.125 --> 00:21:43.250
Are you? All right.

00:21:43.834 --> 00:21:45.000
It should work out I think.

00:21:46.375 --> 00:21:49.542
You go on the right side too much, you think too much.

00:21:49.709 --> 00:21:51.583
You think too much. So just say Nirvichara,

00:21:51.792 --> 00:21:53.375
it's the mantra for you, Nirvichara.

00:21:53.709 --> 00:21:56.166
And for her, Vivian.

00:21:56.417 --> 00:21:59.417
Vivian, you must say the mantra of Sahasrara, all right?

00:21:59.709 --> 00:22:01.834
Om Twameva Sakshat Sahasrara Swamini. It will work out.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.333
Still it is catching little bit,

00:22:03.542 --> 00:22:05.959
but it will work out. You are much better, no doubt.

00:22:08.542 --> 00:22:09.333
All right.

00:22:11.583 --> 00:22:12.625
Bring it slowly.

00:22:19.542 --> 00:22:20.917
You have to put some rice.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.125
No, I think you have to put it this way.

00:22:37.208 --> 00:22:38.333
Ha, good.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.041
Yogini: Rice, if You want to put it.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:47.999
Ah?

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:49.500
Yogini: They went for rice, Shri Mataji.

00:22:49.625 --> 00:22:50.166
Pardon?

00:22:50.375 --> 00:22:52.500
Yogini: They went for rice. [unclear] with the rice.

00:23:00.083 --> 00:23:04.542
Put the garland now.

00:23:05.417 --> 00:23:08.667
But then rice should be fast because I take that...

00:23:17.542 --> 00:23:20.333
Everybody has improved, you see. Marie, might be an example,

00:23:20.583 --> 00:23:22.250
from where she has improved to what?

00:23:22.542 --> 00:23:24.250
There are people, tremendous people you have here

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.999
who have improved themselves with full confidence in themselves.

00:23:28.166 --> 00:23:30.417
Martin has improved so much. Everybody has improved.

00:23:31.083 --> 00:23:32.875
Even she has improved so.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.041
And Antoinette I'm very happy to see you this way.

00:23:38.333 --> 00:23:40.750
She's so much confident, she's so sensible now.

00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:42.750
Everybody must improve.

00:23:45.999 --> 00:23:46.834
All right.

00:23:51.417 --> 00:23:53.333
I'll try to arrange for your chidren

00:23:53.542 --> 00:23:58.333
if they can be looked after in some place in India,

00:23:58.583 --> 00:24:00.667
then those who have children can also travel.

00:24:00.875 --> 00:24:03.959
I'll try. Although I don't promise but I'll try.

00:24:04.166 --> 00:24:05.208
Hello, Shakti.

00:24:07.959 --> 00:24:09.166
May God bless you.

00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:11.500
So now, where is the garland?

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.458
Beautiful.

00:24:23.583 --> 00:24:24.417
It's very beautiful.

00:24:25.834 --> 00:24:26.875
May God bless you.

00:24:27.834 --> 00:24:29.417
Now take a photograph.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.500
Everything to order.

00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:34.834
In this short time what to do?

00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:36.959
You cannot do much, you see, is as much as it is.

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:39.000
That's the problem.

00:24:40.083 --> 00:24:41.834
Give her the photograph of Sahasrara.

00:24:42.375 --> 00:24:43.999
Another thing I found out

00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:46.667
if you can get the photograph of My feet,

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.375
which are nicely exposed,

00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:49.999
you put it on the ground,

00:24:50.583 --> 00:24:55.834
bow to it and look at it without thinking.

00:24:56.125 --> 00:24:57.959
That's a very good way of progressing.

00:24:58.125 --> 00:24:59.333
That's a surrender, all right?

00:25:10.458 --> 00:25:14.709
Yogi: Complete Puja, Shri Mataji.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.959
Fast. You see, you are very speedy people.

00:25:22.041 --> 00:25:25.125
For India, they take four and a half hours.

00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:28.542
And Switzerland only ten fifteen minutes to do this.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.959
They are very speedy, you see. Telescopic.

00:25:31.125 --> 00:25:33.750
Yogi: You should say that Shri Mataji to the Indian Sahaja Yogis

00:25:33.959 --> 00:25:37.125
who will be scold when You come to India, Shri Mataji.

00:25:37.333 --> 00:25:41.166
No, no. They know that things can be very much,

00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:44.709
complete effect is there. That's the main point.

00:25:59.166 --> 00:26:00.875
Oh, let it be, let it be. Don't you worry.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.542
This is the flower of dathura we call it. Is a...

00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:14.166
Like that, which is used for, little away,

00:26:14.375 --> 00:26:16.500
so that for Feet can be seen also.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:17.999
The Feet must be seen.

00:26:35.709 --> 00:26:38.041
That sari did you keep or not for the background?

00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:41.166
I put it inside the one he liked.

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:43.542
Yogini: Oh, it's in the bag Shri Mataji.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.583
I will take it out.

00:26:47.083 --> 00:26:49.291
If she'll use it for a background, good idea.

00:26:51.333 --> 00:26:53.667
Yogi: Shri Mataji, we could, if the photograph it's good,

00:26:53.875 --> 00:26:55.999
we could enlarge it because it is on the green,

00:26:56.166 --> 00:26:57.750
green color Your Feet.

00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:00.834
It's tremendous with the flowers, Shri Mataji.

00:27:01.458 --> 00:27:02.417
Should be nice.

00:27:02.792 --> 00:27:05.000
All right, take it one more. Good one.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.291
Let it be, need not be there flowers, need not be.

00:27:09.458 --> 00:27:12.041
All right, doesn't matter they show, as long as My Feet show.

00:27:12.375 --> 00:27:15.583
It's all right. [Now see. Don't put] Pull this out a little.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.999
Good.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.208
If you look at Them there's no swelling, you see?

00:27:37.375 --> 00:27:38.750
There's no swelling at all.

00:27:41.542 --> 00:27:42.792
All right. Take it here.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:46.959
Yogi: I don't know if I can, Shri Mataji, pushing them.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.667
All right. May God bless you all.

00:28:13.083 --> 00:28:16.166
It was very enjoyable, intense and beautiful

00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:17.875
and I don't know how the time passed.

00:28:18.875 --> 00:28:21.834
You all enjoyed. So be kind to everyone, be nice to everyone,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.917
and don't say harsh words when you are with other people.

00:28:29.625 --> 00:28:31.583
And Mona what about you? Are you all right?

00:28:31.999 --> 00:28:34.041
You still go up and down.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:35.166
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

00:28:35.333 --> 00:28:36.750
Now you study yourself.

00:28:36.999 --> 00:28:40.041
You have to become into Nirvikalpa. You see the boat is leaving.

00:28:41.208 --> 00:28:42.375
The boat is leaving.

00:28:43.125 --> 00:28:44.583
You have to come to Nirvikalpa.

00:28:44.917 --> 00:28:45.500
What's that?

00:28:45.709 --> 00:28:48.333
Yogini: From myself [?] Shri Mataji, to match with the tea set.

00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:52.250
From [name] handmade to match with the tea set.

00:28:52.458 --> 00:28:54.917
So you bring it with the tea set, all right?

00:28:55.125 --> 00:28:58.333
So sweet of you to have given Me that tea set, really.

00:28:58.542 --> 00:29:01.875
So sweet, it's so precious. I don't think I'll ever use it.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.250
Is too good, too good to be used

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.250
too sweet. So beautiful. I mean what an idea.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.083
What an idea.

00:29:16.125 --> 00:29:17.625
And the sari?

00:29:18.125 --> 00:29:19.625
Yogini: If you put in your bag Shri Mataji?

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.875
All right. And take out that another sari, all right?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.709
Very well, Shri Mataji.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:38.750
You feel very sad, isn't it?

00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:43.875
I'll feel very sad, leaving you all here.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.667
But we are going to meet for Guru Puja.

00:29:46.917 --> 00:29:47.999
At least make it for Guru Puja.

00:29:48.166 --> 00:29:51.000
All of you should be there for Guru Puja, all right?

00:29:54.333 --> 00:29:57.083
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could we sing Your aarti while you are leaving?

00:29:57.417 --> 00:29:59.792
Yogi: Could we sing Your aarti while You are leaving?

00:30:00.083 --> 00:30:02.625
All right, sing.

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:59.917
Aum Twameva Sakshat

00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:11.166

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:17.166

Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.

00:36:32.083 --> 00:36:33.709
May God bless you.

00:36:44.417 --> 00:36:47.999
Yogi: Shri Mataji, we all the Sahaja Yogis here,

00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:50.667
we pray to You and we promise You

00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:55.917
that we will be one, just one flower,

00:36:56.208 --> 00:36:58.709
so that when You can see us,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:06.458
You will see only one flower, one color, one perfume,

00:37:06.959 --> 00:37:11.709
and one flower offered at Your Divine Lotus Feet.

00:37:12.041 --> 00:37:18.500
And we pray Shri Mataji in our heart that Your Divine Lotus Feet

00:37:18.875 --> 00:37:25.333
will dwell forever in our beings. Amen. Jai Shri Mataji.

00:37:25.542 --> 00:37:27.458
Jai Shri Mataji.

00:37:50.583 --> 00:37:52.458
I want to thank you all very much

00:37:52.667 --> 00:37:54.667
for the gifts, [Didier] for your gift and others,

00:37:54.917 --> 00:37:56.250
all those who have given Me gifts

00:37:56.458 --> 00:37:59.125
thank you very much for all that. May God bless you.

00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:04.583
Now enjoy yourself.

00:38:04.999 --> 00:38:07.250
Hope to see you all very soon.

00:38:07.999 --> 00:38:09.917
I'm going with a heavy heart

00:38:10.083 --> 00:38:15.792
but I hope at Guru Puja it will be all cleared out.

00:38:16.375 --> 00:38:18.709
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
