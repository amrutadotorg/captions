1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:09,250
With love all kinds of creative action takes
place.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:20,940
You see how Raulbai has love for Me and in
this place you all also got new idea of creating

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,030
a beautiful thing.

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:30,020
And as love will increase, your creativity
will develop.

5
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,680
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati,
is love.

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,420
If there is no love there’s no creativity.

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,579
It’s even in the deeper sense, you see.

8
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:52,260
People who have created all the scientific
things are also out of love for the masses,

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,720
not for themselves.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,550
Nobody has produced anything for themselves.

11
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:01,600
If they make something for themselves it has
to become for universal use, otherwise it

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,239
has no meaning.

13
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,789
Even if you say atom bomb and all these things
that are created from science, they are also

14
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:09,819
very protective.

15
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:14,969
If they had not created those, people would
not have taken out their minds from war.

16
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,119
Now, nobody can think of having a big war.

17
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,350
Of course, they are having cold wars, but
that also will gradually stop, when they will

18
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,350
be fed up.

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,969
So, all the activity on the right hand side,
of Saraswati, basically has to end up in love.

20
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,689
Starts with love and ends up in love.

21
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,590
Whichever does not end up in love coils up
and finishes off.

22
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,810
It just disappears.

23
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:48,049
So you can see that even matter, which is
not used for love, just finishes off.

24
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,490
The basis has to be love.

25
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,099
Otherwise all such matter that we create which
has angularity, which is not fitting into

26
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:02,329
the mass media which is not appealing to the
masses.

27
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:10,069
Of course, it takes time, you have seen that
it takes time - but it does have that tendency

28
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:15,269
always to disappear in the thin air as soon
as you find it does not appeal to the masses.

29
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:24,590
Now this love of, that we talk of, this great
love of God we talk of, we know it for definite

30
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,689
through vibrations.

31
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:33,060
People do not have vibrations, but still they
can feel the vibrations in a very unconscious

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,060
way.

33
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,390
All the great paintings of the world have
vibrations.

34
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,010
All the great creative works of the world
have vibrations.

35
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:47,800
Only those who have vibrations have been sustained
by time, otherwise all other things are destroyed.

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,370
There must have been monuments and horrible
statues and horrible things that have been

37
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,239
created long time back.

38
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:02,359
But they were all destroyed by nature, and
they could not stand the impact of the Kala

39
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:06,099
- that is the destructive power of time.

40
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:16,620
So, all that is sustaining, all that is nurturing,
all that is en-nobling, comes from this sense

41
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:24,140
of love, which is within us very much developed,
but within others also, who are not yet realized.

42
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:30,349
Ultimately the whole world has to realize
that one has to go to that ultimate love of

43
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:32,819
God, otherwise it has no meaning.

44
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,770
Now you have seen in art people have taken
to other methods of appealing to people by

45
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,230
using cheap things and very vulgar things,
just to make people think that this is art.

46
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,110
But this will all disappear.

47
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:52,280
It cannot sustain the impact of the time as
I told you, it cannot.

48
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,569
Because the time will kill it.

49
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:57,720
All these things have to disappear and already
you can see the result, how things are changing

50
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,580
everywhere, even in the West.

51
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,870
So there is no need to be so much disappointed
with the West and to say that the Western

52
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,109
world is a wasteland.

53
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:11,060
It is going to be alright and it has to be
done.

54
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,070
Especially it has done lot of Puja of Saraswati,
I should say, in the West.

55
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,220
Much more than they have done in India because
they have gone to learning and they have tried

56
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,010
to find out so many things.

57
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,760
But only thing they forgot that it is a Goddess,
Goddess of Learning.

58
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,800
Everything comes from the Goddess.

59
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,440
That’s what they’ve forgotten.

60
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,630
And that’'s why all the problems have been
created.

61
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,610
If there is no Spirit in your learning, if
there is no source of the Goddess in your

62
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,790
learning, then it is absolutely useless.

63
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:46,540
If they had realized that there is the Spirit
that is working it out, they would not have

64
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,060
gone that far.

65
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,440
And that’s what I was warning the Indians,
all through, that you are now taking to industrial

66
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,312
revolution in a way and to avoid all the complications
of industrial revolution, you must try to

67
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:03,290
know the Spirit.

68
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:08,640
If you do not know the Spirit you will have
the same problems as these people have.

69
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,690
Because they are also human beings, you are
also human beings.

70
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,540
You will also go the same way.

71
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,720
At random you will run and there will be problems,
the same problems as the Western people have.

72
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,110
Now Saraswati's blessings are so many that
one cannot describe in such a short time.

73
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,530
And the Surya has given us so many powers
that it is impossible to tell them even in

74
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,090
one lecture, even in ten lectures.

75
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,900
But how we go against Surya and how we go
against Saraswati, while doing the worship

76
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,810
of Saraswati, is to be seen very clearly within
ourselves.

77
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,920
For example the Western people are very fond
of Surya because they have no Surya.

78
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,930
But they go too far with it, as you know,
and create complications within themselves

79
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,550
of Surya.

80
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:05,590
But the main thing that one has to achieve
through Surya is the light within, is the

81
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,890
light within.

82
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:17,340
And if Surya chakra at the Agnya level is
occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then it is even

83
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:28,600
more essential that the purity of life, what
we call ‘Niti’, is the morality of life.

84
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,490
Now morality itself has become very much sort
of an argument in the West.

85
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,960
People don't have any sense of absolute morality.

86
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,800
On vibrations of course you know.

87
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,120
But they have gone all against it.

88
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,690
Those who are worshippers of Jesus, those
who are the worshippers of the Surya, of the

89
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,880
Saraswati have all gone against it.

90
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,330
Against the powers of Surya, just disobeying
it.

91
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:08,270
Because you cannot be a Surya if you do not
have a proper sense of morality and holiness.

92
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:14,480
The Surya itself brings light, to see everything
clearly.

93
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,050
So many qualities Surya has got.

94
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,240
It dries up everything that is wet, dirty,
filthy.

95
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,900
It dries up all these places, which create
parasites.

96
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,170
But so many parasites are created in the West.

97
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,340
Not only parasites, but there are horrible
cults and horrible things which have come

98
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:45,680
into those countries which are supposed to
be full of light, and in that darkness they

99
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
exist.

100
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:55,930
Darkness about their Spirit, darkness about
their own knowledge and darkness about love.

101
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:01,120
These three things have taken over in the
places where you are supposed to love light.

102
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,870
Light doesn’t mean, light doesn’t mean
what you see with your gross eyes.

103
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,390
Light means from within - the Light of Love.

104
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,390
That one should understand – Light of Love.

105
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:20,240
And it is so soothing, it’s so sweet, it’s
so beautiful, it’s so enamouring, it’s

106
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,221
so abounding that unless and until you can
feel that light within you - that light which

107
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:33,529
is of pure love of purity, pure relationships,
pure understanding.

108
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:45,800
If you can develop that kind of a light within
yourself, then the whole thing will be cleansed.

109
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,270
'Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.'

110
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:54,530
This is what happens to you when you are completely
cleansed.

111
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,930
The purest form of nature is within us.

112
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,200
The purest form of nature is within us.

113
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,270
Our chakras are made out of that purest form
of nature.

114
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:13,910
We are the only people who are spoiling it
by our mental thinking, against the same Saraswati’s

115
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,910
power.

116
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,150
You are going against Saraswati itself.

117
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:24,960
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,
while, with our brain activity, we are spoiling

118
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,250
all that.

119
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,450
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.

120
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:40,500
And that’s what one has to understand - that
this pure intelligence, is not to be soiled

121
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
by our thinking.

122
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,160
Our thinking can make us so bumptious, so
ego-oriented, so impure, that, we can really

123
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:58,070
eat the poison and say 'what is wrong with
it'?

124
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,040
Just the opposite of Saraswati.

125
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,520
If Saraswati is within us, She gives us Subuddhi,
wisdom.

126
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,800
And that is why to worship Saraswati, to worship
Surya; we must have that clear vision as to

127
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,640
what we have to be.

128
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,860
What we are doing.

129
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,040
What filth we are living in.

130
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,220
What our mind is getting into.

131
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,390
After all we are here for emancipation and
not for just for pampering our ego and living

132
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,950
with our filth that is with us.

133
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:33,430
So this light has come within us and we should
try to rise above our own mental filth, which

134
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,070
is being created around us.

135
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:45,320
Apart from that, you have to go higher and
understand that there is, within us, a thing

136
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
called ego.

137
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
And this ego is false, absolutely false.

138
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,390
You do not do anything.

139
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:58,590
Actually when you turn your eyes here and
there, when your attention is here and there

140
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:04,120
it is nothing but your ego that is trying
to overpower you.

141
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:11,980
But actually ego is an absolute falsehood
because there is only one ego and that is

142
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,420
of God Almighty, Mahatahamkara.

143
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,861
There is no really any ego that exists.

144
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:20,861
It is myth.

145
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:26,080
It is a very big myth, because if you start
thinking you are doing everything - you are

146
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,150
doing this, you are doing that - which you
are not doing; then this nonsensical ego comes

147
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,580
in and you start working it out, it can project
in every direction.

148
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:43,430
When it projects forward, it overpowers others,
it tries to dominate others, tries to kill

149
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,830
others, becomes cruel.

150
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,350
When it moves [to the] right side, it becomes
supraconscious.

151
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,740
It starts seeing things, which are absurd,
which are foolish, which are stupid.

152
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:04,410
When it moves left side then it starts talking
- I mean, seeing things - yourself as a big

153
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:13,100
man, as a big Christ or as a big Devi or something
like Adi Gurus and 'I am a very great personality'

154
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,560
- that is left sided.

155
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,810
When it moves backwards, that is the dangerous
one.

156
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,330
When people become gurus, which are ruining
other people.

157
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,610
When their ego moves backwards then they become
gurus, they themselves have lots of defects

158
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:33,290
in themselves and they try to pull people
into those horrible stuff, which is described

159
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,020
as absolute Naraka.

160
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,310
That’s how, is the movement of ego on all
the sides.

161
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:47,730
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi
that is, to talk about themselves, is the

162
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,280
worst of all.

163
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,050
Whatever type of ego you may have, if you
start boasting about it and talking about

164
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:01,490
it, then it encircles, thickens the walls
of ego so much, that it is impossible to penetrate

165
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,490
into that.

166
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:09,121
Because such a person is completely satisfied
with himself and he believes that he is so.

167
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:14,800
And once he starts believing into a nonsense
like that, it's an impossibility, is an impossibility

168
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,440
to penetrate.

169
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,790
So, when you boast about these things or you
talk big, be careful.

170
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:27,440
You see, you know what I am, but how many
times do I say 'I am that'?

171
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,050
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous vibrations
for you.

172
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,839
But how many times do I say so?

173
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,720
At the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

174
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,540
But I don't say that.

175
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,730
If I say it loudly, I don't know what may
happen.

176
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,470
The whole thing might be blasted with that.

177
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,920
So, one has to understand that Mahatahamkara
is the one that acts, that works, that creates.

178
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,630
Sometimes I shout at you.

179
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,580
Immediately all the bhoots run away.

180
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,580
Just once I shout.

181
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,600
Yesterday, you saw all the bhoots that were
coughing, they all ran away.

182
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,920
Yesterday just I started.

183
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,690
So you should understand that now you are
a realized souls, you can also do the same.

184
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:10,139
Use your right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself,
‘‘Now will you please stop boasting, will

185
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,250
you stop talking all this nonsense, will you
stop showing off!''

186
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,970
Then it will stop.

187
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:24,610
Now this thickening takes place by people
who really are active.

188
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,670
Who want to do something about it, not that
they are not active.

189
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,730
They want to do it.

190
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,840
But they know only one way, is to act talkative.

191
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:39,470
They don't understand that there are inner
ways by which you control it much more.

192
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,520
Because they don't want to take to that, they
take to this talking.

193
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,610
And once they take to talking and they talk
about it, the whole power goes.

194
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,720
But if they do not talk about it and keep
it within themselves.

195
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,649
It’s alright, you can tell Me about your
experiences or anything, but if you start

196
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:05,300
telling others, and talking about it too much,
then the powers that you have got will all

197
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,710
be disappearing gradually.

198
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,960
And you will just come down to absolutely
lowest level.

199
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,830
So one should not too much talk that “I
have this power, I have this power” or “I

200
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:19,310
see this” or “I do this,” which is a
very wrong thing.

201
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,950
I warn you, don’t try to show off.

202
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,970
Yes, you can talk about My powers.

203
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,130
It is all right.

204
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,860
But don't try to talk about your powers.

205
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,600
When it comes, of course, to talk to somebody
who is a negative person or to tell somebody,

206
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,770
then you should say that “we”, not “I”.

207
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,670
“We” have, some of us have felt this power
within us.

208
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,670
We have seen people”.

209
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,529
It may be you only, but you need not say,
'I' have.

210
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,600
What you have to say is 'We'.

211
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,940
Then you become the Mahatahamkara.

212
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,440
When you say 'We', Yes some of us', 'we do'.

213
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,170
Like in Gregoire's book also I made it, I
saw to it, that he should not have many 'I's',

214
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,710
but he should have 'We'.

215
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,660
'We think', 'we do', 'we'.

216
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,250
Means, the whole collective being, the whole
collective organism, living organism of Sahaja

217
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,250
Yogis.

218
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:15,290
So if you say, 'yes, some of us have got it',
that means, you put yourself down, but put

219
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,590
all others above you.

220
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,591
Say: 'Yes, some of us have.

221
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:18,990
I know some people have this.'

222
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,410
That’'s the way one should do it.

223
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:28,550
Because if you have to overpower your ego,
you must allow it to spread into everybody

224
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,550
else.

225
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,240
That’s how you will make it perfectly all
right.

226
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Let it spread.

227
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,480
“We, all Sahaja Yogis, we all”.

228
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,649
But that pride is not there.

229
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:38,031
I've seen that pride is not there.

230
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,500
Still it is very individualistic.

231
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:47,000
If you start thinking, ''we Sahaja Yogis",
then what happens, that you become one personality,

232
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
one organization.

233
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,200
But the person will look down upon other people.

234
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,190
He will see that this person is low, that
person is higher, that person is there.

235
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,420
But he will not think 'We' the Sahaja Yogis,
how beautiful we are.

236
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,120
'We' the body of Sahaja Yoga, how beautiful
we are.

237
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:16,010
So always think in the words of 'we', so your
ego will become much less, much less, much

238
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,010
less.

239
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:23,600
And the same ego, which looked so funny and
absurd, will form tomorrow, the Ekadesha.

240
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,799
Today’s, individual ego will merge into
Ekadesha.

241
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,279
But we all must remember to say 'we' all time.

242
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,330
This is what is today's day, is a great day
for us to change, because the sun has changed

243
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,860
its mood, now.

244
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,139
Sun is coming this side.

245
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:52,269
So let us welcome the Sun, coming to the North
now, this way.

246
00:17:52,269 --> 00:17:59,590
And for Australians to say that though the
sun has gone, let us establish the Sun, the

247
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,539
domain of Sun, within ourselves.

248
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,519
Because Sun never disappears from our inside.

249
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:10,100
So that is how we have to take a mood by which
we should think of one personality, all of

250
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,850
us together, all of us together.

251
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:19,200
And anybody who tries to be something separate
or different, he will drop out.

252
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,620
I will drop him out.

253
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,440
Whatever it may be, it will drop out.

254
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,139
So you just don’t worry yourself, anybody
who tries to be singled out or anything.

255
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:32,960
Everybody must do whatever they like, to nurture
the whole, to help the whole, to emancipate

256
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,100
the whole.

257
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,210
But not to, in anyway, put anyone down.

258
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,240
Always.

259
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,659
Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga
is.

260
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,190
Sahaja Yoga only works in collectivity.

261
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,489
And the one who has developed this permeating
spirit, is a real Sahaja Yogi.

262
00:18:49,489 --> 00:18:51,279
Who has not, is not!

263
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:57,000
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have
nothing to say.

264
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,690
But this permeating personality, which moves
from places to places, whether, you talk or

265
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,690
not.

266
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,690
Like your Mother is.

267
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,059
Whether I meet you or not, makes no difference,
but I am permeating through all of you, by

268
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,139
little, little things, also, I am there with
you.

269
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:14,919
So like that, try to permeate into each other
and see the beauty.

270
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:19,269
And you’ll enjoy yourself the best because
that is the biggest thing.

271
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:22,460
That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved.

272
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,489
Because this ego you know makes you like a
nutshell and you just cannot have a rapport

273
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:35,259
with that beauty of permeation and just see
how the notes move into each other.

274
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:41,379
It will be a great idea today, it’s great
thing today [that] we are having Puja in Dhulia.

275
00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:43,760
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust.

276
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,610
And one day I had written in childhood, a
poem, I remember.

277
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:54,310
Very interesting poem it was - I don't know
where it is now - but which said that I want

278
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:58,989
to be like a dust particle which moves with
the wind.

279
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,179
It goes everywhere.

280
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:07,260
Can go, sit on the head of a king, or can
go and fall at the feet of someone.

281
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:13,630
And it can go and sit on a little flower,
and it can go and sit everywhere.

282
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,149
But I want to be a particle of dust.

283
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:21,289
That is fragrant, that is nourishing, that
is enlightening.

284
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:27,250
Like that, I had written a very beautiful
poem, I must have been about seven years of

285
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:33,629
age, I remember - 'To be a dust particle',
I remember that very clearly, long time back,

286
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:36,340
that I should be a dust particle.

287
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,059
So that I’ll permeate into people.

288
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:44,210
Which is a very big thing - to become a dust
particle of that kind.

289
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,499
Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes
{sounds like ‘enwavened’ but I don’t

290
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:54,539
think that’s a word – “enlightened”??},
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.

291
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:57,590
It’s such a great thing to be like that.

292
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,419
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.

293
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:06,980
At that young age, I had this idea of becoming
a dust particle and today just while talking

294
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:13,639
to you, I remembered that I wanted to be that,
and that is what this place is.

295
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,119
And Raulbai is like that.

296
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:21,669
She’s a very simple woman, very simple woman,
and she lives like a very simple person but

297
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:23,499
she has a sense of permeation.

298
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:27,580
And now there are so many Sahaja Yogis, yesterday
who came.

299
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,169
I am sure that they will take up, Sahaja Yoga,
very well.

300
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:37,940
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from Dhulia
now, and I am sure there are going to be more

301
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,940
people.

302
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,059
I hope you have met all of them.

303
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,539
Make friends with all of them.

304
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,409
Try to know them who they are.

305
00:21:43,409 --> 00:21:46,049
They may not know English - so get somebody
to translate.

306
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:49,700
Talk to them and be nice to them, be friendly
with them.

307
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,210
I wanted you to meet them for permeation.

308
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,859
You should know who are the people here, who
are in Nasik.

309
00:21:55,859 --> 00:22:00,440
Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja Yogis,
you see, who are in that particular place,

310
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,610
and when we go back we have only one or two
addresses.

311
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,210
It is not a good idea.

312
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,259
Try to see how many people there are.

313
00:22:06,259 --> 00:22:09,799
Ask questions about them, and all that.

314
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:15,559
This permeation is only possible when your
ego starts permeating all around, and this

315
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:22,279
is the way to overcome the problems of the
right side and that is how to worship Saraswati.

316
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:27,750
Because Saraswati has a Veena in Her hand
and that Veena is the primordial instrument,

317
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,600
which She plays like music, and the smusic
penetrates into the heart.

318
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,791
You don't know how it goes into you and how
it works out.

319
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:42,139
And that’'s how a person who is a Sahaja
Yogi should permeate - like music into other

320
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:43,139
people.

321
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:47,530
She has so many qualities, as I told you,
which cannot be described in one lecture.

322
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:55,840
But one of the greatest qualities of Hers
is that She ends up into subtler things.

323
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,249
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.

324
00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:08,359
Music will end up into melodies, like that
whatever She creates ends up into something

325
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,359
greater.

326
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,030
Matter, whatever She produces, ends up into
aesthetics.

327
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,029
If matter does not have aesthetics then it
is gross.

328
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:17,389
Like that everything.

329
00:23:17,389 --> 00:23:20,080
Now you will say what is water.

330
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,940
Water becomes the river Ganges.

331
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,789
These are the subtler things.

332
00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:31,909
So the matter gets into subtler thing because
it has to permeate, it has to permeate.

333
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:33,929
So everything whatever it is.

334
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:38,169
And the best of all is the air.

335
00:23:38,169 --> 00:23:44,249
That air becomes the vibrations.

336
00:23:44,249 --> 00:23:50,419
So you can see how, whatever has come out
from this matter, from these five elements,

337
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:52,779
becomes that subtle thing.

338
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:59,429
Of course, the left and right side both work
it out because the love has to work on this

339
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:09,090
and when love acts on matter it becomes that,
and that is how one has to look at your own

340
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:33,359
lives, to make it a beautiful combination

341
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:59,659
of 

342
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:15,919
love 
and matter.

343
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:56,749
May God bless you!
