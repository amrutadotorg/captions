00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.240
Today I want to talk to you about children

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.640
because yesterday we talked about the Mooladhara.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.480
Now why we are not so collective

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.600
as we should have been much more collective.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.160
There has been conditioning on us

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.280
from our early childhood, if you see.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.000
In the western life, we are shut in our houses.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.640
We don't have relationships with others.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.800
We are kept extremely protected in childhood.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.240
I think the parents have the fear in this country that we'll lose our children

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.040
because they get lost. After they start getting their [dough/roles?]

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.920
most of the children leave their parents and go away.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.040
Parents are left high and dry.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.080
They feel that our children will leave us at the slightest pretext.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.640
So they teach them not to talk to anyone, to be away from everyone

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.000
and cuddle their own children all the time, look after their own children

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.680
and they can't see a child talking to another lady.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.440
They feel jealous. And they feel that the child will be lost

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.520
because they think that they cannot give adequate love.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.680
If anybody can give love to their child they feel that that child will be lost.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.320
And the child also becomes such a individualistic child

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.000
that it takes life into a very particular type of a person

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.080
and then after some time

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.040
that person starts overpowering that child

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.360
and the parents leave the child.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.360
It's a very sick society in that way.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.400
As far as the children are concerned, it's a sick society.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.040
It doesn't know how to bring up their children.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.440
Just the opposite is in India, just the opposite.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.640
I think that's one of the reasons why Indians

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.200
become collective very fast. It's that in childhood,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.600
when we are little children or people have children,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
it is regarded bad manners to take your own child

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.440
in the presence of others, absolutely bad manners.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.840
Say now, I have my daughter and when we are going to my in-laws

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.400
we couldn't take the child in my lap, you see,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.080
except for [unclear length or so which] I was nursing the baby

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.800
so they have to say that, "Now, you better nurse."

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.200
I would never demand that, "Give me the child. I'll take her." Never.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.480
It's regarded bad manners. And now I see why it was done.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.640
It was bad manners to take the child

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.400
in the presence of others in your lap,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.520
to say, "This is my child." It was regarded as something very rude

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.240
and ill-mannered and as if we are not from good families

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.240
and we don't know how to behave before others.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.200
And even to say that, "This is my child," was not permitted.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.560
We'd say that, "This is your child," to introduce your child.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.800
It's something surprising, now I am realizing it,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.080
why it was so in that society of ours we are not supposed to say that,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.000
"This is my own child." We should go anywhere and say,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.280
"That's your child." Even the house, we would not say,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.440
"This is my house," to anyone. "Will you come to your house, please?"

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.440
The whole -- you see the cultural background gives us that collectivity.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.400
Now I have told before also why people are so sex-oriented

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.920
and mainly they are so sensitive to touch another person.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.800
Anybody who touches them, they get a funny feeling. The reason is

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.520
other sensations are not developed within you.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.400
That is also because you always cuddle your own child.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.520
Child only knows the mother or the father.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.240
All the time, the child is with you.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.120
As a result of that, what happens, the child never feels

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.040
the other sublime relationships with others.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.280
Anybody who is the other is an identity which is something different

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.160
and when you grow up when you suddenly touch somebody

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.400
then you cannot feel the sublime things.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.840
When you are innocent, when you are a child --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.480
I mean we never slept with our parents.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.480
I mean, it's a very common thing in India

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.640
that now supposing if I am in the house,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.800
my daughters will give their children to sleep with Me

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.720
or with my husband, with brothers.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.320
If my brothers are there or their brothers are there

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.840
then they would give their children to sleep with them,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.560
not with themselves.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.520
The psychological reason was that perhaps they understood it,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.440
because it's a very traditional country, so they understood it,

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.400
that the psychological reason behind this was

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.920
that the child gets used to another man, another woman

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.000
and at that sublime situation, at that sublime consciousness,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.400
when they are innocent.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.920
So the relationship of innocence is developed.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.600
Nobody feels anything funny if somebody touches you or does anything.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.800
This is the reason if you see a man touches a little boy,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.040
he gets funny sensation, the boy gets a funny sensation.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.600
It's absurd because you must believe in the principle of collectivity.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.800
Now I have seen that, that people cuddle their children

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.240
too much in this country. And that's a very wrong thing to do,

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.840
all the time carry the child on your lap, carry the child on your this thing.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.480
It's too much. If you overdo it, you'll find

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.280
the same children will hate you.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.040
Because in childhood they develop a sensation

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.000
that they are overdoing the things you see and it cannot express it.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.640
Allow the child to play as much as he likes,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.160
take the child whenever it is necessary.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.040
Let others take the child, not you.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.120
We have such a big community of Sahaja Yogis here.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.000
What I find that the mothers are carrying the child all the time

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.400
or the father is carrying the child. No, give it to other people.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.520
Let the children be with other people,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.920
sleep with other people,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.280
enjoy others' love and don't have fears.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:46.720
They'll love you much more. And that's how I think

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.280
we first of all built in a kind of a stigma,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.440
a kind of a funny feeling that develops later on

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.320
into these perverted relationships, that they feel

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.880
that to be with another person is something wrong.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.120
All these things can be given to children in a very easy way

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.720
if you try it in childhood.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.320
Another thing is that I find like

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.120
in my husband's office I was surprised,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.800
everybody is called by name like this and that ..

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.800
a deputy or CP is called Tom.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.680
Even the driver, we call him a Tom.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.560
But, you see, we are very particular.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.320
I mean, my husband especially is very particular.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.680
He'll never call his driver by his name,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.040
"Mr," so they dare not misbehave.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.800
The relationship must be established in childhood.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.720
Like I have seen people calling him Gavin,

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.160
little children calling him Gavin. I mean, we will never call like that.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.560
Or even if you have see my grandchildren they will say,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.760
"Gavin Uncle," at the most.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.080
It comes to more formal relationship, they'll say, "Mr Ram."

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:59.280
They won't call, "Gavin." That's not done! Aunty, uncle

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.800
? a relationship has to be established.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.480
It's not only your father and mother are important

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.720
but you snatch your children, I have seen, from others.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.200
You want to hold on to your children and just grab them all the time.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.560
That's why they run away from you. Overdoing it.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.880
There's no need. Children are very independent.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.640
They can look after themselves. They can manage themselves,

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.640
and just to keep them pleased, you take them to shops,

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:32.920
make them buy things, get things and then they get used to it.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:40.600
You must know that child is very intelligent

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.200
and you have to bend the child's mind

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.480
according to your own understanding of collectivity.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.240
And if you do not do that, they'll become like all other children

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.120
who are just vagabonds. I see them.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.520
As I told you, once I was coming from Oxtead?

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.480
and there were some children about from eight to nine years of age,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.320
not very big. They were from some public school ? had no discipline.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.120
They entered into my compartment ? it was a first class compartment ?

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.000
and they had some sort of sharp things with them,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.800
some knives maybe, or some razors.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.360
they started rip opening all the seats for nothing at all

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.440
and they didn't do anything to Me, of course,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.400
and I was quite worried. I said, "Why are you doing this?"

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.360
So they said, "Shut up."

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.400
So I got up, went to another compartment, and I said ?

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.360
there are some two boys who are traveling with them.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.800
They were smoking, sitting down nicely on the other side.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.200
So I went and told them these boys are doing like this.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.360
So they came back. They slapped them nicely, slapped them,

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.840
hit them, just they didn't even cry, nothing of the kind.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.440
They pushed them back into their places and then next station

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.560
came the station master came and he was saying now what to do now.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.560
You must learn to discipline your children from now.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.600
Why can't they sit in the program quietly?

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.320
What's the problem with them?

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.400
From the very beginning they must be made to feel the vibrations.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.840
They must be made to sit with other people.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.920
It's because they find that their parents are their own; the rest are not.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.800
That's how racialism also develops because they think

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.880
that other people who are not fair are not [unclear: all right].

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:35.000
All kinds of these scorpion type of temperaments,

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.040
the snake-like temperaments, the secretive temperaments develop

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.480
when you start keeping them exclusively to yourselves.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.000
On the contrary, if you allow them to be open,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.800
talking to everyone,

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.520
opening their hearts to everyone.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.160
Even the people who are grown up shudder

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.400
from touching another's child, I have seen.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.880
They'll ask ten times, "Should I take the child?"

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.400
What's the harm? I mean, even if they go to anybody's house,

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.040
they'll just pick up the child.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.760
And now they say its for protection of disease and all that.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.640
But on the contrary, children develop more immunity.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.920
Over-protected children are very dangerously placed

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.560
because they have no immunity for anything.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.560
Imagine in that country we have all kinds of parasites living,

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.320
all kinds of parasites. Still we exist better,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.600
because we have immunity to so many things.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.360
And that's how you people become very weak, health-wise.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:44.200
Imagine! I went to Australia and we had three, four Indian boys there.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.720
They came to help Me with the kitchen,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.600
lifting all the big things here and there.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.920
So I asked one of them, I said,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.800
"Why not ask these boys to do something?"

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.120
They said, "They are only nice to look at, Mother,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:12:00.000
but they have no strength. They have no strength."

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.280
I have seen that. And it happens more in countries like England

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.320
where it's such a bad climate you keep your children inside.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.000
They don't go out. You all the time shut your children.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.440
They become selfish.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:19.040
They become very mean and very short-sighted.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.800
Open them up. Now you have a community.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.600
You have a trustworthy community.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.240
When you don't, then one person will just,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.000
a dominating person will come up, catch hold of your child

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.240
and use that child, blackmail you for the child, do all kinds of things.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.000
But if you just allow the child to play about with everyone,

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.520
just allow, diseases will disappear.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.840
You'll be surprised. Also supposing you have a problem

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.440
say even with the back Agnya, if others

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.240
are handling, it disappears.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.840
Because somebody has better vibrations, the bhoots leave you.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.000
But if you just all the time hold,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.920
you are a person suffering from a back Agnya yourself.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.320
You are holding on to the child yourself; the child has to suffer.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.760
We actually send our children to other people

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.000
in their early childhood, trusting them and they love the children

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.360
because here people don't believe that you can love the children.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.880
So here we have to trust others with our children

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.200
and that's the reason I feel the children become so exclusive,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.160
they stick on to you; they cannot go to anyone.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.520
But you see in India when you go ? I don't know if you have visited any homes or not ?

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.840
the children will be the first to receive you.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.120
They'll say, "All right, sit down."

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.280
Then they offer you something if there's somebody is not in the house.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.200
They will look after you and they will know everything about you,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.560
what you said, what you asked for, what you wanted,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.080
everything so sweetly. Everything is on the record.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.480
And they have made it for every uncle, for every aunty,

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.640
and they remember all those things all their life.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.920
I met such children whom I had looked after in my childhood,

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.200
in their childhood I would say,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.640
and they remembered all that I told them,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.520
the stories I told them and how I looked after them and every little,

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.880
little things they remembered, and so sweet to know

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.800
that they know all those things still!

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.600
One of them is now working in the World Bank.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.000
She got a big job in the World Bank.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.120
She came down the other day and she just started crying

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.480
like a little baby in my lap, you see.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.880
So I said, "What's the matter?"

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.920
She said "Aunty ji," quite grown up, "I remember all those days," you see,

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.920
and so fond of Me, you see, that she once went to a shop

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.640
and she saw a sari which I used to wear the same type of sari,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.560
yellow colored. She said, "That's my aunty's sari,"

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.600
and she went and bought that sari. She said, "That's my auntie's sari."

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.040
Quite grown up.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.120
All this little, little things children remember,

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.440
all the sublime things all the noble things,

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.360
all the things that are very pure.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.440
But you don't expose them.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.680
You just overpower your children, too much of it.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.240
And also then the children try to attract your attention

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.880
all the time because they are used to it.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.360
They'll ask ten questions,they'll talk too much,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.880
they will say things, and you will be tired.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.120
I know that. When I was coming by train I had a lady traveling with me.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.400
She was, her name was Clive's wife or something.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.440
She was traveling with Me and her son.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.360
And, poor thing, she couldn't talk to Me

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.760
because she had to tell stories to him and then this to him

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.240
and she wouldn't leave. I said, "You just neglect him.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.120
Just neglect for a while

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.600
and the child is better."

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.680
And the same advice I gave to Barbara. Her son is very good.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.480
He went to a motel with Warren when he was there.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.000
He went to every person. He went and asked everyone.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.040
He went around the whole hall and looked at everyone.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.120
But in India children do that. They are worried about everyone.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:02.920
They will go and see their vibrations.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.480
This exclusiveness and overpowering,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.040
you really hate your mothers

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.440
and hate your fathers when you grow up if they are very over-possessive.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.600
This is possessiveness and a fear that we'll lose the child.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.400
Actually, you will really lose if you have this kind of a fear

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.480
if and you overpower your children.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.600
That's what I have seen that children

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.480
who would like to be in the program no,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.920
all the ladies are standing outside as punishments.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:37.440
Why? Make them sit. They'll be all right. They'll sit quietly.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.240
They won't make any noises.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.760
But this overpowering attention to your child,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.880
and I have also heard that in the ashrams,

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.920
the ladies who have children don't do any work.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.880
They just don't do any work. They are looking after the children,

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.920
finish, and the rest of the work in the ashram is done by somebody else.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.080
To produce a child, you don't take much.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:04.200
There is nothing great that you have produced the child first of all.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.880
They are Sahaja Yogis and they are in My trust, not in yours,

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:17.000
and don't spoil them. No mother should sit with the child in the house

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.000
or in the rooms, whatever may be the case.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.080
Allow the child to play with others, sit in the drawing room.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.480
But they will take the child, sit in the room,

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.280
feed the child, look after them.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.680
They have only one work, is to look after the child, finished.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.280
It's like an emotional blackmail, I think,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.800
that you just take the child to yourself and sit down there

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.240
and say that, "Oh! I am looking after the child

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.880
so the relatives say: "Oh! all right, she's a mother."

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.800
I have so many children here.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.800
This motherhood should not give you such a funny idea

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.600
that you have become so great

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.240
that you should sit down and do nothing else.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.920
My family, I have eleven brothers and sisters.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.120
And My mother, I think, was a President of a congress in Nagpur

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.920
of Madhya Pradesh. She went to jail five times

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.760
and a very correct woman. She wouldn't tolerate any nonsense

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.680
from her children, and that's another thing

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.920
that if the child does anything to someone ?

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:38.360
I have heard that children are very indisciplined, they hit others,

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.080
they pull the hair, they say all kinds of funny things ?

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.720
and parents never correct them, just adore them,

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.080
and when the children grow up they just kick out their children, the parents,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.160
we have seen this happening.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:59.000
Because they are realized souls. They won't like this kind of nonsense.

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.200
So be careful of that. Yesterday I talked to you about Mooladhara.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.240
Let the children have a healthy, trustworthy Mooladhara.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.640
Let them meet other people, be friendly with other,

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:14.200
play with everyone, go round everywhere, allow them.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.600
But otherwise they are very negligent about their children.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.640
What do they do? They don't even massage their children;

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.760
they don't even clean their children.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:29.080
They don't keep their clothes clean. They don't give them baths regularly.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.560
They don't give them proper food to eat.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.480
This is one point we have to see that our children

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.360
should be made collective and very strong in their Mooladhara

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.760
from early childhood.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.880
And I have seen parents coming and telling me,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.520
"We don't know why, why our child left us like this, you see,

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.480
when he grew up. He was all right childhood."

00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:00.080
This is the reason. They get bored with you, to be very frank.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.560
That's the only answer. "Suddenly, you see, my son left me, suddenly.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.400
Why? He was all right till yesterday.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.920
He must have been and has now run away from this place."

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.320
So they must have their own friends and they must go round

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.920
and it's really, comparatively if you see your children

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.360
have no wisdom of their own because the parents are so overpowering,

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.040
they don't allow children to grow in proper way,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.560
to understand anybody else.

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:46.640
I just don't understand what has happened to us,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.200
why are we going wrong with our children so much?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.320
Now the another point one has to see about ashrams

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.480
which I need not have said before but now I must tell you

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.760
that we have to be responsible. That is also there.

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.600
From childhood, if you don't have sense of responsibility,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:12.360
you can never develop into one. Like electricity bills

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.440
goes up like hell. People never put off their lights.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.480
I mean, there is a switch

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.800
which is to be put on and also to be put off.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.840
It's not only for putting on.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.440
Small things like gas or electricity thing,

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:33.120
if once they are in the ashram they don't bother. It's your ashram.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:39.440
Then food, the amount of food that is thrown away

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:49.600
is something surprising. No value for food, no understanding

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:53.560
how to organize because there is no Gruha-lakshmi,

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.840
there is no house wife's qualities

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.000
because they are sitting with the child now, not doing anything else.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.320
Supposing you had your own house, then you'd be shopping,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.080
you would be cooking, you would be looking after your child,

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.760
you would be cleaning your house, cleaning the utensils,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.280
doing everything yourself. But in the ashram they think,

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.160
"Now we have a baby so we are in charge of the baby.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.000
Let's look after them and sit down."

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.080
I would love to play with babies all the time

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.840
and have nothing to do with you. So can I do that?

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.080
Can I do that? I cannot.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.240
In the same way we must understand.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.400
Now we should not waste food.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.720
There are many people in this world who are starving.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.920
And we have no business to waste food at all.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.720
I mean on this, you would be surprised

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.320
that even the richest of richest people in India

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.880
would not leave anything in the plate, richest of richest.

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.800
And Gandhiji, in his ashram we were, even Maulana Azad,

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.240
Jawahar lal Nehru had to clean their own plates.

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:13.320
So they should not take more. If they take more

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:17.560
they should not leave anything in such a manner that others cannot eat.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.280
Waste of food and waste of electricity,

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.640
waste of other energies, without understanding it means money.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.240
That's why you never have money.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.520
There should be a proper organizing

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.560
as to what you are going to cook, what you are going to have,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.200
how much is going to be used. Nothing should be wasted.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:52.480
I have seen this tendency. I have seen this tendency Myself ? very common.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.880
They have no respect of food, no respect of food.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.560
That's why children also don't have any respect for food.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.000
Before food is served, we must sit with the idea

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.120
that, "Now we are going to have food." It is a yagya.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.440
And that you have to eat that food with some prayer,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.200
bless that food, thank God that you have got the food.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:29.920
This is the Lord's prayer and then the satisfaction comes in better

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:34.120
and you get a sense that, "No, we should not waste our money

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.520
on food like this."

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.320
There are so many other things one has to know about children

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.600
that we must know about their vibrations.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.480
We should be alert about their vibrations.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.320
Try to find out what's wrong with them. What do they do?

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.000
Now, for example you find that a child is misbehaving.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.080
Don't go on all the time with him. Call the child.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.160
Once make the child sit down and talk to the child that,

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.640
"You shouldn't do like this.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.360
When you are with your mother, pay attention to her."

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.200
It is you who is going to mould these new children

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.360
who have been given to you specially

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:24.160
because you are Sahaja Yogis and not to ruin their lives.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.920
You know some children have become mad

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.320
with this kind of a thing, like Dutta who was here.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.480
And everybody made you see she herself was so careless,

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.920
so careless that you can't imagine

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.480
when I heard about her carelessness

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.160
and the filth with which she looked after the child,

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.000
I was amazed how Linda could do that.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.320
And you should not be another Linda

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.160
who spoiled her child's health, mind everything.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.600
If you have a clean place and a proper place,

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.920
children would love it to be there.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.320
But no mother should sit with the child in the room.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.160
That is allowed [a law?]

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.360
in the drawing room you can sit with your child.

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.720
And in the room when the child is sleeping the child should be taken.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.440
Otherwise keep the child in the drawing room.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.880
You'll see the child will become happier because it is natural to be collective.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.200
It is natural for a child to mix up with others,

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.840
to talk to others, to know about -- it's natural.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.360
Innocence is like that.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.280
Innocence wants to know the whole world.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.240
That's the time if you don't allow the child to move

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.680
then he becomes perverted, he has problems.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.840
So give them a better life, better situation, better education,

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.280
better discipline because you are equipped.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.840
Don't give them what you had.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.360
This is the real love; otherwise it is possessiveness.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.200
I wanted to talk about this because yesterday I talked to you

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.040
about Mooladhara and I have been seeing and noticing

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.440
what's happening to your children

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:09.000
and I find the amount of discipline they have is coming from you,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.280
how far you are disciplined.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.760
And by doing this you play to their hands.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.080
They know that they can curve you the way you like.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.440
They know that you are depending on them.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.080
You can't exist without them, they have this idea.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.720
So they don't listen to you.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.160
But if they know that they will lose the love if they don't behave,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.520
they will be all right. They are very intelligent.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.280
So you must play your cards all right and see

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.680
that your children brought to proper line of understanding

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.160
because they are different children,

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.320
special children given to you as a trust.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.280
They are not your children. They are my children.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.280
So too much of handling and hugging and this and that is not necessary.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.360
I mean, sometimes you break their bones the way you do.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:04.000
It's too much. Try this on others' children,

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.400
less on your own children.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.040
Try to keep your children out and love other children.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.760
I don't know what kind of psychology people read but it's a simple,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.880
straightforward thing. We must understand that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.800
The children have to be collectivity;

00:28:21.848 --> 00:28:24.328
otherwise I have to again break my head again with them

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.160
for being collective.They should be naturally collective.

00:28:29.062 --> 00:28:31.148
All right, [ ... ] let's have the Puja.
