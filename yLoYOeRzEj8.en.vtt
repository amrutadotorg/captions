WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:09.090
Today is the day where we celebrate the change

00:09.115 --> 00:19.742
of the axis of the Sun and that He moves

00:20.031 --> 00:24.447
towards the tropic of cancer.

00:31.240 --> 00:35.656
Tropic of cancer is the one

00:38.406 --> 00:43.365
which represents the motherhood,

00:48.572 --> 00:54.031
the motherhood of the Earth.

01:01.739 --> 01:07.406
This tropic of Cancer has passed through

01:08.406 --> 01:11.406
quite a big area of land

01:11.989 --> 01:16.115
while the tropic of Capricorn has not.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.073
And the area through which it has passed

01:23.697 --> 01:26.323
it has created

01:28.614 --> 01:37.781
different beautiful manifestation

01:39.365 --> 01:44.365
of the motherhood qualities on this Earth.

01:46.864 --> 01:50.115
We celebrate this change

01:52.656 --> 01:57.073
because the Sun has now moved into the new

02:00.323 --> 02:05.614
dimension so that all over the world

02:08.489 --> 02:14.240
there will be the warmth of the Sun.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.656
Warmth of the Sun

02:22.115 --> 02:27.323
represents the warmth of God's love.

02:29.531 --> 02:32.739
This is the reason why we celebrate

02:33.739 --> 02:38.531
this festival

02:39.989 --> 02:42.406
by giving you some sort of a sweet

02:43.073 --> 02:45.823
made out of sesame seeds.

02:46.406 --> 02:55.572
Sesame seeds are given because they are also heat giving

02:56.864 --> 03:00.823
and now as we are coming from the cold,

03:01.447 --> 03:07.406
we come to the hot season, in a way hotter season,

03:08.073 --> 03:13.365
so to prepare you with that warmth of the Sun.

03:15.405 --> 03:19.614
These special things are made out of the seed

03:20.198 --> 03:25.781
of sesame to represent the oncoming warmth

03:26.406 --> 03:31.115
and the warm of the Sun.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.531
Though in India the heat is too much,

03:37.198 --> 03:43.989
still people are waiting for this time to come in

03:44.656 --> 03:48.405
and they celebrate it with such a warm heart.

03:48.864 --> 03:53.406
At this time it is said that

03:55.572 --> 04:02.697
they give you this sesame seed and the sugar to eat,

04:03.281 --> 04:07.365
but now you must speak in a sweet manner,

04:07.989 --> 04:12.531
"gudd gudd bola", means you must speak in the sweet manner.

04:13.115 --> 04:18.156
Speaking in the sweet manner is very important.

04:18.948 --> 04:23.489
Some people think it is smart to speak in a rude manner

04:24.073 --> 04:29.156
or is very intelligent to shout on people,

04:32.073 --> 04:36.406
but no one likes this kind of a personality.

04:37.031 --> 04:43.073
You may be intelligent, you may be very sharp or smart,

04:44.365 --> 04:48.405
maybe on a television people may like to see you,

04:49.531 --> 04:53.531
but not as companions, as friends.

04:54.156 --> 05:00.073
To speak in a very sweet manner

05:00.781 --> 05:07.906
is a sign of good breeding, good culture and fear of God.

05:08.447 --> 05:11.447
Those who fear God will never speak

05:11.989 --> 05:15.240
rudely to another person, because in another person

05:15.823 --> 05:18.697
also the same spirit is shining

05:19.198 --> 05:24.156
and why should we be sharp or angry with another person

05:24.572 --> 05:29.864
who is created by God Almighty as we are created.

05:30.781 --> 05:35.989
So this loving, beautiful relationship

05:36.447 --> 05:37.739
that we have with each other,

05:37.823 --> 05:39.906
after Sahaja Yoga especially,

05:41.405 --> 05:45.073
let us express in talking to each other sweetly.

05:45.531 --> 05:49.447
There are so many ways by which we could be sweet.

05:52.948 --> 05:56.240
There are little, little things if you do,

05:57.572 --> 05:59.781
you can create lot of sweetness,

06:00.323 --> 06:05.531
but you need not a sharp tongue, but a sharp memory.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.781
I try these things many a times.

06:09.823 --> 06:14.906
Once one of the Sahaja Yogi,

06:15.031 --> 06:18.406
who is a very good Sahaja Yogi and an active Sahaja Yogi,

06:18.823 --> 06:21.656
was going in the car with Me

06:23.156 --> 06:30.614
and his knife was stolen by the driver or somebody

06:31.073 --> 06:34.073
and he got very angry with the driver.

06:34.447 --> 06:37.405
I said, "Forget it, you see he is an poor man,

06:37.781 --> 06:41.697
so he has taken it away, doesn't matter, just forget it."

06:42.073 --> 06:44.406
He says, "No, it was because it's a present to me

06:44.739 --> 06:46.948
from somebody who was in Switzerland and

06:47.281 --> 06:49.781
it's a Swiss knife which I was keeping with me.

06:50.198 --> 06:54.656
So I feel sorry that I have lost it."

06:55.115 --> 06:57.240
When I went to Switzerland I bought that kind of a

06:57.531 --> 06:59.489
same knife for him.

06:59.989 --> 07:03.198
When I came, when I gave him,

07:03.572 --> 07:05.115
he didn't have words to say anything.

07:05.489 --> 07:08.489
He said, "Mother, how did You remember?

07:08.948 --> 07:10.406
After such a long time how did you manage

07:11.198 --> 07:12.447
to get this knife?"

07:13.198 --> 07:14.365
I said, "I have a very good memory."

07:14.989 --> 07:17.739
That's the trouble with Me.

07:18.323 --> 07:21.489
The memory is so good that sometimes,

07:21.906 --> 07:23.781
I just don't know,

07:25.823 --> 07:28.240
I may embarrass some people with My memory.

07:28.572 --> 07:32.405
It is that good, I don't forget anything whatsoever.

07:32.823 --> 07:34.614
I, of course, forget all the bad things,

07:34.989 --> 07:38.447
because no use remembering bad things,

07:39.156 --> 07:41.031
no use thinking of them.

07:41.489 --> 07:45.656
Because of forgiveness you can always forget the bad things.

07:46.198 --> 07:48.115
And if you remember the good things

07:48.781 --> 07:51.823
your joy becomes multiplied.

07:52.281 --> 07:54.365
If you try to remember something bad

07:54.864 --> 07:56.323
then your joy goes down.

07:56.739 --> 07:58.447
Every time you see a person try to remember

07:58.989 --> 08:01.948
what good that person has done to you.

08:02.365 --> 08:04.406
What good that person has.

08:04.823 --> 08:07.489
If you have memory for good things

08:09.489 --> 08:12.240
you will have a very nice time.

08:12.989 --> 08:16.405
Now today is the day when you are all leaving India.

08:16.739 --> 08:19.073
Some of you will be leaving day after tomorrow.

08:19.447 --> 08:20.489
Whatever it is,

08:21.156 --> 08:24.365
I have to tell you one thing, that

08:25.031 --> 08:29.781
whatever was possible has been done here, for you people

08:30.198 --> 08:32.781
to give you joy and happiness.

08:33.156 --> 08:35.531
Now when you are going back,

08:35.906 --> 08:38.447
try to remember all that was said to you.

08:38.906 --> 08:40.406
All that was nice.

08:40.864 --> 08:42.323
How people praised you.

08:42.739 --> 08:45.906
How they loved you. How they were kind to you.

08:46.447 --> 08:48.365
How you met some nice people.

08:48.697 --> 08:50.823
What nice experiences you had

08:51.281 --> 08:54.906
but don't brood over things which are worthless.

08:55.240 --> 08:58.531
All right, somebody must have said something harsh to you

08:58.906 --> 09:00.906
or you might have said something harsh to someone,

09:01.323 --> 09:02.906
just forget it.

09:03.405 --> 09:05.823
Try to understand that you are spoiling

09:06.198 --> 09:08.697
your chances of enjoying life.

09:09.281 --> 09:16.948
Nobody is hurt by that so try to be extremely happy

09:17.489 --> 09:19.323
that you have met so many people,

09:19.781 --> 09:21.281
that you have had weddings,

09:21.656 --> 09:23.323
that you have seen so many weddings.

09:23.614 --> 09:27.531
We have had a nice time and every bit of it was

09:27.906 --> 09:31.073
full of joyous vibrations.

09:31.406 --> 09:34.115
Of course, today some of you would be a little unhappy

09:34.531 --> 09:38.156
I can understand that because your spouses are leaving,

09:38.614 --> 09:40.823
somebody's husbands are going away or

09:41.156 --> 09:42.781
somebody's wives are going away.

09:43.198 --> 09:44.281
So I can see some of them

09:44.656 --> 09:48.031
are looking rather miserable about it.

09:53.823 --> 09:56.281
But that's a good thing because it is out of love

09:56.656 --> 10:00.073
and out of attraction for each other,

10:00.489 --> 10:02.864
for enjoying the company of each other.

10:03.198 --> 10:05.489
That's suggestive of something very good to Me

10:05.823 --> 10:08.365
but still I would say that, after all,

10:08.739 --> 10:10.781
you are going to meet each other

10:11.156 --> 10:12.405
and remember all the good things that

10:12.823 --> 10:14.489
you have said to each other,

10:14.864 --> 10:17.989
you have enjoyed with each other and try to keep happy.

10:18.489 --> 10:21.240
Because these days will pass very fast.

10:21.656 --> 10:23.697
In Sahaja Yoga you just forget time, everything,

10:24.031 --> 10:27.489
the time passes so fast and all these things will pass over

10:27.823 --> 10:31.823
and you will be again united with your husbands or wives,

10:32.198 --> 10:33.531
whatever may be the case.

10:34.115 --> 10:37.323
So there is nothing to feel very sad about all these things,

10:37.572 --> 10:39.656
and to keep smiling and laughing,

10:40.115 --> 10:41.323
so when they are departing also,

10:41.823 --> 10:45.323
they should not feel, see your last face full of tears but,

10:47.447 --> 10:52.405
but remember the face of assurance and courage,

10:52.781 --> 10:55.156
that the hope is there,

10:55.489 --> 10:56.864
we are going to meet very soon and

10:57.323 --> 10:59.739
there is nothing to feel very sad about it.

11:00.156 --> 11:03.739
Today is the day to make joy and to enjoy everything

11:04.240 --> 11:09.739
and to feel the blessings of God all around us.

11:10.198 --> 11:14.156
The Sun has come back in His own glory

11:14.739 --> 11:20.240
and we have to wish Him all success in the coming year,

11:20.614 --> 11:22.447
because in this part of Maharashtra

11:22.823 --> 11:24.739
as you know there has been no rain.

11:25.073 --> 11:27.115
There has been problems with them and

11:27.406 --> 11:28.739
we have to wish Him success

11:29.447 --> 11:34.447
so that He can bring forth the rain

11:35.406 --> 11:41.365
and all that is needed out of this solar energy

11:41.781 --> 11:44.115
that we have in this country.

11:46.156 --> 11:49.323
And you have to be beaming like the Sun

11:49.697 --> 11:51.365
when you go back to your countries.

11:51.948 --> 11:55.323
That your countries are not so hot as ours are neither

11:55.614 --> 11:59.031
you have that much of warmth there and you can find

11:59.405 --> 12:02.864
that why people are so warm and so much loving because

12:03.281 --> 12:04.906
we have the Sun with us.

12:05.406 --> 12:08.823
Now you carry the Sun with you and you give them love

12:09.156 --> 12:14.115
and affection and warmth and let them feel that the Sun

12:14.489 --> 12:17.031
has been brought from India by you.

12:17.365 --> 12:19.489
Whenever I have traveled anywhere, in any country,

12:19.948 --> 12:22.447
the Sun used to be there very bright, so they said that,

12:23.031 --> 12:25.656
there is a saying that, when the Indians travel

12:26.405 --> 12:27.906
they carry the Sun with them.

12:28.406 --> 12:30.281
Of course you can't carry the Sun in your pockets

12:30.948 --> 12:33.115
but we must be carrying it in our hearts, the Sun.

12:33.614 --> 12:35.531
That must be the reason that's why

12:35.906 --> 12:37.115
the Sun was shining so well

12:37.739 --> 12:39.240
and everybody came out with their good dresses

12:39.614 --> 12:41.405
and everything was ...were, and were enjoying.

12:41.989 --> 12:43.739
So this is what it is,

12:44.281 --> 12:46.031
that you have to carry the Sun with you

12:46.447 --> 12:50.031
speaking sweetly today and forever to each other

12:50.406 --> 12:53.156
to be friendly, to be helpful, to be kind

12:53.656 --> 12:55.198
because you are yogis,

12:55.531 --> 12:56.781
you are not ordinary people.

12:57.156 --> 13:00.240
You are yogis, you represent that category of people

13:00.489 --> 13:02.115
who are known for their righteousness,

13:02.365 --> 13:05.240
for their goodness and for their compassion and love.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.323
So I wish you all best of luck.

13:08.656 --> 13:09.948
Enjoy your journeys,

13:10.365 --> 13:13.156
enjoy everything and pass this joy

13:13.531 --> 13:14.823
that you have achieved here,

13:15.365 --> 13:16.948
to other people, to other Sahaja Yogis

13:17.406 --> 13:20.405
and to other people who are not even Sahaja Yogis.

13:20.823 --> 13:23.156
May God bless you with that.

13:23.405 --> 13:25.406
Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.

13:25.781 --> 13:28.406
Today is an auspicious day and on this day we give sesame

13:29.531 --> 13:32.281
seeds to others and ask them to talk sweetly.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.531
We tell others but it would be better if we tell it

13:36.405 --> 13:39.365
to ourselves also because it is easier to tell others

13:39.906 --> 13:42.073
to talk sweetly but: “I’ll talk harshly.”

13:42.864 --> 13:44.489
With this habit of ours have created

13:45.240 --> 13:48.572
wrong ideas about ourselves. We do not have any idea

13:49.739 --> 13:53.489
of the blessings that God has bestowed upon us.

13:54.156 --> 13:57.031
God has given such a lot of blessings to us in this country.

13:57.365 --> 14:00.614
But in this country people do not care much for cleanliness.

14:01.697 --> 14:04.031
In this country there are different types of germs

14:04.697 --> 14:07.198
and parasites.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.406
I feel that we have all the parasites of the whole world

14:09.948 --> 14:12.240
in this country. We even have parasites which

14:12.697 --> 14:15.115
cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

14:15.697 --> 14:18.864
If these parasites go to the other countries they will die.

14:19.365 --> 14:21.406
Because of the cold they cannot survive.

14:21.864 --> 14:24.572
Due to the Sun, there are so many parasites in this country.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.198
Once a scientist asked Me, “How is it possible to remain

14:29.115 --> 14:32.447
alive with so many parasites present in your country?”

14:32.989 --> 14:35.198
I replied that “In this country, the people are not only

14:35.948 --> 14:37.781
alive but live with joy and happiness,

14:38.656 --> 14:40.406
with a lot of bliss and happiness.”

14:40.823 --> 14:42.489
The reason for this is the Sun.

14:42.989 --> 14:44.489
The Sun has taught us to keep our homes open

14:45.198 --> 14:46.739
and also open our hearts.

14:49.406 --> 14:51.864
In England, if you have to go out somewhere

14:52.572 --> 14:55.531
then you have to spend at least fifteen minutes just to put

14:56.031 --> 14:57.531
on the right clothes.

14:57.906 --> 14:59.948
It’s as if you are wearing a shield before going out,

15:00.240 --> 15:04.365
otherwise you might catch a cold and affect your head.

15:05.489 --> 15:07.031
This is the situation there.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.489
Today you are sitting here in the open but we cannot sit

15:11.031 --> 15:12.989
like this in England or in any other Western country.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.656
Because of the weather these countries have become very cold.

15:19.989 --> 15:23.531
Even in our country there are areas (city), for example

15:25.697 --> 15:28.739
if you go to cities like Bhowali or the other side of

15:29.823 --> 15:33.614
Nainital and Dehradun and very close to the Himalayas, then

15:34.531 --> 15:39.240
you can find the cold weather as in the other countries.

15:40.031 --> 15:45.073
There, it is also cold like in England and America.

15:45.864 --> 15:48.406
But in these cold countries not even birds or insects

15:48.864 --> 15:49.948
can survive.

15:51.115 --> 15:54.697
There are a lot of forests with beautiful flowers in them.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.656
They call it a valley of flowers.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.031
There are so many beautiful flowers – as if it is a paradise

16:01.656 --> 16:03.739
on earth – but this feeling is only for a moment.

16:04.823 --> 16:07.073
It is so cold there that we cannot even open our eyes

16:07.656 --> 16:09.240
to see that beautiful place.

16:10.406 --> 16:12.614
We have to wear spectacles otherwise our eyes are hurt,

16:13.198 --> 16:14.531
because of the cold.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.115
But in spite of the cold,

16:17.531 --> 16:19.989
those countries have progressed so much.

16:20.572 --> 16:24.906
They have fought against the nature and the cold climate

16:25.906 --> 16:28.823
and strengthened their countries.

16:30.697 --> 16:33.823
In spite of having a lot of sun, we have not been able

16:34.531 --> 16:36.739
to exploit its advantages.

16:37.281 --> 16:39.073
We can also produce solar energy.

16:39.572 --> 16:41.864
If we use the solar energy we will never have a dearth

16:42.365 --> 16:43.781
of (electrical) energy.

16:44.115 --> 16:46.073
Even the cars can run on solar energy.

16:46.405 --> 16:48.115
But the attention of the politicians here in India

16:48.406 --> 16:50.489
is elsewhere and due to this fact, we cannot exploit

16:50.948 --> 16:53.906
the advantages from the sun but suffer from it.

16:54.323 --> 16:58.323
If we do not go to the extremes then we can do a lot of work.

16:58.823 --> 17:00.406
The main thing which we can learn from the Sun

17:00.697 --> 17:04.240
is Its capacity of giving. It always gives.

17:05.323 --> 17:08.447
It does not take anything but always gives.

17:09.156 --> 17:12.489
Due to this tremendous giving power of the Sun

17:13.240 --> 17:16.073
we can have rain, we can have crops and living beings.

17:16.531 --> 17:18.572
If we did not have the sun then we would not have anything.

17:19.031 --> 17:20.447
It is due to the giving power of love of the Sun only, that

17:20.948 --> 17:23.323
we have been able to reach this state.

17:23.614 --> 17:25.656
Thus what we have to learn from the Sun is that we should

17:25.948 --> 17:27.823
also develop the power of giving.

17:28.156 --> 17:29.948
If we look around us we will find people who will always

17:30.281 --> 17:32.864
think, “How I can save money and keep it for myself?”

17:33.240 --> 17:35.697
Even if I give money for some programs, some people still

17:35.948 --> 17:38.073
think how they can save money from that also.

17:38.531 --> 17:40.948
Even if I have given them some money to spend they always

17:41.240 --> 17:44.406
have a tendency to save money from everything. Why?

17:44.823 --> 17:46.614
Because there is a tendency to hold on to something.

17:46.864 --> 17:48.948
If someone goes to the market and they find that prices

17:49.240 --> 17:50.864
have risen, and if we ask, “Why?” they reply that

17:51.198 --> 17:53.156
“Because the others have increased the prices,

17:53.405 --> 17:54.656
that’s why I also increase the price.”

17:54.989 --> 17:57.323
If the (cost) prices of the commodities are not rising then

17:57.989 --> 18:00.323
why do they raise the (selling) price?

18:01.073 --> 18:04.406
They have always a tendency to suck the energy of others.

18:04.864 --> 18:07.198
Even if I want to make a small ceremony for a festive

18:07.406 --> 18:09.489
occasion, then others tell Me,

18:19.572 --> 18:21.240
“Shri Mataji you will not be able to succeed.”

18:22.240 --> 18:24.823
When I ask, “Why?” the reply is that people are corrupt and

18:25.198 --> 18:27.281
they will eat (grab) money.

18:27.739 --> 18:30.572
As I eat the food they eat money, so maybe we will not get

18:31.031 --> 18:33.406
along together. It is such an absurd thing.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.489
Those who are responsible for the country’s welfare,

18:35.906 --> 18:38.031
those who are the administrators and those on whom the power

18:38.323 --> 18:41.281
has been bestowed by God, even they do not understand that

18:41.781 --> 18:44.823
we have to give.

18:45.323 --> 18:49.406
This quality of giving one has to learn from the Sun:

18:50.656 --> 18:53.447
that we have come (on this earth) to give and not to take.

18:53.823 --> 18:56.156
This complete change from within has to be reached with

18:56.572 --> 18:58.156
an understanding that we have to give and not to take.

18:58.614 --> 19:00.697
We have to have the passion of giving.

19:01.198 --> 19:04.031
It’s as if when a mother knows that “Today my son is coming”

19:04.281 --> 19:05.989
then with passion she thinks, “What can I do for him,

19:06.281 --> 19:09.073
what food can I cook for him?”

19:09.323 --> 19:11.614
This is the passion which a mother has.

19:11.906 --> 19:14.697
Even if she doesn’t have the ingredients, she might borrow

19:15.073 --> 19:17.823
them from the neighbors and prepare some sweets for you.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.572
She always feel that she has not done enough.

19:20.906 --> 19:24.948
Unless and until we have this kind of collective passion

19:25.198 --> 19:27.115
from inside and have this kind of feeling about others,

19:27.406 --> 19:30.572
no country can progress, neither our own nor other countries.

19:31.073 --> 19:33.781
But we always have the urge to take things from others,

19:34.156 --> 19:36.365
to plunder from others, to borrow from others or

19:36.572 --> 19:38.531
to deceive others. Because of this urge our children

19:38.948 --> 19:41.365
will suffer, we will suffer and we will not be able

19:41.572 --> 19:44.531
to achieve anything in this country.

19:44.989 --> 19:48.697
In My in-law’s village (inaudible)…to build a lake.

19:49.156 --> 19:51.572
The government gave them money in thousands for the purpose.

19:52.073 --> 19:53.823
But the lake was never built.

19:54.115 --> 19:56.406
They said that they had dug a hole to make a lake but then

19:56.697 --> 19:59.281
they covered it again since they did not find any water.

19:59.572 --> 20:02.156
But in fact the hole was never dug.

20:02.405 --> 20:04.864
So where did the money go?

20:05.323 --> 20:06.948
They sent it to Switzerland (bank).

20:06.948 --> 20:08.697
So the banks will again borrow from Switzerland and send

20:09.031 --> 20:10.447
the money again to Switzerland.

20:10.781 --> 20:12.447
If the Sun acts in this way then we cannot survive

20:12.447 --> 20:14.240
even for one day.

20:14.531 --> 20:17.781
If he alone eats (consumes) everything, what can we eat?

20:18.656 --> 20:21.031
Today we are celebrating the SANKRANTI.

20:21.739 --> 20:26.489
Sankranti means a sort of Kranti (revolution) by which

20:26.823 --> 20:28.406
we acquire the habit of giving.

20:29.031 --> 20:32.739
Everybody says that we should have the habit of giving

20:33.281 --> 20:36.031
but most of the people believe in donating something

20:36.447 --> 20:38.739
to the priest.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.739
Also, many people preach the art of giving

20:43.031 --> 20:45.073
just to fill their own pockets.

20:45.614 --> 20:47.281
This doesn’t have any meaning.

20:48.031 --> 20:52.281
There is always a question of whom to give and why to give.

20:52.823 --> 20:55.198
In fact, in all liberty and freedom, we should see

20:55.572 --> 20:58.156
for ourselves what we are giving for our country,

20:58.447 --> 21:01.906
for our brothers and sisters and our neighbors.

21:02.948 --> 21:05.989
We should not be selfish, but give with all our heart

21:06.656 --> 21:09.447
so that we get all the joy of giving.

21:10.405 --> 21:13.614
When we give with all our heart, the joy that we get

21:14.572 --> 21:17.989
cannot be compared with any other joy.

21:18.739 --> 21:21.156
If we want to feel this kind of joy only, then we should

21:21.572 --> 21:26.489
celebrate the SANKRANTI today.

21:27.906 --> 21:32.864
Our nature should become like the Sun.

21:33.948 --> 21:37.156
Whatever he is doing, he doesn’t have the feeling that

21:37.781 --> 21:41.405
he is doing something. He is doing everything in AKARMA

21:42.156 --> 21:44.405
(without the feeling of doing anything) and constantly

21:44.864 --> 21:47.989
burning himself and giving you joy, light,

21:48.406 --> 21:53.115
the essence of living, and he nourishes you.

21:53.447 --> 21:56.281
We see the Sun every day and many people do Namaskar also,

21:56.697 --> 21:58.447
but we only do Namaskar without imbibing

21:58.781 --> 22:00.240
his qualities of giving.

22:00.823 --> 22:02.823
I told you a very small thing:

22:03.281 --> 22:05.948
that every Sahaja yogi

22:06.240 --> 22:09.531
should plant a banyan tree in his garden.

22:09.989 --> 22:11.406
Why do we have to take money from the government

22:11.697 --> 22:13.281
for this purpose?

22:13.697 --> 22:14.948
Just to plant a tree and put a fence around that

22:15.281 --> 22:16.989
tree doesn’t need much money.

22:17.405 --> 22:18.697
Even to smoke bidi (tobacco) costs more.

22:19.115 --> 22:21.073
Try to do this small thing so that others should see that

22:21.073 --> 22:22.948
you are at least doing something.

22:23.614 --> 22:25.406
In spite of this we always think how we can get money

22:25.823 --> 22:27.697
from others, how we can plunder others and how we can

22:28.198 --> 22:30.323
save money at others cost.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.906
Because of these tendencies within us,

22:33.365 --> 22:35.781
our country can never progress.

22:36.365 --> 22:38.531
We did not have these tendencies before in people,

22:39.115 --> 22:41.156
in the earlier days.

22:41.739 --> 22:45.115
I can tell you that when I was young I saw people who

22:45.365 --> 22:48.697
believed only in giving and never in taking.

22:49.365 --> 22:52.323
I saw them giving only, they did not like taking.

22:52.906 --> 22:56.447
Even the parents did not like it if the children took

22:57.073 --> 22:59.531
something from others and would tell them to return it.

22:59.906 --> 23:01.614
I still remember in My father’s house they had made

23:01.614 --> 23:03.572
some chairs and also an umbrella, out of silver.

23:04.031 --> 23:07.073
Everybody asked, “Why did you make these out of silver?”

23:07.656 --> 23:09.572
So the reply was, “When we have marriage ceremonies,

23:09.572 --> 23:11.864
instead of borrowing or hiring them,

23:12.115 --> 23:13.656
it would be better that we have them with us once

23:13.656 --> 23:15.614
and for all, because if we had to hire then sometimes

23:15.906 --> 23:17.656
we did not get them in time because the earlier person

23:17.656 --> 23:19.281
who had borrowed had not returned them.

23:19.531 --> 23:20.948
And sometimes these umbrellas were lost because someone

23:20.948 --> 23:22.864
had never returned them and so they got lost.”

23:23.115 --> 23:24.323
So what I wanted to say is that if we have money,

23:24.781 --> 23:26.156
we should invest it into something collective.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.697
If you want to construct a badminton court,

23:27.697 --> 23:30.115
then in that court everybody should be able to come

23:30.115 --> 23:31.572
and play and we should not say that only my children

23:31.906 --> 23:33.489
should play in that court. If somebody buys a car,

23:33.781 --> 23:35.031
we should be able to take all the children to school.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.739
Thus we should buy a big car so that all the children

23:38.240 --> 23:39.697
can be taken to school.

23:40.281 --> 23:41.864
This habit of being collective and being useful

23:42.156 --> 23:44.156
to everybody, one should learn from the Sun.

23:44.447 --> 23:46.405
And today is a special day when we can learn this thing

23:46.697 --> 23:50.115
from the Sun. And we should take a vow that

23:50.656 --> 23:53.739
“I’ll do something which is collective.”

23:54.406 --> 23:56.697
I do not understand how people can eat without caring

23:57.115 --> 23:58.656
for the common public.

23:59.531 --> 24:01.405
You do not even worry about your neighbors and do not

24:01.781 --> 24:03.156
do anything for the common people.

24:03.781 --> 24:06.864
I told you a very small thing is to plant a tree.

24:07.406 --> 24:09.948
We have got so many yogis in Maharashtra,

24:10.323 --> 24:12.697
even if each one plants one tree and looks after it,

24:13.115 --> 24:15.531
this will be certainly helpful to everybody.

24:15.906 --> 24:19.656
Thus I request all of you to do something collective and

24:20.281 --> 24:22.156
it will be useful to everybody.

24:22.823 --> 24:25.447
But one should never think how much will I earn from it

24:25.781 --> 24:27.323
and make money out of it.

24:27.781 --> 24:29.697
It should not happen like the way we give money

24:30.115 --> 24:31.406
to the priest.

24:32.031 --> 24:33.989
One should open his heart and lovingly do something

24:34.281 --> 24:35.989
for the collective and feel the joy out of it.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.781
One should make it a habit.

24:39.073 --> 24:40.948
I do not want to say that others should have

24:41.406 --> 24:43.240
everything for free.

24:43.614 --> 24:45.365
I never said that you do something for free for

24:45.656 --> 24:47.697
the people who have come from abroad.

24:48.198 --> 24:50.656
If you look at them you will see that they have brought

24:50.656 --> 24:55.031
so many things for you from abroad to give you as presents.

24:55.614 --> 24:57.781
Of course I have contributed a lot.

24:58.198 --> 25:00.115
But they have also brought a lot of things of their own.

25:00.489 --> 25:02.281
When I saw the presents here, I thought that they were

25:02.281 --> 25:04.240
the presents which I had bought in Rome for you

25:04.489 --> 25:06.365
but then they told Me that these were the presents

25:06.781 --> 25:08.823
which they bought themselves and they had not

25:08.823 --> 25:11.115
brought My presents.

25:11.489 --> 25:13.572
They felt such a lot of joy to bring so many things

25:13.864 --> 25:15.031
for you.

25:15.405 --> 25:18.073
They do not even know in Italy to whom these presents were

25:18.323 --> 25:20.447
to be given but they do not bother.

25:20.697 --> 25:22.489
They leave it to Me to give them to the Sahaja yogis

25:22.864 --> 25:24.531
here in India.

25:24.906 --> 25:27.156
But in India we have a tendency to think only about

25:27.489 --> 25:29.864
our children and about our mother.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.365
Then the mother comes walking, limping on one leg.

25:32.697 --> 25:35.156
Then you start saying that “My mother did not get

25:35.156 --> 25:37.240
a high quality sari.”

25:37.614 --> 25:40.989
Since I do not have one I give her a simple sari.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.906
This is the tendency here.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.531
But with the people from abroad it is just the opposite.

25:46.823 --> 25:48.948
When they came here they came with so many presents

25:48.948 --> 25:52.115
it seems they brought two tons of presents from abroad.

25:52.447 --> 25:54.572
Even My hands starting paining while giving these

25:54.948 --> 25:56.823
two tons of presents.

25:57.198 --> 26:00.073
What I want to say is that they do not expect anything

26:00.489 --> 26:02.365
from you. But your behavior should be such as to show

26:02.572 --> 26:04.989
an example for them. And you should show them that

26:04.989 --> 26:07.406
you are in no way inferior to them,

26:07.823 --> 26:09.864
“We are here really to serve you, to welcome you,

26:10.198 --> 26:11.489
whatever is possible from our side

26:11.489 --> 26:13.406
we do not hesitate to do.”

26:13.739 --> 26:15.447
It doesn’t cost any money nor any hard work.

26:15.906 --> 26:18.323
The only thing is that we should change our outlook.

26:18.656 --> 26:21.240
If even after coming in Sahaja Yoga we are not able

26:21.240 --> 26:23.115
to change our nature in this manner then I do not feel

26:23.115 --> 26:25.739
that we can change the entire humanity with Sahaja Yoga.

26:25.989 --> 26:27.989
The biggest quality in us is to give to others.

26:28.489 --> 26:30.489
And this quality we should imbibe within us.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.447
In Sahaja yoga your Kundalini is awakened and you

26:32.906 --> 26:34.656
realize your spirit but the essence of spirit is like that

26:35.198 --> 26:37.031
of the Sun and this essence is of giving.

26:37.447 --> 26:40.031
If you have seen one photograph of Mine, there is the Sun

26:40.281 --> 26:41.989
shining on My heart; in fact there is a Sun in My heart

26:42.281 --> 26:44.614
and because of this I never feel that I should take something

26:44.906 --> 26:47.406
from them or to plunder anybody.

26:48.281 --> 26:50.531
I do not understand from which part of your head this idea

26:51.073 --> 26:52.614
of plundering them comes from.

26:53.031 --> 26:55.572
This is a very strange behavior.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.781
Sahaja yogis should not think in this way but on the contrary

26:58.031 --> 27:00.073
every day we must think what we can give or do for others.

27:00.489 --> 27:02.365
In Rahuri itself I have started an organization

27:02.614 --> 27:04.198
whose name is “SAHAJ STREE SUDHAR” or “SAMAJSUDHAR”

27:04.572 --> 27:06.115
(association for the welfare of women).

27:06.531 --> 27:08.405
Through Life Eternal Trust we cannot use the money for

27:08.739 --> 27:10.198
the welfare of the women thus we had to create

27:10.572 --> 27:11.781
this organization.

27:12.073 --> 27:13.948
This organization has been registered and people from Canada

27:14.281 --> 27:16.489
and elsewhere are ready to donate to it but here I do not

27:16.864 --> 27:18.531
find anybody to work for this organization.

27:19.031 --> 27:21.489
If the local women take it upon themselves to work for this

27:21.739 --> 27:23.781
organization only then it will succeed.

27:24.073 --> 27:25.948
We have acquired land and all the facilities but we do not

27:26.323 --> 27:28.614
find time to devote for this organization.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.823
So how can we go to this place?

27:30.823 --> 27:32.614
But one should remember that people are coming from abroad

27:32.614 --> 27:34.531
with the money to donate for your organization.

27:34.781 --> 27:36.156
They have brought fourteen machines for the women here.

27:36.948 --> 27:39.031
You can see women loitering about without doing anything.

27:39.489 --> 27:41.281
You can ask them to work so that they can earn

27:41.281 --> 27:43.989
something out of it. And they can prosper.

27:43.989 --> 27:46.447
At least these things we should try to think about.

27:46.823 --> 27:48.447
Instead of that we always think about ourselves.

27:48.697 --> 27:50.281
So the persons who are in Sahaja Yoga should know that this

27:50.614 --> 27:52.365
selfish attitude is not accepted in Sahaja Yoga.

27:53.115 --> 27:54.989
We should think in terms of global advantage.

27:55.281 --> 27:57.198
The lives (Vibhouti) of saint are for the salvation

27:57.198 --> 27:58.864
of the world. And also for the salvation of saint lives,

27:59.198 --> 28:00.406
this world exists.

28:00.823 --> 28:02.906
Thus the saints will be blessed by this attitude…

28:03.281 --> 28:06.447
(VIBHOUTI means Ashes with which Shiva is decorated).

28:06.989 --> 28:10.281
Now you have become saints you should behave like saints

28:10.614 --> 28:12.823
and the first quality of a saint is giving.

28:12.823 --> 28:16.156
You have never heard of a saint plundering anybody.

28:16.656 --> 28:19.948
If a saint thinks of cheating he does not remain a saint.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.198
Thus from our side we should always think how much

28:22.406 --> 28:24.198
we can give and what we can give,

28:24.447 --> 28:28.864
how much love we can give.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.823
And how many people we can help.

28:31.281 --> 28:32.948
All our attention should be for this purpose.

28:33.823 --> 28:35.614
Nowadays there are welfare associations

28:36.073 --> 28:38.447
just for election purposes.

28:38.864 --> 28:41.823
We should not create any such type of welfare association.

28:42.365 --> 28:43.614
But we should create associations in which we can

28:43.989 --> 28:45.906
work selflessly and our love should be NIRVAJYA (selfless)

28:46.405 --> 28:48.906
and we should not expect anything in return.

28:49.240 --> 28:51.489
And there are no limits for our love, it is an endless love.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.948
When we have this kind of love automatically

28:54.405 --> 28:56.240
we will know what is to be done.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.989
The improvements should be done gradually and every

28:59.406 --> 29:01.823
Sahaja yogi should contribute to this collective welfare.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.031
We should try to devote our time for this purpose and

29:03.323 --> 29:05.073
work hard to achieve our goals. It should not happen

29:05.489 --> 29:07.823
that “Shri Mataji has come, She gives a talk,

29:07.823 --> 29:09.948
and when She goes everything is finished.”

29:09.948 --> 29:11.948
These people (from abroad) have done a lot.

29:11.948 --> 29:14.405
They have started schools and social welfare.

29:14.906 --> 29:16.531
We should also start something in this manner.

29:16.906 --> 29:18.781
Sahaja Yoga should not become an association of people

29:19.323 --> 29:21.405
who have realized the spirit and are swimming in the joy

29:21.405 --> 29:24.406
but are lazy lumps.

29:24.906 --> 29:28.115
It should not happen this way.

29:28.115 --> 29:31.365
We should try to see how we can help others.

29:31.365 --> 29:34.281
We should open our eyes to look around us with love

29:34.281 --> 29:36.614
and try to see how we can help others.

29:37.073 --> 29:41.240
Still I have not been able to move to India.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.697
Once I come back to India you will see that

29:43.989 --> 29:46.240
I will make everyone work.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.365
Thus it is advisable to start working before I come.

29:48.365 --> 29:50.864
Sahaja Yoga is not meant only for sitting and meditating.

29:50.864 --> 29:52.739
For meditating why do you need Sahaja Yoga?

29:53.198 --> 29:54.739
You can go the Himalayas.

29:55.115 --> 29:56.823
If you want to stay here and be in Sahaja Yoga then

29:57.073 --> 29:59.115
the common people should be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

29:59.614 --> 30:01.697
But Sahaja Yoga should not become like these

30:01.697 --> 30:03.531
modern welfare organizations.

30:04.406 --> 30:06.240
We should try to achieve our goals with full sincerity

30:06.531 --> 30:08.823
and only then we can say that we have established Sahaja Yoga.

30:09.906 --> 30:12.739
Now I heard a lot of praise for Me.

30:13.281 --> 30:16.115
I heard the songs and they gave Me a lot of Joy and

30:16.489 --> 30:19.073
satisfaction that people have recognized Me.

30:19.906 --> 30:21.989
But you should remember one thing – you should work

30:22.240 --> 30:23.864
in order to know yourself because you cannot see

30:24.156 --> 30:25.823
yourself in the mirror.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.281
You should be able to see what you have achieved,

30:28.906 --> 30:30.405
like in the earlier days you used to look after

30:30.823 --> 30:32.781
your household, your children. In the same manner,

30:33.031 --> 30:35.365
if you are not able to work for the collective,

30:35.365 --> 30:37.531
then in My opinion, you have not achieved anything

30:37.823 --> 30:39.823
through Sahaja Yoga.

30:40.073 --> 30:42.115
You have remained where you were,

30:42.447 --> 30:44.406
you have not progressed at all.

30:44.906 --> 30:48.864
Next year when I come, you should be able to tell Me

30:49.323 --> 30:51.405
how many banyan trees you have planted.

30:51.948 --> 30:55.447
Secondly, you should be able to tell Me what collective

30:55.906 --> 30:57.572
or social work you have done.

30:58.031 --> 31:00.156
If you try to look around you will definitely be able

31:00.572 --> 31:02.697
to see some collective work which you can do

31:03.115 --> 31:04.948
and you should do.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.531
I’m sure you will be able to do it very well.

31:07.948 --> 31:09.823
It doesn’t need any money – only you have to decide

31:10.365 --> 31:11.781
within your heart. When I started Sahaja Yoga,

31:12.198 --> 31:13.739
at that time I’d given realization to one lady only

31:14.198 --> 31:16.031
and I started without any money.

31:16.656 --> 31:18.697
I did not have support from anybody but even then

31:19.031 --> 31:20.823
I started Sahaja Yoga.

31:21.365 --> 31:24.406
But because of honesty of the work and the consistency,

31:24.823 --> 31:26.823
it has spread so much.

31:27.198 --> 31:28.323
Now each one of you, man or woman,

31:28.989 --> 31:31.405
you have the responsibility that when you will

31:31.656 --> 31:35.198
introduce Sahaja Yoga to the general public,

31:35.906 --> 31:38.656
you will be able to give them some proof of the general

31:38.906 --> 31:42.240
well being. You need not break any law for this.

31:42.531 --> 31:44.906
You need not do anything wrong nor need you do

31:45.198 --> 31:48.073
anything unlawful. In a very simple way if you just

31:48.447 --> 31:50.739
open your eyes you will be able to see what you can do

31:51.156 --> 31:52.823
for the general welfare of the people,

31:52.823 --> 31:55.156
how you can help the wellbeing of the people.

31:55.697 --> 31:57.656
And I’m here to give you all the strength and energy

31:58.031 --> 31:59.572
to do this work.

31:59.906 --> 32:01.823
We do not need any vote nor any money or anything else.

32:02.198 --> 32:03.781
You should give you Me a promise that without expecting

32:04.073 --> 32:06.031
anything in return you will start working for

32:06.031 --> 32:08.906
the welfare of the people.

32:09.281 --> 32:11.406
Sometimes, it might so happen that when people start

32:11.406 --> 32:14.031
some welfare work they go round asking for funds.

32:14.031 --> 32:16.031
This is wrong. We should not ask for money in the beginning.

32:16.031 --> 32:18.656
First you should start some work which does not need money.

32:18.948 --> 32:20.906
Everyone feels that without money we cannot do anything.

32:20.906 --> 32:23.198
You have got the powers so why do you need money?

32:23.572 --> 32:26.864
If somebody is sick or not well in your neighborhood

32:27.240 --> 32:31.031
then you can go and visit him and try to soothe that person.

32:32.739 --> 32:33.948
Instead of that, what I see is that

32:34.323 --> 32:35.739
you bring the sick person to Me.

32:36.115 --> 32:37.447
The other day, someone brought

32:37.447 --> 32:39.240
an injured person to Me. He had a broken arm.

32:39.489 --> 32:41.240
A Sahaja yogi could have treated him in two minutes and

32:41.447 --> 32:43.240
made him well but instead of that, they brought him to Me

32:43.531 --> 32:44.739
and that too right in the middle of a public program

32:45.031 --> 32:46.531
and asked Me to treat his arm.

32:46.864 --> 32:48.198
You are so many and all the powers are flowing

32:48.531 --> 32:50.489
through your hands but still you do not use them.

32:50.823 --> 32:54.531
If you are not able to treat even these small ailments

32:55.323 --> 32:59.405
what is the use of you being a Sahaja yogi? Someone says,

33:00.240 --> 33:02.906
"my mother is sick, my father has broken his leg.”

33:03.823 --> 33:08.031
Instead of bringing them to Me you can easily treat them.

33:08.447 --> 33:11.489
You do have the powers, try to use them.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.156
Thus you should be able to help the people without

33:15.073 --> 33:18.240
expecting anything in return and with full Joy.

33:18.823 --> 33:21.531
You will be able to feel a lot of joy when you have

33:22.073 --> 33:24.656
the feeling that you do not do anything but you are just

33:27.073 --> 33:29.989
an instrument of God and you are living in this world,

33:31.115 --> 33:34.405
in this country and you are giving something special to them.

33:35.031 --> 33:37.489
It is such a big thing, such a big understanding.

33:37.739 --> 33:39.365
With such a feeling, if all of you decide to work,

33:39.781 --> 33:42.781
then, you will be able to do something for others

33:43.447 --> 33:46.572
and other people will see what Sahaja Yoga is.

33:48.906 --> 33:50.405
Now people think what is Sahaja Yoga –

33:50.948 --> 33:53.447
just everybody meditating together and that’s all.

33:53.906 --> 33:56.198
Even if there is some problem in the country Sahaja yogis

33:56.447 --> 33:58.572
are just sitting in meditation.

33:58.948 --> 34:00.823
One man came and told Me, “My wife doesn’t cook.”

34:00.823 --> 34:02.864
I asked, “Why?” He said, “She just meditates.”

34:03.281 --> 34:05.031
So I said, “Is it so? But who told her that?”

34:05.281 --> 34:07.365
First she should cook, for meditation even

34:07.614 --> 34:09.572
five minutes are sufficient.

34:09.823 --> 34:12.073
I have given you the power and the energy to cook well.

34:12.073 --> 34:15.156
Thus one should have the confidence

34:16.739 --> 34:20.073
that you are capable of work.

34:20.572 --> 34:22.572
I am giving you the powers, you can assimilate them.

34:22.864 --> 34:25.073
If you just meditate every day it is not sufficient.

34:25.073 --> 34:27.405
You have to see what wellbeing you are

34:27.864 --> 34:31.406
giving to the others.

34:32.115 --> 34:34.156
But instead of that, you always think about your own wellbeing

34:34.405 --> 34:36.073
and come and ask Me to treat your son, your father,

34:36.073 --> 34:37.864
your mother, or ask that you should get a good job.

34:38.115 --> 34:39.281
And you want that I should also come to your house

34:39.531 --> 34:40.447
to eat, do this, do that.

34:40.656 --> 34:42.656
This way, you try to impose your will upon Me

34:42.864 --> 34:46.447
but about you, what can you do?

34:46.906 --> 34:49.572
You should always remember that you have to do something.

34:49.864 --> 34:51.531
“I will show Shri Mataji what I’m capable of,

34:51.948 --> 34:53.656
to do something special.”

34:54.031 --> 34:57.115
We should decide this once and for all.

34:57.572 --> 35:02.572
I have an image in front of My eyes as Shri Gyaneshwara

35:02.989 --> 35:09.073
has said, "BOLTE PIYUSHANCHE SAGAR."

35:11.906 --> 35:15.614
(Words or sayings are like the oceans of nectar)

35:16.447 --> 35:19.323
Where is it? I want to see it.

35:20.823 --> 35:23.405
Thus on this auspicious day I give you

35:23.906 --> 35:25.656
all My sweet blessings that you will help everyone

35:26.405 --> 35:28.572
and look after their wellbeing and you will treat

35:28.906 --> 35:32.531
everyone with love and you will talk sweetly,

35:33.073 --> 35:35.864
full of love.

36:00.115 --> 36:01.739
He is saying you should put your hands

36:02.323 --> 36:05.156
like this to say that you are bound by Mother's words.

36:05.656 --> 36:08.406
And we will try to do good to others and

36:08.781 --> 36:12.073
we will be very kind to each other.

36:16.489 --> 36:20.697
I've been telling them that we have to be collective

36:21.240 --> 36:23.489
not among only Sahaja Yogis but with others also.

36:23.864 --> 36:26.115
We should see surroundings, what's wrong where,

36:26.531 --> 36:31.739
how we can help. We have many social obligations

36:32.115 --> 36:33.864
which we have to fulfill.

36:34.240 --> 36:36.989
Now you have reached the stage where you can do that

36:37.365 --> 36:42.948
without forming any social organization which collects money

36:43.365 --> 36:45.864
and have saints and things that kind of a nonsense.

36:46.323 --> 36:50.281
But you can see around yourself who are the needy,

36:50.614 --> 36:52.823
to whom you can help.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.365
And that is how you can really give

36:55.739 --> 36:59.406
a very positive form to Sahaja Yoga.

37:15.198 --> 37:17.198
Marathi

37:35.739 --> 37:37.073
Rahurila

47:02.365 --> 47:05.489
I'll be giving this water to all of you

47:06.115 --> 47:11.365
all the leaders and aslo..

47:12.906 --> 47:13.948
you can take it.

47:14.781 --> 47:16.240
this water is very good for

47:16.697 --> 47:21.572
all diseases of the Mooladhara chakra.
