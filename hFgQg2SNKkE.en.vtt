WEBVTT

04:53.655 --> 05:00.897
It’s a great pleasure that from all over the world

05:01.218 --> 05:08.189
people have gathered to worship Shiva.

05:08.390 --> 05:15.771
Actually we should say it is Sadashiva
that we are going to worship today.

05:18.435 --> 05:26.615
As you know the difference between Sadashiva and Shri Shiva.

05:27.951 --> 05:37.899
Sadashiva is the God Almighty

05:38.224 --> 05:47.504
and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.

05:55.047 --> 06:03.424
The combination between Sadashiva
and the Primordial Mother Adi Shakti

06:03.625 --> 06:11.765
is just like a moon and the moonlight or the sun or the sunlight.

06:11.966 --> 06:17.286
We cannot understand such relationship in human being,
among human marriages

06:17.487 --> 06:22.112
or among human relationships.

06:26.951 --> 06:31.845
So whatever the Adi Shakti’s creating,

06:32.673 --> 06:42.609
which is the desire of Sadashiva, is being witnessed by Him.

06:43.533 --> 06:50.092
And when He is watching this creation

06:50.293 --> 06:59.323
He is witnessing all of it into all details.

07:00.009 --> 07:06.597
He witnesses the whole universe

07:07.374 --> 07:12.928
and He also witnesses this Mother Earth,

07:13.129 --> 07:20.292
all the creation that is done by the Adi Shakti.

07:21.080 --> 07:25.362
His power is of witnessing

07:26.593 --> 07:34.426
and the power of Adi Shakti

07:34.823 --> 07:40.313
is this all pervading power of love.

07:42.642 --> 07:49.097
So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father, we can say,

07:51.200 --> 07:59.228
expresses His desire, His Iccha Shakti as the Primordial Mother

07:59.429 --> 08:05.308
and She expresses Her power as love.

08:07.112 --> 08:13.273
So the relationship between the two is extremely

08:16.071 --> 08:21.176
understanding, very deep,

08:21.929 --> 08:25.671
and whatever She‘s creating,

08:26.578 --> 08:32.747
if She finds, if He finds there is some problem

08:32.948 --> 08:38.470
or there are people, human beings specially

08:38.671 --> 08:47.408
who are trying to obstruct Her work, or even the Gods

08:48.456 --> 08:55.599
who are not the deities are trying to express their egos,

08:56.284 --> 09:01.580
He is the one who brings forth their destruction.

09:03.896 --> 09:11.083
So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power.

09:12.197 --> 09:18.901
He is reflected in the hearts of human beings,

09:19.102 --> 09:24.684
among all the creations He pulsates.

09:24.885 --> 09:34.568
But that pulses, pulsation is the energy of the Primordial Mother.

09:35.335 --> 09:44.366
And He can destroy anything that goes against
the plans of the Adi Shakti.

09:44.567 --> 09:52.176
Adi Shakti is love, She forgives and She loves.

09:52.377 --> 09:59.076
She loves Her creation. She wants the creation to prosper,

09:59.277 --> 10:03.914
to go up to the same level for which it was created.

10:04.115 --> 10:13.685
She wants human beings to go to that level where

10:13.886 --> 10:18.866
they enter into the Kingdom of God, Kingdom of Sadashiva

10:19.067 --> 10:26.021
where there is bliss, there is forgiveness, there’s joy.

10:28.212 --> 10:36.455
All this is only possible if you have seeking,

10:36.656 --> 10:47.208
that you have also a innate desire to be there.

10:48.248 --> 10:58.416
This desire within us is reflected as the reflection of the Primordial Mother.

10:58.617 --> 11:05.205
Now this desire is there and other mundane desires are also there

11:05.406 --> 11:11.695
which stop the progress of your ascent.

11:12.990 --> 11:18.981
In Sahaja Yoga we have never tried

11:19.182 --> 11:25.482
to overcome the desires by taking sanyasa
or running away from the house

11:25.683 --> 11:30.227
or for all kinds of things that has been suggested.

11:30.428 --> 11:37.711
The first thing that is done is that you get the light of your spirit.

11:37.912 --> 11:42.034
Spirit is the reflection of Sadashiva.

11:42.235 --> 11:46.007
In that light He shows, He is just showing the path.

11:46.208 --> 11:55.700
The spirit is just like a light which is burning and which is showing the path.

11:56.279 --> 12:02.269
In that path you yourself become so wise

12:02.470 --> 12:11.255
that you walk in the light of wisdom,
that you walk in the light of righteousness.

12:11.456 --> 12:18.199
Because whatever is destructive is seen through the light of your spirit.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.467
You start giving up all that is destructive.

12:23.420 --> 12:27.357
Nobody has to tell you that give up this, give up that.

12:27.558 --> 12:33.087
You yourself realize that this is wrong and we should give up.

12:33.654 --> 12:42.153
This was, I should say, my own understanding of human beings

12:42.354 --> 12:49.985
because these are the days where people are in complete illusions.

12:50.186 --> 12:55.459
They are in a conflict all the time struggling even to exist.

12:55.660 --> 12:59.964
Under these circumstances, everything would have failed

13:00.165 --> 13:06.948
if you had started with taking a sanyasa
and then going to Himalayas and all that.

13:07.149 --> 13:14.027
If you have to do this for the masses, something has to be done radical

13:14.228 --> 13:19.849
and luckily I’ve been able to find out a way by which

13:20.050 --> 13:27.859
you can get your sprouting, your Realization.

13:28.060 --> 13:34.458
Now some people who get Realization have to understand certain things

13:34.659 --> 13:41.111
because as you know there are many people who have got Realization.

13:41.312 --> 13:45.005
I don't know how many, I don't keep count.

13:45.206 --> 13:51.377
But what is lacking in them is surrendering.

13:54.152 --> 13:58.258
It’s embarrassing to say but is a fact.

13:58.459 --> 14:08.021
This is the only condition of modern Sahaja Yoga
that you have to really surrender.

14:08.222 --> 14:14.421
If you start using your brain, if you start using other methods

14:14.622 --> 14:20.438
to understand Sahaja Yoga, you cannot. You must surrender

14:20.639 --> 14:27.433
and as Islam is nothing but surrender, Islam means surrender.

14:27.917 --> 14:33.685
And if that surrender is not there

14:34.240 --> 14:43.258
it is impossible to establish anyone in the Kingdom of God.

14:46.429 --> 14:56.522
Surrender is not that you should give up your family, give up your children,

14:56.723 --> 15:02.139
or give up your houses and homes and your properties.

15:02.340 --> 15:07.441
Surrendering is here: give up your ego to begin with

15:07.642 --> 15:11.158
and then give up your conditionings.

15:11.359 --> 15:18.414
For example, the other day I met one gentleman and he is suffering a lot.

15:18.835 --> 15:25.633
So I asked him, "Who is your Guru?", so he gave Me one name of a Guru.

15:25.834 --> 15:31.691
I said, "He’s not done any good to you, will you give him up?"

15:31.914 --> 15:36.720
He said, "Tomorrow." I said, "Why not today?"

15:36.921 --> 15:40.891
He said, "Today, but I have to throw away all his things.

15:41.092 --> 15:44.255
So tomorrow morning I will do it." I said, "All right, do it."

15:44.456 --> 15:47.696
"What should I throw away, Mother?" I said,

15:47.897 --> 15:53.030
"Then all the things with which you worshipped him, throw away, throw away."

15:54.215 --> 16:00.829
Then he went around the whole house,
found out whatever was there which was used

16:01.030 --> 16:08.179
for worshipping him, everything he gathered together, threw in the sea.

16:08.380 --> 16:12.756
And then he told the sea that, “I am sorry

16:12.957 --> 16:18.570
I have suffered a lot because of this man, now you please don't suffer.”

16:19.431 --> 16:26.720
So this kind of a very penetrating intelligence if you don't have

16:26.921 --> 16:32.964
you cannot give up. One sticks to that.

16:33.165 --> 16:38.003
I know of so many who find it so difficult to get rid of their conditionings.

16:38.204 --> 16:42.386
That’s more difficult than ego.

16:42.838 --> 16:46.473
Mundane conditionings and condition schemes that you have.

16:46.674 --> 16:51.165
We have first conditioning that supposing you are born

16:51.366 --> 16:55.175
in India or England or any place.

16:55.620 --> 17:00.154
After Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen most of the people they suddenly start

17:00.355 --> 17:03.903
seeing what’s wrong with their countrymen,
what’s wrong with their country,

17:04.104 --> 17:08.831
what’s wrong with their religion,
what’s wrong with the books they were reading.

17:09.032 --> 17:16.100
Immediately they start seeing it clearly,
that this was the mistake, this is wrong.

17:16.316 --> 17:20.280
They all make fun of them. I’ve seen people all over the world.

17:20.481 --> 17:27.834
Nobody says that ‘No, no, no, no, because we are English,
we are the best,

17:28.035 --> 17:32.148
we are Russians so we are the best,
or we are Indians we are the best’.

17:32.349 --> 17:35.111
Immediately they find out what’s wrong with them

17:35.312 --> 17:38.790
and why these people are not getting Realization.

17:38.991 --> 17:42.016
On the other hand they feel such compassion

17:42.217 --> 17:45.297
that ‘Mother, so many people haven't got their Realization.

17:45.498 --> 17:49.254
Why shouldn't we try to give them Realization?’

17:49.455 --> 17:53.918
This is the double action of this light.

17:54.119 --> 18:00.694
Firstly you know that there is light
and that you have become the light.

18:00.895 --> 18:06.367
So wherever your attention goes you start seeing reality

18:06.568 --> 18:10.808
and then you understand that this has been the conditioning

18:11.009 --> 18:15.535
of our country, of our society.

18:15.736 --> 18:22.028
And then they abhor all that is wrong,
they never identify with it.

18:22.237 --> 18:26.507
But first thing as I said, is surrendering.

18:26.708 --> 18:36.305
In surrendering actually you develop
a kind of a state where I would say

18:37.043 --> 18:44.279
you become a sanyasi, from within.

18:44.902 --> 18:50.373
That means nothing can dominate you, what is a sanyasi is a person

18:50.574 --> 18:58.360
who is above everything else. Nothing can stick to him.

18:58.598 --> 19:04.692
He just looks at things and he knows what it is.

19:04.893 --> 19:11.549
He may not say, he knows everything
and he doesn't do whatever is wrong.

19:11.750 --> 19:18.330
He’s so detached, that in that detachment
only he can see what’s wrong with people.

19:18.531 --> 19:23.284
He starts seeing his family people, he starts seeing other surroundings,

19:23.485 --> 19:27.970
everywhere he starts seeing what’s wrong.

19:28.171 --> 19:31.862
And he does not identify with them, is very surprising.

19:32.063 --> 19:36.026
I have seen it, I mean, I went to Turkey.

19:36.227 --> 19:42.181
In Turkey I met one gentleman who was running a big Swiss hotel

19:42.382 --> 19:46.233
and he came himself to Me and said, "Mother, give me Realization."

19:46.434 --> 19:51.467
I was surprised because I didn't see this in Switzerland
such a anxious personality

19:51.668 --> 19:54.081
would ask for Realization, very surprising

19:54.282 --> 19:59.512
that in Turkey he should ask for Realization.
And I gave him Realization

19:59.713 --> 20:04.597
and immediately he said, "I am not going to go back to Switzerland.”

20:05.231 --> 20:09.919
Just imagine! It’s, you see, it is so clear-cut

20:10.120 --> 20:16.989
that this light definitely gives you tremendous wisdom and balance.

20:17.190 --> 20:23.139
Supposing you are walking
and you can't see the road, you may fall down.

20:23.340 --> 20:25.817
But if there’s little light also you can see it.

20:26.018 --> 20:31.346
And this is what Sahaja Yoga has done,
is given you very little light.

20:31.547 --> 20:36.938
That little light itself has been sufficient for you
to give up so many things.

20:37.139 --> 20:41.311
Now the other side of it is the ego part.

20:42.130 --> 20:47.060
Ego is very subtle stuff with human beings.

20:47.261 --> 20:52.481
I don't know how they gather it, but they do and some of them have

20:52.682 --> 20:59.099
such a gullible ego that with the slightest thing it shoots off.

20:59.300 --> 21:04.478
And they get very angry for small things or if they find somebody

21:04.679 --> 21:09.299
whom they can dominate, they can dominate also that person.

21:09.500 --> 21:15.551
Now this ego when you start seeing it,
you just start laughing at yourself

21:15.752 --> 21:18.976
and think that, what’s wrong with me.

21:19.177 --> 21:24.021
Ego is not like conditioning which is coming from outside

21:24.222 --> 21:29.230
but ego is something that comes from within.
It can come from anything.

21:29.431 --> 21:34.008
Human beings have ego of all kinds of nonsensical things.

21:34.209 --> 21:40.463
One day I met one lady and she was very proud
and was not even smiling.

21:40.622 --> 21:44.698
I said, "What’s the matter with this lady, what is she?"

21:44.865 --> 21:48.542
So they told Me, "She knows how to make dolls
that’s why she’s so proud.”

21:48.743 --> 21:52.607
I said, “Eh, to make dolls, she’s so proud!”

21:52.808 --> 21:57.208
"Yes, you know, she can make dolls, so she’s so proud."

21:57.409 --> 22:01.893
I said, "What is there, anybody can make dolls, so what is so great?"

22:02.094 --> 22:05.216
"No, but she thinks she is very great because she makes dolls."

22:05.417 --> 22:12.875
So a man becomes stupid and stupid.
That is first sign of a egoistical person.

22:13.076 --> 22:18.091
He is so stupid that when you are talking to him,
you just get flabbergasted

22:18.292 --> 22:22.271
that without paying anything you have got a buffoon before you

22:22.472 --> 22:27.684
who is showing all joke, jokes of his buffoonery.

22:27.885 --> 22:32.399
Is something very surprising,
I mean, you meet any egoistical person

22:32.601 --> 22:38.111
and you just watch him: “I did this, I am, I, I, I ...”

22:38.312 --> 22:43.800
Then you start seeing the person,
what’s the matter, he’s not even ashamed to say

22:44.001 --> 22:50.286
things that should not be said.
Then it goes even to the sinful life they lead.

22:50.487 --> 22:56.412
They lead a very sinful life, they fond of women,
they drink and this and that.

22:56.613 --> 23:01.115
Then they start boasting about that also:
“I drank that day so much;

23:01.316 --> 23:05.721
I had five women around me.” They start boasting of that also.

23:05.922 --> 23:10.124
So, for a egoistical man there is nothing like shame.

23:10.325 --> 23:13.183
He’ll go on telling about his nonsensical things

23:13.384 --> 23:17.023
and everybody will say, ‘My God, with whom are we talking?’

23:17.224 --> 23:22.154
And then, whatever they do they justify.

23:22.355 --> 23:25.283
I asked one fellow, "You had such a bad heart attack.

23:25.484 --> 23:28.279
Why do you drink now, give up drinking."

23:28.480 --> 23:32.330
He said, "But even this person Kirloskar” - we have one in Poona

23:32.531 --> 23:38.468
who is now, I think, 95 – “he drinks”.
So I said, "You are not Kirloskar,

23:38.669 --> 23:42.819
and even if he drinks, what’s the use, what is he gaining by that?"

23:43.020 --> 23:49.289
"No, no, you see he’s very good,
because, see, he drinks and he’s so successful."

23:49.467 --> 23:53.218
"Is he successful without, because of drinking?"

23:53.419 --> 23:58.780
But even ordinary reasoning is not there, ordinary reasoning.

23:58.981 --> 24:06.102
And in the general way if you see,
even if you see the greatest drunkard countries,

24:06.303 --> 24:11.993
I have never seen a statue of a man who died of drinking, never.

24:12.194 --> 24:15.099
I’ve not seen in any country people are praising a man

24:15.300 --> 24:21.613
because he had ten women or he died of drinking. So far!

24:21.814 --> 24:25.848
I don't know how far human beings can go in their ego.

24:26.049 --> 24:29.560
Now this ego is spreading very much in modern times

24:29.761 --> 24:37.199
where they start saying, "I like this, I don't like this".

24:38.284 --> 24:42.045
“What, what you don't like?” "I don't like this kind of a sari,

24:42.246 --> 24:45.385
I don't like this kind of clothes, I don't like this."

24:45.586 --> 24:49.374
But who are you, you are not going to see yourself,
others are going to see.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.448
So what difference does it make whether you like it or not?

24:52.649 --> 24:57.818
But is very common with young people, to talk like that "I like."

24:58.113 --> 25:02.331
And this is a sign of complete destruction.

25:02.532 --> 25:08.219
Because ego is not only, is, makes you stupid,

25:08.420 --> 25:11.031
you see all these days the way people dress up

25:11.232 --> 25:16.362
and we find they are very stupid because "I like it, so what?”

25:16.563 --> 25:20.547
Anything they like it, you know, if they want to walk on their heads

25:20.748 --> 25:23.999
"I like it, what’s wrong?”

25:24.325 --> 25:29.160
All kinds of stupidity can be explained through ego.

25:29.362 --> 25:36.607
So those who get Realization somehow or other, thank God, see it:

25:36.845 --> 25:40.651
This is my ego talking.

25:41.153 --> 25:47.361
Then they start laughing at themselves, making fun of themselves:

25:47.562 --> 25:53.677
This was my ego. But also in Sahaja Yoga there are people,

25:53.878 --> 25:58.430
I said, "Why don't you go and organize?"
"Mother, because my ego will come up."

25:58.631 --> 26:04.126
I said, "What’s this?” “My ego will come up so I don’t want to organize."

26:04.327 --> 26:10.666
How can your ego come up? If you see your ego, supposing you see,

26:10.867 --> 26:16.991
something is burning, you see it there.
How can you get that burning onto yourself?

26:17.192 --> 26:24.152
But this is a very subtle type of, avoiding work of Sahaja Yoga

26:24.353 --> 26:26.827
to say that "No, I’ll get into ego."

26:27.028 --> 26:32.167
I said, "All right you get into ego, I’ll see to it, get in, what happens."

26:32.863 --> 26:41.493
So all kinds of things there are which makes a person quite idiotic and stupid.

26:43.093 --> 26:48.746
I mean, I don't know how many things I can tell you today.

26:48.947 --> 26:54.052
But also I’ve seen in marriages this is very common.

26:54.253 --> 26:59.192
They’ll say that, ‘Mother, I married this girl at that time

26:59.393 --> 27:03.237
but now I don't think I should have been married.’

27:03.438 --> 27:08.697
Bah, bah, what, that time, what had happened to you,
why didn't you marry at that time?

27:08.899 --> 27:11.780
I have to tell you these things because I’ve been facing

27:11.981 --> 27:16.950
all kinds of problems of this stupid, idiotic ego.

27:17.906 --> 27:21.170
One has to see it clearly,

27:21.371 --> 27:27.483
how this ego is working in me and how it is keeping me down.

27:27.684 --> 27:32.589
So when we talk of ascent, we talk of a higher life.

27:32.790 --> 27:40.038
We have to become sanyasi like the lotus that comes out of the pond

27:40.239 --> 27:44.783
and no water can stay on them.

27:45.195 --> 27:51.187
Even the leaves of lotus, no water can stay on them.
Just like that we have to become.

27:51.388 --> 27:55.483
We don't have to wear sanyasis dresses, nothing of that.

27:55.684 --> 28:02.418
But from inside, a kind of a detached attention is there

28:02.619 --> 28:10.092
which immediately locates the problem, within you and without.

28:10.293 --> 28:16.110
And also in Sahaja Yoga, you know how to overcome that.

28:16.311 --> 28:25.732
It’s a very effective, efficient system.

28:26.081 --> 28:29.567
But for that again, to achieve that

28:29.768 --> 28:35.603
you have to become Shiva within, means detached.

28:35.804 --> 28:40.895
As Shiva is completely detached, you have to be detached.

28:41.096 --> 28:47.409
And that detachment will give you the same wisdom as Shiva has.

28:47.611 --> 28:56.329
Shiva sees, we should say, Sadashiva sees the work of Adi Shakti, silently.

28:56.530 --> 29:01.144
He doesn't get proud, He doesn't develop a kind of a ego

29:01.345 --> 29:09.230
‘Let me see now what my Iccha Shakti is doing’, nothing, He’s just watching.

29:09.544 --> 29:14.001
But when it comes to destruction,

29:14.202 --> 29:18.750
He sees that this part is going to destroy the work,

29:18.951 --> 29:23.886
immediately He destroys, removes that portion.

29:24.235 --> 29:33.042
In the same way we have to be,
we have to see our life itself is a big field.

29:33.243 --> 29:39.283
How do we consider ourselves to be?

29:39.561 --> 29:42.857
I have seen people talk, "Oh, so what, I am a Sahaja Yogi!"

29:43.080 --> 29:46.822
You can't talk like that if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

29:49.581 --> 29:54.584
With folded hands you have to say, “I am a Sahaja Yogi”.

29:55.036 --> 30:00.346
In your behavior, in your talk, in everything,

30:00.547 --> 30:07.757
you have to be a person who is extremely humble.

30:10.655 --> 30:18.194
If that is not so that means Sahaja Yoga has given you double ego.

30:19.362 --> 30:24.603
As it is you know that Shiva is known for His innocence,

30:24.804 --> 30:29.664
for His simplicity, His forgiveness. He forgives.

30:29.865 --> 30:35.312
He forgives rakshasas; He’ll forgive everyone, that is His quality.

30:35.513 --> 30:43.712
But anybody who goes against the Primordial Mother, He doesn't spare.

30:44.792 --> 30:48.709
So this is His, the quality one has to understand,

30:48.910 --> 30:52.562
surrendering doesn't mean outside things to be surrendered.

30:52.763 --> 30:57.489
What is there, these are all stones, what are you surrendering?

30:58.537 --> 31:06.798
Surrendering means cleansing yourself completely,
getting completely detached.

31:06.999 --> 31:12.052
Detachment is the only way you can rise.

31:25.686 --> 31:29.100
Some people get sick, they make such an ado out of it:

31:29.301 --> 31:34.701
“I am sick, the whole world should know
I am sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.”

31:34.902 --> 31:39.278
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you just watch,

31:39.479 --> 31:43.650
how so, I am sick, all right, let’s see.

31:43.984 --> 31:48.764
Just like a spot. Just watch.

31:49.735 --> 31:54.674
I am sick. So, what’s happening now?
The temperature is coming nicely,

31:54.875 --> 31:59.842
now is going down, you just sort of a

32:01.960 --> 32:06.054
playful, mirthful attention.

32:06.348 --> 32:12.108
Ah, when I came I had temperature,
but nobody believes I had temperature.

32:12.309 --> 32:15.111
I was so tired in the marriage they said, "You don’t look tired."

32:15.313 --> 32:22.807
I said, "All right, I’m not tired."
In the same way, life also is to be played.

32:23.008 --> 32:32.452
It’s just a play, and that play has to be seen
through the light of wisdom.

32:32.653 --> 32:37.769
Nothing is so serious, for Sahaja Yogis nothing is so serious.

32:37.970 --> 32:46.414
But he becomes very serious and
he makes too much ado about himself.

32:47.400 --> 32:52.222
There are lots of things which we have to learn.

32:52.423 --> 32:58.075
When we worship Shiva, we praise Him.
You are this, you are that, you are that.

32:58.276 --> 33:01.167
When you worship Me also you praise Me, you are this.

33:01.368 --> 33:04.559
I am not aware of all that that you say. But you say all right,

33:04.760 --> 33:08.038
if you say so, it’s all right. You are this, you are that,

33:08.239 --> 33:14.068
the thousand names of Shiva, thousand name of the Goddess,
thousand name of Vishnu.

33:14.269 --> 33:19.934
These are their names you are worshipping, what about you people,

33:20.593 --> 33:23.723
how many names you can have?

33:23.977 --> 33:29.590
Actually in the puja when you take the names of these Shaktis

33:29.791 --> 33:34.426
they also get awakened within, no doubt.

33:34.680 --> 33:41.219
After Puja you do feel that way but you don't utilize them.

33:41.910 --> 33:45.626
So many people I’ve seen have come in the puja

33:45.827 --> 33:53.755
and they have got that power within themselves, same powers.

33:54.089 --> 33:59.060
But by the time they are out, it’s finished, it’s gone.

33:59.261 --> 34:07.048
So, surrendering has another side: assumption.

34:08.979 --> 34:13.993
Assumption that I am a Sahaja Yogi

34:14.230 --> 34:20.258
and I can absorb all these powers within myself.

34:20.848 --> 34:24.479
So one side is surrendering.

34:24.892 --> 34:28.388
Why to surrender? To absorb.

34:29.722 --> 34:34.839
Automatically when you are surrendered you absorb.

34:35.834 --> 34:41.545
But once you have absorbed, then you should retain

34:41.746 --> 34:47.605
and assume within yourself, know that you have these powers.

34:48.703 --> 34:52.816
There, where Sahaja Yogis fail more.

34:53.017 --> 34:56.870
First time it happened, no Sahaja Yogi would touch anybody,

34:57.071 --> 34:59.547
raise anybody's Kundalini, this thing, that thing.

34:59.748 --> 35:03.278
We had at least fifty Sahaja Yogis by then.

35:03.479 --> 35:06.242
I said, "Now what to do, I have prepared these channels

35:06.443 --> 35:11.658
and nobody is even raising their fingers.
How am I going to work it out?"

35:11.859 --> 35:13.427
Very difficult!

35:13.628 --> 35:19.655
But once it happened we had a program in Nasik Road
and I was staying in Nasik.

35:19.856 --> 35:23.708
It’s about, I think, thirty miles from there.

35:24.054 --> 35:28.807
So, we reached halfway and our car failed

35:29.008 --> 35:34.566
and nobody, no other car was coming, nothing, no support, nothing.

35:35.862 --> 35:42.057
I didn't know what to do. But these, all the Sahaja Yogis had arrived there,

35:42.258 --> 35:45.730
and such a big crowd. They started saying, "When is Mataji coming?

35:45.931 --> 35:49.816
When is Mataji coming?" Such a pressure!

35:50.017 --> 35:53.156
So they said, "It’s all right, we’ll give you Realization, sit down."

35:53.357 --> 35:55.953
And they gave Realization.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.809
That’s the first time the Sahaja Yogis started knowing that they can

36:00.010 --> 36:04.179
give Realization, they can do this, they can do that.

36:04.433 --> 36:08.901
They all started after that.

36:09.102 --> 36:14.498
So assumption should be there, that I have these powers,

36:14.699 --> 36:18.287
I am not going to waste them, I am going to use them,

36:18.488 --> 36:23.260
I am going to look after others, I am not going to just keep to myself.

36:23.461 --> 36:28.870
This assumption has to come. Once I was traveling by ship

36:29.071 --> 36:34.645
and one fellow got caught up in the freeze room and he got pneumonia.

36:34.846 --> 36:38.836
So the captain came to Me ‘That see this boy has got pneumonia,

36:39.037 --> 36:41.590
we have to get some doctor by helicopter.’

36:41.791 --> 36:44.945
I said, "Captain, I’ve given you Realization, you are a doctor."

36:45.146 --> 36:48.693
He said "Who, I?” “Yes, you." "If you want, I can go down."

36:48.894 --> 36:51.717
"No, no, no, but tell me what to be done." I said "Just go

36:51.919 --> 36:58.082
and put your hand on his heart, finished." "I" he said. "Yes, you!"

36:58.283 --> 37:04.315
Went down and put his hand and the fellow got all right.

37:04.754 --> 37:07.277
He was amazed.

37:08.223 --> 37:12.618
He met Me now in the wedding – and he was amazed at himself.

37:12.819 --> 37:16.741
"This I can do to anyone?" "Yes, yes, you can!”

37:17.495 --> 37:23.607
But if you do not assume, and just sit down meditating,
meditating, surrendering …

37:23.808 --> 37:26.639
what’s the use?

37:29.053 --> 37:33.281
So, you have to do,

37:33.781 --> 37:42.203
now after achieving Shiva state you have to
start doing the work of Adi Shakti.

37:43.912 --> 37:51.595
You should get this desire that we should spread Sahaja Yoga,
we have to work it out.

37:51.796 --> 37:54.944
But be careful sometimes you might be conditioned,

37:55.145 --> 37:57.970
you might be egotistical, watch yourself.

37:58.171 --> 38:02.665
With watching you can, I’m sure, you can achieve a lot.

38:02.866 --> 38:06.854
We have done, some people who have taken it upon themselves

38:07.055 --> 38:11.089
have done it, everywhere, in every country.

38:11.290 --> 38:16.360
So the first thing of surrendering is important

38:16.561 --> 38:21.607
to reach the state of your Spirit, of Shiva and Sadashiva.

38:21.808 --> 38:29.697
But the second state is that you have to now think of others.

38:29.919 --> 38:34.399
First it is as they say in Sanskrit is vyashti,

38:34.600 --> 38:39.039
means individual gain, you get the individual gain.

38:39.240 --> 38:45.896
And then it becomes samashti, means the collective.

38:46.097 --> 38:50.045
You have to work it out on collective.

38:50.474 --> 38:54.635
People who never even got Realization, nothing of the kind,

38:54.836 --> 38:58.797
have been doing so much organization and this and that.

38:58.998 --> 39:03.391
While you have got everything, so now it is important

39:03.592 --> 39:09.189
that you should now extend this light to others.

39:22.614 --> 39:25.468
Forgive Me, I had to speak in English here.

39:25.588 --> 39:30.650
Many people have come from outside for Shivji puja,

39:30.771 --> 39:32.971
it has never happened before.

39:33.457 --> 39:40.148
And about Shivji – you people know a lot.

39:40.549 --> 39:44.710
And all His stories also, you all know. But what is the substance?

39:45.300 --> 39:54.013
What is the essence? What is the essence of Shivji – you should know.

39:55.321 --> 40:00.443
About Shivji, nothing touches Him.

40:00.989 --> 40:05.751
If someone says anything to Him and then apologizes to Him,
He’ll say, “Alright go, you are forgiven”.

40:05.859 --> 40:07.492
Nothing touches Him.

40:07.631 --> 40:11.676
Praise/insult, happiness/ sorrow –

40:11.835 --> 40:14.210
nothing touches Him.

40:14.355 --> 40:19.908
He is Shivji, completely detached from everything – free.

40:20.430 --> 40:25.694
Like Adi Shankaracharya has told, ‘Shivoham, Shivoham’
[I am Shiva, I am Shiva].

40:25.922 --> 40:31.595
So first during the time of Adi Shankaracharya ‘Shivoham’
[I am Shiva] was talked about.

40:31.709 --> 40:38.094
It was being said, ‘I am Shiva’, alright.

40:38.650 --> 40:47.394
To reach that state, it happens through individual endeavor.

40:48.633 --> 40:54.019
And after that the other state –

40:54.138 --> 41:00.142
the way Adi Shakti is working, like that you have to work.

41:00.513 --> 41:06.695
Otherwise if these two things don’t take place simultaneously,

41:06.883 --> 41:09.162
then what is the use of attaining Shiva’s state?

41:09.317 --> 41:10.984
They are sitting.

41:11.336 --> 41:17.223
If Shiva could do everything, then why did He create Adi Shakti?

41:17.309 --> 41:21.848
Why did He tell Adi Shakti, ‘You create everything. You do that, you do this’?

41:22.078 --> 41:24.889
He could do everything, but no.

41:25.121 --> 41:28.295
He told, ‘there is one state – ‘Shiva’s state’.

41:28.534 --> 41:34.707
On reaching the Shiva’s state you become completely desire less’.

41:35.179 --> 41:38.332
Then whatever you do; now I see that some people say,

41:38.427 --> 41:44.350
“Mother there is one person in Sahaja Yoga and he is laundering money”.

41:44.645 --> 41:46.560
I don’t understand,

41:46.709 --> 41:50.362
“After coming to Sahaja Yoga, how are they laundering money?”

41:50.467 --> 41:54.062
Someone is there who is showing his ego, his position.

41:54.169 --> 41:56.478
Some or the other crazy things,

41:56.550 --> 41:59.002
even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, they are continue doing.

41:59.320 --> 42:02.296
Something must be stuck to them, it’s possible.

42:02.528 --> 42:03.993
But they should get rid of it.

42:04.278 --> 42:09.117
So when you have come to Sahaja Yoga first you attain Shiva’s state.

42:09.673 --> 42:13.316
Meaning in which you are completely desire less.

42:13.728 --> 42:15.745
For that surrender,

42:15.877 --> 42:19.460
after complete surrendering you can come in Shiva Shakti.

42:19.732 --> 42:23.959
Shiva’s Shakti is that He is absolutely detached.

42:24.029 --> 42:29.130
Nothing influences Him. He neither has ego,

42:29.351 --> 42:33.730
nor does He have refinement.

42:34.794 --> 42:39.758
He came for His wedding sitting on a Bull.

42:39.964 --> 42:45.628
He is spreading His legs and sitting and the Bull is running and
He is just holding one to it somehow and coming.

42:45.831 --> 42:48.700
On reaching there,

42:49.231 --> 42:53.126
even Parvathi was feeling shy, ‘What is this?
My Groom is arriving like this?’

42:53.206 --> 42:55.869
What difference does it make to Him?

42:56.031 --> 42:58.020
He doesn’t want that He sits on a horse

42:58.080 --> 43:01.012
and goes in a ‘Baraat’ [marriage procession] proceeding Him.

43:01.049 --> 43:05.492
In the ‘Baraat’ someone has one eye,
[marriage procession of the groom]

43:05.630 --> 43:07.690
someone’s teeth have fallen.

43:07.779 --> 43:10.411
He is taking such people and going.

43:10.779 --> 43:16.436
For Him, he doesn’t even realize these things –

43:16.582 --> 43:19.497
who is what? Who is wearing what clothes?

43:19.723 --> 43:21.740
Whose eye is where?

43:21.833 --> 43:24.030
How a person is accompanying dumbly,

43:24.118 --> 43:26.552
some stupid person is accompanying,

43:26.632 --> 43:30.874
some half-naked person is walking along –

43:31.097 --> 43:33.286
these things don’t matter to Him.

43:33.392 --> 43:36.974
He is desire less, however you are come along.
Whoever is coming along can.

43:37.120 --> 43:39.750
Otherwise when we go in a ‘baraat’ we have to wear such

43:39.777 --> 43:44.768
and such clothes, we have to go like this,
have to sit on a horse etc. etc.

43:44.834 --> 43:49.933
And if there is ever a small short fall,
then it causes lot of unpleasantness. He’s not like that.

43:50.078 --> 43:53.841
He is going in His Baraat accompanied by people however they are.

43:54.006 --> 43:58.027
Because this is the sign of desirelessness and He is innocent.

43:58.274 --> 44:01.472
Innocent because unwanted things don’t come in His head.

44:01.605 --> 44:05.537
A person who is innocent doesn’t understand these things.

44:06.130 --> 44:09.344
I have seen that many people when they go to someone’s place –

44:09.539 --> 44:12.839
‘what carpet has been laid?’

44:12.934 --> 44:16.485
Have you gone to meet the carpet or the person?

44:16.779 --> 44:20.240
Some lady comes – ‘what saree was she wearing?’

44:20.376 --> 44:27.875
You have come to meet the person, you go to the substance,
go to the essence and understand what the person is.

44:28.034 --> 44:29.424
That part is ignored.

44:29.511 --> 44:35.259
Just what they were wearing? What is in their house?
It was like this, like that.

44:35.529 --> 44:42.670
This kind of sight – just looking at things
superficially is not Shiva’s way.

44:44.503 --> 44:48.967
Now just see Him in His own life – He went and sat in the Himalaya.

44:49.964 --> 44:52.357
He is not bothered about anything –

44:52.507 --> 44:55.367
‘What if someone says something, I have to be like this,

44:55.844 --> 45:00.510
I have to have this thing or that thing’ – nothing.

45:02.089 --> 45:09.122
When His first wife died, He carried Her body on His back and went.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.954
Who will do that? No one will do that.

45:13.681 --> 45:17.615
All His methods are special, exceptional. Because He is exceptional.

45:18.385 --> 45:26.000
About anything He doesn’t have a fixed criteria
that it has to be like this only or like that only.

45:26.887 --> 45:32.238
But if you look at the essence then
what according to Him is right,

45:32.618 --> 45:36.354
only that He feels is right.

45:37.124 --> 45:42.791
What according to Him is wrong, is wrong.
These convictions of His does not change.

45:44.026 --> 45:50.058
He even gave His wife to Ravana.

45:50.224 --> 45:55.674
Now people will say, ‘What is this drama –
giving away His wife to Ravana?’

45:56.128 --> 46:00.536
He knows His wife is a Devi, what can Ravana do?

46:02.529 --> 46:08.024
To whomever He gives, She is Sakshat Devi.
She will set Him right – Ravan.

46:09.245 --> 46:12.296
Our character of seeing everything externally;

46:12.517 --> 46:14.553
as the external ‘eye’ [seeing] decreases,

46:14.713 --> 46:20.640
the inner ‘eye’ [seeing] opens. However the person is.

46:22.300 --> 46:28.669
For ourselves it is alright that we behave properly, that we talk properly.

46:28.748 --> 46:35.238
But however is the other person, understand his essence.

46:35.393 --> 46:37.201
How is the inside of the person?

46:37.400 --> 46:41.437
Some rural people are there, while talking they talk roughly.

46:42.357 --> 46:47.220
Someone’s speech is like, someone is like this. We get angry on them.

46:47.738 --> 46:51.981
We should think ‘that is his way, alright that is also fine,

46:52.380 --> 46:55.021
there is nothing to feel bad about’.

46:55.200 --> 46:58.112
When civilized people come

46:58.215 --> 47:04.076
and you get carried away by etiquette
and realize we have lost everything with them.

47:04.394 --> 47:10.612
So whatever is made beautiful on the outside is only for cheating.

47:11.579 --> 47:14.544
That’s why regarding any exterior stuff,

47:14.962 --> 47:18.871
getting attached to it, seeing it, is wrong.

47:19.164 --> 47:26.162
Now the kind of things happening in the world, especially in our country.

47:26.441 --> 47:35.613
The outside culture that is coming in, so much of external appearance.

47:35.749 --> 47:40.228
If it was not there, people would not be like this.

47:40.731 --> 47:45.412
Gandhiji was there – poor man, he wore a dhoti and went to London.

47:47.041 --> 47:53.498
Now someone tells him ‘in London you have to wear 3 piece suit and go,

47:54.671 --> 47:57.025
how did you come like this?’

47:58.356 --> 48:01.069
He went. Let people say whatever they want to.

48:01.212 --> 48:07.104
Only thing you need to pay attention is that
if someone is dressing up like that for fun then it’s something else.

48:07.587 --> 48:16.018
But once the person is free from inside,
then he does not find anything significant other than the reality.

48:16.808 --> 48:22.364
He will accept the reality –
this is essence of Shivji you should first achieve.

48:23.058 --> 48:26.642
Only when you achieve Shivji’s essence,

48:26.796 --> 48:30.031
only then you can do the work of Adi Shakti.

48:30.743 --> 48:34.855
Now you start working out but have not achieved Shivji’s essence.

48:35.151 --> 48:38.616
Then who will be influenced by it?

48:38.851 --> 48:48.435
You yourself are ‘Shiva’ and then the work being done by you,

48:48.705 --> 48:50.556
it can be so wonderful.

48:50.708 --> 48:55.119
Someone says something, even hurls abuses, did something –

48:57.015 --> 48:58.509
so what?

48:59.287 --> 49:02.071
The word for this is as told by Shri Krishna –
‘Sthita Pragya’ [steady in awareness].

49:02.171 --> 49:06.348
Whatever is happening, let it happen.

49:06.616 --> 49:11.118
Just because someone says something, so what?

49:11.221 --> 49:13.864
But the essence that is within, has to be clean.

49:14.037 --> 49:17.038
The essence inside should not be spoilt.

49:17.521 --> 49:23.087
And in others if it is spoilt, it’s not a problem, it can be set right.

49:25.077 --> 49:31.725
If you tell bad things about others but not about yourself,
then you cannot become alright.

49:32.717 --> 49:39.179
The meaning of surrendering is that
whatever such things are there within us –

49:39.351 --> 49:42.923
forsake them, forsake them, forsake them.

49:43.532 --> 49:51.166
In the end the cleanliness and purity within you which is your Spirit,

49:52.316 --> 49:57.221
just by seeing it you will be joyous.

49:59.079 --> 50:08.341
And that will make you completely capable that you will be astonished,

50:10.515 --> 50:14.121
‘from where did I get this ability?’

50:14.783 --> 50:21.558
Today Shivji’s puja has to take place and it is taking place

50:23.975 --> 50:26.975
and you people are also completely surrendered.

50:27.078 --> 50:34.134
The other side of surrendering is that the way we have received it,

50:34.489 --> 50:37.205
we are Self-Realized.

50:37.358 --> 50:45.543
We are one in a million who have been given this blessing.

50:49.776 --> 50:54.936
‘How much can we work towards it?

50:55.095 --> 50:59.936
How much can we achieve?” – you should think like that.

51:00.393 --> 51:06.492
As it is you people are beyond My imagination.

51:06.569 --> 51:15.371
I had never thought so much of change can come in people.

51:16.044 --> 51:18.789
Never had I thought.

51:18.921 --> 51:24.038
As per that, so much of work has happened in
the whole world that I am surprised.

51:24.269 --> 51:29.848
And it needs to be understood that people
who were in the wrong path

51:31.099 --> 51:32.976
who were going towards their destruction,

51:33.091 --> 51:37.730
they have come up and today they are with us.

51:38.061 --> 51:43.925
It’s such a big thing that the reflection of Shiva in you

51:45.235 --> 51:48.865
which is in the form of Atma, this is a great blessing of it.

51:49.007 --> 51:53.575
All of you are flooded with this blessing, you just have to spread it.

51:53.733 --> 52:00.500
Spread it by surrendering and collectively spread it.

52:00.753 --> 52:07.736
It is not for one person, nor for one rising but for everyone’s upliftment.

52:07.840 --> 52:18.526
The brink at which our world is standing now, we have to save it.

52:18.731 --> 52:23.921
We have to save it completely and this is your responsibility

52:24.131 --> 52:28.067
those who are Sahaja Yogis, who in their life, within them,

52:28.487 --> 52:34.557
in their behavior, in everything, should know how to look for ‘Sahaja’.

52:35.923 --> 52:39.724
Many blessings to all of you.
