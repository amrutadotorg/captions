00:04:53.655 --> 00:05:00.897
It’s a great pleasure that from all over the world

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:08.189
people have gathered to worship Shiva.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:15.771
Actually we should say it is Sadashiva
that we are going to worship today.

00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:26.615
As you know the difference between Sadashiva and Shri Shiva.

00:05:27.951 --> 00:05:37.899
Sadashiva is the God Almighty

00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:47.504
and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.

00:05:55.047 --> 00:06:03.424
The combination between Sadashiva
and the Primordial Mother Adi Shakti

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:11.765
is just like a moon and the moonlight or the sun or the sunlight.

00:06:11.966 --> 00:06:17.286
We cannot understand such relationship in human being,
among human marriages

00:06:17.487 --> 00:06:22.112
or among human relationships.

00:06:26.951 --> 00:06:31.845
So whatever the Adi Shakti’s creating,

00:06:32.673 --> 00:06:42.609
which is the desire of Sadashiva, is being witnessed by Him.

00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:50.092
And when He is watching this creation

00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:59.323
He is witnessing all of it into all details.

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:06.597
He witnesses the whole universe

00:07:07.374 --> 00:07:12.928
and He also witnesses this Mother Earth,

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:20.292
all the creation that is done by the Adi Shakti.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.362
His power is of witnessing

00:07:26.593 --> 00:07:34.426
and the power of Adi Shakti

00:07:34.823 --> 00:07:40.313
is this all pervading power of love.

00:07:42.642 --> 00:07:49.097
So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father, we can say,

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:59.228
expresses His desire, His Iccha Shakti as the Primordial Mother

00:07:59.429 --> 00:08:05.308
and She expresses Her power as love.

00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:13.273
So the relationship between the two is extremely

00:08:16.071 --> 00:08:21.176
understanding, very deep,

00:08:21.929 --> 00:08:25.671
and whatever She‘s creating,

00:08:26.578 --> 00:08:32.747
if She finds, if He finds there is some problem

00:08:32.948 --> 00:08:38.470
or there are people, human beings specially

00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:47.408
who are trying to obstruct Her work, or even the Gods

00:08:48.456 --> 00:08:55.599
who are not the deities are trying to express their egos,

00:08:56.284 --> 00:09:01.580
He is the one who brings forth their destruction.

00:09:03.896 --> 00:09:11.083
So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power.

00:09:12.197 --> 00:09:18.901
He is reflected in the hearts of human beings,

00:09:19.102 --> 00:09:24.684
among all the creations He pulsates.

00:09:24.885 --> 00:09:34.568
But that pulses, pulsation is the energy of the Primordial Mother.

00:09:35.335 --> 00:09:44.366
And He can destroy anything that goes against
the plans of the Adi Shakti.

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:52.176
Adi Shakti is love, She forgives and She loves.

00:09:52.377 --> 00:09:59.076
She loves Her creation. She wants the creation to prosper,

00:09:59.277 --> 00:10:03.914
to go up to the same level for which it was created.

00:10:04.115 --> 00:10:13.685
She wants human beings to go to that level where

00:10:13.886 --> 00:10:18.866
they enter into the Kingdom of God, Kingdom of Sadashiva

00:10:19.067 --> 00:10:26.021
where there is bliss, there is forgiveness, there’s joy.

00:10:28.212 --> 00:10:36.455
All this is only possible if you have seeking,

00:10:36.656 --> 00:10:47.208
that you have also a innate desire to be there.

00:10:48.248 --> 00:10:58.416
This desire within us is reflected as the reflection of the Primordial Mother.

00:10:58.617 --> 00:11:05.205
Now this desire is there and other mundane desires are also there

00:11:05.406 --> 00:11:11.695
which stop the progress of your ascent.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:18.981
In Sahaja Yoga we have never tried

00:11:19.182 --> 00:11:25.482
to overcome the desires by taking sanyasa
or running away from the house

00:11:25.683 --> 00:11:30.227
or for all kinds of things that has been suggested.

00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:37.711
The first thing that is done is that you get the light of your spirit.

00:11:37.912 --> 00:11:42.034
Spirit is the reflection of Sadashiva.

00:11:42.235 --> 00:11:46.007
In that light He shows, He is just showing the path.

00:11:46.208 --> 00:11:55.700
The spirit is just like a light which is burning and which is showing the path.

00:11:56.279 --> 00:12:02.269
In that path you yourself become so wise

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:11.255
that you walk in the light of wisdom,
that you walk in the light of righteousness.

00:12:11.456 --> 00:12:18.199
Because whatever is destructive is seen through the light of your spirit.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.467
You start giving up all that is destructive.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.357
Nobody has to tell you that give up this, give up that.

00:12:27.558 --> 00:12:33.087
You yourself realize that this is wrong and we should give up.

00:12:33.654 --> 00:12:42.153
This was, I should say, my own understanding of human beings

00:12:42.354 --> 00:12:49.985
because these are the days where people are in complete illusions.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:55.459
They are in a conflict all the time struggling even to exist.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.964
Under these circumstances, everything would have failed

00:13:00.165 --> 00:13:06.948
if you had started with taking a sanyasa
and then going to Himalayas and all that.

00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:14.027
If you have to do this for the masses, something has to be done radical

00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:19.849
and luckily I’ve been able to find out a way by which

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:27.859
you can get your sprouting, your Realization.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:34.458
Now some people who get Realization have to understand certain things

00:13:34.659 --> 00:13:41.111
because as you know there are many people who have got Realization.

00:13:41.312 --> 00:13:45.005
I don't know how many, I don't keep count.

00:13:45.206 --> 00:13:51.377
But what is lacking in them is surrendering.

00:13:54.152 --> 00:13:58.258
It’s embarrassing to say but is a fact.

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:08.021
This is the only condition of modern Sahaja Yoga
that you have to really surrender.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:14.421
If you start using your brain, if you start using other methods

00:14:14.622 --> 00:14:20.438
to understand Sahaja Yoga, you cannot. You must surrender

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:27.433
and as Islam is nothing but surrender, Islam means surrender.

00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:33.685
And if that surrender is not there

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:43.258
it is impossible to establish anyone in the Kingdom of God.

00:14:46.429 --> 00:14:56.522
Surrender is not that you should give up your family, give up your children,

00:14:56.723 --> 00:15:02.139
or give up your houses and homes and your properties.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:07.441
Surrendering is here: give up your ego to begin with

00:15:07.642 --> 00:15:11.158
and then give up your conditionings.

00:15:11.359 --> 00:15:18.414
For example, the other day I met one gentleman and he is suffering a lot.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:25.633
So I asked him, "Who is your Guru?", so he gave Me one name of a Guru.

00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:31.691
I said, "He’s not done any good to you, will you give him up?"

00:15:31.914 --> 00:15:36.720
He said, "Tomorrow." I said, "Why not today?"

00:15:36.921 --> 00:15:40.891
He said, "Today, but I have to throw away all his things.

00:15:41.092 --> 00:15:44.255
So tomorrow morning I will do it." I said, "All right, do it."

00:15:44.456 --> 00:15:47.696
"What should I throw away, Mother?" I said,

00:15:47.897 --> 00:15:53.030
"Then all the things with which you worshipped him, throw away, throw away."

00:15:54.215 --> 00:16:00.829
Then he went around the whole house,
found out whatever was there which was used

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:08.179
for worshipping him, everything he gathered together, threw in the sea.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.756
And then he told the sea that, “I am sorry

00:16:12.957 --> 00:16:18.570
I have suffered a lot because of this man, now you please don't suffer.”

00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:26.720
So this kind of a very penetrating intelligence if you don't have

00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:32.964
you cannot give up. One sticks to that.

00:16:33.165 --> 00:16:38.003
I know of so many who find it so difficult to get rid of their conditionings.

00:16:38.204 --> 00:16:42.386
That’s more difficult than ego.

00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:46.473
Mundane conditionings and condition schemes that you have.

00:16:46.674 --> 00:16:51.165
We have first conditioning that supposing you are born

00:16:51.366 --> 00:16:55.175
in India or England or any place.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:00.154
After Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen most of the people they suddenly start

00:17:00.355 --> 00:17:03.903
seeing what’s wrong with their countrymen,
what’s wrong with their country,

00:17:04.104 --> 00:17:08.831
what’s wrong with their religion,
what’s wrong with the books they were reading.

00:17:09.032 --> 00:17:16.100
Immediately they start seeing it clearly,
that this was the mistake, this is wrong.

00:17:16.316 --> 00:17:20.280
They all make fun of them. I’ve seen people all over the world.

00:17:20.481 --> 00:17:27.834
Nobody says that ‘No, no, no, no, because we are English,
we are the best,

00:17:28.035 --> 00:17:32.148
we are Russians so we are the best,
or we are Indians we are the best’.

00:17:32.349 --> 00:17:35.111
Immediately they find out what’s wrong with them

00:17:35.312 --> 00:17:38.790
and why these people are not getting Realization.

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:42.016
On the other hand they feel such compassion

00:17:42.217 --> 00:17:45.297
that ‘Mother, so many people haven't got their Realization.

00:17:45.498 --> 00:17:49.254
Why shouldn't we try to give them Realization?’

00:17:49.455 --> 00:17:53.918
This is the double action of this light.

00:17:54.119 --> 00:18:00.694
Firstly you know that there is light
and that you have become the light.

00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:06.367
So wherever your attention goes you start seeing reality

00:18:06.568 --> 00:18:10.808
and then you understand that this has been the conditioning

00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:15.535
of our country, of our society.

00:18:15.736 --> 00:18:22.028
And then they abhor all that is wrong,
they never identify with it.

00:18:22.237 --> 00:18:26.507
But first thing as I said, is surrendering.

00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:36.305
In surrendering actually you develop
a kind of a state where I would say

00:18:37.043 --> 00:18:44.279
you become a sanyasi, from within.

00:18:44.902 --> 00:18:50.373
That means nothing can dominate you, what is a sanyasi is a person

00:18:50.574 --> 00:18:58.360
who is above everything else. Nothing can stick to him.

00:18:58.598 --> 00:19:04.692
He just looks at things and he knows what it is.

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:11.549
He may not say, he knows everything
and he doesn't do whatever is wrong.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:18.330
He’s so detached, that in that detachment
only he can see what’s wrong with people.

00:19:18.531 --> 00:19:23.284
He starts seeing his family people, he starts seeing other surroundings,

00:19:23.485 --> 00:19:27.970
everywhere he starts seeing what’s wrong.

00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:31.862
And he does not identify with them, is very surprising.

00:19:32.063 --> 00:19:36.026
I have seen it, I mean, I went to Turkey.

00:19:36.227 --> 00:19:42.181
In Turkey I met one gentleman who was running a big Swiss hotel

00:19:42.382 --> 00:19:46.233
and he came himself to Me and said, "Mother, give me Realization."

00:19:46.434 --> 00:19:51.467
I was surprised because I didn't see this in Switzerland
such a anxious personality

00:19:51.668 --> 00:19:54.081
would ask for Realization, very surprising

00:19:54.282 --> 00:19:59.512
that in Turkey he should ask for Realization.
And I gave him Realization

00:19:59.713 --> 00:20:04.597
and immediately he said, "I am not going to go back to Switzerland.”

00:20:05.231 --> 00:20:09.919
Just imagine! It’s, you see, it is so clear-cut

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:16.989
that this light definitely gives you tremendous wisdom and balance.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:23.139
Supposing you are walking
and you can't see the road, you may fall down.

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.817
But if there’s little light also you can see it.

00:20:26.018 --> 00:20:31.346
And this is what Sahaja Yoga has done,
is given you very little light.

00:20:31.547 --> 00:20:36.938
That little light itself has been sufficient for you
to give up so many things.

00:20:37.139 --> 00:20:41.311
Now the other side of it is the ego part.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:47.060
Ego is very subtle stuff with human beings.

00:20:47.261 --> 00:20:52.481
I don't know how they gather it, but they do and some of them have

00:20:52.682 --> 00:20:59.099
such a gullible ego that with the slightest thing it shoots off.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.478
And they get very angry for small things or if they find somebody

00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:09.299
whom they can dominate, they can dominate also that person.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:15.551
Now this ego when you start seeing it,
you just start laughing at yourself

00:21:15.752 --> 00:21:18.976
and think that, what’s wrong with me.

00:21:19.177 --> 00:21:24.021
Ego is not like conditioning which is coming from outside

00:21:24.222 --> 00:21:29.230
but ego is something that comes from within.
It can come from anything.

00:21:29.431 --> 00:21:34.008
Human beings have ego of all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:21:34.209 --> 00:21:40.463
One day I met one lady and she was very proud
and was not even smiling.

00:21:40.622 --> 00:21:44.698
I said, "What’s the matter with this lady, what is she?"

00:21:44.865 --> 00:21:48.542
So they told Me, "She knows how to make dolls
that’s why she’s so proud.”

00:21:48.743 --> 00:21:52.607
I said, “Eh, to make dolls, she’s so proud!”

00:21:52.808 --> 00:21:57.208
"Yes, you know, she can make dolls, so she’s so proud."

00:21:57.409 --> 00:22:01.893
I said, "What is there, anybody can make dolls, so what is so great?"

00:22:02.094 --> 00:22:05.216
"No, but she thinks she is very great because she makes dolls."

00:22:05.417 --> 00:22:12.875
So a man becomes stupid and stupid.
That is first sign of a egoistical person.

00:22:13.076 --> 00:22:18.091
He is so stupid that when you are talking to him,
you just get flabbergasted

00:22:18.292 --> 00:22:22.271
that without paying anything you have got a buffoon before you

00:22:22.472 --> 00:22:27.684
who is showing all joke, jokes of his buffoonery.

00:22:27.885 --> 00:22:32.399
Is something very surprising,
I mean, you meet any egoistical person

00:22:32.601 --> 00:22:38.111
and you just watch him: “I did this, I am, I, I, I ...”

00:22:38.312 --> 00:22:43.800
Then you start seeing the person,
what’s the matter, he’s not even ashamed to say

00:22:44.001 --> 00:22:50.286
things that should not be said.
Then it goes even to the sinful life they lead.

00:22:50.487 --> 00:22:56.412
They lead a very sinful life, they fond of women,
they drink and this and that.

00:22:56.613 --> 00:23:01.115
Then they start boasting about that also:
“I drank that day so much;

00:23:01.316 --> 00:23:05.721
I had five women around me.” They start boasting of that also.

00:23:05.922 --> 00:23:10.124
So, for a egoistical man there is nothing like shame.

00:23:10.325 --> 00:23:13.183
He’ll go on telling about his nonsensical things

00:23:13.384 --> 00:23:17.023
and everybody will say, ‘My God, with whom are we talking?’

00:23:17.224 --> 00:23:22.154
And then, whatever they do they justify.

00:23:22.355 --> 00:23:25.283
I asked one fellow, "You had such a bad heart attack.

00:23:25.484 --> 00:23:28.279
Why do you drink now, give up drinking."

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.330
He said, "But even this person Kirloskar” - we have one in Poona

00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:38.468
who is now, I think, 95 – “he drinks”.
So I said, "You are not Kirloskar,

00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:42.819
and even if he drinks, what’s the use, what is he gaining by that?"

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:49.289
"No, no, you see he’s very good,
because, see, he drinks and he’s so successful."

00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:53.218
"Is he successful without, because of drinking?"

00:23:53.419 --> 00:23:58.780
But even ordinary reasoning is not there, ordinary reasoning.

00:23:58.981 --> 00:24:06.102
And in the general way if you see,
even if you see the greatest drunkard countries,

00:24:06.303 --> 00:24:11.993
I have never seen a statue of a man who died of drinking, never.

00:24:12.194 --> 00:24:15.099
I’ve not seen in any country people are praising a man

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:21.613
because he had ten women or he died of drinking. So far!

00:24:21.814 --> 00:24:25.848
I don't know how far human beings can go in their ego.

00:24:26.049 --> 00:24:29.560
Now this ego is spreading very much in modern times

00:24:29.761 --> 00:24:37.199
where they start saying, "I like this, I don't like this".

00:24:38.284 --> 00:24:42.045
“What, what you don't like?” "I don't like this kind of a sari,

00:24:42.246 --> 00:24:45.385
I don't like this kind of clothes, I don't like this."

00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:49.374
But who are you, you are not going to see yourself,
others are going to see.

00:24:49.575 --> 00:24:52.448
So what difference does it make whether you like it or not?

00:24:52.649 --> 00:24:57.818
But is very common with young people, to talk like that "I like."

00:24:58.113 --> 00:25:02.331
And this is a sign of complete destruction.

00:25:02.532 --> 00:25:08.219
Because ego is not only, is, makes you stupid,

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.031
you see all these days the way people dress up

00:25:11.232 --> 00:25:16.362
and we find they are very stupid because "I like it, so what?”

00:25:16.563 --> 00:25:20.547
Anything they like it, you know, if they want to walk on their heads

00:25:20.748 --> 00:25:23.999
"I like it, what’s wrong?”

00:25:24.325 --> 00:25:29.160
All kinds of stupidity can be explained through ego.

00:25:29.362 --> 00:25:36.607
So those who get Realization somehow or other, thank God, see it:

00:25:36.845 --> 00:25:40.651
This is my ego talking.

00:25:41.153 --> 00:25:47.361
Then they start laughing at themselves, making fun of themselves:

00:25:47.562 --> 00:25:53.677
This was my ego. But also in Sahaja Yoga there are people,

00:25:53.878 --> 00:25:58.430
I said, "Why don't you go and organize?"
"Mother, because my ego will come up."

00:25:58.631 --> 00:26:04.126
I said, "What’s this?” “My ego will come up so I don’t want to organize."

00:26:04.327 --> 00:26:10.666
How can your ego come up? If you see your ego, supposing you see,

00:26:10.867 --> 00:26:16.991
something is burning, you see it there.
How can you get that burning onto yourself?

00:26:17.192 --> 00:26:24.152
But this is a very subtle type of, avoiding work of Sahaja Yoga

00:26:24.353 --> 00:26:26.827
to say that "No, I’ll get into ego."

00:26:27.028 --> 00:26:32.167
I said, "All right you get into ego, I’ll see to it, get in, what happens."

00:26:32.863 --> 00:26:41.493
So all kinds of things there are which makes a person quite idiotic and stupid.

00:26:43.093 --> 00:26:48.746
I mean, I don't know how many things I can tell you today.

00:26:48.947 --> 00:26:54.052
But also I’ve seen in marriages this is very common.

00:26:54.253 --> 00:26:59.192
They’ll say that, ‘Mother, I married this girl at that time

00:26:59.393 --> 00:27:03.237
but now I don't think I should have been married.’

00:27:03.438 --> 00:27:08.697
Bah, bah, what, that time, what had happened to you,
why didn't you marry at that time?

00:27:08.899 --> 00:27:11.780
I have to tell you these things because I’ve been facing

00:27:11.981 --> 00:27:16.950
all kinds of problems of this stupid, idiotic ego.

00:27:17.906 --> 00:27:21.170
One has to see it clearly,

00:27:21.371 --> 00:27:27.483
how this ego is working in me and how it is keeping me down.

00:27:27.684 --> 00:27:32.589
So when we talk of ascent, we talk of a higher life.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:40.038
We have to become sanyasi like the lotus that comes out of the pond

00:27:40.239 --> 00:27:44.783
and no water can stay on them.

00:27:45.195 --> 00:27:51.187
Even the leaves of lotus, no water can stay on them.
Just like that we have to become.

00:27:51.388 --> 00:27:55.483
We don't have to wear sanyasis dresses, nothing of that.

00:27:55.684 --> 00:28:02.418
But from inside, a kind of a detached attention is there

00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:10.092
which immediately locates the problem, within you and without.

00:28:10.293 --> 00:28:16.110
And also in Sahaja Yoga, you know how to overcome that.

00:28:16.311 --> 00:28:25.732
It’s a very effective, efficient system.

00:28:26.081 --> 00:28:29.567
But for that again, to achieve that

00:28:29.768 --> 00:28:35.603
you have to become Shiva within, means detached.

00:28:35.804 --> 00:28:40.895
As Shiva is completely detached, you have to be detached.

00:28:41.096 --> 00:28:47.409
And that detachment will give you the same wisdom as Shiva has.

00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:56.329
Shiva sees, we should say, Sadashiva sees the work of Adi Shakti, silently.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:01.144
He doesn't get proud, He doesn't develop a kind of a ego

00:29:01.345 --> 00:29:09.230
‘Let me see now what my Iccha Shakti is doing’, nothing, He’s just watching.

00:29:09.544 --> 00:29:14.001
But when it comes to destruction,

00:29:14.202 --> 00:29:18.750
He sees that this part is going to destroy the work,

00:29:18.951 --> 00:29:23.886
immediately He destroys, removes that portion.

00:29:24.235 --> 00:29:33.042
In the same way we have to be,
we have to see our life itself is a big field.

00:29:33.243 --> 00:29:39.283
How do we consider ourselves to be?

00:29:39.561 --> 00:29:42.857
I have seen people talk, "Oh, so what, I am a Sahaja Yogi!"

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.822
You can't talk like that if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:29:49.581 --> 00:29:54.584
With folded hands you have to say, “I am a Sahaja Yogi”.

00:29:55.036 --> 00:30:00.346
In your behavior, in your talk, in everything,

00:30:00.547 --> 00:30:07.757
you have to be a person who is extremely humble.

00:30:10.655 --> 00:30:18.194
If that is not so that means Sahaja Yoga has given you double ego.

00:30:19.362 --> 00:30:24.603
As it is you know that Shiva is known for His innocence,

00:30:24.804 --> 00:30:29.664
for His simplicity, His forgiveness. He forgives.

00:30:29.865 --> 00:30:35.312
He forgives rakshasas; He’ll forgive everyone, that is His quality.

00:30:35.513 --> 00:30:43.712
But anybody who goes against the Primordial Mother, He doesn't spare.

00:30:44.792 --> 00:30:48.709
So this is His, the quality one has to understand,

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:52.562
surrendering doesn't mean outside things to be surrendered.

00:30:52.763 --> 00:30:57.489
What is there, these are all stones, what are you surrendering?

00:30:58.537 --> 00:31:06.798
Surrendering means cleansing yourself completely,
getting completely detached.

00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:12.052
Detachment is the only way you can rise.

00:31:25.686 --> 00:31:29.100
Some people get sick, they make such an ado out of it:

00:31:29.301 --> 00:31:34.701
“I am sick, the whole world should know
I am sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.”

00:31:34.902 --> 00:31:39.278
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you just watch,

00:31:39.479 --> 00:31:43.650
how so, I am sick, all right, let’s see.

00:31:43.984 --> 00:31:48.764
Just like a spot. Just watch.

00:31:49.735 --> 00:31:54.674
I am sick. So, what’s happening now?
The temperature is coming nicely,

00:31:54.875 --> 00:31:59.842
now is going down, you just sort of a

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.054
playful, mirthful attention.

00:32:06.348 --> 00:32:12.108
Ah, when I came I had temperature,
but nobody believes I had temperature.

00:32:12.309 --> 00:32:15.111
I was so tired in the marriage they said, "You don’t look tired."

00:32:15.313 --> 00:32:22.807
I said, "All right, I’m not tired."
In the same way, life also is to be played.

00:32:23.008 --> 00:32:32.452
It’s just a play, and that play has to be seen
through the light of wisdom.

00:32:32.653 --> 00:32:37.769
Nothing is so serious, for Sahaja Yogis nothing is so serious.

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:46.414
But he becomes very serious and
he makes too much ado about himself.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.222
There are lots of things which we have to learn.

00:32:52.423 --> 00:32:58.075
When we worship Shiva, we praise Him.
You are this, you are that, you are that.

00:32:58.276 --> 00:33:01.167
When you worship Me also you praise Me, you are this.

00:33:01.368 --> 00:33:04.559
I am not aware of all that that you say. But you say all right,

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.038
if you say so, it’s all right. You are this, you are that,

00:33:08.239 --> 00:33:14.068
the thousand names of Shiva, thousand name of the Goddess,
thousand name of Vishnu.

00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:19.934
These are their names you are worshipping, what about you people,

00:33:20.593 --> 00:33:23.723
how many names you can have?

00:33:23.977 --> 00:33:29.590
Actually in the puja when you take the names of these Shaktis

00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:34.426
they also get awakened within, no doubt.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:41.219
After Puja you do feel that way but you don't utilize them.

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:45.626
So many people I’ve seen have come in the puja

00:33:45.827 --> 00:33:53.755
and they have got that power within themselves, same powers.

00:33:54.089 --> 00:33:59.060
But by the time they are out, it’s finished, it’s gone.

00:33:59.261 --> 00:34:07.048
So, surrendering has another side: assumption.

00:34:08.979 --> 00:34:13.993
Assumption that I am a Sahaja Yogi

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:20.258
and I can absorb all these powers within myself.

00:34:20.848 --> 00:34:24.479
So one side is surrendering.

00:34:24.892 --> 00:34:28.388
Why to surrender? To absorb.

00:34:29.722 --> 00:34:34.839
Automatically when you are surrendered you absorb.

00:34:35.834 --> 00:34:41.545
But once you have absorbed, then you should retain

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:47.605
and assume within yourself, know that you have these powers.

00:34:48.703 --> 00:34:52.816
There, where Sahaja Yogis fail more.

00:34:53.017 --> 00:34:56.870
First time it happened, no Sahaja Yogi would touch anybody,

00:34:57.071 --> 00:34:59.547
raise anybody's Kundalini, this thing, that thing.

00:34:59.748 --> 00:35:03.278
We had at least fifty Sahaja Yogis by then.

00:35:03.479 --> 00:35:06.242
I said, "Now what to do, I have prepared these channels

00:35:06.443 --> 00:35:11.658
and nobody is even raising their fingers.
How am I going to work it out?"

00:35:11.859 --> 00:35:13.427
Very difficult!

00:35:13.628 --> 00:35:19.655
But once it happened we had a program in Nasik Road
and I was staying in Nasik.

00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:23.708
It’s about, I think, thirty miles from there.

00:35:24.054 --> 00:35:28.807
So, we reached halfway and our car failed

00:35:29.008 --> 00:35:34.566
and nobody, no other car was coming, nothing, no support, nothing.

00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:42.057
I didn't know what to do. But these, all the Sahaja Yogis had arrived there,

00:35:42.258 --> 00:35:45.730
and such a big crowd. They started saying, "When is Mataji coming?

00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:49.816
When is Mataji coming?" Such a pressure!

00:35:50.017 --> 00:35:53.156
So they said, "It’s all right, we’ll give you Realization, sit down."

00:35:53.357 --> 00:35:55.953
And they gave Realization.

00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:59.809
That’s the first time the Sahaja Yogis started knowing that they can

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:04.179
give Realization, they can do this, they can do that.

00:36:04.433 --> 00:36:08.901
They all started after that.

00:36:09.102 --> 00:36:14.498
So assumption should be there, that I have these powers,

00:36:14.699 --> 00:36:18.287
I am not going to waste them, I am going to use them,

00:36:18.488 --> 00:36:23.260
I am going to look after others, I am not going to just keep to myself.

00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:28.870
This assumption has to come. Once I was traveling by ship

00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:34.645
and one fellow got caught up in the freeze room and he got pneumonia.

00:36:34.846 --> 00:36:38.836
So the captain came to Me ‘That see this boy has got pneumonia,

00:36:39.037 --> 00:36:41.590
we have to get some doctor by helicopter.’

00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:44.945
I said, "Captain, I’ve given you Realization, you are a doctor."

00:36:45.146 --> 00:36:48.693
He said "Who, I?” “Yes, you." "If you want, I can go down."

00:36:48.894 --> 00:36:51.717
"No, no, no, but tell me what to be done." I said "Just go

00:36:51.919 --> 00:36:58.082
and put your hand on his heart, finished." "I" he said. "Yes, you!"

00:36:58.283 --> 00:37:04.315
Went down and put his hand and the fellow got all right.

00:37:04.754 --> 00:37:07.277
He was amazed.

00:37:08.223 --> 00:37:12.618
He met Me now in the wedding – and he was amazed at himself.

00:37:12.819 --> 00:37:16.741
"This I can do to anyone?" "Yes, yes, you can!”

00:37:17.495 --> 00:37:23.607
But if you do not assume, and just sit down meditating,
meditating, surrendering …

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:26.639
what’s the use?

00:37:29.053 --> 00:37:33.281
So, you have to do,

00:37:33.781 --> 00:37:42.203
now after achieving Shiva state you have to
start doing the work of Adi Shakti.

00:37:43.912 --> 00:37:51.595
You should get this desire that we should spread Sahaja Yoga,
we have to work it out.

00:37:51.796 --> 00:37:54.944
But be careful sometimes you might be conditioned,

00:37:55.145 --> 00:37:57.970
you might be egotistical, watch yourself.

00:37:58.171 --> 00:38:02.665
With watching you can, I’m sure, you can achieve a lot.

00:38:02.866 --> 00:38:06.854
We have done, some people who have taken it upon themselves

00:38:07.055 --> 00:38:11.089
have done it, everywhere, in every country.

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:16.360
So the first thing of surrendering is important

00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:21.607
to reach the state of your Spirit, of Shiva and Sadashiva.

00:38:21.808 --> 00:38:29.697
But the second state is that you have to now think of others.

00:38:29.919 --> 00:38:34.399
First it is as they say in Sanskrit is vyashti,

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:39.039
means individual gain, you get the individual gain.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:45.896
And then it becomes samashti, means the collective.

00:38:46.097 --> 00:38:50.045
You have to work it out on collective.

00:38:50.474 --> 00:38:54.635
People who never even got Realization, nothing of the kind,

00:38:54.836 --> 00:38:58.797
have been doing so much organization and this and that.

00:38:58.998 --> 00:39:03.391
While you have got everything, so now it is important

00:39:03.592 --> 00:39:09.189
that you should now extend this light to others.

00:39:22.614 --> 00:39:25.468
Forgive Me, I had to speak in English here.

00:39:25.588 --> 00:39:30.650
Many people have come from outside for Shivji puja,

00:39:30.771 --> 00:39:32.971
it has never happened before.

00:39:33.457 --> 00:39:40.148
And about Shivji – you people know a lot.

00:39:40.549 --> 00:39:44.710
And all His stories also, you all know. But what is the substance?

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:54.013
What is the essence? What is the essence of Shivji – you should know.

00:39:55.321 --> 00:40:00.443
About Shivji, nothing touches Him.

00:40:00.989 --> 00:40:05.751
If someone says anything to Him and then apologizes to Him,
He’ll say, “Alright go, you are forgiven”.

00:40:05.859 --> 00:40:07.492
Nothing touches Him.

00:40:07.631 --> 00:40:11.676
Praise/insult, happiness/ sorrow –

00:40:11.835 --> 00:40:14.210
nothing touches Him.

00:40:14.355 --> 00:40:19.908
He is Shivji, completely detached from everything – free.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:25.694
Like Adi Shankaracharya has told, ‘Shivoham, Shivoham’
[I am Shiva, I am Shiva].

00:40:25.922 --> 00:40:31.595
So first during the time of Adi Shankaracharya ‘Shivoham’
[I am Shiva] was talked about.

00:40:31.709 --> 00:40:38.094
It was being said, ‘I am Shiva’, alright.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:47.394
To reach that state, it happens through individual endeavor.

00:40:48.633 --> 00:40:54.019
And after that the other state –

00:40:54.138 --> 00:41:00.142
the way Adi Shakti is working, like that you have to work.

00:41:00.513 --> 00:41:06.695
Otherwise if these two things don’t take place simultaneously,

00:41:06.883 --> 00:41:09.162
then what is the use of attaining Shiva’s state?

00:41:09.317 --> 00:41:10.984
They are sitting.

00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:17.223
If Shiva could do everything, then why did He create Adi Shakti?

00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:21.848
Why did He tell Adi Shakti, ‘You create everything. You do that, you do this’?

00:41:22.078 --> 00:41:24.889
He could do everything, but no.

00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:28.295
He told, ‘there is one state – ‘Shiva’s state’.

00:41:28.534 --> 00:41:34.707
On reaching the Shiva’s state you become completely desire less’.

00:41:35.179 --> 00:41:38.332
Then whatever you do; now I see that some people say,

00:41:38.427 --> 00:41:44.350
“Mother there is one person in Sahaja Yoga and he is laundering money”.

00:41:44.645 --> 00:41:46.560
I don’t understand,

00:41:46.709 --> 00:41:50.362
“After coming to Sahaja Yoga, how are they laundering money?”

00:41:50.467 --> 00:41:54.062
Someone is there who is showing his ego, his position.

00:41:54.169 --> 00:41:56.478
Some or the other crazy things,

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.002
even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, they are continue doing.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.296
Something must be stuck to them, it’s possible.

00:42:02.528 --> 00:42:03.993
But they should get rid of it.

00:42:04.278 --> 00:42:09.117
So when you have come to Sahaja Yoga first you attain Shiva’s state.

00:42:09.673 --> 00:42:13.316
Meaning in which you are completely desire less.

00:42:13.728 --> 00:42:15.745
For that surrender,

00:42:15.877 --> 00:42:19.460
after complete surrendering you can come in Shiva Shakti.

00:42:19.732 --> 00:42:23.959
Shiva’s Shakti is that He is absolutely detached.

00:42:24.029 --> 00:42:29.130
Nothing influences Him. He neither has ego,

00:42:29.351 --> 00:42:33.730
nor does He have refinement.

00:42:34.794 --> 00:42:39.758
He came for His wedding sitting on a Bull.

00:42:39.964 --> 00:42:45.628
He is spreading His legs and sitting and the Bull is running and
He is just holding one to it somehow and coming.

00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:48.700
On reaching there,

00:42:49.231 --> 00:42:53.126
even Parvathi was feeling shy, ‘What is this?
My Groom is arriving like this?’

00:42:53.206 --> 00:42:55.869
What difference does it make to Him?

00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:58.020
He doesn’t want that He sits on a horse

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.012
and goes in a ‘Baraat’ [marriage procession] proceeding Him.

00:43:01.049 --> 00:43:05.492
In the ‘Baraat’ someone has one eye,
[marriage procession of the groom]

00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:07.690
someone’s teeth have fallen.

00:43:07.779 --> 00:43:10.411
He is taking such people and going.

00:43:10.779 --> 00:43:16.436
For Him, he doesn’t even realize these things –

00:43:16.582 --> 00:43:19.497
who is what? Who is wearing what clothes?

00:43:19.723 --> 00:43:21.740
Whose eye is where?

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:24.030
How a person is accompanying dumbly,

00:43:24.118 --> 00:43:26.552
some stupid person is accompanying,

00:43:26.632 --> 00:43:30.874
some half-naked person is walking along –

00:43:31.097 --> 00:43:33.286
these things don’t matter to Him.

00:43:33.392 --> 00:43:36.974
He is desire less, however you are come along.
Whoever is coming along can.

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.750
Otherwise when we go in a ‘baraat’ we have to wear such

00:43:39.777 --> 00:43:44.768
and such clothes, we have to go like this,
have to sit on a horse etc. etc.

00:43:44.834 --> 00:43:49.933
And if there is ever a small short fall,
then it causes lot of unpleasantness. He’s not like that.

00:43:50.078 --> 00:43:53.841
He is going in His Baraat accompanied by people however they are.

00:43:54.006 --> 00:43:58.027
Because this is the sign of desirelessness and He is innocent.

00:43:58.274 --> 00:44:01.472
Innocent because unwanted things don’t come in His head.

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:05.537
A person who is innocent doesn’t understand these things.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:09.344
I have seen that many people when they go to someone’s place –

00:44:09.539 --> 00:44:12.839
‘what carpet has been laid?’

00:44:12.934 --> 00:44:16.485
Have you gone to meet the carpet or the person?

00:44:16.779 --> 00:44:20.240
Some lady comes – ‘what saree was she wearing?’

00:44:20.376 --> 00:44:27.875
You have come to meet the person, you go to the substance,
go to the essence and understand what the person is.

00:44:28.034 --> 00:44:29.424
That part is ignored.

00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:35.259
Just what they were wearing? What is in their house?
It was like this, like that.

00:44:35.529 --> 00:44:42.670
This kind of sight – just looking at things
superficially is not Shiva’s way.

00:44:44.503 --> 00:44:48.967
Now just see Him in His own life – He went and sat in the Himalaya.

00:44:49.964 --> 00:44:52.357
He is not bothered about anything –

00:44:52.507 --> 00:44:55.367
‘What if someone says something, I have to be like this,

00:44:55.844 --> 00:45:00.510
I have to have this thing or that thing’ – nothing.

00:45:02.089 --> 00:45:09.122
When His first wife died, He carried Her body on His back and went.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:11.954
Who will do that? No one will do that.

00:45:13.681 --> 00:45:17.615
All His methods are special, exceptional. Because He is exceptional.

00:45:18.385 --> 00:45:26.000
About anything He doesn’t have a fixed criteria
that it has to be like this only or like that only.

00:45:26.887 --> 00:45:32.238
But if you look at the essence then
what according to Him is right,

00:45:32.618 --> 00:45:36.354
only that He feels is right.

00:45:37.124 --> 00:45:42.791
What according to Him is wrong, is wrong.
These convictions of His does not change.

00:45:44.026 --> 00:45:50.058
He even gave His wife to Ravana.

00:45:50.224 --> 00:45:55.674
Now people will say, ‘What is this drama –
giving away His wife to Ravana?’

00:45:56.128 --> 00:46:00.536
He knows His wife is a Devi, what can Ravana do?

00:46:02.529 --> 00:46:08.024
To whomever He gives, She is Sakshat Devi.
She will set Him right – Ravan.

00:46:09.245 --> 00:46:12.296
Our character of seeing everything externally;

00:46:12.517 --> 00:46:14.553
as the external ‘eye’ [seeing] decreases,

00:46:14.713 --> 00:46:20.640
the inner ‘eye’ [seeing] opens. However the person is.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:28.669
For ourselves it is alright that we behave properly, that we talk properly.

00:46:28.748 --> 00:46:35.238
But however is the other person, understand his essence.

00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:37.201
How is the inside of the person?

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.437
Some rural people are there, while talking they talk roughly.

00:46:42.357 --> 00:46:47.220
Someone’s speech is like, someone is like this. We get angry on them.

00:46:47.738 --> 00:46:51.981
We should think ‘that is his way, alright that is also fine,

00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:55.021
there is nothing to feel bad about’.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.112
When civilized people come

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:04.076
and you get carried away by etiquette
and realize we have lost everything with them.

00:47:04.394 --> 00:47:10.612
So whatever is made beautiful on the outside is only for cheating.

00:47:11.579 --> 00:47:14.544
That’s why regarding any exterior stuff,

00:47:14.962 --> 00:47:18.871
getting attached to it, seeing it, is wrong.

00:47:19.164 --> 00:47:26.162
Now the kind of things happening in the world, especially in our country.

00:47:26.441 --> 00:47:35.613
The outside culture that is coming in, so much of external appearance.

00:47:35.749 --> 00:47:40.228
If it was not there, people would not be like this.

00:47:40.731 --> 00:47:45.412
Gandhiji was there – poor man, he wore a dhoti and went to London.

00:47:47.041 --> 00:47:53.498
Now someone tells him ‘in London you have to wear 3 piece suit and go,

00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:57.025
how did you come like this?’

00:47:58.356 --> 00:48:01.069
He went. Let people say whatever they want to.

00:48:01.212 --> 00:48:07.104
Only thing you need to pay attention is that
if someone is dressing up like that for fun then it’s something else.

00:48:07.587 --> 00:48:16.018
But once the person is free from inside,
then he does not find anything significant other than the reality.

00:48:16.808 --> 00:48:22.364
He will accept the reality –
this is essence of Shivji you should first achieve.

00:48:23.058 --> 00:48:26.642
Only when you achieve Shivji’s essence,

00:48:26.796 --> 00:48:30.031
only then you can do the work of Adi Shakti.

00:48:30.743 --> 00:48:34.855
Now you start working out but have not achieved Shivji’s essence.

00:48:35.151 --> 00:48:38.616
Then who will be influenced by it?

00:48:38.851 --> 00:48:48.435
You yourself are ‘Shiva’ and then the work being done by you,

00:48:48.705 --> 00:48:50.556
it can be so wonderful.

00:48:50.708 --> 00:48:55.119
Someone says something, even hurls abuses, did something –

00:48:57.015 --> 00:48:58.509
so what?

00:48:59.287 --> 00:49:02.071
The word for this is as told by Shri Krishna –
‘Sthita Pragya’ [steady in awareness].

00:49:02.171 --> 00:49:06.348
Whatever is happening, let it happen.

00:49:06.616 --> 00:49:11.118
Just because someone says something, so what?

00:49:11.221 --> 00:49:13.864
But the essence that is within, has to be clean.

00:49:14.037 --> 00:49:17.038
The essence inside should not be spoilt.

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:23.087
And in others if it is spoilt, it’s not a problem, it can be set right.

00:49:25.077 --> 00:49:31.725
If you tell bad things about others but not about yourself,
then you cannot become alright.

00:49:32.717 --> 00:49:39.179
The meaning of surrendering is that
whatever such things are there within us –

00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:42.923
forsake them, forsake them, forsake them.

00:49:43.532 --> 00:49:51.166
In the end the cleanliness and purity within you which is your Spirit,

00:49:52.316 --> 00:49:57.221
just by seeing it you will be joyous.

00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:08.341
And that will make you completely capable that you will be astonished,

00:50:10.515 --> 00:50:14.121
‘from where did I get this ability?’

00:50:14.783 --> 00:50:21.558
Today Shivji’s puja has to take place and it is taking place

00:50:23.975 --> 00:50:26.975
and you people are also completely surrendered.

00:50:27.078 --> 00:50:34.134
The other side of surrendering is that the way we have received it,

00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:37.205
we are Self-Realized.

00:50:37.358 --> 00:50:45.543
We are one in a million who have been given this blessing.

00:50:49.776 --> 00:50:54.936
‘How much can we work towards it?

00:50:55.095 --> 00:50:59.936
How much can we achieve?” – you should think like that.

00:51:00.393 --> 00:51:06.492
As it is you people are beyond My imagination.

00:51:06.569 --> 00:51:15.371
I had never thought so much of change can come in people.

00:51:16.044 --> 00:51:18.789
Never had I thought.

00:51:18.921 --> 00:51:24.038
As per that, so much of work has happened in
the whole world that I am surprised.

00:51:24.269 --> 00:51:29.848
And it needs to be understood that people
who were in the wrong path

00:51:31.099 --> 00:51:32.976
who were going towards their destruction,

00:51:33.091 --> 00:51:37.730
they have come up and today they are with us.

00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:43.925
It’s such a big thing that the reflection of Shiva in you

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:48.865
which is in the form of Atma, this is a great blessing of it.

00:51:49.007 --> 00:51:53.575
All of you are flooded with this blessing, you just have to spread it.

00:51:53.733 --> 00:52:00.500
Spread it by surrendering and collectively spread it.

00:52:00.753 --> 00:52:07.736
It is not for one person, nor for one rising but for everyone’s upliftment.

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:18.526
The brink at which our world is standing now, we have to save it.

00:52:18.731 --> 00:52:23.921
We have to save it completely and this is your responsibility

00:52:24.131 --> 00:52:28.067
those who are Sahaja Yogis, who in their life, within them,

00:52:28.487 --> 00:52:34.557
in their behavior, in everything, should know how to look for ‘Sahaja’.

00:52:35.923 --> 00:52:39.724
Many blessings to all of you.
