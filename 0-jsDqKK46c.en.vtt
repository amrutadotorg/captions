00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:42.540
Today is the second day of our new journey into
the battlefield. We have to win people with

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.790
love, compassion, affection and dignity.
When we say it’s a Vishwa Dharma, it’s

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.420
a Universal Religion we belong to, first and
foremost thing, the essence of that, is peace.

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.989
The peace has to be within, to begin with.
You have to be peaceful within yourself. If

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:24.810
you are not peaceful, if you are playing tricks
with your ego, if you are just satisfying

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.810
yourself saying that you are peaceful, you
are sadly mistaken.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.810
Peace is to be enjoyed within yourself. It
is to be felt within yourself. So do not give

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.380
wrong satisfactions to yourself, do not give
false notions to yourself. Don’t cheat yourself.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.940
Peace has to be felt within yourself, and
if you are not feeling that, you shouldn’t

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.620
come and ask me, “Mother, why I am not feeling
it.” Because I am not going to tell you

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:16.620
that something [is] wrong with you. You have
to work it out that you should feel peaceful

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.850
within yourself.
It is not that if you have too much of silence

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.850
outside, you feel peaceful. The peace has
to be within yourself. You have it. Your Spirit

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:44.310
is absolutely peaceful – Avyagra, without
restlessness. There is no restlessness in

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:52.250
your Spirit. Absolutely peaceful and steady.
It is for you to feel it. It is not for anybody

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.979
else to certify you. This is one thing. Secondly,
when I am telling you something, you think

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.680
I am not telling you. It doesn’t register
in your brain. You think I am telling it to

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:11.680
X, Y, Z but not to you. You are not in it.
That’s another sign [that] there is no peace.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:18.710
Because there is no peace, there is no registration.
Whatever goes into your head, that is going

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.110
to work out.
But what I find [is] that people [who] have

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:31.110
concave personalities, then they receive it.
Those who have convex personalities, do not

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:43.009
register anything . The registration is so
poor that, whatever I say doesn’t have any

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.800
effect on them. Otherwise, whatever I say
is a mantra. It should have direct effect

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.800
on you, and you should feel that effect, that
penetration within you. But as if it is for

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:04.080
somebody else, as if it is not for you. This
shows there is no peace within you.

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:21.919
Only the peace within can register whatever
is auspicious, whatever is nourishing for

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:33.680
your growth. So try to make peace with yourself.
Do not fight with yourself, “Why should

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.590
I do it?”, “I am so bad!”, “I should
not have done it!” – all these we should

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:47.419
not do. Try not to fight with yourself, first
of all.

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:51.669
Then you fight with me, “Why am I like this?
Why should it be like this with me? Why is

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:56.900
it I catch? Why. . . .?.” How am I to answer
such a question? It is very aggressive. I

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.160
think it is very aggressive attitude of many
Sahaja Yogis to come and ask me such a question,

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:08.160
“Why…?” Because I can’t tell you what
is wrong with you because it is not in my

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.729
culture. You should find yourself what is
wrong with you . But it’s not “what’s

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:21.729
wrong with you” is the problem. What is
right with you is the attitude. Whatever is

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:29.130
right with you, put your foot on that, establish
yourself on that point. And then develop yourself

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:36.830
higher.
Peace is the keynote, as I said, for universal

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:47.639
growth of this Religion.
It is disturbed by many things. Firstly, as

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I said, by yourself. You shouldn’t have
funny ideas about yourself. People have very

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:01.500
funny ideas. I see Sahaja Yogis, as soon as
they get realisation, or something better

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.339
happens to them, they start telling others
how to do meditation, how to stand up, how

00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:13.339
to give bandhan, how to do this and that.
It’s very very poor, is very low level.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.920
Try to assimilate within yourself. First grow
yourself That growth itself, will tell others

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:33.920
how one should be. Your own character, your
own temperament, your own nature, your own

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:39.580
behaviour. All this will tell others that
this is a great man and they will try to follow

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:45.940
your example. Example is the best teaching.
When the tree is small, even if he says “I

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:52.940
am great,” nobody is going to sit under
a dwarf tree! But when it is a big tree you

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:58.600
can see the shade and everybody knows it’s
a big tree and they can come and sit under

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:05.600
that. You don’t have to tell. In the same
way, when you grow, you don’t have to certify

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:13.709
that “I am great”, it just works.
Now the peace within expresses, first of all,

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:28.570
[as] peace with others. That is the first
sign of manifestation of peace. Such a person

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.820
doesn’t use harsh words, doesn’t use cruel
words. But he’s also not a person who is

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:48.240
ineffective. He’s very effective, using
very sweet and nice words. Maybe he begins

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:56.500
by using harsh words, then he mellows down
and comes down to a position where he is effective

00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:03.500
as well as he is very mild and sweet.
Such a personality has to be developed – outside.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:15.380
So, peace with your friends, peace with Sahaja
Yogis. If you cannot be peaceful with Sahaja

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:23.560
Yogis then you are no good. Absolutely no
good. When you meet another Sahaja Yogi you

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:33.360
can’t bark like dogs at each other, can
you? You leave three Sahaja Yogis together,

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.339
you end up with a big barking system. They
can’t manage within themselves. If there

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:47.339
are hundred, then it’s alright. But you
can’t leave three and four here and there.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:56.220
So the peace should be with your brothers
and sisters. They are all born out of My Sahasrara

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:06.980
and nobody has the right to insult, to be
sarcastic. Saying things which are harmful.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:15.630
That’s no friendship, that’s no friendship.
It is a kind of a very subtle enmity that

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:25.660
you are carrying on in your hearts. That cannot
be forgiveness. If you say sarcastic things

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:36.070
to others, you are not in the culture of Universal
Religion. You should be respectful. The more

00:12:42.459 --> 00:12:48.000
respectable you are to each other, the better
it would be.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I don’t know how to tell you this. But say,
there is a Sahaja Yogi, you shouldn’t call

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:02.550
him like as you would call any Tom Dick and
Harry. Like there’s someone going. “Eh

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:11.390
Mr. X, come here!” Now people don’t even
say Mister. Please try to use their surnames

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:23.370
would be better. Mr. So, Mr. So Mr. So. .Would
be better.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:31.430
Because this modern style of not using the
surname has brought down the respect for each

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:38.040
other. But I think, Sahaja Yogis should try
a new method and suggest to Me even better

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:45.040
methods, how to address each other, in such
a way that you respect others. That respect

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:54.630
will create that peace within each other.
Suddenly you come out with remarks. Very nasty

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.370
remarks they are. There’s no sense in it.
That’s not our culture. We belong to Universal

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:08.370
Religion, how can it be that culture?
So, when you try to be peaceful with your

00:14:15.459 --> 00:14:22.459
brothers and sisters, try to be extremely
respectful. When you write letters to each

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:29.360
other, you say “My dear brother in Sahaja
Yoga Such and Such.” I have seen all communists

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:36.360
do that. Any body who belongs to any party
does that. It’s a kind of a respect they

00:14:37.899 --> 00:14:44.899
have. You can’t talk like street people
and ordinary people because you are really

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:02.200
extraordinary, and all that is extraordinary
has to be expressed through you.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:12.620
As I am talking to you of this new culture,
let us understand how in many nations, people

00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:26.209
have adopted cultures and cultures. Japan,
I know, has been affected, very much, by modernisation.

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:36.730
But Zen taught them certain kind of culture
in which, supposing, you see two Japanese

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:42.910
have a car and they break each other’s car,
then they don’t say anything. They come

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:47.060
out of their car, one will bow to another,
the another will bow to another, and get into

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.839
the car and get out.
Then if they have to claim something, they’ll

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:57.800
go to the courts, but there they don’t fight,
because what is the need? And I asked Japanese,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.980
“How do you manage it?” So they said,
“But what is the need to fight there on

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.070
the street? Because after all, if it is to
be paid, it’s the insurance that is going

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:12.519
to pay. If the car is broken, alright they
are going to pay us. Why to shout at him?”

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:18.899
It’s very sensible and practical, I think.
Why to waste your breath for nothing at all?

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:22.760
You are not going to get anything.
But I have known people who drive, and they

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:28.449
are abusing every person who comes across
on their driving. I mean, really it’s curse

00:16:28.449 --> 00:16:35.449
of life, the way some people drive! And the
same way they drive in their own lives. All

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:40.779
the time cursing this, “That one is like
this, this one is bad, that one is doing like

00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:46.040
that”. Even in Sahaja Yoga. They think they
have a right to criticize each and every person

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.810
except for themselves.
So to keep this peace with others, be on an

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:57.240
apologetic mood. “I hope I haven’t done
this mistake.” “I hope I haven’t hurt

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:04.240
you.” “I hope I haven’t put your things
in a wrong way.” Like that. Be on an apologetic

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:10.949
mood.
You can find that among Indians. Indians have

00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:16.350
that kind of a problem, they are more on apologetic
mood. Sometimes, it is impossible to convince

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:23.350
them. I will give you an example. We went
down to Sangli, and you were so full in the

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:32.269
morning and the food was not ready. So they
said that “We cannot have our food because

00:17:32.269 --> 00:17:39.109
it is late now and it will be later, so better
we sleep off.” They felt very hurt, you

00:17:39.109 --> 00:17:46.029
know. They thought that it was their mistake.
Now, it is registered that we haven’t given

00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:51.659
food to them, it is a horrid thing we have
done. And then I had to convince them that

00:17:51.659 --> 00:17:55.369
they are no way hurt, they are happy that
they are not eating, they have too much of

00:17:55.369 --> 00:18:00.289
food. “No, but still it will be registered
in our name that we didn’t offer them food

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:06.350
and they slept without any food.” It was
impossible to convince them till the end,

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.830
they were all the time feeling apologetic.
You see in Indian culture, we have something

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:17.539
very great, as Japanese, as I told you, that
we are more on the apologetic style. Never

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:23.879
on the aggressive. Never trying to find faults
with others, but we find faults in what way

00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:30.879
we have failed, how we have failed. This is
something to be learned from Indians, if they

00:18:34.269 --> 00:18:41.269
have retained their culture at all. It’s
actually in their blood.

00:18:48.109 --> 00:18:55.109
So that is how, our culture is going to be
such that we will express complete peace within

00:18:55.979 --> 00:19:02.340
ourselves. And you must know that you are
in one body, active. You are active cells

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:07.340
in one body. All the cells of the body are
never active. But those who are active have

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:14.340
to be at peace with each other, otherwise,
what will happen to that poor body? So try

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.320
to make peace.
The second thing you can do to make peace

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:27.320
is to talk less. Whenever there is a quarrel
or anything, just keep quiet. You see, it

00:19:28.009 --> 00:19:32.840
will have better effect. If two persons are
quarrelling, never try to solve it, but just

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:39.840
keep quiet. Quiet is very important. More
to be silent. But it should not be another

00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:48.149
extreme like English culture, that they just
don’t talk, whatever it is. They don’t

00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:55.229
talk, but, they think too much. You must keep
quiet with the feeling that ‘May God bless

00:19:59.309 --> 00:20:06.309
these people some sense.”
It should not be ice frozen sea, but peace
which is effective. Peace that is effective.

00:20:17.979 --> 00:20:24.979
So in this new culture, we have to be extremely
peaceful people. And that peace should be

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:32.220
expressed on your faces. People should understand
that you are peaceful. That’s why I say,

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:41.470
if you are neatly dressed, your hair are neatly
put, people will feel alright. Otherwise if

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:47.609
you reach some person with dishevelled hair,
you know he gets disturbed as it is! “God

00:20:47.609 --> 00:20:53.210
knows what has happened? From which quarrel
this man is coming? Somebody must have pulled

00:20:53.210 --> 00:21:00.210
his hair, or must have something gone wrong
with him, that the way he is dishevelled.”

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.539
So if you are neatly dressed, people are not
put off so much, because they think that “No,

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:11.909
no, this cannot be, because, you see, after
all, he never had a quarrel. He’s just coming

00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:18.909
peacefully from his house.”
In our culture, neatness in very important.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:26.070
Neatness of thought, neatness of mind, neatness
of body, neatness of behaviour. How you do

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:37.950
things neatly is very important in our culture.
That’s very, very important! Which may look

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:44.090
very funny to some people. Because, whether
you hold the fork this way or that way makes

00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:51.090
no difference to Me. It doesn’t matter how
you hold your fork or knife on a table. That’s

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.479
not so important.
But it’s definitely it’s important how

00:21:56.479 --> 00:22:03.479
you hold the Aarti, how you hold the Puja
things, how you hold my photographs. How you

00:22:09.509 --> 00:22:14.759
hold the things that belong to other Sahaja
Yogis, how you respect the things that are

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:21.759
auspicious.
So that is what one has to have within yourself.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:32.820
The neatness, of piousness, of auspiciousness,
of holiness. That is to be done with very

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:41.429
great care and understanding, and with that
weight of auspiciousness you should walk.

00:22:41.429 --> 00:22:48.429
With that weight of auspiciousness. You are
auspiciousness walking on this earth, yourself.

00:22:52.129 --> 00:22:59.129
You are peace on this earth. But the way peace
is put into this vessel has to be clean, has

00:23:06.739 --> 00:23:13.739
to be neat and has to be placed in such a
way that nothing spills out.

00:23:18.059 --> 00:23:25.059
So to have peace, the best way to put your
mind right, is to think of good things. Think

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:33.210
of the flowers, not of the thorns. What good
things others have done to you. What good

00:23:33.389 --> 00:23:40.389
things there are. What are the beautiful moments
you have had, and count your blessings. Count

00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:47.849
your blessings. Otherwise you cannot create
peace.

00:23:47.849 --> 00:23:54.849
[Mother tells someone off in Marathi]
You need not pay attention to everything like

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:10.080
that. Keep your attention at peace. Keep the
peace inside, with your attention inside.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:22.830
Actually, if you really allow all my words
to go inside your brain, I’m sure I’ll

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:39.200
achieve the results but with a convex mind,
it’s very difficult. Just suck in!

00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:53.389
The another aspect of peace is never try to
support anything that is boisterous or which

00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:07.649
is destructive. Anything that is destructive
is never to be supported. But anybody who

00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:17.269
is being tortured or aggressed or dominated,
is to be protected and supported. If you have

00:25:26.919 --> 00:25:33.919
the strength of peace, you can do it just
by standing there. You don’t have to fight

00:25:35.739 --> 00:25:42.739
for your peace. But if it comes to that…
A person like Hitler when he came, people

00:25:46.399 --> 00:25:53.399
had to fight for their peace.
Now, the second part of our culture has to

00:26:01.109 --> 00:26:08.109
be Bliss. People should see bliss working
in us. People should feel there is bliss.

00:26:10.099 --> 00:26:17.099
If a person is blissful, he looks blissful.
He emits, bliss. He radiates it. He doesn’t

00:26:24.369 --> 00:26:31.369
look a miserable, unhappy creature, who is
all the time grudging, grumbling or worried

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:38.960
about little petty things here and there.
And nobody has the right to disturb anybody’s

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:52.580
bliss. [If] somebody is in a blissful state,
try to copy that person and become that. But

00:26:56.179 --> 00:27:01.830
people get jealous of such people who are
blissful and try to disturb! That’s why

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:07.429
so many saints were tortured, because they
were so blissful and happy people.

00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:14.429
We have to enjoy our bliss within, that is
important. Perhaps you are not aware of the

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:24.460
bliss that you have. Not at all aware. Never,
never before there were so many people who

00:27:32.289 --> 00:27:38.109
got realisation. Never before, in the history,
that Adi Shakti Herself came on this earth

00:27:38.109 --> 00:27:45.109
to solve your problems. Never before, that
people of very ordinary effort, of very little

00:27:53.879 --> 00:28:00.879
seeking, of very little understanding have
been given realisation like this. It’s like,

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:13.460
sometimes, if you see, like a stone becoming
a diamond suddenly. You can cut a diamond

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:22.580
from a diamond.
Such blissful state you are in. It’s tremendous

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:30.279
bliss has come. It’s so effective. I myself
don’t know when I see them. I’m really

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:41.769
surprised how it is working.
Bliss can only come through gratitude. Only

00:28:43.399 --> 00:28:50.399
through enlarging your heart with gratitude.
Bliss is the reward of gratitude. The gratitude

00:28:54.139 --> 00:29:01.139
which is not just worldly or just spoken lip-service,
but is from the heart, is from the heart,

00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:18.269
gratitude of the heart. And the blissful people
are never jealous of others because what is

00:29:22.279 --> 00:29:29.279
greater than bliss? Bliss has so many dimensions
that you go beyond the realm of cause and

00:29:31.679 --> 00:29:38.679
effects. All the angels, all the ganas are
there to help you. You know that it works

00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:45.009
out. This way it works out, that…. But you
take it for granted. You don’t have that

00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:52.009
effect of the bliss in you when you know this
has happened, that, has happened. What a bliss!

00:29:53.619 --> 00:29:59.169
You cross your hearts when you feel blissful.
Cross your hearts and feel that, just see.

00:29:59.169 --> 00:30:06.119
Feel the bliss like this – cross your hearts.
Feel the bliss! Tremendous bliss is within

00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:13.119
us. How much it has happened to us that God
has been so kind. Will you please put your

00:30:20.629 --> 00:30:27.249
hands across those who are sitting down there,
please! The other lady also. Where is she

00:30:27.249 --> 00:30:34.249
looking? You are sitting on a chair, must
you look at every person who is coming? There

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:50.070
is no need!. Feel it! May God bless you.
So this bliss when you find everywhere, in

00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:08.269
a little thing also you find there is bliss.
Zen taught that to people. They saw bliss

00:31:11.899 --> 00:31:18.899
in seeing only a moss, a little bit of moss,
and you see the moss and you say, “0 God,

00:31:19.229 --> 00:31:25.659
what a beautiful piece it is! ” God has
created little moss, and that moss has all

00:31:25.659 --> 00:31:32.659
that little little tentacles, and that bliss.
But those who are vain people can never feel

00:31:34.469 --> 00:31:41.469
bliss. Vanity kills bliss. Ego kills bliss.
Once Shivaji was building a huge fort. And,

00:31:48.739 --> 00:31:55.739
there it so happened that he got into ego.
He felt, “See because of this work, so many

00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:04.330
people are employed.” [Then] his Guru Ramdasa
appeared on the scene. He himself is the controller

00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:14.039
of ego, because he was the incarnation of
Hanumana. So he came and he said “Alright,

00:32:14.039 --> 00:32:20.349
I want you to do one thing for me”. He said,
“Yes Sir, what do you want me to do?”

00:32:20.349 --> 00:32:25.999
He said, “You break this boulder that is
lying here, such a big boulder, bit by bit.”

00:32:25.999 --> 00:32:32.999
So it started breaking when people hit it.
And inside came a little stone which he took

00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:42.409
up just like a coconut in his hand and he
broke [it]. And there was water and there

00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:51.269
was a frog inside. And he realised, Shivaji,
that, “if God has created this frog, He’s

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:02.629
also given him water. Who am I to have this
ego?”

00:33:02.629 --> 00:33:09.629
So the bliss came into him, that God has provided
me with everything. It’s just a red-carpet

00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:21.099
treatment for me. What have I done? Nothing.
It is so beautiful!

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:28.099
How many have got this bliss? Have sympathy
for them. Have compassion for them, those

00:33:31.289 --> 00:33:38.289
who do not have.
But bliss comes to you through your confidence,

00:33:41.339 --> 00:33:48.339
If you have no confidence in yourself, bliss
cannot be. And the worst thing against confidence

00:33:48.989 --> 00:33:55.190
is – “Then what should I do? Then how
can I get it? Then why not I have?” – is

00:33:55.190 --> 00:34:02.190
the worst. You fighting yourself all the time!
You are that, sitting on that, and still if

00:34:07.229 --> 00:34:13.240
you are saying, “Why shouldn’t have it,”
so what to answer? I mean you just want to

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:20.240
ask because you have to ask? It’s there.
Why are you asking? Just feel it!

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:33.960
If that works out, that you feel where you
are sitting, then you’ll be surprised that

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:43.329
you are at peace with yourself, and there
is bliss.

00:34:43.329 --> 00:34:50.329
Last of all, in this culture, you Have to
behave like people who have authority. You

00:34:58.269 --> 00:35:04.819
have the authority of your Spirit. You are
authorised. You have the Spirit. Those who

00:35:04.819 --> 00:35:10.589
are in authority never try to show off. Because
they are in authority, what is there to show

00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:17.589
off? Only mad people show off, you see.
If somebody puts a label on the head “I

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:29.990
am Inspector General of Police”, people
will say that – take him to lunatic asylum.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:40.760
In the same way, some people say, “I am
Sahaja Yogi. What do you say? I can do what

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:47.760
I like!” Then where should we put him? Your
authority is your Self, your own being. People

00:35:54.710 --> 00:36:01.710
should see in you what you are. You don’t
have to carry labels with you that, “I am

00:36:02.099 --> 00:36:09.099
Sahaja Yogi such and such!” – X Y Z number.
criminal No. 5, criminal No. 10! You are authorised.

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:18.000
Authority shows on your face. But now you
are actualised on the authority.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:25.000
You see, all the authorities are artificial.
For example, somebody today is Prime Minister,

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:31.079
may become a beggar on the street. Could be.
In democracy everything is possible. Same

00:36:31.079 --> 00:36:36.029
in any authoritarian governments. So today,
you might be something at the height, you

00:36:36.029 --> 00:36:42.260
might just go down. But a Sahaja Yogi will
remain a Sahaja Yogi. You are authorised and

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.829
actualised. Means whatever is your authority
is part and parcel of your being, you are

00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:51.339
that. Like you are a human being, you are
a human being. Now you can’t grow tails

00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:58.339
even if you want.
So now you are authorised, actualised, completely

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:09.150
moulded Sahaja Yogis. Like the sandalwood
– sandalwood is not to be told by taking

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:21.450
a vow “oh, it is sandalwood”. It is sandalwood
because every part of it (microphone stops

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:30.700
working for some time, Mother makes some jokes
about Indian electricity problems)…has the

00:37:49.549 --> 00:37:56.549
fragrance of sandalwood. Every part of you,
every bit of

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:07.210
you must have the fragrance of Sahaja Yoga.
So you are not only actualised, you are perfected.

00:40:19.819 --> 00:40:26.819
You are perfected.
So you must have the dignity of that authority

00:40:29.799 --> 00:40:36.799
in you. And dignity is very humble dignity.
Dignity is never arrogant. The sign of dignity

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:55.740
is humility. I told you a story about a person
who had gone out and he went and asked a blind

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:13.319
man, a saint, if he had seen anybody going
this way. So the saint said “Yes, you are

00:41:15.769 --> 00:41:22.769
the king, I know Sir. Your servant was here
first, and then your Minister came, and now

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:29.920
you have come.” He was amazed, because he
was blind. How could a blind person see these

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:39.349
things? He said, “I could make out from
the humility.”

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:46.349
When your servant came, he said, “Eh you
blind man! Have you seen somebody going this

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:55.410
way?” When your minister came he said, “Have
you seen someone going this way?” But when

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:03.950
you came, you said “Sir, I am sorry to ask
you such a question, but did you hear somebody

00:42:04.519 --> 00:42:11.519
was passing this way?”
This is what it is. Humility is the sign.

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:27.269
How you talk to others, immediately people
will know that you have the authority from

00:42:27.269 --> 00:42:34.269
God. See the humbleness of Divine. How it
is trying to please you, and amuse you, and

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:53.250
make you happy, in the nature, also in the
lectures! (referring to the way the microphone

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:15.150
stopped working). Alright?
So now we’ll have our Puja. I hope You have

00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:28.250
understood the Culture of your Universal Religion.
Please try to adopt it.

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.450
May God Bless you.
