00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:24.180
﻿I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:38.460
It was such a great joy for me,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.735
to come to Venice to meet you again.

00:01:49.006 --> 00:01:53.950
And I know there are many seekers in this place

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.770
and they are trying to seek the truth.

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:08.280
Without finding the truth

00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:13.821
and without becoming that,

00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:17.405
we cannot talk of peace.

00:02:22.922 --> 00:02:26.308
The peace resides within us,

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:33.580
and the human beings who talk of peace themselves are not peaceful

00:02:39.386 --> 00:02:41.820
and how can they bring peace,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.168
when they are not in that state themselves?

00:02:52.887 --> 00:02:55.684
To find the truth

00:02:56.818 --> 00:03:00.409
we feel we have to put in some efforts,

00:03:07.261 --> 00:03:11.568
because you are seekers and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.960
you are frantically trying to find the truth

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.782
you go to all kinds of extremes.

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.460
You’ve been to drugs,

00:03:32.751 --> 00:03:35.642
you’ve been to fake gurus,

00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:40.900
you have done that whatever a human being can do.

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.970
But I have come to tell you,

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.780
you don’t have to do anything of that kind.

00:04:00.683 --> 00:04:04.220
As you have become a human being

00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:06.994
from the amoeba stage,

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:10.540
spontaneously, in the same way,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.420
you become the Spirit spontaneously.

00:04:26.348 --> 00:04:31.460
It is nothing artificial that can work it out,

00:04:32.068 --> 00:04:37.860
or human endeavour that can bring forth the result.

00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:51.340
The one who has created us,

00:04:51.921 --> 00:04:57.405
has already made all the arrangements for our ascent.

00:05:06.164 --> 00:05:09.254
With all His love and attention,

00:05:09.454 --> 00:05:14.940
He has very delicately made all these beautiful chakras within us.

00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:26.394
At human awareness,

00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:29.860
we do not know what lies within us,

00:05:36.113 --> 00:05:40.700
we do not know what organs there are in our being.

00:05:46.757 --> 00:05:51.500
Unless and until there is pain, we do not know that they exist.

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:01.380
In the same way, we are not aware of these centres within us,

00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:12.219
nor can we feel the pain of the centres within us,

00:06:17.305 --> 00:06:20.479
because they are subtle

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:23.660
and we have to become subtler.

00:06:28.673 --> 00:06:32.460
But by mental projection we cannot become subtler,

00:06:37.154 --> 00:06:41.151
by projecting outside we cannot become subtler.

00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:49.267
It’s the projection inside which will work it out.

00:06:55.078 --> 00:06:58.918
Now, you all are paying attention to me, but if I say,

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:04.259
but pay attention to yourself inside, you cannot do it.

00:07:13.624 --> 00:07:16.643
This happening of the awakening,

00:07:16.843 --> 00:07:19.620
of the Kundalini has to take place.

00:07:26.417 --> 00:07:32.321
Now, this Kundalini is actually a name given to the power,

00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:37.900
which is going to give us our Self-Realisation.

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:49.823
This is everybody’s individual mother,

00:07:50.024 --> 00:07:54.820
because it is she that gives you your second birth.

00:08:03.753 --> 00:08:07.020
She knows everything about you

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:13.387
and she’s anxiously waiting to sprout out

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:17.740
and emerge out of the last,

00:08:17.941 --> 00:08:20.610
chakra called as Sahasrara.

00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:34.820
This happening is real baptism, real,

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:40.720
it is not artificial.

00:08:42.508 --> 00:08:47.014
You cannot baptise someone by just putting your hand on that person.

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.660
The authority has to come from the Divine,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.700
for a person to baptise.

00:09:04.892 --> 00:09:08.460
Such a person is the one who is

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.380
already united with the Divine.

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:19.340
Now this Divine power,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.700
the power of love of God,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.091
is all-pervading and everywhere.

00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:38.540
It is described in all the great scriptures and by the great saints,

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.747
but we cannot feel it.

00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:54.020
We see these flowers appearing spontaneously on a tree,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.250
becoming fruits; who does that work?

00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:07.620
Who pumps our heart?

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.892
Who runs our digestion?

00:10:16.912 --> 00:10:21.940
The doctors call it “auto”: who is this “auto”?

00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:31.361
If you call a car as “automobile”,

00:10:31.562 --> 00:10:36.701
then who is the “auto” in the “automobile”?

00:10:40.905 --> 00:10:43.233
Who is the driver?

00:10:47.296 --> 00:10:50.140
The driver is the Spirit,

00:10:53.754 --> 00:10:57.885
which watches and witnesses whatever we are doing.

00:11:01.481 --> 00:11:06.540
And Kundalini is the one which rises

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.340
through the six chakras, pierces through the last one here

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.460
and then connects you to your Spirit,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.180
to your “auto”.

00:11:30.714 --> 00:11:34.895
She is the power of pure desire.

00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:40.627
Now, what is our pure desire?

00:11:42.344 --> 00:11:46.620
Some people want to have a nice house,

00:11:46.969 --> 00:11:49.665
then they want to have a nice car,

00:11:49.865 --> 00:11:54.544
then they want to have a helicopter, it goes on and on and on.

00:12:01.573 --> 00:12:06.020
In general, our desires are not satiable,

00:12:12.139 --> 00:12:17.491
so the desires so-called we have, are not the pure desires.

00:12:22.244 --> 00:12:27.225
Unless and until when our desire is fulfilled

00:12:27.425 --> 00:12:31.540
and we do not want anything more, that is the pure desire.

00:12:40.986 --> 00:12:44.871
Now, this pure desire is the Kundalini

00:12:45.071 --> 00:12:49.890
and the desire is only one: to know the Truth,

00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:54.060
by the union with the Divine.

00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:08.843
In the heart is reflected the God Almighty

00:13:09.044 --> 00:13:13.519
and Kundalini is the reflection,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.125
of the Holy Ghost, the power of God,

00:13:27.608 --> 00:13:31.500
that is the Primordial Mother reflected within us.

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:38.700
It’s a funny concept, to have a Father God

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:43.220
and a Son God and not a Mother God.

00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:53.421
How can you have a son without a mother?

00:13:56.617 --> 00:13:58.860
Mother is so important.

00:14:00.987 --> 00:14:05.225
So when we say that there is a Holy Ghost,

00:14:05.425 --> 00:14:08.131
the third thing, that is the Mother,

00:14:14.518 --> 00:14:19.500
that is the Primordial Mother which is reflected within us as Kundalini

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.582
and She is the one gives us our Self-Realisation.

00:14:30.841 --> 00:14:33.054
Now, when we are seeking the Truth,

00:14:33.254 --> 00:14:37.000
we go with some concepts in our mind,

00:14:44.477 --> 00:14:49.495
some concepts which have come to us from generations to generations,

00:14:54.272 --> 00:14:59.775
and some concepts are such that we ourselves have envisaged,

00:15:00.378 --> 00:15:02.879
we ourselves have visualised.

00:15:11.865 --> 00:15:15.260
But concepts are all artificial.

00:15:18.609 --> 00:15:20.998
Supposing sitting down in India,

00:15:21.198 --> 00:15:25.911
I start conceiving “I am in Venice” – will I be there?

00:15:32.527 --> 00:15:35.099
It cannot be reality.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.460
It has to be a reality.

00:15:42.217 --> 00:15:45.940
So the truth has to be known in reality.

00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:55.053
And how do we human beings know the reality,

00:15:55.254 --> 00:15:59.605
is through our central nervous system, through our nerves,

00:16:07.496 --> 00:16:10.342
not through our brains.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:19.323
Now, supposing somebody says this is
marble and somebody says this is no marble.

00:16:23.768 --> 00:16:26.313
Looking at it, I can say it is marble

00:16:26.513 --> 00:16:29.744
because I come from a country of marble myself.

00:16:35.532 --> 00:16:38.400
But ordinarily, you just place your hands and see:

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.593
if it is marble it will be cold, if it is plastic it won’t be cold.

00:16:51.412 --> 00:16:55.620
So you can feel it on your central nervous system.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:06.926
So when you get your Realisation, when you get your Kundalini,

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:10.580
pierce through your fontanel bone area,

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.140
then you do feel the cool breeze on your nervous system,

00:17:29.742 --> 00:17:32.851
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

00:17:36.148 --> 00:17:39.700
as we say, the cool breeze of the Adi Shakti.

00:17:43.838 --> 00:17:46.504
Now, the saints who talked about it

00:17:46.705 --> 00:17:49.540
were not dishonest people.

00:17:56.627 --> 00:17:59.627
Same about the incarnations.

00:18:03.768 --> 00:18:07.369
But when you moulded these great saints

00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:12.337
and incarnations into concepts, they became dead

00:18:12.537 --> 00:18:17.035
and that’s how you find somebody’s talking about truth in the church,

00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:22.540
another in the temple and another in the mosque.

00:18:41.841 --> 00:18:45.820
Now, Truth cannot be many, it has to be One.

00:18:53.012 --> 00:18:55.460
Now, in modern times,

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.019
thanks to Sahaja Yoga, it has evolved to such an extent,

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:04.875
that you can feel on your fingertips,

00:19:05.117 --> 00:19:08.180
those different chakras.

00:19:16.768 --> 00:19:21.980
There are many things which cannot
be explained in the Bible, in the Koran,

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.060
or in many of the Indian books.

00:19:30.724 --> 00:19:35.379
Unless and until you are a realised soul, you cannot understand them.

00:19:41.831 --> 00:19:45.623
Mohammed Sahib has said that at the time of resurrection,

00:19:45.823 --> 00:19:48.340
your hands will speak.

00:19:55.245 --> 00:20:00.815
He has talked of resurrection much more than the doomsday,

00:20:12.624 --> 00:20:17.378
but the people who are in charge of the religion

00:20:17.578 --> 00:20:19.579
want to talk of the resurrection,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:24.159
they want to talk of the doomsday
because then they can frighten people

00:20:24.359 --> 00:20:26.780
and make some money out of it.

00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:42.315
But logically we can see that how,

00:20:42.515 --> 00:20:45.860
the God Almighty, who is Love has created us,

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.940
would first give us doomsday and never the resurrection?

00:21:04.876 --> 00:21:08.540
So the concept about things must be given up

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.060
and must be prepared like a scientist with an open mind,

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.340
to see the reality.

00:21:30.128 --> 00:21:32.967
You may read any number of books,

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:36.892
you may know all the scriptures by heart,

00:21:37.093 --> 00:21:39.884
but unless and until you are a realised soul,

00:21:40.084 --> 00:21:43.652
you cannot catch the essence of it.

00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:58.898
If you talk about the flower and if you talk about the honey,

00:21:59.355 --> 00:22:03.725
one about the form, another about the formless,

00:22:03.926 --> 00:22:07.300
you are just talking, talking, talking.

00:22:16.855 --> 00:22:21.460
You have to become the bee to taste the honey.

00:22:26.999 --> 00:22:31.620
It’s all built-in within you, it’s within you, it is there.

00:22:36.831 --> 00:22:40.051
Like a seed has all the maps,

00:22:40.252 --> 00:22:43.380
of all its trees that are going to come out of it,

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.500
in a microscopic way, you too have the same thing,

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.578
which has to just sprout you.

00:23:02.852 --> 00:23:07.940
But we live within two boundaries of concepts, with ego

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.740
and with our conditionings that we have.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.312
It’s like an egg which is formed.

00:23:28.501 --> 00:23:33.940
And for resurrection, that egg has to become, the bird.

00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:45.820
Today the time is such that many are just ready to get it.

00:23:56.502 --> 00:23:59.660
This is what is the second birth,

00:24:05.249 --> 00:24:08.859
and it works out very easily.

00:24:12.734 --> 00:24:16.219
You don’t have to do anything about it.

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:21.140
How can you pay for it?

00:24:24.078 --> 00:24:28.700
How much do we pay to the Mother Earth for sprouting a seed?

00:24:32.822 --> 00:24:36.418
You cannot pay for God’s love, can you?

00:24:36.619 --> 00:24:39.068
He doesn’t understand money.

00:24:43.831 --> 00:24:47.907
What you have to just do is to get your Realisation,

00:24:48.108 --> 00:24:51.195
which is “sahaja”, which is spontaneous, Sahaja,

00:24:51.396 --> 00:24:54.016
born with you. It’s spontaneous.

00:25:04.224 --> 00:25:06.427
It’s the Yoga which is,

00:25:06.628 --> 00:25:12.092
meaning is the union with the Divine – it’s your right to have it.

00:25:19.157 --> 00:25:21.820
There is no other way you can have it.

00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:27.891
Many people feel that if you do physical exercises

00:25:28.091 --> 00:25:31.180
or something like that it is yoga: it’s a misnomer.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.819
If you read Patanjali, it’s such a big book,

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.838
out of which only a wee bit is one part of the Ashtanga,

00:25:47.038 --> 00:25:52.782
is Yama Niyama, out which a wee bit is the exercises.

00:26:06.307 --> 00:26:10.081
Rest of it is all Samadhi yoga.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:16.377
So the first stage you achieve is thoughtless awareness,

00:26:16.578 --> 00:26:22.198
called as Nirvichara samadhi, when
you are aware but beyond the thought.

00:26:32.748 --> 00:26:37.174
And when you establish it, then you go to the second stage

00:26:37.374 --> 00:26:41.006
called as Nirvikalpa Samadhi, meaning the doubtless awareness.

00:26:41.206 --> 00:26:43.780
Then your hands work miracles.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:01.660
At that stage, you are absolutely in
peace with yourself and with others,

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.700
but you emit peace,

00:27:12.155 --> 00:27:14.540
you emit auspiciousness.

00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:25.140
Even a glance of such an innocent personality

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:27.820
can resurrect another personality.

00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:40.540
And in modern times it’s not difficult to achieve,

00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:50.219
but many people do not want to believe that it is spontaneous,

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:53.860
that you don’t have to do anything about it,

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:05.926
It's as simple as one enlightened candle can enlighten another candle.

00:28:12.265 --> 00:28:17.812
Only you have to work it out when
you have to maintain the candle burning.

00:28:23.898 --> 00:28:27.843
That also you can learn in a month’s time at the most,

00:28:32.034 --> 00:28:34.708
and you can master it so well,

00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:37.596
that you yourself

00:28:37.797 --> 00:28:41.100
can do miracles on physical,

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.243
mental, emotional and spiritual levels.

00:28:55.223 --> 00:28:58.955
You can comfort people by your touch

00:28:59.163 --> 00:29:02.105
in their sickness, illness,

00:29:03.513 --> 00:29:09.044
you can counsel them like great, knowledgeable saints.

00:29:20.852 --> 00:29:26.420
We had so many great saints in the
whole world, they never went to any university,

00:29:32.109 --> 00:29:34.540
but what knowledge!

00:29:37.403 --> 00:29:40.500
So you get complete knowledge,

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:45.540
which is the knowledge of reality, pouring out of you.

00:29:55.856 --> 00:29:58.180
You become dynamic

00:30:00.129 --> 00:30:05.838
and all your problems are looked after by these great angels.

00:30:07.981 --> 00:30:11.860
All your problems are looked after by these great angels.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.939
But in this country, or in the West,

00:30:25.139 --> 00:30:28.062
people are naïve about it.

00:30:35.094 --> 00:30:39.380
Their knowledge is that of the tree, but not of the roots.

00:30:45.014 --> 00:30:48.350
I think the saints know more about Christ,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.980
much more about Christ than who talk about Christ.

00:31:07.819 --> 00:31:10.380
So you become the knowledge,

00:31:12.915 --> 00:31:15.980
you become the joy and peace,

00:31:18.189 --> 00:31:21.100
but you become the redeemer of others.

00:31:23.534 --> 00:31:27.812
You redeem others and evolve them.

00:31:31.035 --> 00:31:34.694
As in the evolutionary process one fish came out,

00:31:34.895 --> 00:31:38.820
and few came out, and then shoals of them came out,

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.042
in the same way, in Sahaja Yoga today,

00:31:41.242 --> 00:31:44.757
thousands and thousands people are getting Realisation.

00:31:58.699 --> 00:32:03.300
So only thing I have to request you just to receive

00:32:04.305 --> 00:32:06.324
your awakening

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.533
and establish yourself.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.018
I must say I’m very thankful to the Giunta

00:32:23.218 --> 00:32:26.500
which has given this hall free to us,

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.178
because the last time we didn’t have any proper hall,

00:32:30.378 --> 00:32:34.765
and I didn’t know what happened, I just could not relate myself to,

00:32:34.965 --> 00:32:38.152
the crowds that were there properly.

00:32:52.433 --> 00:32:56.100
Now there is no need to ask about other people,

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.634
other gurus and this and that, it’s all useless just now.

00:33:08.581 --> 00:33:11.094
You first become your own master.

00:33:13.694 --> 00:33:16.330
I’m not a guru, I’m a Mother

00:33:18.455 --> 00:33:22.100
and I have come here to give what you have.

00:33:25.557 --> 00:33:27.780
This is all your own.

00:33:29.722 --> 00:33:32.780
Maybe I have to just hand over the keys to you,

00:33:36.555 --> 00:33:39.064
so that you become your own gurus

00:33:41.725 --> 00:33:44.706
and gurus of billions,

00:33:48.215 --> 00:33:51.500
but real gurus, Sat Gurus.

00:33:55.206 --> 00:33:57.206
May God bless you all.

00:33:58.612 --> 00:34:00.700
Thank you very much.

00:34:52.304 --> 00:34:55.260
I wish we had more time,

00:34:55.621 --> 00:35:00.060
but today is the only day we have together

00:35:00.353 --> 00:35:05.820
and in this short time whatever was possible I’ve said to you.

00:35:17.097 --> 00:35:19.870
Now, you must be having,

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:23.101
some of you, some problems,

00:35:23.302 --> 00:35:27.820
and some questions, I appreciate that.

00:35:34.206 --> 00:35:39.659
Now if you have any such problems
or questions, you can write them down

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.818
and hand them over to Jeremy here,

00:35:44.019 --> 00:35:46.340
which will send it over to me.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:52.113
And I’ll try to see if I can answer them or satisfy you.

00:36:06.137 --> 00:36:11.580
But please, do not – just now I do not want to waste time in that.

00:36:16.311 --> 00:36:19.860
Let us have our Realisation because

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:25.190
after the experience it’s better, to understand.

00:36:33.005 --> 00:36:37.729
If our eyes are not open we cannot see anything,

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:40.860
and then what’s the use of argument?

00:36:47.511 --> 00:36:50.878
Better to open our eyes,

00:36:52.862 --> 00:36:55.300
and then see for ourselves.

00:36:57.537 --> 00:37:01.620
It will take about fifteen minutes at the most.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:09.340
I would request you that please do not leave,

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.900
before it is over, to disturb others,

00:37:13.412 --> 00:37:16.636
but if you have to leave, you can leave before that.

00:37:16.837 --> 00:37:22.220
It’s going to be extremely simple and easy for you.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.416
There have been some funny books,

00:37:36.616 --> 00:37:39.789
which say that Kundalini awakening is dangerous

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.940
and I can’t understand that.

00:37:53.903 --> 00:37:56.713
When you were born, your mother took,

00:37:56.913 --> 00:38:00.719
all the responsibility and the pain upon herself.

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:12.059
In the same way, the Kundalini, who is your Mother

00:38:12.332 --> 00:38:15.580
from such a long time,

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.132
is not going to give you any trouble whatsoever.

00:38:27.264 --> 00:38:31.306
But you have to know that you must respect your Realisation.

00:38:31.506 --> 00:38:34.180
I don’t want that – please, water.

00:38:39.951 --> 00:38:42.209
You must respect your Self.

00:38:44.649 --> 00:38:48.145
There is no time left now to waste,

00:38:51.367 --> 00:38:55.640
you have to enter into the Kingdom of God to enjoy life.

00:39:00.505 --> 00:39:02.657
May God Bless you all.

00:39:09.325 --> 00:39:14.497
We have to take out our shoes
because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:39:14.697 --> 00:39:17.540
So just take out your shoes, not your socks.

00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:40.739
Sit very comfortably without any asana.

00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:43.420
Sit comfortably in a Sahaj asana,

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:46.780
Sahaj Asana is a spread out legs, spread out legs.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.940
Not any tightening, nothing, just spread out.

00:39:51.324 --> 00:39:53.324
Stand up.

00:39:56.609 --> 00:40:01.220
Sahaj asana, not to tighten.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:06.089
Sahaj asana: Sahaj asana is spread out. Spread out.

00:40:07.229 --> 00:40:11.393
No restriction of the feet at all. Sahaj asana.

00:40:13.128 --> 00:40:16.660
Ya. Be comfortable.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:20.780
You come forward, the people who are there can come forward?

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.180
Yes, please, come.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.500
Come along.

00:40:26.274 --> 00:40:27.951
Good idea.

00:40:28.152 --> 00:40:31.860
It’s all right, the baby will also sit down, nicely.

00:40:32.237 --> 00:40:34.540
Yes, sit down, sit down.

00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:39.300
It’s all right, for her it doesn’t matter shoes or anything.

00:40:39.927 --> 00:40:41.644
She is all right.

00:40:42.097 --> 00:40:44.180
She wants to take out, see?

00:40:47.516 --> 00:40:50.088
Children understand it better.

00:40:50.288 --> 00:40:52.580
They are not complicated.

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:06.180
Now, as he has told you about the chakras,

00:41:07.209 --> 00:41:10.895
I am going to tell you how

00:41:11.095 --> 00:41:13.980
to awaken your own Kundalini.

00:41:24.839 --> 00:41:28.180
Of course, there is no effort in it,

00:41:31.537 --> 00:41:35.303
but as we have to

00:41:36.041 --> 00:41:40.140
open different centres with our own will,

00:41:46.064 --> 00:41:49.381
we’ll have to just put our hands

00:41:49.581 --> 00:41:52.600
on the different centres, that’s all.

00:41:56.399 --> 00:42:01.380
On the left-hand we’ll work the whole thing, on the left side.

00:42:06.407 --> 00:42:10.779
As you will learn about Sahaja
Yoga, you will know that the left hand,

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.288
the left hand represents

00:42:14.923 --> 00:42:20.419
the desire, the power of desire, not
the pure desire, but the desire power,

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.346
and the right hand represents

00:42:24.699 --> 00:42:27.747
the power of action.

00:42:45.711 --> 00:42:49.220
So we put our left hand like this

00:42:49.698 --> 00:42:52.180
on the lap, comfortably,

00:42:59.022 --> 00:43:01.559
and also you can,

00:43:01.759 --> 00:43:06.260
if there is any pressure on your neck or on your waist.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:10.856
Or if you are wearing spectacles also
you can take it out later on when I tell you.

00:43:25.311 --> 00:43:28.890
Later on you will have to close your eyes completely,

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:33.780
because the attention has to be sucked in by the Kundalini.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.260
Like my sari, you see: now, when the Kundalini rises,

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.300
the attention gets sucked in inside.

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.780
It’s spread out: it gets sucked in.

00:44:02.173 --> 00:44:07.915
So you have to keep your eyes shut all the
time, there’s no mesmerism here to keep eyes open.

00:44:15.725 --> 00:44:19.579
But before that I will tell you about the chakras.

00:44:23.139 --> 00:44:27.780
First of all, you’ll have to put your right hand on your heart.

00:44:30.768 --> 00:44:32.281
Heart.

00:44:32.482 --> 00:44:35.723
Now, here resides your Spirit.

00:44:37.406 --> 00:44:42.340
Then you have to put your hand on the upper part of the abdomen,

00:44:42.859 --> 00:44:45.100
on the left-hand side.

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:54.785
Then you have to put your hand in the lower part,

00:44:54.985 --> 00:45:00.140
of your abdomen, pressing it hard, on the left-hand side again.

00:45:05.793 --> 00:45:09.260
Now you have to put it back again,

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.086
on the upper part of your abdomen,

00:45:16.314 --> 00:45:18.380
then on your heart.

00:45:20.022 --> 00:45:25.514
Then in between your left arm,

00:45:25.714 --> 00:45:29.820
and your neck or the shoulder, like this,

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.272
and turn your head to your right.

00:45:43.447 --> 00:45:47.180
Then put your hand on your forehead like this,

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:49.780
pressing on both the sides.

00:45:56.119 --> 00:46:00.346
Then, on the back, you have to put your head,

00:46:00.546 --> 00:46:04.859
resting on your hand like this, just for a short time.

00:46:11.806 --> 00:46:14.220
Then you have to stretch your hand

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:18.060
and put your palm, the centre of your palm,

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:21.770
on top of the fontanel bone area,

00:46:21.970 --> 00:46:24.100
stretching your fingers tight.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.420
You have to move your scalp,

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.274
in such a way, slowly and slowly.

00:46:30.474 --> 00:46:34.340
This hand, like that, spread it, the centre of it here,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:39.572
and try to move your scalp slowly, slowly, seven times.

00:46:56.254 --> 00:47:00.500
That’s all, it’s very simple.

00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:05.358
So, now, all of you should just remember one thing,

00:47:05.558 --> 00:47:09.860
that we are all going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:47:16.077 --> 00:47:20.705
And this is what we have been working out for ages

00:47:20.905 --> 00:47:24.614
and the time has come this moment to do that.

00:47:34.665 --> 00:47:38.219
We should have no guilt about ourselves,

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:44.620
we have done nothing wrong whatsoever.

00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:56.380
On the contrary, we should be very pleasantly placed towards us.

00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:06.300
Not to be frivolous, but not to be serious either

00:48:14.372 --> 00:48:16.683
– in a very joyous mood.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:23.379
Now, please put the left hand towards me

00:48:23.835 --> 00:48:26.540
and please close your eyes.

00:48:35.479 --> 00:48:37.580
Close your eyes please,

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.818
and put the right hand on your heart.

00:48:45.545 --> 00:48:47.900
Now keep your eyes shut

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:52.620
and do not open till I tell you.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:01.386
Now, at this point you have to ask me a very,

00:49:01.586 --> 00:49:03.771
fundamental question.

00:49:03.972 --> 00:49:08.202
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji,

00:49:08.402 --> 00:49:10.420
whatever is convenient.

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:14.495
Say, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:49:14.695 --> 00:49:17.540
Ask this fundamental question three times.

00:49:35.212 --> 00:49:37.060
Three times, please.

00:49:44.889 --> 00:49:46.893
Now the second question comes in.

00:49:47.093 --> 00:49:50.380
If you are the Spirit you are your master too,

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.260
so now put the right hand on,

00:49:53.628 --> 00:49:57.740
the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

00:50:15.407 --> 00:50:18.220
Left hand towards me, on the lap.

00:50:21.128 --> 00:50:24.740
Now here you ask me again a question three times:

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:28.780
“Mother, am I my own master?

00:50:29.713 --> 00:50:32.540
Mother, am I my own guru?

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.740
Mother, am I my own guide?”

00:50:57.864 --> 00:50:59.457
Now,

00:51:03.531 --> 00:51:06.980
please, put this right hand,

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:10.300
in the lower part of your abdomen

00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:15.934
on the left-hand side and press it hard.

00:51:19.713 --> 00:51:22.420
Here you ask,

00:51:25.044 --> 00:51:28.540
for the knowledge,

00:51:29.206 --> 00:51:33.340
because I cannot force you,

00:51:34.632 --> 00:51:36.632
it is,

00:51:37.964 --> 00:51:40.940
your freedom which I respect,

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.980
so you have to ask:

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.380
“Mother, give me the true knowledge,

00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.820
of Divine laws,

00:51:50.056 --> 00:51:53.340
Mother, give me the pure knowledge.”

00:51:55.205 --> 00:51:59.972
This you have to say six times: “Mother, give me the pure knowledge”.

00:52:00.172 --> 00:52:03.940
You have to say, I cannot force on you.

00:52:32.551 --> 00:52:34.263
Six times.

00:52:43.765 --> 00:52:46.100
Goes up in the Swadishthana, you see.

00:52:48.672 --> 00:52:53.839
When you say that, now the Kundalini has started moving.

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:58.540
But you do not feel guilty or diffident at all.

00:53:08.907 --> 00:53:10.907
With confidence,

00:53:11.611 --> 00:53:14.192
you now put your right hand,

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:19.020
in the upper part of your abdomen on the left-hand side, please.

00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:32.260
Now here, with full confidence,

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.264
to open this centre of this,

00:53:35.759 --> 00:53:41.257
Master principle or Guru principle you have to say,

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:46.340
with full confidence, ten times:

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:50.371
“Mother, I am my own master.”

00:53:59.359 --> 00:54:00.980
Right Swadishthana.

00:54:16.833 --> 00:54:18.264
Good. Good.

00:54:18.973 --> 00:54:21.140
Better? Warren: … Better.

00:54:34.649 --> 00:54:36.010
Shri Mataji: Better, too.

00:54:41.438 --> 00:54:45.300
Now, please, raise,

00:54:45.794 --> 00:54:50.027
your right hand again onto your heart.

00:54:50.256 --> 00:54:52.901
It seems like this Swadishthana is better.

00:55:08.324 --> 00:55:13.539
Here you have to say, again with full confidence,

00:55:13.747 --> 00:55:17.100
the greatest truth about yourself:

00:55:18.247 --> 00:55:22.484
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

00:55:22.684 --> 00:55:27.860
Say it twelve times, because there
are twelve petals to the heart centre.

00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:32.140
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

00:55:52.107 --> 00:55:53.580
Better.

00:56:18.781 --> 00:56:22.060
Now. Twelve times, please.

00:56:34.984 --> 00:56:37.205
The doors must be open here.

00:56:37.405 --> 00:56:41.900
Ah, done. Good. Yes.

00:56:47.017 --> 00:56:51.954
Now I have to tell you that

00:56:52.154 --> 00:56:57.660
God Almighty is the ocean of love

00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:01.215
and ocean of compassion.

00:57:01.949 --> 00:57:06.593
But above all, He is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:25.171
And you cannot do anything that cannot be engulfed

00:57:25.372 --> 00:57:28.206
by this ocean of forgiveness.

00:57:36.714 --> 00:57:39.406
So now please forgive yourself

00:57:43.995 --> 00:57:46.780
and forget about the past things.

00:57:50.399 --> 00:57:52.251
Be cheerful.

00:57:54.281 --> 00:57:57.096
Now put your right hand,

00:57:57.297 --> 00:57:59.980
in the corner,

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:04.300
made by your neck and the left shoulder,

00:58:04.658 --> 00:58:08.923
from the front side, not from the back. Don’t take the hand to the back.

00:58:17.397 --> 00:58:20.278
From the front side, don’t take it backwards side.

00:58:20.478 --> 00:58:23.252
No, no, from the front side, you see, across,

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:26.340
take it across, right hand across.

00:58:32.521 --> 00:58:35.402
Take it on the back

00:58:35.602 --> 00:58:40.437
and now put your head towards the right,

00:58:41.062 --> 00:58:43.340
turn your neck towards the right.

00:58:46.642 --> 00:58:50.315
Hold it tight. This is the centre catching today mostly,

00:58:50.515 --> 00:58:53.852
because we feel guilty for nothing at all.

00:58:59.665 --> 00:59:03.374
So please sixteen times, please say:

00:59:03.574 --> 00:59:06.220
“Mother, I am not guilty”.

00:59:30.061 --> 00:59:31.944
Better.

00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:40.740
Sixteen times and, even now if you are feeling guilty,

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:45.020
then you’d better punish yourselves
by saying hundred and eight times!

00:59:46.055 --> 00:59:48.740
There’s nothing to feel guilty at all.

01:00:04.007 --> 01:00:05.592
Better.

01:00:07.684 --> 01:00:11.180
It’s yours Warren, left Nabhi is yours.

01:00:11.613 --> 01:00:13.700
It’s not there anymore.

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:15.907
Gone up.

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:22.976
Better?

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.390
Now,

01:00:32.959 --> 01:00:37.420
put your hand on top of your forehead across.

01:00:42.979 --> 01:00:46.380
Now here, not how many times

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:52.060
but from the heart you have to say: “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.860
This is the centre of Christ.

01:01:03.925 --> 01:01:07.362
Now we think that it’s very difficult,

01:01:07.563 --> 01:01:09.201
but it’s a myth.

01:01:09.402 --> 01:01:13.271
We do not do anything when we forgive and when we don’t forgive,

01:01:13.472 --> 01:01:18.805
but when we forgive at least we
don’t play into the hands of wrong people.

01:01:47.451 --> 01:01:51.220
Now put your hand on the back of your head

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.726
and push your head backwards.

01:01:53.926 --> 01:01:57.660
Now here, for your own satisfaction you can say:

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.395
“Oh Divine, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong”:

01:02:01.595 --> 01:02:04.380
for your satisfaction, but don’t feel guilty.

01:02:26.621 --> 01:02:29.948
Now put your hand,

01:02:30.186 --> 01:02:33.091
stretch your palm,

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:37.900
right hand, on top your head, by stretching your hand,

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:42.900
the centre of it falling on the centre of the fontanel bone area.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:46.860
Press it hard and move it seven times.

01:03:04.747 --> 01:03:09.732
And here you have to say seven times,

01:03:09.933 --> 01:03:15.257
because I respect your freedom, that you want your Self-Realisation:

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:19.129
“Mother, please grant us Self-Realisation”.

01:03:19.336 --> 01:03:24.707
I cannot force it on you, I’m sorry,
so you have to ask for it seven times.

01:04:14.239 --> 01:04:16.978
Now, take down your hands please.

01:04:20.522 --> 01:04:23.860
Please open your eyes slowly.

01:04:27.013 --> 01:04:29.251
Put both the hands like this.

01:04:33.312 --> 01:04:36.220
Now watch me without thinking.

01:04:41.134 --> 01:04:45.155
Put your left hand on top of your head,

01:04:45.355 --> 01:04:48.820
about two – three inches above.

01:04:50.267 --> 01:04:52.128
Left hand, left hand.

01:04:54.521 --> 01:04:56.780
Right hand towards me like this.

01:04:59.892 --> 01:05:01.700
Little higher,

01:05:02.264 --> 01:05:06.140
Little higher. Sometimes it can be very high also with some people.

01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:13.555
Like this, like this. The other should be like this.

01:05:17.562 --> 01:05:19.916
Do you feel the cool breeze?

01:05:24.705 --> 01:05:29.165
Now put the left hand towards me, and put the right hand and see,

01:05:29.366 --> 01:05:31.406
on top of your head.

01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:41.020
On top of your head.

01:05:45.014 --> 01:05:47.260
Again put the right hand towards me please,

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.435
and see on the left-hand side. This is just to balance.

01:05:55.947 --> 01:05:58.460
Good. It’s better.

01:06:02.055 --> 01:06:05.777
Now you put both your hands to the sky, and push back your head

01:06:05.977 --> 01:06:09.663
and ask a question: “Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”,

01:06:15.249 --> 01:06:19.407
“Is this the all-pervading Power of God?”,

01:06:22.621 --> 01:06:24.980
“Is this the Brahma?”

01:06:26.098 --> 01:06:29.858
Ask the question three times. Push back your head.

01:06:33.034 --> 01:06:35.011
Push back your heads.

01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:40.297
Now bring down your hands. Please bring down your hands.

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:46.412
Now see, in your hands do you feel the cool breeze?

01:06:47.866 --> 01:06:51.620
Be patient with yourself, it would be there. Just feel it.

01:06:55.635 --> 01:06:57.973
Feel the silence within.

01:07:04.033 --> 01:07:06.840
You’ll feel like laughing, some of you.

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.288
Those who have felt the cool breeze on their head

01:07:18.488 --> 01:07:22.260
or in their hands please raise both your hands.

01:07:31.943 --> 01:07:34.060
Or on your head either.

01:07:35.845 --> 01:07:40.300
It’s quite a lot of people have felt on
the first day. And everybody can feel it.

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:44.291
It’s very simple, Everybody can feel it.

01:07:44.491 --> 01:07:49.273
Those who have not felt can sit for
one minute like that, let’s see. Just see.

01:07:49.949 --> 01:07:53.413
Without thinking. Just watch me without thinking.

01:08:03.259 --> 01:08:06.153
I think you all have not forgiven.

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:12.803
Just forgive and it will work out.
Just forgive, the pressure is of not forgiving.

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:36.080
Now let us see how many have felt it in
their head or in the hands, both the hands up.

01:08:46.245 --> 01:08:50.740
Yes. Some of you who didn’t feel are feeling now.

01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:52.604
It’s good!

01:08:55.142 --> 01:08:58.540
Now don’t discuss about it, don’t talk about it.

01:09:04.582 --> 01:09:06.897
They are going to have follow-on?

01:09:17.813 --> 01:09:20.531
All those who have not felt it should also come,

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:25.940
they are more there, and those who
have felt should also come and get it up,

01:09:37.851 --> 01:09:39.580
because,

01:09:47.536 --> 01:09:50.909
because you have been seeking for ages now.

01:09:56.748 --> 01:09:58.970
Thank you very much.

01:11:01.996 --> 01:11:04.863
If they want to shake hands, they can come.

01:11:06.202 --> 01:11:09.069
If they want to shake hands, they can come.

01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:21.683
Oh, you are all right, you are all right.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.643
Keep it up, keep it up.

01:11:38.667 --> 01:11:40.723
You’re from where?
