26 February 1979 Devi Puja Pune (India) Talk Language: Marathi Translation
(Marathi to English) – VERIFIED 1979-02-25 Sahajyogyanshi Hitguj, Pune India

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.721
Now as all Sahaja Yogis
have assembled here,

00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:11.367
therefore it is a ‘hitguja’ (commune or
sharing in a spitual way) and not a speech.

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.000
The word ‘hitguja’ in Marathi
language is so beautiful

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.100
as it means whatever is beneficial
for you or your atma(Spirit) is to be shared.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.467
and as it used to be said in early days ‘Satyam Vadet
Priyam Vadet’ (Speak truth, speak what is liked).

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:36.267
How to blend these two?

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:39.321
If you speak the truth it is not liked

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:43.733
and if you wish to speak what is
liked, it may not necessarily be true.

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:46.563
If you want to blend
these, it is a difficult task.

00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:49.755
Lord Shri Krishna found a solution to this

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:56.933
and said, “Satyam Vadet,
Hitam Vadet and Priyam Vadet”

00:00:56.933 --> 00:01:01.655
means that which is beneficial
for the atma(Spirit),

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.921
‘Hita’ means Spirit contentment.

00:01:05.997 --> 00:01:10.588
Even if it is unpleasant,

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:18.267
at the end it
becomes pleasant and it is the truth.

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:24.300
Imagine if tomorrow someone
comes to Mr. Rajwade

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.933
and he asks if some specific person
is hiding here (taken refuge)?

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.888
and if the person is wielding
a dagger in his hand

00:01:32.912 --> 00:01:38.267
what should Mr Rajwade tell him?

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:41.000
‘that he is hiding is the truth’.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.700
Should he tell that the
person is hiding here?

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:56.100
Or if he tells this truth will it be
appropriate, will it be beneficial?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.167
This is the question one faces.

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:08.667
So the first thing is that this
is an unauthorized gesture.

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:14.387
If the dagger holder demands the
whereabouts of the other person,

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:19.700
then who is he to ask?
And who is he to ask you?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.067
This is an unauthorized gesture.

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:26.935
Hence you are not bound to respond
to any unauthorized gesture

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.333
as it will not be beneficial.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:34.877
One needs to have the right.

00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:39.267
It is similar in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:45.523
Even though I love you all absolutely

00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:49.088
and I heartily wish that

00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:53.333
all of you should be blessed by
the Almighty in Sahaja Yoga

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:57.833
and should enter the kingdom of Almighty.

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.963
You have been given a big invitation,

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:04.198
have been offered great hospitality,

00:03:04.222 --> 00:03:08.333
and have been invited with great affection.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:14.167
But in this also unauthorized gesture happens.

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:20.421
Hence it is not necessary that the unauthorized person

00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:24.733
will benefit from Sahaja Yoga .

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:31.500
You need to have some
right, even on your Mother.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.217
We have already
lost our rights.

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:36.697
It is natural (Sahaja).

00:03:36.697 --> 00:03:39.867
‘Sah’ means with us.

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:42.097
‘Ja’ means born with.

00:03:42.097 --> 00:03:45.233
These rights are born with us.

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:49.570
The rights of this
Yoga are born with us.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:57.510
But just as we lose our rights as a citizen
when we enter an empire,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.533
similarly we have
lost some rights.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:06.567
So they have to be established.

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:08.903
It is my job to do this.

00:04:08.903 --> 00:04:14.267
As we saw in Pune yesterday,

00:04:14.267 --> 00:04:18.790
the Ganesha element (tatva)
is very sad.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.100
It was not getting
awakened at all. Now see!

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:32.223
Virtue is the prasad
form of Ganesha.

00:04:32.223 --> 00:04:35.090
Means it is Ganesha
only who gives us virtue.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.033
The wealth of virtue that we have
is in our Kundalini and

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:42.061
that accumulation is all of Ganesha,

00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:48.367
that is, the understanding of the Ganesha
element that we have is where that wealth is.

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:50.533
So no matter how much virtue
you have accumulated

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:52.420
if the Ganesha element is not right,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.933
now the Ganesha has been spoiled in this place.

00:04:54.933 --> 00:04:58.067
You know who has spoilt it.

00:04:58.093 --> 00:05:01.088
So the atmosphere is so contaminated,

00:05:01.112 --> 00:05:07.000
that even your goodness cannot be
comprehended by Ganesha.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.798
If you put milk in the dirt,

00:05:10.822 --> 00:05:15.223
even the swan doesn’t know how
to separate the goodness of milk.

00:05:15.223 --> 00:05:17.567
This is the way it is.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:26.267
So you should completely oppose those
who are contaminating the atmosphere.

00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:30.860
We have to oppose not only mentally but
completely,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.867
that we do not want a men here
who spoils our Ganesha element.

00:05:35.867 --> 00:05:41.521
If you feel neutral
about it,

00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:45.167
it is your fault.

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:53.000
Yesterday I have awakened
Ganesha with a lot of cajoling.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.833
That is, the Ganesha
element is the last of all.

00:05:56.833 --> 00:06:00.400
This is a very tolerant element.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.188
It is very difficult to destroy
it

00:06:04.212 --> 00:06:07.633
and it sits on the main root.

00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:10.265
It is also being damaged by them

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.933
and all this is happening
before your eyes.

00:06:12.957 --> 00:06:14.888
It doesn’t need any governance,

00:06:14.912 --> 00:06:16.757
it doesn’t need anyone.

00:06:16.757 --> 00:06:18.645
If all Sahaja Yogis decide

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.000
it will not take any
time at all.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.303
The Ganesha element has
deteriorated here in Pune.

00:06:27.303 --> 00:06:32.200
So see how big the
assault it is on Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:39.900
Then yesterday we awakened Ganesha
in all of us by persuading and cajoling Ganesha.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.484
When He awakened, many
people got their self realization.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.077
Now you will say, ‘We
didn’t go there, Mataji.

00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:52.433
We are opposed to him.

00:06:52.477 --> 00:06:55.090
We haven’t even seen his face,

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.067
yet why is our Ganesha
element deteriorating?

00:06:59.067 --> 00:07:05.717
’ Whatever is in the well(environment)
will surely come (affect you).

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:12.090
So, the responsibility of the Ganesh
element going bad here is on the Sahaja Yogis

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.490
here, this is the first
thing to keep in mind.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.210
How to set it right?

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.170
How to establish Ganesha?

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:21.585
You should ask me all these things

00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:25.667
or these people know
how to clean them.

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:30.700
Ganesha should be
invoked in every Sahaja Yogi.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.270
Not only this, but should be
awakened and established.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.405
We really have some few people

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:41.067
in whom
Ganesha is fully awakened and

00:07:41.067 --> 00:07:45.233
it is by the Ganesha principle
that we awaken the Kundalini.

00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:47.921
Because unless Ganesha

00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:52.333
gives permission ,
Kundalini will not rise up.

00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:57.500
Unless and until he allows
kundalini will not rise up.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.680
The work of Kundalini will slow
down where this element falls short.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.800
Even yesterday its force was low.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.400
It needs the force
of Ganesha principle.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.247
So, I would like to say to
the Sahaja Yogis of Pune,

00:08:11.247 --> 00:08:13.930
that the element (principle) of Ganesha
should be strengthened on our side.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.118
I will tell you how to do it

00:08:16.142 --> 00:08:18.370
because this is a beneficial
communication (Hitguj)

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:24.933
The first thing is that
it is a vow of holiness.

00:08:24.933 --> 00:08:27.691
So the defects that happen to
Ganesha

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:30.600
happens firstly from the eye.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.733
Ganesha has a direct relation with the eyes

00:08:34.733 --> 00:08:39.003
and this Ganesha element itself has
become later on Christ element.

00:08:39.003 --> 00:08:45.790
So in the middle of it where the optic
thalamus cross or optic nerves cross,

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.003
at that place is the centre of agya chakra

00:08:49.037 --> 00:08:54.590
and the agnya chakra is the manifestation
of the Ganesha element.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.270
It is a manifestation.

00:08:56.283 --> 00:08:58.488
So, if Ganesh element itself has gone bad,

00:08:58.512 --> 00:09:04.867
then it must be understood that some
wrong has happened through our eyes.

00:09:04.867 --> 00:09:11.403
One must first know that the Ganesha
element is made up of the earth element.

00:09:11.403 --> 00:09:16.343
As you know, Gauri had created
Ganesha by removing grime from the body.

00:09:16.343 --> 00:09:22.233
That means, Ganesha is made by
vibrating the whole earth element.

00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:25.465
The earth element is very
sacred

00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:30.400
and its power is to absorb.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:36.633
No other element is
so strong in absorbing.

00:09:36.633 --> 00:09:37.493
Such is the earth element.

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:39.367
Earth is my mother.

00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:40.827
She is your grandmother.

00:09:40.827 --> 00:09:45.400
So you have a strong
dual relationship with her.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.138
She your grandmother,

00:09:48.162 --> 00:09:53.700
she can pull out all your faults, and
can imbibe the Ganesha element in you.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.067
For that, you have
to fix your eyes first.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.800
Always keep your
gaze on the ground.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.350
You keep your gaze
on the greenary

00:10:06.383 --> 00:10:10.310
or always walk on the greenary.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:13.655
In the morning if you walk on the
dew,

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:16.133
it gives comfort peace to the eyes.

00:10:16.133 --> 00:10:18.997
But the eyes should
always be down.

00:10:18.997 --> 00:10:22.005
Again eye movements
should not be done too much.

00:10:22.057 --> 00:10:28.497
Every time something happens you should
not divert your attention this or that way.

00:10:28.497 --> 00:10:32.977
So think about what it could be and
then slowly turn your eyes and see.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:37.890
People who have a lot of eye movement
adversely affect their Ganesha element.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:41.065
It is part of flirting

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:45.690
when we feel
compelled to look at every woman.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.830
If we don’t look initially then we keep
on turning our head to have a glimpse.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.010
These are some dirty practices
that have emerged of late.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:58.211
When we were young,
our brothers and others were

00:10:58.235 --> 00:11:01.950
warned to keep their eyes
to the ground while walking.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:05.045
Even today people of those days are

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:09.995
identified by the fact that they do not raise
their necks and look here and there while walking.

00:11:09.995 --> 00:11:12.523
In the past such a
person was called idiotic.

00:11:12.523 --> 00:11:16.133
What is this walking like an idiot
looking here and there.

00:11:16.133 --> 00:11:19.023
The gaze should be
kept down to the ground.

00:11:19.023 --> 00:11:21.667
We have the example
of Lakshmana.

00:11:21.667 --> 00:11:23.470
Sita was his sister-in-law.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.003
Now we do banter and
joke with our sister-in-law.

00:11:26.003 --> 00:11:29.900
Even while talking to her he
used to look at her feet only.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.267
Never used to look up.

00:11:33.267 --> 00:11:41.050
So much respect
he must have had.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.867
So the gaze should
be at the feet.

00:11:43.867 --> 00:11:46.600
Do not look in the
upward direction.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.333
If someone does speak and ask,

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:56.500
then look
up slowly with great respect and reverence.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.433
This movement of the
eyes helps in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:04.117
You know our people from London.

00:12:04.117 --> 00:12:07.967
How deplorable their
condition has become.

00:12:07.967 --> 00:12:09.723
How awkward their
position has become.

00:12:09.723 --> 00:12:12.123
As soon as a few of them came
here, you were in so much trouble.

00:12:12.123 --> 00:12:13.337
There all are like this.

00:12:13.337 --> 00:12:16.400
I don’t understand
why they need a guru.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:22.300
They have all the dirty knowledge
that they will teach this man hundred times.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.000
So they don’t have
this (Ganesh Tatva).

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.933
They have lost it completely.

00:12:28.977 --> 00:12:36.667
Even then they have worked on their earth
element and have improved their situation.

00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:40.083
Secondly, stand on the earth element and
pour water on the feet,

00:12:40.083 --> 00:12:46.567
raise both hands towards the sky or
even taking my name will also work.

00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:49.450
So the earth absorbs
through the water.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.833
You will be surprised
you will feel very relieved.

00:12:53.833 --> 00:13:01.567
Also lying on the earth,

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:06.100
greeting
her, apologizing to her,

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.621
‘forgive us for touching
you with our feet.’

00:13:10.645 --> 00:13:14.667
With the awakening of the earth
element, the Ganesha within us,

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:16.733
which is the essence of the
earth element,

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:20.988
it is the principle of
sustenance of the earth element

00:13:21.012 --> 00:13:27.090
meaning the complete flow on this
earth it is all due to Shri Ganesha.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:33.233
And this contemplation which we call
as meditation is the manifestation of Shri Ganesha.

00:13:33.233 --> 00:13:37.077
Unless we have the
sustenance(dharana), nothing can happen.

00:13:37.077 --> 00:13:41.450
So nothing can happen without
first worshiping Shri Ganesha.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:45.133
All the eight Vinayakas (Ganesh
occurrences) are in Maharashtra.

00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:46.267
How great this is !

00:13:46.267 --> 00:13:47.593
But even there,
filth everywhere!

00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:57.357
Recently I had been to Ranjangaon
Ganapati, the vibrations were very low!

00:13:57.357 --> 00:13:58.357
Very little!

00:13:58.377 --> 00:14:00.400
Though awakened last time.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.567
Went back again,
apologized for everyone.

00:14:05.567 --> 00:14:08.600
I also become devotee for you,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:14.200
that ‘let it go, they don’t
understand. You are very powerful.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.483
So please awaken in them.

00:14:16.483 --> 00:14:18.400
What to say about you?

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.600
You are a very pure principle,

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.988
but these people do not understand anything.
They are still ignorant. So please forgive them.’

00:14:25.012 --> 00:14:29.133
There are dirty songs from
movies blaring in front of Him.

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:31.133
Now what to say to about this?

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.997
This is unathorised practice(tantrik type)

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:35.850
To create filth before God.
So the ghosts(bhoots) come there.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.000
Use those ghost(bhoots).

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.767
Pretend to be a ascetic and say that we have
renounced the world and then create filth.

00:14:42.767 --> 00:14:45.610
Behave in a manner that
does not suit an ascetic.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:52.567
That means, from here, whatever divine element or essence(tatva)  is there, that  principle goes away.

00:14:52.567 --> 00:14:55.283
Once it goes, the ghosts arrive.

00:14:55.283 --> 00:15:00.467
In this way, ghosts establish
their rule replacing the Almighty.

00:15:00.467 --> 00:15:07.277
So it should be noted that we have seen
black shadows on my photos sometimes.

00:15:07.277 --> 00:15:07.728
Surprisingly,

00:15:07.753 --> 00:15:10.623
my ( Shri Mataji's)
attention shifted from there!  I am not there at all.

00:15:10.623 --> 00:15:11.983
Despite the photos.

00:15:11.983 --> 00:15:17.033
I mean, the photo depicts me in
person, but a dark shadow creeps over it.

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:20.721
The reason is that some unholy things
happen in front of that photo

00:15:20.745 --> 00:15:26.672
or someone has accused me
of something or something else.

00:15:26.672 --> 00:15:31.633
It happens with me too.

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:36.400
Most of the time I am really good
but suddenly I lose my attention.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.267
I simply cannot notice that.

00:15:38.297 --> 00:15:43.923
Means in spite of all my efforts to
pay attention to a particular individual,

00:15:43.923 --> 00:15:46.800
I would not be able to connect.
My attention will just drift away.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.023
People say, ‘He is such an important
minister, Mataji, why don’t you consider!’

00:15:52.023 --> 00:15:55.900
‘But somehow, could not meet him.
Whichever way, it doesn't not work out'

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.607
”They are such important people,
you should definitely meet them etc..etc.’

00:16:00.607 --> 00:16:03.287
‘It never could take place,
somehow could not be aligned’.

00:16:03.287 --> 00:16:04.967
‘I could not manage it.

00:16:04.987 --> 00:16:07.517
by some or the other
reason something will happen’

00:16:07.541 --> 00:16:14.021
The Almighty’s attention is also very holy.

00:16:14.021 --> 00:16:16.754
And a little bit
impurity is tolerable.

00:16:16.768 --> 00:16:19.145
If a person is very fond of cleanliness

00:16:19.169 --> 00:16:20.449
and
you tell him to stand in the dirt,

00:16:20.473 --> 00:16:22.778
Will he stay?

00:16:22.802 --> 00:16:24.443
He won’t be
fighting with that dirt.

00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:27.533
Will go away from there.
No, not at all.

00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:30.873
Such is the purity of
the Ganesh element.

00:16:30.873 --> 00:16:34.455
Even though it tries to tolerate

00:16:34.479 --> 00:16:37.703
a lot, still His a
ttention withers away.

00:16:37.703 --> 00:16:41.313
So it is the special
responsibility of the Sahaja Yogis

00:16:41.337 --> 00:16:44.600
here that they should
establish the Ganesh element.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.877
This means that people purchase Ganesh Idol

00:16:49.877 --> 00:16:53.200
and install it at home for worshipping.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.433
But we cannot purchase the idol.

00:16:58.433 --> 00:17:05.067
Because the person from whom we purchased
what mindset he had while making it,

00:17:05.067 --> 00:17:08.533
did he have vibrations, from
where did he bring the soil.

00:17:08.533 --> 00:17:13.533
He took money for that,
he sold the Almighty.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:18.867
How deplorable.
Can you sell the Almighty?

00:17:18.867 --> 00:17:22.033
How can we purchase the idol?

00:17:22.033 --> 00:17:26.567
Can you purchase me?

00:17:26.567 --> 00:17:31.967
People just say Mataji we
have installed Ganapati at home.

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:37.233
Need to see the
idol, and its chakras.

00:17:37.233 --> 00:17:40.967
Need to examine the formulation.

00:17:40.967 --> 00:17:46.833
And there are few such
idols, really very few.

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:51.233
I have only one Ganapati idol.

00:17:51.233 --> 00:17:53.333
Only one.

00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:55.300
Once we had been to Sangli.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.200
One of my accomplished devotees
made it with his own hands.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:00.585
and that too is made of wood.

00:18:00.609 --> 00:18:04.903
And I suggested
that it should be installed in cow dung.

00:18:04.903 --> 00:18:08.797
Its colour is like mud – Such
is the beautiful Ganapati.

00:18:08.797 --> 00:18:15.033
This is one Ganapati I have seen – He
is so wise,he is so wise

00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:16.443
It has such strong vibrations.

00:18:16.443 --> 00:18:21.733
Once, in London, a
gentleman came to see me.

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:26.833
and he thought that he should first go upstairs
and have the divine vision(darshan) of Ganapati.

00:18:26.833 --> 00:18:27.900
So he went upstairs.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.083
And there he paid his
respects to Ganapati.

00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:31.437
But it had no vibrations.

00:18:31.437 --> 00:18:34.897
He was terrified and taken
aback. ‘ Whats wrong with me?

00:18:34.897 --> 00:18:38.617
I was having such strong
vibrations but after I came

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:40.177
in front of the Ganapati
there are no vibrations.

00:18:40.177 --> 00:18:41.381
What has happened?’

00:18:41.405 --> 00:18:45.967
Eventually he started
thinking what happened.

00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:48.867
So Ganapati also bestows
wisdom on such people too.

00:18:48.867 --> 00:18:53.351
So he wisely realized ‘I have not
yet paid my respects to Shri Mataji.

00:18:53.375 --> 00:18:54.957
So Ganapati did not appreciate this.

00:18:54.957 --> 00:18:56.405
Let me first go and pay my
respects to Her.’

00:18:56.423 --> 00:18:58.933
Because Ganapati does not need
anything except Mother.

00:18:58.933 --> 00:19:01.993
He came down running and
fell at my feet holding his ears.

00:19:01.993 --> 00:19:06.467
‘Mataji, you were inside.
Forgive me.’

00:19:06.467 --> 00:19:09.077
And again went
up and felt very strong vibrations.

00:19:09.077 --> 00:19:10.810
He also apologized to Him.

00:19:10.823 --> 00:19:15.323
Ganapati cannot think of
even Lord Shiva without Mother.

00:19:15.323 --> 00:19:17.300
Cannot think at all.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.308
Knows only one principle
– Mother and her power.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:26.500
That is why he is so great and is
worshipped by all gods and goddesses.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:35.243
Shiva Shankar, whom we say stays till end
and is present forever.

00:19:35.243 --> 00:19:39.533
He too worships Shri Ganesha.

00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:45.700
Then what to say about others
like Bramhadev and Vishnu.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:48.163
Maharashtra is blessed by Him.

00:19:48.163 --> 00:19:49.537
We know what Ganapati is.

00:19:49.537 --> 00:19:53.800
And we have Ganapati’s mention all
the time and we also believe in Ganapati.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.567
It is very rare to find a Maharashtrian (person who
lives in Maharashtra) who does not know Ganapati.

00:19:57.567 --> 00:20:02.900
Hence Ganapati should be worshipped first
properly and

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.400
even I thought yesterday what
should I tell Sahaja Yogis in Pune.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.080
Something new, special.

00:20:09.087 --> 00:20:13.567
So it this that purify your Ganesh
(element), establish within yourself.

00:20:13.567 --> 00:20:16.767
Understand the Ganesh element.

00:20:16.767 --> 00:20:20.533
There was this
gentleman from Sangli.

00:20:20.533 --> 00:20:22.833
His Ganesh Tatva
(element) is very good.

00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:27.227
While his upper is a bit spoilt,
his Ganesh element is very strong.

00:20:27.227 --> 00:20:30.633
I am very happy about it.

00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:32.727
Similarly we have
our Dhumal Saheb.

00:20:32.727 --> 00:20:35.180
He stays in the village.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.867
Always connected to earth.

00:20:37.867 --> 00:20:45.233
So farmers have a tremendous inheritance
that they always have Ganapati’s blessings.

00:20:45.233 --> 00:20:48.283
That is why I have started
the work in villages first.

00:20:48.283 --> 00:20:52.683
Because it will happen easily there – wherever there
are Ganapati devotees, it will happen first there.

00:20:52.683 --> 00:20:54.864
They do not sit for worshipping Ganapati

00:20:54.888 --> 00:21:00.067
but the Ganapati in them is awakened.

00:21:00.067 --> 00:21:07.067
More artificial the life becomes,
the lesser is the awareness.

00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:11.333
So the first thing is that
we set our Ganapati right.

00:21:11.333 --> 00:21:15.001
What all we need to do,
what spiritual practice we should follow,

00:21:15.025 --> 00:21:17.247
this all you ask our other Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:17.247 --> 00:21:20.715
But if I could awaken Ganapati
for the London Sahaja Yogis,

00:21:20.739 --> 00:21:23.667
then it has to happen
with you, no doubt about it.

00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:25.658
After this how much the powers increase

00:21:25.682 --> 00:21:29.033
and how much force
Kundalini gains, is something to be seen.

00:21:29.033 --> 00:21:31.888
So, after paying obeisance
to such Ganapati,

00:21:31.912 --> 00:21:34.467
I proceed
to tell you further about Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:39.000
You know what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.730
You know a lot.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.500
All people here are
Sahaja Yogis so I need not tell them.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.040
Now there is a big question.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.327
The question was there even
yesterday and it is there even today.

00:21:50.327 --> 00:21:51.833
Why does it happen so easily?

00:21:51.833 --> 00:21:55.400
But it is such a
whimsical question.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.830
Now I speak through this mike.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.390
If there are any villagers here
and if they have not seen a mike,

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:04.033
they would wonder how this is possible
that you speak there and it comes here.

00:22:04.033 --> 00:22:06.091
If any villager has not seen a light,

00:22:06.115 --> 00:22:07.633
if you call him inside the house

00:22:07.633 --> 00:22:09.973
and ask him to switch off the
light he will just keep on blowing.

00:22:09.973 --> 00:22:12.255
‘It is not blowing out, how to do it.’

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:14.833
Just like when you press the button
here, and it gets blown out there,

00:22:14.857 --> 00:22:17.265
he will be wonderstruck
that how does this happen?

00:22:17.265 --> 00:22:21.500
Press the button there
and it is illuminated here.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:27.833
It is a similar stupid question.
Really very stupid.

00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:33.577
As we know when the
sun rises in the sky,

00:22:33.577 --> 00:22:41.357
then chlorophyll gets developed
in the plants.

00:22:41.357 --> 00:22:44.333
Due to this it gets a green colour.

00:22:44.333 --> 00:22:45.990
Where is the sun?

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:48.200
Thousands of miles away.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.833
The moment it comes in the
sky, this event takes place.

00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:56.521
If I ask you to give a green colour to
the leaves,

00:22:56.545 --> 00:22:58.317
you will not be able to do it.

00:22:58.317 --> 00:22:59.965
Means you can pour it on the outside

00:22:59.989 --> 00:23:03.167
but will not be able to impart colour
completely from inside and outside.

00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:12.300
How colossal the sun must be as
he colours every leaf in the nature.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.000
But we are not at all surprised
nor there any appreciation.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.288
In English this is termed
as ‘taken for granted’

00:23:20.312 --> 00:23:23.467
means this is bound to
happen when the sun comes.

00:23:23.467 --> 00:23:27.250
How do the fruits grow in the
world, overnight how do they happen?

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.930
We do not wait for them.

00:23:28.943 --> 00:23:31.477
How do the trees
grow up, nobody knows.

00:23:31.483 --> 00:23:33.417
There is no measure for this.

00:23:33.423 --> 00:23:36.633
How does the sun
make it happen alone?

00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:40.800
How many types of
powers his rays have.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:51.730
So the sun alone makes
this happen, you see.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:57.903
Similarly if something is happening through me
then something must be present in me too.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.570
At least this much
can be guessed.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:04.186
On the contrary if you keep on saying
how can this happen

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:15.297
then what is this way (manner)? I call this a human way... way of thinking

00:24:15.297 --> 00:24:18.197
because God’s way (method) is different.

00:24:18.197 --> 00:24:20.403
I call this a human way (method).

00:24:20.403 --> 00:24:27.783
It’s like you see from the opposite side
and say how did you hang upside down?

00:24:27.783 --> 00:24:30.333
All of this is humorous.

00:24:30.333 --> 00:24:34.213
You observe everywhere that
how do we ask such questions

00:24:34.213 --> 00:24:36.033
when you can see it happening.

00:24:36.033 --> 00:24:38.933
If you wish to see
Kundalini I will show you.

00:24:38.977 --> 00:24:42.957
Will show its vibrations, its
ascent, will show its rising up

00:24:42.957 --> 00:24:46.670
but still people will
ask you such questions.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:48.350
Then what is to be done?

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:49.663
How to argue with them?

00:24:49.663 --> 00:24:52.700
This is the question
before Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:59.433
‘Shri Mataji, when they ask such questions,
how to answer them?’ Think for a while

00:24:59.433 --> 00:25:02.380
that if they are little crazy,
you can set them right.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:08.367
If they are absolutely crazy
then you should leave them alone.

00:25:08.367 --> 00:25:12.310
You need not stress
yourself for that.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.433
Why to become crazy like them?

00:25:15.433 --> 00:25:23.433
So be wise and say, ‘it’s
ok, let’s see.’ and avoid.

00:25:23.433 --> 00:25:25.195
But it does not happen like that.

00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:28.155
A person feels that since he has got it, it
must happen,

00:25:28.179 --> 00:25:31.421
whichever way it must be done.

00:25:31.445 --> 00:25:33.503
Then we cannot manage it.

00:25:33.503 --> 00:25:38.163
So first understand the simple
alphabets and solve them.

00:25:38.163 --> 00:25:42.077
Pune has a lot of simple people.

00:25:42.077 --> 00:25:43.267
Lot of them.

00:25:43.267 --> 00:25:44.947
Most of them are simple.

00:25:44.983 --> 00:25:49.217
But the difficult ones speak more; the
difficult ones want to be at the forefront.

00:25:49.217 --> 00:25:52.897
The difficult one
would have his own way.

00:25:52.897 --> 00:25:57.333
‘We especially came
here.’ So why did you come?

00:25:57.333 --> 00:26:00.083
Is this important
to mention this?

00:26:00.083 --> 00:26:02.578
‘Mataji we came specially.’

00:26:02.602 --> 00:26:08.555
Actually they came for some
other thing but drifted this way.

00:26:08.579 --> 00:26:14.700
They do come with a purpose, but to
emphasize – ‘we took effort to come.’

00:26:14.724 --> 00:26:20.133
It is not that you took
special effort to come here.

00:26:20.133 --> 00:26:22.867
But still they maintain
that they came specially.

00:26:22.867 --> 00:26:30.033
Hence I want to say that a person’s
intellect is so superficial that there

00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:34.240
needs to be some
way to pull that in.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.067
Now your attention
is towards me.

00:26:37.067 --> 00:26:41.300
Say some one is arguing with
you, he is speaking something.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.700
So how to make him silent?

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.267
His attention which is roaming
outside, how to bring it in?

00:26:48.267 --> 00:26:53.387
If you learn to explore this path then you
could become an excellent Sahaja Yogi.

00:26:53.443 --> 00:26:59.367
If he starts speaking something,
do not pay attention to it.

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:03.767
Give him ‘Bandhan’ by hand or you can give
it through your ‘chitta’ (awareness) and

00:27:03.767 --> 00:27:06.133
immediately focus on Kundalini.

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:09.955
He is speaking on one side and you focus
on Kundalini

00:27:09.979 --> 00:27:12.643
and it starts rising up

00:27:12.643 --> 00:27:14.843
because we have
Kundalini in our gaze itself.

00:27:14.843 --> 00:27:18.388
Once we focus on
the chitta – you are astride the chitta,

00:27:18.412 --> 00:27:21.221
really you are astride the chitta

00:27:21.245 --> 00:27:24.471
You just focus your attention on his
Kundalini,

00:27:24.495 --> 00:27:27.688
don’t pay heed to what he says –

00:27:27.712 --> 00:27:30.188
as Kundalini starts rising

00:27:30.212 --> 00:27:32.083
you can see the chakras clearly.

00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:35.400
Where they are stuck, where it’s
ok – this all comes through practice.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.343
Practise a little. Pay attention to
everyone’s Kundalini and try to raise.

00:27:40.343 --> 00:27:45.603
When you are aboard a bus, or
train, wherever you see people

00:27:45.603 --> 00:27:48.510
first see where the Kundalini is.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.817
Our London has a custom.
To shake hands.

00:27:51.817 --> 00:27:53.567
It is terrible stuff.

00:27:53.567 --> 00:27:58.703
Means till they suck half a litre
of your blood,

00:27:58.703 --> 00:28:01.300
they do not feel
that they have shaken hands.

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.333
This is how they ‘Shake’.
Specially after drinking.

00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:09.291
But before drinking also
they shake hands

00:28:09.315 --> 00:28:12.567
that is when I give them realization.

00:28:12.567 --> 00:28:15.867
When they shake hands,
I give them awakening .

00:28:15.867 --> 00:28:17.547
Then they drink less.

00:28:17.587 --> 00:28:20.067
Slowly their
drinking has reduced.

00:28:20.067 --> 00:28:24.533
And it is in my fate that I have to
shake hands standing with 500 people.

00:28:24.533 --> 00:28:28.367
This happens every
third or fourth day.

00:28:28.367 --> 00:28:32.133
Wherever 500 people are
going and my hand goes as well with them.

00:28:32.133 --> 00:28:34.843
Now this custom has
emerged in a natural way.

00:28:34.843 --> 00:28:40.933
I will not be able to touch their
Kundalini without shaking hands with them.

00:28:40.933 --> 00:28:43.837
For a moment, a
person pauses too.

00:28:43.837 --> 00:28:46.500
It’s over once the
hand shake is done.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.433
So we should focus on his
Kundalini and raise the Kundalini.

00:28:51.433 --> 00:28:53.855
Immediately we will get to
know through practice

00:28:53.879 --> 00:28:55.733
where the Kundalini is stuck.

00:28:55.733 --> 00:28:58.133
Immediately invoke
the deity there.

00:28:58.133 --> 00:29:01.100
There is a science to it.
One must understand it.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.797
Our London has a good
arrangement for these people.

00:29:03.797 --> 00:29:06.918
What is the mantra for each
chakra that has been written down,

00:29:06.942 --> 00:29:12.088
what are their permutations combinations,
what is wrong where and its whereabout,

00:29:12.112 --> 00:29:17.867
all this is extracted and all of it is written
on paper and preserved in a folder by them.

00:29:17.867 --> 00:29:20.000
One folder is with these people.
You can see it.

00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:24.567
Make a folder like that. That is in
English, you get it done in Marathi.

00:29:24.567 --> 00:29:26.433
Learn all that and remember.

00:29:26.463 --> 00:29:32.800
And when we need to do
the task, it happens secretly.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.021
If you think that the person seems alright,

00:29:37.045 --> 00:29:40.167
if he has catch on 1-2 chakras
then these could be resolved.

00:29:40.167 --> 00:29:42.623
However, you should
give him realization.

00:29:42.623 --> 00:29:45.567
Do not speak too much
after giving realization.

00:29:45.583 --> 00:29:49.005
He himself will feel that ‘we will come to
meet you.

00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:51.667
How is everything.., this and that’?

00:29:51.667 --> 00:29:57.323
Move it very slowly because
normally people have inquisitive mind.

00:29:57.323 --> 00:30:01.533
If you suddenly approach
them, they will shy away.

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:05.500
If you want to take away something
from someone, how smoothly we extract it.

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.867
We need to extract it the same
way – Because it is very subtle.

00:30:08.867 --> 00:30:12.963
If you try to tell them something
special, they get apprehensive.

00:30:12.997 --> 00:30:18.217
So Sahaja Yogis should keep in mind
that it is very subtle and delicate work.

00:30:18.217 --> 00:30:21.378
The human is spoiled so much
that it has become very difficult

00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:28.437
to seek his permission
before experimenting on him.

00:30:28.437 --> 00:30:31.303
But you can give him
awareness without his permission.

00:30:31.303 --> 00:30:34.223
He cannot, however, get his
complete self realisation crossover(paar hone).

00:30:34.223 --> 00:30:37.633
For complete self realisation crossover (Paar hone),
we need his consent.

00:30:37.633 --> 00:30:39.910
We cannot have that authority.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:42.765
Due to awakening , he may get good health,

00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:48.042
He will desire to reach to God. He will know God.

00:30:48.042 --> 00:30:51.193
but there is a difference between becoming aware and getting complete self realization(complete union with divine)

00:30:51.193 --> 00:30:56.500
Even if Kundalini gets awakened , until it is fully awakened

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.273
and gets completely
settled it does not stabilize.

00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:01.373
So to get him to this
stage you need their consent.

00:31:01.373 --> 00:31:04.621
But if you have given him realization

00:31:04.645 --> 00:31:07.597
then
it does not take time to reach this stage.

00:31:07.597 --> 00:31:12.967
And after they reach this stage, they
can be made to get self realization.

00:31:12.967 --> 00:31:18.400
Still it must be understood
that this is a very slow process.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:26.533
So you first consider such people who
have faith in you and who respect you.

00:31:26.533 --> 00:31:30.707
Because even otherwise this is the thing
that one should give to this world, nothing else.

00:31:30.707 --> 00:31:34.867
What is the use if you call
someone for meals at your place?

00:31:34.897 --> 00:31:39.800
I have seen such people who have done so
much for this world

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:45.567
they felt that they have done this work
or that work for the welfare of people;

00:31:45.567 --> 00:31:47.643
we have given so much
money to the people.

00:31:47.643 --> 00:31:53.000
Have done so much good for them
but people do not remember anything.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.888
If they again come in abject poverty to us,
we will not entertain them at the doorstep.

00:31:58.912 --> 00:32:00.650
This is the mindset of people.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.567
Over here, so many people have
made sacrifices for the country.

00:32:03.567 --> 00:32:07.833
You know how great
Lal Bahadur Shastri was.

00:32:07.833 --> 00:32:13.233
Have you seen any
monument in his name?

00:32:13.233 --> 00:32:17.170
Can you see it
anywhere in his name?

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.370
And there is no
controversy about this.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.351
People have written books about others;

00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:25.863
people informed that their
characters were not good.

00:32:25.863 --> 00:32:28.757
But nobody can say
such things about him (Shastriji).

00:32:28.757 --> 00:32:31.331
He has accomplished so
much in such a little time

00:32:31.355 --> 00:32:37.400
but have you seen any
monument in his name.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:43.177
Sometime ago, when I saw his portrait I
was surprised that how come it was there.

00:32:43.177 --> 00:32:50.867
People may have doubt whether he
was actually a prime minister or not.

00:32:50.867 --> 00:32:52.547
So such things happen.

00:32:52.573 --> 00:32:55.200
What could be the reason?
It needs the association of the atma (Spirit).

00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:00.611
As Awakening happens from inside,

00:33:00.635 --> 00:33:04.067
it
becomes like a soul from within

00:33:04.067 --> 00:33:07.250
and that is
why it is remembered.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.133
Gradually this may fade off.

00:33:10.133 --> 00:33:12.900
But still we keep it alive.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:17.057
Now we should focus on the ten people
whom we want to give self realization.

00:33:17.057 --> 00:33:19.400
Note their names
once you come home.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.850
Should confirm
that these look good.

00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:24.200
They should be religious,
should not try on very difficult people.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:30.033
Means drunkards, even they can
get it but today this is not the time.

00:33:30.033 --> 00:33:37.367
Such people, who are religious, balanced,
are positive, who are spiritually oriented

00:33:37.367 --> 00:33:42.121
and who are on this path

00:33:42.145 --> 00:33:48.167
should focus on such 8-10 people
and take effort on them.

00:33:48.167 --> 00:33:50.051
You will be surprised

00:33:50.075 --> 00:33:53.933
that if you take 10 persons
at least 8 will get connected to Divine.

00:33:53.933 --> 00:33:56.767
If each person facilitates self
realization for even 10 persons,

00:33:56.767 --> 00:33:58.993
you can understand how many
will get their self realization.

00:33:58.993 --> 00:34:02.900
Then you should continuously
look after them and nurture them.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.257
What is their status, how are they,
are they catching, why are they catching negativity

00:34:06.257 --> 00:34:09.443
Once you become self realized, you understand negativity, not before that.

00:34:09.443 --> 00:34:15.333
Even if a person gets mad, he
would not realize that he is affected by negativity.

00:34:15.333 --> 00:34:19.480
Even if he dies after getting
mad, still he would not understand.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.167
But Sahaja Yogis immediately
understands that his agnya is affected.

00:34:23.167 --> 00:34:28.033
Catching agnya means
something has stuck to you.

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:30.100
You start suffering.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:33.300
Then immediately the hands start
moving, to remove the agnya affliction.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.077
Because you start
suffering automatically.

00:34:36.077 --> 00:34:39.051
The reason for this is that
when you become superhuman

00:34:39.075 --> 00:34:42.033
this is an important
point, just note it down ,

00:34:42.033 --> 00:34:46.565
it is important point as – when
you became human,

00:34:46.589 --> 00:34:49.930
there are a lot of differences
between you and the animal.

00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:54.218
The significant difference is that if
you move the animal in the filth,

00:34:54.242 --> 00:34:57.617
it will not feel any different,
It can tolerate anything.

00:34:57.617 --> 00:35:00.710
But if you do such thing to a
human, he will not want that.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:05.123
He needs slippers and  even if
he is wearing slippers, he feels dirty.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.867
Would like to bathe.

00:35:06.867 --> 00:35:10.467
The human understands
the concept of cleanliness.

00:35:10.467 --> 00:35:14.327
Similarly a human understands
the cleanliness of atma(Spirit).

00:35:14.327 --> 00:35:17.325
And after getting affected ‘I don’t want this catch,

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:20.000
I need Sahaja Yoga. Remove this catch.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.463
And he suffers even if he gets
affected slightly. And then the person removes it.

00:35:28.463 --> 00:35:33.890
That suffering is not so clearly
evident, you get an indication only.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.000
Just like a barometer
gives an indication.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.263
That this person has
got a catch at this place.

00:35:39.263 --> 00:35:43.300
Once you remove it, he is
relieved as well as yourself.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.433
See how interesting it is.

00:35:46.433 --> 00:35:49.243
These people purchased kumkum
(red powder) from the market.

00:35:49.243 --> 00:35:52.267
I did not know what
kumkum this was.

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:55.350
It started burning the moment
I applied it on my forehead.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.470
I asked them to first remove it.

00:35:57.503 --> 00:36:02.223
It did not strike me as it was very crowded, I did
not realize first when I was asked to touch it.

00:36:02.223 --> 00:36:04.567
Again my attention got attracted there.

00:36:04.567 --> 00:36:07.333
Then I took the
kumkum and vibrated it.

00:36:07.333 --> 00:36:15.070
I told Mr. Rajwade that ‘get the
Kumkum from your place, it is good.

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:20.150
The one you got last year was
good.’ Such minute things are noticed.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.017
So everything gets vibrated.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:26.867
Vibration means Omkar only.

00:36:26.867 --> 00:36:29.287
This is the Pranav (the
total form) of Omkar.

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:34.267
Pranav means pulsation,
the total holiness.

00:36:34.267 --> 00:36:40.470
This holiness is love that communicates,
we become aware of everything.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:46.763
As we get connected to the computer and the
computer tells, similarly this computer,

00:36:46.763 --> 00:36:49.767
created by the Almighty,
tells us every minute detail.

00:36:49.767 --> 00:36:52.990
We must understand from it.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:57.000
In the third stage, some
people become very religious.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.833
Now the gentleman from
yesterday revers Lord Mahadeva.

00:37:00.833 --> 00:37:02.237
And he has a catch on heart.

00:37:02.237 --> 00:37:04.267
How is this possible?

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:09.163
Heart is the location of Mahadeva
and Mahadeva is upset with him.

00:37:09.163 --> 00:37:10.363
How can this happen?

00:37:10.363 --> 00:37:14.833
People ask “ Mataji, we so ardently worshipped Lord
Mahadeva , then how did we suffer from a heart attack?”.

00:37:14.833 --> 00:37:17.300
People say this does not fit.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.023
It’s not wrong, but
there was no connection.

00:37:20.023 --> 00:37:25.570
Now how can such a person, who has
worshipped Mahadeva

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:31.133
ask Mataji “Shri Mataji, are you
the power of Lord Mahadeva?”

00:37:31.133 --> 00:37:33.553
So as a response, you will get
vibrations on your hand.

00:37:33.553 --> 00:37:35.587
Because it is true.

00:37:35.587 --> 00:37:39.619
If you ask me a question, I
would say yes, it is like that only.

00:37:39.653 --> 00:37:42.300
What to do now?
I am what I am.

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:46.500
How can I relinquish what I am?

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.233
If someone is some special
being, does he feel proud about it?

00:37:51.233 --> 00:37:53.857
That person feels proud
who does not have it.

00:37:53.857 --> 00:37:55.883
If someone has it, what is
there to feel proud about?

00:37:55.883 --> 00:38:00.567
Now you have fingers, nose, you
are humans – are you proud of it?

00:38:00.567 --> 00:38:02.767
My case is something similar.

00:38:02.767 --> 00:38:07.833
Means whatever I have is there.
What can I do about it?

00:38:07.833 --> 00:38:16.637
Now Mr. Pradhan is our old
trustee, but he got affected.

00:38:16.637 --> 00:38:21.167
I told him yesterday not to go
on fast on Mahashivaratri day.

00:38:21.167 --> 00:38:25.303
While he did ask me, he went on fast.
One should not keep fast in front of me.

00:38:25.303 --> 00:38:28.830
I feel very sad. You trouble
your mother when you fast.

00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.423
We should fast only on
Narak Chaturdashi day.

00:38:31.423 --> 00:38:34.830
Means sleep for a long
time, do not take bath.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.000
That’s the day when
the door to hell opens.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.672
If on that day you get up at 4 o’clock
and eat, the demons barge in.

00:38:41.727 --> 00:38:46.913
Few things are so wrongly  established ,
so wrongly , that it is verysurprising.

00:38:46.913 --> 00:38:49.457
Now another case,
regarding Ganapati.

00:38:49.457 --> 00:38:54.197
This person had issue with his prostrate
and he used to fast on Ganesh Chaturthi day.

00:38:54.197 --> 00:38:57.343
He visited me on Chaturthi
and he had prostrate trouble.

00:38:57.368 --> 00:39:01.643
I could not understand why this person, a
Ganapati personified, had prostrate issue.

00:39:01.643 --> 00:39:04.600
Because Ganapati
controls prostrate etc..

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:10.067
See how Sahaja Yoga is? The day of Chaturthi, same
day he did fast and came to me on the same day.

00:39:10.067 --> 00:39:12.590
The whole situation
was in the fore.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:14.723
This is the sign of Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:14.743 --> 00:39:19.927
My Prasad is that of Chana (kind of pulse),
I took some and said take this Prasad.

00:39:19.943 --> 00:39:23.157
He would not say anything. But the person standing
next to him said, ‘Mataji, today he is on fast’.

00:39:23.157 --> 00:39:25.555
I said, ‘What is the fast for?’

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:27.983
He said ‘It’s Chaturthi today.’
I said ‘Is that so?

00:39:27.983 --> 00:39:31.790
If a son is born in your
house, will you fast on that day?

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:35.178
What sort of wisdom is this?’

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:41.033
To fast on the day of someone’s birth is
a concept I could never understand till date.

00:39:41.033 --> 00:39:46.567
If a child is born in your house,
will you follow a period of abstention?

00:39:46.567 --> 00:39:51.717
That is why it has been mentioned
that one should not keep fasts.

00:39:51.717 --> 00:39:56.331
Because the principle of fasting is
so faulty, it has gone so wrong;

00:39:56.355 --> 00:40:02.000
I don’t understand
what to tell these people.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.833
I am not saying you
should just keep on eating.

00:40:05.833 --> 00:40:10.423
The people who fast are obsessed with
eating, I am troubled so much with this.

00:40:10.423 --> 00:40:19.900
They fast for namesake but
their entire attention is on eating.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.103
Means 'What is menu today?’ is
their first question in the morning even

00:40:24.103 --> 00:40:28.533
before they bow to Ganapati.

00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:30.967
The reason is that
we are fasting today.

00:40:30.967 --> 00:40:33.933
They need to create great
commotion in the house.

00:40:33.933 --> 00:40:39.413
To fast means there has to be some
special menu. Bring this, must eat this.

00:40:39.413 --> 00:40:44.970
It should happen this way, must eat
these things. Means, what is all this?

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:49.133
If fasting is suggested by somebody, I
don’t know if it was indeed prescribed

00:40:49.145 --> 00:41:02.100
it was suggested only for the reason that you
should be in the proximity of the Almighty.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.833
There should be no
emphasis on eating.

00:41:05.833 --> 00:41:11.007
If you start emphasizing on eating
then your proximity with the Almighty..

00:41:11.007 --> 00:41:12.888
Now we have to go for meals ,

00:41:12.912 --> 00:41:16.533
have to go there, now this
is our program, etc…

00:41:16.533 --> 00:41:17.927
these thoughts will come in your mind.

00:41:17.927 --> 00:41:22.450
So to fast on that day means ‘To be
completely in the proximity of the Divine.’

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:25.103
Actually this fasting.

00:41:25.103 --> 00:41:29.097
‘Upavas’(fasting) means having
close companionship of the Almighty’ .

00:41:29.097 --> 00:41:33.133
This is the real meaning
as given in Sanskrit.

00:41:33.133 --> 00:41:42.100
And they wrongly understood
that one should fast.

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.700
But there is another
interesting word ‘Upasana ‘.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:54.800
To perform upasana (to worship)
means ‘upas-na’ (fast-no) .

00:41:54.800 --> 00:42:00.233
So this fasting should be
avoided to some extent.

00:42:00.233 --> 00:42:04.307
But the dialogue continues – Today it
is Ekadashi, so what should be brought?

00:42:04.307 --> 00:42:10.937
Then it needs this thing, needs grated
fried potato, want this, need khichadi(made of sago),

00:42:10.937 --> 00:42:14.763
need peanuts,
need shingade (chestnut).

00:42:14.763 --> 00:42:19.000
Now Shingades have become costly
today. Why, because it is Ekadashi.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:27.691
The essence of human is so
important, so great, so superior,

00:42:27.715 --> 00:42:32.400
made with such great effort and
where is it going, where are you taking it?

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:40.900
The attention is to be placed at the Almighty’s
feet and you are placing it on the peanuts.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:45.030
Are you going to get connected
with God by eating peanuts?

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:50.067
I don’t understand how this is
acceptable to the human intellect.

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:53.678
This religious fanaticism has
given such adverse results

00:42:53.702 --> 00:42:57.363
that it has
given rise to another extreme.

00:42:57.363 --> 00:43:00.417
Your kids will term
you as mental cases.

00:43:00.417 --> 00:43:05.367
In the second generation you will see kid saying
‘our parents are completely off their rockers (mad).

00:43:05.367 --> 00:43:08.833
The Brahmins have fleeced
them and the fasts have killed them.

00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:13.143
They did this.’ Nobody
will have faith in God.

00:43:13.143 --> 00:43:15.690
If you escape this then you
may become an unbeliever.

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:17.933
God is there.

00:43:17.933 --> 00:43:21.965
Not only that, his all encompassing
power is doing all the work.

00:43:21.977 --> 00:43:24.100
No doubt about it.

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:26.465
One must understand it,

00:43:26.489 --> 00:43:28.888
one mustbe come aware of it,
like I said yesterday,

00:43:28.912 --> 00:43:33.257
and we enhance our contemplation
with the help of Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:33.257 --> 00:43:34.923
Now what he says is right.

00:43:34.923 --> 00:43:40.700
We have quite a few such people who did not know
the ABC of giving a speech. Just timid people.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.603
If they do speak, actually Goddess
Saraswati flows through them.

00:43:44.603 --> 00:43:46.125
There was an eight
year old girl.

00:43:46.149 --> 00:43:49.200
She started speaking so well.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.867
In London there is a
boy aged 8-10 years.

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.600
He delivers such a beautiful discourse
on Sahaja Yoga, people get surprised.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:01.233
How can one know so much?

00:44:01.233 --> 00:44:06.500
I can tell about my granddaughter.
She must be around 5 years that time.

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:07.810
They had gone to Ladakh.

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:09.633
There was a Lama
person sitting there.

00:44:09.633 --> 00:44:14.270
He was decked in his grand attire and
my granddaughters were speaking in Hindi.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:18.090
So everyone paid respects
by bowing at his feet.

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.518
The moment her parents bowed
down, she did not appreciate it

00:44:20.542 --> 00:44:23.970
as she herself was a
great Sahaja Yogi.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.933
So she stood in front of him

00:44:25.933 --> 00:44:29.867
and said, “Wearing this long gown and shaving
your head does not let you become a realized soul,

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:33.533
So why do you accept obeisance from
others when you are not connected to God.”

00:44:33.533 --> 00:44:37.400
She said frankly, just like Kabir.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.700
Kabir has thrashed
such matters so badly.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:47.600
One must read
Kabir to get strength.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:55.400
He says that if by shaving your
head you meet the Divine,

00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:07.033
then the goat and sheep get shaved
every day, these must be close to God.

00:45:07.033 --> 00:45:11.100
He has thus reprimanded all such people,

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:14.555
the people who wear long gowns

00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:16.833
and call themselves Sanyasis (hermits, saints).

00:45:16.833 --> 00:45:21.933
Another granddaughter of mine,
she is slightly elder to this girl.

00:45:21.933 --> 00:45:26.650
Once I was invited as a chief guest
to a program of Raman Maharshi.

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:33.200
There were quite a few well
known Sanyasis sitting there.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.000
There was this gentleman
sitting next to me.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.367
He is considered to be a
very accomplished person.

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:47.000
My granddaughter saw
this and could not tolerate.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.717
She stood up and said

00:45:50.717 --> 00:45:52.800
” Granny, the person who
is wearing a maxi and sitting next to you,

00:45:52.812 --> 00:45:55.367
drive him away as
I am getting lot of heat.”

00:45:55.367 --> 00:45:57.500
And she straightway got up and said this.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.463
And there were lot of
Sahaja Yogis sitting there.

00:45:59.463 --> 00:46:00.937
They started laughing as
they were also feeling the heat.

00:46:00.937 --> 00:46:03.433
The person looked around
to see who is wearing a maxi.

00:46:03.433 --> 00:46:06.900
He did not realize
that he was the object.

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:11.721
So such power emanates from within that
a person starts speaking only the truth,

00:46:11.745 --> 00:46:13.500
does not feel afraid.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.333
As he is standing on truth.

00:46:15.333 --> 00:46:17.400
Now look at the life of Christ.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.267
How pure it is!

00:46:19.267 --> 00:46:22.010
But a prostitute, people
are throwing stones at her.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:27.430
What is His relation to the
prostitute, He was Divinity personified.

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:33.867
But when people started throwing stones at
a woman, considering her as an evil person,

00:46:33.867 --> 00:46:40.431
a prostitute, he said that who so ever has
not committed any sin should cast the stone

00:46:40.455 --> 00:46:41.933
and that too at me.

00:46:41.933 --> 00:46:46.567
And everybody stopped
where they were.

00:46:46.567 --> 00:46:50.663
‘If you think that you have not committed
any sin, you hurt her.’ Later on she became

00:46:50.663 --> 00:46:54.500
his great disciple.

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:58.830
She was Mary Magdalene,
His great devotee.

00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.103
But these people have
started emulating her.

00:47:01.103 --> 00:47:04.123
I do not understand
the human brain.

00:47:04.123 --> 00:47:07.800
The English brain
is a notch superior.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:11.833
I asked them why people
behave in such a stupid manner.

00:47:11.833 --> 00:47:15.688
They responded, Mary
Magdalene was a prostitute

00:47:15.712 --> 00:47:21.700
and she got liberated hence we all became prostitutes.”
They tell me like this, what should I say?

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:32.250
“If she would not have become a prostitute,
she would not have been liberated.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:34.718
Hence we are also following the same path.”

00:47:34.742 --> 00:47:39.300
Now what should be the response to this?

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:42.533
That we are standing
behind a donkey.

00:47:42.533 --> 00:47:47.333
We know it is a donkey.

00:47:47.333 --> 00:47:50.797
There are a lot of such
idiotic things over there.

00:47:50.797 --> 00:47:55.723
Even after being so educated and
considering themselves as advanced people,

00:47:55.723 --> 00:48:00.300
I see only such donkeys.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.900
Now I have no hesitation to tell you

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.978
that an eighty year old person

00:48:05.002 --> 00:48:08.600
writes a love letter to an eighteen year old girl.

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.861
There may be one such idiot writing this,

00:48:11.885 --> 00:48:15.967
but it is flashed on the
front page of the news paper.

00:48:15.967 --> 00:48:18.033
Columns after column everyday.

00:48:18.033 --> 00:48:22.641
My husband used to say, read this
“geeta” after waking up in the morning.

00:48:22.677 --> 00:48:27.067
And the people diligently
read this seriously.

00:48:27.067 --> 00:48:30.233
Means all of them
must be stupid people.

00:48:30.233 --> 00:48:33.333
I don’t understand how
they read such stuff?

00:48:33.333 --> 00:48:36.400
And this is very
common out there.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:41.167
An eighty year old woman writes a
love letter to a eighteen year old boy.

00:48:41.167 --> 00:48:43.600
Have you heard
such thing anywhere?

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:47.583
Means what is this matter?

00:48:47.583 --> 00:48:52.033
We have seen donkeys but even
a donkey would feel ashamed.

00:48:52.033 --> 00:48:55.233
Why to say donkey.
Donkey is quite a good animal.

00:48:55.233 --> 00:48:58.767
Sometimes I feel, that
Christ rode over a donkey,

00:48:58.767 --> 00:49:02.627
don’t know if these people
were those donkeys?

00:49:02.627 --> 00:49:04.893
Such filthy matters.

00:49:04.893 --> 00:49:09.583
These people who have come here
are not as difficult as we see there.

00:49:09.583 --> 00:49:12.465
Eighty years old people,

00:49:12.489 --> 00:49:16.900
who do not have a common sense,
no concept of elderliness,

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:22.933
what we call as maturity is also
not there, means what is this?

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:28.900
What sort of
advancement is this?

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:34.431
Some of the questions that
Sahajayogis are facing

00:49:34.455 --> 00:49:36.700
that I have told you just now.

00:49:36.727 --> 00:49:38.860
Also some questions related to science are faced by them.

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:42.807
Because people over here have started thinking
that “we have become scientific etc…”.

00:49:42.807 --> 00:49:46.677
People who have become very scientific
have also come here along with us.

00:49:46.677 --> 00:49:50.178
It is my wish that, of those,
we should converse with a few of them

00:49:50.202 --> 00:49:51.223
and they should speak with us.

00:49:51.223 --> 00:49:53.491
You meet them, talk with them

00:49:53.515 --> 00:49:56.577
or if you have any
questions just ask me ,

00:49:56.577 --> 00:49:58.470
I will answer them,
then you talk to them.

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.997
This way you will get an idea

00:50:00.997 --> 00:50:03.637
as to where that thing
called science has reached.

00:50:03.637 --> 00:50:09.000
Has Gavin left?

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:26.083
So now you could
ask me questions.

00:50:26.108 --> 00:50:29.600
You could ask me any questions.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:39.503
Ask those questions related to the
obstacles you face in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:50.367
Sahaja Yogis should
pose questions.

00:50:50.367 --> 00:50:54.033
So that I can understand, what you
problems are? What are your obstacles?

00:50:54.033 --> 00:50:57.937
Or if the question is how to
explain people, you could ask me.

00:50:57.997 --> 00:51:00.577
Regarding Kundalini
or about anything.

00:51:00.577 --> 00:51:04.865
Now this person has asked about
”Jalandhar Yoga etc…” Listen to that.

00:51:04.923 --> 00:51:08.688
There is some confusion in this;

00:51:08.712 --> 00:51:13.467
you will be surprised if I tell you.

00:51:13.467 --> 00:51:34.480
The Jalandhar Bandha is part
of the chakra and it means a knot.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:42.333
This knot completely opens up and then it
secures Kundalini tightly – this is the meaning.

00:51:42.333 --> 00:51:45.733
This deals with Nabhi Chakra.

00:51:45.773 --> 00:51:48.955
When Kundalini starts rising up suppose

00:51:48.979 --> 00:51:55.510
when anything starts climbing up, it is
a difficult task, isn’t it?

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:58.688
Going downwards is easy,
going up is difficult

00:51:58.712 --> 00:52:12.170
To raise the Kundalini up and to carry her away ,
the knot or tightness is formed by the chakras.

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.243
The chakra tightens itself.

00:52:15.243 --> 00:52:18.600
So that the Kundalini that has
risen up should not slip down

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.023
Jalandhar Yoga is for this purpose.

00:52:21.023 --> 00:52:23.867
‘Khecheri’ is also
a similar concept.

00:52:23.867 --> 00:52:30.263
Having arrived at the Vishuddhi chakra,
when the Kundalini starts rising further,

00:52:30.263 --> 00:52:32.545
that time Vishuddhi Chakra holds her

00:52:32.569 --> 00:52:35.411
and sustains her so that
she should not slip down.

00:52:35.435 --> 00:52:37.365
That’s real khechari.

00:52:37.389 --> 00:52:44.577
It happens. That time
the tongue will get pulled inside for sure.

00:52:44.577 --> 00:52:52.833
As the complete awareness
has gone inwards, it forms a knot.

00:52:52.833 --> 00:52:57.533
You don’t realize this.

00:52:57.533 --> 00:53:05.517
As it is very ‘sukshma’ (subtle, minute),
you do not realize what all has happened inside.

00:53:05.517 --> 00:53:08.845
Only your awareness
rushes towards Kundalini.

00:53:08.857 --> 00:53:11.157
Because you attention
gets pulled inside.

00:53:11.157 --> 00:53:12.885
This is a very subtle event.

00:53:12.909 --> 00:53:15.433
Your awareness also becomes subtle.

00:53:15.433 --> 00:53:19.633
So these events happen
inside us that time.

00:53:19.673 --> 00:53:22.055
Suppose this electricity starts from here

00:53:22.079 --> 00:53:24.767
and then how does it roam inside and

00:53:24.767 --> 00:53:27.300
become a loud speaker.

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.980
It is similar to this.

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:31.910
Means this is a subtle
event happening inside.

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:35.700
This all happens inside us.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.081
What is written here has a meaning.

00:53:38.105 --> 00:53:40.900
This is written by Shri Dnyaneshwar (a great saint).

00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:45.238
But what people interprete,
that if we sit like this,

00:53:45.262 --> 00:53:49.223
it creates Jalandhar Bandha
is incorrect.

00:53:49.223 --> 00:53:51.090
You cannot do it.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:53.133
It just happens.

00:53:53.133 --> 00:53:55.200
See the vast difference here.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.257
It is natural, happens inside.

00:53:58.257 --> 00:54:02.000
Now if I hold the hand like this,
will it become a microphone?

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.433
If you say ‘I became the
governor’, will you become one?

00:54:06.433 --> 00:54:07.603
Does it happen like this?

00:54:07.603 --> 00:54:08.657
Will anyone believe it?

00:54:08.657 --> 00:54:11.457
At the most they will
put you in an asylum.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:15.038
A person yells ‘I am the governor’

00:54:15.062 --> 00:54:19.067
or even ride car while doing this

00:54:19.067 --> 00:54:21.900
People will say ‘put all
of them in the asylum.’

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:30.567
The authorities that are tied to these things

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:37.423
which are subtle and these authorities are
subtle and they exercise these themselves.

00:54:37.423 --> 00:54:41.067
This cannot be done by you.
That is why it is called Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:41.067 --> 00:54:44.467
Sahaja Yoga is the very best.

00:54:44.467 --> 00:54:46.957
It is the most superior and hence
it is a ‘Maha Yoga’ ( ‘ Great Yoga’).

00:54:46.957 --> 00:54:48.450
Sahaja Yoga means everything.

00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:50.667
Nothing is unnatural in this.

00:54:50.667 --> 00:54:57.333
If you banish the thought that you are
doing something then it makes sense.

00:54:57.333 --> 00:55:00.200
You only put on the switch.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:01.530
Rest all happens by itself.

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:06.423
It is inbuilt in the electricity
that it has to flow this way.

00:55:06.423 --> 00:55:09.400
Once it is connected,
there has to be light.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.867
If it goes through such
circle, it has to become a mike.

00:55:12.867 --> 00:55:15.733
If it goes through that
circle, it has to become a fan.

00:55:15.733 --> 00:55:18.657
This is the principle
of electricity.

00:55:18.657 --> 00:55:22.617
Similarly Kundalini & the Sushumna Nadi
within you and its mechanism etc..

00:55:22.617 --> 00:55:28.923
situated in you, has its
own associated principle.

00:55:28.923 --> 00:55:36.643
And when Shri Dnyaneshwar explained how
this principle functions “that we can do.”

00:55:36.643 --> 00:55:41.670
If you say that we can light a lamp by touching
here, then the lights will certainly get on.

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:45.321
They should try this and if once
the light gets on then

00:55:45.345 --> 00:55:48.323
they can write in a book what
how painful the quest of Kundalini is.

00:55:48.323 --> 00:55:52.400
Means people will
feel how cool it is.

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:57.030
If these people have suffered so
much, how much it should be for us.

00:55:57.055 --> 00:56:02.800
Now this gentleman, Krishnamurti he has written
that,” My Kundalini is awakened”.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.033
Means a self certification.

00:56:05.033 --> 00:56:09.667
“and because of that I felt
as if a scorpion has bit me.

00:56:09.667 --> 00:56:11.600
I suffered a lot.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.600
I had blisters on my body.

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.167
Felt very hot from inside,
my head started spinning.

00:56:18.167 --> 00:56:20.867
My condition deteriorated.

00:56:20.867 --> 00:56:22.310
Then I asked people.

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:25.488
They said your Kundalini is
awakened.”

00:56:25.513 --> 00:56:27.063
Must have visited some guru.

00:56:27.063 --> 00:56:29.121
Must have tried some silly things

00:56:29.145 --> 00:56:31.355
and due to unauthorized gesture

00:56:31.379 --> 00:56:35.433
he got the whiplash from Shri
Ganesha. He felt it on the sympathetic.

00:56:35.433 --> 00:56:37.767
So people like such
books very much.

00:56:37.783 --> 00:56:41.239
Means a person is troubling
oneself with all his might.

00:56:41.233 --> 00:56:46.033
If you have suffered so
much why do you pursue it?

00:56:46.033 --> 00:56:49.988
Yesterday I told you that
Kundalini is your Mother

00:56:50.012 --> 00:56:54.197
and how lovingly a
mother looks after her kids.

00:56:54.197 --> 00:56:56.078
Just think why will she
trouble you?

00:56:56.102 --> 00:56:57.600
Just think about it.

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.588
So a person who has read such material

00:57:00.612 --> 00:57:04.233
would think that he is not awakened.

00:57:04.233 --> 00:57:07.167
Because according to
that he should jump like frog

00:57:07.167 --> 00:57:10.000
or he should at least
be bitten by a scorpion

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:13.355
or he should feel the s
mell of bedbugs

00:57:13.379 --> 00:57:16.230
these are some matters
given in the material.

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:17.910
But one thing is true.

00:57:17.943 --> 00:57:22.487
When the Kundalini awakens, then
we have some other experiences as well.

00:57:22.503 --> 00:57:24.303
But these experiences
should not be taken seriously.

00:57:24.303 --> 00:57:31.067
Because if the Kundalini gets pushed
more to the right side, you will see light.

00:57:31.067 --> 00:57:33.133
Don’t consider this as special.

00:57:33.157 --> 00:57:36.805
If you are right at the centre,
you will not see anything.

00:57:36.833 --> 00:57:40.733
It is followed by fragrance.

00:57:40.733 --> 00:57:44.189
Because earth is your mother,
her essence is fragrance.

00:57:44.217 --> 00:57:46.670
The earth is made
up of fragrance.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:48.485
And as she is the mother,

00:57:48.509 --> 00:57:53.167
whenever you remember me,
you will experience fragrance.

00:57:53.167 --> 00:57:57.500
Fragrance is the
expression of my body.

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.508
People experience
different types of fragrances.

00:58:00.553 --> 00:58:07.533
Some say “Shri Mataji yesterday we experienced the
copious fragrance of Guggul ( deva-dhoop) in the room”.

00:58:07.533 --> 00:58:10.600
Actually this person is
moving around like a God man.

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.490
He cannot tolerate
any fragrance.

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:14.790
God loves fragrance.

00:58:14.790 --> 00:58:17.733
What sort of God man is this?

00:58:17.733 --> 00:58:20.067
He is dirt loving.

00:58:20.067 --> 00:58:23.333
How can he be the
incarnation of God?

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:27.717
So if a person experiences

00:58:27.717 --> 00:58:31.450
fragrance, a person should go
beyond the fragrance itself.

00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:34.403
A person may get
carried away by this.

00:58:34.403 --> 00:58:36.083
May see light as well.

00:58:36.103 --> 00:58:37.203
Everything is there.

00:58:37.203 --> 00:58:42.121
But when you start seeing light,

00:58:42.145 --> 00:58:45.065
there is no doubt that
the agnya chakra has been opened.

00:58:45.089 --> 00:58:48.463
You will also see
black spots in that light.

00:58:48.463 --> 00:58:50.157
Those are catches.

00:58:50.157 --> 00:58:53.613
They may be in you, someone
else, or in the atmosphere.

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:55.197
How to remove them?

00:58:55.197 --> 00:59:01.023
etc etc. the observation of the light
first get the Kundalini stabilized

00:59:01.023 --> 00:59:07.967
what I mean to say is first reach Delhi
and after reaching know what Delhi is- .

00:59:07.967 --> 00:59:10.897
So you understand it later, the types of
lights, what happens due to this flame,

00:59:10.897 --> 00:59:16.900
all minute details – till
you see the vibrations,

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:22.700
see their circles, their movement-
these you should see afterwards.

00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:25.773
If you see a little of this in the
beginning and if you get engrossed in that,

00:59:25.773 --> 00:59:27.453
then you have lost it.

00:59:27.507 --> 00:59:32.167
Means this mind is like a
horse, you should get astride it.

00:59:32.167 --> 00:59:37.133
If the horse knows that you wish to eat the
grass on the way, then it takes you to the grass.

00:59:37.133 --> 00:59:40.400
But if he understands that
you wish to reach your goal, then

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.327
it will be fully in your control.

00:59:43.327 --> 00:59:49.333
But it should know that this person is a
horse rider.He knows how to ride.

00:59:49.333 --> 00:59:55.533
But if the horse comes to know that
you cannot ride a horse then it starts bothering you.

00:59:55.533 --> 01:00:01.000
You must be able to sit on that horse so
that he becomes your friend, your carrier.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.998
So imagining your Chitta to be a horse,

01:00:04.022 --> 01:00:07.329
you should continuously tell it tersely that
he needs to take you to your final goal,

01:00:07.329 --> 01:00:10.567
will not accept you taking
me anywhere else.

01:00:10.567 --> 01:00:15.133
Then he will take you to the
ultimate pride of place that is moksha.

01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:23.053
Now you can ask questions regarding obstacles that you will be facing.

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:28.800
I earlier asked them but no questions were raised.
If you have any can ask.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:35.833
Ask ask ... come little ahead and ask..

01:00:51.727 --> 01:00:54.267
No problem with it.

01:00:54.300 --> 01:01:02.467
Bluish light means our heart chakra has blue colour.

01:01:02.497 --> 01:01:08.767
In this if you can see little like smoke
then its Vishuddhi chakra.

01:01:08.768 --> 01:01:08.767
(Inaudible portion)

01:01:08.791 --> 01:01:10.791
Its good no problem with that

01:01:10.815 --> 01:01:16.400
and that flame that is there
is flame of Spirit(Atma)

01:01:16.424 --> 01:01:19.433
Can see that is also good
but I am saying that you just become the Spirit.

01:01:19.457 --> 01:01:24.200
Beyond that if you just become the Spirit
then you won't be able to see flame of Spirit.

01:01:24.224 --> 01:01:25.551
Intially you can see it

01:01:25.564 --> 01:01:29.600
As like when we were coming inside
we saw home of Mr. Rajawade

01:01:29.624 --> 01:01:34.333
now I have already came inside.
Can I see home now from inside?

01:01:34.357 --> 01:01:38.017
Sahajyogi: I cannot see anything Mataji.

01:01:38.017 --> 01:01:40.757
That's why yours is good. Your Agya chakra is good.

01:01:40.757 --> 01:01:43.610
Now he has came inside you will say he cannot see anything.

01:01:43.634 --> 01:01:45.634
Whatever way we are should be seen.

01:01:45.654 --> 01:01:52.350
Many peoples have that we are sitting
in vaikuntha and this and that

01:01:52.374 --> 01:01:54.433
that too in Columbia

01:01:54.457 --> 01:01:57.633
In Columbia one women saw Vaikuntha

01:01:57.657 --> 01:01:59.921
And she got completely
surrender and all that

01:01:59.945 --> 01:02:03.857
but I said now
forget all this whatever has happened

01:02:03.881 --> 01:02:06.455
And if you can see light and all that;

01:02:06.479 --> 01:02:11.433
if you see me in five elements
that is from right side

01:02:11.433 --> 01:02:13.097
or you may see from left side....

01:02:13.097 --> 01:02:16.390
But leaving this all behind you come (in center)
because now you should sit on stage

01:02:16.414 --> 01:02:20.863
Stage is ready for you.

01:02:20.887 --> 01:02:23.298
There is one thing about it.

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:25.145
I will tell something about Nirvana.

01:02:25.169 --> 01:02:27.333
Because if you can understand s
one thing about it will be better.

01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:29.721
They also discuss about Nirvana.

01:02:29.745 --> 01:02:32.100
They say that Mataji
we want mukti(liberation).

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:37.167
Means they feel that we don't want any work and we don't want take birth again etc. etc... ideas they have.

01:02:37.167 --> 01:02:42.667
We should get such state that now
we have got Nirvana Moksha (Liberation)

01:02:42.691 --> 01:02:48.467
Now I will tell different kinds of
concepts of Moksha that are there

01:02:48.491 --> 01:02:54.267
Like initially God .... suppose one person
want to open an office..

01:02:54.291 --> 01:02:59.833
In that he wants to manage different peoples.

01:02:59.857 --> 01:03:04.951
See now Mr. Rajwade sir want to
establish this event hall,

01:03:04.975 --> 01:03:07.500
because he wants to establish set up to stay here.

01:03:07.524 --> 01:03:18.733
Then he will choose some peoples
who can arrange for their stay

01:03:18.733 --> 01:03:21.098
Means if some people are coming
here serve them food,

01:03:21.122 --> 01:03:24.367
buy vegetables , cook food etc.

01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:26.391
Then he will hire some officers
who will work for him.

01:03:26.423 --> 01:03:28.331
that means they have been given Moksha..

01:03:28.355 --> 01:03:29.930
They don't have to do any other job.

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:34.067
Either go on cooking vegetable
or just serve them food.

01:03:34.067 --> 01:03:37.888
Means one work has been alloted to Indra

01:03:37.912 --> 01:03:41.167
though he is not from Devgana's

01:03:41.191 --> 01:03:47.655
As on five element there is one
deity alloted to each of them

01:03:47.679 --> 01:03:50.667
and these deities alloted
has been given Moksha.

01:03:50.667 --> 01:03:52.690
Then their disciples are alloted.

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:54.721
They have been also given Moksha.

01:03:54.745 --> 01:03:56.730
They just have to do this duty.

01:03:56.754 --> 01:03:58.754
Now you are Guests.

01:03:58.778 --> 01:04:01.555
This all organisation
has been created for you.

01:04:01.579 --> 01:04:06.567
Then why do you
want their position?

01:04:06.591 --> 01:04:13.500
So in this manner there are 5
Chiranjivis(group immortals) alloted.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:17.733
Means whole stage is ready.

01:04:17.733 --> 01:04:21.500
Now you should come on stage.

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:26.830
But now you are saying that we don't want
to act on stage I want to do make up.

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:29.467
Why do you want do it? They already
have peoples alloted there.

01:04:29.467 --> 01:04:35.733
Means as everything stage
by stage got ready

01:04:35.733 --> 01:04:38.045
in that organisation those
peoples are allocated now,

01:04:38.069 --> 01:04:40.233
then why are you going there?

01:04:40.257 --> 01:04:45.033
Now your state is at this point.

01:04:45.033 --> 01:04:47.990
From that some are on left side
and some are right side

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:54.567
Ganas are on left side and
Gandharvas are on right side

01:04:54.567 --> 01:04:56.553
In this manner everything is organised like this.

01:04:56.553 --> 01:04:59.433
Now it's your time to enter

01:04:59.457 --> 01:05:02.400
and above that you should
go on superconciuosness

01:05:02.424 --> 01:05:05.321
on this(right) side is
collective subconcious

01:05:05.345 --> 01:05:09.800
and on this side(left) is
collective supraconcious

01:05:09.824 --> 01:05:14.700
Beyond that you have to reach to superconcious.
This is Ganesha's abode

01:05:14.724 --> 01:05:19.933
There only Ganesha is residing.

01:05:19.957 --> 01:05:23.967
Only Ganapati can reside at
(lotus) feet of Sadashiva

01:05:23.991 --> 01:05:27.733
and you have been created just like Ganesha.

01:05:27.733 --> 01:05:33.000
and reaching to that state many
Ganesha's should be created

01:05:33.024 --> 01:05:40.067
So this state(condition) is different
Ganesha don't want Moksha.

01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:43.133
Your work(role) is different.

01:05:43.157 --> 01:05:45.833
and state(situation) is different
if you understand this

01:05:45.833 --> 01:05:48.905
Then (Shri) Mataji let always
Sahajayoga happen in me

01:05:48.929 --> 01:05:52.293
and let this work get done through
me this you should desire

01:05:52.317 --> 01:05:54.421
And that's what you should enjoy.

01:05:54.445 --> 01:05:57.221
Like while swimming you jumps
into water and

01:05:57.245 --> 01:06:04.200
starts swimming in same manner you
should enjoy.

01:06:04.315 --> 01:06:14.400
Is there any other question?

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.367
Can see image....??

01:06:17.367 --> 01:06:22.067
Since you have seen photo many times
you are seeing photo is not bad

01:06:22.091 --> 01:06:24.091
But you should become one with photo

01:06:24.115 --> 01:06:26.891
What you see later also tell...

01:06:26.915 --> 01:06:30.333
I am also just a bubble....you don't know.

01:06:30.357 --> 01:06:32.900
I have just taken one form.

01:06:32.924 --> 01:06:34.733
This is just an illusion.

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:38.933
When it will become threadbare or
when something will happen cannot be predicted.

01:06:38.957 --> 01:06:40.957
Then what about me?

01:06:41.017 --> 01:06:48.767
So now certainly when we(I am)are sitting
here in this form should be benefited completely.

01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:54.967
and whatever love and devotion you have about it(this incarnation) you will be blessed due to that.

01:06:54.991 --> 01:06:58.621
Not just this but infront
of all Sahajayogis

01:06:58.645 --> 01:07:05.170
I have to accept it and
say it that since all deities are within me

01:07:05.194 --> 01:07:07.955
if you have been humiliating
or disrespectful towards me

01:07:07.979 --> 01:07:09.510
then all these deities will be angry.

01:07:09.534 --> 01:07:13.850
Within them also four deities are very strict.

01:07:13.874 --> 01:07:15.555
Ganesha is very strict himself.

01:07:15.579 --> 01:07:19.800
Sahajayogis face sometimes his rap.

01:07:19.824 --> 01:07:21.885
After him you know Bhairavnath.

01:07:21.909 --> 01:07:23.767
I don't have to tell you about him.

01:07:23.791 --> 01:07:25.733
Third one is Hanumana

01:07:25.733 --> 01:07:28.230
and fourth one is Kartikeya

01:07:28.254 --> 01:07:31.367
or whom we call Christ.

01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:34.633
In this manner these very resounding
four are sitting around on four sides

01:07:34.657 --> 01:07:36.567
and they are your elder brothers.

01:07:36.591 --> 01:07:38.364
and they give you rap.

01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:40.588
All these deities are within me

01:07:40.612 --> 01:07:46.077
thats why you should please me.

01:07:46.117 --> 01:07:49.677
Now what should I say I have to tell it by myself.

01:07:49.677 --> 01:07:55.003
and while telling this (I) have to
become humble like human being.

01:07:55.027 --> 01:07:57.743
But what should I do it's just like this

01:07:57.767 --> 01:08:03.700
Thats why I have to make you
aware that take care.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:07.024
It makes big trouble afterwards.

01:08:07.048 --> 01:08:10.500
and then they cannot bear it.

01:08:10.524 --> 01:08:12.655
So be careful though I am very gentle

01:08:12.679 --> 01:08:15.833
these peoles are within me.

01:08:15.857 --> 01:08:18.837
You know about them it's difficult job.

01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:21.267
and that is fixed.

01:08:21.267 --> 01:08:24.268
You cannot change them cannot compromise them.

01:08:24.268 --> 01:08:28.900
Whatever I convince them "Now be pleased...".but no.....No No means no....

01:08:28.924 --> 01:08:33.400
They will indicate exactly...exactly...

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.400
"Shree Mataji they have this they are talking unnecessarily..."

01:08:36.424 --> 01:08:40.300
However I ask them to "Forgive" but "No"...

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:45.230
Unless and until that person gets
corrected they will go on following him

01:08:45.254 --> 01:08:48.933
.Now for example there was a
gentlemen called Madhu Dave.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.598
He is from America.

01:08:50.622 --> 01:08:52.937
Though now he is very good Sahajayogi.

01:08:52.937 --> 01:08:55.445
Now even I talk about
him he will not feel bad

01:08:55.469 --> 01:08:58.033
because now he has accepted all this.

01:08:58.057 --> 01:09:01.900
So earlier he came from America

01:09:01.924 --> 01:09:06.533
but I didn't show anything to him
that I know something or etc....

01:09:06.533 --> 01:09:11.788
And Mr. Pradhan Sir he also didn't hurt him

01:09:11.812 --> 01:09:13.767
and was shown alot of respect to him

01:09:13.767 --> 01:09:16.688
So when this Mr. Madhu Dave came here

01:09:16.712 --> 01:09:21.167
two three peoples said to me that
this person looks little messy.

01:09:21.167 --> 01:09:24.833
They said when did hands towards him we felt dizzy.

01:09:24.833 --> 01:09:27.688
I said I know everything you don't worry

01:09:27.712 --> 01:09:30.500
I will take him ahead.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:36.090
Immediately I said to him that You have started ashram over there in my name.

01:09:36.114 --> 01:09:38.367
So now show me it's brochure.

01:09:38.391 --> 01:09:41.688
Then in that brochure it was written

01:09:41.712 --> 01:09:48.500
to give vibrations 50 dollar

01:09:48.524 --> 01:09:55.603
and to give special vibrations
200 or more dollars...

01:09:55.603 --> 01:10:01.067
So I said its terrific now what should I say??

01:10:01.067 --> 01:10:04.445
So I told him "Now
you see you cannot take money like this.

01:10:04.469 --> 01:10:06.833
How much money have you given to me?"

01:10:06.857 --> 01:10:11.333
Means I travelled to America and
everywhere with my own money

01:10:11.357 --> 01:10:13.567
Saheb(Sir CP) gave me all money

01:10:13.591 --> 01:10:16.897
And to stay there and food all
I did with my own money

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:19.823
Even hall booking and all that was
done by moeny from Saheb(Sir C.P.)

01:10:19.847 --> 01:10:21.847
My relatives sent money.

01:10:21.871 --> 01:10:28.833
So by spending money from my own pocket
I gave you realisation.

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:32.683
So then now how can
you earn money from this?

01:10:32.707 --> 01:10:34.750
Then he said how should I servive?

01:10:34.774 --> 01:10:38.333
I said "Do whatever you want.
There are many buisnesses."

01:10:38.357 --> 01:10:40.931
But you cannot money through this.

01:10:40.931 --> 01:10:45.133
Then he got very angry because
he was caught up with badhas.

01:10:45.133 --> 01:10:48.133
and he started talking ruthlessly.

01:10:48.157 --> 01:10:52.267
All sahajayogis were very angry.

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:54.291
and he was getting excited(more angry).

01:10:54.315 --> 01:10:56.828
At last our Modi who is
little strict he stood up.

01:10:56.852 --> 01:11:01.267
Then he told him strictly now if you will talk
a single word I will throw you down from up.

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:04.533
Then he got little astonished
and went down.

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:06.523
So he was having this thinking that

01:11:06.523 --> 01:11:11.567
if you are a Sahajayogi then you should
listen even if someone is cursing your Mother.

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:15.600
Even if someone is beating her then still you
should see it because you are disciple of Christ.

01:11:15.624 --> 01:11:17.831
But if Christ Disciple would have said
something about

01:11:17.855 --> 01:11:23.303
his Mother then his real form which is
of Ekadasha Rudra would have come out.

01:11:23.327 --> 01:11:28.197
Thats why Christ never said that
my Mother is Adishakti.

01:11:28.221 --> 01:11:31.997
So if he bear it then you will believe him.

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:34.600
He would have never been patient with this.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:38.200
Thats why he never told that my Mother is Adishakti.

01:11:38.201 --> 01:11:41.168
So he said something like this and

01:11:41.204 --> 01:11:43.933
then he went to some Guru or someone

01:11:43.933 --> 01:11:47.667
There was some Guru. Now I forgot his name.

01:11:47.667 --> 01:11:51.467
He was in Kalikat or somewhere. He reached there.

01:11:51.467 --> 01:11:58.500
When that Guru arrived immediately he praised

01:11:58.524 --> 01:12:00.152
He said "How did you came back from there?

01:12:00.176 --> 01:12:01.700
What did you thought about her who is she?

01:12:01.724 --> 01:12:04.567
She is Verily(sakshat) Adishakti. I know it.

01:12:04.591 --> 01:12:08.333
And you disrespected her there ...(wording little unclear)

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:18.000
And additionally he said praise to me and
recorded and immediately sent with him.

01:12:18.024 --> 01:12:20.977
He didn't talk anything later just
asked him to seek for forgiveness.

01:12:21.001 --> 01:12:22.801
Then he came to London.

01:12:22.825 --> 01:12:24.998
Now I will tell you also (how he was) whiplashed.

01:12:25.085 --> 01:12:29.002
He came to Mumbai

01:12:29.026 --> 01:12:30.629
He got fever.

01:12:30.653 --> 01:12:32.353
Due to which he could not meet me.

01:12:32.353 --> 01:12:35.679
Meet this person ..meet that person..
he couldn't reach to me.

01:12:35.703 --> 01:12:37.653
He just wasn't allowed to reach upto me.

01:12:37.677 --> 01:12:39.997
Later on he rang me up

01:12:40.021 --> 01:12:43.934
Then he said "Mataji I want to talk with you littlebit.
You see I brought tape(recording). Let me play a littlebit."

01:12:43.958 --> 01:12:47.705
Then he played that (recording)over telephone.
I said Ok Ok we will meet.

01:12:47.729 --> 01:12:49.729
So you come tomorrow.

01:12:49.753 --> 01:12:51.052
What time? I said 10 o'clock.

01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:54.585
At 10 'o clock he could not
get vechicle or motor nothing..

01:12:54.585 --> 01:12:58.310
He reach to such a state that there
was strike and he couldn't come.

01:12:58.334 --> 01:13:02.481
Then later on he ranged me up that
I was not able to reach there now.

01:13:02.505 --> 01:13:05.000
So I said "What could be done it's Hanumana's work, ok!"

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.100
"That Hanumana who is over there
near by you, it's his work ok!"

01:13:09.124 --> 01:13:16.867
"Now what's is this your tail(to Shri Hanumana) now control it, let him come... But invain no means no.."

01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:20.488
So then I said " Atleast come to meet me at Airport

01:13:20.512 --> 01:13:26.533
I am going to London,
no but even there he couldn't reach"

01:13:26.557 --> 01:13:31.033
Something happened may be
his motor was failed.

01:13:31.057 --> 01:13:32.888
Then later on he wrote letter to me that

01:13:32.912 --> 01:13:38.150
"Mataji I couldn't understand this. I was
so much desparate to meet but invain."

01:13:38.150 --> 01:13:40.850
Since then he has written
letter three times.

01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:42.433
Day before yesterday
again received letter.

01:13:42.457 --> 01:13:43.833
Now we will see afterwards.

01:13:43.857 --> 01:13:47.684
Whenever Hanumana will desire
then only we will go.

01:13:47.708 --> 01:13:49.700
Now he is inviting many times that
now we will do like this.

01:13:49.724 --> 01:13:54.933
I said now to him "Now you stop doing buisness
of Sahajayoga and start your own buisness"

01:13:54.957 --> 01:13:58.730
Now he has become professor
and he is doing job.

01:13:58.754 --> 01:14:02.033
So like this you get beaten up
this has to be understood.

01:14:02.057 --> 01:14:04.325
Likewise many Sahajayogis
have faced such thrashes.

01:14:04.349 --> 01:14:07.100
There was one of our
Sahajayogini in Mumbai.

01:14:07.124 --> 01:14:09.951
So when I was going
to America I said to her,

01:14:09.975 --> 01:14:15.043
"Madam you see You were Disciple of that
Guru he was having this Siddhi and etc.

01:14:15.043 --> 01:14:17.896
"So after I leave it will enter in you also."

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.920
She said ,"I don't want that Mataji."
I said,"Oh ok."

01:14:19.944 --> 01:14:23.067
"So, then be vigilent." I said to her

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:26.633
After I left means I was just outside
for three months not too long.

01:14:26.633 --> 01:14:31.067
Within that period that lady established
great empire of Mataji.

01:14:31.091 --> 01:14:35.867
And holding stick in her hand
she used to beat peoples.

01:14:35.970 --> 01:14:38.803
Will it be mine like this any time???

01:14:38.803 --> 01:14:41.533
And she used to predict numbers for horse betting.

01:14:41.557 --> 01:14:43.770
This was Mataji's greatness glory(Mahatmya)??

01:14:43.794 --> 01:14:48.551
Three three thousand peoples used
to visit three three thousand...

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:53.955
she used to ask to
give her sarees

01:14:53.979 --> 01:14:55.931
give me this give me that....

01:14:55.955 --> 01:14:58.067
and so much money she
extracted from peoples.

01:14:58.091 --> 01:14:59.611
She took alot of money from peoples.

01:14:59.635 --> 01:15:04.833
I went that day. I got to know but I don't
know what should I write down in letter.

01:15:04.857 --> 01:15:08.533
Otherwise I will again forget,
after coming back,

01:15:08.557 --> 01:15:10.111
What a respect I was shown.

01:15:10.135 --> 01:15:13.438
She took me over there and
washed my feet with silver pots

01:15:13.462 --> 01:15:15.361
and this and that...etc..

01:15:15.361 --> 01:15:18.203
And I found that all bhoots there.

01:15:18.227 --> 01:15:19.902
That you are so much glorious this that.

01:15:19.926 --> 01:15:22.374
She offered such a big
garland to me to my photo.

01:15:22.398 --> 01:15:26.067
I just removed it within two minutes.
I thought now how should I tell them.

01:15:26.091 --> 01:15:28.530
Atlast I asked her to come to home.

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:32.131
Then told her that now you
have alot of knowledge so..

01:15:32.155 --> 01:15:34.155
She said,"No Mother this is all your power",

01:15:34.179 --> 01:15:38.466
then I said " Yes all is my power so you tell something about him the one who is sitting next to you. Tell about his past."

01:15:38.490 --> 01:15:42.363
That she couldn't understand.. thought of it

01:15:42.387 --> 01:15:44.385
"What this has happened Mataji?

01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:46.733
Have you taken back my all powers?"
says so and she came to my feet.

01:15:46.757 --> 01:15:50.597
I said if it was your power it would
have been above my head.

01:15:50.597 --> 01:15:53.837
This was some dirty power which has come
to you which I told you earlier.

01:15:53.837 --> 01:15:56.910
Then she started saying that Kumkum is coming
out of my hand rice is coming out of my hand.

01:15:56.934 --> 01:16:01.000
I said, "Ok then take out
Kumkum infront of me."

01:16:01.024 --> 01:16:05.033
What Kumkum and what anything ...
her hands started becoming like this...

01:16:05.033 --> 01:16:09.430
I said "Ok now say in front of
me that, I want Param. Say. "

01:16:09.454 --> 01:16:13.743
She said and all that happened but this
publicity craze cannot be detached.

01:16:13.767 --> 01:16:16.001
Then she was so big buptious

01:16:16.001 --> 01:16:17.943
So many peoples used to visit her.

01:16:17.943 --> 01:16:21.430
Earlier I said I should send her
my photo then will see.

01:16:21.454 --> 01:16:28.133
Asked for photo .. so then we are so great.
Now she is in mental assyalum.

01:16:28.133 --> 01:16:31.067
She is established over there.

01:16:31.067 --> 01:16:33.018
Now is this matter I
haven't done anything.

01:16:33.042 --> 01:16:36.533
Once you have said me
Mother I don't do anything.

01:16:36.557 --> 01:16:40.100
In the same manner another
overwise was behind me.

01:16:40.124 --> 01:16:45.255
He was having great
plight so his wife said

01:16:45.279 --> 01:16:47.600
"Mataji you give him work on your boat."

01:16:47.624 --> 01:16:52.031
So I said "Ok come we will see if you get some work on boat will be good."

01:16:52.055 --> 01:16:53.718
Not beacause is Sahajayogi

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:56.021
but his wife was
very Dharmik(religious)

01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:58.537
so if her husband gets
job will be good so..

01:16:58.561 --> 01:17:02.000
But he started doing
corruption over there.

01:17:02.024 --> 01:17:06.805
Those peoples told me, "Mataji how is this man? He
started corrupting here and he is troubling us too."

01:17:06.829 --> 01:17:09.067
I said " You fire him out."

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:11.855
I asked him "Why are you
doing corruption over there?"

01:17:11.879 --> 01:17:14.958
He said "It all just happening over there.
Its just like that."

01:17:14.982 --> 01:17:16.683
I said "But this will
not be tolerated here"

01:17:16.707 --> 01:17:19.045
I said "Our Sir's(Sir CP) work
place this will not be tolerated.

01:17:19.069 --> 01:17:20.361
He never did any corruption.

01:17:20.361 --> 01:17:23.300
If he was bribing I would
not be live anymore.

01:17:23.307 --> 01:17:25.171
You are Sahajayogi that's why
I send you there

01:17:25.195 --> 01:17:26.733
and you are doing
such things  there.

01:17:26.733 --> 01:17:28.483
You just leave from here
now. Don't stay anymore here."

01:17:28.507 --> 01:17:30.243
He got angry over this.

01:17:30.267 --> 01:17:34.800
Where ever were our centres he went
there and brain washed peoples there.

01:17:34.824 --> 01:17:38.088
Many peoples got spoilt also.

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:42.525
But once he met one
lady she was very simple

01:17:42.549 --> 01:17:45.711
and I just gave her Realisation first time only

01:17:45.735 --> 01:17:48.043
but very wise one our Ms.Oak.

01:17:48.067 --> 01:17:49.707
Don't have some special education.

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:51.398
Very wise women in household things.

01:17:51.422 --> 01:17:54.067
I said to her elderly sister.

01:17:54.091 --> 01:17:55.883
He met her.

01:17:55.907 --> 01:17:58.931
And started telling to her that your
Mataji is like this like that.

01:17:58.955 --> 01:18:01.767
All that is false and this is not truth not
this not that bla bla..

01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:08.100
After listening all she said, "You see you
tell me how many people you have cured?

01:18:08.124 --> 01:18:10.124
How many people you have given realisation?

01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:12.237
How many people life you have transformed?

01:18:12.261 --> 01:18:15.557
Due to Mataji in our home my husband's
all addictions were cured.

01:18:15.581 --> 01:18:17.581
My daughters are settled nicely.

01:18:17.605 --> 01:18:19.533
Laxmi(auspicious wealth)
settled in our home.

01:18:19.557 --> 01:18:21.223
Our diseases are cured.

01:18:21.223 --> 01:18:22.830
and now we are in good condition.

01:18:22.854 --> 01:18:26.600
So now why should we listen to you?
Who are you?

01:18:26.624 --> 01:18:30.211
You met us also at Mataji's place and I
don't know such dirt is coming over there.

01:18:30.235 --> 01:18:33.467
I never want to see such faces."

01:18:33.491 --> 01:18:36.251
Since then he felt like slapped him.

01:18:36.251 --> 01:18:39.400
But still he did lot of extreme things.

01:18:39.424 --> 01:18:44.567
Means there are such people troubling saints
they will bother but we have to be careful.

01:18:44.591 --> 01:18:46.733
We shouldn't become like them.

01:18:46.757 --> 01:18:50.700
At the end he wrote against me to Government.

01:18:50.724 --> 01:18:52.331
Means gainst all of us.

01:18:52.355 --> 01:18:54.665
That they are like this like that...

01:18:54.689 --> 01:18:58.367
We are not taking single
penny what they can find out about me?

01:18:58.391 --> 01:19:02.633
So in Government also you
see how it happens.

01:19:02.657 --> 01:19:10.950
That Lokayukt (an authority dealing with anticorruption) summoned Mr.Pradhan our trustee.

01:19:10.974 --> 01:19:15.367
They summoned.They send me letter
I forgot to tell you.

01:19:15.367 --> 01:19:20.403
Justice Kotwal asked him "Who is this MATAJI?"
He was chief justice.

01:19:20.427 --> 01:19:23.000
And he junior lawyer to father.

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:26.183
He saw me when I was
little baby at Nagpur.

01:19:26.183 --> 01:19:29.900
And my father amazing human
being very great

01:19:29.924 --> 01:19:34.863
Means if he has arrived in court even Chief
Justice used to get up from their chair.

01:19:34.887 --> 01:19:37.967
So infront of him (Father) they used to get up.
Such people were there.

01:19:37.991 --> 01:19:42.033
Means very great people.Means thats
why I was born to him.

01:19:42.033 --> 01:19:47.700
Means after all happenning he found
out details of this person.

01:19:47.724 --> 01:19:50.633
He wrote one letter to me. I have
shown that letter to Saheb(Sir C.P.).

01:19:50.657 --> 01:19:53.991
He wrote in it that he have found
out this persons address

01:19:54.015 --> 01:19:59.223
and my duty is to punish such
peoples who are troubling peoples like you.

01:19:59.247 --> 01:20:01.247
But I want your permission.

01:20:01.272 --> 01:20:02.770
Then I wrote him,

01:20:02.794 --> 01:20:06.300
"You see, once he called me Mother so don't do anything.

01:20:06.324 --> 01:20:10.367
Saheb (Sir C.P.) said " Why not?
Why are you saying this?"

01:20:10.391 --> 01:20:12.297
He was even angry at me.

01:20:12.321 --> 01:20:17.900
I said "No. Once he has called me Mother
then however may be son I accept him"

01:20:17.924 --> 01:20:19.924
Still he suffered alot.

01:20:19.948 --> 01:20:23.767
But still we have be careful
we have to be vigilent alert.

01:20:23.791 --> 01:20:28.200
Because after realisation negativity
can enter within by many means.

01:20:28.224 --> 01:20:30.771
and it not only take you on wrong path but also

01:20:30.795 --> 01:20:37.267
take you to very wrong
path and people have to suffer alot.

01:20:37.291 --> 01:20:39.733
Like this many instances
have happened.

01:20:39.757 --> 01:20:43.067
In same manner there was another person.
Let me just tell you a little bit

01:20:43.091 --> 01:20:49.667
When he came to Sahajayoga
he had bad habits about women.

01:20:49.667 --> 01:20:53.300
I told him many times that
you change your this habit.

01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:55.718
Turn down your eyes turn down your eyes.

01:20:55.742 --> 01:20:57.633
Don't go on looking at women.

01:20:57.657 --> 01:20:58.978
This is not allowed in Sahajayoga.

01:20:59.002 --> 01:21:01.483
Mean a while negativity entered in him.

01:21:01.507 --> 01:21:04.333
And I gave him alot of powers.

01:21:04.357 --> 01:21:06.397
and when he got these powers.

01:21:06.397 --> 01:21:08.900
He used take out bhoots nicely.

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:13.043
Then he started doing such
things on one girl.

01:21:13.043 --> 01:21:15.867
In that dirt he flown away.

01:21:15.891 --> 01:21:18.721
While flowing in that he got so much
negativity within him that

01:21:18.745 --> 01:21:21.567
he took many people in that dirt.

01:21:21.591 --> 01:21:26.604
I pull all them out but he just flow away
in that dirt and  got lost.

01:21:26.628 --> 01:21:28.977
And he got so many attacks

01:21:29.001 --> 01:21:31.667
that only poverty came at his doorstep.

01:21:31.691 --> 01:21:35.200
Now he has just became mad just mad.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:37.367
Just became mad.

01:21:37.391 --> 01:21:40.867
His wife so positive but she is just weeping now.

01:21:40.891 --> 01:21:44.567
His son is realised.
He is always beating him.

01:21:44.591 --> 01:21:50.717
Though after having so much
he got completely apocalypsed.

01:21:50.741 --> 01:21:57.500
Till now I am telling  him
that you completely beg for forgiveness

01:21:57.567 --> 01:22:00.338
Then only these deities will
be agreed because all this is not my work

01:22:00.362 --> 01:22:02.467
it's all Bhairva's work.

01:22:02.491 --> 01:22:06.397
It's Bhairava's work. He is very difficult
deity I am telling you.

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:08.757
These Black threads etc.. are Bhairava's .....
Only he knows them.

01:22:08.781 --> 01:22:11.155
That Bhairava has to give.

01:22:11.179 --> 01:22:13.285
It's very difficult to preserve it.

01:22:13.309 --> 01:22:17.323
It is very subtle and how to say
a deity who highly punishes.

01:22:17.347 --> 01:22:19.347
It is not easy to take
care for this deity.

01:22:19.371 --> 01:22:22.197
So I told him that
Bhairva has disfavored you.

01:22:22.221 --> 01:22:27.633
So you beg for his forgiveness and
we will also change you and will see.

01:22:27.657 --> 01:22:31.233
And sakshat (In person) Bhairava gave Darshan (Auspicious visit) to him one day.

01:22:31.257 --> 01:22:36.017
You will be surprised that from my agya
chakra Bhairava came out and he saw that.

01:22:36.041 --> 01:22:37.821
Very Dark Black...

01:22:37.845 --> 01:22:43.133
He(Bhairava) came and did circumambulation(Pradakshina)
to me three times and folded his hands and went away.

01:22:43.157 --> 01:22:47.123
When he saw this in reality
still he was not afraid.

01:22:47.147 --> 01:22:49.688
and he thought how
it will come to Mataji's notice?

01:22:49.712 --> 01:22:51.667
Whatever way we may behave
is ok doesn't matter.

01:22:51.691 --> 01:22:54.921
Means afterwards
people were so afraid that

01:22:54.945 --> 01:22:58.155
so if we want to prepare one ashram then

01:22:58.179 --> 01:23:01.651
we should make only floor so
that we can stay in Mataji's kingdom

01:23:01.675 --> 01:23:06.067
if there will be second floor then it will
get dirty such fear people were having.

01:23:06.091 --> 01:23:09.133
People are afraid upto this extent.

01:23:09.133 --> 01:23:11.567
So we should be vigilent.

01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:18.033
We have many weaknesses and
they are tested after Sahajayoga.

01:23:18.057 --> 01:23:22.533
So we should be positive and
we should obtain it.

01:23:22.557 --> 01:23:26.033
For this we don't have
to leave household

01:23:26.057 --> 01:23:27.433
Should have childrens.

01:23:27.457 --> 01:23:29.457
Well organised auspicious
events should be done.

01:23:29.481 --> 01:23:31.833
Should get marry.

01:23:31.857 --> 01:23:33.417
Childrens should be born.

01:23:33.417 --> 01:23:40.000
And today so many great souls so
many saints are awaiting to take birth.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.430
They should have such
lovely beautiful household.

01:23:42.449 --> 01:23:45.821
If there were not so holy people
in this world like my father and mother

01:23:45.845 --> 01:23:48.133
it was difficult for me
too take birth in this world.

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:50.531
They were so holy

01:23:50.555 --> 01:23:53.921
that you wo'nt believe.

01:23:53.945 --> 01:23:56.967
Both of them husband and
wife were very very holy.

01:23:56.991 --> 01:23:59.698
So if such husband and
wife came into world

01:23:59.722 --> 01:24:01.722
and if they establish such family

01:24:01.746 --> 01:24:03.746
and if they establish such
a beautiful oraganisation

01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:06.435
then such great great
people will be born.

01:24:06.459 --> 01:24:09.170
and they will be so much helpful to us in Sahajayoga.

01:24:09.194 --> 01:24:11.194
In such home if one Sahajayogi is born

01:24:11.218 --> 01:24:16.067
Then even if any other Sahajayogis
are spoiled he will put them right.

01:24:16.091 --> 01:24:17.871
and will cleanse them out.

01:24:17.871 --> 01:24:21.305
Now my granddaughter she is telling me

01:24:21.329 --> 01:24:25.233
that,"I am only praying to God Almighty that.."

01:24:25.257 --> 01:24:27.257
I asked her "What?"

01:24:27.281 --> 01:24:32.433
She said "All people should get realised
in our family should get realised at once.

01:24:32.457 --> 01:24:35.758
and if all people in this world
gets realised then it will be so joyous.

01:24:35.782 --> 01:24:37.467
There will not be any trouble."

01:24:37.491 --> 01:24:40.300
and through her innocent mind she
just asked this nothing else.

01:24:40.324 --> 01:24:43.433
that no falsehood no hypocrisy.

01:24:43.433 --> 01:24:45.617
no superficial thing

01:24:45.617 --> 01:24:48.390
But that whatever is truth should everyone get.

01:24:48.414 --> 01:24:51.323
She is asking me, "Why are you cooking for everyone Nani?"

01:24:51.323 --> 01:24:53.565
"You just do this about everyone.

01:24:53.589 --> 01:24:56.033
Just do this. Somehow
you will be able to do it."

01:24:56.057 --> 01:24:58.845
She is just asking this prayer to
God everyday night

01:24:58.869 --> 01:25:02.800
and tears are rolling
out of her little eyes.

01:25:02.824 --> 01:25:08.000
What an innocent mind is this, what she
want is that everyone should be realised.

01:25:08.024 --> 01:25:12.200
Her mind is so much Motherly.
You ask these Sahajayogis who came to us

01:25:12.224 --> 01:25:16.100
for them she used to fetch water for them
in bucket with her little hands.

01:25:16.124 --> 01:25:19.533
Used to ask them to keep feet in that
water. Wash their one one feet.

01:25:19.557 --> 01:25:20.657
Used to wipe their face.

01:25:20.681 --> 01:25:23.321
Very little she was five years
maybe not even five yrs

01:25:23.345 --> 01:25:26.037
five years she became later on.

01:25:26.061 --> 01:25:29.133
Wipe out their face. Wash their feet.

01:25:29.157 --> 01:25:32.448
After doing all this then throw
away that water in toilet.

01:25:32.472 --> 01:25:34.839
They used to keep back those buckets.

01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:37.952
But she used to say "No no all I will do myself."
All work she did by herself.

01:25:37.976 --> 01:25:40.711
And after that she came to my feet

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:43.721
and then she said that "Now after
this I will not do anything ok."

01:25:43.745 --> 01:25:45.767
and then run away.

01:25:45.791 --> 01:25:47.351
Always she used to be present there.

01:25:47.375 --> 01:25:50.388
They used be so much worried about
everyones little little things.

01:25:50.412 --> 01:25:53.335
How this is going wrong?
where is this going wrong?

01:25:53.359 --> 01:25:56.665
My another grand daughter who is in hostel,

01:25:56.689 --> 01:26:02.303
she told everyone that "This food is hot make it cool
down like this (vibrate). My grandmother told."

01:26:02.327 --> 01:26:04.988
All those childrens
are doing like that.

01:26:05.012 --> 01:26:07.181
School staff was asking
"What she has taught them?"

01:26:07.205 --> 01:26:09.111
But those childrens liked it,

01:26:09.135 --> 01:26:12.267
So since then they are doing
like this and vibrating it and then eating.

01:26:12.291 --> 01:26:17.567
Like wise in many places these little
little souls do great great work.

01:26:17.591 --> 01:26:24.967
Yes his son was telling
Avdhut that remove shoes.

01:26:24.991 --> 01:26:31.003
Sahajayogi: While beating hold sleepers upside down and beat

01:26:31.003 --> 01:26:35.696
What she has told me if you listen it you will be surprised. Such great souls should be born in this world.

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:42.667
Her father was working in
Petroleum dept. in Indian Oil.

01:26:42.691 --> 01:26:47.433
So she used to listen that in our country oil is
very less very less petrol this that..

01:26:47.457 --> 01:26:51.807
She was quite small at that time may
be three three and half yrs. old.

01:26:51.832 --> 01:26:56.421
Then one day she told to Modi
that "In our country have very less petrol"

01:26:56.445 --> 01:26:59.843
then he said "Yes yes now its very less."

01:26:59.843 --> 01:27:06.855
He said "This is very easy work. You do one thing
that in some petrol you let Mataji dip her feet

01:27:06.879 --> 01:27:09.865
and that petrol you can put in
nearby sea somewhere

01:27:09.889 --> 01:27:12.100
then petrol will come over there itself."

01:27:12.124 --> 01:27:17.721
So Modi when we went to Bordi

01:27:17.745 --> 01:27:21.400
he took oil over there and put it you see.

01:27:21.424 --> 01:27:25.571
You will be surprised that she used to
tell him so many things.

01:27:25.595 --> 01:27:28.400
One day one women
came she was caught up.

01:27:28.424 --> 01:27:31.497
So she went inside and
brought one big broom.

01:27:31.521 --> 01:27:34.807
And she was showing me that from curtain.
I said "What is this?"

01:27:34.831 --> 01:27:37.147
She said "Use this on
her so it will be better."

01:27:37.172 --> 01:27:37.938
I said "Upon her??"

01:27:37.991 --> 01:27:42.367
She said "No just beat on sides two times
she will be better."

01:27:42.367 --> 01:27:47.433
"Not above but from sides two times
she will be better."  and it really happened .

01:27:47.457 --> 01:27:51.263
She knows so many things.

01:27:51.287 --> 01:27:53.798
My grand son also he also know so much.

01:27:53.822 --> 01:27:56.910
I feel he is just
Shankaracharya's incarnation.

01:27:56.934 --> 01:27:58.545
Just cannot explain it...

01:27:58.569 --> 01:28:01.467
They are just beating(improvising)
everyone from morning till evening.

01:28:01.491 --> 01:28:06.133
Their grandfather asked them that "You are beating everyone but why don't you beat your Grandmother?"

01:28:06.157 --> 01:28:08.131
Then they replied "What
is this unwise talk ?"

01:28:08.155 --> 01:28:11.424
Then he asked "Why?" He replied
"Whether anyone is beating Goddesss"

01:28:11.448 --> 01:28:15.000
"She is the Greatest Goddess.
Shall anyone beat her??"

01:28:15.024 --> 01:28:20.200
Means you see so much wisdom though
they are just four years old..

01:28:20.224 --> 01:28:21.524
Mine Anand (Shree Mataji's grandson)

01:28:21.548 --> 01:28:24.833
He is only four years old all these
kids he put them right by tapping them.

01:28:24.857 --> 01:28:26.651
He used to tell them
that I will ride upon you like horse

01:28:26.675 --> 01:28:32.067
and he tapped upon their Kundalini
so much and put them all all right.

01:28:32.091 --> 01:28:35.405
And like wise there are
many many great souls

01:28:35.429 --> 01:28:37.177
whom we don't recognize them.

01:28:37.201 --> 01:28:39.201
Make your good family.

01:28:39.225 --> 01:28:42.291
In many families some male are realised

01:28:42.315 --> 01:28:43.885
but women are not realised or if women
is realised then men are not realised.

01:28:43.909 --> 01:28:47.210
Make them right then such
great souls will be born to you.

01:28:47.234 --> 01:28:51.000
It has to be there at the base
if it's not there then will be very difficult.

01:28:51.024 --> 01:28:54.470
That's why there many Sahajyogis who
are not ready to get marry.

01:28:54.494 --> 01:28:55.990
I am really tired of.

01:28:56.014 --> 01:28:58.865
"There is some union
Mataji its very suffering.

01:28:58.889 --> 01:29:02.933
We can see other Sahajayogis after marriage
their brains gets roasted due to wives."

01:29:02.957 --> 01:29:04.277
"So no no Sir."

01:29:04.301 --> 01:29:06.043
Everybody has been doing same.

01:29:06.067 --> 01:29:09.085
So such Sahajayogis also
after proper thought over

01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:12.610
should get marry with some
people who are on right path.

01:29:12.634 --> 01:29:13.850
This is my point.

01:29:13.874 --> 01:29:15.889
and now we have came in this wedding hall

01:29:15.913 --> 01:29:17.421
so here itself get marry.

01:29:17.445 --> 01:29:18.921
It's good place.

01:29:18.945 --> 01:29:23.655
Collective wedding.

01:29:23.679 --> 01:29:26.633
And again I give alot of blessings for this.

01:29:26.657 --> 01:29:29.645
So likewsie many marriages
should be performed here.

01:29:29.669 --> 01:29:42.767
Sahajayogis should make such good families
where such great saints will be able to born.

01:29:52.210 --> 01:30:07.700
Sahaja Yogi : "When the kundalini shakti comes at the
Vishudhi chakra, at that time some people feel catch

01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:10.760
which has caused due to chanting
of wrong mantras before,

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:13.867
the same reaction is stored there.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.788
To remove that catch, one of important
mantra to clear is,

01:30:18.812 --> 01:30:34.500
Sarv Mantra Sidhhi sakshat,this
mantra can nourish the vishudhi chakra.

01:30:34.500 --> 01:30:37.330
How to recite that mantra, I will tell,

01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:41.067
please repeat after me 3 times the mantra."

01:30:41.067 --> 01:30:56.800
Om Tvamev Sakshat Shri Sarv Mantra Siddhi
Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah"

01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:12.467
( All the sahaja yogis repeat it 3 times).

01:31:40.667 --> 01:31:50.233
H.H. Shri Mataji: Now to improve Sahastrara , the mantra to be
taken is sahajayogadayini sakshat, this develops the gratitude

01:31:50.233 --> 01:32:14.343
Sahaja Yogi: Now to improve Sahastrara and for its progress
I will say the mantra and everyone should repeat it.

01:32:14.343 --> 01:32:19.238
When the Kundalini comes to
Sahastrar and if you want to feel it,

01:32:19.262 --> 01:32:21.937
this mantra can give you a better feeling.

01:32:21.937 --> 01:32:26.967
We should keep it in our practice
to say this mantra 3 times.

01:32:26.967 --> 01:32:41.233
Om Tvamev sakshat Shri Sahajayogadayini
Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah"

01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:27.803
H.H. Shri Mataji: Mahayogadayini also can
be said, Mahayogdayini is also the same.

01:33:27.803 --> 01:33:29.737
Sahajayogi: There is one more mantra for it

01:33:29.737 --> 01:33:33.921
H.H. Shri Mataji: This is the King of all
yoga,

01:33:33.945 --> 01:33:36.963
this enhances the acceptance

01:33:36.963 --> 01:33:40.191
Sahajayogi: for acceptance sahajayogadayini

01:33:40.215 --> 01:33:51.723
and for the perfection
Mahayogadayini should be recited.

01:33:51.723 --> 01:33:55.137
Lets repeat the same.

01:33:55.137 --> 01:34:09.200
Om Tvamev Sakshat Shri Mahayogadayini
sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:23.767
Everyone repeat it 3 times.

01:34:40.183 --> 01:34:45.736
H.H. Shri Mataji: Now one more thing, few
things about the treatment should also be told.

01:34:45.803 --> 01:34:47.616
You can tell them...

01:34:47.663 --> 01:34:50.721
one thing I feel is about liver..

01:34:50.745 --> 01:34:54.105
how to improve liver,

01:34:54.129 --> 01:34:58.233
what should be done for the
liver, I will tell in brief.

01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:12.030
If there is a catch on right
nabhi then it comes on Liver possibly.

01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:15.457
Liver is here in right
side below rib cage.

01:35:15.457 --> 01:35:20.957
Importance of liver is that,
whatever toxic is there in our body,

01:35:20.957 --> 01:35:29.155
after selecting that liver throws it
out in the blood stream

01:35:29.179 --> 01:35:31.367
and if this selection is not done

01:35:31.391 --> 01:35:33.188
then it gets mixed
up in the liver and

01:35:33.212 --> 01:35:35.133
creates tremendous
heat in the liver.

01:35:35.133 --> 01:35:39.637
Now how does
liver gets problem ,

01:35:39.637 --> 01:35:48.357
in childhood children are given
some heavy food like oil, ghee, peanuts.

01:35:48.357 --> 01:35:50.625
Also the peanut oil is difficult to digest.

01:35:50.649 --> 01:35:53.833
Sesame oil should be used by Sahajayogis.

01:35:53.833 --> 01:35:58.621
Now you know that Gujarati
people have a new disease

01:35:58.645 --> 01:36:01.533
that they get white spots on their skin.

01:36:01.533 --> 01:36:03.821
What do you call it..

01:36:03.845 --> 01:36:12.121
all those happens due to liver.

01:36:12.145 --> 01:36:16.267
All skin diseases happen
due to liver.. all skin diseases.

01:36:16.267 --> 01:36:22.290
That time sometimes
nervousness is also there ,

01:36:22.290 --> 01:36:26.900
mostly 99% skin diseases
are due to liver ..

01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:31.250
Therefore liver has
to be well taken care of..

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:36.200
Life is there till liver ,

01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:40.300
It's on right side, its
called as Yakrut( Liver).

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:43.500
The reason why liver
gets into problem because

01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:50.197
in childhood we give food to
children which are not digestive to liver

01:36:50.197 --> 01:36:54.755
which Ghee, oil and sometimes
milk with too much of cream ,

01:36:54.779 --> 01:37:00.067
that should not be given up to 12
years of age. It should be prohibited.

01:37:00.067 --> 01:37:02.323
Take out cream from the milk then give.

01:37:02.323 --> 01:37:03.880
Milk with cream should not be given ,

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:08.667
Shrikhand( One type of a sweet in India)
which have too much cream

01:37:08.667 --> 01:37:13.980
Items in which too much of oil, Ghee or fried
things are there, we have a practice here ,

01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:17.823
it should not be given to small children.

01:37:17.823 --> 01:37:21.633
And the antidote for it is Chana.

01:37:21.633 --> 01:37:23.583
Chana is very good, protein.

01:37:23.583 --> 01:37:26.010
All Proteins are good for liver.

01:37:26.010 --> 01:37:33.067
but fish & all that heats up
the liver that is not nutritious.

01:37:33.067 --> 01:37:40.667
In protein also e.g. Toor daal
(pigeon pea) is not good for the liver.

01:37:40.667 --> 01:37:45.121
Moong dal is good, for small kids
moong dal should be given.

01:37:45.145 --> 01:37:51.310
If you have to make Toor dal then
put Amsul ( dry Kokum) in that.

01:37:51.437 --> 01:37:54.867
Without Amsul( dry kokum)
Toor dal should not be taken.

01:37:54.867 --> 01:38:01.667
There are 2 types, one is hot
liver & other is cold liver.

01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:05.021
If the liver is hot then

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:08.421
what happens is, people get nausea ,

01:38:08.445 --> 01:38:12.188
acid comes up, body doesn't get nutrition,

01:38:12.212 --> 01:38:15.488
body cannot absorb
nutrition,doesn't feel hungry,

01:38:15.512 --> 01:38:21.388
gets morning dizziness,
always gets headaches,

01:38:21.412 --> 01:38:25.733
These are the symptoms of hot liver.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:29.367
So what is the solution for hot liver?

01:38:29.367 --> 01:38:32.933
it is said that heat kills the heat.

01:38:32.933 --> 01:38:36.953
In summer it is not possible
but in winters the solution is possible.

01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:47.700
Take beaten Ginger and mix it with sugar and eat
in the morning. Sugar is the diet of the liver.

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:52.100
Suagar is food for liver.

01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:57.967
Only Sugar, not that sugar in
fried items or in sweets.

01:38:57.967 --> 01:39:01.221
Rather than the sugar
which comes from sugar cane

01:39:01.245 --> 01:39:06.400
more than that Khadi Sakhar ( Means rock
candy, bigger pieces of sugar) is good.

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:12.730
In summer during hot, Amsul
(dry Kokum) is the best.

01:39:12.730 --> 01:39:19.033
Amsul ( dry Kokum) and Lemon
are very good for liver.

01:39:19.033 --> 01:39:23.000
Amsul ( kokum) can be
soaked in water

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:32.583
and mix it with sugar and keep
taking , it is very good.

01:39:32.583 --> 01:39:34.755
It should not be fried.

01:39:34.779 --> 01:39:39.033
Amsul (dry kokum) water should not be fried,

01:39:39.033 --> 01:39:45.633
Amsul means dry Kokum,
as we call it as Kokum.

01:39:45.633 --> 01:39:48.063
Kokum syrup no,
it should be home made.

01:39:48.063 --> 01:39:50.105
The Kokum syrup which
we make at home that,

01:39:50.129 --> 01:39:57.200
not from the market. Market
Kokum, Amrit Kokum etc not be used.

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:00.380
If we can make it at home then
why to get it from the market.

01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:04.967
Now, the extremes of liver is Jaundice.

01:40:04.967 --> 01:40:08.933
Now the simple solution
for the Jaundice is,

01:40:08.967 --> 01:40:12.903
simple 2 cent solution is ,

01:40:12.903 --> 01:40:15.200
take the leaves of Muli ( Radish),

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:24.500
normally people don't
eat it but it should be eaten.

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:27.933
Whichever is good ,
we give it to animals.

01:40:27.933 --> 01:40:32.033
Radish should be eaten
a lot but not for those who have Gas ..

01:40:32.033 --> 01:40:35.833
for those who don't have Gas trouble ,
they should eat alot of Radish.

01:40:35.833 --> 01:40:38.467
Its like one has one side

01:40:38.467 --> 01:40:41.883
e.g. if there is gas then Pitta(Acid)
will not be there,

01:40:41.883 --> 01:40:45.833
if there is a Pitta ( Acid) then
Gas wont be there. Its all balancing.

01:40:45.833 --> 01:40:51.667
Radish should be eaten, the leaves of
the Radish should be boiled ,

01:40:51.667 --> 01:40:57.133
put some Khadi Sakhar (Rock candy)
in that (Boiled) water,

01:40:57.133 --> 01:41:01.500
and no other water should be
drank , only that water should be taken .

01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:09.533
That soup should be taken,
only rock candy should be used , no salt.

01:41:09.533 --> 01:41:11.633
That water should be taken.

01:41:11.633 --> 01:41:20.800
It's a medicine worth 2 cents.
Take it for 3 days for Jaundice.

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:27.683
Another medicine which Sahaja Yogis can
do it, of course you have to vibrate it.

01:41:27.683 --> 01:41:37.333
Vibrations doesn't need
any money. It's free .

01:41:37.333 --> 01:41:42.710
For Jaundice , Sahaja yogis should do one
more thing if they have that capability.

01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:48.367
Its easy, as Aradhana
said that oil pulls oil.

01:41:48.367 --> 01:41:52.800
During Jaundice its an emergency,

01:41:52.800 --> 01:42:01.877
Take Mustard oil (yellow oil) ,
take it in a bowl.

01:42:01.877 --> 01:42:08.543
Place 2 fingers  (Index and middle finger, the fingers of Vishudhi and Nabhi) Sahajayogi should rotate it in bronze bowl.

01:42:08.543 --> 01:42:11.767
Take oil in a little big bronze bowl.

01:42:11.767 --> 01:42:18.967
Nearly this much big bowl should
be so that finger can move freely in it.

01:42:18.967 --> 01:42:22.458
And likewise these two
fingers should be rotated

01:42:22.482 --> 01:42:24.900
means of Nabhi chakra and Vishuddhi chakra.

01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:28.238
So these two fingers
should be rotated likewise.

01:42:28.262 --> 01:42:33.333
If you feel can take this one also together.Swadhishthana finger.

01:42:33.457 --> 01:42:36.810
And ask that person (who got Jaundice)
to watch the movement of fingers.

01:42:36.810 --> 01:42:42.363
When Nabhi chakra and Swadishthan
chakra has problem Jaundice happens.

01:42:42.363 --> 01:42:48.400
Ask that person to watch it ,

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.067
the result of jaundice shows
up on your eyes, it becomes yellowish.

01:42:51.067 --> 01:42:57.733
You can see how swadishthan
and eyes are connected with each other.

01:42:57.733 --> 01:43:04.810
I will tell you more about it. As you move the
fingers in oil, oil will become thicker and thicker.

01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:10.350
You should not see in his eyes but ask him to
keep seeing the finger movements in the oil.

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:13.700
The oil gets foam now ,

01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:20.567
It irritates the eyes sometimes
but ask him to keep watching it.

01:43:20.568 --> 01:43:26.567
Then just go on moving your fingers.

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:30.673
It becomes thick foam now,
then it should be thrown it away.

01:43:30.673 --> 01:43:34.570
Repeat it next day, do it for 3 days.
3rd day Jaundice will be go away.

01:43:34.570 --> 01:43:40.500
This is how eyes become clear and
this is how two methods can be done.

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:42.623
Now about diabetes, I tell you.

01:43:42.623 --> 01:43:46.867
Diabetes is a very common disease now which is
going to increase, happens due to imbalance.

01:43:46.890 --> 01:43:51.333
Those who think too much,
plan too much diabetes happens to them.

01:43:51.333 --> 01:43:54.700
Diabetes happens due to pancreas,

01:43:54.700 --> 01:43:58.067
due to too much use of the right side.

01:43:58.067 --> 01:44:02.817
For that keep left hand
towards the photograph.

01:44:02.817 --> 01:44:08.197
Pancreas is here, below the
left rib cage, keep right hand on it.

01:44:08.197 --> 01:44:12.350
We can feel the pulsation on our hand
and left hand towards the photograph.

01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:20.257
If you are treating others, then left hand towards
the photo and right towards left rib cage (below).

01:44:20.257 --> 01:44:24.897
This is the work of swadishthan
chakra to supply to pancreas,

01:44:24.897 --> 01:44:29.333
There is always effect
of diabetes on eyes.

01:44:29.333 --> 01:44:35.533
You see how eyes are connected to
swadishthan chakra, we should remember this.

01:44:35.533 --> 01:44:46.967
At that time, we should raise Kundalini from left
side and put it on the right side , left to right.

01:44:46.967 --> 01:44:54.410
What happens when we put left to right, the ego which
comes up due to over activities of work, it comes down.

01:44:54.410 --> 01:44:59.933
If people have ego, of any higher position or if they
have something  then there is always a subtle ego.

01:44:59.933 --> 01:45:03.067
Sahaja yogis also have ego

01:45:03.067 --> 01:45:05.900
that we are so powerful etc..

01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:09.233
They should put left to right.

01:45:09.233 --> 01:45:14.833
Once it comes from left right then the  Kundalini
shakti should be awakened in the center.

01:45:14.833 --> 01:45:17.733
Vibration will start flowing.

01:45:17.733 --> 01:45:21.100
Left side is about love,

01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:25.357
when we do over activities,
our attention is not on love.

01:45:25.357 --> 01:45:28.533
That's why our love side from
left should be raised and put it on right.

01:45:28.533 --> 01:45:31.370
Putting left to right the balance comes.

01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:36.383
Women are different mostly,
now today's women are different.

01:45:36.383 --> 01:45:38.800
Their planning goes on since morning.

01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:44.467
As soon as they wake up in the morning, the plan
starts, which pickle should we make, which papad.

01:45:44.467 --> 01:45:47.533
They have to send kids to school,

01:45:47.533 --> 01:45:50.933
for them what , then which saree to wear.

01:45:50.933 --> 01:45:54.800
Now a days women need cosmetics,
and then matching blouse is there or not?

01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.557
then its planning.

01:45:56.557 --> 01:45:58.688
Then if they don't have then
from others they have to ask

01:45:58.712 --> 01:46:04.403
then go to tailor running around
and ask to make it by tomorrow etc..

01:46:04.403 --> 01:46:07.088
very subtle planning goes on of women.

01:46:07.112 --> 01:46:08.767
Even after doing this what is the result,

01:46:08.767 --> 01:46:11.517
can't be seen if standing
amongst some people.

01:46:11.517 --> 01:46:13.971
After running around
so much what's the use,

01:46:13.995 --> 01:46:17.567
the blouse is stiched can't
even be noticed.

01:46:17.567 --> 01:46:22.283
Hairs have to be like this
and so on , it has to be like this & that.

01:46:22.283 --> 01:46:26.433
If this is there it means
the right side is on.

01:46:26.433 --> 01:46:32.100
Now in morning the car
has to start at 9, means it has to happen.

01:46:32.100 --> 01:46:35.188
Wearing the watch , means gone.

01:46:35.212 --> 01:46:39.930
Everything is going to be on time,

01:46:39.930 --> 01:46:47.917
Mine is so much punctual that if I don't
reach, the aero plane will not take off.

01:46:47.917 --> 01:46:50.590
If i don't reach the car won't start.

01:46:50.590 --> 01:46:52.090
I am always on time(Tithi).

01:46:52.090 --> 01:46:54.771
Day before yesterday, in Rahuri ,

01:46:54.795 --> 01:46:57.488
they did Puja and Havan,

01:46:57.512 --> 01:47:00.333
it should be done on Navami( 9th day)
not on Ashtami (8th day) .

01:47:00.333 --> 01:47:04.250
Instead of 10, they kept it at 1 o clock.

01:47:04.250 --> 01:47:06.637
So I slept, let see.

01:47:06.637 --> 01:47:09.488
Of course after waking up, apologies

01:47:09.512 --> 01:47:15.183
why didn't you wake me up ( a kind of drama
or maya played by Param Pujya Shri Mataji).

01:47:15.183 --> 01:47:22.333
You should have woken me up and all that.

01:47:22.333 --> 01:47:29.367
Then sat and they got know
that Navami has just started.

01:47:29.367 --> 01:47:34.317
It ( Navami) started at
4.30 and it went very well, nothing wrong.

01:47:34.317 --> 01:47:37.837
Other day Mehtani came
and invited for lunch.

01:47:37.837 --> 01:47:44.390
On that day a visit to
a land was organized 10 miles away,

01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:54.467
after going there, reached at this showroom at 2.30.

01:47:54.467 --> 01:47:57.667
One should not be
slave of the watches.

01:47:57.667 --> 01:48:00.320
How much we hurt others due
to slavery of the watches we don't know.

01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:05.310
We think that we are organized
but it becomes very unorganized.

01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:07.557
It all happens on time for me.

01:48:07.557 --> 01:48:09.277
An interesting story,

01:48:09.277 --> 01:48:14.167
My husband( Sir CP), is very particular about
the time so during the wedding of elder daughter.

01:48:14.167 --> 01:48:17.403
I always play some tricks
and disturb their timings.

01:48:17.403 --> 01:48:21.100
He gets to know that
I have done something.

01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:22.597
Just an interesting
thing, of course its done with pure wisdom.

01:48:22.597 --> 01:48:27.197
You are all sahajayogis so there
is no harm in telling you.

01:48:27.197 --> 01:48:30.283
In wedding , he took everyone for the task.

01:48:30.283 --> 01:48:33.633
They (groom's side people) all came from
Lucknow , they all were highly relaxed.

01:48:33.633 --> 01:48:37.833
Like morning 6am they should
take bath and 7 am should finish breakfast.

01:48:37.833 --> 01:48:41.567
Despite we being (bride's side),
were very strict with them.

01:48:41.567 --> 01:48:43.867
What is this going on,

01:48:43.867 --> 01:48:46.300
they were saying that we have
to finish in one day.

01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:49.227
They want to go in one day, let it be but what is
this going on ( regarding the strictness of time).

01:48:49.227 --> 01:48:53.800
They also came to Mumbai so they were all
put under strict discipline of the time.

01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:57.233
It was over strictness (by Sir C.P).

01:48:57.233 --> 01:48:59.988
There is a tradition in UP that

01:49:00.012 --> 01:49:03.955
when Groom enters the door
, the bride has to put a garland

01:49:03.979 --> 01:49:04.950
like a swayamvar ( Bride
accepting the groom).

01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:09.470
Without her acceptance the
marriage doesn't take place.

01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:11.370
It's a good tradition.

01:49:11.370 --> 01:49:13.633
Girl should garland the Groom.

01:49:13.633 --> 01:49:16.067
This was all set as per time.

01:49:16.067 --> 01:49:19.385
Bride should come at that
time and all that.

01:49:19.409 --> 01:49:21.467
The groom should be on stage.

01:49:21.467 --> 01:49:23.821
It should be on time ,

01:49:23.845 --> 01:49:26.640
groom is welcomed at the door and
puja of the groom is done and all that.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.391
Then he should come inside,

01:49:28.415 --> 01:49:30.321
it all started from here after.

01:49:30.345 --> 01:49:35.003
But instead of coming inside
he was lost somewhere.

01:49:35.003 --> 01:49:40.010
Something happened then, bride started
with the garland, where is the groom.

01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:43.523
Everyone got surprised that where
Groom run away? Where is the groom?

01:49:43.567 --> 01:49:49.463
What should we do now? Fifteen minutes there
was no clue of the groom. I was laughing..

01:49:49.503 --> 01:49:51.983
Saheb ( Sir CP) came and told me,
you have done something !

01:49:51.983 --> 01:49:55.170
Sir CP said It is very clear that you should have
done something, some chakra's movement and all that.

01:49:55.170 --> 01:49:58.303
I said you were going so fast so
I thought you must take it easy.

01:49:58.303 --> 01:50:00.557
Sir CP asked Where is the groom, I said
he must be there somewhere upstairs or so.

01:50:00.557 --> 01:50:07.000
Groom was so strained that
he had to go to bathroom,

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.767
Rather than coming here he
directly went upstairs.

01:50:11.767 --> 01:50:19.533
First time he was wearing a chudidar ( a
tight payjama) , so it was difficult to open.

01:50:19.533 --> 01:50:26.233
When Sir CP went up, people were helping him.

01:50:26.233 --> 01:50:32.690
Like this all chaos happened.

01:50:32.690 --> 01:50:37.983
Then groom came and all went
well after that as per schedule.

01:50:37.983 --> 01:50:43.033
You will be surprised that Jaymala ( exchange of garlands)
happened on time as per muhurt (auspicious time).

01:50:43.033 --> 01:50:46.390
On this muhurt ( a specific auspicious time)
so many interesting things have happened.

01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:53.633
This Muhurt is also within us only,
not something outside.

01:50:53.633 --> 01:50:59.263
Day before yesterday, there was one,
we have some brahmins they are so perfect.

01:50:59.263 --> 01:51:06.977
I really appreciate them, they
have really put this Brahminism on place.

01:51:06.977 --> 01:51:12.588
We have one brahman his name is Phadke,

01:51:12.612 --> 01:51:15.417
he has done all these studies
(about the auspicious time and all that).

01:51:15.417 --> 01:51:21.137
He knows everything, he knows
Sahaja yoga is a true thing & all that.

01:51:21.137 --> 01:51:24.867
He has one Shradhh ( a kind of ritual which is
performed when someone is dead in their house).

01:51:24.867 --> 01:51:28.018
He asked one Brahman to come to his
house to perform the ritual of Shradhh

01:51:28.042 --> 01:51:29.897
and asked him when can he come.

01:51:29.897 --> 01:51:40.091
Now the other brahman who has to
go to many places for Shraddh food so

01:51:40.115 --> 01:51:50.083
he told one particular day
as per his convenience.

01:51:50.083 --> 01:51:54.333
Then he came back to home and took out his calender.

01:51:54.333 --> 01:51:56.588
Phadke saw his calendar and found that
there is no auspicious time on that day

01:51:56.612 --> 01:52:00.433
rather it was not a good day.

01:52:00.433 --> 01:52:06.937
Then the other brahman reached on that day after nicely fasting so that he can eat more (at Phadke's house).

01:52:06.937 --> 01:52:12.267
Phadke asked to him according to which panchang
( a book or calendar where people refer the auspicious time) you found this time.

01:52:12.267 --> 01:52:15.321
He said some thing , phadke
said this is not a right day or time.

01:52:15.345 --> 01:52:16.863
He was disturebed a little.

01:52:16.863 --> 01:52:22.133
Phadke showed him the panchang and
said today cannot do there is no auspicious time today.

01:52:22.133 --> 01:52:26.550
Then why did you come to have food at
my place today and why did you speak lie?

01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:29.467
Now I will not serve you food,

01:52:29.467 --> 01:52:32.980
You have come as guest so
have a cup of tea and go.

01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:34.673
I will not serve food to you.

01:52:34.673 --> 01:52:37.800
And I will perform the Shraddh
ritual myself and on time.

01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:41.240
I( Phadke said)  am capable of doing
it and his wife said what are you doing?

01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:44.388
He said nothing doing, he is doing
falsehood and he is false person

01:52:44.412 --> 01:52:47.133
and only came for food. Ask him to go back.

01:52:47.133 --> 01:52:51.375
His mother also said and they all agreed
then Phadke did it himself.

01:52:51.399 --> 01:52:56.421
His studies are so deep that
he has done so much of research

01:52:56.445 --> 01:53:00.800
that I (Shri Mataji) told
him to write down all this.

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:03.833
He even could tell when does the crow will touch the food ( Its a tradition that the food of Shraddh has to be touched by the crow).

01:53:03.833 --> 01:53:10.167
On vibrations he could say that whether is
father's soul is there or not and all that,

01:53:10.167 --> 01:53:14.067
very subtle level he found out.
Its worth appreciating,

01:53:14.067 --> 01:53:16.947
If he writes all, this
would be a good thing.

01:53:16.947 --> 01:53:20.233
So that everyone would know that
those who are not realized ,

01:53:20.233 --> 01:53:22.331
how do they all do the religious rituals

01:53:22.355 --> 01:53:26.433
but it doesn't have benefit
because they don't know anything.

01:53:26.434 --> 01:53:30.800
They just speak but they
don't know anything.

01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:33.290
They don't understand any
auspiciousness or inauspiciousness.

01:53:33.290 --> 01:53:37.047
Until they stand on
truth, it doesn't work out.

01:53:37.047 --> 01:53:40.267
There is story of Shahpe,
punishment of Shahpe.

01:53:40.267 --> 01:53:44.767
There was a man called Shahpe,

01:53:44.767 --> 01:53:50.667
he went & told a king that he is a big
architect by showing wrong certificates.

01:53:50.667 --> 01:53:56.037
The king agreed and appointed
him as Architect.

01:53:56.037 --> 01:53:58.733
King said now you build a new township,

01:53:58.733 --> 01:54:02.133
gave him lot money and that land.

01:54:02.133 --> 01:54:05.185
After 2 years King enquired then

01:54:05.209 --> 01:54:07.097
he said yes its ready , you
can come & have a look at it.

01:54:07.097 --> 01:54:11.190
He just spent all money on his own enjoyment.

02:05:49.642 --> 01:54:11.257
He didn't do anything.

01:54:11.290 --> 01:54:14.863
When King visited the place and looked
around, there was nothing on the land.

01:54:14.890 --> 01:54:16.597
King asked what is this?

01:54:16.597 --> 01:54:21.200
The architect said yes it is there , you
can't see it, it requires an eye to see.

01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.155
You don't have inner eyes,

01:54:23.179 --> 01:54:25.377
then king said is it so?

01:54:25.377 --> 01:54:29.657
Architect said, look at this,
it is your courtyard, this is your throne.

01:54:29.657 --> 01:54:31.757
You have to sit on this throne & all that.

01:54:31.757 --> 01:54:35.300
All only words no real thing.

01:54:35.333 --> 01:54:36.821
Now King is after all King,

01:54:36.845 --> 01:54:39.833
he said ok you seems to be very clever.

01:54:39.833 --> 01:54:43.011
King said good that you
really did a good work,

01:54:43.035 --> 01:54:46.833
I am very pleased.

01:54:46.833 --> 01:54:50.255
Now in this situation I
grant you one thing,

01:54:50.279 --> 01:54:53.167
you sit on my throne now.

01:54:53.167 --> 01:54:59.500
Now you sit , why don't
you sit, I will honor you.

01:54:59.500 --> 01:55:01.590
In such situation King asked
the so called fraud architect to sit on it.

01:55:01.590 --> 01:55:04.763
He has to sit. There was
no throne nothing.

01:55:04.763 --> 01:55:08.650
Don't get up now, sit here only.

01:55:08.650 --> 01:55:12.467
We will give you food and all will do here only.

01:55:12.467 --> 01:55:15.661
After 4-5 hours he got scared

01:55:15.685 --> 01:55:19.833
then the architect accepted
that this was all falsehood.

01:55:19.833 --> 01:55:24.867
This punishment of Shahpe is going
to happen to all false people.

01:55:24.867 --> 01:55:27.223
That's why You all should stand on truth.

01:55:27.223 --> 01:55:31.337
There is so much of
truth in all the religions,

01:55:31.337 --> 01:55:33.090
don't make it unrighteousness of it.

01:55:33.090 --> 01:55:36.433
For earnings, unrighteousness
should not be done.

01:55:36.433 --> 01:55:39.700
This thing should be kept in mind.

01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:47.000
Now last thing that I have to
tell to the sahaja yogis,

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:53.043
that those saints who are not there now, their examples people accepts.

01:55:53.043 --> 01:55:57.210
For example people accepts what Gyaneshwara
has said but not what I am saying now

01:55:57.210 --> 01:56:00.157
because I am living now.

01:56:00.157 --> 01:56:07.967
Its very sad that when the
person is living , people do not accept.

01:56:07.967 --> 01:56:12.650
At that time people will trouble
him but after the death they will do puja.

01:56:12.650 --> 01:56:16.600
Reason is, he is now in our hand, after
the death of the saint what, that's true.

01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:17.681
In the temple of Gyaneshwara,

01:56:17.705 --> 01:56:22.400
they said to me, you do that Lezim (
a kind of folk dance of Maharashtra),

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:25.821
I didn't understand why is that so here..

01:56:25.845 --> 01:56:36.833
( some discussion among the sahaja yogis about
whether it is Lezim or Dindi means a procession).

01:56:36.833 --> 01:56:53.600
Shri Mataji says there is a word for it
..forgotten.. yes it is Dindya means procession.

01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:57.655
Shri Mataji asked has Gyaneshwara did
this?

01:56:57.679 --> 01:57:01.133
Did he danced on Lezim or procession?

01:57:01.133 --> 01:57:04.600
So those people said he is
Gyaneshwara.. who are you?

01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:09.690
he did manan ( means introspection) they
said we should not do manan ( introspection).

01:57:09.690 --> 01:57:11.667
Did he say like this?

01:57:11.667 --> 01:57:16.273
They have made so big temples of Saint
Gyaneshwara and they are going there.

01:57:16.273 --> 01:57:18.480
Please don't do the same
thing with me ( Shri Mataji).

01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:21.800
What ever it's there , I have already told you.

01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:23.213
Whatever is prohibited is prohibited

01:57:23.213 --> 01:57:26.900
and whatever is to be accepted
to be accepted, no compromise at all.

01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:30.133
Check on vibrations,

01:57:30.133 --> 01:57:35.560
the other day I told that people
go to Ram Krishna ashram,

01:57:35.560 --> 01:57:40.400
Some people came here I asked what
did you get there? some philanthropic work,

01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:45.400
means distribution of food to poor
& all that like missionaries work.

01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:50.833
Have you heard of such work that
distribution of food is the work of God?

01:57:50.834 --> 01:57:55.533
Started food distribution for poor
people. It's not God's work.

01:57:55.533 --> 01:57:58.677
God almighty is like Laxmi swaroop ,
in the form of Laxmi.

01:57:58.677 --> 01:58:00.937
He will fill you with Laxmi
not distributing the food.

01:58:00.937 --> 01:58:03.767
This is the expression of ego,

01:58:03.767 --> 01:58:05.945
Now as soon as I said like this,

01:58:05.969 --> 01:58:09.850
one gentleman was not happy with it
and asked me why do you criticize them.

01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:11.863
I told him , I am not criticizing them

01:58:11.863 --> 01:58:13.323
but they have criticized themselves.

01:58:13.323 --> 01:58:17.867
These people who have started
this food distribution buisness ,

01:58:17.867 --> 01:58:20.988
even Vivekanand didn't do this,

01:58:21.012 --> 01:58:23.183
not even his guru did it like this.

01:58:23.183 --> 01:58:30.200
Only by distributing food they are trying to gain
the name, they don't earn anything of their own.

01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:33.600
Someone gives them food and
these people only just distribute it.

01:58:33.693 --> 01:58:36.567
Some one has to give them money and
they just distribute like a middleman.

01:58:36.587 --> 01:58:41.100
They are like middleman we appoint
like cheff or someone like that.

01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:46.633
Donating that thing which
doesn't belong to us.

01:58:46.633 --> 01:58:59.667
Such people will always ask "Why
Mataji has criticized those people?"

01:58:59.667 --> 01:59:01.267
Why she said like this?

01:59:01.267 --> 01:59:13.433
Now I am not contesting any election to say
all good things for each and every person.

01:59:13.433 --> 01:59:16.821
Whatever is correct I
will say it's correct that

01:59:16.845 --> 01:59:20.900
and whatever is wrong
I will say it's wrong.

01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:24.188
Now there some gurus who are realized

01:59:24.212 --> 01:59:27.733
I have to say that they are realized,

01:59:27.733 --> 01:59:31.088
but those who are not realized
how can I say that they are realized

01:59:31.112 --> 01:59:33.270
& why should I say like that.

01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:35.700
Is it because you will feel bad.

01:59:35.700 --> 01:59:38.540
I will not say indirectly that time but will tell it slowly &
directly.

01:59:38.540 --> 01:59:41.047
Now there is one more gentleman from
Nagar ( Now known as Ahilyanagar),

01:59:41.047 --> 01:59:46.473
He had a photograph of a
false guru,very bad person.

01:59:46.513 --> 01:59:48.062
He destroyed the Kundalini so badly.

01:59:48.086 --> 01:59:51.033
In your Pune he was very famous.

01:59:51.033 --> 01:59:54.821
He destroyed the Kundalini so
badly that Kundalini used to fall down

01:59:54.845 --> 01:59:58.133
and it was a great difficulty for me.

01:59:58.133 --> 02:00:01.143
Later on I got to know that this is that false guru.

02:00:01.143 --> 02:00:03.243
When I came to Mumbai, I went to meet him.

02:00:03.243 --> 02:00:05.700
Went to visit all, tried to
make all of them understand.

02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:11.367
Now went to meet them so they
started saying she is our disciple,

02:00:11.367 --> 02:00:12.867
What should I say , such stupid people.

02:00:12.867 --> 02:00:17.500
When I went there, they asked me to
wait because he is now taking bath.

02:00:17.500 --> 02:00:24.167
Took one & half hour
for bath , is he so dirty.

02:00:24.167 --> 02:00:27.170
One & half hour bath and

02:00:27.170 --> 02:00:30.483
now he is in Mauna ( Means silence,
wont speak to anyone) won't look at anyone.

02:00:30.483 --> 02:00:35.230
So when is he going to meet?

02:00:35.230 --> 02:00:40.300
Later on they all came,
all wet and those with him also were wet.

02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:43.085
Then went upstairs
for their lunch.

02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:45.800
It was also a big show.

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:49.583
Others seems to be
quite poor people ,

02:00:49.583 --> 02:00:53.250
Somehow they would have arranged
some money and made that arrangements.

02:00:53.274 --> 02:00:56.637
and this ascetic why he need
such a big event of food?

02:00:56.683 --> 02:01:00.267
Then he sat for lunch,
took 2 hours for lunch.

02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:04.180
What is this going
on, like this it took 4 hours..

02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:06.833
Shri Mataji said what
kind of a sanyasi he is,

02:01:06.833 --> 02:01:12.533
I don't think he will understand anything. Nothing
will go in his mind, finally I left the place.

02:01:12.533 --> 02:01:18.157
He calls himself Sanyasi and how is he sitting
and having food on someone else expenses.

02:01:18.157 --> 02:01:22.900
All the expenses, that
person has done it for him.

02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:26.637
He got Pneumonia next day then he
came to me because he was all wet.

02:01:26.637 --> 02:01:31.300
Food had to be cooked wearing wet clothes ,
all those brahmin's(priest) got cough.

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:34.655
What is the need of asking that person
to prepare food after wearing wet clothes,

02:01:34.679 --> 02:01:37.600
what's wrong they did?

02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:43.767
If he ( the false guru) is so pure
then why is he so scared of anything.

02:01:43.767 --> 02:01:54.800
You all know I am so pure
that nothing touches me.

02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:56.837
That's a simple thing.

02:01:56.837 --> 02:02:01.290
There is one more lady,
if anyone touches her, she falls down.

02:02:01.290 --> 02:02:05.133
Is she a Rakshas or what that
short circuit is happening.

02:02:05.133 --> 02:02:08.200
Fuse blows out of them.

02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:10.867
You are purer than them,

02:02:10.867 --> 02:02:15.900
Now if I say like this, you say
Mataji you are criticizing them.

02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:20.333
What I say (about Sahaja yogis) is that they are
disciples, this is their wealth of many lives,

02:02:20.333 --> 02:02:24.000
their Kundalini, which
they have got now.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.171
Those who don't know anything about the
Kundalini write books,

02:02:28.195 --> 02:02:29.620
unauthorized gesture.

02:02:29.620 --> 02:02:32.130
and then peoples Kundalini gets
spoilt due to that reading.

02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:38.870
Later give them some diksha,

02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:42.870
give them some knowledge with some (metal or letter or leaf).

02:02:42.883 --> 02:02:50.067
Through (metal or letter or leaf) can
they sprout a seed.

02:02:50.067 --> 02:02:52.733
With mudras they will give,

02:02:52.733 --> 02:02:55.833
How is it possible to raise Kunalini
with patra (metal or leaf or letter)?

02:02:55.834 --> 02:02:58.833
What is the relationship between Patra
(Metal or letter or leaf) and Kundalini?

02:02:58.833 --> 02:03:01.667
What they give with patra
(metal or leaf or letter) are bhoots.

02:03:01.667 --> 02:03:07.167
The difference is, in England also they do but
they say that they are putting spirits inside.

02:03:07.167 --> 02:03:11.967
Here they call it Kundalini.

02:03:11.967 --> 02:03:16.457
In the name of God , doing the
work of Bhoots in the name of God.

02:03:16.457 --> 02:03:21.090
This is Kaliyuga, similarly Rakshasas
call themselves as Guru this is Kaliyuga.

02:03:21.090 --> 02:03:23.733
Now lets say someone calls
himself as Ravana

02:03:23.733 --> 02:03:25.303
then will anyone allow him to stay.

02:03:25.303 --> 02:03:26.990
That's why they say I am God,

02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:32.357
what's required to say like, does it require anything
to say like. but you can see their symptoms.

02:03:32.357 --> 02:03:41.370
But recognize their qualities.

02:03:41.370 --> 02:03:47.683
If you stay with such people for 10 days
, you will get to know that he is Butcher

02:03:47.683 --> 02:03:50.083
That he is a evil person

02:03:50.083 --> 02:03:53.583
but he will hypnotize to that
level that no one can see his qualities.

02:03:53.583 --> 02:03:58.350
Its hypnosis, that's why you can't
see it that he is a bad person,

02:03:58.350 --> 02:04:02.437
But you will know that he is evil person he is crooking

02:04:02.437 --> 02:04:04.290
but due to hypnosis you can't see it.

02:04:04.290 --> 02:04:07.467
Agya chakra gets caught up.

02:04:07.467 --> 02:04:09.527
Now there is a lady with us,

02:04:09.527 --> 02:04:14.800
she told us that there was a guru and
his disciple  came and she helped us alot ,

02:04:14.824 --> 02:04:17.267
and she told us likewise ...

02:04:17.267 --> 02:04:19.431
I said first of all she is the
disciple of that (false guru)

02:04:19.455 --> 02:04:22.367
and this person crook no.1

02:04:22.367 --> 02:04:26.367
and on top if she is his disciple
( another lady), what will be her level.

02:04:26.367 --> 02:04:29.303
And then you listen to her , why so.

02:04:29.303 --> 02:04:33.200
Means Agya is caught up,
you are under hypnosis.

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:35.793
You can see everything but
still you can't see anything.

02:04:35.793 --> 02:04:40.473
You get into such a
bondage under their hypnosis.

02:04:40.473 --> 02:04:42.867
If you have seen any
program of hypnosis,

02:04:42.867 --> 02:04:45.767
many people do it like Sarkar etc.

02:04:45.767 --> 02:04:50.967
If someone is hypnotized to become a small child
then you will start drinking milk with the bottle.

02:04:50.987 --> 02:04:53.300
Anything you will do,

02:04:53.313 --> 02:04:54.830
forcefully you will do it.

02:04:54.863 --> 02:04:56.397
Even if you don't like it,
still it happens.

02:04:56.397 --> 02:04:57.900
This is hypnosis,

02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:59.667
That's why you should understand that

02:04:59.667 --> 02:05:03.523
if Shri Mataji is saying something
is wrong then it must be wrong.

02:05:03.523 --> 02:05:07.125
Why should I say like this, if I say
remove this locket or thread

02:05:07.149 --> 02:05:07.870
then what's my gain.

02:05:07.870 --> 02:05:10.767
Am I going to sell it again?

02:05:10.767 --> 02:05:16.200
Why Shri Mataji is saying so,
that should be understood.

02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:21.367
When such people say leave
that, you want your Kundalini awakening.

02:05:21.367 --> 02:05:23.300
Shri Mataji doesn't need anything from you,

02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:25.533
then if Shri Mataji says so then why
don't you follow that.

02:05:25.533 --> 02:05:27.733
People get upset with small small things ,

02:05:27.733 --> 02:05:31.111
that time Sahaja yogis should remember that

02:05:31.135 --> 02:05:35.543
If some one says Shri Mataji has said something
bad about someone then they must be.

02:05:35.543 --> 02:05:37.105
Don't need to doubt about it.

02:05:37.129 --> 02:05:39.303
Because we have tested everything.

02:05:39.303 --> 02:05:43.017
I was telling you about them when I went to Nagar,
he had that photograph ( Of that false Guru).

02:05:43.017 --> 02:05:46.733
Immediately I said, I want to
sleep in inner room.

02:05:46.733 --> 02:05:47.792
He didn't understand,

02:05:47.816 --> 02:05:49.617
he said please sleep here only. Shri
Mataji said no I want to sleep inside.

02:05:49.617 --> 02:05:51.700
He also was unable to understand
why Mataji insisted so much?

02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:53.233
He said,it's not alright there
please sleep here only.

02:05:53.234 --> 02:05:57.200
I said No no I will sleep inside only.

02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:59.315
I went inside by taking reason

02:05:59.339 --> 02:06:01.801
and took that photograph
and told him to remove it.

02:06:01.825 --> 02:06:05.600
You don't have courage to do
so remove it since I am telling you.

02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:08.055
I can understand that.

02:06:08.079 --> 02:06:11.457
They don't have courage to remove it, they feel
afraid of removing the photographs ( of false gurus).

02:06:11.457 --> 02:06:14.350
They know that the person has
ruined them but still they are afraid of.

02:06:14.350 --> 02:06:17.788
Remove them , I will beat
them with shoes in front of you.

02:06:17.812 --> 02:06:20.567
Bring them, let's see
what will he do?

02:06:20.567 --> 02:06:23.418
Because of fear the person
doesn't leave them.

02:06:23.442 --> 02:06:25.097
There is no freedom.

02:06:25.097 --> 02:06:29.000
If some one says then
you should say with confidence

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:33.321
that we have tested all that he
(their false guru) is a wrong person

02:06:33.345 --> 02:06:34.000
then his bhoots will also run away.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:37.100
There is no doubt about it.
I have verified everything.

02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:40.507
If you say this confidently then
that person can be freed from that guru.

02:06:40.507 --> 02:06:43.633
That's why many a times its necessary we
have to say like this ( about false gurus).

02:06:43.633 --> 02:06:45.585
That's why I say this
to all sahaja yogis

02:06:45.609 --> 02:06:49.200
that whatever I have told about
something wrong that means it is wrong.

02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:50.851
It is absolutely wrong

02:06:50.875 --> 02:06:58.500
and it has to be told about the same
without any compromise.

02:06:58.525 --> 02:07:08.825
Hope you spent good amount of time today,
now lets get the darshan(Auspicious sight of deity or holy person).
