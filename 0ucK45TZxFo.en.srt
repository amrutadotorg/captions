1
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:39,839
I have been telling them that

2
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:44,496
 the style of Indian knowledge

3
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:47,749
 is very different from the Western mind.

4
00:27:48,321 --> 00:27:51,720
In the West, you see, if you say something,

5
00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:56,661
then they want to have an experimental approval.

6
00:27:56,878 --> 00:28:02,972
They will go to the scientists or to other
people who are equipped

7
00:28:02,997 --> 00:28:08,120
with knowledge to know what they said
in these books is true or not.

8
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,917
They will even judge Christ.

9
00:28:09,942 --> 00:28:13,513
They would even judge Moses.

10
00:28:13,538 --> 00:28:15,290
They would judge everybody

11
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:20,340
as if they are the most intelligent
and the most capable people.

12
00:28:21,236 --> 00:28:24,687
And they write books after books against them

13
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:31,489
disclosing as if they are those people
who have said something,

14
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:35,120
have said out of their
minds or something.

15
00:28:35,932 --> 00:28:40,337
It is never accepted normally

16
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:44,578
and if it is accepted they become absolutely fanatics.

17
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:51,326
So, now according to Indian style of

18
00:28:51,874 --> 00:28:57,480
understanding is that first of all if a great Rishi

19
00:28:57,505 --> 00:28:59,914
 or great Muni or a great...

20
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,601
you can call a saint has
said something,

21
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,921
then he has said it, while you have to just listen to that

22
00:29:11,254 --> 00:29:14,031
 because you are not equally the same.

23
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:20,401
Whatever he has said is his own experience,
his own knowledge

24
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:24,764
 and you have no business to judge him or to say

25
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:29,166
 this is not true, that is not true.

26
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:32,259
You accept it

27
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,435
and once you get your self-realization,
it is clearly written down

28
00:29:38,062 --> 00:29:41,336
after self-realization,
you have to grow.

29
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:47,976
Grow into perfect being and then you can see
for yourself

30
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:52,942
what he has said or they have said is the truth.

31
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:56,032
So the approach is different.

32
00:29:56,219 --> 00:29:59,886
In one way if you start going through science,

33
00:29:59,974 --> 00:30:03,872
through this, through that, you cannot reach anywhere

34
00:30:03,897 --> 00:30:06,746
 and moreover your growth is stunted.

35
00:30:07,035 --> 00:30:12,598
So, what you have to do is to go to this knowledge

36
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:16,612
through believing in what they have said.

37
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:19,637
Whatever Christ has said, you have to believe,

38
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:23,176
whatever Mohammad has said, you have to believe,

39
00:30:23,569 --> 00:30:27,034
whatever Guru Nanak has said,
you have to believe,

40
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:31,536
whatever Gyandeva has said, you have to believe,

41
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:33,898
Lao Tse you have to believe: like that.

42
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:38,630
Because you are not of that spiritual level.

43
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:40,832
So accept it.

44
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,078
Now do not try to analyze it.
Everything you try to analyze

45
00:30:45,149 --> 00:30:48,200
and in that analysis you get lost.

46
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:54,223
So once you are a realized soul of that level

47
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,477
and then you grow into your fullness

48
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,945
what we call sampurna --

49
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:06,180
 then only you will know whether whatever they have

50
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:10,312
said is true or not and then you can find out.

51
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:15,964
It is very easy, then, to know whatever is
said is true or not.

52
00:31:17,525 --> 00:31:23,311
For Sahaja Yogis now is very easy to find
out if something is real or unreal,

53
00:31:23,336 --> 00:31:27,711
if it is truth or untruth, it is love or hatred.

54
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,625
Only through vibrations you can do.

55
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:34,061
But going beyond that, I am saying,

56
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:38,684
 beyond that one has to know
what are these vibrations

57
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:43,111
and what are they made of.

58
00:31:57,479 --> 00:32:03,116
What is the subtle force which is
behind those vibrations.

59
00:32:03,783 --> 00:32:07,605
We call it Paramchaitanya, alright.
Paramchaitanya, so what.

60
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:12,579
What happens to you when you get Paramchaitanya,

61
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:16,008
is something to be understood, the subtleties.

62
00:32:16,596 --> 00:32:22,095
As I said, we are made of five elements, alright?

63
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:25,902
So when you get your awakening,
when the Kundalini reaches

64
00:32:25,927 --> 00:32:29,517
Sahasrara and opens out your fontanel bone area,

65
00:32:29,542 --> 00:32:37,807
 you become one with the Divine power,
then this Divine power itself starts flowing through you.

66
00:32:38,676 --> 00:32:41,245
A connection is established.

67
00:32:41,765 --> 00:32:47,620
Now when it starts flowing through you, this
Shakti starts flowing through you,

68
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:51,386
 then what happens?

69
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,782
The subtle part we should understand.

70
00:32:56,025 --> 00:33:02,788
The subtle part is like this, that these five
elements, we are made of,

71
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:07,421
 these vibrations gradually start breaking into

72
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:11,683
 the subtler form of which they are made.

73
00:33:12,101 --> 00:33:17,698
So the first thing such a person has
 is the breaks, you see,

74
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:22,142
as it is said that "Word is God."

75
00:33:23,015 --> 00:33:26,183
It's said also in the Bible, "The Word is God."

76
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:28,256
Now what is this Word?

77
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:36,878
Word is a silent, we can say, silent commandment.

78
00:33:37,076 --> 00:33:39,045
We can call it like that.

79
00:33:39,207 --> 00:33:43,719
But from that Word comes,
according to Indian Philosophy,

80
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:47,830
is another thing that we call as "Bindu"...

81
00:33:52,915 --> 00:33:57,491
 or we can say if Word becomes
Naad, is a sound...

82
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:06,843
and then it becomes the Bindu means
 one small dot, you can see

83
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,979
 and then from this dot...

84
00:34:10,209 --> 00:34:15,595
you see, all these five elements
 start coming one after another.

85
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:21,879
The first element that comes out is light...

86
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:29,202
"Tej" light ... is the first element that comes out.

87
00:34:29,578 --> 00:34:34,591
So the essence of the first element is light.

88
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:40,335
We call it Tej, Tejas.

89
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,697
It is written, of course, in Sanskrit but we should understand

90
00:34:45,087 --> 00:34:50,488
that how the light pervades Sahaja Yoga so much

91
00:34:50,615 --> 00:34:53,713
and you see the light everywhere.

92
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:58,904
So the first element which is light

93
00:34:58,985 --> 00:35:08,055
 and you can say in English the light's subtle thing

94
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:15,348
is, we can say, "enlightenment", you can say.

95
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:22,067
But enlightenment has another meaning, so
we can say it is Tej, Tej.

96
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:27,036
For example a person who gets realization has a face

97
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:31,372
which is very radiant, so you can say the "radiance".

98
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:37,007
The radiance is the subtlety of the light.

99
00:35:37,077 --> 00:35:40,931
So this radiance starts showing on your face.

100
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:44,572
Radiance starts expressing itself

101
00:35:44,604 --> 00:35:50,410
and with that radiance people get impressed

102
00:35:50,435 --> 00:35:56,889
and they start thinking something special about
 this personality which has a radiance.

103
00:35:56,914 --> 00:36:01,034
Now you have seen my photographs also wherever they are,

104
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,423
many a times you find lots of light around.

105
00:36:04,448 --> 00:36:12,772
That is nothing but the light in me is giving radiance

106
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:15,499
because the light becomes subtler.

107
00:36:15,784 --> 00:36:19,195
When the light becomes subtle in me, -- light,

108
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:24,292
light is one of the elements -- when it becomes subtler

109
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:33,853
 then it gives radiance and so this is the
 subtle growth within you that takes place.

110
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:36,818
Your faces also start shining.

111
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:45,819
They too have radiance and they too have a
kind of a different complexion, I would say.

112
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:54,035
This radiance is to be understood, is the subtle of the light

113
00:36:54,365 --> 00:36:58,780
of which we are made, light in the gross manner.

114
00:36:59,549 --> 00:37:05,477
Then after this from the light comes the second thing,

115
00:37:05,502 --> 00:37:10,892
which we call as Vayu in Sanskrit, meaning the air.

116
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:15,909
So the air that we have which is gross air,

117
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:20,862
what is subtle of air is the "cool breeze" that you get.

118
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:25,419
The cool breeze is the subtle of that air.

119
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:32,863
So the subtle of what you understand as cool breeze is

120
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:38,796
what we call vibrations, the subtle of that is air;

121
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:42,770
 which is a part and parcel of our making.

122
00:37:42,876 --> 00:37:50,919
So this cool breeze is the second thing that
you start getting subtler and subtler.

123
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:57,616
When your growth takes place, all these subtle
things start expressing themselves.

124
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:02,203
It is not only that you get vibrations
 but you get the cool breeze

125
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:07,291
and that is the subtler of air that has built you up.

126
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:13,148
Then comes the Water.

127
00:38:13,703 --> 00:38:16,159
We are also made of water.

128
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:21,306
What is the subtle of water is...

129
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,739
sometimes English language,
you know, becomes little short of...

130
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:34,897
 especially but they call it...

131
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:41,464
I mean which makes the skin, hard skin soft.

132
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:45,427
The skin becomes soft.

133
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:54,050
This is another sign of a realized soul that his...

134
00:38:55,884 --> 00:39:00,310
there is some cream they use, isn't it, to soften the face.

135
00:39:00,967 --> 00:39:11,027
But this is the water in us, gives us that
luster, that nourishment to make our skin

136
00:39:11,396 --> 00:39:16,137
very soft and that softness
of the skin becomes very visible.

137
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:19,460
This is the minimum of minimum, I would say.

138
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:28,162
But then a person who is a realized soul becomes
very soft person, very delicate.

139
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:39,120
When he talks to some body, in his voice there
is warmth or I should say there is...

140
00:39:39,145 --> 00:39:50,610
[Mother speeks Hindi]... to have that flow,
watery flow and coolness of the water.

141
00:39:50,761 --> 00:39:57,871
So that is the another subtle thing that should
be expressed in your behavior, on your skin,

142
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:06,117
on your dealings with others, that you should
be like the water, which is mobile,

143
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,365
which is cooling, which is soothing, which is cleansing.

144
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:19,722
So this also becomes a part and parcel of
your being, once you become a realized soul.

145
00:40:20,573 --> 00:40:27,334
With this water you have also another thing
which we call it as Agni, means the fire.

146
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:32,186
So you also have fire but it is a very silent fire.

147
00:40:32,211 --> 00:40:37,201
It does not burn anybody but it burns all
the wrong things within you.

148
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,762
Whatever wrong things you have it burns

149
00:40:39,787 --> 00:40:42,837
and it burns the wrong things in other people also.

150
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:47,272
For example, a person comes
with a great anger towards me.

151
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:55,109
What happens that this anger becomes cooldown
with the fire that is there.

152
00:40:55,396 --> 00:41:00,371
Moreover, a realized soul cannot get burnt,

153
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:06,313
fire cannot burn, the burning cannot come to him.

154
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,958
It is very important to understand.

155
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:13,209
Also if you are doing something wrong,

156
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:17,936
it may burn you but if you are a good Sahaja Yogi

157
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:23,131
 and I should say, perfect Sahaja Yogi,
fire will never burn you.

158
00:41:23,593 --> 00:41:30,241
We have an example of Sita Ji that she went
into the fire Pariksha... nothing burnt.

159
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:36,938
So this is what one has to understand, that
once you get to the subtleties of the fire,

160
00:41:37,088 --> 00:41:44,556
so the fire and the water both of them
become sort of Divine.

161
00:41:44,866 --> 00:41:48,852
For example, the water which you touch,

162
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:54,781
 water you drink, whatever you put
your hand in the water,

163
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:56,949
the water becomes vibrated.

164
00:41:56,974 --> 00:41:57,974
Means What?

165
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:02,691
The subtleties of the water comes in it, the coolness,

166
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:07,280
curing power also comes in that water.

167
00:42:07,495 --> 00:42:11,986
So when it becomes subtler,
all these powers start showing

168
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:16,291
which you can see for yourself.
You do not have to experiment.

169
00:42:18,585 --> 00:42:25,256
Then the lastly is the Mother Earth... is
most important... is Mother Earth.

170
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:30,825
There is a photograph you might see which
was taken in Russia in My Dacha

171
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,975
where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth.

172
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,916
They have shown clearly.

173
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:40,794
It is there and it is the Mother Earth which shows.

174
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:47,164
For example, I have seen flowers, if you keep
them in my room, they blossom.

175
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,726
They can become very big like that,

176
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:54,230
 never people have seen such big flowers,
sometimes they say.

177
00:42:54,255 --> 00:42:55,428
I am doing nothing.

178
00:42:55,453 --> 00:42:58,031
I am just sitting down and
what happens to the flowers?

179
00:42:58,056 --> 00:43:03,589
You see now there this principle of
 the Mother Earth works...

180
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:07,381
 the subtle Mother Earth, is works, it's a mother.

181
00:43:07,532 --> 00:43:14,821
And that gives you all the nourishment and
makes you grow healthy,

182
00:43:15,038 --> 00:43:19,946
and this is how this subtlety works of the Mother Earth .

183
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:26,143
Mother Earth is the one who is giver of virtue
to all these flowers

184
00:43:26,168 --> 00:43:31,382
and to all these trees and to all that,
but it also plays a big part in us.

185
00:43:31,407 --> 00:43:35,771
It is not only the Mother Earth that exists

186
00:43:35,796 --> 00:43:40,154
without our connection and we do not respect the Mother Earth.

187
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:43,351
We have polluted it, we have done all kinds of things,

188
00:43:43,376 --> 00:43:48,776
we have removed the trees and we have made
a mess out of her, but she is our Mother

189
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:52,414
and so many subtle things of this Mother Earth

190
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:56,376
 come into us. One of them is gravity.

191
00:43:56,689 --> 00:44:02,363
A person becomes very attractive, not in the physical sense

192
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:05,339
but in the spiritual sense.

193
00:44:05,364 --> 00:44:08,404
Such a person attracts others.

194
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:16,565
They feel attrackted and they feel that something
special is about this person.

195
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:20,013
This is one of the qualities of the Mother Earth.

196
00:44:20,038 --> 00:44:25,861
If she had not kept us attracted we would
have fallen off with her movement

197
00:44:25,886 --> 00:44:30,066
and also other qualities of the Mother Earth also

198
00:44:30,091 --> 00:44:34,821
start manifesting within us, and we become very,

199
00:44:34,822 --> 00:44:42,324
I should say, extremely tolerant, patient... person.

200
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:46,706
Tolerant and patient... extremely tolerant and patient.

201
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:51,268
But if you are not tolerant, if you are hot
tempered and all that,

202
00:44:51,293 --> 00:44:54,945
then Mother Earth's principle is not expressed I should say.

203
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:58,233
Look at the Mother Earth.
How much she tolerates our nonsense,

204
00:44:58,258 --> 00:45:03,590
how many wrong things we do against her,
 but still she tolerates.

205
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:07,309
Sri Ganesha's quality is to tolerate, to begin with.

206
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:10,923
Up to a point, he tolerates.
 In the same way,

207
00:45:10,948 --> 00:45:16,699
 we too become extremely tolerant,
patient and forgiving.

208
00:45:17,104 --> 00:45:22,665
This is the minimum of minimum that should
happen to all the Sahajayogis who have vibrations,

209
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,900
because now I have told you all the things
that are expressed in your vibrations.

210
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:34,861
It is a thing to be understood that what you
have become now is something very great,

211
00:45:35,245 --> 00:45:42,352
 it has not happened to others, it has not happened
to somebody who is not being a Sahaja Yogi.

212
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:48,586
You see the people who go to Church or to
Mosques or to Temple, see their faces.

213
00:45:49,337 --> 00:45:51,616
Look at them, how do they look like?

214
00:45:51,641 --> 00:45:55,279
They haven't got anything from the Temple,
they haven't got anything

215
00:45:55,304 --> 00:46:02,855
from the Mosque, they haven't got anything from
any one of these places where they go to worship.

216
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:05,029
So, that is artificial.

217
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:12,341
That has become something, I should say, without
any connection with the reality.

218
00:46:12,366 --> 00:46:18,841
Only after realization you are connected with
reality and you can get

219
00:46:18,866 --> 00:46:25,763
 the understanding of all these
subtleties working through you.

220
00:46:25,788 --> 00:46:31,111
Why I am telling you this, because I want
you to know and recognize yourself,

221
00:46:31,136 --> 00:46:34,392
to understand what you are, what you have got.

222
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:40,011
Once you recognize yourself and understand
yourself you can do a lot.

223
00:46:40,036 --> 00:46:47,660
First of all to say that I am a Sahaja Yogi
itself it should be very much with self confidence

224
00:46:47,685 --> 00:46:52,482
and as a self confident person should find
out what have I done as Sahaja Yogi?

225
00:46:52,507 --> 00:46:54,215
What can I do as Sahaja Yogi?

226
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,760
Some Sahaja Yogis have done wonders.

227
00:46:56,785 --> 00:47:03,118
They have done such a lot of work of Sahaja Yoga,
while some Sahaja Yogis are still writing to me

228
00:47:03,143 --> 00:47:09,816
that "my husband is fighting with me,
my son is like this, my mother like this";

229
00:47:09,816 --> 00:47:14,243
all the time, you see, letters after letters
come to me.

230
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:16,903
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

231
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:21,733
Now you just see to your subtleties, work it out.

232
00:47:21,767 --> 00:47:26,175
They think I am here to solve their problems,
their family problems,

233
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,222
and their jobs and things.
I am not here for that.

234
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,247
I am here to give you self-realization

235
00:47:33,272 --> 00:47:39,360
and the understanding that whatever you have got,
 you must accept as a challenge,

236
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,889
 take it up as a challenge and you will be amazed,
how you will be helped

237
00:47:43,914 --> 00:47:46,250
 and how you will get the results!

238
00:47:46,275 --> 00:47:51,383
"Sahaja" does not mean only
that you get spontaneous realization.

239
00:47:51,408 --> 00:47:54,052
It also means that you get spontaneity.

240
00:47:54,077 --> 00:47:56,396
The whole nature gets spontaneity.

241
00:47:56,421 --> 00:48:00,147
All these subtle things that I have told you,
they also get spontaneous

242
00:48:00,172 --> 00:48:02,025
and they work it out.

243
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:06,698
Of course, there are Angels and there are
Ganas who are helping you

244
00:48:06,723 --> 00:48:09,390
 but you need not worry about them just now.

245
00:48:09,415 --> 00:48:13,606
Main thing is you must realize what you are,
what have you got

246
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:18,725
and how much you have faced it,
you have got it and how it has worked?

247
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:26,196
I have seen every time I just have a little
problem of something, immediately it works.

248
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:34,661
It works in such quarters and such people
that I never expected.

249
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:36,550
Just  comes in.

250
00:48:36,575 --> 00:48:38,434
Everything works out.

251
00:48:38,631 --> 00:48:44,452
But whatever works out is for your good,
 is for your growth,

252
00:48:44,477 --> 00:48:47,977
for your understanding that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

253
00:48:48,002 --> 00:48:53,201
You have entered into the Kingdom of God,
but this you have to develop.

254
00:48:53,210 --> 00:49:00,140
Also, introspection can tell you that are
you working out all those things or not?

255
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:06,752
If you take to introspection, you will be
surprised to see, yes, you have these powers

256
00:49:06,868 --> 00:49:09,153
and you can do wonders.

257
00:49:09,217 --> 00:49:14,637
So I bless you all, please develop those subtle
things within you.

258
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:17,408
They are already there; you do not
have to do anything.

259
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:19,603
Only understand and locate.

260
00:49:19,628 --> 00:49:23,008
Thank you very much.
