00:02.983 --> 00:09.128
This is the book. It looks big, but
wouldn't be that big when it is printed.

00:09.329 --> 00:19.863
Is going to offer to all the Sahaja Yogis

00:20.065 --> 00:27.911
so that they read and find out what's wrong
and what we have to do.

00:28.430 --> 00:31.105
(Hindi)

00:36.965 --> 00:39.648
(Hindi)

00:48.050 --> 00:51.651
In the preface I have written:

00:52.875 --> 00:57.299
"Actually, I did not want to write a book
of this kind.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.702
I am a person who is in complete joy
of Divinity.

01:01.903 --> 01:07.426
This is all pervading joy of Divine love
and I wanted everybody to enjoy it.

01:07.627 --> 01:13.627
Especially in the West, I saw there are many
seekers of Truth. There are many scientists

01:13.828 --> 01:18.164
who have written voluminous books about
consciousness, about awareness.

01:18.365 --> 01:23.097
One can give a list of them. But all
these books really weary you completely,

01:23.298 --> 01:27.261
because they do not emit any knowledge
of the ultimate truth.

01:27.462 --> 01:31.129
I don’t want to criticise them; after all,
whatever they are doing

01:31.330 --> 01:35.280
constitutes honest research.

01:40.245 --> 01:45.319
But why not also give a chance to this
new discovery which is being made?

01:45.520 --> 01:49.088
Why not humble down to see what is
beyond this mind

01:49.289 --> 01:54.146
which gives you all this artificial
intelligence?

02:02.133 --> 02:06.261
It is extremely difficult for me to write
about the problems of Western life.

02:06.462 --> 02:08.914
It is like a tree which has grown outside.

02:09.114 --> 02:13.996
This is now to be pushed towards the roots
and made to grow inside.

02:14.197 --> 02:16.380
It is only by going deep inside

02:16.581 --> 02:20.977
that we can find out what the problems
of the Western civilisation are.

02:21.178 --> 02:25.163
This book is especially meant for
the Western people, but unfortunately,

02:25.364 --> 02:29.103
I have never studied any Western language
before.

02:29.304 --> 02:31.974
English is one of the blessings
of the British

02:32.175 --> 02:36.730
given to India when they ruled our country.
But there too, unfortunately, I studied

02:36.931 --> 02:40.441
in a vernacular school and later on
in a medical college

02:40.642 --> 02:43.817
where there is no question of learning
this language - English -

02:44.018 --> 02:49.389
which is today universally accepted,
especially in the West,

02:51.690 --> 02:54.893
especially in the West.

02:55.817 --> 02:58.813
This book is no way to show any flowery
language

02:59.014 --> 03:03.664
or to show any literary talent of mine.
It is just a straightforward statement

03:03.865 --> 03:09.062
of facts which I know and which I want
to communicate with the Western world.

03:09.263 --> 03:14.191
I would request people not to waste their
time in finding faults with my English,

03:14.392 --> 03:17.599
because that is not my Mother tongue
and I never studied it.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.844
Unfortunately, I could not get anybody else

03:21.045 --> 03:25.729
to write for me, because it had to be
written by me personally.

03:25.930 --> 03:28.763
The most difficult part is to convince
a human being

03:28.964 --> 03:32.632
that in the entire creation, he is the most
highly evolved being;

03:32.833 --> 03:38.455
that he is capable of becoming a glorious
personality, a beautiful, peaceful angel.

03:38.656 --> 03:41.110
To tell him about the problems of modern
times

03:41.373 --> 03:50.070
is not a very good way of convincing him
about what the human beings truly are.

03:50.271 --> 03:53.392
There has been so much demeaning
of human beings,

03:53.593 --> 03:56.018
so much of degradation in their value
system

03:56.218 --> 04:01.129
that I thought that unless I go to the root
of the problems, it won’t be easy

04:01.330 --> 04:07.442
to explain why they should break away
from their present shackles

04:08.360 --> 04:10.257
in order to evolve and ascend.

04:10.458 --> 04:16.732
One has to tell frankly what the problems
are and what the real solutions are.

04:16.933 --> 04:20.618
Frankly, there is no peace within human
beings nor without.

04:20.819 --> 04:25.916
The poor and the rich alike are unhappy.
Everywhere people are groping for solutions.

04:26.117 --> 04:30.307
At the artifical level, the intellectual
can work out certain problems

04:30.508 --> 04:35.316
about things that we see around us
in jeopardy.

04:35.517 --> 04:40.147
But while a few problems may be resolved
in this way, others arise.

04:40.348 --> 04:43.464
[The] true solution lies not
in the material circumstances

04:43.702 --> 04:49.063
outside human beings but inside the human
beings,

04:51.996 --> 04:56.815
inside the human beings themselves. True
and lasting solution to present ills

04:57.016 --> 05:04.983
can be found only by inner, collective
transformation of human beings.

05:05.184 --> 05:09.029
This is not an impossibility. In fact,
it has already happened.

05:09.229 --> 05:12.285
There are so many thousands and
thousands...

05:12.486 --> 05:17.428
There are so many - thousands and thousands
who have actually achieved this state.

05:17.666 --> 05:19.020
(Hindi)

05:19.221 --> 05:22.603
The reality of en-masse inner
transformation of human beings

05:22.804 --> 05:28.181
by Self-realisation is the most
revolutionary discovery of the present age.

05:28.382 --> 05:32.365
But so far, very few governments have
accepted this discovery,

05:32.566 --> 05:41.994
especially in America, England, France,
Italy or Germany.

05:42.195 --> 05:45.525
The Pope, who himself is supposed to be
in charge of religion,

05:45.726 --> 05:49.523
meets false gurus, but he will never meet
me or talk to me,

05:49.724 --> 05:53.990
though I have met him before he was elected
to this job of a Pope.

05:54.191 --> 05:59.485
This is not my job, this is not my work, but
it is a spontaneous desire of the Divine

05:59.686 --> 06:04.318
that this should be brought in full -
in full swing,

06:04.519 --> 06:08.616
so that human beings are raised to a higher
state of consciousness

06:08.817 --> 06:12.101
by which they can realise what they are,

06:12.302 --> 06:15.839
so that they can appreciate and glorify
themselves.

06:16.040 --> 06:20.233
To me, human beings are like the deities
who are still in stone form

06:20.434 --> 06:24.206
and who can be transformed, with Kundalini
awakening, into angels.

06:24.407 --> 06:27.127
I wish with this book I will not hurt
people.

06:27.328 --> 06:30.952
On the contrary, I hope to be able to get
many more people

06:31.153 --> 06:35.224
for this great work of Sahaja Yoga,
by which they can achieve their ultimate.

06:35.425 --> 06:39.197
I have to use humour, because by nature
I am very humourous

06:39.398 --> 06:45.480
and I see humour in every kind of incident,
which people sometimes take very seriously.

06:45.681 --> 06:49.112
It is too much for a Mother to talk about
the ills of her children,

06:49.313 --> 06:51.245
but unless and until that is faced,

06:51.446 --> 06:56.048
I don’t think the children can ever get
their benevolence

06:56.249 --> 07:00.106
and can reach their ultimate goal, which is
their Self-realisation.

07:00.307 --> 07:03.357
So I would ask all of you not to get angry
with me,

07:03.558 --> 07:07.330
but to understand that out of my tremendous
compassion and love,

07:07.531 --> 07:10.555
I have written this book for the benevolence
of the people,

07:10.756 --> 07:14.583
with whatever English I can use, with
whatever literature I can use,

07:14.784 --> 07:18.450
with whatever style I could adopt."

08:19.170 --> 08:22.471
Ah, thank you very much.

08:23.339 --> 08:27.519
This is just the preface... I would...

08:29.691 --> 08:35.803
Just to introduce this book I thought
better be apologetic

08:36.004 --> 08:40.738
so that nobody gets angry, to begin with.
All right.

08:40.939 --> 08:43.043
But the book has come out well, I think,

08:43.244 --> 08:50.925
and we are thinking of printing it somewhere
and getting it done in a proper way.

08:51.126 --> 08:56.581
So, I think, it might be ready by one
or two months time

08:56.782 --> 09:05.314
and may be that in Diwali Puja, I can't say
when, depends on how they print it.

09:05.515 --> 09:10.236
The first edition will be only for
Sahaja Yogis.

09:10.437 --> 09:13.057
May God bless you.

09:16.365 --> 09:19.095
(Hindi)

09:20.687 --> 09:25.999
(Hindi)

09:45.482 --> 09:53.734
The title of the book is: (Hindi)
What's the title?

09:56.181 --> 10:05.180
Modern... Modern Era - Meta Modern Era.
Yogi: Meta Modern Era.

10:05.381 --> 10:13.063
It is called as "Meta Modern Era" -
"Meta Modern Era".
