00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.520
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.320
At the very outset, I have to say that truth is what it is.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.800
You cannot change it, you cannot transform it,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.200
and it cannot compromise with you.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.600
It is, it has been, it will be the same.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.720
Whatever I have to tell you tonight

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.800
you need not accept it blindfolded.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.800
We have had already very big problems with these blind faiths.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.800
You should have an open mind like a scientist

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.600
and treat this talk as a hypothesis.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.720
But if it is proved then you have to accept as honest people.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.720
Because it is for your benevolence,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.000
it is for the benevolence of your country,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.800
it is for the benevolence of the whole world.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.400
The truth is that you are not this body, this mind,

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.400
these emotions, intelligence, ego or your conditionings,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.600
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.400
We see beautiful flowers around us, it's actually a miracle.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.320
But we take it for granted.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.000
If we ask a doctor, "Who runs our heart?"

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.040
he will say, "The autonomous nervous system."

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.840
But who is this 'auto'?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.120
This they cannot answer.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.840
And who does all this living work?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.040
Who brought forth our evolution?

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.520
There is no answer.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.040
The second truth is

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.440
that there is a All-Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.920
It is a subtle energy which does all this living work.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.440
Now, unless and until

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.640
we evolve more than what we are today,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.520
it's not possible with this human awareness

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.320
to feel the existence of this All-Pervading Power.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.520
And if you have to have this ascent,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.640
then you have to just have pure desire for it.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.920
The pure desire

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.920
is a desire from our mundane desire is very different.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.640
According to economics, wants are not satiable in general.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.440
Today we want to have a house, then a car,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.240
then a helicopter, goes on like that.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.240
But the pure desire of which you are not aware is this

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.960
that you want to evolve

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.760
and to feel this union with this All-Pervading Power.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.840
To feel this All-Pervading Power,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.760
to be in union with it is the yoga, spiritual yoga.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.360
Sahaja means 'born with you'.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.440
Is this right to get this union, this yoga.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.360
So, the time has come

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.960
for all of us to use this right.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.760
So when this Kundalini, this power,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.640
from the sacrum bone rises like a primule of a seed,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.360
it passes through six centers.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.760
Most of the global problems come from human beings,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.440
and most of the human problems come from their centers.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.440
By any chance, by any method

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:39.440
if we could improve or nourish these centers, all our physical,

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.760
mental, emotional, and spiritual problems will be solved.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.440
It's a fact

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.960
that through Sahaja Yoga many diseases have been cured.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.760
Cancer, also many incurable diseases have been cured.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.280
It's your own power.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:30.560
It is waiting for this moment,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.480
is your Mother,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.280
anxious to give you your Second Birth.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.960
So when you say you are born again

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.760
you have to have powers with it.

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.680
For example, in Sanskrit language

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.880
we call a bird as Dwijaha and a Realized soul also Dwijaha,

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.480
meaning twice born.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:26.760
That means you are completely transformed

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.960
- physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.760
When this Kundalini rises,

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.480
and She pierces through the sixth center,

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.480
becomes one with this All-Pervading Subtle Power,

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.280
you also become subtler.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.480
On your fingertips you start feeling your centers.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.280
And if you know how to correct your centers

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.560
you are all right, problems are solved.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.560
But also you can feel the centers of others.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.880
It's like microcosm becoming macrocosm,

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.080
it's like a drop becoming an ocean.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.800
It sounds fantastic,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.400
but you don't know how glorious you are, how fantastic you are.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600
You don't know yourself at all.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.280
You have no knowledge of your inner being.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:31.280
So you feel sometimes frustrated as if you have no identity.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.680
But once you start feeling this All-Pervading Power

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.400
then you understand that you have many powers.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.680
You can cure yourself, you can cure others.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.960
You can raise others' Kundalini, give them Realization.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.400
When the Kundalini comes in this part

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.480
When the Kundalini comes in this part

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:25.680
She enlightens within you your religion which is innate.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.280
That means you become righteous.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.960
Like people who are they may be Christians, Hindu, Muslims, anything

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.400
- it's just a brand, they can commit any sin they want.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:09.280
But after this happening you become really a righteous person.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.680
Christ has described it in the second chapter Mathews.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.080
He says, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:41.200
Means innocent eyes without any greed, without any lust in the eye.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.520
Actually your eyes become like that.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.800
Innocence cannot be lost.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.600
It is covered with clouds because of our wrong doings,

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.920
but it cannot be lost.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.520
It cannot be destroyed.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:20.000
And you become so powerful that even a glance of such a person

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:25.400
can create beautiful peaceful atmosphere.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.720
Then, when your Spirit comes into your attention,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.120
you know the absolute truth

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.400
- about everything.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.400
Supposing you have ten children who are Realized souls

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.800
and tie up their eyes and ask them,

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.920
"What's wrong with this gentleman?"

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.000
And all the children will say - take out one finger,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.400
say this finger supposing.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.400
You ask that gentleman, "Have you got heart trouble?"

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.600
He'll say, "Yes of course, but how do you know?"

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.600
You get the diagnosis on your fingertips.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.720
You can say what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others,

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.000
and you speak the language of centers, chakras.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.320
Absolute truth means everybody sees the same truth.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.920
Now, we are human beings,

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.040
we have freedom to think the way we want to think.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.720
So one thinks like that, another thinks like that,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.320
another thinks like that,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.840
and that's why the problem.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.040
Some think they are correct, another think they are correct,

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.640
some think this is the best, and they fight.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.040
If you know the absolute truth,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.040
there's no question of fight,

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.440
quarrel, of course no war.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.520
Now, we have this Sahaja Yoga working in 65 Nations,

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.040
and I've not seen

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.440
- even if they are 5'000 together from different countries

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:32.840
- ever fighting, quarrelling, even using a bad word.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.520
They just enjoy each other.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.520
The families in Sahaja Yoga are really excellent families,

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.440
and so many Realized souls are born to them.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.640
It's a new race of angels I feel.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.040
For all this you don't have to pay a single pai.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.560
It's a living process.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.960
When we put one seed in the Mother Earth,

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.360
how much do we pay to the Mother Earth?

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.960
She sprouts the seed

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:43.040
because the seed has the built-in mechanism to sprout,

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.040
and the Mother Earth has the power to germinate.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.840
So the first thing we have to know that,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.960
you cannot pay for your spirituality.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.440
I know there have been many who tried to exploit

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.840
all over the world, but they are mostly now exposed.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.960
I would say it was your mistake

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.840
because how much did you pay to Christ?

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:46.440
Now, one has to understand that I'm talking about Divine love.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.240
They all talk of love, all right,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.840
but it's the actualization of that Divine love.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.360
It is the becoming which is important,

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.760
not just talking about it.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.240
There has been lot of talk, we are this, we are that.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.240
So you become extremely dynamic with this power,

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.240
at the same time extremely compassionate.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.280
You don't have to suggest, you don't have to think,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.880
you just - you become compassionate.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.880
The compassion just works.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:02.560
Then another thing is that we think about future and past.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.960
The thought rises, falls, another thought rises and falls,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.360
and we are jumping on the cusp of future and past.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.960
We cannot be in the present,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.560
which is the reality.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.160
Present is the reality.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.360
The past is finished, and the future doesn't exist.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.680
When the Kundalini rises

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.360
She elongates those thoughts and establishes in the center

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.360
where there is complete thoughtless awareness.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:19.480
And spiritually you grow in that thoughtless awareness

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.680
which in Sanskrit we call as Nirvichaar Samadhi.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.880
The second state we call as Nirvikalpa Samadhi means

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.560
doubtless awareness,

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.560
when you become your own master.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.360
Because in the light of the Spirit you know what is the truth is.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.080
What is destructive for you and what is constructive for you.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.080
And you just disregard all that is destructive.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.600
I don't have to tell you, "Don't do this, don't - no."

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.600
If I say that, half of you will go away.

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:36.480
It's like this, supposing I have a snake in My hand,

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.080
and I am very adamant

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.280
and it's darkness

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.800
and somebody says that,  "There's a snake in your hand."

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.960
I will say, "No, it is a rope."

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.200
Until the snake bites Me I will say, "It's a rope."

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.880
But if there is little light

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.880
immediately I will throw away the snake.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.200
Nobody has to tell you.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.400
This is how your attention becomes enlightened,

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.880
and you become a very wise and sane personality.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.800
And then you understand your value,

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.480
your identity.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:46.960
Then you know you have become the instrument of this Divine love.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.600
It's a pure love.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.960
Like a sap rises in a tree,

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.880
it gives whatever is needed for every part of the tree

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.600
- ultimately it evaporates.

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.800
But supposing it likes one flower,

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.720
gets attached.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.200
Then the tree will die and the flower will die also.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.320
So this detachment comes from within.

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:44.520
It's not to wear these dresses of renouncing

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.400
or to shave your head, that's not needed.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.120
It's an inner happening.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.800
You don't have to give up your families,

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.200
you don't have to give up your jobs,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.600
you have to be absolutely normal.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.520
But when you become thoughtlessly aware,

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.000
the peace is established within.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.200
I have known many people who have got peace awards,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.520
this award, that award - they have no peace within,

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.200
I don't know how they got it.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.120
Actually most of them are very hot tempered.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.920
If you have to reach them you have to take a barge pole, somehow.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.600
You establish your peace within

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.520
and then the whole world becomes like a drama.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.240
You get out of your problems and see them clearly.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.920
Like if you are standing in the water you are afraid of the waves,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.520
but if you get into the boat you can see the waves.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:39.640
But if you know how to swim you can jump in and save many others.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.920
This is how Sahaja Yoga works.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.640
Your attention can go to any limit,

00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:03.240
you can find out about anyone dead or alive in any country.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.920
When we see television, we know about the ether.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.920
But I am talking about the subtle of the ether,

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:34.240
which is so efficient, which is so fast,

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.840
which is so active, and which is so loving.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.520
You find your life so blissful.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.120
People write to Me about the miracles they have had.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.440
I asked somebody to compile them,

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.520
and in one month he told Me,

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.840
"They have come up to my head like that, now what am I to do?"

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.640
They said, "You better sort it out, Mother."

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.040
I said, "I have no time, all right, forget it."

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.640
Then you realize how glorified you are,

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.240
what great thing you are.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.560
Now, you are at the epitome of evolution.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.160
Little more advancement and you are there in the Kingdom of God,

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.840
absolutely protected and loved.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.440
The time has come, this is a special time.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.440
I call it the Blossom Time.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.760
In Indian prophecies,

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.040
they have described this time very clearly that,

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.240
"So many souls will take birth

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.440
and there will be increase in the population

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.360
and they will find themselves, they will know the self-knowledge."

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.760
It's not that the body will come out of the grave,

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.840
after 500 years what is left of the body in the grave?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:16.160
Muslims believe, Christians believe, Jews believe

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.360
- I think there is something wrong.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.160
It's the soul which is going to take birth.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:37.840
Above all you jump into the ocean of joy.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.440
Joy is singular.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.560
When our ego is happy we become happy,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.160
when it is punctured we feel unhappy.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.640
So we move from happiness to unhappiness

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.280
and happiness to unhappiness.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:21.160
But joy is an experience - which has no alternative.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.680
You can enjoy everything,

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.360
and you can find solutions to everything.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:46.680
Today as it is you know, world has come to a point of great shock.

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.160
They are talking about breaking families,

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.080
they are killing children,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.480
I mean, unbelievable things are happening.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.960
But at this time it is predicted that,  "You will be seeking

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.160
the truth and you'll find it."

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:30.080
Only thing I have to tell you

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.880
that if you don't have desire I cannot force on you,

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.560
I respect your freedom.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.080
The experience is not mental, it is beyond mental.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:02.080
So if you don't want to have it's better you leave the hall.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.680
But it's your right to have it if you desire.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.360
In this short lecture I cannot tell you everything about it.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:30.360
Also lecturing is also a mental acrobat.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:43.280
So it will take hardly ten minutes to get your Self-Realization.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.560
So those who don't want to have should leave the hall first.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:02.880
All right.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.600
There are three conditions.

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:18.600
First one is that you have to be absolutely

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:25.200
self-confident that you are going to get your Self-Realization.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.680
That means you should not condemn yourself for anything.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.960
You should not feel guilty.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.600
Guilty at all about anything that has happened in the past.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.280
At this moment the past is finished.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.600
Unfortunately if you feel guilty,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.800
then this center catches very badly

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.800
and you get disease called angina,

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.080
also spondylitis, and also lethargic organs.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.680
It's a fashion to feel guilty.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.680
I mean, some people feel guilty for their forefathers,

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:40.880
some feel guilty, say for Rwanda people,

00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.880
you can't help these things.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.200
It's a myth.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:01.480
And at this moment it's important that please don't feel guilty,

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.960
because the Kundalini will stop at this center.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.400
All your life you have tortured yourself and now

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.520
at this important moment you should not feel guilty,

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.800
so the Kundalini doesn't rise

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.400
and you miss your Self-Realization.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.120
In short you should be presently

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.600
pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.600
As I respect you, you must respect yourself.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.200
As I love you, you must love yourself.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.800
That's all I want.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:14.520
The second condition is

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:20.200
that you have to forgive everyone in general,

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.520
that means you don't even have to think about

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:31.920
whom you have to forgive,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:38.720
because that's a headache.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.120
Logically, whether you forgive or you don't forgive

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.520
you don't do anything.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.120
It's a myth.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.520
But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.920
and the center on the optic chiasma is like this - constricted.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.920
At this moment, if you don't forgive it won't open like this

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:19.000
and you will miss your chance,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:22.720
such an important thing of Self-Realization.

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.920
So please forgive - in general I say.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:42.120
Now, the third condition is

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.440
you have to take out your shoes.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.440
Because this Mother Earth helps us.

00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:00.520
Many people don't like the third condition sometimes.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.920
In England, first time when I asked them

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.240
to take out their shoes, half of them walked off

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.640
very seriously.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:44.120
Now, somebody will show you.

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:55.720
First you should see what we are going to do.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:05.520
He must have told you that we have two channels, left and right

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:12.320
which are opposite to each other but are complimentary.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:28.520
They look after the sympathetic nervous systems, left and right.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:37.440
So the left one is for the power of desire, by which we desire,

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.720
mundane desire,

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:48.240
and in the right we have the power of action.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:55.640
So you have to put your both feet apart from each other.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:06.040
And put your left hand on your left lap

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.240
like this very comfortably.

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.240
This is suggestive and symbolic

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:25.560
of your desire to have Self-Realization.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.560
So we use our right hand for the action.

00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:41.160
Please be seated,

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:43.560
we have room here for you.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.240
All of you have to sit down, please,

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.560
be comfortable.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.960
You don't have to go to Himalaya,

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:00.440
stand on your head, shave off your hair, nothing of the kind.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.640
Be comfortable.

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:13.840
So, now we put our right hand on our heart.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:20.840
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.640
Now if you become the Spirit,

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.240
you become your own guide and your own master.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.360
Now take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.160
on the left hand side.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.560
We are working only on the left hand side.

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.440
Here is the center for your mastery.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.760
Mastery over yourself and mastery over the knowledge,

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.480
the pure Divine knowledge.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.680
It's created by great prophets and seers,

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.680
which is to be enlightened.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:29.160
Now take down your hand into the lower portion of your abdomen

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.880
on the left hand side.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.360
Surprisingly this is the center for pure Divine knowledge.

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:49.280
Now raise your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.880
Then on your heart.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.280
Then in the corner of your neck and shoulder

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.280
and turn your head to your right.

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.960
Oh. It is there, that means you are feeling guilty.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.560
Please don't feel guilty.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:23.480
Now, take your right hand on top of your forehead across

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.480
and put down your head

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.480
this is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:38.960
or forgive everyone.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:49.160
In general without thinking about them.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.760
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.760
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.880
This is the center where without feeling guilty,

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.560
without counting your mistakes for your own satisfaction

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.280
you have to ask  forgiveness

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:16.280
from the All-Pervading Power of Divine love.

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:37.200
Now, the last center is very important, stretch your palm fully.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:49.400
Now put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.400
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.960
Now push back your fingers, it's very important,

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:06.880
so that there's a good pressure on your scalp.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:15.280
Now put down your head

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.280
and move your scalp slowly 16

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:28.600
- 7 times, 7 times, clockwise.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.480
Now, that's all we have to do.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.200
But please remember to push back your fingers.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:03.200
Now again, see that your both legs are apart from each other,

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.200
and the left hand is on your left lap.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.880
You can close your eyes and take out your spectacles,

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.080
please don't open your eyes till I tell you.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.480
So now, put your right hand on your heart

00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.400
and close your eyes.

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.680
Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.480
question about yourself

00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.320
- you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:06.320
Please say three times, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.320
Say in your heart.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.920
As I told you, when you are the Spirit

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:41.600
you become your own guide, your own master.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.120
So now please bring your right hand

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.000
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

00:49:55.200 --> 00:50:00.320
and here you ask another fundamental question about yourself,

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:06.800
three times in your heart, "Mother, am I my own master?"

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.800
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:37.120
and I cannot force Self-Realization

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:42.600
or pure Divine knowledge on you

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.320
- so you have to ask for it.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.600
So now, please take your right hand

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.720
in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:08.800
and ask six times, because this center has got six petals,

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:14.320
"Mother, please give me pure Divine knowledge."

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:38.320
As soon as you ask for the pure divine knowledge

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.120
the Kundalini starts rising within you.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:47.320
So we have to nourish our upper centers

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:51.120
with our full self-confidence.

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:12.320
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.840
on the left hand side.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:23.920
Here you have to say with full confidence ten times,

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.920
"Mother, I am my own master."

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:40.920
At the very outset, I told you

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:45.440
that you are not this body, this mind,

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:49.320
these emotions, this intelligence, these conditionings,

00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.240
and the ego, but you are the pure Spirit.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:09.240
So raise your right hand on your heart

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.040
and say with full confidence again, twelve times,

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.640
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:36.920
This All-Pervading Divine Power of Love

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.640
is the ocean of knowledge,

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:46.640
is the ocean of bliss and compassion,

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.920
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:09.120
So whatever mistakes you might have committed

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:13.920
can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness at this moment.

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.840
So please forgive yourself

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.240
and raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:31.440
and turn your head to your right.

00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:40.440
Here you have to say 16 times,

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:46.560
"Mother I am not guilty at all."

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.360
Say it with full confidence.

00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:04.760
I have already told you that logically,

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.560
whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.440
It is a myth,

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:22.560
but you are playing into wrong hands and torturing yourself.

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.960
At this moment, if you do not forgive,

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:35.240
the center of Agnya won't open and the Kundalini won't rise.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:41.960
So please, please forgive, forgive everyone in general.

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:02.360
By raising your hand on top of your forehead,

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.640
put down your head.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.240
And here you say,

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:17.440
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:41.640
Now without feeling guilty,

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:45.360
without counting your mistakes for your satisfaction

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:51.240
you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading Divine Power.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.160
So please take your right hand on the back side of your head

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.240
and push back your head.

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:16.280
Here you have to say,

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:21.160
"Oh Divine power, please forgive me,

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:26.360
if I have done any mistakes, knowingly or unknowingly."

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.880
Please say it in your heart, not how many times.

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:55.960
Now the last center you have to stretch your palm fully,

00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:01.360
put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.280
and put down your head.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:17.160
Here again,

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:22.280
I cannot force Self-Realization on you, you have to ask for it.

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.760
Now, push back your fingers,

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:34.480
put a pressure on your scalp

00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:38.560
and move it seven times saying,

00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:46.480
"Mother, please give me my Self-Realization",

00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:50.960
clockwise you have to move.

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.160
Push back your fingers

00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:41.160
and move the scalp clockwise.

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.880
Please bend your heads, bend your heads.

00:59:54.160 --> 01:00:00.760
Now, take down your hands

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.360
and please open your eyes slowly.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.280
Put both the hands towards Me

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:14.400
and watch Me without thinking.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.800
Now put the right hand towards Me

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.800
and put the left hand on top of the fontanel bone area

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:35.400
and see for yourself if there's a cool, or a hot,

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:38.080
breeze-like vibrations are coming

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.960
out of your own fontanel bone area.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:44.200
Now please put your left hand towards Me.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.480
And now see with the right hand

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:53.800
if there is a cool or a hot breeze-like vibrations

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.960
coming from your own fontanel bone area.

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:11.480
If it is hot means you have not forgiven.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.800
Please forgive now, at this moment.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.680
Now, again with the right hand once again.

01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:30.080
Please bend your head.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.600
Now raise both your hands towards the sky,

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.400
push back your head.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.080
Here you have to ask one of these three questions three times.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.200
First one is,

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.480
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:18.320
Second is, "Mother

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.120
is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love,

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.120
is this the Ruh?"

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:36.400
The third is, "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?"

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.720
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.720
Now, take down your hands.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.400
Please put your hands to Me.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:09.800
All those who have felt the cool breeze on the fingertips

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:17.320
or on the palm or through their fontanel bone area,

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.520
cool breeze or hot breeze, raise both your hands.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.600
May God bless you all,

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.920
you all have become saints now, I bow to you.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.920
Now respect your Self-Realization.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.600
Still you have to grow.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.800
We have to understand that this is a collective process.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.000
You cannot do it alone anyway.

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.000
So you have to come to collective.

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.400
Of course, you don't have to pay at all for anything.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.320
But you have to give some time,

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.800
some importance to your Self-Realization.

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:46.920
So please, make it a point to come to the collective.

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.720
Very surprising, you don't know Me,

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.840
I am not an Austrian,

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.440
but when I come always the halls are full,

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:05.920
but when I go away they don't follow up, I don't know why.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.120
Only in Russia, I have seen people have gone very deep,

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.920
they are so deep people, very deep people.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.320
Once they get Realization they just get to it.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.040
It's very surprising.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.440
So I have to make a request to you

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.720
that though you have got it everything

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.640
so easily you have to grow into it.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:02.320
You have to have the whole knowledge.

01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:10.040
I must have spoken only in English language at least

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.640
- there must be 4'000, 5'000 lectures.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:25.320
But they are only indications to know

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.840
what you are and to experience it.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:37.320
Sahaja Yoga is an experience.

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:44.240
In Sanskrit, we have a word called Budha or Vida

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.440
that means to know the knowledge on your central nervous system.

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.840
From Budha the word Buddha has come.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.840
From Vida the word Vedas has come.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.360
So this knowledge is your own.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:22.040
It was the ancient treasure,

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.440
but now is available to all of us.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.560
So please try to understand the importance of your being.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.560
I always come after one year

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.560
and I hope to come back to see you all.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.360
May God bless you!

01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.440
Thank you very much! May God bless you all!
