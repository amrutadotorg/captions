00:09:55.015 --> 00:10:01.375
I'm telling them about love, all-pervading
love of God Almighty.

00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:05.345
He's created this whole thing.

00:10:05.345 --> 00:10:09.305
The whole atmosphere is there.

00:10:09.305 --> 00:10:13.904
The whole feeling is there of love.

00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:21.525
But it's possible only for people who are
innocent, like children.

00:10:21.525 --> 00:10:27.695
If you are very mature in your hatred, no
one can save you.

00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:32.524
You'll have ten arguments to show that your
hatred is justifiable.

00:10:32.524 --> 00:10:38.085
Then you'll go to any extent to justify it.

00:10:38.085 --> 00:10:45.895
We had people in our country, which is a very,
supposed to be a very, sober country, a very

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:52.614
peaceful country, we had people who just believe
in killing - kill this, kill that.

00:10:52.614 --> 00:11:01.285
So even in this country, which didn't believe
in all these things, indulged into all kinds

00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:04.965
of violence since long.

00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:15.635
But basically we are people who believe in
peace, because without peace no growth can

00:11:15.635 --> 00:11:16.735
take place.

00:11:16.735 --> 00:11:18.635
There has to be complete peace.

00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:26.985
If there is peace in your heart, if there
is peace surrounding you, you grow into a

00:11:26.985 --> 00:11:29.855
beautiful nation.

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:45.155
Not out of fear, not out of pressure, but
from inside; if you are a person who has complete

00:11:45.155 --> 00:11:52.955
peace within the heart, not that he is not
afraid of anything, but he emits peace.

00:11:52.955 --> 00:11:55.925
He gives peace.

00:11:55.925 --> 00:12:02.324
Anybody who goes near such a person, gets
the peace, the feeling of peacefulness.

00:12:02.324 --> 00:12:05.345
You all are Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:05.345 --> 00:12:08.495
You all have got your Realization.

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:16.565
That is, your spirit is now emitting vibrations
of peace and joy.

00:12:16.565 --> 00:12:23.685
Wherever you are, you will emit peaceful vibrations.

00:12:23.685 --> 00:12:26.194
You will create peace.

00:12:26.194 --> 00:12:35.875
You'll find out ways of creating peace, how
to establish peaceful atmosphere.

00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:46.375
It's very important that we have to grow in
such a manner that we create peace and give

00:12:46.375 --> 00:12:50.634
peace to others and become examples of it.

00:12:50.634 --> 00:13:00.205
I cannot believe in this Delhi I could have
so many people who are realised souls.

00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:02.565
I never expected.

00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:16.205
First of all, I had to wait until people got
into a proper mind to understand My work,

00:13:16.205 --> 00:13:25.345
because we had partition and so many people
lost their lives, lost their properties and

00:13:25.345 --> 00:13:26.345
I have faced all that.

00:13:26.345 --> 00:13:34.444
I have seen it Myself and they just couldn't;
couldn't forgive other people.

00:13:34.444 --> 00:13:48.015
So forgiveness is a very good method of understanding
the pain of others; troubles of others, but

00:13:48.015 --> 00:13:50.985
this depth you have to develop.

00:13:50.985 --> 00:14:01.634
Instead of getting angry, getting revengeful,
if you can develop that peace within yourself,

00:14:01.634 --> 00:14:11.925
if you can manage to have the peace of your
mind through Divine love, there's no need

00:14:11.925 --> 00:14:15.485
for you to do anything extra.

00:14:15.485 --> 00:14:21.265
It's just the peace that you have, now, in
your heart.

00:14:21.265 --> 00:14:23.255
Just feel it.

00:14:23.255 --> 00:14:26.225
You are a peaceful person.

00:14:26.225 --> 00:14:32.485
You are not a person who is easily disturbed.

00:14:32.485 --> 00:14:38.008
You will never give explanations for getting
angry, for spoiling the mood of people.

00:14:38.008 --> 00:14:39.008
You will not do that.

00:14:39.008 --> 00:14:49.775
You are the ones who rise above all this anger
and this stupid revengefulness.

00:14:49.775 --> 00:14:59.525
It is difficult to explain to those people
who are not Realized Souls, because if I talk

00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:01.433
to them, they won't like it.

00:15:01.475 --> 00:15:06.034
If they get their realisation, we can talk
to them.

00:15:06.034 --> 00:15:09.874
So best thing you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:09.874 --> 00:15:19.284
Spread it among Sikhs, among Muslims, among
Christians, throughout, and especially among

00:15:19.284 --> 00:15:28.284
Hindus because nowadays I find Hindus are
also, have lost their grip over their understanding

00:15:28.284 --> 00:15:38.284
of our country and its culture and that's
how they just revenge, they take revenge.

00:15:38.284 --> 00:15:42.955
I don't understand this kind of revenge but
what to do?

00:15:42.955 --> 00:15:51.654
People are already on that level, on that
low level, where they don't understand many

00:15:51.654 --> 00:15:52.654
things.

00:15:52.654 --> 00:16:04.184
For example now, they do not want people to
build a temple of Shri Rama at a particular

00:16:04.184 --> 00:16:05.184
point.

00:16:05.184 --> 00:16:11.295
Because they are not Sahaja Yogis, I can't
talk to them that that is the place where

00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:13.205
He was born.

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:16.684
So we must pay full respect to His incarnation.

00:16:16.684 --> 00:16:26.775
If that is the place He was born, we can feel
it with the vibrations, then why deny the

00:16:26.775 --> 00:16:32.325
fact and the truth just because you don't
want it to be done?

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:36.675
It's very difficult to talk to them.

00:16:36.675 --> 00:16:44.904
What to understand is that, what has Babar
done for us?

00:16:44.904 --> 00:16:46.195
Who was Babar?

00:16:46.195 --> 00:16:52.874
He was a foreigner and this one was not even
built by Babar.

00:16:52.874 --> 00:16:55.864
No, it was not.

00:16:55.864 --> 00:17:03.964
It was somebody who was his - one of the military
man who went and built it and that's why they

00:17:03.964 --> 00:17:05.865
call it a Babri Masjid.

00:17:05.865 --> 00:17:13.684
But let us find out what happened to this
Mr. Babar.

00:17:13.684 --> 00:17:19.654
He died, but he came from abroad.

00:17:19.654 --> 00:17:22.915
He was not even an Indian.

00:17:22.915 --> 00:17:25.575
And doesn't matter, he was not born there.

00:17:25.575 --> 00:17:33.265
I mean, he had nothing to do with that place,
but definitely I know and you all will know,

00:17:33.265 --> 00:17:41.564
can feel it all on your hands just now that
it is Babri Masjid, is the place where Shri

00:17:41.564 --> 00:17:43.874
Rama was born.

00:17:43.874 --> 00:17:51.265
Now, if you want to build a temple there,
what will go wrong with people?

00:17:51.265 --> 00:17:54.594
What will happen to them if a temple is built
there?

00:17:54.594 --> 00:18:02.255
I mean it is just a question of respect and
feelings about it.

00:18:02.255 --> 00:18:09.555
I also take Rama's name; everybody takes His
name because such a solace and such a comfort.

00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:16.394
But the way people look at things, it's difficult,
you can't talk to them.

00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:29.335
Now they are talking about another nonsense
that we have one hair of Mohammed-sahib in

00:18:29.335 --> 00:18:31.624
Kashmir.

00:18:31.624 --> 00:18:35.195
Now somebody said that it is not His hair.

00:18:35.195 --> 00:18:37.975
How do you know?

00:18:37.975 --> 00:18:42.495
What is your criterion to decide whose hair
it is?

00:18:42.495 --> 00:18:49.435
Actually, you will be amazed, when I went
to Kashmir; we were going somewhere in the

00:18:49.435 --> 00:18:54.375
car and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations.

00:18:54.375 --> 00:18:58.406
So I asked the driver, "Why don't you take
the car on this side?"

00:18:58.406 --> 00:18:59.406
He said, "Why?"

00:18:59.406 --> 00:19:00.406
"Because I want to go."

00:19:00.406 --> 00:19:07.174
He said, "It is an old road and there are
some few people living there."

00:19:07.174 --> 00:19:09.145
"It doesn't matter.

00:19:09.145 --> 00:19:10.465
Take it."

00:19:10.465 --> 00:19:21.005
We went near and nearer and there were some
houses of Muslims, so we called them and asked

00:19:21.005 --> 00:19:24.175
them, "What is here going on?"

00:19:24.175 --> 00:19:29.995
They said, "It is Hazrat Bal."

00:19:29.995 --> 00:19:34.535
Even the name gives you such peace.

00:19:34.535 --> 00:19:37.965
It was the hair of Muhammed-sahib.

00:19:37.965 --> 00:19:45.205
Now Hindus don't want to know about Him and
Muslims don't want to know about Shri Ram.

00:19:45.205 --> 00:19:48.385
It's very surprising.

00:19:48.385 --> 00:19:55.965
They are all having their own shops and selling
there own things, but they don't understand

00:19:55.965 --> 00:20:01.835
that whatever they are selling is the same
which the other people are selling.

00:20:01.835 --> 00:20:03.885
For example, they say, "Allah."

00:20:03.885 --> 00:20:05.604
Who is Allah?

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:16.935
According to Sahaj Yoga, Allah is nobody else
but Vishnu and Vishnu who came also as Shri

00:20:16.935 --> 00:20:19.294
Ram.

00:20:19.294 --> 00:20:26.385
So whatever they call as Allah is Shri Ram
Himself.

00:20:26.385 --> 00:20:29.205
Only a Sahaj Yogi can understand that.

00:20:29.205 --> 00:20:34.645
If you put up your hands now when I am talking,
you will be surprised what vibrations are

00:20:34.645 --> 00:20:46.755
there because it is Shri Ram, who is Allah,
whom you are trying to insult by your stupidity.

00:20:46.755 --> 00:20:54.265
So it could be stupidity on part of Muhammed-sahib
or on part of Hindus.

00:20:54.265 --> 00:20:58.065
Hindus are also not understanding.

00:20:58.065 --> 00:21:03.885
Somehow they know that is the birthplace of
Shri Ram.

00:21:03.885 --> 00:21:07.474
Somehow, I don't know, somebody must have
told them.

00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:10.265
Or maybe - I don't know how they know - they
don't know vibrations.

00:21:10.265 --> 00:21:20.705
I haven't yet met many Hindus who have vibration
- I mean those who are what you can call fundamentalist.

00:21:20.705 --> 00:21:22.085
They never have vibrations.

00:21:22.085 --> 00:21:27.455
So I used to wonder, how do they know this
is the janma bhoomi of Shri Rama?

00:21:27.455 --> 00:21:29.855
Maybe, somehow they come to know.

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:32.765
But they have no point to prove.

00:21:32.765 --> 00:21:40.685
The problem is if they were Realized Souls,
if our high court judges were Realized Souls,

00:21:40.685 --> 00:21:47.904
if our cabinet were Realized Souls, you could
have talked to them.

00:21:47.904 --> 00:21:53.784
But they are all - what should I say?

00:21:53.784 --> 00:21:57.115
- Absolutely blocked people.

00:21:57.115 --> 00:22:01.305
How to tell them that this quarrel is a nonsense?

00:22:01.305 --> 00:22:09.315
It is perfectly all right to build a temple
of Shri Ram.

00:22:09.315 --> 00:22:16.805
But whatever you may say, the trouble is first
they all should get their Self Realization.

00:22:16.805 --> 00:22:25.195
Just now, at the time when we are talking,
see, there are not sufficient people who have

00:22:25.195 --> 00:22:26.854
got Self Realization.

00:22:26.854 --> 00:22:29.885
You are all Realized Souls.

00:22:29.885 --> 00:22:39.745
There was another one who told Me, who was
giving Realization to these mahantas - mahantas

00:22:39.745 --> 00:22:46.995
are the people who are suppose to be saints
- and every one of them, when they got Realization,

00:22:46.995 --> 00:22:53.094
they got exposed, so he didn't know what to
do with them.

00:22:53.094 --> 00:23:00.164
That may happen with anyone, even in Christian
churches or you go to Jews - everywhere you'll

00:23:00.164 --> 00:23:02.375
find this is the problem.

00:23:02.375 --> 00:23:08.914
If you give them Realization, they'll get
exposed.

00:23:08.914 --> 00:23:18.785
So what's the use of disturbing all the people
who have such faith in them and think they're

00:23:18.785 --> 00:23:21.305
very great people.

00:23:21.305 --> 00:23:26.724
Now only way you can judge them is through
vibrations.

00:23:26.724 --> 00:23:32.765
But out of love, I can't tell them that "You
are not Realized Souls.

00:23:32.765 --> 00:23:38.164
You have no business to talk about Shri Ram
or about Mohammed-sahib.

00:23:38.164 --> 00:23:39.705
They're much beyond you."

00:23:39.705 --> 00:23:52.544
So the problem now is between the people who
are not knowledgeable and those who are knowledgeable.

00:23:52.544 --> 00:23:55.505
It was a very big gap before.

00:23:55.505 --> 00:24:02.755
Only one person used to be a Realized Soul;
so they used to stone him, beat him, do all

00:24:02.755 --> 00:24:04.234
kinds of things.

00:24:04.234 --> 00:24:07.515
Now you are so many.

00:24:07.515 --> 00:24:15.876
So, if you put up your case anywhere, even
at this stage, nobody is going to listen to

00:24:15.876 --> 00:24:16.876
you.

00:24:16.876 --> 00:24:17.876
I would request you only one thing.

00:24:17.876 --> 00:24:27.534
Give Realization to people, as many as possible,
and not to any 'spiritual' so-called people.

00:24:27.534 --> 00:24:30.104
Because they get exposed, what's the use?

00:24:30.104 --> 00:24:33.875
This is a common thing.

00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:38.555
So many people have told Me, "We gave Realization
to one priest.

00:24:38.555 --> 00:24:39.555
He got exposed."

00:24:39.555 --> 00:24:41.815
"Means, what happened?"

00:24:41.815 --> 00:24:43.995
"He was exposed, Mother.

00:24:43.995 --> 00:24:46.714
He was put in jail."

00:24:46.714 --> 00:24:49.445
"Aiy, this is too much.

00:24:49.445 --> 00:24:52.924
After getting Realisation, he goes to jail."

00:24:52.924 --> 00:24:54.234
So this is the problem.

00:24:54.234 --> 00:24:58.865
In love, you cannot be hypocritical about
it.

00:24:58.865 --> 00:25:02.565
Love - you have to be a pure personality.

00:25:02.565 --> 00:25:05.484
Must try to purify yourself.

00:25:05.484 --> 00:25:06.484
You have to change.

00:25:06.484 --> 00:25:13.784
If you are still angry, if you are still greedy,
if you have all these things, love won't work

00:25:13.784 --> 00:25:14.784
out.

00:25:14.784 --> 00:25:15.914
It won't work out.

00:25:15.914 --> 00:25:24.234
So to love someone in a Divine way is to first
understand the value of innocence.

00:25:24.234 --> 00:25:28.044
Why I love children?

00:25:28.044 --> 00:25:30.914
Because they're innocent.

00:25:30.914 --> 00:25:33.085
They don't have all these things.

00:25:33.085 --> 00:25:44.635
Like in our country these days, the epidemic
- epidemic of corruption has started - epidemic.

00:25:44.635 --> 00:25:48.854
It's not simple.

00:25:48.854 --> 00:25:56.745
Anybody you see, after every third person,
there's an epidemic of corruption.

00:25:56.745 --> 00:25:58.495
Now why?

00:25:58.495 --> 00:26:01.995
Because they want money.

00:26:01.995 --> 00:26:03.745
All right.

00:26:03.745 --> 00:26:06.205
Then what do they do with their money?

00:26:06.205 --> 00:26:15.654
They don't know how to hide, so they put it
in some sort of a pot or whatever it is and

00:26:15.654 --> 00:26:19.734
the money gets lost.

00:26:19.734 --> 00:26:21.875
If not, they are caught up.

00:26:21.875 --> 00:26:25.094
That's not so important.

00:26:25.094 --> 00:26:30.495
What's important is, 'Why have this greed?'

00:26:30.495 --> 00:26:38.435
People who are rich are more greedy than the
people who are poor, because the poor people

00:26:38.435 --> 00:26:40.645
at least have some fear of God.

00:26:40.645 --> 00:26:46.005
But the rich are very greedy.

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:49.145
They're running after this, running after
that.

00:26:49.145 --> 00:26:52.085
There's no end to it.

00:26:52.085 --> 00:27:01.025
It is very surprising that in this country
of ours this new disease has started.

00:27:01.025 --> 00:27:07.895
With this disease, even in Sahaja Yoga, there
are some people who have made a business out

00:27:07.895 --> 00:27:11.234
of Sahaj Yoga and making money.

00:27:11.234 --> 00:27:19.685
So greed is something that comes to you from
the right side and you start justifying it.

00:27:19.685 --> 00:27:24.605
There's no place for love for the right side.

00:27:24.605 --> 00:27:37.335
Now this greed has gone so far that the whole
country is getting ruined.

00:27:37.335 --> 00:27:39.435
We can never progress.

00:27:39.435 --> 00:27:45.235
We can never achieve anything because everywhere
there's greed when people are just taking

00:27:45.235 --> 00:27:46.235
it.

00:27:46.235 --> 00:27:55.814
But if you love your country, if you have
love for your country, you won't do it.

00:27:55.814 --> 00:27:58.425
But that love is missing.

00:27:58.425 --> 00:28:02.285
They love - I don't know whom do they love.

00:28:02.285 --> 00:28:08.465
They love their children in such a way that
they ruin their lives.

00:28:08.465 --> 00:28:11.485
Love is not limited.

00:28:11.485 --> 00:28:14.115
Love has to be unlimited.

00:28:14.115 --> 00:28:19.215
Unlimited love which binds the whole world.

00:28:19.215 --> 00:28:30.125
There is this force, there is already acting
this force; only thing you have to become

00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:37.935
the agents of that, to become the people who
can communicate that love.

00:28:37.935 --> 00:28:46.385
You have every right to that great wealth
of love and you can spread that all around.

00:28:46.385 --> 00:28:55.255
But I find that even here people think in
the terms of money.

00:28:55.255 --> 00:28:59.415
Money is the enemy of love.

00:28:59.415 --> 00:29:06.865
I assure you if you have interest in money,
you can never progress in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:06.865 --> 00:29:08.765
I'm hopeless, I agree.

00:29:08.765 --> 00:29:12.285
I don't know how to take interest even.

00:29:12.285 --> 00:29:15.145
What is so interesting about it?

00:29:15.145 --> 00:29:21.765
And people laugh at Me that "You don't know
simple things, even to count the money."

00:29:21.765 --> 00:29:24.025
I said, "I know."

00:29:24.025 --> 00:29:29.175
I can tell you like this, how much money's
there, but I'm not interested.

00:29:29.175 --> 00:29:32.015
There's so many other things to be interested.

00:29:32.015 --> 00:29:33.795
You see the children.

00:29:33.795 --> 00:29:35.814
You see nice, nice people.

00:29:35.814 --> 00:29:42.465
In the whole world, there are so many beautiful
people, beautiful things.

00:29:42.465 --> 00:29:50.064
Why pay so much attention to this useless
stuff, which comes and goes?

00:29:50.064 --> 00:29:58.155
But that is what is the most - I should say
- gripping thing that is also there.

00:29:58.155 --> 00:30:00.125
In India is the worst, I think.

00:30:00.125 --> 00:30:04.985
They say that India is the most corrupt country,
but I don't know.

00:30:04.985 --> 00:30:09.775
I have never seen that kind of thing, but
must be true.

00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:22.995
On such an occasion, it's very auspicious
that you should think that money is of no

00:30:22.995 --> 00:30:34.235
value to you, has no value, and you will be
amazed, you will have never dirth of money

00:30:34.235 --> 00:30:35.235
- absolutely.

00:30:35.235 --> 00:30:47.175
This is one thing in Sahaja Yoga you have
to get, that money is of no value.

00:30:47.175 --> 00:30:52.865
There's no interest in money.

00:30:52.865 --> 00:31:02.435
Your money is in getting how many people you
have in Sahaja Yoga, how many people you have

00:31:02.435 --> 00:31:08.465
brought in Sahaja Yoga, how many people have
got this joy.

00:31:08.465 --> 00:31:13.385
You have not purchased it.

00:31:13.385 --> 00:31:15.304
Nobody has to purchase it.

00:31:15.304 --> 00:31:18.155
It's free, flowing everywhere.

00:31:18.155 --> 00:31:21.005
It's so joy giving.

00:31:21.005 --> 00:31:23.655
What else do you want with money?

00:31:23.655 --> 00:31:24.655
Nothing.

00:31:24.655 --> 00:31:32.875
Just with money - headaches, fear and all
kinds of problems.

00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:50.674
So, parallel to our Sahaja Yoga, it should
be the life of freedom, complete freedom and

00:31:50.674 --> 00:31:56.875
enjoyment, nothing to worry about.

00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:59.954
Nothing is dependent on money.

00:31:59.954 --> 00:32:09.865
I have seen people living in very poor conditions,
extremely happy and joyous; while those who

00:32:09.865 --> 00:32:14.745
have lots of money, especially in the foreign
countries, are rich people.

00:32:14.745 --> 00:32:21.055
They have depression, all kinds of funny,
funny situations there.

00:32:21.055 --> 00:32:23.785
They commit suicides.

00:32:23.785 --> 00:32:24.785
Why?

00:32:24.785 --> 00:32:30.085
If money was everything, why all the rich
country people commit suicide?

00:32:30.085 --> 00:32:32.975
What is the gain they have?

00:32:32.975 --> 00:32:44.785
See, and all the time what they are thinking,
how to get into a kind of a fashion.

00:32:44.785 --> 00:32:52.045
Fashion, because if you have no money, you
cannot get into those fashions.

00:32:52.045 --> 00:32:59.285
The fashions are so common now, so common,
that for that people hanker.

00:32:59.285 --> 00:33:05.545
If they cannot get to the fashions, they think
that something has gone wrong with them, something

00:33:05.545 --> 00:33:10.025
is - But not you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:10.025 --> 00:33:16.275
Now you see these things happening, so what
have you to do?

00:33:16.275 --> 00:33:23.085
Have pity for such people - no contempt, but
pity - and you have to tell them that, "What

00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:24.225
are you doing?

00:33:24.225 --> 00:33:26.495
Why are you wasting your time?

00:33:26.495 --> 00:33:34.935
This is the best time for you to reach the
highest goal of your life, of Self Realization

00:33:34.935 --> 00:33:40.055
and why are you so much running after all
these things?

00:33:40.055 --> 00:33:45.755
What is it that makes you run this rat-race?"

00:33:45.755 --> 00:33:53.505
I think it's a breaking point everywhere and
people are thinking, but you are the people

00:33:53.505 --> 00:33:54.665
who should provide.

00:33:54.665 --> 00:34:00.495
In a very large scale, you can work it out.

00:34:00.495 --> 00:34:03.335
I mean, I have seen people who have nothing
in them.

00:34:03.335 --> 00:34:05.184
They are not spiritual.

00:34:05.184 --> 00:34:09.165
They are not the ones who can give Realization
or anything.

00:34:09.165 --> 00:34:17.174
But just because they are doing some social
work, they are very famous.

00:34:17.174 --> 00:34:19.137
What is the social work?

00:34:19.137 --> 00:34:22.405
Looking after the poor or something like that.

00:34:22.405 --> 00:34:33.806
Now, when your love, which is so great, which
is so effective, that starts working, you

00:34:33.806 --> 00:34:45.215
feel you should do something, then you'll
be amazed how your Sahaja Yoga will be understood.

00:34:45.215 --> 00:34:52.885
So far Sahaja Yoga is all right, people are
very nice, excellent, saintly and all.

00:34:52.885 --> 00:35:01.375
But effect of that must be seen and people
should see the effect of that, of your love.

00:35:01.375 --> 00:35:04.335
First is forgiveness.

00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:05.545
You have to forgive people.

00:35:05.545 --> 00:35:07.695
They are utterly stupid.

00:35:07.695 --> 00:35:14.095
I have just now explained to you how stupid
they are.

00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:17.265
So, nothing to worry about that.

00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:26.324
If you are such a wise personality, you should
try to judge everything with wisdom and don't

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:38.814
fall a trap into things where you feel that
you have to do it like some fashion or some

00:35:38.814 --> 00:35:42.485
sort of a - I should say what?

00:35:42.485 --> 00:35:43.845
- some grouping.

00:35:43.845 --> 00:35:47.905
No need, we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:47.905 --> 00:35:49.935
We are self-sufficient.

00:35:49.935 --> 00:35:51.684
We don't need anything.

00:35:51.684 --> 00:35:54.915
If you are one, we are all right.

00:35:54.915 --> 00:35:57.415
If you are many, we are all right.

00:35:57.415 --> 00:36:06.275
Now you must know that you have reached a
very high state and you have touched that

00:36:06.275 --> 00:36:10.335
love, that Universal Love of God.

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:16.615
So express more of that love in your daily
life.

00:36:16.615 --> 00:36:21.565
Express more of that love in dealing with
others.

00:36:21.565 --> 00:36:26.735
Express your love in a way that others are
made happy.

00:36:26.735 --> 00:36:31.365
It's all something to be thought of.

00:36:31.365 --> 00:36:34.304
How can you quarrel if you are real Sahaja
Yogis?

00:36:34.304 --> 00:36:38.285
How can you put down others if they are Sahaja
Yogis?

00:36:38.285 --> 00:36:40.377
How can you deceive others if you are Sahaja
Yogis?

00:36:40.377 --> 00:36:41.377
Not possible.

00:36:41.377 --> 00:36:47.835
You should have no interest in all these things.

00:36:47.835 --> 00:36:56.975
That means now you are clarified and you are
clear and you are now Nirmal.

00:36:56.975 --> 00:36:59.145
Nobody can touch you.

00:36:59.145 --> 00:37:05.215
This sort of attitude, should have respect
for yourself.

00:37:05.215 --> 00:37:11.625
This kind of understanding you should have
about yourself.

00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:12.975
What is your role?

00:37:12.975 --> 00:37:14.324
What is your position?

00:37:14.324 --> 00:37:26.174
You should know that you are Realized Souls
and what you should do as Realized Soul that

00:37:26.174 --> 00:37:27.174
you should know.

00:37:27.174 --> 00:37:37.195
You are not another sort of madman running
the rat race or also you're not in competition.

00:37:37.195 --> 00:37:41.935
You're not competitive.

00:37:41.935 --> 00:37:50.064
You are just progressing by your own love
and blessings.

00:37:50.064 --> 00:37:53.225
I know how the blessings work.

00:37:53.225 --> 00:38:01.574
But first of all, you have to be worthy of
that blessing, otherwise - can't help it.

00:38:01.574 --> 00:38:03.895
Your loving nature.

00:38:03.895 --> 00:38:15.944
That's why Christ has said that you have to
be like children to enter into the Kingdom

00:38:15.944 --> 00:38:17.684
of God.

00:38:17.684 --> 00:38:24.814
You are already in the Kingdom of God, but
you have to be like children; how innocent

00:38:24.814 --> 00:38:32.865
they are, how simple they are and they're
happy with small, small things.

00:38:32.865 --> 00:38:36.235
They don't want something very extraordinary.

00:38:36.235 --> 00:38:48.595
It's very surprising how our love, which is
actually, is enlightened by Divine Love, can

00:38:48.595 --> 00:38:52.005
change the whole world.

00:38:52.005 --> 00:39:00.375
How I had this idea and how it has prospered.

00:39:00.375 --> 00:39:10.225
If you all help Me in this, I'm sure Sahaja
Yoga can do so many things, which have not

00:39:10.225 --> 00:39:11.255
been achieved.

00:39:11.255 --> 00:39:16.355
Now you go home and think whatever I have
told you.

00:39:16.355 --> 00:39:17.885
Think about it.

00:39:17.885 --> 00:39:20.444
What you need is introspection.

00:39:20.444 --> 00:39:21.885
What you need is understanding.

00:39:21.885 --> 00:39:26.795
"What have I done out of my life as Sahaja
Yogis?"

00:39:26.795 --> 00:39:33.554
And then you will find out that you can do
a lot, a lot.

00:39:33.554 --> 00:39:36.544
And that has to be done.

00:39:36.544 --> 00:39:38.534
May God bless you.
