00:15.652 --> 00:17.996
Of course I’ve told you about the egg now,

00:18.164 --> 00:26.313
now you have become the chickens already.
Only you have to grow, that’s all.

00:27.887 --> 00:31.914
Breaking so many eggs every day, isn’t it?

00:34.687 --> 00:37.758
Easter is something like our birthday
we celebrate;

00:37.959 --> 00:45.332
when we became a bird out of the cage,
of the shell.

00:45.533 --> 00:51.726
So Easter is our birthday we
are celebrating, of our Realization,

00:51.927 --> 00:55.587
and every day we must grow with
our birthday.

00:55.788 --> 01:03.867
While in a human form you decrease your
age, as your birthday comes in,

01:04.068 --> 01:11.111
but with this you increase your age, and
you are proud that you are growing.

01:11.312 --> 01:17.122
On a human level you feel unhappy that
you are growing.

01:17.751 --> 01:20.364
Here you feel proud that you are growing.

01:20.565 --> 01:27.265
Just the opposite of what you are doing
if you try to do it, it will be nice.

01:29.568 --> 01:32.297
I mean, that doesn’t mean again indiscreet,
you know?

01:32.498 --> 01:35.744
I’m quite worried on that point.

01:35.945 --> 01:39.837
Discretion is the first thing that you
should have before you.
