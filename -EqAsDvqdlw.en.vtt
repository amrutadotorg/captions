00:00.001 --> 00:00.880
Public Program  25 April 2001
Lütfi Kirdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey)

00:00.905 --> 00:05.632
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:15.209 --> 00:18.981
I have been coming to Turkey in the last ten years.

00:22.846 --> 00:30.771
And I found this place is so much filled with spirituality.

00:36.534 --> 00:40.381
Perhaps we have had so many Sufis here,

00:42.470 --> 00:48.357
must be something in this country
is that there were so many Sufis were created.

00:55.126 --> 01:00.075
And I have read about them and
I have read about Rumi and all others.

01:00.265 --> 01:06.449
And I find they described the qualities of a Sufi

01:06.593 --> 01:10.828
the state of his mind, very beautiful.

01:30.132 --> 01:34.760
But they didn't say how created, how to became Sufis.

01:40.461 --> 01:45.973
They described of course  very well
and absolutely  truthfully

01:46.235 --> 01:50.134
whatever was the achievement.

01:59.283 --> 02:03.857
But nobody could say that how they achieved it.

02:09.909 --> 02:18.271
Even in the Kuran you see how Muhammed Sahab has described

02:18.462 --> 02:24.851
that he went through seventh heavens  on a white horse.

02:34.610 --> 02:38.261
He was a poet and the whole thing was so poetic.

02:43.515 --> 02:46.508
The white horse was this Kundalini.

02:49.839 --> 02:54.937
The more you will know about Kundalini
you will see how poetically

02:55.009 --> 02:59.906
He had described all these seven heavens he crossed over.

03:15.159 --> 03:20.663
So, unless and until you are self realized soul

03:21.005 --> 03:23.671
as he has said "know thy self".

03:23.821 --> 03:29.622
Unless and until you know your self
you can not understand any one of this scriptures.

03:45.883 --> 03:52.110
They say, all of them say the same thing
in different ways and also in poetry.

04:02.139 --> 04:07.172
And it is difficult for common people to understand.

04:14.438 --> 04:22.715
In no way there is difference in the
explanations of all these scriptures,

04:22.835 --> 04:25.493
they are just the same.

04:36.063 --> 04:39.655
Then there is no question of people fighting

04:39.995 --> 04:43.694
because there is no difference  what they are fighting for.

04:53.881 --> 05:00.703
But  problem was one individual gets the self realization

05:00.947 --> 05:05.411
and the others don’t understand
they torture that person.

05:18.167 --> 05:20.602
As you know Christ was crucified

05:20.715 --> 05:25.003
and all the saints, all the sages were tortured.

05:35.837 --> 05:40.378
Even in China there was this Tao.

05:40.521 --> 05:43.379
It was the same thing as Sahaja Yoga

05:43.515 --> 05:47.184
but it was written in such a manner

05:47.251 --> 05:53.365
that people could not understand it or
I think couldn't take it what it was written.

06:04.165 --> 06:14.545
Also I find in Japan,Vidittama is a deciple of
(mahatma welcome book.Gautam Budda)

06:14.912 --> 06:17.810
He said the same things,

06:17.946 --> 06:22.589
he tried to practice Sahaja Yoga through
various methods

06:22.734 --> 06:27.079
all was nothing but Kundalini awakening.

06:51.849 --> 06:59.365
Now the thing is of understanding
then go to any limit of stupitidies.

07:08.471 --> 07:13.711
There was a great poet called Kabir in India

07:19.933 --> 07:25.176
and whatever he told was so much
misunderstood by people

07:25.338 --> 07:31.459
that you can not imagine
what interpretations they do.

07:43.666 --> 07:51.810
He says in one  poetry that my beloved
went away and  I  did not  cry.

08:01.364 --> 08:05.465
Now people think beloved means a lover.

08:05.788 --> 08:10.397
It is what he was meaning was a life  life went away.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.357
But, I did not cry,   I didn't say anything.

08:24.952 --> 08:28.013
So he was saying about the death

08:28.219 --> 08:33.996
while people all these thinks it is some sort of
a beloved he is talking about.

08:45.339 --> 08:49.680
Thus you see, we have problems, of people fighting

08:49.705 --> 08:54.641
who said they are fighting is a name of religion.

09:04.371 --> 09:10.313
To understand they have  first you take your self realization.

09:16.464 --> 09:18.982
You have to know yourself.

09:19.712 --> 09:22.756
Unless and until you know yourself

09:22.781 --> 09:27.841
how will you understand the subtle ideas they want to look forward.

09:41.138 --> 09:46.825
So whatever they have told you about
the Kundalini it is a fact,

09:47.385 --> 09:51.603
it is a fact and  resides within you in the triangular bone.

10:03.010 --> 10:08.718
You could be a Muslim you could be a Hindu
you could be a Christian anything.

10:09.330 --> 10:12.760
Even people from Africa came.

10:12.798 --> 10:16.957
They were black, some were white, some were yellow,

10:17.002 --> 10:21.343
all of them have got this Kundalini within them.

10:35.928 --> 10:39.237
As  God has created us the same.

10:39.280 --> 10:46.592
we all have noses, hands everything,
everywhere whatever languages we may speak.

10:56.440 --> 11:01.680
Now, Sahaja means, saha means "with" and ja  "born with you".

11:02.069 --> 11:07.341
The right to get this yoga, union with the divine, the ruh.

11:20.538 --> 11:23.546
You all have this right

11:23.667 --> 11:26.330
and now it is going to work out

11:26.355 --> 11:30.901
that you have to know yourself through the Kundalini awakening.

11:43.093 --> 11:47.561
All this may be not written in those books.

11:47.586 --> 11:50.188
Perhaps that was not the time to write

11:50.227 --> 11:55.099
or maybe these books were written after long time

11:55.197 --> 11:58.674
after the prophet went away, Christ die in all that.

11:58.694 --> 12:02.210
So there are certain sacrifice you see.

12:18.275 --> 12:25.285
But it is a fact that, you whole have,
all of you have this power within you,

12:25.310 --> 12:29.909
this energy within you which we call as Kundalini.

12:39.747 --> 12:41.571
It has been proved now

12:41.610 --> 12:45.001
because wherever I have gone many countries

12:45.028 --> 12:49.991
various type of people were there
and they all got their realization.

12:59.573 --> 13:04.218
Especially in Turkey is a very dear country to me

13:04.253 --> 13:08.516
because of so many people who were here

13:08.548 --> 13:13.248
and  who  were  spiritually so equipped

13:13.397 --> 13:17.882
they might call themselves  as Sufis,
I mean Sufi means [UNCLEAR].

13:29.719 --> 13:34.599
So it cleanses, means this Kundalini rising

13:34.674 --> 13:39.469
cleanses you of your problems, of your enemies.

13:52.670 --> 13:55.090
Because it connects you

13:55.344 --> 13:59.309
to the all pervading power which we call as Ruh

13:59.380 --> 14:05.685
and all your personality absolutely
get absorbed with the truth.

14:21.736 --> 14:26.653
The first thing that happens to you when she rises,

14:26.722 --> 14:32.737
sometimes it is you just  become thoughtlessly aware.

14:44.155 --> 14:48.472
The thoughts come to us because we react.

14:48.732 --> 14:52.779
We see something immediately we react.

15:02.798 --> 15:09.853
We react according to our ego or maybe
according to our conditioning.

15:18.327 --> 15:23.581
But when the Kundalini she rises and
crosses this center upward

15:23.592 --> 15:26.322
then your thoughts stop.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.762
Then you become a witness.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.986
You witness without thinking.

15:54.004 --> 15:56.925
Thought  rises then falls

15:56.950 --> 16:00.786
then another thought comes up, rises and falls.

16:09.916 --> 16:13.505
There is a space, very little space in between

16:13.529 --> 16:16.152
but we cannot see that space,

16:16.185 --> 16:18.859
we can not in there  that space.

16:29.963 --> 16:35.759
Now these thoughts who are all the time [UNCLEAR]
hoovering  in your head

16:35.784 --> 16:38.721
and our  mind cruise or jumping on them

16:38.764 --> 16:42.051
doesn’t allow us to be in the present

16:42.076 --> 16:45.960
because they come from the past and from the future.

17:05.995 --> 17:10.280
So we cannot be in the present.

17:14.488 --> 17:19.298
Past is finished it does not exist
and the future is no more,

17:19.461 --> 17:24.296
so what we have to do is to stay in the present.

17:36.546 --> 17:40.313
And in the present is the reality, is the truth.

17:46.200 --> 17:49.297
That is how we can not enjoying.

17:54.376 --> 17:58.939
For example, I see a very beautiful carpet here,
very beautiful

17:58.979 --> 18:01.348
and I start reacting on it

18:01.381 --> 18:06.830
and then I start thinking of how much is that  cost,

18:06.936 --> 18:09.763
can I have it, all things is possible.

18:21.769 --> 18:24.316
but I can not watch it.

18:27.227 --> 18:29.266
Because I can not watch it

18:29.299 --> 18:33.952
the joy that  is put by the artist  in the sight
I can not enjoy it.

18:45.554 --> 18:47.724
So when this Kundalini rises

18:47.749 --> 18:53.883
what she does,  she elongates those toughts
there is a space   between a  thought.

19:04.918 --> 19:10.735
So we can see everything without thinking and enjoy fully.

19:20.937 --> 19:24.315
And with this enjoyment we get peace,

19:24.340 --> 19:26.350
complete peace.

19:35.304 --> 19:38.986
We do not agress others, we enjoy others.

19:48.227 --> 19:50.911
They have  many peace conferences

19:50.936 --> 19:55.032
but those who are having the conference have no peace within –

19:55.057 --> 19:57.955
then what is the use of having the conference?

20:09.461 --> 20:13.146
We have six enemies within us at least

20:13.219 --> 20:15.767
which are all the time torturing us.

20:24.125 --> 20:28.132
They are described in the Sanskrit language very beautifully

20:28.198 --> 20:30.565
but I will tell them, that's now [UNCLEAR].

20:40.699 --> 20:42.944
First is the anger.

20:45.755 --> 20:48.195
That is so common,

20:48.220 --> 20:51.237
comes out of  so much of conditioning

20:51.262 --> 20:53.589
may be so much of ego.

21:02.903 --> 21:05.174
Then the perversion,

21:05.206 --> 21:11.948
perversion of sex or
all kinds of dirty things people do it.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.680
Then we have false pride,

21:31.819 --> 21:34.286
now we have jealousy

21:36.172 --> 21:38.420
we have attachments.

21:42.173 --> 21:45.665
People are corrupt because
they are attached to their children,

21:45.720 --> 21:49.478
they want to make money for them,
so  they are corrupt.

22:02.291 --> 22:04.044
And we have  also attraction.

22:04.069 --> 22:07.998
We are attracted supposing somebody is attracted,

22:08.015 --> 22:13.050
say towards good clothes somebody attracted or good house

22:13.114 --> 22:15.226
attractions.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.127
We cannot explain.

22:35.192 --> 22:38.159
We cannot explain why we do that.

22:43.251 --> 22:47.182
Why we suffer from all these enemies we don't know.

22:52.781 --> 22:57.313
Once you become the spirit,

22:57.338 --> 23:00.839
spirit drops out everything,

23:00.852 --> 23:03.719
it is so clear, so clean,

23:03.744 --> 23:08.297
and  what is the spirit is the reflection of God in our heart.

23:24.382 --> 23:27.310
The spirit , that is within you.

23:27.335 --> 23:33.316
once it  enlightens you, you become such a wonderful person,

23:33.348 --> 23:38.261
such a nice person and you develop this spirituality.

23:51.284 --> 23:55.188
What, actually what happens is

23:55.215 --> 23:57.738
that when  Kundalini rises

23:57.765 --> 24:02.514
your spirit starts emitting vibrations

24:02.570 --> 24:07.262
spiritual vibrations on your central nervous system.

24:19.526 --> 24:25.043
And you start feeling cool breeze on your hands

24:25.125 --> 24:27.912
out of your fontanel bone area.

24:41.624 --> 24:46.095
And then this  fingers which represent

24:46.206 --> 24:51.008
the centers within you  starts speaking telling you
what's wrong and what's kind.

25:07.375 --> 25:12.790
Also they tell you about others,
what is wrong with the others.

25:21.979 --> 25:25.724
This connection with the divine
gives you this blessing

25:25.749 --> 25:29.392
that you  know what is wrong with you
and what is wrong with others.

25:43.871 --> 25:46.422
Even the doctors will not tell you,

25:46.469 --> 25:50.773
nobody can tell you, just now on your fingertips

26:01.684 --> 26:07.327
So in the Kuran it says at the time of kıyam
your hands will speak.

26:15.152 --> 26:19.104
So this is the kiyam time, kiyamat is different.

26:19.129 --> 26:21.353
[UNCLEAR]

26:21.394 --> 26:22.941
Kıyamat and kıyama

26:27.909 --> 26:32.464
Kyam because this is the last judgement.

26:37.195 --> 26:42.839
Those who do not accept their self realisation,

26:42.932 --> 26:49.584
and who don't get into the heavenly bliss of divinity,

26:49.665 --> 26:54.231
they go to hell – that is the wisdom.

27:04.647 --> 27:09.014
So, for you it is important that your hands must speak

27:09.039 --> 27:11.818
and tell you about you and others.

27:22.180 --> 27:25.817
That is how you are mussulman, otherwise you are not.

27:32.255 --> 27:34.979
If your hands do not speak

27:35.004 --> 27:38.070
than you are not a mussulman in surrendering.

27:45.286 --> 27:48.353
It`s all said, it is all written in the Quran

27:48.373 --> 27:53.176
but once you be  able to read it after
you have got your realization.

28:03.779 --> 28:06.779
It is high time that you should realize

28:06.811 --> 28:10.384
that we  have been following something so much

28:10.417 --> 28:12.870
and why is it we are in trouble,

28:12.910 --> 28:17.989
why we have not been able to achieve whatever is promised.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.938
It is something missing

28:34.971 --> 28:38.617
that so far we have not been able to

28:38.649 --> 28:41.111
achieve what is doing promised.

29:05.575 --> 29:08.956
You all can have your self realization.

29:12.813 --> 29:17.162
Don’t have any fear about it and some

29:17.203 --> 29:20.141
sort of funny ideas about it.

29:27.626 --> 29:31.974
Because whatever will happen, you will feel it.

29:38.631 --> 29:41.083
It`s not something imaginary.

29:45.468 --> 29:47.571
It’s the actualization.

29:51.465 --> 29:55.864
To the Christians I say this actualization of  baptism.

30:04.869 --> 30:09.472
So, it's your chance now all of you so many have  come

30:09.544 --> 30:11.917
to have that self realization.

30:21.501 --> 30:25.564
It was prophesied that it will happen collectively.

30:31.832 --> 30:34.220
And so, you all deserve it.

30:34.245 --> 30:35.911
And you should have it.

30:35.950 --> 30:38.973
Because İt is what  is promised.

30:47.744 --> 30:50.084
So ultimately what happens

30:50.109 --> 30:53.079
that you jump in the ocean of joy.

30:59.601 --> 31:02.498
You become powerfull.

31:05.639 --> 31:07.495
But you don't have ego.

31:09.615 --> 31:14.213
And you know how you get help others

31:14.246 --> 31:17.499
and yourself and help the family.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.253
All of you can get  it.

31:31.974 --> 31:38.500
I mean those who want can all get it ,
it can't be forced [UNCLEAR].

31:46.572 --> 31:53.702
Thus you will know what you are and also what othes are.

32:02.244 --> 32:05.878
Many people have  been cured in sahaja yoga, no doubt.

32:05.966 --> 32:09.021
We also have a hospital in India.

32:19.262 --> 32:24.603
Where people are cured without any medicine
with their own vibrations.

32:34.162 --> 32:39.638
Moreover mentally there are so many people
who have been cured.

32:46.951 --> 32:49.484
And your problems are solved.

32:49.509 --> 32:54.111
Because you get out  of your problems.

33:01.530 --> 33:07.601
Will be amazed how miraculously
you achieve such small small things

33:07.626 --> 33:10.660
which really look great [UNCLEAR] to begin with.

33:20.770 --> 33:25.587
Every human being has a right  to get self realization.

33:31.228 --> 33:36.839
All negative forces and energies  just
drop out and run away.

33:44.994 --> 33:50.279
Just like whether light comes in all darkness goes away.

33:56.316 --> 33:58.602
It sometimes  people don't believe.

33:58.627 --> 34:03.344
Because, they don't think they are
capable of getting self realization.

34:13.924 --> 34:18.392
But, I am sure tonight you will learn what you are.

34:25.213 --> 34:30.260
Will be absolutely relaxed person and

34:30.292 --> 34:35.212
the whole being  will be filled with joy and divine love.

34:45.959 --> 34:50.284
It's not because of me, it's because of you.

34:55.363 --> 35:04.167
You have once you have what only
I have to open the window here.

35:11.581 --> 35:14.970
That to you do because It is your desire,

35:15.010 --> 35:18.805
to become your pure desire to be.

35:27.807 --> 35:31.219
Otherwise no other desire is pure.

35:36.286 --> 35:42.936
All economics is based on one point
that no human desire is complete.

35:53.520 --> 35:58.202
Today you want  to have one thing then
you want to have another thing.

36:03.363 --> 36:07.045
And you are never satisfied.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.818
But this  is pure desire.

36:13.083 --> 36:18.885
Kundalini is the energy of pure desire
because the desire of our Almighty

36:27.413 --> 36:31.225
So, when you get your realization,

36:31.285 --> 36:37.078
you feel absolutely satisfied and
enjoy whatever you have.

36:47.647 --> 36:52.243
And also you enjoy others and their things

36:52.467 --> 36:56.459
without thinking that they don't belong to you.

37:10.035 --> 37:12.646
The whole panorama changes

37:12.654 --> 37:18.709
and you become a very universal personality.

37:26.123 --> 37:28.869
You really become global

37:28.957 --> 37:34.306
and everybody who is in sahaja yoga are such great friends.

37:45.311 --> 37:53.148
I'll give an example that
Palestinians were fighting Israelis

37:53.301 --> 37:57.970
and one of the Israeli fellow, telephoned  to me

37:58.031 --> 38:05.277
that Mother we have some Sahaja Yogis
in  the  one of the villages of  Palestine.

38:17.994 --> 38:23.563
They were friends,  despite the fact that
[UNCLEAR] is fighting, countries were fighting.

38:23.604 --> 38:27.307
But they were Sahaja Yogis,
so they were friends they are friends.

38:42.281 --> 38:48.489
So this Israilian knew that
they are going to drop a big bomb

38:48.553 --> 38:53.135
in a particular village and he told me that
please pay  attention Mother

38:53.176 --> 38:55.853
I don't want  people to be killed  there.

39:09.837 --> 39:15.043
I give pay attention and they never drop the bomb.

39:20.707 --> 39:24.881
Love is the most powerful thing human beings have all.

39:31.094 --> 39:33.522
We have never used it.

39:33.647 --> 39:38.793
We have always use hatred to over power others.

39:46.757 --> 39:50.534
We have never used love.

39:54.211 --> 39:59.950
There is divine love allover  allover the world
that's why we are existing .

40:06.422 --> 40:10.167
You have to just become one within that's all.

40:16.271 --> 40:20.731
It's allover, it is called Ruh , It's allover.

40:20.756 --> 40:23.209
But we have not yet felt.

40:31.178 --> 40:35.638
But today is now, you have the time to feel it.

40:41.390 --> 40:44.858
For that you don’t have to concentrate or do anything,

40:44.891 --> 40:47.398
it will  just work automatically.

40:57.403 --> 41:00.140
Have faith in yourself.

41:02.766 --> 41:05.528
Do not condemn yourself.

41:10.751 --> 41:13.100
This will change the whole world.

41:13.179 --> 41:17.353
Once they realize that there is divine love
which [UNCLEAR] us.

41:29.375 --> 41:33.049
So, the first state is thoughtless awareness

41:33.082 --> 41:40.546
and the second state  is what we called
as the doubtless awareness.

41:56.110 --> 41:59.577
That state comes to people automatically

41:59.586 --> 42:03.955
sometimes together and they have no doubts about it.

42:13.317 --> 42:15.404
It works that way.

42:15.429 --> 42:21.097
It doesn't give you any doubts anymore
you are sure this is what it is.

42:32.430 --> 42:34.938
Today somebody came to see me

42:34.979 --> 42:37.457
he used to perspire and hot.

42:37.482 --> 42:41.542
And I saw him, he had  problem with his heart,

42:41.567 --> 42:44.177
to  look working very hard.

42:58.059 --> 43:01.482
I raised his Kundalini,  he got his realization

43:01.507 --> 43:03.308
his perspiration stopped.

43:12.670 --> 43:17.796
So I told him that you should forgive,

43:17.805 --> 43:21.459
forgive others and that worked.

43:29.709 --> 43:35.137
And this young fellow would have been very seriously ill

43:35.162 --> 43:38.707
or dead by that kind of a  heart.

43:48.770 --> 43:53.566
So you get an awareness which is doubtless.

44:03.819 --> 44:08.685
So all those who want to have their self realization

44:08.710 --> 44:09.884
please stay on.

44:09.909 --> 44:12.916
If you don't want to have
should live the hall.

44:23.151 --> 44:28.880
One thing, you should not, you cannot pay for spirituality.

44:33.799 --> 44:38.601
There are many false people
who are doing all  kinds of nonsense,

44:38.650 --> 44:42.399
only thing is you must take  to your self realization.

44:54.843 --> 44:57.954
So that you all become Sufis.

45:01.796 --> 45:04.121
You don't have to give up everything.

45:04.146 --> 45:07.631
Or you don’t have to become an ascetic,

45:14.411 --> 45:16.461
and I am a married  woman,

45:16.510 --> 45:21.179
I have for  children, I have for  grandchildren
and I have got  their grandchildren .

45:28.051 --> 45:32.441
But I am what I am.

45:36.227 --> 45:38.869
That’s what should happen to you.

45:43.569 --> 45:45.481
So again I would request

45:45.506 --> 45:49.762
those who don’t want have  their
self realization to  leave the hall.

45:53.800 --> 45:57.315
Like this, like this, just like this. Yes.

46:02.737 --> 46:05.062
Now  close your eyes.

46:07.219 --> 46:08.821
Please close.

46:13.972 --> 46:18.672
See If you are feeling cool breeze on your fingertips

46:40.731 --> 46:44.700

46:46.609 --> 46:49.466
and put the right hand

46:49.516 --> 46:55.926
bend your head and put the right hand
against the fontenella bone area

46:55.942 --> 46:58.809
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

47:13.510 --> 47:16.895
See if you this coming  on the left hand,

47:20.182 --> 47:24.446
little it should be above the head not on  top,

47:27.838 --> 47:29.998
bend your head and see for yourself.

47:30.238 --> 47:32.231
Move your hand and see for yourself.

47:42.816 --> 47:45.746
Now please put your right hand towards me,

47:48.433 --> 47:50.949
not touching the head above

47:51.134 --> 47:53.594
left hand on the top of your head.

47:53.692 --> 48:00.634
All those who have felt cool or
hot breeze on their fingertips

48:00.636 --> 48:05.427
or in the palm or upper to fontanel bone area,

48:05.467 --> 48:07.879
