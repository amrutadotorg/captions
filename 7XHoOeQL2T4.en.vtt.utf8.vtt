00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:20.020
I am really over-delighted that in France
we have so many visitors as well as French

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.970
Sahaja Yogis for this Puja. That shows the
collectivity. The collectivity which attracts

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:38.700
all of you from all over the places, and that
you try to enjoy that collectivity. But the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:54.550
basis of collectivity, the foundation of collectivity
is very deep. And the deep understanding can

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:11.000
only tell you that the basis of collectivity
is detached love. Love is the only way. It's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.520
not possible to have collectivity unless and
until you have detached love. French have

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:32.770
been good at so many types of love that they
have been talking about. And they have written

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.350
books after books, novels after novels and
have created lots of romantic and unromantic

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:53.009
and all kinds of atmospheres to talk of love.
But the pure love as we understand in Sahaja

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:03.700
Yoga is to be now expressed by Sahaja Yogis
among themselves.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:21.000
After all, we are all human beings made by
one God. And that we are all Sahaja Yogis

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:35.920
created by one Mother. So there should be
no misunderstanding between us of any kind.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:47.820
But we must know what sometimes makes us little
different. If we can understand the problems

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:59.320
that we face, then it would be much easier
for us to see why our love becomes so attached

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:12.540
and not so detached. Starts becoming smaller
and smaller, then a person just starts loving

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:28.460
oneself only. One of the main reasons that
we have this problem is because of our conditionings.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:36.820
We are conditioned the way that we don't know
how to love.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:46.620
When I see the advertisements in the West,
I don't know from where the West starts and

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.450
where it ends and from where the East ends.
They talk of West and East, but I don't know

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:01.430
which is the demarcating line. Can anybody
tell Me that? Where do we start East and West,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:11.870
because it's one round world, you see? (Laughter)
But somehow or other there is some line, unknown

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:23.030
line, underlying line which creates sometimes
this East and West - two types of conditionings.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:38.139
So, when I see some advertisements they show
about, recently I saw, about James Bond that

00:04:38.139 --> 00:05:00.230
he is free to kill and the best film for revenge
- this is the advertisement. If revenge is

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:10.900
the best way of fulfillment, then how can
we love someone? So, this kind of conditioning

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:24.030
comes to us from outside. That we should not
forgive anyone, we should take the revenge.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:33.250
And if you do not take the revenge then you
are not worthy your name. So, if you cannot

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:40.389
take the revenge, like a duel that they used
to have in France quite a lot between the

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:46.960
two persons. They would take two guns and
kill each other. I mean, what a stupid idea

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.290
it was! Just think of it in modern times.
But it was so.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:06:05.650
So, if the revenge is not taken then it was
thought to be something very sly, very low

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:18.730
level. So, a person must take revenge. History
shows also the same things that one had to

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:32.780
take a revenge of another person who has harmed
you in any way, troubled you. I think it's

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:40.930
the quality of a snake, they say. That if
you step onto any snake, it follows you all

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:49.260
his life to take the revenge. The only thing
that it does all its life is to run after

00:06:49.260 --> 00:07:00.930
that person who has by mistake put the foot
on its body. In the same way a human endeavor,

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:09.320
I have seen in so many novels it's suggested
how a man gets after a person who has some

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:25.020
way or other harmed. If we go on like this,
there's no end to it. Firstly, it is absolutely

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.930
absurd.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:35.199
For that, I will give you an example of Buddha,
very much I have been impressed by the way

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:42.139
He said once to somebody who insulted Him
and abused Him and said all kinds of horrible

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:51.650
words. Then Buddha went to another village.
Now, this fellow felt the remorse and he went

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:58.930
back, and back, and said, "Sir, I'm sorry.
I have said these things to you. I'm really

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:08.300
very sorry." He said, "What? When?" He said,
"Yesterday." He said, "Yesterday is finished

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:18.070
now. You are now with Me today. So, why are
you talking about yesterday? It's finished."

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:25.639
So, with this kind of idea that somebody has
harmed us, somebody is horrid to us we linger

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:29.990
on in the past.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:46.950
Now, I'm told they are celebrating the French
Revolution that took place. If you ask Me

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.830
there was no need to have revolution of that
kind to kill Marie Antoinette. It was not

00:08:52.830 --> 00:09:00.450
necessary. If they had killed or not killed,
it would have been all right. But they had

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:10.800
to kill her. Why? Because according to them
she spent lot of money in Versailles and created

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.250
some beautiful furniture. Today only they
are showing that furniture only. What is there

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:24.320
to show in this France? As soon as you come,
they say, "Have you seen her palace?" I said,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:24.890
"Really?"

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:31.570
First time when I came to France, this was
the first question. "You must go and see this.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:36.540
Impossible, you cannot get such beautiful
things anywhere created. It's an impossible

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.880
situation." I said, "Impossible?" "Yes, because
you cannot make such nice things."

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:48.860
She made such nice beautiful things. She was
not going to carry it with her. Now, when

00:09:48.860 --> 00:10:00.130
you murdered her, then you ask Me to go and
see those beautiful things. We have to learn

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:06.140
from history that it was stupid to kill her.
What was the need to kill her? When you have

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:12.580
taken over the government, all right, stop
at that point and then you start governing.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:19.080
With that revolution you think world has improved
for us? Anywhere in the world, do you think

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:34.540
things have improved? Also, the 
revolution should have been to change the
government. All right! But to go to that limit

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:36.100
was not necessary.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:44.140
So, the second conditioning that comes to
us that we cross all limits of humanity when

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:50.260
we take revenge. They would not have been
satisfied that she was still living. "Oh God,

00:10:50.260 --> 00:11:02.830
we have to kill her!" Of course, I don't say
that somebody who has done any harm to the

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:13.470
country, to the nation, should be allowed
to go on like that. But how far you go with

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:22.370
that is to be seen. So, the wisdom of Sahaja
Yoga is in understanding the limitations up

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:32.270
to which you can go to express your anger,
to express your revenge, so called, on anyone

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:45.209
whatsoever. But the best thing would be to
leave it to the Divine power, because everything

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:54.459
is done by Divine power. We all exist inside
the Divine power. We cannot think of anything

00:11:54.459 --> 00:12:02.810
else of that kind. I cannot give you an analogy
how Divine power works. For example, if there

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:14.690
were no rays of the sun coming out of the
sun, staying inside the sun, and all things

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:24.899
working out, then we would have said, "It's
something like Divine power." Nothing is outside

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:34.060
that, everything is inside. And this Divine
power is the power of compassion and love,

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:44.610
which does everything. But when we take up
responsibility, and when we decide we have

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:55.290
to do something, and that we are something,
and try to go against that Divine power, we

00:12:55.290 --> 00:13:04.950
become stupid people as we have seen. So,
to leave it in the hands of Divine power,

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:15.450
and to be just an instrument of that Divine
power is the way a Sahaja Yogi has to be.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:25.810
Because the compassion, the love of Divine
power is so great that it is wisdom, complete

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:35.740
wisdom. A person who has no compassion cannot
be wise. He could be worldly wise but he could

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:50.540
not be really wise. So, those who believe
that they have to be - they have to be very

00:13:50.540 --> 00:14:08.910
accurate must know that your accuracy will
be challenged by the Divine power. There has

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:21.430
to be lot of relaxed and a mobile temperament
a person should have.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:30.040
For example, now I have come, suddenly perhaps
you were not told, people were not ready absolutely

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:41.980
in the formal manner, lined up together like
a military. It's all right, makes no difference.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:52.959
Makes no difference. I am in no way disturbed,
no way unhappy. I was very happy to see you

00:14:52.959 --> 00:15:02.000
all. Because after all, you all love Me and
I love you. It's a family and there's nothing

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.810
like being very formal about things. No formality
between you and God Almighty, there cannot

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:27.550
be. But there has to be understanding as to
what we are doing. I find suddenly human beings

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:43.779
either become extremely relaxed, extremely
lazy, extremely confused.

00:15:43.779 --> 00:15:53.589
You ask them their name, they'll say ten times,
"Ah ... Ah". I said, "What's your name?" They

00:15:53.589 --> 00:16:07.440
will say, "Ah ...". "I just asked your name."
"What You asked me, my name?" "Yes, your name."

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.630
"Ah, I see." (Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter)

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:16.829
So the - I mean, least bothered as to even
remember your own name or to say it. Like

00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:26.639
a drug acting on that person. That's going
too far. Another style is where too much of

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:37.829
formalities. That, supposing now, Mother is
coming and we have to give Her something,

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:46.820
and something is missing. All right, doesn't
matter. After all, this is Paris. Lots of

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.959
things were missing once upon a time. If there
is something missing, doesn't matter. It's

00:16:51.959 --> 00:17:00.320
not so important, you should not be in tension.
If you are in tension you cannot absorb My

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.750
vibrations. Or if you are lethargic also you
cannot absorb My vibrations. So, you have

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:16.280
to be in the center. Center, in a receptive
mood like a child is that you have to absorb

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:32.660
the vibrations with that feeling of expectation
and joy. We have to receive Mother. But not

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:38.340
with tension that, "This is not done, that
is not done." I see each and every thing so

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:48.720
beautifully done. So beautiful are these flowers,
everything done so well!

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:58.020
And so many ideas. I can see them so clearly.
It's all expressive of not your tension but

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:12.309
your love. So, are we expressing our love
or our tension? What is that we are doing?

00:18:12.309 --> 00:18:23.190
Are we trying to be tense because we are over-alert,
or we are trying to neglect everything because

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:38.929
we want to escape? Between the two lies Sahaja
Yoga. You are very anxious, very much waiting.

00:18:38.929 --> 00:18:49.020
You want to do something with your heart and
then, when there is fulfillment, you can enjoy.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:57.480
But you are tense, I come in, what I find
you all have headaches. So, first I have to

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:04.360
tell you, "Remove your headaches first, then
I'll talk to you." So, it has to be a very

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:12.370
relaxed rapport between us, but relaxed never
means lethargic. It doesn't mean, if you are

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:20.700
lethargic you'll be sleeping off and nothing
will go onto your ears.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:30.710
So, what we see that our conditioning, one
conditioning we have that either we want people

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:38.900
to be over-alert or we want that they should
not be at all alert. So, the underlying problem

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:52.669
of all these things is this - that we want
extremes. In our conditionings we go to extremes.

00:19:52.669 --> 00:20:08.929
We go to extremes of this or extremes of that.
If you are absolutely lethargic, lenient,

00:20:08.929 --> 00:20:20.910
disheveled, we can say absolutely confused,
you are not in the center. And on the contrary,

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:37.020
if you are very strict, like a Rock of Gibraltar
and after all like a big Hitler-like behavior

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:44.960
-"You should be in time, everybody must have
proper steps, must walk properly." That's

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:48.410
not being Sahaj. That's not being Sahaj.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:58.720
Now, look at these flowers. See one by one
how beautiful they are. Everyone is different,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:06.030
even one leaf of one flower will not match
with another. One petal won't match with another.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:17.650
They're all different, but so relaxed, creating
beauty, giving us so much of joy. All different.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:25.760
Placed in different manner, moving in different
manner. Everyone has a different angle. But

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:37.370
there is unison. There is oneness in them
that they all want to give us joy. But with

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:43.440
tension you cannot give joy. I mean if there
is somebody tense, I think I better run away

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:49.520
from that person. God knows if he is tense,
if the tension increases he might beat you.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:57.900
(Shri Mataji laughing) Or might throw you
out, or might himself be hurt. So, the tension

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:09.059
part of it is very common in the West and
that conditioning has come because of certain

00:22:09.059 --> 00:22:12.220
lifestyles that we have had.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:21.720
Now, there's not going to be a war of Waterloo
anymore. So, we can say that Waterloo war

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:30.299
was won because they reached in time. That's
not the thing. The war was won because it

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:35.950
was to be won by the Divine power. Even if
they had reached late, they would have won

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:47.559
it. Whatever happens is by the Divine power.
So, there is no need to be tense. Then you

00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:52.669
will say, "All right. Then, let us sit down
and have a nice time. Everything will be done

00:22:52.669 --> 00:23:01.919
by the Divine power." No! Divine power is
going to work through your institutions, through

00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:09.110
your medium. So, you have to be alert.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:17.669
I hope you understand what I am trying to
say - that a person who is relaxed need not

00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:35.380
be a person who is lethargic, but alert. Alert
you can be as well as you can be relaxed because

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:41.799
you are Sahaja Yogis. You are not like other
people. Other people, you take the name of

00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:47.160
the airport and I don't know what goes wrong
in their brains. Suddenly, they go off. They

00:23:47.160 --> 00:24:00.380
are off their heads, they go mad. Like today,
we were going to the airport. Thank God everything

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:07.200
- nobody was on the road. "They must be having
these hangovers", I said, "last night. And

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:15.480
today that the streets were all right." I
said, "Let's go easily. After all, there is

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.770
no program."

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:23.830
At home everybody was thinking I'll be late.
I said, "I am not going to be late." We reached

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:30.600
there. There was a big queue. And nobody could
get into the plane because there was such

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:41.179
a big queue. Nobody could even book the seat.
So, what was the need to be tense? And supposing

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:51.650
you are tense, take a position. And then you
do not get the plane. So what? At the most

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:59.230
only there is one mishappening, which is going
to take place, is our death. That is inevitable.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:09.010
Because we are born, so this body has to die.
That's all! The rest of it is just a joke.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:17.210
So, even if you are tense or not tense makes
no difference. I think sometimes people stand

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:22.840
at the same point and start running thinking
they are going to the airport. (Laughter)

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:31.409
No movement - tense. So, first of all we have
to know that if we can reduce our tensions,

00:25:31.409 --> 00:25:40.840
heart will open. Heart has to open. After
all, we are now in the ocean of joy and bliss.

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:55.940
Why should we have any tension? But when we
are in the ocean of joy and bliss, we are

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:07.520
not drowning. We are swimming, so we have
to swim. And this part, I think is not understood

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.120
by many people.

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:16.150
Now, we have conditionings of countries, of
different, different styles. Every country

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:29.190
has different styles of conditionings. Let's
think of France has got conditionings that

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:35.400
you should never look happy. (Laughter) You
can make out a French man. A French lady sitting

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:42.350
in front of Me, she was looking so miserable,
I was about to ask, "Who has died in your

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:53.030
family?" (Laughter) She was well dressed.
She had made all make-up, hairstyle, everything

00:26:53.030 --> 00:27:00.490
fine she must have been. But her face was
so miserable that I didn't understand how

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:06.210
these two things combine. She has taken good
care to look, appear very nice with her paints

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:16.620
and all that, and here she is looking so miserable.
She's put up a show that she was very miserable.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:26.809
Now, the conditioning is so stupid, so stupid
that according to them whatever is ugly has

00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:33.500
become beautiful. The ugliest of ugly women
they'll choose and give her the first prize

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:41.510
as the beautiest. I don't know for what, which
angle they saw this lady that they called

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:49.270
her beauty. You'll find the lady is caught
up, she is bhootish, giving horrible vibrations

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:53.440
and they say, "She is beauty."

00:27:53.440 --> 00:28:01.880
So, because of this tensed oblique visions
that we have either this way or this way,

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:15.220
we never see the reality. And, what we accept
is absolutely whatever is unreal and worry

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:25.630
about it. It's like a bubble. We are worried
about a bubble, as if it's an atomic bomb

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:36.140
or hydrogen bomb. So, unimportant things we
worry so much. As a result of that, when we

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:44.950
worry, worry, worry, anybody who comes near
us, we jump on that person. What are you worried

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:55.179
about? What's the problem? I tell you the
only worry I have, if I have any, is this:

00:28:55.179 --> 00:29:11.320
that My children should love each other. So,
I talk of friendship - is to have a friend.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:19.240
If we have worries, we always tell to our
friends but not to persons of acquaintance.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:25.340
If you have problems, we'll never tell it
to somebody who we just know by-the-way, but

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:33.909
to our friends, and so friendship. Even if
you are a leader, you are a friend of the

00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:35.330
people.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:50.340
Friendship is such that you could share your
secrets, you could share your problems. You

00:29:50.340 --> 00:30:00.470
do that with Me. And why not with each other?
It's a question of understanding that Sahaja

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:07.240
Yogis are all really friends to each other.
I think relationship of friendship is even

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:12.809
higher than any other relationship we could
think of, because there is nothing to be gained

00:30:12.809 --> 00:30:22.059
out of our friendship. It never ceases and
you just enjoy the friendship, that's all.

00:30:22.059 --> 00:30:30.669
Then you can pull each other's legs, sometimes.
You could be little joking with another person,

00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:41.140
making fun of another person. It's all right,
it's friendship. But this is the purest form

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:56.529
of understanding our relationships with each
other. And a friend is the one who is always,

00:30:56.529 --> 00:31:04.159
for no rhyme and reason, concerned about his
friend. Before Sahaja Yoga, you could have

00:31:04.159 --> 00:31:14.890
only one friend or at the most two. Three
meant a crowd, cannot have three persons as

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:24.840
your friends. But in Sahaja Yoga we are all
friends, pure friendship. Friendship of a

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:38.640
very beautiful nature - that you enjoy the
joy of another person. In vibrations you do.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:49.429
If you feel the vibrations of another Sahaja
Yogi, you really enjoy.

00:31:49.429 --> 00:31:58.820
I have seen this kind of friendship when we
were young because that time people were more

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:09.240
open hearted as my father had his friends.
He was a very orthodox Brahmin, a friend of

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:19.520
his and he was the chairman of an organization
all over the country. And the school that,

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:26.169
one of the schools where I was studying, that
organization was running. So, he was the big

00:32:26.169 --> 00:32:35.100
boss in that school. So, My father had to
go for a case far away and he took all his

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:42.270
family and he sent Me to the hostel. He wrote
to his friend that, "I'm going away and my

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:48.779
daughter has to appear for her final exams.
But I'm sorry I had to go, taking my family

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:50.710
with me. But this is a nice chance."

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:56.360
So, the friend wrote, "All right, doesn't
matter. You can go away. I'm going to look

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.200
after your daughter."

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:04.549
He came down and he stayed in the hostel.
Took a room there in the hostel. We all were

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:09.940
there. He was a Brahmin, he would not touch
an egg. He was a Brahmin. But he knew that

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:19.570
I eat eggs and I am a non-veg. So, this was
about summertime had started. But he would

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:27.440
still put on his overcoat or a raincoat and
walk out. I don't know from where he used

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:35.130
to get eggs in the morning, bring it in his
room because it was a Brahmin school, and

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:43.210
secretly cook the eggs for Me, and then he
would call Me, and give Me the eggs to eat.

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.809
I said, "I don't need them." "No, no, no you
have to have. You know, Your father has gone

00:33:46.809 --> 00:33:48.630
away, I have to look after You."

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:54.230
So sweetly! And he was the head of heads there,
breaking his own rules and regulations for

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:59.690
Me that he was making non-veg food. (Shri
Mataji laughing) And then he would take all

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:10.720
the, see, shells of the eggs in a paper, put
it in the pocket in a big overcoat, walked

00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:19.619
out and throw them somewhere. Then he would
come with Me to leave Me for My exams. Evening

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:27.749
again, he was there, waiting for Me. He was
such a big man, such a great man, very much

00:34:27.749 --> 00:34:33.089
respected. I mean, he was the head of the
heads.

00:34:33.089 --> 00:34:44.149
And everyday I was very much surprised at
this friendship. And nothing - I mean, I didn't

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:55.799
see them talking about anything or I mean,
they had nothing in common as such. Was just

00:34:55.799 --> 00:35:01.999
friendship! My father was a literary person,
as you know, and this one was a social worker.

00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:11.119
I mean there was, My father was busy with
politics. And such friends I have seen, My

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:17.940
father would go to jail, so his friends would
come and take us away to their houses and

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.630
their wives will look after us, give us bath.
No difference. I never felt any difference

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:27.640
between their children and Me. Moreover, we
felt that they were looking after us more

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.319
than their own children. First they will give
us bath.

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:43.630
In friendship one can really enjoy! You need
a very large heart to be a friend, very large

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:50.009
heart. If you look after your own child, support
your own child then you are a gone case for

00:35:50.009 --> 00:35:57.539
Sahaja Yoga, but if you have that kind of
a largeness of friendship.

00:35:57.539 --> 00:36:05.170
There is a nice story My father used to tell
us about friends because My brother was, had

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:13.809
lots of friends, they used to go about gallivanting,
this, that. And then used to always criticize

00:36:13.809 --> 00:36:20.119
that what father your friends come in. They
just look after your lawn sometimes because

00:36:20.119 --> 00:36:26.299
somebody is fond of lawn. Then another does
that. And you don't people discuss, argue

00:36:26.299 --> 00:36:29.739
anything - just, I don't know how you enjoy
each other's company.

00:36:29.739 --> 00:36:36.969
He said, "No, we talk, it's not that. No,
no, we enjoy very much." So, My father told

00:36:36.969 --> 00:36:39.489
him, "All right, I will tell you a story".

00:36:39.489 --> 00:36:47.059
That there was a father who had a friend and
the son had a friend. Modern times, I mean

00:36:47.059 --> 00:36:56.269
modern these days is also old times, I should
say. So, the father said to the son that,

00:36:56.269 --> 00:37:04.769
"You see, friendship is where you can always
rely on your friend and your friend can rely

00:37:04.769 --> 00:37:09.140
on you."

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:19.829
He said, "Really?" "Yes", he said so. "Oh,
my friends I can rely", the boy said, "I can

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:24.289
rely on my friends". He said "Really?" "Yes."

00:37:24.289 --> 00:37:31.259
So, father said, "All right, let's test your
friends and my friends."

00:37:31.259 --> 00:37:40.089
So, they went down, they asked. The father
went with the son, and went to these friends

00:37:40.089 --> 00:37:49.079
of the son. And the son thought - he told
the son that, "You have to say that I have

00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:55.180
murdered someone and help me." He said, "All
right".

00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:04.119
So, they went to one friend. That friend said,
"You murdered? Baba, you get out!" He closed

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:08.880
the door. Another one they went to, he closed
the door. Third one he said, "No, no don't

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:13.979
say that you have come to my house. I have
nothing to do with you." All his twenty friends

00:38:13.979 --> 00:38:14.609
said, "No".

00:38:14.609 --> 00:38:20.680
He said, "All right, now let me go to one
friend of mine." They went there. So, they

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:25.430
knocked at the door, knocked at the door.
Door would not open. Then he shouted, "I am

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:29.979
here." So, the boy started saying, "Look at
this. Your friend is not even coming." He

00:38:29.979 --> 00:38:31.920
said, "No, no, no, just wait and see."

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:38.539
So, about ten minutes later the friend came
and opened the door, and took him inside.

00:38:38.539 --> 00:38:39.700
"What's the matter?"

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:45.279
He said, "You know I have murdered somebody"
- the father said - "and so we have come to

00:38:45.279 --> 00:38:46.809
you for help".

00:38:46.809 --> 00:38:55.390
"I knew something must be there because why
will you come at this hour? So, I was collecting

00:38:55.390 --> 00:39:00.690
all the ornaments of my wife. I mean, if you
need money, I better give you the ornaments.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.380
So, that's why I was late."

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:08.339
"But", he said, "if you have murdered, it
doesn't matter. Now, you've got children,

00:39:08.339 --> 00:39:13.160
I don't have. So, you better tell them I have
murdered. Tell me how the murder took place,

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:20.950
I'll take the murder upon myself." And the
son was surprised. He said, "No, take this."

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:27.140
Then the father said, "See now, this is my
friend. You had twenty friends and I have

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.579
only one friend. This is his friendship."

00:39:30.579 --> 00:39:35.729
And this kind of a friendship, we Sahaja Yogis
should have. I mean with a friend you cannot

00:39:35.729 --> 00:39:43.499
be tense. Cannot be. That is first sign. And
with your friend sitting there, you won't

00:39:43.499 --> 00:39:47.890
doze off, and you won't sleep. But you enjoy.

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:58.489
Once I was traveling by train and we had two
compartments. So, in one compartment myself

00:39:58.489 --> 00:40:05.569
and one old lady were there. I mean, I was
older than her but she though she was older.

00:40:05.569 --> 00:40:13.900
And she was trying to sleep. And in the other
compartment were two friends. They had met.

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:19.239
Ahh! So they were enjoying. He was hitting
him and he was hitting him. He said, "Aye,

00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:20.380
you!" And like that going on.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:25.190
So, this lady said, "Look at these people.
They are not allowing us to sleep." So she

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:30.599
went and shouted at them, "Will you stop this
nonsense? What is going on?"

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:32.609
He said, "We have met after a long time, you
see, so, we are enjoying."

00:40:32.609 --> 00:40:37.650
She said, "This is not the way. Why are you
hitting each other if you are enjoying? And

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.349
don't talk loudly." She went away.

00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:43.869
Then I went and said, "Now, you shout. I am
here. Don't say anything. I'll lock the door.

00:40:43.869 --> 00:40:48.339
This lady won't come." They were surprised.
I said, "I am enjoying the way you are enjoying

00:40:48.339 --> 00:40:53.309
each other." They said, "You don't want to
sleep?" "No, no, I want to hear what you say

00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:57.959
to each other." And they were surprised how
I was enjoying the way they were hitting each

00:40:57.959 --> 00:41:01.199
other and enjoying each other.

00:41:01.199 --> 00:41:10.489
So, this is how, I have to tell you that we
have to be friends. We have to share, enjoy

00:41:10.489 --> 00:41:18.619
sharing. There is no seriousness about it.
How can you be serious with your friend? Just

00:41:18.619 --> 00:41:25.759
relaxed enjoying each other's company. Even
if you have to argue - argue, doesn't matter.

00:41:25.759 --> 00:41:34.529
Even if you have a different view, it's all
right. But, you should not try to impose yourself

00:41:34.529 --> 00:41:39.599
on your friend, nor your friend should try
to impose. But try to understand each other.

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:47.140
That's how we are going to learn such a lot.
You have to learn such a lot from each other.

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:52.819
For example, I learnt so much from French
you'll be surprised. Learnt lot of things

00:41:52.819 --> 00:42:00.119
from French, the way they have their art,
their ideas of art, their music, their culture.

00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:07.459
Lots of things to be learnt. So, you have
friends in India, you have friends everywhere,

00:42:07.459 --> 00:42:14.420
you have friends now in South America. Everywhere
you have friends. You just go ahead with My

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:22.150
badge. Finished. Oh! They will all jump for
you, they will do anything for you.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:31.009
So, this friendship, just think of it in this
world we have thousands and thousands of friends

00:42:31.009 --> 00:42:41.099
everywhere we go. And this is what we have
to know within ourselves that we have to be

00:42:41.099 --> 00:42:51.519
ourselves very, very friendly type, very friendly.
There is an openness between one friend and

00:42:51.519 --> 00:42:58.359
another friend. There is no closeness. There
is no tension. There is no formality. And,

00:42:58.359 --> 00:43:09.900
reliance. So much so that you can talk to
them about what you want, what is your need

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:15.019
and what problems you have.

00:43:15.019 --> 00:43:25.509
I hope you understand that love means complete
freedom to yourself and to others. If you

00:43:25.509 --> 00:43:32.589
love someone, then there is complete freedom
and understanding. But this love has to be

00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:45.529
very, very pure. Complete understanding. You
have to feel that friendship. And, you will

00:43:45.529 --> 00:43:50.930
feel very proud that you have so many friends.
And real friends! You have so many friends

00:43:50.930 --> 00:44:06.269
who are real friends. You will be so very
- feeling a thing as if you are a great personality

00:44:06.269 --> 00:44:13.650
that you have so many friends in this world.
You are not alone.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:24.449
Imagine before this what we had, so many saints,
so many great souls were born and they were

00:44:24.449 --> 00:44:36.779
treated like singular people and tortured,
killed, poisoned. They were alone. But you

00:44:36.779 --> 00:44:46.459
are not. You are all - are friends to each
other and the greatest friend you have is

00:44:46.459 --> 00:44:55.539
the Divine power, which is looking after you
and doing everything for you. If you have

00:44:55.539 --> 00:45:04.140
that kind of a relaxed, beautiful alertness
within you, you are going to enjoy life. You

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:11.249
are going to enjoy Sahaja Yoga and you are
going to get many, many more people in Sahaja

00:45:11.249 --> 00:45:19.749
Yoga. And, if you don't have this among yourselves
then people are going to say, "Oh Mother,

00:45:19.749 --> 00:45:26.699
whatever You may say but Sahaja Yogis are
no good."

00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:37.640
So, for today, in this country of France where
we have got liberation, where we have fought

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:47.979
for liberation, let us take to real liberation,
the real liberation of the soul of our spirit

00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:54.839
to enjoy. Enjoy everything that is available
with understanding.

00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:59.980
May God bless you all!
