00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.320
Have you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.360
got that album also?
Just to read.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.240
I have to thank you all for giving money
for the presents for Indians.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.240
From the Indian side I would like
to thank you all for doing that.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.480
And I hope you all have done it.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.560
Indians are waiting for Sahaja Yogis
and they are regretting that some of you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.840
are not coming.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.600
And we’ll be celebrating Christmas
in Puna in a big way.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.280
And I hope you all will celebrate Christmas,
if you want you can come here

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:21.080
and celebrate the way you want to do it.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.640
Now you know that Mr. Srivastava
has retired.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.000
As a result of that I also won’t be
staying here for longer periods,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.800
come here for short periods,
may be for at the most month or so.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.560
Now it is your responsibility
to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.760
Each person can do a lot.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.160
In every country it has worked this way.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:03.280
We’ll be having about three Ashrams
established, but every house is an Ashram

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.440
and I was happy that also in Harrow
they are having some program.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.840
I hope he is here, is he here –
Malcolm?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.280
He wrote to Me that he wants to start
a program in Harrow.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.660
In the same way in whatever locality
you live you can advertise to begin with –

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.120
gradually it will move.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.400
You know that Sahaja Yoga
started with one person.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.360
So you shouldn’t mind,
in the beginning they come

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.240
then they go away, then they come,
when I’m there all of them will come.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.920
I don’t know what’s wrong with them.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.240
But otherwise they don’t come.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.040
So there’s nothing to be
disappointed with them.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.320
We have to help our country-men.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.560
We have to try to understand them.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.080
Now we are much better Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.800
We understand Sahaja Yoga very well.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:15.040
Perhaps it is never been a great
knowledge to you that you have become

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.040
real great saints.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.960
It’s not a knowledge because gradually
the whole thing has opened out

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.760
so beautifully in you
whatever is your, your own being

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.040
has shown its own manifestation
and the whole thing has worked out

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.240
so beautifully that you don’t know
what you have got.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.280
You talk to anybody who is of a very
high ranking philosopher

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.840
he will know what you know.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.280
You can face anyone.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:56.040
You can face the pope, if you want to.
(Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter)

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.000
And Yogi Mahajan went to these
orthodox church and he told them,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.560
“What are you talking,
if there is a Holy Ghost on this Earth,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.600
what are you doing here,
why are you fighting?”

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.920
They wouldn’t take him seriously.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.520
They said, “Where is the Holy Ghost,
now whatever are the,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.080
whatever are the signs given
of the Holy Ghost are here.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.280
So why don’t you accept?

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.320
If you are Christians you should accept.”

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.840
And he single handedly fought them,
single handed he fought them.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.840
And he said, “You,
you are all blind people.”

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.960
And that’s what the Christ has said that,
“You will be calling Me Christ, Christ

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.960
and I won’t recognise you.
You are the people.”

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.940
But I was surprised even in Koran
there is a complete, complete chapter,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.960
a very big chapter called as S Y,
[Sahashta Yoga ?], can you imagine,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:53.880
in Koran, where He has said it completely,
in such a complete manner

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.040
that you won’t recognise the one
whom we’ll sent.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.840
You will not believe.
You’ll try to play tricks.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.400
You will try to trouble
but you will be the losers

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.320
and you all will go to hell.
It’s so clearly in that one, the whole chapter.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.432
I haven’t got the Koran with Me
otherwise I would have read it out to you.

00:06:11.432 --> 00:06:12.560
You will be amazed.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.120
He has condemned all such peoples,&nbsp;

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.440
who are with such short&nbsp;
sight they won’t recognize.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.040
Even in the Bible yesterday I was reading that,
“You are not going to believe,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.600
you are not going to understand.”

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.560
So in every scripture
they’ve tried to say this.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.000
And of course, when there is
no background at all,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.680
whatever background we have
and whatever is said is so emphatically said

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.320
we have to accept it.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.480
But it doesn’t happen.
It doesn’t happen.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.400
Now surprisingly that you know that
in Russia we have done wonders.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.040
We are already recognised there&nbsp;

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.356
while this pope is still&nbsp;
busy trying to recognize –

00:06:57.356 --> 00:07:00.760
and get his Catholic church recognized.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.840
We are already recognised.
We have an independent status.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.920
So the Russians have that depth.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.640
You know one fellow has written a thesis
on this Shri Chakra and its mathematics,

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.640
can you believe it,
he is a professor of Mathematics.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.600
That book is lost somehow or other
I don’t know where but we are going to get it.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.480
They have written books about yoga –
they have written books of Patanjali.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.880
They have written so many;
I mean they have done so much.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:32.320
But they know they have not found it.
They know this falsehood.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.360
Something has gone wrong with it
sometimes I feel it’s the curse of Christianity

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.440
in the West. Perhaps may be.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.880
Because why is it wherever
there is Christianity

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.760
such a stumbling block for Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.400
I just don’t understand,
what these people have done to us?

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.200
So now it is our duty as Christians
specially, to bring good name to Christ,

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.920
because they are blocked people,
they can’t see.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.960
They cannot feel, and they don’t want to know.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.560
Can you imagine – the ministers of their
Supreme Committee are coming to Ganapatipule?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:17.760
Can you think even a ordinary,
you can say [chapraci ?] as we call them –

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:29.680
the door keeper from Western bureaucracy
will come to Ganapatipule?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.320
So this is the problem
and they think we are all mad people,

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.880
you see they want to show that we are all mad,
we are in a cult, we are into this

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.960
because anybody who is not in Christianity
is in the cult –

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.600
and they are the greatest cult I think.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.040
So now you realize that this is the thing
that has happened now with the Christians.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.840
They have not achieved anything
we have to fight them and we have to tell them

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.200
that this is what it is, “You are a cult.
We are not a cult. You are a cult.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.600
You are the ones who are following
something so blindly

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.720
and you cannot open your eyes to something
that’s the truth which is told in the Bible.”

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.360
You have to tell them.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.200
Unless and until you talk to them
this won’t happen. This won’t work out.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.840
So you see we have to be very bold now,
we have to talk about Sahaja Yoga

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.240
on every level.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.400
So on a religious level I would the say
I don’t know the Jews will ever listen to anyone,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.760
I mean Jews are another cracked people,
just fanatic people because they don’t listen

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.680
but we have Jews now in Sahaja Yoga, we have.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.360
So we have to get Jews like this
talking to some friends and this and that

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.880
because the older people in Jews, you see,
they all think they are in dangers.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.920
I don’t know if they’ll come.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.120
They can go to TM but to come
to Sahaja Yoga is very difficult for them

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.880
because they think it’s
some sort of a cult.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.080
I don’t know what picture they have given.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.600
Now on various levels we have to see
what we can do about Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.400
On religious level the Hindus,
or the Indians who have come here

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.160
or even Pakistanis who have come here,
all of them as I told you,

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.120
they all like a mango tree brought to London,
which cannot produce mango,

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.360
but it cannot even produce an apple.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:13.040
So Indians are hopelessly bad
so don’t worry too much about them.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.560
If they’ll come to you they will
telephone to Me immediately

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:21.720
my mother is ill, my father is ill,
my God father is dead, bless his soul.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.840
So best thing is to be careful
as to what people to handle.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.360
If you can get hold of someone
do not pressurise them too much

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.400
because the ego is too much,
slowly, slowly work it out.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.800
I am sure they will understand.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:43.120
So we have to get people who are well educated,
who have some sense in their heads

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:50.360
and people who have not, sort of –
you are not under the other conditions,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.720
of other gurus and this and that
because they are difficult.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.920
You don’t have to worry about them
because you catch.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.800
So you don’t worry about such people.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.320
You worry about sensible, normal people
that are there and talk to them.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.680
But normal people think that,
“Oh! We are all right.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.240
What’s wrong with us?
What’s so special about it?”

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:16.440
So for them you have to tell them that,
“See, we have found out that we are the Spirit.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.320
We have found out the method how to become that
and we know everything about it.”

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.200
If you start talking about this to them
they’ll be really amazed.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.800
Now you take Bible and read in that
different, different chapters

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.360
wherever you find there’s support
of Sahaja Yoga

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.200
and you can talk to them on religious basis.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.320
Now there’s another kind of thing,
you might find is the people

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.920
who are in the business and things.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:46.440
So now those people, who go to them
and meet them have to talk that,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.140
“In business you can improve.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:53.400
You definitely improve in business
if you go to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.560
You can talk to them.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:00.720
Sahaja Yoga gives you that special quality
of relaxation that you can improve.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.640
So that’s how you can talk to them
because they are also another.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.200
Bureaucrats you don’t talk to them.
They are out of question.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.480
Just don’t bother your heads
about bureaucrats.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.120
They are the stupidest people
I have come across.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.960
I don’t know where are they
going to hang themselves. (Laughter)

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.240
Don’t talk to bureaucrats.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.240
Bureaucrats are out of question,
very difficult people.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:29.240
So now then we have got say, professionals
like architects, doctors and other things,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.920
also these people can be handled.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.960
You can talk to them,
have meetings with them, call them.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.920
If there is an architect, you can call
some architects to say that,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.360
“See, in architecture how you have improved,&nbsp;

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.880
how you got more dynamic&nbsp;
ideas”, and things like that.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.640
But I think this country&nbsp;
is more meant for doctors.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.320
We have many doctors here.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.680
So this country can work out on the doctors.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.480
But that doesn’t mean you should gather
all these sick people

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.200
and bang at the doctors’ place.
But still, still

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.760
if you find somebody like that
if you give Realization that person,

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.760
then you can take that person to the doctors
who are trying to form,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.560
some sort of a, we can say a clinic here.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.680
So Dr. Wells has started one clinic.
Dr Spiro is going to a start another

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.200
and we have still got Chelsham road.
And Chelsham Road is there.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:27.040
Now the problem that we have now
is to understand, first of all,

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.200
who will take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:36.000
Don’t waste your energies on stupid people
because then you get so fed up with them

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.960
and then come back to Me and say,
“Mother, see I have tried.”

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.630
Don’t try. Try only three times –
if it works, well and good

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:44.680
otherwise forget them, just forget them.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:51.840
There’s nothing that can give you any credit
if you run after some mad fellow.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.880
But you might become mad, that’s all.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.680
They are mad. They are blind.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.640
They can’t see and they think
that Sahaja Yoga is only for –

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.520
some people think that it is only
for people with problems. It’s not so.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.760
It’s not so.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:13.760
It’s meant for everyone who wants
to have betterment of their lives,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.920
is for the benevolence of everybody.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.680
But those who do not want
to see their benevolence,

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.040
no use forcing them,
wasting your precious time, you see,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.840
Sahaja Yogis are the most precious things.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:30.920
Now I’ll tell you – when I went to Russia, see,
I was telling Yogi Mahajan

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.080
that this Yoga conference
I would like to attend.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.160
He said, “All right, Mother,
we’ll find out some time for You to speak.”

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.800
And I said, “It’s a good idea. I’ll come.”

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.480
So I told him when I went there, you see,
this is a very big breaking point

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.680
because all East block people
are going to be there,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.680
East Germany, Czechoslovakia, all these people.
They are all going to be there.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:01.640
And once they face Me, they become Sahaja Yogis,
once they go back to their own countries

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.560
it will start cracking.
Exactly that happened.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.080
Exactly that happened
because that conference was held

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.900
we got doctors and people from East Germany,
we got from Czechoslovakia,

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:19.240
we got from Romania, from everywhere we got.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:26.760
And they came and so many of Russians also
and when they became Sahaja Yogis they cracked.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.320
This – such a big wall is cracked now,
all these things have happened.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:35.600
In the same way when Hungary was asked –
Hungary, what about Hungary, I said,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.880
“Let one Hungarian person come
to Sahaja Yoga it will work out.”

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.280
It has worked.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:47.160
Now certain countries are little difficult
I find, I think as Portuguese and Spain

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.360
are rather difficult.

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:54.560
Perhaps may be they have been very aggressive,
extremely aggressive, English also have been,

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:59.240
I must say, English, French,
you must accept that.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:06.600
But Spanish have done lot of crimes
because they killed so many people in America,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.040
so many. I mean when you go
and see there, I mean,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.480
all these films they show – is all wrong.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.200
Actually they all aggressed
all the people there.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.400
So this is a trouble with the white skin.
That it tries to aggress all the time.

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.240
You see somebody they’ll aggress
they think they have the right to aggress

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.191
because they have the white skin.

00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:28.160
You see, it’s such a curse,
it’s such a curse.

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.560
So I would say that,
that may be the reason –

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:37.959
now I know why they want to tan their face,
because they feel little guilty

00:16:37.959 --> 00:16:38.000
(Shri Mataji laughing)
– have a complex.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.560
So this aggression has done
so much harm to people, so much harm.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.800
And that’s why these two countries
Portuguese and Spain are still like that.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.480
I think Spain is coming up and goes down,
comes up, and all that.

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.440
So we have to support them and help them.

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.040
Of course, God has forgiven them, no doubt,
but still there are certain bhoots there

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.520
who must have been aggressive
or who are trying to play tricks with them.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.560
France was very difficult
and I went to France

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.960
I don’t know how many times.
In one year I went four times to France.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:15.720
So I worked very hard on France
and as a result France has improved a lot now.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.960
France has got so many centres
and so many people are there.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:25.400
They are coming up it’s much better.
Germany is working, Austria you know very well.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:31.480
So in these things – now Germany
has done so much of aggression,

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.920
but Austria is doing very well
because it was not so much in it.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.480
Germany is also coming.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:44.680
So you see, in the whole world
we can create lot of good will.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:53.040
I went to America last time and I said,
“Some Chinese from China-land should come

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.320
then it will work out.”

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.400
But there were some Chinese,
not from China land not from mainland

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:02.520
and I gave them Realization,
one of them was the father of the boy

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:06.200
who had acted in this
‘The last Emperor’ thing.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:11.640
And he was very dynamic and he said that,
“Mother, something should be done about China.”

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.520
I said, “China is not yet ready.”

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.760
And it happened they did do something
but they failed there.

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.000
Of course, it has to be worked out.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.320
But the Chinese there are now not coming to India
but going to Taiwan.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.840
And they are working it out in Taiwan
and once they’ve worked it out

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.560
I am going to Taiwan on My way to Australia.

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:38.400
So Taiwan is also we are going to get
and maybe Japan also.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:45.200
So I’ll be going to Hong Kong, Japan,
Taiwan, Australia –

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.840
all these places I would like to touch.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.440
And wherever there will be Sahaja Yoga
all these old things will crack.

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.680
But these are cracking because
they were very power-oriented

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.560
so the Shakti first attacks the power part.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:05.000
But also we much know that the countries
where there were no restrictions,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.160
this abandonment of old value system
as we have in all these Western countries,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.760
we have become so ignorant about ourselves.

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:19.520
We have become so blind.
We have become so ego oriented,

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.440
we have gone so wrong.
All these countries have gone so wrong.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:28.120
But while the countries now – I know that
all East Germans who are coming

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:33.200
into West Germans are going to fall
into Sahaja Yoga ocean, no doubt about it.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.120
And I could see also all the Czechoslovakians –
their faces; they are already&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.000
becoming Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.880
So they are all going to fall into it.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.080
But what about we, the ones who are supposed
to be the free people?

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.480
That’s what is to be done,
and for you all must decide

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:54.120
on the Christmas day or today if you want to,
if it’s not too early that,

00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:00.360
“We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga
and we are going to give Realization to people.”

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.560
Tell them about it, how you have changed,
you talk about yourself.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.600
If somebody says, “Oh! This is it.”
“I was just like you, just like you,

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:13.360
I tell you I was like this,
but this is what has happened.”

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.800
Now certain things we should know
we are now going to India

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.280
and there people who come to us and all that.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.840
So we have to know that this is a pilgrimage
we are going there for a pilgrimage

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:29.960
not for just a picnic, all right,
for a pilgrimage, for our ascent.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:35.800
And you may have some bad times,
you may have some good times and –

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:42.800
but it’s a venture, it’s a venture
into the new areas of rustic life

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.160
and not so much of sophistication.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.520
There you have to understand that you are going
for the comfort of your Spirit

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.240
and so far people have been very nice.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.720
But except for one or two things,
which I should say today

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:01.160
that we should not form into groups.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:07.320
Groupism is a very bad character,
specially of the English.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.240
They always form a group wherever they go.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.120
And it’s so troublesome sometimes.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.640
Now in, you see in Italy they are saying,
“Take back all the English.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:18.120
We don’t want them here.
They all form a group.”

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.840
Anywhere you go in the whole world.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.720
See I went to a very nice place in Argentina
and they have a very beautiful,

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:29.680
very, very beautiful area near the sea
called as Mar del Plata.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.480
It’s so beautiful it was,
so I was telling C.P. that we should

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.320
really have an Ashram here.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.760
I said, “What about the Christians,
what about the English?”

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.320
“Oh! They have another area they live there,
all of them.”

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.400
Anywhere – they just stay somewhere else,
you see.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.800
This kind of a false superiority
is not going to help us.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.600
We must face ourselves. It’s false.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.800
So we should never form a group.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:03.920
Now when you go there you’ll just mix up
with other people talk to everyone.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.440
And that past is over.
We are all Sahaja Yogis now.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:14.720
We are not English, we are not British
and we are not Germans –

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.480
we are all Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:23.160
Imagine the Germans came all the way
to Russia to give them Realization.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.880
Russians were given Realization
by Germans, can you believe it?

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.080
And the Jews and the Jews gave Realization
to Russians. This is the best part of it.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.880
You can never hear such things.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:42.800
So you should get rid of these
small boundaries of your mind

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.600
that English are something special,
they are not.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:53.160
We are all very ordinary Sahaja Yogis.
Let us be ordinary. That’s the best way.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.480
Let us be very ordinary.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:23:00.827
Once you become ordinary
then the extraordinary comes out of you.

00:23:00.827 --> 00:23:04.160
Well, if you try to put up
something extraordinary upon yourself

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:09.600
the poor thing which is inside so beautiful
just says, “All right, thank you very much

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.960
Humpty Dumpty.”
(Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter)

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:24.720
So let us be very humble, let us be very kind,
let us be collective.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.120
No groupism is needed in Sahaja Yoga.
You cannot have.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.440
If you try I’ll break it.
I’ll break it the groupism.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.760
I’ll break the group,
and may be the members of the group.

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.840
So you have to be very careful.

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:42.800
Those who have ideas of groupism of any kind
should give up – completely.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.800
We do not belong to any group.
We do not belong to any country.

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.640
We are in the kingdom of God.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.160
Why do you want to belong to
this wretched country England

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:58.800
or to that wretched country India?
You belong to the kingdom of God, all right?

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:04.360
So with that you feel so happy,
and so nice and so contented, so protected.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:11.167
But if you want to belong to British,
all right – face Mrs Thatcher.

00:24:11.167 --> 00:24:11.200
(Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter)

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.120
I have nothing to say but if you want to be
in the kingdom of God that have all blessings

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.760
everything from them.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.720
How things work out! How things work out!

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:28.400
It’s so remarkable, so remarkable,
that I mean I cannot explain to them

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.840
but I can tell you one or two incidents
where you will see how things work out

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:40.040
with this Paramchaitanya,
this all pervading power, how it works out.

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.920
Of course, in My case it always works out.
In My case I have no problem.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:50.360
I have no problem at all of any kind
but even in your case,

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.000
like Steven wrote to Me saying that,
“Mother, I won’t be able to come

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.040
because I don’t have so much money now
to travel and all that.”

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.120
I said, “You are the leader, you can come.”

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.520
But he said, “Travel money
is another problem.”

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:08.760
So what happened, he told Me the other day,
that he went to book all the seats

00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.680
for all the passengers who were coming
from the Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:20.680
The man who booked them said,
“You can have one ticket free.” (Laughter)

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:26.760
So even on material level it works out.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:33.480
Even small, small things you will find –
it works out.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:39.280
I went out shopping for you, your presents
and you won’t believe

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:56.760
we got woollen cloth for two pound a metre,
can you get it, woollen, full wool – just there.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.580
And all thanks will come to you,
though shopping I’ve done

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:08.120
but thanks will come to you
because you have sent such nice things.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.600
So for Me it works out,
and it works out for you also.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:16.360
Just have faith, just have faith,
whenever you have problems just pray.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.800
Just pray and have faith
that this is going to work out

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.360
and everything will work out very well.

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.560
It may take sometimes some little time,
doesn’t matter.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.120
So all in different levels we have seen
that we have to work outside

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.480
and give Realization to others,
like if you open one door –

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.200
Sahasrara is not sufficient.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:44.080
You have to open another door,
otherwise it doesn’t flow.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.200
If you want it to circulate and flow
then you must open another door

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.720
of giving Realizations to others.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:57.040
And you must try to do it,
those who are here have to do it.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.000
And those who are going to India
are going only with the idea

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.520
that they’ll become more powerful to do it.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:17.360
So it’s the Christmas coming,
it’s nice to celebrate Christmas as His birth,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:25.240
but He, see, He had such a short time to live
and He couldn’t do much,

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:38.840
should have done much more,
couldn’t do and His crucifixion came up suddenly.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:44.640
But doesn’t matter He still is there
within us as the Spirit

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.234
and you are again reborn.

00:27:47.234 --> 00:27:52.960
So at Christmas actually is the day you were born
is the Christmas; when Christ is born within you.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:00.560
So what you have to do is to think
that we are doing the work of Christ,

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:07.940
we are doing the work of Moses,
we are doing the work of Mohammed Sahib,

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.800
of Guru Nanaka – of all these great incarnations.
We are doing their work.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.280
And so we are important.
We are chosen ones.

00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.680
We are ordinary but we are important.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:31.600
And this is how you will realize
that everyone of you plays a part and a role.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.400
How much you take responsibility
is your own.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.557
Christ took such a big responsibility
because He was after all Omkara.

00:28:39.557 --> 00:28:44.920
So it’s all right. But we are also there
so we should also take the responsibility

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.000
of England.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.440
We should take at least the responsibility
if not of England, of your own, say, province,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:29:04.280
or you can take of your own little village,
at least. That’s how it is going to work out.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:10.120
I have some different plans also for you
which I am sure will work out.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.120
Let’s see next year, we’ll able to see
the results of those plans.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.920
But this year only you have to work hard
and work it out.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.120
Everybody must try to also make up
some business or some, earn something

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:32.400
and do something better for yourself.
Not to be lazy

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.880
because this is another curse on the –
because of the climate I also feel lazy,

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.676
such a horrible climate it is.

00:29:40.676 --> 00:29:45.960
But doesn’t matter we have to fight it,
you see. So the laziness is not a very good thing

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:49.200
and for that I think early in the morning
4 o’clock if you take bath

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.000
you won’t feel lazy the whole day.
If you can try that.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.920
Try getting up early in the morning
somehow or other getting on to the top,

00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.120
have your bath and then see
how you feel the whole day.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.800
All day you will very, very energetic.

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.640
But you must do it early in the morning,
because after that you have to at least spend

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.680
two hours in the house.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.320
Then there won’t be any problem
and you can do very well.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.280
So this is one of them you can try.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.880
You can also try massaging your body –
with some sort of a massaging thing

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.840
if you can get.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:27.040
That will give you good circulation
because we have to be very active

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:32.560
compared to others so that they see in us
the dynamism of Kundalini working.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:39.720
And that will be very helpful to you
because this laziness is a curse of this country.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:43.240
They used to be too active.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.280
You see what we knew of English means
you see they’ll come at the time

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.880
that they will be there.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:55.400
They will do this at this time they will do it.
So spick and span, absolutely tailored people,

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.720
absolutely. Now the same thing
has gone to the other end.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:03.280
So we don’t need that extreme
and we don’t need this extreme.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.960
We have to be in the center
and we have to be active.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.280
If you feel sleepy or anything
then there is something wrong with us.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:16.560
If you feel sleepy wash your face, do something
but keep – try to keep awake

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.640
and see what work you have put in.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.200
Immediately your brain will start working,
your earnings would be better,

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.960
your life would be better.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:35.160
So try to be active and try to be projecting
yourself, projecting all the time

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:41.520
and it will, I am sure with this
New Year’s coming it will work out very well.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:48.120
My going is, I think – was fixed on the 9th,
may be on the 8th I don’t know whatever it is

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.720
and I don’t want you to come
in the fog again there, it’s all right.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:56.080
So I would like to really say Good Bye
because I really don’t want you to come

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.400
all the way in the fog
and stand there in the cold.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.760
And when I come when it is cold
please don’t stand in the cold

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.320
because all the time I am worried in the plane
that they must be standing there,

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:09.240
now the plane is getting late
this is happening.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.960
I would say that when it is warm and nice
and then it’s all right

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.720
but when it is so cold
I don’t want children to be there

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.320
because if you want to make Me happy
then you shouldn’t take My children

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.200
suffer in the cold, all right?

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.600
So please, at least don’t bring the children.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.560
But the children are there,
everybody is there, and I am worrying

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:33.160
in the plane that all of them would be standing
and this plane is so late, you know,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:38.640
sometimes you can’t help it.
So this is My little request is.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.760
Now another is that you shouldn’t give Me
any more presents. You see,

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.920
just see this house is filled with
65% things are presents.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:49.160
I don’t know what to do with them.
I cannot sell them.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.600
I cannot give it any one.
I cannot wear them. I don’t know what to do.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.840
Now I will have to build three more houses.
(Laughter)

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.400
It will be going in the museum.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:06.000
So there is no need at all to give Me
any presents whatsoever.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.600
For to give Me flowers are the best
and but that also not so many,

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.680
My husband was saying that,
“You better, We both better get out of the house

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:23.719
and let the flowers live in the house.”
(Laughter)

00:33:23.719 --> 00:33:23.760
That going too far.
(Shri Mataji laughing)

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.240
So I mean that you love Me,
I know that you are very kind to Me

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.360
and you are very sweet
and to feel that so many people love Me

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.080
itself is so joy giving.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:41.360
You have no idea – My joy has no bounds.
It cannot – I cannot express to you

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.200
that you see how, how much it is
from all sides.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:54.280
I feel the flowing of joy and the pouring in joy
is such a lot and I enjoy all this

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.280
that you love Me so much.

00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:01.040
But you must also love yourself
and respect yourself that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.600
That’s all I have to say and wish you
a very, very happy Christmas

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:11.940
and a very prosperous
and very dynamic New Year!

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:17.040
May God bless you!

00:36:23.720 --> 00:43:15.960
(Now Shri Mataji is starting to talk&nbsp;

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:54.760
about Sahaja marriages.)

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:05.080
(Bad quality due&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:54.440 --> 00:52:57.920
to much background noise.)

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:45.040
Also you must give clearly
what are your preferences are,

00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.160
whom would you like to get married,
if there is somebody in your mind

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.120
you better act.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:58.748
And also after consulting that person.
(Laughter)

00:54:58.747 --> 00:55:03.359
Otherwise it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:10.880
be very embarrassing.
(Laughter)

00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:14.680
And clearly you must state
what sort of person you want to marry

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:21.473
and also clearly about yourself, you see
that what you are doing,

00:55:21.473 --> 00:55:26.920
if you are capable or earning or not,
capable of supporting your wife or not,

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:33.120
such a thing, you must write so that –
or if wife is there she should also write,

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:40.200
if she can help her husband
in any material area or anything,

00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.720
so you must clearly write in the form,
it’s all there, nothing to hide.

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.240
Nothing to say something, which is not there.

00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.400
Because these things can be quite misleading,
all right?

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:55.520
And no leader is going to put anything
absurd now because we have had

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.600
funny experiences before.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:04.200
But there is one thing – getting into
Sahaja Yoga marriage is very different

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.320
from any other marriage.

00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:11.111
Of course, Sahaja Yoga has got
all the facilities for divorce also.

00:56:11.111 --> 00:56:14.600
There is no – that we don’t say
that you cannot divorce.

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.920
You can divorce,
but under certain circumstances.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:22.160
But after marriage some of the people
just get lost.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.560
And this is something – the worst type
of thing that can happen to you.

00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:29.600
They get into their honeymoon mood
and I don’t know what they get into –

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:36.280
all their ideas, romantic ideas come back,
they were just lost with that.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.800
You are marrying here for Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:41.720
That’s the main thing to remember.

00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.320
And don’t forget.

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.800
Because this has been seen with some
percentage of them, not with all that,

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.280
they get lost.

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.280
They start dominating each other,
fighting with each other,

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:59.280
trying to be funny
and some of them are shocked, shocked.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.200
And some have left Sahaja Yoga
because of their marriages.

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:08.840
And another if you have any –
like if you have children

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:15.800
and if there is a case going on –
better not marry. Forget about it.

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.000
If you are free, absolutely free
there is no problem of that kind

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.956
then you better marry.

00:57:20.956 --> 00:57:24.520
But if you have a problem
that another person going to sue you

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:29.080
and do all these things, it’s absurd.
It’s a very common thing.

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:33.800
So, also I would say last thing that
if you have such problems of your children

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:38.760
are with somebody else,
you have to forget about the children

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:44.473
If you have the children with you
then if you [have that lady, who ??]

00:57:44.473 --> 00:57:50.720
always trouble us, talk about Sahaja Yoga,
do this do that.

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:54.320
So, in Sahaja Yoga, you see,
it is not practical.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.360
It’s not practical I have seen.

00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:03.077
If you want to have the children or anything
then the husband if he is against Sahaja Yoga

00:58:03.077 --> 00:58:06.600
he may say that, “All right,
you can be a Sahaja Yogini

00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.680
but I will not allow our children to be in it.”
And he won’t like it.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:14.520
So why don’t have a [liability ?]
and see the child yourself and meet the child.

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:20.680
You don’t have a liability
of children on yourself.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:25.320
In Sahaja Yoga also there are people
who have misbehaved

00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:30.280
who have been with Me for ages –
I’ve treated them just like My own children.

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:34.960
I forgive them because they couldn’t [go on ?].

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:39.320
So this kind of attachment is also is not good
which creates problems for your ascent.

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:42.840
You are in Sahaja Yoga for your ascent.
Your marriage is for your ascent.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:44.680
Your children are for your ascent.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:50.800
Anybody which creates a problem or hurdles
for your ascent you should try to forget it

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.160
because God knows how many times&nbsp;

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:54.920
you have been married in&nbsp;
your last lives? (Laughter)

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:59.000
And how many children you have had.
So all these attachments are superficial.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.200
You are special people
as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.200
So you’ll give it a thought that you are
not going to divorce next day, it’s not good.

00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.640
I don’t like it.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.600
If you don’t want to marry – don’t marry.

00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:15.800
If you want to marry a person
there’s one month choice – you can find out.

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.280
Like somebody – decide for yourself.

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:22.480
You may not fall into love, may not,
that’s also another thing I don’t know,

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.640
what to fall into love.

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:27.840
That kind of thing may not be
and it is not necessary

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:37.440
because if you fall into love
also rise into divorces. (Laughter)

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:41.880
So best thing is not to fall into love
and not to rise into divorces,

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:44.720
but have a balanced idea about marriage.

00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:50.226
See, marriage, it cannot be decided
like the way you have Romeo and Juliet

00:59:50.226 --> 00:59:51.360
or something, nothing of that kind.

00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:56.040
Life is practical, you see, it’s practical life,
your feet should be on the ground,

00:59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.760
you see, absolutely on the ground.
So you won’t lose your balance.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.920
So if you understand that point
then marriage will be successful.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:09.520
But if you try to think of a romanticism
and all that – it just fails.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.320
Of course at the same time I would say
it is not ascetism of any kind at all

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:21.560
but you lead a nice, friendly married life,
in a very friendly manner in every way,

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.760
decent and decorous.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.320
But you do not become sort of over romantic
so that another person runs away

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.280
with your romanticism.

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:34.480
I’ve told many a times about it.

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.600
That you have all the freedom to choose
which ever person you like

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.320
and you can always say,
“No, Mother I don’t want to [belong ?].”

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:44.680
You have all the freedom everything.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.600
I never force you to do anything
even in Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.160
If you want to stay in Sahaja Yoga
you stay all right –

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:52.080
if you don’t want to stay you can go.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.920
So there’s no compulsion of any kind
in Sahaja Yoga.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:02.000
If you don’t want to get married – all right,
if you want to get married – all right.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.440
So it is your Spirit which has to guide you.
I am not going to say anything.

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.780
I’ve never even said that,
“Give up drugs, alcohol – anything.”

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.880
It just works automatically.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:18.080
So if you want to develop a state
of your Spirit you have to listen to it

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.160
and it will be seen in your own life
that you are wise.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.160
You must know how to handle your wife,&nbsp;

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:29.000
how to handle yourself, handle&nbsp;
your tempers and things.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.720
And that’s one of the tests –
that’s the test in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:40.280
So I hope marriage is not the priority,
not the prior thing. It is not that.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.160
It is supportive, it is not the prior.
What is prior is Kundalini.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:54.200
Standing on that primordial principle
and you have to adjust yourself to that principle

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:58.080
and with that you can see
that others can be also adjusted.

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.240
We have ways and methods, silent methods
of improving others – not arguments,

01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:08.520
not talking, not saying harsh things, no,
but silent ways of doing things.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.400
And it works.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:17.200
Of course, if somebody is horrible – like that
I am not going to in any way,

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.140
any way ask him to continue with that person,
all right finish it.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:24.400
But you must know when to finish it.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.560
I mean it’s very surprising that people&nbsp;

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.960
do not want to finish off&nbsp;
with the problems they face,

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.200
because of their children,&nbsp;
because of their husbands,&nbsp;

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.720
this, that. But they are very anxious

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:39.200
to have a divorce, it’s very surprising.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:45.800
It has become like a market, marketing.
It’s so much in the atmosphere –

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:48.920
you must divorce, you must divorce.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:52.120
In India you don’t have anybody
falling into love, I mean,

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.000
we don’t know that part
but we have very good marriages

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.880
and we have lots of children, no problem.

01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.560
And we don’t have divorces either.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:08.880
So you must understand your own position –
specially ladies in the West.

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.200
There is a trick of the trade.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.160
And if they don’t know the trick of the trade
they can never be successful in marriage.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.280
Don’t try to be men.
A man cannot marry a man.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:25.760
Of course, in these days (Laughter)
– but we are not like that.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.200
You have to be ladies
and you have to be gentlemen

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.000
and that’s how the marriages take place.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.120
And that’s how it’s all right –
and not to quarrel, not to fight.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.200
But to love each other,
to understand each other in the same love,

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:46.760
to feel their love. It’s the best thing,
if you know that your love is the highest thing,

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.360
I think. For Me that’s the highest
and makes you so nice and happy,

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.720
because even to love someone,
another person doesn’t love you a little bit

01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:00.200
you cannot get the reflection of your love.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.000
But when you see the other person
also loves you then it’s done.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.996
So it’s a nice way of learning
how to have a private life of love.

01:04:10.996 --> 01:04:12.640
But it’s private.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.760
It’s not public on the street,
in the airport or anywhere. It’s very private.

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.080
The more private you make it the better it is.

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:27.280
And the more you try to express it outside
it’s going to be dangerous, very dangerous.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.520
I have told you many a times that people
who are kissing on the escalator

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:35.920
are going for their divorce.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.560
We are deep people and deeply we should love
and deeply we should understand life.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:49.222
We should not waste ourselves
in nonsensical analysis – all right?

01:04:49.222 --> 01:04:49.240
May God bless you!

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:55.640
So for all those who are getting married
we must give them a hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:18.520
(Applause)

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:42.320
All right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.880
May God bless you all!

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:19.240
I am always with you.
You are always with Me.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:24.280
I know, you are always with Me.
I know that but still you know

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:28.920
sometimes you feel concerned.
Look after yourself.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:43.280
Don’t go out in the fog. (Laughter)

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.000
And meditate, meditate – that you forget.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.596
Every time I need not tell you,
every time need not tell you.

01:07:49.596 --> 01:07:51.400
You must meditate both the times.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.640
Let the children also meditate
otherwise they’ll become difficult children.

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:58.800
Force them to meditate.
They must meditate.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.702
If the children don’t meditate
they will have trouble,

01:08:02.702 --> 01:08:04.240
they will be very troublesome children.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:52.840
So try to make them meditate, all right?
May God&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.400
bless you
