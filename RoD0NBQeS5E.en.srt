1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,280
This day for us to remember that Christ was born on this earth.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,520
As a human being, He came on this earth.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,002
And the task that was before Him

4
00:00:15,062 --> 00:00:20,342
was to enlighten human awareness

5
00:00:21,932 --> 00:00:29,012
with the sense of understanding,

6
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:32,172
but we can say it is actualization,

7
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:36,612
within the awareness of human beings,

8
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:43,572
that they are not this body but they are the spirit.

9
00:00:44,412 --> 00:00:48,852
The message of Christ is His resurrection.

10
00:00:49,652 --> 00:00:55,092
That is you are your spirit and not your body.

11
00:00:56,892 --> 00:01:00,892
And He showed by His resurrection,

12
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:08,972
how He ascended into the realm of spirit – which He was,

13
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:16,052
because He was Pranava, He was Brahma, He was Mahavishnu –

14
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:21,612
as I have told you about His birth.

15
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:35,692
And when He came on this earth, in a body, like a human being,

16
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:39,932
He wanted to show another thing

17
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:44,732
that spirit has nothing to do with money,

18
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:48,932
has nothing to do with power.

19
00:01:51,972 --> 00:02:04,052
It is all powerful, all pervading, but He’s born in a stable,

20
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:19,012
not in a palace or to a king

21
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:25,892
but He was born to a very ordinary person, a carpenter.

22
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:41,852
Because if you are the king, as we say in Hindi language, Badshah

23
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:47,612
then nothing is greater than you, isn’t it? It means simply that.

24
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:52,652
Nothing is higher than you, neither anything can decorate you,

25
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:56,852
because whatever you are, you are at the highest.

26
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:06,972
All the worldly things so called, are just like dry grass, Trinavat.

27
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:12,932
So He was kept in the dried grass.

28
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:20,572
To many it makes very unhappy and they feel very sorry,

29
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:26,212
that Christ, the one who came to save us,

30
00:03:26,452 --> 00:03:30,132
was kept under such conditions and why not God provided Him with

31
00:03:30,332 --> 00:03:35,932
something better? But to such people it does not matter:

32
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:41,452
whether you are lying in the dried grass or in the stable

33
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:45,572
or in the palaces, everything is just the same

34
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:49,492
for it does not touch them, they are so detached

35
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:55,212
and they are completely in joy. They are the masters of themselves –

36
00:03:55,412 --> 00:03:59,412
nothing can master them.

37
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:04,292
No matter can master them, no comfort can master them.

38
00:04:05,532 --> 00:04:09,732
They are masters of complete comforts within themselves,

39
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:12,372
they have achieved all the comforts within themselves,

40
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:15,252
they are satisfied people.

41
00:04:15,932 --> 00:04:19,012
That’s why they are kings, they are called as kings,

42
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:24,132
not those kings who run after things,

43
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:27,372
or those kings who seek comforts in life.

44
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:30,612
I mean if you have comforts well and good.

45
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:36,492
If you don’t have well and good, makes no difference.

46
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:42,732
So many people, specially in Latin America when I went there,

47
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:44,892
they said, “but we can’t understand why

48
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:48,292
Christ was born as a poor man.”

49
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:51,332
This is again the human concept about God is,

50
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:57,012
you see he wants to command God, be born in a King’s palace.

51
00:04:57,212 --> 00:05:04,012
You cannot order Him about. We have our own concepts about God that,

52
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:07,612
“why should He be a poor man; why should He be helpless?”

53
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:10,212
He never showed His helplessness.

54
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:13,892
He was much more dynamic than all your kings and all your

55
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:18,092
politicians put together. He was not afraid of anyone.

56
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,452
Whatever He had to say He said it.

57
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:27,932
He was not afraid of crucifixion or any such “punishment” so called.

58
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:31,012
It’s only the human beings. you see,

59
00:05:31,212 --> 00:05:34,252
who have these false ideas about life

60
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:38,492
and that’s why they want to put these ideas onto God also

61
00:05:38,692 --> 00:05:43,492
and try to make Him follow their own concepts.

62
00:05:43,972 --> 00:05:50,652
God is not your concept. He’s not a concept at all.

63
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:56,692
To also say that “Concept is after all is a concept”

64
00:05:56,892 --> 00:06:00,892
is also a concept – this I found out very recently.

65
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:04,212
This is another myth people carry.

66
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:08,692
Those who say, that “Oh, concept is a concept! All right?

67
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:11,332
Mataji says, all right.” So what?

68
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:19,572
But even this is a concept, because concept is thought.

69
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:23,532
You have to rise beyond thought at a higher level

70
00:06:23,732 --> 00:06:30,172
into thoughtless awareness where you are not in thought but you are

71
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:32,932
in the center of the thought.

72
00:06:33,172 --> 00:06:36,172
In the sense that one thought rises and falls

73
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:39,332
and there is a place in between, another thought rises and fall.

74
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:45,292
You are in the center of these thoughts. The Vilamba as we call it.

75
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:53,412
The time where you pause. Then you will understand Christ.

76
00:06:55,572 --> 00:07:01,332
He was here, partly of course to save us,

77
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,132
because He had many aspects I should say,

78
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:08,332
not only to save human beings He came on this earth.

79
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:12,652
There were many more aspects,

80
00:07:12,852 --> 00:07:16,532
this is also human beings have a demand, you see

81
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:22,412
that that they must be saved, why?

82
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:26,332
One shouldn’t. I Mean from God’s angle if you see,

83
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:29,572
why should they be saved all of them?

84
00:07:29,892 --> 00:07:33,892
What have they done for God?

85
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:38,812
How can you demand God that “You must save us?”

86
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:46,452
Can you? You cannot ask for that.

87
00:07:48,652 --> 00:07:58,892
So He did come to create the passage between as you see here,

88
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:05,892
the Vishudhi and the Sahastrara, this Agnya.

89
00:08:06,532 --> 00:08:12,052
In the primordial being the Virat – He was born there,

90
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,492
to open that door.

91
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:22,932
In evolution, every incarnation has come on this earth

92
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:29,652
to open a particular door within us and to create

93
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:35,852
that opening or that enlightenment in our awareness.

94
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:43,052
So Christ came precisely for opening this small little door,

95
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:49,092
which is constricted by our ego and superego.

96
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:57,172
Ego and superego are the two byproducts of our thought process.

97
00:08:57,492 --> 00:09:02,092
One the thoughts, that are of the past and the other,

98
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,372
thoughts of the future.

99
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:12,412
He came to make that gap, to cross that gap,

100
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:25,732
and that’s how He has sacrificed Himself, His body.

101
00:09:30,092 --> 00:09:40,452
For you it is a very big thing of remorse and repentance,

102
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:47,372
but for such people it is not, it’s a play.

103
00:09:47,732 --> 00:09:51,732
They have to play a certain role.

104
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:54,732
That’s why I do not understand why do you show Him to be

105
00:09:54,932 --> 00:09:56,852
such a lanky, panky, miserable creature.

106
00:09:57,052 --> 00:10:01,452
He was never miserable.

107
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:04,052
Such people can never be miserable as you are.

108
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:08,252
This is another concept of man, that He should be lanky, panky,

109
00:10:08,452 --> 00:10:16,412
tally, skinny, starved, bones coming out, count them one by one.

110
00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:20,612
Horrible! I tell you.

111
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:27,372
From His childhood to His death He was jolly person,

112
00:10:27,692 --> 00:10:35,412
He was happiness, He was joy. To make you all happy,

113
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:38,572
to give you the

114
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:43,972
light of happiness by enlightening your source of joy,

115
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:46,612
that is your spirit in your heart.

116
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:52,012
That He came on this earth – not only to save you –

117
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:56,692
first to give you happiness, to give you joy.

118
00:10:56,892 --> 00:11:02,292
Because human beings in their ignorance and in this tomfoolery,

119
00:11:02,572 --> 00:11:07,052
are unnecessarily beating themselves and destroying themselves.

120
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:13,452
When nobody asked you to go to pubs to get into trouble;

121
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:18,172
nobody has asked you to go to races and become bankrupts;

122
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:24,052
nobody has asked you to go to horrible gurus and get into troubles.

123
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:27,572
But you seek your destruction morning till evening.

124
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:35,652
Then He comes there, like a morning flower, to make you happy.

125
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:42,772
First to make you happy, to give you joy. You see any child.

126
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:44,932
You see any child at least I know Myself,

127
00:11:45,132 --> 00:11:47,692
I don’t know about the funny people here I mean,

128
00:11:47,892 --> 00:11:50,092
for them flowers also look like thorns,

129
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,852
I mean I don’t know how they manage that stuff.

130
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:56,052
But you see a child anywhere, any child,

131
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:58,772
such a joy giving thing it is.

132
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:02,972
And this is the child of the divine –

133
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:07,332
that comes on this earth as a child –

134
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:11,332
is the most joy giving thing.

135
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:16,372
And that’s why Christmas for all of us, for the whole Universe

136
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:22,772
should be a festival of great joy.

137
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:29,972
For He brought light for us by which you could see

138
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:35,052
that there is someone called as “God.”

139
00:12:35,252 --> 00:12:39,212
There is someone, who is going to remove this ignorance.

140
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:43,412
This was the first beginning.

141
00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:55,732
So, for us, it is necessary to be first joyous and be happy

142
00:12:55,932 --> 00:13:03,452
and relaxed, and not to take anything that seriously as we take.

143
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:09,332
Because divine life doesn’t make you serious.

144
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:15,332
Because it’s all a play, it’s a maya.

145
00:13:17,852 --> 00:13:23,692
I have seen in all the rituals that people follow,

146
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:26,052
in all the so called religious people,

147
00:13:26,252 --> 00:13:29,612
they are too serious to be religious.

148
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,092
And religious person is bubbling with laughter.

149
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:36,092
He doesn’t know how to hide his joy.

150
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:41,332
And he doesn’t know how to control his laughter when he sees people

151
00:13:41,532 --> 00:13:43,532
who are unnecessarily serious.

152
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:46,652
I mean nobody’s dead. The way they people say it,

153
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:49,492
it’s sometimes, you just don’t know what to do with yourself.

154
00:13:49,772 --> 00:13:52,172
You just can’t control.

155
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:56,252
So there’s nothing in this world for a person like Christ

156
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:58,132
to feel sad about.

157
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,132
And if you really believe in Him,

158
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:04,332
then please first of all give up your, this silly sadness

159
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:10,812
and sulking and sitting down and becoming morose,

160
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:16,492
not talking to anyone, silent bores allover.

161
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:19,292
That is not the way to look at Christ.

162
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,172
See how He went and talked to multitudes,

163
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:30,412
how He opened His hands to all the people around

164
00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:36,372
and how He tried to give them happiness.

165
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:41,812
He has said that you are to be born again.

166
00:14:42,012 --> 00:14:46,012
That means, He had to do this work

167
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,772
and that you have to get it

168
00:14:47,972 --> 00:14:53,052
sometime He had promised that you are to be born again.

169
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:56,452
Christ is to be born within us.

170
00:14:56,692 --> 00:15:00,652
I don’t know what Christians understand out of this.

171
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:03,412
How do you become born again?

172
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:06,492
Not by going through a ritual of christening,

173
00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:09,172
somebody coming from a theological college

174
00:15:09,372 --> 00:15:11,052
cannot make you a Christian.

175
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:16,332
Like in our India we have some paid Brahmins,

176
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:19,612
as you have here paid people you see,

177
00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:23,332
the whole day they will eat, drink, be merry and evening time

178
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:27,532
they’ll come and pray and preach, that sort of people.

179
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:35,612
You have to be a person who is authorized by God.

180
00:15:36,052 --> 00:15:42,172
Unless and until you are authorized by God, you cannot give joy.

181
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:45,092
And that’s why I’ve seen all these people the so called…

182
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:50,732
big pundits and the big… priests

183
00:15:50,932 --> 00:15:56,532
and all of them are so serious because they are not authorized by God.

184
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:03,292
Even on a Christmas day, I mean anybody who comes from a village

185
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:07,492
may think there’s a funeral going on.

186
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:13,772
And after the funeral they go home. How do you celebrate?

187
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:18,452
With a champagne! And after the funeral also real funeral

188
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:20,372
also they’ll celebrate the… I don’t know why,

189
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:24,572
but they take champagne.

190
00:16:27,772 --> 00:16:33,132
How can you celebrate Christ by insulting Him.

191
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:35,932
He came to enlighten

192
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:40,252
your awareness because He respected your awareness,

193
00:16:40,452 --> 00:16:45,452
the point at which it had reached, but you are trying to put it down.

194
00:16:45,652 --> 00:16:49,652
Is this the way to understand Him?

195
00:16:50,972 --> 00:16:56,492
And He has promised that you are to be baptized,

196
00:16:56,692 --> 00:17:00,332
you are to be born again. And now, in Sahaj Yoga,

197
00:17:00,532 --> 00:17:04,452
this promise is being fulfilled. So be joyous,

198
00:17:04,652 --> 00:17:09,132
that here at the Agnya chakra, again Christ is born within you

199
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:15,572
and He’s there and you know how you can ask for his help, always.

200
00:17:16,612 --> 00:17:21,852
But the main thing that one has to understand,

201
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:29,252
that the time has come for you to get all that is promised

202
00:17:29,572 --> 00:17:34,132
in the scriptures. Not only in the Bible, but all the scriptures

203
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:38,132
of the world the time has come today.

204
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:47,052
That you have to become a Christian, a Brahmin, a Peer,

205
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,972
through your Kundalini awakening only.

206
00:17:51,172 --> 00:17:59,212
There is no other way out. And that your last judgment is also now.

207
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:07,532
Only through your Kundalini awakening, God is going to judge you.

208
00:18:08,332 --> 00:18:11,612
How is He going to judge you otherwise, you think of somebody now.

209
00:18:11,812 --> 00:18:14,972
A person comes in, now here is somebody sitting to judge you.

210
00:18:15,172 --> 00:18:19,172
How? By how many hair dressers you have been to?

211
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:22,532
Or how many suits you have stitched for the Christmas?

212
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:26,692
Or what presents you have bought and how many cards you have sent?

213
00:18:26,892 --> 00:18:31,612
And to how many people you have

214
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:36,372
sent some other things which may not be very palatable.

215
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:39,612
That’s not the way.

216
00:18:40,092 --> 00:18:45,252
Or is it, that at what price you bought all the things?

217
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:52,612
The way we are particular? Which way are we going to be judged

218
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:58,652
by God?

219
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:04,612
Not superficially people say, so what depth have we got, let’s see?

220
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,852
How far can we go in our depth?

221
00:19:09,132 --> 00:19:15,172
At the most we reach a point where we are nothing but a concept again.

222
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:18,732
So whatever depth we know goes up to only rationality

223
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:21,732
up to the concept point beyond that we can not reach.

224
00:19:21,932 --> 00:19:25,932
So how can we be judged?

225
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:32,452
How do people are judged if you go to a doctor?

226
00:19:32,692 --> 00:19:36,692
He has his instruments, an’ he works it out, puts the light in,

227
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:41,892
sees for himself and says this is the position.

228
00:19:42,452 --> 00:19:49,052
And how your spirituality is going to be judged?

229
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:55,292
How a seed is judged? By sprouting it!

230
00:19:55,612 --> 00:20:01,572
When you sprout the seed and when you see its germinating power

231
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:04,012
you know it’s a good seed or a bad seed.

232
00:20:04,212 --> 00:20:09,612
In the same way, you will be judged by the way you are germinated,

233
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:13,412
the way you receive your realization, the way you retain it,

234
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,052
the way you respect it.

235
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:18,452
That is how you are going to be judged and not by the kind of dresses

236
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,612
you are wearing.

237
00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:25,572
By the type of matching you do and the hair dressing you go to.

238
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:30,132
Not by the big positions you occupy and the big politicians

239
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:32,452
and big bureaucrats you become.

240
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:39,292
Not by what kind of houses you have built and what kind of so called

241
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:42,532
Noble [sic] prizes you have won.

242
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:46,372
You are not also going to be judged by your philanthropic work

243
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:49,932
by that you think that you have given so much money so much so,

244
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:51,972
because you, if you have given so much money

245
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:56,052
there will be big ego somewhere hanging and it will bring you down

246
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:58,652
your scale.

247
00:20:59,772 --> 00:21:03,572
This is a judgment in which

248
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:09,612
the little feather is going to weigh more, much more than a ship.

249
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:17,532
It’s a different type of a judgment, of a personality.

250
00:21:17,892 --> 00:21:23,412
You can see how Christ was judged by human beings

251
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:28,732
and how He was judged by God.

252
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:40,212
He came and lived in the dried straw like a feather.

253
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:45,972
His mother never felt His discomfort.

254
00:21:49,772 --> 00:22:01,612
In the same way those who have not by there being,

255
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:10,932
oppressed others or taken oppression, are going to be judged

256
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:15,372
as first class.

257
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:20,572
In the Kundalini awakening itself there are inherent defects.

258
00:22:20,812 --> 00:22:24,652
Inherently the Kundalini has some defects,

259
00:22:24,852 --> 00:22:28,852
because of your previous karmas.

260
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:33,732
Because what you have been doing in this lifetime.

261
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:40,172
Because, the things that you have accepted as

262
00:22:41,372 --> 00:22:44,692
reality, which is just a concept.

263
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:48,452
Because, when you have not known the absolute,

264
00:22:48,692 --> 00:22:50,332
whatever you will be doing,

265
00:22:50,532 --> 00:22:54,532
there will be a little of ignorance with it.

266
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:56,932
Whatever you have done in darkness

267
00:22:57,132 --> 00:23:01,132
will have a particle of darkness in it.

268
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:05,492
So without knowing realization if you have propagated,

269
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:10,772
“Oh, we are great saints, this that,” you’ll have no chance.

270
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,292
If you think you are a very divine personality,

271
00:23:14,492 --> 00:23:19,692
and you are already a realized soul, no chances!

272
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:23,012
All the priests of all the religions,

273
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:28,172
will be the last to get realization.

274
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:34,732
Valmiki in his Ramayana, has very clearly said,

275
00:23:34,932 --> 00:23:39,532
a very interesting story is there, that, a dog was asked

276
00:23:39,732 --> 00:23:42,412
what do you want to be in your next life?

277
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:47,172
So he told “make me anything but don’t make me a Mathadhish.”

278
00:23:47,412 --> 00:23:51,412
A person. Mathadhish is a person like a “priesthood.”

279
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:57,692
So make me everything but not a priest anywhere.

280
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:03,172
Just imagine a dog having that wisdom.

281
00:24:05,132 --> 00:24:09,652
But I do not say that all of them are like that.

282
00:24:09,932 --> 00:24:12,172
There may be some who are really genuine,

283
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:16,692
some may be really realized people, may be authorized by God.

284
00:24:16,892 --> 00:24:19,812
But I am sure they are not accepted, by the multitude,

285
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:24,132
I am sure of that. Because I have seen your history and all that,

286
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:29,972
I’ve seen all such people have been discarded and have been tortured.

287
00:24:30,692 --> 00:24:40,452
But now the time has come… to judge the right and the wrong.

288
00:24:41,652 --> 00:24:47,052
You cannot crucify anymore. you cannot.

289
00:24:47,412 --> 00:24:52,892
Everyone is going to be judged through Kundalini awakening.

290
00:24:53,132 --> 00:25:00,772
Now, we should know there are three categories of human beings.

291
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:04,652
I don’t know which way to start, not to shock you,

292
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:12,052
one is human beings as we are, normal. They are called as Narayoni.

293
00:25:12,412 --> 00:25:14,972
The second categories are Devayoni.

294
00:25:15,172 --> 00:25:18,052
Those who are born seekers or realized souls,

295
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:21,332
mostly realized souls are Devayoni.

296
00:25:21,532 --> 00:25:26,292
And the third ones are called as Rakshas. These are called as Ganas.

297
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,452
Actually these are called as Ganas.

298
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:34,172
But is the We can say the species among human beings are Rakshasas.

299
00:25:34,372 --> 00:25:37,292
Means the people who are evil.

300
00:25:37,692 --> 00:25:43,412
So we have evil people, excellent people,

301
00:25:43,612 --> 00:25:51,292
and we have in-between people. Excellent people are very few.

302
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:56,372
They are born realized. I don’t have their problem much.

303
00:25:56,652 --> 00:26:01,612
But one has to deal with the people who are in the center.

304
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:10,532
They are looking towards good but have something hanging on to them,

305
00:26:10,732 --> 00:26:13,052
which is not so good.

306
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:17,532
So for these people, there are inherently some defects

307
00:26:17,732 --> 00:26:21,052
in the Kundalini, which we must understand.

308
00:26:21,252 --> 00:26:27,292
The first of them is bad health,

309
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:34,052
physical bad health, actual physical bad health.

310
00:26:35,772 --> 00:26:42,492
In this country specially people suffer from too much of cold

311
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:47,092
and other troubles due to over calcium in the water,

312
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:51,212
in the same way according to the countries,

313
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:54,732
stanavishesh as they call it, you have your problems.

314
00:26:54,932 --> 00:26:57,652
Like in our country we have some problems;

315
00:26:57,852 --> 00:26:59,812
like in your country you have certain problems.

316
00:27:00,012 --> 00:27:04,252
So, the physical problems are according to the country

317
00:27:04,452 --> 00:27:05,692
where you have taken your birth.

318
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:12,092
Most of you have decided to take birth in particular countries.

319
00:27:13,972 --> 00:27:18,412
That’s why you are identified also to such an extent sometimes

320
00:27:18,612 --> 00:27:22,492
that you think there is no defect.

321
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:28,332
Every country has a variety by which you suffer a certain

322
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:32,172
amount of setback in your health.

323
00:27:32,732 --> 00:27:34,972
So for a Sahaj Yogi

324
00:27:35,172 --> 00:27:39,372
one should know that health is a very important thing.

325
00:27:39,572 --> 00:27:42,332
Because this body is the temple of God,

326
00:27:42,532 --> 00:27:45,132
and one has to look after your health.

327
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:48,292
And you know also when the Kundalini rises the first thing that

328
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:50,972
happens that your health improves.

329
00:27:51,172 --> 00:27:54,012
Because of the parasympathetic fulfillment.

330
00:27:54,212 --> 00:28:00,572
Because parasympathetic gives you enlightenment

331
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:06,732
which flows into sympathetic and your health improves.

332
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:12,372
I will not tell about it very elaborately today because time is short.

333
00:28:12,572 --> 00:28:17,852
But, if you read My..I would say I haven’t yet written much,

334
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:20,492
but if you listen to My lectures,

335
00:28:20,692 --> 00:28:23,292
and some of them which are written down,

336
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:30,172
you will know how Kundalini helps to cure most of the diseases,

337
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:37,852
except for which are being tampered by human elements,

338
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:41,892
like a kidney trouble now has been cured by Sahaj Yoga.

339
00:28:42,092 --> 00:28:45,212
No doubt, we can cure kidney trouble.

340
00:28:45,452 --> 00:28:48,812
But a person who has been on the machine, we’ve tried,

341
00:28:49,012 --> 00:28:50,692
cannot be cured.

342
00:28:50,892 --> 00:28:54,892
We can give him longevity, but he cannot be cured.

343
00:28:55,212 --> 00:28:59,332
But to cure people is not your job at all by any chance,

344
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:00,572
you must remember this.

345
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,812
No Sahaj Yogi should take to curing people.

346
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:06,532
They can use my photograph.

347
00:29:06,732 --> 00:29:11,052
But not to take to curing, because it means you are a big

348
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:13,572
philanthropic personality.

349
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:16,892
I have seen people who have been curing,

350
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:20,452
get into such a mania of curing,

351
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:23,692
that they forget that they are also catching something and

352
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:26,532
they are also getting some troubles and they never cure them self,

353
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:32,012
ultimately I find they get out of Sahaj Yoga.

354
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:36,332
But with the Photograph you can cure people.

355
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:41,892
Do not think that it is your duty that you are a great sort-of-a…

356
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:48,972
what you call a… benefactor, physical benefactor, no, you are not.

357
00:29:49,292 --> 00:29:53,292
You are a spiritual benefactor but as a byproduct,

358
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:59,932
the body of the person improves because if

359
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,532
Christ has to be awakened,

360
00:30:03,772 --> 00:30:11,572
if God has to come in this body, then this body is to be cleansed.

361
00:30:12,212 --> 00:30:16,212
It is done by Kundalini.

362
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:23,932
But it does not have a separate work like hospitals.

363
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:28,572
I have known people who went so mad with their power of curing that

364
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:32,772
they started visiting regularly the hospitals,

365
00:30:32,972 --> 00:30:36,532
and they ended up in the hospital only.

366
00:30:36,732 --> 00:30:39,372
They would not even come to programs;

367
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:42,012
they would not even come and see Me.

368
00:30:42,212 --> 00:30:44,852
So this is one of the greatest hurdles you have got

369
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:52,452
is the Vyadhi, is the bodily elements.

370
00:30:54,292 --> 00:31:00,172
And the bodily element also should not take you down too much.

371
00:31:00,412 --> 00:31:03,332
If we have some problem, forget it.

372
00:31:03,532 --> 00:31:05,972
Gradually it will improve, with some people it takes time

373
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:07,932
to get all right.

374
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:12,892
But the main thing is, to get to your spirit.

375
00:31:13,092 --> 00:31:18,572
So do not always say “Mother, cure me, cure me, cure me.”

376
00:31:18,852 --> 00:31:22,052
But just say “Mother give me the spiritual life,”

377
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:25,812
and you will be cured automatically.

378
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:30,052
It may take time in some people, doesn’t matter.

379
00:31:30,252 --> 00:31:32,892
You have been sick all your life, doesn’t matter.

380
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,772
Little more time.

381
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:39,292
And also follow the methods which [I HAVE …del] we have told,

382
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:46,172
about different diseases, specially liver in this country, colds,

383
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:50,372
and what you call this gout and all these troubles.

384
00:31:50,572 --> 00:31:55,612
We have remedies for all this. Diabetes, we have,

385
00:31:55,932 --> 00:32:05,772
but work it out as a duty towards your body, towards the temple.

386
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:10,692
But that should not be the end of your life,

387
00:32:10,892 --> 00:32:13,252
that’s a very little part.

388
00:32:13,452 --> 00:32:17,212
I mean it would be something like cleaning the whole place…

389
00:32:17,412 --> 00:32:19,932
and then you get out of it. They say “Why did you clean?”

390
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:23,452
Like I have seen here people, you see, even we were in Oxstead

391
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:26,932
I was surprised, you see everybody used to polish everything you know,

392
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:31,572
and everything was, sort of, lawn was done very well

393
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:34,932
and everything cleaned very well, and not even a rat would enter

394
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:36,172
their houses even.

395
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,772
For months together I never saw any person getting in,

396
00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:43,452
only getting out, and they were so particular.

397
00:32:43,652 --> 00:32:47,652
Husband wife, so particular about cleanliness, neatness, everything…

398
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:50,492
and the both of them would never even talk to each other,

399
00:32:50,692 --> 00:32:54,812
I have seen that. There were seven houses, except for our house,

400
00:32:55,012 --> 00:32:57,452
and [SHE WAS …del] they were all surprised at how many people are

401
00:32:57,652 --> 00:32:59,852
coming to our house, they said “Are you a open house?

402
00:33:00,052 --> 00:33:01,652
I said “Yes, it is a open house.”

403
00:33:01,852 --> 00:33:05,852
They couldn’t understand what was wrong with us.

404
00:33:06,412 --> 00:33:08,732
Nobody would see that polished thing or anything,

405
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:12,932
so, that’s how it should be that we should not go to that extent.

406
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:17,572
That it becomes a sort of real “Sahaj Yoga and the rest”

407
00:33:17,772 --> 00:33:20,212
which is the most important is forgotten.

408
00:33:20,612 --> 00:33:24,612
Health will improve gradually as I have told you.

409
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:29,492
But attention should be on your spirit.

410
00:33:29,892 --> 00:33:34,772
Attention should be on your spirit, because it is the attention,

411
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:39,012
which goes into these various directions and gets stuck.

412
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:42,852
You just allow it to work out and it will work out.

413
00:33:43,132 --> 00:33:52,612
The second hurdle which I feel, is called as akarmanyeta.

414
00:33:53,132 --> 00:34:01,332
Osnath, they call it. Means a person… does not want to work it out.

415
00:34:01,652 --> 00:34:03,692
Of course those people who are useless,

416
00:34:03,892 --> 00:34:06,932
who do not want to have realization, forget about them.

417
00:34:07,132 --> 00:34:11,052
But even after getting realization, it’s an innate problem

418
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:16,532
with people that they do not want to work it out.

419
00:34:17,132 --> 00:34:22,212
They are lazy; in simple words, they are lazy.

420
00:34:22,412 --> 00:34:24,852
That is very much in this country, surprisingly.

421
00:34:25,052 --> 00:34:28,892
I mean the other day I saw a picture, where how, even from your

422
00:34:29,092 --> 00:34:35,212
country people went to Germany and blasted a complete machinery

423
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:38,372
and a complete factory of that machinery which was sending

424
00:34:38,572 --> 00:34:41,372
pilot-less bombs.

425
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:44,732
And they have overdone everything so then our children are having a

426
00:34:44,932 --> 00:34:54,452
nice time, perhaps. But, in Sahaj Yoga, you have to be alert .

427
00:34:55,252 --> 00:35:00,052
This what exactly happens in Sahaj Yoga when people come here:

428
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:03,052
they get their realization, they feel the cool breeze,

429
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:08,132
and is lost again. The reason is, they do not want to work it out.

430
00:35:08,332 --> 00:35:11,652
This is another danger, akarmanyeta.

431
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:16,132
Then, when it is lost, after one year they’ll come back “Mother?

432
00:35:16,332 --> 00:35:19,932
We don’t believe in it, but I have got some pain in the stomach,

433
00:35:20,132 --> 00:35:22,532
will You cure me?”

434
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:28,372
Instead of… you becoming so equipped with all the powers that you

435
00:35:28,572 --> 00:35:31,772
have, you become another useless person coming here,

436
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:38,212
just to take My time. These powers are all within you.

437
00:35:38,412 --> 00:35:42,732
This is your property. This is the property of your spirit

438
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:47,852
which is there inside, which is about to manifest but,

439
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:54,292
because of certain hurdles that you accept, that it does not.

440
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:59,092
This is akarmanyta, we can say.

441
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:02,732
Which is, not working it out, not knowing about it,

442
00:36:02,932 --> 00:36:05,732
not understanding it, what is Sahaj Yoga is,

443
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:09,092
how to manipulate this, what are these vibrations are,

444
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:16,212
how it works out? People just say, “Oh! It’s too much.”

445
00:36:16,492 --> 00:36:19,772
Because they don’t want to face the reality.

446
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,412
Because as soon as your Kundalini comes up,

447
00:36:22,612 --> 00:36:26,212
as soon as the light comes in before, the eyes are closed,

448
00:36:26,412 --> 00:36:29,812
you see suddenly the light comes in, you don’t want to open your eyes.

449
00:36:30,012 --> 00:36:33,132
Because too much we have been sleeping.

450
00:36:33,412 --> 00:36:35,572
Even if you open your eyes a little bit, “Oh God!”

451
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:37,612
You don’t want to face the light.

452
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:40,652
Because you are identified with that state,

453
00:36:40,852 --> 00:36:44,852
you do not want to open your eyes.

454
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:50,172
Kundalini opens your eyes, no doubt, but again you close it down.

455
00:36:50,492 --> 00:36:56,292
So it is in your freedom, to give up that akarmanyeta.

456
00:36:56,652 --> 00:37:02,052
Now this is also, can be very collective, I can tell you this much.

457
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:05,332
It’s a very big disease, which spreads.

458
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:09,932
Like, say a husband wife is there, the wife is one like that.

459
00:37:10,132 --> 00:37:14,452
Instead of the husband raising the wife, he will succumb to wife,

460
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:18,132
specially in the west. Just the opposite in India,

461
00:37:18,332 --> 00:37:22,852
because [THE del] there the husband is more dominating,

462
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:26,292
the women will succumb to a husband.

463
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:31,572
So what happens is, that out of the two those who have got it also

464
00:37:31,812 --> 00:37:33,492
are just wasted.

465
00:37:33,692 --> 00:37:37,052
Instead of that, both of them could be very well realized,

466
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:40,892
and could be there if the one who is realized,

467
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:45,532
puts down his will, that “No, I’ll keep my eyes open to see.

468
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:52,292
Let me see. I must give a chance to myself.” If they accept it,

469
00:37:52,572 --> 00:37:57,812
then it works and then they go to the second step.

470
00:37:58,172 --> 00:38:03,452
Everything cannot be just like a jet liner, sit down here and…

471
00:38:03,652 --> 00:38:09,932
next moment you are on the… moon?

472
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:13,452
Even if you are in the moon,

473
00:38:13,732 --> 00:38:17,172
still you may start with the third danger which is there,

474
00:38:17,372 --> 00:38:23,772
is sanshaya. Is the doubting.

475
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:30,212
I don’t know how to describe this madness of doubting.

476
00:38:30,492 --> 00:38:34,812
For example, out of all of you who have been here,

477
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:41,172
I would say, at least, I don’t know how much percentage…

478
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:42,492
[Yogi very softly:] Ninety.

479
00:38:42,732 --> 00:38:45,892
[Shri Mataji:] [laughs] …have come out with the second day

480
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:51,412
a very great statement “Still I am doubting.”

481
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:57,652
Is that the sign of wisdom? What are you doubting?

482
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:03,292
What have you found out so far?

483
00:39:03,892 --> 00:39:07,092
From where does this come?

484
00:39:07,332 --> 00:39:12,812
Is Mr. Ego, about which I have given lectures after lectures.

485
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:16,932
Is Mr. Ego that is doubting it?

486
00:39:17,132 --> 00:39:19,492
Because he doesn’t want you to find the absolute.

487
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:23,092
You are identified with your Ego,

488
00:39:23,292 --> 00:39:25,852
and you do not want to find it because,

489
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:29,412
this Mr. Ego has been guiding your life throughout,

490
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:33,652
and now [YOU DON’T …del] you want to doubt. Doubt what?

491
00:39:34,652 --> 00:39:41,132
What are you doubting? You felt the cool breeze, all right?

492
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,572
Sit down then.

493
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:45,852
It would be something like somebody entering into a college,

494
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:50,852
university, and they are going sitting down firstly there,

495
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:54,812
teacher says “Now, this is the diagram, I give you.”

496
00:39:55,012 --> 00:40:00,172
The students get up and say, “Sir we doubt.” Really?

497
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:04,492
Then what should the teacher say. But they will not say that,

498
00:40:04,692 --> 00:40:11,932
because they have paid the fees. They have paid it.

499
00:40:12,372 --> 00:40:16,732
Even if it is a horrible drama, boring one,

500
00:40:16,932 --> 00:40:19,612
still we go through it because we have paid, you see?

501
00:40:19,812 --> 00:40:25,172
To go through it “After all, we have paid it,” you see? What to do?

502
00:40:26,012 --> 00:40:30,012
But for Sahaj Yoga you cannot pay.

503
00:40:31,332 --> 00:40:36,452
I have seen all kinds of tomfoolery people accept in so many gurus.

504
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:40,412
Like somebody says “I am going to teach you how to fly.”

505
00:40:40,652 --> 00:40:43,612
They’re absolutely ready for that.

506
00:40:43,812 --> 00:40:46,692
They’ll pay money, and not doubt, even a bit,

507
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:49,812
that the fellow who is propagating is he flying?

508
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:51,532
Have you seen him flying anywhere?

509
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:54,332
Please at least ask that person to fly.

510
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:57,612
They will see the Kundalini rising with their eyes,

511
00:40:57,812 --> 00:41:00,652
they will see it pulsating, rising, breaking here,

512
00:41:00,852 --> 00:41:03,212
still they’ll sit down and say “I am doubting.”

513
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:07,732
Now who are you? How far have you reached?

514
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:12,012
Why are you doubting? What are you doubting?

515
00:41:12,852 --> 00:41:15,292
What have you known so far about yourself?

516
00:41:15,492 --> 00:41:20,772
Now, humble down yourself at this point Humble down in your heart.

517
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:27,412
“No I have not known myself. I have to know myself.

518
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:31,772
I have not known myself, I haven’t got the absolute.

519
00:41:31,972 --> 00:41:33,892
With what instruments I am doubting?”

520
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:37,692
This is one of the greatest hurdles of Kundalini awakening

521
00:41:37,892 --> 00:41:42,652
and in after awakening, called as Samshaya.

522
00:41:42,932 --> 00:41:46,812
[THE SECOND …del] The fourth one we can call it as Pramaada,

523
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:53,572
is the one by which we go on faltering all the time…

524
00:41:55,172 --> 00:42:00,212
foolish questions. I mean there are certain things one has to follow,

525
00:42:00,412 --> 00:42:02,692
if you are going on the road you see,

526
00:42:02,892 --> 00:42:06,292
you are used to say continental driving,

527
00:42:06,492 --> 00:42:10,612
so always you turn on the wrong side,

528
00:42:10,812 --> 00:42:14,372
but in London you will be arrested.

529
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:18,572
In the same way so far you have been doing continental driving.

530
00:42:18,932 --> 00:42:26,292
Now you are in London, so you better take to the ways of Londoners

531
00:42:26,492 --> 00:42:31,132
and understand the roads and the maps and the regulations

532
00:42:31,332 --> 00:42:37,572
that are needed, and try to follow them. But you are doubting it.

533
00:42:37,852 --> 00:42:42,132
That’s the main point. Then you don’t want to follow it.

534
00:42:42,332 --> 00:42:45,892
So the pramad is the mistakes that arise,

535
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:53,812
because Kundalini awakening is a free gift to anyone who comes here.

536
00:42:55,252 --> 00:43:02,972
To anyone who has been to any sort of hell or heaven or has done…

537
00:43:03,172 --> 00:43:04,612
[Break in original recording, end of tape side 1]

538
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:11,612
point about it. And why do you doubt. You are not paying any money.

539
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:14,212
These two things go hand in hand –

540
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:18,732
doubting and pramad is the mistakes that we commit throughout.

541
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,892
Because we are doubting, that’s why we do not take it up seriously,

542
00:43:22,092 --> 00:43:24,172
we do not understand it – the rule of the road –

543
00:43:24,372 --> 00:43:32,772
and we just start driving. And then we have accidents.

544
00:43:33,332 --> 00:43:38,372
And then when we have accidents we blame Mataji for that.

545
00:43:40,892 --> 00:43:47,012
That is a very-very, common thing that happens,

546
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:50,692
that we blame Sahaj Yoga.

547
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:53,732
We blame that spontaneous happening within us;

548
00:43:53,932 --> 00:43:56,172
we never take the blame upon ourselves,

549
00:43:56,372 --> 00:43:59,212
that “No, I must have done this mistake.” All right, doesn’t matter,

550
00:43:59,412 --> 00:44:03,412
if I make mistakes I will rectify, it’s all right.

551
00:44:04,572 --> 00:44:09,332
Mother is forgiving, no doubt, I forgive,

552
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:12,092
but sometimes my forgiveness is also of no use

553
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:15,212
because unless and until you realize that it was a mistake

554
00:44:15,412 --> 00:44:18,092
you should go this way instead of that you have gone that way,

555
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:22,292
so rule of the road is to be understood.

556
00:44:22,652 --> 00:44:27,572
That is the one comes to us, called as pramad.

557
00:44:27,772 --> 00:44:34,212
After that, we have another inherent problem is called as

558
00:44:34,412 --> 00:44:38,892
Bhramadarshan, hallucinations.

559
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:42,412
We start seeing hallucinations, specially with people who take

560
00:44:42,612 --> 00:44:44,692
LSD and all [THE …del] such things.

561
00:44:44,892 --> 00:44:48,892
They don’t see Me sometimes they just see lights.

562
00:44:49,652 --> 00:44:54,892
Or any such hallucinations you see of the future or of the past.

563
00:44:55,172 --> 00:44:56,932
They may see Me as something else

564
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:58,892
and they may see Me as something else.

565
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:01,292
If you see Me in dreams is all right,

566
00:45:01,492 --> 00:45:03,652
or see something in dreams is all right.

567
00:45:03,852 --> 00:45:10,852
But you start seeing some things, that’s called as Bhramadarsha.

568
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:16,012
Bhrama means illusion. Then you start developing illusions.

569
00:45:16,252 --> 00:45:21,412
But the worst part of it is that people start telling lies about it.

570
00:45:21,932 --> 00:45:28,652
I know about everyone. And when this bhramadarshan starts,

571
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:33,732
it’s the most dangerous thing about vibrations also.

572
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:40,492
Some people are absolutely cocksure about themselves, I see that.

573
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:44,412
And they’ll tell all the world, you see they’ll dominate everybody

574
00:45:44,612 --> 00:45:46,212
saying that “The vibrations of this is not good,

575
00:45:46,412 --> 00:45:47,932
the vibrations of that is not good,”

576
00:45:48,132 --> 00:45:51,972
while they have no mastery over it.

577
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:54,612
Now if I, somehow or the other,

578
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:58,012
see I have to be very careful I can’t talk like a teacher,

579
00:45:58,212 --> 00:46:01,252
so I somehow or other say that “All right, you give yourself a bandhan

580
00:46:01,452 --> 00:46:03,412
and now you put your hands towards me and you see for yourself,”

581
00:46:03,612 --> 00:46:04,852
and all that.

582
00:46:05,052 --> 00:46:12,092
If they by any chance know that I’ve found out, that they are lying,

583
00:46:12,332 --> 00:46:14,492
then they are finished.

584
00:46:14,732 --> 00:46:19,372
I must keep up their falsehood everything in me.

585
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,972
In by chance you see, I am very careful though because I know

586
00:46:23,172 --> 00:46:25,332
they are always on a slippery ground,

587
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:33,292
so even if I mention in a way that is not so blunt or anything,

588
00:46:33,492 --> 00:46:40,492
still it might happen. But one must know that it is for our good,

589
00:46:40,852 --> 00:46:46,212
that we have to stick on to the truth. And we should not be led away

590
00:46:46,452 --> 00:46:51,572
by our own ideas about ourselves.

591
00:46:55,332 --> 00:47:02,692
Then [THE – del] another thing comes is – Vishaychitta.

592
00:47:03,012 --> 00:47:06,652
In which the attention is attracted by objects

593
00:47:06,852 --> 00:47:10,732
of your previous identification.

594
00:47:10,932 --> 00:47:14,412
Like your attention has been, “You see I’m very found of cricket,”

595
00:47:14,612 --> 00:47:20,252
“all right, you are.” But you should not be a sick person.

596
00:47:20,532 --> 00:47:25,932
I mean cricket doesn’t mean that you become a cricket bat.

597
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:28,292
And you are good for nothing for anything else,

598
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:31,292
for all practical purposes you are dead.

599
00:47:31,492 --> 00:47:37,932
That kind of craziness, for anything whatsoever,

600
00:47:38,452 --> 00:47:41,972
gets your attention into a very wrong state,

601
00:47:42,172 --> 00:47:44,972
and is also not good for all the Sahaj Yogis.

602
00:47:45,172 --> 00:47:48,012
Today’s lecture is more for the Sahaj Yogi.

603
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:53,892
So I am pointing out what are the inherent dangers of

604
00:47:54,172 --> 00:48:01,452
sustaining our realization. Which is very important to understand.

605
00:48:02,892 --> 00:48:08,172
Now the two other very big dangers which we suffer from,

606
00:48:08,372 --> 00:48:10,892
apart from that the people get possessed

607
00:48:11,132 --> 00:48:13,612
and get ideas into their heads,

608
00:48:13,812 --> 00:48:18,212
they start singing songs, this that Sometimes I am so embarrassed,

609
00:48:18,412 --> 00:48:22,292
I don’t know what to say, I can see a devil speaking through them,

610
00:48:22,492 --> 00:48:25,292
but I just don’t know how to tell them that “Oh please stop.”

611
00:48:25,492 --> 00:48:28,892
Even praising Me I know what it is.

612
00:48:29,092 --> 00:48:32,972
But they’ll just come up and say, “Mother, we want to sing a song to

613
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:36,212
you.” “All right, finished.” I can not say anything,

614
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:39,292
because they do not know what they are singing.

615
00:48:39,492 --> 00:48:42,132
They do not know from where did they get this knowledge.

616
00:48:42,332 --> 00:48:46,332
It’s something else doing this.

617
00:48:48,332 --> 00:48:52,332
Because of all these problems that you get possessed,

618
00:48:53,092 --> 00:48:55,252
the other day somebody came to me and said,

619
00:48:55,452 --> 00:48:59,692
that “Mother I’m feeling very overconfident about myself and cocksure.”

620
00:48:59,892 --> 00:49:03,092
“Really?”“And I feel like doing something very high handed,”

621
00:49:03,292 --> 00:49:10,892
and he did it. First he saw the possession coming in to him.

622
00:49:11,492 --> 00:49:15,772
And then he did it, and did it in a very bad way.

623
00:49:15,972 --> 00:49:21,652
Everybody’s angry with him. I know, but I’m not.

624
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:24,492
Because something is done in possession,

625
00:49:24,692 --> 00:49:29,092
you don’t know what madness people can do when they get possessed.

626
00:49:29,332 --> 00:49:32,372
I mean they should end up in lunatic asylum, but because of being

627
00:49:32,572 --> 00:49:36,132
Sahaj Yogis, they do all these things.

628
00:49:36,332 --> 00:49:41,612
But still they are not stationed where they should be.

629
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:47,812
Then there are two more stages in which,

630
00:49:48,172 --> 00:49:52,452
a Kundalini which rises also falls down.

631
00:49:52,652 --> 00:49:57,132
This is an inherent danger in a person. Many people have asked Me

632
00:49:57,332 --> 00:50:01,172
that “Mother, if we get realization does it stay?”

633
00:50:01,372 --> 00:50:06,652
It does stay, part of it. Sometimes it is very thin part of it,

634
00:50:06,852 --> 00:50:12,412
sometimes the whole thing is sucked back. It is sucked back.

635
00:50:12,732 --> 00:50:15,372
Is so, then you will say “Then we start doubting.”

636
00:50:15,572 --> 00:50:20,332
Where is it written that, “You will be lifted up

637
00:50:20,532 --> 00:50:27,452
and put into something great, whatever may be your problems.”

638
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:31,452
Is it possible? Even from here if I have to go to India,

639
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:35,132
I have to get inoculations and vaccinations,

640
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:40,972
and I have to get My passport, go through an interview…

641
00:50:41,172 --> 00:50:45,172
While if you have to enter into the kingdom of God,

642
00:50:45,372 --> 00:50:49,932
then you are going to be judged, not only judged,

643
00:50:50,132 --> 00:50:54,052
but even when supposing you give a grace mark and all that

644
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:57,172
and a person is allowed to sort of, get into the plane,

645
00:50:57,372 --> 00:51:01,812
may be that they may ask you to get down. Is possible.

646
00:51:02,132 --> 00:51:07,252
And that happens with some people that the Kundalini falls down.

647
00:51:07,572 --> 00:51:13,292
Is very, very dangerous sign. It comes through many problems

648
00:51:13,492 --> 00:51:19,132
like gurus and, going to wrong places also going to spirits

649
00:51:19,332 --> 00:51:26,892
and doing all black magic and, also bowing before people who are not

650
00:51:27,172 --> 00:51:33,332
incarnations, worshipping wrong type of deities and also doing

651
00:51:33,532 --> 00:51:39,692
mad rituals. Fasting at wrong times and not understanding

652
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:44,572
the signs of fasting and of ritualism and chakras and the

653
00:51:44,772 --> 00:51:49,692
connection a complete synthesis of Sahaj Yoga.

654
00:51:50,252 --> 00:51:54,652
And it falls down. In some people you have seen that Kundalini rises

655
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:58,812
and immediately falls down is a very, very dangerous thing which

656
00:51:59,012 --> 00:52:01,572
really is very troublesome also.

657
00:52:01,772 --> 00:52:05,772
But still one can fix it up.

658
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:11,252
Last danger that we have which one should know that you start feeling

659
00:52:11,452 --> 00:52:17,732
that you have become God or some like an incarnation or something.

660
00:52:18,132 --> 00:52:22,012
This is the biggest danger. And then you start taking law into your

661
00:52:22,212 --> 00:52:30,172
own hands and start rebuking others or… doing all kind of highhanded

662
00:52:30,372 --> 00:52:37,932
business. Or getting over self-satisfied with yourself.

663
00:52:38,212 --> 00:52:40,572
This is a very big danger.

664
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:48,212
Humility is the only way, to know that there’s an ocean before you.

665
00:52:48,492 --> 00:52:53,852
You have got into the boat all right, but you have to know a lot,

666
00:52:54,132 --> 00:52:59,292
you have to understand a lot, and you have to still attend to your

667
00:52:59,492 --> 00:53:04,252
attention, to your chitta, to your awareness.

668
00:53:04,532 --> 00:53:09,012
And you have to still work it out in such a way

669
00:53:09,212 --> 00:53:16,372
that you really establish your self, as a full-fledged Sahaj Yogi

670
00:53:16,572 --> 00:53:20,572
by which collectivity becomes a part and parcel of your being.

671
00:53:20,772 --> 00:53:24,452
By which you have no doubts left.

672
00:53:24,652 --> 00:53:28,932
From thoughtless awareness you jump into doubtless awareness.

673
00:53:29,132 --> 00:53:33,052
Unless and until that happens within you, is not mind,

674
00:53:33,252 --> 00:53:36,252
but is a state in which only the Kundalini will rise,

675
00:53:36,452 --> 00:53:38,932
whenever you’ll raise your hands.

676
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:42,212
Unless and until you have achieved that state,

677
00:53:42,452 --> 00:53:49,292
please try to work it out, don’t be lazy.

678
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:52,972
You have to see around yourself, meet people, talk to them,

679
00:53:53,172 --> 00:53:56,492
the more you talk about it the more you do it the more you give it,

680
00:53:56,732 --> 00:53:58,772
the more it will flow.

681
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:03,052
The more you sit at home, “Oh, I am doing my puja at home.” Nothing.

682
00:54:03,732 --> 00:54:07,572
It will stagnate and stagnate. You have to give it to others,

683
00:54:07,772 --> 00:54:11,772
you have to think of others. Thousands of them have to have it.

684
00:54:12,412 --> 00:54:16,772
And that’s why it is important that don’t get bloated with the idea

685
00:54:16,972 --> 00:54:20,412
that you have all the powers of the world, already manifesting.

686
00:54:20,612 --> 00:54:21,852
Never.

687
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:26,852
When these powers really manifest you are really not aware of them.

688
00:54:27,092 --> 00:54:32,932
Absolutely. I mean imagine the Sun saying “I am The Sun.”

689
00:54:33,252 --> 00:54:36,132
Will he say so? When he is the Sun, what is there?

690
00:54:36,332 --> 00:54:38,092
If you go and ask the Sun “Are you The Sun?”

691
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:42,292
He said “Yes, by the way I am, what can I do about it?”

692
00:54:43,652 --> 00:54:46,692
It’s that simple, you know you become a very simple person,

693
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:51,092
absolutely simple, because there is no…

694
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:56,172
camouflage, there’s no complication. You are that.

695
00:54:57,332 --> 00:55:01,772
So, anybody asks you funny questions you say, “By the way,

696
00:55:01,972 --> 00:55:04,692
what is there to ask?, It is so. I mean, if I am a realized soul,

697
00:55:04,892 --> 00:55:08,892
I am, what does it matter?”

698
00:55:11,572 --> 00:55:16,932
With this understanding we have to go to Sahaj Yoga,

699
00:55:17,132 --> 00:55:23,532
which I must say I am surprised, how it is working, miraculously.

700
00:55:24,652 --> 00:55:28,932
And it is working out, but it is you who can settle it,

701
00:55:29,132 --> 00:55:36,492
within yourself. Now, among you some are only on the periphery.

702
00:55:36,852 --> 00:55:40,492
We keep them on periphery also, that you know very well.

703
00:55:40,772 --> 00:55:43,572
Some of them come in the center.

704
00:55:43,852 --> 00:55:49,612
And some are very few, who are in the inner circle.

705
00:55:49,812 --> 00:55:54,852
All of them are still in a state where they can be thrown out,

706
00:55:55,092 --> 00:55:57,212
like a tangent go down, you see?

707
00:55:57,412 --> 00:56:00,772
And then you don’t understand why a Sahaj Yogi behaves like that.

708
00:56:00,972 --> 00:56:04,052
If you see some Sahaj Yogi behaving like that, going in a tangent

709
00:56:04,252 --> 00:56:08,252
know that you might do the same. So be careful.

710
00:56:09,092 --> 00:56:16,932
So, today, at this juncture, when we are celebrating the great event

711
00:56:17,132 --> 00:56:21,132
of Christ’ life, let us know that Christ is born within us,

712
00:56:21,372 --> 00:56:25,372
and the Bethlehem is within us.

713
00:56:26,572 --> 00:56:30,252
You don’t have to go to Bethlehem it’s within us.

714
00:56:30,452 --> 00:56:38,372
He is there, and we have to look after it. It’s still a child.

715
00:56:38,932 --> 00:56:44,292
You have to respect it, and you have to look after it.

716
00:56:44,612 --> 00:56:47,812
So the light… really glows

717
00:56:48,012 --> 00:56:52,932
and people know that you are realized souls.

718
00:56:53,132 --> 00:56:56,292
Nobody will doubt that you are not.

719
00:56:56,382 --> 00:57:02,942
May God bless you, all.
