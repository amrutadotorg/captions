00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:42,770
Yesterday
you have seen how Durga used to protect all

2
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:58,347
the seekers, sadhakas, and how She killed
the people who have been troubling, torturing,

3
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,317
killing the seekers of truth.

4
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:11,388
Her whole advent was to protect them from
all these evil forces.

5
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:19,169
In those days, that was the most important
work.

6
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:30,579
So that's how the sadhakas came up to these
modern times, and now they are seekers of

7
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:37,110
truth or they have found the truth.

8
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:56,040
All this different passage has taught the
sadhakas what is the use of their life.

9
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:06,469
They were frantically, first, trying to find
the truth, frantically, and they went into

10
00:13:06,469 --> 00:13:08,490
different difficult places.

11
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:22,930
They thought by going into some lonely places
they'll be able to settle their mind in peace

12
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,010
and they'll be able to find the truth.

13
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:36,660
Also they sacrificed many things: their wealth,
which was bothering them; their families,

14
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,190
they thought was standing in the way of their
search.

15
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:53,359
All this
went on and there are still some people who

16
00:13:53,359 --> 00:14:00,910
believe that by becoming an ascetic one can
find the truth.

17
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,089
Buddha did the same.

18
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:07,410
Mahavira did the same.

19
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,130
Their life was nothing but a great tapasya.

20
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:26,199
Their tapasyas are helping us today in such
a way that we now have got such a blessing

21
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:37,259
that our personalities, as they are, can receive
Self Realization for which people struggled

22
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:51,930
and struggled in such a way that if you read
that, how they were suffering, you might be

23
00:14:51,930 --> 00:15:02,520
really amazed how they went through all this
suffering and all this tapasya, just with

24
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:10,160
the goal to get their Self Realization.

25
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:18,720
It is an ordeal even to read about them and
to know about them.

26
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:26,100
And while they were seeking, also, there were
so many people who tried to trouble them,

27
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,580
who tried to torture them, who tried to kill.

28
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:40,499
And the people surrounding them didn't know
what they were doing.

29
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:45,560
They used to ridicule them, laugh at them,
make fun of them.

30
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:56,700
With all this, what we learn that we have
got our Self Realization very easily, without

31
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:03,000
any torture, without any ordeal, without any
sufferings, fasting, nothing.

32
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,950
It's not true.

33
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:15,810
Because you are the same people who have done
all this before and that's why you are here.

34
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,450
It's your matter of right to have your Self
Realization.

35
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:26,230
It's no way is to say that “without anything
we got it”.

36
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,570
Because it is life after life you have been
seekers.

37
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:36,910
Whatever path you followed, whatever religion
you followed, whatever faiths you followed,

38
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,350
it was a torture for you.

39
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:46,880
And this torture is today now fulfilled, that
today you are self-realized people.

40
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:55,800
But in any way we see that human beings, if
they get something rather easily they don't

41
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,940
understand the value of how they got it.

42
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:12,680
Now to get this easily, actually you must
know, is not just because you were nothing.

43
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,780
You were something great.

44
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:24,790
You were great saints went into Himalayas,
you did all kinds of ordeals and fasting and

45
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:32,220
where so many of you were killed and butchered
in the name of God.

46
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:41,660
So today, whatever you have got, whatever
Realization you have got, is not just something

47
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,560
you should think that "It's only Mother's
grace that we have got it."

48
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:57,760
It's your own great personality which has
achieved it.

49
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,650
Otherwise, it would have been impossible for
Me to give you Realization.

50
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:10,870
Whatever the work the deities have done, they
have brought you to this level of human existence,

51
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,710
protecting you.

52
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:23,680
But now, naturally, just this is the last
step which you have crossed and you have achieved

53
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:35,440
this Self Realization and so many of you have
achieved great heights.

54
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:44,360
This power within us, the Kundalini, which
has connected you to this all-pervading

55
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:59,530
Power, has been struggling, has been guiding
you, has been all the time looking after you,

56
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:06,160
protecting you so that you should achieve
your goal in this Kali Yuga.

57
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:12,090
It was said that only during Kali Yuga this
will happen and those people who are seeking

58
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:21,810
God in the mountains and in the valleys will
find it, but they'll be normal people, people

59
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:31,210
who will have household and living like normal
people in the society.

60
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:39,020
They won't be some sort of sadhus or saints,
but people who are married, who have children,

61
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,710
all such people who are leading a very normal
life will receive their Realization.

62
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:50,230
It’s already said, it’s already predicted
by Bhrugu Muni.

63
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,199
So it's all been already said, I think all
been planned.

64
00:19:55,199 --> 00:20:02,540
But in this a credit goes, of course, to you
people, that you have recognized what is the

65
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
truth.

66
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,319
As you know, there are so many false people
going about.

67
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:15,520
They are doing all kinds of tricks, they are
trying all kinds of methods to entice people.

68
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,660
Despite that, you have recognized Me.

69
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,789
This recognition is something very remarkable.

70
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:31,580
And I am Myself surprised how, like lost children
finding their mother, come back to her, in

71
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,950
the same way all of you are here.

72
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:42,870
But in this we should not think that we have
got it easily, or we have got it without any

73
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:50,780
difficulties, because this can create a little
problem that we will not go further with the

74
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:56,989
same speed, with the same dedication as we
have been doing before.

75
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,929
So whatever you think is easy, was not easy
at all.

76
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:01,939
It is sahaja.

77
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:05,299
It is, one can say, spontaneous.

78
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:13,700
But, now it is for you really to understand
that this time is so important, we have to

79
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:20,489
save the whole world, that you have to project
yourself, as I said last time, and to find

80
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:26,069
out ways and methods how you can do these
things.

81
00:21:26,069 --> 00:21:32,489
In Russia, I must tell you, I had a very good
experience of a very highly developed soul

82
00:21:32,489 --> 00:21:34,379
who is a very well known scientist.

83
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:41,200
He’s one of the biggest scientists of Russia,
and he’s indulging also into spirituality.

84
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,499
He told people that “I’m indulging into
spirituality, I would like to see Mother.”

85
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:49,729
I said, “All right, I would love to see
him.”

86
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:58,610
So when he came, he looked at Me and he said,
“I know Mother, that You are the incarnation

87
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,309
of God in these modern times.”

88
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:05,809
I was quite surprised for a scientist to say
that.

89
00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:13,390
But his eyes, so pure and so full of devotion
and humility.

90
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,970
Then he says that “I want to do something
if You help me.”

91
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,640
I said, “What do you want to do?”

92
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,379
He said, “I cannot measure Your power, I
cannot.”

93
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:31,739
He had an instrument by which he could measure
the power.

94
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:36,140
“I can’t also measure the power of Your
photographs.”

95
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,860
He said, he told Me a number which I couldn’t
understand, was something – seven hundred

96
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,590
raised to power, some sort of a billion into
billiardi, like that.

97
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,950
I said, “Now what’s this number is?

98
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:47,960
I don’t know.”

99
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,900
So he told Me that “This is what Your photograph
is.”

100
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,970
So I said, “All right, now what do you want
Me to do?”

101
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,770
I told him, “You can take this photograph
if you think it is so powerful.”

102
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,830
So he took the photograph with such respect
and this thing.

103
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,920
At least four, five times he bowed to Me.

104
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,369
I said, “What do you want to do about it?”

105
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:11,600
He said that “I want to put it on a satellite.”

106
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,890
Now see the projection part – satellite.

107
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,939
“Then what will you do?”

108
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:25,159
“And I’m going to put electromagnetic
force behind it so this will, the power that

109
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:29,950
is in this one, will penetrate into things.

110
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:35,319
Because electromagnet can penetrate, with
that these vibrations will also penetrate.

111
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:44,129
So I will go onto the satellite and from there
I’ll project this and I’ll see the global

112
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:50,030
problems.

113
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,599
Then wherever I’ll project this the problems
will be solved.

114
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:59,619
I’ll try to first of all make the land fertile
with this.”

115
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:02,559
One photograph of Mine, can you imagine?

116
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,999
See his projection.

117
00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:05,309
I was amazed, you see.

118
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:07,580
I said, “Look at this man.

119
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,400
What he has been thinking all the time.”

120
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:14,069
He said, “This is not difficult, it’s
not difficult.”

121
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:15,069
I said, “How?”

122
00:24:15,069 --> 00:24:19,189
So he showed Me with a spring, you know, something
was like a spring.

123
00:24:19,189 --> 00:24:26,010
He put it on water which I had vibrated and
the spring started jumping.

124
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,989
And then he showed with his machine that the
whole thing was moving so fast, you see.

125
00:24:30,989 --> 00:24:35,239
“Mother, just see the water that You have
vibrated, how great it is.”

126
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:41,919
I said, “This is, I’ve never heard that
you can transform this power into something

127
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,619
which will work out on material thing.”

128
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:48,059
He said, “This power can work out in anything.

129
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:52,420
It is this power which has created everything,
so it will work out in everything.”

130
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:58,819
I was so surprised, and he said, “I’ve
been just waiting to meet You and this I’m

131
00:24:58,819 --> 00:24:59,819
going to start.

132
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:02,650
I’ve got a lot of work to be done.”

133
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:07,210
And he told his friend, “Now let’s go,
we have lot of work to be done.

134
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,360
I want to do all this in the lifetime of Mother.

135
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,129
She should see what we have to do.”

136
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:22,099
I was amazed from where this fellow has dropped
on this earth.

137
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:31,970
Such an experience of a scientist.

138
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,569
In the West, no scientist will even look at
Me.

139
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:42,049
Nobody will think that they can do something
about these vibrations.

140
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:49,070
But you see, he has already developed a method
by which he can measure the vibrations, you

141
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,070
see.

142
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,679
I don’t know, I didn’t ask him any further
questions because I thought he’s too much

143
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,640
in it and let him do what he likes.

144
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:12,700
And you see, I find that in Russia, people
are very highly placed and they have many

145
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,150
ideas, but spirituality is the main thing,
and morality.

146
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:23,780
There was another gentleman I would say he
was hardly about thirty, thirty-two years

147
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,520
of age, very much sparkling.

148
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,280
He came, I asked him, “What do you want
Me to do?”

149
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,010
He said, “No, You have done too much for
us, now we’ll do for You.”

150
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,979
“So what do you want to do?”

151
00:26:39,979 --> 00:26:42,659
He said, “I’m in charge here of spirituality.”

152
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,510
Can you imagine?

153
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:50,749
We have no such government where there is
a subject like spirituality that somebody

154
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:52,679
is in charge of spirituality.

155
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:53,679
This is Russia.

156
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,090
I said, “You are in charge of spirituality?”

157
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:05,450
“Yes, and I have to deal with students from
very young age to the college.

158
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:12,840
And can You tell me, Mother, at what age the
children are more receptive of spirituality?”

159
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:19,580
I said “There is no hard and fast rule about
it.

160
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:27,340
But as children, very small children because
they are so innocent, it works out.”

161
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:33,499
So he asked Me, “How do we put spirituality
into them?”

162
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:38,809
I said “You can raise their Kundalini, you
can tie them up and they will become really

163
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:43,719
people with such an attention that you will
be amazed at that.”

164
00:27:43,719 --> 00:27:49,069
He said “I’m gathering all the people
of all the faiths and I’m going to tell

165
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:53,129
them that it’s only Sahaja Yoga which is
the right path.”

166
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,619
Can you imagine?

167
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:01,499
Such a wonderful person, hardly thirty-two
years of age, I mean one better than the other,

168
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:02,580
I thought.

169
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,080
One really better than the other.

170
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,660
Then he asked Me the schemes, “What should
we do for patriotism, what should we do for

171
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,700
this...”

172
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:21,739
He was so much alert and he said, “Through
spirituality, how can we improve their lives?

173
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:23,969
Of the students?”

174
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:32,749
Now he’s in charge of all the students of
Russia and he is also a member of the parliament.

175
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:39,569
He said, “There are other eight, nine members
who are also in the same committee and they

176
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:46,290
want spirituality to grow.”

177
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,290
I was amazed.

178
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,400
I mean what a country is this Russia?

179
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,770
How could they have such people?

180
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,210
Then the third one came.

181
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,630
He was also member of parliament, very dynamic.

182
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:05,040
First he was right hand man of Yeltsin but
then he gave him up.

183
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,270
He said, “He’s not moral.

184
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:10,090
I don’t want to have anything to do with
a person who’s not moral.”

185
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:12,150
“So now what are you doing?”

186
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:19,230
He said, “Now we are thinking of getting
elected by some, another party.

187
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,079
Name is My Motherland.”

188
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,380
I said, “Very good idea.”

189
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:29,880
“So in that we’ll not have fixed ideas
like it is a democracy or a, you can call

190
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,500
it, communism or this.

191
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,050
But whatever suits my motherland, that we’ll
have.”

192
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:43,530
It’s a very practical, is a most practical
thing that whatever will be good for my motherland,

193
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,060
that we will have.

194
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,079
Nothing else.

195
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,349
I said, “Really this is very practical.”

196
00:29:49,349 --> 00:29:54,380
And he may one day replace this Yeltsin and
all that.

197
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,130
Very dynamic, very nice.

198
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:03,670
Just now he was little bit depressed, because
he said, “They are stupid people over here,”

199
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,599
and this and that.

200
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,890
But then he got very hopeful, I said, “We’ll
help you all out” and that.

201
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,360
But such a truthful man.

202
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:19,050
And he said, “The basis of human life is
morality.

203
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,370
If you have no morality, then all the rest
is nonsense.”

204
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:29,990
He studied in England and he said also in
America for quite some time, and the other

205
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,990
fellow had studied.

206
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:36,920
And they said in America they got fed up absolutely
and, “We don’t want to go back there.”

207
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:44,339
So the wisdom of these people really was very
striking to Me.

208
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:52,199
Now the another, third thing, which I discovered
is even much more deeper than this.

209
00:30:52,199 --> 00:31:02,550
When I went to Ukraine, I saw some very nice
paintings done with a very aboriginal sort

210
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,630
of colors.

211
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,360
So they said, “Mother, this we had before
the Christians came in.”

212
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:18,160
They showed Me a magazine in which there was
a photograph of the Primordial Mother and

213
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,699
they called it Aditi, that’s Sanskrit.

214
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:21,699
We too also call it Aditi.

215
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:23,170
Can you imagine?

216
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:29,680
Then they said, “This culture existed before
the Christian aggression came in.”

217
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:39,719
And there was paintings of Mooladhara Chakra
in different ways and also of Agnya Chakra.

218
00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:45,430
And the way they were talking about all this,
even in the magazine, I was really surprised.

219
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:57,839
They said that “All this was published,
we have books on this, but because of the

220
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:03,870
church it was all said, “It’s all nonsense,
there’s nothing like Aditi.”

221
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:19,420
But the best part I saw was the picture of
the Aditi and there was a Kundalini in Her

222
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
stomach.

223
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,800
Or stomach or lopa.

224
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,870
And was shown going upward like that.

225
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,280
I said, “Look at this culture these people
had.”

226
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:36,469
Then they said, “We had relations with India,
and they were Aryans and we were also Aryans

227
00:32:36,469 --> 00:32:38,980
and we used to meet them.”

228
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:44,630
So I thought, Macchindranath and all these
people had gone to the north of India, they

229
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:51,069
might have come to this Ukraine, and they
said that, I mean the whole thing was traced

230
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:57,590
to - Ukraine name came from Kuru and all kinds
of things were traced in Sanskrit.

231
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,030
All this I was amazed.

232
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:02,349
What a culture they had!

233
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:04,309
In what culture they lived!

234
00:33:04,309 --> 00:33:07,280
It’s something, you know, unbelievable.

235
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,900
While in India there are many people who don’t
know what is Kundalini.

236
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,570
If you tell them Kundalini, they think Kundalini
means horoscope.

237
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:17,599
Especially in the North they have no idea
of Kundalini.

238
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:26,240
But here are the people who have really, have
lived in a culture for thousands of years,

239
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,610
and they said this was before Christ three
thousand years.

240
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,610
Can you imagine?

241
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,740
Before Christ, three thousand.

242
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:39,820
And, so we too had civilizations in India,
like Harapa and all that of that time.

243
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,969
But they said India is the source of spirituality.

244
00:33:44,969 --> 00:33:49,590
That magazine, I was amazed at it and the
way it was done.

245
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:54,910
And the Mooladhara and the Agnya Chakra and
all that done so well.

246
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,939
Maybe they might have seen it.

247
00:33:56,939 --> 00:34:03,559
They might not have got Realization but they
talked about Realization and also about achieving

248
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,750
Self-hood.

249
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,890
This was so many years back.

250
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:13,199
But then they said, “The Christian religion
came and they told us, ‘It’s all nonsense,

251
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,620
have nothing to do with it.’”

252
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:21,709
As they told Me also in Greece that they had
Athena and Primordial Mother and all that.

253
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:23,480
But they said, “No Mother, nothing.

254
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,679
Better stop it.”

255
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,089
So it was all cancelled and nobody looked
at it.

256
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:35,560
But can you imagine that so many years back
it existed in that Ukraine?

257
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,300
Such a beautiful culture of spirituality.

258
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,980
First time I went to Ukraine we had people
there.

259
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:51,880
There was a Chernobyl, you know that, was
a big explosion and they were all - like somebody

260
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,839
had these fingers cut out or you can say,
attached to each other.

261
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,880
Somebody had boils all over the body.

262
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,540
Somebody’s nose was turned like that and
horrible looking like lepers they were, all

263
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,670
of them, those who came to the program.

264
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,790
But then this time, more than this were the
people there in Ukraine, I must tell you,

265
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,469
much more than that.

266
00:35:14,469 --> 00:35:21,250
The whole hall was full, the three tier was
full, the passages were full and still the

267
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,969
people outside were standing.

268
00:35:24,969 --> 00:35:30,459
And they said, “We were the ones who suffered
from this and now look at us we are completely

269
00:35:30,459 --> 00:35:31,459
cured.”

270
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:33,790
You won’t believe, I never touched anyone.

271
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:41,849
I was there only once, they came to My program
and they got cured.

272
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,870
So this sensitivity that they had.

273
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:51,490
I used to wonder why these Russians and Ukrainians
are so sensitive to spirituality.

274
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:58,599
Then I realized that these people who have
got spirituality is ancient.

275
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:01,880
From ancient times they were practising this.

276
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,709
And we had Macchindranath, Gorakhnath - all
these people.

277
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:11,920
But nobody practiced Kundalini awakening to
this extent that it was in every village they

278
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:20,270
used to make the paintings about Mooladhara,
about this another Agnya Chakra very clearly.

279
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:28,309
And in the Agnya Chakra was Ing and Ang of
the Chinese, can you imagine?

280
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:33,969
After discovering that, I really felt that
in the world there must be lots of people

281
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:34,969
like that.

282
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:41,550
Now in Colombia I have seen also, they have
the same Kundalini and a Kumba and everything.

283
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,750
I think that’s even more than that.

284
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,700
Three, four thousand years back before Christ.

285
00:36:48,700 --> 00:37:00,640
So what we find, that we had all this knowledge
in all these countries and is still, that

286
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,699
knowledge is still, working in the minds of
the people.

287
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:18,530
They are very introspective and also they
know a lot about the sun.

288
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:26,209
It is this kind of sensitivity comes only
when, basically in the roots of that country

289
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:30,349
you have exposure to spirituality.

290
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:38,340
It’s a kind of a miraculous revelation one
could see there.

291
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:46,510
How they knew everything about Kundalini,
about the Primordial Mother, about this happening,

292
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:53,540
about spirituality and what happens to a person
when he becomes a realized soul.

293
00:37:53,540 --> 00:38:01,860
The speciality I saw about them, they’re
extremely humble people.

294
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:07,750
To them I am really, I don’t know, how they
bow to Me and it’s, sometimes I just can’t

295
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:14,000
imagine how these people have such sense of
spirituality and such peace.

296
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,209
When they had this coup, I asked them, “Aren’t
you worried?

297
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:23,370
This coup is here and I don’t know what
will happen to your country.

298
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,380
Aren’t you worried?”

299
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,750
They said, “Mother why should we worry?

300
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,939
After all we are in the Kingdom of God.

301
00:38:29,939 --> 00:38:35,349
We are not living in Russia, we are living
in the Kingdom of God.

302
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:39,459
So why should we worry?”

303
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:45,140
And meeting such nice people there, such sensitive
people to spirituality.

304
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:51,059
They have thrown away practically all the
false gurus, all the false gurus.

305
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:54,480
And for Me they showed such respect and such
care.

306
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,569
They had this conference only for Me.

307
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:04,200
So now why I’m telling you all this, that
now you all have got Realization.

308
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:15,469
You have now felt your Spirit and you have
entered into the Kingdom of God, no doubt.

309
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:25,429
But now you must understand that this power
that you have, what it does to you.

310
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:30,849
What it creates in you.

311
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:41,579
The most important thing is by this power
you become thoughtlessly aware.

312
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,370
That is you come in the present.

313
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:54,250
To achieve the present is an impossible task.

314
00:39:54,250 --> 00:40:01,160
So you, once you are in thoughtless awareness
what happens that no thoughts bombard your

315
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
mind.

316
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,640
Wherever you may be, you may be in America,
you may be in any place.

317
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,839
You are not bombarded by thoughts.

318
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,099
So, what does that mean?

319
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:22,330
Into very simple language we can say, it means
that you do not reflect.

320
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:25,240
You do not have a reflecting mind.

321
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:35,750
Now this is the basic problem of Sahaja Yogis
of today, which one should try to conquer.

322
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,110
That you do not reflect.

323
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:43,719
That’s the only way you can achieve your
steadiness.

324
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:53,329
For example I have seen people, for nothing
at all they’ll just start laughing, nothing

325
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:54,870
at all.

326
00:40:54,870 --> 00:41:03,079
They see somebody, immediately they react
– “This was nice but not so good.”

327
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:07,679
They start giving their opinions, especially
in the West, about everything.

328
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:16,920
Everybody seems to be very knowledgeable and
start telling what is best and what is not

329
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,319
the best, what is not good.

330
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:27,660
And once they start saying something like
that, mind becomes reflective.

331
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,679
If the mind is not reflective, then you are
thoughtless awareness.

332
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:34,770
Watch anything, just you watch.

333
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,260
Just witness.

334
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,260
You should not reflect.

335
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:45,070
If you are using your mental power, then this
power subsides.

336
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:52,370
This is a very common defect with people because,
I think, you people are more intelligent,

337
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,370
you think.

338
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,760
Maybe, I think, you are well educated, might
be.

339
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,829
I don’t know, whatever you think.

340
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:04,380
But this reflecting mind is a very dangerous
thing for spirituality.

341
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,559
You’ll never grow.

342
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:13,610
And then with the reflecting mind, you have
different emotions with something you reflect

343
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,390
on somebody.

344
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:22,120
Now if it’s your son or daughter or something,
you get identified.

345
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,020
Identification with some is artificial.

346
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,219
It’s not in reality.

347
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:32,969
But because this mind reflects, it identifies.

348
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,559
Now many identifications you have dropped
out.

349
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:43,520
For example your bias about religion, about
races, about maybe nationalities, you have

350
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,849
dropped out.

351
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:52,219
But still I would say, the reflecting mind
still acts and this is the greatest hurdle

352
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:54,610
for the progress of Sahaja Yogis of today.

353
00:42:54,610 --> 00:43:04,329
I’ve been thinking, “Why is it the reflecting
mind is so active in Sahaja Yogis of today?”

354
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:15,309
If you could stop reflecting, immediately
you establish yourself in the ocean of peace.

355
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:19,199
You watch something, just watch.

356
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:23,780
There’s no ripple of thought in your mind.

357
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,190
Then you become extremely creative.

358
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,459
You become extremely dynamic, you become extremely
compassionate.

359
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:33,449
You have no fear.

360
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:38,849
Some people think, “If you are compassionate
you see this man might lynch me”.

361
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:40,920
You have no fear.

362
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:49,449
All virtues that you have to enjoy you can
only enjoy when you do not reflect.

363
00:43:49,449 --> 00:43:54,250
That means that you leave everything to the
Divine.

364
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,530
You are not in charge.

365
00:43:56,530 --> 00:44:02,929
You don’t see that you have to be reflecting
on something.

366
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:12,169
This is the greatest power you have got, is
not to reflect, not to look at somebody with

367
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:13,679
that kind of thing.

368
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,280
I have seen this is still there lingering.

369
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,459
Perhaps I never told you about it, maybe one
of the reasons.

370
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:28,020
I don’t say that it’s only your fault
but maybe Mine, because I couldn’t find

371
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:37,919
what was exactly wrong, that is the reflection
that you have about others.

372
00:44:37,919 --> 00:44:41,559
Now I told you, have introspection.

373
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:50,990
For introspection also it can be reflection,
but that at least gives you idea as to where

374
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:51,990
you are.

375
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,669
But with that psychologically you can become
extremely depressed.

376
00:44:56,669 --> 00:45:00,110
You can condemn yourself.

377
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:08,459
Then you may not understand yourself as a
personality that you are and you’ll go on,

378
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:14,049
sort of, losing your vibrations, losing your
power.

379
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:18,510
Because you are not control of yourself.

380
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:26,719
So introspection, also, if it brings about
depression and demeaning of your personality,

381
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,340
best is not to introspect also.

382
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:34,640
Because all these mental activities, I have
seen, create problems.

383
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:44,510
But in a state where you are thoughtlessly
aware, introspection comes to you automatically.

384
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,590
You see it automatically.

385
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,909
You understand it automatically.

386
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:56,130
You do not think about it, it just comes to
you.

387
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:02,730
The whole picture comes to you and you are
at peace with yourself.

388
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,830
You are never in turmoil, never in trouble.

389
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,389
Then you don’t get angry.

390
00:46:09,389 --> 00:46:18,590
Then you do not argue, then you do not discuss,
but you become as if dropped in to the ocean

391
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:27,060
of awareness and you don’t have to worry
as to solve something.

392
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:35,460
When you are reflecting, then you find that
this power works.

393
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:42,220
Now it becomes very contradictory to say that
you have to project and you don’t have to

394
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,330
reflect.

395
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:47,609
Now when we reflect we absorb.

396
00:46:47,609 --> 00:46:53,340
When we reflect on something, we absorb that
thing.

397
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:58,050
And mostly our attention goes to the defects
of others, “This person is no good, that

398
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:02,930
is not good, this is, her hair is not all
right, the sari’s not all right.”

399
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:06,550
This, that and all nonsense.

400
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:11,480
So what are we doing, we are absorbing all
the bad things also.

401
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:17,230
Now when you start admiration of something.

402
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:25,369
Then what happens that you may not get the
good things but at least you are on a better

403
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:26,369
line.

404
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:32,170
But still, the admiration in thoughtless awareness
is really very deep.

405
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:37,440
I saw this in the eyes of this great scientist.

406
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:47,180
Absolutely he was just one with Me, and his
eyes were like an ocean of peace.

407
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:56,270
He was just looking at Me, and for quite some
time and then he came to his thoughts and

408
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:00,770
he told Me that “This is what we can do
with Your photograph.”

409
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:06,560
So the depth in you will only come when you
do not reflect.

410
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,190
But it’s very common with human beings,
specially in the West, “this carpet is no

411
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:20,409
good, that is no good, this smell is coming,
that is there,” always trying to judge others,

412
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:21,550
judge other things.

413
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:23,110
This is important?

414
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,670
What is so important?

415
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:31,109
If you are sitting in the garden of heavens
what does it matter where you are sitting,

416
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:35,560
what you are doing?

417
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:42,540
This sets in, this reflection, sets in waves
of thoughts in our mind.

418
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,860
I have already, once, described it by drawing.

419
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:54,760
How the energy that falls on the right side
goes to the left side and the falls on the

420
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,849
left goes to the right.

421
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:03,630
Crosses over because of two types of cells
we have.

422
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:10,860
Then out of this energy that goes to the right,
the energy that goes to the left it is sucked

423
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,260
in partly into the sympathetic.

424
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:20,480
Now whatever is left out is the one that reflects.

425
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,659
That is the way it goes on reflecting.

426
00:49:23,659 --> 00:49:30,609
Now if you can suck in all that energy and
put it on our sympathetic, then all our energies

427
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:32,690
will be thousand fold much more.

428
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:42,530
We’ll not be tired, we’ll not be unhappy,
we’ll be able to stand lots of nonsense.

429
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:46,890
But we’ll not call it a nonsense, we’ll
not think it’s a bad thing, so it has no

430
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:50,460
effect on us.

431
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,530
This quality we have to develop.

432
00:49:53,530 --> 00:50:00,139
I would say with this, today’s special celebration
of Navaratri.

433
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:08,350
Like yesterday you saw the Durga’s nine
forms also.

434
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,000
In that is one is Kushmanda.

435
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:18,450
As this was told that you absorb all the filth
within yourself, in your stomach.

436
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,240
But Devi does that, not you.

437
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,310
What a Devi can do, you should not do.

438
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,740
That’s Her job, that She’s supposed to
do these things, not you.

439
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:40,379
What you have to do is to only be in silence
so that you absorb whatever will increase

440
00:50:40,379 --> 00:50:44,220
that silence, will increase your depth.

441
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:48,159
Devi will look after all the other, rest of
the things.

442
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:56,109
She will look after the, all the filth, all
the anger, all the temper, all the everything

443
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:58,290
that’s going on in this world.

444
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:06,470
She will absorb all that, but what you have
to do is to just enjoy everything that is

445
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,530
pure.

446
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,450
Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond
your mind.

447
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:14,109
With your mind you can never enjoy.

448
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:16,680
It’s like a big load.

449
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,040
It will not act, it will not help.

450
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:27,950
Enjoyment comes when you are in complete silence,
in a rippleless lake.

451
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:34,730
The reflection of all the joy that is created
on the shores of that lake are completely

452
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:37,280
reflected, they are not deflected.

453
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,450
If there were ripples it would have been a
different image altogether and would have

454
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:49,320
been something nowhere near the image of reality.

455
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:57,770
So one must have a mind which is kept lower
than reality.

456
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:04,540
In the reality actually it is nothing but
peace and joy.

457
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:12,280
Now a mother’s desire is always that children
should have nothing but peace and joy, no

458
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:17,570
sufferings, no starvation, no ordeals, nothing.

459
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:20,910
They must just enjoy.

460
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:22,960
Now those days are gone.

461
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:35,119
But even to enjoy this, even to live in that
complete peaceful state you have to be non-reflecting.

462
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:49,000
Now you watch yourself, you’ll be amazed
how much reflecting you are.

463
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,250
When Devi is doing all the job for you.

464
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:59,950
When Paramchaitanya, I don’t know how many
things It is doing, is trying to fill up the

465
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:03,649
whole atmosphere with It’s activity.

466
00:53:03,649 --> 00:53:09,120
What is your activity, should be to stop your
mental activity.

467
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:14,290
You’ll be amazed in that state only, you
will grow.

468
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:19,590
With that growth only you will become like
this scientist.

469
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:28,210
How the contradiction now is that when you
have your depth you can project your depth,

470
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,050
not your mind.

471
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:34,830
Sometimes when I say “project,” people
think it is a projection of the mind.

472
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:41,070
No. you have to project that depth, that reality
that is within you.

473
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:46,770
For that you don’t have to think, you don’t
have to plan, it will just work.

474
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:50,240
But you’ll be the instrument for that projection.

475
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,230
It is nothing subtle.

476
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,500
It is very simple to understand.

477
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,680
Like I’m talking on this instrument, all
right?

478
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:11,680
Now if this instrument is absolutely all right,
there’s no problem in it, it will be peaceful.

479
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:21,760
But if this is full of ideas and thoughts
like our brain is, whatever I’m saying will

480
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,510
not be the same that will be broadcasted.

481
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:33,960
In the same way, when our mind is full of
turmoil and arguments and what you can say,

482
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:42,599
comments, or we can also say the reflection,
then what happens is that this mind gets into

483
00:54:42,599 --> 00:55:01,080
like a whirlpool of disturbances and it cannot
project itself fully because it is disturbed.

484
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,070
It is not a normal thing.

485
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:07,480
So now you’ll understand there is no contradiction.

486
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,159
You can only project yourself when you are
absolutely peaceful.

487
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:16,140
And this is what we have to learn.

488
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:25,990
This is Navaratri’s great days are here
and that you should know that it starts, actually,

489
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:33,850
in the western world from the 21st, in the
equinox, after the equinox, in September.

490
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:41,620
There are two Navaratri’s we have, you see,
one starts now and one starts after the second

491
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,620
equinox.

492
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:50,430
Now in this equinox, Mother Mary’s birthday
is there, equinox.

493
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,670
And that’s why people celebrate Her birthday.

494
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:57,599
They don’t know why She was born on equinox.

495
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,430
For the balance.

496
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:09,560
Then, you see, because nothing was explained
about the lives of these great incarnations,

497
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,530
people use them the way they like.

498
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:19,369
Because they have seen miracles with them,
so they do not try to understand why this

499
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:25,530
equinox is there and why this is celebrated.

500
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:32,200
Now I was told in Iran, this is the time they
have the new year.

501
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:39,400
That means the Muslims observe this as a new
year, so when Navaratri starts is the new

502
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,400
year.

503
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:48,349
That means it’s the twelfth month for them
and so many things are suggestive of that,

504
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:50,330
that why should it be twelve months.

505
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:53,190
Why should the Goddess be born at twelve o’clock.

506
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:58,700
All this has a special meaning and which you
can find out.

507
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:04,119
But only possible when you are not reflecting.

508
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:10,720
This is what is the state in which you are
really in connection with the all-pervading

509
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,820
Power.

510
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:17,879
Otherwise you are not there, you are not one
with that state.

511
00:57:17,879 --> 00:57:23,610
To be one with that state you have to be absolutely
silent within yourself.

512
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:28,159
For the Goddess, She is silent.

513
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:33,839
There’s a fight on, She’s silent, because
She’s so confident.

514
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,940
She knows about Her powers.

515
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:43,720
She knows Maheshasura or any asura cannot
trouble Her, cannot touch Her.

516
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,480
She knows what are their powers are and She
knows all Her powers.

517
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,800
So She doesn’t have to be disturbed by anything.

518
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:59,599
She’s not disturbed because She’s really
the personification of this peace state, where

519
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:02,270
She’s so powerful.

520
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,399
She doesn’t have to know about Her powers.

521
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:12,290
She doesn’t have to ask the powers to exert,
they just work, automatically.

522
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:20,030
This is the state in which, you will be amazed,
so many things happen, unknowingly, without

523
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,180
your doing anything.

524
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:28,670
And that is what we call as coincidences,
but actually it is not coincidence.

525
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:40,780
It is the state in which we are in a thoughtless
awareness, and then the Paramachaitanya is

526
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,990
related to us.

527
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:43,990
Absolutely related.

528
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,030
We are there.

529
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:48,370
And that works out everything for us.

530
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:54,950
So in Sahaja Yoga, this time, as you know
about the Goddess, what She has done, so much

531
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,900
work for years together.

532
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:05,490
Now you all have become realized souls and
you must understand that complete confidence

533
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:14,250
in yourself, complete understanding about
yourself, never to have any fear, never to

534
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:20,200
have any thoughts which can bombard your mind.

535
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,560
At that state you are the most powerful person.

536
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:33,470
I hope, for this Navaratri, you will realize
what work the Goddess has done for you, how

537
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:41,980
much She's worked hard, how much She's fought,
She’s been fighting with these horrible

538
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,991
devils and rakshasas.

539
00:59:44,991 --> 00:59:56,109
And, sometimes I feel now, these devils are
within us, they're not outside, and that comes

540
00:59:56,109 --> 01:00:02,579
to us because we reflect too much on things.

541
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:08,710
If you talk to any one of the western people
you're amazed, as if all the media they have

542
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,120
on their heads.

543
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:15,889
They know about each and every person, what
he did, what was this, what was that.

544
01:00:15,889 --> 01:00:19,760
But he's not worried.

545
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:27,339
He doesn't think how he can improve it, how
you can work it out.

546
01:00:27,339 --> 01:00:36,290
At this state of thoughtless awareness you
encompass the whole universe, and at that

547
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:42,270
state, this power works wherever the problem
may be.

548
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:50,900
So we have to understand our value, that we
have this power within ourself, and this is

549
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:57,210
to be respected and to give credit to the
Goddess because She's done so much work for

550
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:05,250
us that She should not feel that it's now
they got Realization just for a song and they

551
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:09,899
are not bothered, they don't know how to develop
it.

552
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:21,510
She will not be in any way hurt but Her work,
what She has done, we have to see, we have

553
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:31,980
to understand and we have to have a feeling
that somehow, as we now have got enlightenment,

554
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:39,750
we should try to be people as complete instruments
of that power.

555
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:46,470
That's only possible when you don't have your
own ideas, your own interference.

556
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:55,359
Complete instrument, just like as I said,
this instrument has to be perfectly all right,

557
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:57,460
otherwise it cannot work.

558
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,889
Thank you very much.

559
01:01:59,889 --> 01:02:02,170
May God bless you!
