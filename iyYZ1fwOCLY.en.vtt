00:17.297 --> 00:22.972
[Informally, before the puja speech
to some persons]

00:23.173 --> 00:26.706
Shri Mataji: Just help him, one person
can’t do it, somebody else.

00:26.907 --> 00:30.185
Marcus, Nick, anyone, just help him out,

00:30.386 --> 00:32.815
it’s too much for one person, just
help him, please.

01:06.318 --> 01:08.875
What’s there?

01:09.076 --> 01:12.825
Alan, go and tell Bai to bring
My handkerchief from My...

01:13.025 --> 01:14.819
I’ve got My pur- No, no, it’s all right,
it’s here,

01:15.025 --> 01:20.036
with My purse, have you brought it?
Yes, it’s here. Don’t worry, don’t worry!

01:21.315 --> 01:24.461
Man: Here’s Your purse, Mother.

01:58.447 --> 02:02.571
Shri Mataji: Have the Americans come, those
who have done the Puja, have they come?

02:02.819 --> 02:05.338
Sahaja yogi: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji:
Are they here? Man: Yes.

02:05.539 --> 02:09.083
Shri Mataji: Oh, they are here.
Then it’s all right.

02:11.231 --> 02:17.461
And, in these new centers,

02:17.662 --> 02:20.596
have you started with Puja anywhere?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.

02:20.797 --> 02:23.643
Shri Mataji: No, yours is all right,
I’m asking about England.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.406
Warren: Any centres in Britain? Where
there are new people.

02:25.606 --> 02:28.423
Shri Mataji: Cheltenham, for example.
Where is Alan? Ask him.

02:28.625 --> 02:31.426
Warren: He’s just gone out for a moment.
Any centers in Britain,

02:31.627 --> 02:34.698
any new people here, right now?

02:34.899 --> 02:38.049
Shri Mataji: If do you have introduced
them to puja I don’t mind,

02:38.250 --> 02:43.556
but if they have never been introduced
to puja, then you have to be careful.

02:44.953 --> 02:48.064
From their good point of view.

02:49.911 --> 02:53.050
I’m sorry I had to say this,

02:53.251 --> 02:55.812
because yesterday the load was too much,
you know I couldn’t speak even,

02:56.013 --> 03:03.305
and lifting the Kundalini was like raising
hundred donkeys on your head,

03:03.506 --> 03:06.202
it was too much.

03:06.432 --> 03:13.374
And all these half-baked people are such
that they are like dog-in-the-manger,

03:13.575 --> 03:16.344
they won’t have it and they won’t allow
others to have it.

03:16.545 --> 03:20.376
They’ll argue before the program,
before the meeting starts,

03:20.577 --> 03:24.315
before the puja starts, specially.

03:24.516 --> 03:28.130
Because they don’t want you to enjoy
the fruits of the puja;

03:28.331 --> 03:31.403
they’ll spoil your attention,

03:33.133 --> 03:37.170
they’ll argue, discuss.
[Aside: “Please sit down.”]

03:42.162 --> 03:44.962
What is there to argue in Sahaj Yoga?
You have to take, that’s the point is,

03:45.163 --> 03:48.687
you have to take, there’s nothing
to argue.

03:49.050 --> 03:52.274
How much you take is the point.

03:56.806 --> 04:04.810
And the worst part is that they don’t want
to grow and they want to pull you down.

04:05.011 --> 04:09.688
So, unless and until they are introduced
to the idea of puja beforehand -

04:09.889 --> 04:12.484
then they start understanding the worth
of puja, otherwise they do not,

04:12.685 --> 04:16.251
how will they understand? You see,
it’s beyond them.

04:17.795 --> 04:24.886
So, you should not make them attend
any puja, minimum,

04:25.087 --> 04:29.785
and also seminars I would say. Because
seminars are meant for people

04:29.986 --> 04:35.509
who are intensively in Sahaj Yoga,
to intensify their awareness.

04:35.710 --> 04:38.254
Not for people who are half-baked,
who are Doubting Thomases,

04:38.455 --> 04:41.027
all this kind of people are absolutely
useless,

04:41.228 --> 04:44.168
you should never bring them
to a seminar.

04:44.369 --> 04:47.701
Whether it’s your son, father, brother,
mother, sister, husband, wife,

04:47.902 --> 04:54.880
nothing doing. You shouldn’t bring
anybody who is not

04:57.774 --> 05:02.662
fully awakened Sahaja Yogi,

05:02.871 --> 05:08.319
because seminars are meant for very
intensive work-out.

05:10.431 --> 05:13.226
And what I find, always these people
will argue with Me,

05:13.427 --> 05:16.409
they are the first to question, they have
something to say

05:16.610 --> 05:20.443
they are the ones. Sahaja Yogis are keeping
quiet and receiving it.

05:20.644 --> 05:26.295
I don’t mind even that, but what happens
in the seminar, you have to receive more.

05:28.274 --> 05:33.689
And they do not receive, their attention
is outside, they are disturbing everyone.

05:33.890 --> 05:39.659
So, seminars are even, in a way, more
important than an ashram,

05:39.860 --> 05:45.173
because in ashram there’s no other problem
but to fight them out.

05:45.374 --> 05:50.374
But here, in a new place we go, we have
to fight out all surroundings,

05:50.575 --> 05:54.744
the place itself has to be cleansed,
everything has to be done.

05:54.945 --> 05:57.608
On top of that you have these horrible
people around you,

05:57.809 --> 06:00.239
whom you have to convince. If they are
not convinced, why are they here?

06:00.440 --> 06:03.331
Why did they spend so much money
to come down?

06:03.532 --> 06:09.206
Be sure, they have come here to disturb us.
I’m sorry we had to do that way.

06:09.407 --> 06:14.010
I wish people could be simple,
straightforward,

06:14.211 --> 06:21.489
uncomplicated, and sensitive, but
they are not.

06:23.160 --> 06:28.321
They are not sensitive people. They don’t
understand what are they up to.

06:28.631 --> 06:32.759
By that they destroy themselves, no doubt,
but they destroy part of you also,

06:32.959 --> 06:36.838
and also trouble Me. Yesterday it was
too heavy, you know that.

06:37.040 --> 06:40.538
Such a deep subject and it was too heavy
for Me.

06:40.738 --> 06:45.601
If they say they feel bad, all right, tell
them: “We are sorry, we can’t help you.”

06:48.614 --> 06:57.706
See, there are certain points where we have
to have our freedom

06:58.603 --> 07:05.916
to allow those who can come in. That’s
the point where we close the door.

07:07.286 --> 07:15.641
And there’s nothing wrong in it, because
you have to equip more to pull them out.

07:17.735 --> 07:21.803
It has been always our practice, since
long, there’s nothing new about it,

07:22.004 --> 07:27.256
everyone knows, not only in England,
or any other place, even in India:

07:27.462 --> 07:32.943
we never allowed anybody to come for
the Puja who was not a realized soul,

07:34.414 --> 07:37.050
and who was not a Sahaja Yogi, from
the very beginning.

07:37.251 --> 07:41.747
Wherever we tried that, we found it was
very difficult.

07:43.244 --> 07:45.712
So I hope there’s nobody sitting here
with a doubting mind.

07:45.913 --> 07:51.429
If somebody’s there he should with all
sincerity leave the hall

07:51.630 --> 07:55.555
and leave us alone, for the ascent.

07:57.931 --> 08:05.875
Anybody who has doubts should be kind
and generous about it.

08:06.657 --> 08:11.292
It’s a very serious work we are doing.
It’s not of making money

08:11.493 --> 08:16.746
or of throwing an enterprise or building
a house or something like that.

08:16.947 --> 08:22.555
It’s not even just making creations
of worlds,

08:22.756 --> 08:27.023
it’s much more than that, it’s a very
serious work we are doing

08:27.180 --> 08:32.531
and we don’t want anybody to cut
our attention.

08:33.163 --> 08:36.273
Even some of the Sahaja Yogis I know,
are half-baked.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.497
They must be corrected, all right, doesn’t
matter, but they have been exposed to pujas,

08:39.698 --> 08:42.032
so it will do them good, not bad.

08:42.233 --> 08:47.831
But some people are just anti-God, and they
have allergies for God.

08:48.032 --> 08:54.461
Any work you’d start doing in the name
of God, they are so allergic, they react.

08:57.061 --> 09:02.564
These are anti-God allergies,

09:03.648 --> 09:06.663
and they express themselves by different,
funny methods.

09:06.864 --> 09:13.802
Now, all the Sahaja Yogis must know this,
then you will not go too far with them.

09:14.003 --> 09:17.943
You will - you should discover this
in anyone this allergy existing.

09:18.123 --> 09:21.996
You should say: “Sorry, we have nothing
to do with you”.

09:29.084 --> 09:36.057
So that is for the people who have to have
the privilege of this worship.

09:36.258 --> 09:40.030
Today is specially a great privilege

09:41.573 --> 09:46.544
because it was not so planned,

09:46.745 --> 09:53.370
but it worked out, just worked out.

09:55.453 --> 10:02.777
Yesterday we did lots of cleansing. Now,
today tell your mind to rest for a while.

10:04.218 --> 10:10.116
Tell your thoughts to stop for a while,
and receive, receive more of it.

10:10.317 --> 10:15.554
Everybody has benefited by this reception
but you have to receive more.

10:15.755 --> 10:19.406
There’s a capacity within you to receive.

10:24.857 --> 10:31.410
Puja, as I have told you many-a-times,
is not for My benefit, by any chance,

10:31.611 --> 10:36.321
take it from Me. I’m much better off
without it.

10:36.536 --> 10:41.074
Because when the enthusiastic deities start
emitting vibrations

10:41.275 --> 10:46.952
with your asking - because you are saints,
you see, just they are over-enthusiastic.

10:47.153 --> 10:50.516
And they are sitting there, busy-bodies,
you know,

10:50.717 --> 10:54.161
they are sitting quietly waiting for
a chance, you see, to emit vibrations,

10:54.362 --> 10:58.463
to save you, you see they want to just
rush.

10:58.797 --> 11:03.958
They emit so much that they lose –
“Just wait, just wait”.

11:04.159 --> 11:10.286
They want to save you, they want to give
you, they’re so anxious,

11:10.612 --> 11:16.595
in their anxiety you see - I like it,
to see the way they are anxious.

11:17.733 --> 11:22.393
But you don’t suck it, and I have a problem
there.

11:23.449 --> 11:26.594
Once they have given they don’t want
to take it back.

11:26.795 --> 11:31.213
You don’t suck it, so it has to go to the
atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere.

11:31.414 --> 11:34.669
Is directed towards you and you don’t take
it; so where does it go?

11:34.870 --> 11:39.960
It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.

11:40.214 --> 11:44.226
So, sucking should be more. Sucking
should be more.

11:44.427 --> 11:49.181
And just before the Puja you should say:
“Mother, make me such

11:49.382 --> 11:54.043
that I suck more of the Divine”.

11:54.244 --> 12:00.338
Just pray that, with sincerity from your
heart, just say that.

12:10.619 --> 12:14.545
There’s another beautiful gesture I have
seen, in Uzbekistan, it’s very good.

12:14.746 --> 12:19.349
They put both the hands on their heart
like this, and just press it,

12:19.537 --> 12:24.602
bending their head, asking. See, it creates
a vacuum.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.693
That’s how they bow.

12:34.753 --> 12:37.131
It’s beautiful!

12:48.609 --> 12:51.314
That’s very nice today.

12:53.907 --> 12:57.867
So, let the children come here.

12:58.068 --> 13:03.532
[Translation: “Come, sister has come,
Sister has come”].

13:13.937 --> 13:18.955
Now, sit there, all of you sit down, all
right? Sit down now, sit down, sit down.

13:19.219 --> 13:22.674
Now, come along, Matthews is also coming,
sit down there,

13:22.875 --> 13:26.528
sit down, come along, let’s see, sit down.
Now all the children are very sweet,

13:26.776 --> 13:29.982
and are going to sit down. Come along,
sit down, sit down, nicely.

13:30.205 --> 13:32.216
[Translation: “Where is sister?
Where is sister?”

13:32.417 --> 13:36.488
Younger granddaughter: Upstairs.
Shri Mataji: Upstairs! Not yet come?]

13:40.036 --> 13:44.678
All right, now, you should give Me
the flowers now,

13:44.879 --> 13:47.606
so would be better for you to have
vibrations, thank you.

13:47.807 --> 13:53.619
Thank you very much, thank you very much.
Poor Rishi has none.

13:53.820 --> 13:59.394
Now, you give Me these, to Me, give Me now.
Give Me. Give Me, to Mother.

13:59.595 --> 14:02.303
All right, give that also.
Child [indistinctly]: But you have the one.

14:02.512 --> 14:06.354
Shri Mataji: Also give. So thank you,

14:07.633 --> 14:10.477
thank you, thank you very much.

14:12.617 --> 14:15.969
[She hands the flowers to a lady aside:
“All right, just take this”]

14:16.436 --> 14:19.750
All right, so now what should we do,
Pujari is this.

14:19.951 --> 14:26.295
Just put a tikka to him. Put to everyone,
not to the Pujari.

14:27.656 --> 14:30.038
Pujari: Got it.

14:30.239 --> 14:36.964
Shri Mataji: All right. All right. That’s
kajal? No, don’t put kajal.

14:37.165 --> 14:40.365
He’ll be like Bhairava!

14:41.171 --> 14:45.402
Good. May God bless you.

14:53.024 --> 14:55.659
All right. Now, the children should sit
like this, all right?

14:55.860 --> 14:58.678
On the side, for Ganesha Puja,
like this, straight.

14:58.879 --> 15:00.422
So everybody can take photograph also,

15:00.623 --> 15:05.884
sit like this, all right? Ah. They have
to take photographs. Yes, good, good.

15:06.085 --> 15:09.888
Oh, now sit here. Sit, sit down, all right.

15:10.089 --> 15:15.927
Good, it’s very good. But you have
to take out shoes!

15:16.128 --> 15:19.208
See, cannot have shoes here, take out
shoes.

15:19.409 --> 15:22.521
Take out shoes, everybody’s taken out
shoes, take out, take out -

15:22.722 --> 15:25.618
take out shoes. Yeah.

15:39.518 --> 15:42.134
So come along.

15:51.769 --> 15:54.246
Sit like this, on the sides.

15:54.462 --> 15:59.622
[A lato: (Hindi) Shuddhi mein Ganesha Puja?]
Pujari (in hindi): Ha, Shri Ganesha Puja.

15:59.846 --> 16:03.922
Pujari: To begin with, we will
do first the invocation of the puja,

16:04.123 --> 16:06.974
then the puja to Lord Ganesha.

16:07.175 --> 16:14.177
And this would be followed by the puja to
the Adi Shakti, Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi.

16:15.976 --> 16:21.745
In the Devi Bhagavat Purana it is written
that the puja to the Adi Shakti

16:21.954 --> 16:26.322
is the greatest puja that can be done
by any being.

16:26.523 --> 16:29.958
Shri Mataji: That’s why you are privileged.

16:33.449 --> 16:37.247
Pujari: Even the Gods don’t do it.
Shri Mataji: None of them.

16:37.461 --> 16:40.018
They just touch My feet.

16:40.219 --> 16:43.912
None of them did Puja to Me. Believe Me.

16:44.113 --> 16:47.899
[Softly, to a little girl - ed] Very good.
All right, sit down.

16:49.328 --> 16:55.703
Gli yogi: Om Twameva Sakshat,

Ganesha mantra

17:18.021 --> 17:21.950
while a few begin the Mahamantra - ed]

17:22.151 --> 17:25.353
Shri Mataji: One person should say,
then you can repeat, that’s better.

17:25.554 --> 17:31.122
What about Aradhna, where is she? She has
not come? Child: She is upstairs.

17:33.576 --> 17:36.607
Pujari: We’ll start again. First Lord
Ganesha,

17:36.808 --> 17:39.640
then Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,
Mahakali.

17:39.873 --> 17:43.625
Then Lord Kalki and then Lord Kalki
and Sahastrara Swamini.

17:43.826 --> 17:45.866
Yogi: Three times Shri Ganesha?
Pujari: Hm?

17:46.067 --> 17:49.396

Pujari: Each once, I mean.

Om Shri Keshavaya Namah,

19:38.904 --> 19:44.532
Om Shri Narayanaya Namah,
Om Shri Madhavaya Namah,

19:44.733 --> 19:50.316
Om Shri Govindaya Namah,
Om Shri Vishnuve Namah,

19:50.517 --> 19:55.671
Om (Shri) Madhusudanaya Namah,
Om Shri Trivikramaya Namah,

19:55.879 --> 20:01.105
Om Shri Vamanaya Namah,
Om Shri Shridharaya Namah,

20:01.306 --> 20:06.957
Om Shri Hrishikeshaya Namah,
Om Shri Sankarshanaya Namah,

20:07.158 --> 20:12.845
Om Shri Vasudevaya Namah,
Om Shri Pradyumnaya Namah,

20:13.046 --> 20:18.698
Om Shri Aniruddhaya Namah,
Om Shri Purushottamaya Namah,

20:18.899 --> 20:24.260
Om Shri Aghokshajaya Namah,
Om Shri Narasimhaya Namah,

20:24.461 --> 20:29.582
Om Shri Achyutaya Namah,
Om Shri Janardanaya Namah,

20:29.783 --> 20:35.013
Om Shri Padmanabhaya Namah,
Om Shri Damodaraya Namah,

20:35.214 --> 20:40.555
Om Shri Upendraya Namah,
Om Shri Haraye Namah,

20:40.756 --> 20:43.366
Om Shri Krishnaye Namah.

20:43.567 --> 20:46.781
Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti
Bhagavati Mataji

20:46.982 --> 20:49.960
Shri Nirmala Devyai
Namoh Namah.

20:50.168 --> 20:57.291
Shri Mataji: Why these twenty-one names
are taken before every puja,

20:57.492 --> 21:00.648
even before the today renovation of it?

21:00.849 --> 21:05.693
First you have to worship Shri Ganesha.

21:05.894 --> 21:09.614
But even before worshipping why these
names are taken,

21:09.815 --> 21:13.233
is important to understand, everything
has a why.

21:13.434 --> 21:23.521
Because these are the twenty-one channels
within your Sushumna,

21:23.722 --> 21:26.646
twenty-one channels, we should say, in this

21:26.847 --> 21:31.879
complete Ida, Pingala and Sushumna Nadi.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.501
So to raise you,

21:40.526 --> 21:48.067
absolutely to give you the ascent, twenty-
one channels in Ida, Pingala, Sushumna.

21:48.300 --> 21:52.002
So one would say seven channels
in the Sushumna Nadi.

21:52.203 --> 22:01.006
But these seven channels are divided
multiplied by seven into three.

22:01.207 --> 22:06.551
So every channel has got twenty-one
(inner? Unclear) channels.

22:10.321 --> 22:16.312
So Sushumna Nadi has got also twenty-one
channels.

22:17.401 --> 22:19.889
Left-hand side Nadis are as you know that –

22:20.090 --> 22:23.906
perhaps you know, I don’t know if you know
the names or not.

22:24.154 --> 22:27.942
And the right hand side also, like Gayatri,

22:28.143 --> 22:32.707
Parvati and all these are on the righ
hand side.

22:32.908 --> 22:40.066
And the left ones are called as Chamundi,

22:40.267 --> 22:45.499
and all these left-sided things, there are
seven of them.

22:46.683 --> 22:55.781
Now, the central path has got twenty-one
channels and has got twenty-one powers.

22:55.982 --> 23:00.653
And their deities are named

23:02.195 --> 23:06.875
according to the twenty-one aspects
of Shri Vishnu.

23:07.076 --> 23:12.811
And that’s why these twenty-one aspects
are first said,

23:13.012 --> 23:16.431
so that within you all these twenty-one
channels are awakened.

23:16.632 --> 23:19.781
Within you, first of all.

23:19.982 --> 23:27.042
Puja is a double thing, that a cup has
to be made

23:27.243 --> 23:32.287
and then this source has to be opened out.

23:32.488 --> 23:39.848
So you are the cup. The Sushumna is the
channel you have by which you suck in.

23:40.049 --> 23:44.598
So to open the Sushumna these twenty-one
names are said.

23:45.902 --> 23:49.770
Now, why first Shri Ganesha?

23:49.971 --> 23:56.711
Because Shri Ganesha is the beginning
of the desire. And the end of the desire.

23:56.912 --> 23:59.978
You start with Ganesha and end up
with Ganesha.

24:00.179 --> 24:02.345
And that’s why Shri Ganesha is worshipped.

24:02.546 --> 24:06.150
Is the other way round now, the source.

24:06.421 --> 24:10.702
When you direct your attention to
the source you worship it,

24:10.903 --> 24:19.461
and when you want to incite or open out
your own being, then you chant it.

24:21.410 --> 24:25.254
This is the difference between worship
and a mantra.

24:25.455 --> 24:30.133
If you just say mantra, you open
yourself up.

24:30.334 --> 24:37.193
But when you worship and chant,
then you tap the source.

24:37.997 --> 24:39.815
I don’t know if I’ve said this before
or not.

24:40.016 --> 24:42.728
Yogi: No, no, no.
Shri Mataji: No? All right.

24:42.929 --> 24:45.416
That’s how you understand the puja part.

24:45.617 --> 24:53.258
Now, those who are newcomers, their cup
is completely useless.

24:53.459 --> 24:56.739
And when you excite the deities, they get
busy opening their cups,

24:56.940 --> 24:59.378
everybody’s cups also. So it’s a double
work.

24:59.579 --> 25:03.388
But if your cup is ready, it’s very easy
to fill in.

25:06.747 --> 25:08.974
So now these twenty-one names I think
you should take again

25:09.175 --> 25:12.547
with the understanding, is better.
All right.

25:15.365 --> 25:21.964
Pujari: Om Shri Keshavaya Namah,
Om Shri Narayanaya Namah,

25:22.165 --> 25:28.682
Om Shri Madhavaya Namah,
Om Shri Govindaya Namah,

25:28.883 --> 25:34.709

Om Shri Trivikramaya Namah,
Om Shri Vamanaya Namah,

Om Shri Shridharaya Namah,
Om Shri Hrishikeshaya Namah,

25:47.269 --> 25:53.585
Om Shri Sankarshanaya Namah,
Om Shri Vasudevaya Namah,

25:53.786 --> 25:59.164
Om Shri Pradyumnaya Namah,
Om Shri Aniruddhaya Namah,

25:59.365 --> 26:04.753
Om Shri Purushottamaya Namah,
Om Shri Aghokshajaya Namah,

26:04.954 --> 26:09.661
Om Shri Narasimhaya Namah,
Om Shri Achyutaya Namah,

26:09.862 --> 26:14.708
Om Shri Janardanaya Namah,
Om Shri Padmanabhaya Namah,

26:14.909 --> 26:19.421
Om Shri Damodaraya Namah,
Om Shri Upendraya Namah,

26:19.622 --> 26:24.028
Om Shri Haraye Namah,
Om Shri Krishnaye Namah.

26:24.229 --> 26:27.522
Pujari e gli yogi: Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti
Bhagavati Mataji

26:27.723 --> 26:32.693
Shri Nirmala Devyai
Namoh Namah.

26:32.899 --> 26:35.304
Shri Mataji: Now.

26:35.915 --> 26:38.662
Pujari: Now we have the mantra
for pranayama.

26:38.863 --> 26:41.265
Shri Mataji: This is the Gayatri,
the right side.

26:41.466 --> 26:46.904
Is the right side, and these are all
the seven centers on physical level.

26:47.810 --> 26:50.824
Pujari: Pranayama. Shri Mataji: Pranayama
is the same thing. Is for –

26:51.025 --> 26:55.268
Prana is right side. It’s physical side.
You are opening the right side.

26:55.469 --> 26:58.314
You see, this Gayatri mantra you say.
Bhur Bhuva Swaha and all these things.

26:58.515 --> 27:01.950
Now, Bhu is Pruthvi, Bhuva is Antariksha,

27:02.151 --> 27:05.345
you see, like that, it’s all the centers
[Pujari: “Swaha”],

27:05.546 --> 27:10.279
the essence of the centers, you see?
Now, Antariksha –

27:10.480 --> 27:13.587
you’ll be surprised that you are the essence
of all the Antariksha,

27:13.788 --> 27:17.567
your centers are. Yes.

27:21.833 --> 27:25.028
Pujari [recites Pranayama prayer]:
“Pranavasya Parabrahma rishi

27:25.228 --> 27:33.836
Paramatma Devata, Devi Gayatri chandah.
Pranayame viniyogah.”

27:50.501 --> 27:52.993
Shri Mataji: You do it only with the one
nose? Yogi: Both noses. (Not audible)

27:53.194 --> 27:56.881
Shri Mataji: Both the noses. Prana:
Prana is right side.

27:57.082 --> 27:59.905
Prana shakti is right side, Mana shakti
is left side.

28:00.106 --> 28:04.003
So Prana shakti you are exciting

28:04.854 --> 28:09.861
because this prana is the one which spreads
in the body,

28:10.062 --> 28:15.252
gives you the balance, which takes in
and gives out.

28:17.595 --> 28:20.259
Pujari: Now we have the Gayatri mantra.

28:20.460 --> 28:24.017
Aum bhū, Om bhuvah,

More insistence on Lakshmi Narayan,

01:04:40.884 --> 01:04:43.584
Now what else? Pujari: Mataji
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah

01:04:43.785 --> 01:04:47.366
Bhupam Samarpayami
Deepam darshayami.

01:04:47.567 --> 01:04:52.085
(Mantras continue)

01:04:52.966 --> 01:04:58.524
Shri Mataji: Now just put that one, yes.
Do like this, Gavin.

01:05:06.146 --> 01:05:07.812
Yes. All right.

01:05:08.013 --> 01:05:11.620
Pujari: Now to the five forms of Pranayami.

01:05:11.821 --> 01:05:16.156
Shri Mataji (to Gavin): Now the karpura
(camphor) little bit.

01:05:21.019 --> 01:05:23.336
Rub it up.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.801
Now the offering whatever I have to eat –

01:05:33.002 --> 01:05:37.884
something you have…(indistinct words)
sweet or chana will do.

01:05:39.454 --> 01:05:43.952
Chana, chana is absolutely best, I love
chana.

01:05:54.095 --> 01:05:58.335
This is Naivedhyam, you see, just
(indistinct).

01:06:11.454 --> 01:06:17.965
Only the Brahmins eat everything, the Gods
don’t eat anything.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:40.235
That’s all right.

01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:46.810
Pujari: Om Shri Pranaya swaha.
Shri Mataji: Chana.

01:06:47.011 --> 01:06:50.808

Om Shri Brahmané swaha.
Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji

(mantras follow).

01:07:29.577 --> 01:07:32.347

(Pujari starts recitation of mantras)

01:07:44.886 --> 01:07:49.070
This is actually when You are in a statue.

01:07:53.324 --> 01:07:57.469
SYou can only do all this when You are
in a statue.

01:07:58.703 --> 01:08:02.713

Shri Mataji: Vastra. [Pujari aside:
“You got some sari?”] Sari…(hindi).

01:08:19.733 --> 01:08:22.986
What sari? What’s that?

01:08:25.239 --> 01:08:27.864
No, no, no. Sari’s out of question.

01:08:28.065 --> 01:08:30.331
Pujari: Which vastran, then?

01:08:30.532 --> 01:08:34.980
Shri Mataji: Which one they opened within
now - anything.

01:08:35.181 --> 01:08:42.595
No, now - any vastran you can use that
– do... [Yogi softly: “We could try”]

01:09:13.545 --> 01:09:20.541
Olympia…

01:09:34.225 --> 01:09:36.748
Good.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi]

01:15:52.719 --> 01:15:57.808
Pujari: Shall we do the Sahastranama (…) -
Lalita Sahastranama?

01:15:58.026 --> 01:16:01.440
Shri Mataji: [Hindi conversation with
pujari.

01:16:05.041 --> 01:16:11.828
“Puja… Havan… Havana…

01:16:32.307 --> 01:16:36.498
Devi Mahatmya…”. Pujari:
“Devi Mahatmyam”]

01:16:47.068 --> 01:16:53.940
No, the - when Mahishasura was killed,
you see, this one was read.

01:16:54.141 --> 01:17:00.015
So the beginning of it - and then say it,
read it in English, would be better.

01:17:31.291 --> 01:17:35.705
[Pujari starts reading in Sanskrit]

01:17:56.142 --> 01:17:59.799
If you read it in English would be better.
Pujari: Read it in English.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.994
Shri Mataji: Hm, then whatever is
in English is the story.

01:18:03.195 --> 01:18:05.122
It’s better that they understand.

01:18:05.323 --> 01:18:09.803
(Hindi) All right, stand up and read it.

01:18:10.091 --> 01:18:13.728
Pujari: This is the great hymn to the
Goddess when She had killed Mahishasura,

01:18:13.936 --> 01:18:18.019
whom as we all know is back again
in Bangalore.

01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:22.009
“To that Ambika who is worthy of worship
by all the devas and sages,

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:24.290
and who pervades this world by Her power,

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:26.519
and who is the embodiment of the entire
power

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:30.724
of all the hosts of Devas, we bow
in devotion.

01:18:30.925 --> 01:18:33.362
May She grant us auspicious things.

01:18:33.563 --> 01:18:36.125
May Chandika whose incomparable greatness
and power,

01:18:36.326 --> 01:18:40.279
Bhagavan Vishnu, Brahma and Hara
are unable to describe,

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.896
bestow Her mind on protecting the entire
world,

01:18:43.097 --> 01:18:45.945
and on destroying the fear of evil.

01:18:46.146 --> 01:18:50.423
Oh Devi, we bow before You. Who are
Yourself good fortune

01:18:50.624 --> 01:18:55.091
in the dwellings of the virtuous, and
ill-fortune in those of the vicious,

01:18:55.292 --> 01:18:59.255
intelligence in the hearts of the learned,
faith in the hearts of the good,

01:18:59.456 --> 01:19:02.074
and modesty in the hearts of the high-born.

01:19:02.275 --> 01:19:06.085
May You protect the Universe!

01:19:06.286 --> 01:19:09.926
Oh Devi, how can we describe Your
inconceivable form,

01:19:10.127 --> 01:19:14.374
or Your abundant, surpassing valour that
destroys the asuras,

01:19:14.575 --> 01:19:16.790
or Your wonderful feats displayed
in battles

01:19:16.991 --> 01:19:20.061
amongst all the hosts of Gods, asuras
and others?

01:19:20.262 --> 01:19:24.308
You are the origin of all the three worlds,
though You are possessed of the three gunas,

01:19:24.509 --> 01:19:28.415
You are not known to have any of their
attendant qualities.

01:19:28.616 --> 01:19:31.865
You are incomprehensible even to Vishnu,
Shiva and others.

01:19:32.066 --> 01:19:34.940
You are the resort of all. The entire
world is composed

01:19:35.141 --> 01:19:37.485
of an infinitesimal portion of Yourself.

01:19:37.686 --> 01:19:42.431
You are verily the Supreme Primordial
Prakruti. Untransformed.

01:19:42.632 --> 01:19:45.269
Oh Devi, You are swaha, at whose utterance

01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:49.468
the whole assemblage of Gods obtain
satisfaction in all the sacrifices.

01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:52.465
You are the swadha…”
Shri Mataji: Same.

01:19:52.666 --> 01:19:57.044
Now, these are the mantras of the swaha:
Bhuh is pruthvi, is Ganesha Tattwa.

01:19:57.245 --> 01:20:00.374
Then you said swah.
Pujari: Yes. Om Bhuh Bhuvah Swah.

01:20:00.575 --> 01:20:04.855
Shri Mataji: Swah is the satisfaction.

01:20:06.952 --> 01:20:11.478
Bhuvah is the Antariksha, the whole
universe.

01:20:12.258 --> 01:20:14.167
Pujari: You are the swadha which gives
satisfaction to the manes…

01:20:14.368 --> 01:20:17.811
Shri Mataji: Swa-dha: swa is your self,

01:20:18.012 --> 01:20:22.063
dha means you have sustained yourself
with your Self.

01:20:22.264 --> 01:20:26.391
Swadha is the quality of the Nabhi chakra.

01:20:26.592 --> 01:20:30.229
Pujari: “Therefore you are chanted
by people.

01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:33.758
Oh Devi, You are Bhagavati, the Supreme
Vidya,

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:38.675
which is the cause of liberation and great
inconceivable penances.

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:43.395
You are the Supreme Knowledge, are
cultivated by sages who desire liberation,

01:20:43.596 --> 01:20:46.450
whose senses are well restrained and who
are devoted to reality

01:20:46.651 --> 01:20:49.912
and have shed all the blemishes.

01:20:51.710 --> 01:20:55.928
You are the soul of Shabda-Brahma,
You are the repository of the very pure…”

01:20:56.129 --> 01:20:59.823
Shri Mataji: Logos, logos you call? -
Shabda-Brahma. OM.

01:21:00.024 --> 01:21:02.866
“You are the Soul of that”. Pujari: OM.
All the Vedas come out of it (unclear).

01:21:03.067 --> 01:21:06.504
Shri Mataji: Everything is created out
of that OM. Shabda-Brahma is OM,

01:21:06.705 --> 01:21:10.611
and out of that all this Brahma – means
Brahmanda - is created, out of OM.

01:21:10.812 --> 01:21:14.383
Pujari: Shabda-Brahma.
Shri Mataji: All the scriptures.

01:21:15.434 --> 01:21:18.815
Pujari: “You are the repository of the very
pure Rik and Yajus hymns

01:21:19.016 --> 01:21:23.467
and of the Sama hymns, the recital of those
words is beautiful with the Udgitha.

01:21:23.668 --> 01:21:26.082
You are Bhagavati, embodying the three
Vedas.

01:21:26.283 --> 01:21:29.188
And You are the sustenance whereby
life is maintained.

01:21:29.389 --> 01:21:33.596
You are the Supreme Destroyer of the pain
of all the worlds.

01:21:33.797 --> 01:21:35.922
Oh Devi, You are the intellect, by which

01:21:36.123 --> 01:21:39.281
the essence of all scriptures is
comprehended. You are Durga,

01:21:39.482 --> 01:21:42.839
the boat that takes men across
the difficult ocean of worldly existence

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:45.894
devoid of attachments. You are Shri

01:21:46.095 --> 01:21:49.161
who has invariably taken Her abode
in the heart of Vishnu.

01:21:49.362 --> 01:21:53.438
You are indeed Gauri who has established
Herself with Shiva.

01:21:53.639 --> 01:21:56.864
Gently smiling, pure, resembling the full
moon’s orb,

01:21:57.065 --> 01:22:01.201
beautiful like the splendor of excellent
gold was Your face.

01:22:01.402 --> 01:22:08.724
Yet it was very strange that, being swayed
by anger, Mahishasura could not bear it.

01:22:10.949 --> 01:22:14.509
Far strange it is that after seeing Your
wrathful face, O Devi,

01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:17.949
terrible with its frowns and red in hue
like the rising moon,

01:22:18.150 --> 01:22:21.397
that Mahishasura did not immediately
give up his life!

01:22:21.597 --> 01:22:26.353
For, who can live after beholding
the enraged Destroyer?

01:22:26.555 --> 01:22:29.135
O Devi, be propitious. You are Supreme.

01:22:29.336 --> 01:22:32.413
If enraged, you forthwith destroy
the (asura) families

01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:35.695
for the welfare of the world. This was
known

01:22:35.896 --> 01:22:40.253
the very moment the extensive forces
of Mahishasura were brought to their end.

01:22:40.454 --> 01:22:44.895
You are always bounteous, to those fortunate
ones with whom You are well pleased,

01:22:45.096 --> 01:22:48.112
are indeed the object of esteem
in the country,

01:22:48.313 --> 01:22:52.832
theirs are riches, theirs are glories, and
their acts of righteousness perish not;

01:22:53.033 --> 01:22:57.582
they are indeed blessed and possessed
of devoted children, servants and wives.

01:22:57.761 --> 01:23:00.436
By Your Grace, O Devi, the blessed
individual does daily

01:23:00.636 --> 01:23:04.391
all righteous deeds with utmost care
and thereby attains to heaven.

01:23:04.593 --> 01:23:09.222
Are You not, therefore, O Devi, the bestower
of reward in all the three worlds?

01:23:09.423 --> 01:23:14.077
When called to mind in a difficult position,
You remove fear from every person.

01:23:14.278 --> 01:23:18.668
When called to mind by those in happiness,
You bestow a mind still more pious.

01:23:18.876 --> 01:23:22.046
Which Goddess but You, O Dispeller
of poverty, pain and fear,

01:23:22.247 --> 01:23:26.462
has an ever sympathetic heart for helping
everybody?

01:23:26.663 --> 01:23:29.672
The world attains happiness by the killing
of these foes;

01:23:29.873 --> 01:23:31.977
and though these asuras have committed
sins enough

01:23:32.178 --> 01:23:34.646
to keep them long in hell,

01:23:34.847 --> 01:23:38.879
let them reach heaven by meeting death
eventually at battle with You.

01:23:39.088 --> 01:23:44.211
Thinking thus, it is that You, O Devi,
certainly destroy our enemies.

01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:51.677
Don’t You reduce to ashes all asuras
by mere sight?

01:23:52.822 --> 01:23:55.805
But You direct Your weapons against them
so that even the wicked ones,

01:23:56.013 --> 01:23:58.851
purified by the missiles, may attain
higher worlds." Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:23:59.052 --> 01:24:00.650
Pujari: “Such is Your most kindly intention
towards them”.

01:24:00.851 --> 01:24:02.937
Shri Mataji: This one you read again.

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:06.664
Pujari: “Don’t You reduce to ashes all
asuras by mere sight?

01:24:06.865 --> 01:24:10.247
But You direct Your weapons against them
so that even the wicked ones,

01:24:10.432 --> 01:24:13.235
purified by the missiles, may attain
the higher worlds”.

01:24:13.436 --> 01:24:17.372
Shri Mataji: May attain. May.
Pujari: May.

01:24:17.915 --> 01:24:20.775
“That is Your most kindly intention
towards them.”

01:24:20.976 --> 01:24:23.603
Shri Mataji: Not promised.

01:24:27.057 --> 01:24:30.824
Pujari: “If the eyes of the asuras had not
been blinded by the terrible flashes

01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:33.257
of the mass of light issuing from Your
sword

01:24:33.458 --> 01:24:36.099
or by the copious luster of Your spear
point,

01:24:36.300 --> 01:24:39.382
it is because they saw also Your face
resembling the moon,

01:24:39.583 --> 01:24:42.821
giving out cool rays.

01:24:43.464 --> 01:24:47.119
O Devi, Your nature is to subdue
the conduct of the wicked;

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:51.554
this is Your peerless beauty inconceivable
by others;

01:24:51.755 --> 01:24:54.763
Your power destroys those who have robbed
the Devas of their prowess,

01:24:54.964 --> 01:24:58.933
and You have thus manifested Your
compassion even towards the enemies.

01:24:59.134 --> 01:25:02.430
What is Your prowess to be compared to?
Where can one find this beauty (of Yours)

01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:05.767
most charming, yet striking fear
in enemies?

01:25:05.968 --> 01:25:10.073
Compassion in heart and relentlessness
in battle are seen, O Devi,

01:25:10.274 --> 01:25:15.276
O Bestower of boons, only in You in all
the three worlds!

01:25:15.522 --> 01:25:19.441
Through the destruction of the enemies all
the three worlds have been saved by You.

01:25:19.642 --> 01:25:22.957
Having killed them in the battlefront, You
have led even those hosts of enemies

01:25:23.158 --> 01:25:27.532
upwards, and You have dispelled our fear
of the frenzied enemies of the Devas.

01:25:27.733 --> 01:25:30.444
Salutations to You.

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:35.147
Oh Devi, protect us with Your spear.
O Ambika, protect us with Your sword,

01:25:35.347 --> 01:25:39.421
protect us by the sound of Your bell and
by the sound of Your bow-string.

01:25:39.622 --> 01:25:43.860
O Chandika, guard us in the east,
in the west, in the north and in the south

01:25:44.061 --> 01:25:47.224
by the waving of Your spear, O Ishwari!

01:25:47.425 --> 01:25:50.735
Protect us and the earth with those
lovely forms of Yours,

01:25:50.936 --> 01:25:54.983
moving about in the three worlds, as also
with Your terrible forms.

01:25:55.184 --> 01:25:59.419
O Ambika, protect us on every side
with Your sword, spear and club

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:04.303
and whatever other weapons Your soft
hand has touched. Amen.

01:26:04.504 --> 01:26:07.347
Pujari and the yogis: Sakshat

01:26:07.548 --> 01:26:11.819
Shri Nirmala Devyai
Namoh Namah.

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:32.547
Shri Mataji: Very well. All right. Just
vibrations are too much.

01:26:32.748 --> 01:26:36.459
(Hindi) Havan? Eh?
Pujari: ...Aarti...

01:26:42.536 --> 01:26:47.850
Shri Mataji: Aarti. [Hindi conversation
with pujari]

01:27:09.682 --> 01:27:12.994
Pujari: Let us sing the Aarti
to Shri Mataji now.

01:27:18.450 --> 01:27:22.008
Shri Mataji: Don’t play those… which one
were you playing yesterday?

01:27:22.209 --> 01:27:25.862
Which bell were you playing yesterday?

01:27:28.566 --> 01:27:31.963
Yesterday which one was played?

01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:35.707
Warren: Which one did you use yesterday?
It was bad sound.

01:27:35.908 --> 01:27:42.078
Yogi: These small brasses. Shri Mataji:
These? You know, something else was there.

01:27:42.278 --> 01:27:50.276
Yogi: Somebody had some different…
Shri Mataji: Hm? What’s that?

01:27:55.762 --> 01:27:59.229
These you used yesterday? These are
all right.

01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:05.276
Yesterday something else was here. Yogi:
They’re metal, Mother, they’re not brass.

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:11.924
Shri Mataji: Let Me see. These are from
where? Ah, this is good.

01:28:12.322 --> 01:28:14.054
These are from India?
Gavin: Some present from India, yes.

01:28:14.263 --> 01:28:17.582
They were given to the sahaja yogis
in Bombay, I think. Shri Mataji: Who gave?

01:28:17.783 --> 01:28:19.577
Gavin: Somebody in India, I don’t know…
Shri Mataji: No, it’s not correct,

01:28:19.778 --> 01:28:25.175
this is not all right. That’s all right,
that’s all right.

01:28:33.426 --> 01:28:37.745
And this you need not play. Only that
will do.

01:28:41.179 --> 01:28:44.818
For that you have a very big one, which
goes with the complete, you see,

01:28:45.019 --> 01:28:48.624
because the movement –

01:28:48.825 --> 01:28:52.509
next time they are going to present you
with that bell, big bell,

01:28:52.710 --> 01:28:57.660
and the antah gharial (?).

01:28:58.546 --> 01:29:01.397
Such vibrations, I tell you.

01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:23.827
Yogi: Sarva Devi Deva Maha Moksha Pradayini

Yogi 2: Nirmala Shakti Mataji
Shri Nirmala Devi ki! Yogis: Jai!

01:35:39.121 --> 01:35:44.346
Shri Mataji: Today I bless you specially
that you’ll meet all My bhaktas,

01:35:44.547 --> 01:35:49.614
and Sahaja Yoga will grow very fast,
all over the world.

01:35:51.442 --> 01:35:55.782
I also bless you, those people who will
try to attack you,

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:59.936
will become sahaja yogis.

01:36:09.985 --> 01:36:14.419
The highest of all, I bless you with
the power of cleansing yourself,

01:36:14.620 --> 01:36:21.074
and cleansing others with your love,
with your devotion, with your dedication.

01:36:23.521 --> 01:36:26.522
May Adi Shakti bless you then.

01:36:26.723 --> 01:36:29.427
Yogi: Jai Mataji!

01:36:31.668 --> 01:36:36.559
Gavin: Mataji Nirmala Devi ki!
Yogis: Jai!

01:36:41.735 --> 01:36:44.696
Shri Mataji: May God bless you.

01:40:47.723 --> 01:40:49.794
Gavin: Mother, whatever mistakes we’ve made…
Shri Mataji: How much time do we have

01:40:49.995 --> 01:40:54.321
for the lunch? What time did you have
lunch?

01:40:54.522 --> 01:40:57.494
Yogi: Yesterday it was about quarter
to one, Mother.

01:40:57.695 --> 01:41:01.634
Shri Mataji: Will they do it at one o’clock,
if you tell them? So we can finish?

01:41:01.835 --> 01:41:04.754
Yogi: It’s normally one o’clock.
One o’ clock. Shri Mataji: See?

01:41:04.955 --> 01:41:09.547
Please ask them to keep it one. All right.
Or one fifteen,

01:41:09.748 --> 01:41:12.113
one fifteen would be better. Or
one o’ clock. All right.

01:41:12.314 --> 01:41:15.267
Yogi: Mother, he told me quarter to one…
Shri Mataji: Hm?

01:41:15.497 --> 01:41:17.347
Yogi: …before the puja.
Shri Mataji: What’s it?

01:41:17.548 --> 01:41:19.446
Yogi: The warden told me quarter to one
for the lunch.

01:41:19.655 --> 01:41:22.573
Warren: Quarter to one. The warden told him
a quarter to one,

01:41:22.774 --> 01:41:25.365
before starting the puja.

01:41:25.566 --> 01:41:27.740
Shri Mataji: Just request him …
Warren: We could change.

01:41:27.941 --> 01:41:30.385
Yogi: Let’s just change it, just change it
to one o’clock. Yogi 2: One o’ clock, yes.

01:41:30.593 --> 01:41:33.469
Shri Mataji: You see, you say that I went
and told they -

01:41:33.677 --> 01:41:41.301
because it is one o’clock always, so better
to have it at one. Let’s go down.

01:41:41.502 --> 01:41:43.996
There should be no objection because,
for having earlier, you know, people.

01:41:44.197 --> 01:41:49.723
Yogi: No, no, no.
Shri Mataji: (Hindi)

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:55.307
Is there any arrangement already?
Yogi: No. For havan? (Inaudible)

01:42:02.448 --> 01:42:04.938
You know, we don’t actually - in India
you don’t get (indistinct).

01:42:05.139 --> 01:42:08.941
What is this? Is rather particular one.

01:42:11.335 --> 01:42:13.150
Yogi: I think it’s a metal alloy.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:42:13.351 --> 01:42:16.531
Yogi: I think it’s a metal alloy… metal
alloy - mixture of metals.

01:42:16.732 --> 01:42:19.047
Shri Mataji: Ah, metal… (indistinct words,
sentence ends with ‘maryada’ or ‘maryadas’).
