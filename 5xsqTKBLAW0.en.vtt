00:07.134 --> 00:10.074
So first, open your heart,

00:11.201 --> 00:14.140
“Mother, please come in my heart.”

00:14.356 --> 00:19.636
All right, you say that.

00:19.849 --> 00:21.503
It’s better.

00:26.357 --> 00:31.077
It’s very simple way and I’m at your disposal.

00:35.028 --> 00:37.477
You see, it happens because of the past,

00:37.557 --> 00:40.235
because people have been unkind to you,

00:40.369 --> 00:42.788
maybe that you have not forgiven them.

00:42.868 --> 00:45.263
It can happen with anything

00:45.343 --> 00:49.731
and that makes you feel so closed, isn’t it?

00:49.811 --> 00:53.984
Because of the experiences you have had of other

00:54.064 --> 00:55.701
and you cannot forgive them.

00:55.781 --> 00:59.261
If you can’t forgive them, then
you become like that, your heart is closed,

00:59.341 --> 01:02.716
you can never be happy, you are very critical of others.

01:02.796 --> 01:05.757
All these things come with a closed heart.

01:05.837 --> 01:07.401
You cannot feel happy yourself.

01:07.481 --> 01:09.436
You don’t make others happy.

01:09.516 --> 01:12.939
Now how do you open your heart is

01:13.020 --> 01:16.424
just to feel for everyone,

01:17.924 --> 01:19.959
think about others.

01:20.997 --> 01:26.314
See now, when I travel I always buy
presents for people here and there

01:27.613 --> 01:33.144
and went to Poland

01:33.225 --> 01:37.231
and there was one shop I use to always buy things from there

01:37.312 --> 01:42.454
for all the Sahaja Yogis and the third time I went the lady said,

01:42.534 --> 01:45.016
“You are a very, very noble person.”

01:45.096 --> 01:45.998
“Why?”

01:46.155 --> 01:48.142
“You don’t buy anything for yourself.

01:48.222 --> 01:52.363
You buy only for others all the time. Never for yourself. ”

01:52.528 --> 01:56.836
I never think about Myself, but you people think for Me,

01:56.916 --> 01:59.521
I don’t think for Myself.

02:00.813 --> 02:03.895
Wherever it is, whatever it is, is all right.

02:04.162 --> 02:07.234
To Me it doesn’t matter

02:07.315 --> 02:12.124
where I live, how I live, what I eat, what – I don’t care.

02:12.338 --> 02:15.079
There’s no time to think well, they’re thinking of others,

02:15.192 --> 02:18.456
you have no time to think about yourself, Isn’t it?

02:19.058 --> 02:20.755
That how it works out.

02:21.401 --> 02:26.704
You think about others, immediately now,
a very small thing like that

02:26.785 --> 02:31.957
you see, I’ll tell you,
once I’d gone to a shop to buy some things

02:32.043 --> 02:35.823
for ladies and I was buying some saris.

02:43.075 --> 02:45.626
Alright. There I was buying saris

02:45.711 --> 02:50.366
and I bought these saris and took the saris out of the...

02:50.446 --> 02:53.693
I bought these saris and I was quite happy about it.

02:53.993 --> 02:59.361
Nice saris are there and I had to distribute
to whom should I do this and do that.

02:59.442 --> 03:02.006
I was just thinking.

03:03.461 --> 03:08.292
I just forgot that I have to buy a sari
for Myself because there’s a Puja.

03:08.378 --> 03:12.165
Just forgot about it completely.

03:12.246 --> 03:14.266
And later on it came into My head,

03:14.346 --> 03:20.349
“My God, now there’s no sari for Puja. Now what?”

03:21.236 --> 03:24.437
I was quite worried about it.

03:26.409 --> 03:30.668
It never comes to Me that

03:30.749 --> 03:33.899
“I need this” or “I need that. I need food.”

03:33.979 --> 03:38.272
Unless until you say, ‘Will you have food?’
I will not say bring food.

03:38.353 --> 03:41.011
It doesn’t come to Me.

03:42.037 --> 03:46.691
And you’ll be amazed that
when I reached the place, you see

03:46.771 --> 03:50.163
– it was a Diwali celebrated in Switzerland –

03:52.256 --> 03:57.978
I opened the thing and there was a sari
which I’d bought before,

03:58.058 --> 04:02.036
sometimes, an absolutely new with everything,

04:02.190 --> 04:05.845
so surprised. I said, “How did I have it?

04:06.399 --> 04:08.033
How do I have it so?”

04:08.113 --> 04:12.573
Just couldn’t imagine! I had not put
this sari there, it was kept somewhere.

04:12.660 --> 04:15.633
I was quite amazed, how did I have the sari,

04:15.714 --> 04:18.453
They were so upset:
"No sari, Mother what to do?

04:18.548 --> 04:20.394
Here it is!

04:22.108 --> 04:24.541
So when you think about others, you see,

04:24.621 --> 04:27.857
this Divine Power thinks about you.

04:27.948 --> 04:32.817
But when you thinking about yourself,
you are extremely miserable, horrible person.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.400
Nobody likes you.

04:34.481 --> 04:37.226
Nobody wants to talk to you and have anything to do with you

04:37.307 --> 04:39.679
because you’re so much concerned about yourself,

04:39.783 --> 04:44.666
and but when you think about others – small, small things,

04:44.746 --> 04:46.988
very small things.

04:47.088 --> 04:49.875
Another thing happened then,

04:49.956 --> 04:54.415
that once I went with My daughter to a shop

04:55.088 --> 04:59.962
and I liked one sari very much, I thought it’s good

05:00.042 --> 05:03.234
for the evening we have Puja program,

05:03.314 --> 05:06.021
but I’m rather miserly about Myself, so

05:06.102 --> 05:10.872
I said no, better not, it’s rather expensive,
why to buy it, so I came out.

05:12.537 --> 05:14.558
And it was all right.

05:14.638 --> 05:18.648
Then after some time, you see,

05:18.729 --> 05:23.122
I think it was some occasion,

05:23.216 --> 05:29.022
so My daughter brought the same sari
and she gave it to Me.

05:29.108 --> 05:31.279
And I was very much touched.

05:31.359 --> 05:35.689
You see, because I didn’t buy because I was feeling
– I’m a miserly person that way.

05:35.776 --> 05:38.538
So she bought it for Me and she gave it to Me.

05:38.618 --> 05:40.810
And she said, ‘You see what is this sari?’

05:40.891 --> 05:42.824
“Oh, my God,” I said.

05:42.904 --> 05:48.290
I mean, it’s very subtle understanding
of expression of love.

05:48.537 --> 05:51.783
I can afford this sari, she can also,

05:51.863 --> 05:54.767
but the way she went at the same day

05:54.853 --> 05:57.713
when I came home, she went
and bought the sari, kept it

05:57.806 --> 06:00.993
because she thought that it would be sold out.

06:01.529 --> 06:05.430
Because she liked the sari,  so she bought it.

06:05.511 --> 06:07.351
That’s how you can suggest.

06:07.431 --> 06:10.643
Like once we had a big dinner in our house

06:10.723 --> 06:14.250
and my another daughter had given Me
a sari as a present.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.297
They give sometimes.

06:16.937 --> 06:21.123
So that day I wore that sari and she was in tears.

06:21.203 --> 06:23.236
She said you have so many beautiful saris,

06:23.317 --> 06:25.202
of all the things, you wore this sari.

06:25.283 --> 06:28.036
“Because, I said, you are coming for dinner, so

06:28.116 --> 06:29.983
I thought it’s better to wear it.”

06:30.069 --> 06:33.669
‘How do you remember, Mummy, that I gave you this?’

06:33.749 --> 06:39.189
It’s just a subtle – now see,
this is just matter. Sari is a matter.

06:39.269 --> 06:40.869
You see, it’s just a matter,

06:40.949 --> 06:45.335
but through that matter how you can express love.

06:47.774 --> 06:54.097
I always give a simile of a glass mean
applied with metal.

06:54.177 --> 06:56.564
It becomes a mirror.

06:56.669 --> 07:01.189
In the same way, if you can apply your feelings

07:01.269 --> 07:05.396
to any matter it becomes like a mirror. Anything.
