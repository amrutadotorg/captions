00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:23.529
These days, in the modern times,

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:28.849
we are faced with confusions:

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.544
that’s a sign of modern times.

00:00:34.894 --> 00:00:37.812
At the same time,

00:00:38.013 --> 00:00:44.522
the en-masse urge to search the truth
is manifesting.

00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:48.003
It’s not only one individual who feels
like that,

00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:52.237
it’s not only eight or ten people who feel
like that,

00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:56.347
but masses and masses and multitudes

00:00:56.548 --> 00:01:00.503
are feeling you have to search an answer;

00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:06.401
you have to find out why are you here;
you have to know who you are;

00:01:06.602 --> 00:01:13.293
you have to find out your wholesomeness;
you have to find out the whole.

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:25.714
There is a big movement in a very subtle
way

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:31.157
that is moving masses towards this search.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:41.507
But we have no idea, perhaps, as to what
is the atmosphere in which we are born,

00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:47.858
what is the situation, how the whole
stage is laid. We have no idea.

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:52.850
As we have taken ourselves for granted
as human beings,

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:56.240
we take everything for granted.

00:01:56.441 --> 00:02:01.038
We are born human beings through
our evolution

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.995
(but) we do not even want to think why
we were evolved

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:07.157
from amoeba to this stage.

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:11.015
All the whys we just shut down.

00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:15.140
Whatever is there we want to see through
these eyes, through these ears.

00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:20.062
Through these sensory organs we want
to understand.

00:02:20.263 --> 00:02:25.087
But still the urge is there to know what
is beyond.

00:02:25.552 --> 00:02:30.148
The atmosphere in which we are born
cannot be understood

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.023
without having the light to see why there
is darkness,

00:02:34.224 --> 00:02:40.243
and darkness of such immensity, which
never [before] pervaded this Earth.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.876
It was never so much before, never, never
before, than it is today.

00:02:48.077 --> 00:02:50.390
That’s why the confusion comes in.

00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:53.359
And it has an action, it has a reaction
in the same way:

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.759
the more is the urge, the more is
the confusion,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.609
the more is the darkness.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.376
Now this darkness around us

00:03:02.577 --> 00:03:05.922
is not only of ignorance, as it used to be.

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:10.007
In the Vedas, or in the scriptures,
anywhere,

00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:12.876
it is written that you have to enlighten
yourself,

00:03:13.076 --> 00:03:15.311
you have to have the light.

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:29.085
Today is a very important day in our lives
as Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:29.416 --> 00:03:34.192
This is the day when Sahasrara was
opened out,

00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:41.633
which was really a very charismatic thing
that happened.

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:45.056
I never expected

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:51.162
that in my lifetime I’d be able to work
it out, but has been.

00:03:51.363 --> 00:03:58.118
And so many of you have got your
Sahasrara opened.

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:06.049
Without that, you could never have known
what is the truth.

00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:11.983
You were all lost, as everybody is.

00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:21.951
First of all, Sahasrara is the only way
we can perceive,

00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:28.539
understand and know the reality.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.368
You have come to know as to what is
the reality.

00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:45.657
and you’re enjoying that state where you
know

00:04:45.878 --> 00:04:49.332
what is the reality.

00:04:51.748 --> 00:04:58.138
It’s a great blessing that Sahasrara was
opened out

00:04:58.348 --> 00:05:02.641
and all of you got your Realization.

00:05:02.842 --> 00:05:06.118
Otherwise, all talks are just talks,

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:10.551
has no meaning, has no understanding

00:05:10.752 --> 00:05:17.854
and that’s why my first anxiety was
to open Sahasrara.

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:22.325
That worked out, worked out well

00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:27.651
and all of you have got your Sahasrara
opened.

00:05:27.852 --> 00:05:32.203
It’s a remarkable thing. Nobody can believe

00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:36.845
that so many of you have got your
Sahasrara opened,

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:44.797
but I can see now clearly the light
on top of your heads.

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:50.136
Whatever you have achieved is remarkable,
no doubt.

00:05:50.337 --> 00:05:59.041
It is because of honest searching, honest
searching, that you have got it.

00:05:59.242 --> 00:06:04.236
My doing is nothing because you were
just there

00:06:04.437 --> 00:06:10.193
like a lamp and I just enlightened it,
that’s all.

00:06:10.394 --> 00:06:13.005
It’s not such a big thing to do.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:22.621
As you people have achieved your state,
state of enlightenment,

00:06:22.822 --> 00:06:28.975
that you got it because you were
hankering after it,

00:06:29.176 --> 00:06:33.705
working it out and you did it!

00:06:33.906 --> 00:06:38.674
It’s very creditable. Credit doesn’t go
to me, I think,

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:42.321
because I had an open Sahasrara,

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:50.850
but to achieve that in you people was
so joy-giving for me.

00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:55.980
Now you will understand because if
Sahasrara is not open,

00:06:56.181 --> 00:07:00.396
you can’t talk [to] people, you can’t say
anything to them.

00:07:00.597 --> 00:07:04.337
It’s just they don’t understand.

00:07:04.538 --> 00:07:09.561
With the Sahasrara open, your understanding
improves so much.

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:13.112
That is what has happened with all of you.

00:07:13.313 --> 00:07:19.046
And I’m so very happy that it’s so many
people there are sitting here

00:07:19.247 --> 00:07:24.760
who have got their Sahasraras open and
there are many who have not come.

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:30.850
So it’s a big achievement for human beings

00:07:31.051 --> 00:07:37.286
to get it so much collectively, Sahasrara
opened,

00:07:37.487 --> 00:07:44.909
by which you know the truth, absolute
truth.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:51.207
Whatever you know after your Realization
is the absolute truth.

00:07:51.408 --> 00:07:55.578
You don’t argue then, don’t question,

00:07:55.779 --> 00:08:01.855
you just know it and you accept it as
a knowledge.

00:08:02.056 --> 00:08:08.491
It’s such a nice thing that it was all
there, but it was not open.

00:08:08.692 --> 00:08:13.848
And when it opened out, how people have
understood me

00:08:14.049 --> 00:08:17.481
and also the laws of the Divine.

00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:20.594
It’s such a blessing of the Divine

00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:24.506
that you have got your Sahasrara
opened out,

00:08:24.707 --> 00:08:28.944
for which you may say, “We didn’t do
anything, Mother.”

00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:38.123
It’s not so. Your search for truth was
intense and definite.

00:08:38.324 --> 00:08:43.248
You wanted to know the truth. That’s why
it has worked out.

00:08:43.449 --> 00:08:45.731
Otherwise no amount of money,

00:08:45.932 --> 00:08:49.588
no amount of effort, nothing would have
helped.

00:08:49.789 --> 00:08:53.306
Sahasrara had to open by itself.

00:08:53.507 --> 00:08:58.147
It’s all your building up, I should say.

00:08:58.348 --> 00:09:02.679
It’s all your doing, yourself,

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.972
that has brought forth such a beautiful
happening.

00:09:09.688 --> 00:09:16.555
I do not take any credit for that – at all.

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:23.015
Definitely, I must say, that I have made
you understand

00:09:23.216 --> 00:09:27.912
that it’s important that your Sahasrara
should be opened.

00:09:28.113 --> 00:09:33.314
No more arguments, no more suggestions,
nothing,

00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:40.739
but have your own Sahasrara open, which
tells you what is the truth.

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:48.130
In these beautiful circumstances, what
could your Mother say?

00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:51.328
I can only say that continue to live

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:56.433
a life of reality, of understanding.

00:09:56.634 --> 00:10:00.908
In everything you will find there is truth.

00:10:01.109 --> 00:10:10.839
And how do we use that truth is our
own achievement.

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:18.944
People are lost because they have no
knowledge.

00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:23.767
Knowledge from the books is no knowledge.

00:10:23.968 --> 00:10:28.383
Their knowledge must come from within,
from within themselves

00:10:28.584 --> 00:10:33.814
and that has happened because of Sahasrara
opening.

00:10:34.015 --> 00:10:39.816
In all the countries it has happened, and
it will be in the whole world;

00:10:40.017 --> 00:10:43.269
so many people will get Realization.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:48.549
But only thing, I feel that you people
should have

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:55.670
no emotional attachment to it – not
emotional,

00:10:55.871 --> 00:11:03.620
but realistic attachment, that it is there,
it has happened, it’s working out.

00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:08.202
Then you will be able to give Realizations
to others,

00:11:08.403 --> 00:11:12.060
you’ll understand the importance
of Realization.

00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:18.500
Unless and until you use it, you won’t know
what is the power of Realization is.

00:11:18.701 --> 00:11:24.283
So you must learn how to use this power
which is within you,

00:11:24.484 --> 00:11:32.560
which has started working out and which
will give you such an immense capacity.

00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:39.877
My health is little bit gone down,
after all, I am very old.

00:11:40.078 --> 00:11:46.441
But still I don’t feel tired in any way
while addressing you.

00:11:46.642 --> 00:11:52.300
I feel so enamoured that there are so many
Sahaja Yogis,

00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:58.274
so many whose Sahasrara is opened and
they’re enjoying their Sahasrara.

00:11:58.475 --> 00:12:01.997
Actually I would have liked you to ask me
questions,

00:12:02.198 --> 00:12:07.286
but you can write questions and send me
written ones.

00:12:07.487 --> 00:12:13.612
Then I’ll try to answer them some time.
Will be a much better idea.

00:12:13.813 --> 00:12:18.315
So thank you very much. May God bless you.

00:12:18.516 --> 00:12:23.464
Grow into Sahaj, grow into you being.

00:12:23.665 --> 00:12:28.406
May God bless you. All my blessings.
