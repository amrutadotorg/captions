00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.090
The problem was

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.200
that we could not

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.120
arrange the cooking nearer your stay

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.200
when you were here to walk a lot.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.030
But that walking was, I think, quite nice

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.010
and must have helped you.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.040
It's good for diarrhea and other problems that you have.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.010
Actually, I had seen the place but I hadn't seen the,

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.200
all the hostels and residential places.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.180
But for your information now somebody has donated Me

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.120
one acre of land free, free of cost,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.200
next to the sea on the other side. It is beautiful.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.150
And you should all send him a letter of thanks for that.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.110
So for next year I'm sure we can organize

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.140
something much better,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.200
in a much more collective way.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.170
Now the next tour is going to be,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.200
as you know,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.060
via Pune, Rahuri, Akluj.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.060
And these places are of more importance to us,

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.120
because Rahuri is a place where My forefathers ruled,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.070
so it's a very powerful place,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.040
because they were great Devi bhaktas.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.150
Also all the Naths, like Machindranath, Gorakhnath,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.060
all these great evolved souls called as avadutas

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.070
who were incarnations of the great Primordial Masters,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.060
worked in that area.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.100
They are the ones who talked of kundalini to begin with,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.130
openly.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.000
Then Pune, as you know, is called as Punyapattanam,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.110
is a very holy place since ages.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.030
And then you'll be going to a place called Nira,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.170
which is a river named after My name,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.190
and this river has got lot of land around it

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.140
which we have purchased,

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.170
where we are going to do agricultural work.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.110
And also you will see there the Bhima River

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.220
where you'll have your morning baths,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.030
and you'll enjoy the river part of it.

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.170
Also they have invited you for a function there.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.090
They have a very big function for two days.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.000
That is why I am not coming,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.030
because I wouldn't be able to do any programs

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.110
during that time, but you enjoy yourselves there.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.200
Then you are going to another interesting place

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.000
called Wani, which is a hill station

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.220
and a very beautiful place where there's a dam as well,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.140
and then you'll be returning back.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.000
I'm taking this opportunity to talk to you

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.060
because I seldom get time to talk to you.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.100
Now, as far as these outside things are concerned,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.000
they should all nourish you for your ascent.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.190
You have to see how much you have achieved within,

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.190
what kind of temperament you have developed,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.240
how much detachment,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.220
how much collective and how much generosity.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.220
All these things are to be seen.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.100
Judge yourself, don't ask others to judge you.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.140
How much balance, how much wisdom,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.020
because all these things should settle you down

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.190
in a way that gives you the necessary balance.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.160
I do not know how many years more we can do this,

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.190
but I think it's very good,

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.110
because now I see the difference

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.060
in the vibrations of people.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:07.110
Even before we had started in Ganapatipule and today,

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.140
there is such a tremendous difference.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:13.160
Actually I am getting cool breeze from your side now!

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.020
So the ascent is the main attention

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.210
and it's the main concern for all of us.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:27.210
You have come here for your ascent.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.100
I know there must have been lots of difficulties

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.140
and lots of inconveniences;

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.070
some people also burnt their skin - I am sorry for that.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.220
But in this country overdoing is regarded as something

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.100
improper, and we should try to avoid overdoing anything.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.210
So by overdoing it

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.170
we actually go to the right or the left,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.140
and so please try to avoid everything that is overdoing.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.140
For example, you may like your bath

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.210
in the Bhima River very much, but that's very nice

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.030
at a point where it is shallow;

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.160
but where it is deep, you should not go there.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.110
I'm only worried on that point because it's still,

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.050
one has to understand to keep yourself

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.140
in complete control and not to go to places

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.130
which are dangerous.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.230
Apart from that it is dangerous to you,

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.180
it is dangerous to the whole of Sahaja Yoga movement

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.020
and also to Me, because I get very worried

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.150
and upset if you get anything.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.210
So the main thing is

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.010
that you should keep yourself in the center.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.180
Do not go to extremes in anything.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.020
Everyone respects you if you are in the center,

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.090
but if you go to extremes they think

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.150
there's something wrong, basically wrong with you.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.160
And also it upsets the whole of the program.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:03.230
So My advice is that keep to the center,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.090
do not overdo anything,

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.010
keep everything in proper shape;

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.000
because it is strenuous for you people to travel like this,

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.150
to face this sun.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:22.000
This is the coldest time in Maharashtra,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.080
so you can imagine that what else we could do?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.040
I mean, we have to achieve the results

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:31.090
with the maximum of combinations.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.120
And I am sorry for the people who got these burns;

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.100
and actually because I had to treat them

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.180
and all that I was so delayed

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:45.180
that the whole program delayed, delayed, delayed - I mean,

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:49.150
it was too much. But now, no more of this.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.180
Please don't go in the sun at all, there is no need,

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:53.170
you have had enough of sun.

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.240
And the sun melts your brain,

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.100
and that makes persons mad in this country:

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.170
if we go in the sun we end up as mad people.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.150
So must be happening to brains also something,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.090
so it's better not to go in the sun at all

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:11.090
- keep it like that. Just for a while it's all right,

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:12.180
but don't sit in the sun.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.150
It's very inviting, I know, because you don't get the sun,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.230
but there is sun's rays inside this room, everywhere.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.150
So you shouldn't go and sit in the sun at all.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.090
That may really give you troubles,

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.130
because the sun in Akluj will be quite heavy,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.200
and I'm telling you also this because I may not be with you.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.170
So please look after yourself,

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.110
that is the only thing you can do for Me.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.240
For yourself, you must do your meditation,

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.220
you must worry about your ascent

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.170
and don't leave your things here and there, be careful.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.030
I am very happy the way they appreciated you

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.190
in the Temple of Mahalakshmi,

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.060
and that they respected you

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.180
and gave you something in your oti,

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.220
and that is something really very sweet of them

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.080
to accept you so readily into their own style

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.030
and into their community, you see.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.010
And they said that, "We couldn't make out who is Indian,

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.030
who is not Indian", because I think in Ganapatipule

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.230
also your skin has become little

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.000
less pale and maybe they said,

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.010
We couldn't make out who is who.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:23.200
So it's very good that now things are working out

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:28.110
that we are getting little, little homogeneous temperaments.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:35.110
Regarding pujas, as we had three pujas before

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:37.200
and the fourth one in Ganapatipule,

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.030
here also you'll have three pujas.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.240
In these three pujas I'm sure,

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.200
this being a quieter group,

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.160
you'll achieve much more,

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.060
and things will be very much better.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:56.000
If you have any problems you can let Me know,

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.170
we can arrange all that.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.140
But one thing, be sure that you do not over-exert yourself,

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:05.190
neither you starve yourself or overeat.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.240
Anything doing too much will not be good for this trip.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.190
Because I think in the second group

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.140
we are going to achieve much more

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.030
than what we had achieved before.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.140
So the second group people should try

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:24.110
to keep to a normal life, more attention to the spirit,

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:26.240
more attention to their ascent.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:31.160
The last but not the least is the great news

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:33.180
that so many others want to get engaged.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.020
I'll be very happy to get them engaged,

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.130
either in Pune or in Rahuri.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.120
It will be a very good idea, those who want to get engaged.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:45.040
And if there are some people who still want to get married,

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.210
let Me know. Maybe we might be able to arrange something

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.140
in Rahuri.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.240
But the best is that those who want to get engaged,

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:57.100
it's very easy to be done,

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.020
and it will be a good idea.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.080
So let Me know before we leave Pune,

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.130
anyone of such wants to.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.040
Now if you have any questions or anything to be said,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.040
please say it now,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.050
because I won't get such a chance to talk to you,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.020
this being such a small group here

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:14.190
- otherwise always in a puja;

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.100
now in Pune you'll find at least

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.050
five times more people than you are.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.120
What's she saying?

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.070
Hard time with your attention - what?

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.020
What is it?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:58.010
She wants to know how to settle her attention,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.160
and how to go deeper in meditation.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:05.010
Your attention goes to which places, is the point.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.090
You try to see around more.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.110
You see, first of all in meditation you must discuss this,

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.170
and there are many others who can tell you,

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.000
they'll work it out.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.180
And secondly the best way, you see,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.150
is to put your eyes on the Mother Earth.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.120
Concentrate on the Mother Earth is the best way.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:40.090
When you are walking,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.140
keep your eyes on the Mother Earth.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.060
If somebody is talking to you,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:46.110
keep your eyes on the Mother Earth.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.000
You see, then you'll absorb everything better

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:52.220
and you'll be stationed better, all right?

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.120
That's a very good thing to think about, that

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.000
our attention should not be frittered away.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.220
Gradually you'll settle down.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.120
I think most of you who have come for the first time

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.150
will find it a little difficult in the beginning to adjust,

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.080
but gradually you will.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.110
Because first of all our attention goes to small,

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:21.190
small things, like I have to sit on the ground

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.110
or You have to go by buses ,

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.200
or some sort of a filthy thing you see somewhere.

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:29.080
So the attention always goes to the defects

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.110
and the loopholes and to the filth,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.120
because attention has been like that.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.170
But then it starts going to the places of beauty.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.190
In little, little things you start seeing the beauty,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.060
in little, little things you start seeing the Divine.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.110
And then that's the time you should know that

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.190
your attention will enjoy everything.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.220
But normally you see the attention,

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.230
specially the kind of attentions we have,

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.090
goes to the wrong things.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.190
What is the loophole? We start judging everyone,

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.110
we start judging every place.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.000
Now see this place, if you sit here: to Me it is marvelous,

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.120
to you it may be just made out of what - this tin business,

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.080
this, that; all that you will start thinking.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.170
To Me it's beautiful,

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.110
because I see these beautiful saris spread here

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.170
and the beautiful flower arrangements beautifully done,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.010
something so special.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.010
And the background and everything done with such care.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.120
How did they go there,

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.190
and how did they have these things tied up?

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.010
It is remarkable.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.230
All these things come to My mind,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.200
and I start feeling very overjoyed

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.150
that My boys have worked so hard to put all these things up

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.010
and how nicely, how they must have arranged it.

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:39.140
All these ideas come into My head and I feel very elevated.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.120
I don't see the tins or I don't see anything else.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.150
It is what you see, where your attention goes.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.000
So try to see something beautiful.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.080
There is so many beautiful things that one can see.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.120
Now where, what I see is the heart of My children,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.110
the way they have done it, isn't it?

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.060
If you are a deep person you can see

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.030
how they have spread the saris sweetly,

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.170
how they have spread the flowers, how they've done it.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.090
So it is the attention: where does it go?

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.170
When you start seeing for yourself,  What is my comfort?

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:13.150
I should have this, I should have that,

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.010
then there is no joy.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.080
But the joy lies in seeing the deeper side

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.170
of what they have done for us,

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.230
how they have worked for us,

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.170
how they have brought things for us,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.090
how they have cooked for us with love.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.170
You are doing no work

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.200
compared to what these people are doing, no doubt.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:32.200
You are moving like royal people really, to be...

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.090
And they had to do it.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:39.060
Specially Ganapatipule was very difficult place.

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.090
People had to come all the way from Nagpur,

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.030
fifty people came to cook your food.

00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.150
Money is not everything.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.230
Even if you pay money, you can't do that. It's love,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.180
it's the feeling, it's the attention,

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.030
it's the generosity of looking after the guests.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.020
And that is how one should enjoy

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.130
how much they have done for us, how we are enjoying it.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.080
That's how your heart will become deeper and deeper.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.000
But if you have a convex heart

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:18.140
which always looks at something that's wrong, something bad,

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.150
something this, or at things,

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.120
What should I buy, what should I purchase?

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.140
All that, that can go off, your head.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.150
But if you want to purchase something nice with a good heart,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.030
then you will just find it whatever you want.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.230
And you can do it very fast.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.230
When I did big yesterday shopping for all the centers

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.110
and all that - worth, I think,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.200
in one lakh of rupees perhaps - for all the Indian centers,

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.140
and I did it in no time.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:49.170
Because it was for them, I was much better off.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.200
If it was for Myself I don't think I would have done so well.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:58.000
But you'd be surprised, I never buy anything for Myself,

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.180
I don't have time.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.210
You people give Me so much, I don't have to buy, either.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:10.030
So it is how you look at things, how you do things,

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.160
how you work it out.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.160
And yesterday the shop I went to was all full of fragrances.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.160
Everything there was fragrance and everybody was feeling it.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.150
It's just because I was enjoying the whole thing,

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:24.040
enjoying it, doing for others.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.010
It's not  others - who is the other?

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.040
Because Sahaja yogis are not the others for Me.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.060
I am doing for Myself, but My greater being,

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.200
My higher being.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.120
That is how you should look at things, all right?

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.240
Then you will enjoy.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:46.230
And now what I have to say to the people of Sangli

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.020
is that here we did a puja quite in the past

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.210
and also did once again recently,

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:55.160
and also in Sangli a lot has come in the newspaper

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.110
and that is why a lot of work has been done.

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:00.110
And here Sahaja Yoga can also establish itself here

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:04.060
because the atmosphere is very nice and silent,

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.160
and also all the people here are ready to help.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.170
So to the people of Sangli I want to give a small gift,

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.110
and please they should accept it, this is My request.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:23.120
There is also one more gift but it is still in the market.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.070
Who will take it? it is still in the market.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.190
I bought lots of things but they're yet not delivered,

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.190
so one thing I have to give them.

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.020
Bring it, come now.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:50.070
So this is our Sahaja yogi, Mr. Tawde,

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:54.130
who is a very big officer here. He has done this.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.140
This gentleman is Mr. Mali who is the district

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:09.050
- what do we say to  district ?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.060
- he is the district agriculture officer here

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.200
who looks after the agriculture of the whole district,

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:19.090
and he got his realization in '75.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.050
And now he is posted here, so he came for the puja.

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.170
All his family is here.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.220
So Mr. Tawde who has done all the good work for you,

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.050
give him a hand.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.150
Also here

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.210
there is Mr. Yadav Sahib

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:44.200
who has published everything in the paper,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.090
and who is the newspaper gentleman here.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.130
Mr. Yadav - give him a hand.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.060
They are so highly placed, but so humble - just look at that.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.040
He is the man who is in charge of the whole thing here,

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:24.120
he is the engineer.

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:26.210
And he's the gentleman who is in charge of the,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.170
all the districts agricultural activities,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.030
he is the officer in charge.

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.060
And another one is the editor of the newspaper.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.200
You see, when people get egoistical, they just don't relate

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.100
themselves to the surroundings.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.120
They don't understand how far they are.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.200
It's like a ball which you just give it a push

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.100
and it goes up in the air,

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:54.040
without knowing that it's just a ball full of air.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.100
That is why you call bumptious, you see?

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:02.190
So those who really are solid people,

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.110
who have some solid training and solid upbringing,

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.210
they don't get into ego trips,

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.160
they don't get into these trips. They,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.100
they first of all become very humble,

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:19.130
and try to learn and become humbler,

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.140
and again learn and become humbler.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.240
Like Newton has said that:

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.140
"I am like a little, I am like a little child

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.170
collecting pebbles on the shores of Knowledge"

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.130
- a person like Newton, he said so.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.030
But nowadays, I find

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.100
it's difficult to find people of that kind.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.030
But those who are very learned,

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.190
in the West also I've seen them being very humble people;

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:56.160
in their writings, in their whole behavior

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.050
you can see they are very humble people.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:03.130
Humility is a sign of knowledge.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.100
When the tree is loaded it bends down.

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:12.000
When it is loaded with fruits, it bends down.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:17.050
In the same way a person who has knowledge will bend,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.180
will be very humble.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.150
Now, today's puja has really a lot of importance as it is

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.150
today the Puja of Shri Mahalakshmi, and the importance

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:36.030
which we have of Shri Mahalakshmi in Sahaja Yoga is of

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:39.090
no other Shakti. Because Shri Mahalakshmi is the Shakti

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.060
which we call as the Sushumna channel,

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.240
She resides in it, and through Her

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.040
the parasympathetic nervous system is activated.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:51.220
To make this Mahalakshmini Shakti strong, in our evolution

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:55.230
there occurred many events, and in this the

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.150
important event was the incarnation of Shri Mahalakshmi.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.120
Shri Mahalakshmini took many incarnations, 

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:05.140
and She is so courageous that She took 

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.180
the form of a human body and took birth in this Universe,

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.220
and has done a lot of work.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.210
It is surprising that nobody gave us information

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.200
about all these incarnations of Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:22.090
and nobody has the deep and detailed description about this.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.140
Now the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi is based

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.230
on the Principle of Shri Lakshmi. That means the Mother

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.050
of Shri Lakshmi is Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.090
we should say, the Mother of Shri Lakshmi.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.060
That means when Shri Lakshmi comes to humans,

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.060
Shri Lakshmi is the one with balance,

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.080
a woman in the form of a Devi.

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.170
She is in such a balance that She stands on a lotus.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.090
She has two lotuses in Her hand.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.090
One of the lotuses is pink, and also in that

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:58.040
lotus is also a tenderness. The meaning of the pink lotus

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.240
is such that the person who is a lakshmipati, he will have

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.160
Shri Lakshmi, that is in the character of that person

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.170
will be this pinkness that means will have sweetness in

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.120
his character. He should not be dry.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:16.120
The second thing is that if we would see a lotus, then

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:19.190
in that lotus, even if a bee comes into it, this bee gets

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.160
also a place in it, and the bee has so many thorns,

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:26.230
but even then it gets a place in the lotus. That means

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:30.050
it is also welcomed. Therefore, the person who has

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:34.060
Shri Lakshmi, he will welcome everyone, however the guest is.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:36.230
He will ask for the comforts of everyone,

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.050
even if that person is small or big. He will take care

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.240
of everyone according to their social status,

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.050
he will be hospitable to everyone in a equal way.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.120
Third thing is that the meaning of it is

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:53.070
that one should be generous. And if in the hand of a person

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:56.230
there is no generosity, then such a person

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:00.160
is not a lakshmipati. Danat (the quality of generosity)

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.030
is such a joy-giving quality,

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.000
and it cannot be compared with acquiring anything.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.030
The person who attains the power of generosity,

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.000
I think such a person is the greatest of all,

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.040
because such a person has reached to the

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.210
culmination point in the evolution of mankind.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.230
One should be able to give generously. As Shri Lakshmi

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:25.150
donates with the left hand, in the same way

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.020
a person who is lakshmiputra (indicating the principle of

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:33.000
Lakshmi in a man) should also give generously with his left

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:36.200
hand in such a way that even the right hand does not know it.

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.230
Giving with the left hand signifies giving very sahaj

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:45.020
(spontaneously) without any effort. And all the desire

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:49.100
must be only of generosity. And truly in this world

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:53.010
there are so many material things, and I think for

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.020
all these things there is only one importance,

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.060
and that is these things we can give to others.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:03.040
By means of generosity we can show the greatness

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:07.120
of our heart. We can show our affection and warmth,

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:11.020
and that is why all these things have importance,

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.040
otherwise there is no importance of all the material things.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:17.110
There are so many statues of swayambhus. Amongst

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:21.030
them the statue of Shri Mahalakshmi is considered as the

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:25.150
most important by us in Sahaja Yoga. By Her grace our

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.060
By Her grace our Kundalini rises in the channel

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.210
of Shri Mahalakshmi. She is above Shri Lakshmi Principle.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:36.170
Now this (right) hand is like this.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.020
This hand is the symbol of shelter.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:45.100
It has two meanings: shelter - give shelter to everyone,

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.190
this hand gives protection to everyone. But in reality

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:53.000
we see just the opposite. The lakshmipatis put a lot of

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.230
pressure and fear on everyone. On the contrary

00:28:57.050 --> 00:29:00.080
She (Lakshmi) is just standing quietly on a lotus,

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.170
not showing off anything special about Her. Otherwise

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:07.100
people need cars and this and that, to show that they are

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.170
so wealthy and are superior in comparison to others.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.120
On the other hand She is not putting any weight or

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:18.170
pressure on others. She is standing so lightly, so delicate

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.070
that nobody should be troubled because of Her. The real

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:25.030
lakshmipati will sit somewhere in the corner, will sit

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.210
with complete faith and silence, and will leave quietly.

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:32.000
Even if he wants to give something he will give

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:35.090
and say, Shri Mataji, this is something which is

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.110
my donation, but please do not disclose my

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.220
name, and You accept it somehow. I have given this

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.180
at Your Lotus Feet - finished now, I have nothing

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.010
to do with it any more. When I tell him that I do not

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.190
take money but it is to be given to the trust

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.160
(and for which we have to know the name of the donor)

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:55.150
he will say, You can put it in the name of anybody else,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.200
I have no objection. I have given this to You,

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.090
I do not want my name to published. Only if You want to

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:05.200
disclose my name to the income tax authorities I do not mind,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.080
but otherwise I do not want my name or anything.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:13.170
He will be requesting very humbly not to disclose his name.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.040
This person we can call is a real lakshmipati.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.140
The (right) hand of Shri Lakshmi is pointing up in this way.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:23.050
That means your attention should be above, towards a

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.240
higher goal. So when a person becomes a lakshmipati,

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.010
then his attention is such that he starts thinking,

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.050
Now I have become lakshmipati, but now, how can

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.000
I attain God?  When this stage comes in a human being,

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:40.030
he has wealth and he receives a lot of wealth. Becomes rich,

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:44.020
and then when he gets the feeling of not achieving the inner

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:47.230
richness, then one can say that the Principle

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.110
of Shri Mahalakshmi has been awakened in him.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.190
And in that Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi the Kundalini

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:58.100
is awakened. When She is awakened that is why we say,

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.180
"Udo, Ambe" meaning: "Shri Kundalini, please, get awakened."

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
We say this in the temple of Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.150
because She can get awakened only through

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:11.010
the channel of Shri Mahalakshmi. And thus She is awakened

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.010
in the channel of Shri Mahalakshmi and then penetrates

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.140
the above chakras, and comes up and completely

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.010
penetrates the Chakra of Sahasrara. Now let us see

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.200
how many incarnations of Shi Mahalakshmi we've had.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.130
Firstly, the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi is very close

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.210
with a guru, a relation of plenty of love and purity.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.070
Now if we see from the beginning, by all the Adi Gurus,

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.140
She was born to them as a daughter or as a sister.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.080
Like the daughter of Janaka was Shri Sita - the form

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:44.240
of Mahalakshmi. She was the Principle of Mahalakshmi.

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.130
and She was the daughter of Janaka.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.040
Then the sister of Shri Nanaka - Nanaki -

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.040
She was Mahalakshmi. Her relation was of sister.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.240
In the same way, the daughter of Mohammed Sahib, Fatima,

00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:58.170
She was Mahalakshmi. After Her, Radha was the form:

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:01.100
of Mahalakshmi, then comes Mary:

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.030
Mary was Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.020
and Her relation was of purity. She was so pure

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.210
that with Her purity She gave birth to Shri Christ.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.130
So She was a form of complete pure Virgin.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.100
And as She was a form of Virgin, because of Her purity,

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.070
She got a son pure as Christ.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.200
Because of these incarnations of Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.090
our chakras at the top within are being fixed up.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.150
That means Shri Rama's Chakra is on the right side

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.210
of the heart, here She is in the form of Shri Sita,

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.110
here She is in the form of Radha,

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:35.080
here in the form of Mary. And at this place these powers of

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:38.180
Shri Mahakali, Shri Mahalakshmi and Shri Mahasaraswati

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.220
meets in the form of one Power which is Shri Adi Shakti.

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.210
She recides in Sahasrara

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.010
but it is said that in Sahasrara

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.130
She exists in a form of Mahamaya.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.140
Adi Shakti is of a form of Mahamaya.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.060
That is why the result of all these three Powers

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.150
was like this, that Adi Shakti comes

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.110
into this world in the form of Mahamaya

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:06.150
and She can penetrate the Sahasrara of everyone.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.170
As you know, She is in front of you

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.010
and you know all about it.

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.200
So I don't need to tell anything more.

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.170
This is how, out of this Shri Mahalakshmi,

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.160
Shri Adi Shakti was incarnated. She has got all

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.050
the three Powers of  Shri Mahakali, Mahalakshmi

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.080
and Shri Mahasaraswati. These Powers are within Her.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:30.000
Only through this Shri Mahalakshmi Principle,

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.230
our pure desire - which is Shri Amba, actually power of

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.240
Shri Mahakali - can be awakened. She can do it.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.190
That is why Adi Shakti is so important, because through

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.190
these three Powers, even if everything is ready, but

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.000
at the last what work has to be done,She is need.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.160
That means the work is achieved through these Powers.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.050
Even if this thing is very easy for us to achive,

00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:00.010
we do get it easily, but still you have to work hard;

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:03.240
otherwise that work cannot be done.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.080
It is quite difficult. If it would have been possible

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.120
only by Shri Adi Shakti, then there wouldn't be any need

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.040
of doing all such confusion.

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:17.080
You have to work hard,

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:20.100
and your support is required to accomplish the task.

00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:23.030
You are on the stage now, not Me.

00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.220
You can take My power and use It,

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:28.200
but know that now you are on the stage.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.200
And that is why you are worthy of worship. You are special.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.240
What am I? Whatever powers I have,

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:37.020
I have them since eternity; there is nothing special about it.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:40.040
But you should use them. You must receive it,

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.240
you must achieve it, you should have mastery over it.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.050
This is the real desire of Shri Adi Shakti,

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.000
this is Her pure desire. And for this pure desire

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:54.120
She is striving very hard every moment. And in this

00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:58.000
you have all earned it, achieved it, accepted with love,

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.080
and going ahead you have progressed in it.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.020
This is a very big satisfaction for Me.

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.230
And in this satisfaction I forget everything,

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.070
like how much I had to suffer in the past.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.220
In the past many years I suffered a lot.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.060
How much Sita had to suffer, how much Radha 

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.230
had to suffer, how much Mary had to suffer:

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.120
I forget all that past. I feel

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.120
as if nothing has happened in the past, and that

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.100
whatever is happening now is something special.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.130
But in this incarnation one thing is to be remembered,

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.100
that Shri Mahalakshmi has incarnated in human form

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.230
- in human form. But the Devi which we call

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.190
as Shri Mahakali has not incarnated in human form.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.080
She always existed in the form of a Devi.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.140
That is why to come in the form of Devi is easy,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.230
but to come in the form of a human being is very

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.050
difficult task. And to fight like a human being and

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:56.140
live with the human beings is even more difficult.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.080
Also to live, keeping within the limitations of human beings,

00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:03.230
is much more difficult. All this work in the form of human 

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.210
beings was done by all the Devas, and today we are experiencing

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.220
the auspicious fruits of all the work done in the past.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.180
The great work done in Ganapatipule is worthy to be written

00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:18.220
in history; big work has been done, and it will keep

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.160
happening every year ahead. My ardent desire is that

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.000
it continue at least for the next three, four years.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:26.100
If this happens, then you people will also get the idea, that

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.150
what we've started from Ganapati 

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.210
has reached perfectly Sahasrara.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:34.170
This is so Aditi (Primordial) that it's difficult to express

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
in words. And all this you should receive. You should receive

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:42.210
whatever belongs to Me, this is My only pure disire.

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.070
And when this works out, then I don't want anything

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.120
Let the ladies do the puja.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:32.130
I will tell you what you have to do and you let them do it.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:37.060
Do not touch it, do not touch with your hands.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.140
Carefully, you should not touch the bowl even,

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:44.230
you do not touch with hand.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:49.090
Hold at the edges. Only hold at the edge, and now put.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.130
Say Shri Sukta mantra, say of Ganapati Atharva Sheersha.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.030
Put.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:14.240
It is correct.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.190
Let them do it.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:25.130
No hands. Hold here.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.190
Now is so, all the men here,

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.160
first remove this here,

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.210
and tell them to wash My feet.

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:12.040
Put water on the feet and wash them.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:14.170
Say Shri Sukta.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.170
Put! Remove it.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:32.130
Do not put hand. Remove this, in that dish.

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:43.240
This kumkum is very good because it's been vibrated.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:45.210
You all should take a little bit

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.010
give with a spoon to everyone later on.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.110
Do not touch with your hands.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.140
Just bring water, not hot water.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.200
Puja should be done with silence and peace of mind.

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.200
Nothing will go wrong.

00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:45.090
Now you see they did not use the word poverty; alakshmi!

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.010
that means what is not Lakshmi Principle -

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.040
that they did not say daridrya (poverty) word.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:56.050
They did not say destroy daridrya, but they said alakshmi.

00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.180
See how subtle it is.

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.200
All that is inauspicious,

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:05.230
that which is not in the Lakshmi Principle,

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:10.040
all that - it covers a vast domain.

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:13.180
This all is written after a lot of study

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:17.100
- with clear and proper thinking.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.200
See the vibrations of it.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:57.010
Oh, not into that.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:56:01.080
Earlier there was water in it, isn't it?

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:05.220
Do it now; what can we do, now it has happened.

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:09.040
That is what I was saying.

00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:15.030
Now pour it, now is no use, there is no difference.

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:18.140
Now do it like this,

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:21.230
listen to Me now.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.160
Put water on My feet, and keep it aside

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.240
without touching the water.

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:16.230
From Kamal it goes to Vishwa, nothing in between!

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:19.010
Did you understand it?

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:21.100
The description of the Mahalakshmi,

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:24.010
that She is very fond of lotus,

00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.080
and then She is fond of the whole universe.

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:29.110
Nothing in between!

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.180
Rub it on your hands.

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:58.220
Now start hundred-and-eight names.

00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:01.150
Do you still have something on Shri Mahalakshmi?

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.070
And this is the thing one should understand,

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:47.100
that Mahalakshmi Tattwa becomes the Viratangana,

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.040
means the Buddhi, the brain

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.210
- the awareness, we should say, She becomes that.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.070
Narayani Shakti, or we say Viratangana

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:03.210
is the power of Virata in the brain.

01:01:04.030 --> 01:01:06.170
So lastly is the Principle of Shri Mahalakshmi -

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:11.230
central nervous system is Mahalakshmi Tattwa also, in a way.

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:32.060
I'm just explaining to him,

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.110
what happens is this Mahalakshmi Principle

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:40.120
starts after the Lakshmi Tattwa has been manifested itself:

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.170
means when the Lakshmi has been shown through affluence

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.080
and the satisfaction of affluence,

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:49.170
then the Mahalakshmi Principle starts developing in us,

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.160
that we think of our ascent.

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.020
Then it happens that,

01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:56.170
that in our brain we have three Powers

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.200
- is Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:00.140
- above the Agnya Chakra.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:03.140
There it so happens that two Powers,

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:08.090
is Mahakali and Mahasaraswati, they are blessed by,

01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:13.000
they are blessed by the Mahalakshmi Principle.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.110
And Mahalakshmi Principle is basically

01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:19.220
the Principle of Narayana. Narayana is the Vishnu;

01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:22.000
and Vishnu becomes Shri Krishna.

01:06:22.090 --> 01:06:24.160
And this Shri Krishna Shakti which is here

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:28.030
becomes Virata's Shakti there - that is Viratangana.

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.220
But when She mixes up with these two,

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:34.240
then the Mahamaya Power starts manifesting,

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:37.130
because She's - you know how Krishna was,

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:39.060
He always used to play tricks, this that,

01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:41.030
hide this, do this, do

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.180
- all those things start at this Power.

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:46.170
So that's why it is not so starkingly open.

01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:48.240
Like the Mahakali Power is so open;

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:53.070
Mahalakshmi Power is a, is a hidden Power, like Mary.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:56.150
Nobody could have believed that Mary could be Mahalakshmi

01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:57.230
or Radha or Sita:

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:01.120
simple, hidden away, but very powerful.

01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:05.080
But at the time of the Sahasrara it becomes Mahamaya.

01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:09.140
People don't know how to find out the reality

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:14.050
of the Adi Shakti. Do you follow that?

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.110
She is the one who sustains the whole Universe

01:09:19.190 --> 01:09:21.060
and She becomes the Spirit,

01:09:21.150 --> 01:09:23.150
the Spirit of the whole Vishwa,

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:26.000
which Vishwa Gyaneshwara has written.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:32.160
He has said,  Vishwatmake Devi

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.110
- the God of the whole Spirit of the Universe.

01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:40.030
So She becomes the Universe then.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:25.040
We can have two foreigner men and two foreigner ladies

01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.190
can come up, who are married.

01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:38.230
You shouldn't come, Richard, of all the persons.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.230
Please be seated.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.190
You'll always have a chance.

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:50.030
Those who cannot get this chance should come.

01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:54.200
He's the first one to get up, I told you.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.220
Please sit down.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.210
Not from England, because English people

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:03.130
get a chance always, please.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:06.000
Must be from Australia or some places

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.140
where they don't get a chance.

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.190
English people should give a chance to others.

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:12.060
You meet Me so often, you are there and wash the feet.

01:12:12.130 --> 01:12:13.140
Come along.

01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:16.130
Where is her husband? He's English, is he?

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.060
May God bless you. All right.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:22.030
So get some Australian people.

01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:24.240
Even if, I mean, you are not married to the same lady,

01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:26.100
is not necessary.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:28.240
But some Australians or Austrians or some people

01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:31.020
who do not get a chance.

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.190
Spanish is good. All right. May God bless you.

01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:54.240
English are the most privileged people I should say,

01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:57.050
aren't they?

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:42.150
The feet you want to rub? You have never rubbed My feet?

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:44.100
All right, come along.

01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:50.080
Now, hold it with the right hand, rub it with the left.

01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:54.070
You have rubbed it - My feet, haven't you?

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.150
You have rubbed. And you have rubbed My feet?

01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:00.040
Have you rubbed My feet?

01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:05.130
Have you rubbed My feet with water?

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:08.150
You have done it, all right, then let him do it.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:37.160
See now the vibrations. You put your hands there.

01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:44.160
Better now? All right.

01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.190
May God bless you all.

01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:46.080
May God bless you all.

01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:49.060
May God bless you all.

01:54:54.170 --> 01:54:57.100
May God bless you all.
