00:00:01.365 --> 00:00:03.690
My dear seekers,

00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:09.111
I’m thankful to Gavin Brown

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:14.033
that he has been able to sum up some of the things I’ve said before

00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:23.189
and I don’t have to go into all the details of
what I told you last time.

00:00:25.377 --> 00:00:28.902
Some of you have come for the first time here. (Tape interrupted).

00:00:35.327 --> 00:00:43.351
As he said Tantra is the technique.

00:00:45.048 --> 00:00:49.083
It’s a technique and Yantra

00:00:49.108 --> 00:00:54.810
in Sanskrit language means the mechanism.

00:00:55.862 --> 00:00:59.478
So the technique of the mechanism.

00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:03.446
Now what is this mechanism we are talking about?

00:01:04.025 --> 00:01:08.900
Is there any mechanism outside or inside us?

00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:19.166
Or is it worked through some subtle method?

00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:28.676
All these questions should come to our mind
if you are thinking and if you are true.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.212
But I see that in the West

00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:39.253
people though are very much developed materially,

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:46.044
they have sorted out very material questions and problems,

00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:49.902
they are very well equipped,

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:55.333
but as far as spiritual life is concerned,

00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:59.006
they – they are very naive.

00:02:01.994 --> 00:02:09.839
Though they have such a great personality
like Christ to follow about a model form

00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.782
but maybe because of an organized religion

00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:19.214
perhaps it was not possible

00:02:19.362 --> 00:02:27.717
for people who were seeking truly
to penetrate into it through meditative methods.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.490
So this Tantra or the technique

00:02:37.894 --> 00:02:42.281
which works out our Self Realization

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:47.793
is to be known, to be understood fully

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.684
and the Yantra that works out

00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:56.750
you have already got and thanks go to
Patrick who has made a beautiful sketch of that

00:02:56.921 --> 00:03:03.330
Yantra which is within you, is the instrument which is within you.

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:07.366
But when we think of an instrument

00:03:07.548 --> 00:03:14.111
with our human mind we cannot think of
an instrument which is a living instrument.

00:03:14.554 --> 00:03:18.487
It is beyond our conception to understand a living machine.

00:03:20.963 --> 00:03:26.257
This one is a living instrument within you.

00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:33.854
When you see a tree sprouting out of a small little seed,

00:03:34.373 --> 00:03:38.557
working out its blossoming one has to know

00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:46.111
that there must be some technique of some mechanism

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:51.789
that works out this beautiful tree to grow.

00:03:52.153 --> 00:03:56.799
And when we evolved from amoeba to this stage

00:03:56.947 --> 00:04:02.480
we have to think there must be some mechanism

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.341
which thinks, understands, organizes, loves,

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:15.702
which has brought about this human stage from that amoeba stage.

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:26.293
In the ancient India – long time – people had lots of time

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:34.564
they went into themselves, into their
being through meditative understanding.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.088
‘They’ had a glimpse of this mechanism

00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:49.283
and they talked about it and wrote about it
and that’s how this Yantra

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:58.427
– the mechanism – and the Tantra – the maneuvering of it,
the technique of it – came into being.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.087
But it was a secret science.

00:05:03.394 --> 00:05:12.863
It was a very secret science and
it was kept hidden from general public.

00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:19.826
It was used by very few great masters

00:05:19.928 --> 00:05:25.064
who lived in the jungle, had one or two disciples,

00:05:25.212 --> 00:05:34.014
worked on them for years together
and taught them about the technique of Divine.

00:05:34.548 --> 00:05:41.272
They had to leave everything, their family, everyone,

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:50.004
live with the Guru, lead a complete separate life

00:05:50.515 --> 00:05:58.245
and go into a complete transformation
under the guidance of their loving Gurus.

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.880
This was in ancient times.

00:06:07.507 --> 00:06:11.883
And what did they achieve, and what did they have,

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:17.126
is all written in our scriptures.

00:06:17.223 --> 00:06:26.325
What do you expect out of Self Realization
is written in the Bible, in the Koran, in the Torah

00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:31.835
and also in all the Indian philosophy.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:44.858
Only people say it that in some of these scriptures

00:06:44.983 --> 00:06:51.071
it is written in a very secretive manner,

00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:57.931
under some words that,
“I will appear before you as tongues of flames.”

00:06:58.242 --> 00:07:03.349
Now nobody knows what’s ‘tongues of flames’ is.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:09.097
There are so many sentences which
you can find out now that you go and read

00:07:09.223 --> 00:07:15.173
which nobody can explain unless and until
they have had an experience of Kundalini.

00:07:15.514 --> 00:07:20.831
This is the Yantra – the mechanism, is the Kundalini,

00:07:21.512 --> 00:07:29.615
is a living force within you, It exists,
it is there, is placed for your Realization,

00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:40.339
for your jumping into another awareness
which is promised to you through various scriptures,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.273
through various incarnations.

00:07:44.716 --> 00:07:52.941
It is within you. Nobody told you lies.
There is nothing but truth written in these books

00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:05.717
but it was to be guarded. It was to be made into secret
because people would have used it for their purposes.

00:08:06.148 --> 00:08:10.433
And they have despite all that.

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:15.184
First, I would like to speak about Self Realization

00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:22.789
because that is blissful and then
answer you about the so-called tantrikas.

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.213
I have to talk about it though I have told about these things

00:08:28.338 --> 00:08:33.138
in the previous lecture because
there are many here that were not here.

00:08:35.288 --> 00:08:45.520
I have now shown here all the centers
and all the mechanism that is within us.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:52.268
We have also given you a picture of that, I have told you
which are the deities sitting on all these different

00:08:52.688 --> 00:08:59.479
Chakras as we call the centers which have incarnated on this earth,

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:05.702
have built up our being one by one gradually
in different evolutionary processes

00:09:05.838 --> 00:09:10.860
and how we have become human beings,
this I have told you last time.

00:09:11.065 --> 00:09:19.183
This is the Yantra and the mechanism
that is this Yantra – Kundalini –

00:09:19.683 --> 00:09:28.705
is a holy mechanism. And this mechanism is specially created

00:09:30.562 --> 00:09:38.249
within the being of the One Main , of the One means the Macrocosm

00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:45.267
and we are the cells – all of us – in that.

00:09:45.653 --> 00:09:50.510
We were made aware as fishes of the soil, we became reptiles.

00:09:50.657 --> 00:10:02.049
We were made aware of the food available at the heights,
we raised our head. Gradually we became human beings.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:09.169
After this state we started thinking of God.

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:15.538
We started thinking on something beyond.

00:10:15.787 --> 00:10:24.418
Man is the only animal who thinks of God and of searching.

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:31.175
Is the man aware that he has to become something?

00:10:31.301 --> 00:10:37.638
Why is he so confused? Why is he under so tension?
What is he searching?

00:10:43.155 --> 00:10:50.157
He is searching something of which he has a glimpse

00:10:50.668 --> 00:10:59.727
– a glimpse of that Joy he kept with him
and that Joy comes from his Self – Atma – in his heart –

00:11:00.203 --> 00:11:03.031
he has not felt.

00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:07.035
He has not been able to manifest the power of his Self

00:11:07.172 --> 00:11:14.734
but there is a mechanism placed within him,
properly built up inside,

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.981
all the time present in all the human beings

00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:29.666
just like this as it is placed in the One Being.
In His image it is also placed within you.

00:11:32.218 --> 00:11:42.921
As I said last time that you are
all built to be just like computers.

00:11:44.062 --> 00:11:47.993
Now the job is to put you to the Main’s.

00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:54.904
That’s why you are seeking. That’s the only urge you have in life.

00:11:55.073 --> 00:12:05.061
All other urges are actually the side issues.
You think you are searching in money, in position is a myth.

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:11.896
Those who have money are dissatisfied, those
who have positions are dissatisfied, everybody is dissatisfied.

00:12:12.123 --> 00:12:22.378
The satisfaction time only comes to you
when you will reach the real thing which you are searching

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:27.639
and the real thing is your Self and nothing else.

00:12:28.127 --> 00:12:33.465
All other things are useless because
you are not searching anything else,

00:12:33.612 --> 00:12:43.180
you are only searching your Self
and that Self is the reflection of God almighty,

00:12:47.988 --> 00:12:49.788
that is within your heart.

00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:55.543
Now the mechanism that is placed
within you is this beautiful thing inside

00:12:55.705 --> 00:13:00.215
which is placed inside your spinal chord and not outside

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:06.502
except for the last Chakra which is in the red color

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:13.622
that is outside in the prostate [the pelvic plexus].

00:13:13.974 --> 00:13:20.187
And this is a very, very important Chakra

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:27.370
which controls the survival within us

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:32.313
– I’m sorry the Pelvic plexus within us.

00:13:32.801 --> 00:13:37.597
It is very important because it is very sensitive

00:13:39.072 --> 00:13:44.072
and also it is very delicate because
it is placed outside the spinal chord.

00:13:50.098 --> 00:13:55.630
This mechanism that is placed outside the spinal chord,

00:13:57.014 --> 00:14:00.147
down below there, is the most important Chakra

00:14:02.589 --> 00:14:09.230
and was created first. When the creation
started this was the first thing that was created

00:14:09.372 --> 00:14:14.612
and what does it emit holiness, innocence.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:22.548
It emits innocence. And the deity sitting on this,

00:14:24.872 --> 00:14:35.365
is the embodiment of innocence.
This deity was created in another dimension

00:14:37.032 --> 00:14:42.818
and He is – you have seen there – is Shri Ganesha.

00:14:43.046 --> 00:14:46.772
This is the image of Shri Ganesha that was created

00:14:47.147 --> 00:14:53.858
at that stage and what does it represent is
the stage between the animal and the man

00:14:54.086 --> 00:14:59.608
and the head is that of the animal showing
that an animal does not have any Ego,

00:14:59.711 --> 00:15:06.953
that the man is different from an animal,
that the animal is innocent.

00:15:07.249 --> 00:15:10.615
He doesn’t know what is sin, that’s why he is innocent.

00:15:10.752 --> 00:15:16.522
Because you know what is sin that’s why ‘you’ are

00:15:16.988 --> 00:15:21.783
innocent but you can become the fire of damnation.

00:15:22.412 --> 00:15:26.879
He is innocence but [only fire He’s seldom?]. (SM slightly laughs.)

00:15:27.002 --> 00:15:35.689
And He incarnates too on this earth.
He incarnated as Jesus Christ, Lord Jesus Christ.

00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:43.266
He took His form as Lord Jesus Christ and because He is innocent,

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:53.914
He’s made of that essence of divine nature of God

00:15:54.283 --> 00:15:59.204
that we call as Paramtattwa, the highest essence of God.

00:15:59.379 --> 00:16:02.787
And that’s why His body is also made out of that

00:16:02.969 --> 00:16:09.069
and that is the reason He could resurrect.

00:16:12.448 --> 00:16:18.761
By reading Bible which was written by disciples of Christ

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.839
how far can you go to understand Him?

00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:34.314
Because He was created beyond your thoughts, beyond your mind,

00:16:34.519 --> 00:16:42.462
in an unlimited Unconscious.

00:16:42.655 --> 00:16:51.181
And how can you with your limited mind understand Him or copy Him.

00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:56.879
It is said that even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh
cannot reach Him. He is so pure.

00:16:57.965 --> 00:17:03.860
He is purity. He is innocence

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:10.510
and He exists at that point

00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:18.734
and it is He at every point, every Chakra
He bestows upon you the blessings of His innocence.

00:17:18.882 --> 00:17:23.385
Innocence was the first thing created on this Earth.

00:17:23.703 --> 00:17:29.100
Before creating anything else it was innocence already there

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:35.442
and He bestows that innocence
by which you get your Self Realization.

00:17:36.179 --> 00:17:43.096
On the left hand side of this mechanism

00:17:43.481 --> 00:17:46.371
there are seven stratas.

00:17:46.655 --> 00:17:50.326
On the right hand side there are seven stratas,

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:56.017
down below there are seven stratas
and on top there are seven stratas.

00:17:56.358 --> 00:17:59.425
What are these stratas and what do they build?

00:18:00.065 --> 00:18:07.865
The left hand side chakras, the left hand side channel
which is called as Ida channel represents the subconscious,

00:18:08.103 --> 00:18:17.747
the subconscious mind within you. You listen to Me through
your conscious mind and put it back into the subconscious mind.

00:18:17.884 --> 00:18:21.100
All your experiences go into the subconscious.

00:18:21.248 --> 00:18:25.760
That is the limit of your subconscious of present here.

00:18:25.908 --> 00:18:33.481
Beyond that gouge is your subconscious of previous lives

00:18:33.584 --> 00:18:41.281
and beyond that gouge is the collective subconscious.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:55.973
When you listen to Me you have got a conscious mind which
receives it at this moment and there is a pre-conscious mind

00:18:56.166 --> 00:19:04.385
which takes it to the subconscious.
This pre-conscious mind is on the right hand side.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.795
This also has got seven stratas on this side.

00:19:10.023 --> 00:19:15.850
Just now the pre-conscious mind is the future

00:19:16.202 --> 00:19:20.019
that you are thinking about.

00:19:20.144 --> 00:19:29.373
Beyond that is the supra-conscious mind means
all the ideas about future you have had before,

00:19:29.691 --> 00:19:39.145
many lives before. Those ideas are there.
And beyond that is the collective supra-conscious.

00:19:39.723 --> 00:19:44.179
So, on the left hand side you have sub-conscious

00:19:44.683 --> 00:19:53.050
and the collective sub-conscious; on the right hand side:
supra-conscious and the collective supra-conscious.

00:19:53.368 --> 00:20:01.891
Down below are the seven stratas of Hell. H.E.L.L.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.235
Sometimes the words are so small that it doesn’t register.

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:12.584
If I say ‘Supra-conscious’, then people say,
“Ah! Mataji has said ‘sub-conscious’.” But ‘Hell’!

00:20:12.709 --> 00:20:20.441
And Hell is a truth. It exists within us.

00:20:22.073 --> 00:20:29.533
It is there. And there are seven stratas of that also.

00:20:31.835 --> 00:20:37.358
Conscious mind [on Sushumna Nadhi-Central Channel]
also has got seven stratas

00:20:37.495 --> 00:20:44.138
which are built in within us through
our different evolutionary processes.

00:20:44.324 --> 00:20:49.798
And these are the seven stratas
which are placed here of the conscious mind

00:20:49.935 --> 00:20:55.647
and then you go on top of the head into super-conscious mind

00:20:56.101 --> 00:21:07.291
which is the subtle mind – is the eternal mind –
the unconscious in which you have to move in seven stratas.

00:21:08.425 --> 00:21:14.358
You may say, “Shri Mataji it’s too much!” But it’s not.

00:21:15.398 --> 00:21:17.926
You are already built-in for that.

00:21:18.205 --> 00:21:22.448
For example if I tell this light, “You have to get enlightened

00:21:22.573 --> 00:21:28.156
and cover the whole hall”, it will say, “Oh! It’s too much.” No,
it is built like that.

00:21:28.315 --> 00:21:31.852
You have to just press the button. It opens and works

00:21:31.954 --> 00:21:39.312
because it is built that way, has been organized that way,
is placed that way that it works.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.102
When we face things that seem difficult we think we have to do it

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:51.338
and that’s why we are worried. You don’t have to worry:
it’s already done

00:21:51.565 --> 00:21:59.805
and it will be done also by the One who is organizing it.

00:22:00.021 --> 00:22:03.716
Only thing what we have to do is to witness.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.057
The One who has created this universe very well,

00:22:09.783 --> 00:22:15.620
the One who has created all the greenery

00:22:15.756 --> 00:22:22.774
then human being very well,

00:22:23.543 --> 00:22:26.705
He is the One who is going to do this for you

00:22:26.809 --> 00:22:33.942
and the time has come as Gavin has said it beautifully
that the blossom time has come and it will work out.

00:22:35.418 --> 00:22:39.727
But it’s surprising you know, human beings sometimes
I cannot understand.

00:22:39.841 --> 00:22:45.787
When I told that it is going to work out they said,
“How can it be? It has to be difficult.”

00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:56.443
Before even starting about it must you sit down with this idea
on your head : “Oh! It’s going to be very difficult.”

00:22:56.647 --> 00:23:04.493
I say it is the easiest and the simplest thing.
Being so important it cannot be difficult.

00:23:04.708 --> 00:23:09.674
Anything important like your breathing if it becomes
difficult and if you have to read about breathing,

00:23:09.753 --> 00:23:15.098
“How am I to breathe?” Now you go in books and see,
“Now, you have to do like this.”

00:23:15.189 --> 00:23:20.318
By the time you take the book, you are out.

00:23:20.636 --> 00:23:24.333
If you have to read about your Self Realization

00:23:24.458 --> 00:23:28.777
then God saves the Self Realization and God saves you.

00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:32.655
It’s your right that you are going to get your Self Realization.

00:23:32.757 --> 00:23:37.497
I’m not pampering your Ego. But that’s how you have been made.

00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:46.333
Even your Ego which you are condemning every morning
and evening was an essential part of this being.

00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:55.369
Only ‘you’ the human beings have evolved
the Ego to know something on their own.

00:23:57.261 --> 00:24:04.582
So this mechanism was made specially in such a manner

00:24:04.742 --> 00:24:13.335
that through your Ego and your Super Ego
you have become an ‘I’ personality.

00:24:13.687 --> 00:24:18.731
Like people say, “This is Mister Kumar. This is X, this is Y.”

00:24:19.616 --> 00:24:27.064
You become a separate identity from that big One personality

00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:32.846
of which you are just separate.
And the consciousness of that comes to you

00:24:33.096 --> 00:24:39.849
that you are a separate identity
and you have to see the oneness with that.

00:24:40.768 --> 00:24:43.301
And that is what is Self Realization.

00:24:45.212 --> 00:24:48.080
Nothing else!

00:24:49.001 --> 00:24:55.952
That you become that. Not what you do but is the becoming of it.

00:24:56.338 --> 00:24:59.659
Like you say a seed becomes a flower.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.733
It becomes a flower. You don’t – the seed doesn’t go
and read a book, “Oh! I know what it is.”

00:25:07.063 --> 00:25:10.219
Or it doesn’t listen to any lecture of Mataji or anything,

00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:15.865
it just becomes a flower. In the same way you have to become that

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:23.476
and not just to be brain washed or to be done something else
which I will tell you later how per misuse you can do

00:25:23.579 --> 00:25:27.410
in the name of Self Realization.

00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:32.852
So many of them are aware, it happened so. They know that.

00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:34.909
But what happens you can know.

00:25:35.034 --> 00:25:41.270
What is the mechanism? How it works out? Let us see the
positive side of it and then I will tell you the negative side.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:48.118
There is a Kundalini placed in that triangular
bone that you can see

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:53.352
pulsate. We have a doctor here he will say that, yes,

00:25:54.112 --> 00:25:58.320
he has seen it. You can see the pulsation of
the Kundalini very clearly.

00:25:58.468 --> 00:26:03.468
You can see the rising of the Kundalini
very clearly with your naked eyes.

00:26:04.001 --> 00:26:08.760
You can also feel it coming up. It comes. How it comes?

00:26:08.964 --> 00:26:16.606
How it works out is another detailed program
which I may be able to tell you later on

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:19.800
or I have already told quite a lot about it.

00:26:21.436 --> 00:26:24.780
This comes up – the Kundalini –

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:31.651
and pierces your fontanel bone. Pierces! What is this Kundalini?

00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:42.054
It is a residual force within you. Is awareness
which understands, thinks, loves and organizes, is an energy.

00:26:42.247 --> 00:26:49.288
Now we cannot think, human beings cannot think of
an energy that can think, love, organize.

00:26:49.447 --> 00:26:54.930
We cannot.
This is the energy that comes up you can see the pulsation.

00:26:55.203 --> 00:26:59.334
You can see the bringing of it with your naked eye.
That’s what you can bring here.

00:26:59.448 --> 00:27:05.262
It comes up and pierces your fontanel bone

00:27:06.282 --> 00:27:10.970
and you can feel the baptism that you become like a child

00:27:11.095 --> 00:27:16.831
because your fontanel bone becomes very soft.

00:27:17.081 --> 00:27:25.348
I mean, but that doesn’t mean that if you have a soft bone
here – that doesn’t mean that you are a Self realized person. No.

00:27:25.753 --> 00:27:29.728
When you enter not on left side or right hand side

00:27:29.839 --> 00:27:34.690
but when you enter onto the top,
onto the first strata of the super-consciousness,

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:45.131
then what happens? First thing that should happen
to you is that you become one with the collective being.

00:27:48.284 --> 00:27:54.843
“You become”, again I say. It is not lecturing,
“We are all brothers and sisters.

00:27:55.229 --> 00:28:04.628
There should be no racism.” All this is lecturing.
I’m not saying lecturing. It’s ‘become’. How?

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:13.671
When this thing enters through this into that subtle form

00:28:14.148 --> 00:28:20.682
you start feeling from your hands a cool breeze flowing.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.803
This is described in our scriptures.

00:28:24.015 --> 00:28:32.004
If you read even Christ has said, “Something passed out of My
body when somebody touched Me.” [Luke 8.46 transcriber’s note]

00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:39.123
But in our scriptures it’s given very, very clearly.
Here, in some of them, for example I would say Shankara .

00:28:39.362 --> 00:28:42.895
– Shankaracharya described that as Saundarya Lahari.

00:28:45.182 --> 00:28:49.280
He called it as Saundarya Lahari this force somewhere.

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:56.000
He called as vibrations. So many people are talking
of vibrations but they don’t know what they’re talking

00:28:56.212 --> 00:29:02.402
These vibrations that flow from your hand are cool vibrations

00:29:02.852 --> 00:29:09.016
and also they understand, they think and heal other people.

00:29:09.281 --> 00:29:16.661
When you put your hand towards another person
you start suddenly getting a burning here.

00:29:16.926 --> 00:29:23.576
Left hand side burning on this finger is
the Vishuddhi chakra, is this one.

00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:27.967
Now, if you know the deity who is there

00:29:28.124 --> 00:29:32.015
and if you take the name of
that particular deity who is sitting here …

00:29:32.121 --> 00:29:36.195
If you know and if you are a Realized soul then only.

00:29:36.328 --> 00:29:40.401
If you are not Realized you have no authority.

00:29:40.746 --> 00:29:49.317
You have no authority to take to any mantra
unless and until you are a Realized soul.

00:29:51.195 --> 00:29:54.310
Supposing I give you some mantra.

00:29:54.806 --> 00:29:59.528
You must know it is a misleading

00:30:01.513 --> 00:30:06.745
because whatever is said, whatever is the center in danger

00:30:06.924 --> 00:30:08.858
or in trouble,

00:30:09.057 --> 00:30:10.962
you must get that one.

00:30:11.061 --> 00:30:17.328
The one who is not a Realized soul cannot
make out what is the problem, where is the problem.

00:30:17.668 --> 00:30:20.426
And the one who is not Realized

00:30:20.526 --> 00:30:25.247
if he is given the mantra, his mantra has no authority.

00:30:25.411 --> 00:30:28.958
Like if I want to go and see the Queen

00:30:29.454 --> 00:30:32.985
I must take a permission. I must have some connection with her.

00:30:33.078 --> 00:30:38.739
I should be able to go and meet her. But if I go and meet
her straight and say, “Oh! Queen, come along.”

00:30:38.969 --> 00:30:42.663
The way we call God sometimes is most surprising.
You wouldn’t even call

00:30:42.705 --> 00:30:46.929
any servant like that the way we call Him,
“God, come along! Do this.

00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:51.408
This is my problem. What are you doing for me?”

00:30:52.956 --> 00:30:58.729
“I have faith in God” as if we have sort of
we are getting obligations.

00:30:58.889 --> 00:31:04.672
As if He is obliged to us,
“Oh! I have faith in God, Mother, then why did He miss it?”

00:31:04.871 --> 00:31:09.771
Who has faith? I mean, He exists.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:17.668
He’s an eternal being. If you have faith in that,
‘you’ are very false fine, not ‘He’. You cannot add to His Dom

00:31:17.887 --> 00:31:23.232
Any mantra is given to you just by any Dick, Tom and Harry.

00:31:23.539 --> 00:31:27.954
Anyone coming, “I’ll give you a mantra.”
I’m going to tell you about them later on.

00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:32.793
All those mantras that are said are for the deities,

00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:38.066
were done by these Gurus as I told you
in ancient times for very few people.

00:31:38.205 --> 00:31:43.034
They used to raise the Kundalini very gradually.

00:31:43.094 --> 00:31:47.934
They used to take it from that seat which is the Mooladhara
– not the Mooladhara chakra

00:31:47.994 --> 00:31:52.328
– from that triangular bone and they used to raise it one by one.

00:31:52.419 --> 00:31:55.699
For seven years it used to hang into one center

00:31:55.799 --> 00:31:58.873
then they would give one mantra, “All right, now, go and get it!

00:31:59.172 --> 00:32:02.842
Work it out! Cleanse it! Do it!” Then again another one.

00:32:03.239 --> 00:32:10.441
Then again another chakra. All right.
It has been done like that: very slow process.

00:32:10.705 --> 00:32:13.040
As in India, you see,

00:32:13.205 --> 00:32:18.536
they said that they have to go to Kashi or Benares.

00:32:18.735 --> 00:32:21.703
They used to sell out their houses, everything

00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:24.957
and they knew that they may never return.

00:32:25.037 --> 00:32:30.651
Or even if they go they might take so many years to reach Benares

00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:35.770
that by that time they will be absolutely old people
and they would not have energy to return.

00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:43.727
Now, if you have to go to Benares only thing what you can
do is to go from here to Delhi and take a plane and go direct.

00:32:43.985 --> 00:32:52.072
So ‘that’ time is over and Kundalini ‘now’

00:32:53.183 --> 00:32:55.762
can be worked out just like that

00:32:55.822 --> 00:32:59.373
because the time has come for you to become.

00:33:00.445 --> 00:33:04.979
There were never so many seekers in the world before
I can tell you.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:10.663
Only people who existed in the name of religion

00:33:10.763 --> 00:33:18.298
were orthodox, rabid, horrible people who crucified Christ,

00:33:18.894 --> 00:33:27.524
who killed Mohammad Sahib, who tortured Gnyaneshwara, who tortured

00:33:27.604 --> 00:33:32.683
Kabira, who tortured of all the things Shankaracharya,

00:33:33.537 --> 00:33:36.603
Buddha, Mahavira, Yuri [?], everyone of them.

00:33:36.751 --> 00:33:40.977
All these horrid people in the name of religion tortured.

00:33:41.116 --> 00:33:47.957
And today we have got this satanic thing

00:33:48.255 --> 00:33:52.223
coming out of that hell. They have suffered there,
you see, they were punished

00:33:52.283 --> 00:33:56.687
and after their punishment they are coming out.
It’s a double force.

00:33:57.064 --> 00:34:02.540
It’s a new subtler method of befooling you people.

00:34:03.533 --> 00:34:07.260
In Self Realization you get complete tranquility,

00:34:07.506 --> 00:34:15.779
the collective consciousness
and you can maneuver this power yourself.

00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:21.156
It is ‘your’ power that is manifested and nobody else.

00:34:22.665 --> 00:34:29.048
But as you have been to all these satanic people
– most of you have been, last time I saw it

00:34:29.624 --> 00:34:35.199
– and when I told them [that I tried?],
means I’m working very hard, you know it. I’m working very hard

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:40.735
but some of them have really spoiled their path of Sushumna,
the central path.

00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:48.256
So that is they have spoiled it that unless and until
they give up all that it’s not going to work out.

00:34:49.306 --> 00:34:53.531
If you are truly seeking I’m there to work for you.

00:34:53.928 --> 00:34:57.003
You don’t have to pay any money for it. No,

00:34:57.103 --> 00:35:05.951
never think of that because this is divine
and divine cannot be sold in the market.

00:35:08.015 --> 00:35:12.142
First thing that should come into your head as Christians specially

00:35:12.241 --> 00:35:16.689
that Christ has taken a hunter in his hand and hand it,
beating those people.

00:35:16.789 --> 00:35:22.205
That’s the only time He really lost his temper
on them when they were selling the religion.

00:35:22.285 --> 00:35:31.074
And today all of them are selling it
and you very, very humbly go and bow.

00:35:33.198 --> 00:35:39.807
All kinds of these beggars and parasites have come in
this country and all over the western countries.

00:35:40.241 --> 00:35:43.239
They are nothing but beggars take it from me.

00:35:44.411 --> 00:35:49.770
Worse than beggars they are the worst culprits.

00:35:50.008 --> 00:35:52.270
So, this is what Self Realization is

00:35:52.389 --> 00:35:56.794
and in Self Realization you get all the blessings of God,

00:35:56.893 --> 00:35:59.928
gradually you go into thoughtless awareness

00:36:00.039 --> 00:36:03.421
and then into doubtless awareness which we call Nirvikalpa

00:36:03.539 --> 00:36:06.627
and then into Self Realization completely.

00:36:06.714 --> 00:36:09.703
In that we have some people in India

00:36:09.872 --> 00:36:13.334
– they have met them – who are completely Self Realized

00:36:13.539 --> 00:36:17.421
and who, sitting down there, can work out
the Kundalini of other people.

00:36:17.541 --> 00:36:19.663
They are living in the family.

00:36:19.842 --> 00:36:21.446
They have got their children.

00:36:21.509 --> 00:36:24.581
They have got their grand-children. And they are working it out.

00:36:24.721 --> 00:36:26.865
You don’t have to run away from it.

00:36:26.945 --> 00:36:33.235
No extremes are needed, nothing.
It is ‘within you’ and ‘within you’ it is going to work out.

00:36:33.354 --> 00:36:39.068
These outside things and these extreme things are not needed.
Just be normal people.

00:36:39.108 --> 00:36:43.351
God has created this world for you to enjoy.

00:36:43.471 --> 00:36:48.669
It is for your enjoyment, you see,
these blessings that you have to feel through Self Realization.

00:36:48.753 --> 00:36:52.676
When the light of the Self flows in you see the joy pouring.

00:36:52.756 --> 00:36:57.423
You see it pouring from your head downwards
and you are just drenched.

00:36:57.756 --> 00:36:59.347
All your tensions go.

00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:00.974
All your problems go away.

00:37:01.039 --> 00:37:05.637
The Ego and Superego which he has shown here
as the black and the yellow,

00:37:05.697 --> 00:37:08.315
both of them open up

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:12.492
and you see they’re going down.

00:37:13.881 --> 00:37:22.244
It happens. There is an imbalance, there is a
– some sort of a – hurt in you.

00:37:22.542 --> 00:37:27.720
Sometimes I can say there could a very great wound into you,

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:34.049
could be there are some spies sitting in you,
could be that you are possessed

00:37:34.205 --> 00:37:38.159
without knowing that you are possessed.

00:37:39.271 --> 00:37:42.822
You don’t know how these people have maneuvered

00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:45.183
and I hope I will be able to tell you now

00:37:45.263 --> 00:37:48.794
how they have maneuvered and what sort of horrid people they are.

00:37:48.892 --> 00:37:52.108
I should take off my shoes perhaps.

00:37:59.172 --> 00:38:03.573
So, about these horrid people now.

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:11.835
In India since long,

00:38:12.609 --> 00:38:15.609
if you say the origin of so-called tantrism

00:38:15.704 --> 00:38:20.788
which is just the position of real tantra

00:38:20.967 --> 00:38:25.590
which is Sahaja Yoga, of the genuine tantra.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:35.406
If tantrism is to be considered
as a genuine stuff then it is Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:35.605 --> 00:38:38.400
But these tantrisms – these so-called

00:38:38.539 --> 00:38:42.467
– came into being in our country since long.

00:38:42.726 --> 00:38:50.681
Ancient times when these Gurus were
having those few disciples with them,

00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:54.722
three, four disciples were taken with great difficulties.

00:38:54.939 --> 00:38:57.499
But they were, after all, human beings.

00:38:57.622 --> 00:39:03.704
They used to be competition with them
and Guru would accept only one out of them

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.526
or two out of them, would take them a little ahead

00:39:08.685 --> 00:39:11.323
and would then leave them out saying that, “No.

00:39:11.542 --> 00:39:16.542
We cannot treat you anymore.
You cannot be helped. You’d better go away.”

00:39:17.197 --> 00:39:23.724
Such a useless, half-baked person would come down to the public

00:39:24.082 --> 00:39:30.023
and would start a method by which ‘he’ would put up a show against
[these fools?].

00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:37.622
This is the beginning I would say.
So he would now sit down and meditate.

00:39:38.436 --> 00:39:43.197
Still, you know, as a Mother, I don’t want to condemn all of them.

00:39:43.515 --> 00:39:45.829
I will give them a benefit of doubt

00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:54.857
and the benefit of doubt is this that when they were concentrating

00:39:54.976 --> 00:40:02.813
they tried to lift you into their Mooladhara chakra

00:40:03.171 --> 00:40:08.473
which you cannot enter in, which is below the Kundalini.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:12.451
This Mooladhara chakra controls the sex.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:15.367
Why? Because it is innocent.

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:20.963
It’s a child and the child as he doesn’t have

00:40:21.102 --> 00:40:32.104
sex that’s why it is not contaminated by it.
It is like a lotus coming out of the mud of sex.

00:40:32.799 --> 00:40:37.143
In that lotus sits Shri Ganesha.

00:40:37.362 --> 00:40:42.042
These people tried to peep into that

00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:45.772
thinking that through sex you might be able to see things

00:40:45.852 --> 00:40:51.486
and they might have seen – it is My own way of putting it

00:40:51.705 --> 00:40:57.319
– not seen completely but the trunk as you see.

00:40:57.538 --> 00:41:05.699
And they might have confused it
– still I say – that trunk to be the Kundalini.

00:41:06.195 --> 00:41:09.449
When I tried to understand human beings

00:41:09.687 --> 00:41:17.405
I thought it may have been because how could man be
just entering into hell directly with all that sex.

00:41:17.584 --> 00:41:25.421
It’s too much to Me. So by mistake maybe, that they saw this.
All right?

00:41:25.779 --> 00:41:29.426
So first the tantrikas came in.

00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:32.239
Tantrikas were the first.

00:41:32.372 --> 00:41:37.100
Then we have tantrikas
– basically I’m telling you- these evil geniuses are.

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:41.148
In the fact, you see, you cannot divide them

00:41:41.366 --> 00:41:47.894
into all geniuses but you can give
a basic broad outline about these tantrikas.

00:41:48.053 --> 00:41:51.862
Tantrikas are the people who use sex

00:41:52.021 --> 00:41:55.235
for so-called Self Realization.

00:41:55.315 --> 00:42:01.366
Mantrikas are the people
who use mantras for so-called Self Realization.

00:42:01.763 --> 00:42:08.727
Then there are [Jakanikas?] who use evil geniuses

00:42:08.847 --> 00:42:13.707
to be introduced as evil spirits into human beings

00:42:13.986 --> 00:42:21.763
– called as [Janganikas?].
Then Paishachikas are the people who used

00:42:22.299 --> 00:42:30.377
supraconscious devils into human beings.
They are over dynamic, overambitious sort of people.

00:42:30.755 --> 00:42:35.814
We have got Aghoris who taught them to put uh,

00:42:35.894 --> 00:42:41.588
say they can put a uh put a diamond into their hands.

00:42:41.707 --> 00:42:50.437
Aghoris. Then we have got [Behunt?]
[Behunt?] are the people who can

00:42:50.695 --> 00:42:54.622
do horrible uh, horrible gestures,

00:42:54.761 --> 00:42:58.670
you see, they can pull their stomach in, push it here,

00:42:58.809 --> 00:43:05.217
push it there, all sorts of things they do.
And we have also [Sexoyo?]. Minimum.

00:43:05.297 --> 00:43:08.186
I have categorized them as that

00:43:08.325 --> 00:43:15.150
but I don’t know how many sides of things there are
because when it comes to evil

00:43:15.329 --> 00:43:20.676
they come and prosper like viruses.

00:43:20.786 --> 00:43:25.934
Viruses they are. And they know how to hit you off.

00:43:26.173 --> 00:43:30.696
They themselves are destroying, they cannot see you constructing.

00:43:30.872 --> 00:43:40.909
They cannot see you evolve. That is one of
the basic reasons where they are out and oldies.

00:43:41.068 --> 00:43:46.088
So these tantrikas were started their jobs.

00:43:46.723 --> 00:43:56.462
In the Rama’s time, say about twelve hundred years back

00:43:56.701 --> 00:44:02.256
there was a Yajna, a kind of a ceremony known as Ashvamedha.

00:44:02.356 --> 00:44:09.148
It’s written in the books about that. Even that
– the books – the scriptures they ruined

00:44:09.228 --> 00:44:15.496
by saying that Ashvamedha was nothing else but was a sex act.

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:19.821
The Shakti and Shiva,

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.678
which is God who is innocent

00:44:22.758 --> 00:44:35.794
and His power the Shakti like light and the lamp or the sun
There also they introduced the symbol of sex.

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:43.052
This happened in the sixth century.

00:44:43.489 --> 00:44:49.759
It was at its heights tantrism in our country,
a complete bend. was taken.

00:44:49.978 --> 00:44:53.303
Say Satjakuna [?] It was to Khajuraho.

00:44:53.326 --> 00:44:57.333
So much so they were influence people

00:44:57.577 --> 00:45:04.511
that all other scriptures were thrown into the rivers
and tantrism became the scripture of the Hindus.

00:45:05.095 --> 00:45:10.491
Thank God, by organized religion at least
you would not allow people to tamper too much with Bible.

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:15.491
Thought it was but not so much. It could have been.

00:45:15.611 --> 00:45:25.353
There is so much freedom, that licentiousness to do whatever
you please with that scripture.

00:45:25.512 --> 00:45:30.392
To get … Can you imagine? From this scripture they started spoiling

00:45:30.512 --> 00:45:35.128
in the sixth century. Now what was the historical background for

00:45:35.188 --> 00:45:37.410
that? That was the best time,

00:45:37.529 --> 00:45:41.695
best breeding time of these horrible people.

00:45:41.795 --> 00:45:50.009
Because at that time, as you too have
very extreme type of orthodox people,

00:45:50.307 --> 00:45:55.071
Jainism, now we have a sect of people called as Jainism.

00:45:55.487 --> 00:45:59.137
Now, horrid. I mean, all of them are.

00:45:59.221 --> 00:46:04.099
But one of them
– horrid things I can tell you – that they believe in vegetarianism

00:46:04.476 --> 00:46:09.312
to such an extent! It’s horrid thing to tell you

00:46:09.392 --> 00:46:14.669
because – I’ve already told Gavin that for the first time
I’ll be shameless to tell you people –

00:46:14.789 --> 00:46:23.955
that they do not want to destroy
even the insects that are in the filth.

00:46:24.293 --> 00:46:26.074
To them an insect …
(tape interrupted)

00:46:26.197 --> 00:46:31.526
(…) so that lots of bugs can bite him

00:46:31.551 --> 00:46:35.717
and take out his blood and they pay him lot of money.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:39.164
Is a fact. Even today they do sometimes in the villages.

00:46:39.303 --> 00:46:45.431
They think it’s the greatest punya, is the greatest.
What you say ‘Tapoyajna’, means?

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:50.791
Punya is a good deed, you see, religious deed, Is to make a man

00:46:51.129 --> 00:47:01.069
get inside a hut and bugs must come and they take the blood.

00:47:01.744 --> 00:47:06.974
So these Jains – so-called vegetarians, horrid –

00:47:07.093 --> 00:47:12.493
they were the ministers you know.
Some way or other they became ministers. So.

00:47:12.689 --> 00:47:20.287
And the maharajas – you know the word ‘raja’ is for the King –
were the Hindus.

00:47:20.466 --> 00:47:24.202
And Hindus as usual are very indifferent to religion.

00:47:24.322 --> 00:47:28.428
Whatever one may say about it,
I agree it is a very great country and all that

00:47:28.488 --> 00:47:33.865
but Hindus these days are even worse because now,
they have all become English, you see.

00:47:33.945 --> 00:47:38.150
With English education all of them have become English.
Westernized.

00:47:38.214 --> 00:47:41.481
They don’t think we have anything in our country.

00:47:42.357 --> 00:47:47.573
So these – that time – great Rajas

00:47:47.891 --> 00:47:55.330
who are so indifferent to religion, to their sustaining power,
to understand what is in their scriptures, licentious

00:47:55.569 --> 00:48:01.652
and permissive like your Roman kings, horribly Rajas,

00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:10.382
once they used to put their money to some sort of
an arrangement for all the licentious people around,

00:48:11.117 --> 00:48:19.370
so they thought of a very genius method, you see:
build the temple of God

00:48:20.085 --> 00:48:27.017
and make all kinds of erotic pictures in the temple.

00:48:27.303 --> 00:48:33.446
Can you believe that thing? In the name of art.

00:48:33.546 --> 00:48:40.430
If art is pure as people say, why do you need this vulgarity?

00:48:42.197 --> 00:48:47.611
Horrible erotic things were created through big competitions.

00:48:47.831 --> 00:48:50.726
Now you are having competitions in this country but that time

00:48:50.806 --> 00:48:54.714
– of course now you are also becoming tantrikas
as far as erotic things are concerned

00:48:54.814 --> 00:48:56.711
– one better than the other.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:00.798
And they were given special prices, even jagirs
– as they call the lands –

00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:04.814
were given to those people – it’s written in the history –

00:49:04.886 --> 00:49:10.486
for creating those pictures. Despite that, you see,
despite all that provocations

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:13.953
and despite all that temptations,

00:49:14.067 --> 00:49:18.588
you’ll be amazed, the konaraka, that art is departed.

00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:23.608
There has been another thing, a simple thing is,
“Not. We’re ‘not’ going to do it.

00:49:23.668 --> 00:49:25.964
On a temple we are ‘not’ doing it.”

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:31.103
So these clever intelligent people, you see, they told them that,

00:49:31.222 --> 00:49:36.242
“If you do this, it will be good because all the dirt
that is here should be placed there”,

00:49:36.322 --> 00:49:39.436
you see, “and inside should be clean.

00:49:39.556 --> 00:49:42.452
Outside we must accept to God that we are like this.”

00:49:42.591 --> 00:49:46.194
This is a concession. See the brain,

00:49:47.444 --> 00:49:53.844
“This is a concession you must make what all dirty things
you are doing you put them out there.”

00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:00.797
This was the – this was the historical side here.

00:50:01.075 --> 00:50:06.142
And that time these tantrikas were,
you see, absolutely horrid they came.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:12.369
You have only one Soho. We have Sohos
and Sohos and Sohos in that great country.

00:50:12.687 --> 00:50:16.964
You won’t believe when you see those things, you know,

00:50:17.143 --> 00:50:20.675
foreigners are surprised that in India
such erotic things are there.

00:50:20.774 --> 00:50:29.306
Wherever there is religion, wherever there is a saint,
these satanic have to reach there to destroy all that is pure.

00:50:29.485 --> 00:50:34.551
That is their style, their “happiness”.
This is a crucifixion of the purity.

00:50:36.132 --> 00:50:39.428
And such temples were created

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:44.269
and those tantrikas then came forward.

00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:53.517
They brought about all their women there for konaraka. If
you go there is the Chausath Bhavani Mandir, they call it

00:50:53.558 --> 00:50:57.291
“the sixty-four goddesses”. Imagine Goddesses’ temple!

00:50:57.466 --> 00:51:01.752
Now what do they do? Now what is the principle behind all that,

00:51:01.881 --> 00:51:06.081
you must know. It is a very secretive principle that they use.

00:51:06.871 --> 00:51:13.918
They establish the picture of a Goddess
or create a statue of a Goddess in a chapel

00:51:14.017 --> 00:51:20.426
and before the Goddess they do nirvicara,
means sex act of sixteen varieties of different types.

00:51:20.486 --> 00:51:25.406
Horrible! In the beginning Shri Ganesha gets angry.

00:51:25.525 --> 00:51:31.299
They get all kinds of blisters all around. They – they say
that Kundalini is angry. Kundalini, why will She be angry?

00:51:31.383 --> 00:51:38.447
It is Shri Ganesha who is angry, but in such a temper
from the right and the left and they get all blisters.

00:51:38.625 --> 00:51:42.663
They start dancing, jumping, they behave like frogs,

00:51:42.742 --> 00:51:49.270
they have horrid things. They get blasted in the head,

00:51:49.381 --> 00:51:53.585
they get headaches, everything they get.
But still they are adamant

00:51:53.665 --> 00:51:58.228
because it is said that, “You have to go further.
It’s a terrible task,

00:51:58.328 --> 00:52:02.554
it’s a difficult task. These are your
Karmas that are coming to torture you.

00:52:02.634 --> 00:52:08.634
You have to take out your Karmas.
Through your sex you do better Karmas or bad Karmas.”

00:52:08.765 --> 00:52:11.581
So they go on poor people.

00:52:12.336 --> 00:52:18.680
Then, by that, beyond that what happens is deities slip off.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:24.057
They go away from there. The area is built-in.

00:52:24.156 --> 00:52:30.525
The realm of God from there disappears
as light disappears in the darkness.

00:52:30.724 --> 00:52:33.938
They work in the night. They’ll never work in the daytime.

00:52:34.047 --> 00:52:38.501
In the night they work and then they call the spirits.

00:52:38.819 --> 00:52:44.306
You can call them. Last time I told you what happens to
you when you die and how the spirits are there

00:52:44.365 --> 00:52:48.234
and what are the horrible spirits
that are hanging around us to enter into you.

00:52:48.314 --> 00:52:52.500
So I will not go into the details of that but later on
I’ll tell you all about it.

00:52:52.586 --> 00:52:56.349
I’ll tell you each and everything. You note it down.

00:52:56.588 --> 00:52:59.345
So they start, they call the spirits.

00:52:59.505 --> 00:53:08.386
When they call the spirits – spirits have the lust in them,
greed, they’re greedy, you see, really dissatisfied –

00:53:08.486 --> 00:53:12.952
and they maneuver them. They can give them the name of say ‘Rama’,

00:53:13.347 --> 00:53:18.148
then ‘Aim’, ‘Hrim’, ‘Klim’, all sorts of names
they can give to these spirits,

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:21.541
these evil geniuses manage them.

00:53:23.307 --> 00:53:27.850
And then they put these spirits on the king,

00:53:27.954 --> 00:53:33.727
onto his big ministers. And these
people are captured and possessed.

00:53:33.821 --> 00:53:35.731
And they say, “We are very erotic.

00:53:35.811 --> 00:53:42.944
We are running after – we used to run after only two women,
now we are running after hundred women.” Mad!

00:53:43.330 --> 00:53:46.328
They lose all their sense of Self.

00:53:46.468 --> 00:53:49.868
They have no understanding of what they are doing.

00:53:50.019 --> 00:53:54.205
Like mad they do. Even some saints can be affected

00:53:54.305 --> 00:53:56.639
but they get reactions physically.

00:53:56.984 --> 00:54:01.184
Saints if they indulge into it immediately they get reactions.

00:54:01.381 --> 00:54:04.381
They get reactions in the head, in the body.

00:54:04.547 --> 00:54:10.014
And the reactions could be very strong on them.
Sometimes they vomit too much.

00:54:10.466 --> 00:54:15.763
So ‘these’ people start putting those horrible

00:54:16.041 --> 00:54:19.612
sexes on you, capturing you, taking out your being.

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:23.042
In India there was a tantrika like that

00:54:23.142 --> 00:54:26.653
who amassed lot of money but his wife [has pushed?] him throughout

00:54:26.733 --> 00:54:31.466
and he built that horrible temple of that Konaraka
[Temple near Puri].

00:54:34.551 --> 00:54:38.791
If he had not put any erotic’s there
it would have been a beautiful temple

00:54:38.871 --> 00:54:42.264
but with that erotic you feel like vomiting
all the time when you go.

00:54:42.383 --> 00:54:47.206
I mean, if you are healthy, you just can’t bear to see
those kinds of bathroom, the way it is done.

00:54:47.286 --> 00:54:55.083
Tomorrow they will ask us to watch
these people sitting down there for the morning ablutions!

00:54:55.838 --> 00:55:02.345
Filth and filth and filth! The whole place is nothing but filth.

00:55:03.655 --> 00:55:10.083
And then his own son defied him, this horrible tantrika.

00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:13.781
This tantrika was killed in a very funny manner

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.361
which is worth reading how he was killed.

00:55:16.579 --> 00:55:19.684
And the son came down and he completed that temple
[In legends the architect’s son committed suicide jumping from the top of the temple.]

00:55:19.754 --> 00:55:23.315
but he told the King that, “Your kingdom will disappear.”

00:55:23.454 --> 00:55:28.829
All these – all these kings disappeared once for all.
They had no children,

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:36.943
they had nothing and they became just shamble
and all of their temples were covered

00:55:37.110 --> 00:55:41.053
with stones, earth and they were just mounts.

00:55:41.133 --> 00:55:44.208
Later on the English came there

00:55:44.381 --> 00:55:46.906
and some of them excavated and found out.

00:55:46.986 --> 00:55:51.450
They found it artistic, I don’t know how
they found it but it was there.

00:55:51.570 --> 00:55:57.799
But in Konaraka you will find the whole thing is so vulgar,

00:55:58.157 --> 00:56:03.834
so horrid, where the artists – poor things – had nothing to say.

00:56:04.648 --> 00:56:08.537
And I met the artists of that place who are living around.

00:56:08.656 --> 00:56:14.172
They said, “We are paying through our drones
all these days for what our forefathers have done

00:56:14.748 --> 00:56:17.763
and we don’t want to see that.”

00:56:18.498 --> 00:56:25.908
Even today in India an unmarried man and
an unmarried woman will never go to see a konaraka.

00:56:26.761 --> 00:56:30.895
Now the only explanation they have is this, you’ll be amazed,

00:56:31.007 --> 00:56:36.813
that after marriage Indian women are so innocent as that
they’re married quite young, they don’t understand what is sex,

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:41.793
so teach them how what is sex. It is made for the marriage

00:56:41.972 --> 00:56:44.432
and only the husband and wife should go there.

00:56:44.532 --> 00:56:49.998
This is the only explanation our Indian
artists could find out to give for that.

00:56:51.047 --> 00:56:52.406
But we have to accept.

00:56:52.505 --> 00:56:56.652
You see, in every country there could be a satanic force working.

00:56:56.751 --> 00:57:00.951
Why should we identify ourselves with those horrible tantrikas

00:57:02.267 --> 00:57:04.801
and why should we be ashamed of that?

00:57:07.505 --> 00:57:12.068
In Khajuraho the other tantric place you will find

00:57:12.168 --> 00:57:17.842
there are some places where you find eroticas.

00:57:18.001 --> 00:57:26.612
But if you are alert and if you watch,
these are kept in corners somewhere

00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:33.703
while the gods and goddesses have
big form, back, very great attachment, such a thing.

00:57:33.823 --> 00:57:40.509
So it never comes to your notice unless and until you are
taken to it and shown out that this is an erotica.

00:57:40.648 --> 00:57:48.470
But surprisingly most of the foreigners are specially
Japanese bringing their camera from this angle, from this angle.

00:57:48.704 --> 00:57:51.526
Why don’t they take their own photographs like that?

00:57:51.705 --> 00:57:55.078
What is there to go all the way
to Konaraka to take those photographs?

00:57:55.197 --> 00:57:57.816
Shows your search!

00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:00.712
Shows what you are asking for!

00:58:00.891 --> 00:58:04.688
The way from here people take all the way those big – big – cameras

00:58:04.808 --> 00:58:09.767
and go round. They take photographs like various angles they look.

00:58:10.046 --> 00:58:13.676
What is there to take photographs? In that what is there to gain?

00:58:13.756 --> 00:58:19.156
Sex, animals know, everybody knows, dog knows.
What is there to teach about sex?

00:58:20.661 --> 00:58:25.194
You have done so much of mentally that now there will be impotency.

00:58:25.381 --> 00:58:31.275
And in there, you know that, in America,
the highest number impotent are there

00:58:31.414 --> 00:58:36.614
because of this kind of perversion and ruining
your innocence within yourself.

00:58:37.783 --> 00:58:39.668
Beware of it!

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:51.652
This so-called freedom is nothing but abandonment of
your sustenance of your Dharma that is within you. Is built-in.

00:58:53.061 --> 00:58:57.878
It is there. It exists. You cannot from,

00:58:58.712 --> 00:59:06.886
“Thou shall not commit adultery.” Christ has said, “Not only
adultery but I will say, ‘Thou shall not have adulterous eyes’.”

00:59:06.985 --> 00:59:09.525
And you see people, all the time they…

00:59:09.605 --> 00:59:13.057
And they say, “We are intelligent.” What did happen?

00:59:13.156 --> 00:59:16.767
Where are you looking?
Where are you seeing? Where is your attention?

00:59:16.906 --> 00:59:19.961
This human attention built up ages.

00:59:22.065 --> 00:59:27.932
So much has been worked out. You have been
brought from that level to this level today.

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:34.957
Where are you getting? Into gutters, into filth, into dirt.

00:59:35.295 --> 00:59:48.214
Rise! And see your glory. Have your self-respect.
As a Mother, I tell you that.

00:59:49.008 --> 00:59:51.753
And these horrible tantrikas and mantrikas

00:59:51.845 --> 00:59:58.400
who are teaching you all kinds of things like putting a mandala
– the other day somebody told Me – and putting your sex there.

00:59:58.519 --> 01:00:01.079
What is a mandala? Do you know is the aura of God?

01:00:01.178 --> 01:00:03.519
You are showing your sex to God!

01:00:03.658 --> 01:00:07.507
Have some brains at least if nothing else.

01:00:08.023 --> 01:00:14.604
It’s the greatest shameful thing you are doing
if you show your sex part to God.

01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:21.469
Are you all lunatics? Can’t you understand? It’s a ceremony!

01:00:24.941 --> 01:00:26.807
I get upset with those

01:00:27.105 --> 01:00:31.529
because you don’t know. You will lose
all your chances of Realization.

01:00:31.714 --> 01:00:37.663
Your seeking is going to be lost completely, believe Me.

01:00:38.946 --> 01:00:44.151
Stand in your own glory. Why should you run after women?
Why should you run after men?

01:00:44.251 --> 01:00:48.933
If you are a glorious person, stand in your own image.

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:53.064
That’s the best way you are going to be a human being.

01:00:53.854 --> 01:01:00.203
This kind of licentiousness and permissiveness is
going to completely finish that chakra in the Nabhi.

01:01:00.287 --> 01:01:07.287
If you see that one has got ten petals which are
built so carefully, delicately, beautifully, with love.

01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:14.161
Do not confuse love with licentious behavior.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.820
It is ‘not’.

01:01:18.881 --> 01:01:20.947
It’s sanctified love.

01:01:21.253 --> 01:01:25.460
I don’t say you become sanyasin, not at all,
I’m against that also, another extreme.

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:29.706
Then I’m going to tell you about sexo-yogis, the third time.

01:01:30.381 --> 01:01:37.596
The sexo-yogis start as a people who are
suppressing their sex. They do not marry. (Tape interruption)

01:01:42.437 --> 01:01:44.001
They use

01:01:44.026 --> 01:01:46.405
– they use the skull of a lady.

01:01:46.422 --> 01:01:52.173
They need skulls for that.
To be in the subconscious you have to have a skull.

01:01:52.385 --> 01:01:58.264
So they kill people, take out their skulls and keep it with them.

01:01:58.622 --> 01:02:02.530
Some people are coming, please open door.

01:02:02.908 --> 01:02:07.094
So the – they keep those skulls with them

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:11.346
and those skulls they use it for drinking water,

01:02:11.744 --> 01:02:15.890
for eating food, all the time these skulls are there.

01:02:16.228 --> 01:02:25.077
Now there is a very good story written by a great writer in
India, Bankim Chandra [Chattopadhyay], is known as Kapal Kundala.

01:02:25.334 --> 01:02:32.080
This girl, there was a girl whom a Kapali [Mahadji?],

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.396
he used to make her nude, he used to make her dance,

01:02:36.476 --> 01:02:41.614
he used to make her go in the see
and used to control his sex sitting before her.

01:02:41.793 --> 01:02:47.586
And there are several also, very sexual acts he would control also.

01:02:48.023 --> 01:02:52.606
He went on like that and ultimately he wants to kill that girl.

01:02:52.785 --> 01:03:00.557
That is the height of complete abstinence
because you kill the person whom you were supposed to have.

01:03:00.736 --> 01:03:05.854
Just imagine, what perversion! What brain! What habits!

01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:14.998
I mean there’s no limit to this. God has not given you freedom
to break your head and to say that, “Oh, bull come and hit me!”

01:03:15.438 --> 01:03:22.858
And this girl was preserved and then someway
or other she ran away and she got married to a man.

01:03:23.037 --> 01:03:26.237
He visited her, brought her back and killed her.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:33.688
These are the Kapali.

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:35.791
If you don’t listen to them,

01:03:35.816 --> 01:03:38.703
they will take you to the smashana that is the burial ground,

01:03:38.728 --> 01:03:42.768
cut your head, take out your skull and keep it.

01:03:42.874 --> 01:03:46.483
They will see to it that you go to the subconscious strata

01:03:46.684 --> 01:03:49.137
and they handle you better there.

01:03:49.162 --> 01:03:55.173
They would like to die through their stamina.

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:56.840
They do it.

01:03:57.237 --> 01:04:02.561
So many of them are doing like that. Even today, you have no idea.

01:04:02.654 --> 01:04:05.849
And people are so much enamored,

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.977
so much under the obsession of these things are,

01:04:09.077 --> 01:04:13.401
that even if you tell them that your gurus are
doing like this and they have found out,

01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:16.034
still they will be there to kill you.

01:04:16.378 --> 01:04:21.178
Absolutely rabid people. They are possessed,
brain-washed completely.

01:04:21.815 --> 01:04:24.632
And if some people should be saved, to say…

01:04:24.751 --> 01:04:34.116
I always say that if a sari keeps flying out,
even if you could hold a little bit of it, we can save this sari.

01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:39.775
The sanity must come to you to understand
that these horrible methods

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:43.341
are not going to give you Self Realization.

01:04:44.137 --> 01:04:46.870
You must know what is Self Realization.

01:04:47.014 --> 01:04:50.505
Now some people think that flying in the air,

01:04:50.704 --> 01:04:53.873
jumping somewhere is something great.

01:04:55.644 --> 01:05:00.644
Which incarnation did? Did you hear any incarnation
[Delete ‘who walked’],

01:05:00.819 --> 01:05:06.612
who sat like this and was floating in the air?

01:05:07.148 --> 01:05:12.565
Which incarnation did that and what are you going to
do with floating in the air? You are going to

01:05:12.962 --> 01:05:14.787
create a problem on the traffic.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:22.833
These nonsensical things why should you do?

01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:26.919
There is in Puna [Shivapur],
they say there is one saint who died, you see,

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:28.449
and there is a stone,

01:05:29.242 --> 01:05:33.025
if there ten people take the name of the saint, it can come up.

01:05:33.172 --> 01:05:35.644
And you can put a finger, it can come up.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:42.212
I said, “With that what God should do?” Think of it!

01:05:42.649 --> 01:05:44.533
And when I went there I found out

01:05:44.712 --> 01:05:50.763
that there was a big spirit sitting there and he said, “I’m going
to sit down here Mother. I’m not going to do [other thing?].”

01:05:50.903 --> 01:05:54.198
And the spirit of that horrible fellow
is all the time sitting there.

01:05:54.316 --> 01:05:55.726
He doesn’t want anything.

01:05:55.806 --> 01:06:01.939
He just want to meet good people and sit down there
and listen everybody’s taking his name,

01:06:02.148 --> 01:06:06.930
calling him a saint. When he is not a saint why should
we accept that he is a saint

01:06:07.048 --> 01:06:12.848
and be happy with it? Because human beings can do anything.
They have given that power.

01:06:14.311 --> 01:06:17.065
And moreover God is powerless before you

01:06:17.152 --> 01:06:20.914
because He cannot take away your freedom to be idiots

01:06:20.974 --> 01:06:25.894
or to be foolish or to be self-destroying. He cannot do it.

01:06:25.954 --> 01:06:32.491
He can only weep and cry, beg on you,
“Please don’t do it, please don’t do it”, but He cannot stop it.

01:06:32.839 --> 01:06:39.205
That’s the only problem. And that’s why all of them have taken you.

01:06:39.337 --> 01:06:43.689
They have all come from somewhere like spiders.
At least I know fifteen of them.

01:06:43.848 --> 01:06:49.715
And three horrible women. They’re all there making money,
making money, befooling you.

01:06:53.295 --> 01:07:00.299
Why do you need a guru for telling you a mantra?
Any Dick, Tom, Harry can tell you.

01:07:00.577 --> 01:07:05.081
You must see the result, the proof.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:11.250
What’s happening out of it.
You must think. You are intelligent people.

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:17.900
You understand everything, why don’t you understand this,
“I’m possessed.”

01:07:18.357 --> 01:07:22.206
Are you under the complete obsession of such people?

01:07:22.306 --> 01:07:26.641
Or perhaps you have paid them so much money that you think,
“Oh how we have paid so much now what,

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.506
we should see through the whole thing.”

01:07:28.685 --> 01:07:33.010
Like in the drama you go and you don’t like the drama, still
when you have paid the money, then stand.

01:07:33.248 --> 01:07:36.541
It’s not that casual.

01:07:36.621 --> 01:07:42.196
It’s a very serious thing. You are going into the den of devils,

01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:47.765
finishing your Kundalini completely. Now there are
at least twenty-five people among you who will say that.

01:07:47.865 --> 01:07:53.221
It has happened to them. I’ve been correcting them.
I’m doing it. They get it back.

01:07:53.698 --> 01:07:59.031
I only feel sorry for one thing,
that you have been genuine about your seeking.

01:07:59.293 --> 01:08:04.878
You have been genuinely seeking and
I can assure you that I went to America in 1970

01:08:04.978 --> 01:08:11.644
to warn on you but that time they were,
all of them had become something special type of possessed.

01:08:12.974 --> 01:08:18.846
They would not listen to Me. I told Ravi Shankar. He said,
“Mother you just don’t go near them. They will eat you out.”

01:08:19.045 --> 01:08:25.017
That out to have experiences of torn fulsome drugs.

01:08:26.208 --> 01:08:29.969
In India how many people have seen the drugs
– ask them, anyone of them ?

01:08:30.049 --> 01:08:35.383
Ha! Do they even know what is the difference
between bhang and this and that?

01:08:39.137 --> 01:08:42.937
These drugs and all these things were used by tantrikas.

01:08:43.164 --> 01:08:46.631
And they are out here. They have brought out that.

01:08:47.549 --> 01:08:51.834
Things that go against your awareness
whether drugs, alcohol, anything

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:56.927
is ‘not’ going to give you that higher awareness about
which I’m saying.

01:08:58.359 --> 01:09:05.938
Don’t waste your life. It’s very precious.
The most precious and the greatest time has come.

01:09:07.347 --> 01:09:12.287
Please respect yourself. And please understand your value.

01:09:12.644 --> 01:09:17.069
What you have learned before, find it out and do not waste it.

01:09:17.367 --> 01:09:21.493
You have already wasted lot of your time.

01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:27.495
Means all these – I told you the seven stratas –

01:09:27.753 --> 01:09:32.589
on the left and right have names which I think that time

01:09:32.749 --> 01:09:37.431
I have no time to tell you but there are
names and names and names for everything.

01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:41.466
Hakini, Rakini, Lakini, Shakini,
like that on the left hand side they have got.

01:09:41.558 --> 01:09:45.084
This side is Gayatri and Savitri and all that sorts of things.

01:09:45.203 --> 01:09:54.278
It goes on both the sides.
All these are nothing but like resonances.

01:09:54.557 --> 01:09:57.019
They throw you from one to another strata.

01:09:57.178 --> 01:09:59.350
You are sort of tested in every strata

01:09:59.450 --> 01:10:04.866
and when they found you are a gone case you go ‘direct’ into hell.

01:10:05.105 --> 01:10:07.525
These are all achieved!

01:10:14.212 --> 01:10:18.041
So I have to make a very simple

01:10:18.656 --> 01:10:23.077
statement that keep your Self, respect your Self.

01:10:23.514 --> 01:10:29.961
Try. If it works with you, well and good. I’m here to work out the

01:10:30.121 --> 01:10:35.973
raising of the Kundalini, the bringing it out of it.
You yourself would be able to do after some time

01:10:36.212 --> 01:10:39.945
but cleansing is needed and it should never be given up

01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:42.600
because there is no way out.

01:10:45.319 --> 01:10:47.836
Nanak – Guru Nanak –

01:10:48.293 --> 01:10:56.259
he has written at least three-four chapters against these
tantrikas and mantrikas and these paishakshikas and these jains.

01:10:56.656 --> 01:11:03.084
In India it’s an abuse to say – I mean I have first time used
these words for that on my tongue –

01:11:03.361 --> 01:11:08.362
is an abuse to call somebody like this.
If you say that to someone they will take you to the court.

01:11:08.561 --> 01:11:11.514
They are kept outside like lepers.

01:11:15.364 --> 01:11:23.291
Kabira has written books after books. These khecharis
and this and that he lashed them left and right,

01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:25.315
He was a great poet.

01:11:25.424 --> 01:11:28.211
Everybody fought with him, tortured him.

01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:29.918
Christ was the same.

01:11:30.236 --> 01:11:33.926
He is the one who said not to go towards spirits at all.

01:11:34.091 --> 01:11:35.824
This is all spirit’s job.

01:11:37.081 --> 01:11:42.014
But you go in London every fifth house is
a spiritualist sitting there,

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:45.116
“Free hypnotics!”

01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:51.739
Why do you want to get hypnotized? Why do you want to get

01:11:51.879 --> 01:11:56.342
E.S.P – what they call – Extra Sensory Perception?

01:11:57.077 --> 01:12:03.823
All these so-called geniuses also,
these prodigies are also possessed.

01:12:04.398 --> 01:12:06.379
I’ve seen many prodigies.

01:12:06.462 --> 01:12:10.923
One of them came to Me. I told,
“All right, in My presence you calculate.”

01:12:11.043 --> 01:12:14.197
She could not calculate even in one

01:12:14.495 --> 01:12:20.546
because I put a bandhan to her possession. I said, “You get out!”

01:12:20.904 --> 01:12:25.116
I’ve had many such experiences which I can tell you.
Last time I’ve told you

01:12:25.258 --> 01:12:30.771
how people who are possessed came to Me and how they leave.

01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:39.382
Now there is still time and we can
move into Self Realization experience.

01:12:39.482 --> 01:12:43.211
It will – it might take to some people in five minutes
but to some more.

01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:47.939
In any case you must have patience. And don’t be angry with you.

01:12:48.113 --> 01:12:53.335
Because when Gavin said Ego – I was fired when he said –
because if it is not Ego then the Superego comes,

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:59.895
“We are the worst people, we are the horrible people.
We…” you see, from one extreme to another.

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:06.880
You have to stand in-between. You are glorious.

01:13:07.336 --> 01:13:11.890
You are not an aggressor neither
you are taking aggression from anyone.

01:13:12.029 --> 01:13:17.544
You stand within your Self and through
that you have your own powers.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:22.281
You don’t have to depend on anyone, nothing. You just are.

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:25.317
But you have to depend on the deities that are within you,

01:13:25.424 --> 01:13:29.424
which I’m going to see. There has been a problem.
They have to be corrected

01:13:29.524 --> 01:13:33.254
and you have to know where are the deities, where are they.

01:13:33.373 --> 01:13:38.426
In the Sahaja Yoga – modern Sahaja Yoga I may call it –
there is no mantra given.

01:13:38.593 --> 01:13:43.466
No. Because every second the Kundalini is going like that.
Now there are people who’ll say,

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:47.077
“This I can tell you, this I can tell you.”
It is here they saw that.

01:13:47.157 --> 01:13:53.109
You must have seen she came to Me, She tells Me that,
“Mother I’ve caught that.” All right, finished. Agnya catching.

01:13:53.268 --> 01:13:58.161
So nobody is given a mantra but you know where is the catch.
You yourself say.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.787
She herself came and told Me, “I’ve got it caught on Agnya.”

01:14:01.926 --> 01:14:06.330
And you know what’s the extreme Agnya catching means,
you know: paranoia.

01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:12.310
But she doesn’t mind telling Me because she sees herself
away from herself and she told Me, “I’ve got an Agnya clearly.”

01:14:12.567 --> 01:14:15.872
All of them say, “The Agnya is there.
I can see those coming inside me.”

01:14:16.011 --> 01:14:22.578
He told Me that, “I can see these entities now coming into me.”
And I throw them away and they have a nice – a nice program.

01:14:22.757 --> 01:14:27.836
If you all talk to them, they will tell you their experiences.
Some of them went into trance; I had to take them out.

01:14:27.956 --> 01:14:31.725
So many things happen now. People just like you came to Me
and gained.

01:14:31.864 --> 01:14:36.331
And you’ll also gain but be sensible about it, be wise. Be wise.

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:43.894
You have to expect gains and nothing else.
Nothing else you can found.

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:45.976
So, may God bless you.

01:14:46.176 --> 01:14:49.390
You can go into a little meditation

01:14:49.521 --> 01:14:52.064
just by putting your hands towards Me
