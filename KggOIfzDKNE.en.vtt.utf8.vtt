00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:10.394
I am so very filled with joy

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:20.130
 and My heart is so full of gratitude for

00:00:20.717 --> 00:00:25.844
all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:30.023
to create this beautiful place.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:39.377
 I cannot imagine how much they must have worked hard

00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:48.551
 in such a place to create such  a beautiful

00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:56.537
 area, such a blissful place.

00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:12.205
How in Sahaja Yoga people work together

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:18.395
 with tremendous respect and love for each other,

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:24.584
and produce something that is unbelievable.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.142
This was just a wilderness,

00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:35.495
and you have brought so much of

00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:40.002
life and light in this place.

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:52.510
 You wanted to celebrate My birthday.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.938
 I don't know what is such a significant about it.

00:02:00.804 --> 00:02:06.756
 But the way you have really

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.132
 shown your understanding and respect,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.763
I am just enamored.  I can't  understand

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:19.684
 what have I done for you, that

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:23.081
you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:32.140
 As it is, today is also a very auspicious day

00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:35.605
 which we call as the Holi.

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:42.388
They play Holion this day and show their love

00:02:43.245 --> 00:02:46.751
 and oneness among themselves.

00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:50.963
This is the time when we have to

00:02:51.892 --> 00:02:56.209
really understand the value of love,

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.505
of respect of others,

00:03:02.402 --> 00:03:08.781
 because so far we have based all our theories and

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:15.145
 all our ideas on the principle that human beings

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:22.755
cannot love each other: they are always trying to overpower others

00:03:23.023 --> 00:03:27.443
 or to hate others, or to grab things from others.

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:32.064
Such a wrong idea we had all these days,

00:03:32.307 --> 00:03:36.318
 and that's why all the organizations that were created

00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:40.088
to obstruct it also got contaminated with it.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.523
The only way one can really understand

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:55.341
what we are is by knowing yourself.

00:03:55.896 --> 00:04:00.329
When you know yourself you are surprised that

00:04:00.957 --> 00:04:05.938
what is the greatest thing for you is to love and to be loved.

00:04:06.688 --> 00:04:10.586
 You enjoy that collective love so much

00:04:10.872 --> 00:04:16.823
 when you are absolutely overcome

00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:24.043
 your baser self. In Sahaja Yoga it is so simple.

00:04:24.394 --> 00:04:26.731
It works in a very simple manner.

00:04:26.991 --> 00:04:34.920
 It's very Sahaja, but to grow into it is very important,

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:39.292
and I am so very happy to see so many of you

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.923
 from all over the world, from Delhi and also from all over India,

00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:48.811
 enjoying that love among yourselves

00:04:48.963 --> 00:04:52.335
and understanding among yourselves.

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.183
I never expected that in My lifetime

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.205
I'll be able to see all this beautiful

00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:05.856
world of love, trust and peace.

00:05:06.325 --> 00:05:10.523
 But today really I must say it shows

00:05:10.832 --> 00:05:14.821
 what we are capable of doing.

00:05:15.528 --> 00:05:23.501
 We human beings, so-called, are very selfish, self-centered

00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:27.548
and only worried about ourselves:

00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:32.657
that is what is said; but it's surprising

00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:37.329
 that with Self-Realization, with self-knowledge,

00:05:37.663 --> 00:05:42.808
 with knowing yourself, you understand how rich you are within,

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:47.647
 how great you are within and how capable you are.

00:05:48.282 --> 00:05:50.890
 This understanding comes to you,

00:05:51.136 --> 00:05:55.887
 and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner.

00:05:57.538 --> 00:06:02.497
Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly,

00:06:03.434 --> 00:06:09.726
 and that you all have slowly and slowly grown also.

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:16.233
 But today I must say that it has reached such a height

00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:22.273
that it's difficult for people to get out of it.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.857
 When you know yourself, when you know what is reality

00:06:28.136 --> 00:06:30.497
and what is absolute truth,

00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:34.966
you just get dissolved into that knowledge.

00:06:35.387 --> 00:06:42.615
 Of course you are not knowledgeable in the way people are;

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:47.351
you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word,

00:06:47.742 --> 00:06:54.742
because you realize what is within you is a big power of love.

00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:58.694
There's a big power of understanding.

00:07:01.741 --> 00:07:04.438
 There's a big power of understanding,

00:07:05.256 --> 00:07:09.295
 a big power of oneness, of collective.

00:07:09.805 --> 00:07:13.160
This collectivity works wonders

00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:17.239
and gives such joy that we are all one,

00:07:17.584 --> 00:07:22.722
 we have no enemies, we have no problems.

00:07:23.063 --> 00:07:26.935
 We are all one together.

00:07:56.135 --> 00:08:01.501
 This joy that was expressed by you

00:08:03.488 --> 00:08:10.432
 is like the waves that go to the shores,

00:08:11.202 --> 00:08:15.907
touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns.

00:08:16.217 --> 00:08:18.758
And I see that happening now,

00:08:19.117 --> 00:08:24.677
that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.060
 in your lifestyle, in your behavior.

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:34.323
There is a very special type of human race is sitting before Me.

00:08:34.887 --> 00:08:44.403
 I am so much thankful to you, absolutely,

00:08:45.093 --> 00:08:53.669
that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself

00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:57.243
and enjoy it with others.

00:08:57.507 --> 00:09:03.337
 It's something remarkable that you know about yourself,

00:09:03.925 --> 00:09:06.813
that's only human beings can do.

00:09:07.084 --> 00:09:10.290
 There can be a diamond, very expensive,

00:09:10.544 --> 00:09:12.795
 but it doesn't know its value.

00:09:12.978 --> 00:09:17.447
There could be some dog or some animal

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:20.809
which must be something par excellence,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.730
but he doesn't know what he is.

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:27.614
Same thing happens with the human beings

00:09:28.093 --> 00:09:30.542
till they get their Self-Realization,

00:09:30.764 --> 00:09:37.809
 and after Realization they suddenly become aware of what they are.

00:09:38.825 --> 00:09:44.680
 And then suddenly they become very humble, they become very loving.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.707
Now supposing if somebody knows that he is a king,

00:09:48.906 --> 00:09:54.773
 or he discovers that he is a some great musician or a

00:09:55.066 --> 00:10:00.985
 prime minister or something: he feels very aloof

00:10:01.216 --> 00:10:04.639
and he thinks no end of himself.

00:10:05.523 --> 00:10:08.567
 But by this knowledge that you have,

00:10:08.742 --> 00:10:13.927
 you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoy it.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.868
 It's very remarkable how it works out

00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:21.530
 that you enjoy each other so much,

00:10:21.858 --> 00:10:26.544
and to do something for this collective work,

00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:30.682
you can dedicate yourself to it.

00:10:31.902 --> 00:10:37.499
Now My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say,

00:10:37.889 --> 00:10:42.029
 has been really checkered with all kinds of incidents,

00:10:42.155 --> 00:10:46.737
all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents.

00:10:47.402 --> 00:10:52.255
And it's a good vision to see

00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:56.149
 before your eyes that despite all that,

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.681
so many beautiful lotuses have come out,

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:05.674
 and they are so fragrant, so beautiful,

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:08.889
 so colorful, so attractive.

00:11:09.971 --> 00:11:17.479
 All this is because we have a innate  value system,

00:11:19.404 --> 00:11:23.085
 because we have inborn within us a great

00:11:23.426 --> 00:11:30.797
 sense of love and compassion.

00:11:31.552 --> 00:11:36.470
 This compassion has to be really

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:43.904
understood and enjoyed, and jump in the ocean of compassion.

00:11:44.547 --> 00:11:48.164
So beautiful, and you'll be amazed to see

00:11:48.482 --> 00:11:51.338
 that automatically you'll swim,

00:11:51.664 --> 00:11:56.632
automatically you'll meet other people also in the same ocean,

00:11:56.985 --> 00:12:00.797
 and without any problems, without any troubles,

00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:07.856
 all enjoying the bliss of this love,
 this compassion, this Divine love.

00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:14.917
 I must really congratulate

00:12:15.163 --> 00:12:20.369
 the Delhi people for coming up so well

00:12:21.336 --> 00:12:27.235
with this beautiful arrangement  and this beautiful pendal,

00:12:27.808 --> 00:12:33.180
and all the beautiful arrangements
they have made outside for your stay.

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:36.077
 I mean really it's something,

00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:41.381
 I have done nothing for it, nothing, I should say.

00:12:41.944 --> 00:12:45.222
How these people have worked together:

00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:48.611
 there have been no quarrels, fighting,

00:12:48.778 --> 00:12:52.700
 backbiting, nothing of the kind. It's very surprising

00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:56.788
 that such a beautiful thing has been created by them:

00:12:57.114 --> 00:13:00.953
 shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:01.939 --> 00:13:04.777
 I must congratulate them again and again

00:13:05.063 --> 00:13:07.578
for doing this great work

00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:10.617
in such a short time.

00:13:11.572 --> 00:13:14.163
First I talked in English because

00:13:14.188 --> 00:13:16.887
here many people have come from foreign countries

00:13:17.038 --> 00:13:19.348
and you don't have any objection

00:13:19.373 --> 00:13:22.142
that I talk in English for a little while.

00:13:22.311 --> 00:13:26.883
Although it is a great thing of Dehlites

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:32.438
and along with them the people of Uttarpradesh also joined.

00:13:32.974 --> 00:13:40.120
People of Rajasthan also joined and the people from Haryana also helped.

00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:44.238
All of them have collectively made with love this

00:13:44.263 --> 00:13:47.726
very beautiful pandal like a temple.

00:13:48.124 --> 00:13:53.525
On seeing it I was Myself surprised

00:13:54.219 --> 00:13:57.810
that here are such talented artists.

00:13:57.835 --> 00:13:59.768
I didn't know.

00:13:59.793 --> 00:14:02.433
Wherefrom this art came?

00:14:02.458 --> 00:14:08.232
How did they make it and decorate all this, I can't understand.

00:14:08.257 --> 00:14:14.716
I didn't know that there are artists of such caliber in our country

00:14:15.248 --> 00:14:17.434
and that too caliber of love.

00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:21.873
The power of 'love' and the art of 'love'

00:14:22.566 --> 00:14:25.633
the art of loving everybody

00:14:25.658 --> 00:14:30.605
whosoever will get it, he only can do such an artistic composition.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.617
One should learn this art

00:14:33.642 --> 00:14:41.472
how can we with the help of our speech, mind and wisdom

00:14:41.497 --> 00:14:46.283
become artists, artists of 'love'

00:14:46.308 --> 00:14:51.011
and how can we give comfort to others

00:14:51.036 --> 00:14:53.874
and joy to others.

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:58.664
Which lovable talk is such that we can do.

00:14:58.689 --> 00:15:00.964
One it is with the help of speech

00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:05.577
then with wisdom how can we think?

00:15:05.602 --> 00:15:10.184
How can we shower our love among people?

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:17.324
How can we open our heart in front of others

00:15:17.349 --> 00:15:20.990
and establish them in our heart?

00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:28.316
And we should think that the heart which doesn't have love

00:15:28.776 --> 00:15:32.494
he is not an authority of anything in the world.

00:15:33.104 --> 00:15:39.197
Because whatever he gets, he cannot be contented in any way with that

00:15:39.222 --> 00:15:41.622
he cannot get contentment.

00:15:41.741 --> 00:15:47.903
But when there is an ocean of contentment within you

00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:52.872
what is it that cannot content you?

00:15:52.897 --> 00:16:00.087
When it happens within you and you get the solution

00:16:00.304 --> 00:16:08.251
then, nobody can understand the boundries of that solution

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.295
that nobody can understand this business.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:17.053
Such melodious and such beautiful all that happens

00:16:17.078 --> 00:16:19.254
you cannot overlook it.

00:16:19.717 --> 00:16:24.983
Can't understand what i am doing and what others are doing

00:16:25.008 --> 00:16:27.833
what they are saying and what i am saying.

00:16:27.858 --> 00:16:33.552
And how are they covering me with their love

00:16:33.647 --> 00:16:41.322
and how shall we shower them with our love.

00:16:41.347 --> 00:16:43.933
Day and night the same worry goes on

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.566
that today whom I have to meet

00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:50.512
and what loving things should I tell them.

00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:54.395
What useful things should be talked about.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:59.462
Because the practice of talking about useless things

00:16:59.778 --> 00:17:01.058
leads only to loss.

00:17:01.264 --> 00:17:02.958
It has never been useful

00:17:03.268 --> 00:17:08.248
and more than that the anger that is there in a human being

00:17:08.273 --> 00:17:11.410
leads to all the more complications.

00:17:12.088 --> 00:17:17.052
There was no need to teach you not to do violence

00:17:17.077 --> 00:17:21.254
don't treat anyone badly

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:23.807
don't destroy anyone

00:17:23.911 --> 00:17:25.676
don't grab somebody's money.

00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:27.585
There is no need to teach all this.

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.314
You became so dignified on your own.

00:17:31.751 --> 00:17:35.618
I said now you too have become lotuses

00:17:35.643 --> 00:17:38.968
that you know to give only your fragrance

00:17:39.398 --> 00:17:41.009
and don't know anything else.

00:17:41.034 --> 00:17:44.715
And the joy of giving to others

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:51.192
and to feel its joy is a strange experience.

00:17:51.248 --> 00:17:55.331
Only people of unique character can do it.

00:17:55.356 --> 00:17:59.531
Now you are the masters of it

00:17:59.556 --> 00:18:05.269
and the heritage that we had kept with you

00:18:05.532 --> 00:18:08.511
you have utilized fully.

00:18:08.536 --> 00:18:10.931
Now that thing is open to everyone

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.122
it didn't harm anyone.

00:18:12.147 --> 00:18:14.666
Now it is a matter of enjoyment.

00:18:15.569 --> 00:18:20.046
Many people in the world are of different types

00:18:20.071 --> 00:18:22.747
but they cannot touch you

00:18:23.067 --> 00:18:25.563
cannot bother you.

00:18:25.588 --> 00:18:30.889
Even if there can be something, that too may be absorbed by you.

00:18:30.914 --> 00:18:32.489
let them join you.

00:18:32.688 --> 00:18:35.058
Watching your lifestyle

00:18:35.083 --> 00:18:41.273
let them have atleast the inclination to change their life.

00:18:41.528 --> 00:18:43.217
Let us also change.

00:18:43.242 --> 00:18:44.662
I don't say that

00:18:44.687 --> 00:18:48.947
I have signed the contract of changing this whole world

00:18:49.352 --> 00:18:52.743
but you can sign this contract.

00:18:52.768 --> 00:18:55.419
If you will change this world

00:18:55.444 --> 00:19:01.369
If you invite moral, kind and gentle people

00:19:01.457 --> 00:19:07.571
there is no need to do anything more.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.196
then you go on looking at it.

00:19:11.221 --> 00:19:16.771
The only important thing is that you get attatched to it

00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:22.200
Get engaged into it and find out how many people can we transform?

00:19:22.225 --> 00:19:27.014
I agree that an ordinary man has got a number of flaws.

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:32.006
A man full of flaws you can

00:19:32.031 --> 00:19:40.017
very beautifully give knowledge of a good and unknown self

00:19:40.042 --> 00:19:42.096
the self within us.

00:19:42.121 --> 00:19:48.280
When you come into contact with the spirit inside us

00:19:49.597 --> 00:19:53.561
you come to know that others too must do so.

00:19:53.586 --> 00:19:54.935
know yourself all the more.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.456
They are lost.

00:19:56.481 --> 00:20:01.430
They don't know how much prime wealth they have inside them.

00:20:01.513 --> 00:20:03.897
So, they must be given it

00:20:03.922 --> 00:20:06.794
and they must get it.

00:20:06.819 --> 00:20:10.303
When such conversations will start taking place

00:20:10.328 --> 00:20:13.341
you will take its responsibility on your ownself

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.186
that we too should give others this prime wealth.

00:20:18.211 --> 00:20:20.945
Their keys are with you

00:20:21.132 --> 00:20:28.284
and if you somehow give this great contribution

00:20:28.309 --> 00:20:32.620
just watch how they will recognize you

00:20:32.645 --> 00:20:36.733
and how they will be greatful to you.

00:20:37.225 --> 00:20:39.975
The greatest work for you now is that

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.541
you bring as many people as you can to Sahaja state

00:20:45.234 --> 00:20:46.849
and give them this wealth

00:20:46.874 --> 00:20:51.466
and when this will happen

00:20:51.491 --> 00:20:54.152
you will yourself get busy and be happy

00:20:54.183 --> 00:21:01.524
and a type of joy which cannot be described

00:21:01.708 --> 00:21:02.708
you will get.

00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:05.021
This has to be done.

00:21:05.046 --> 00:21:08.526
Today you have celebrated My Birthday.

00:21:08.551 --> 00:21:13.958
I should say a lot of thanks for that

00:21:13.983 --> 00:21:16.982
and you have done all this joyfully

00:21:17.244 --> 00:21:24.127
but for Me it is so that every year Sahajyoga has been spreading

00:21:24.358 --> 00:21:29.292
and even I too cannot understand its boundries.

00:21:29.515 --> 00:21:33.479
But today you too must take a decision

00:21:33.504 --> 00:21:41.901
that on the birthday of Mother we will try to transform others.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:45.730
Our transformation has already been done but must do of others as well.

00:21:46.278 --> 00:21:51.970
This only  will give you complete contentment of this joy.

00:21:51.995 --> 00:21:54.595
Till now the joy you have is limited

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.069
when you will distribute it among others

00:21:57.094 --> 00:21:59.798
and when it will be echoed in others

00:21:59.934 --> 00:22:07.080
when you will come to know about it, understand it

00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:15.656
a great new joy will awaken within yourself.

00:22:15.681 --> 00:22:24.924
I was watching your young boys, children dancing joyfully.

00:22:25.675 --> 00:22:31.099
Krishna got celebrated Holi so that everybody get joy.

00:22:31.124 --> 00:22:37.015
Shri Ram's style made a human being very serious type.

00:22:37.039 --> 00:22:39.480
His life became serious.

00:22:39.505 --> 00:22:42.655
He (Shri Krishna) devised a method so that a human being

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.664
 cound open up himself and play mirthfully.

00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:50.052
Now that thing only Sahajyogis can do practically

00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:54.889
can play Holi with love amongst themselves.

00:22:54.914 --> 00:22:58.333
Not to trouble others

00:22:58.358 --> 00:23:04.748
but to express their own joy and to make feel others joyous as well.

00:23:05.725 --> 00:23:07.946
Eternal blessings to everyone.
