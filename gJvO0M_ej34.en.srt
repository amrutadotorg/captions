1
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:05,291
And so there are many

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,709
hunters who are trying to find out this castori, this musk,

3
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:13,458
and they are looking

4
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:19,667
they are looking for the deer.

5
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:25,000
So please keep your deer, that is the innocence, you see.

6
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:28,834
The children’s innocence is now attacked, under attack,

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,792
and there is such an attack coming on innocence

8
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:35,250
that you have to care, be careful about your own children.

9
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:38,333
Harane means those deer,

10
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:40,041
because deer is a small thing,

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,166
so be careful about those deer, look after them.

12
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:47,375
The full term is keep them clear, keep them safe.

13
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,625
A time may come when we will feel our own breathing

14
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,542
as something stranger

15
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,750
as if they are not our own, stranger,

16
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:06,208
that’s why keep your hands into each other

17
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,959
because it is very dark.

18
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,000
Very nice message for all the Sahaja Yogis.

19
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:14,166
And this is what one has to understand

20
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:20,750
that you must try to understand your leader.

21
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:25,917
I wanted to talk to the collectivity here today

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,208
about

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,750
what has happened in Switzerland, also

24
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:36,000
that, you see, we had Arneau here,

25
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:40,125
and Arneau became a very right-sided and this and that.

26
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:42,750
So as a result of that,

27
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:46,959
Swiss people have become the other way round, I think.

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,999
And it's a kind of a feeling

29
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,667
that as Arneau was,

30
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:59,166
there's a pressure I think, on the new leader

31
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:01,417
who is a very good man and he is very good.

32
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:05,750
So if you pressurize, then nothing will work out.

33
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,792
So please remember that you have to listen to your leaders,

34
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,083
till I do something about it.

35
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,166
Even about Arneau, I stood by him out and out,

36
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,417
and when he was wrong we removed him.

37
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,333
So nobody should challenge the leader,

38
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:25,125
otherwise there cannot be any one of My authorities -

39
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,125
nothing can flow.

40
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:32,125
It's like stopping completely the flow of Kundalini.

41
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,417
So don't challenge your leaders.

42
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:38,667
I find that there is a big, I find here very clearly,

43
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:42,333
the Agnya is rising in people. People are developing Agnyas,

44
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:45,583
and that is coming only because

45
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:49,875
one thinks, "Oh, that was Arneau. He did like this...

46
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,500
and now Mathias.

47
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:54,500
So Mathias must be also like that, for he is authority."

48
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,625
That's not the way. You have to accept his authority.

49
00:02:57,834 --> 00:03:00,041
If you don't accept his authority, your Agnya will be caught up

50
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,291
and you will become very right-sided people.

51
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:05,166
Be extremely careful. I am noticing

52
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:08,041
that the Agnya in Switzerland is quite high

53
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,083
and I must tell you, warn you, that be sensible.

54
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:18,417
My whole energy flows through your leader, till he stops it.

55
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:21,417
So I am in charge there to look after that point.

56
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:25,583
Now you people have to learn to surrender yourself.

57
00:03:25,834 --> 00:03:28,834
Otherwise your ego will go up very much

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,333
and you will all, I am sure, if you go on like this,

59
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:36,333
one by one become very egoistical.

60
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,999
Now, how ego comes so much to the West,

61
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:41,999
I have studied it and I have found out the reason for this

62
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:45,417
why these people in the West are so ego-oriented.

63
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,875
What is the reason?

64
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:49,291
The reason is like this:

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,999
a child till the age of five years is ego-oriented.

66
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,458
He plays with his own, you give them toys

67
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:58,625
they will all have their own toys, they will play with them

68
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:01,333
and they will not trouble each other.

69
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,417
But if they trouble each other,

70
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:09,041
then they become violent or they could be quite brutal also.

71
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,625
They are always living in a parallel way.

72
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,041
You do your job; I do my job. If you leave them,

73
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,834
"This is mine. This is mine," they'll all play alone.

74
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,792
And they are at that time absolutely ego-oriented.

75
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,875
If you ask a child,

76
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,250
"You are standing there, now what do you see?"

77
00:04:24,458 --> 00:04:27,999
so he'll see this chair, he'll see Me, he'll see this and that.

78
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:32,417
From there, if you ask, he won't say that he sees something else -

79
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:36,125
he will say same as he sees here - he is standing this side,

80
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:40,166
but he will never see the point of another person.

81
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:44,500
That's the child. Say, for example, there is a wall here,

82
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,125
the child is standing here and there is something in between.

83
00:04:48,417 --> 00:04:52,208
So you ask the child, "What will you see from the other side?"

84
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,959
He will say the same thing from where he is standing.

85
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,917
He won't be able to say what the other person is seeing.

86
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,709
So that is this ego-orientation, is very strong.

87
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,999
And because you people, I must say this is a very,

88
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:11,041
I think, a statement I have to make very clearly

89
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,041
that in your culture whatever is -

90
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,834
so today's culture of these countries, today's I am saying -

91
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,333
is that it just develops your ego.

92
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:23,417
Parents are very happy if you are busy with yourself.

93
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,500
They don't want to take up any responsibility,

94
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,500
they don't want to correct you, they don't want to tell you,

95
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:29,291
"Don't do this, don't do that,"

96
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,166
and whichever way the children are going, they are going.

97
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,250
They don't want to worry. Even,

98
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,458
what I have noticed in the ashrams also, if somebody corrects the child,

99
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,291
they have a big objection.

100
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,333
They are very sensitive about their children, and this is very bad

101
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:46,917
because this will make the children extremely ego-oriented.

102
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,291
And in the West I have seen

103
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,959
people are extremely sensitive about their children.

104
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,208
Nobody dare say anything to them. But the other way round,

105
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:57,999
I must say that Indian culture has still kept very sensible ways.

106
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,208
That's why their society is the best in the whole world.

107
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,959
Their economics is horrible, their politics is worst,

108
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,542
you can call them absolutely useless for many things,

109
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,166
but on society level, they are the best.

110
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:13,458
The reason is that the women have taken over the responsibility

111
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:15,375
of looking after the society.

112
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,750
Now I'll tell you we were quite grown up,

113
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,417
I was in college, my sisters were also in college.

114
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,333
One day we were coming by, walking down,

115
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,792
and we were just, there was some joke so they all started laughing,

116
00:06:25,999 --> 00:06:27,375
there were some friends also.

117
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,458
And one lady was going by car - my mother's friend.

118
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:32,333
So she went and told my mother that

119
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,083
"I saw your daughters with other friends

120
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,583
and they were laughing on the street."

121
00:06:35,792 --> 00:06:38,999
As soon as we went she shouted,

122
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:42,000
"How dare you?"

123
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:45,917
We got a fright, and we didn't know this lady was coming from that side.

124
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:50,500
She said, "How dare you? How could you do?" - at that age.

125
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,041
And anyone of her friends could scold us, anybody.

126
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,375
Can say anything to us, "Don't do like this.

127
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,917
Why are you doing like this?"

128
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,208
So this ego breaks.

129
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:02,083
But if you do not allow others to correct your children,

130
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,959
their ego will never break, and that is the reason why

131
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,625
in these countries - Western countries - people are so ego-oriented.

132
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,125
They have not grown out of it.

133
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:12,750
They have not grown out of it.

134
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,542
First of all, they never want to be corrected, never.

135
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,667
Even at this age, if My mother was living she would have corrected Me.

136
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,291
And I would never have felt bad -

137
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,291
anybody, anyone of our friends or anybody - because I know

138
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,834
that it's for My benevolence why are they doing it.

139
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,875
But a kind of a, you see,

140
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:37,000
thing that happened here, that Arneau went too much on one side.

141
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:39,625
He got possessed, went too much,

142
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,458
and this is also by some other people also.

143
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:46,542
Also Patrick is having the same problem there,

144
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:50,333
and everybody is having the same problem in every ashram.

145
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,000
Now it is not that you should dominate your children or anything,

146
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,583
but if they are doing wrong, immediately the person

147
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,875
who sees he's doing wrong can correct it.

148
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,375
There should not be that,

149
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,667
"This is my child. How dare you say like that?" or feel bad about it.

150
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:11,917
Once you start developing that kind of "my children, mine,"

151
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,792
children then become absolutely ego-oriented,

152
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,542
and you'll never allow them to grow out of it.

153
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,792
They can never see what is the other's point of view.

154
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,375
Now say, for example,

155
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,417
we learnt it through, not only through our mother, father,

156
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:29,583
but through everybody else. They said, "You should not do like this."

157
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,166
So many things we know - little, little things.

158
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:36,166
Like these girls told Me - not these but from another ashram,

159
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,583
not in Switzerland

160
00:08:37,834 --> 00:08:39,792
- that, "Look at them. They come from the heat

161
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,333
and just take the water, drink it."

162
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:45,709
In India nobody would do. How, how do we know?

163
00:08:45,917 --> 00:08:48,291
Because if anybody sees us doing that, he'll say,

164
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,750
"No, you should eat something, take some carbohydrate, then drink water.

165
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:55,083
Why did you take it?"

166
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,041
And nobody will object.

167
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,375
So the whole society is training the children.

168
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:04,083
Nobody has any objection.

169
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,750
Guido had a problem also, same way.

170
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,750
He tried to correct the children, the parents used to comment -

171
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,959
In India nobody dare say anything to the teacher.

172
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:18,709
That's why the teachers are respected. If teacher said so, all right.

173
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:21,083
They have no respect for their teachers. They have no respect -

174
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,542
after all, they don't even have respect for their parents.

175
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,458
because they discover that we are ego-oriented.

176
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,208
Here, the way children talk to their parents, the way they behave,

177
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,750
they have no respect for anyone,

178
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,834
and then they have no respect for themselves.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,542
They become absolutely shameless people.

180
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,750
So, to make your children grow properly,

181
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,333
allow them to get into collectivity completely.

182
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:49,458
I mean, now My husband's family, we have got hundred people at least.

183
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,333
When we come together for any marriage, festival or anything,

184
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:58,500
we are at least minimum hundred people living under one roof, one kitchen.

185
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:02,583
And everybody knows how far to go. Nobody feels bad.

186
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,750
I mean they, of course, love children also,

187
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:06,542
they do everything for them -

188
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,625
but if it is to be corrected, it is to be corrected,

189
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,625
and nobody feels bad.

190
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,625
And this is why the children get attached too much,

191
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:18,875
and it's impossible to penetrate into their ego shell.

192
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,542
It goes on, you see, growing, growing, growing.

193
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,208
And even if they get realization later on,

194
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:26,583
even if they feel, the ego is still there

195
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,375
because it's already bloated out by the parents,

196
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,917
parents have already put that ego into their heads

197
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,625
that, "You are something special."

198
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,875
And this is how it is. I mean, the other day,

199
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,458
I mean, my younger daughter - she is quite big and all that -

200
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:47,959
she was in there

201
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,667
and she started scolding her daughter.

202
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:53,709
So Worliker came and said,

203
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:57,041
"Please don't scold. I will not listen anymore of this."

204
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:01,583
She just kept quiet. She didn't feel bad about it.

205
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:07,583
She didn't feel bad because, you see, we Indians understand this.

206
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:12,500
Anybody can correct us, and we take it as good thing.

207
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:15,125
Thank God there is somebody to correct us.

208
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:19,208
Otherwise we will be hanging from the trees.

209
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,709
Like Avdhut once asked Me when he was small,

210
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,291
he said, "Supposing we leave our parents,

211
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:28,667
then the bhoots go away - what parents have - their bhoots go away?"

212
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,417
I said, "No, they will go with you."

213
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,291
So he said, "Then why do these people leave their parents?

214
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,750
Because supposing I go away from my parents

215
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:40,792
and tomorrow I feel like smoking, who will correct me?

216
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:44,667
There is nobody to correct me if my parents are not with me."

217
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,959
I mean, that is regarded as something, a great blessing

218
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,417
that you have parents, your elders, to correct you,

219
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,999
to tell you something. And when my daughters got married,

220
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,959
we were big people - I mean, we were not young or anything,

221
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:04,333
CP was the Chairman of Shipping Corporation and all that -

222
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:08,041
his sister, she is about eight, nine years older,

223
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,250
she said, "For this marriage you have to paint your nails."

224
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,542
Now imagine CP painting his nails.

225
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:17,208
He did paint. He painted,

226
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,208
and then he had to wear dhoti ten times. He had to do this,

227
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:23,083
he was quite (inaudible).

228
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,917
We went to another marriage in the, something.

229
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,500
He said, "Look at them. They are also wearing suits and everything."

230
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:32,458
I said, "Thank God we have, you have a sister."

231
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:37,125
Somebody who will tell you what is to be done.

232
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:43,417
This obedience you must learn. Unless and until you learn obedience and

233
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:47,542
anybody corrects your child, don't say anything. Just don't say anything.

234
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:50,083
Let your child be handled by everyone.

235
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,667
Otherwise it's going to be very bad for them also.

236
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,500
Though they are born-realized,

237
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,750
you are not giving them the right training, no.

238
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:04,583
"My children" should be dropped out immediately.

239
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:09,041
They are children of everyone.

240
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:15,250
Now Anand came and stayed with him. Ask him what sort of a boy he was.

241
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,583
[Sahaja Yogi: A gem.]

242
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,208
Gem of a person. If, if he tells him, "Anand, don't do like this,"

243
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,250
he will never feel bad, never.

244
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,792
We feel it's a blessing there is somebody to tell us.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,500
And then this is what I find later on that ego is like a balloon.

246
00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:38,333
If the balloon, if you do not blow at all- it is not blown out,

247
00:13:38,542 --> 00:13:39,792
then it's difficult to blow it.

248
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:43,792
That's why those who have not developed this ego are very easy.

249
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,500
That's why Indians don't get into this ego trip easily.

250
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,667
Their balloon is never allowed to grow.

251
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:53,250
But those who are in the West, they are nothing but ego.

252
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,750
You do something, you know, balloon starts.

253
00:13:58,208 --> 00:14:01,417
Then we had one (inaudible) with us,

254
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,500
and whenever he got into the car,

255
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,834
he used to become very funny, you know, very bumptious.

256
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,417
So I asked somebody, "Why is he so bumptious?"

257
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:11,999
He said, "Mother because he is driving Mercedes."

258
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,583
I said, "What? Mercedes?

259
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,999
This is neither his nor Mine . Why should he be proud of it?"

260
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,208
I mean, something stupid.

261
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,417
So an ego makes you stupid.

262
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:30,999
That's the main thing: it makes you completely stupid.

263
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,583
And there is a big story about it in Ramayana.

264
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,917
how a person can become stupid.

265
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,500
And that's why you people are stupefied very easily.

266
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,583
Recently somebody told Me, "Mother, the new fashions have started

267
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,625
that they take, all the ladies take their hair like this

268
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:50,959
on their forehead." I said, "Really?"

269
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,417
She said, "Yes, you see, Mother."

270
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,834
I saw all the Sahaja Yoginis having their hair made like that.

271
00:14:57,041 --> 00:15:00,667
Yesterday also in the program all of them having hair like this.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,417
I mean, they have no personality.

273
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:05,333
Anybody starts anything, they'll do it.

274
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:09,125
They have no individuality.

275
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,834
They do not have any traditional basis.

276
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,834
"No, this is modern dress. I am not going to wear something like this.

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,625
This is how I dress up,

278
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:23,083
this is how I live. Why, why should I do it?"

279
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,792
Now, tomorrow they'll say that you have a bouffant.

280
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:28,041
So everybody going with a bouffant.

281
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:30,917
They will say men should have, women should have put no oil.

282
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:34,542
So they will become bald-headed, - finished.

283
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,875
But, you see, about twenty years back every man

284
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:40,083
you see in the films used to put the hair,

285
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,166
oil in the hair, properly comb it,

286
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,083
and used to be a smart fellow.

287
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,417
Nowadays, everybody is so casually dressed

288
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,583
there's nothing smartness about them.

289
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:53,875
If you become casual, you'll also in life will be casual.

290
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:58,250
To wear some sort of a casual thing, some sort of a baggy pant

291
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,250
or a tight pant or this and that,

292
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,417
this is because there is no personality.

293
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:08,875
Is only ego. There is no personality; there's no wisdom.

294
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:14,917
To allow your children to be corrected by others

295
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,000
is the first thing you, good thing you do to your children.

296
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,999
Let them have respect for others.

297
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:21,834
Let them feel, "They are also my uncles.

298
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,291
They are also my aunties. They can correct me."

299
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:31,250
Then, to obey and not to question too much.

300
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,999
I mean, here every child there was, once I was traveling

301
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,083
with a Sahaja Yogini. Her son was all the time asking,

302
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:40,583
"Why this? Why that?"

303
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,667
and she was answering him.

304
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,834
I said, "You shut up now," to that boy,

305
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,999
and after that he never asked her why.

306
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,417
As if they have a right to ask you,

307
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,166
they go on asking questions.

308
00:16:56,625 --> 00:17:00,208
How dare they ask you questions? You are parents.

309
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:05,333
We don't ask questions to our parents - never, never.

310
00:17:08,291 --> 00:17:12,625
We are no way less than anybody else in this world.

311
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:17,917
On the contrary, I must say that in that culture those people

312
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:21,250
who have come up are very good Sahaja Yogis.

313
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:26,500
They are very sensible. They understand how far to go, what to do.

314
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,458
So what is we have to understand

315
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,959
that our Sahaja Yoga culture is such

316
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,166
that we have to learn certain things.

317
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:37,583
First of all, at least please don't make your children

318
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:42,208
so much what you call ego-oriented.

319
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,125
Don't make them ego-oriented, please.

320
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,834
See that your children respect all of them the same way,

321
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,709
they say "Namaste" to everyone,

322
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:55,250
and they are very, very obedient to everyone and even

323
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:59,375
if somebody corrects them, what's the harm?

324
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:05,333
I am really surprised because in the West

325
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:09,959
I used to think that the children are not attached to their parents or anything,

326
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,458
but it's not so, because they are glued to parents.

327
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:13,458
Not only glued,

328
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:17,208
but as soon as they get a chance they run away from the parents,

329
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:21,125
because you dote too much on their heads, you see.

330
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,333
That's why.

331
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:26,917
There is no freedom.

332
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,542
All the time they are jealous.

333
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,583
I have heard also of ladies

334
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:34,208
who are jealous of Me because I am the Mother.

335
00:18:36,709 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes, so stupid.

336
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,083
I find, I mean

337
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,291
if supposing somebody mothers my child I will look after that lady.

338
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,959
I'll send her a sari. I'll send her a present.

339
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:50,000
I'll be very happy that you have looked after my child.

340
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,333
Reactions are so funny, isn't it?

341
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:57,250
Why such responses and reactions?

342
00:18:57,667 --> 00:19:00,083
Like supposing you have music program in here,

343
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:03,125
your neighbors will come, go to the police, call everybody.

344
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:07,000
Otherwise, even if you are dying they will not be bothered.

345
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:11,750
On the contrary, in India supposing you have a music,

346
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,917
"Oh God, they are going to have the music."

347
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,250
It's all right . Bring everything, carpets for them, everything.

348
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Give them food -

349
00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:23,542
"What will you have?" and the whole area will be there to help you

350
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:29,792
and this and that. And they'll sleep nicely, if they want to sleep.

351
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,834
Their collectivity is very good and you see their children,

352
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:41,375
anybody scolds any child there, anybody.

353
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,999
Because you are ego-oriented, please be careful

354
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:50,417
don't make your children also ego-oriented.

355
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:54,709
It's so difficult for you to get rid of your egos, you know that.

356
00:19:55,291 --> 00:20:01,041
Anything, you know, like a snake is there, again back.

357
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:06,917
Then I used to wonder how is it their ego comes up?

358
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:10,375
This (inaudible) told Me, "My husband, you know, Mother,

359
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,542
what is this ego, ego, ego?"  I said, "What?"

360
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:16,333
"He always tells me I have got ego, ego, ego. What is this?"

361
00:20:16,542 --> 00:20:19,999
she asked Me. "What is this disease, ego?

362
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,750
Ego, ego, ego?"

363
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,999
I said, "You see, it means Ahamkar."

364
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,834
She said, "Then why does he boast of it?"

365
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:31,875
Ahamkar is a sin.

366
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,583
Even to say "I hate you," it's a sinful thing to say.

367
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:37,041
I mean, in Hindi language if you say, "I hate you," they'll say,

368
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,834
"Are you mad or what?" They think you must be mad.

369
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:43,625
You cannot say that I commit this sin.

370
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,542
So this is what it is,

371
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,999
and anybody who is treated like that, even in India, can become bad

372
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:56,333
- even in India - pampered too much by parents

373
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:00,208
or sort of made too much of them and all that.

374
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:05,959
But we know our parents love us, they care for us.

375
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:10,458
My mother was such a strict person as far as strictness,

376
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:13,417
but today why I am cooking so well? Because of My mother.

377
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,834
She used to tell Me even how to hold the

378
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,458
- what you call - the spoon.

379
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:24,291
When I was a very small little girl about five years old, I know,

380
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,959
Then we have this tawa, is a very black thing, round,

381
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,792
where we make rotis.

382
00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:30,125
She used to tell Me, "Clean it."

383
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,250
And we had so many servants in the house

384
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,999
but still, and I remember My small little white hands

385
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:38,542
all becoming black like this, you see, and I would clean it.

386
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:42,542
But I am very good at cleaning. I am very good at everything. How?

387
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,999
It's thanks to My mother.

388
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:48,375
Nothing doing.

389
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:52,208
Now at least make your children get up in the morning.

390
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,792
We have to give something better to our children

391
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,500
better training. Same I have seen with ladies.

392
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:03,458
Now ladies must understand that those who live here

393
00:22:03,709 --> 00:22:08,125
or in any ashram, they are the housewives and they have to know.

394
00:22:08,417 --> 00:22:11,917
I was surprised when I asked the people who have come from all the way,

395
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,500
"What did you have?" They said, "Nothing. We had those samosas

396
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,917
and something to eat. That's all."

397
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,999
I mean, that they are guests in the house.

398
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,709
Nobody had anything. I was having all kinds of food

399
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:28,542
but I never knew that they are making like this.

400
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:30,875
I mean, not to feel bad. Otherwise if I say something

401
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,417
you'll catch on Center Heart, not for that.

402
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:37,500
This is another specialty because of ego only.

403
00:22:37,709 --> 00:22:41,542
This is because there is nothing goes inside the head;

404
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:45,250
nothing goes inside the heart. It goes into some center, you know.

405
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:48,834
Mother said so? All right, Center Heart is catching,

406
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,458
or my Left Vishuddhi is catching.

407
00:22:52,667 --> 00:22:55,333
Baba, but no, why don't you correct your brain?

408
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,750
Because we don't want to face it. We don't want to correct it.

409
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:02,917
So put it in the Left Vishuddhi or in the Center Heart.

410
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,583
Now if some guests come to your house -

411
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:09,375
Gregoire will tell you, one day

412
00:23:09,583 --> 00:23:11,542
they were all there, about twenty-five of them,

413
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,166
sitting in the gallery. My daughter was there.

414
00:23:13,375 --> 00:23:15,417
I went and told her that, "They are there,

415
00:23:15,667 --> 00:23:18,208
they may stay on longer. So you better cook for all of them."

416
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,959
She had done the cooking.

417
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,583
When we finished - remember, Gregoire,

418
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:24,458
we finished our program - I said, "Let's have dinner."

419
00:23:24,709 --> 00:23:26,250
So they were surprised. They said, "How?"

420
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,999
I said, "I told her. She must have prepared."

421
00:23:28,166 --> 00:23:30,750
"In such a short time?" I said, "Yes, she must have prepared.'

422
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:33,041
She said, "Dinner is ready." We were all there.

423
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:34,667
She said if you tell somebody

424
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:36,959
that twenty-five people are going to come,

425
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,792
the women will be finished, like that.

426
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:42,166
They'll be thinking, "Now, I have to go for shopping..."

427
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:45,458
They start ...

428
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,542
And there is no confidence. There is no,

429
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,750
because no personality, no personality.

430
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:58,500
My husband, I told him yesterday that I have made pulao for people,

431
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,750
hundred people, that's all. I didn't do too much.

432
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,166
He said, "Hundred people is nothing?" I said, "No, nothing.

433
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,208
Five hundred would have been more, but -"

434
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:09,750
but not only Me,

435
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:12,458
My daughter can do it. You have seen her in Pratishthan.

436
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:15,125
My daughters can do it.

437
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:20,291
So we have self-confidence, you see, about anything you tell us.

438
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:23,291
Now all of your programs you have seen, you go on the tours,

439
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:28,041
how Indians arrange everything, in jungles, in anything.

440
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,458
But here first we start thinking,

441
00:24:30,709 --> 00:24:33,875
thinking, because we don't want to face the problem.

442
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,333
"We have to do it now. Let's do it."

443
00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:41,208
"That's not so. Let us sit down but plan out," you're finished then.

444
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:46,041
Now I have studied you too well.

445
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,542
I have been here, I am amazed, also.

446
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:53,834
And there is no training because your mother also avoids to train you.

447
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,792
There is no training - nothing.

448
00:24:55,999 --> 00:24:58,000
They don't know anything, I would say.

449
00:24:58,208 --> 00:25:01,458
They are still like little babies.

450
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,208
There has to be,

451
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:07,542
a girl must know how to stitch, a girl must know how to cook,

452
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,333
a girl must know how to look after a household, and shopping,

453
00:25:12,542 --> 00:25:14,792
and she must know what is good meat, what is bad meat.

454
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,208
She must know about what is a diamond, which is not a diamond;

455
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:22,917
which is silk, which is not. All this is taught in the family.

456
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:25,792
Whether you are a career girl or not

457
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:27,542
- you are a career girl, all right -

458
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:32,375
but this is the main thing. This is the basis for a woman to know.

459
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:39,291
We are women without being women.

460
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:43,333
And then a kind of a fondness,

461
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:46,250
to do for others, to give something.

462
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,208
I will tell you about my granddaughter. When they were young,

463
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:52,166
both, three of them,  I asked them, "What you want to be?"

464
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:56,750
They said, "We want to be a nurse or to be an air hostess."

465
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:59,041
So I said, "Why these two?"

466
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,834
She said, "You know, Grandma,

467
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,250
only in these two professions you can give food to others to eat."

468
00:26:07,417 --> 00:26:09,709
See how, how they feel.

469
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:14,417
And recently about a year back - she is only 18, elder one -

470
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:16,834
she invited twenty-five people for dinner.

471
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:19,000
So I thought she is going to tell the servants or someone.

472
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:20,667
She said, "No, I am going to do the cooking."

473
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:25,999
And she did it and she fed everyone and everybody started praising.

474
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,999
She said, "No, no, no. You know, they are just saying it

475
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,291
because I have cooked but I know it's all insipid.

476
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:32,000
It's all insipid. It's nothing good.

477
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:34,208
But they are just saying it because I have cooked."

478
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:38,333
For twenty-five people she cooked alone.

479
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,250
Because they feel happy to do it,

480
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:45,625
They're happy to give things to others.

481
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:49,041
They are so happy, you don't know.

482
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:52,125
It's just you are so affluent, you are so rich,

483
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:57,333
you have everything, but still there is no generosity.

484
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,291
My husband is extremely generous

485
00:27:03,542 --> 00:27:07,166
but the other day there was a gentleman - a Sahaja Yogi.

486
00:27:07,458 --> 00:27:09,959
An elderly gentleman who was a teacher of art

487
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,792
came to do a little drawing for Me.

488
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,500
I said, "What to give?" I told C.P.

489
00:27:13,709 --> 00:27:16,875
"C.P., have you got any suit with you spare?"

490
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:18,125
He said, "Maybe. Let's go and see."

491
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,959
I said, "I've seen one. Will you see that?"

492
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,166
That's an excellent suit he had.

493
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,709
"Oh!" he said, "please give this one. Is very good.

494
00:27:24,959 --> 00:27:27,458
I have only used it once but I have never used it outside;

495
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:30,834
just I have tried it. So if he likes, please give him."

496
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:34,458
So he took the - and when I gave him he was very happy and he said,

497
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:38,959
"Mother, I was looking out for a suit and I've wanted one suit."

498
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:42,667
C.P.'s eyes were filled with joy, and his tears,

499
00:27:42,999 --> 00:27:45,583
He said, "You know, he wanted the suit, do you know?

500
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,417
How nice we gave him what he wanted."

501
00:27:50,208 --> 00:27:53,750
See the delicacy of character

502
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:57,834
- so overjoyed that he wanted the suit -

503
00:27:58,041 --> 00:28:00,291
and because I am very good at what one wants, you see,

504
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:04,041
but he, he was so charmed and was so happy,

505
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,375
and after such a long time I saw that joy in his eyes.

506
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:13,917
"Oh God! So what he wanted, we gave him."

507
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,667
It's such a, after all, you see, what is there after all?

508
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:28,417
What is the use of all these riches, these (inaudible) and things?

509
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:32,667
What do we get? Nothing, no joy, nothing.

510
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,500
First of all we think we are husband and wife,

511
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,417
then to quarrel all the time, all right.

512
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,792
I don't think there is much love also there.

513
00:28:42,999 --> 00:28:43,959
I don't know about Sahaja Yogis,

514
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:47,375
but otherwise, I don't know about Sahaja Yogis also.

515
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:51,625
Then that quarreling is over. Then "my child, my children."

516
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:55,458
Then they also quarrel, they also fight, they also run away.

517
00:28:55,709 --> 00:28:58,583
By the age they are sixteen they are thinking

518
00:28:58,792 --> 00:29:02,500
where they are going to run away. Why do they run away?

519
00:29:08,959 --> 00:29:12,999
But our children stick like leeches.

520
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:18,000
We have never made them like that but still they stick.

521
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:24,917
Why?

522
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,917
They are not ego-oriented.

523
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:31,583
Because you are separated. You are a different identity.

524
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:34,750
"I. I like this. I like that."

525
00:29:34,999 --> 00:29:36,583
I mean, it's a sin to say like that.

526
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:40,250
Who are you to say, "I like"? "I" means what?

527
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,250
So all these things we have to change and we have to understand.

528
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:52,417
Only possibility is in ashram life.

529
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,000
How you respect, how you live,

530
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,583
how you greet each and every person,

531
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:01,333
how you behave:

532
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:04,375
this is a culture we have to imbibe.

533
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:09,125
If we have to give our children a very good time we have to imbibe.

534
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,667
I wouldn't say that in India we don't have funny people.

535
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:18,250
We have people of loose characters, we have all kinds of things.

536
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:21,458
But the number is so little that they do not influence.

537
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,250
Here, the number is of the others are more than these.

538
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,709
So they influence too much.

539
00:30:25,917 --> 00:30:28,709
Everybody is putting their hair like this now.

540
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,542
So you don't have your hair, you'll also feel like putting your hair like this.

541
00:30:37,417 --> 00:30:38,917
It's a, it's, I don't know why,

542
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:42,542
and also this is a false idea

543
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,542
that we should have our hair very disheveled.

544
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,792
You see, I being this Goddess business

545
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:50,875
I have to keep My hair open,

546
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:54,792
but I keep them all right. They are not disheveled.

547
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:58,291
I have to keep Mine because you know, Muktakeshi

548
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:01,250
- keep Her hair open because of vibrations to flow.

549
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:06,500
But I never, you would never find My hair jumbled up like that.

550
00:31:08,375 --> 00:31:10,500
Because then the bhoots catch you.

551
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,959
They see, "This is the head. Oh, good one!

552
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,959
It's is a jumbled head. Get into it!"

553
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,917
Bhoots catch you much more in modern times than they used to catch

554
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,542
because we live like bhoots.

555
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,709
You know, on the street you go and find so many women, men

556
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:31,709
dressed up just like bhoots. So bhoots can go. "This is the bhoot!"

557
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:34,834
Why not they catch in India so many bhoots?

558
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,999
Once somebody gets his realization,

559
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:41,000
I have not met many those who catch bhoots.

560
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:44,959
Because we dress up like that,

561
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,999
we are ego-oriented, so the bhoots come in.

562
00:31:48,625 --> 00:31:51,125
I am not saying you should go to hairdressers and all that,

563
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:55,583
but one should not have a face or a hair like a bhoot.

564
00:31:56,208 --> 00:32:00,041
Now if you want how a bhoot looks like, I will show you also.

565
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:05,917
So this is what one has to understand

566
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,917
that there is something missing in our upbringing,

567
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,750
which we have to change, and the change has to be

568
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,750
that to make a good family, to have good children,

569
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,500
we have to have certain ideas whom to respect,

570
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:22,792
how to respect, how to understand.

571
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:31,959
I mean, like Gupta got angry with Dr. Talwar.

572
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,291
So I told him, "You go and touch his feet." Immediately he did it.

573
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,875
"He is elder than you, and you have no business to get angry.

574
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,834
Go and touch his feet." Immediately he did, and he said,

575
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,959
"See now, he provoked me, Mother, and I have got the bad name."

576
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,959
I said, "You go and touch his feet," he touched his feet

577
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:51,208
immediately, no question.

578
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:56,333
Anybody answers anybody

579
00:32:56,625 --> 00:33:00,166
- a child, a younger person answers to anyone else -

580
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,999
the father, mother will all the time, "Go and fall at his feet.

581
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,208
Come along. Nothing doing."

582
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,750
That's how they learn respect.

583
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,999
You are very good seekers. You are seeking the truth and all that

584
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:19,667
but with that, to bear that truth,

585
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:24,166
we have to have a kind of a culture that you can bear it.

586
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:28,625
Otherwise, this ego will always shoot out, right side.

587
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:33,000
The right side is the problem of the West. This you agree?

588
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,792
[Sahaja Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji.]

589
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,333
But you will find this with your leaders, not with yourself.

590
00:33:37,542 --> 00:33:39,166
This is the problem.

591
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,208
The one who has the authority to assert,

592
00:33:41,417 --> 00:33:43,166
you will find it with him, not with yourself,

593
00:33:43,417 --> 00:33:46,458
that you have this problem, isn't it true?

594
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:56,875
The wives of leaders also should know they are the mothers

595
00:33:57,083 --> 00:34:00,667
and they have to have an extremely sweet and a humble nature

596
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,542
and they should tolerate lot of nonsense;

597
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,625
not only that, but always try to soothe their husbands.

598
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:11,208
I'll tell you, in My husband's office in Shipping Corporation

599
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:15,458
all the people there depended on Me. If anything goes wrong,

600
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:18,166
if C.P. is angry with them, they'll come and tell Me.

601
00:34:18,417 --> 00:34:21,583
Then I would slowly tell him, "Why should you be so angry with them?

602
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:24,083
After all, you see, they are humans beings and they have done-"

603
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,250
"Oh! So they come to you?" "Yes, they did."

604
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,500
Then I would tell him, I would tell him,

605
00:34:31,709 --> 00:34:33,500
"Because they think I am more generous than you are."

606
00:34:33,709 --> 00:34:38,458
"All right, I am also more generous." Then he would be doing.

607
00:34:39,999 --> 00:34:43,834
So she should not think she is a leader - no, never.

608
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,083
She should think, "I am the mother of all these,"

609
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:48,959
now she should see the people who have come here:

610
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,291
have they got food or not? Have they been attended to or not?

611
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:56,583
These are guests, and guests are to be treated like gods.

612
00:34:57,083 --> 00:35:03,500
And the trouble here is that everybody walks into your house like a guest,

613
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,875
or stays with you like a guest, you see, like -

614
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:08,709
you will be surprised, I had a house in Hounslow.

615
00:35:08,917 --> 00:35:11,792
So many Sahaja Yogis stayed there, never paid a single pie.

616
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,917
I had to pay for electricity, gas, everything.

617
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,375
From the very beginning since I have been in London,

618
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:18,999
I have been paying for all that.

619
00:35:19,208 --> 00:35:21,375
Even Shudy Camp, most of the money I have paid,

620
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:24,041
but there were twenty-five people living there when I went,

621
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:27,834
not paying a single penny for anything.

622
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,542
But Indian won't do that

623
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:37,875
because of self-respect.

624
00:35:41,667 --> 00:35:42,917
Now I am telling Mathias,

625
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:44,999
"I have used your telephone this time many a times,"

626
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:46,333
and he has to take the money.

627
00:35:46,542 --> 00:35:49,667
If he doesn't take money I won't be able to sleep.

628
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,792
So, use somebody's telephone as much as you like,

629
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,834
use anybody's things as much as you like,

630
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,792
stay there in their house so carelessly.

631
00:35:59,999 --> 00:36:03,041
It's so common in the West. I never knew.

632
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:05,750
I used to think, "They are very upright people.

633
00:36:05,959 --> 00:36:08,959
They will never come to your house like that."

634
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:14,500
Gregoire will tell you the whole story about it if you want to hear.

635
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:21,000
So now this ashram where you are living,

636
00:36:21,208 --> 00:36:23,792
even if you are coming from outside, you are Sahaja Yogis.

637
00:36:23,999 --> 00:36:26,500
You find something dirty, try to clean it.

638
00:36:26,709 --> 00:36:28,750
This is your house.

639
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:32,250
So it has become like nobody's house now.

640
00:36:33,917 --> 00:36:35,417
Actually, it is everybody's house.

641
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:38,917
Recently it has become nobody's house.

642
00:36:40,709 --> 00:36:43,750
So, not to feel bad, not to feel upset, not to feel

643
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,959
that I am in any way trying to put you down, but I must tell you that

644
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:52,542
this will develop your children's ego and your ego, too.

645
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:56,166
To live together, enjoy together,

646
00:36:56,375 --> 00:37:00,333
we have to have certain type of culture

647
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:04,750
which is not in the West. West are very individualistic,

648
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,875
extremely individualistic people, and they have this problem

649
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:12,250
and they have suffered because of that.

650
00:37:12,542 --> 00:37:15,917
We want to create a new world of people

651
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:18,999
who love each other, who will enjoy each other

652
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:22,250
and who understand each other; not only that,

653
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,500
but those who have collective consciousness manifested in their own lives.

654
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:30,792
And also to tell somebody, "You are a bhoot,

655
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:32,999
you're caught up like this," it's not proper.

656
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:37,333
That shows you have no understanding how to deal with people.

657
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:39,959
Never say, "You have a bhoot," or anything.

658
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:43,166
At the most you can say "this chakra is catching," if it is needed,

659
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:46,834
but there is no need to tell that.

660
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:52,917
Is, as we, you see, as we say that

661
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:56,375
"If you become the king you have to wear the crown".

662
00:37:56,709 --> 00:38:00,750
So if you become a Sahaja Yogi you have to wear this culture.

663
00:38:02,375 --> 00:38:06,834
You cannot be like bhoots, cannot be.

664
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,166
Not that you have to be something different

665
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:11,834
like Hare Rama, Hare Krishna. I am not saying this,

666
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:16,166
but you have to be something special.

667
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:22,291
And the speciality doesn't come by becoming punks or anything.

668
00:38:22,999 --> 00:38:26,458
Punks think they are very special people

669
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,625
by making that kind of a hairstyle.

670
00:38:31,125 --> 00:38:35,333
Speciality is within yourself. It's a kind of a culture.

671
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,834
So first of all, look after your ego.

672
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,959
Soul-searching has to be there.

673
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:45,709
Because when I read Russian people, their books,

674
00:38:45,917 --> 00:38:49,999
I found out that every book, whether they describe romance,

675
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:51,834
they describe anything,

676
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:54,959
there is behind, is all soul-searching.

677
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,208
They are trying to find out, "Why I am doing this? Why I am doing that?

678
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,625
Why am I like this?" Soul-searching is there.

679
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:03,000
So we should search our souls.

680
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,417
So all the time say, "Why am I doing this?

681
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:08,375
Why am I like this?  What is the reason?"

682
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:12,834
This is what has to be done. Then this ego will drop out.

683
00:39:14,375 --> 00:39:20,000
It's a funny thing because it's already grown so big, you see.

684
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,291
So you push it down, it comes back up like a rubber,

685
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:28,083
push it down, again with the slightest thing it comes up.

686
00:39:30,083 --> 00:39:34,125
Arrogance,  talking loudly and misbehaving,

687
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,625
all that, right Vishuddhi catches so badly.

688
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,125
All right?

689
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:45,750
So now it is not in any way to correct you but to guide you.

690
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:49,208
And not to feel bad and Center Heart or something catching there,

691
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,959
nothing of the kind. It should, it should catch nowhere

692
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:57,583
but it should correct you in the normal way.

693
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,999
Now the problem of Indians are different

694
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:04,291
and I, when I deal with them, I talk to them.

695
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,500
But at least they do not have cultural problem;

696
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,375
that's one thing.

697
00:40:16,667 --> 00:40:19,291
Of course, I mean, if they come from stupid families,

698
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,208
if they have come with nonsensical things, then it's all right.

699
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:25,709
Normally ninety-nine percent, one percent could be bad, also,

700
00:40:26,083 --> 00:40:28,834
I am not saying they are not bad.

701
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,583
And everybody must work - not that three, four people are working.

702
00:40:40,709 --> 00:40:43,750
You must learn every day. You can learn so many things,

703
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,417
and you are seekers. Not only that, but you are Sahaja Yogis.

704
00:40:47,667 --> 00:40:53,000
You have so much of dynamism. You can do such a lot.

705
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,792
So any idea about yourself - you are so great or something -

706
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,125
should be given up because we are Sahaja Yogis.

707
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:06,208
So we are already great. Those who are great are already great.

708
00:41:06,709 --> 00:41:08,583
I mean, supposing somebody says You are Adi Shakti.

709
00:41:08,792 --> 00:41:12,959
Now, I don't think it's something great because I am that. So what?

710
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:17,583
If I was not that I would have felt, but I am Adi Shakti. So what?

711
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,999
If I am Adi Shakti why should I feel proud of it?

712
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:23,999
Because it is just there. What to do?

713
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,792
And whenever you are saying, "Jai" and all that,

714
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:33,792
I feel you are saying somebody else's "Jai".

715
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,417
Sometimes I am afraid I might start saying with you.

716
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,583
It never goes into My head,

717
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,458
and you know, I don't know how it goes into your head.

718
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:49,417
I said perhaps the hole is too big, so nothing stays.

719
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,875
But you see, that's what I am saying.

720
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:55,417
Now for you, if I am the model and if you understand Me,

721
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:58,750
then you must understand My culture.

722
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:03,917
How, like Mathias was surprised that

723
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:07,333
they were putting some balm on My feet or something on My feet, and I said,

724
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:12,959
"Now, put some towel because I don't want this sheet to be spoilt."

725
00:42:13,291 --> 00:42:16,166
I mean, this is very, nothing great to Me but he felt

726
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:19,667
that I was extremely - what, humble or what.

727
00:42:19,875 --> 00:42:21,792
But what is there? A sheet will be spoiled in any case,

728
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:25,250
whether they are My feet or anybody's feet.

729
00:42:26,125 --> 00:42:29,125
That's how it should be.

730
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:32,208
So culturally, though I mean,

731
00:42:32,458 --> 00:42:37,041
we are very rich, I have never realized how rich Indians are.

732
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:39,000
Now I am realizing.

733
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,875
Now supposing somebody is leaving.

734
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:44,250
A little pencil is left - so little, you see - in the house,

735
00:42:44,542 --> 00:42:45,999
but that belongs to somebody.

736
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:49,542
That will be kept like a precious stone, you know.

737
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:53,166
Till you meet that person and give that,

738
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:55,999
everybody'll say, "Have you given that? Have you given that or not?"

739
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:59,875
"Baba, that person has not come as yet. He's gone somewhere."

740
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:02,834
As soon as he'll come, first thing we'll go with that pencil

741
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,333
and he'll say, "What? This pencil you've brought for me?"

742
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:08,999
He will feel so bad about it, but no, the pencil belongs to him, all right,

743
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:12,291
keep it like a precious stone.

744
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:20,125
I mean, they are poor people compared to you.

745
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:25,041
Even the servants don't do any thieving, nothing.

746
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,291
These politicians must have picked up from somewhere.

747
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,709
I don't know from where they, must be from Warren Hastings.

748
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:33,834
But normally there is no thieving in the house.

749
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,375
Everything is left open. Everything is there, no thieving.

750
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,625
Government is corrupt

751
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,834
- there's all horrible things are corrupt, that's there -

752
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:53,625
but as far as the society is concerned, we are very honest.

753
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:02,875
I wish "Sarat Chandra" was translated for you

754
00:44:03,041 --> 00:44:06,250
to understand this beauty of this culture.

755
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:13,291
Lot of such good points of this culture.

756
00:44:13,542 --> 00:44:17,542
We had that, you have that thing of Shrikanth,

757
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,709
film of "Shrikanth"?

758
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,208
[Sahaja Yogi: I am not sure, Shri Mataji...]

759
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:24,125
English are coming. Ask them to bring it.

760
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:27,208
It's one of the best films you will see.

761
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,667
[Another Sahaja Yogi: They are
already at the airport, Shri Mataji.

762
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,250
They are already at the airport, Shri Mataji. The English, are arriving.]

763
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:38,750
All right, next time.

764
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:40,041
[Sahaja Yogi: They are coming over here].

765
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,709
[Sahaja Yogi: Diwali, Diwali.]

766
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:47,083
[Sahaja Yogi: Thank you, Shri Mataji.]

767
00:44:47,291 --> 00:44:48,792
May God bless you all.
