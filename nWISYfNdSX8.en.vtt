00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:09.910
vibrations on the photographs, that’s very
important. How to know where you are, as far

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:18.269
as God is concerned. That’s the main thing,
isn’t it? We are here for that: to be one

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:27.689
with God, to be [in] union with His Power,
to be his instruments. And how our connections

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.850
get loose, and how we can to correct it, we
should try to understand that.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:46.800
First of all, we must realise that you are
not to think about it. If you start thinking

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.620
too much about it, then you have seen that
you do something funny which you should not

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.740
have done. Do not plan out too much about
it, also, because, in this country, if people

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.369
start planning out, they’ll get all the
planning done. For example, they have to go

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.530
for a walk: then they must have proper shoes,
they must have proper sticks, they must have

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.329
this, they must have that, and they must have
gloves, and they must have everything, and

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:21.749
they never go out! They are so exhausted with
the planning itself. (laughter)

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:36.329
In the same way, it happens with Sahaja Yoga.
It very much happens the same way with Sahaja

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:45.499
Yoga, I have seen that though I have told
you not to plan it out, not to think about

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:52.549
it, still you go on doing it and that is how
you get into problems; that by thinking you

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:02.609
cannot correct yourself. What you can do is
to know that you can put bandhans or you can

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:08.069
give yourself a balance with your hands. You
have to move your hands and not your brain.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.390
Alright? Our brains are moving and hands and
feet never move! And out of proportion our

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.130
brains are moving but our hands and feet do
not move. This is the society which H.G. Wells

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.640
had described, I can see it very clearly,
that you have more brains than your deftness

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.840
and than your understanding. Your fingers
are not so sensitive and the brain leads you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.650
to artificiality. So, you are not to use your
thinking for correcting your chakras. Now

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.060
should I write it down in golden words? That,
“You cannot think about it and sort it out.”

00:02:48.060 --> 00:03:02.680
This is one thing people do not understand.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:11.740
Now we have got mantras for different chakras.
Every chakra has got a mantra which you know.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:19.610
If you do not know, you should find out. Now,
if one chakra is catching, then you work on

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.590
that chakra only and develop your mantra on
that. For example, supposing you have to say

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.930
something for your heart: then, first of all,
you must ask for forgiveness from God. That

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.480
means your attention has not been so much
as it should have been on the Spirit. Or,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.300
if you have done any mistakes, ask for forgiveness,
you ask for forgiveness. Now, you ask for

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.720
forgiveness from your heart. Even doing with
hand can be artificial, you understand that?

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.500
It could be just ritualistic – but from
your heart. Whatever you have to say, you

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.260
say it from your heart. Ask for forgiveness
from your heart, not [to] think about it.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.560
You see, this is the trouble is. If I say
something then you start thinking about it,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.910
and then you said then, “Now, I have to
take out my attention from the centre,”

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.140
and then you start taking out your attention.
You cannot. With your brain, you cannot take

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.749
out your attention from anywhere. It’s only
through your hands, or movement of your hands,

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:23.590
or by saying mantras you bring in. Do you
understand that point? Absolutely clear-cut.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.539
Many people think that if they pay attention
to something and pull their attention – you

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:35.020
cannot. But what you can do is to, when you
are saying the mantra, put your attention,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.580
without thought, to that particular chakra.
So you master that chakra ultimately, the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:50.219
one which is a weakness can become your mastery.
But if you think, then you are catching again

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.770
the heart much more. You have known that by
thinking you catch your right side in the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.340
sense that it starts [getting] overactive,
it gets over-activated, and left side gets

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.740
frozen up, by which heart is catching. Your
ego develops which engulfs your heart. So

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:15.900
the more you think about it, how to correct
your ego, the worse you are. You fight it.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.340
So then we know that you have to give a balance,
bring down your ego – with your hand, with

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.629
massaging, you can bring it down, because
in your hand it is flowing, whether you are

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.580
catching or not catching, it is flowing from
your hand is there – the flow from your

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.550
hand is there. You may not even receive from
Me but there is flow already started, it’s

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.740
germinated, little bit is always there. Use
that to massage your head, bring down your

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.069
ego.

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:47.439
Then for heart also, do not think about it
but give it, or you put your hand towards

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:52.590
it. Direct the vibrations but don’t think
at that time. This is the important thing.

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.949
If you are thinking and directing, it cannot
be directed because your attention is engulfed

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:05.169
in the thinking process. Do you understand
that point? And here, the problem is people

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:11.860
think too much and talk too much. I mean,
they talk about everything. They know everything.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:21.039
It is such a wasteful habit of thinking and
then talking about it. Everybody is a monarch

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:27.210
here because of ego. So now please tell your
ego, “You please keep shut – now we know

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:34.319
you too well!” Try to push it back as much
as you can, with force sometimes, bring it

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.819
back, like that. Try to bring it to its normal
position and you will be amazed once it goes

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:48.419
to its normal position you’ll feel very
much lighter. So this is to be done with your

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.139
hand.

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:55.300
You can use oil to rub on your body, if you
have to rub, you can use even powder or anything

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.059
for having less friction, but it is through
massage, through giving bandhans, by taking

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:05.749
it out, or through limbu (hindi: lime/lemon)
or you can use even an orange or something

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:12.439
like that, Try to take out these vibrations
through these mediums and not through thinking.

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:17.870
Through thinking, you cannot do it. Once you
think about it, you have no power over yourself.

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.559
There’s a barrier between the Spirit and
you, because you are thinking through your

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:28.589
ego.

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:32.059
You must have noticed many a times, when I
tell you that, “This you should not have

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:35.909
done!” You said “I know.” You see, this
is something I can’t understand, when you

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:41.849
know that this should not have been done,
then why are you doing it? (laughing) Now

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:46.339
which is that ‘I’ which knows? Is your
Spirit. Or which is that is doing it against

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:55.080
it? Is your ego. So, identification should
be with Spirit, and Spirit does not think

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.189
– it manifests.

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:08.659
So you cannot sort it out through your thinking.
It’s all false and faulty life. Anything

00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:14.559
you do with thinking, it will be all faulty.
Now why you people in this country have lost

00:08:14.559 --> 00:08:24.550
your deftness in the hands? For the same reason.
If I ask a question, say, on, say, some art,

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:32.620
people can tell me a lot about art, but if
you tell them even to hold a brush in their

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:41.159
hands, they cannot! In any art, any deftness
or anything, they think. That’s how the

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:46.259
creativity, the spontaneity, is finished:
by thinking.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:52.560
And that’s why you must have seen, the people
these days who producing art, is also so horrible,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.279
that within twenty years all these artistic
pieces will die out. They will have no value.

00:08:56.279 --> 00:09:02.110
All these are produced in these, I see them
everyday in so-called “modern art” and

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:12.509
all that. The real modern art can only be
done by a person who has got his Spirit manifesting,

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:19.529
like Blake. The one whose Spirit is not manifesting,
whether he’s a poet or whether he is an

00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:24.920
artist or anything, whatever he is doing is
going to finish in no time, has no value,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:31.750
because it cannot give happiness to Spirit.
It can only give happiness outside.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:36.050
So do everything in silence – not thinking
– in thoughtless awareness. That’s the

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:44.120
main point. How much you pamper your ego,
you just see morning till evening. It’s

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:55.990
very simple to see in life. We try to be angry
and in temper, or sometimes try to be very,

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:03.620
very gentle, and sometimes very, very humble
to look at, just to please that ego of ours

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.829
– not to ourselves, the Spirit.

00:10:06.829 --> 00:10:14.310
Now just fighting your ego, you are not going
to achieve much, as I have told you. Just

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:22.449
do not accept its existence. It doesn’t
exist for you any longer, does not exist.

00:10:22.449 --> 00:10:28.540
Ego is only existent in God because He does
something, you do not do. That’s why it’s

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:34.430
a myth. Your ego is a myth, you have no ego.
It’s a myth and you are carrying on with

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:47.370
the myth. Now ego in a man is nonsense. Ego
in God is all sense.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.980
Now when you are facing the photograph, just
to check up yourself, humble down yourself.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:59.920
First of all, humble down like a person who
wants to perfect oneself. Before the photograph,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.100
you humble down yourself and try to find out
what’s wrong with you. Best thing is to

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.069
give yourself a bandhan. Don’t think again.
“Humble down” means try to bring down

00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:17.540
your attention to your heart. Humble down.
Bring it down to your heart. Don’t think.

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:24.100
Now you put attention to the photograph without
thinking and see for yourself what chakras

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.319
are catching. One should not immediately jump
into conclusion, “Oh yes, I am catching

00:11:29.319 --> 00:11:32.769
for this, I am catching for that, I am catching
for another person,” and all this nonsense

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:37.519
is not needed. You need not take it to a rationality
to judge it why you are catching, that’s

00:11:37.519 --> 00:11:46.269
not important for us. It is catching, alright.
So do not go on a trip of thinking. I can

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:49.509
ask, you need not.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:53.899
If you are checking other people, then it’s
alright because you can tell them what is

00:11:53.899 --> 00:12:01.649
to be done. But then you find something – now
left is catching. So, now you know that this

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:05.639
is because of your guilt, whichever is built
in your subconscious you are catching on the

00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:09.940
left. It could be due to anything because
you didn’t have proper sense of morality.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:20.560
That’s the basics. Left Vishuddhi is immoral.
If you have been immoral you get this. Basics.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.690
Then, sisters relationship. Then, guilt that
is built in the subconscious. If you become

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:32.459
immoral, in the subconscious the guilt is
built. Any such guilt can come as any other

00:12:32.459 --> 00:12:38.519
guilt. Like you see, the real guilt is due
to something else, but people express it as

00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:43.430
something else. Alright?

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:49.649
So, do not worry as to what guilt you have
got. I never tell you what guilt you have

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:55.790
got, if you remember it correctly. Never I
tell you that you should say that you have

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:00.160
got this guilt. Many people tell me that,
“I have got a guilt that there is war in

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.990
Vietnam,” or some sort of a nonsense, or
“My forefathers went to Argentina and killed

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:12.110
many Indians.” All this is nonsense, you
see? The guilt is a subconscious action, is

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:20.680
what you call the conditioning in the left.
When there is some sort of an immoral behaviour

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.250
that is done. Even you may not be knowing
what is morality, you see, if you do not know

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.430
dharmas, might be something you are doing
which you should not have done. So forget

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:34.060
about it, detach yourself. The one who has
committed mistake is your ego, not you.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.550
You are pure because you are Spirit.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:44.300
So don’t condemn yourself for that. You
are not to bother. For example, if there is

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:50.379
defect in the instrument, there is no defect
in the electricity. Electricity is pure. It

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:56.180
is not carried out because there is defect
in the instrument. So we have to correct the

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:00.029
instrument. Now, if you think you are the
electricity you can correct it, but if you

00:14:00.029 --> 00:14:05.949
think you are the instrument, you can never
correct it because again you go to your subconscious,

00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:09.310
try to find out, “Oh, what things I must
have done?” It could be from your previous

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:16.600
lives, also. It could be you might have caught
it by saying something very filthy which you

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.610
do not remember.

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:23.879
So do not tax your mind. We are not psychoanalysts,
at all, to find out psychologically what is

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:27.579
wrong with us by asking questions and this,
then troubling yourself too much with ego.

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:30.810
Psychologists only think of the left [side]
but they don’t know when you try to do that

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:36.449
you develop your ego. When you start thinking
about it, from where this has come, immediately

00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:41.720
you develop the ego of a person and the person
goes on to the ego trip and which is even

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.990
more dangerous than subconscious problem.
Because people who have ego trouble the whole

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:51.930
community, while those who are superego only
trouble themselves. People with ego are much

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:59.389
more dangerous and troublesome than the people
with superego.

00:14:59.389 --> 00:15:09.459
So you just, first of all, see what is the
matter with you. Now, Left Vishuddhi is catching.

00:15:09.459 --> 00:15:15.740
Alright, so that means the Kundalini is not
properly going through the Left Vishuddhi.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:23.100
Alright? Then you be attached to your Spirit.
Try to attach yourself to your Spirit. Then

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:29.740
you clear it out. I see like that. Supposing
I am the Spirit and you are the body. I see

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:36.529
my Spirit and I see your Spirit. I am not
bothered what you have got. In the same way,

00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:44.120
you see yourself in two ways: that you are
the Spirit, and you are not the body or the

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:52.470
mind or anything. So we have to clear it.
They are paroksha, they are different, they

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:58.800
are another. We have to correct it. As electricity
is separated from this instrument (microphone),

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.920
in the same way you are separated from your
Spirit, but this separateness must be understood

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.740
in meditation, that’s why meditation is
necessary.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:14.459
For meditating, you should say that, “Mother,
make me the Spirit. I am the Spirit. Mother,

00:16:14.459 --> 00:16:19.759
I am the Spirit.” You start seeing through
the eyes of the Spirit everything, then you

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:27.259
do not feel bad. You laugh at yourself, make
fun of yourself, and then you enjoy yourself,

00:16:27.259 --> 00:16:34.779
only with yourself. You play with yourself.
You joke with yourself. And the whole thing

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:38.170
becomes a joke.

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:52.259
But for this, when you meditate, you find
out first of all what is the matter with you.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:57.759
But not mentally you resolve it, through your
vibrations and mantras. Mantras are very important

00:16:57.759 --> 00:17:10.400
for Sahaja Yogis. If these mantras could be
said, loudly is better in the beginning. That

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:17.589
is why, in privacy, you can do all these things,
in your room you can work it out. Now you

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:24.429
can use lemons, you can use water, you can
use light, you can use ether, aakash, you

00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:35.510
can use sea – all these things you can use
to cleanse yourself.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:40.779
Once you start facing yourself through your
Spirit, you won’t be so frightened. Because

00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:46.580
you do not want to face yourself, you are
all the time in that mood of frightened, fear.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.409
But once you start facing [yourself], you
will be amazed that, really, you are beautiful,

00:17:50.409 --> 00:17:56.409
and all these things will drop out. So there
is no need to condemn yourself in any way,

00:17:56.409 --> 00:18:04.659
or to elate yourself, but just be your Spirit.

00:18:04.659 --> 00:18:11.220
The best way to be with your Spirit is to
forgive, forgive, because then your thoughts

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.860
will go away. I mean, here there are people
with superego, but as soon as you remove their

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:22.900
superego, they get into ego very fast, I’ve
seen it. I mean, they are really basically

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.299
egos, actually, as if, from the horse they
have fallen for a while and as soon as you

00:18:26.299 --> 00:18:34.140
take them away, then lift them, they just
jump onto the horse again, it’s like that.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.059
So one has to be very careful about this point.
Now when you meditate, how much time, again,

00:18:39.059 --> 00:18:48.470
you are thinking? All this meticulousness,
if you try, then again you are thinking. You

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:54.850
just take the proper place to sit down, keep
the photograph before you and just feel your

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.690
vibrations – where are you catching?

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:03.000
Alright. Then you know how to remove your
catches. Without thinking, try to do that.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Then say the mantras on different chakras,
wherever you are catching, first of all. First

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.500
of all ascertain them (which are catching),
need not say all the mantras. Only say the

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:17.080
mantras in that part, with your heart. Remove
your baddhas with your hand and movement,

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.340
as you know that, and it would work out.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.190
(baby starts crying)

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:27.400
You can take her out now because it’s very
congested now for children, she’ll be better

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:40.480
off. Too much for her to face.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:47.710
The less you think, the faster you move with
your realisation. This is the blessings of

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:56.080
Indians. That’s why you can ask Ray what
he has to say about Sahaja Yoga. They don’t

00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:05.309
think much. Now see my cook whom I wanted
to teach cooking. In one month he learned:

00:20:05.309 --> 00:20:11.520
how to cook very well. But I can tell you
I cannot teach you people for six months.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.399
Even I don’t know if I can teach you that
much even in one year. Because very few things

00:20:17.399 --> 00:20:21.840
will go into the brain, and then come to the
hand is also difficult. You discuss anything,

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.850
say, planning of the room, everybody will
be arguing without thinking that, “Just

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:36.770
receive the thing, let’s see what it is,”
everybody will start arguing. In the same

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:44.320
way, if you have to learn how to be a Spirit,
do not argue it out. Do not think about it.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:51.450
Just try to become, to become, you have to
become.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:56.850
Now I have understood, [what] your basic problem
is: that everything you want to sort out with

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:02.070
your brain and don’t want to use your hands,
and that’s why the inertia is setting in.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:06.620
People are becoming lethargic, you see. Unless
and until you move physically, how the inertia

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:15.940
is going to go out? Not through your brain.
So reduce your thinking. Do not try to sort

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:27.700
out things through your thinking. It will
give you a serenity, a kind of a peaceful

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:36.899
existence. While talking to each other better
to whisper, talk slowly. In my presence, you

00:21:36.899 --> 00:21:42.039
shouldn’t shout and talk loudly [but] in
a very whispering way, it’s a silence in

00:21:42.039 --> 00:21:49.070
which you are here. Normally, people talk
as if, say, I am just a housewife or something.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:53.340
One should understand that’s not the way
to talk, because then you are missing the

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.679
point, you see? You are playing with My Maya,
which you should not come into. Try to [do

00:21:58.679 --> 00:22:05.260
that with] each other also. Because you are
saints. Do not quarrel and argue. Reduce your

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:13.460
arguments to minimum and minimum.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:26.960
Moreover, find out all the ways by which your
mind goes out and stop it. Try to stop that,

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:31.570
because now your mind has thought for at least
seven lives ahead. You don’t need any more

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:37.500
thinking, you have done enough. Whatever brain
God has given you, you have so much bashed

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:43.320
it, that now better leave it alone and don’t
think. Then the inspiration will come to you

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:48.580
from within. And when the inspiration will
be coming, then you will find it will be very

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:57.279
different; it will be very beautiful, absolutely
beautiful it will be.

00:22:57.279 --> 00:23:06.039
I think if you read Zen – I am not saying
go and read [because] immediately you will

00:23:06.039 --> 00:23:10.149
buy ten books and start reading!! For heaven’s
sake, don’t! I am just telling you that

00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:15.440
if you read Zen, you won’t understand, normally.
People won’t understand. They’ll just

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:24.169
describe like a little flower standing, lonely,
alone in the woodlands. They go see and enjoy

00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:34.909
it, and see that identification of loneliness
that: God is alone, He has no companion, He

00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:41.960
cannot share. But you cannot. You will think
about it, put words on it and make something

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:51.779
nonsense out of it. But they’ll enjoy, just
enjoy. They’ll make a pattern out of some

00:23:51.779 --> 00:23:57.450
stones and some sand, and I have seen all
Americans and all other people who go there,

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:04.490
they say, “What is this? What is this? What
is this?” It is a pattern to neutralise

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:09.440
your thoughts, that you go into thoughtless
awareness, you just see the pattern without

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.919
thinking. You try to see, at least, my face,
without thinking which my face, itself, makes

00:24:14.919 --> 00:24:18.330
you thoughtless. If you watch my face, it
makes you thoughtless.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:24.690
So, you watch my face without thinking. On
the photograph you can watch my face without

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:33.289
thinking and it will work out. Try to make
yourself thoughtless. That’s the first stage

00:24:33.289 --> 00:24:40.760
you have not achieved, and you jump onto that.
For no rhyme and reason, you jump onto that

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:47.600
thought business. This is the only quality
difference between you and Indians. They do

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:54.649
not think about it, they just imbibe. Have
you seen a child being nursed? It doesn’t

00:24:54.649 --> 00:25:04.380
think, it’s just sucking and enjoying. What
they say is to take attention inside, but

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:09.149
if you tell anybody here they will say, “We
are pulling our inside attention!” With

00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:24.080
your brain you will be trying all tricks and
doing nothing. Is to silence yourself, silence

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.640
your mind, and a serene atmosphere is there
which you feel around, which I feel very much

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:34.019
in India. Here, also, sometimes it sets in
within you, during puja time and all that.

00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:37.740
At the puja time, now it’s much better [but]
before they used to quarrel, early in the

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:43.380
morning, before puja a big quarrel is on,
and then the puja would start and I wouldn’t

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:52.190
know what to do with that kind of a puja!

00:25:52.190 --> 00:26:01.799
And, the main thing is that we have to be
one with our Selves. Without knowing the Atma,

00:26:01.799 --> 00:26:11.830
you cannot know God. You have to know your
Spirit. Once that beautiful personality is

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:18.100
developed within you, people will know that
you are Spirit.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:24.340
If you think less, every work you will do
will be good. I have seen, you ask somebody

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:31.250
to connect one, say, pipe to another pipe,
they cannot. There will be leakage, there

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.220
will be some problem, because you are not
connecting it without thinking. You see Douglas

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:40.059
has that, now, capacity: he doesn’t think.
You have seen how much he has improved. He

00:26:40.059 --> 00:26:47.140
doesn’t think much, he just does, and that’s
why he’s come up in Sahaja Yoga. Though

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:54.340
he had gone down very much, he knows that
very well. But how, by not thinking, he has

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.070
come up!

00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:02.200
You people are over-developed so try to stop
your brain acting any more and just make it

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:09.860
humbler. All these, you see, ideas of hippyism
and all that, is actually the consciousness,

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:15.200
awareness, of this overdeveloped mind. But
just by wearing dresses, or living like hippies,

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:22.519
or by taking drugs, you cannot stop this brain
thinking. Sahaja Yoga is the only way, and

00:27:22.519 --> 00:27:25.059
balancing yourself.

00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:32.840
Also, there are many other things which help
you. For example, physical things – you

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.779
must learn dieting. What diet is needed for
that, what exercise is needed for what kind

00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:39.000
of a thing. Get to it!

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.059
Now I am going away for a month, you have
to work it out. Actually, unless and until

00:27:44.059 --> 00:27:48.919
you impress others whom you are addressing
or whom you are going to meet with that kind

00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:57.059
of love and that kind of serenity, nobody
is going to believe! Secondly, what impresses

00:27:57.059 --> 00:28:09.460
people the most? Do you know that? What does
it impress, even if it is false, impresses

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:22.190
people very much? Simplicity. Simplicity of
character, of talking of dressing up, simplicity.

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:28.990
Even, say, if you are a dandily dressed person,
people know you are dandily dressed. Even

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:33.950
if you are say wearing a jean and making a
thing as if you do not care for a suit and

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:42.679
all that, still you are trying to impose something.
But if you just wear a normal, simple dress,

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:52.090
you dress up in a simple way, absolutely in
a normal way, people are amazed at you: how

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.840
can you be that normal, simple?

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:03.750
And the second thing that impresses people
is what you have sacrificed for Sahaja Yoga

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:09.380
or for anything that you are doing. How much
you are dedicated yourself. Not what you have

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:18.169
achieved out of it, but what you have sacrificed.
That’s very important. This second point

00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:20.620
is very important: what you have sacrificed.

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:27.080
You see, if you read what Indians write or
even you people write and all that is there

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:31.260
that: Mother has all the comfort of Her own,
She has a family of Her own, She has Her grandchildren,

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.990
but She’s still, She’s so much interested
in us. She comes here and She doesn’t mind

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:42.809
anything, and She sacrifices all Her time
all Her enjoyment for us. She enjoys our company,

00:29:42.809 --> 00:29:51.470
She wants to be with us. I have many ways
by which people get impressed, but you people:

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:57.350
try to sacrifice something out of you.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:08.279
While, you have noticed that some of you have
been really parasitic. This is another thing

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:15.510
which people will be shocked [about]! The
gurus also, obviously, they do not show. In

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:19.269
the beginning they will show that they are
very sacrificing, they have sacrificed their

00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:23.940
families, they are wearing a kashaya vastra
(monks clothes), they have become a sadhu

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:27.399
and they have given up everything. All these
Llamas have impressed people with that! Of

00:30:27.399 --> 00:30:33.130
course that’s falsehood, we are not going
to take to falsehood. But in our life, if

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:38.539
we are sacrificing, doing things for others,
every time if you weigh how much they have

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:41.720
done…so for example, if I start weighing,
“How much the English people have worked

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:47.590
out Sahaja Yoga compared to others?” And
then I start paying you according to what

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:55.370
you have done, giving you that much time as
it should be given to you, immediately my

00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:01.909
work will not give me satisfaction. I can’t,
I’m too sincere, I’m too genuine, I just

00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:06.279
cannot get out of my genuineness or sincerity,
I just cannot. You people have that much freedom,

00:31:06.279 --> 00:31:09.789
I don’t have any of these [freedoms], this
is my nature, I just can’t help it. Whether

00:31:09.789 --> 00:31:15.269
you come up or not, till the last breath of
My life I’ll work hard on you, but to make

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:23.120
it easier for Me and enjoyable for you, you
must try to work in a way where there’s

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:28.960
no thinking. You cannot understand me through
thinking can you? How far can you go with

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:38.299
thinking? Only you’ll go mad! So just don’t
think about it. Develop serenity within you.

00:31:38.299 --> 00:31:43.529
And no superiority complex is needed. You
have got realisation, others will also get

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:48.380
it. Maybe others may be better than you are
today.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:53.090
You will see that dignity and serenity coming
in to you once you realise that you are the

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:59.130
Spirit. Realisation never means that, from
your brain. You see, with my brain if I ‘realise’

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:04.470
that I’m the queen of England, I cannot
become! I have to realise within me, means

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:12.850
it must actualise within me that I am the
queen. It’s an actualisation, it’s not

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:21.360
just thinking, just believing into something.
It is the nature, the very nature, it should

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:29.970
become because actually you are the Spirit,
your nature is the Spirit. You are nothing

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.130
but the Spirit.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:37.590
The time has come for all the manifestation
of the Spirit, and all these superficial and

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:45.559
silly, stupid things that you are doing through
your brain: drop it out! Do not waste your

00:32:45.559 --> 00:32:54.950
energy. There isn’t much time left.

00:32:54.950 --> 00:33:03.630
And with this I would like to bless you all
that you develop that serenity within you

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:11.429
and that affection and honour and respect
for yourself, and become that. The way I honour

00:33:11.429 --> 00:33:17.820
you honour yourself and love yourself and
understand yourself.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:31.639
May God bless you all.

00:33:31.639 --> 00:33:34.820
In India they’ll say, ‘Suck in the vibrations’.
Now you will say, “Well, how to suck?”

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:42.330
Just become thoughtless, it will go in! Just
become thoughtless it will go in. Just try

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:50.120
to be thoughtless, you’ll imbibe it. If
the thoughts are coming from ego, just tell

00:33:50.120 --> 00:34:00.269
them, “Be humble, be humble, be humble,
” and they’ll disappear. Because your

00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:08.929
brain cannot suggest anything to you, sensible.
Only your Spirit can manifest. Just tell your

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:17.800
mind, “Be humble.” The this relativity
will go away that you have to be unique, you

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:23.990
are some higher soul and something. All that
is nonsense. You have to be the Whole, you

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:25.780
have to be in the centre.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:31.030
You see, what happens is that you are in a
centre, moving in this direction, alright?

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:36.929
Like that. In the centre. And once you try
to go to anything extraordinary you go like

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:44.149
a tangent outside. You see, you keep to the
centrifugal force or I can say the centripetal

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:49.419
force. There’s also a centrifugal force
acting. Now when you try to go out, anywhere,

00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:55.319
try to do something exceptional or better
and all that, and try to show off or in anyway

00:34:55.319 --> 00:35:03.099
you try to come out from the whole, you just
go like a tangent: and in such a big way that

00:35:03.099 --> 00:35:14.160
you are amazed how you are left out! And such
people then go out of circulation.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:42.520
Better now. Don’t think!

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:47.720
But some people do not even soak there feet
in the water, do not even meditate. I mean,

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.450
I don’t know how they are Sahaja Yogis,
I just can’t understand. Every day you must

00:35:51.450 --> 00:36:00.770
soak your feet in the water! Every morning
you must beat yourself with shoes. This is

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:09.750
a ritual of Sahaja Yoga. But if you do not
do it you should not also be killing yourself

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:15.140
for that but if you have a chance do it, because
that’s how you cleanse. That’s a part.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:23.319
Not by thinking that I’ve done soaking of
my feet! I was amazed that some people just

00:36:23.319 --> 00:36:27.750
do not soak their feet even do not meditate
at all, don’t do anything. And they are

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.800
supposed to be Sahaja Yogis. You see, Sahaja
Yogis are to be decided by the Divine, not

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.630
by if you become ‘members’ of Sahaja Yoga
[that] you become Sahaja Yogis. It is to be

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:40.150
decided by Divine.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:49.950
People think that, whatever we do, we are
Sahaja Yogis. You do not become Sahaja Yogis

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:55.000
at all, those who do not meditate. This is
our way of life. You see, as in Islamic rules

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.060
there are that there are Shariat is. Shariat
means the style of life. This is our way of

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:05.359
life, is to keep ourselves cleansed, how we
cleanse ourself, this is bathing ourselves,

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:12.099
our, all those things that are filthy within
us to take them out and do it. That’s the

00:37:12.099 --> 00:37:17.960
main thing. Then you’ll be amazed that you
won’t be wasting your energy in, say, doing

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.430
your work. You’ll be doing your work much
better because you are wasting all your energy

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.099
through your brains.

00:37:24.099 --> 00:37:32.869
Then I don’t have to give explanations,
once you become the Spirit. You just enjoy.

00:37:32.869 --> 00:37:42.589
Alright? It’s good now, it’s working out
let it settle down, let your attention be

00:37:42.589 --> 00:38:08.270
on the Spirit.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:39:19.240
hmm. Just watch. Agya is too much. Can you
take from My Agya, right. Thinking you see,

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:48.300
is the main point is: too much! Will you go
into a ? or something. Better thing would

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.440
be.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:40:05.380
Gone up to here. It’s stuck here!

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:37.160
You see, your thinking is reducing now. Try
to watch your thoughts. Hold each other’s

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:44.640
hands and one hand should be outside. Should
be left loose one hand. And what you can do

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:59.290
is to hold her hand, one hand, and one hand…Good.
Better, thinking is going down.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:05.000
Agya is so sticky.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:17.450
You can’t open the door here is it? Yes,
you try to open. What sort of arrangements

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:26.290
they have made here? This is all thinking
process! Open the door, it’s quite warm

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:29.930
today, very warm, open it!

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:54.260
What has happened to Cooly, why is he getting
into such a big ego?

00:41:54.260 --> 00:42:00.740
Sahaja Yogi: He could have come earlier but
he’s trying to…

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:06.640
Shri Mataji: I know, he’s trying to avoid
me now. You see, this is the problem. He has

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:16.670
ego and you have ego too. You were having
a fight? You don’t join hands with him,

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:22.910
he’ll be alright. He has been neglecting
his work. If you are not properly working,

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:34.089
why will people accept you? You must show
more sincerity about work and involvement

00:42:34.089 --> 00:42:39.530
into it. If you do not think you will do it
better. Cooly never used to do that. Now suddenly,

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:52.800
I don’t know what has happened to him. He
has started thinking too much. Don has really

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:59.119
not done good to him. Don, please try to now
be kind to him and bring him round ,alright?

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:07.670
He’s a very old Sahaja Yogi and he should
not be just gone out of the circulation.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:17.990
If you don’t work…you see, if you are
a good worker then anybody would think, nobody

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:23.400
would allow you to get out. On the contrary
they’ll say, “Please work for us” But

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:30.119
if you are a bad worker they’ll find ways
and methods of throwing you out. Same in Sahaja

00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:35.200
Yoga. If you are genuine, you are simple.
God knows [that] you are alright, you’ll

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:42.640
be there. If not He’ll thrown you out. He
knows everything. You’ll go out. You’ll

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.550
be amazed how you’ll be thrown out.

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:52.559
You are not to fight with each other. And
try to understand that unless and until you

00:43:52.559 --> 00:43:59.220
work with complete devotion [and] dedication
nobody’s going to accept you for any work

00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:03.170
whatsoever. All those people who have come
up, even in work field, have been doing things

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:30.059
properly. If you try to pull him out John,
you are his friend.

00:44:30.059 --> 00:44:34.359
Try to help each other by telling, “Don’t
lose temper, don’t get angry, everything

00:44:34.359 --> 00:44:42.160
will be alright. Take it easy.” On the contrary
if one person says [to] another one things,

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:57.910
another one says at a louder voice.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:04.160
You all have not yet know your self-esteem,
that’s the main point is. You see, because,

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.809
if you are born say in a royal family, you
would have had some sort of a self-esteem

00:45:09.809 --> 00:45:15.050
which was artificial. Now you are not born
in that kind of family, you are normal people

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:20.660
ordinary families. So what? You can be born
anywhere. Christ was born in a manger. So

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:29.980
what? He never lost his self-esteem. How can
Sahaja Yogis fight for like this? I didn’t

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:41.619
like it, tell Cooly, and be sober down and
be humble. Don’t take the laws of God into

00:45:41.619 --> 00:45:52.930
your hands. Do not fight. Alright?

00:45:52.930 --> 00:46:07.700
Where is Peter? Where is he gone? All ego.
Where is he, Peter?

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:19.250
Sahaja yogi: He’s gone upstairs Mother for
something or other.

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:31.550
Shri Mataji: Just call him. Get him here.
Very egoistical fellow. He’ll get out of

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:42.160
the circulation very soon. At the time when
people are meditating what is he doing upstairs?

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:45.740
And he wants to be the leader of the people!

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:52.720
Peter Pierce: Yes Mother?

00:46:52.720 --> 00:47:11.559
Shri Mataji: Sit down, and hold the hands
of people! And you must soak your feet every

00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:17.720
day, and when you are meditating….you better
sit here. And all those who have to be Sahaja

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.819
Yogis and have to live in this ashram have
to soak there feet every night, and have to

00:47:21.819 --> 00:47:32.210
meditate! Because your egos pass from each
other. It’s contamination, complete contamination.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:44.170
Try to humble down. Now take it. Let it pass
out. Such a lot of ego you can’t imagine.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:52.730
See. See that? ‘Huk, huk, huk, huk’ it’s
going on!

00:47:52.730 --> 00:48:00.140
You just say that, “Mother, you are our
ego. You are the ego.” I am, you are not.

00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:08.349
You don’t do anything. That will solve the
problem. “We don’t do anything, you do

00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:23.890
everything,” You say like that otherwise
it will not. Be humble. And that’s why there

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:28.180
are no emotions, nothing. Just talk, talk,
talk, talk, talk!!! No feelings, nothing comes

00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:28.490
up.

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:44.630
Be humble! Be humble in your heart.

00:48:44.630 --> 00:49:15.710
Ah, it’s stuck up all here. See? Somebody
come in I don’t know. It’s all hot. See?

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:25.440
See that? Sickening, absolutely. And that’s
how you catch then Ekadesha Rudra. You know,

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:30.309
when ego develops too much you become Ekadesha
Rudra problem and that’s the thing which

00:49:30.309 --> 00:50:00.020
sets in the real place for cancer.

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:25.270
Now don’t worry and think that…when I
said ‘cancer’ everybody starts thinking,

00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:32.220
“Have I got?” None of you can have! You
see, I know what you think all the time: real

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:50.140
foolish things, nothing sensible! If you get
cancer, do you think I’ll rest in peace?

00:50:50.140 --> 00:51:06.480
Hmm, see? See how much ego and useless activity
and the smoke of this horrible ego in the

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:20.210
brain. Such a lot, still sticking on.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:47.339
See your liver is nourished.

00:51:47.339 --> 00:52:16.430
What you have to surrender is your ego, means
your thinking. If you are thinking open your

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:24.599
eyes and say “I forgive, I forgive”. You
see, to neutralise your thoughts, use mantras.

00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:36.430
“Oh Mother, I forgive” even if you take
My name is sufficient, it can take out your…Taking

00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:50.530
My name is very good, helps you a lot. Hmmm,
taking My name is the best way of killing

00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:59.059
your ego I think! Aha, I can see now! You
see? In the subtle way everybody thinks that,

00:52:59.059 --> 00:53:02.660
“Mataji is also like us, so why take Her
name?”

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:09.450
Take My name, you finish your ego very nicely
on that I tell you. I am not [like you], I

00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:14.420
am very different, absolutely a different
person. I’m telling you again and again:

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:25.059
don’t be illusioned by Me. You see? I am
really an illusion, complete illusion for

00:53:25.059 --> 00:53:43.280
you, you cannot understand Me. Just take My
name and it will work out. Better? Still sticking

00:53:43.280 --> 00:54:09.619
on here! Now it’s better, isn’t it. Aah,
better? All the heat going out. It’s better.

00:54:09.619 --> 00:54:15.329
Eyesights will improve.

00:54:15.329 --> 00:54:40.599
Now on the left, it’s coming more on the
left. Hmm God bless you.

00:54:40.599 --> 00:54:48.490
Just one thing you [should] do: to see that
you don’t think.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:59.380
Is it very cold outside?

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:05.910
Yogi: Yes Mother

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:28.480
Shri Mataji: Are you sure? Phillip, when is
Bala going to Singapore?

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.150
Phillip: I’m not sure Mother.

00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:36.170
Shri Mataji: You find out. Alright? Tell him
to give Me a phone before I leave because

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:39.900
I have to give him addresses of people whom
he has to meet in Singapore.

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:40.390
Phillip: Yes

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:44.589
Shri Mataji: Because I’ll go away on Thursday.
Tell him to come and see Me before that.

00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:46.960
Phillip: Before this Thursday?

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.740
Shri Mataji: Hmmm

00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:49.720
Phillip: Yes Mother

00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:59.440
Shri Mataji: Means must be Wednesday or something
if he can come. Haa. See? It’s clearing out. Better?

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:19.320
Do not condemn yourself you see, there should
be cheerfulness that it’s clearing out….
