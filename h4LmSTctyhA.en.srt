1
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,010
The guru has to be like a full moon

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,860
means completely grown

3
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,590
completely matured

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
There are sixteen

5
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:32,220
kalas or the phases of the Moon and when the complete

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,040
purnima comes in the full moon day all the sixteen kalas are completed.

7
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,000
You also know that in the Vishuddhi Chakra

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,480
there are sixteen sub plexuses.

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,420
When

10
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,690
Krishna

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:59,150
Is described at Virata. He is called as Sampurna - the complete incarnation of Vishnu's aspect,

12
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,460
because he has got the sexteen

13
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,110
phases completely done.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,420
so today's number is 16. 6 + 1= 7

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,410
Now we have to understand the importance of Guru.

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,630
Why should we have a Guru when we have God?

17
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,510
We have got Shakti then why should we have a Guru? What is the need to have a Guru?

18
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:44,930
Guru means the weight.

19
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,180
We get our weight

20
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:58,640
from the magnetic forces of the Gravity of the Mother Earth.

21
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,480
So Guru means Gravity - a Gravity in a  person.

22
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,940
Why do we need a Guru?

23
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,900
because to know God

24
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,690
Is easy, especially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him.

25
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:39,930
As soon as you get your self-realization in Sahaja Yoga - the modern Sahaja Yoga - immediately you become

26
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,790
entitled to give realizations to other.

27
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,440
It was said that guru is the person who makes you meet the divine.

28
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:04,440
But it is not true because any self-realised person in the Sahaja Yoga

29
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,360
can raise the Kundalini and can give self-realization to others immediately after

30
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,470
they have touched the Sahasrara - opened the Sahasrara.

31
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,060
But normally a realized soul cannot do it.

32
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:25,630
Any born realized soul cannot do it on its own. It has to have authority of Me, and I am today.

33
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:34,600
That's why it was said that Guru is a person who makes you meet God. He raises the Kundalini and

34
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
makes you one with God.

35
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,310
Because in those days

36
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,770
when the Gurus were self-realized

37
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,470
when the Gurus were self-realised

38
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,790
they had the authority and power

39
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,920
of raising the Kundalini only after they have reached a very great

40
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,840
state of evolution: complete purification, complete detachment...

41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:24,470
So it was not possible for people to give realization when they just touched

42
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,850
realised thinking.

43
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,170
Most of the gurus in the olden days started by first cleansing the people.

44
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,930
First cleanse them one by one, raise the Kundalini, brought it to every Chakras,

45
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:53,510
and then gave them realization. It was a different technique altogether.  You can say it was a bullock cart technique.

46
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:04,290
That's why one Mantra was given for a particular Chakra where was the problem where the Kundalini was stopping.

47
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,870
For about, some people used to get it even for ten years they would work out on one chakra.

48
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,030
I have known people who have been working on Agnya for ten years, twenty years.

49
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,560
But you know in Sahaja Yoga we clear it out just like that.

50
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,670
That has something to do with your particular ?? and ??.

51
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:35,930
So the first conception that a person who makes you meet God is the

52
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,410
guru has to be a little bit advanced.

53
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,490
Because for you now it’s the child’s play to raise the Kundalini and

54
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,170
make them one with the Divine.

55
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,920
But still you don’t become guru in the Sahaja Yoga terminology.

56
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,050
Even if you have vikalpas, you have doubts, about Sahaja Yoga still you can do it if you raise your hand.

57
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:10,440
Even when your chitta, attention, is not clear cut still you can do it. You can still do it.

58
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
How? How it has worked out that way,

59
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,620
so beautifully?

60
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:36,810
It has worked out, I would say, at this stage only. Maybe later on I will tell you. But its pure

61
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,180
Divine, which is not contaminated by whatever state you may be in, its flowing:

62
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
absolutely pure Divine.

63
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,320
With others it was different, they had to cleanse it, clear it out.

64
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,730
As an instrument you are perfect,

65
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,230
but as a guru you are not.

66
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,750
Whatever may be your defects

67
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,910
or whatever you maybe lacking, you raise your hand and the Kundalini will rise,

68
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,370
On your fingers it is going to move.

69
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
You get tremendous power.

70
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,810
You can ask anyone,

71
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,140
they’ll tell you they are surprised. They are jealous of you.

72
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,680
They can’t understand that how, by raising your fingers, that you are perfect instruments.

73
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,990
Because you are created by somebody really perfect.

74
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
But you are not perfect gurus:

75
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:59,110
that one has to understand. And that is why you need a guru to tell you all that, what is the perfection.

76
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,570
Now as I have told you, that guru means gravity.

77
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,630
You cannot say

78
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,150
where is the axis of

79
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,290
Mother Earth is? You cannot see it. I mean you cannot see it, you cannot feel it.

80
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,690
But they say there is an axis on which the Mother Earth rotates.

81
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,780
There is an energy

82
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
It's an energy on which this Mother Earth rotates.

83
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,260
In the same way you have an axis,

84
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,740
which is your Sushumna,

85
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,230
which gives you the gravity.

86
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,110
The first

87
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,390
important thing

88
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,430
for a guru is

89
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,440
that your gravity point is one.

90
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,910
Everything centres on gravity.

91
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,810
Unless and until

92
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,250
Your attention is completely

93
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,560
fixed on to that gravity point within you

94
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,570
— which is called as dhrugva,is a fixed point —

95
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,640
ou cannot become a guru.

96
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,090
So the gravity in you comes to you

97
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,070
by clearing your attention, by looking at your attention where does it go?

98
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,600
How do you reach your gravity point?

99
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,990
or anything

100
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,010
that has a gravity point? How do we discover it? We go on balancing it,

101
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,770
and when the balance is complete, that time we say this is the gravity point.

102
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,560
In the same way your attention should hold your gravity point in complete balance.

103
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,180
So the first thing is that you should be a balanced person.

104
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,820
But a balanced person

105
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
is not a fixed person,

106
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
he is not rigid. But

107
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,620
But an imbalanced person is a person who runs here, there,

108
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:21,150
there, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga: running after this, running after that, running after that. Such a person

109
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
cannot achieve much.

110
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,590
Fix your gravity points, the balancing point, with Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,430
That is much [more] important

112
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,200
than knowing anything else. First of all fix your gravity point

113
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,530
then you will be amazed that,

114
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,140
whatever you see apart from Sahaj Yoga,

115
00:11:53,780 --> 00:12:01,300
in the light of Sahaja Yoga, you will realise that, how it relates to Sahaja Yog

116
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,150
as it relates to you gravity point.

117
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,100
Say it is against it, still you will see where it is against.

118
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,960
If it is for it, you will see where it is for. For example you will read books:

119
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,670
immediately you will know what is the truth, what is not the truth.

120
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,000
But if you do not have that point fixed or

121
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,410
attained,

122
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,430
then you will be slipping down this side or that side. Anything else can attract you, you can slip down from Truth.

123
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,200
So that point has to be fixed first of all within yourselves:

124
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
dhruvapada as they call it;

125
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,070
the position of the fixed point

126
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,670
from which we understand that everything radiates from it,

127
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:03,520
everything is controlled from here. The light within us by which we see what is darkness and what is

128
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
reality

129
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,350
But do all this,

130
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,690
even if you glorify and say all the names and chant everything, it has no meaning

131
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,780
unless and until you develop discipline about it.

132
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,280
Discipline is the sthai bhav or you can say the

133
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,260
emotion of permanence

134
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,760
for a guru state, guru seva, or for becoming a guru.

135
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,300
You must discipline your body, discipline your mind, discipline yourself.

136
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:06,610
Sahaja Yoga is such a simple thing to have: I mean you are just connected with me.

137
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:16,300
But you are not a guru. So how do you discipline yourself? Some people have awkward way in their bodies,

138
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,790
then they should get to it, that they have a proper way in their body.

139
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,370
Mould your body. It is not to torture your body but to master your body.

140
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:43,510
For example, I would not say that you go and sit in the cold ice water. Its wrong,

141
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:53,320
to freeze yourself and make your bones horrible. But you must do all that is required to give you a supple body

142
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,400
and a body that can live under any circumstances.

143
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,710
A little bit of course you have to exert also,

144
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,300
that you should be able to sit on the ground properly,

145
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,030
that you should be able to sleep on the ground properly.

146
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,530
There should be no problem about these things. You have to discipline.

147
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,220
Sahaja Yoga is a real blessing, but can be sometimes a blessing in disguise.

148
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,610
If you take it for granted

149
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,250
you will drift out, you wont go very further.

150
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,340
So the body should be such that it should be able to take lot of load upon itself,

151
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
should be able to do a lot of work.

152
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,250
This is for you to decide about your own body.

153
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:59,090
Now you see your gurus body how it is:

154
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:05,010
I take lot of work out of my body. I can work for hours together.

155
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,390
I can keep awake for hours together.

156
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,930
I’ll never

157
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
even once

158
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,830
ay that my body is no good.

159
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
It’s such a nice friend I have.

160
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,610
But there is a very great tapasya state, penance we have to have,

161
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,390
tremendous penance.

162
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,850
Because this is a human body

163
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:44,500
which had to work out lots of things. You know at the time of Rama, He had to walk bare feet all the way.

164
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,720
He was a King and He had to live in a hut.

165
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,350
So do not be dominated by luxuries and comforts.

166
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,610
I do not mean to say that you unnecessarily

167
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,180
torture your body, that’s not the point at all. Because I must bring the balancing point, always.

168
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:14,150
But do not pamper your body that it becomes a hurdle for your penance.

169
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,690
Keep your body clean,

170
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,660
respect your body,

171
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,430
and it will be very happy when it will know that you have used it for the Divine purpose.

172
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,040
There’s an Indian word for which we call it: a ‘bhaitak’ here.

173
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:47,740
I don’t know, there is no English equal to that. But bhaitak means the power to sit:

174
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,900
that’s the gravity within you.

175
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,620
How long can you sit in one posture,

176
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,630
what is your bhaitak. Like any studies or anything they’ll ask, “What is your bhaitak?”

177
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,800
“Have you got the bhaitak?” Is the power to be seated on one point:

178
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,560
how long you can sit

179
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,990
continuously.

180
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:24,270
That is how you judge your gravity. Unless and until you have a bhaitak you cannot be a guru.

181
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,510
So the body is to be brought round properly.

182
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,520
It has to be disciplined. It’s no question of becoming thin or fat, but the body should be such that you should be able to

183
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,640
use it for your purpose as a guru.

184
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,950
Sometimes, you will find you can’t sleep on the ground:

185
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,490
then you [should] sleep on the ground for three, four days, then the body will be very happy.

186
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,660
It will pain [for] one or two days.

187
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,880
But do not insult your body.

188
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
This is the other side of the discipline:

189
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,190
we don’t take our bath, we don’t keep ourselves all right.

190
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,590
Then you are insulting your body. Look after it.

191
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,790
You may have to

192
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
look after its softness,

193
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,070
the gentleness of the body. Treat it with respect.

194
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,670
By becoming barbaric you are insulting your body.

195
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,470
so the body

196
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,230
is very important, this is made of five elements,

197
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,340
and all these five elements within us, as gurus,

198
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,020
has to be sparkling.

199
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,180
I can go on like this but now you think about it: in future, what have you to do with your body.

200
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,480
How you are going to use the five elements

201
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,840
within your body, to cleanse them, make then beautiful so that your light sparkles.

202
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,620
The gravity comes to you in your body this way:

203
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
that

204
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,220
you start generating your power or your principle of gurutva,

205
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,860
principle of your mastery, through this point of your gravity.

206
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,920
The second point is your attention should have that gravity.

207
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,880
Your attention is very important.

208
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
A person who is easily disturbed

209
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,330
is not a deep person.

210
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,310
Or easily taken to something, like say emotions.

211
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:15,760
Or easily to some other, say, intellectual pursuit.

212
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,110
As gurus there will be temptations for you

213
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:33,690
People will be challenging your state. A person comes out with a very big intellectual ‘truth’ or something,

214
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,250
then immediately you feel challenged about it and you will say, “All right let me handle the situation.”

215
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,460
Handle it at the Sahaja Yoga point, on your gravity.

216
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,970
Just sit down on your gravity and see for yourself.

217
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,930
Immediately you will know how to handle the situation. You need not talk to that person, you’ll handle the situation all right:

218
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,910
not on [the] intellectual level but on your gravity.

219
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:07,560
If the attention has the gravity, it pulls down the ego and the superego of other people.

220
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,980
Then you will not be frustrated or frantic.

221
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,550
also, if you can

222
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,300
start from the outside it may work out with human beings;

223
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,990
like

224
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,790
Like study your behaviour how you behave towards others.

225
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,660
Or study your attention how it behaves towards

226
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,730
outside:

227
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,990
what attracts your attention,

228
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,480
what attracts your attention. Study your attention.

229
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,580
By that study you will be able to fix your attention

230
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,360
in its maryada, in its boundaries.

231
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,210
Once you put the boundaries to

232
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,180
the attention then the depth starts developing.

233
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:19,640
The person who has no boundaries can never have depth, he will be spreading just like that, always;

234
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,050
no depth at all.

235
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,190
So you have to put boundaries by understanding your attention,

236
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,920
that, “No not more than that.” “All right not more than that.”

237
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,200
Like some people in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, they get interested in a patient,

238
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,700
then for them that patient becomes important.

239
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,630
Or get interested in some person that he must get Realisation: “my mother,” “my father,” “my, my” .

240
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,780
And all the time they are talking about it: “my jobs,”

241
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,080
“my clothes,” some sort of a ‘my’.

242
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:08,020
And they don’t know how to draw the line. You must know where to draw the line, is maryadas.

243
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,750
Otherwise the whole thing will fritter away. You will become a frivolous person. There won’t be any gravity in you.

244
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,140
So you must know how far to go with a person when you are dealing as a guru,

245
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,830
then you are a master.

246
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,360
But if you do not know where to draw the line, you may be crossing the line and getting into his clutches.

247
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:54,700
So the best way to handle the situation is to get into thoughtless awareness,

248
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,020
again and again and again and again, and you establish that clearly.

249
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,830
Now, some of them complain to me that it’s not an easy thing to do.

250
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:14,090
It’s the easiest thing to do, if you give up all other

251
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,630
useless things that you are doing.

252
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,910
And then gravity will give you the wisdom to do the right thing at the right time.

253
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:38,670
Ashram is a place where one has to learn to be a guru. But I find it is not always a good experiment for people.

254
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:45,780
Once they have an ashram they take it for granted. They think, “This is the place for us to nicely come and live and

255
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,110
and some people will work, some will be enjoying.

256
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,190
Some will pay some will not pay.

257
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:07,310
It’s most surprising. You must immediately find out the person who really has the spiritual authority

258
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,770
and try to follow that person.

259
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,220
And instead of that we try to meet up with people who are of lower spiritual authority.

260
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:28,180
And [if] he sleeps till nine o’clock, everybody sleeps! In an ashram nobody should sleep after six o’clock: is an absolute thing.

261
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,060
Absurd!

262
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,790
You must sleep early and get up early. Otherwise you can stay outside.

263
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,070
You all must get up at six o’clock. Do you know what time your Mother gets up?

264
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:58,840
And what I find: nobody is up here.

265
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,500
In India they all get up very early. But I find nobody is up here and my attention is all wasted.

266
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,990
And you don’t realise

267
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,960
how important all these things are. This is the training time for you.

268
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:27,780
For this you are born, you have been seeking this for ages now. You have got it now, you must discipline yourself.

269
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,500
But I have seen in ashramas where people pay a big amount, they get up at six o’clock, 4  o’clock, 3  o’clock.

270
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:46,670
Because in Sahaja Yoga everything has to come from you. This is the style it is.

271
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,100
At the most I can ask people who are not all right, to go out for a while,

272
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,970
and then the join ashram. That helps some people.

273
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:01,490
But not more than that; because I am also a Mother though I am a Guru.

274
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:08,970
It is you who should mature yourself. You’ll mature much faster than [if] I force things on you.

275
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,690
Finding faults with others but not with yourself.

276
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,010
You must have

277
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:26,810
a discipline, a time in the morning to get up, do little a puja or something. At least spend half an hour, all of you together.

278
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,660
You should be ready by 6 or 6.30, sit down,

279
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:43,040
do meditation. I have to lay down rules for you now, because you do not want to lay it down.

280
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,640
I am also amazed that many people do not know even my aarti, after so many years, by heart.

281
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,940
That is what Sahaja Yoga is, because it’s a Mahamaya.

282
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,770
So you have to learn it yourself.

283
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,530
You have to do it yourself.

284
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:14,260
It’s easy to talk about Sahaja Yoga, very simple: stand up and talk. Because you have heard from your Mother, your talk.

285
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,100
But it will have no impression on another person!

286
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,980
It will fritter away.

287
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,920
Because it must come from your centre of gravity.

288
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,610
This is the greatest thing you can do to yourself:

289
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,780
is to discipline yourself fully

290
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:52,430
And compete in disciplining yourself; and make your body all right, your attention correct

291
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:04,000
Attention is corrected by many ways. As I said: watch your attention, where does it go.

292
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,520
Now

293
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,670
what else are we going to talk but Sahaja Yoga?

294
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:19,360
Is there anything more beautiful or more interesting,

295
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:22,340
more manifesting than Sahaja Yoga is?

296
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,040
And what is the job of a guru?

297
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:33,550
Is nothing but to expose the Parabrahma Itself, the whole working of the Divine; that is the job of a guru.

298
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,890
To expose the complete working of the

299
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,130
Parabrahma

300
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,850
is the job of a guru in the modern times, not only raising the Kundalini.

301
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:54,080
But after raising the Kundalini you should be able to tell all about the Divine powers and everything.

302
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,170
For that you have to learn, you have to read, you have to understand.

303
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,150
Do you understand now the difference between the old gurus and modern gurus?

304
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:14,780
Because they were brought with such tremendous discipline and hardly one or two used to be great gurus.

305
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,800
They went through such

306
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,870
studies and such interrogations and examination and tests

307
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,360
that by the time they were 75 or so they became gurus.

308
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,090
But we have to do it quick and the best way is to do it yourself.

309
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,090
Perhaps the tradition of the Western countries do not give you much

310
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,670
impetus for disciplining. That’s called cutting out yourself perhaps.

311
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,690
But a disciplined person

312
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,420
is the only one who can be a Sahaj Yogi.

313
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,990
Spontaneity

314
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,570
works best in a disciplined person.

315
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,430
A disciplined person is the one who knows the technique,

316
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:26,490
and the energy is the spontaneity. But a person who is frittered away what will spontaneity do with it?

317
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,670
It cannot work it out;

318
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,250
the instrument is so horrible.

319
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:38,210
So you discipline yourselves so that others would be disciplined by your behaviour.

320
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:49,700
Once you have disciplined yourself, when you become a guru, you have certain privileges as a master.

321
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,190
And

322
00:32:55,190 --> 00:33:00,270
It was used as a weapon by many masters before, you need do that.

323
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:03,450
I am just telling you as a side issue — is the temper.

324
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,230
All the gurus had tremendous temper.

325
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,070
It was expected of the guru.

326
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,870
Like I would tell you about Allauddin Khan Sahib

327
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,010
who was a great musician, was the master of Ravi Shankar and all these people.

328
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,150
And my father was the political advisor to this

329
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,840
Maharaja of Maihar. And we went down there, I was there also.

330
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:40,350
That time Ravi Shankar was an artist was playing a little bit here and there.

331
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,630
I mean he was quite a good artist still.

332
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,910
So his guru had a great respect for my father. He used to treat my father very great reverence.

333
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,830
So he was playing something,

334
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,720
he was very good at Mridangam.

335
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,120
So he played the Mridangam for

336
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:14,650
my father. So in that day the tune or the lehara is there, the tune one has to play, the simple tune; just to play the mridangam, to be played on that (as an accompaniment).

337
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,200
So my father asked Ravi Shankar to play [missing text see transcript]

338
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,820
and at the slightest [mistake] they will take up this and hit you, you see.

339
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,610
So people used to be very careful.

340
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,440
If they were sitting near the stone.

341
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,130
The people would stay away from them

342
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,360
They would throw stones. They’ll keep a chimta, big chimta like this.

343
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,970
Anybody coming near them they would hit them.

344
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,400
At the slightest thing they gave a chimta to a disciple.

345
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,440
It was a long thing, you know, made out of iron and a chimta is a double pronged thing. And they would hit the person, “Tham!” like this.

346
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,860
It was the situation

347
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:02,240
before I came in here as your guru. It is difficult to be a guru and a Mother, I cannot do both things together!

348
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,100
But that was the situation, even those great artist today

349
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:13,850
who are playing great things like you’ll hear now Vilayat Khan Sahib: you go and ask him about his guru, how much time he was beaten up,

350
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,760
absolutely beaten up

351
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,310
any swara they did wrong was: absolute chastity, absolute discipline.

352
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,350
If the guru said, “Five o’clock tomorrow,” even if guru comes or not, five o’clock you have to be there.

353
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,030
For any art

354
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,310
in the Indian style was like that,

355
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,000
complete discipline

356
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,310
Without discipline not even education was imparted:

357
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,540
terrible taskmasters.

358
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,420
And that’s what they used which you need not here in Sahaja Yoga.

359
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,590
There is no need to use temper in Sahaja Yoga

360
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:07,950
because I have not given you, imparted, any knowledge to you with temper.

361
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,520
Perhaps there could be hardly anyone who has seen me in a temper.

362
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:22,780
So that is not the way we Sahaja Yogis are going to impart knowledge to others.

363
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,470
We have to be very mild and sweet,

364
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,410
because in the pattern of your own Guru,

365
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,550
because She’s sweet,

366
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,050
She’s very mild

367
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,980
and She’s very persuasive

368
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,250
and kind. In the same way you have to be,

369
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,310
because that pattern you haven’t learned.

370
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:45,340
That’s why don’t take to that kind of a pattern where people are in a big temper and they come out with a big temper.

371
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,840
It doesn’t behove a Sahaj Yogi

372
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,620
to be like that.I mean, they had such tremendous powers also that they could just make somebody into ashes;

373
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,690
with such a temper they lived. And they had one guru

374
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,550
somewhere like

375
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,280
a Rock of Gibraltar,

376
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,610
that you face him and you hit your head. At least one or twice

377
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,390
you must have a big hitting from him, otherwise he’s not your guru.

378
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:27,890
That was the system.Now we have a great artist sitting here. You must be also remembering his guru, who must have really

379
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,110
beaten him nicely

380
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,110
before he imparted knowledge.

381
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:36,040
They said, “Without you hit and

382
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,270
chisel, you cannot make a good

383
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,740
disciple.” And this time we are going to

384
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,400
challenge that

385
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,180
and to prove that our Mother was extremely kind and still

386
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,900
we are chiseled out beautifully,

387
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:03,110
by your own chisel. That’s why I request you to do it yourself because I cannot do it as a Mother.

388
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,820
And that’s why it is

389
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,300
your responsibility

390
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,560
to do it that way.

391
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,350
Today is the day where we all have to decide that

392
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,360
we are going to be gurus now.

393
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,450
I am going to retire as a guru.

394
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,450
It’s all right to be a Mother to you people.

395
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,080
now

396
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,760
you have to be gurus of other people,

397
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,210
and for that you must know what you should achieve.

398
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,060
You have all the powers within you, you can manifest them also.

399
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,390
But you cannot have a following unless and until you become a guru.

400
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,670
This is the only difference [there] is

401
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:57,150
If you want to have a following then you must chisel out yourself in that fashion that, as soon as people see you, they  should say,

402
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
“Here is [somebody] with that gravity.”

403
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,410
I think that should be sufficient for today’s Guru puja.

404
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Only thing, the last, most important thing is,

405
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:18,550
that you cannot make a drama out of it. It has to be a reality.

406
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:27,180
By standing like a big, imposing person, you do not become that. On the contrary people will think you are mad.

407
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:38,830
It should be from within that you should develop that dignity within yourself, that poise, that balance,

408
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,100
that understanding, within yourself.

409
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,070
A kindly poise,

410
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:52,600
a beautiful personality,

411
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,090
benevolent.

412
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:01,150
But standing above everyone else by it’s gravity,

413
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,440
depth, gentlemanliness,

414
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,870
generosity,

415
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
proper bearing, neatness, cleanliness

416
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:28,580
above all, love: a heart like an ocean, most forgiving.

417
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:45,410
I am sure next year we’ll have some gurus here who have already got some disciples around them.

418
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,290
May God bless you.
