1
00:12:55,141 --> 00:13:00,656
Today is very bigger day for us,
also 'vasant panchami' is there

2
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:05,306
Again it's national day today

3
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:10,171
The people are grateful to see this day

4
00:13:10,553 --> 00:13:13,306
How many people had abandoned their life?.

5
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:20,675
How many things have happened,
but we have not yet come to that stage.

6
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:28,478
Where you know this,Yes,
the country is of great

7
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:34,986
importance,People have
won the sacrifice.

8
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:39,575
Even when we called up
the rebellion in this

9
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,780
country, Gandhiji thought
that this country's

10
00:13:46,856 --> 00:13:50,502
That which is real wealth,
it is spiritual.

11
00:13:50,477 --> 00:13:54,224
Self-power is not violent
but non-violence, and

12
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:57,995
therefore they will make
all over non-violence.

13
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:02,242
We have won the country for
without any violence

14
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:06,447
When this happened,
we do not realize that

15
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:10,273
Now this is what we have
earned so much wealth,

16
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:14,619
Yes, that's what we keep,
Yes, you has got diamonds

17
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:17,381
In Which sacrifice to fit?

18
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:23,476
So that's what it's sacrificing
They must be of this soil

19
00:14:23,293 --> 00:14:30,295
Whatever the sacrifice of this soil,
They have sacrificed themselves.

20
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,983
You have nothing else to do.

21
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:34,809
What is the main thing in
this country,that is, all the

22
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:37,484
space that is the element,the
power of self, it is..

23
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:41,985
That should be discarded on self-power.

24
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:46,896
As long as the sacrifice of independence
will not be put on self-centeredness,

25
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,795
The welfare of this country will not be there

26
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:54,792
But for that, we should create such a people,
which has received this self-discipline.

27
00:14:54,916 --> 00:15:01,416
But I still see that the people that got self-conscious
Who has gained self-confidence

28
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:10,685
They are still playing very tightly and
are living with a very frantic situation.

29
00:15:11,152 --> 00:15:16,408
The kind of thing that has happened to
me is so troubled me yesterday

30
00:15:16,143 --> 00:15:20,391
I have decided that I do not want to
talk about that anymore.

31
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,366
Relations,How did it come?

32
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:27,614
We say relation come in Maharashtra.

33
00:15:27,614 --> 00:15:30,866
Brothers kill you after one another

34
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:34,120
Something bothered, what happened to it?

35
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:36,988
That's because we took addiction.

36
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:40,057
You might be surprised if
you add some additives to

37
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:42,733
Vishuddhi chakra,
you do not have any kind of wisdom.

38
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,642
He does not live nicely.

39
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:50,643
He lied and did not think he had
missed anything even though he did

40
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:56,396
This addiction has grown so much in
our country and it's on such a large scale,

41
00:15:56,396 --> 00:16:00,895
People do not notice that they are suffering,

42
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:04,398
People say so many lies about.

43
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,645
They are behaving so badly.

44
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:09,646
And so much lies are in the world

45
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:12,146
Yes, for the first time
to get rid of falsehood,

46
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,391
first of all should be
left with addiction.

47
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:18,711
The man who does not completely forget to addiction,
His nature will not be good.

48
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:27,211
He will do falsehood, he will do a false thing
and everything that is true will be false

49
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:32,712
So one day on this big day many
people spend their lives

50
00:16:32,712 --> 00:16:34,298
Many gave life

51
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:36,863
Many have shed their blood

52
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:44,437
From this time immemorial, we struggled for independence,
now for self-rule, to self-help

53
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:49,023
People today pledge that we will
not do any addiction anymore

54
00:16:49,023 --> 00:16:50,024
Any kind

55
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:52,022
This is not a difficult task

56
00:16:52,523 --> 00:16:55,774
I see people from foreign countries
that they are so sharp

57
00:16:55,774 --> 00:16:59,775
Once that is achieved, on the next day
it becomes free, by leaving everything,

58
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:02,529
That was not what they were

59
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:07,032
As soon as a lotus comes up in a moment,
it gets so much sweeter

60
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:09,026
But not in our country.

61
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:11,773
There are some types of activities in our country

62
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:13,403
But this is the only way,
It's gonna be there.

63
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:18,404
For ten ten years, peoples in sahajayoga
Why not make some progress?

64
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:22,903
The reason is that they have not been
able to relieve themselves of addiction.

65
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:25,402
This slavery should gone

66
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:27,369
The slaughter of addiction is that it should go.

67
00:17:27,867 --> 00:17:30,863
The second guru's slavery is very terrible to you

68
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:33,366
I met a gentleman yesterday

69
00:17:33,615 --> 00:17:35,113
They were so many years in sahajayoga.

70
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:37,368
But his master's slavery is not gone

71
00:17:37,368 --> 00:17:39,366
So they are still in trouble.

72
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:41,116
There is no one listening to these things

73
00:17:41,116 --> 00:17:42,623
Nobody would believe it.

74
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:49,112
But if your guru is wrong, then you have
seen that you are suffering from it

75
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,620
This slavery,
Should have gone

76
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,874
You should keep in mind that for slavery,
People who come from Guru.

77
00:17:56,715 --> 00:17:58,963
They are physically afflicted

78
00:17:58,963 --> 00:18:05,212
If your master can not keep your body properly,
then why should such a guru be enslaved?

79
00:18:05,716 --> 00:18:08,217
This is superstition and it is a vengeful sign.

80
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:13,328
In the vengeful symptom, Shrikrishna said,
that when a person becomes vengeful

81
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:16,827
Then some unfixed things are
pulled up completely

82
00:18:16,827 --> 00:18:19,824
That condition only believes the truth

83
00:18:22,321 --> 00:18:27,826
Suppose,one bull tie to the oil extractor poll
and put scarp on eyes,He is wandering in there

84
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:31,925
And no matter how much you told him
that he is wrong, he does not think so

85
00:18:31,925 --> 00:18:33,424
It do not go into his head

86
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:37,677
This vengeful tendency is
especially in our Maharashtra.

87
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:41,175
The reason we tell him the reason
is that we are very addicted

88
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:45,675
And the fundamentalists, in those days
we have grown up in the customs,

89
00:18:45,675 --> 00:18:48,315
You never stop that fundamental.

90
00:18:48,813 --> 00:18:53,688
Now first of all, see that you should fast now

91
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,051
Who said that? Which scripture?

92
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,055
If no one says so, no one can show.

93
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,523
If you have a passion to fast anytime.

94
00:19:01,523 --> 00:19:05,646
So whoever you wish about will be the same.

95
00:19:06,273 --> 00:19:09,395
People in our country are also starving

96
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:15,392
Why should I fast even more,
I do not understand,

97
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:18,788
If you would like to fast,then die

98
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:23,152
It seems like the future will be hungry,
want fasting, take it.

99
00:19:25,404 --> 00:19:27,152
You should only get
what you are interested in.

100
00:19:27,152 --> 00:19:31,491
When you fast,
Then let it be hungry

101
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:33,494
Then why cry?

102
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:37,760
Everything is for eat and they
do not want to eat it in the name of God

103
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,764
You should not eat it,
but eat it in the name of God

104
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:44,263
Next is the path of devotion,
the path of devotion has drawn one

105
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:46,755
But that's not the way it's going to be

106
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:48,005
It should be noted

107
00:19:49,012 --> 00:19:52,875
devotion, exclusive devotion is told by Krishna

108
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:59,376
The path of devotion is to sit on the ground,
to walk away from it

109
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,124
Dress clothes, like beggar

110
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:06,580
Going there playing the Manjeera,
And to break the head

111
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:07,706
That is called the devotional path

112
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,202
Who said this?

113
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:20,576
Dnyaneshwar did not say that you used to go to
perform 'Hare Rama' Hare, doing there.

114
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:24,324
Or do we say Vitthal Vitthal
by doing Krishna Krishna

115
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:26,577
So do not go anywhere

116
00:20:29,575 --> 00:20:31,933
Those who wrote it did not read

117
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:34,431
They did not understand
what they explained

118
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:40,306
Now it is said that, 'Aata Vishwatmake...Toshawe'.

119
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:44,061
He should show the spirit of the universe

120
00:20:44,061 --> 00:20:46,549
He should be happy

121
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:51,954
Whatever sacrifice has been offered to me,
Let's be satisfied

122
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,315
And then what to give?
Give it to Pasaydan

123
00:20:57,183 --> 00:20:58,937
This pasaydaan is given to you.

124
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:03,433
This is what the vibrations have been
given to youvthis is pasaydaan.

125
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:08,434
The dark darkness of sinful man
disappeared,did gone?

126
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,392
Those who played majeera,
Does ignorance go?

127
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:18,645
Too dry, dried, beggar
they do not have proper clothes on body.

128
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:22,392
Seeing the person coming to cry
Where did the sinful man come from?

129
00:21:22,392 --> 00:21:26,032
And say we are devotees of Shri hari !

130
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:34,882
Hey, who gave Sudama to Dwarka,
this devotee, this beggar people

131
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:39,614
Why are you people defaming Krishna?

132
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:43,612
Be a devotee of another person,Fraud Babaji's

133
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:47,863
Whose rinkle should be counted,
This type of Babaji are many

134
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,363
Devote them.

135
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,001
But why do you defame Shrikrishna?

136
00:21:53,251 --> 00:21:56,501
Where did you not read the
description of their face?

137
00:21:57,255 --> 00:21:59,750
Did not read the description of his brilliance?

138
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,251
Where he was a beggar, nobody told.

139
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:09,002
Even though cows maintained,
the crown was on the head.

140
00:22:10,002 --> 00:22:11,491
We have already heard of it ,
about dress up

141
00:22:11,491 --> 00:22:15,732
Where did you hear that he was
carrying a bush in his hands beggar ?

142
00:22:15,732 --> 00:22:18,201
Tobacco filled in drink

143
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:24,222
This is our condition

144
00:22:24,222 --> 00:22:29,122
But do not think about it,
And black ash on the head

145
00:22:29,373 --> 00:22:31,873
does he apply black ash on head

146
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:38,121
How pretty even,Turns the sandal on the head

147
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:46,171
That was his sign,even if you look around,
why do you walk around with black ash?

148
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:48,557
With those black ashes,
 it will ruin your ajnya chakra.

149
00:22:48,582 --> 00:22:52,420
The more you will be in a vengeful perspective.

150
00:22:54,585 --> 00:22:57,833
But you said that Mataji,
why do you say so?

151
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,411
That is what they want me to tell
and it should tell you

152
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:04,701
Then you got the disease
tomorrow, there were cancerous

153
00:23:04,726 --> 00:23:06,910
diseases, there were diseases
of the vishudhhi chakra

154
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,411
Diseases like this,The disease happened
That is to say,Mataji what's this?

155
00:23:10,411 --> 00:23:16,052
We are Warkaris(devotee),
that is to blame in God

156
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:19,051
This vengeful tendency should have gone

157
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:23,042
Walk through the scarf on the eye.
We are in the path of devotion

158
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,512
Hey, what's the way?

159
00:23:26,261 --> 00:23:28,514
God has said, Make exclusive devotion

160
00:23:28,514 --> 00:23:31,061
Krishna has explained it
clearly,That you will give

161
00:23:31,086 --> 00:23:33,511
me something,pamphlet,
fruit, and he will take it

162
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:36,764
But giving it clear that you should
give exclusive devotion

163
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:39,261
What else could he do?

164
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:41,261
When will exclusive devotion be?

165
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:44,741
When you walk aloud with God

166
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:46,786
When you feel confident

167
00:23:46,786 --> 00:23:49,996
Whenever you worship him,
it has something meaning

168
00:23:50,993 --> 00:23:53,983
We have such an evil
reputation of Krishna everywhere

169
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:56,981
Are doing abroad,
doing so here too.

170
00:23:57,231 --> 00:24:01,483
Where is Lord Krishna and
where are the people of Warakari(devotee).

171
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:04,708
I do not see the compilation of the two

172
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:16,785
So, whatever we are old, we want
to get the best, best of them

173
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:20,032
And that which has been imposed on us,
it should be left

174
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:24,040
In the Sahajayoga,
we are doing great devotion

175
00:24:24,532 --> 00:24:27,955
Everything happens,
but only after self-realization

176
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:29,755
Before that we did not do it.

177
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:32,506
Secondly, fasting is not what we do

178
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:35,758
If you want to fast,then do it,
Now I am fasting already

179
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:40,501
I Forever Fasting is done by your grace

180
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:43,502
No lunch, no meal in the evening

181
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:45,255
Something is going on

182
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:48,253
If you do not want me to
fast then I can do it

183
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:52,758
But even if you want to do it,
you can do it for yourself or for your body

184
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:56,003
But do not tell it as a stomach disorder

185
00:24:57,255 --> 00:25:01,757
So we need to understand that
we are going to be vigilant,

186
00:25:01,757 --> 00:25:05,004
Now we do not want to
go to the royal state

187
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:08,506
This peopole is other
it is of a political nature.

188
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:13,216
What they did not know,
what was wrong and what was good

189
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:15,218
The mistake and the good one at all

190
00:25:15,465 --> 00:25:17,966
That is, we feel that these
people are human or animals !

191
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:24,216
They do not understand this, that
they eat cabbage, that they eat shit

192
00:25:24,216 --> 00:25:28,216
He also does not understand the difference,
People are royaltyers

193
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:33,464
And if this state of the state came,
But a big question arises in him

194
00:25:33,464 --> 00:25:37,968
Because such people are
confused and completely confused

195
00:25:37,968 --> 00:25:40,038
So do not understand what
they want to explain

196
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,034
So everyone thinks,
what's wrong with this?

197
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:47,910
Now here London is a new one,
Exiting daily.

198
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:49,406
Now there's a new one

199
00:25:49,406 --> 00:25:55,405
The new one happened for four years,
That needle socks into your mouth

200
00:25:56,675 --> 00:26:03,113
If not, then insert the pin
And paint the hair and go out.

201
00:26:03,462 --> 00:26:08,114
I said, why do this? they said,
So what's wrong with this?

202
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:12,862
What's wrong with this?
Does we have any answer?

203
00:26:17,253 --> 00:26:19,506
So they do such foolishness

204
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:23,595
It does not matter if you say
anything to that stupidity

205
00:26:23,595 --> 00:26:25,592
Because they think, we all know

206
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:26,347
What's wrong or bad?

207
00:26:26,347 --> 00:26:27,834
What do you say?

208
00:26:27,834 --> 00:26:30,919
That is, the monsters are
good, the evil is also good,

209
00:26:30,944 --> 00:26:33,860
the thief one is good and
the Mahatma is also good.

210
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:37,331
And God is good. Everything is good,
all are same.

211
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:40,832
Hitler is good and krushna is also good.

212
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,474
There is no difference between them

213
00:26:42,474 --> 00:26:44,473
No one should say bad .all good

214
00:26:44,473 --> 00:26:46,470
There is nothing bad to say

215
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,225
This was the stage of royalness

216
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:50,225
You now have the royal nature

217
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:52,974
Because you are making progress now

218
00:26:52,974 --> 00:26:54,726
Due to the progressive country you are

219
00:26:54,726 --> 00:26:58,475
Now there is a humble request that
you should not progress there

220
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:01,478
Now we have to make such progress right now

221
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:05,429
She wants to progress
through the Crown Chakra and

222
00:27:05,454 --> 00:27:09,250
That is to make progress
in the higher direction

223
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:12,476
For This,What's wrong with this?
What's wrong with him?

224
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,191
Why do this?
why do that?

225
00:27:14,191 --> 00:27:17,198
If that desire were to happen, we would have
thought that we became a royal

226
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:19,695
It's worse than vengeful.

227
00:27:21,446 --> 00:27:25,222
Because once you can remove
bond,But by the way, From the

228
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:29,218
point of view, the restriction on the
eye, how to remove it?

229
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,944
So,do not go to that situation.

230
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,942
What's wrong with this
What's wrong in him

231
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:37,692
You are your master in Sahajayoga.

232
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:42,199
Vibrations come in your hands and
you know what's wrong with you

233
00:27:42,199 --> 00:27:43,882
Then,Fix Your Vibrations.

234
00:27:43,882 --> 00:27:47,144
But there is a situation
where people do not understand

235
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:49,905
anything, whether we
have lost anything or not

236
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:54,388
This situation should not occur

237
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,387
That is my request by adding my hands

238
00:27:57,636 --> 00:28:04,640
Today, in this good news, we all have to tell
you that you are born in this holy soil.

239
00:28:05,136 --> 00:28:08,638
I now go to Coimbatore day before yesterday,
they said that you will live in Pune now ?

240
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:10,387
It is said to be punyapattanum.

241
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:12,384
All said by adding their hands

242
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:23,387
Said, 'Why?'
... now you see it all

243
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:27,134
This is what they were .it was
what they were described

244
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:37,215
This story tells us that once Pundarikaksh
took his father and mother

245
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,634
Came to Mumbai city.
Maybe even Pune has come

246
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,385
There is a story about Pune.
Do not know if there will be any.

247
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:45,384
He said to them,
'I'm not taking you anywhere now.

248
00:28:45,384 --> 00:28:47,327
I have served you very much

249
00:28:47,823 --> 00:28:50,073
Now,I'm not going to take you forward
Go where you want

250
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:56,448
I am not doing your pilgrimage anymore.
He thought, saw the vaibrations and said

251
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,194
That's it, do it

252
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,944
You take us out of here anyhow

253
00:29:02,193 --> 00:29:07,946
Then do what you want to do,
As he picked it out of that village, he came to notice

254
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:10,945
That's how much is my fault,
He said, forgive me

255
00:29:10,945 --> 00:29:12,196
Something happened to me

256
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:17,695
No, no, I take you away,
Well, I think this often in Pune

257
00:29:17,695 --> 00:29:19,191
Mumbai has so much

258
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:25,692
But now people should decide that,
to pune

259
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:31,196
Which Graduation is given from Anadikal
The great saints, great masters

260
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:34,444
will celebrate and will do it well

261
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:38,675
Today,All of this should be decided in
the mind of the people of Pune

262
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:44,924
That's the name of Pune, that's such a great name,
we get such a great principle

263
00:29:44,924 --> 00:29:46,176
what others do?

264
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:50,917
Others do this,Others do thieves, they do this,
do not want to see others. Others Others

265
00:29:51,294 --> 00:29:52,500
You are ours.

266
00:29:52,659 --> 00:30:01,036
What attitude do we leave,Except for small attitude,
we can absorb big ideas

267
00:30:01,493 --> 00:30:05,493
Secondly, we have the biggest problem
in religion

268
00:30:06,172 --> 00:30:08,267
Today,have to say about that also

269
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:14,644
It is written by Markandey Swaamy about
the idea of ​​caste from Anadikal

270
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,471
Which is called as consciousness
in all the beings of the

271
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:18,364
Goddess The Goddesses who are
situated in power in all castes,

272
00:30:18,364 --> 00:30:21,186
That's what we say every day,
But why we dont understand?

273
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:25,036
Means,Whats goddess cast,
that is our cast

274
00:30:25,036 --> 00:30:28,607
Mahakali, Mahalaxmi and Mahasaraswati are
only three caste in this world

275
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:32,121
And the fourth caste is Aadishakti's,
that's your caste.

276
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,926
It's Beyond that

277
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:38,493
Those who are passionate,
their cast of Mahakali's

278
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:42,965
Mahasaraswati's caste for
those who are of Royal

279
00:30:43,124 --> 00:30:46,140
Those who are righteous,
their castes are Mahalakshmi

280
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:50,546
There are three castes in this
way and the fourth which is

281
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:54,751
going on is beyond the castes,
that is to say,Trigunatit

282
00:30:55,489 --> 00:30:58,022
In this situation you are sitting today

283
00:30:58,111 --> 00:31:01,177
So do not fight on castes

284
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:05,657
We are this,we are that,this,that,
Those who really do not really do anything

285
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:11,146
With such a brawl,then we say that
why we have given the kingdom to them?

286
00:31:11,178 --> 00:31:12,740
Means Shivaji was
kunabi(lower cast)

287
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,299
Why did give the kingdom?

288
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,475
There are many people who say so

289
00:31:15,801 --> 00:31:20,991
Now who is sitting on your kingdom?
Parsi is a man coming and sitting,Tell him

290
00:31:21,166 --> 00:31:28,824
Came all Brahmins and say.tell,
They become friendly with all

291
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:31,329
That man is good
But its meaning

292
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:37,533
Who has said that?Even if Shivaji Maharaj is in situation,
you give him trouble

293
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:42,963
also told Gandhi ji that you
make atonement at Nashik

294
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:47,749
You make atonement,
from such a great man

295
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:51,768
I once said to Mahatmaji,
'Why do you go to make atonement?

296
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:55,213
He said,If I did not go,
they would've shot mi

297
00:31:56,038 --> 00:31:58,038
Whom did you give up?

298
00:31:58,832 --> 00:32:04,155
You must remove people from that class,
and this is the idea that you have

299
00:32:04,235 --> 00:32:06,997
That is, showing others down in religion

300
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:14,143
Every time that big people were there
Everyone in this country tried this

301
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:18,112
That people should remove
this idea from their minds

302
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:20,548
eknath feeds water to donkey.

303
00:32:20,953 --> 00:32:22,793
Naamdev was a tailor.

304
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:25,992
We had a gentleman butcher

305
00:32:26,032 --> 00:32:27,899
He is considered to be a saint.

306
00:32:27,983 --> 00:32:30,426
Tukaram also always used
to say that If I had

307
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:34,314
become a Mahar(lower Caste),
it will good for mi

308
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:40,248
Why this?That is, they are often told that
this madness of caste should be gone

309
00:32:40,965 --> 00:32:42,726
And so many miracles happened

310
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:45,762
Their Volume came out in the Indrayani(river)
which was immersed, all happened

311
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:47,937
But people have not understand that

312
00:32:47,953 --> 00:32:51,614
The thing which is holy is different,
the fight between castes is different

313
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:54,701
They will not learn because
the eyes are close

314
00:32:55,621 --> 00:32:58,891
So this kind of caste does not work for us,
We do not want that kind of caste

315
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:01,495
We will not do this,
we will not do that

316
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:09,232
Such people who speak,
And in this way the people who spread the atmosphere

317
00:33:09,391 --> 00:33:11,658
There was a defect only in our country

318
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:15,111
Well, it still needs to be done in practical terms

319
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:18,274
that,some caste boy married with another caste girl

320
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:23,988
There is no difference between them
and this kind of marriage, but they have advantages

321
00:33:24,322 --> 00:33:28,556
Suppose,If you married in your caste
and did Maratha in Marathas

322
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:32,405
So, he has not sent anything to Diwali.

323
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:37,691
How much did dowry?To talk properly,
How much did dowry?

324
00:33:38,105 --> 00:33:42,183
I want to get married,
then the girl should be the same

325
00:33:42,446 --> 00:33:46,840
If someone tricks her,
then who will come from the community?

326
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,454
f you send the girl home,
if didnt give dowry,, But at

327
00:33:49,479 --> 00:33:51,491
that time can someone is
standing in the community?

328
00:33:51,825 --> 00:33:57,150
Dies For such castes,
oppressed people torture their girls

329
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:01,341
Not only that, I feel that one of
those media is atrocity.

330
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:04,259
The girls used to abuse and
torture to them

331
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:07,744
It must be married in this caste,
This is a medium

332
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:10,561
It is a medium to
persecute those girls

333
00:34:10,903 --> 00:34:16,023
We are harassing ourselves,
our own, our girls every day.

334
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:22,796
If another son got good,If you got good in
the others caste, then what is the problem?

335
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:25,611
What should be the problem,
there is no objection

336
00:34:25,992 --> 00:34:27,125
But it does not look like that

337
00:34:27,555 --> 00:34:29,155
It is not so practical

338
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:34,212
But tomorrow in that caste left our
daughter, So that being helps you

339
00:34:34,231 --> 00:34:38,894
Even when it appeared front of us,
we got married in our own caste only.

340
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:42,401
Stubbornness like this

341
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,893
That is,You really have
something radish on girls head

342
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,367
We're putting a lot of weight

343
00:34:50,495 --> 00:34:53,832
If you want to, you can do it in
your caste If you want,return it.

344
00:34:54,046 --> 00:34:56,562
But why do you bother that girl

345
00:34:56,951 --> 00:35:00,396
Troubled her
tomorrow,mother-in-law troubled her

346
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:02,972
You do not go and say
that we married in a caste

347
00:35:03,036 --> 00:35:06,260
n it you will have a reputation for
being 'we married in our caste'

348
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:08,379
What are you going to get?

349
00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:10,319
Why do you get?

350
00:35:12,325 --> 00:35:13,925
It is special in womens

351
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,841
That should be in our caste

352
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:20,413
So you have to showoff something after
that What you get? i do not understand.

353
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:22,929
Gandhiji tried.

354
00:35:23,214 --> 00:35:25,747
Tilak made efforts before Gandhiji

355
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:28,068
Tilak married widow himself

356
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:30,697
Agarkar did

357
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:35,847
How many people have tried,
but we have not fulfilled that effort

358
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:41,585
Now, when it comes back to sahajayoga,
do not have to do things like casteism

359
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:43,954
We do not believe in caste.

360
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:47,312
We consider only cast.
that is sahajayoga.

361
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:50,795
Sahajaogya is the story of World religions

362
00:35:51,803 --> 00:35:56,818
This is a world religion and there
is nothing like casteism, hatred etc.

363
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:01,179
A single God and all the
people of mankind he created

364
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:04,894
Those who have achieved God now,
when they enter the kingdom of God

365
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:06,767
Do not take it there,
mad people from here.

366
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:09,764
bawannakuli(caste) and this and that

367
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:21,511
A gentleman said to me,caste(kul) .talk about
caste mataji, i said ..caste..you have a big.

368
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,523
caste come from where ?

369
00:36:23,564 --> 00:36:26,608
Who is your goddess, from there

370
00:36:26,871 --> 00:36:28,938
That is, the goddess came back or not.

371
00:36:29,775 --> 00:36:30,975
Which is your kul(caste)?

372
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:35,585
If we are of any caste,
our Goddess may be one.

373
00:36:35,744 --> 00:36:37,608
Suppose someone's goddess is Jagadamba.

374
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:43,851
hen it can be of a goldsmith or a Brahmin.
it can be Maratha's, anyone can be.

375
00:36:43,899 --> 00:36:46,398
That is, whether their caste
is for Jagdamba or not.

376
00:36:46,439 --> 00:36:48,716
That is, the kul(caste) became Jagdamba's

377
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,859
We have Kul(caste) from the Goddess

378
00:36:53,288 --> 00:36:54,930
Not from the God

379
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:59,323
That is, the identity of the kul(caste)
is known on mother, and it is also true

380
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:04,967
Thats why we say 'ya devi
sarvabhuteshu,jatiru pen sansthita'

381
00:37:05,047 --> 00:37:07,325
It's your caste,
This is your caste of greatness

382
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:09,893
Now I ask what is
the kul(caste) of Shivaji?

383
00:37:10,417 --> 00:37:11,544
No one can tell.

384
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:14,331
One might say, Jagadamba,
someone would say, Bhavani

385
00:37:14,402 --> 00:37:15,879
Bhavani was his mother.

386
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:17,340
They have a kantyayani.

387
00:37:17,427 --> 00:37:19,030
kantyayani was his kul(caste).

388
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,133
kantyayani was his
goddess kul(caste).

389
00:37:21,546 --> 00:37:24,039
Now, whether it is the Casteism of
their caste or not, do not know

390
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,580
this is Casteism.

391
00:37:25,675 --> 00:37:26,595
This is kul(caste).

392
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:27,897
This is the greatness of kul(caste).

393
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:32,395
To get something done,that we are this
much kul(cast) and that much kul(caste)

394
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,737
Type something that does not look like

395
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,585
All will come together in drinking alcohol.

396
00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:38,383
If everyone wants to drink alcohol,
then they all sit together and drink.

397
00:37:38,415 --> 00:37:40,335
Same place

398
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:44,327
When drinking,So what
do we drink alcohol?

399
00:37:44,455 --> 00:37:48,637
But at the time of drinking water,
we wear holy clothes.

400
00:37:52,373 --> 00:37:54,119
Even if you want to have cigarettes

401
00:37:54,164 --> 00:37:56,964
If you have half your
remaining thas is also fine

402
00:37:58,548 --> 00:38:02,972
But at the time of meal, however,
we are very considerate of others.

403
00:38:03,623 --> 00:38:06,376
That is, if you want to
work in a bad way, you want

404
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:09,047
to make a thief,can anyone
ask what's your caste?

405
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,850
When stolen, they form a team

406
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:15,858
When all kind of people steal together

407
00:38:15,977 --> 00:38:17,296
ame is politics

408
00:38:17,413 --> 00:38:21,365
Nobody in politics thinks
that, what is your caste?

409
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:24,373
When all bad people come
together that means politics.

410
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:28,458
But you have to find out
how much you are really bad

411
00:38:28,721 --> 00:38:30,863
Very bad people

412
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:34,149
So this is ours,
just got it right with us.

413
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:44,058
This is the situation today that
you have nothing about yourself

414
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:47,556
There is no self respect,Because
if there is no demonstration

415
00:38:47,581 --> 00:38:50,053
of self, then self respect
can come from where?

416
00:38:50,616 --> 00:38:54,110
It is worthless to say
that things are worthless

417
00:38:54,435 --> 00:38:56,522
Those things have become so important

418
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,991
There is no attention
to the real things.

419
00:38:59,102 --> 00:39:00,324
It's a vengeful symptom

420
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:05,376
And this vengeful sign should go through
you, so you have tried your best.

421
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:11,400
The vengeful person does not
have any respect for himselfo.

422
00:39:11,877 --> 00:39:13,441
He does not think about himself.

423
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:18,016
I have some self-respect or
should I have some self-respect

424
00:39:18,346 --> 00:39:19,917
And his whispering all time

425
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:22,544
whispering about him,
whispering about them

426
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,187
Something slayess,
which is called in English,like he did

427
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,766
From here and
there,his whispering

428
00:39:28,957 --> 00:39:29,957
slayess

429
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:34,116
Likewise,
the royal man is a terror but open

430
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:37,386
Openly,
the two ,four will slap you

431
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:42,285
If someone gave him two or four, he would
give two-four back, but he would openly

432
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:43,928
his all apparent

433
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:45,071
That is so much that .....

434
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:47,317
It is open to sin,
what is bad in it?

435
00:39:47,547 --> 00:39:49,547
What is worse than doing it?

436
00:39:49,745 --> 00:39:51,617
What's wrong with that?.
say this

437
00:39:51,917 --> 00:39:54,464
If you want to do anything,
then there is no such thing in it

438
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:57,155
In all things,
what is wrong with it.

439
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,248
The other is ashamed to see them.
It is a condition

440
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:03,957
So what is your
situation, That you know

441
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:05,934
Know what is your cast

442
00:40:06,125 --> 00:40:10,023
And any caste has been
exhausted, means you Drowned.

443
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:15,356
Then it should be multiplied
beyond this species

444
00:40:16,118 --> 00:40:23,082
It should be done in a multiply. And you
must be self-confident in that situation

445
00:40:23,495 --> 00:40:25,828
His richnees should be seen in him

446
00:40:26,202 --> 00:40:31,335
The second symptom of Sahajayoga is that he
should always look happy, he should look cool

447
00:40:31,714 --> 00:40:34,886
Kabirdas said, what do you say,
when you are happy?

448
00:40:36,014 --> 00:40:38,014
If you do not have fun

449
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,672
Then you are not sahajayogi.

450
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:45,673
If you find this,
We will do anything that Mataji said

451
00:40:47,263 --> 00:40:48,636
I have seen many people like this.

452
00:40:48,875 --> 00:40:50,740
I said, what are you doing?

453
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:52,319
One thousand people will come.

454
00:40:52,923 --> 00:40:55,842
How can we do it?
Mother, we will take one thousand or three

455
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:59,897
thousand men.What about it,that's
enough when we are 10 people

456
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:05,060
It is fun, it is called impudence

457
00:41:05,211 --> 00:41:09,211
If it does not come,
then you still have not been sahajayogi

458
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:11,306
What is in it, mother said.

459
00:41:11,362 --> 00:41:13,481
Then what is going to
happen and happening

460
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:17,243
There are many people who
have benefitted from this

461
00:41:17,322 --> 00:41:19,833
They have seen how
much benefit it has made

462
00:41:19,964 --> 00:41:20,857
How much did it get

463
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:22,373
But it should be anxious.

464
00:41:22,477 --> 00:41:23,943
Must have fun

465
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:28,977
If the fun does not appear in the person,
then something has happened

466
00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:31,435
He did not have seriousness.

467
00:41:31,713 --> 00:41:35,530
whisperring in all thing,
paying Attention to small things

468
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:42,038
Do not want to do that, do not want to
do it, or do something that is all fun

469
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,990
Will be deposed,such things
not suitable to sahajayogi

470
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:47,141
Just fine.

471
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:51,998
If you do all the fun, then you will be surprised,
what kind of work is done? how things happen?

472
00:41:52,078 --> 00:41:56,902
You have come into the kingdom of God,
If will not having fun now,then when?

473
00:41:59,418 --> 00:42:04,558
So all this is a happy
day, It's a day of light,

474
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,898
We got a flag of freedom.

475
00:42:08,216 --> 00:42:13,874
So I myself in Delhi, saw second flag.
to rising and descending,

476
00:42:14,484 --> 00:42:18,143
And I said that, this is the beauty
of the flag, it should remain

477
00:42:18,556 --> 00:42:26,020
And by that grace we all should be
fully integrated with our identity

478
00:42:27,156 --> 00:42:30,838
Our personality should be
completely integrated only

479
00:42:31,037 --> 00:42:33,796
That should be fun,
should be joyful

480
00:42:33,866 --> 00:42:36,763
Everyone should be
involved in the same

481
00:42:37,247 --> 00:42:40,294
Now these people came
from outside so much.

482
00:42:40,374 --> 00:42:43,159
I do not have time to talk
to them for two minutes

483
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:45,540
It does not take time to sit
near them for two minutes

484
00:42:45,787 --> 00:42:49,152
They have come from so far, some of them
are such that I have never seen them

485
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,430
They are in the mood

486
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:52,768
I did not spend a minute with them

487
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:55,356
But they do not feel anything.
In our Maharashtra not llike this

488
00:42:55,634 --> 00:42:57,308
Mothers did not come to my house.

489
00:42:57,372 --> 00:42:58,880
Not come to my premises.

490
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,465
have not been to my center,
My, me, mine is very much.

491
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:06,734
And mother did not give time to me,
Give me time.

492
00:43:07,005 --> 00:43:09,005
I have spent all my time in Maharashtra

493
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:11,413
There is no time to talk to these people

494
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,270
I do not even ask
him, how you are?

495
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,231
To this date.

496
00:43:15,414 --> 00:43:17,520
How are you ?
It is not even said

497
00:43:17,735 --> 00:43:19,838
What do they come here,
and what are they?

498
00:43:20,219 --> 00:43:21,893
means,Thay does not meet.

499
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:25,129
Went to their country,
which means that are a little too much

500
00:43:25,979 --> 00:43:28,121
But they never said that

501
00:43:28,225 --> 00:43:33,826
Mother, come to me or
come to my home. Talk to me.

502
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:34,945
Never

503
00:43:36,207 --> 00:43:39,723
Well, secondly, if I would go to
someone, then I would go

504
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,850
That's mine

505
00:43:41,263 --> 00:43:43,263
I would go wherever I want

506
00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:45,786
I do my convenience

507
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:48,873
People will say,
why did you go to their house?

508
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:52,422
Hey there, I get convenience there,
so I go, who will you say?

509
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,707
So that's me,
that's why you're going there

510
00:43:56,232 --> 00:43:57,914
To force me to do so

511
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:03,810
But all this is a sign of eloquence and
stupidity, that they should not be so.

512
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:08,586
So everyone, for two minutes,
come for a minute to me.why?

513
00:44:09,767 --> 00:44:10,624
Why come?

514
00:44:10,736 --> 00:44:12,632
What are you going to get?

515
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:16,608
troubled me and made me unhappy

516
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:18,585
Then,How do i feel happy?

517
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:23,871
And how will you get blessings from that
happiness? If you followed my troubles

518
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:27,248
So do not insist that to
come my house.

519
00:44:27,288 --> 00:44:30,042
Come to me.this my should gone.

520
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:33,137
Which is your house All
of my houses are there.

521
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,800
My child,

522
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:40,427
My house, my husband,
This is all vengeful symptom.

523
00:44:41,326 --> 00:44:46,865
It should be kept in mind that whatever
children do my, me, those children should never

524
00:44:47,207 --> 00:44:48,460
Can not match.

525
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:52,555
you have so much heartache
in it that It's a mistake to

526
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:57,982
say that, even if he is a
murderer, then he is the baby.

527
00:44:59,315 --> 00:45:01,870
So we are a sahajayogi
to get away from him

528
00:45:01,921 --> 00:45:06,021
How should your child be described? You will
not know unless you stay away and see it

529
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:07,675
So do not invlove in it .

530
00:45:07,787 --> 00:45:11,619
And the society that will be created
by chance, That's the true quality

531
00:45:12,517 --> 00:45:17,720
He is a true sahajayogi and he will
be blessed with this great work

532
00:45:18,355 --> 00:45:21,664
May god bless you .

533
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,614
Gulal etc ...

534
00:45:52,244 --> 00:45:55,450
Should get some communication back

535
00:45:55,926 --> 00:45:57,902
One i think that people

536
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,926
From pune going to mumbai

537
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:04,246
Mumbains,Punein,from
there,from nagar

538
00:46:04,484 --> 00:46:07,992
This,This and the lane in
it, do not remove

539
00:46:09,737 --> 00:46:14,707
Everyone should meet,Should be in
You must increase love with yourself

540
00:46:14,874 --> 00:46:18,940
Everyone has given
such a suggestion that

541
00:46:19,273 --> 00:46:20,964
It would be good for man

542
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:24,567
And everyone should travel

543
00:46:24,591 --> 00:46:27,117
You must meet here and there

544
00:46:27,347 --> 00:46:29,347
Which today

545
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:30,688
Sahajayoga

546
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:34,143
It has spread to foreign countries.
Sahajayogi there due to it,Not mi

547
00:46:35,857 --> 00:46:38,804
Because I do not have so much
time, my home is there

548
00:46:39,113 --> 00:46:45,844
My husband ia there,So much so Month out of
my tour, Soon there are 14 countries to go

549
00:46:46,121 --> 00:46:48,531
So I live in a country
for 2 to 3 days

550
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:52,916
But these people came here to
themselves, go there from there

551
00:46:53,082 --> 00:46:56,661
Go and talk to them Make
arrangements everywhere

552
00:46:56,701 --> 00:46:58,955
It does not matter that there are
four psyche sitting at one place

553
00:47:01,946 --> 00:47:06,606
People of Pune go to four places It is
necessary to go out and talk to people only

554
00:47:06,987 --> 00:47:09,598
But you sit in one place
There is a big problem

555
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:13,822
So it should be taken into mind
That should come among themselves

556
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:19,643
And when you get in touch,
It should be done as well for sahajayogi

557
00:47:19,952 --> 00:47:21,187
Only then will it work

558
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:26,862
But that does not mean many people,
Let's know some of that and try to mess it

559
00:47:26,996 --> 00:47:30,669
Mother said,Then they
go with their bed

560
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:34,963
And whose house a month has
stopped He came to and crying

561
00:47:36,677 --> 00:47:41,328
Hey Mataji stayed for a month,Now
what to do? then you said it only.

562
00:47:42,836 --> 00:47:45,036
Self-respect i said

563
00:47:45,448 --> 00:47:49,107
There is no need to stay with anyone
Do it yourself and arrange somewhere

564
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,423
You have two days to go and
meet and ask how you are?

565
00:47:52,448 --> 00:47:55,596
What's not?, what to do with the
program, and what to do

566
00:47:56,508 --> 00:47:58,508
Now move on
