01:12:57.648 --> 01:13:03.098
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

01:13:09.059 --> 01:13:11.514
At the very outset,

01:13:11.542 --> 01:13:16.923
I have to tell you that Truth is what it is.

01:13:16.961 --> 01:13:19.409
You cannot change it,

01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:22.385
you cannot transform it,

01:13:22.389 --> 01:13:24.915
you cannot explain it.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:28.290
Only thing you can experience it.

01:13:31.245 --> 01:13:33.352
In this Kali Yuga

01:13:33.502 --> 01:13:37.643
there is a special category of people born

01:13:37.672 --> 01:13:40.673
in all the countries very surprisingly,

01:13:40.712 --> 01:13:44.438
who are seekers of Truth.

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:51.414
And William Blake, the great poet of England

01:13:51.484 --> 01:13:53.734
has said that

01:13:55.073 --> 01:13:59.887
these men of God will be born during this time

01:13:59.938 --> 01:14:03.147
and they will know the truth

01:14:03.188 --> 01:14:05.418
So many have said about this.

01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:10.605
Even in our old books of prophecies.

01:14:13.114 --> 01:14:15.594
You have known so many of them

01:14:15.674 --> 01:14:19.442
but especially the one which is described

01:14:19.513 --> 01:14:23.007
in Nadi Granth written by Bhrigu Muni

01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:25.977
is clearly said that at this time

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:30.882
people will know the Truth through the Kundalini Awakening.

01:14:30.903 --> 01:14:33.883
The knowledge of Kundalini was known to us,

01:14:33.933 --> 01:14:37.414
I don’t know how many years back.

01:14:37.504 --> 01:14:42.147
You cannot say because our history is so unknown.

01:14:42.203 --> 01:14:47.938
But at the time of a great saint

01:14:47.951 --> 01:14:51.389
called as Macchindra Nath and Gorakh Nath,

01:14:51.408 --> 01:14:55.700
they were indulging into

01:14:55.749 --> 01:14:58.816
awakening of Kundalini

01:14:58.865 --> 01:15:04.240
but the condition was that one Guru should give Realisation to only one person.

01:15:04.251 --> 01:15:06.361
Went on like this

01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:08.750
till the twelfth century when

01:15:08.758 --> 01:15:11.351
Gyandeva first of all asked his Guru,

01:15:11.358 --> 01:15:14.680
his own Master was his own brother.

01:15:14.678 --> 01:15:15.720
asked him that,

01:15:15.727 --> 01:15:20.869
“You please allow me to at least write about Kundalini.”

01:15:20.908 --> 01:15:25.956
Because in the Gita it was not described.

01:15:25.982 --> 01:15:29.546
Though Shri Krishna has talked of Sthit Pragnya and all those things

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:33.112
but he didn’t talk about:

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:34.131
How to get it?

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.429
What is the mechanism within us which works it out?

01:15:38.489 --> 01:15:43.220
Then he wrote it in his Gyaneshwari

01:15:43.268 --> 01:15:46.018
which is just a, I think,

01:15:46.077 --> 01:15:48.797
explanation of Gita very clearly

01:15:48.868 --> 01:15:52.818
that there is a power within us.

01:15:54.088 --> 01:15:56.957
In the sixth chapter he wrote about Kundalini

01:15:57.218 --> 01:16:01.476
but the people who were in charge of religion didn’t want that.

01:16:01.501 --> 01:16:04.161
So they said, “This is a Nishiddha (prohibited) part

01:16:04.221 --> 01:16:07.523
and you should not read this part of Kundalini.”

01:16:07.531 --> 01:16:09.792
But in the sixteenth century

01:16:09.811 --> 01:16:12.619
under the guidance of Guru Nanaka,

01:16:12.660 --> 01:16:13.660
Namdeva,

01:16:13.690 --> 01:16:15.053
Kabira,

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:21.555
all these people, clearly, clearly, very clearly wrote about Kundalini

01:16:21.601 --> 01:16:25.855
but the way it was mutilated

01:16:25.872 --> 01:16:28.918
by

01:16:28.939 --> 01:16:31.481
people which is very surprising.

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:33.311
Everything has been mutilated

01:16:33.332 --> 01:16:36.055
but this one was very surprising

01:16:36.086 --> 01:16:39.985
because Kabira was in Bihar

01:16:39.994 --> 01:16:42.285
and he called Kundalini as Surti.

01:16:42.304 --> 01:16:44.885
Very clearly, he said about Surti

01:16:44.894 --> 01:16:50.834
but in Bihar, ‘Surti’ is what you call ‘tobacco’.

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:52.614
They call ‘tobacco’ as ‘Surti’,

01:16:52.617 --> 01:16:55.690
so you can imagine what is the mutilation.

01:16:55.696 --> 01:16:58.887
Now this power is within you.

01:16:58.936 --> 01:17:00.787
If I am telling you something today

01:17:00.808 --> 01:17:02.588
you need not accept it.

01:17:02.628 --> 01:17:05.207
Blind folded acceptance is of no use.

01:17:05.237 --> 01:17:08.634
We have had enough problems with blind faiths.

01:17:08.648 --> 01:17:10.600
So, first of all

01:17:10.601 --> 01:17:12.170
you must get the experience

01:17:12.182 --> 01:17:16.004
and then you will not doubt it.

01:17:16.001 --> 01:17:19.848
This science was known to us since long

01:17:19.888 --> 01:17:22.208
but as it was only done for one person

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:25.458
or say ten persons at the most,

01:17:25.468 --> 01:17:28.318
I decided to find out a method by which

01:17:28.348 --> 01:17:32.218
an en-masse Realisation could be given.

01:17:32.239 --> 01:17:35.110
Luckily my father was a very social person

01:17:35.189 --> 01:17:37.809
and I could meet many people.

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:42.153
Even my husband’s life was such that I could meet many people.

01:17:42.203 --> 01:17:48.804
So, I worked out the permutations and combinations of human problems

01:17:48.855 --> 01:17:50.669
and then I discovered

01:17:50.715 --> 01:17:53.388
how we can easily solve this problem

01:17:53.405 --> 01:17:55.528
of Kundalini awakening.

01:17:55.516 --> 01:17:57.898
Because there are problems

01:17:57.936 --> 01:18:00.049
on the way of its ascent

01:18:00.091 --> 01:18:03.771
then Kundalini doesn’t, Kundalini doesn’t come up.

01:18:03.811 --> 01:18:05.340
Now

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:07.829
there are seven chakras

01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:10.699
basically within us.

01:18:10.742 --> 01:18:13.826
These seven chakras are responsible

01:18:13.888 --> 01:18:18.484
of our physical, mental and emotional being.

01:18:18.497 --> 01:18:20.184
There is no doubt about it

01:18:20.198 --> 01:18:22.528
but you have to first find out

01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:23.614
and then believe in it.

01:18:23.634 --> 01:18:25.814
Don’t believe because I am saying so

01:18:25.835 --> 01:18:30.117
or anybody says so. You have to experience it and feel it.

01:18:30.124 --> 01:18:32.427
There are many ways we can also judge.

01:18:32.434 --> 01:18:34.927
For example,

01:18:34.948 --> 01:18:36.477
in the Koran,

01:18:36.487 --> 01:18:41.427
Mohammed Sahib has said, “At the time of Kayama, means this time of Resurrection,

01:18:41.468 --> 01:18:43.328
your hands will speak.”

01:18:43.367 --> 01:18:45.287
He also calls it ‘Kayamat’

01:18:45.331 --> 01:18:48.341
means ‘those who will not accept will suffer’.

01:18:48.362 --> 01:18:50.782
But who will accept their hands will speak,

01:18:50.802 --> 01:18:52.073
their

01:18:52.133 --> 01:18:54.773
mouth will be shut and their hands will speak?

01:18:54.843 --> 01:18:57.033
This is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga

01:18:57.112 --> 01:19:00.071
that once you get your Self-realisation

01:19:00.117 --> 01:19:03.521
you can feel those subtle centres within you.

01:19:03.557 --> 01:19:05.674
These subtle centres of energy

01:19:05.703 --> 01:19:07.393
are seven in number

01:19:07.417 --> 01:19:15.328
and are acting for giving us all kinds of energies.

01:19:15.377 --> 01:19:18.244
Now the problem is how to make

01:19:18.258 --> 01:19:20.114
people believe in Kundalini.

01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:22.014
It’s a difficult task

01:19:22.016 --> 01:19:23.905
because you are all intellectuals

01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:27.645
and you have had your medical education

01:19:27.657 --> 01:19:30.557
from England and all these places you see.

01:19:30.566 --> 01:19:32.287
It is more westernised

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.562
and to believe in something Indian

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.403
is rather difficult for people that it’s all Indian after all.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:41.550
But actually, even in medical science

01:19:41.621 --> 01:19:44.751
we have to understand the limitations of a science.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:49.059
First of all, science is amoral.

01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:53.412
Secondly, it does not go to the roots.

01:19:53.417 --> 01:19:57.782
So, it starts like we have to treat a tree.

01:19:57.787 --> 01:19:59.432
So, we treat the leaves,

01:19:59.448 --> 01:20:00.843
treat the branches

01:20:00.893 --> 01:20:03.182
but Sahaja Yoga is going to the roots,

01:20:03.223 --> 01:20:04.900
is the knowledge of the roots.

01:20:04.924 --> 01:20:09.888
And the roots are the seven chakras and our Kundalini.

01:20:10.188 --> 01:20:13.560
Of course, without medical science you cannot also understand Sahaja Yoga.

01:20:13.581 --> 01:20:19.714
That is also one of the things because you can relate very easily. It is very scientific.

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:22.490
Now there are three Nadis also

01:20:22.541 --> 01:20:25.219
Left, Right and Centre.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:28.048
Left is called as Ida Nadi,

01:20:28.129 --> 01:20:29.848
right as Pingala

01:20:29.928 --> 01:20:36.959
and the central one is called as Sushumna Nadi.

01:20:40.677 --> 01:20:43.267
Kabira has described it very clearly

01:20:43.327 --> 01:20:46.213
and it is in the Granth Sahib

01:20:46.233 --> 01:20:49.783
written down but nobody tries to understand

01:20:49.824 --> 01:20:51.343
or to go beyond the words.

01:20:51.363 --> 01:20:54.513
Just go and read the words that is not going to help.

01:20:54.533 --> 01:20:55.943
You have to go beyond it.

01:20:55.945 --> 01:21:01.043
It is like this, you see a beautiful picture say where it’s raining,

01:21:01.074 --> 01:21:05.703
it’s very beautiful and you are seeing it, that’s all.

01:21:05.721 --> 01:21:09.209
But you are not inside it to experience it.

01:21:09.279 --> 01:21:11.829
So, to enter inside was difficult one

01:21:11.899 --> 01:21:15.411
because of the tradition of giving to one person only,

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.889
or to few persons

01:21:16.899 --> 01:21:18.961
and secondly the greatest objection

01:21:18.971 --> 01:21:22.721
came from people, who were in charge of religion

01:21:22.740 --> 01:21:24.240
so called

01:21:24.265 --> 01:21:26.255
Nowadays those who are intellectuals,

01:21:26.276 --> 01:21:32.497
you should say medias and other people

01:21:32.526 --> 01:21:35.634
who have a feeling that they know everything,

01:21:35.643 --> 01:21:39.300
they don’t want to take anything, that is to begin with.

01:21:39.324 --> 01:21:41.401
This is one of the reasons why

01:21:41.416 --> 01:21:46.559
people don’t turn their eyes to the great knowledge we have in this country

01:21:46.576 --> 01:21:50.829
I am so very happy today that

01:21:50.847 --> 01:21:53.499
Indian Medical Association

01:21:53.526 --> 01:21:56.133
has given me this honour first of all

01:21:56.166 --> 01:21:59.478
because I could never imagine in my lifetime,

01:21:59.496 --> 01:22:01.553
I would be able to talk with you.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:06.037
I also did my medicine and I knew how difficult it was

01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:08.021
and how people were blind.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:11.417
So, I used to think, “How will I explain to them”,

01:22:11.458 --> 01:22:12.742
like Kabira has said,

01:22:12.741 --> 01:22:17.982
“Kaise samjhau, sab jag andha” (How to make them understand when the whole world is blind?)

01:22:18.006 --> 01:22:20.642
But the time has come because there are seekers now.

01:22:20.666 --> 01:22:22.811
And they should also know one more thing,

01:22:22.825 --> 01:22:25.252
that this country is the Yogabhoomi.

01:22:25.286 --> 01:22:27.291
They have given us science all right

01:22:27.328 --> 01:22:28.698
but we will give them Yoga.

01:22:28.747 --> 01:22:34.723
We will give them the real basic knowledge

01:22:34.753 --> 01:22:39.822
what is the foundation of Medical Science,

01:22:39.829 --> 01:22:41.849
is the foundation!

01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:46.049
Now by experimenting this and that

01:22:46.049 --> 01:22:49.526
also you have seen that it is neutralised by challenges.

01:22:49.541 --> 01:22:51.569
Every theory is neutralised

01:22:51.579 --> 01:22:54.214
so that means it is not Absolute.

01:22:54.241 --> 01:22:58.253
So, we have to go to something that is absolutely Absolute

01:22:58.291 --> 01:23:01.251
You have seen that Einstein found out something

01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.054
then our people are after him

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.073
this is wrong, that is wrong, going on like that.

01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:09.543
All the time something comes up, people go on criticising

01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:14.155
and the whole knowledge goes into oblivion.

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:19.015
So now we have to understand that if this is the Yogabhoomi,

01:23:19.335 --> 01:23:21.167
this is our country

01:23:21.187 --> 01:23:23.969
and if it has given us such a knowledge,

01:23:23.996 --> 01:23:27.267
why should we not also listen to it,

01:23:27.276 --> 01:23:32.772
because not only that it will flower your knowledge of medicine,

01:23:32.796 --> 01:23:39.537
not only that but it will give you such a confidence while practicing,

01:23:39.536 --> 01:23:42.313
while talking about medicine.

01:23:42.324 --> 01:23:45.523
Now as it is a subject,

01:23:45.544 --> 01:23:47.133
is on medicine

01:23:47.153 --> 01:23:50.147
I would like to speak on one of the centres

01:23:50.177 --> 01:23:54.824
which is very important because doctors are always affected by that centre.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:58.874
So, I better tell them what can go wrong with doctors

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.757
and what they should be careful about.

01:24:08.775 --> 01:24:13.045
It is to be understood that there is a centre,

01:24:13.094 --> 01:24:17.605
is the second centre which we call as Swadishthan.

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:19.545
This centre is very interesting.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:23.465
It comes out of the Solar Plexus

01:24:23.499 --> 01:24:27.556
we call it a Nabhi Chakra

01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:30.946
and like a lotus and it moves all round you see,

01:24:30.959 --> 01:24:34.826
as you can say in gross way it is Aortic Plexus.

01:24:34.849 --> 01:24:37.028
It supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.516
It is not Aortic Plexus but supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

01:24:41.527 --> 01:24:46.267
Now this centre is very important

01:24:46.307 --> 01:24:49.128
because it gives energy to our liver,

01:24:49.177 --> 01:24:52.119
to pancreas,

01:24:52.147 --> 01:24:55.689
to our spleen, to our intestines,

01:24:55.704 --> 01:24:56.849
to our kidneys,

01:24:56.854 --> 01:24:59.964
can you imagine such an important centre it is!

01:24:59.951 --> 01:25:01.152
This Swadishthan!

01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:04.262
But the most important work it does is very...

01:25:04.286 --> 01:25:06.612
which I don’t know you will accept or not

01:25:06.646 --> 01:25:10.686
but it supplies energy to our grey cells

01:25:10.701 --> 01:25:13.956
which we are using all the time.

01:25:13.941 --> 01:25:15.924
When we are thinking too much,

01:25:15.931 --> 01:25:19.394
when we are acting physically and mentally,

01:25:19.421 --> 01:25:24.568
this centre has to supply energy to our brain,

01:25:24.561 --> 01:25:28.118
we can call it to our grey cells

01:25:28.142 --> 01:25:31.778
which we are using all the time.

01:25:31.811 --> 01:25:33.118
When we are doctors,

01:25:33.146 --> 01:25:35.426
we are using our grey cells how much?

01:25:35.439 --> 01:25:36.159
We have no idea.

01:25:36.166 --> 01:25:38.882
There is nobody who has found out

01:25:38.916 --> 01:25:40.685
how much we use our brains,

01:25:40.756 --> 01:25:45.718
but we are going exhausting our brains and also, we are very futuristic.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.888
All doctors are futuristic.

01:25:47.911 --> 01:25:52.632
Maybe they want to find out something

01:25:52.692 --> 01:25:54.753
in the pure sense of the word

01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:57.363
or maybe they have certain ideas

01:25:57.384 --> 01:25:59.170
or maybe it is money,

01:25:59.181 --> 01:26:02.190
may be anything but they are very, very futuristic

01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:05.863
and in that trend of futuristic behaviour also

01:26:05.892 --> 01:26:07.728
there is a big competition

01:26:07.742 --> 01:26:09.448
so they don’t know what to do.

01:26:09.474 --> 01:26:13.018
They have to be futuristic and think but what will happen.

01:26:13.028 --> 01:26:20.497
Now in this kind of movement of the mind

01:26:20.512 --> 01:26:21.310
what happens

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.899
we start becoming very right sided,

01:26:23.897 --> 01:26:25.489
extremely right sided.

01:26:25.517 --> 01:26:27.289
Now as a result of that,

01:26:27.295 --> 01:26:29.545
as a right sided man, you know

01:26:29.565 --> 01:26:31.834
I would say what medically can happen,

01:26:31.854 --> 01:26:35.559
of course also happens lot of things mentally also.

01:26:35.574 --> 01:26:40.205
But what can happen medically,

01:26:40.214 --> 01:26:42.175
this Swadishthan Chakra

01:26:42.224 --> 01:26:44.264
which has to supply to your liver.

01:26:44.275 --> 01:26:45.974
Why do you call it ‘liver’?

01:26:45.994 --> 01:26:47.805
Because of liver we live.

01:26:47.805 --> 01:26:51.926
Liver is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

01:26:51.972 --> 01:26:55.166
I know that in medicine we don’t know much about liver

01:26:55.171 --> 01:26:59.725
and it is absolutely curable in Sahaja Yoga.

01:26:59.732 --> 01:27:01.166
But now what happens,

01:27:01.195 --> 01:27:06.634
liver is the one which takes all the poison of the body

01:27:06.652 --> 01:27:11.191
and throws it into the circulation.

01:27:11.205 --> 01:27:13.744
That everyone knows, all right!

01:27:13.752 --> 01:27:18.272
Now when liver is looked after it is normal,

01:27:18.281 --> 01:27:20.451
then we have also a pancreas,

01:27:20.482 --> 01:27:23.112
then we have spleen

01:27:23.161 --> 01:27:25.181
and also kidneys

01:27:25.216 --> 01:27:28.392
and the last part of intestines,

01:27:28.441 --> 01:27:31.757
intestines as a whole but the last part is very important.

01:27:31.778 --> 01:27:34.538
So, such a man who is always thinking

01:27:34.589 --> 01:27:37.817
all his energy is going to his brain

01:27:37.829 --> 01:27:40.209
and all these organs are neglected

01:27:40.278 --> 01:27:43.663
and he can be affected by any one of them

01:27:43.666 --> 01:27:47.523
So, the first thing he is affected is bad liver.

01:27:47.546 --> 01:27:49.329
Now this bad liver

01:27:49.344 --> 01:27:53.498
because it cannot throw its heat,

01:27:53.523 --> 01:27:55.547
which is the poison of the body

01:27:55.557 --> 01:27:56.858
into the circulation.

01:27:56.907 --> 01:28:00.057
What happens that it starts, heat starts rising,

01:28:00.088 --> 01:28:03.588
this heat goes higher on the right side.

01:28:03.647 --> 01:28:05.318
We call it Right Heart

01:28:05.297 --> 01:28:08.778
which is the centre which controls the lungs.

01:28:08.758 --> 01:28:11.718
So, such a person can get Asthma.

01:28:11.735 --> 01:28:14.428
Now Asthma has been cured through Sahaja Yoga,

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:16.018
very simple way.

01:28:16.089 --> 01:28:17.625
But it can be cured,

01:28:17.638 --> 01:28:23.215
it gets Asthma. We say it is incurable because we don't know about Swadishthan.

01:28:23.238 --> 01:28:26.985
Now this same thing happens to our…

01:28:27.056 --> 01:28:30.017
when it moves to the left side pancreas.

01:28:30.046 --> 01:28:32.447
Mostly people who are sitting on their chairs

01:28:32.484 --> 01:28:35.004
and thinking too much and planning too much

01:28:35.012 --> 01:28:36.484
get diabetes.

01:28:41.205 --> 01:28:43.945
Sugar doesn’t give you diabetes.

01:28:43.959 --> 01:28:47.650
In Maharashtra, I don’t know maybe here also in the villages,

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:51.235
a villager will take sugar

01:28:51.245 --> 01:28:54.505
in such a way that the spoon must stand at the right angles

01:28:54.530 --> 01:28:56.945
That’s the way

01:28:56.975 --> 01:28:59.309
a tea has to be made otherwise it is not tea,

01:28:59.329 --> 01:29:00.869
but he never gets diabetes,

01:29:00.844 --> 01:29:06.458
because he earns without any insurance or anything, spends it sleeps off.

01:29:06.475 --> 01:29:07.838
Next day he earns.

01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:10.017
He does not have botheration about future.

01:29:10.041 --> 01:29:11.141
What he should do?

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.646
He should accumulate money

01:29:12.685 --> 01:29:15.417
or he should give it to somebody? Nothing.

01:29:15.417 --> 01:29:18.372
He just lives with himself.

01:29:18.386 --> 01:29:21.652
Now this goes to pancreas,

01:29:21.682 --> 01:29:23.262
gives you diabetes,

01:29:23.272 --> 01:29:24.091
this heat

01:29:24.132 --> 01:29:25.953
Then it goes down

01:29:25.972 --> 01:29:29.613
then the kidney, kidney it coagulates.

01:29:29.623 --> 01:29:31.833
Now for kidney if you go to dialysis,

01:29:31.853 --> 01:29:32.953
I must tell you

01:29:32.963 --> 01:29:34.271
not that only you die

01:29:34.282 --> 01:29:38.583
but you die bankrupt it is a fact.

01:29:39.968 --> 01:29:43.983
Now in no way I want to criticise doctors,

01:29:44.044 --> 01:29:45.964
they have to earn after all,

01:29:45.974 --> 01:29:47.794
but there is a simple way

01:29:47.814 --> 01:29:50.594
of curing this kidney trouble

01:29:50.574 --> 01:29:52.474
And once this kidney is cured,

01:29:52.464 --> 01:29:54.939
it is cured forever

01:29:54.946 --> 01:29:57.660
So, by helping Swadishthan

01:29:57.666 --> 01:30:01.076
you can cure also kidney.

01:30:01.076 --> 01:30:03.290
But the most difficult thing

01:30:03.306 --> 01:30:04.877
is the spleen.

01:30:04.916 --> 01:30:08.377
Now in modern times

01:30:08.418 --> 01:30:10.234
we are very hectic

01:30:10.248 --> 01:30:11.044
For example,

01:30:11.067 --> 01:30:14.393
most of the doctors have to get up early in the morning

01:30:14.413 --> 01:30:15.913
on duty.

01:30:15.948 --> 01:30:18.785
In college we also used to do the same thing.

01:30:18.787 --> 01:30:19.805
Then we have no time

01:30:19.837 --> 01:30:21.951
to eat our food properly nothing.

01:30:21.971 --> 01:30:24.384
And we take our breakfast with us sometimes.

01:30:24.418 --> 01:30:25.296
In America

01:30:25.315 --> 01:30:27.716
I have seen doctors even brushing their teeth

01:30:27.736 --> 01:30:30.012
in the car.

01:30:30.026 --> 01:30:31.825
It is the limit of things.

01:30:31.825 --> 01:30:35.124
So, in this kind of a hectic life

01:30:35.184 --> 01:30:36.344
what happens:

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:37.454
the spleen, poor thing

01:30:37.495 --> 01:30:41.075
which has to produce RBCs for emergencies

01:30:41.094 --> 01:30:42.212
gets mad.

01:30:42.234 --> 01:30:44.084
She can’t understand,

01:30:44.083 --> 01:30:46.293
“What is the matter with this gentleman?”

01:30:46.343 --> 01:30:51.761
and it cannot also a sort of cooperate

01:30:51.805 --> 01:30:53.954
with all the madness we have.

01:30:53.985 --> 01:30:55.469
Then we read newspapers.

01:30:55.485 --> 01:30:57.798
Reading newspapers in the morning

01:30:57.825 --> 01:30:59.568
is a very dangerous thing

01:30:59.594 --> 01:31:02.016
because every day you see something horrible

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.486
and you get such a fright.

01:31:03.506 --> 01:31:06.437
For example, these days our country is in doldrums.

01:31:06.477 --> 01:31:07.681
I never read it in the morning

01:31:07.730 --> 01:31:08.997
at any cost

01:31:09.020 --> 01:31:11.470
But if you read it early in the morning any newspaper

01:31:11.561 --> 01:31:13.514
then finished, you will get some…

01:31:13.536 --> 01:31:17.217
They only tell you about what has gone wrong;

01:31:17.237 --> 01:31:19.487
disasters, accidents,

01:31:19.546 --> 01:31:21.991
if not that then political crisis,

01:31:22.007 --> 01:31:24.740
this that which upsets you.

01:31:24.777 --> 01:31:26.631
Whether you like it or not

01:31:26.664 --> 01:31:28.601
but it upsets you.

01:31:28.626 --> 01:31:32.040
So, reading newspaper early in the morning,

01:31:32.056 --> 01:31:36.573
then just running forward.

01:31:36.583 --> 01:31:37.823
No time for wife,

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:40.043
no time for children, nothing.

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:43.973
Formerly I remember that husband used to eat nicely

01:31:43.992 --> 01:31:45.234
at about ten o’clock.

01:31:45.237 --> 01:31:47.056
The wife used to fan him

01:31:47.126 --> 01:31:51.717
because there might be some flies around.

01:31:51.717 --> 01:31:53.998
She used to fan

01:31:54.017 --> 01:31:59.758
and relaxed way they used to eat food and live relaxed.

01:31:59.778 --> 01:32:03.149
Now what you call in Urdu language

01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:05.669
‘Kashmakash’ (Mental Struggle) is so much,

01:32:05.679 --> 01:32:07.859
that people are just running mad.

01:32:07.936 --> 01:32:09.565
They don’t know what to do.

01:32:09.635 --> 01:32:10.796
Now they go to the office,

01:32:10.796 --> 01:32:12.885
then they find, doctors especially,

01:32:12.885 --> 01:32:14.440
the boss is angry

01:32:14.490 --> 01:32:17.104
or there is some very serious patient has come,

01:32:17.111 --> 01:32:19.220
somebody has died by mistake.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:23.270
I mean doctors are completely treated

01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:24.881
like criminals in America,

01:32:24.931 --> 01:32:26.720
absolutely like criminals.

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:28.861
So, this is also coming here.

01:32:28.874 --> 01:32:30.694
If they do anything wrong by mistake,

01:32:30.755 --> 01:32:33.755
they do something, finished.

01:32:33.785 --> 01:32:35.090
Their practice is gone,

01:32:35.124 --> 01:32:37.370
they are put in jail.

01:32:37.384 --> 01:32:40.132
I mean after all they're human beings

01:32:40.152 --> 01:32:42.363
but this consideration is not there

01:32:42.373 --> 01:32:47.502
And so, this futuristic life makes them really crazy people.

01:32:47.553 --> 01:32:49.103
Then they become very hot tempered.

01:32:49.113 --> 01:32:50.138
Liver gives you heat,

01:32:50.163 --> 01:32:52.943
you become very hot tempered at the slightest thing,

01:32:52.973 --> 01:32:54.318
you just shoot off

01:32:54.334 --> 01:32:57.152
and start saying things which you should never have said.

01:32:57.173 --> 01:32:58.752
Then you feel guilty.

01:32:58.768 --> 01:33:02.139
When you feel guilty you catch this centre here,

01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:03.528
left Vishuddhi we call it

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:05.939
by which you develop spondylitis.

01:33:06.008 --> 01:33:07.425
If not spondylitis,

01:33:07.459 --> 01:33:10.365
there is something horrible thing can happen to you.

01:33:10.391 --> 01:33:12.686
Now according to Sahaja Yoga,

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.936
we have two types of heart attacks.

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:17.982
One is an active massive heart attack

01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:21.734
and another one is what you call lethargic

01:33:21.767 --> 01:33:23.567
like angina.

01:33:23.584 --> 01:33:28.158
So, the first one which happens

01:33:28.153 --> 01:33:29.698
is the massive one

01:33:29.703 --> 01:33:33.249
where same thing the heat reaches the heart.

01:33:33.258 --> 01:33:34.769
Now say there is a boy

01:33:34.778 --> 01:33:36.719
who is playing tennis

01:33:36.738 --> 01:33:38.739
at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two

01:33:38.778 --> 01:33:42.122
and is drinking also, competing with his father.

01:33:42.159 --> 01:33:45.462
So, he gets that massive heart attack

01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:09.785
and it is absolutely fatal.

01:36:09.865 --> 01:36:12.236
He cannot live after that.

01:36:12.295 --> 01:36:15.032
This is a very common case you must have also seen.

01:36:15.081 --> 01:36:17.988
I am not telling you something out of the blue.

01:36:18.002 --> 01:36:20.208
But the another one is

01:36:20.230 --> 01:36:23.140
if you continue with this kind of thing

01:36:23.151 --> 01:36:27.609
then maybe one day you might get massive heart attacks

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:29.419
especially the industrialists.

01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:32.379
Industrialists are so much futuristic,

01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:33.871
so much calculating

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:40.300
that they don’t calculate that this will entail

01:36:40.314 --> 01:36:42.785
their own heart trouble

01:36:42.844 --> 01:36:46.753
So, this heart suddenly collapses and they die.

01:36:46.755 --> 01:36:50.612
This is a, we call it an active heart attack

01:36:50.677 --> 01:36:52.316
due to over acting.

01:36:52.387 --> 01:36:54.526
Another one is lethargic heart attack

01:36:54.586 --> 01:36:55.796
like angina,

01:36:55.867 --> 01:36:59.996
that is if this centre is caught here, if you feel guilty.

01:37:00.026 --> 01:37:03.727
Some people are very sensitive and very formal type

01:37:03.786 --> 01:37:05.099
you know, they feel guilty,

01:37:05.117 --> 01:37:06.699
“I should have done this.”

01:37:06.717 --> 01:37:07.859
I have known people

01:37:07.877 --> 01:37:09.377
who have been crying all their life,

01:37:09.397 --> 01:37:12.604
“I spilled coffee on the table of such and such.”

01:37:12.602 --> 01:37:15.429
I say, “Let it be, now gone finished. Why are you bothered?”

01:37:15.425 --> 01:37:16.959
But they’ll go on and on and on.

01:37:16.955 --> 01:37:19.255
It’s a habit they have formed

01:37:19.304 --> 01:37:21.225
to feel guilty about this.

01:37:21.275 --> 01:37:23.905
So, about anything they start feeling guilty.

01:37:23.925 --> 01:37:28.047
In India we are not so much I think formal type

01:37:28.138 --> 01:37:29.485
of people, thank God.

01:37:29.527 --> 01:37:31.688
So, I find less cases of this

01:37:31.737 --> 01:37:35.705
but still there are many people who develop this left side.

01:37:35.735 --> 01:37:39.853
Not only with that you develop your spondylitis,

01:37:39.882 --> 01:37:44.183
but you develop a situation

01:37:44.194 --> 01:37:49.045
where heart cannot pump blood for your brain,

01:37:49.055 --> 01:37:51.777
that is angina.

01:37:51.815 --> 01:37:55.345
Nobody knows that it comes from this left side problem;

01:37:55.345 --> 01:37:57.986
Left side problems come from other things also,

01:37:58.025 --> 01:38:01.497
but one of them is feeling guilty.

01:38:01.514 --> 01:38:03.459
This is something I am telling you which

01:38:03.484 --> 01:38:06.558
is not yet told in medical science.

01:38:06.573 --> 01:38:09.610
But I am sure one day we will have it from India.

01:38:09.637 --> 01:38:10.797
We will tell these people

01:38:10.848 --> 01:38:15.587
what we know about the roots of trouble.

01:38:15.608 --> 01:38:18.092
The root of trouble is like that.

01:38:18.108 --> 01:38:21.191
So now the last but not the least

01:38:21.217 --> 01:38:23.602
is the effect of Swadishthan

01:38:23.618 --> 01:38:26.398
is this heat reaches the brain

01:38:26.448 --> 01:38:29.198
and gives you paralysis on the left hand side

01:38:29.198 --> 01:38:31.858
because you know it crosses over nerves.

01:38:31.888 --> 01:38:34.688
So, it gives you a terrible paralysis

01:38:34.668 --> 01:38:37.467
on the left-hand side but you feel it on the right-hand side.

01:38:37.477 --> 01:38:41.217
Also, nature is the one which tries to stop it.

01:38:41.237 --> 01:38:44.277
If you don’t stop, it says, “All right, I will stop your right side.”

01:38:44.274 --> 01:38:47.137
Left side will be all right.

01:38:47.143 --> 01:38:51.648
Now the one side of life is also right side.

01:38:51.628 --> 01:38:55.631
Second side, another side we can say

01:38:55.608 --> 01:38:57.517
is the side which is left side.

01:38:57.577 --> 01:38:59.837
And the left side and right side when they meet,

01:38:59.898 --> 01:39:02.827
you get psychosomatic trouble.

01:39:02.837 --> 01:39:05.708
With this Kundalini rising what happens

01:39:05.698 --> 01:39:08.327
that it nourishes those centres.

01:39:08.348 --> 01:39:10.817
For example, see this is one centre formed

01:39:10.858 --> 01:39:12.497
by two left and right side.

01:39:12.497 --> 01:39:15.341
This is a centre; left and right side.

01:39:15.349 --> 01:39:17.910
Now the Kundalini passes through this.

01:39:17.939 --> 01:39:21.180
But supposing you are using right side too much like this

01:39:21.198 --> 01:39:23.240
and suddenly left side breaks sometimes

01:39:23.248 --> 01:39:25.047
then what happens

01:39:25.099 --> 01:39:31.236
that your connection with the main,

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:33.352
you should say

01:39:33.375 --> 01:39:34.942
mains is lost.

01:39:34.976 --> 01:39:38.823
You are on your own and cancer starts.

01:39:38.845 --> 01:39:41.053
Now this cancer can be cured also;

01:39:41.075 --> 01:39:43.216
I am sorry to say but it is a fact.

01:39:43.231 --> 01:39:44.241
It can be cured.

01:39:44.256 --> 01:39:47.161
Cancer can be cured,

01:39:47.181 --> 01:39:50.844
not at a galloping stage I think but at an early stage.

01:39:50.863 --> 01:39:54.917
We have also tried some galloping stage people.

01:39:54.937 --> 01:39:56.177
They have improved

01:39:56.197 --> 01:39:59.358
but still I would say it is not guaranteed at that stage.

01:39:59.372 --> 01:40:01.743
After all nothing is guaranteed

01:40:01.813 --> 01:40:05.404
but still it works and it has worked.

01:40:05.442 --> 01:40:09.237
Now when this cancer is caused

01:40:09.257 --> 01:40:11.067
you see, what is our job

01:40:11.094 --> 01:40:13.507
is to push back this left side with the right

01:40:13.505 --> 01:40:16.890
and also through Kundalini awakening to nourish,

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.110
nourish the centre

01:40:18.179 --> 01:40:21.649
You see this is the basis for our health

01:40:21.659 --> 01:40:26.249
our... you can say... mind,

01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:29.775
everything it’s a mental, physical and emotional

01:40:29.865 --> 01:40:31.696
but also spiritual

01:40:31.756 --> 01:40:34.819
because when Kundalini rises like this;

01:40:34.845 --> 01:40:39.973
it goes crosses over this fontanelle bone area.

01:40:39.993 --> 01:40:42.642
This is Kabira has said,

01:40:42.702 --> 01:40:44.852
“Shunya shikhar par anahat baje re.”

01:40:44.933 --> 01:40:48.104
Nobody can explain what does he say.

01:40:48.122 --> 01:40:49.705
“Shunya shikhar par anahat,”

01:40:49.727 --> 01:40:50.584
is the heartbeat.

01:40:50.606 --> 01:40:55.467
How can a heartbeat come up? ‘Shunya shikhar’ means ‘on the fontanelle bone area’

01:40:55.537 --> 01:40:56.557
He was not mad

01:40:56.606 --> 01:40:59.877
but the people who do not understand

01:40:59.947 --> 01:41:04.627
cannot think that this Kundalini reaches here. It does.

01:41:04.657 --> 01:41:06.177
You can see for yourself;

01:41:06.207 --> 01:41:07.727
it does reach here

01:41:07.776 --> 01:41:12.274
and once it breaks, this sound is finished

01:41:12.296 --> 01:41:13.574
Then on your nerves,

01:41:13.604 --> 01:41:16.370
you are amazed on your central nervous system

01:41:16.429 --> 01:41:18.749
you start feeling the cool breeze

01:41:18.810 --> 01:41:22.275
of the Holy Ghost as they call it in the Bible

01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:26.371
or they call it as the Alakh Niranjan

01:41:26.425 --> 01:41:28.685
or they call it as Brahma Chaitanya.

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:31.601
You start feeling it on your fingertips,

01:41:31.621 --> 01:41:33.785
on your hands, you can.

01:41:33.811 --> 01:41:38.094
If you experience that, still you go on saying, “No, no, no. I do not believe in anything.”

01:41:38.144 --> 01:41:39.225
It’s all right.

01:41:39.285 --> 01:41:41.995
But if you really start moving into that line

01:41:42.044 --> 01:41:44.256
and start feeling that,

01:41:44.275 --> 01:41:46.026
then you are amazed

01:41:46.055 --> 01:41:49.917
because when the Kundalini rises as I told you,

01:41:49.946 --> 01:41:51.355
She helps you physically.

01:41:51.365 --> 01:41:54.807
I have told you about only one chakra but there are seven chakras.

01:41:54.825 --> 01:41:56.637
So, all these seven chakras,

01:41:56.687 --> 01:42:00.787
they give permutation, combination of these three channels.

01:42:00.796 --> 01:42:02.408
It cures all.

01:42:02.407 --> 01:42:08.800
As a result, you start enjoying your life.

01:42:08.816 --> 01:42:09.415
You become

01:42:09.429 --> 01:42:12.975
what you call a person who is a witness to this whole thing.

01:42:13.015 --> 01:42:15.084
The whole thing becomes just a drama

01:42:15.104 --> 01:42:17.256
and you start living,

01:42:17.275 --> 01:42:19.646
seeing it so clearly.

01:42:19.646 --> 01:42:22.152
This is first thing happens to you.

01:42:22.192 --> 01:42:25.334
Now if you have something serious

01:42:25.352 --> 01:42:28.031
or say something you have to operate somewhere

01:42:28.043 --> 01:42:30.081
then you are nervous already,

01:42:30.092 --> 01:42:30.954
“How can I do it?”

01:42:30.994 --> 01:42:33.422
If you are nervous, then how can you operate?

01:42:33.484 --> 01:42:36.180
And also because of specialisation

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.129
you can only do one part.

01:42:38.172 --> 01:42:40.438
I have known people, surgeons also,

01:42:40.448 --> 01:42:43.139
who have opened the body they said, “No this is not my job.

01:42:43.169 --> 01:42:46.217
This is the job of that doctor.”

01:42:46.258 --> 01:42:49.339
So, you know the complete knowledge

01:42:49.349 --> 01:42:51.195
of medical science, complete!

01:42:51.218 --> 01:42:52.874
It’s not only surgery,

01:42:52.881 --> 01:42:57.172
it’s not only what you call medicine and others;

01:42:57.172 --> 01:42:59.256
we have learnt so many.

01:42:59.265 --> 01:43:01.965
So, all that becomes a totality.

01:43:01.994 --> 01:43:03.419
In totality you know

01:43:03.425 --> 01:43:06.455
what is wrong with it on your fingertips.

01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:11.650
For diagnosis, you know a patient dies after it

01:43:11.663 --> 01:43:13.736
If somebody goes to say

01:43:13.764 --> 01:43:17.157
“Houston” for diagnosis,

01:43:17.162 --> 01:43:18.446
you should insure him

01:43:18.452 --> 01:43:21.085
because maybe he might die with diagnosis only.

01:43:21.102 --> 01:43:22.167
It’s like this,

01:43:22.192 --> 01:43:24.647
here diagnosis is only on fingertips.

01:43:24.672 --> 01:43:26.781
On the fingertips you can feel very easily

01:43:26.777 --> 01:43:28.930
what is the central catch.

01:43:28.918 --> 01:43:30.071
Now if you learn

01:43:30.057 --> 01:43:30.960
or if you know

01:43:30.958 --> 01:43:33.301
what are these centres meant for,

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:35.230
if you know what they are related to

01:43:35.247 --> 01:43:36.980
as far as your physical side is concerned

01:43:36.989 --> 01:43:38.111
for doctors,

01:43:38.130 --> 01:43:39.760
then you will know

01:43:39.782 --> 01:43:42.742
that this person is suffering from this disease.

01:43:42.772 --> 01:43:45.701
Even small children, say ten children,

01:43:45.701 --> 01:43:50.475
you tie up their eyes and ask them,

01:43:50.525 --> 01:43:52.303
“What is this person suffering from?”

01:43:52.327 --> 01:43:54.726
So immediately supposing they give this

01:43:54.733 --> 01:43:57.946
you ask that fellow, “What about your throat? Is it all right?”

01:43:57.932 --> 01:43:59.256
“Ah no, it is not all right.”

01:43:59.275 --> 01:44:00.515
But how do they know?

01:44:00.513 --> 01:44:02.973
Because on the fingertip they know,

01:44:02.989 --> 01:44:04.543
they show the finger.

01:44:04.592 --> 01:44:07.102
So, everybody will say the same thing,

01:44:07.152 --> 01:44:09.313
because it is Absolute.

01:44:09.382 --> 01:44:10.856
This All-pervading Power

01:44:10.852 --> 01:44:12.826
about which people have talked about,

01:44:12.842 --> 01:44:14.496
they have called it Brahma Chaitanya

01:44:14.502 --> 01:44:16.437
They have called it all kinds of things

01:44:16.441 --> 01:44:19.026
but they don’t know what it is.

01:44:19.026 --> 01:44:23.321
It is this power that starts flowing

01:44:23.322 --> 01:44:25.250
and when it starts flowing through you,

01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:27.420
tremendous things happen,

01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:30.271
tremendous things happen.

01:44:30.291 --> 01:44:31.992
I have known so many bureaucrats

01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:33.762
you see, were so much worried, upset;

01:44:33.792 --> 01:44:36.262
because they were honest people and were suffering.

01:44:36.292 --> 01:44:37.292
They took to Sahaja Yoga.

01:44:37.302 --> 01:44:40.151
Their lives are changed now, they are enjoying themselves.

01:44:40.141 --> 01:44:41.671
They are not bothered.

01:44:41.671 --> 01:44:45.015
Because this not only guides you,

01:44:45.012 --> 01:44:46.685
this not only gives you knowledge

01:44:46.688 --> 01:44:48.904
but also protects you all the time.

01:44:48.908 --> 01:44:50.127
I have seen many doctors

01:44:50.128 --> 01:44:52.256
who are doing say heart trouble.

01:44:52.267 --> 01:44:55.346
Heart patients they are looking after.

01:44:55.362 --> 01:44:58.273
There are doctors who are curing cancer patients

01:44:58.303 --> 01:45:03.092
I met one doctor who has a dialysis hospital;

01:45:03.152 --> 01:45:07.410
but his kidneys.

01:45:07.459 --> 01:45:10.206
I said, “Doctor, how have you got this?”

01:45:10.199 --> 01:45:14.926
So, he is just treating only people for dialysis and he gets his kidneys

01:45:14.949 --> 01:45:17.656
So, there is no protection.

01:45:17.667 --> 01:45:21.247
You should also have the protection as a surgeon has.

01:45:21.279 --> 01:45:23.330
He will tie up his hands and everything.

01:45:23.380 --> 01:45:27.567
But then otherwise normally doctors have no protection of any kind

01:45:27.595 --> 01:45:29.555
when they treat another person

01:45:29.575 --> 01:45:31.025
and if they are sensitive,

01:45:31.085 --> 01:45:34.121
they may catch from them slowly, slowly the diseases,

01:45:34.146 --> 01:45:35.971
which they are going to cure.

01:45:36.003 --> 01:45:39.102
This is also a point nobody thinks of.

01:45:39.099 --> 01:45:41.812
We are not machines, we are human beings,

01:45:41.808 --> 01:45:46.283
we are not a stone, but we are sensitive

01:45:46.301 --> 01:45:48.862
and when you see somebody suffering

01:45:48.871 --> 01:45:51.587
you catch from them.

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:52.862
You definitely catch

01:45:52.878 --> 01:45:55.320
but in Sahaja Yoga you know you are catching.

01:45:55.347 --> 01:45:58.020
In Sahaja Yoga you know what you are catching

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:02.340
and you know how to clear it out and how to protect yourself.

01:46:02.410 --> 01:46:04.910
Now this is what one doesn’t understand

01:46:04.969 --> 01:46:08.407
that all human beings can get their Self-realisation,

01:46:08.419 --> 01:46:09.487
all of them.

01:46:09.514 --> 01:46:12.643
Only thing if you are thinking

01:46:12.653 --> 01:46:15.677
that you are a great scientist

01:46:15.694 --> 01:46:19.418
and you are above everything and you have read everything,

01:46:19.444 --> 01:46:21.392
“I don’t have to know anything”,

01:46:21.408 --> 01:46:23.172
then it doesn’t work.

01:46:23.188 --> 01:46:24.563
It cannot force.

01:46:24.567 --> 01:46:27.682
Sahaja Yoga cannot force on you its knowledge, nothing.

01:46:27.717 --> 01:46:31.341
It respects you, and respects your freedom.

01:46:31.355 --> 01:46:32.865
Freedom has been given to you

01:46:32.896 --> 01:46:36.396
whether you take to it or don’t take to it, is your own.

01:46:36.396 --> 01:46:41.385
But if you want it, if you are really desirous of getting it

01:46:41.392 --> 01:46:43.355
then you get it.

01:46:43.362 --> 01:46:45.073
But with that you get knowledge

01:46:45.132 --> 01:46:47.115
not only about medical science

01:46:47.102 --> 01:46:49.536
but also about people.

01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:54.835
Now there are so many types of God men coming.

01:46:54.849 --> 01:46:57.308
Now how will you know they are not correct?

01:46:57.324 --> 01:46:59.324
How will you?

01:46:59.364 --> 01:47:03.505
How will you know that Guru Nanaka was a great,

01:47:03.495 --> 01:47:06.265
not only saint but an incarnation?

01:47:06.265 --> 01:47:07.757
How will you know about Christ?

01:47:07.807 --> 01:47:10.458
How will you know about anyone of them

01:47:10.467 --> 01:47:12.257
because you don’t know the Absolute?

01:47:12.277 --> 01:47:13.635
You are born like that,

01:47:13.648 --> 01:47:15.448
but once you are born in Sahaja Yoga,

01:47:15.497 --> 01:47:16.987
you become a Yogi.

01:47:17.037 --> 01:47:20.523
And then you know exactly that they are all one.

01:47:20.525 --> 01:47:22.083
All the Sufis are one,

01:47:22.084 --> 01:47:24.793
all these great Prophets are one.

01:47:24.823 --> 01:47:29.752
All these we can call them Prophets

01:47:29.765 --> 01:47:31.792
and also incarnations,

01:47:31.798 --> 01:47:34.121
they're altogether one.

01:47:34.099 --> 01:47:35.679
Christ himself has said,

01:47:35.748 --> 01:47:37.948
“Those who are not against us are with us.”

01:47:37.998 --> 01:47:40.360
But how many Christians understand this?

01:47:40.389 --> 01:47:43.070
So, there is no need to have different, different religions.

01:47:43.074 --> 01:47:46.854
It’s in one big huge ocean of knowledge

01:47:46.904 --> 01:47:51.124
which has different, different, we can say, ports

01:47:51.175 --> 01:47:53.932
but that doesn’t mean the ocean is different.

01:47:53.932 --> 01:47:55.928
All your problems will be solved

01:47:56.007 --> 01:47:59.898
as far as integration of religions are concerned

01:47:59.918 --> 01:48:02.348
and you don’t have to give up anything

01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:03.948
but respect everything

01:48:03.949 --> 01:48:08.577
in the right manner that you know about them.

01:48:08.585 --> 01:48:10.345
There is nothing to discard,

01:48:10.416 --> 01:48:12.998
nothing to condemn

01:48:13.015 --> 01:48:15.896
but you just, to know about them,

01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:17.942
then you are amazed

01:48:17.962 --> 01:48:21.185
how they are talking the same thing what you are talking.

01:48:21.192 --> 01:48:23.045
I have read a book

01:48:23.045 --> 01:48:27.925
written by a one great Sufi from Turkey

01:48:27.937 --> 01:48:32.822
and another I have read it with our Nisamuddin

01:48:32.846 --> 01:48:35.842
here who had written something

01:48:35.877 --> 01:48:38.292
and his disciples, just the same,

01:48:38.285 --> 01:48:40.132
they write the same thing.

01:48:40.134 --> 01:48:41.957
I mean there is no difference

01:48:41.977 --> 01:48:44.124
because absolute knowledge is the same,

01:48:44.154 --> 01:48:46.044
only expression may be different.

01:48:46.114 --> 01:48:48.775
They might use different expressions.

01:48:48.834 --> 01:48:52.757
So, you get out of this madness of religion also.

01:48:52.757 --> 01:48:55.439
Religion can never teach you to hate anyone,

01:48:55.448 --> 01:48:56.319
can never,

01:48:56.378 --> 01:49:00.879
because I am talking here about the power of love.

01:49:00.909 --> 01:49:04.527
This All-pervading Power is the power of love.

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:05.547
It guides you;

01:49:05.567 --> 01:49:06.817
it looks after you,

01:49:06.868 --> 01:49:09.303
it cooperates, it coordinates.

01:49:09.323 --> 01:49:12.023
It is so efficient a government

01:49:12.052 --> 01:49:16.808
that I don’t think we can ever imagine how efficient it is

01:49:16.832 --> 01:49:19.148
and it works just like this.

01:49:19.168 --> 01:49:21.007
Sometimes it is very amazing

01:49:21.027 --> 01:49:23.688
I will tell you now, today a case of a lady

01:49:23.777 --> 01:49:27.503
which is a true case. Is she here now?

01:49:27.507 --> 01:49:29.112
Mexican, no?

01:49:29.122 --> 01:49:30.783
She might be here

01:49:30.793 --> 01:49:32.981
See, there's a lady. You are there!

01:49:32.983 --> 01:49:34.551
She is a lady here.

01:49:34.573 --> 01:49:38.486
She was working with the UN and when I went to New York, she got her Realisation

01:49:38.545 --> 01:49:42.446
and she became a very ardent Sahaja Yogi.

01:49:42.455 --> 01:49:45.415
It rose to that thing where we call shraddha.

01:49:49.556 --> 01:49:52.181
Then she wrote to me three letters

01:49:52.241 --> 01:49:56.926
telling me about some disease her son has got

01:49:56.995 --> 01:50:01.216
who is only eighteen years of age studying in Harvard University or something.

01:50:01.315 --> 01:50:05.943
She said, “Mother this disease some people get it in my family at old age and they die.”

01:50:05.964 --> 01:50:07.935
” It’s a special Mexican disease,

01:50:07.984 --> 01:50:10.373
it’s a big name as usual you see.

01:50:10.386 --> 01:50:14.647
So, I was thinking what to write to her

01:50:14.645 --> 01:50:16.996
and we’re just paying attention.

01:50:17.056 --> 01:50:20.567
And she said, “Should I bring my child there, what should I do?” and all that.

01:50:20.576 --> 01:50:22.377
And the fourth letter I find

01:50:22.457 --> 01:50:26.828
that the doctors have said that he is completely cured,

01:50:26.837 --> 01:50:28.719
there is nothing in it.

01:50:28.725 --> 01:50:31.261
Just imagine how quick it was.

01:50:33.379 --> 01:50:34.871
I mean, I was amazed.

01:50:34.877 --> 01:50:36.481
There are so many cases like that

01:50:36.496 --> 01:50:38.051
but this is something remarkable.

01:50:38.076 --> 01:50:40.545
Where is Mexico! I was in Pune

01:50:40.636 --> 01:50:44.725
and just see how this Paramchaitanya has done it.

01:50:45.685 --> 01:50:47.935
How it is kind!

01:50:47.995 --> 01:50:52.353
It is the power of love of God which looks after you.

01:50:52.362 --> 01:50:54.092
After all the One who has created us,

01:50:54.082 --> 01:50:57.332
the Creator is going to look after us, isn’t it?

01:50:57.413 --> 01:51:04.991
But we should have also little attention towards finding out what is the truth.

01:51:04.998 --> 01:51:06.801
Don’t accept anything,

01:51:06.808 --> 01:51:09.291
you have to find out the truth first of all

01:51:09.308 --> 01:51:11.277
and everybody has said that

01:51:11.337 --> 01:51:13.872
it is the same thing as everybody has said,

01:51:13.888 --> 01:51:15.678
you should know about yourself.

01:51:16.717 --> 01:51:18.772
Guru Nanaka’s thing I will say:

01:51:18.772 --> 01:51:25.088
Kahe ray Ban khojan Jai, Sada Niwasi Sada Alepa, Tohey sang samai

01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:29.732
Pusp maday jo Bas Basat Hai, Mukur Mahey ras chayi

01:51:29.803 --> 01:51:34.558
Taisai hi Hari basay nirantar, Ghat hi khojo bhai

01:51:34.562 --> 01:51:39.018
Kahay nanak bin aapa chinay, Mitay na bhram ki kai’

01:51:39.058 --> 01:51:42.587
He said you must know yourself. “Know thyself” Christ has said.

01:51:42.678 --> 01:51:44.868
Everybody has said you should know yourself.

01:51:44.928 --> 01:51:46.848
Now what is that knowing yourself?

01:51:46.897 --> 01:51:50.854
That is nothing but you are

01:51:50.893 --> 01:51:53.904
the principle is that the truth is this

01:51:53.973 --> 01:51:57.820
that you are not this body, this mind,

01:51:57.830 --> 01:52:00.180
you are not these emotions,

01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:02.560
you are not this ego,

01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:06.973
you are not these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

01:52:06.973 --> 01:52:09.127
All our saints have said that.

01:52:09.147 --> 01:52:11.766
Now we are not on that path.

01:52:11.786 --> 01:52:15.094
We are not looking out for what are we.

01:52:15.096 --> 01:52:16.528
If we are the Spirit,

01:52:16.556 --> 01:52:19.538
then how are we to become the Spirit?

01:52:19.556 --> 01:52:21.838
Now anybody who starts talking like that,

01:52:21.879 --> 01:52:24.368
I mean, I was very much opposed by many people

01:52:24.419 --> 01:52:27.299
because they thought I was just telling lies,

01:52:27.288 --> 01:52:31.555
I am this thing, that thing, but when they got sick, they came to Me.

01:52:31.555 --> 01:52:33.167
That’s not the way.

01:52:33.167 --> 01:52:38.544
The way is to try to know that we do not know the absolute.

01:52:38.556 --> 01:52:40.913
Once you become a little humble about it

01:52:40.906 --> 01:52:42.723
that we don’t know the absolute,

01:52:42.768 --> 01:52:46.018
so the religion and science become one

01:52:46.018 --> 01:52:51.198
because you can explain it scientifically as Dr. U.C. Rai has done

01:52:51.221 --> 01:52:54.721
Scientifically, you can explain what happens.

01:52:54.710 --> 01:52:56.330
Now you don’t have to become

01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:59.603
what you call ‘karm-kandi’, ‘ritualistic’, no need

01:52:59.632 --> 01:53:02.373
There is nothing to be done ritualistically, nothing.

01:53:02.402 --> 01:53:04.364
Once you are really realised,

01:53:04.362 --> 01:53:07.022
you have to do a little meditation everyday,

01:53:07.033 --> 01:53:08.473
in the evening.

01:53:08.482 --> 01:53:14.219
Now what I also would I should say this Paramchaitanya

01:53:14.228 --> 01:53:17.877
that it gave us a chance to have a hospital in Vashi

01:53:17.879 --> 01:53:20.227
and the results are very good in Vashi.

01:53:20.259 --> 01:53:23.047
They never use to charge anything for the outdoor patients

01:53:23.047 --> 01:53:24.350
but they said, “Mother,

01:53:24.346 --> 01:53:25.940
please allow us to take ten Rupees.”

01:53:25.969 --> 01:53:29.069
I said, “All right, take ten Rupees, is all right for everything."

01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:32.569
but the people who are living inside,

01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:34.727
they are also paying little amount;

01:53:34.750 --> 01:53:37.583
nothing compared to what people pay in the hospitals.

01:53:37.596 --> 01:53:41.246
And Dr. Rai has so sacrificingly accepted.

01:53:41.266 --> 01:53:44.022
And the doctors are coming from Russia all the way.

01:53:44.051 --> 01:53:47.062
You know, Russian doctors are wonderful doctors.

01:53:47.082 --> 01:53:49.911
They are very great scientists, I must say.

01:53:49.982 --> 01:53:56.100
They have gone very far in scientific approach.

01:53:56.150 --> 01:53:58.824
They have tried to find out the energies,

01:53:58.861 --> 01:54:00.111
which are subtle energies,

01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:01.699
and lots of things they have done,

01:54:01.710 --> 01:54:03.560
but specially, they are very much interested

01:54:03.631 --> 01:54:08.388
in working through Sahaja Yoga and they are coming down here to work.

01:54:08.391 --> 01:54:12.678
Now I would not expect our doctors to come and work like that,

01:54:12.690 --> 01:54:15.178
but at least for once a week,

01:54:15.190 --> 01:54:16.868
they can give some time

01:54:16.890 --> 01:54:23.333
and they can practice Sahaja Yoga just as a blessing to the people.

01:54:23.335 --> 01:54:25.736
Our country is full of very poor people,

01:54:25.745 --> 01:54:28.665
very, very poor people, extremely poor

01:54:28.676 --> 01:54:31.065
and we feel very much concerned.

01:54:31.096 --> 01:54:32.273
People always ask Me,

01:54:32.277 --> 01:54:34.243
“Yours is such a Yoga Bhoomi

01:54:34.257 --> 01:54:36.087
then, the, why the people are poor?

01:54:36.116 --> 01:54:37.357
The poor they are,

01:54:37.366 --> 01:54:41.022
because they do not follow the right path.

01:54:41.016 --> 01:54:43.223
You see, if they follow the right path,

01:54:43.246 --> 01:54:45.705
Lakshmi is also there to bless you.

01:54:45.743 --> 01:54:47.565
There is nothing to worry about money,

01:54:47.582 --> 01:54:49.300
nothing to worry about anything

01:54:49.306 --> 01:54:55.150
and you become a person who is absolutely in balance.

01:54:55.156 --> 01:54:57.815
As soon as something comes up,

01:54:57.835 --> 01:54:59.266
some crisis come up,

01:54:59.274 --> 01:55:01.875
immediately you all become silent

01:55:01.946 --> 01:55:04.966
and you start seeing what’s wrong,

01:55:04.975 --> 01:55:06.346
what is the problem.

01:55:06.366 --> 01:55:08.276
Because you are not silent,

01:55:08.299 --> 01:55:09.426
always in the conflict,

01:55:09.439 --> 01:55:11.376
you cannot see the problem clearly

01:55:11.399 --> 01:55:13.376
and you cannot solve it,

01:55:13.379 --> 01:55:17.178
but, you actually, you don’t solve any problem.

01:55:17.199 --> 01:55:19.549
It is this, I must say this power.

01:55:19.618 --> 01:55:22.723
I also tell them I don’t do anything; I am just sitting down;

01:55:22.723 --> 01:55:24.068
this power is doing everything.

01:55:24.064 --> 01:55:25.218
They don’t believe it

01:55:25.223 --> 01:55:26.638
but it is a fact.

01:55:26.634 --> 01:55:28.338
I am not doing anything, I am just sitting,

01:55:28.353 --> 01:55:31.438
I am not planning, I am not doing anything whatsoever

01:55:31.449 --> 01:55:33.529
but this power does everything for us

01:55:33.578 --> 01:55:34.748
so why should I do it.

01:55:34.819 --> 01:55:39.060
But, it’s rather difficult for human beings to leave things to this power.

01:55:39.078 --> 01:55:42.540
Even some doctors, who have been practising Medical Science

01:55:42.558 --> 01:55:46.379
have had very funny experiences

01:55:46.390 --> 01:55:49.060
Like there’s one Dr. Amjad Ali in Australia

01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:51.017
who is very well qualified

01:55:51.011 --> 01:55:53.827
and he was experimenting

01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:57.261
on some sort of “kya kar rahe they.”

01:56:00.779 --> 01:56:03.221
So, you see that what he found

01:56:03.301 --> 01:56:07.362
when he went close to them, they start becoming smaller.

01:56:07.370 --> 01:56:08.542
He could not experiment.

01:56:08.547 --> 01:56:10.902
He said, “How my experiment will go?

01:56:10.937 --> 01:56:14.487
Because I cannot! As soon as I go near them, everything disappears,

01:56:14.487 --> 01:56:15.694
all the disease disappears,

01:56:15.717 --> 01:56:16.674
so what can I do?”

01:56:16.678 --> 01:56:18.774
I said, “You don’t experiment with that

01:56:18.783 --> 01:56:23.694
but you can experiment with the people who are already sick and do something about it.”

01:56:23.674 --> 01:56:25.163
So, there are many things like that.

01:56:25.163 --> 01:56:27.265
And another person told me that in England

01:56:27.263 --> 01:56:29.634
there is a craze for research.

01:56:29.674 --> 01:56:35.183
So, one scientist, they told him, “You find out what is minus 273,

01:56:35.243 --> 01:56:36.574
the absolute zero.

01:56:36.643 --> 01:56:41.941
So, he said, “I cannot, because the formula is such that some heat will remain always there.”

01:56:41.942 --> 01:56:42.961
I said, “All right,

01:56:42.958 --> 01:56:44.591
do one thing,

01:56:44.598 --> 01:56:48.158
you go and tell them this is absolute and how can we find absolute.”

01:56:48.174 --> 01:56:49.955
“We cannot find Absolute.

01:56:49.989 --> 01:56:53.346
It is absolutely, absolutely beyond us”.

01:56:53.355 --> 01:56:57.025
Then I said, “You use vibrations and you use these Divine vibrations.”

01:56:57.038 --> 01:57:00.091
And he achieved it. He got his doctorate and he did it.

01:57:00.098 --> 01:57:01.632
So, they asked him, “How did you do it?”

01:57:01.641 --> 01:57:03.422
He said, “I cannot explain to you.”

01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:04.792
“Because if I talk to them,

01:57:04.810 --> 01:57:06.111
they will never listen to me.

01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:08.493
These scientists, you know, they think no end of themselves.

01:57:08.511 --> 01:57:11.592
How can I tell them that I did it with this Divine Power?”

01:57:11.607 --> 01:57:14.210
They cannot believe that there is another big power

01:57:14.230 --> 01:57:16.109
After all who runs our heart?

01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:18.719
Ask the doctors who runs our heart.

01:57:18.739 --> 01:57:20.589
They will say Autonomous Nervous System.

01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:22.580
Now who is this Auto?

01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:24.127
Ask this question second one.

01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:25.217
You can’t answer.

01:57:25.232 --> 01:57:26.478
Who is this Auto?

01:57:26.484 --> 01:57:27.618
‘Auto’ you don’t know.

01:57:27.641 --> 01:57:30.391
They will just…

01:57:30.571 --> 01:57:34.431
But they are honest because they say, “We don’t know”

01:57:34.501 --> 01:57:37.211
and they have put it the name ‘Autonomous’.

01:57:37.312 --> 01:57:40.312
Now I am talking of parasympathetic nervous system,

01:57:45.392 --> 01:57:47.189
as you know very well.

01:57:47.202 --> 01:57:49.459
And we know very little about parasympathetic.

01:57:49.472 --> 01:57:50.498
It’s a fact.

01:57:50.528 --> 01:57:52.019
How for other people

01:57:52.026 --> 01:57:56.776
I will tell you that in very simple words what is parasympathetic.

01:57:56.796 --> 01:57:59.185
Now when there is some emergency,

01:57:59.175 --> 01:58:02.707
our sympathetic nervous system which is to the left and right side

01:58:02.707 --> 01:58:05.010
go into motion.

01:58:05.008 --> 01:58:06.481
Like, we have to run,

01:58:06.477 --> 01:58:11.231
then if you are running, our heart will start pumping blood.

01:58:11.247 --> 01:58:14.591
But what brings it back to normal,

01:58:14.606 --> 01:58:17.247
is the parasympathetic, in simple words.

01:58:21.117 --> 01:58:24.330
So, this parasympathetic nervous system,

01:58:24.343 --> 01:58:26.541
when it is filled with energy,

01:58:26.524 --> 01:58:30.071
when it is filled with energy it just settles down.

01:58:30.084 --> 01:58:31.760
It gets nourished

01:58:31.783 --> 01:58:35.410
and then it starts working in such a beautiful manner

01:58:35.434 --> 01:58:40.231
that you achieve so many things which you could not normally achieve.

01:58:40.242 --> 01:58:44.823
First thing that happens that you become a very peaceful personality,

01:58:46.392 --> 01:58:48.562
very peaceful.

01:58:48.582 --> 01:58:50.734
Because we are thinking,

01:58:50.738 --> 01:58:54.745
now the thoughts are rising and falling, again thoughts are rising and falling,

01:58:54.767 --> 01:58:56.885
again thoughts are rising and falling.

01:58:56.908 --> 01:59:00.794
All the time we are jumping on the cusp of the thoughts.

01:59:00.814 --> 01:59:04.055
But there is a space in between

01:59:04.095 --> 01:59:06.524
and that is in Sanskrit called ‘vilambha’.

01:59:06.584 --> 01:59:10.050
But we can call it ‘pause’ in English language.

01:59:10.059 --> 01:59:13.100
Now this is the time

01:59:13.118 --> 01:59:16.329
where we never see that point.

01:59:16.338 --> 01:59:17.740
We never are there.

01:59:17.749 --> 01:59:19.209
So, when we are jumping,

01:59:19.229 --> 01:59:21.995
we are jumping in the future or in the past

01:59:21.992 --> 01:59:24.281
For example, just now, you are sitting before Me,

01:59:24.271 --> 01:59:26.691
maybe you are thinking if they will get a train or not,

01:59:26.702 --> 01:59:28.841
a bus or not, this and that,

01:59:28.901 --> 01:59:31.312
or maybe you are thinking about your past.

01:59:31.361 --> 01:59:33.984
But you cannot be in the centre.

01:59:34.012 --> 01:59:35.535
This is the big problem.

01:59:35.555 --> 01:59:39.374
You cannot be in the present.

01:59:39.385 --> 01:59:42.325
If I say, “Be in the present”, you cannot.

01:59:42.345 --> 01:59:44.785
And in the present is reality.

01:59:44.805 --> 01:59:49.144
In the present is totality and in the present is silence.

01:59:49.144 --> 01:59:50.734
You don’t think.

01:59:50.743 --> 01:59:54.129
So, according to even to Patanjali

01:59:54.124 --> 01:59:56.629
you have to become Nirvichar.

01:59:56.638 --> 01:59:59.080
These thoughts which are bombarding your head,

01:59:59.070 --> 02:00:01.760
you have to become in charge of them,

02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:03.830
you have to be in control with them.

02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:06.316
So, what happens? You become Nirvichar,

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:07.606
without any thoughts.

02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:09.075
It’s a thoughtless awareness.

02:00:09.073 --> 02:00:12.006
And this thoughtless awareness

02:00:12.024 --> 02:00:16.606
is the one that gives you complete peace within yourself.

02:00:16.613 --> 02:00:18.537
People talk of peace, other.

02:00:18.544 --> 02:00:20.863
I know of people who have got peace awards,

02:00:20.856 --> 02:00:23.869
big, big, such hot-tempered people

02:00:23.879 --> 02:00:27.452
that you have to approach them with a barge pole.

02:00:27.461 --> 02:00:31.062
I don’t know from what angle they are talking about peace

02:00:31.093 --> 02:00:33.204
but they have got peace awards.

02:00:33.224 --> 02:00:36.836
Big, big people like that I have known who have got peace awards.

02:00:36.843 --> 02:00:39.204
Peace has to come within.

02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:41.649
When human beings become peaceful,

02:00:41.653 --> 02:00:42.943
there won’t be any quarrels,

02:00:42.984 --> 02:00:47.178
no fights, no wars and no politics.

02:00:47.195 --> 02:00:48.705
If you are peaceful,

02:00:48.774 --> 02:00:51.238
then you are so satisfied,

02:00:51.265 --> 02:00:55.638
you're as in Hindi, they say, “Apney me hi sama jatey hai,”

02:00:55.624 --> 02:00:57.917
you are satisfied with yourself.

02:00:57.919 --> 02:01:01.885
You don’t get into the mad rush

02:01:01.928 --> 02:01:07.146
of approaching somebody, encroaching somebody,

02:01:07.184 --> 02:01:09.303
aggressing on someone;

02:01:09.314 --> 02:01:13.004
no, you are with yourself in complete peace.

02:01:13.024 --> 02:01:16.193
As a result, so many things happen.

02:01:16.243 --> 02:01:19.367
Maybe I am the oldest person living here.

02:01:19.356 --> 02:01:22.796
Nobody can be more in age

02:01:22.845 --> 02:01:25.162
because I am seventy-four now. I will be seventy-five.

02:01:25.185 --> 02:01:26.423
So, you can imagine.

02:01:26.446 --> 02:01:32.057
But at peace when you are, you are not having any such ideas of aggression,

02:01:32.077 --> 02:01:33.617
aggression or anything.

02:01:33.617 --> 02:01:36.198
You become absolutely peaceful

02:01:36.216 --> 02:01:39.321
and this peace is very required today

02:01:39.327 --> 02:01:41.856
for this world to come to something

02:01:41.888 --> 02:01:44.691
which we call as a peaceful world.

02:01:44.707 --> 02:01:47.861
By fighting, by quarrelling you can never achieve peace.

02:01:47.876 --> 02:01:50.606
I have seen people going with the flags,

02:01:50.675 --> 02:01:54.167
now fight for peace and fight for this, no need.

02:01:54.146 --> 02:01:57.948
If you become peaceful everything works out so well

02:01:57.955 --> 02:02:01.649
and this Paramchaitanya is with you to help you.

02:02:01.673 --> 02:02:03.919
There is no need to fight anybody,

02:02:03.934 --> 02:02:07.198
to aggress anybody or to trouble anybody

02:02:07.224 --> 02:02:10.249
This is very important for doctors

02:02:10.258 --> 02:02:12.990
and for also business people

02:02:12.999 --> 02:02:14.809
Now the problem of business people

02:02:14.809 --> 02:02:17.189
because they told me there are some business people also

02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:20.539
is their stress which is a common disease.

02:02:21.981 --> 02:02:24.823
They are the same, very futuristic, you know,

02:02:24.841 --> 02:02:28.006
all the time calculating, very, very futuristic.

02:02:28.002 --> 02:02:30.256
And in America, a new disease has developed,

02:02:30.272 --> 02:02:32.352
they call it ‘yuppies disease'

02:02:45.837 --> 02:02:48.537
That disease is such a horrible thing it is,

02:02:48.618 --> 02:02:52.086
it is that your rational mind just goes out,

02:02:52.107 --> 02:02:54.307
your conscious mind just goes out,

02:02:54.328 --> 02:02:56.207
you can’t even lift your hand,

02:02:56.218 --> 02:02:58.546
you can’t even lift your fingers

02:02:58.573 --> 02:03:03.290
and people carry you just like what you can call a

02:03:03.292 --> 02:03:04.941
reptile on your body.

02:03:04.952 --> 02:03:06.910
You can think all right,

02:03:06.934 --> 02:03:12.133
you can talk all right,

02:03:12.223 --> 02:03:13.781
you can plan all right,

02:03:13.794 --> 02:03:15.441
calculate all right

02:03:15.441 --> 02:03:16.520
but you cannot walk,

02:03:16.501 --> 02:03:17.740
you cannot lift your hand,

02:03:17.751 --> 02:03:19.611
you cannot do anything.

02:03:19.631 --> 02:03:22.470
This is a new disease that has come in America

02:03:22.481 --> 02:03:26.894
and is spreading all over and I have seen one patient also here.

02:03:26.914 --> 02:03:31.243
So, what I am trying to say that going with this your stress,

02:03:31.245 --> 02:03:33.633
all kind of things can happen.

02:03:33.664 --> 02:03:37.338
Now why this stress is there, that also we should know.

02:03:38.225 --> 02:03:39.662
First of all,

02:03:39.653 --> 02:03:42.861
the Kundalini has started working in this Kali Yuga

02:03:42.863 --> 02:03:44.111
in these times.

02:03:44.113 --> 02:03:46.520
Secondly, if you see these two centres,

02:03:46.537 --> 02:03:49.017
two Nadis or two channels,

02:03:49.068 --> 02:03:50.848
we call Ida and Pingala Nadi.

02:03:50.857 --> 02:03:55.153
So, the Pingala Nadi creates Ego within us,

02:03:55.178 --> 02:03:56.973
as it is shown there,

02:03:56.977 --> 02:03:58.133
you see, the yellow one.

02:03:58.136 --> 02:04:02.214
It creates a balloon like.

02:04:02.229 --> 02:04:05.555
Then the second one is the Ida Nadi

02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:08.944
which also creates a balloon.

02:04:08.966 --> 02:04:12.162
Now Ida [Pingala] Nadi creates the ego balloon

02:04:12.185 --> 02:04:16.923
and the left side one creates the superego, means conditionings

02:04:16.946 --> 02:04:18.843
Now if you are identified with something,

02:04:18.850 --> 02:04:20.772
if you are conditioned within you with something,

02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:22.761
then these two are there.

02:04:22.821 --> 02:04:25.015
But when you are too much right sided,

02:04:25.051 --> 02:04:29.658
these are all – you see the ego moves and covers the left side.

02:04:29.658 --> 02:04:32.028
So, there is a blockage, complete blockage.

02:04:32.087 --> 02:04:34.488
Now whatever problems you have

02:04:34.548 --> 02:04:37.044
they cannot pass out of your body.

02:04:37.051 --> 02:04:39.334
That makes you weaker and weaker

02:04:39.341 --> 02:04:42.274
and that’s how you have stress.

02:04:42.301 --> 02:04:43.865
With this Kundalini,

02:04:43.883 --> 02:04:46.004
these two move out like that

02:04:46.062 --> 02:04:50.763
and is opened out and you become one with this Divine Power.

02:04:50.792 --> 02:04:54.886
Now as far as the brain is, for there are some neurosurgeons also,

02:04:54.912 --> 02:04:57.055
as far as the brain is concerned,

02:04:57.115 --> 02:04:59.876
we know that we use wee part of our brain,

02:04:59.886 --> 02:05:01.825
very little part of our brain.

02:05:01.825 --> 02:05:05.644
But once you get this Kundalini then it enlightens

02:05:05.655 --> 02:05:10.885
so many areas of your head that you just know

02:05:10.955 --> 02:05:13.115
Sometimes people ask Me, “Mother, how do you know?”

02:05:13.155 --> 02:05:15.915
“I know. I don’t know how I know.”

02:05:15.926 --> 02:05:17.566
There is no technique for it.

02:05:17.566 --> 02:05:18.736
Just I know.

02:05:18.756 --> 02:05:20.495
They say, “Mother, how do you know this thing?

02:05:20.517 --> 02:05:21.535
How do you know?”

02:05:21.546 --> 02:05:22.845
Somebody wrote me a letter

02:05:22.866 --> 02:05:25.185
and I said, “Who has written this letter, I know.”

02:05:25.196 --> 02:05:26.584
And I told them,

02:05:26.584 --> 02:05:28.055
they said, “Mother, how do you know?”

02:05:28.084 --> 02:05:31.345
I said, “I know for definite this is the one who has written.”

02:05:31.345 --> 02:05:33.174
I don’t know that person. I have never seen him.

02:05:33.174 --> 02:05:35.113
I've never seen his hand writing

02:05:35.194 --> 02:05:37.334
but I said, “I know who has written this letter.”

02:05:37.330 --> 02:05:38.694
Just I know.

02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:42.017
But I wouldn’t say that it’s something great

02:05:42.027 --> 02:05:46.407
that I should know because I just know without any work,

02:05:46.621 --> 02:05:49.085
without any thinking,

02:05:49.126 --> 02:05:53.327
without any managing. Just automatically I know everything.

02:05:53.476 --> 02:05:57.016
So, once you become that, you don’t have to worry.

02:05:57.190 --> 02:06:02.091
Now, for example, I know, also, a lady doctor in Delhi,

02:06:02.130 --> 02:06:03.759
no in Bombay.

02:06:03.770 --> 02:06:06.569
She is the one who is a surgeon.

02:06:06.571 --> 02:06:12.926
She said, “Mother I could know that this man has tumour,

02:06:12.926 --> 02:06:16.926
very much low in his brains but it will come out.”

02:06:16.937 --> 02:06:20.676
So, she said, “Then I was just giving vibrations first.

02:06:20.690 --> 02:06:23.333
I said let me try first the vibrations on that.”

02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:25.933
They said, “No, No, there is no tumour on that side.”

02:06:25.951 --> 02:06:28.763
She said, “It is here. I know I can feel it; it is here.”

02:06:28.761 --> 02:06:31.092
They wouldn’t, they started arguing with her

02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:33.638
and then they found out the tumour where she said,

02:06:33.650 --> 02:06:35.027
exactly there.

02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:36.368
They said, “How do you know?”

02:06:36.389 --> 02:06:38.596
She said, “I don’t know how do I know.”

02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:41.748
So even the children can tell where is the problem,

02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:46.078
in your head, in your brain, what is happening.

02:06:46.078 --> 02:06:51.429
Now to look after your brain is very important that you don’t go into imbalances

02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:53.190
because if you go into imbalance,

02:06:53.239 --> 02:06:56.924
your right side will develop or your left side will develop.

02:06:56.942 --> 02:06:59.867
Actually, the right side develops on the left

02:06:59.982 --> 02:07:02.597
and the left side develops on the right.

02:07:02.887 --> 02:07:06.298
Now also I don’t know how far the medical science has gone

02:07:06.347 --> 02:07:10.238
up to the understanding as to left and right side

02:07:10.298 --> 02:07:14.064
are two different complementary systems.

02:07:14.119 --> 02:07:16.930
I don’t know if that they accept, do they?

02:07:19.912 --> 02:07:25.675
But in Sahaja Yoga you will discover that there are two complementary systems.

02:07:27.905 --> 02:07:30.749
One is right sided; one is left sided.

02:07:30.765 --> 02:07:34.889
And when the right side is too much then the left side might act

02:07:34.889 --> 02:07:38.189
or when the left side is too much, then right side may act.

02:07:38.198 --> 02:07:40.789
You see it’s a complimentary two systems

02:07:40.858 --> 02:07:43.477
and if you go on one system all the time

02:07:43.526 --> 02:07:46.727
then you become right sided or left sided.

02:07:46.736 --> 02:07:49.537
Now left sided are the people who are not futuristic

02:07:49.546 --> 02:07:53.066
but who are the people who live in the past.

02:07:53.075 --> 02:07:56.666
Now of course I don’t want to, just now, discuss about it very much

02:07:56.689 --> 02:08:01.492
because it’s also more confusing for people.

02:08:01.499 --> 02:08:03.151
Because they don’t want to believe

02:08:03.169 --> 02:08:05.548
that there is something like dead souls

02:08:05.588 --> 02:08:12.142
or they don’t want to believe in the viruses being dead vegetables

02:08:12.146 --> 02:08:15.394
and things like that but it is.

02:08:15.407 --> 02:08:16.843
On the left-hand side,

02:08:16.834 --> 02:08:20.093
we have got all our past since our creation.

02:08:20.093 --> 02:08:22.505
So, if somebody gets virus you give antibiotics,

02:08:22.519 --> 02:08:25.524
you do what you like, it won’t go.

02:08:25.548 --> 02:08:28.200
Only Sahaja Yoga can drive it out.

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:31.365
Only through Sahaja Yoga you can cure viruses

02:08:31.380 --> 02:08:34.289
because only Sahaja Yoga can act on the left side.

02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:39.459
Many mad people, crazy people have been cured through Sahaja Yoga.

02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:45.483
Also, it gives you a good idea about

02:08:45.479 --> 02:08:48.544
how you can show people,

02:08:48.553 --> 02:08:51.122
who is mad and who is not mad.

02:08:51.124 --> 02:08:54.193
Like I had a program in Pune in the beginning

02:08:54.193 --> 02:09:00.573
and they arranged it in a hall which was owned by some Brahmins.

02:09:00.606 --> 02:09:03.860
So, when I went there, they said, “No, no, She is not a Brahmin

02:09:03.845 --> 02:09:05.510
so we can’t give Her the hall.

02:09:05.521 --> 02:09:07.369
So, Sahaja Yogis were mischievous,

02:09:07.401 --> 02:09:10.619
they said, “All right, we will give it in the newspaper that they are refusing

02:09:10.631 --> 02:09:12.119
because She is not a Brahmin.”

02:09:12.122 --> 02:09:14.838
“No, no, don’t do like that we will have it.”

02:09:14.861 --> 02:09:17.619
So, I didn’t know what was happening behind the back.

02:09:17.678 --> 02:09:19.439
When I went there, I was sitting there.

02:09:19.448 --> 02:09:23.903
Very interesting I saw about twenty-five people sitting in front of me shaking

02:09:23.892 --> 02:09:25.472
like this

02:09:25.483 --> 02:09:26.628
“Mother, stop it, stop it

02:09:26.642 --> 02:09:28.023
we know Your powers, stop it.”

02:09:28.023 --> 02:09:29.793
I said, “I am not doing anything, you are….”

02:09:29.812 --> 02:09:33.660
They said, “Now, also there are people who are shaking like this.”

02:09:33.653 --> 02:09:36.090
So, I said, “Ask them, who they are?”

02:09:36.106 --> 02:09:40.369
They said, “We are certified mad from Thana.

02:09:40.376 --> 02:09:42.736
We have come here with our superintendent

02:09:42.756 --> 02:09:45.300
because You had cured one mad man.”

02:09:45.309 --> 02:09:48.760
“So”, they said, “Are we also mad?” “Yes, there is something wrong.”

02:09:48.778 --> 02:09:50.349
So, the thing was

02:09:50.369 --> 02:09:53.628
they were thinking the Brahmins are the highest or something like that.

02:09:53.658 --> 02:09:56.012
Is all nonsensical ideas

02:09:56.041 --> 02:09:58.820
because Brahmin is that which knows the Brahma,

02:09:58.841 --> 02:10:01.519
which knows All Pervading Power.

02:10:01.541 --> 02:10:05.372
And because of these funny ideas, they have tortured all the saints.

02:10:05.432 --> 02:10:07.890
Specially in Maharashtra

02:10:07.890 --> 02:10:11.809
people have tortured all the saints all the time.

02:10:11.834 --> 02:10:15.053
So, where you have so many saints

02:10:15.104 --> 02:10:16.266
and so many people

02:10:16.276 --> 02:10:19.711
then you must know that it was just to work out

02:10:19.729 --> 02:10:23.081
the brains of these close-minded people.

02:10:23.108 --> 02:10:28.329
But to open them out is only possible I think when they are in difficulties.

02:10:28.389 --> 02:10:31.325
When they are not in difficulties they don’t want to accept.

02:10:31.338 --> 02:10:34.334
Supposing they are sick then they will come to Me.

02:10:34.347 --> 02:10:37.963
Now if you cure somebody sick, you see once he is cured, he is finished.

02:10:37.968 --> 02:10:41.788
He doesn’t do any Sahaja Yoga; he doesn’t want to help anyone.

02:10:41.858 --> 02:10:46.018
But if there is a person who is healthy,

02:10:46.049 --> 02:10:48.353
who is perfectly all right

02:10:48.349 --> 02:10:50.804
and who is knowledgeable,

02:10:50.799 --> 02:10:53.244
if he comes to Sahaja Yoga, he will be such a help

02:10:53.244 --> 02:10:57.746
to this, I should say, to this poor country.

02:10:57.753 --> 02:11:01.045
This country is suffering from tremendous poverty.

02:11:01.063 --> 02:11:02.909
Now only saying,

02:11:02.938 --> 02:11:06.329
“Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao” (“Eliminate poverty!”)

02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:09.719
I know of one gentleman who was a great corrupt fellow

02:11:09.739 --> 02:11:13.195
and who used to live in one room with a little cot.

02:11:13.215 --> 02:11:15.047
I said, “Why do you live like this?”

02:11:15.065 --> 02:11:17.987
He said, “Because, everybody is garib [poor] so I want to live like garib.”

02:11:17.996 --> 02:11:20.217
I said, “Why don’t you give all this money to these garibs?

02:11:20.235 --> 02:11:22.076
Why are you lying like this?”

02:11:22.096 --> 02:11:24.715
He said, “All right, you suggest to me any organisation

02:11:24.786 --> 02:11:29.096
which is absolutely above board and I will move.”

02:11:29.096 --> 02:11:31.753
That was a difficult thing, a decision.

02:11:31.755 --> 02:11:33.012
But what I am trying to say

02:11:33.045 --> 02:11:35.454
only by saying people are garib, garib,

02:11:35.514 --> 02:11:37.844
you have to attend to that

02:11:37.854 --> 02:11:40.586
and is only possible through Sahaja Yoga.

02:11:40.586 --> 02:11:41.485
How?

02:11:41.491 --> 02:11:46.050
Sahaja Yoga is practiced mostly by middle class.

02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:50.440
Both the sides are – one side are the poor, another side are the rich.

02:11:50.511 --> 02:11:53.820
Rich are very few. But more by the middle class.

02:11:53.833 --> 02:11:57.710
Then it’s like a river which expands on both the sides

02:11:57.730 --> 02:12:02.257
This time I was, I mean, I have been always thinking that

02:12:02.259 --> 02:12:05.070
I have to do something for the poor people,

02:12:05.097 --> 02:12:08.489
something, always and I have done also, on my own,

02:12:08.503 --> 02:12:11.659
but I wanted Sahaja Yogis to contribute, Indian Sahaja Yogis.

02:12:11.654 --> 02:12:14.308
So, I told them I want to start a place

02:12:14.304 --> 02:12:18.043
where we could have these women

02:12:18.038 --> 02:12:22.128
who are standing on the roads with their children asking for alms.

02:12:22.172 --> 02:12:24.979
We can have something to help them.

02:12:24.999 --> 02:12:28.183
Immediately, I was surprised Sahaja Yogis contributed to me

02:12:28.212 --> 02:12:32.402
for that and I was so amazed at their enthusiasm.

02:12:32.425 --> 02:12:34.663
I said, “This is the generosity.

02:12:35.207 --> 02:12:38.413
This generosity that has come to Sahaja Yogis.”

02:12:38.663 --> 02:12:43.243
And then when they said, “Mother this is we have got all this through Sahaja Yoga

02:12:43.263 --> 02:12:47.323
We have improved so much that we don’t have to worry.”

02:12:47.357 --> 02:12:51.676
And they so generously, I mean a person becomes extremely generous.

02:12:51.696 --> 02:12:53.756
He becomes very peaceful;

02:12:53.777 --> 02:12:58.127
he becomes generous and he starts enjoying the generosity.

02:12:58.131 --> 02:13:00.627
I mean people earn such a lot of money.

02:13:00.622 --> 02:13:03.281
Everything they should do there is no harm.

02:13:03.352 --> 02:13:06.051
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like sanyasa.

02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:07.855
Nobody has to take sanyas.

02:13:07.841 --> 02:13:10.616
Nobody has to go out of his family,

02:13:10.645 --> 02:13:15.587
out of his … nothing. It’s all here. Why to go anywhere?

02:13:15.587 --> 02:13:19.053
So, you have to be a very normal person.

02:13:19.102 --> 02:13:21.402
But one thing is important,

02:13:21.453 --> 02:13:26.286
you must have the pure desire to get your Realisation.

02:13:26.305 --> 02:13:30.344
If you don’t have that pure Realisation then it doesn’t work out.

02:13:30.355 --> 02:13:32.187
Apart from that it might work

02:13:32.205 --> 02:13:33.826
but you go on dropping down

02:13:33.837 --> 02:13:36.399
because if you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga

02:13:36.388 --> 02:13:40.589
or if you want to, say, achieve some power out of it.

02:13:40.587 --> 02:13:41.895
You see, you are so powerful

02:13:41.917 --> 02:13:45.160
that you don’t have to ask for power or anything.

02:13:45.185 --> 02:13:48.710
You don’t know how it works and how it gives.

02:13:48.716 --> 02:13:51.500
First of all, only we have to believe

02:13:51.500 --> 02:13:56.721
that we are reflections of God Almighty.

02:13:56.741 --> 02:13:59.281
We're not just human beings.

02:13:59.290 --> 02:14:02.772
Specially, to be born in India

02:14:02.781 --> 02:14:04.754
you must have done lots of punyas,

02:14:04.781 --> 02:14:09.122
otherwise you cannot be born in this great country I can tell you.

02:14:09.152 --> 02:14:12.801
All this, you see, is all nonsense that is going on,

02:14:12.812 --> 02:14:16.370
is just skirmishes on the periphery,

02:14:16.393 --> 02:14:20.382
but if you see the culture,

02:14:20.433 --> 02:14:23.674
the love, affection we have,

02:14:23.687 --> 02:14:26.964
the understanding of value system we have,

02:14:26.968 --> 02:14:28.234
you can’t imagine it.

02:14:28.259 --> 02:14:30.283
When you go abroad, you are amazed.

02:14:30.299 --> 02:14:33.203
you don’t know how to tell them.

02:14:33.218 --> 02:14:34.533
They're so stupid,

02:14:34.603 --> 02:14:38.484
I tell you, very stupid people, nothing to learn from them.

02:14:38.544 --> 02:14:43.433
I have been fighting with the stupidity of people specially Americans.

02:14:43.493 --> 02:14:48.159
I'm surprised, I think that they are not yet grown up as human beings.

02:14:48.358 --> 02:14:51.159
The way they talk, the way they understand.

02:14:51.199 --> 02:14:54.882
They only like people who will come and tell them stories

02:14:54.908 --> 02:14:57.638
and make fool out of them, make lot of money.

02:14:57.689 --> 02:14:59.961
To me they said, “We cannot take to Sahaja Yoga.”

02:14:59.940 --> 02:15:00.981
I said, “Why?”

02:15:00.969 --> 02:15:02.257
“Because you don’t take money,

02:15:02.270 --> 02:15:04.009
what is your validity?

02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:06.549
If you don’t take money then you have no validity,

02:15:06.609 --> 02:15:09.347
why should we believe in you because …”

02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:13.950
I said, “Supposing I take money, then?” “Then we can prosecute you.”

02:15:13.990 --> 02:15:17.200
I said, “Go and prosecute all these people who have looted you”.

02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:19.416
Nobody could prosecute them.

02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:25.102
So, this is we should not look to them for understanding of life.

02:15:25.106 --> 02:15:26.501
They have not yet understood.

02:15:26.491 --> 02:15:28.632
We have to look to ourselves.

02:15:28.657 --> 02:15:30.723
We have such a heritage.

02:15:30.767 --> 02:15:32.892
You can imagine, thousands of years back,

02:15:32.886 --> 02:15:34.926
we have been talking of Brahma,

02:15:34.977 --> 02:15:40.301
we have been talking of absolute truth.

02:15:40.321 --> 02:15:43.601
In what country they have this kind of knowledge.

02:15:43.601 --> 02:15:44.588
No country.

02:15:44.591 --> 02:15:48.955
So, first of all we should be very proud to be an Indian.

02:15:48.972 --> 02:15:50.394
That’s very important.

02:15:50.405 --> 02:15:53.144
Even Sahaja Yogis from abroad they dress up like Indians

02:15:53.185 --> 02:15:55.274
and they have taken to our culture,

02:15:55.274 --> 02:15:56.961
our style of culture.

02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:59.316
I need not tell you about the Western Culture

02:15:59.376 --> 02:16:01.990
as I was really shocked.

02:16:01.997 --> 02:16:05.651
Then I thought I better write down something about them

02:16:05.761 --> 02:16:07.522
as a witness whatever I saw.

02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:09.901
So, there is nothing to learn from them,

02:16:09.971 --> 02:16:13.910
but one day will come, they have to come here.

02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:16.379
All the doctors have to come here.

02:16:16.408 --> 02:16:20.459
I am very thankful, very, very thankful

02:16:20.468 --> 02:16:24.229
to this Indian Medical Association especially.

02:16:24.276 --> 02:16:29.939
I never expected and I am very grateful to them for this

02:16:29.942 --> 02:16:33.989
because I know in this country if the doctors take it up,

02:16:34.009 --> 02:16:37.594
all over the world they will have to understand

02:16:43.682 --> 02:16:50.475
the value of our knowledge of life and of Medical Science.

02:16:52.023 --> 02:16:55.494
I would say that I have seen so many people sitting here

02:16:55.534 --> 02:16:56.895
I don’t know how many are doctors,

02:16:56.903 --> 02:17:00.585
how many are from industries and how many are Sahaja Yogis.

02:17:00.581 --> 02:17:04.095
Whatever it is, one has to know that all of us

02:17:04.108 --> 02:17:07.719
are blessed by the same reflection of God Almighty

02:17:07.778 --> 02:17:11.091
within ourselves which we should experience.

02:17:11.531 --> 02:17:14.997
After that you will tell me what has happened to you,

02:17:15.001 --> 02:17:18.127
what you have felt and what you had.

02:17:18.142 --> 02:17:21.937
It’s a thing, is a matter of your right to have it.

02:17:21.944 --> 02:17:24.567
It’s your right to have that power

02:17:24.578 --> 02:17:27.479
but you have to ask for it.

02:17:27.539 --> 02:17:30.258
If you don’t ask for it, I cannot force it on you.

02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:32.258
Nobody can force it on you.

02:17:32.318 --> 02:17:34.260
It is a very spontaneous happening

02:17:34.339 --> 02:17:39.149
and it works out, so fast, so fast.

02:17:39.149 --> 02:17:41.202
I must tell you in Russia,

02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:43.919
this hall of course has fallen short

02:17:43.979 --> 02:17:49.307
but in Russia you always have it in big-big huge places

02:17:49.316 --> 02:17:52.316
with sixteen thousand, eighteen thousand

02:17:52.397 --> 02:17:55.986
and they are so much

02:17:56.066 --> 02:17:58.673
I don’t know, endowed with shraddha,

02:17:58.664 --> 02:18:01.823
so much that in the program only they get it.

02:18:01.823 --> 02:18:05.443
Only in the program! I could not understand.

02:18:05.453 --> 02:18:08.214
And they had a meeting of the scientists there,

02:18:08.234 --> 02:18:10.962
about two hundred and fifty scientists came.

02:18:10.982 --> 02:18:13.763
So, I started telling them about science to begin with.

02:18:13.832 --> 02:18:17.082
I said better be on their level at least to talk to them.

02:18:17.102 --> 02:18:20.111
So, one of them got up and said,

02:18:20.127 --> 02:18:23.102
“Mother, don’t tell us about this science, we know everything.

02:18:23.122 --> 02:18:25.582
Now, you tell us the science of God,

02:18:25.562 --> 02:18:26.502
science of Divine.

02:18:26.504 --> 02:18:27.711
You tell us about this.”

02:18:27.714 --> 02:18:30.453
I was amazed, look at these Russians!

02:18:30.533 --> 02:18:33.073
So, I found out all these countries

02:18:33.084 --> 02:18:37.369
like Bulgaria, Russia, Romania and all these five countries,

02:18:37.374 --> 02:18:40.369
there the people are like clean slates,

02:18:40.357 --> 02:18:42.167
they have no conditioning,

02:18:42.238 --> 02:18:43.678
they don’t know anything about God,

02:18:43.738 --> 02:18:46.618
they don’t know anything about books, nothing.

02:18:46.667 --> 02:18:48.548
Absolutely, they are not conditioned

02:18:48.537 --> 02:18:50.858
and the way they have achieved this Sahaja Yoga

02:18:50.841 --> 02:18:52.999
I have been really amazed at this.

02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:57.472
Romania I was amazed and I just told them,

02:18:57.490 --> 02:19:02.332
one paper I read – not read, I never read – I told them about one thing

02:19:02.352 --> 02:19:05.819
and the medical, same thing like this, was there

02:19:05.839 --> 02:19:08.289
and they gave me a Doctorate,

02:19:08.310 --> 02:19:11.990
not honorary but real Doctorate, on that knowledge.

02:19:11.986 --> 02:19:12.999
Can you imagine?

02:19:12.975 --> 02:19:15.350
I mean it’s not possible.

02:19:15.365 --> 02:19:18.021
First, I didn’t know, I have never known these things,

02:19:18.015 --> 02:19:20.941
so one of my disciples, “Mother, you have become a Doctor!”

02:19:20.946 --> 02:19:23.350
I said, “That I think I have, already.”

02:19:23.368 --> 02:19:25.789
“No, no this is a real Doctorate, real.”

02:19:25.839 --> 02:19:28.026
I said, “Really, how they have done?”

02:19:28.028 --> 02:19:29.687
Such sensitive people

02:19:29.687 --> 02:19:31.966
but this sensitivity comes

02:19:31.968 --> 02:19:35.776
perhaps may be that they were very much oppressed and troubled

02:19:35.805 --> 02:19:40.227
and also, they had no conditioning of anything.

02:19:40.214 --> 02:19:44.298
And it’s very surprising they have no sense of possessiveness.

02:19:44.310 --> 02:19:48.470
Their Government said, “You take your own flats and look after.”

02:19:48.510 --> 02:19:52.190
So, they said, “No, no, no we don’t want. You look after.”

02:19:52.201 --> 02:19:54.621
They said, “All right whatever cars you have given, you take them.”

02:19:54.690 --> 02:19:57.283
“No, no, no, no. What a headache. You better look after.

02:19:57.302 --> 02:19:59.148
What is the use of taking them?

02:19:59.197 --> 02:20:02.523
Because after all when we die it will be left here.”

02:20:02.557 --> 02:20:05.013
So, such unconditioned minds

02:20:05.043 --> 02:20:07.113
and such clean slates I tell you!

02:20:07.143 --> 02:20:10.306
In the same way we are also very much,

02:20:10.302 --> 02:20:14.442
Indians are very much capable,

02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:17.704
very much more capable than they are.

02:20:18.194 --> 02:20:19.694
Once they get it, they get it

02:20:19.764 --> 02:20:21.993
and they can go very deep into it

02:20:22.014 --> 02:20:24.583
because our life is very deep.

02:20:24.603 --> 02:20:27.743
Our, culture is very deep.

02:20:27.833 --> 02:20:31.123
We have had thanks to all the Saints and all the Sufis

02:20:31.183 --> 02:20:39.263
and all the incarnations that basically our genes are very good.

02:20:39.284 --> 02:20:42.863
But with Sahaja Yoga you can even change the genes,

02:20:42.873 --> 02:20:44.223
we have shown you.

02:20:44.253 --> 02:20:47.662
You can change the genes also in Sahaja Yoga.

02:20:47.662 --> 02:20:50.822
And we should not accept anybody because he says,

02:20:50.882 --> 02:20:55.056
“His genes are bad, so he should be allowed to be what he is.”

02:20:55.127 --> 02:20:56.346
It’s not that.

02:20:56.417 --> 02:21:00.326
Everything changeable and to say that genes are

02:21:00.397 --> 02:21:04.552
just the cause of your own style,

02:21:04.549 --> 02:21:05.933
it’s not so.

02:21:05.938 --> 02:21:08.842
Because one child will have different genes,

02:21:08.862 --> 02:21:10.833
another child will have another genes

02:21:10.853 --> 02:21:12.603
So how can that be?

02:21:12.603 --> 02:21:14.333
So, it’s not from the parents,

02:21:14.333 --> 02:21:16.293
it’s not from anything,

02:21:16.322 --> 02:21:23.561
circumstances but it is with your own reactions to things that you develop genes.

02:21:23.583 --> 02:21:27.211
So, what happens with genes is that

02:21:27.231 --> 02:21:31.975
you become a very, very religious man,

02:21:32.065 --> 02:21:35.598
very religious in the real sense

02:21:35.567 --> 02:21:40.228
Not religion because you pray too much nothing but inside,

02:21:40.248 --> 02:21:42.148
inside you are so religious.

02:21:42.168 --> 02:21:44.394
And religion is what is love,

02:21:44.418 --> 02:21:47.648
love for humanity is religion

02:21:47.659 --> 02:21:49.629
and that becomes so innate

02:21:49.639 --> 02:21:52.239
and so in born and you enjoy.

02:21:52.268 --> 02:21:53.598
you see loving people.

02:21:53.589 --> 02:21:56.101
You enjoy giving your love to others.

02:21:56.118 --> 02:21:58.371
Even those who hate you,

02:21:58.379 --> 02:22:01.221
you love to give them love

02:22:01.237 --> 02:22:05.237
because you think hatred after all is due to ignorance,

02:22:05.286 --> 02:22:09.119
is not because he hates you really but ignorance.

02:22:09.199 --> 02:22:12.779
And you start seeing the whole thing in a very different vision.

02:22:12.844 --> 02:22:16.183
So, I have a great vision of our country

02:22:16.243 --> 02:22:20.961
achieving that en masse emancipation,

02:22:20.973 --> 02:22:24.201
awakening and so let the whole world come here.

02:22:24.203 --> 02:22:28.134
Once, they came just to give us slavery.

02:22:28.183 --> 02:22:32.704
Now, let them come here to learn what is Divine.

02:22:32.714 --> 02:22:35.194
And you all can do it very well.

02:22:35.345 --> 02:22:37.644
You don’t have to read many books,

02:22:37.684 --> 02:22:38.834
nothing of the kind.

02:22:38.854 --> 02:22:40.515
We don’t give also books to people

02:22:40.575 --> 02:22:42.714
because if you give them books

02:22:42.835 --> 02:22:45.899
they will just become masters of the books

02:22:45.899 --> 02:22:49.213
and will not achieve anything they should go deep down

02:22:49.293 --> 02:22:51.894
First of all, they should be themselves

02:22:51.895 --> 02:22:54.215
completely one with the Divine.

02:22:54.282 --> 02:22:56.344
Otherwise they are not entitled,

02:22:56.378 --> 02:22:58.278
they have no powers.

02:22:58.337 --> 02:23:01.414
When you are not empowered, how will you do the job?

02:23:01.697 --> 02:23:04.474
But for that you don’t have to spend too much time,

02:23:04.507 --> 02:23:07.068
five minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening.

02:23:07.128 --> 02:23:09.071
If you can meditate nothing like it

02:23:09.074 --> 02:23:10.733
and you will be surprised

02:23:10.793 --> 02:23:13.563
that all your thought process will slow down

02:23:13.594 --> 02:23:16.923
so much so that you can see clearly

02:23:16.983 --> 02:23:20.862
what is right, what is wrong.

02:23:20.873 --> 02:23:23.052
What’s going wrong with you also

02:23:23.112 --> 02:23:24.643
because you get self-knowledge.

02:23:24.702 --> 02:23:26.552
And also, with others

02:23:26.603 --> 02:23:29.463
because you develop a new dimension

02:23:29.534 --> 02:23:33.253
which we call as collective consciousness,

02:23:33.273 --> 02:23:35.293
Samuhik Chaitanya,

02:23:35.333 --> 02:23:36.913
collective consciousness.

02:23:36.994 --> 02:23:40.878
Sitting down here you can feel the vibrations of Mr. Clinton.

02:23:40.938 --> 02:23:44.867
or you can feel the vibrations of any person anywhere,

02:23:44.887 --> 02:23:46.426
sitting down here.

02:23:46.458 --> 02:23:49.327
Now if you know how to correct these vibrations,

02:23:49.318 --> 02:23:50.766
your own vibrations,

02:23:50.786 --> 02:23:53.268
you can correct the vibrations of others.

02:23:53.338 --> 02:23:56.909
You can correct the vibrations sitting down here

02:23:56.941 --> 02:23:58.909
of other people who are far away.

02:23:58.902 --> 02:24:01.742
But of course, you can also correct the vibrations

02:24:01.791 --> 02:24:04.309
of people who are with you.

02:24:04.339 --> 02:24:07.519
In your family there are people who are mad,

02:24:07.979 --> 02:24:09.366
You can correct them.

02:24:09.388 --> 02:24:11.530
So, we can have very good families

02:24:11.539 --> 02:24:13.790
and we could have very good marriages.

02:24:13.808 --> 02:24:15.750
It has many dimensions Sahaja Yoga

02:24:15.778 --> 02:24:19.693
but today is the day I want to really thank you all

02:24:19.754 --> 02:24:23.643
the medical science people, and the industrialists,

02:24:23.643 --> 02:24:26.292
that they should now take to Sahaja Yoga

02:24:26.353 --> 02:24:28.729
and make the best of their lives,

02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:32.689
lives which are brought in this great country of Yoga

02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:34.820
where you can easily achieve.

02:24:34.889 --> 02:24:37.899
In this country, it is so full of vibrations,

02:24:37.979 --> 02:24:40.626
so full of vibrations, you won’t believe.

02:24:40.706 --> 02:24:42.987
I was coming from London with my husband,

02:24:43.057 --> 02:24:45.099
and I told him, “We have touched India.”

02:24:45.107 --> 02:24:47.929
He said, “How do you know?” I said, “See the vibrations all around.

02:24:47.937 --> 02:24:49.979
It’s only in India you feel these vibrations.”

02:24:49.987 --> 02:24:52.229
So, he went to the pilot just to find out.

02:24:52.237 --> 02:24:55.888
He said, “Sir, only a minute back we touched India.”

02:24:55.907 --> 02:24:58.629
So, this is such a great country you have.

02:25:03.118 --> 02:25:05.614
And if we could just develop that feeling

02:25:05.618 --> 02:25:07.584
that we are Indians

02:25:07.618 --> 02:25:10.088
and it is our responsibility

02:25:10.118 --> 02:25:13.078
to see that our knowledge goes all over

02:25:13.118 --> 02:25:15.262
and let people take advantage of it.

02:25:15.352 --> 02:25:17.291
By that we don’t criticise anyone.

02:25:17.381 --> 02:25:19.812
By that we don’t condemn anybody, as I have told you,

02:25:19.881 --> 02:25:24.873
but we give them the basis of all the knowledge,

02:25:24.893 --> 02:25:30.153
and that, in Sahaja Yoga, you can do it very well.

02:25:30.193 --> 02:25:32.891
I would say that instead of reading the book

02:25:32.907 --> 02:25:35.121
better get your Realisation

02:25:35.129 --> 02:25:36.629
because Kabira himself has said it,

02:25:36.698 --> 02:25:39.761
“Padhi Padhi pundit murakh bhayo,

02:25:39.801 --> 02:25:43.021
pundit bhayo na koye, dhai akshar prem ka,

02:25:43.041 --> 02:25:45.301
seekhe to pundit hoye.”

02:25:45.315 --> 02:25:51.922
Even after studying all books and scriptures a scholar becomes a fool, nobody becomes a scholar.

02:25:51.922 --> 02:25:56.522
Whoever learns two and a half words of love, he becomes a scholar.

02:25:56.581 --> 02:25:58.703
Thank you very much.
