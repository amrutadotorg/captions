1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:11,944
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

2
00:00:13,152 --> 00:00:16,997
I think we have not understood

3
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:22,645
the significance of Bhairavnath

4
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:32,488
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

5
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:09,374
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

6
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:25,240
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

7
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:39,934
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

8
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:50,307
For example, people have a hot temper,

9
00:01:50,467 --> 00:01:54,740
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

10
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:10,227
And if a person is in a big temper,

11
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:16,239
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

12
00:02:16,444 --> 00:02:18,995
to cool him down.

13
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:34,344
He organises everything under his own control

14
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:37,838
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

15
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:42,864
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

16
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:59,336
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

17
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:05,517
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

18
00:03:05,677 --> 00:03:08,282
then somehow or other,

19
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:11,532
Bhairavnath will organize,

20
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,809
also with the help of Hanumana,

21
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:21,209
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

22
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,846
So, for example, people who are depressed

23
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:50,641
or who become left-sided,

24
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:56,767
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

25
00:03:56,927 --> 00:04:03,127
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

26
00:04:03,287 --> 00:04:07,246
very much more to come out of it.

27
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:27,610
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

28
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:35,629
It is very difficult for a person

29
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:39,514
who is very left-sided,

30
00:04:39,674 --> 00:04:45,427
who is all the time feeling very sad,

31
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:48,863
unhappy and worried,

32
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,068
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

33
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,096
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

34
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:11,533
does not enjoy any collectivity,

35
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:14,186
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

36
00:05:14,346 --> 00:05:19,414
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

37
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,146
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

38
00:05:37,306 --> 00:05:39,169
is something superior.

39
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:44,633
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

40
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:57,349
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

41
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,496
all the time thinks,

42
00:05:59,656 --> 00:06:02,253
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

43
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,503
I'm so depressed," this, that,

44
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:07,807
all the time expecting from others something,

45
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:13,260
also cannot enjoy the collective.

46
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,332
Such a left-sided person will find

47
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:39,915
everything is something unhappy.

48
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:50,788
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

49
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,014
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

50
00:06:55,174 --> 00:06:58,580
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

51
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,995
So, we went to have our food

52
00:07:09,155 --> 00:07:14,101
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

53
00:07:22,368 --> 00:07:25,925
but then a car came in and we went there.

54
00:07:30,214 --> 00:07:33,027
Then they said that

55
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:36,315
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

56
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:40,440
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

57
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,561
So this lady started saying,

58
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:56,844
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

59
00:07:57,004 --> 00:08:00,236
and we can't get a seat."

60
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:12,139
I said, "This is all fun;

61
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:14,728
this is not something a problem."

62
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:18,457
This 'problema' word should be given up.

63
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,927
This is a new word I have learned,

64
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:34,436
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

65
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:36,860
in our young age.

66
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:50,877
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

67
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:53,826
to find everything negative

68
00:08:53,986 --> 00:09:00,307
is the way we really spoil our left side.

69
00:09:09,356 --> 00:09:11,954
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

70
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:17,681
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

71
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,117
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

72
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:31,687
everything was fine.

73
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,111
I said, "See now, you were only counting

74
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:38,503
how many negative things there are,

75
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,741
and you were not seeing the fun."

76
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,161
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

77
00:09:57,321 --> 00:10:00,449
"You take Bhairava's name,

78
00:10:05,048 --> 00:10:07,036
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

79
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:08,923
and right hand on the Mother Earth

80
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:13,128
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

81
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,957
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

82
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:26,247
always light in His hand.

83
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:34,896
And He runs up and down

84
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:42,186
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

85
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:54,044
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

86
00:10:58,022 --> 00:11:01,974
One of the negativities are that,

87
00:11:02,134 --> 00:11:05,451
"This is mine",

88
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:18,817
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

89
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,093
So then, you see, once you get attached

90
00:11:26,253 --> 00:11:29,432
in this manner, what you find,

91
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:35,827
that your children also become negative.

92
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:49,565
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

93
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:58,342
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

94
00:12:01,702 --> 00:12:04,277
Are you only seeing problema

95
00:12:04,437 --> 00:12:08,612
or you are seeing some fun in it?

96
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,583
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

97
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:32,009
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

98
00:12:36,953 --> 00:12:41,524
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

99
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:43,756
"Oh, what a day!"

100
00:12:47,635 --> 00:12:50,681
Nothing can please them.

101
00:12:51,942 --> 00:12:58,144
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

102
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:01,869
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

103
00:13:09,152 --> 00:13:15,720
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

104
00:13:18,285 --> 00:13:21,873
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

105
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:25,231
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

106
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:29,547
then how can there be ignorance?

107
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:41,891
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

108
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:44,328
if you hide, run away,

109
00:13:44,488 --> 00:13:48,715
you will say that there is negativity.

110
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:58,204
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

111
00:13:58,364 --> 00:14:03,769
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

112
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:13,158
So those people who cannot become collective,

113
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:19,254
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

114
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:33,840
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

115
00:14:38,592 --> 00:14:42,724
They say, there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

116
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:51,578
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

117
00:14:54,654 --> 00:14:59,801
They are saying, "See there're so many problem, ecological problem."

118
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:02,100
They are drunkards, all drunk,

119
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,106
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

120
00:15:06,266 --> 00:15:10,331
When will this end?"

121
00:15:19,773 --> 00:15:22,275
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:27,524
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

123
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:38,962
Then the third one says,

124
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:43,396
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

125
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:52,899
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

126
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:03,509
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

127
00:16:06,752 --> 00:16:12,665
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

128
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:16,755
They cannot see fun at all,

129
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:20,108
they cannot enjoy at all,

130
00:16:23,497 --> 00:16:25,951
and they become very,

131
00:16:26,055 --> 00:16:28,525
sort of think they are very meditative,

132
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:32,491
they are some higher people, they are something superior

133
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:35,621
in negativity.

134
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:52,742
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

135
00:16:55,545 --> 00:17:01,303
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

136
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,233
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

137
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,875
and while going there I met a lady,

138
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,743
and she was quite all right, I mean,

139
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,268
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

140
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:23,652
so I started talking to her.

141
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:33,344
And she started talking very wisely:

142
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:35,883
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

143
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:39,362
I think it isn't necessary that he should be helped,

144
00:17:39,522 --> 00:17:41,229
and we should not do this, that..."

145
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:45,486
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

146
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:56,617
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

147
00:17:56,662 --> 00:18:00,234
and no one loves her.

148
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:10,228
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

149
00:18:13,872 --> 00:18:17,756
Suddenly the doctor came in

150
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:21,767
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

151
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:25,113
I said, "What's this?"

152
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:34,551
So the doctor sent for people that,

153
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:36,260
"Catch hold of this woman!"

154
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,594
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

155
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:49,737
and why are You talking to her?"

156
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:56,261
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

157
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:03,145
Maybe in My presence, her bhoots might have a little bit

158
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:05,363
run away and were playing tricks,

159
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:10,092
but you can see that, clearly.

160
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:18,589
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

161
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:22,639
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

162
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,317
"You see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

163
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:29,153
this is this and this is that,"

164
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:31,961
and all the time wasting your precious life

165
00:19:32,121 --> 00:19:37,252
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

166
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:50,498
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

167
00:19:50,658 --> 00:19:54,438
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

168
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:02,595
So, one has to know that

169
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:06,942
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

170
00:20:10,306 --> 00:20:13,961
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

171
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:21,261
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

172
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:30,721
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

173
00:20:32,246 --> 00:20:37,000
and funny ideas about attachments

174
00:20:40,442 --> 00:20:43,772
and also the depressiveness.

175
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:46,982
So, today we are, I am very happy

176
00:20:47,142 --> 00:20:50,882
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

177
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:56,410
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

178
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:05,800
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

179
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,069
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

180
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:14,253
and goes to the right side.

181
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:25,165
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

182
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:32,018
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

183
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:44,745
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath’s statue

184
00:21:44,905 --> 00:21:48,806
which is really Swayambhu.

185
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:55,084
And people are more left-sided,

186
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:58,810
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

187
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:06,774
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

188
00:22:06,934 --> 00:22:09,641
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

189
00:22:09,801 --> 00:22:15,186
and put His light there, make a flame.

190
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,018
I mean, the police takes them.

191
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:32,510
And then they ask him, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

192
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:42,899
And they confess what wrong they have done.

193
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:52,751
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

194
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:56,412
sly things like thieving.

195
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,947
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

196
00:23:07,107 --> 00:23:11,340
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

197
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:22,750
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

198
00:23:25,414 --> 00:23:31,298
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

199
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:39,219
So, today we are here to worship

200
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:41,821
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

201
00:23:41,981 --> 00:23:46,554
who incarnated on this earth later on,

202
00:23:54,513 --> 00:23:58,021
ultimately as Mahavira also.

203
00:23:59,155 --> 00:24:03,913
So, He stands on the gate of hell

204
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:10,959
and stops people from falling into hell.

205
00:24:15,482 --> 00:24:17,881
But if you want to go to hell,

206
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:21,169
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

207
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:22,876
that I should go to hell, then He says,

208
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:26,925
'All right, you can go.'

209
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:39,636
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people.

210
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:49,537
So, it’s better that we should try to fight our negativity

211
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:56,601
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

212
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,922
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

213
00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:18,346
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

214
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:34,828
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

215
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:44,991
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

216
00:25:53,549 --> 00:25:57,119
May God bless you all.
