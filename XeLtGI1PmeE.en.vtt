00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:16.261
Today we have gathered here to do the Kundalini
Puja or the Adishakti Puja.

00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:23.180
There's a difference between the two.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:47.101
Adishakti is the total power of God, of His
desire; while Kundalini

00:00:47.101 --> 00:01:05.621
is the one that is reflected, part, which
is reflected in the human beings as Kundalini.

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:12.692
So there's a difference between the Adi Kundalini
and the Adishakti.

00:01:12.692 --> 00:01:31.471
Adishakti is the Parashakti, is the power,
which is beyond all the powers, which controls

00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:50.151
all the powers and one of the powers of Adishakti
is Kundalini.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:02:01.641
For example the Kundalini which is placed
within Me in the triangular bone is not totality

00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:04.591
of Me.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:12.680
In the same way the Kundalini, which is placed
within you, is not the totality.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:22.710
Of course it is the power, which is there
to give you your self-realization.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:34.940
Is the power that redeems you, that nourishes
you, that enlightens your centers.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:44.460
But there are two other powers as you know
very powerful, which are working through Ida

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:56.600
and Pingala and the third one is Mahalakshmi
which is in the center.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:15.290
Now Kundalini's main job is to give you your
self-realization because She is your individual

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.260
Mother.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:28.470
Everyone has the Kundalini within himself
or herself reflected whatever maybe the quality

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.981
of that person.

00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:36.530
Now as you see reflections fall on everything.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:45.880
Say, the reflection of the Moon falls on the
stone; you don't see any reflection.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:58.390
It then falls on a better reflector - say
the water, then we can see the reflection.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:11.881
But when it falls on a mirror, which is very
nicely made, say in Belgium, it reflects better.

00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:17.731
So that is how the reflection gradually goes
on improving.

00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:29.671
In the same way we have human beings who have
different reflectors but they can be improved

00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:36.970
and they can be made absolutely top class,
its possible.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.101
It depends now here it comes into other powers
that are within.

00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:48.780
One power which is the desire.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:57.220
Though the Kundalini as you see is the power
of pure desire that it doesn't want anything.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.321
But it wants to give you self-realization.

00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:10.761
The other two powers - one of them is the
mundane desire.

00:05:10.761 --> 00:05:23.291
This mundane desire if it becomes nothing
but pure desire, then Kundalini has no problems

00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:26.520
from the left side.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:39.780
But if it is not a pure desire, but full of
other desires - for example: the first desire

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.471
of human beings, which comes from animals
I think, is food.

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:53.511
He wants food to nourish himself.

00:05:53.511 --> 00:06:01.631
But human being don't only take food to nourish,
also for the taste of it, or for the beauty

00:06:01.631 --> 00:06:07.411
of it, which is innately working in them.

00:06:07.411 --> 00:06:27.141
That's why we run after food, which is very
good, very tasty, all kinds of ideas we have

00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:30.391
and there's no standard.

00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:40.671
Somebody can like this, somebody can like
that, but the one who understands that the

00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:55.621
taste of the food is not important and can
practice it, then it works.

00:06:55.621 --> 00:07:16.190
It works wonders because the lowest desire,
which is of food, comes under your control.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:25.641
If you can sometimes go without food, of course
not for God but for yourself, God doesn't

00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:27.771
want you to starve.

00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:43.891
If you can live without food, if you can enjoy
every type of food, then you have done a lot

00:07:43.891 --> 00:07:52.481
to improve the path of Shushumna for the Kundalini.

00:07:52.481 --> 00:08:07.080
I've seen in many cases that Kundalini just
doesn't rise, She doesn't rise, even if She

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.370
rises, She falls back.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:22.511
This happens when a person is very self-indulgent
- is all the time thinking of things, which

00:08:22.511 --> 00:08:32.051
are not of very great importance for Spirituality.

00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:47.401
Apart from this there's another horrible one
desire we have is to grab as much money as

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:52.171
possible, to think about money.

00:08:52.171 --> 00:08:58.771
This time I had a bad experience because Sahaja
Yogis came down to Me and told Me, "Mother

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:04.491
they are asking if I, if we should reduce
the puja money or something?"

00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:08.091
I was shocked because I never decide about
it.

00:09:08.091 --> 00:09:11.491
It's all decided by the leaders.

00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:16.031
I said, "I am not concerned."

00:09:16.031 --> 00:09:22.711
Then they would like to have a bargain as
you have in the shop you see or maybe some

00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.271
sort of a sale or some sort of a thing.

00:09:25.271 --> 00:09:31.561
This is one of the greatest dangers in your
ascent.

00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:35.700
For a guru people pay millions and millions.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:41.551
Where you know I am working it out for your
projects, I am buying lands for you, I am

00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:46.241
doing things for you and for which you need
money.

00:09:46.241 --> 00:09:53.371
But nobody comes forward with any donations
as such.

00:09:53.371 --> 00:10:01.021
They won't, they don't understand that it
is for you I have to have all these things

00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:09.881
not for Me and they pestered people many a
times like this.

00:10:09.881 --> 00:10:15.310
Once suddenly they decided that we could have
fifty percent payment.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:21.461
Immediately so many telephone - "Ah are you
going to have fifty percent less the bargain

00:10:21.461 --> 00:10:22.461
price?

00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:25.161
We are coming for the bargain".

00:10:25.161 --> 00:10:28.580
Is the sale programming.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:34.321
For example in the sale what do they do?

00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:46.671
They offer you something, so that they can
get a lot more customers or things like that.

00:10:46.671 --> 00:10:51.544
Sahaja yoga is just the opposite of that.

00:10:51.544 --> 00:10:55.281
You don't have to give anything but you get
lot.

00:10:55.281 --> 00:11:01.961
But this is not for sale; this is not for
sale by any chance.

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:09.961
It is a thing where you have to pay because
we have to have all these things and I have

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:16.080
to pay so many things which you do not know
- like last time we had about I think fifty

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.601
people who came just free.

00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:23.341
Some of the leaders know.

00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:30.851
But some of the leaders, they just go on asking
like this because I don't know perhaps they

00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:36.501
want to save money or they want to popularize
themselves among the disciples maybe, that

00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:42.471
is the reason.

00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:53.551
So this thinking about money itself is a very
detrimental force for your spirituality.

00:11:53.551 --> 00:11:56.711
Otherwise what others are doing is the same.

00:11:56.711 --> 00:12:00.661
All the time they are thinking of money, thinking
of money.

00:12:00.661 --> 00:12:09.421
Now if you are thinking of money and thinking
of earning more, for Sahaja Yoga to help Sahaja

00:12:09.421 --> 00:12:12.171
Yoga it's all right.

00:12:12.171 --> 00:12:14.510
But it is for yours own ideas.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.010
In the West it's very common.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:26.101
Not in India I must tell you, we; India is
the poor country but one day Yogi told Me,

00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:30.401
"Mother I need some money for the school".

00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:32.361
I said, "All right I'll give you".

00:12:32.361 --> 00:12:34.080
"No, no", he said, "I'll collect".

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:37.361
And he collected in one meeting eighteen lakhs
of Rupees.

00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:45.700
Of course I told him, "Now don't take it,
I've got money to pay, don't collect".

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.501
But so much of money orientation all the time.

00:12:50.501 --> 00:13:01.511
Thinking about money, saving money, these
things are absolutely against Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:01.511 --> 00:13:04.281
You can ask anyone how much I understand about
money.

00:13:04.281 --> 00:13:11.201
I don't understand banking, I cannot count,
even thousand pounds I cannot count.

00:13:11.201 --> 00:13:15.611
I'll count them two thousand or three thousand;
I don't know what I do?

00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:19.911
My brain goes off when it comes to money.

00:13:19.911 --> 00:13:20.941
I don't know how to count.

00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:27.051
I am not worried about what money we have,
what we have, what we have to do is this money

00:13:27.051 --> 00:13:34.950
is here let us do something about it.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:40.161
Today I don't know why I have to tell about
this gross subject.

00:13:40.161 --> 00:13:45.390
But it has been pointed out to Me, "Mother
you never say anything about it and the people

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.991
are getting really materialistic".

00:13:48.991 --> 00:13:51.711
That's a very sad affair.

00:13:51.711 --> 00:13:58.351
Even one person, who is materialistic, will
have to go out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:58.351 --> 00:14:10.371
Gradually it will work that way and you'll
be surprised that you are out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:10.371 --> 00:14:21.370
It is very amazing how after getting realization
also, getting on top of the world, we still

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:31.810
live in small little holes like rats of this
money business.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:43.211
This money has brought so much problems to
our world, you can see it clearly.

00:14:43.211 --> 00:14:50.071
All this Economics and all this knowledge
of Economics where it has gone?

00:14:50.071 --> 00:14:52.930
Is the world better by it?

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:59.620
There's recession going on everywhere, everybody
is unemployed.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:05.390
In every country you go there's unemployment
so much; this is so much.

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:14.401
That shows that this Economics is also a very
artificial science and dealing with the weakness

00:15:14.401 --> 00:15:21.711
of human being, not with their strength.

00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:28.841
If they could know the strength of human beings,
they would have done much better than they

00:15:28.841 --> 00:15:33.471
have done so far.

00:15:33.471 --> 00:15:46.830
I'll give a simple example: Now, we have very
sophisticated places in the West, very sophisticated.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:55.401
You know they have everything electrical,
you push the button and everything is there.

00:15:55.401 --> 00:15:59.921
Specially in these modern planes when I travel,
I don't know which one to push because they

00:15:59.921 --> 00:16:09.580
are so slim and so delicate you see, need
a special artist to do that.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.880
All this is for what for getting more money,
and more money and impressing people.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:23.880
But at the same time people are fed up; when
all these sophistications are on.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.591
They are fed up with computers, they are fed
up with electricity, they are fed up with

00:16:28.591 --> 00:16:34.341
cement, they are fed up all kinds of artificial
thing, is a fact.

00:16:34.341 --> 00:16:39.830
More, more, much more in the West than in
the developing countries.

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.021
They are just fed up.

00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:48.990
Now this is the force, this is the strength.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.781
Why are they fed up?

00:16:50.781 --> 00:17:00.771
They are fed up because they have realized
it doesn't give you joy.

00:17:00.771 --> 00:17:04.301
It doesn't give you soothing feeling.

00:17:04.301 --> 00:17:08.001
It irritates them.

00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:22.481
So it is against human mind, human character
or human civilization, something inhuman.

00:17:22.481 --> 00:17:24.191
So now what to do?

00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:34.781
I went to America once, and went to see a
friend of ours and all the houses were covered

00:17:34.781 --> 00:17:37.651
with the cow dung color you see.

00:17:37.651 --> 00:17:44.331
I said, "Why do they have these cow dung all
over these houses you know?

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.351
What is the matter with them?

00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:51.041
Why don't they have nice white or another
people like very much is this sand color?

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:56.591
He said, "Now a days these Americans want
to have cow dung."

00:17:56.591 --> 00:17:58.901
I said, "Cow dung!

00:17:58.901 --> 00:18:00.061
For what?"

00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:02.871
"Because they are fed up of cement.

00:18:02.871 --> 00:18:06.671
Now they can't get so much cow dung here.

00:18:06.671 --> 00:18:15.591
So they have a special way of making cement
look like cow dung.

00:18:15.591 --> 00:18:23.151
They mix up things so the color comes out
like cow dung".

00:18:23.151 --> 00:18:26.691
I said, "Why the cow dung of all the things
you see?"

00:18:26.691 --> 00:18:33.961
So they said that some of them went to India
and they had to sleep in some huts, which

00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:37.231
were covered with cow dung.

00:18:37.231 --> 00:18:46.501
So they found out logically that cow dung
if we have, it will be the most soothing color

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.611
for us.

00:18:48.611 --> 00:18:55.631
And so there were articles about it and people
have started using cow dung.

00:18:55.631 --> 00:18:59.051
So what is the force now behind?

00:18:59.051 --> 00:19:00.941
What is the strength?

00:19:00.941 --> 00:19:10.791
The strength is that they want to live in
natural way; they don't want to have artificial

00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:13.561
things.

00:19:13.561 --> 00:19:16.901
So they go to another extreme to have cow
dung.

00:19:16.901 --> 00:19:23.061
Sahaja Yoga is in between.

00:19:23.061 --> 00:19:31.541
Now one has to understand that whether you
put cow dung or you put cement or anything,

00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:34.361
it's not going to give you joy.

00:19:34.361 --> 00:19:47.651
Say for India people who have got cement houses
are great, you know?

00:19:47.651 --> 00:19:54.781
According to them cement represents luxury
and also rank.

00:19:54.781 --> 00:20:03.971
But in the West if people see cement, my goodness,
cement means to them it is something like

00:20:03.971 --> 00:20:07.151
a grave.

00:20:07.151 --> 00:20:15.081
So now the positive thing that is in with
them is that they now want to live with a

00:20:15.081 --> 00:20:19.341
natural things.

00:20:19.341 --> 00:20:23.321
They want to use natural material.

00:20:23.321 --> 00:20:26.611
Natural life.

00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:35.121
But to the extreme if they go you see we had
anti culture like hippyism and all that.

00:20:35.121 --> 00:20:36.641
It brought no luck.

00:20:36.641 --> 00:20:52.181
So to get from one end to another extreme
it also not conducive to a human life because;

00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:56.761
and you see a human being cannot become primitive.

00:20:56.761 --> 00:21:03.951
Even if he tries to dress up like a primitive
person his brain is modern.

00:21:03.951 --> 00:21:13.681
So when they get fed up from one to another,
they don't realize that what is the missing

00:21:13.681 --> 00:21:17.201
point?

00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:27.811
In both the things whether you live like a
rustic person or a very cementy person, any

00:21:27.811 --> 00:21:40.461
type you might live, the missing point is
that in everything there is a competition.

00:21:40.461 --> 00:21:45.131
Once it starts the fashion all right everybody
will have cane chairs; everybody is having

00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:51.161
cane chairs.

00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:59.581
Now in this competition, they miss the point
is the joy.

00:21:59.581 --> 00:22:09.451
A person who is a realized soul will not desire
whether it is cement or anything or anything

00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:12.541
doesn't matter its just the same.

00:22:12.541 --> 00:22:26.311
But it will come to his mind that all these
artificial things are ruining human beings.

00:22:26.311 --> 00:22:27.861
So he'll say no.

00:22:27.861 --> 00:22:40.591
But he will not have hair like the primitive
people; he'll not behave like primitive people

00:22:40.591 --> 00:22:47.461
and lead a very normal, natural life.

00:22:47.461 --> 00:22:53.441
So when the mind starts thinking something
about it, it will never get to the point of

00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:59.781
joy, from one end to another.

00:22:59.781 --> 00:23:07.871
So they think that they are going into a balance,
they are going into dharma.

00:23:07.871 --> 00:23:12.351
My experience is different.

00:23:12.351 --> 00:23:18.871
Even those who were hippies I know them, they
used to eat like real gluttons and they are

00:23:18.871 --> 00:23:25.761
very much interested in their comforts and
they would go to any extent of snatching anything

00:23:25.761 --> 00:23:27.871
of that belongs to somebody else.

00:23:27.871 --> 00:23:35.381
They thought they now become hippies so they're
already the landlords, because they have given

00:23:35.381 --> 00:23:39.201
up this, they have given up that.

00:23:39.201 --> 00:23:49.841
So the mind that suggest that to overcome
your money orientation, your competition and

00:23:49.841 --> 00:23:56.651
all these artificial things you should change
your life style.

00:23:56.651 --> 00:24:03.011
But that doesn't help, never.

00:24:03.011 --> 00:24:10.171
It's just a play of the mind from one to another.

00:24:10.171 --> 00:24:19.311
So how to detach yourself from this idea of
money orientation?

00:24:19.311 --> 00:24:31.341
Whether you wear a sanyasi's dress or you
wear a wonderful - some very expensive dress,

00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:35.401
is the same to the body.

00:24:35.401 --> 00:24:38.611
You can't even see your own dress.

00:24:38.611 --> 00:24:42.321
So is the same to the eyes.

00:24:42.321 --> 00:24:54.591
But with the mind you start convincing yourself
that now I've become a big sanyasi because

00:24:54.591 --> 00:24:59.041
I am wearing a saffron dress.

00:24:59.041 --> 00:25:07.001
By wearing that kind of a dress you can never
get rid of this nonsense.

00:25:07.001 --> 00:25:10.011
So first thing you have to be a normal person.

00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:14.921
There is no need to be abnormal outside.

00:25:14.921 --> 00:25:28.261
That you are deceiving yourself.

00:25:28.261 --> 00:25:36.461
If you think by changing your dress, attire,
your lifestyle you have become a great sanyasi

00:25:36.461 --> 00:25:44.271
or a great, detached person from this money
orientation then I must say, 'don't deceive

00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:47.331
yourself'.

00:25:47.331 --> 00:26:04.461
A person who is detached from within helps
the Kundalini to rise constantly without any

00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:09.751
catches.

00:26:09.751 --> 00:26:21.841
So for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to introspect
and see for himself what is your level?

00:26:21.841 --> 00:26:30.671
As I told you about the reflector what sort
of a reflector you are?

00:26:30.671 --> 00:26:37.351
No use deceiving yourself because Sahaja Yoga
is for you, for your benevolence and your

00:26:37.351 --> 00:26:42.741
Kundalini is for your benevolence.

00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:53.781
The ascent is the aim of your life and to
perfect it is your job.

00:26:53.781 --> 00:27:02.951
So you don't have to take to anything outside.

00:27:02.951 --> 00:27:13.761
It is inside you have to see yourself what
sort of attachments you have.

00:27:13.761 --> 00:27:22.961
The second force which is, I am surprised
how has suddenly come up among Sahaja Yogis

00:27:22.961 --> 00:27:25.691
that they don't have immorality problems.

00:27:25.691 --> 00:27:30.041
They have just become moral, most of them.

00:27:30.041 --> 00:27:35.591
Ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, I think
are moral people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:35.591 --> 00:27:43.381
There may be here and there because they enjoy
their morality.

00:27:43.381 --> 00:27:49.761
Because they enjoy their morality they want
to be that.

00:27:49.761 --> 00:27:55.281
Not only that they want their children to
be moral, their families to be moral.

00:27:55.281 --> 00:28:01.621
And that is how morality is spreading in Sahaja
Yoga very fast.

00:28:01.621 --> 00:28:10.261
In that also one has to understand that it
is the innocence, which is the force.

00:28:10.261 --> 00:28:16.091
Not the morality like some people write to
Me, "Mother I get up in the morning, I sit

00:28:16.091 --> 00:28:23.371
before the photograph, I do this, I do that,
then I take my bath and then I do this."

00:28:23.371 --> 00:28:29.801
I don't, I cant understand this, no not necessary.

00:28:29.801 --> 00:28:36.791
You have to cleanse yourself once in the night
as you cleanse yourself - your body.

00:28:36.791 --> 00:28:42.201
And once in the morning you have to pray,
that's all.

00:28:42.201 --> 00:28:47.711
Is not necessary to have this ritualism, this
kind of a rigmarole.

00:28:47.711 --> 00:28:50.821
Oh all the time you go in.

00:28:50.821 --> 00:28:58.151
Everyday morning till evening nonsensical
these things and they become fanatic.

00:28:58.151 --> 00:29:04.891
They start becoming absolutely fanatic about
Sahaja yoga and this fanaticism can be very

00:29:04.891 --> 00:29:13.581
dangerous because they try to remember everything
by heart this and that.

00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:16.891
No, not necessary.

00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:23.791
It should be in the heart because it amounts
to the lip service there and with the lip

00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:30.271
service gradually you start feeling you are
great, your father is great, you this and

00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:31.271
that.

00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:33.151
So you are thrown away.

00:29:33.151 --> 00:29:39.301
You yourself throw yourself out like a, I
can say like a - you hit a ball and it comes

00:29:39.301 --> 00:29:45.041
back like, I've seen people - many who try
to thrust themselves in Sahaja Yoga just are

00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:49.731
repelled back by themselves, not by Sahaja
Yoga.

00:29:49.731 --> 00:29:54.861
Sahaja Yoga attracts you, no doubt.

00:29:54.861 --> 00:29:57.481
But you must have gravity.

00:29:57.481 --> 00:30:03.561
If you don't have gravity how can you be attracted?

00:30:03.561 --> 00:30:12.281
The seriousness about it is only this - that
you should introspect, seriously.

00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:15.271
Find out what's wrong with you.

00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:20.021
Because this is a great chance for you to
ascend.

00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:30.121
With this kind of a mind, which becomes fanatic
in Sahaja Yoga, starts saying harsh things

00:30:30.121 --> 00:30:44.291
to other and disturbing the peace of others
because they think they are very great Sahaja

00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:45.611
Yogis.

00:30:45.611 --> 00:30:53.341
Then I think one should introspect and find
out why am I doing it?

00:30:53.341 --> 00:30:58.691
So many people have the same defects but for
that they'll scold others.

00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:02.331
Perhaps maybe they think by correcting another
person they might be corrected.

00:31:02.331 --> 00:31:06.271
I don't know what is the idea of their procedure
is?

00:31:06.271 --> 00:31:16.711
But it is very absurd sometimes; the way people
look at their, look at their problems as if

00:31:16.711 --> 00:31:18.421
these are the problems of others.

00:31:18.421 --> 00:31:25.321
Now, if I am saying this to you somebody must
be counting - "Ah I know this one Mother is

00:31:25.321 --> 00:31:27.281
saying about that one".

00:31:27.281 --> 00:31:34.861
Never will say that it's for me and I have
to see myself and introspect and find out

00:31:34.861 --> 00:31:41.181
what is dragging me down.

00:31:41.181 --> 00:31:48.141
So this is one of the most important things
is that you cannot be harsh, you cannot hurt

00:31:48.141 --> 00:31:55.241
people, you cannot misbehave in that manner,
and if you can't do that then you are thrown

00:31:55.241 --> 00:32:00.821
out of Sahaja Yoga by yourself, nobody has
to throw you.

00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:06.571
You have to correct you, people have to like
you and you have to be one of them.

00:32:06.571 --> 00:32:12.921
If the collectivity is not there, your Kundalini
will never rise.

00:32:12.921 --> 00:32:19.291
Because She's rising, She's trying to give
you a second birth so that you become one

00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:20.941
with the whole.

00:32:20.941 --> 00:32:22.471
The drop becomes the ocean.

00:32:22.471 --> 00:32:24.961
That's Her job, She'll never rise.

00:32:24.961 --> 00:32:34.291
A person who thinks he's very exclusive, special
should not come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:44.431
This is another great hurdle in raising the
Kundalini when people think that they are

00:32:44.431 --> 00:32:47.211
something special.

00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:52.821
We have no priesthood.

00:32:52.821 --> 00:33:02.831
And leadership is also is a myth I think,
people whom I think are better off with their

00:33:02.831 --> 00:33:07.041
Kundalini I can communicate better.

00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:11.621
But sometimes they too behave in such a manner
that one is shocked.

00:33:11.621 --> 00:33:14.621
How could they behave like this?

00:33:14.621 --> 00:33:20.031
And these serpents you see just suddenly come
up and you see them.

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:26.011
You are shocked what are they doing, where
is their attention?

00:33:26.011 --> 00:33:32.891
What are they worried about?

00:33:32.891 --> 00:33:38.631
So such stupid ideas if they walk into your
mind tell them, shut up now I know myself

00:33:38.631 --> 00:33:40.281
very well.

00:33:40.281 --> 00:33:46.021
That's the best way to keep you out of it
all these nonsensical things that are working.

00:33:46.021 --> 00:33:51.461
First of all you must remember that you are
seekers of truth.

00:33:51.461 --> 00:34:00.231
Have been seeking truth for ages, for years
together and now, I would say for many lives

00:34:00.231 --> 00:34:02.480
and now you have found it.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:14.021
So grab it and hold it fast by understanding
that this is what you wanted you've got it

00:34:14.021 --> 00:34:15.940
now.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:23.082
The another big problem that comes in the
awakening of the Kundalini which I feel is

00:34:23.082 --> 00:34:30.801
very important to be told to you is that some
of you think that you are very close to Me.

00:34:30.801 --> 00:34:39.710
That you have a special right on Me.

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:44.370
You don't know your Mother is a Mahamaya,
be careful.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:48.090
I am telling you again and again.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:51.751
Never think that way.

00:34:51.751 --> 00:34:56.271
Nobody can be My favorite, I assure you, cannot
be.

00:34:56.271 --> 00:35:09.961
It is like a mercury if you put it on another
metal or something doesn't stick you know.

00:35:09.961 --> 00:35:14.420
My mind never sticks to anyone, never sticks.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.860
Now supposing somebody is in trouble, somebody
has written to Me, there's some problem, then

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.310
the thought comes in.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:34.061
But I don't stick to that, I don't stick to
anyone nor do I have any attachment to anyone

00:35:34.061 --> 00:35:38.781
because that will be against the principle
of pure love.

00:35:38.781 --> 00:35:44.541
I cannot be attached, of course I see your
problems very intimately.

00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:54.681
I would love to solve them, I get worried
sometimes, you can call it worried, but the

00:35:54.681 --> 00:36:02.221
thought - attention is going towards that
person.

00:36:02.221 --> 00:36:14.670
You've seen when there's a tide, the Moon
when it is full Moon the tide is much bigger.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:25.511
Does the ocean think what about the Moon?

00:36:25.511 --> 00:36:34.531
Does he think that it has to attract the particular
ocean or someone?

00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:41.140
It's just the nature - the swabhava, the nature
itself that acts.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:53.320
That's the nature, you can't help it and this
nature is the one you should also try to adopt

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.461
and adore because it's very helpful.

00:36:58.461 --> 00:37:06.001
This gives you a great relief from your mind,
which is always thinking, thinking, thinking

00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:11.560
and doesn't allow you to have thoughtless
awareness.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:19.390
Get attached to someone, you are worried about
some problems, even your problems sometimes,

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:20.390
all the time your problem.

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:27.670
Thinking about your problem or about somebody
whom you are attached to.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:29.401
Then this mind starts working.

00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:34.251
How to solve the problem, what to do, this
and that?

00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:41.090
But then you stop your Agnya completely, how
will the Kundalini rise?

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:49.650
In any walk of life for a Sahaja Yogi, it
is the best way to stop thinking is to think

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.121
how he's going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:53.121 --> 00:37:57.150
Just divert your attention.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:38:04.491
This is the greatest pleasure for you, for
which you don't have to pay or anything; just

00:38:04.491 --> 00:38:07.341
know what powers you have got.

00:38:07.341 --> 00:38:16.100
At this point I find many people are not at
all aware of their powers and not using them.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:21.120
When you don't use your powers also Kundalini
falls down.

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.981
Why should She work?

00:38:23.981 --> 00:38:35.570
She's not stupid; if you don't want to use
Her for what She has to achieve then why should

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:37.751
She worry about you?

00:38:37.751 --> 00:38:41.831
So She just drops down, She has nothing to
do with you.

00:38:41.831 --> 00:38:45.881
Then suddenly you come out, "Mother I got
this trouble, I've got that trouble, this

00:38:45.881 --> 00:38:47.301
happened".

00:38:47.301 --> 00:38:57.511
Especially troubles like arthritis and all
such troubles come from people who don't use

00:38:57.511 --> 00:38:59.420
their vibrations.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:07.961
Give it to the flowers, give it to the trees,
give it to anything that is living but don't

00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:10.531
shirk it.

00:39:10.531 --> 00:39:17.481
You need not touch the person but the desire
should be 'whom should I give vibrations?'

00:39:17.481 --> 00:39:24.880
Only worry should be 'whom should I put attention
to?

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:29.070
Where should I put this energy of mine?'

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:34.801
Once you start using, this Divine Power it
starts flowing much more, much more and your

00:39:34.801 --> 00:39:41.211
Mother - the Kundalini is very happy.

00:39:41.211 --> 00:39:45.701
And then you start seeing wonders what's happening.

00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:56.920
For that you have to have first of all attention
on compassion and love; but compassion and

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:02.150
love of God - God Almighty.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:09.170
But when I talk of compassion I find people
are more interested in the people who are,

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:15.961
Sahaja Yogis who are suffering, who have problems,
who are thrown away from Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:15.961 --> 00:40:20.820
They will write to Me, "Mother please, please
some or other take them back".

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.481
That's My job not yours.

00:40:22.481 --> 00:40:33.910
But those who don't love God, they are not
going to achieve much.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:42.741
They have loose tongues, they talk funnily,
they don't understand they are dealing with

00:40:42.741 --> 00:40:53.251
God Almighty and this kind of frivolous talking
and frivolous behavior; you must understand

00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:59.771
that angels are around you all the time, all
the time they are with you.

00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:00.801
They watch you.

00:41:00.801 --> 00:41:12.170
They will help you, they'll support you, they'll
elevate you, they'll cross all kinds of hurdles

00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:25.711
but you have to love God from all your heart
and all your soul.

00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:41.481
You can't say things, which are not full of
protocol.

00:41:41.481 --> 00:41:48.201
All this is only possible when you surrender
your ego.

00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:54.160
God doesn't want anything from you.

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.501
What can you give to God?

00:41:55.501 --> 00:41:58.231
It's a funny idea people have.

00:41:58.231 --> 00:42:02.910
But its all right you can give anything to
God.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:10.681
Krishna has said that you can give Me flowers,
you can give Me water, you can give Me this

00:42:10.681 --> 00:42:17.560
presents, this / that, I'll accept.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.341
But what does He say?

00:42:21.341 --> 00:42:34.551
That only thing that you have to do is to
be one with Me.

00:42:34.551 --> 00:42:41.031
You have to be one with Me, you have to connect,
be connected with Me.

00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:50.491
And this feeling of connection is so satisfying,
is so joy giving, so nice, which cannot be

00:42:50.491 --> 00:42:54.031
described in words.

00:42:54.031 --> 00:43:08.231
Thus you find your Kundalini is just flowing
out with joy for yourself and for others.

00:43:08.231 --> 00:43:21.981
Also the right side - ambitiousness, domination,
showing off, harshness, cruelties.

00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:25.640
I don't know how many things there are on
the right side.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.821
But they can be unlimited.

00:43:27.821 --> 00:43:31.301
I mean the limit is Hitler you can say, so
far.

00:43:31.301 --> 00:43:38.550
God knows some other may come to compete with
him, but so far he's the last word.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:49.181
So all these also start destroying this Kundalini.

00:43:49.181 --> 00:44:03.110
I've seen also Kundalini of people which is
hurt, wounded, just can't rise, finished.

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:10.890
Then I feel that let them take a second birth;
only then one can work it out because is impossible

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:16.351
for such a Kundalini to make Her rise.

00:44:16.351 --> 00:44:28.130
If you are selfish and you are cruel then
this Kundalini becomes hurt.

00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:33.201
A good mother feels hurt when her child misbehaves.

00:44:33.201 --> 00:44:41.350
So this Kundalini gets very hurt because She
wants you to have your second birth and She

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:47.621
cant just bear it and this makes Her absolutely
incapable of rising.

00:44:47.621 --> 00:44:55.100
She becomes sick, ill and wounded.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:45:00.070
So all kinds of aggressiveness should be given
up.

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:07.070
That's not going to help because you have
come to Sahaja Yoga not for saving money or

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:08.531
bargaining or anything.

00:45:08.531 --> 00:45:13.451
You have come here because you are seekers.

00:45:13.451 --> 00:45:20.380
I've seen invariably people who have been
to false gurus always have this kind of a

00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:24.420
money orientation because they must have been
lynched completely by the previous gurus,

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:28.441
maybe, I don't know what to say.

00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:39.150
So it is we who can rise through our own goodness
and beauty.

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:49.761
And it is we who can come up to a level of
great Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:49.761 --> 00:45:51.681
Don't keep this power with yourself.

00:45:51.681 --> 00:46:00.910
It is to be distributed and given to others
and make others also very happy and joyous.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:05.271
Is a duty of every Sahaja Yogi to do it.

00:46:05.271 --> 00:46:14.170
Also thinking about Sahaja Yoga, not about
yourself is the best way to avoid many problems.

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:18.741
But once they start thinking about Sahaja
Yoga, they start thinking about the defects

00:46:18.741 --> 00:46:25.390
of Sahaja Yogis; that's not going to help.

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:31.451
You have to develop that peace of mind within
yourself by which you can become the witness

00:46:31.451 --> 00:46:35.251
of yourself first.

00:46:35.251 --> 00:46:39.501
You should be able to witness yourself and
see what are the things, which are putting

00:46:39.501 --> 00:46:40.861
you down.

00:46:40.861 --> 00:46:47.130
Because today the world is absolutely chaotic,
from this chaotic world you have to rise into

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:54.380
a very peaceful, beautiful world and you have
to take many to that.

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:56.880
For that you have to have the quality.

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:05.150
It's not just you become Sahaja Yogis, put
My badge here and all that.

00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:09.400
In every way you can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:15.130
But be careful because one should not feel
that you've done a great job.

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:24.871
Whatever you are doing is for your own good
not for others.

00:47:24.871 --> 00:47:36.231
Now we have to see what a great thing that
has happened because Kundalini was a big mystery

00:47:36.231 --> 00:47:37.231
before.

00:47:37.231 --> 00:47:42.441
But now it is not anymore, it's all open.

00:47:42.441 --> 00:47:46.931
You all know about it.

00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:53.431
You know about its powers, you know how you
can achieve your highest goal.

00:47:53.431 --> 00:48:03.551
So just to balance, just to lead a mediocre
life is not the way a real true seeker of

00:48:03.551 --> 00:48:04.630
truth should do.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:10.281
But if you are the real seeker of truth, then
you should see what's wrong with what I've

00:48:10.281 --> 00:48:15.681
been doing, whatever I've been following and
what I have to achieve.

00:48:15.681 --> 00:48:21.320
All the scriptures have said that you have
to be the Spirit.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:26.181
All the scriptures had said that you have
to be born again, I am not saying that anymore.

00:48:26.181 --> 00:48:35.040
Only thing what I am doing it what they have
said I am trying to do it and requesting that

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.040
you should do.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:43.080
Sahaja Yoga is not going to be like other
religions where people abuse children, do

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:48.140
what they like, make money, this/ that, all
nonsense - like a mafia.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:57.920
You are people who are chosen and are special
people who believe in a good moral life and

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.531
a peaceful life.

00:48:59.531 --> 00:49:01.691
May God bless you.
