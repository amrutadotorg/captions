03:46.193 --> 03:56.609
Today we have all been waiting to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.

03:59.660 --> 04:07.002
There's so much significant that we are
in a place here,

04:07.975 --> 04:18.824
the same type of a hut Jesus had when He
was born,

04:19.433 --> 04:22.488
and the wind was blowing from all sides

04:22.689 --> 04:31.048
and it was difficult to keep the room very
warm,

04:31.249 --> 04:39.229
though if it is correct He was not born
in the month of December,

04:39.430 --> 04:46.464
in a warmer month, not so very cold, maybe
this much as you see;

04:46.665 --> 04:54.384
so maybe that the climate of today is quite
significant, with the climate

04:55.123 --> 04:58.757
that He must have felt.

05:00.393 --> 05:04.129
As for you people, you don't feel any
discomfort in this climate,

05:04.330 --> 05:10.337
nor in these surroundings nor in the Spartan
living.

05:10.617 --> 05:15.467
He never felt any discomfort, nor
His Mother.

05:16.648 --> 05:20.680
When our attention is on our Spirit,

05:20.881 --> 05:33.422
then we do not feel the discomfort of nature
or of worldly things.

05:33.623 --> 05:41.724
This is the first sign when a Sahaja Yogi
starts

05:43.394 --> 05:47.807
complaining about comforts,

05:48.008 --> 05:53.879
then the first sign is that he is not
a Sahaja Yogi as yet.

05:54.080 --> 06:04.846
To begin with you just get absolutely
acclimatized with the climate and enjoy

06:07.799 --> 06:15.050
the style, the speed, the way it is molding
you.

06:15.251 --> 06:22.682
There's no friction between the nature and
the body because the Spirit

06:22.883 --> 06:29.545
which is synchronizer, helps you to become
one

06:29.746 --> 06:34.750
with this nature and enjoy the best part
of it.

06:34.951 --> 06:39.340
The way you are enjoying it shows that you
are great Sahaja Yogis,

06:39.541 --> 06:41.731
and that goes to My credit, I think,

06:41.932 --> 06:49.791
that you people have accepted all
the discomfort as enjoyments.

06:51.917 --> 06:55.890
Christ coming was a great event as I have
told you

06:56.091 --> 07:04.963
to establish Agnya Chakra. And He was born
on this Earth

07:05.164 --> 07:09.654
but much before He was born
in the consciousness

07:09.855 --> 07:18.667
and that absolute consciousness itself took
birth as Jesus Christ.

07:18.921 --> 07:23.573
To explain His life is only possible if you
are Realized souls,

07:23.774 --> 07:29.571
otherwise you cannot explain Christ - what
He was, how He worked -

07:29.772 --> 07:36.175
still it's very difficult to explain many
things in Sahaja Yoga as you know,

07:36.376 --> 07:42.147
you just go on seeing things. Today you
saw fountains

07:42.348 --> 07:45.940
coming out of the lake, which nobody can
explain,

07:46.141 --> 07:50.602
even the engineer said that they can't
explain, nobody can explain it.

07:50.803 --> 07:56.342
It just happens that the water gets
excited, feels the Divinity

07:56.543 --> 08:02.041
and starts pouring out its love in a bubbly
manner.

08:02.242 --> 08:05.646
Can you imagine that even the water can
feel it?

08:05.847 --> 08:12.481
You have seen how the light can feel it,
in the same way every element can feel it.

08:12.682 --> 08:16.758
All those elements are within us,
the highest of all,

08:16.959 --> 08:23.125
as we say, is the light,

08:24.097 --> 08:31.038
because light has an effect and that is
governed by Jesus Christ.

08:31.239 --> 08:38.830
Light has an effect, light shows things
that are correct.

08:39.031 --> 08:47.106
That's the one which makes us understand
all the dimensions of worldly things

08:47.307 --> 08:55.749
and ultimately when this light comes from
the Spirit and is enlightened by the Spirit,

08:55.950 --> 09:02.478
then you start seeing the other dimensions
also which sometimes make you laugh,

09:02.679 --> 09:08.995
sometimes make you smile and sometimes
make you cry also.

09:09.549 --> 09:16.054
Such a beautiful new dimension you have
achieved through Sahaja Yoga,

09:16.255 --> 09:20.930
but it was all built in within you and you
had to achieve it.

09:21.131 --> 09:26.185
People on the other side had to work very
hard,

09:26.386 --> 09:33.330
like Jesus Christ was born in a small manger
to show

09:33.531 --> 09:38.000
that Divinity need not be born in royal
families,

09:38.201 --> 09:42.130
can be born in a manger,

09:42.351 --> 09:46.754
can be born anywhere, makes no difference
to the Divinity.

09:46.955 --> 09:55.166
But that has given some funny ideas
to people, that they are saying

09:55.367 --> 10:02.395
we should make ourselves miserable

10:02.596 --> 10:09.403
and we should give away everything to God.
God doesn't want anything.

10:09.604 --> 10:14.190
He cannot have anything, and you cannot
give anything.

10:14.391 --> 10:18.991
Is a wrong idea that you become like
a pauper and give everything to God.

10:19.192 --> 10:27.617
He doesn't want that. What He wants that
you have to be happy, joyous and enjoying.

10:27.818 --> 10:29.830
That's the main point.

10:30.031 --> 10:35.760
Also if you give a little bit, very little
bit to God,

10:35.961 --> 10:38.763
then He gives you hundred times more.

10:38.964 --> 10:42.927
That's why you have to give a very wee bit
to God.

10:43.128 --> 10:46.580
But you don't have to hang yourself
by the trees

10:46.781 --> 10:50.609
to prove that you want to sacrifice.

10:50.810 --> 10:54.950
Christ has done everything for you. That's
the beauty of His life is

10:55.151 --> 11:00.734
that from the very beginning of His birth
He has shown that He has enjoyed

11:00.935 --> 11:08.464
no material well-being, as we call it.

11:08.665 --> 11:17.858
He has not enjoyed any worldly things as we
know of

11:20.072 --> 11:24.945
but that just means that He has done that
for us to see

11:25.146 --> 11:30.630
that there is no need for us to hanker
after worldly things -

11:30.831 --> 11:35.151
they will hanker after us. You don't have
to worry about these things.

11:35.318 --> 11:39.947
What you have to worry is the Spirit,
the main thing.

11:41.219 --> 11:49.075
All His life, which was very short I should
say, He has been trying,

11:49.276 --> 11:56.856
He was very much interested in evaluating
people

11:57.419 --> 12:01.320
because He didn't know what sort of things
these human beings are.

12:01.521 --> 12:08.893
He was a foreigner for these human beings.
So He tried to evaluate

12:09.094 --> 12:12.324
and in that evaluation

12:12.911 --> 12:20.412
He said many things which are very
remarkable, and one has to understand.

12:21.880 --> 12:27.182
One of the things He said that don't throw
your pearls before people

12:27.383 --> 12:34.380
who do not want to understand you. For
Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

12:34.581 --> 12:39.727
that you should not talk about Sahaja Yoga
to people who are anti-God.

12:39.928 --> 12:42.795
Now he may be your brother, may be your
sister, may be your father,

12:42.996 --> 12:48.236
may be anyone, there is no need to convince
them about Sahaja Yoga

12:48.550 --> 12:52.763
because they are not your relations.

12:53.591 --> 12:56.413
Many people have only this worry how
to convince my husband

12:56.614 --> 13:03.368
or how to convince my brother, there is
no need at all for you to work it out,

13:05.912 --> 13:09.881
just give them up on this point.

13:10.487 --> 13:15.050
The another thing He has told us which is
very important, I think,

13:15.242 --> 13:18.582
that we must forgive.

13:19.099 --> 13:23.946
He has given the greatest weapon that we
must forgive.

13:24.306 --> 13:28.039
Now it's such a practical thing to forgive.

13:28.240 --> 13:32.600
If you just forgive, the person doesn't
exist anymore

13:32.801 --> 13:38.236
and the person doesn't trouble you anymore,
nor is he in your attention,

13:38.437 --> 13:44.778
just to forgive is a simplest thing to do
and the highest thing to do

13:44.952 --> 13:53.946
to get relief from worldly or mental
tortures that we get.

13:55.410 --> 14:03.992
His life has been a story of spirituality,

14:04.193 --> 14:09.622
going through all kinds of turmoils and
tortures,

14:09.823 --> 14:14.866
all types of troubles that the Spirit can
go through,

14:15.035 --> 14:21.200
to show that nobody can kill that Spirit,

14:21.401 --> 14:27.609
as itâ€™s said in the Gita: "Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

14:27.810 --> 14:31.781
na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati
marutah".

14:31.982 --> 14:34.641
It cannot be killed, it's an eternal life

14:34.842 --> 14:38.146
and He tried to prove through His life
the eternity,

14:38.347 --> 14:44.579
from the beginning to the end He showed
that Spirit is above matter,

14:44.780 --> 14:48.943
that nothing can dominate Spirit.

14:49.144 --> 14:53.248
It's a very big thing He has done for us is
to create

14:53.449 --> 15:02.234
such a big confidence in our Spirit.

15:02.911 --> 15:05.689
He has proved it beyond doubt.

15:05.890 --> 15:11.002
I hope you people will understand and will
not bother Me or bother yourself

15:11.203 --> 15:16.709
with small petty things here and there,
is nothing important.

15:17.529 --> 15:27.544
Ask for bigger things, eternal things,
valuable things.

15:29.618 --> 15:32.142
Also I am very happy that you like this
place

15:32.343 --> 15:34.289
and you are enjoying yourself here very
much

15:34.490 --> 15:37.241
and today we have declared so many
marriages.

15:37.442 --> 15:40.352
There have been so many events in this
short time.

15:40.553 --> 15:44.428
So I would like to bless you all for this
Christmas Eve

15:44.629 --> 15:48.006
and I wish you all very happy Christmas and
Happy New Year.
