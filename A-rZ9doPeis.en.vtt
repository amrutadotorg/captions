00:00:07.227 --> 00:00:12.551
Today is a great day for all of us,

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:16.503
because it is the sixteenth Sahasrara Day.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:21.177
That in sixteen beats

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:26.816
or sixteen movements

00:00:26.943 --> 00:00:32.150
you reach a higher position in the coil.

00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:34.803
That it is complete,

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:43.416
that Shri Krishna is called as a complete incarnation

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:51.672
because He has sixteen petals.

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:57.396
This completeness is called as "purna."

00:00:57.588 --> 00:01:03.167
So, now we move into another dimension.

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:13.418
The first one was where you got your Self-realization.

00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:17.245
In the evolutionary process,

00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:24.341
if you see, the animals are not conscious

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:28.532
of many things which human beings are conscious of.

00:01:28.824 --> 00:01:36.470
Like the matter cannot be used by animals

00:01:36.777 --> 00:01:39.443
for their own purpose.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.111
Also they are not conscious of themselves at all.

00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:46.511
If you show a mirror to animals

00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:52.857
they do not react to it as if they are in the mirror,

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.204
except for, I think, chimpanzees.

00:01:57.311 --> 00:02:01.001
That means that we are rather close to them!

00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:05.173
So, when we have become human beings,

00:02:05.254 --> 00:02:09.894
we became aware in our consciousness

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.708
of many things which were unconscious to the animals.

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:20.149
So, in their brain they did not understand

00:02:20.268 --> 00:02:24.881
that they could put matter into their own use.

00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:29.641
As human beings you were all unaware

00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:34.573
of the chakras that existed within you.

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:38.373
So your consciousness still was working

00:02:38.573 --> 00:02:42.133
halfway through unconscious

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:49.936
working of the chakras and the conscious working of the mind.

00:02:50.016 --> 00:02:54.017
You also never felt your autonomous nervous system

00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:59.529
or your inner organs, how they're working.

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.792
You did not even feel how

00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:07.857
you are getting affected by other influences.

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:11.117
In human awareness you had achieved

00:03:11.198 --> 00:03:16.398
how to relate yourself to others and to the nature.

00:03:16.478 --> 00:03:19.357
But this ego-oriented approach

00:03:19.438 --> 00:03:26.080
took you away from natural, real life.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.756
And we became artificial.

00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:36.722
The whole thing comes from a concept of being artificial.

00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:43.962
Like they say that it's fashionable to be arrogant, to be snobbish.

00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:48.074
This is just the opposite of your ascent

00:03:48.162 --> 00:03:56.762
and evolutionary process because you have lost the power to relate to others,

00:03:56.842 --> 00:03:59.726
which you had gained as human beings.

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:02.714
All the organizations which you have formed

00:04:02.813 --> 00:04:08.957
also on collective understanding are also artificial.

00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:13.454
Then a movement started that we have to be natural.

00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:18.796
That is another copying of the artificial.

00:04:18.877 --> 00:04:22.628
Natural does not mean a primitive personality.

00:04:22.794 --> 00:04:25.522
Natural is to evolve.

00:04:25.603 --> 00:04:29.787
The whole purpose of creation is to evolve.

00:04:29.867 --> 00:04:36.587
So, when I started My life,

00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:41.774
I saw the complicated Sahasraras.

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:47.603
And the more I tried to solve the complications

00:04:47.683 --> 00:04:52.923
within My own awareness,

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:59.889
the more it became more difficult.

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:07.581
Because if you see My age, in fifty years

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:13.411
you can see how much complicated human beings have become.

00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:18.251
And after opening the Sahasrara, when I come to the West,

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.611
within these sixteen years

00:05:20.817 --> 00:05:26.269
I found that they are now incorrigible.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:33.426
Now the stage for you is laid down
to ascend higher.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.262
This is the background which I have described to you.

00:05:39.415 --> 00:05:45.805
But in Sahaja Yoga you have got
your realization in one lifetime.

00:05:45.886 --> 00:05:48.355
And in this lifetime you have to grow.

00:05:48.436 --> 00:05:52.003
And in this lifetime you have to achieve the highest.

00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:54.569
So the time is so very short!

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.072
And the background is so dark.

00:05:57.152 --> 00:06:00.432
You are surrounded by people who are pouring out

00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:03.941
morning till evening destructive concepts.

00:06:04.021 --> 00:06:08.907
Now, you are the people who have to shoot out

00:06:08.988 --> 00:06:11.268
much faster than all of them.

00:06:11.348 --> 00:06:15.787
But a kind of a lethargy, though you understand

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:21.219
that your awareness is very different from them,

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.131
a kind of a lethargy, which does not accept it

00:06:26.211 --> 00:06:28.781
the way it should accept Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:33.553
Every one of you must think every day:

00:06:33.634 --> 00:06:36.992
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

00:06:37.073 --> 00:06:40.436
But you are all still very busy with your jobs,

00:06:40.517 --> 00:06:46.311
of making money, of have relations with people
who do not matter at all in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:50.911
We have to make an all out effort

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.417
to rise to that point, that whatever we know,
we believe in,

00:06:56.497 --> 00:06:59.744
we act on that and become one with it.

00:06:59.824 --> 00:07:03.303
You can do that with concepts, but not with reality,

00:07:03.384 --> 00:07:06.013
this is the problem.

00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:12.463
I see in My own country when they were fighting for freedom,

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:16.382
My father himself gave up all his property,

00:07:16.463 --> 00:07:22.623
gave up his practice, with eleven children in the family.

00:07:22.823 --> 00:07:27.543
And we were living in palaces, started living in huts,

00:07:27.736 --> 00:07:30.920
for days together, for years together.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.919
But for the gross freedom we'll do anything,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.120
but for the subtler freedom

00:07:37.201 --> 00:07:40.558
the Sahaja Yogis have to do everything that is possible.

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:41.958
First is to be aware,

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:46.454
to be in your conscious mind all the time that you are yogis.

00:07:46.534 --> 00:07:50.974
You are the ones who are very much higher

00:07:51.174 --> 00:07:54.089
than the rest of the humanity.

00:07:54.169 --> 00:08:00.814
That the salvation of the whole of the humanity depends on you.

00:08:00.894 --> 00:08:05.469
The purpose of creation will be served by you.

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:08.147
So, first of all you have to be conscious

00:08:08.228 --> 00:08:12.588
in your consciousness that you are so important,

00:08:12.669 --> 00:08:15.461
and that's why you were given realization.

00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:19.006
How can you be living with your conditionings

00:08:19.087 --> 00:08:20.868
and with your ego?

00:08:20.948 --> 00:08:22.788
The conditionings are like this:

00:08:22.948 --> 00:08:25.788
Supposing you are coming from a Christian religion,

00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:28.107
then you must bring that

00:08:28.188 --> 00:08:31.187
little bit of that religion into Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:33.267
Or if you are from a Hindu religion,

00:08:33.348 --> 00:08:35.295
you want to bring some out of that.

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:39.347
We have all the essences of these in Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:39.428 --> 00:08:43.626
the pure essences; but we can't have the gross nonsense.

00:08:43.706 --> 00:08:51.026
All these things are like dirt over

00:08:51.226 --> 00:08:55.083
our Sahasrara which must be shaken off.

00:08:55.163 --> 00:08:57.602
Though now you are aware,

00:08:57.683 --> 00:09:02.682
you are aware and conscious of your chakras,

00:09:02.763 --> 00:09:05.806
you do not keep them clean.

00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:08.325
Ordinary human beings if they have clothes,

00:09:08.406 --> 00:09:11.584
they have houses, they try to keep it clean.

00:09:11.664 --> 00:09:13.863
But you do not feel ashamed

00:09:13.944 --> 00:09:17.104
of them also when they are bad,

00:09:17.304 --> 00:09:19.904
because after some time

00:09:20.104 --> 00:09:22.504
you also lose the awareness of them.

00:09:22.584 --> 00:09:26.040
That means you have become subtler,

00:09:26.184 --> 00:09:31.296
but in your consciousness you are not yet subtle.

00:09:31.376 --> 00:09:36.176
There are so many things you know more

00:09:36.257 --> 00:09:41.535
than the people who are not realized,

00:09:41.616 --> 00:09:45.743
as absolute reality.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:51.487
For example: We don't even use vibrations.

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:54.664
Whenever it is needed, we don't use it.

00:09:54.777 --> 00:09:58.956
Or sometimes mechanically, just like a machine,

00:09:59.037 --> 00:10:01.064
we start giving bandhans.

00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:05.746
So you are still unconscious about your chakras.

00:10:05.826 --> 00:10:08.865
Slightly conscious when you put your mind to it,

00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:11.526
otherwise, in your central nervous system

00:10:11.626 --> 00:10:14.184
you are not yet so conscious.

00:10:14.264 --> 00:10:18.584
This is the reason, why you do not know

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:26.389
why you had to do a thing at a particular time.

00:10:26.508 --> 00:10:31.716
Unless and until you rise to this Nirvikalpa state,

00:10:31.802 --> 00:10:34.159
you cannot go further.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.886
For example, I know everything what I do.

00:10:37.966 --> 00:10:42.489
I can handle any power whenever I want to.

00:10:42.569 --> 00:10:46.301
I can absorb any negativity I want to,

00:10:46.409 --> 00:10:49.962
I need not absorb any negativity I don't want to.

00:10:50.042 --> 00:10:52.921
You may be thousands of miles away from Me,

00:10:53.002 --> 00:10:55.674
I know about everyone of you.

00:10:55.754 --> 00:10:59.233
I may not know your worldly names,

00:10:59.314 --> 00:11:03.384
but I know you as a part and parcel in My Being.

00:11:03.464 --> 00:11:08.632
I also can behave like a human being,

00:11:08.712 --> 00:11:11.704
absolutely like you, aging like you,

00:11:11.785 --> 00:11:14.646
even using spectacles,

00:11:14.726 --> 00:11:20.778
doing all the things that will make Me a complete human being.

00:11:20.858 --> 00:11:24.805
I have accepted this role consciously,

00:11:24.885 --> 00:11:26.304
not unconsciously.

00:11:26.384 --> 00:11:28.220
To Me, nothing is unconscious.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.820
So if you have to be conscious of what you are doing,

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.681
you have to be alert about it.

00:11:37.761 --> 00:11:42.361
The first thing that you have achieved is the peace,

00:11:42.521 --> 00:11:43.624
the peace.

00:11:43.705 --> 00:11:47.243
But even now I find that peace

00:11:47.324 --> 00:11:51.901
which would become joy becomes the quarrel.

00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:55.822
Truth is one, you cannot argue about truth.

00:11:55.902 --> 00:11:58.036
It is a homogeneous thing.

00:11:58.116 --> 00:12:01.949
It doesn't quarrel with each other.

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:05.659
We are unconscious about our fingers,

00:12:05.739 --> 00:12:07.720
but when we have to hold something,

00:12:07.801 --> 00:12:10.680
all of them come together and work it out.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.588
So the part of the brain, which is working this out,

00:12:15.707 --> 00:12:20.747
the unconscious part of it, is to be made conscious.

00:12:20.828 --> 00:12:24.088
That is what evolution is.

00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:34.720
So now adherence to any concept is against evolution.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.628
You must learn to face the reality,

00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:44.640
to accept the reality and act a real way.

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:47.994
Now you may say, "Mother, this is a miracle."

00:12:48.074 --> 00:12:50.299
Something happens, "this is a miracle."

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:53.338
Maybe for the human beings,

00:12:53.425 --> 00:12:55.676
maybe for Sahaja Yogis also,

00:12:55.756 --> 00:12:57.022
but not for Me

00:12:57.102 --> 00:12:59.028
'cause I know what it is.

00:12:59.108 --> 00:13:06.946
So to rise above this half-baked consciousness,

00:13:07.026 --> 00:13:14.739
one has to see how you are working it out.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.260
The whole system of relating to

00:13:19.379 --> 00:13:23.279
each other must change completely.

00:13:25.525 --> 00:13:28.904
That is very important, at least for western people.

00:13:28.984 --> 00:13:32.236
Because at least in India people know

00:13:32.316 --> 00:13:35.235
that human efforts lead you nowhere,

00:13:35.316 --> 00:13:38.355
you have to take to your ascent -

00:13:38.436 --> 00:13:40.693
I mean the real Indians.

00:13:40.774 --> 00:13:44.199
Some of them do take advantage of Sahaja Yoga

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:47.545
and then disappear, some of them do.

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:51.864
But mostly they know that you have to be

00:13:51.945 --> 00:13:57.543
conscious of what you have got.

00:13:57.624 --> 00:14:03.191
So, we can say that we have got self-knowledge,

00:14:03.272 --> 00:14:08.010
but we haven't got self-consciousness.

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:11.005
Now, for example, you take somebody's name,

00:14:11.086 --> 00:14:14.213
say of some great saint.

00:14:14.293 --> 00:14:17.893
You feel the vibrations are flowing.

00:14:18.093 --> 00:14:23.314
Also you know why - because he is a saint.

00:14:23.433 --> 00:14:26.060
But why not you the Sahaja Yogis?

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.568
If your names are taken, why not the vibrations flow?

00:14:30.648 --> 00:14:35.017
And in this you have greater advantages

00:14:35.097 --> 00:14:37.943
because the Adi Shakti, Herself, is before you.

00:14:38.024 --> 00:14:41.069
They didn't have anybody to tell them all these things.

00:14:41.149 --> 00:14:47.251
But the disadvantage of that is this: that you take it for granted.

00:14:47.331 --> 00:14:53.571
Now, in expression, when we say something,

00:14:53.731 --> 00:14:56.831
when we express; are we natural,

00:14:56.911 --> 00:15:00.085
are we it doing from our heart?

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:05.270
The consciousness that "I'm doing it from my heart,"

00:15:05.365 --> 00:15:08.267
is what I want you to achieve.

00:15:08.347 --> 00:15:12.226
Like there are people who work very hard in Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:12.307 --> 00:15:15.074
others will just take it for granted.

00:15:15.154 --> 00:15:17.240
They do not want to help.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.666
They want everything to be ready-made.

00:15:19.746 --> 00:15:22.225
That shows that they are not conscious

00:15:22.306 --> 00:15:25.800
of their own powers of enjoyment.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.439
If they do it from their heart,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:36.119
then they will never feel what effort they have put in,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.300
they will only feel what they have been blessed with

00:15:40.381 --> 00:15:42.104
or what they have achieved.

00:15:42.184 --> 00:15:47.093
The sense of fulfillment and satisfaction will overcome

00:15:47.184 --> 00:15:50.575
all your problems, specially your left Vishuddhis.

00:15:50.655 --> 00:15:53.174
Now the second stage would be

00:15:53.255 --> 00:15:59.152
where you will be conscious of whatever you are doing,

00:15:59.669 --> 00:16:02.080
where there will be no mistakes.

00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:03.791
Whatever you will do

00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:07.686
may appear to be a mistake, will turn out to be all right.

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:10.730
Nobody is so far like that, so I would like to tell you.

00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:14.769
Because some people do feel whatever I say of praising,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.242
they think I'm saying it to them.

00:16:17.322 --> 00:16:20.922
Just now the stage at which we are,

00:16:21.003 --> 00:16:24.373
we are still making lots of mistakes

00:16:24.454 --> 00:16:28.106
because we are not Self-conscious.

00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:30.591
In a gross way we understand

00:16:30.672 --> 00:16:32.512
this word self-consciousness like this:

00:16:32.593 --> 00:16:34.685
When a person has to go for an interview

00:16:34.766 --> 00:16:36.621
then, he selects his suit properly,

00:16:36.701 --> 00:16:38.980
he'll comb his hair properly before going,

00:16:39.061 --> 00:16:42.664
he'll clear his throat. Self-conscious.

00:16:42.744 --> 00:16:45.743
But when it is the question of your ascent,

00:16:45.824 --> 00:16:49.503
are we alert? Or we are taking it for granted

00:16:49.584 --> 00:16:52.863
that Mother is just now going to give us a nice bath,

00:16:52.944 --> 00:16:55.554
put us in the cradle and take us there.

00:16:55.634 --> 00:16:59.216
This is being childish!

00:16:59.342 --> 00:17:03.874
You have to mature in your ascent.

00:17:03.954 --> 00:17:06.337
Now you may say, "What should we do?"

00:17:06.423 --> 00:17:10.947
Face yourself every day!

00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:16.246
In reality, see how much time you spend about

00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:20.193
mundane worries and how much about your ascent.

00:17:20.274 --> 00:17:24.234
Have you left everything, all your worries

00:17:24.353 --> 00:17:26.902
to God Almighty?

00:17:26.982 --> 00:17:32.012
Have you completely jumped out of your background?

00:17:32.092 --> 00:17:39.529
Have you come out all the way, leaving everything that was nonsensical?

00:17:39.609 --> 00:17:43.529
And how do I relate to others?

00:17:43.649 --> 00:17:48.842
How do I talk to others who are Sahaja Yogis?

00:17:48.923 --> 00:17:55.747
So you should understand the time limit.

00:17:55.828 --> 00:17:58.570
You must understand your greatness

00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:03.691
and you must understand how you people

00:18:03.796 --> 00:18:10.975
are chosen for the highest work in this creation.

00:18:11.055 --> 00:18:13.459
So now there's no time for lethargy.

00:18:13.539 --> 00:18:19.035
Now you have to rise and awake.

00:18:19.855 --> 00:18:23.415
Today is the day when I hope

00:18:23.608 --> 00:18:26.864
you have to jump into Nirvikalpa.

00:18:26.944 --> 00:18:29.463
But only by effort you will stay there,

00:18:29.544 --> 00:18:31.954
otherwise you'll again slip down.

00:18:32.034 --> 00:18:34.839
So go through this lecture again and again,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.634
and do not think about it.

00:18:37.714 --> 00:18:42.799
Don't think that it is for somebody else, it is for you.

00:18:42.879 --> 00:18:44.533
For all of you,

00:18:44.613 --> 00:18:46.507
each of you,

00:18:46.587 --> 00:18:49.382
and you must know yourself

00:18:49.462 --> 00:18:53.366
how far you are going every day.

00:18:53.619 --> 00:18:59.068
You are not robots, you are not machines,

00:18:59.148 --> 00:19:04.806
you are evolved through evolutionary process.

00:19:04.886 --> 00:19:09.038
And through evolutionary process only

00:19:09.166 --> 00:19:12.733
you have to achieve the higher personality.

00:19:12.813 --> 00:19:18.412
So whatever we may do or whatever may be all right,

00:19:18.493 --> 00:19:24.367
it's you who have to show the results.

00:19:24.447 --> 00:19:32.207
We may take your Sahasrara

00:19:32.407 --> 00:19:36.744
to a great enlightenment but again it will collapse.

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:43.883
So you have to know that whatever heights

00:19:43.984 --> 00:19:49.504
you are brought to, it is you who have to maintain it

00:19:49.584 --> 00:19:53.744
with full will power and action.

00:19:55.829 --> 00:19:59.189
May God bless you!

00:20:01.389 --> 00:20:05.828
This lecture is a concern of your Mother.

00:20:05.909 --> 00:20:11.229
Do not take it as anything ill.

00:20:12.384 --> 00:20:15.416
I could not have said this even two years back

00:20:15.497 --> 00:20:19.503
or one year back, because you are at the stage

00:20:19.584 --> 00:20:22.944
where I can say these things to you.

00:20:23.024 --> 00:20:25.944
You can understand it, but

00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:29.088
it has to become your consciousness.

00:20:29.168 --> 00:20:32.928
The stage has reached to understand,

00:20:33.128 --> 00:20:36.208
but it should become your consciousness.

00:20:36.408 --> 00:20:41.123
By today's happening should become, if you keep it there.

00:20:43.351 --> 00:20:45.576
So, again, may God bless you!
