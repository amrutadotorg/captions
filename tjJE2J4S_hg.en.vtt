00:09.292 --> 00:14.918
But we must understand that,
once we have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:16.918 --> 00:19.417
once our Kundalini has been awakened,

00:20.083 --> 00:26.375
then, all of us have now become
part and parcel of one body,

00:28.375 --> 00:34.751
of one body of the great Primordial Being.

00:35.751 --> 00:40.042
In a body, as human bodies are,

00:40.292 --> 00:44.417
supposing a finger is numb,

00:45.918 --> 00:50.751
then all the body’s attention is
on that finger to cure it.

00:51.483 --> 00:58.292
And all the other fingers
and the whole body, the brain,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.083
the mind you can call it,

01:01.417 --> 01:04.213
everything is worried about that finger ,

01:04.334 --> 01:07.292
how to make it all right.

01:09.959 --> 01:15.292
Naturally there is no ego
for these fingers,

01:15.584 --> 01:19.209
so nobody feels hurt or bad.

01:21.685 --> 01:24.797
And the fingers are also anxious to do it,
because they can feel

01:24.918 --> 01:29.042
the problem of the finger which is numb.

01:31.083 --> 01:36.125
If there is some problem, say,
internally within your body,

01:36.667 --> 01:43.375
all the cells which are needed
to correct that problem will rush.

01:44.042 --> 01:45.918
The blood will rush. The heart will pump.

01:46.125 --> 01:49.751
Everything will work out
in a very co-coordinated way,

01:50.292 --> 01:52.667
but nobody feels hurt.

01:52.918 --> 01:56.000
that “Why should I take help from anyone?”.

01:57.375 --> 02:01.000
Neither the one who helps
is frightened or afraid

02:01.500 --> 02:03.792
or also feels the ego.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.125
The reason is, the cells of the body

02:08.334 --> 02:13.959
are under the complete control of one brain,

02:15.417 --> 02:19.584
or one personality, or one Self.

02:23.042 --> 02:28.667
But in Sahaja Yoga, this collectivity
is not yet established.

02:29.500 --> 02:36.042
That’s why people feel hurt, people hurt each other.

02:38.125 --> 02:43.834
They have fear

02:44.792 --> 02:49.250
of another ‘cell’, which is the brother ‘cell’,

02:49.834 --> 02:52.209
witch is the partner ‘cell’,

02:52.584 --> 02:55.500
which is the part and parcel of your own being.

02:55.834 --> 02:59.500
Are we afraid of our eyes? Or afraid of our nose?

02:59.751 --> 03:03.709
Are we afraid of our hands, or of our feet?

03:04.209 --> 03:09.125
And this collectivity is such a vicious circle

03:10.459 --> 03:15.209
that unless and until you become really collective,

03:15.626 --> 03:19.042
you cannot feel another person.

03:22.125 --> 03:25.250
And unless and until you have
that sense of responsibility

03:25.459 --> 03:27.918
of collectivity built in yourself,

03:28.042 --> 03:30.334
you cannot help another person.

03:31.459 --> 03:35.751
So certain amount of growth is needed in the whole body

03:36.042 --> 03:39.542
to be sensitive enough to help each other,

03:40.125 --> 03:42.959
to be wise enough to help each other,

03:43.584 --> 03:48.834
to be resourceful enough to really nourish another.

03:50.584 --> 03:53.375
And that development has to come again through collectivity;

03:53.584 --> 03:57.125
is most surprising.

03:58.292 --> 04:05.876
I know sometimes people feel
that there are Sahaja Yogis

04:08.500 --> 04:12.500
who are not even of one mind.

04:12.918 --> 04:14.484
I agree.

04:14.605 --> 04:17.125
That somebody will say,
“Your Vishuddhi is catching,”

04:17.246 --> 04:20.062
another will say, “Your heart is catching.”
Another will say,

04:20.183 --> 04:22.691
“Your void is catching.”

04:23.225 --> 04:25.834
They don’t say that all of them will say the same thing:

04:25.959 --> 04:28.584
one will say this, one will say that, one will say that.

04:28.792 --> 04:33.000
The reason is, some of them have developed

04:33.209 --> 04:36.751
certain sensitivity to a certain centre,

04:37.250 --> 04:40.083
but not to all the centres.

04:41.292 --> 04:43.209
And that’s how there can be

04:43.500 --> 04:48.500
a difference of opinion as there should not be at all.

04:49.500 --> 04:54.500
So firstly we must all know that we are still growing.

04:55.417 --> 04:56.834
We have to still grow.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.667
In Sahaja Yoga even if you get
your Realization, that doesn’t mean

05:00.834 --> 05:05.292
you have suddenly become John the Baptist.

05:06.751 --> 05:08.709
We all have to grow.

05:09.083 --> 05:14.834
And for growing and growth
we have to discard something

05:16.042 --> 05:19.375
and we have to accept something.
