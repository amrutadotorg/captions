00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:14.918
But we must understand that, 
once we have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:19.417
once our Kundalini has been awakened,

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:26.375
then, all of us have now become 
part and parcel of one body,

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:34.751
of one body of the great Primordial Being.

00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:40.042
In a body, as human bodies are,

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:44.417
supposing a finger is numb,

00:00:45.918 --> 00:00:50.751
then all the body’s attention is 
on that finger to cure it.

00:00:51.483 --> 00:00:58.292
And all the other fingers 
and the whole body, the brain,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.083
the mind you can call it,

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:04.213
everything is worried about that finger ,

00:01:04.334 --> 00:01:07.292
how to make it all right.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:15.292
Naturally there is no ego 
for these fingers,

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:19.209
so nobody feels hurt or bad.

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:24.797
And the fingers are also anxious to do it, 
because they can feel

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:29.042
the problem of the finger which is numb.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:36.125
If there is some problem, say, 
internally within your body,

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:43.375
all the cells which are needed 
to correct that problem will rush.

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:45.918
The blood will rush. The heart will pump.

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:49.751
Everything will work out 
in a very co-coordinated way,

00:01:50.292 --> 00:01:52.667
but nobody feels hurt.

00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:56.000
that “Why should I take help from anyone?”.

00:01:57.375 --> 00:02:01.000
Neither the one who helps 
is frightened or afraid

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.792
or also feels the ego.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.125
The reason is, the cells of the body

00:02:08.334 --> 00:02:13.959
are under the complete control of one brain,

00:02:15.417 --> 00:02:19.584
or one personality, or one Self.

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:28.667
But in Sahaja Yoga, this collectivity 
is not yet established.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.042
That’s why people feel hurt, people hurt each other.

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:43.834
They have fear

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:49.250
of another ‘cell’, which is the brother ‘cell’,

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:52.209
witch is the partner ‘cell’,

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:55.500
which is the part and parcel of your own being.

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:59.500
Are we afraid of our eyes? Or afraid of our nose?

00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:03.709
Are we afraid of our hands, or of our feet?

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.125
And this collectivity is such a vicious circle

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.209
that unless and until you become really collective,

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:19.042
you cannot feel another person.

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:25.250
And unless and until you have 
that sense of responsibility

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.918
of collectivity built in yourself,

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:30.334
you cannot help another person.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.751
So certain amount of growth is needed in the whole body

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:39.542
to be sensitive enough to help each other,

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.959
to be wise enough to help each other,

00:03:43.584 --> 00:03:48.834
to be resourceful enough to really nourish another.

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:53.375
And that development has to come again through collectivity;

00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:57.125
is most surprising.

00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:05.876
I know sometimes people feel 
that there are Sahaja Yogis

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.500
who are not even of one mind.

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:14.484
I agree.

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:17.125
That somebody will say, 
“Your Vishuddhi is catching,”

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:20.062
another will say, “Your heart is catching.” 
Another will say,

00:04:20.183 --> 00:04:22.691
“Your void is catching.”

00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:25.834
They don’t say that all of them will say the same thing:

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:28.584
one will say this, one will say that, one will say that.

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:33.000
The reason is, some of them have developed

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:36.751
certain sensitivity to a certain centre,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.083
but not to all the centres.

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:43.209
And that’s how there can be

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.500
a difference of opinion as there should not be at all.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.500
So firstly we must all know that we are still growing.

00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:56.834
We have to still grow.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.667
In Sahaja Yoga even if you get 
your Realization, that doesn’t mean

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:05.292
you have suddenly become John the Baptist.

00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:08.709
We all have to grow.

00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:14.834
And for growing and growth 
we have to discard something

00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:19.375
and we have to accept something.
