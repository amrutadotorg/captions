Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism”
3rd May 1987

00:12:43.977 --> 00:12:45.208
Thredbo, Australia

00:12:47.026 --> 00:12:53.786
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja
yogis.

00:12:58.139 --> 00:13:19.869
It was a long time back that I desired Sahasrara
should be opened out, but waiting for a right

00:13:19.869 --> 00:13:21.749
time.

00:13:21.749 --> 00:13:37.879
It was important to do it at the right time.

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:50.278
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me
a question, “Mother, this all-pervading

00:13:50.278 --> 00:14:05.299
Power of Brahmachaitanya is beyond senses,
you cannot feel it through senses.

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:13.368
How is it we are now feeling it through our
senses?”

00:14:13.368 --> 00:14:19.859
This is the question he asked, and I ask you
the same question.

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:35.399
Before this, those people who got realization
could not talk about it in the way you can

00:14:35.399 --> 00:14:40.139
tell people, that you can feel it on your
senses.

00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:49.689
They could not explain, they could not put
it into experience.

00:14:49.689 --> 00:15:07.538
Just what they did was to tell them in words,
words which were telling about something – like

00:15:07.538 --> 00:15:14.738
the taste of mango, unless and until you eat
the mango how will you know the taste?

00:15:14.738 --> 00:15:19.648
By just knowing about “it’s wonderful,
it’s great, it’s fantastic,” still you

00:15:19.648 --> 00:15:26.868
have not tasted the mango.

00:15:26.868 --> 00:15:32.969
So what has happened now, was the question.

00:15:32.969 --> 00:15:38.148
Another thing was that these people got so
fed up, like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one,

00:15:38.148 --> 00:15:41.539
he took a samadhi.

00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:50.219
He went into a room and closed the doors and
settled down there, and he died there.

00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:55.919
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

00:15:55.919 --> 00:16:07.329
Because they could tell a parable, they could
tell a simile, but what had happened to them

00:16:07.329 --> 00:16:20.410
that they could not explain, and they felt
so sad and so frustrated.

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:25.249
In a way they finished their life very early.

00:16:25.249 --> 00:16:36.809
This was the question.

00:16:36.809 --> 00:17:11.659
So what was the secret, can any one of you
tell Me?

00:17:11.659 --> 00:17:28.409
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult
to digest.

00:17:28.409 --> 00:17:42.709
The answer is that all these incarnations
who came on this Earth were part of the Sahasrara,

00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:54.388
were part of the Brahmachaitanya, were part
of the Adi Shakti.

00:17:54.388 --> 00:18:03.749
They came on this Earth, gave realization
to some people who were excellent, good people

00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:11.229
who had no problems; as if they came out of
the ocean of love and took all of them to

00:18:11.229 --> 00:18:15.999
the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

00:18:15.999 --> 00:18:21.649
As Kabira has said that “When a drop becomes
the ocean, what can I say?”

00:18:21.649 --> 00:18:29.399
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:32.649
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

00:18:32.649 --> 00:18:44.659
They disappeared, they got dissolved completely
into the ocean of love.

00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:53.149
But you did not get dissolved.

00:18:53.149 --> 00:19:05.568
Something special has happened to you, that
the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

00:19:05.568 --> 00:19:22.189
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s
Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

00:19:22.189 --> 00:19:44.198
to shower the chaitanya on you people, enrich
you, nurture you, develop you, by manifesting

00:19:44.198 --> 00:19:55.239
the love in such a manner that you have entered
into the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:19:55.239 --> 00:20:00.939
So like one pitcher which is in the River
Ganges, you are like a cell in the body of

00:20:00.939 --> 00:20:06.318
the Adi Shakti.

00:20:06.318 --> 00:20:10.019
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

00:20:10.019 --> 00:20:19.939
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya
through your senses and you can give realizations

00:20:19.939 --> 00:20:23.848
to others, but you are in the body of the
Adi Shakti.

00:20:23.848 --> 00:20:33.039
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti
you can do all that.

00:20:33.039 --> 00:20:36.478
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

00:20:36.478 --> 00:20:43.649
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened out
with all the seven peethas of all the deities,

00:20:43.649 --> 00:20:45.969
who are just part and parcel of it.

00:20:45.969 --> 00:20:58.059
The whole of it has come in the form of a
Mother who is humble, who is deceptive, illusive,

00:20:58.059 --> 00:21:02.299
who is Mahamaya.

00:21:02.299 --> 00:21:12.399
It’s the greatest thing that could happen
to human beings and to the whole universe,

00:21:12.399 --> 00:21:20.539
that now you can get your realization, you
can give realizations to others, you can understand

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:28.279
through your senses, through your logic what
is vibrations, what it does.

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:40.019
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers
were dead last night, finished with the heat

00:21:40.019 --> 00:21:41.969
of the people who were carrying them.

00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:49.089
And then I just put some vibrated water on
them, and you see how they are.

00:21:49.089 --> 00:21:58.139
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but their
personality is there, they are all vibrated,

00:21:58.139 --> 00:22:00.998
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

00:22:00.998 --> 00:22:11.659
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh
and beautiful, anybody can make out a Sahaja

00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:12.989
yogi.

00:22:12.989 --> 00:22:19.199
Under these circumstances one has to understand
that there are certain limitations which you

00:22:19.199 --> 00:22:20.419
have to observe.

00:22:20.419 --> 00:22:24.118
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

00:22:24.118 --> 00:22:36.238
A foreign thing has to go in the body and
it has to be looked after, nurtured.

00:22:36.238 --> 00:22:47.389
But if you become troublesome, then you’ll
be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

00:22:47.389 --> 00:22:51.969
Some people are extremely troublesome.

00:22:51.969 --> 00:23:01.849
They do not meditate, they have their own
ideas about meditation, they do not develop

00:23:01.849 --> 00:23:14.659
themselves, they do not mature, they live
in the past or in the future, and such people

00:23:14.659 --> 00:23:15.659
are troublesome.

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:23.169
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to
put some ghee in the nose, which is a very

00:23:23.169 --> 00:23:26.039
simple thing but is very important.

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:37.019
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa, and
one of the things that is a symptom in a AIDS

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:39.919
case is a bad Hamsa.

00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:53.779
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a small
thing like that is not observed.

00:23:53.779 --> 00:24:03.089
It has to be a religious obligation that you
must listen to Me, whatever I say.

00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:06.129
Actually you must obey Me.

00:24:06.129 --> 00:24:15.289
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet
obey Me; what about you, who are raised to

00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:32.169
the great dignity and the great position of
being the yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:46.389
and they are acting as cells in My body?

00:24:46.389 --> 00:24:55.229
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind
of a venture, to put all kinds of things in

00:24:55.229 --> 00:25:15.769
your body is a very daring thing, and the
process is also very hazardous.

00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:32.469
This has to be achieved with great patience,
love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

00:25:32.469 --> 00:25:42.358
This has to be regarded as the greatest thing,
that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

00:25:42.358 --> 00:25:51.599
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara, I
am the master of all the chakras, but also

00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:56.558
I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

00:25:56.558 --> 00:26:04.418
If that is the situation, you should be careful
about your Sahasrara – that is Me – and

00:26:04.418 --> 00:26:14.469
looking after your own heart which is the
Brahmarandra peetha here, which opens out

00:26:14.469 --> 00:26:18.168
ultimately when you get your realization.

00:26:18.168 --> 00:26:27.199
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere horizontally;
vertically it must also spread.

00:26:27.199 --> 00:26:35.449
And there, if you really have proper understanding
of what I am, Sahasrara should be absolutely

00:26:35.449 --> 00:26:36.858
clearcut.

00:26:36.858 --> 00:26:45.139
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you must listen
to whatever I have told you, obey it as absolutely

00:26:45.139 --> 00:26:54.688
a ordained thing.

00:26:54.688 --> 00:26:58.529
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your
heart.

00:26:58.529 --> 00:27:06.558
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill
it up with My love?

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:12.019
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

00:27:12.019 --> 00:27:18.759
Don’t get worried about what has happened
in the past, don’t get worried about what

00:27:18.759 --> 00:27:25.808
has happened in your life as far as your relationships
are concerned.

00:27:25.808 --> 00:27:32.329
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga,
they cannot happen.

00:27:32.329 --> 00:27:38.438
It has been worked out that way, it cannot
happen.

00:27:38.438 --> 00:27:43.259
If this hand is paining, the other hand is
there to help it out.

00:27:43.259 --> 00:27:48.909
You’re not alone, you are in the body of
the collective being.

00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:57.428
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic
people, Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such

00:27:57.428 --> 00:28:03.959
people – in Sanskrit language they are called
as “mudhahs.”

00:28:03.959 --> 00:28:12.699
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence

00:28:12.699 --> 00:28:24.928
has that capacity – and to indulge into
things which are not Sahaj.

00:28:24.928 --> 00:28:29.488
Slowly you will find your vibrations will
disappear, you’ll become sick, you’ll

00:28:29.488 --> 00:28:37.409
have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

00:28:37.409 --> 00:28:49.569
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever

00:28:49.569 --> 00:29:00.019
anybody tries to be troublesome in My body
I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

00:29:00.019 --> 00:29:10.769
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when
every moment you are hanged onto a cross by

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:17.099
anyone who wants to do it.

00:29:17.099 --> 00:29:26.109
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands
to torture My life, to trouble Me if they

00:29:26.109 --> 00:29:38.868
want to; but they have also such a capacity,
such a caliber, such a potential that they

00:29:38.868 --> 00:29:43.579
can reside in My heart forever.

00:29:43.579 --> 00:29:49.869
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will
say.

00:29:49.869 --> 00:29:55.289
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

00:29:55.289 --> 00:30:05.149
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the
fear of the past.

00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:13.219
In the past if you have done anything wrong,
in the past we have had bad experiences of

00:30:13.219 --> 00:30:16.549
people, we are very frightened.

00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:25.859
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen
it Myself that in England when we were staying

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:35.829
– it was that day unluckily or luckily it
was snowing for the first time, and we were

00:30:35.829 --> 00:30:38.269
shifting, so I had gone out.

00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:46.698
And when I came back I saw a lady and a little
baby in a pram, standing at the door and talking

00:30:46.698 --> 00:30:47.698
to some lady.

00:30:47.698 --> 00:30:55.549
The other lady was just talking through a
little opening in the door, because there

00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:57.458
was a chain on.

00:30:57.458 --> 00:31:05.179
Then I went out and came back after half-an-hour,
and I saw the same thing.

00:31:05.179 --> 00:31:11.338
The lady was still standing in the snow, and
this lady was talking to her through a chink.

00:31:11.338 --> 00:31:13.809
I was surprised.

00:31:13.809 --> 00:31:19.109
What is this going like “Midsummer’s Night’s
Dream,” these people are talking to each

00:31:19.109 --> 00:31:22.359
other – horrible!

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:28.389
What was it that was frightening to this lady
inside the room – what this lady would have

00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:31.569
done with the child, who had come to her door?

00:31:31.569 --> 00:31:35.319
What was there to be so frightened of?

00:31:35.319 --> 00:31:42.718
Because of the ego within yourself: you have
frightened others, you have tortured others,

00:31:42.718 --> 00:31:50.399
you have dominated others, you have done all
these things, so there is fear in your mind

00:31:50.399 --> 00:31:55.379
that others may do the same thing to you.

00:31:55.379 --> 00:31:59.639
Or what is there to be so much frightened,
to lock your doors to everyone who comes to

00:31:59.639 --> 00:32:04.789
your house?

00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:12.509
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured
by someone or troubled by someone, so your

00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:16.249
heart is closed, you can’t open heart to
others.

00:32:16.249 --> 00:32:20.479
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

00:32:20.479 --> 00:32:22.919
What has happened?

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:27.179
Just like a dead body moving about.

00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:37.308
Supposing I was like this, who would have
told you the secrets of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara?

00:32:37.308 --> 00:32:43.849
So this kind of a nature comes from people
who are frightened in the past perhaps, or

00:32:43.849 --> 00:32:50.889
they might have frightened people with their
bad Vishuddhi.

00:32:50.889 --> 00:32:59.799
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in
the West, and that also is inherited by you

00:32:59.799 --> 00:33:00.979
people.

00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:05.359
As soon as you put them onto something, they
become aggressive.

00:33:05.359 --> 00:33:09.039
I can’t bear it within Myself.

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:17.948
Supposing I have some sort of a medicine that
makes some cells very aggressive, then what

00:33:17.948 --> 00:33:18.948
happens?

00:33:18.948 --> 00:33:22.578
Ultimately I become a patient of cancer.

00:33:22.578 --> 00:33:35.889
An aggressive cell is called as the malignant
cell, and such a cell cannot give you proper

00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:43.719
attention, cannot give you proper depth, but
you become nothing but a malignant cell, a

00:33:43.719 --> 00:33:48.089
cell which is creating a cancer.

00:33:48.089 --> 00:33:52.489
And such a person creates cancer among Sahaja
yogis.

00:33:52.489 --> 00:34:02.629
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some
women, some men have become aggressive.

00:34:02.629 --> 00:34:07.099
With a little position they get, immediately
they become aggressive.

00:34:07.099 --> 00:34:16.349
Say somebody is a wife of a organizer, or
a so-called leader’s, then she thinks she

00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:25.509
is nothing but a prime minister or something
– or her husband becomes something.

00:34:25.509 --> 00:34:31.069
This aggressiveness adds to the aggressiveness
of another person.

00:34:31.069 --> 00:34:32.889
So then reaction starts.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:37.189
One says something, the another says something;
we become reactionaries.

00:34:37.189 --> 00:34:42.619
We haven’t got something of our own, that
we should be reactionaries?

00:34:42.619 --> 00:34:50.729
There should be no reaction to anything, because
we have something of our own.

00:34:50.729 --> 00:34:56.908
Why should we react to something, whatever
people are doing to us or have done to us?

00:34:56.908 --> 00:34:58.338
– it’s finished.

00:34:58.338 --> 00:35:00.479
Open your hearts.

00:35:00.479 --> 00:35:07.139
That’s why when you came to India, I think
you must have noticed that in the Indian heart

00:35:07.139 --> 00:35:17.578
there is nothing like an anger for say, for
English or for Portuguese, or for anybody

00:35:17.578 --> 00:35:19.909
who has dominated them.

00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:27.029
They have so much love and affection and respect,
and they see that what good you have done

00:35:27.029 --> 00:35:28.179
to them.

00:35:28.179 --> 00:35:35.819
Like some barristers came to India and they
visited some high courts, and they had holiday

00:35:35.819 --> 00:35:47.159
for one day to celebrate the visit of these
British lawyers and barristers.

00:35:47.159 --> 00:35:55.719
But if you go to England they will beat you,
throw you out.

00:35:55.719 --> 00:36:01.989
This aggressiveness has to go from your heart,
it has to get out of it.

00:36:01.989 --> 00:36:10.859
There’s no place in My body for aggressive
people, no place at all.

00:36:10.859 --> 00:36:19.389
I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn’t
aggress Me.

00:36:19.389 --> 00:36:23.799
If you aggress any Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing
Me.

00:36:23.799 --> 00:36:27.579
But when it comes to others, they won’t
aggress others.

00:36:27.579 --> 00:36:35.838
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife,
but not other people.

00:36:35.838 --> 00:36:39.609
So those who are non-Sahaja yogis, they do
not aggress them.

00:36:39.609 --> 00:36:48.208
That’s a very important part of Sahasrara,
because ego covers a great part of Sahasrara,

00:36:48.208 --> 00:36:56.958
and if your Sahasrara is covered with this
ego business, how can I help you and how can

00:36:56.958 --> 00:36:58.869
I help Myself?

00:36:58.869 --> 00:37:12.359
Now so many of you are in My body, just imagine,
circulating fast; and most of them are fighting

00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:16.119
to be in My heart, but they are settling in
My ego.

00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:25.389
Well, I am egoless, because I have no reactions.

00:37:25.389 --> 00:37:28.409
If you have no reaction you cannot develop
ego.

00:37:28.409 --> 00:37:33.129
I’ve no reactions, I’m reactionless.

00:37:33.129 --> 00:37:49.109
I am in My own peace and glory, trying to
work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:49.109 --> 00:38:02.619
I do not react to anything, but your reactions
trouble Me because you are within Me.

00:38:02.619 --> 00:38:09.479
Then the second part is the fear that comes
from childhood.

00:38:09.479 --> 00:38:18.019
I do not know about Americans, but so many
Americans who came to Me were half-mad, cracked

00:38:18.019 --> 00:38:23.289
people, absolutely cracked in the head, nothing
normal about them.

00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:27.989
Either they will not talk – if they talk
they talk irrelevantly, you don’t know what

00:38:27.989 --> 00:38:29.429
they are talking about.

00:38:29.429 --> 00:38:31.600
Same with the French.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:41.849
French were mad much before anybody was mad
in this world, I think; very cracky people

00:38:41.849 --> 00:38:49.649
you see, very difficult, it’s absolutely
can’t understand, everything upside-down.

00:38:49.649 --> 00:39:00.919
When you blame our Indian telephone, you must
know they were made by French.

00:39:00.919 --> 00:39:10.989
I always say that in Pune we have got the
telephone just to see, because it is called

00:39:10.989 --> 00:39:17.080
as “Punya Patnam” – means the, is the
“city of punyas” – and only God can

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:25.169
listen to this telephone, but even God cannot!

00:39:25.169 --> 00:39:36.039
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what
you call this madness, aggressive madness,

00:39:36.039 --> 00:39:51.669
comes from ego going to the level of super-ego;
and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

00:39:51.669 --> 00:39:58.468
When they talk you feel they are fighting,
and these are love talks, “romantic” they

00:39:58.468 --> 00:40:02.359
say, and we feel they are fighting.

00:40:02.359 --> 00:40:11.208
And then after some time the aggressiveness
is very apparent, and then it becomes as if

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:15.899
they are off their heads, absolutely off their
heads.

00:40:15.899 --> 00:40:20.159
And it’s very common with Americans, very
common.

00:40:20.159 --> 00:40:29.829
You can’t find Americans when they are talking,
any good speaker, who doesn’t have twitches

00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:36.468
on his faces, on his body, everywhere, because
so many nerves have been already strained

00:40:36.468 --> 00:40:50.239
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business
– going to the other extreme of deciding

00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:52.729
everything for yourself.

00:40:52.729 --> 00:41:07.838
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should
say, a very big ghost, and which is not in

00:41:07.838 --> 00:41:11.349
the past or the future, but in the present.

00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:13.468
And that ghost I call it as materialism.

00:41:13.468 --> 00:41:24.649
Materialism – it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible
devil that has come onto the heads of Americans,

00:41:24.649 --> 00:41:30.799
and from them to all of us.

00:41:30.799 --> 00:41:35.269
This materialism is a horrible stuff.

00:41:35.269 --> 00:41:48.659
It’s so ridiculous, shameful, doesn’t
even suit a human person; even a dog would

00:41:48.659 --> 00:42:01.099
hate such a materialism, to what level human
beings have gone.

00:42:01.099 --> 00:42:07.568
This materialism makes a person absolutely
shameless.

00:42:07.568 --> 00:42:18.299
A lady would not mind asking another lady,
“By the way, have you got my spoons with

00:42:18.299 --> 00:42:19.299
you?”

00:42:19.299 --> 00:42:23.019
There’s no shame in it.

00:42:23.019 --> 00:42:33.759
When we were small we were told in India – I
mean, that’s our culture – that if somebody’s

00:42:33.759 --> 00:42:41.889
pin is in your house you should preserve it
and return it, but even if your diamond is

00:42:41.889 --> 00:42:45.338
lost with somebody, never ask for it.

00:42:45.338 --> 00:42:50.609
Is not good manners.

00:42:50.609 --> 00:43:01.229
What is more valuable is not the diamond,
is the relationship, is the friendship, and

00:43:01.229 --> 00:43:05.779
the emotions of human beings to be respected.

00:43:05.779 --> 00:43:07.779
How can you ask?

00:43:07.779 --> 00:43:12.139
If there was a diamond they would have found
it and would have given it to you, but if

00:43:12.139 --> 00:43:19.239
there is no asking for that or reporting like
that then it’s sure there’s no diamond;

00:43:19.239 --> 00:43:20.808
and even if it is there, doesn’t matter.

00:43:20.808 --> 00:43:29.399
After all, what is a diamond? – you are
wearing or they are wearing, what does it

00:43:29.399 --> 00:43:30.399
matter?

00:43:30.399 --> 00:43:36.622
In My father’s house all the doors were
open all the time, all the doors, day and

00:43:36.622 --> 00:43:37.622
night.

00:43:37.622 --> 00:43:43.269
Never a thief came in, thought that doors
are open so nothing is locked, there’s nothing

00:43:43.269 --> 00:43:44.269
precious.

00:43:44.269 --> 00:43:53.068
Only we had one theft, and the thief came
and took away a gramophone from us, and some

00:43:53.068 --> 00:43:54.068
records.

00:43:54.068 --> 00:43:56.399
So My father said, “He’s a connoisseur.

00:43:56.399 --> 00:43:59.809
He took the right thing from this house, so
let it be.

00:43:59.809 --> 00:44:08.389
What’s the use of informing the police?”

00:44:08.389 --> 00:44:20.849
So this materialism that comes in is a mad,
mad, mad dog, and gives you a disease which

00:44:20.849 --> 00:44:25.529
is worse than any disease that is possible.

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:34.269
How people play on it, on this disease, as
you must have known that doctors when you

00:44:34.269 --> 00:44:39.169
get some disease little bit, they’ll take
out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out

00:44:39.169 --> 00:44:44.819
your nose, take out your purse and take out
everything that you have, for a little thing

00:44:44.819 --> 00:44:47.929
like malaria or something.

00:44:47.929 --> 00:44:56.909
But this disease takes away everything that
is beautiful within you, that is good within

00:44:56.909 --> 00:44:58.219
you.

00:44:58.219 --> 00:45:02.429
For example, it started a fashion.

00:45:02.429 --> 00:45:05.229
With this materialism they start fashions.

00:45:05.229 --> 00:45:09.739
Ladies are more vulnerable.

00:45:09.739 --> 00:45:17.619
Fashion starts, any sort of fashion starts,
like the sleeves to be made long – in India

00:45:17.619 --> 00:45:25.249
also they started – then make it short,
then make it half, then make it no sleeves.

00:45:25.249 --> 00:45:27.019
I said, “I am not running that race.

00:45:27.019 --> 00:45:32.188
I will have the sleeves all the time, same
sleeves so I don’t have to bother.

00:45:32.188 --> 00:45:37.989
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever
way I want to have, the tailor, because he

00:45:37.989 --> 00:45:43.239
knows I make one style” – finished with
it.

00:45:43.239 --> 00:45:46.539
Why do people want to run with the fashion?

00:45:46.539 --> 00:45:53.299
Just think of it, what is the need to run
with the fashion?

00:45:53.299 --> 00:45:56.049
Now new race has started, run with it.

00:45:56.049 --> 00:45:58.889
Then another race has started, run with it.

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:03.849
Then the third race has started, run with
it – all the time running with the mad race

00:46:03.849 --> 00:46:08.718
of fashions.

00:46:08.718 --> 00:46:15.769
Now a new race has started of fashions not
to put any oil in the head, so you become

00:46:15.769 --> 00:46:18.169
bald, then you buy wigs.

00:46:18.169 --> 00:46:24.359
It’s all entrepreneurs who are working out,
it’s all enterprises.

00:46:24.359 --> 00:46:36.369
So you become absolutely bald-headed people,
then you get your wigs from them, then there

00:46:36.369 --> 00:46:40.909
is a special charge for dressing the wigs,
so you go for dressing the wigs.

00:46:40.909 --> 00:46:44.279
Goes on like mad.

00:46:44.279 --> 00:46:56.319
Then there’s another type: now a new fashion
has started in London because, you see, these

00:46:56.319 --> 00:46:58.339
people want to make some money.

00:46:58.339 --> 00:47:03.889
People don’t even have so much of logic
and intelligence left in their heads to see

00:47:03.889 --> 00:47:08.589
that what they were preaching one day, they
are just the thing against it.

00:47:08.589 --> 00:47:15.089
Formerly it was you had to wear a tail coat,
you had to have your hair absolutely done

00:47:15.089 --> 00:47:21.879
with proper hair-grooming and all that, as
you can see in the old pictures.

00:47:21.879 --> 00:47:27.089
Then it started striped three-piece suits.

00:47:27.089 --> 00:47:36.469
Now it is, I mean, few days earlier was tight
clothes, then they developed varicose veins,

00:47:36.469 --> 00:47:37.499
you see.

00:47:37.499 --> 00:47:43.179
So no, no – now it is the fashion to wear
absolutely loose dresses.

00:47:43.179 --> 00:47:48.999
I saw the other day one lady making a dress
out of a big blanket, going like this.

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:57.479
I thought she was some priest or someone!

00:47:57.479 --> 00:48:00.699
So that stupidity has started.

00:48:00.699 --> 00:48:10.799
Imagine – think of Sahasrara, think of Divine,
in what world we are, and in what world the

00:48:10.799 --> 00:48:14.759
stupid people are going.

00:48:14.759 --> 00:48:22.939
That’s another world, absolutely another
stupid world where people just go after nonsensical

00:48:22.939 --> 00:48:29.499
things, changing from one to another, changing
from everything: ties are changed, everything

00:48:29.499 --> 00:48:31.549
is changed, giving you such a headache.

00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:34.429
All the time you have to think, “Now what
fashion is there?

00:48:34.429 --> 00:48:36.659
Let’s find out in the newspaper.

00:48:36.659 --> 00:48:38.199
What is – this is the fashion now.

00:48:38.199 --> 00:48:41.099
All right, wear this dress.”

00:48:41.099 --> 00:48:46.369
All this is befooling going on, because this
ghost has entered into us.

00:48:46.369 --> 00:48:57.159
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,
materialism should not enter into your minds.

00:48:57.159 --> 00:49:03.079
It’s nothing important.

00:49:03.079 --> 00:49:08.969
Even when somebody dies you are supposed to
wear something black, or white or I don’t

00:49:08.969 --> 00:49:11.399
know what else, but white or black.

00:49:11.399 --> 00:49:19.219
And somebody died in England who was a great
friend of My husband, and I had no black sari,

00:49:19.219 --> 00:49:20.219
completely black.

00:49:20.219 --> 00:49:22.219
I mean we don’t have such a sari.

00:49:22.219 --> 00:49:23.669
I didn’t know what to do.

00:49:23.669 --> 00:49:25.819
I told My husband I don’t have a black sari.

00:49:25.819 --> 00:49:28.289
He said, “Then You don’t come.”

00:49:28.289 --> 00:49:34.029
Imagine how his wife would feel if I don’t
go to the thing, how she would take it.

00:49:34.029 --> 00:49:41.309
All this is nothing, what is important is
the black sari!

00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:49.089
In every walk of life you are being befooled
by this materialism.

00:49:49.089 --> 00:49:54.949
I don’t know how you got stuck into it first
of all.

00:49:54.949 --> 00:49:57.819
And the other side is, the same people are
befooling you.

00:49:57.819 --> 00:50:03.929
“All right, this is not good, this is too
much” – so go to the anti-culture.

00:50:03.929 --> 00:50:09.769
What is anti-culture is another kind of materialism,
another kind of nonsense.

00:50:09.769 --> 00:50:16.569
Nowadays they are having in this London an
anti-culture movement which is called as “punks.”

00:50:16.569 --> 00:50:23.199
I think out of date now Me, but still what’s
for the time being as I see is punks.

00:50:23.199 --> 00:50:26.709
It costs them forty pounds sometimes to make
that hair.

00:50:26.709 --> 00:50:35.519
I mean, is it something that you are saving
money on that?

00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:42.779
So the whole thing works out just to take
out your attention from reality, from higher

00:50:42.779 --> 00:50:51.289
values, to something nonsensical.

00:50:51.289 --> 00:51:00.059
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead
a life of collectivity.

00:51:00.059 --> 00:51:07.299
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

00:51:07.299 --> 00:51:13.449
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this
is mine, and this I own.”

00:51:13.449 --> 00:51:18.679
Even about children you should not do like
that, “This is my own child, this is my

00:51:18.679 --> 00:51:19.889
own baby.

00:51:19.889 --> 00:51:28.309
This is my brother, this is my sister.”

00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:33.819
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s
not possible, it’s not easy to forget about

00:51:33.819 --> 00:51:39.409
it because left Nabhi and right Nabhi has
to be all right.

00:51:39.409 --> 00:51:45.649
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s
all Yours.”

00:51:45.649 --> 00:51:51.999
It’s not dangerous to say that, because
I’ll never take anything that is supposed

00:51:51.999 --> 00:51:55.859
to be yours.

00:51:55.859 --> 00:52:00.589
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,”
to start it – “It’s all Yours.

00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:08.599
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all my things
are Yours, my life is Yours.”

00:52:08.599 --> 00:52:13.729
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

00:52:13.729 --> 00:52:22.799
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,
extremely simple, and can be moved with very

00:52:22.799 --> 00:52:28.519
little actions, can be pleased with very few
little actions here and there.

00:52:28.519 --> 00:52:32.029
Not much is needed to please the deity of
Sahasrara.

00:52:32.029 --> 00:52:42.349
It’s a very simple person; little things
make Her happy.

00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:48.029
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and
I didn’t take them.

00:52:48.029 --> 00:52:51.759
You all must have thought, “What’s it,
we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding

00:52:51.759 --> 00:52:52.909
in our hand.”

00:52:52.909 --> 00:52:58.099
But I wanted to show this miracle to you,
that’s why I didn’t take.

00:52:58.099 --> 00:53:03.979
And I took it in the end, and see now they
are the best among all of them; don’t they

00:53:03.979 --> 00:53:09.899
look as if they have been plucked from the
tree?

00:53:09.899 --> 00:53:15.999
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m
tired,” I sat down and then I looked at

00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:24.379
you with the flowers, you see, in the hands,
you’re sitting all of you!

00:53:24.379 --> 00:53:33.989
So She is Leela Vinodini.

00:53:33.989 --> 00:53:42.519
She plays around, makes little mischiefs here
and there for you to learn lessons.

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:49.179
Because if I tell you “Do this” then it’s
not possible, but little circuitous way I

00:53:49.179 --> 00:53:52.909
can show you that this is wrong, you should
not do it.

00:53:52.909 --> 00:53:58.789
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have
taken all the flowers; but somebody must have

00:53:58.789 --> 00:54:02.419
thought of it, why Mother has not taken the
flowers today.

00:54:02.419 --> 00:54:10.739
I don’t know if you thought of it or not,
but I knew it Myself that I have to take the

00:54:10.739 --> 00:54:16.169
flowers to show this miracle to them, that
these flowers are going to last much longer

00:54:16.169 --> 00:54:23.589
than any other flowers, because they are vibrated
with the Brahmachaitanya.

00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:28.629
And the water was very, very, very cold, so
even I opened a hot water tap.

00:54:28.629 --> 00:54:37.479
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t
die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

00:54:37.479 --> 00:54:44.299
So you have seen so many miracles of this
Brahmachaitanya which is showing on your photographs,

00:54:44.299 --> 00:54:51.939
on so many your lives, in so many changes
that have taken place within yourself, within

00:54:51.939 --> 00:54:56.139
your family, within every one of you.

00:54:56.139 --> 00:55:00.519
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

00:55:00.519 --> 00:55:06.779
All this you are receiving because you are
blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

00:55:06.779 --> 00:55:12.069
But others are not, so your attitude should
be towards them that they are in the other

00:55:12.069 --> 00:55:15.449
world – what to do, how to help them?

00:55:15.449 --> 00:55:21.489
We should try to help them if possible, but
up to a point.

00:55:21.489 --> 00:55:23.959
We should not drag down ourselves for others’
sake.

00:55:23.959 --> 00:55:30.149
Up to a point only we can help them, and we
have to be very happy that Sahaja Yoga is

00:55:30.149 --> 00:55:33.639
spreading so much horizontally.

00:55:33.639 --> 00:55:38.329
But for vertical thing we must know our quality
must improve.

00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:43.149
If some people rise higher, others will also
start rising with them.

00:55:43.149 --> 00:55:50.329
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should
be there, absolutely understanding should

00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:52.859
be there.

00:55:52.859 --> 00:55:57.089
Open your hearts to each other, so that you
open your hearts to Me.

00:55:57.089 --> 00:56:02.439
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise
it won’t work out.

00:56:02.439 --> 00:56:11.279
That is a great thing that has happened, when
you are on this Earth, when you are the ones

00:56:11.279 --> 00:56:14.719
who have to receive this great blessing.

00:56:14.719 --> 00:56:21.219
So many saints did not receive it, so many
great people who came on this Earth, they

00:56:21.219 --> 00:56:22.499
did not receive it.

00:56:22.499 --> 00:56:28.529
Even the incarnations who came on this Earth
could not do it what you are doing.

00:56:28.529 --> 00:56:37.209
So have that satisfaction and glory of your
own being and of your own standard, and of

00:56:37.209 --> 00:56:38.209
your own caliber.

00:56:38.209 --> 00:56:43.469
The others are not of your caliber, all right,
forget about it.

00:56:43.469 --> 00:56:49.789
That should not give you ego, but should give
you a personality that does not react.

00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:57.889
We have something of our own, we do not react
to things.

00:56:57.889 --> 00:57:00.909
We are not reactionaries.

00:57:00.909 --> 00:57:07.729
And things will disappear which are harmful.

00:57:07.729 --> 00:57:13.356
Everything will be perfectly all right, because
we are standing

00:57:13.385 --> 00:57:16.255
in our own perfection, in our own glory.

00:57:16.271 --> 00:57:17.818
What do we need?

00:57:17.904 --> 00:57:20.982
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

00:57:24.202 --> 00:57:26.795
May God bless you all.
