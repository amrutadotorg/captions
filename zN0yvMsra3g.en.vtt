WEBVTT

00:02.150 --> 00:12.362
Every year we have birthdays of various
people,

00:12.563 --> 00:17.514
and every year we make a vow that,

00:17.730 --> 00:24.082
“This year I will not do this or
I will not do that.”

00:28.847 --> 00:39.314
This is a very good way of seeing how far
we have come in life.

00:43.039 --> 00:51.321
Many people who really have achieved

00:52.011 --> 00:57.040
a very great height in their spiritual life

00:58.747 --> 01:01.829
did not need a birthday,

01:02.030 --> 01:11.134
but every day they felt it’s a birthday
to start,

01:15.090 --> 01:22.287
to go ahead, to understand, to learn.

01:22.488 --> 01:27.176
Every day is a new year for them.

01:29.043 --> 01:44.916
In our own life we see that our
surroundings change very slowly.

01:45.330 --> 01:51.120
Sometimes it is shocking; sometimes you
are surprised

01:51.328 --> 01:56.138
how the surroundings are not changing.

01:56.363 --> 02:06.767
But, in a subtle way, there is a tremendous
change

02:06.968 --> 02:13.778
that is happening within us and without.

02:14.487 --> 02:22.247
The whole atmosphere today is governed
by human beings.

02:23.502 --> 02:31.592
I don’t know how far Paramchaitanya
works it out,

02:31.802 --> 02:43.679
but it is for us to open ourselves to new
dimensions in our lives.

02:44.119 --> 02:49.049
For example, if we find we still have…

02:49.266 --> 02:53.815
through our introspection we locate

02:54.016 --> 03:01.968
that we have these old, subtle, nonsensical
things still hanging around us,

03:02.217 --> 03:08.681
we don’t have to vow for it. You have
to just witness it,

03:08.882 --> 03:16.444
and the destructive path it is taking
you to.

03:16.645 --> 03:20.419
Immediately you will give up.

03:20.620 --> 03:26.666
You don’t have to worry as to put a vow
upon yourself,

03:26.867 --> 03:30.766
because now you are “samarth”,

03:30.967 --> 03:43.552
meaning now you are absolutely empowered.

03:44.006 --> 03:50.306
Whatever you think is wrong, your
attention itself on it

03:50.507 --> 03:58.774
will slowly, gradually remove the doubts

04:01.748 --> 04:12.666
about having those problems, those
connections,

04:12.867 --> 04:21.106
conditions and ego that are lingering
still.

04:21.306 --> 04:26.649
Definitely you will drop them.

04:26.849 --> 04:33.278
With your attention it will run away.

04:35.680 --> 04:43.225
Then you will realise that every day your
attention is getting purified,

04:43.426 --> 04:50.939
getting powerful, getting compassionate.

04:51.150 --> 05:01.895
Normally, whatever reaction you have
in your attention just disappears,

05:02.096 --> 05:06.718
and you start witnessing the whole thing,

05:06.919 --> 05:12.073
and your power of attention,

05:12.274 --> 05:20.925
through that witnessing force, acts and it
works.

05:21.126 --> 05:31.435
It works not only on you, but on everything
that surrounds you.

05:32.247 --> 05:39.694
Firstly, through your meditation, in that
state of meditation,

05:39.895 --> 05:49.168
you expand within yourself. You stay
in the present.

05:49.671 --> 05:54.236
The other day, somebody asked me,
“Where was Your last birthday?”

05:54.437 --> 05:59.424
I just forgot where it was.

06:00.070 --> 06:06.480
Otherwise my memory is very good, like
an elephant.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.695
But this I forgot.

06:09.896 --> 06:24.576
Perhaps, every time, every day, you live
in the present and you grow,

06:24.777 --> 06:32.221
so you forget when and where this growth
has taken place.

06:34.269 --> 06:40.390
My own growth has been like this

06:41.593 --> 06:50.774
that every time I go to a place,

06:53.132 --> 07:00.913
I find very nice new people coming in

07:01.114 --> 07:09.612
and some of the horrible ones from the old
lot disappearing.

07:09.813 --> 07:16.348
It’s something like, when the tree grows,

07:16.621 --> 07:24.252
the leaves go on falling and new leaves
start coming.

07:25.415 --> 07:30.487
But in Sahaja Yoga, it’s something
different I find,

07:30.688 --> 07:45.076
that on the tree of Sahaj Yog very few,
very very few leaves fall off,

07:45.277 --> 07:53.563
and you sometimes face a lush garden
of beautiful people.

07:55.967 --> 08:06.342
To me, it’s like a miraculous fireworks.

08:06.543 --> 08:18.071
It starts like a small line and then opens
up into several beautiful patterns.

08:19.049 --> 08:24.786
It is impossible to envisage
or to visualise

08:24.986 --> 08:37.259
what will happen to us, to Sahaj Yog
and to all of you.

08:39.889 --> 08:46.205
I have never learned to imagine things,

08:46.770 --> 08:56.940
but the vision that you see is really
remarkable, it’s very remarkable,

08:57.141 --> 09:07.408
that I see all Sahaja Yogis drenched
in Divine Love

09:07.972 --> 09:28.256
and expressing themselves in a very
beautiful and very deep manner.

09:28.509 --> 09:39.783
This, when comes in, that really makes your
attention absolutely enwrapped

09:39.984 --> 09:47.521
in such Divine Bliss that you forget that
moment.

09:47.722 --> 09:53.940
One of those moments are when you celebrate
my birthday.

09:54.141 --> 10:00.272
I even forget how many years I have lived
on this Earth.

10:00.909 --> 10:06.071
Sometimes I say I am seventy-three,
sometimes I say I am seventy -

10:06.272 --> 10:12.877
I just don’t know. Because, as I told you,

10:13.202 --> 10:26.148
it does not leave any mark of time,
of date, of years, in that blissful state.

10:26.349 --> 10:33.138
As if sometimes you can think that you went
to see something very beautiful,

10:33.339 --> 10:37.477
like Taj Mahal, without knowing what it is,

10:37.678 --> 10:46.435
and suddenly you find such a beautiful
building unexpectedly.

10:46.636 --> 10:53.700
You just get blindfolded, as they say.
In Hindi say “avak”.

10:53.901 --> 11:00.357
You don’t know how to express, you become
speechless.

11:00.814 --> 11:07.473
And invariably you’ll find, that time
you’ll forget the time.

11:07.674 --> 11:12.011
You will forget how you came there.

11:12.212 --> 11:15.671
All the story behind all that finishes off

11:15.872 --> 11:21.143
as soon as you see the reality of
the vision.

11:21.435 --> 11:35.753
This reality of the vision is something
beyond even my thinking and imagination.

11:37.482 --> 11:48.084
I cannot, even now sometimes, believe that
there are so many Sahaja Yogis

11:48.285 --> 11:52.457
who have got this subtle knowledge.

11:55.747 --> 12:01.583
I never knew that there are so many
seekers, to begin with.

12:02.602 --> 12:08.071
I never knew that there are such subtle
people on this Earth.

12:08.272 --> 12:21.078
All over the world, wherever I went,
whether I went to Nepal or to Brazil,

12:21.448 --> 12:31.505
suddenly I find facing so many beautiful
seekers.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.219
If you ask me, “When did You go
to Brazil?”,

12:35.420 --> 12:39.116
I won’t be able to tell you the dates.

12:39.317 --> 12:43.769
I have very bad memory for dates for
the same reason, I think,

12:43.970 --> 12:47.244
because every time I see a vision.

12:47.445 --> 12:55.241
And the time also just stops for that
moment.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.691
It doesn’t express itself,

12:59.892 --> 13:05.778
nothing is recorded, except for
the experience.

13:06.002 --> 13:15.898
And this experience is in an abstract form.
You cannot describe it.

13:16.387 --> 13:27.602
It is beyond words and beyond any
description.

13:28.060 --> 13:35.244
At that time you really become thoughtless,

13:36.035 --> 13:43.317
and that is the time we have to really
enjoy.

13:43.518 --> 13:51.850
The greatest curse of modern times is
the watch, all the time that we keep.

13:53.034 --> 14:04.777
And all the time we are just seeing
the time, what time it is now,

14:04.993 --> 14:10.456
and after two seconds again also you want
to see what is the time.

14:12.630 --> 14:17.238
We have crossed the limits of time -
kalatit.

14:17.439 --> 14:25.815
Try to understand why we have crossed,
because time moves according to us.

14:26.184 --> 14:29.358
You can experience it.

14:29.607 --> 14:33.280
The other day I was coming from Delhi,

14:33.481 --> 14:40.609
and in my household everybody seems to be
very particular about time.

14:40.810 --> 14:44.217
So they were after my life, “Come along,
come along. Getting late, getting late.

14:44.433 --> 14:50.997
Now, you just can’t get into the plane,”
this, that. All right.

14:51.322 --> 14:55.322
And when I reached there, they said that,
“The plane is still waiting.

14:55.540 --> 14:59.320
It’s not…  it’s not necessary for you
to hurry up.

14:59.521 --> 15:04.565
It will take at least fifteen, twenty
minutes for you to go.”

15:04.766 --> 15:11.359
So, also this name of ‘airport’ makes
people really jumpy, I should say.

15:11.584 --> 15:16.059
They have to go to the aeroplane means
as if some war is there

15:16.260 --> 15:19.619
or I don’t know what it is.

15:20.679 --> 15:27.916
So far, luckily, I have never missed a
plane, never missed a train in my lifetime.

15:28.117 --> 15:35.228
Though I travel, I think, quite a lot.
I have every time found, invariably,

15:35.429 --> 15:44.377
that the plane itself is waiting for me,
it won’t leave.

15:44.578 --> 15:51.192
Like, I’ll give you a very interesting
example today, if you are relaxed.

15:51.728 --> 16:09.747
We were in Prague, and we were supposed
to go to Poland via…

16:09.948 --> 16:16.119
again same thing happens to me with
experience I had... via Vienna.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.667
And we had a very great Sahaja Yogi with us

16:19.868 --> 16:24.255
who told me that the plane will be leaving
at eleven o’clock.

16:24.472 --> 16:30.254
And from the airport he rings me up,
“No, the plane is leaving at 9:30.”

16:30.455 --> 16:35.608
If I want, I can be ready in five minutes
or I can take two hours, depends on.

16:35.809 --> 16:37.898
So I was ready, I just jumped into the car.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.744
We reached the airport, but we were
late by fifteen minutes,

16:41.945 --> 16:47.885
and the ground lady started shouting at me
at the top of her voice,

16:48.086 --> 16:51.553
“You people, you are VIPs, you are this,
you are that.”

16:51.754 --> 16:55.010
All kinds of things she said to me.

16:55.210 --> 16:58.631
And this Sahaja Yogi could not bear it,

16:58.839 --> 17:03.339
and he felt that it was his mistake (that)
he told me a wrong time,

17:03.556 --> 17:07.747
“That’s why this lady is shouting at
my Mother.”

17:07.948 --> 17:12.174
He couldn’t bear it. He was very unhappy.

17:16.200 --> 17:20.314
[Aside to somebody: “You can turn it round.
Turn it.”]

17:20.568 --> 17:32.638
So, we went into the aeroplane with this
lady shouting behind,

17:33.264 --> 17:37.648
and we saw that the pilot and engineers,
they were busy

17:37.849 --> 17:41.168
with some correction of the machinery.

17:41.369 --> 17:46.007
They said, “It is little bit out of order,
it will be ready.” So we sat down.

17:46.208 --> 17:54.186
Now this Sahaja Yogi could not bear it, and
his tears started rolling down his eyes.

17:54.387 --> 17:59.068
Then another Sahaja Yogini, she said,
“Brother, it’s all right. Don’t cry.”

17:59.269 --> 18:02.498
They were sitting behind me, I just turned
round.

18:02.699 --> 18:05.794
I said, “It’s all right. Don’t worry.”

18:05.995 --> 18:09.315
He said, “No Mother, because of me she
could say all these things,

18:09.516 --> 18:14.604
you know, I can’t bear it.” And he couldn’t
stop crying.

18:14.805 --> 18:22.880
Within one minute, the sky, which was
absolutely open,

18:23.081 --> 18:28.618
was covered with big clouds like huge,
big elephants

18:28.819 --> 18:34.261
walking into the whole area - very big.

18:34.462 --> 18:38.435
All the Sahaja Yogis who were standing
also on the other side,

18:38.636 --> 18:43.860
on top of the airport, saw it happening.

18:44.061 --> 18:48.055
The whole thing became absolutely
jet-black.

18:48.256 --> 18:54.271
“Oh, my God,” I said, “see, the tears
of this gentleman has such powers.”

18:54.472 --> 18:58.547
And then the airport people told us that
this plane is out of order,

18:58.748 --> 19:06.141
so we have to get down. So we got down,
we came back.

19:06.342 --> 19:10.896
Then he went to this ground hostess
and told her,

19:11.096 --> 19:17.498
“Now, whom should we shout at? Now the
plane is not going, should we shout at you?

19:17.707 --> 19:21.496
How dare you shout at my Mother and
all those things?”

19:21.697 --> 19:29.055
But all the people there at the airport,

19:29.256 --> 19:35.650
who were still in… under the same regime
style, got such a fright.

19:35.851 --> 19:38.728
The manager himself walked to me. He said,

19:38.929 --> 19:42.744
“For your plane there’s still five hours
and if you want out

19:42.945 --> 19:45.617
we can give you permission, all of you
can go out.”

19:45.818 --> 19:51.603
And he took me by a special way. I couldn’t
understand this reaction though.

19:51.811 --> 19:55.177
So I went out and we did some shopping
or something,

19:55.378 --> 19:58.761
and when we came back we were surprised.

19:58.962 --> 20:02.862
All the airport was rather stunned by us.

20:03.063 --> 20:06.716
And when I walked, that was the only plane
that was leaving.

20:06.917 --> 20:11.189
All the traffic had stopped except
for this plane.

20:11.390 --> 20:17.950
And when we walked down to board the plane,

20:18.166 --> 20:23.874
the gentleman who was there said, “Mother,
can you help me?” I said, “How?”

20:24.075 --> 20:28.692
“I have got a terrible back pain.” I said,
“How can I do it?”

20:28.893 --> 20:32.256
Then one lady walked in to say, “Mother,
please,

20:32.457 --> 20:37.006
I have pain in my shoulder. Can you put
Your hand on that?”

20:37.207 --> 20:39.737
I just put my hand on her shoulder

20:39.938 --> 20:43.618
and she said, “I am feeling all right.”
She started lifting her arm.

20:43.819 --> 20:50.980
Then I went. I thought I’d better now
take to the aeroplane.

20:51.181 --> 20:53.968
When I was walking, the same gentleman
came to me,

20:54.169 --> 20:57.259
he said, “Why not put hand on my back?”

20:57.459 --> 21:00.596
I said, “I have to board the plane.”
He said, “I’ll walk with You.

21:00.797 --> 21:04.335
You just put Your hand on my back.
I’m sure I’ll be all right.”

21:04.535 --> 21:10.195
And we walked together about two minutes
or so, he said, “I’m all right.”

21:10.396 --> 21:14.185
The whole atmosphere changed.

21:14.386 --> 21:19.913
It was such a tremendous effect on these
people who have been under a regime

21:20.114 --> 21:25.141
and have been really military-like, and
the whole treatment was so funny.

21:25.342 --> 21:32.022
The whole thing changed in such a short
time,

21:32.223 --> 21:40.421
and I was amazed how the tears of this
Sahaja Yogi has worked this wonder.

21:40.622 --> 21:46.656
Now, imagine a moment when tears started
rolling his eyes,

21:46.857 --> 21:51.524
that moment just manifested a big drama.

21:51.725 --> 21:56.190
And, ultimately, what you find is

21:56.390 --> 22:06.984
that the people at the airport became
extremely humble and respectful.

22:08.827 --> 22:17.658
So when we start thinking of time and time
and time,

22:18.707 --> 22:25.844
we have to understand that time is our
slave; we are not slaves of the time.

22:26.045 --> 22:29.033
There are thousand and one stories I can
tell you

22:29.234 --> 22:36.311
how, by delaying in a place, by getting
late in a place,

22:36.512 --> 22:43.186
by not caring for the time, I have seen
such beautiful manifestations,

22:43.386 --> 22:51.340
such beautiful dramas - the art
of the Divine Power -

22:51.541 --> 22:58.874
that I was amazed how people worry so much
about the time.

22:59.623 --> 23:08.518
If time is really necessary, if we are all
watching our time

23:08.974 --> 23:12.767
every year, as our birthday,

23:12.968 --> 23:19.243
and if you think that time is very
important, it is in a way.

23:19.444 --> 23:26.328
In these modern times, we really need
the time for meditation,

23:26.529 --> 23:32.132
for collective meetings and for Sahaja
Yoga.

23:33.175 --> 23:38.166
I know when there was the war
of independence

23:38.367 --> 23:42.595
in this country, where my parents fought

23:42.796 --> 23:47.829
with all their ‘tana’ [body], ‘mana’
[mind], ‘dhana’ [wealth].

23:48.030 --> 23:54.226
That time I remember how they never
cared for anything.

23:54.427 --> 23:59.899
They went all out, because it was very
important

24:00.100 --> 24:08.669
to get this country freed from the clutches
of the Empire.

24:09.437 --> 24:14.466
And this was so important.

24:14.667 --> 24:17.195
They had to meet somebody at such a point.

24:17.396 --> 24:23.758
That man, supposing, is escaping from the
jail, or there’s some sort of a thing on,

24:23.959 --> 24:27.196
they could not afford to miss the time.

24:27.397 --> 24:34.715
They could not afford to just neglect that
important time, important meeting,

24:34.916 --> 24:40.682
important discussion, because everything
had become an emergency.

24:40.883 --> 24:44.462
For them, nobody told them, nobody gave
them lectures,

24:44.663 --> 24:49.235
but for them, from inside. They were
all legendary people, I should say,

24:49.436 --> 24:54.202
the way they fought for their freedom.

24:54.887 --> 24:58.628
This is, today, the same situation.

24:58.829 --> 25:03.657
It is an emergency, a very subtle
emergency

25:03.857 --> 25:11.172
that nothing is more important than
spreading Sahaja Yoga.

25:11.858 --> 25:17.255
If some people will miss it, will not know
about it,

25:17.456 --> 25:20.744
we will be responsible for that.

25:20.944 --> 25:25.620
At the time of Christ, Buddha, Mahavira
or anyone of them,

25:25.828 --> 25:29.441
there were no aeroplanes to travel.

25:29.642 --> 25:33.075
There were not these loudspeakers,

25:33.276 --> 25:38.959
also other communications and televisions
and all those things.

25:39.160 --> 25:43.437
All these things have come now.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.905
That has been manifested now.

25:47.105 --> 25:56.088
It is the work of Paramachaitanya.

25:56.289 --> 26:01.152
Through scientists, through other
knowledge,

26:01.353 --> 26:06.085
all this manifestation has taken place.

26:06.285 --> 26:10.423
Also, these people didn't have to face
people, so many,

26:10.624 --> 26:16.925
nor did they… were supposed to give
realisation to people in such a big number.

26:17.125 --> 26:22.653
So all these inventions,

26:23.075 --> 26:32.426
all that you see today as modern ventures
which we have got,

26:32.635 --> 26:36.898
they are all for Sahaja Yoga.

26:37.099 --> 26:45.889
Without Sahaj Yog, you cannot imagine
what would happen to this world.

26:46.090 --> 26:52.248
The first and foremost thing is we have
no peace within our hearts.

26:52.449 --> 26:56.787
We talk of peace. I know of people who
have got awards in peace,

26:56.987 --> 27:01.099
have no peace within their heart, no peace
at all.

27:01.299 --> 27:05.922
Unless and until we human beings have
peace,

27:06.123 --> 27:09.624
there cannot be peace in the whole world.

27:09.824 --> 27:15.740
It is we who create wars. It is we who
do all kinds of violence.

27:15.941 --> 27:25.505
It is we, we ruin the possibility of people
getting into the Kingdom of God.

27:25.705 --> 27:30.533
So, peace can be only achieved

27:31.283 --> 27:37.552
by establishing peace in the hearts
of the people.

27:37.753 --> 27:46.584
And that is only possible, that you achieve
the state of thoughtless awareness.

27:46.784 --> 27:49.595
You remain in the present.

27:49.803 --> 27:55.799
And there, where you’ll be amazed, you
will be standing like a rock,

27:56.000 --> 28:01.042
because you will have reality in your hand.

28:01.242 --> 28:03.511
You can work out the way you like.

28:03.712 --> 28:07.428
Actually, I don’t work out anything
whatsoever, really.

28:07.629 --> 28:11.377
You may say, “You do this and You
do that,” I don’t.

28:11.577 --> 28:18.431
It’s the Paramachaitanya, which works it.
In the same way, it will work for you also.

28:18.632 --> 28:27.107
But you must have faith in yourself and
absolute faith in Sahaja Yoga. Absolute.

28:27.307 --> 28:33.009
That’s the only way we can achieve this,

28:33.210 --> 28:40.469
that many, many, many people, most
of the people of the world -

28:40.670 --> 28:45.847
I wouldn’t say all of them, rather
difficult to say that but may be possible -

28:46.047 --> 28:49.263
should enter into the Kingdom of God
with us.

28:49.464 --> 28:53.637
That’s the most important thing, more than
all these worldly things,

28:53.838 --> 28:58.397
and more than all these nonsensical things.

28:59.179 --> 29:07.750
So the attention should be how many
people we are going to bring to Sahaj Yoga,

29:07.950 --> 29:17.241
how many we are going to save, what
are we going to do about it.

29:17.442 --> 29:20.503
When you have to think about it every
morning,

29:20.704 --> 29:24.656
how can you remember the time and date?

29:24.857 --> 29:31.128
When you are in emergency now, and you know
that this emergency has to be fulfilled,

29:31.328 --> 29:41.564
then how can you just pay attention to all
worldly things, all worldly achievements?

29:41.765 --> 29:46.011
That will take its own course. You don’t
have to worry.

29:46.211 --> 29:49.769
That works out automatically.

29:49.969 --> 29:54.948
Only thing where you really need your
own diversion,

29:55.149 --> 30:00.715
or your own focusing, is Sahaja Yoga,
in and out.

30:00.916 --> 30:06.375
If we really want peace on this Earth, if
we want really progress for ourselves,

30:06.575 --> 30:11.113
if we want all kinds of physical, mental
and emotional problems being solved,

30:11.314 --> 30:14.618
all for our good, why not we come
to Sahaj Yoga,

30:14.818 --> 30:23.203
where we don’t have to do anything except
for raising our Kundalini,

30:23.404 --> 30:29.243
except for meditating for it for very
little time

30:29.443 --> 30:34.531
and to achieve that state of joy?

30:35.042 --> 30:43.057
Today my feelings are really full of joy,
full of joy,

30:43.258 --> 30:48.387
because now I can see how things are
happening,

30:48.588 --> 30:55.746
how one person can produce thousands
and thousands of Sahaja Yogis.

30:55.947 --> 30:59.221
I saw one miracle, I told once

30:59.421 --> 31:05.225
that one seed has all the thousand trees
it is going to produce

31:05.425 --> 31:10.771
and when I saw a new technique of tissue
culture,

31:10.972 --> 31:14.215
I was amazed that on one little seed

31:14.416 --> 31:21.906
there were so many little, little primules
who had come out.

31:22.107 --> 31:27.481
In the same way, you are all capable, and
you all can do it,

31:27.681 --> 31:30.671
but what is needed is faith in yourself

31:30.871 --> 31:35.937
and also complete sincerity about Sahaja
Yoga.

31:36.138 --> 31:42.008
If that happens today, you have really
celebrated my birthday.

31:42.215 --> 31:46.967
If you think that my birthday is important,

31:47.167 --> 31:54.525
that for me very important is that
everybody gets their spiritual birthday.

31:54.726 --> 31:57.696
May God bless you.
