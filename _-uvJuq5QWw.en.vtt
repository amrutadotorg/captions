00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.520
Today, long time back,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.400
Christ was born.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.680
You all know the story of His birth.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.720
And

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.040
of all the sufferings He had to go through.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.920
He's the One who has

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.800
given us a model of a Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880
for He didn't live for Himself,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.840
in no way.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.200
But He lived for others,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.360
working out the Agnya chakra.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.800
You may be divine,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.640
you may be very powerful,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.480
but this world is so cruel

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.640
that they don't understand spirituality.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.640
They don't understand the spiritual greatness.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.360
Not only that,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.360
but there are many factors which attack spirituality.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.600
They have always done it.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.960
Every saint has suffered a lot.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:42.600
But I think Christ has suffered the most.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.280
As you know, He was endowed with all the powers of Shri Ganesh,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.640
as He is the reincarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.480
The first of them was His innocence.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.760
He was the eternal child we should say.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.840
That He couldn't understand the cruelties and the hypocrisy

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.440
of this stupid world.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.480
Still, if you understand what can you do about it?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.640
But with great courage He took birth

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.800
in the country where people had no idea of

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.080
spirituality.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.960
I have read a book about Him

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.680
saying that He came to Kashmir

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.320
where He met one of My forefathers - Shalivahana.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.920
It’s very interesting because it’s all in Sanskrit

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.599
and the writer perhaps did not know Sanskrit,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.960
so he has given

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.080
everything in Sanskrit language,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.040
which is not very congenial, I'm sure,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.720
to the Western people.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.080
Thank God he didn't know Sanskrit,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.520
otherwise it would have been very dangerous.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.360
It's written in that

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.920
that he asked Christ, “Why have You come to India?”

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.400
So He said, “This is My country,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.800
that's why I've come here,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.600
where people respect spirituality.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.880
But I live among people

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.000
who do not understand spirituality at all.”

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.120
His conversation

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.000
with him was very, very interesting.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.400
Because Shalivahana said

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.560
that “There is more reason that You should go back to Your country

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.720
and teach them Nirmala Tattwam.”

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.480
That's the principle of purification.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.640
Went back, after three and a half years,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.360
He was crucified.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.840
I personally think the big difference

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.360
between the Western execution and Indian

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.120
is that it’s -

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.760
in the West,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.599
killing is a very great profession.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.120
With the slightest pretext they kill people.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.920
Anybody who is a saint was killed

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.520
or they called him a madcap.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.320
It's the best way to avoid spirituality.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.280
While in India,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.320
if a saint says anything,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.080
then he is not challenged - never.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.120
But they believe in it.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.080
Because he is a saint, he is a much higher personality than we are.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.960
Though there were very nasty people around and they tortured them.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.240
But as a whole the public, the people, respected them.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.520
If there are false gurus, normally they don't stay in this country

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.560
because they know they'll be found out.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.520
Also they are so money-oriented that they go to America or

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.480
to some foreign countries and settle down there to make money.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.960
This is one of the signs one should see.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.920
This may be one of the reasons why

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.360
Christ was born in a very, very ordinary family.

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:42.280
He had no proper bed to sleep as a child also.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.560
It's all described,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.400
where He slept,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.760
how His mother and father

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:04.520
lived in a place where

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.680
there were cows and calves.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.280
It was to show that

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:22.200
spirituality doesn't need any luxury,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.040
doesn't need any pomp and show.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.080
It is a power within.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:39.280
It is a glow and the light within

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.160
which shows,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.200
automatically.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.599
You don't have to do anything to show it off.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:02.720
Such a person doesn't have any sense of money

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.200
and other things as possessions.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.840
He was bothered about people who were suffering physically,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.400
even the lepers,

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.480
and He tried to cure them,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:33.960
He tried to help so many people who were sick physically,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.760
because at that time,

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.599
there were no hospitals, no doctors.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.399
So His attention was drawn to people

00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:51.920
who were suffering physically.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.520
Also mentally He tried to prepare them.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.520
There are so many beautiful sermons on the mount.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.560
In a way that time, people

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.480
were not so materialistic,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.040
so they listened to Him -

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.080
you can't say how many understood Him.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.200
It's very important

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.320
that if you are not a realized soul,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.480
then it’s difficult

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.080
to understand spirituality.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.160
The one who is talking about spirituality

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.080
and the one who is listening to it,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:53.480
both of them have to have minimum of realization.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.040
So from His beautiful life that I've seen,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.840
we have to learn

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.880
that unless and until we are realized soul,

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:15.640
we will be torturing the spirit of Christ.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.560
We have seen it’s happening, all those who talk of Christ.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.680
He has said it very clearly,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.520
“You'll be calling Me, ‘Christ, Christ,’ I won't recognize you.”

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.880
Very clearly He has said it.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:39.280
I don't know why they didn't remove it from the Bible.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.440
It means those who will talk

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.120
and preach and dress up

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:55.120
to show off that they are spiritual in the name of Christ,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.800
He will not recognize them.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.560
It’s as simple as that.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.840
And this time now when it's the Last Judgment,

00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:13.760
He is going to judge the whole world on the basis

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.360
of spirituality, which means vibrations.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.000
His judgment has already started.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.320
I've seen it.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.320
You can see in so many countries

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.000
things are just disappearing.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.600
All their ego,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.400
all their aggressiveness,

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:50.599
all their cruelties are being challenged.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:58.440
And those who did wrong in the war also

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.680
are taken to task.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.200
So in the history also,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.800
those who have done wrong to any community,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.280
to any people,

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.280
they all will be taken to task.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:22.840
They had no business to be aggressive on people

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.200
and to torture them.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.000
This is what is Shri Ganesha's principle

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.080
acting through Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.040
Christ didn't say that,

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.440
but He did say,

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.960
“There will be Last Judgment.”

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:56.640
On one side He was very kind and compassionate,

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.320
on the other side He was really Shri Ganesha,

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.599
because

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.720
He took a hunter to hit the people

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:14.880
who were selling things in the temple.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.280
You cannot have business in the name of religion.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:26.640
What a big thing it is to understand.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:32.560
But the Christians didn't follow that, they did not.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.240
I don't know where have they gone.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.720
As we have Mahatma Gandhi

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.560
who talked of spirituality and nothing else,

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.760
adhyatma all the time.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.200
But his successors who came

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.240
put him somewhere with his spirituality

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.200
and started a new world, new ideas

00:14:05.599 --> 00:14:08.440
and a new style of life.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.560
Those who are supposed to be His followers

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.000
are now wanting to have many pubs,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.200
and also all kinds of things, can you imagine?

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:27.720
This Congress was started by Mahatma Gandhi,

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.800
and the Congress wallahs are doing all this.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.160
Where are they going to lead?

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.720
The beauty of this country is,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.840
the treasure of this country is spirituality.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.480
Instead of taking to spirituality, where are they going?

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:54.920
They may not be Christians, but they respect Christ,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.440
they respect Bible.

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.880
I must tell you, is a fact, people don't know.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:07.960
They are not Christians means in the sense they are not baptized,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:13.640
but they respect because they understand

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:18.720
that there was so much of spirituality about Christ.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.640
He was the personification of spirituality.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.760
That's the beauty of Indians:

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.760
if somebody is a Hindu or a Muslim, makes no difference.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.040
There were many Muslims who were saints and Sufis in India,

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:44.120
they are all respected by everyone whether they are Muslims or Hindus.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.120
So for Christ,

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.080
nobody has any objection at all.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.120
On the contrary, you saw yesterday how they were all happy about it

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.880
because they are realized souls.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.120
But even if they are not,

00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:08.760
in this country Christ is very much respected.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.520
They can't understand, how can they scrutinize the life of Christ?

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.440
How can they judge Him?

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.400
And how can they make vulgar films about Him?

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.160
This they can't bear it,

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:29.000
because the respect that they have for spirituality

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:35.280
exists very much more than it exists outside.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:41.720
Because in the name of Christ people have done such a lot of wrong,

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:47.480
such a lot of killing has been done.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:53.880
All kinds of wrong things have been accepted.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:59.520
With all this, one doesn't understand

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.360
how they have judged Christ.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.760
For example, what I know in England, I saw, I was shocked

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.440
that if somebody dies, they drink.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.360
If somebody is born, they drink.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.480
Drinking is the only way they have relationships.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.480
“How can you drink?”

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:28.440
I asked them. They said, “Why? Christ created wine.”

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.760
I said, "When?" "In a wedding."

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.480
I said, "In a wedding? That was not wine,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:41.120
that was just the juice of the

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.920
grapes that they grew there."

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:52.640
We call it drakshas in our language.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.760
How can that be wine?

00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:00.920
It has to be first fermented,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.599
it has to be rotten, how can that be?

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:11.360
So this is biggest dharma - to drink.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.360
But in India we know,

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.800
though nobody has said anything against drinking,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.440
but we know drinking is a sinful thing.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.880
You see it everyday,

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.840
everybody knows that if you drink

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.560
you become absolutely out of your mind.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.720
There's nothing to be said

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.120
on a religious platform, but everybody knows

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.120
that what is drinking is.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.520
Not that people abroad don't know, they also know.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.320
But somehow it has become a fashion.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.520
Even in our country it has now been introduced,

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.920
I don't know how after Independence, people have started drinking.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.480
Every party they drink,

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.040
also in the name of Christ on Christmas day.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.360
It's such a insult to His beautiful holy life.

00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:34.600
So, when They came on this earth, perhaps all Their

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.040
powers of holiness were destroyed.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:46.040
The very good thing about Indians is that at least they respect,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:49.880
they respect a holy place.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.880
That is something good about them.

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.160
And they know what is holiness is.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.000
Now of course they are becoming very modern and Americanized.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.920
But still, they know what is wrong,

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.200
what should not be done.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.840
With Sahaja Yoga now I am very happy to say

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:23.440
that the foreign Sahaja Yogis also have become very beautiful.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.600
I'm surprised,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.560
because in their culture there is no spirituality.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.599
But I don't know how they left all that nonsense

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.520
and have come out like lotuses, beautifully,

00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:48.520
with such beautiful fragrance of spirituality.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.360
This is something - a miracle.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.800
Everybody says, “Mother, we can't believe it,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.560
how could have happened ? How did You manage this?”

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.480
I would say it's the blessing of Christ.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.840
They saw how people are

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.680
working out in the name of Christ in a very degraded manner,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.120
and they developed a kind of a awareness

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.200
that definitely something wrong with this,

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.520
this is not Christ.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:38.760
This is not His holy life they are depicting.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.960
It’s something else.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:45.080
And that is how I think in the West

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.400
there's a greater urge,

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:52.480
greater ascending force.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.680
Yesterday somebody came and told Me,

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.680
“Mother, there is no collective meditation.”

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.360
I was very happy to hear that.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.040
What is most important is meditation in Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.760
no doubt about it.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.560
But

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:19.520
the foreigners do meditation much more than Indians do,very surprising.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.599
And foreign men and women are very highly equipped

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.440
I must say, as far as spirituality is concerned.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.480
Especially Russians,

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:36.920
I was surprised that in America,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.880
they told Me, “Mother, these Americans are not Sahaja Yogis.”

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.000
I said, “Why?” “They don't have that respect for You,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.200
they don't meditate.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.720
Those who do not meditate are not Sahaja Yogis.”

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.440
I said. "I agree."

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:03.480
And they make all of them, all the Americans to meditate.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.960
I don't know why in these Eastern Bloc people,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:16.440
Bulgarians and Russians and all these Romanians,

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.720
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so much.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.040
Of course, they had the curse of communism on them.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:33.200
Maybe that they felt that they have missed something in life,

00:23:33.599 --> 00:23:36.840
and they went deep down into themselves,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.599
and that is how they have achieved it.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.440
But I have to tell Indians

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.280
that they have to meditate.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.080
Indians have one or two very bad qualities,

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.360
and that is one of them is groupism.

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.560
For example, if they're Brahmins, they'll sit together;

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.560
if they are Kayasthas, they'll sit together;

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.040
if they are Bhaniyas, they'll sit together.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:12.080
If that is not so, then by another name they'll group together.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:16.760
This is the worst curse of My country,

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.800
because once you start grouping together

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.560
you can never see the good of others

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.360
and you can never see the bad of yourself.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.280
This grouping together can bring lot of problems in this country.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.160
At the time of Christ

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.200
they had very different type of people.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.400
Either they were interested in spirituality,

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.800
or they were not.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.320
Now we have people here who are interested in spirituality,

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:04.040
but still they - one leg is in the water.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.240
Where the age old problems still exist.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.599
And this is the ruin of our country.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.800
We cannot combine together,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.480
we cannot be friends with each other.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.000
Of course not in Sahaja Yoga, I must say,

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.680
it has been solved very well.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.560
But if you see even at the time of Christ,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.760
He had problems with His disciples.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.800
Especially something happened with Peter.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.640
And

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.240
He is the one who says a Satan will meet you.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.680
Because I think people

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.120
fall into the group of satanic forces.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.760
And He said that He removed the satanic

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.000
devils

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.720
from many people and put them in the pigs.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.360
It's true.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.440
There is a satanic force

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.120
which is working very strongly.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.040
The more we develop security of spirituality,

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.320
the more they will develop.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:44.640
The satanic force is in a different form in the West

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.120
and a different form in the East.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.560
But I would like to tell for them

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.480
to be careful

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:02.599
how to find out the satanic forces in the West.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.640
You may not be affected by that

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.280
because you are realized souls,

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.800
but you’ll have to fight it.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.640
You will have to fight it,

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.160
for example racialism.

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:35.800
Racialism is still very powerful there, very, very powerful.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.680
And you have to fight racialism

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.400
through marrying people who belong to other races.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.880
But still I find difficult

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.520
to marry a black person to a white person -

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.240
is an impossible situation.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:01.280
If I try that I don't know what happens.

00:28:01.599 --> 00:28:04.760
Once we had such a marriage, I must tell you.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:12.680
And a white lady, French lady, was married to a black man.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:19.360
Instead of the French lady dominating, this black man dominated.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.599
So I was quite surprised, you know, how could that be?

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:28.000
So, the reason was,

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.480
I think he was taking the revenge maybe, the respite.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.040
So first of all,

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:40.160
tremendous love and affection has to grow

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.400
between

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:46.560
the people.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.400
This color is so skin deep.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:58.040
It has nothing to do with the love inside, nothing.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.440
It's so skin deep.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.840
Thank God in our country,

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.400
you can have a wife

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.400
who will be very dark, husband will be very fair

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:13.400
or the vice-versa.

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.680
But they never look at that from that angle.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.520
I don't think that exists in this country.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.000
But we have another kind, you see,

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:31.800
just is a typical human problem

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.080
is that he discriminates. Through ego,

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.120
which I must say,

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:48.480
Christ has tried to fight your ego.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.920
He was born in a very humble family

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.800
and

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.320
He was not a white-skinned man, no.

00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:05.240
In your language He was brown,

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.480
but in Indian language He was black.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.920
But, when it comes to spirituality,

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.400
you just see

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.600
the enlightened one.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:30.520
You don't see what color they have of the skin.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.520
It's very, very superficial.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.560
But this is one of the enemies of the Western life,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.360
I think, which must be conquered

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.560
Materialism is another one.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:55.480
But the worst of all which is against Christ

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.200
is immorality.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:05.000
Immorality is so much accepted in the West.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:10.320
All kinds of immoral behavior is accepted.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.599
Like, they say that

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.599
all these immoral people say, vote for somebody,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.080
he becomes a president of America.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.640
Then it’s all right, doesn't matter, all kinds of immorality is allowed.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:33.480
But that is absolutely against Christ,

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.960
absolutely.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.960
People don't understand

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.640
that immorality will lead them

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.840
to a kingdom which I don't know what to call because

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.840
it's even worse than animal kingdom.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:04.080
And they are so immoral,

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:08.160
they listen to people like Freud,

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.160
as if they have no brains,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.840
they have no spirit,

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.600
to take note of such a man.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.480
Only after Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.040
model of Christ's life you can have.

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.560
Whatever is past is over and finished.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.200
Today now you are realized souls

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.080
and morality is your strength.

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.400
Forget about the past,

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.920
and I'm sure

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.400
you can get many more people

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.000
under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.520
if you lead a very, very moral life.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.840
At the same time,

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.280
another very bad

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.880
enemy we have is our anger.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.240
So they are very proud, they will say,

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.720
"I'll now get angry.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.480
You know, I'm very angry."

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.200
They are not ashamed about it

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:36.560
and they go on saying that "I'm very angry,"

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.600
as if it's not wrong to say, "I'm very angry."

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.400
Now they say, “I hate you.”

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.480
I mean, imagine any Indian language, if they use this word

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.160
it would be meaning “I'm committing sin.”

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:59.360
So all this aggressiveness comes from anger.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.640
If somebody has to be angry,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.880
he should be angry with himself.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.280
Best is, to get rid of anger,

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.080
you can pull your hair, you can bite yourself,

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:25.400
you can use your pillow to hit yourself.

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:33.240
That may be the best way of taking out your anger.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.720
But see for what are you angry?

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:40.280
Sometimes it’s absolutely useless.

00:34:40.599 --> 00:34:43.640
Sometimes it has no meaning.

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.120
Sometimes

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:51.440
it's absolutely maddening, stupid.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:59.800
But as long as you stop saying, "I'm very angry,"

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.240
that's it.

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:09.760
That's the time you should know you are falling down completely.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.680
So Christ didn't talk of all the subtle things,

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.520
I have been talking to you, because that was left to Me.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.200
Without realization, how can you talk about subtler things?

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.920
You cannot.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.760
Last time I told you about the vibrations,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.920
what is it, what does it stand for

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:43.520
and how you get the subtle energy which we call as tanmatra,

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.960
of our light - tejas,

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.680
of water - jala,

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.160
and prithvi, agni.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:03.640
But, I didn't tell you of one very special one

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:10.720
which is, in English language you call  it ether.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.320
But ether is the energy

00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:20.120
which is managed by another tanmatra, we call it akash.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.320
It's specially today, because it's Christ

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:32.160
who has sacrificed His life to open our Agnya Chakra,

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.160
that we have reached that state of akash.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.480
Without Him it would not have been possible.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.760
We can have general communication.

00:36:48.599 --> 00:36:52.640
Like we can talk to people, we can say things,

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:57.080
we can also use our fingers to express ourselves,

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.080
our hands to communicate.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.440
But,

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.800
to communicate vibrations,

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.040
you have to have vibrations.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.440
Otherwise you cannot feel another person.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.280
But if you are at the Agnya level, means you are mental,

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.960
absolutely mental,

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.800
then your vibrations also are dwindling, in the sense

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.280
you don't know what really they are saying.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:41.560
You can't judge your vibrations, because these vibrations are mental.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.200
They'll say, “Mother, we asked the vibrations.” I said, "Really?"

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.120
If you don't have any vibrations, how can you ask the vibrations?

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:55.120
It's very common thing.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.960
“We ask the vibration; we found from the vibrations.”

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.840
It's not possible because you are just mental.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:13.960
Now what Christ has done is to put you away from the mental level.

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:18.640
That is the most difficult. While I’m surprised,

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.640
those who follow Christianity have the worst mental position.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.000
They are mentally absolutely there,  like,

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:31.760
I don't know what to call, like the fog of Delhi

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.160
that you can't cross.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.680
That’s what was broken was Christ.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.960
How much we should be obliged to Him,

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:52.400
that He removed the greatest hurdle in the human ascent,

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.599
and that one was

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.160
to break this Agnya,

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:04.840
this mental being within us.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.200
We read like mad,

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.920
we listen to people like mad,

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:20.320
we like those who give us feed for our mental being.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.720
They're so mental, so argumentative,

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:28.560
think no end of their intelligence,

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.880
that you have to just say, “All right, namaskar.”

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.040
You can't fight their mental attitude.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.360
That's why Christ

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.680
is to be worshipped

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.720
by people who are so very mental.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:58.280
And this mental nonsense has given

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.760
such a sense of superiority to people.

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.160
“Oh, whatever we do, what's wrong? What's wrong?”

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.200
They cannot correct themselves

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:17.120
because unless and until you cross this limit of mental being,

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:22.360
you cannot see yourself.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.920
You cannot introspect . You cannot see yourself.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.320
You'll see others, “These Sahaja Yogis are like this,

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.760
Sahaja Yoga is like that,” all kinds of things.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:37.480
But you can't see yourself,

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:41.560
because the whole thing is mental.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:50.560
This mental attitude should be completely curbed

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:57.440
through the help of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.560
But He's also mental,

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.440
in your brains Christ is also mental, now what to do?

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:11.440
The One who broke the mental attitude is also a mental -

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:15.880
you have made Him into mental, like a statue

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.320
of stone.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.560
So, firstly we have to tell ourselves,

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.200
“Now don't think, don't think, don't think, don't think.”

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.920
Four times,

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.000
and then you can rise above.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.480
And this is very important.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.520
In meditation you have to go beyond the mind.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:53.160
And thanks to Christ that He’s sitting at the Agnya

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.880
to finish off this nonsense of mental being.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.920
I think people should stop reading also perhaps, maybe.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.560
Even My lecture becomes mental, what to do?

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.160
I mean everything goes into their head becomes mental, somehow.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.040
And then they ask Me questions, “Mother, did You say it this way,

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.720
what did You -” I said, “I said it to make you thoughtless.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.240
Just to stun you,

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:34.160
I didn’t say this to sit down and analyze and do, no, no.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:41.599
I said this that you become absolutely shocked and stunned.”

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:49.920
So the best thing for all of you is

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.080
to become thoughtless.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.560
That’s the blessing of Christ,

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.400
that’s what He worked it out for you.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.480
And I am sure,

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:10.240
if you work it out that don’t pay attention to others.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.400
Don’t react,

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.680
just don’t react.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.200
Everything they will see, they’ll react.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.480
What is the need?

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.760
What is the use?

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.680
What are you going to do with that reaction?

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.920
This reaction creates nothing but ripples of thoughts

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.480
in your mind, I’ve told you hundreds of times.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.680
And now you have to become

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.560
absolutely thoughtless

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:55.880
after this puja.

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:01.360
If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:06.360
That’s the biggest blessing that Christ has given you,

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:10.560
which you should really enjoy.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:17.560
Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.200
And how it works?

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.120
Through your attention,

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.599
it works with Me as you know.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.640
With My attention I work out many things.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.600
How?

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:40.120
Just My attention has become thoughtless,

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.440
just thoughtless.

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.840
It goes wherever it goes, it works.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.000
But if you put your attention for thought all the time

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.960
for thinking,

00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:00.400
then it doesn’t do the work that it has supposed to do.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.640
Attention works marvelously

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.240
if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn’t.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:19.840
So it has to rise from your own self.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.400
Then from others

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.400
to the higher level of humanity,

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.480
where you are in communication with the sky,

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:35.520
with, we can call it as the

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.640
tanmatra, or the essential, or the essence

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.840
of ether.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.120
With ether you can have television, you can have telephone.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.440
It's a miracle otherwise.

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:55.680
But with this tanmatra,

00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.200
sitting down here

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:01.599
you can do the job.

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.200
It works,

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.680
just attention works. I know that.

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.760
You also know very well.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.440
You don't have to ask Me to put the attention,

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.160
you just put the attention and it will work out.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:22.480
It’s a very important thing that you have got.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.560
I think that is the first thing -

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.200
once you have,

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.000
no problem.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:39.240
But we start manifesting from the earth element.

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:45.200
Then from the agni element, then from the jala element,

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:50.000
and then we come to tejas,

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:54.400
where the face starts shining.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:59.640
But lastly we get this thoughtless awareness

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:05.320
by which our attention is absolutely free to do

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.800
some special work.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.240
But if you are all the time thinking,

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.680
then poor this attention

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.920
is so busy, you know, so very busy.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.320
You don't have to ask Me then,

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:26.599
"Mother, please pay attention." You can pay attention,

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.440
and you can work it out.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:39.800
In this attention, you don't feel

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.200
what you've got, what you are standing,

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:49.920
what you are wearing, what others are doing - no, nothing.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.200
You are one with yourself.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:48:00.160
And it's a life full of humor.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.040
So much humor.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.600
So much of joy.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.720
So much of happiness

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
that you don't care for anything

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.320
that normally people care for.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.600
So,

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:29.280
as it is now Sahaja Yoga has worked in so many countries.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.080
I'm so very proud of you, very proud.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:37.120
And now it is also going to African countries,

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:41.600
is a very great satisfaction for Me.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.200
And you all can do it;

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:50.120
you all can work it out.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:55.240
Only thing, become thoughtlessly aware,

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.680
as the blessing of Christ.

00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.080
If it works,

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:06.800
you will be absolutely enjoying yourself.

00:49:07.625 --> 00:49:10.625
So may God bless you.

00:49:25.673 --> 00:49:30.751
The fact is that this English language has been imposed on us

00:49:32.876 --> 00:49:36.124
for the past three hundred years.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:39.485
I have never studied the English language.

00:49:39.749 --> 00:49:41.935
Never!

00:49:42.194 --> 00:49:45.589
Even in school there was a small book,

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:50.477
and in the Medical College, no one taught English as a language.

00:49:51.282 --> 00:49:52.702
My father used to say,

00:49:52.903 --> 00:49:57.200
“It is such an easy language and there are so few words in it,

00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:00.162
that there is no need to study it.”

00:50:00.806 --> 00:50:04.430
And he admitted us into a Marathi medium school.

00:50:04.663 --> 00:50:09.452
And he used to advise us, "Learn Marathi and Sanskrit language".

00:50:10.242 --> 00:50:14.088
So I did not study Sanskrit language

00:50:15.274 --> 00:50:19.095
and as for Hindi, I never ever studied Hindi language.

00:50:21.384 --> 00:50:23.995
No question about that!

00:50:24.196 --> 00:50:27.245
Didn't learn in school or in college

00:50:27.446 --> 00:50:30.948
Didn't learn hindi language anywhere!

00:50:31.702 --> 00:50:36.239
But there is one good quality in Me, which I must tell you about,

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:41.121
that whenever I speak in Hindi, I can speak only in Hindi;

00:50:41.322 --> 00:50:44.493
and when I speak Marathi I can speak only in Marathi language,

00:50:44.694 --> 00:50:48.033
and when I speak in English, I can speak only English.

00:50:48.234 --> 00:50:52.237
It is very difficult for Me to translate from one to the other.

00:50:53.496 --> 00:50:56.855
That is why I cannot mix them up.

00:50:57.359 --> 00:51:01.288
Each of these three languages is different from the others.

00:51:01.647 --> 00:51:03.765
Now no one will believe

00:51:03.966 --> 00:51:07.688
that I have not studied Hindi language.

00:51:08.433 --> 00:51:11.414
But because of My interest in reading,

00:51:11.615 --> 00:51:15.038
interest in reading good Hindi books,

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:19.642
I learnt the Hindi language.

00:51:20.352 --> 00:51:22.693
But in the beginning My Hindi speaking

00:51:22.894 --> 00:51:27.584
had a lot of words and influence from Sanskrit.

00:51:28.742 --> 00:51:31.276
Because Maharastrians speak like that only.

00:51:31.477 --> 00:51:35.105
They don't know day-to-day Hindi language.

00:51:35.306 --> 00:51:37.796
When they speak Hindi

00:51:37.997 --> 00:51:41.999
more than half of the words will be Sanskrit

00:51:42.234 --> 00:51:45.586
and the rest will be Marathi.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.973
You understand? This is the condition.

00:51:56.202 --> 00:52:02.686
What I have understood from all this is,

00:52:04.298 --> 00:52:07.489
that even language comes as a gift of God.

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:11.430
Like you have a gift in music and arts,

00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:14.327
in the same way, aptitude for languages is also a blessing.

00:52:14.528 --> 00:52:19.214
And by that, one can master many languages.

00:52:20.822 --> 00:52:25.943
But the Hindi speaking people cannot learn any other language.

00:52:27.655 --> 00:52:30.424
The reason for this is - for example the English people also,

00:52:31.122 --> 00:52:33.600
they cannot learn any other language.

00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:36.918
And even if they learn it, they will not be fluent.

00:52:37.301 --> 00:52:40.870
The reason is that everyone can speak English,

00:52:41.071 --> 00:52:44.739
so there is no interest for them in learning any other language.

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:48.994
Now the Hindi speaking people have this problem

00:52:50.242 --> 00:52:53.136
that they just cannot speak any other language.

00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:56.166
I will never insist that you must learn Marathi,

00:52:56.367 --> 00:53:00.749
because Marathi language is very complicated.

00:53:01.513 --> 00:53:03.208
It's very difficult.

00:53:03.409 --> 00:53:06.009
Only Maharashtrians can understand it.

00:53:06.339 --> 00:53:09.583
And it has so much merriment

00:53:10.322 --> 00:53:11.819
and so many jokes.

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:14.924
There is nothing indecent in that language.

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:17.637
There is not even a bit of filth or indecency in it.

00:53:17.838 --> 00:53:23.374
It is such a profound and expressive language

00:53:24.377 --> 00:53:27.070
that for Sahaja Yoga there is no other language

00:53:27.271 --> 00:53:29.612
that is more appropriate than Marathi.

00:53:29.813 --> 00:53:33.176
Because only in Marathi a description of  Kundalini was written.

00:53:33.377 --> 00:53:35.625
Whatever has been written by saints and sages,

00:53:35.808 --> 00:53:38.617
has been written in Marathi language.

00:53:39.465 --> 00:53:42.859
And if you learn Marathi, you can learn any other language.

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.160
There is no doubt in this.

00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:49.168
But Maharashtrians will not learn any other language.

00:53:50.012 --> 00:53:52.976
They are very obstinate.

00:53:55.941 --> 00:53:59.898
I asked someone, “Just read this Hindi book”.

00:54:00.099 --> 00:54:02.431
He read a little bit, and put it down.

00:54:02.632 --> 00:54:06.644
I asked him: “Why?” and he said, “It is full of rubbish!

00:54:07.543 --> 00:54:10.456
Only nonsense is written, I don’t want to read it!”

00:54:10.657 --> 00:54:13.698
Because Marathi is such a clean language

00:54:13.899 --> 00:54:16.541
with such pure thoughts,

00:54:16.742 --> 00:54:19.321
that after reading... After reading Gita,

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:23.572
you cannot read wayside books of dirt and filth.

00:54:23.949 --> 00:54:26.976
You will not understand them!

00:54:27.551 --> 00:54:31.845
So if some of you start learning Marathi, it will be a good thing.

00:54:32.378 --> 00:54:34.502
But it is a very difficult language to master

00:54:34.703 --> 00:54:37.875
There are a lot of synonyms in Marathi language.

00:54:38.076 --> 00:54:40.746
The reason I am telling you this today

00:54:40.947 --> 00:54:45.879
is that even after coming to Maharashtra I have to speak in Hindi,

00:54:46.151 --> 00:54:49.136
because you do not understand Marathi.

00:54:49.337 --> 00:54:52.449
In Pune I speak in Marathi only.

00:54:53.417 --> 00:54:56.577
But in Mumbai I have to speak in Hindi.

00:54:58.161 --> 00:55:01.248
So those who like to learn languages,

00:55:01.449 --> 00:55:04.246
should learn Marathi.

00:55:05.003 --> 00:55:07.652
It is a language to learn.

00:55:07.853 --> 00:55:10.708
And it is such a wonderful language

00:55:10.909 --> 00:55:14.570
that our Namdeva

00:55:15.277 --> 00:55:21.081
who was a saint, a very big, a very great saint,

00:55:22.798 --> 00:55:27.113
was called by Guru Nanak

00:55:28.210 --> 00:55:32.533
and told to learn Punjabi language

00:55:32.734 --> 00:55:34.773
and write his poetry in Punjabi.

00:55:35.012 --> 00:55:38.224
And Namdevji wrote such a thick book, in Punjabi language.

00:55:38.425 --> 00:55:41.216
I too was able to speak in Punjabi when I lived in Punjab.

00:55:41.417 --> 00:55:43.448
If you can learn Marathi,

00:55:43.687 --> 00:55:48.097
then, except Tamil language, you can learn any other language.

00:55:50.274 --> 00:55:54.263
Maybe you will be able to learn a few Tamil words

00:55:55.483 --> 00:55:59.928
It's such a  situation, that in this country

00:56:00.129 --> 00:56:04.367
there are fourteen official languages -

00:56:05.369 --> 00:56:07.773
we have, you will be surprised,

00:56:07.974 --> 00:56:12.188
fourteen official languages in this country.

00:56:15.853 --> 00:56:19.786
So I will say this that if you learn Marathi,

00:56:20.423 --> 00:56:26.379
you will manage to learn at least 8-9 of these fourteen languages.

00:56:31.638 --> 00:56:35.722
Now one more thing which is wonderful!

00:56:35.923 --> 00:56:39.973
The Bible has been translated,

00:56:40.174 --> 00:56:43.494
directly from Hebrew language

00:56:43.695 --> 00:56:48.174
directly in purity,

00:56:49.123 --> 00:56:52.466
in Marathi language.

00:56:53.528 --> 00:56:56.544
In this area, there was a lady called Rama Devi,

00:56:56.745 --> 00:56:58.589
very intelligent and noble.

00:56:58.892 --> 00:57:02.561
All the writings in the Bible,

00:57:03.983 --> 00:57:07.160
she made a translation of them - of all the Bible writings -

00:57:07.361 --> 00:57:10.322
and she did it in Marathi language.

00:57:11.503 --> 00:57:15.462
In that she has used Marathi names,

00:57:15.663 --> 00:57:19.721
like for John she has used the name Yohan,

00:57:20.544 --> 00:57:23.636
and for Matthews she has used Matthai.

00:57:23.837 --> 00:57:27.749
So the Bible that I have read was in Marathi,

00:57:28.201 --> 00:57:31.414
and that is why, many times there is confusion.

00:57:31.885 --> 00:57:34.977
She has written everything very clearly and distinctly

00:57:35.178 --> 00:57:39.184
and she has written it in all its purity.

00:57:39.385 --> 00:57:42.448
And she has written in it

00:57:42.649 --> 00:57:46.092
that when Christ went to a wedding

00:57:46.293 --> 00:57:53.483
He transformed water into the juice of grapes.

00:57:54.829 --> 00:57:57.573
This is a fundamental point

00:57:57.932 --> 00:58:00.424
that she has written in Marathi.

00:58:00.625 --> 00:58:05.016
The second amazing thing is that

00:58:06.352 --> 00:58:09.636
about the childhood of Christ

00:58:09.837 --> 00:58:12.795
and about boyhood of Christ

00:58:12.996 --> 00:58:16.430
I have not read any poem in English language.

00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:22.202
I don’t know, have you ever heard

00:58:23.273 --> 00:58:25.913
a poetry piece

00:58:26.114 --> 00:58:31.329
about the description of Christ’s childhood?

00:58:33.988 --> 00:58:36.347
I have never heard one.

00:58:36.548 --> 00:58:39.750
But in Marathi we have many.

00:58:39.951 --> 00:58:43.278
Now, just yesterday they sang beautifully,

00:58:43.479 --> 00:58:47.264
"Baala vadana tava baghuni Krista".

00:58:48.163 --> 00:58:50.517
After seeing your small child's face -

00:58:50.718 --> 00:58:53.281
after seeing your face,

00:58:54.107 --> 00:58:58.971
your child like face - "Baal Vadana" -

00:58:59.765 --> 00:59:02.570
all my fears run away.

00:59:04.119 --> 00:59:08.186
So all this part is missing in the Western languages.

00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:14.350
I think that the childhood themes are not there.

00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:17.440
We have about Krishna, about Rama,

00:59:17.641 --> 00:59:20.280
when they were children, how they used to walk,

00:59:20.481 --> 00:59:22.128
how they used to talk,

00:59:22.329 --> 00:59:24.708
how they used to put their finger in the mouth.

00:59:24.909 --> 00:59:26.250
Every little, little thing

00:59:26.417 --> 00:59:29.647
is described so beautifully about children.

00:59:30.545 --> 00:59:32.168
And that is how I think,

00:59:32.369 --> 00:59:34.998
Indians cannot think of killing their children at all.

00:59:35.199 --> 00:59:38.194
I mean it's an impossible situation.

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:42.581
Even in Hindi language, in Marathi language,

00:59:42.782 --> 00:59:46.041
we have such beautiful descriptions

00:59:46.242 --> 00:59:49.260
of these incarnations as children.

00:59:50.352 --> 00:59:53.255
Then the third thing,

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:55.359
which is surprising,

00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:59.081
is that all their romance is before the marriage.

00:59:59.448 --> 01:00:02.953
After marriage there is no romance left!

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:07.493
Third thing is that

01:00:07.694 --> 01:00:14.218
there is no romance described after marriage. All before marriage.

01:00:14.869 --> 01:00:18.875
It is the other way around in Indian languages:

01:00:19.171 --> 01:00:22.056
all the romance comes when you are married -

01:00:22.257 --> 01:00:24.765
- very sweet, sweet things.

01:00:26.416 --> 01:00:30.670
I was surprised - I asked somebody to find out one English book

01:00:30.871 --> 01:00:33.967
where they have described the romance

01:00:34.371 --> 01:00:35.794
of the married couple.

01:00:36.547 --> 01:00:38.183
None!

01:00:38.461 --> 01:00:39.978
Finished!

01:00:40.306 --> 01:00:44.281
All the romance is over. Once you are married it is finished.

01:00:46.001 --> 01:00:47.188
Then what do you do?

01:00:47.389 --> 01:00:51.742
You quarrel, you fight, you go to the courts, take a divorce.

01:00:58.885 --> 01:01:02.005
That description is not there.

01:01:03.233 --> 01:01:04.918
And this is the significant thing

01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:07.194
that on us (Indians)

01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:14.988
there is a very big blessing of our Indian culture, very big!

01:01:24.963 --> 01:01:28.637
Please, remove that.

01:01:30.057 --> 01:01:33.008
Someone can come and remove it.

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:50.986
So I have read the translation of the Bible in Marathi.

01:01:52.828 --> 01:01:55.820
And whatever is written there,

01:01:56.021 --> 01:02:00.125
has great depth.

01:02:01.242 --> 01:02:06.056
I feel that English language has changed its essential nature.

01:02:06.312 --> 01:02:08.541
And even with regard to Christ,

01:02:08.742 --> 01:02:13.465
His sacred identity and spiritual significance

01:02:13.666 --> 01:02:17.735
has been preserved in the Marathi Bible.

01:02:18.533 --> 01:02:20.461
This is not there in the Hindi translation,

01:02:20.671 --> 01:02:23.462
nor is it there in the English version.

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:28.213
The third thing is

01:02:28.414 --> 01:02:32.022
that the Maharashtrians have high self esteem.

01:02:32.599 --> 01:02:36.946
In Rajasthan also, the people from Mewar are very self esteemed.

01:02:37.147 --> 01:02:40.574
They would not learn anything from the British.

01:02:42.141 --> 01:02:43.575
If the English tried to teach them

01:02:43.776 --> 01:02:46.566
they would say, “Leave it. No need.

01:02:47.171 --> 01:02:50.100
We have seen many like you”.

01:02:52.232 --> 01:02:54.051
But in the North of India I have seen that

01:02:54.252 --> 01:02:57.509
they are greatly impressed by the English.

01:02:58.044 --> 01:02:59.373
Wearing good suits,

01:02:59.574 --> 01:03:01.464
wearing ties, boots,

01:03:01.685 --> 01:03:04.087
commanding and ordering others.

01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:05.888
It's not so in Maharashtra.

01:03:06.864 --> 01:03:11.429
To get a Maharashtrian wear a suit is the most difficult thing!

01:03:17.007 --> 01:03:19.991
They wear dhotis.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.669
Even educated people wear only dhotis.

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:24.691
You can see that Tilak,

01:03:24.892 --> 01:03:26.977
who was such a great leader in the country,

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:29.293
or we had Ranade (great leader)

01:03:29.494 --> 01:03:31.579
or Agarkar(great leader), all of them -

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.367
no one wore suits and boots.

01:03:35.007 --> 01:03:37.602
No one used to wear tie or anything.

01:03:38.546 --> 01:03:42.474
Of course, if they are in government jobs, that is a different matter.

01:03:42.779 --> 01:03:45.077
But here, even to be employed in a government job

01:03:45.278 --> 01:03:47.868
was considered below ones' dignity and status.

01:03:48.132 --> 01:03:50.414
In Maharashtra, you must be knowing,

01:03:50.615 --> 01:03:53.361
that many times it has been written,

01:03:53.562 --> 01:03:55.853
it has been written many times,

01:03:56.054 --> 01:03:59.562
“Why don't you take a government job?”.

01:04:00.779 --> 01:04:04.208
And they would mention three-four names of government officials

01:04:04.409 --> 01:04:06.816
as an example that they were doing well.

01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:09.901
But there is no honor and glory in a government job.

01:04:10.102 --> 01:04:11.885
Not at all!

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:16.392
My father used to say

01:04:16.593 --> 01:04:20.435
that working for someone was inferior.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:23.976
Better to have your own profession.

01:04:24.177 --> 01:04:29.546
And a government job is the lowest form of employment.

01:04:31.682 --> 01:04:34.299
It destroys a person’s character.

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:39.107
And I've seen this is very true.

01:04:39.578 --> 01:04:43.809
Now, if someone gets into the IAS (Indian Administrative Service),

01:04:44.925 --> 01:04:48.966
then finished. His value goes up in the marriage market -

01:04:49.167 --> 01:04:52.465
30 lakhs, 35 lakhs.

01:04:55.449 --> 01:04:59.672
An IAS Officer in North India is considered a big man.

01:04:59.873 --> 01:05:01.652
Here it's not so.

01:05:01.947 --> 01:05:05.768
But here, if a man is educated, if he is a scholar,

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:08.296
then he is appreciated;

01:05:08.497 --> 01:05:11.016
and most of all if he is spiritually sound.

01:05:11.243 --> 01:05:13.769
This is a very great difference.

01:05:14.045 --> 01:05:16.992
And that is why in the early days in Delhi,

01:05:17.193 --> 01:05:20.882
I used to wonder what will these people understand?

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:25.052
But it is most amazing,

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.614
that in Delhi,

01:05:27.815 --> 01:05:31.025
Sahaja Yoga has spread so wide; in Lucknow also.

01:05:31.226 --> 01:05:34.415
I just cannot believe!

01:05:37.543 --> 01:05:40.483
With whose blessings has it happened?

01:05:40.897 --> 01:05:44.381
These people were so badly servile to the British.

01:05:44.582 --> 01:05:48.406
What has happened to them now?

01:05:49.049 --> 01:05:52.031
How did they get transformed?

01:05:52.232 --> 01:05:56.988
I feel that where Shri Rama and Shri Krishna,

01:05:58.158 --> 01:06:02.666
made their divine abodes,

01:06:02.867 --> 01:06:04.951
there reside their blessings.

01:06:05.318 --> 01:06:07.707
There is no other explanation.

01:06:07.936 --> 01:06:10.282
Especially Lucknow, which was a place of indulgence

01:06:10.483 --> 01:06:12.521
– eat, drink and have fun -

01:06:13.372 --> 01:06:16.400
they were all indulgent and carefree...

01:06:17.346 --> 01:06:20.742
I always hesitated as I did not know what to talk to such people.

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:25.083
All their relationships, discussions, I just couldn’t understand.

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:29.262
I was coming from Maharashtra and just couldn't understand their way of life.

01:06:29.463 --> 01:06:33.736
Making fun of daughter-in-law or making fun of sister-in-law,

01:06:33.937 --> 01:06:36.717
it never made sense to me!

01:06:38.091 --> 01:06:40.679
And now I perceive there

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.639
the blessings of Shri Rama and Shri Krishna,

01:06:46.153 --> 01:06:48.619
the poetry of Kabir,

01:06:49.523 --> 01:06:51.370
the blessings of Nanak Sahib.

01:06:51.571 --> 01:06:53.085
Oh! These people of Punjab -

01:06:53.286 --> 01:06:54.805
I studied in Punjab,

01:06:54.925 --> 01:06:58.485
and I felt that in the brains of these people of Punjab,

01:06:58.686 --> 01:07:01.400
Sahaja Yoga will never enter!

01:07:01.803 --> 01:07:04.053
And now I was amazed!

01:07:04.365 --> 01:07:06.077
I am very amazed!

01:07:06.278 --> 01:07:08.428
So much bhakti

01:07:08.796 --> 01:07:11.391
and so much bliss and joy.

01:07:11.592 --> 01:07:14.324
How did they attain this?

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:18.074
There were no big public programs there,

01:07:18.275 --> 01:07:21.357
nor did anyone give big lectures.

01:07:22.397 --> 01:07:24.520
How did all this happen?

01:07:24.721 --> 01:07:28.167
Now in Maharashtra I really worked hard

01:07:29.165 --> 01:07:32.178
Oh my God! So many villages and hamlets

01:07:32.379 --> 01:07:35.422
I visited and worked very hard.

01:07:36.929 --> 01:07:40.272
But in Maharashtra it did not spread so much.

01:07:40.651 --> 01:07:43.778
The quality I found in North India

01:07:43.979 --> 01:07:46.376
it is not in Maharashtra.

01:07:47.633 --> 01:07:49.289
It is really surprising.

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:53.051
I thought, all My efforts in Maharashtra will go in vain.

01:07:53.252 --> 01:07:56.377
On the contrary they got after Me!

01:07:57.791 --> 01:08:00.885
So, I discovered one thing,

01:08:01.329 --> 01:08:04.427
that there are a lot of false gurus there!

01:08:05.287 --> 01:08:08.933
So many gurus! Everyone has a personal guru;

01:08:09.134 --> 01:08:11.053
each home has a guru;

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:13.603
It was overrun with gurus!

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:15.371
Even in the Panchaang (astrological calendar)

01:08:15.572 --> 01:08:17.831
even there, every guru’s name,

01:08:18.032 --> 01:08:20.528
date of birth, place etc. is recorded! Oh My God -

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:24.193
all completely useless people.

01:08:27.239 --> 01:08:29.421
Of course there were a few genuine gurus also

01:08:29.622 --> 01:08:31.440
but very few.

01:08:31.897 --> 01:08:33.472
Very few.

01:08:33.673 --> 01:08:36.244
The others, such useless gurus,

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:38.249
are either interested in money

01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:41.243
or interested in women!

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:46.670
This large land of Maharashtra, such a sacred land,

01:08:46.871 --> 01:08:49.063
has been

01:08:49.806 --> 01:08:52.325
blessed by the different aspects of the Devi

01:08:52.526 --> 01:08:55.852
Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali

01:08:56.512 --> 01:08:57.763
and Adi Shakti -

01:08:57.964 --> 01:09:00.295
all of them have place in this Mahashtra.

01:09:00.496 --> 01:09:02.888
And the eight Vinayakas and Mahavinayaka,

01:09:03.089 --> 01:09:04.878
are all sitting here.

01:09:05.079 --> 01:09:06.974
One thing is that these people are not immoral,

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.788
they have no dirty thoughts,

01:09:08.989 --> 01:09:13.737
but they have no capability

01:09:14.575 --> 01:09:17.116
to understand what is dharma,

01:09:17.671 --> 01:09:20.264
They don't have the capacity.

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.729
They only know

01:09:23.992 --> 01:09:26.811
going to the temples, ringing the bells

01:09:27.012 --> 01:09:29.823
and running after gurus for salvation.

01:09:30.473 --> 01:09:35.107
They are too much ritualistic people.

01:09:35.725 --> 01:09:38.319
There is no other problem of immorality with them.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.040
But they are so steeped in ritualism

01:09:40.241 --> 01:09:43.357
that they are not able to come out of all these habits.

01:09:43.558 --> 01:09:47.988
I have given you the analysis of the situation, this way.

01:09:48.295 --> 01:09:52.281
The foreigners

01:09:52.482 --> 01:09:54.959
from whom I had no expectations whatsoever -

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.317
I used to feel what kind of people are these,

01:09:58.518 --> 01:10:01.678
they have no understanding of anything -

01:10:02.169 --> 01:10:04.688
and they have reached such heights.

01:10:04.889 --> 01:10:07.465
And the people of the North whom I never thought

01:10:07.666 --> 01:10:09.885
that they would come to Sahaja Yoga...

01:10:10.086 --> 01:10:13.376
I used to call Dilli(Delhi) as Billi(cat).

01:10:15.932 --> 01:10:18.204
My marriage took place in Delhi.

01:10:18.405 --> 01:10:20.913
My father also lived in Delhi.

01:10:21.678 --> 01:10:23.411
I had no hopes from North India.

01:10:23.612 --> 01:10:26.511
But, it is a very surprizing thing

01:10:26.738 --> 01:10:28.775
that today in Delhi

01:10:28.976 --> 01:10:31.465
and further North of Delhi,

01:10:31.666 --> 01:10:35.698
in Punjab,  in  U.P., all over,

01:10:35.899 --> 01:10:37.610
in Rajasthan,

01:10:37.793 --> 01:10:40.039
Sahaja Yoga has spread.

01:10:41.885 --> 01:10:44.779
But Maharashtra it is a misfortune.

01:10:44.980 --> 01:10:47.422
And because of it,

01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:50.036
your coming here is very important.

01:10:50.237 --> 01:10:52.784
Because of your chaitanya,

01:10:52.985 --> 01:10:56.251
a lot of awakening can take place here

01:10:56.483 --> 01:10:59.179
and people can feel it.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.835
By your coming here, your attention also comes to this place,

01:11:03.036 --> 01:11:06.158
and by that, in Mahashtra

01:11:06.359 --> 01:11:10.115
all the false gurus settled here - there are lots of them still...

01:11:10.316 --> 01:11:13.969
In Maharashtra there is a saying “Ucchal Bangdi Karle”.

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:18.336
I cannot tell you the translation of this.

01:11:20.181 --> 01:11:22.646
The job of picking and throwing them out

01:11:22.847 --> 01:11:25.266
can be achieved only through your Chaitanya.

01:11:25.467 --> 01:11:28.796
Especially today, when

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:36.225
you are worshiping the pure personality of Christ,

01:11:37.007 --> 01:11:41.449
His purest life,

01:11:41.981 --> 01:11:44.209
you are offering respect to Him,

01:11:44.599 --> 01:11:46.934
I would definitely say that,

01:11:47.148 --> 01:11:49.454
that all these

01:11:49.655 --> 01:11:52.913
so many false gurus settled here -

01:11:53.114 --> 01:11:57.592
which Christ, if He was here, He would have whipped them with a hunter -

01:11:58.382 --> 01:12:03.588
all such false gurus

01:12:04.168 --> 01:12:08.325
would be compelled to pick up their wares and run away!

01:12:10.701 --> 01:12:14.895
And after running away, I don't know where they will go.

01:12:15.096 --> 01:12:16.889
They have made a lot of money,

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:18.780
and befooled many people.

01:12:18.981 --> 01:12:22.383
But there is also a kind of narrow-mindedness,

01:12:23.649 --> 01:12:29.391
a kind of foolishness in people here.

01:12:30.906 --> 01:12:33.882
Any guru comes they will prostate at his feet.

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:37.424
There are a lot of "feet touching" devotees here!

01:12:39.147 --> 01:12:43.156
So this is one thing inside us:

01:12:44.162 --> 01:12:47.089
the capacity to get befouled!

01:12:47.456 --> 01:12:50.796
I don't know from where it has come.

01:12:51.327 --> 01:12:53.787
Whoever comes and teaches anything,

01:12:53.988 --> 01:12:58.098
its our heritage: "Gurudev has come!".

01:13:05.835 --> 01:13:08.644
It is due to this blind following

01:13:08.845 --> 01:13:11.546
that the spiritual culture of Maharashtra has been destroyed.

01:13:11.747 --> 01:13:13.047
And I would say that,

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.840
today when you are worshipping the life of Christ,

01:13:16.041 --> 01:13:17.918
His simplicity,

01:13:18.101 --> 01:13:20.322
His purity,

01:13:20.658 --> 01:13:24.725
the weapon of His innocence,

01:13:25.051 --> 01:13:27.016
the power of Shri Ganesha,

01:13:27.217 --> 01:13:29.894
will definitely destroy these people,

01:13:30.304 --> 01:13:34.150
and in Maharashtra the spiritual awakening will take place as well.

01:13:34.448 --> 01:13:36.776
Here also the people will achieve

01:13:36.977 --> 01:13:41.335
that spiritual treasure and Param Tattwa (Divine essence)

01:13:41.536 --> 01:13:45.621
which existed in so many saints here.

01:13:46.017 --> 01:13:50.646
There was no saint who did not mention about Kundalini.

01:13:50.847 --> 01:13:55.239
All the saints here talked about Kundalini.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:14:00.671
Saints, one greater than the other lived in this land.

01:14:02.242 --> 01:14:06.433
I think about those saints in this country,

01:14:06.634 --> 01:14:11.165
who have worked so hard here,

01:14:11.366 --> 01:14:14.038
and tried to awaken spirituality.

01:14:14.411 --> 01:14:17.322
Here, even I could not succeed.

01:14:18.281 --> 01:14:22.291
But I congratulate you for coming here.

01:14:22.921 --> 01:14:27.795
Your coming here will definitely put sense into these people.

01:14:28.071 --> 01:14:29.744
They will realise that

01:14:29.945 --> 01:14:33.056
they are just running after false gurus.

01:14:33.879 --> 01:14:38.276
I am telling you all this

01:14:38.632 --> 01:14:40.962
because many people suggested that, "Mother,

01:14:41.163 --> 01:14:43.177
instead of Ganapatiphule,

01:14:43.378 --> 01:14:46.863
You should have your program in our place".

01:14:48.071 --> 01:14:51.433
But I said “No! You come here!"

01:14:51.825 --> 01:14:54.651
Because it is your duty

01:14:55.496 --> 01:14:59.300
that you bring about awakening within everybody.

01:14:59.986 --> 01:15:03.083
Spiritual awakening in Maharashtra is imperative.

01:15:03.284 --> 01:15:06.808
So it is necesary for you to come here.

01:15:07.548 --> 01:15:10.448
And that too, here (Ganapatipule) -

01:15:10.649 --> 01:15:14.994
the place of Shri Jesus Christ - we honor it by our coming.

01:15:15.948 --> 01:15:18.506
He is very important here.

01:15:19.213 --> 01:15:24.207
I tell you., He will take the whip to whip all these false gurus

01:15:24.408 --> 01:15:27.093
and finish them off.

01:15:27.294 --> 01:15:30.244
But you must know

01:15:31.378 --> 01:15:36.720
that today we are here to worship and awaken

01:15:37.181 --> 01:15:39.132
His supreme divinity.

01:15:39.333 --> 01:15:42.312
And with His power,

01:15:42.527 --> 01:15:46.477
Maharashtra will become purified and holy.

01:15:46.678 --> 01:15:50.298
They do a lot of worshipping of Ganesha,

01:15:50.905 --> 01:15:52.689
they worship Ganesha a lot.

01:15:52.890 --> 01:15:54.725
But who is Shri Ganesha,

01:15:54.916 --> 01:15:58.307
what does He stand for - all this they do not know.

01:16:00.382 --> 01:16:01.888
I don’t understand this.

01:16:02.089 --> 01:16:04.195
They are so entangled in this mess;

01:16:04.396 --> 01:16:08.607
and to release them it is necessary for you to come here.

01:16:08.808 --> 01:16:10.724
To come every year,

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.704
and worship and celebrate the birthday of Christ

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.896
is a great undertaking.

01:16:21.763 --> 01:16:25.476
My unending blessings to all of you.
