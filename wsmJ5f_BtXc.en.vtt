01:04:28.891 --> 01:04:33.661
There is a divorce possible, both for the husband, also for wife.

01:04:33.798 --> 01:04:36.588
But that's very very rare, extremely rare,

01:04:36.708 --> 01:04:39.208
so far I have seen is very rare.

01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:48.270
So one should marry with a very open heart
because you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:56.720
Is no other binding force for you but your
love and affection and care for each other.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:04.210
Now as you have got a bride and you have got
a husband I will tell you one thing that Sahaja

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:15.240
Yoga will grow much more now because of you
being there as couples who follow Sahaja Yoga,

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:19.920
and who will have children of very great spiritual
character.

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.600
There are many saints who want to be born
on this Earth.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:30.799
All these saints will be born to you, because
you are Sahaja Yogis and you are at a level

01:05:30.799 --> 01:05:39.049
of that great consciousness which we call
as Atma Sakshatkar (Self-realisation).

01:05:39.099 --> 01:05:43.089
Or they call it (Bali?) in their language, (Bali?)

01:05:43.169 --> 01:05:46.559
or (?) all these words are there

01:05:46.579 --> 01:05:48.722
depending on the quality.

01:05:48.749 --> 01:05:53.309
So, with this idea you are doing a great work,

01:05:53.802 --> 01:05:57.872
great thing to allow these great souls to come on this Earth,

01:05:58.032 --> 01:06:02.792
but your life also should be absolutely clean, Nirmala.

01:06:02.842 --> 01:06:07.439
Try to be very kind to each other and nice to each other,

01:06:07.504 --> 01:06:11.279
is very easy in Sahaja Yoga, because

01:06:11.779 --> 01:06:14.665
as you know that everything that you think,

01:06:14.705 --> 01:06:20.016
everything that you do is all Sahaja.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:24.886
So there is no question of any problems coming in.

01:06:26.068 --> 01:06:34.668
I wish you all very great love, prosperity
and joy and that you all develop in Sahaja

01:06:34.668 --> 01:06:41.368
Yoga in a very great love and understanding;
forgetting what is what was your past what

01:06:41.368 --> 01:06:48.759
was your religion, what was your caste, what
was your country.

01:06:48.798 --> 01:06:50.179
Forget everything!

01:06:50.179 --> 01:06:56.707
We are all really human beings and now we
are realised souls so there is no difference

01:06:56.707 --> 01:06:57.918
like this.

01:06:57.918 --> 01:07:03.777
And all of you should prosper in such a manner
that other people should see you and try to

01:07:03.777 --> 01:07:04.938
follow you.

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:08.438
It’s a big, very big responsibility.

01:07:08.438 --> 01:07:11.438
I hope you understand and realise.

01:07:11.438 --> 01:07:21.317
Thank you, may God bless you.

01:07:21.317 --> 01:07:29.417
Now, first thing you have to do is to accept
the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:39.119
This is the religion which is a universal
religion which encompasses all the religions,

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:46.120
respects all the great incarnations, knows
about them and all the good things that are

01:07:46.144 --> 01:07:49.903
told in all the religions it accepts.

01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:55.630
It’s one religion which is not outside.

01:07:55.661 --> 01:07:58.430
Outside religions have created problems.

01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:05.997
You know they just create differences and
divides people, it’s divisiveness, divides

01:08:06.011 --> 01:08:07.091
people.

01:08:07.111 --> 01:08:08.781
But this is one religion.

01:08:08.837 --> 01:08:14.846
But this one religion was there amongst sufis
among all the saints.

01:08:14.846 --> 01:08:22.566
All those people who were born realised souls,
they had the same religion and that religion

01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:24.437
of humanity we follow.

01:08:24.437 --> 01:08:27.997
This religion is not outside it is inside.

01:08:27.997 --> 01:08:32.127
It’s inside, within yourself; is awakened.

01:08:32.127 --> 01:08:36.326
And here we respect all the great incarnations.

01:08:36.326 --> 01:08:40.926
All the great religions we respect, not only
that [but] we follow [them].

01:08:40.926 --> 01:08:45.167
But we do not believe in any differentiation
or superiority.

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:51.517
So, first, we have to accept that you belong
to this religion then there won’t be any

01:08:51.517 --> 01:08:59.937
fights about small things, like, “I belong
to this caste, this community, this religion,

01:08:59.937 --> 01:09:01.767
this country,” nothing.

01:09:01.767 --> 01:09:08.896
You are beyond that, and thats what we have
to establish if you want to have real peace

01:09:08.896 --> 01:09:11.956
and joy and blessings of the Divine.

01:09:11.956 --> 01:09:17.826
So this is the first thing that we have to
do [in the marriage vows], is to accept.

01:09:20.246 --> 01:09:25.016
And this we do it in the presence of fire.

01:09:25.336 --> 01:09:30.696
Fire, because the fire burns out everything,

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:35.866
The fire rises above gravity, that's the only thing that rises above gravity.

01:09:35.876 --> 01:09:40.736
And that, we worship fire, we have worshipped innocence

01:09:40.796 --> 01:09:44.238
We make it a witness of what we are doing.

01:09:44.328 --> 01:09:49.488
So that this fire can completely clear

01:09:49.608 --> 01:09:56.668
all our problems, all our difficulties in life by giving this light.

01:09:57.028 --> 01:10:01.638
Same fire can enlightened your life.

01:10:01.808 --> 01:10:06.228
But if you go wrong the same fire can burn your life.

01:10:06.398 --> 01:10:10.178
So be careful, this is what it is, it is to give you light

01:10:10.428 --> 01:10:12.928
and  (show) you the right path.
