00:07:53.655 --> 00:08:09.987
Sahajayogis' Shree Mataji, my wife Nirmala ji, dear Sahajyogis.

00:08:10.012 --> 00:08:14.461
Coming home happens to be a great thing.

00:08:14.486 --> 00:08:16.881
Heart overwhelms with joy!

00:08:16.906 --> 00:08:22.245
When i see your immence love for your Mataji

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.217
i feel that the world is moving on a perfect road.

00:08:26.242 --> 00:08:32.188
You see, a year is going to come to an end

00:08:32.213 --> 00:08:36.722
a century and a milenium is going to come to an end.

00:08:36.747 --> 00:08:40.938
and next century and next millenium is going to start.

00:08:40.963 --> 00:08:46.407
I want to say only this much that in this century and before that

00:08:46.432 --> 00:08:52.319
some people came and started new religion

00:08:52.344 --> 00:08:55.967
Saint Gautam Buddha came and Jesus came

00:08:55.992 --> 00:09:00.979
prophet Mohammed came, Guru Nanak came.

00:09:01.004 --> 00:09:07.792
They organised a religion because man needed religion very badly.

00:09:07.817 --> 00:09:11.072
Man's mind gets restless. from the very beginning.

00:09:11.097 --> 00:09:14.809
To manage that, there was a need of dharma.

00:09:14.834 --> 00:09:18.293
But all the religions that were there

00:09:18.318 --> 00:09:25.369
these managed the human being definitely, but from inside

00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:28.947
from inside, the human being remained as he was.

00:09:28.972 --> 00:09:31.538
There was a little bit change externally.

00:09:31.563 --> 00:09:37.119
We went to temples or to Church or to mosque.

00:09:37.144 --> 00:09:42.605
But it is necessary for a man to change from inside because

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:48.349
to meet Our Divine Father, to get connected to God

00:09:48.374 --> 00:09:50.616
this inner change is very important.

00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:53.458
And this work had to be done by somebody.

00:09:53.483 --> 00:10:05.040
God has sent your Mataji for this work.

00:10:05.065 --> 00:10:10.399
A human being has to be elevated above all these.

00:10:10.424 --> 00:10:13.369
After elevating, then they should integrate all of them.

00:10:13.394 --> 00:10:16.460
So, just see, the dharmas that are there, disintegrate people.

00:10:16.485 --> 00:10:18.548
Somebody says, we will do conversion.

00:10:18.573 --> 00:10:20.459
Whom you will convert?

00:10:20.484 --> 00:10:22.740
All of them are of One God.

00:10:22.765 --> 00:10:26.134
Where can you convert? Can anyone convert someone?

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:29.483
If you want to convert, convert them from inside.

00:10:29.508 --> 00:10:32.102
So, it is very important, the time has come

00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:37.818
that all of us, may be of any religion, caste, any creed

00:10:37.843 --> 00:10:46.115
to rise above this state, and Change from within to  be one (with each other).

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.937
It is a huge task.

00:10:47.962 --> 00:10:50.161
There are one billion people in our country.

00:10:50.186 --> 00:10:52.514
In the whole world there are five to six billion people.

00:10:52.539 --> 00:10:54.768
To change them is a massive task.

00:10:54.793 --> 00:10:58.412
For this work, Shree Mataji has come here.

00:10:58.437 --> 00:10:59.887
She is doing Her work.

00:10:59.912 --> 00:11:02.218
You are sitting here. I go around the whole world.

00:11:02.243 --> 00:11:07.842
And i see the changes that are coming in the whole world.

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:12.383
How people in Africa, Latin America in Europe

00:11:12.408 --> 00:11:17.755
you see, the people there sing songs in Hindi, in Sanskrit.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.600
The art of India, They sing songs of India.

00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:25.656
And they recognize that the work She is doing

00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:29.753
for them, for world, for mankind, for all the countries

00:11:29.778 --> 00:11:31.572
is absolutely necessary.

00:11:31.597 --> 00:11:35.566
The work that She has started in this century

00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:39.618
She will be with you surely, in next century.

00:11:39.643 --> 00:11:48.856
She will be eternal, She will complete it.

00:11:48.881 --> 00:11:57.025
I request you to spread Sahajyoga all the more.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.348
Those who have come here in thousands

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:02.585
like that let there be so in the whole of India.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:09.322
Because this itself is for our betterment.

00:12:09.347 --> 00:12:13.973
Saying so much, I thank you very much.

00:12:13.998 --> 00:12:17.188
I was not worthy of being welcomed like this.

00:12:17.213 --> 00:12:27.350
I live with Her and what is my status?

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:30.544
What can be more honouable than to live with Her?

00:12:30.569 --> 00:12:34.483
But even then, thanks a lot!

00:12:34.508 --> 00:12:37.235
With your love i can move forward.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:42.826
Nargilkar Ji, i am thankful to you.

00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:45.397
I didn't know that it is going to be like this.

00:12:45.422 --> 00:12:46.616
I would have forbidden you beforehand.

00:12:46.641 --> 00:12:50.702
But you have done so much, thank you for all that.

00:12:50.727 --> 00:12:58.907
My salutations to you all.

00:12:58.932 --> 00:13:12.002
My salutations to the seekers of truth and to all the Sahajyogis.

00:13:12.027 --> 00:13:22.620
To see you having assembled here in such a great number

00:13:22.659 --> 00:13:27.806
My heart is really overjoyed.

00:13:27.831 --> 00:13:35.241
And thinking that in My life time itself, so many people

00:13:35.266 --> 00:13:42.139
people from far off places have got their self realization.

00:13:42.164 --> 00:13:49.544
Without truth, a man's life is absolutely useless.

00:13:49.569 --> 00:13:53.484
Just as in the dark one keeps on groping

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:58.784
in the same way, in the absence of truth, man wanders here and there.

00:13:58.809 --> 00:14:02.014
I don't blame him for that.

00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:07.085
The fault lies with that darkness which is enveloping it.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:14.043
As I have told that you and all of you should  spread Sahajyoga.

00:14:14.068 --> 00:14:16.533
It is also My great desire.

00:14:16.558 --> 00:14:21.733
You can spread Sahajyoga and it should spread.

00:14:21.758 --> 00:14:29.283
Everybody should think that we have got it and we should give it to others.

00:14:29.307 --> 00:14:33.637
Because of this, Sahajyoga will definitely spread

00:14:33.662 --> 00:14:42.900
But, because of that, a peaceful, such beautiful like heaven will be in this world.

00:14:42.925 --> 00:14:50.113
Now it is in your hands that, you will do this work fully.

00:14:50.138 --> 00:14:53.874
And this work is going on in full speed.

00:14:53.899 --> 00:15:01.097
The reason is that India is YOG BHUMI.

00:15:01.122 --> 00:15:06.908
It is PUNYA BHUMI (Divine land) and in this Divine land,

00:15:06.933 --> 00:15:13.438
such a Divine work had to be done, was understood, it was known

00:15:13.463 --> 00:15:19.711
But with such a speed and after spreading so much

00:15:19.736 --> 00:15:25.790
this family would mature so much, I had not expected.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.912
But it is happening and also will happen.

00:15:29.937 --> 00:15:36.389
You are enjoying it, give it to others as well.

00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:40.071
India is already My country.

00:15:40.096 --> 00:15:47.124
But the special joy I get in coming here, cannot be described.

00:15:47.149 --> 00:15:56.558
When I see you at the airport I feel, not knowing into how many hearts this joy will be lightened.

00:15:56.583 --> 00:16:00.789
And how many people will be benefitted by this joy?

00:16:00.814 --> 00:16:09.448
That will protect our children and our younger generation will be protected.

00:16:09.473 --> 00:16:17.887
Not only this, there will be SWARAJ in the real sense of the term.

00:16:17.912 --> 00:16:24.906
'Swa' means 'Atma', and the coming of 'kingdom of Atma' in itself is swaraj.

00:16:24.931 --> 00:16:29.444
'Swatantra' means  same 'Tantra' of Atma

00:16:29.469 --> 00:16:35.845
means technique of 'Atma'.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.671
Both these should be there and that has come.

00:16:39.746 --> 00:16:44.469
You have accepted that and implemented in your lives.

00:16:44.494 --> 00:16:47.407
And now you have to enrich other's lives as well.

00:16:47.432 --> 00:16:51.836
This is the time of their emancipation and it should be done.

00:16:51.861 --> 00:16:56.076
Now, I have seen lot of things.

00:16:56.176 --> 00:17:01.140
I was so surprised that the effect of the millennium is in full force.

00:17:01.165 --> 00:17:10.660
Like our many Sahajyogis had come even from foreign countries

00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:15.038
and those who had gone to Orissa

00:17:15.063 --> 00:17:20.344
there they gave realization to people.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:24.474
And there they opened nine centers.

00:17:24.499 --> 00:17:26.594
And when cyclone hit Orissa

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:33.246
there is a reason for that, because a lot of wrong things happen there.

00:17:33.271 --> 00:17:40.647
But not even one single Sahajyogi was harmed.

00:17:40.672 --> 00:17:51.353
Their houses did not collapse, nothing happened to them.

00:17:51.378 --> 00:17:56.172
In the same way, in Turkey, although they were Muslims

00:17:56.197 --> 00:18:00.451
and now they have become real Muslims.

00:18:00.476 --> 00:18:06.096
When they joined Sahajyoga, about more than 2,000 people joined.

00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:11.447
There also earthquake badly hit the country twice.

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:20.115
But not even one Sahajyogi was in the least troubled.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:29.375
Not even their relatives were hurt. They were all saved.

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:32.379
Many such incidents happened even in Italy.

00:18:32.435 --> 00:18:40.658
But everywhere I see Sahaja Yogis are fully protected.

00:18:40.683 --> 00:18:45.600
And under this protection, you are flourishing.

00:18:45.625 --> 00:18:50.089
It means, that it is said that it is Last Judgement

00:18:50.114 --> 00:18:55.050
it has started and it is going on with a great speed.

00:18:55.075 --> 00:19:02.256
All of you already meditate and you have progressed a lot in Sahaj

00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:07.582
But on getting it you should have the desire to give it to others as well.

00:19:07.607 --> 00:19:09.365
There will be desire definitely

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:15.117
but due to some reason or the other, this desire doesn't get fullfilled.

00:19:15.142 --> 00:19:19.988
This you have to do with full dedication.

00:19:20.013 --> 00:19:24.504
The worldly affairs continue going on, all these things go on.

00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:31.202
And to come out of that and to give realization to people

00:19:31.227 --> 00:19:37.196
to manage them, to nourish them is your absolute duty.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.926
And it depends on you only

00:19:39.951 --> 00:19:45.339
You only can do it and many of you are even doing it.

00:19:45.364 --> 00:19:51.153
But according to Me, If you can do more than this, after a good discussion

00:19:51.178 --> 00:19:58.816
that our betterment, our joy, which we got, let others also get it.

00:19:58.841 --> 00:20:04.386
Keeping this in mind, if you pay your attention a little towards it

00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:08.165
a lot can be done about it in India.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:14.475
And I think that this work is not difficult.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:23.488
Because , in this there is no quarrel, no trouble, no witness, no drinking, nothing.

00:20:23.513 --> 00:20:26.374
Only to awaken kundalini of people

00:20:26.399 --> 00:20:31.168
And that power is within you, use that.

00:20:31.193 --> 00:20:37.594
When the power is within you and you won't use it, what is its use?

00:20:37.619 --> 00:20:43.576
All of you, use that power and make a determination

00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:46.852
that every one, every Sahajyogi

00:20:46.877 --> 00:20:49.816
should give realization to atleast hundred people.

00:20:49.841 --> 00:20:54.158
Talk to everyone, and there is nothing to feel shy about

00:20:54.183 --> 00:20:59.162
There is nothing to worry about, because we are on the path of truth.

00:20:59.187 --> 00:21:04.260
And now a days, the variety of Gurus that have come out

00:21:04.285 --> 00:21:09.333
have the same plan, that they will talk openly about it.

00:21:09.357 --> 00:21:11.548
Talk to all of them and tell them

00:21:11.573 --> 00:21:12.993
'Be away from these affairs (Gurus)'.

00:21:13.018 --> 00:21:14.929
Otherwise they too will be destroyed.

00:21:14.954 --> 00:21:20.666
It is our duty that as the boat of this universe is sinking

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:23.041
and only you are the saviour of it.

00:21:23.066 --> 00:21:29.340
You should like this only, try to see, how many people you can give realization?

00:21:29.365 --> 00:21:33.383
This joy cannot be contained only in one's own heart.

00:21:33.408 --> 00:21:37.734
If it could be contained, why should I have given up My home

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:40.852
and come out and give realization to people?

00:21:40.877 --> 00:21:42.690
It is such a situation that

00:21:42.715 --> 00:21:48.124
it seems that we should enjoy its benifits along with others.

00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:53.580
If you are in that state, you should fully utilize it.

00:21:53.605 --> 00:21:59.119
And you should come forward and proceed towards it.

00:21:59.144 --> 00:22:04.783
And I hope that next time, when I will come again to India

00:22:04.808 --> 00:22:16.706
that multiple times more people can be seen in Sahajyoga.

00:22:16.732 --> 00:22:21.469
You have honoured Me, these things were not required

00:22:21.494 --> 00:22:25.687
but it is your desire, so I agreed to it and consented to it.

00:22:25.712 --> 00:22:31.500
That I could see that day only when I had reached the airport

00:22:31.525 --> 00:22:37.755
And how the people were enamoured with love.

And if it is done in this life time

00:22:47.687 --> 00:22:51.493
nobody knows how much one will be rewarded, of these Punyas (Good Karmas).

00:22:51.518 --> 00:23:22.333
