00:00:00.301 --> 00:00:05.501
TV Reporter: Work stress has become a
modern day epidemic but trials have shown

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:11.156
an ancient practice could be the best way
to beat it. Meditation is proving effective

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:15.131
and it costs, virtually, nothing.
Health Reporter: Henry Viana was so

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:19.546
stressed running his previous business with
clients not paying, working long hours.

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:22.472
He nearly threw the towel in.
Stress Survivor: In the most, men are the

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:26.924
typical male. Now I have no problems,
I'm fine, you know. And then, next thing

00:00:26.924 --> 00:00:30.695
you know, you know, that done something
silly like jump off on a bridge.

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:35.522
Health Reporter: Henry wasn't alone. 25% 
of the population is depressed. Half of us

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:41.147
are very unhappy and stress now
costs Australia $15 billion a year.

00:00:41.147 --> 00:00:44.597
Dr. Ramesh Manocha: Experts are 
calling this an epidemicive stress.

00:00:44.597 --> 00:00:48.006
Health Reporter: But Dr. Manocha, Sydney
university team, in one of the most

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:53.564
rigorous trials ever conducted, has proven
traditional meditation can eliminate rapid

00:00:53.564 --> 00:00:57.547
thoughts that keep you wide and stressed.
Dr. Manocha: In what is showed quite

00:00:57.547 --> 00:01:02.632
clearly, was that a meditation technique
that focuses on the experience of mental

00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:08.999
silence, in this case, a technique called
Sahaja yoga, significantly reduced stress

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.440
and depressive feelings.
Health Reporter: Meditation costs, virtually,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.398
nothing to learn and Henry's also taught friends to
meditate, the required 10 minutes, twice a day.

00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:22.700
Stress Survivor: Huge benefits, if it's changed
a lot so in effect that saved a lot two of them

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.073
Health Reporter: Doctors caution is this
is not an overnight solution and those,

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:29.830
who are really depressed should be seeking
medical advice. The point is, if you

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.573
take up meditation early, it can prevent
stress leading to mental health issues.

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:38.995
Stress Survivor: I was always angry and
