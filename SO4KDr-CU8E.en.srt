1
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:16,250
Today we have come here

2
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:22,208
to worship Jesus Christ and His Mother.

3
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,166
It's such a coincidence

4
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,458
that the Mother of Christ

5
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:32,166
came and stayed in Turkey.

6
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,333
Isn't it surprising

7
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,333
that She should come here

8
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:43,041
after the crucifixion of Christ and stayed here.

9
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:47,959
I wonder if He also came with Her later on?

10
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:50,709
But they say then He went to Kashmir

11
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:52,834
and She was also there.

12
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:56,083
Quite possible, on their way

13
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,500
they might have gone there.

14
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:04,834
So we are here to worship Him.

15
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,250
According to Sahaja Yoga,

16
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:19,542
She was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi

17
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:25,834
and She's the one who sacrificed Her Son

18
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:31,250
for the sake of religion.

19
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,250
But unfortunately,

20
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,959
nobody understood Her value.

21
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,041
Nobody saw

22
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:47,375
that She was such a great spiritual personality.

23
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,125
Only through Sahaja Yoga

24
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,792
you can understand that She was

25
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,834
a very great personality

26
00:02:56,083 --> 00:03:00,125
who gave birth to Christ.

27
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,959
It is very unfortunate

28
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,417
that She was not respected,

29
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,166
specially in the Islamic world.

30
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:20,083
Because of that,

31
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,458
the women in the Islamic culture have no place.

32
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:34,250
My experience is very sad about them.

33
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:38,750
We have started an organization

34
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,250
for the rehabilitation of women

35
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:46,417
who are destitutes and all of them

36
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,208
who have applied are Muslim ladies - very sad.

37
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,875
While Muhammed Sahib has said

38
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,959
that "you must look after your mother"

39
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,250
despite that all these women

40
00:04:01,834 --> 00:04:06,750
some of them have eight children, ten children

41
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:09,792
- have come to this destitute home.

42
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,750
Of course, we have to give them place.

43
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,333
We have to look after them

44
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,667
because we don't believe in all these

45
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,750
small type of ideas about religion.

46
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,667
Most important is 'human' religion.

47
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:32,792
We have to combine all these religions together.

48
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,333
It's a terrible task

49
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,166
because Muslim won't respect Muslim.

50
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,625
Christians - Christians won't respect Hindus.

51
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:47,291
I mean it's a funny thing that's going on.

52
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,583
They all are for God

53
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,917
and for God's work and His love.

54
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,625
Despite that, there's no respect.

55
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,458
There's no love.

56
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:03,166
On the contrary, they're all quarrelling, fighting,

57
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:07,125
killing everywhere.

58
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,667
It's very sad

59
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,750
that in the name of religion and God,

60
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:18,333
people should become so cruel and so absurd.

61
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:21,792
This is the only solution-

62
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,959
is to give them Self Realization,

63
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:31,291
which is the Realization

64
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:37,291
was called as miraj in the Koran.

65
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,709
It's called as miraj.

66
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,250
But they have said that nobody can get miraj.

67
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,250
Muhammed-sahib got it, but nobody else

68
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:49,959
- like they have banned people

69
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,083
from getting Self Realization,

70
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:53,667
which is not true.

71
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:59,000
All human beings can get Self Realization.

72
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,166
Whether they are from Africa,

73
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:08,417
England, America, India, anywhere.

74
00:06:09,792 --> 00:06:11,792
They all can get their miraj.

75
00:06:13,542 --> 00:06:17,125
One should understand that no human being

76
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,959
is created in this world to fight,

77
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:21,875
to fight each other.

78
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,834
Even the animals don't fight.

79
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,625
Why should human beings fight

80
00:06:27,917 --> 00:06:29,709
- that, too, in the name of religion.

81
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,542
In the name of God,

82
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,792
Christ came on this Earth

83
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,166
just to create oneness of religion,

84
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,959
but even the Christians, they only started fighting,

85
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,250
dominating others.

86
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,875
It's a big world of turmoil,

87
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,750
where everybody is fighting in the name of God

88
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,625
and in the name of religion.

89
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,291
So our religion is global,

90
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,709
is one religion.

91
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,583
We respect all the Deities,

92
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,125
all the Gods and Goddesses

93
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,625
- respect Them and worship Them.

94
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:18,291
We are not so stupid

95
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:22,834
not to understand that They are all one.

96
00:07:24,083 --> 00:07:26,041
Also, after getting Realization,

97
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:29,625
you realize that all these exist

98
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,250
on our central nervous system.

99
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,250
They exist on our chakras.

100
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,083
They are not there

101
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,250
just because people have told us in history and all that,

102
00:07:44,542 --> 00:07:46,333
but actually in that's a fact,

103
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:49,834
that all of them are there together,

104
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,417
working out the resurrection of the whole world.

105
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,250
So the greatest thing that Christ has done

106
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,542
is the resurrection part

107
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,875
and in this resurrection, He suffered a lot.

108
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,000
He had to go through lots of ordeals

109
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:10,500
and then His body itself was resurrected.

110
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,792
On the same lines, Sahaja Yoga is working out

111
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,750
- that you get your Realization

112
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,792
means your resurrection.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,125
All your wrong ideas disappear.

114
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,291
All your nonsense disappears

115
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,667
and nothing but love,

116
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,208
understanding comes in.

117
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,166
It was difficult, I know, in the beginning

118
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:41,000
to start this work in India or otherwise, also everywhere

119
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,625
I found people are so ignorant

120
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,333
and human beings hate each other.

121
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:50,500
With some excuse, ......... with

122
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:54,458
some sort of a - I don't know what ideas they have,

123
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,166
historical ideas, and they hate.

124
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,583
This hating in India has been there,

125
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,709
but also abroad, like Hitler came in.

126
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,500
Hitler came because he hated human beings.

127
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,834
He was a satanic force who incarnated

128
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:17,709
and did all kinds of horrible things.

129
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,875
The way he has killed people,

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,542
you can't imagine a human being can do that.

131
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,750
He killed children.

132
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:33,417
He killed grown-up people in the gas chambers and

133
00:09:33,917 --> 00:09:35,792
- such a horrible thing.

134
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:37,959
When I went to Germany,

135
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:40,166
they wanted Me to see all that.

136
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:45,250
I said, "I can't see. I will not be able to see it."

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,625
But My husband went there

138
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:52,542
and when he came back, he was sick for seven days.

139
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:54,583
It's so sickening.

140
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:58,375
It's so inhuman to behave like that,

141
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:02,291
to kill people, under some circumstances,

142
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:06,458
under certain conceptions and wrong ideas.

143
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,959
I don't know what sort of idea this Hitler had

144
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:16,125
that he got after the Jews and started killing them.

145
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:21,291
All kinds of things have happened on this Earth,

146
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,375
all in the name of religion. This is the worst part of it.

147
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,250
Throughout, people have been killing

148
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:30,834
in the name of religion.

149
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,542
Religion teaches you to love,

150
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,709
to love God and love each other.

151
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,959
How can it teach you to hate and to kill?

152
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:45,000
I mean, it's very surprising, still going on.

153
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:48,041
This kind of a nonsense is still going on.

154
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,917
It's only Sahaja Yoga that can stop this nonsense

155
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:57,000
and it should because, after all,

156
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,792
we are all human beings.

157
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:02,166
For that, you have to have your resurrection,

158
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,083
as Christ had.

159
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:08,500
And this resurrection is possible on this Earth,

160
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,166
very easily now with Sahaja Yoga.

161
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,500
Muhammad-sahib has called it has miraj.

162
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:18,500
He's described it very well, very clearly.

163
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,917
But who wants that?

164
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,125
They don't want to have their miraj.

165
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,709
If somebody tries to work it out,

166
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,959
they get after that person, saying

167
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,208
that  "This is something ridiculous."

168
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,333
It's all wrong.

169
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,750
I mean this has happened with all of them.

170
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,500
All of them have suffered

171
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:46,834
because of the ignorance  of human beings - all of them.

172
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,250
And also with Me, they are criticizing and this and that.

173
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,000
But I am much more powerful,

174
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,291
because love is much more powerful than anything else.

175
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:04,625
And it's working out all over the world now,

176
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:09,333
everywhere people are realizing that this kind of a hatred,

177
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:13,667
this kind of a wrong idea about others

178
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,917
is absolutely dangerous.

179
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:24,000
And so, once large number of people know this,

180
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,166
I'm sure it will all finish off.

181
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,458
We have lots of incidents like that, even recently.

182
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:37,709
That just because you follow a particular religion,

183
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,250
people hate you.

184
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,667
I mean I can't understand.

185
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:46,792
You cannot explain why, why it is done,

186
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:51,875
but it's done and very wrong to hate any human being

187
00:12:52,417 --> 00:12:56,750
in the name of God, who has created you.

188
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,417
They don't understand God and His love.

189
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:07,583
For example, Christ's life - just see it.

190
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,500
He was hardly thirty-three years of age

191
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:14,291
when He was crucified.

192
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,333
His mother had to suffer so much.

193
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,083
Why? Why did they crucify Him?

194
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,375
Because He was teaching about love.

195
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,875
None of them liked this idea of loving each other.

196
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,542
How can you help people if you don't love?

197
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:42,792
Under what premises do you help others?

198
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,792
Because you love,

199
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:49,834
that's why you want to enjoy others

200
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,709
and to understand.

201
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,250
Once you start loving others,

202
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:59,166
then this myth finishes off.

203
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:02,583
Supposing you are born as a Christian

204
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,125
or a Muslim or a Hindu, or whatever it is,

205
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,250
what makes you think that you are different from others?

206
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,333
You are born the same way.

207
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:18,917
You are conceived by your mother the same way.

208
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:21,291
You look the same way.

209
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,834
Your nose, eyes, everything is the same.

210
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,417
What makes you different?

211
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,667
I think it's something political about it,

212
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,041
something very mean

213
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:40,166
to separate people in the name of God and religion.

214
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,542
On the contrary, Sahaja Yoga is to

215
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,458
unite all the people in the name of God,

216
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:50,375
to make them one in the name of God.

217
00:14:51,542 --> 00:14:53,875
Supposing there is somebody living,

218
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,250
say, in South Africa

219
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:03,041
or say, in a far-fetched place like Benin and all that

220
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,917
- has become a Sahaja Yogi.

221
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,792
There are thousands who have become Sahaja Yogis there.

222
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,291
They are all your bothers and sisters.

223
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,625
They're your own.

224
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,625
You go there and they will

225
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,709
treat you just like their own children, their own relations.

226
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,583
They will never think what religion you come from

227
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:28,583
or what sect you come from, nothing.

228
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,083
I was surprised the way they have love.

229
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,291
Actually, loving is an innate quality of human beings.

230
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:40,875
It's an innate quality. Every human being has been

231
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,875
given this treasure of loving, loving capacity.

232
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:50,792
But that capacity has become so much less,

233
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,333
so much minimum, that, with that capacity,

234
00:15:55,625 --> 00:16:00,417
people fight and kill each other.

235
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:06,625
It's a greatest sin to kill people in the name of religion.

236
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,709
I don't know what - how they believe

237
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,875
that, by killing each other, we can go to heaven.

238
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,750
They will go to the worst hell.

239
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:24,375
This idea has now, of course, subsided a little,

240
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,709
but still existing.

241
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:29,291
They see it happening every day,

242
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,917
this kind of a nonsense, but still they are continuing with it.

243
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:38,250
Now what can we Sahaja Yogis do about it?

244
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,542
We should think.

245
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,041
Let us see, whatever religion we are born, that's what.

246
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,667
You have to be born in some religion.

247
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,041
You cannot drop from heaven.

248
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:55,959
So whatever religion you are born, you are not bound by that.

249
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:01,834
You are bound by the religion of love and joy.

250
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,750
And then you go on crying and weeping

251
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:12,917
and teaching and … of unhappiness, of fighting.

252
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,458
How can that be? We are human beings.

253
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,959
They are not animals.

254
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:20,041
Even the dogs don't do that way.

255
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,500
Why should we human beings kill each other

256
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:31,959
and make a miserable life for others and for yourself?

257
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:35,083
Because if you hate others,

258
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,041
you will also become hateful.

259
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:43,417
A will hate the B and then the B will hate the A,

260
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:46,959
so the whole human life and civilization

261
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:49,583
has nothing to do but to hate!

262
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:56,834
Sahaja Yoga is such a blessing to you, I must say,

263
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,709
because it has given to you all the Deities within you, enlightened

264
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,792
and now you know you are belong to the whole.

265
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:08,208
You know you are not belonging to some stupid ideas.

266
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,709
It's very remarkable when I came here.

267
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,250
I knew Mary lived here. I knew Mother Mary lived here.

268
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,625
There is a house of Mother Mary.

269
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,333
That gave Me a very great joy to know that She had lived here

270
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:33,375
and so I said we must worship Her.

271
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,500
After all, She was a mother of Christ!

272
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,625
Mother is a mother.

273
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,208
What does it matter whether She was a Christian, Hindu, Muslim?

274
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,750
It doesn't matter.

275
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,333
And for Her love, She allowed Her son to be sacrificed

276
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:54,291
for the whole world and for the universe - what a mother!

277
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,750
Can you find such a mother in this world

278
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:02,500
who will allow Her own son to be crucified -

279
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:11,125
such a courageous, loving and global personality.

280
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,291
Here we are. It's a coincidence, as I said,

281
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,375
because She lived here.

282
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,125
Why did She come?

283
00:19:22,417 --> 00:19:24,875
Why did She come here? She could have gone directly.

284
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:30,792
She came here and lived and we have a house of Her.

285
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,750
Now with this house only,

286
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:35,083
the Christians will start a cult.

287
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,709
They'll fight with the Muslims

288
00:19:40,083 --> 00:19:43,500
and the Muslims will fight with the Christians.

289
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,875
Anything you do, they will fight.

290
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:49,333
That's the main character is to fight,

291
00:19:49,834 --> 00:19:53,834
not to help others, not to help each other - no, not at all.

292
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:59,709
They're just trying to be very, very funny and nasty.

293
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:05,917
In India we have had so many nice people

294
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,250
who taught that we must love each other.

295
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,792
Despite that, in India people are fighting.

296
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,417
They have had so many Sufis in this country.

297
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,792
In the same way, in India also,

298
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:23,709
we have had very great saints, very great - everywhere.

299
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,959
Some of them were Muslims,

300
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,083
some of them were Hindus

301
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,333
and people sing their songs; everything's there.

302
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:37,667
But, they're worshipped separately

303
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,250
and people fight even in their names.

304
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,959
They want to find something to fight.

305
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,667
Real fighting cocks, I tell you they are.

306
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,583
They haven't got a human quality within them,

307
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,792
which is love, which is affection-

308
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,750
must enjoy your love for each other.

309
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:02,166
That's the thing they have lost their capacity to love.

310
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:06,542
What does it matter if somebody is born

311
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:09,208
in China or in India or anywhere?

312
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:11,333
He is a human being.

313
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,750
He, too, has the capacity to love

314
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:18,417
and you should also have capacity to love.

315
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,709
My experience is different.

316
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:26,083
I went to China with My husband.

317
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:27,959
In China

318
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,959
that time, they didn't have any good feelings for Indians,

319
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,125
I don't know why.

320
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,792
But they were so kind to Me, you won't believe,

321
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,542
so nice to Me

322
00:21:40,709 --> 00:21:42,250
and the way they treated Me,

323
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,750
everybody was surprised, " What's the matter?  "

324
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,959
"How are they so kind to you? "

325
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:50,500
"In China they don't like Indians."

326
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,583
I said, "It's a myth. "

327
00:21:52,959 --> 00:21:55,333
"I don't think I have seen that with the Chinese. "

328
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,125
"They're extremely, extremely kind and respectful to Me. "

329
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,291
"What have I done for them? Nothing."

330
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:08,417
Well, you'll be surprised, in one of the hotels,

331
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,834
one of My ankle ornament[s] had fallen down - silver.

332
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:22,667
It did happen and then I went away to a very far fetched place

333
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:27,250
and they sent it in an envelope, those anklets.

334
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:28,875
Can you imagine?

335
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,959
All the way - I was so much full of tears.

336
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:39,500
So I said "These Chinese are also very loving people,

337
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,542
extremely loving."

338
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:45,125
I went for My program.

339
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:49,709
We had a women's conference.

340
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,500
So I don't know why,

341
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,625
but at the airport only these Chinese boys arrived.

342
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,125
They took all My luggage. I was so late!

343
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:05,834
The function was at ten o'clock and I reached about 8:30.

344
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,083
They put Me in the car.

345
00:23:08,792 --> 00:23:10,250
They put My luggage there

346
00:23:10,417 --> 00:23:12,208
and they said, "We have to directly

347
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:15,000
go to the conference." I said, "All right."

348
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:19,875
I went there and in this short time,

349
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:23,250
these boys were really so attached to Me.

350
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,166
When I finished the conference, they're waiting outside

351
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:28,917
- can't believe it -

352
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:32,834
the same Chinese people who are against Indians.

353
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,208
And then, after that, it didn't stop.

354
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,667
They brought two cars -

355
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,709
one for My wheelchair, one for Me

356
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,458
- and they took Me to the best shopping places.

357
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,625
But I said, "What will you do?"

358
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,333
They said, 'We'll carry your wheelchair upstairs.

359
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:54,875
Can you imagine?

360
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,542
They were no relation of mine.

361
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,667
I've never seen them before.

362
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,500
So one of them said,

363
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:06,208
"Tomorrow, Mother, I won't be able to come." I said, "Why?"

364
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,291
He said, "I'm getting married tomorrow."

365
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:10,959
And I said, "What have you been doing all this day?"

366
00:24:12,917 --> 00:24:15,166
He said, "I enjoyed your company so much"

367
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,959
I'm such an old woman like Me - young people.

368
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,333
"No, no, no, no, I've enjoyed.

369
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:24,083
I'll also bring my bride for You to be seen."

370
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:25,375
I tell you,

371
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,583
tears came into my eyes.

372
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,208
I said, "Such love, such kindness."

373
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,750
I didn't do anything for them, nothing.

374
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,208
I didn't give them any money, nothing.

375
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,500
My goodness, till the end they were so much attentive to Me

376
00:24:42,166 --> 00:24:46,083
- very young boys, all below twenty-five years of age.

377
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:50,083
And they carried My Wheelchair

378
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,500
up three storeys with their hands.

379
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,667
I said, "Don't do it, I don't want …"

380
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:57,792
(They said,) "No, no, no, no, we want You to see."

381
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,458
"We want You to come."

382
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:01,625
I said, "Why?"

383
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:04,417
[They] said, "It would be nice for all of them."

384
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:07,208
I don't know what made them think like that.

385
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,250
Such enlightened people, I tell you.

386
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:12,709
With love, you get enlightened.

387
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,667
With love, you get understanding.

388
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:20,667
And such deep love exists within you.

389
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:23,291
Now the politicians will come

390
00:25:23,417 --> 00:25:24,834
and tell you a story.

391
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,041
Then somebody else will tell you,

392
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:28,959
"Come and fight" and all that.

393
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:32,083
That's how they have managed in Germany, young people.

394
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:37,667
But now, now they're changing.

395
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,917
All this world has to change

396
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,333
because it has suffered a lot.

397
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,542
This is no religion.

398
00:25:47,041 --> 00:25:50,291
This is not the teachings of the saints - no.

399
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:52,291
It is not.

400
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:56,291
It is devilish, that teaches you to hate others,

401
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,208
is the worst thing.

402
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:02,750
I mean all the enjoyment of love,

403
00:26:03,792 --> 00:26:08,542
all the enjoyment of affection, you don't know.

404
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:14,750
Nowadays, you see the problem of the churches, this, that.

405
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,083
I can't understand, stupid people.

406
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,208
They have done so many laws

407
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,375
and with that laws, whatever it is, whatever may be the causes,

408
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:30,250
but what's happening is that poor children are suffering.

409
00:26:31,834 --> 00:26:34,333
They have no sense of pure love.

410
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:39,333
Nobody understands what is poor love is.

411
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:43,041
Which is actually their innate quality, their innate -

412
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,667
I should say the 'property'.

413
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:51,375
But they don't know how you can love somebody purely!

414
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:58,166
It's all something very, very wretched.

415
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:01,208
It doesn't behove human beings to be like that.

416
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,542
Even the animals are not like that,

417
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,500
but human beings can go to any extreme.

418
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:10,959
The whole wealth of beauty,

419
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:13,417
the whole wealth of creativity,

420
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:17,250
the whole wealth of art, artistic temperament,

421
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,083
the whole wealth of enjoying life is finished.

422
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,250
If you are a fighting cock,

423
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:30,375
you can't see anything, any good in anyone, in anything.

424
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:33,000
They will fight others

425
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:35,875
and they'll fight among themselves also - is a fact.

426
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:39,208
They might say, "We must fight." All right,  fight.

427
00:27:39,417 --> 00:27:42,750
But then they fight among themselves also.

428
00:27:42,959 --> 00:27:46,750
They will torture their own brothers and sisters.

429
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:51,458
I mean, they don't love anyone. This is the main thing is.

430
00:27:51,834 --> 00:27:53,667
Why take the name of religion?

431
00:27:54,834 --> 00:27:56,583
What the religion has done?

432
00:27:57,291 --> 00:27:59,333
How could the religion teach you such a

433
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:02,917
horrible thing like hatred for your own?

434
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:08,750
It's not only among Christians, Hindus, Muslims, but

435
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:15,417
everywhere human beings have become very dirty and filthy.

436
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,083
They say it is Kali Yuga.

437
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:20,542
I can't understand.

438
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,750
How can you lose the power to love?

439
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,709
That's what Christ has talked about.

440
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,709
He's talked about love very clearly.

441
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,667
He said, "Love thy neighbour as thyself."

442
00:28:33,917 --> 00:28:35,709
Have you found anyone like that?

443
00:28:39,458 --> 00:28:41,250
You don't find all such people.

444
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:46,500
The Christians who followed Christ, what did they do?

445
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,166
Muslims who followed Mohammed-sahib, what did they do?

446
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:55,750
And Hindus who followed Shri Rama, what did they do?

447
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,667
Are they anywhere near their leaders?

448
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:03,500
Are they anywhere near those Incarnations of the Divine?

449
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,709
Nowhere.

450
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,625
The reason is - I don't blame them

451
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,041
- because they had no Realization.

452
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,041
They didn't know their spirit.

453
00:29:13,667 --> 00:29:15,375
If you have no Realization,

454
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:18,333
you cannot understand anything,

455
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:22,834
you cannot understand any enjoyment or anything.

456
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,542
I mean,

457
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,250
if you go to Germany,

458
00:29:29,959 --> 00:29:32,959
you can't go and see all the things they have done.

459
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:37,125
You'll faint, if you have any human qualities.

460
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:40,417
Even you go to Japan

461
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:43,709
and they way they had put this Hiroshima,

462
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:46,208
this - my goodness,

463
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:49,583
I started trembling, I couldn't bear it.

464
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:53,333
I said,  "How could human beings be that cruel?"

465
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,542
Horrible!

466
00:29:57,291 --> 00:29:58,583
I mean now the days have come that

467
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,291
they're killing their own children.

468
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,542
Extreme is this.

469
00:30:03,709 --> 00:30:05,959
The other side of it is Sahaja Yoga,

470
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:10,375
in which you love all human beings

471
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,041
because they're human beings.

472
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:17,750
They're born with you in this time.

473
00:30:18,834 --> 00:30:20,500
You have to help each other

474
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:22,333
and love each other.

475
00:30:23,834 --> 00:30:25,000
This is the main thing.

476
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:27,125
If you can develop this,

477
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,000
you'll be very, very strong Sahaja Yogis

478
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:33,959
and you will be supported and blessed by the Divine.

479
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,917
Divine will help you

480
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:39,709
and take you out of all troubles

481
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:43,875
and tribulations and all kinds of difficulties,

482
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:48,083
if you are a loving personality.

483
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:51,375
This is what the blessing of Kali Yuga.

484
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:52,792
It didn't exist (like this before.)

485
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:57,583
Now, if you are a loving person,

486
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:01,583
the Divine will go out of the way to help you,

487
00:31:02,125 --> 00:31:04,166
to sort out your problems,

488
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,750
to punish those who are troubling you.

489
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,417
I mean, it's My own experience like that.

490
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,834
I never do anything. I never curse anybody.

491
00:31:13,041 --> 00:31:14,500
I don't fight. I don't shout.

492
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:18,041
Automatically, it works.

493
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:21,291
I don't even tell the Divine to do anything.

494
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,875
The Divine is at the greatest, just personality,

495
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:32,542
I should say. That is the one who does all the justice.

496
00:31:33,542 --> 00:31:38,542
Nobody can suffer under the guidance and love of Divine,

497
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:39,750
take it from Me.

498
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,291
This is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

499
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,709
I agree Kali Yuga is horrible.

500
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,458
People are horrible. This is that.

501
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,041
But there's one thing

502
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:55,875
that this Divine has become very alert.

503
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,500
It was never that alert.

504
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,500
If Christ was born at this time,

505
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,583
He could not have been crucified.

506
00:32:05,792 --> 00:32:10,083
It's only because He was not born during Kali Yuga.

507
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,208
That's a very big blessing for us.

508
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:15,291
Nobody can be tortured.

509
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,917
Nobody can be troubled.

510
00:32:18,959 --> 00:32:22,375
Only thing, you have to be a humble person.

511
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,417
You have to have a good character

512
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:30,583
and you have to have a very loving personality.

513
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,083
That's all.

514
00:32:32,458 --> 00:32:34,625
You'll enjoy the loving personality.

515
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,291
You'll get the blessings

516
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,667
because [of] you're loving personality.

517
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,583
I mean, the way the Divine looks after you,

518
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,542
there are so many miracles people tell Me.

519
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,125
I'm not surprised because I know

520
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:51,625
the Divine has become extremely alert

521
00:32:52,208 --> 00:32:55,458
towards human beings who are good and nice.

522
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:57,166
It will look after.

523
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:59,709
It will support. It will do everything.

524
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:04,542
It's very surprising that it has become so alert.

525
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,375
Like Muahmmed-sahib suffered so much.

526
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:11,083
Everybody suffered so much, but not now.

527
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:13,208
Now the Sahaja Yogis won't suffer.

528
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,709
Take it from Me.

529
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:18,500
They're looked after by the Divine itself.

530
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,750
Everything is looked after. I will tell you,

531
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:25,083
people have written letters after letters all over the world,

532
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,166
how they have been supported,

533
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,417
how they have been helped.

534
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:34,041
Very surprising how they have been rescued.

535
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:42,917
So we have to trust in ourselves

536
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:47,208
and we have to really love people.

537
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:50,834
We should be humble and love.

538
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:55,333
All this love will help you all your life.

539
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:58,750
This is the message of Christ.

540
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,542
Christ has said, "Forgive them."

541
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,166
How lovingly He said,

542
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,208
"But they don't know what they're doing."

543
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:09,166
Very lovingly He pleads

544
00:34:09,417 --> 00:34:12,208
for all the bad people who crucified Him,

545
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,542
that "Oh, Lord, please forgive them

546
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,208
because they don't know what they are doing."

547
00:34:17,792 --> 00:34:21,083
Can you imagine such a loving character of Christ?

548
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:27,625
And now, when we are celebrating and worshipping Him,

549
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:30,625
we have to worship that character within us,

550
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,083
that we are also loving people.

551
00:34:33,417 --> 00:34:34,583
We love each other.

552
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:38,542
All over the world, all the Sahaja Yogis love each other.

553
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,834
Of course, there could be one or two who are not so good,

554
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:46,041
but mostly, ninety-nine percent Sahaja Yogis love each other.

555
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,375
My blessings to you is this -

556
00:34:49,583 --> 00:34:54,250
on this day may God give you lots of love,

557
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:58,041
and loving capacity within you,

558
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,333
that you should have,

559
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,250
which will change your life completely

560
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:06,709
and you'll become such a powerful personality,

561
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,834
very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

562
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:14,208
You can do marvels and miracles

563
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:19,208
if you have developed the understanding of love.

564
00:35:20,709 --> 00:35:22,208
May God bless you
