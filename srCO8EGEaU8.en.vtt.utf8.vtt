00:00.640 --> 00:08.040
This is the quality of a person like carbon has got four valences you have got these ten valences

00:09.000 --> 00:10.020
and

00:10.030 --> 00:16.020
If these valances are missing then what happens that, as in the combination of chemical combinations

00:16.020 --> 00:19.770
you have seen if one valence is missing it becomes a negative and then

00:20.439 --> 00:24.509
It combines with that. So there are negative and positive balances

00:24.730 --> 00:27.930
So if you have some additional valences with you

00:27.930 --> 00:32.880
Then you jump on to other people if you have less then you catch from other people

00:32.880 --> 00:37.220
It's exactly the same as it happens in a chemical compound

00:37.440 --> 00:44.760
Now these valences within us are to be there to give us a balance, and that's what Warren has told you what it means.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.860
When you get your realization your dharma

00:49.140 --> 00:54.220
Your ten commandments get enlightened means you get empowered

00:55.120 --> 00:57.620
You become that.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.860
You go beyond religion. You don't have to follow it. Just become you become so integrated for example,

01:07.180 --> 01:13.340
some people it does it so to have say potatoes. They will just not like it just don't like it

01:14.200 --> 01:19.740
Before realize it's just the other way now [if] they are not supposed to eat potatoes they'll eat potatoes more

01:20.220 --> 01:25.560
After realization won't just have it, you won't have it. You are so integrated

01:26.440 --> 01:30.700
The sustainance within us gets so enlightened

01:31.000 --> 01:37.240
that our priorities change completely. We start judging everything on vibrations

01:38.320 --> 01:41.280
Now we have a little girl here you've seen - olympia

01:41.500 --> 01:49.100
She eats very little, practically solid food she does not eat, but if I give her anything to eat she will eat

01:49.360 --> 01:54.140
From nobody else, but if I give her anything, she'll ask for more anything

01:54.400 --> 01:57.680
It's surprising she understands vibrations

01:59.940 --> 02:07.820
If you understand vibrations, then it is very easy to retain your valencies intact

02:07.960 --> 02:09.960
Because you are empowered

02:10.100 --> 02:15.820
Not only that, but you just don't like anything else because you like the vibrations to flow

02:15.940 --> 02:20.000
When the vibrations are flowing the spirit is emitting

02:20.360 --> 02:24.060
through your Central Nervous system the Joy

02:24.280 --> 02:32.400
That is the quality of your spirit. The joy you start feeling and when you start feeling the joy

02:32.900 --> 02:38.120
Then you don't want to give up. for anything. Just don't want to give up. you want to enjoy
