00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.460
Shri Krishna resides in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.800
In the centre, He resides as Shri Krishna.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.000
On the left hand side, His power, Vishnumaya,
His sister, resides.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.330
There He resides as Gopala, as the one who
lived in Gokul, played as a child.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:42.620
On the right hand side He resides as the King
who ruled in Dwarika, the King Shri Krishna.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.580
These are the three sides of our Vishuddhi
chakra.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:04:01.020
The people who use their right side to dominate
others, use their voice to put down people,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:10.440
to show their authority, shout at people,
are the people who get affected by the right

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.850
side.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:21.380
When the right side is caught up, on the physical
side, you get a very big problem because the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.780
right heart cannot work out its flow.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:37.180
So you get what you call asthma and all these
diseases, but specially when the right heart

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.410
is affected by the father’s problem.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.070
On the left side is the Vishnumaya, is the
sisterly relationship.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:05:04.600
When the sister, who is your pure relation,
is not treated as a sister, when the attitude

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:15.500
of a person towards women is of indulgence
and of lust, then he develops the Left Vishuddhi.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:25.030
When he develops the Left Vishuddhi very strongly,
and if he has a bad Agnya, or if he has eyes

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:31.030
which are roving eyes, then this Left Vishuddhi
causes lot of trouble.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.900
Left Vishuddhi can be also caused by, as you
know, by feeling guilty about things for nothing

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.120
at all.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.970
All these problems arise from Vishuddhi.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.150
But Vishuddhi chakra has a speciality.

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:56.680
When the human beings raised their head upward,
from Mother Earth towards the sky – sky

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:03.960
is, ether is Shri Krishna’s nature – when
it raised its head towards the ether, towards

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:12.870
the sky, then this Vishuddhi chakra developed
into a different dimension and people started

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.370
developing their ego and superego.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:21.240
Superego was already developed, but ego developed
in such a way that it started suppressing

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.240
the superego.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.669
That’s how you have got conditionings on
one side of the Vishuddhi and ego on the other

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:30.669
side.

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:36.430
When I told you the other day that you give
up your free will, in the sense that when

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:43.130
you raised your head, you did it through your
free will, with your power of growing that

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.770
you had as animals.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:52.550
After that, now you have reached to the human
level and to rise above the human level, now,

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.851
[what] you have to do is to seek your complete
freedom and for that, Vishuddhi chakra is

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:01.930
going to help you a lot.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.070
On this Vishuddhi chakra, we have to really
pay full attention.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.200
It is such a complicated chakra.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:22.080
It has all the vowels of a Devanagari script
emitting out of the sound of the Shakti that

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.220
is passing through it, of the Kundalini that
is passing through it.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:33.050
So all the vowels are heard on these chakras.

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:38.670
These vowels are, as you know, 16 in number.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:46.080
Without the vowel in the Devanagari, you cannot
write anything.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:59.590
Vowels are the sustenance, are the power that
supports every consonant.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:10.260
So it’s very important that our vowels have
to be fully nourished and respected.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:18.650
The movement of the neck, as you have seen,
in all international life, if you see, everybody

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.950
has practically the same.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:26.970
Even those who cannot hear, those who do not
understand your language, you can nod like

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:33.960
this, can say no like this, everyone understands
this is ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:39.810
In some particular area, of course, they have
little different type of nodding.

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:43.770
But too much of nodding of head is not a very
good sign.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:49.320
I have seen people in the West, if you tell
them something, to show that they have appreciated

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.839
it, they’ll go on … (Shri Mataji nods
Her head a few times) for quite some time.

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:59.890
That’s not necessary.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:04.390
Just have to say, “All right” or “I’ve
understood it“, that’s all.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.350
You have to use your voice instead of nodding
like this all the time.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.130
It’s very bad, very, very bad for the Vishuddhi
chakra.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.399
Or some of them are the other way round.

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:20.649
That whatever it is, they’ll put up their
head like this … and they won’t talk properly,

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:23.730
they will not say a word, they’ll just keep
quiet.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.350
You may go on pinching them, doing anything,
they won’t budge.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:34.570
This kind of personality is also very much
detrimental to the growth of their evolution.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:41.190
Apart from that, their Vishuddhi becomes a
very big problem.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.959
Because of Vishuddhi, there are so many problems.

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:45.840
Like angina, you develop because of Vishuddhi.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.470
You develop spondylitis because of Vishuddhi.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.940
Sometimes people lose their voices completely.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.020
Sometimes, they have all the time coughing.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.830
And there are so many physical problems out
of Vishuddhi because, as I said, it’s a

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:09.390
very, very complicated centre, which looks
after your ear, nose, throat, all the sixteen

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:14.210
sub-plexuses are there, which are looked after
by this centre.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:18.680
But above all, is the centre of discrimination.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.600
The centre of discrimination only comes when
you are free people.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:29.360
Till you are biased, till you have your own
concepts, you cannot be discreet.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:36.890
And that’s the one point where, one must
understand that to achieve your complete freedom,

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.330
you have to get your Vishuddhi chakra cleared
out.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:47.410
First and foremost thing is, that we must
speak in a sweet manner.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:55.130
Speak to someone in a sweet manner, not artificially,
but sweetly.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:59.010
Speak in a manner that another person likes
it.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:03.560
‘satyam vadet priyam vadet’ (meaning:
speak the truth, speak that which pleases).

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.560
Speak the truth.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560
Don’t tell the lies.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.470
If you go on telling lies, after some time
even if you tell the truth, it will become

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.470
a lie.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:20.540
But if you are telling the truth, that, even
if you tell a lie, it becomes a truth.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:32.800
Now, some people think that they can be cunning,
by their talks, they can cheat people, but

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.420
actually, they are cheating themselves.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:44.920
All such people who cheat others by sweet
talks, by artificial talks, or by some manoeuvring,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:51.840
go to such a horrible state, and in this Kali
Yuga, especially, they are cursed and they

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:58.350
get exposed and people know about them, that
these are the greatest liars ever known.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:05.990
Now the times are coming when all such people
will be exposed very much more than they have

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:08.150
been ever exposed.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:13.860
So be careful, not to think that you can cheat.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.790
In Sahaja Yoga, especially, you cannot cheat.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.700
Those who try to cheat sometimes think that,
“We can befool Mother, we can somehow or

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.800
other carry on.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.130
If we sit in front of Mother, She won’t
know what we are up to.”

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:29.450
It’s not so.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:34.530
I may not say, I may use My discretion not
to say.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.990
I may allow you to have a long way.

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.540
But be careful, do not come into My illusions.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:49.960
I’m very elusive, and when I play My illusions,
you will suddenly find yourself in a very

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:55.320
difficult situation, and then you will say
“Mother, why am I in this situation?”

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.610
So this is one of the qualities of Shri Krishna.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.090
That He is the one who becomes elusive.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:07.680
In His elusiveness – not cunning, but elusive
– in His elusiveness, He exposes people

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.810
to themselves.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:16.730
There are so many stories of Shri Krishna
in which He has elusively acted to give greater

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:23.080
joy to some people, to give nice lessons to
some people, and sometimes to punish you.

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:30.530
For us it is important that we are sahaja
yogis.

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:39.630
In this lifetime, we have a chance – our
Kundalini has risen – that we can face ourselves,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:45.970
that we can correct our chakras, that we know
about ourselves, that we know where is the

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.000
problem is.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.610
I have known of people who were caught up
with Left Vishuddhis and have become devilish

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:54.610
by nature, devilish.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:59.590
They have gone out of Sahaja Yoga, they have
criticised Sahaja Yoga, they have tried to

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.390
trouble Me a lot.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:06.340
So don’t think that, if Vishuddhi is spoiled,
there’s nothing so special about it.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.040
It can be a very dangerous centre.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.980
Of course, Heart, Agnya and Vishuddhi, these
three centres, one has to guard against, because

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:29.980
three of them can allow you, or can force
you, to become one with identification of

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.100
evil as your own.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:39.280
You might just feel that it’s nice to be
evil.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:47.300
You might just feel that it is a great fun
to be evil, and you might become evil.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.100
So, at the Vishuddhi chakra, one has to be
extremely careful.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:58.529
Vishuddhi chakra looks after so many things,
specially your skin, your eyes.

00:14:58.529 --> 00:15:05.730
Skin is now, I have seen people who have bad
Vishuddhi, can have all kinds of funny troubles

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.730
with their skins.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:16.529
Of course it has to do with your liver, but
skin is, the way it shines, the way it glows,

00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:22.290
depends on how you smile, how you look at
the world.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:28.190
Many people have a habit of smiling for nothing
at all, especially women I have seen, ladies

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.800
I have seen, they just smile stupidly.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.920
That’s not proper.

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.210
One should not be stupid.

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:40.620
Stupidity is against Shri Krishna’s principle.

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:46.340
Like, you have seen the stupid people, how
they are.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.990
Their tongue is always half way out.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:58.170
If you have noticed a stupid man, his face
is that, his tongue is always out, mouth half

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:02.070
open and he looks like a dumbfounded fool.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:07.610
Now in this only the Vishuddhi plays the part.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:14.410
Another one is the one where you get the Vishuddhi’s
strains.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:23.980
So such a person has very pursed lips, angry
lips, and he doesn’t talk.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:34.100
The another one might even get the expression
of an idiot but could be just making a face

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.830
like that.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:52.670
Because, if he’s cunning, he may take a,
I would say, a kind of a rupa (form), a mask

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:59.860
on his face, that he is an idiot and may try
to deceive you.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:04.179
So nothing is definite about Vishuddhi.

00:17:04.179 --> 00:17:09.860
Whatever may be the expression of a person
– a person may look very innocent, because

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:12.691
that’s the thing you can do with your Vishuddhi.

00:17:12.691 --> 00:17:16.551
You are free because you have raised your
head, at this point you have achieved this

00:17:16.551 --> 00:17:24.430
kind of a special aptitude, that you can deceive
yourself and you can deceive others.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.919
Some people look extremely innocent on the
face.

00:17:26.919 --> 00:17:34.190
They may look to be very simple people, but
may turn out to be horrid.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:39.080
Some people may look to be idiotic but may
be very intelligent.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:46.480
So it is how you play with your Vishuddhi,
which is responsible, but the main thing what

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.730
I’m trying to tell you, that you can manoeuvre
your Vishuddhi.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:57.190
The way you want to put your expression, the
way you want to make your face, the way you

00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:02.370
want to suggest something – all [these]
you can manoeuvre and you can keep your heart

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:03.370
away from it.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:09.390
In the heart, you may have poison for a person
but outwardly you may say to that person in

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:13.760
a very sweet manner something that the person
might feel impressed.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:21.560
But in this, all this behaviour, pattern of
behaviour, you are deceiving your Self, not

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:27.240
deceiving the another person, because your
Self is Spirit which knows you very well.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:34.929
And this will go on and on for all your lives
that have to come.

00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:39.910
So there is no need, in any way, to be artificial
in your expression.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.779
There is no need to hide anything in your
expression.

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:49.420
Of course, I mean, if you don’t like someone,
you need not just say, “I don’t like you“.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:55.940
But, in that case, you have to be not also
so much appreciative of the person that he’s

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.590
deluded into your appreciation.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:07.340
Now, eyes are very important, and eyes, in
a way, are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:16.909
because the muscles of the eyes are looked
after by Vishuddhi.

00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:23.270
Now the kind of muscles we have, which pull
our eyes, which close our eyelids and all

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.830
that, is very much suggestive.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:31.440
You must notice that there are some people
who come to Me, their eyes go on like this

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.230
(flickering), when they close their eyes,
they cannot keep it shut.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.000
There are some people, when they open their
eyes to Me, they just keep the eyes open,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.950
they just cannot close it.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:47.240
Both are in trouble.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:54.650
The ones which are just keeping the eyes open
all the time, are the people having supra-conscious

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.679
problems.

00:19:55.679 --> 00:20:01.429
And those who are flickering their eyes are
having the sub-conscious problem.

00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:08.730
Some people have also the habit of keeping
the eyes in an angle all the time, they never

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.660
see you straight but in an angle they’ll
see you (laughter).

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.930
They think it’s sometimes, it’s very fashionable,
sometimes.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.750
Ladies think it’s a very good way of looking
at people.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:26.650
And some of them have such eyes that they’ll
go on, you know, looking and pouring their

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:31.620
greedy eyes onto others, or their lusty eyes
onto others.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:38.130
This is the worst thing you can do to your
eyes because such people easily can become

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:46.230
blind, such people might have trouble of the
eyes, specially reddening of the eyes can

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:50.380
come to such people, very much, very quickly.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:57.460
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes
very pure, the eyes of an Yogeshwara, who

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.120
was Shri Krishna.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.350
He was a witness.

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:06.960
He was on this earth, He played with Radha.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.670
He married five women, they were the Five
Elements.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:16.130
Sixteen thousand women He married – they
were His sixteen thousand Powers.

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:20.180
But He was Yogeshwara, He was Yogeshwara.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.530
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about
them at all.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.420
He was beyond that.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.100
He was Yogeshwara.

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.340
That was the testing point of His, that He
had no lust in His eyes about these women

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.460
that He had.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.659
Such an Yogeshwara is there.

00:21:36.659 --> 00:21:40.020
Of course, I don’t expect you to be Shri
Krishna.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:47.360
But you have your wife, those who do not have
wife must look forward to a wife.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:53.540
That, “We’ll get wives and we’ll have
a wife, ” and think of a wife who will be

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:59.309
your own, so that your eyes will not fall
onto every woman who comes across with that

00:21:59.309 --> 00:22:00.590
kind of a thing.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.350
I have seen people, even the photographs or
anything they see, it’s surprising!

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.620
I mean there’s nothing in a photograph,
what is in a photograph?

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.620
But even a photograph can attract their attention.

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:15.170
I mean, I don’t know what can attract their
attention like this but they are so vulnerable

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.530
and they have no control over their eyes,
no control.

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.210
They become absolutely lost and they have
no control.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:27.670
That shows that they have no powers in them
and they are slaves of their responses.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.680
So the eyes are very, very important.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.790
As Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have
adulterous eyes“.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:37.860
There should be no adultery.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.490
Some people have a habit of showing anger
with the eyes.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:46.110
You see, if they have to show anger they’ll
just go on looking like this and show the

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.110
anger.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:51.570
I need, dare not, do that to you but still.

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:59.090
(laughter) And the angry eyes, you see, are
another dangerous things to do, with your

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.559
eyes, because then they can become mesmeric.

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:07.220
If you start putting your eyes onto something
and concentrating on it, your eyes might become

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.860
mesmeric, means bhoots will start coming out
of your eyes.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.390
First of all, you’ll catch bhoots in your
eyes, they’ll settle down there and then

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.240
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:25.330
It’s a very, very dangerous thing, to go
on looking at something continuously with

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.330
concentration.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:33.090
There’s another kind of a stupid thing,
or a bhootish thing maybe, that people ask

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:35.970
you to meditate here (at Agnya), it’s absolutely
wrong.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:39.670
[Even though] in Gita it is written, still
it is wrong.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.900
Nobody should put attention here.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.320
If they have to put attention, put attention
at the door.

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.309
What’s the use of looking at a window?

00:23:49.309 --> 00:23:51.380
You can’t get out of it, can you?

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.950
If you have to look at anything, be on the
lookout for the door.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.380
And the door is here.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:03.059
The door of Sahastrara is to be opened out,
so you should not try to concentrate on this

00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:04.370
part.

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:08.630
Many people who have concentrated on this
part have become mad.

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:14.420
When they become mad, people say “He’s
a Yogi, but has got unmanitasha” – that

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.110
he moves like a madcap.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:18.960
How can a Yogi be a madcap?

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:25.770
That means he’s united with God, is He mad?

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.530
All such mad people are really mad!

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.320
They have nothing to do with God, definitely.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.450
But, there are people who believe in such
things – “Oh, he is in love with God,

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:40.300
so he just jumps on the stage and goes into
ecstasy, dances like a madcap.”

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.280
How can God be mad?

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:46.740
First position is this, that the sanest personality
is God.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.740
Has to be.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.070
From where do the sanity comes in?

00:24:52.070 --> 00:25:00.110
So, this is one thing one has to understand,
that any such practices can lead you to lunacy,

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.929
and one should not do it.

00:25:02.929 --> 00:25:10.780
Thirdly, the indiscretion that one has, comes
from people who are good hearted, nice people,

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:18.730
but they get carried away by the smiles of
others or by the artificial goodness they

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.420
show on their faces.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:28.691
I’ve known some people, they always have
a face, like this, as if they are all the

00:25:28.691 --> 00:25:29.691
time smiling.

00:25:29.691 --> 00:25:34.131
(Shri Mataji tries to demonstrate) I mean,
I can’t do that way.

00:25:34.131 --> 00:25:35.131
All the time, if you look at somebody like
this, you see, it means as if you are mocking

00:25:35.131 --> 00:25:36.670
at the person.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:42.600
And there are people I have seen who are just
like this every time (a small child laughs),

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.260
and then like this!

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.260
(Mother laughs).

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.690
So, one should not be always in one pose.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:54.340
Sometimes these muscles can get very weak
and start paining if you take one [pose].

00:25:54.340 --> 00:26:02.700
There are some others who always try to show
that they are very miserable.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.830
I don’t know, what do they want to attract?

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:08.801
Attract the attention of others?

00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:12.240
Attract the bhoots in themselves or, I don’t
know, what are they up to?

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.520
Why can’t they keep a normal face?

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:20.380
Even while sitting in dhyan , or meditation,
I have seen them, trying to show Me, or whatever

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.540
it is, because My eyes are mostly closed,
but doesn’t matter.

00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:26.710
When I open My eyes, I find some people like
this, like that (looking at Her smiling).

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:27.710
Why?

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.270
What is the need?

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:31.420
(laughter)

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.640
You have to have a balanced face.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:37.350
That’s what Shri Krishna has described the
stitha pragnya (the witness state), the one

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.870
who is balanced.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:45.150
Who doesn’t laugh like an idiot.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.200
Who laughs, but not like an idiot!

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:51.270
Nor is a serious [type], like another kind
of an idiot!

00:26:51.270 --> 00:27:00.450
So, both the things are not at all expression
of your inner being.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:07.660
Such a person is, as I told you today, is
not frivolous, but not serious either.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.540
But full of joy within himself.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:18.170
He doesn’t want you to be unhappy, never
would like that you should be unhappy people.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:22.679
But human beings, if they want to be unhappy,
what can anybody help, because they have got

00:27:22.679 --> 00:27:24.490
the free will to be unhappy.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:29.990
They have got a free will to cut their nose,
they have a free will to cut their ears, they

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.480
have free will to commit suicide.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.060
They have this free will, so-called.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:42.090
Now, the greatest free will comes from Vishuddhi
chakra, as I told you.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.810
And that’s why we call Him Yogeshwara.

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:51.130
He is the Ishwara of Yoga.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:57.880
The establishment of yoga is possible when
you surrender yourself to Shri Krishna.

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.940
[When you] completely surrender yourself to
Shri Krishna your yoga will be established.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:02.940
Means what?

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.540
Means all your balances will be established.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:17.510
You go into complete balance, and that balance
is complete because Vishnu, Who is the incarnation

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:25.620
for sustaining the dharma, Who is responsible
for giving you the balance, becomes complete

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.700
in the form of Shri Krishna.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:34.300
That’s why is said that you leave all the
dharmas – “Sarva dharmanam parityaja,

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.850
mamekam sharanam vraja”.

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:40.000
That’s why “Surrender all of them to Me”.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.770
So all the dharmas, if you put it at the lotus
feet of Shri Krishna, means, if you follow

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:51.450
His ideals, then all your dharmas are balanced.

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:57.049
But, after realisation, you go beyond dharma.

00:28:57.049 --> 00:29:04.370
Whenever you go wrong in dharma – dharma
achyuta, as they call it – when you go wrong

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:10.140
in dharma, that’s the time you have to surrender
yourself to Shri Krishna, so that He establishes

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:11.140
your dharma.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:14.320
There are so many dharmas.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:21.200
There is the ‘pati dharm’ – husband’s
dharma, ‘patni dharma’ – wife’s dharma,

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:26.380
father’s dharma, mother’s dharma, son’s
dharmas, then ‘rashta dharma’ means ‘the

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:27.380
nation’s dharma’.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:36.830
Then you have all kinds of dharmas also, we
can say, where one has to bow to the higher

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.970
things of life.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:47.540
But then He says ‘Sarva dharmanam parityaja’
– ‘Forget all the dharmas’ , ‘mamekam

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:53.850
sharanam vraja’ – ‘Just surrender your
dharmas, all of them to Me’.

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.440
That is at Vishuddhi.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.410
At Vishuddhi chakra you surrender all your
other dharmas.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:06.770
It means that it all gets sublimated.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:10.430
It all gets complete.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:20.620
The wholesomeness is achieved because He is
[the] Collective Being, He is the Viraat,

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:30.880
because He is the integrated form of all the
dharmas and He is the Viraata in our brain,

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.809
He represents our brain.

00:30:33.809 --> 00:30:40.990
And when this Viraata, in us, is awakened
fully, then all the dharmas become natural

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.990
with us.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.400
We don’t have to do any dharmas.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:50.650
We don’t have to be conscious of any dharmas,
but automatically we become dharma ourselves.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:58.210
For example, there are people, now say Christ
– we can take example of Christ.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.350
He was dharma personified.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:03.900
He would not steal money from anybody, will
He?

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:08.400
Will He run away with somebody’s wife?

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.690
Will He?

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.900
Will He do anything wrong?

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.830
No, He cannot.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:15.830
Why?

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.040
Because He was dharma.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.610
So, now you have become dharmateet – means,
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.970
Into the Viraata’s conditions.

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:31.610
And there, your condition is such, that your
state is such, your state is such, that you

00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:33.710
are dharma.

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:38.100
If you try to do Adharma, you’ll suffer.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.130
If you try to do wrong, you’ll suffer.

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:43.370
Here, I don’t have to tell you to be righteous.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.480
I don’t have to tell you, there’s no need.

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:46.660
I don’t have to tell you that you tell the
truth.

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.750
I don’t have to tell you don’t steal.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.809
I don’t have to do all these things.

00:31:52.809 --> 00:31:59.950
Only thing I can tell you, that get rid of
your ego and superego, that’s all.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:04.460
In a very general terminology.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.110
But you will follow Christ automatically.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:10.059
You will follow Krishna automatically – sahaj.

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:16.740
Because now you have gone beyond dharma, you
have crossed the limits of dharma where you

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.620
had to follow a dharma.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.830
Now you have become the dharma.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:26.549
Where you will stand, wherever you will be,
dharma will stand with you.

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:31.670
People will look at you and say, “Here is
a dharma standing.

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:34.190
He is the dharma to be worshipped“.

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:45.900
Not because of anything, but because your
state is that of dharma, [and] you have gone

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:46.900
beyond that.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.930
Supposing this is the loudspeaker I am using
today, to talk to you.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.780
But supposing this loudspeaker becomes part
and parcel of me, I don’t have to use this

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.830
(Mother taps microphone), I go beyond it.

00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:01.700
In the same way, you are using the dharma
first of all to establish yourself, but when

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:10.080
you go beyond dharma into this state of Viraata,
then you don’t need any dharma.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.250
You become the dharma of Viraat.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:15.110
Now, what is the dharma of Viraata?

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:18.650
What is the dharma of Shri Krishna?

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:20.450
Is collectivity.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:27.510
Krishna is the brain.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:31.940
Shiva is the heart.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.940
And Brahmadeva is the liver.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:43.410
Now, what’s the faculty of this brain is
that the Tree of Life, of evolution, grows

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:47.330
downward, as He says.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:53.010
And this tree is growing downwards, of awareness
from the brain.

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:57.970
But, if you have to go to the roots, you have
to ascend.

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:02.790
And that ascent you have achieved, now you
have gone to the roots of your brain, where

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:07.580
all your roots are enlightened, all your nerves
are enlightened, your brain is enlightened,

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:10.280
you are an enlightened person.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:20.289
When you are in darkness, you may catch hold
of a snake as rope, but when you are in light,

00:34:20.289 --> 00:34:21.419
you will drop it.

00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:24.270
In the same way, when you become enlightened,
your dharma is in light.

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:29.559
You don’t have to take to any guru or to
any book or to anyone – you know yourself,

00:34:29.559 --> 00:34:33.859
in your own light, that this is wrong.

00:34:33.859 --> 00:34:37.589
Now the collectivity part of it’s very important.

00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:43.129
Anybody who cannot be collective is not yet
a sahaja yogi.

00:34:43.129 --> 00:34:45.579
Not yet a sahaja yogi at all.

00:34:45.579 --> 00:34:51.510
Collective in the sense that, anybody who
cannot live with other sahaja yogis, who tries

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:56.780
to find faults with someone all the time,
who wants to run away with his wife and stay

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:03.380
somewhere else or with her husband, who wants
to get out, is not a person who is collective.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:09.280
There’s no need to say that, “I cannot
live under the circumstances in which sahaja

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.640
yogis can live.”

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.460
If you’re a sahaja yogi, if you are a yogi,
you can live.

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.700
Look at Me, I am such an old woman, I can
live anywhere.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:22.270
You take Me to a village, you take Me to any
place, I’m not bothered about any physical

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:27.950
comforts at all, because I am comfortable
within Myself.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:30.220
My comforts are within Myself.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:36.090
In the same way, a person who is not collective
… like many people just come to pujas, that’s

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:37.090
all.

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:40.850
It’s like going to the church only once
in Christmas, and they’ll say, “Christ

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:41.850
doesn’t look after us.”

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:46.800
Of course, we’re not going to church, and
you don’t meet Christ, but I mean to say

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:51.240
that, just to have a casual way of Sahaja
Yoga, you cannot gain.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.950
You have to be collective, and collective
means that at every collective program, you

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:57.980
should be there.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:03.270
You should always meet collectively, meditate
collectively, live collectively and try to

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:06.250
find ways and methods of being collective.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:11.140
There are so many evil forces, which are all
the time trying to attack collectivity.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.770
First they will attack the leaders.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:15.520
That’s the first thing.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:20.560
Any leader tells somebody, “You shouldn’t
do like this“, immediately that person will

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.840
start spreading stories against that leader:
“He’s very bad.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.910
He’s like this, he’s very harsh.

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:28.360
He didn’t garland me, he didn’t give me
this, that…”

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.950
How can you garland a bhoot?

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.349
Can you?

00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:40.740
Then, if that doesn’t work out, then they
have their sly methods of going round, and

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:46.010
talking something here and there in the ears,
to create some sort of a politics.

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:54.450
All such people will be thrown out of Sahaja
Yoga, as there is a centrifugal and a centripetal

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:57.000
force – both acting equal and opposite.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.330
Anybody who goes against collectivity, who
sticks to their bhoots, sticks to their negativity,

00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:07.000
will have to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:16.579
And that is to be remembered – that to be
collective is to be joyous, is to be progressive,

00:37:16.579 --> 00:37:17.579
to be going further.

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:23.249
It was all right when people were meditating
in the Himalayas, it was all right at that

00:37:23.249 --> 00:37:29.500
time, they were all alone, meditating all
alone to achieve something for the collective.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.900
But they also did not get their realisation.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:41.560
When you have got your realisation – remember
this – now you have entered into the Kingdom

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:50.140
of God, into the Kingdom of Viraat, where
you are a part and parcel of a collective

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.140
being.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.990
You are not alone.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:58.229
You cannot be singled out, you cannot separate
yourself.

00:37:58.229 --> 00:38:04.739
Now you are awakened in the body of Viraata
and you cannot get out of it.

00:38:04.739 --> 00:38:07.619
If you try to get out of it, you cannot be
nourished.

00:38:07.619 --> 00:38:12.270
Supposing I take out part of My body, will
it be nourished by this body?

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.359
It won’t be!

00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:18.860
In the same way, you have now become part
and parcel of that collectivity, and that

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.830
collectivity, that Viraat, is going to look
after you, going to nourish you, going to

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:30.509
do everything that is necessary for your spiritual,
physical, mental, emotional, even financial

00:38:30.509 --> 00:38:31.839
development.

00:38:31.839 --> 00:38:42.680
But, if you cut it short, if you try to block
the collectivity, if you try to make problems

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:48.269
for collectivity or even if you try just to
get out of the collectivity, then that is

00:38:48.269 --> 00:38:51.730
not our interest, that is not our work.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:39:03.140
This is to be understood, fully, in every
way possible, and this when is understood,

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:11.750
in a proper way you should know that collectivity
is not only your advancement, is not only

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:21.880
your development, is not only your achievements,
is the achievement of the whole humanity.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:31.990
The purpose of your creation is fulfilled
by that.

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:38.660
Those people who live in the ashram are better
off, always, than the people who live alone.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.730
Always.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:46.950
They will always have better results than
the people who live alone.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:52.099
Maybe they live alone because they want to
have a little private life, or a privacy,

00:39:52.099 --> 00:39:55.970
but their privacy is not going to help them.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:59.200
That’s not going to help them at all.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:05.579
The more you live together, the more you reside
together, the more you enjoy together – there

00:40:05.579 --> 00:40:10.119
will be greater chances of your advancement.

00:40:10.119 --> 00:40:15.180
The more you will try to make yourself private,
the more you’ll try to get out of it – whatever

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.619
explanation you may give – God understands
you very well.

00:40:19.619 --> 00:40:26.170
So, all such things where you cut off yourself
from the mainstream, you try to get out of

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:31.980
the mainstream, then there is a big problem
for you.

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.890
Of course, for certain conveniences, you may.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.529
For your certain understanding, you may.

00:40:38.529 --> 00:40:45.789
But, you should enjoy more the company of
sahaja yogis than your own private company

00:40:45.789 --> 00:40:48.519
in the dingy room of yours.

00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:55.640
That is one thing you can judge yourself [on]:
do you enjoy the company of sahaja yogis or

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:01.299
you enjoy the company of three, four of your
family people, together in a circus?

00:41:01.299 --> 00:41:05.220
The judgement is your own.

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.200
Sahaja yogi: “Not difficult Shri Mataji”

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.540
Shri Mataji: Nothing is difficult in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:19.690
It is the simplest thing to be a sahaja yogi
and even more simple to be collective.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:23.599
To be uncollective, you have to do something.

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:31.029
Like I said that, it is very easy not to drink,
I mean drink some wines and things, because

00:41:31.029 --> 00:41:34.479
if you don’t want to drink, you are sitting
at home – is all right, don’t have to

00:41:34.479 --> 00:41:35.479
do anything.

00:41:35.479 --> 00:41:38.880
But supposing you have to drink, then you
have to go to a pub, or you have to go [to]

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.460
somebody, open the bottle, get a particular
type of a glass, pour it down, this, that.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:49.960
In India, for example, where there is prohibition,
you are sitting with a fright.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.140
But for a person who just drinks water, he
doesn’t have to do anything.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:42:03.759
So, to do wrong, one has to do something,
but to be good, you don’t have to do much

00:42:03.759 --> 00:42:10.119
– is absolutely labour saving, energy saving
person.

00:42:10.119 --> 00:42:12.970
(laughing)

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:20.119
You see, to do bad, supposing, you see, I
want to harm somebody, I’ll have to go out

00:42:20.119 --> 00:42:21.729
of the way to find out ways, methods.

00:42:21.729 --> 00:42:26.339
If I have to tell lies, I have to think of
ten lies to cover that one lie.

00:42:26.339 --> 00:42:27.369
But if I tell the truth, finished!

00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:28.859
I have told the truth, finished!

00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:29.859
With few words, it’s done.

00:42:29.859 --> 00:42:35.549
So, to be collective is much more easier.

00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:42.210
Of course, not for crooked people, because
crooked people, wherever they move their angularities

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:48.369
trouble others, you see, like poking of thorns.

00:42:48.369 --> 00:42:56.140
But those who are flowers, they fit in anywhere,
people like them, they like their fragrance,

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:59.430
they look at them, they enjoy them.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.430
Beautiful things.

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:04.130
Now, see, today they are looking like lotuses.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:05.130
How is it?

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.829
Without doing anything, they have become lotuses.

00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:09.019
How?

00:43:09.019 --> 00:43:11.349
How they have become like lotuses?

00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:17.490
Whether they are lotuses or they are daisies,
God alone knows.

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.849
But they have become lotuses – Sahaj.

00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:20.849
How?

00:43:20.849 --> 00:43:24.469
Because they are one with God.

00:43:24.469 --> 00:43:32.269
When we stand in our own way, when we try
to do something privately, then God says,

00:43:32.269 --> 00:43:43.309
“All right, go private!” (laughter) But
when we are public, He looks after us.

00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:55.329
And then, in Sahaja Yoga, as you know, that
collective growth is the only way we understand

00:43:55.329 --> 00:43:58.119
Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:58.119 --> 00:44:01.710
Somebody knows something, somebody knows something
else, somebody knows something else.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:08.890
When we are collective then we really understand
every aspect of Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:14.339
Supposing there is somebody, a scientist,
somebody’s a musician, somebody is another

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:15.339
thing.

00:44:15.339 --> 00:44:17.249
We cannot know everything.

00:44:17.249 --> 00:44:21.700
So you know something from this one, something
from that one, something from there.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:26.500
So all the rivers, as they flow into that
collectivity and you enjoy the ocean of all

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.280
these other things.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:32.839
You don’t have to go to all the rivers in
India – like you go from Ganga, Yamuna,

00:44:32.839 --> 00:44:45.109
Saraswati, Kaveri, thousands of miles – go
to the sea, all of them are there! (laughter)

00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:49.359
Like that, you have to enjoy the sea, where
everything is.

00:44:49.359 --> 00:44:54.469
All kinds of beautiful things are there and
you enjoy that.

00:44:54.469 --> 00:45:02.549
I hope this puja – which is a very remarkable
puja … Firstly, so many things are Sahaj.

00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:10.009
Firstly, they told me the telephone number
of this place is ‘32 16 32’.

00:45:10.009 --> 00:45:17.719
And He’s accompanied by 64 Yoginis – Shri
Krishna, so 32 on this side and 32 on that

00:45:17.719 --> 00:45:21.989
side with Him, sitting [in the middle] with
them.

00:45:21.989 --> 00:45:25.479
This place is called as ‘Black Lake’.

00:45:25.479 --> 00:45:28.209
Krishna is black.

00:45:28.209 --> 00:45:35.229
This place they got suddenly, and this is
the only place in this so-called military

00:45:35.229 --> 00:45:40.739
regime of Switzerland where people can sleep
on the ground.

00:45:40.739 --> 00:45:43.459
You are not supposed to sleep on the ground.

00:45:43.459 --> 00:45:51.220
If there’s no cot, you hang in the air but
you cannot touch the ground.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.650
That kind of a stupid military business is
here!

00:45:53.650 --> 00:46:02.109
They had to find such a sensible, practical,
such a cheap place for you, is [a] Godsend.

00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:05.290
We are here surrounded by beautiful things.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:12.430
With the cows – so many cows, at the time
when it is Krishna’s birthday.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:14.460
So many cows, so fond of cows.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:20.910
And the cows, when their bells move – in
the morning, I heard, in the evening – so

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:21.910
beautiful.

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:27.079
And when they are moving home in the evening,
how the – as they call goraj, is the dust

00:46:27.079 --> 00:46:29.529
of their feet – was filling the sky.

00:46:29.529 --> 00:46:32.380
Is just Gokul here, I felt.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:41.680
Today also, there’s one thing more one has
to say, that it’s the 16th Shri Krishna

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.290
Puja.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:51.969
So, in so many ways, this is a very great
puja which you are attending, for which people

00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:59.450
have to take thousands and thousand of janmas
(births), do so many punyas, which you have

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:03.479
got so Sahaj, because there must be something
about you people also.

00:47:03.479 --> 00:47:04.539
May God Bless you.
