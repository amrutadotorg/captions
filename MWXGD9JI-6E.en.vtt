00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:08.230
I bow to all the seekers of truth. It was
a thing of great joy to Me to come to Sheffield

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.160
again. Always this name Sheffield created
a kind of a mystery in My mind. The word Sheffield

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:32.759
could be the ‘She Field’ and She is the
Mother energy, the energy within you which

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.460
creates this field within you and is in the
Gita. Shri Krishna has talked about the field

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.190
that we all have a Pradesh - is the field
but Desh means the field and the enlightened

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.480
one is the Pradesh. And that same thing happens
to us when this Kundalini rises within you.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.469
This Holy Ghost which is described in the
bible, She is the Kundalini, She is the Mother.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.800
Actually people don’t know anything about
Holy Ghost and we didn’t give Christ much

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.600
chance to speak about it. He could only speak
for three and a half years, is nothing. I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.600
can tell you three and a half years in this
land anywhere in the whole world it’s so

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.580
difficult even to convince four people that
they have to seek the truth, it’s very difficult.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.530
Especially in the land where He was born.
It was full of ignorance, complete ignorance.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.530
And in that ignorance to speak about realization,
to speak about second birth, even to speak

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.840
about God was so difficult. And He was just
crucified for nothing at all, today we may

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.670
have big organizations in His name but when
He lived nobody listened to Him and they crucified

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.670
Him. He talked about Holy Ghost but this Holy
Ghost had been interpreted by people in various

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.840
ways. They’ve never been able to say what
is this Holy Ghost but logically you can come

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.859
to some conclusion yourselves because you’re
all intelligent people.

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:35.859
We talk about the Father, all right, and then
the Son. Have you heard of a father producing

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:43.349
a son? You have to have the Mother. It’s
the Mother who creates the Son. Now why this

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.420
Holy Ghost was kept as a secret, never talked
about it because Christ was afraid – not

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.749
afraid but was cautious I should say, because
such people are never afraid of anything.

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:02.749
He was cautious to talk about His Mother because
if they had harmed His Mother by any chance,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.120
then He had eleven powers of destruction and
the destruction of world would have come much

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:18.209
earlier than today. He had to play the whole
drama of His crucifixion and that’s how

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.510
He had to go through all that.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.840
In that process He didn’t want to involve
His Mother. He didn’t want to explain about

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.290
Holy Ghost and He knew that it will be later
on explained. But logically we must understand

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.829
what is this Holy Ghost we are talking about?
[A dove?] All right, it’s peace. How do

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:43.829
you get to the peace? Supposing it is the
symbol of peace. Today we see in the world

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:51.139
we see these televisions and we hear, we read
newspapers and we are shattered and so much

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.489
of friction, so much of sin. People are not
even worried about what they are doing, to

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:06.489
what extent human beings can go you can see
the way a three year-old child was molested,

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:15.150
the innocence is attacked like this. Why?
Why human beings cannot control their desires

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.380
which are so devilish? Why there is so much
of friction in this world? We have to think

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.430
about it and we must also think positively
what we can do about it.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.760
Now at the same time there are so many seekers
of truth born on this earth. This is the special

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.540
time and that’s why they are born on this
earth. But they are misled, they go to wrong

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.390
people, they get identified with wrong people.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:49.390
When I came here, the person who is organizing
Sahaja Yoga here told Me that, “Mother,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.210
they come, they get their realization and
then they disappear, they start doubting.”

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.170
I said, “That’s a good sign, it’s a
healthy sign.”

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.540
Let them doubt because the way they jump into
all these horrible things like gurus and this

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.790
and that, the way they accept as if they have
no personality, they have no discretion. The

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.540
way they jump into even drugs I don’t know,
what happens that we have lost all our personality.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.540
They took to any fashion, to any nonsense
so easily and to reality with such difficulty.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.620
We have lost our discretion that’s what
it is, but doesn’t matter whatever it is

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:36.620
use your brains. Understand that this world
is not created to be destroyed. You’re not

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.420
created out of amoeba just to be destroyed
by something nonsensical like drug(s) or some

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.070
sort of a guru; nobody has right to destroy
you. They cannot create you and they cannot

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.380
destroy you, nor you have any right to destroy
yourself because you cannot create yourself,

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.380
the one who is your Creator, the one who has
loved you who has so beautifully made this

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.120
beautiful human life is responsible. He is
the one who is so earnest about it that you

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.520
should get your realization, that you should
get your second birth, that you should be

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.740
baptized in the real sense of the word.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:28.740
I agree religions have shown funny things,
some thing so absurd that one can start doubting

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:38.130
their credibility. I admit that, but that
is the mistake of human beings not of the

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.940
divine. Divine created beautiful flowers on
the same tree of life time and time again

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.110
but when the people plucked these flowers
and said, “These are mine, these are mine.”

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:57.110
They became dead and ugly and they are fighting
now in the name of God, in the name of religion.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:04.830
Imagine, how can you do such merciless, horrible,
brutal things to other human beings but this

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:13.200
must shatter you, this must make you understand
and you should be aware.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:20.170
Get out of your sleep now and know that you
are the people who are seekers. You have to

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:26.990
be more aware, more understanding of your
responsibility. It is no use standing there

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:33.840
with a banner saying we want peace. How? The
peace has to be within. Human beings are not

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:40.450
at peace. You see in the art you see today
the art has left the Divine behind, the art

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:47.450
has become so, chaotic. The expression of
esthetics are just missing there’s no beauty

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:57.470
in it. You feel the chaotic heart of an artist
being expressed in that what he’s made,

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.770
why? Because he has lost himself.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:07.770
Now it is the responsibility of you people
living in these modern times to become that,

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:15.450
that source of peace, which is your Spirit,
and the Spirit resides within you. It is all

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:23.530
the time there it is the witness of this field
I should say the She Field, the field that

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:29.750
is to be enlightened by this Kundalini that
exists within you but is not enlightened,

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:35.289
it has not come into your attention. The Spirit
has not come into your attention, that’s

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:40.969
why we think this is all talk. There are people
who are so called intellectuals; they say

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:47.969
this is all talk, talk, talk. For a mental
conception it is impossible to tell what lies

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:56.240
beyond it because mind is a limited thing.
You have to go beyond mind; you have to be

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.550
triggered into the space to see that. The
evolution has been just like your spacecraft

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:09.550
going into the space. First, the first thing
comes up is the physical being, explodes gets

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:17.879
its accelerations then becomes your mental
being, your emotional being, your spiritual

00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:25.269
being and then it has to go to the space.
That is the time today is the space age. When

00:09:25.959 --> 00:09:32.230
we talk of the space age you think of the
space, which is beyond this gravity, there

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:39.230
is some space, which is beyond all gravities,
beyond all temptations, beyond all slaveries.

00:09:39.459 --> 00:09:44.139
We talk of our freedom, where is the freedom
I just don’t think see. Anybody comes now

00:09:44.139 --> 00:09:49.680
and says all right, have this drug for so
much money. We are finished with it. Anybody

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.759
comes and says all right, you take up your
clothes this way, live like this, we just

00:09:54.759 --> 00:10:01.759
accept without thinking, without understanding.
We have given up the traditions alright whatever

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:07.309
was wrong in the tradition should have been
given no doubt but everything if you give

00:10:07.309 --> 00:10:14.309
up then remember we are falling down. We are
coming down we are not going up. When you

00:10:14.309 --> 00:10:20.569
are going up you do not give up the staircase.
Staircase is there and you go up higher and

00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:27.569
higher. No tradition is so bad is to be discarded
but if it is so it should be discarded but

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:35.449
that is what is the discretion and that discretion
is so much lacking today that people can’t

00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:42.449
see that what we are doing collectively or
individually is not constructive.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:50.660
Now I would say that this is not the time
for us just to sit back on the fence and see

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:57.660
which side we fall. Either you will fall into
hell or you’ll go to heaven. This is the

00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:03.069
situation, we are so precariously placed,
I do not want to frighten you because there

00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:10.069
is the Spirit within you just to be enlightened,
it’s your own, it is there, it’s your

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:17.329
own property. It’s not Mine, it’s yours,
it’s your own treasure within you. Only

00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:22.740
this treasure is to be exposed to you. Now
for that how can you pay? First thing you

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:28.509
must know you cannot pay for it. If I say
that then all the gurus are after My life,

00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:33.600
they want to kill Me, they want to do all
those things. You cannot take money for God’s

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.439
work.

00:11:34.439 --> 00:11:41.379
We sold Christ, you know that. He didn’t
take any money, did He? We have got such a

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:46.269
great personality like Christ and we just
want to discard Him, make fun of Him, say

00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:52.019
all kinds of things about Him, intellectualize
Him, organize Him. You cannot touch Him. You’re

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:57.180
still human beings, you have to be the Spirit
to understand that Great Soul which came on

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.309
this earth. In the same way any other soul,
which was an Incarnation who came on this

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:09.309
earth, cannot be understood by our normal
understanding, but only a person with that

00:12:11.249 --> 00:12:17.059
pure intelligence can see this point that
I’m not satisfied with what I am, I have

00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:18.160
to go beyond.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:25.160
There’s some transformation needed and how
will this transformation take place? We can’t

00:12:25.639 --> 00:12:31.949
do anything about it because we have done
nothing to become human beings did we? What

00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:38.949
did we do to become human beings? Nothing,
so going beyond also must be built in within

00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:46.519
us. The way we became human beings there must
be some built-in process by which we will

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:54.019
become that higher being. Now the problem
at the human level is that somebody has to

00:12:54.019 --> 00:13:01.019
talk at human level. Say at the fish level,
one fish had to come up so the others could

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:09.180
follow that fish. At human level, some human
being has to tell you about it. That’s how

00:13:09.319 --> 00:13:16.319
Christ came on this earth. I mean we have
a quite a long traditional history of all

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:22.970
these great people came on this earth at different
places, at different times. According to the

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:29.970
time they had to talk. When they talked say,
about the flowers, say they talked that they

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:38.410
are Gods, like Socrates talked about Gods,
like Confucius talked about Gods. When they

00:13:38.759 --> 00:13:44.050
talked we have to please our gods we started
doubting. What god’s he’s talking about?

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:51.050
Whatever they saw we could not see, all right.
Then they thought no use talking about gods.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.720
If you talk about gods then it becomes a sort
of a worship of something that is a flower.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.300
We talk about flowers then we think we have
become God and we talk about flower all the

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:08.300
time. But we have to get to the honey. How
do we do it? So they said, “All right, don’t

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:14.459
talk about God, talk about abstract, talk
about the fragrance, talk about the honey

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:21.459
itself.” But how do you become, how do you
get to the honey? By talking about it again

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:30.050
it became a talk and talk and talk. So how
it has to happen that you have to become the

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:34.869
bee, the transformation has to take place.

00:14:34.869 --> 00:14:41.129
First understand this simple point that some
transformation has to take place within us

00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:48.129
to go or to penetrate into that unknown divine
which we call as collective unconscious. Something

00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:58.869
has to happen to us that we have to become
subtler beings. Don’t be satisfied and don’t

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:05.449
self certify yourself that “I’m all right;
nothing wrong with me.” No, nothing’s

00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:10.899
wrong with you. Y0ou’re all right, but you
have still to be connected to the mains. Like

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:16.929
this instrument, if it is not connected to
the mains it won’t work. It is as simple

00:15:16.929 --> 00:15:23.929
as this instrument that you are to be connected
with the mains and for that you have got built-in

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:27.490
process that has to work out.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:33.540
It’s nice we have instruments in these modern
times that I can use them as an analogies

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:40.540
to explain to you. For others they had to
use the analogies of the seed that how we

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:46.170
imbed the seed in the Mother Earth and the
Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout the

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:53.019
seed and the seed has the built-in map of
all the trees it is going to create. Now if

00:15:53.019 --> 00:15:58.759
you look at the seed do you see the miracle
behind the little seed there? In India we

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:04.540
have huge big banyan trees and if you see
the seed is so small that it’s quite microscopic

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:11.480
and it makes huge big banyan trees. How does
it make? We never wonder. Whatever is the

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:17.139
wonder, the mystery of this creation we never
wonder about it, we never look at it, look

00:16:17.139 --> 00:16:22.809
at ourselves, what are we? We are human beings,
these eyes, can we make eyes like this.

00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:27.540
We are making computers, but look at this
brain the computer that is within, we don’t

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.379
have to program it nothing it just knows.
You know I’m sitting here, I know you’re

00:16:31.379 --> 00:16:38.379
sitting here just looking at it. You don’t
have to go through the process of finding

00:16:39.029 --> 00:16:44.309
out what is the process of it and then it
moves the whole thing and gives you the program

00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:50.869
and out of the program something comes out.
It is there just at the same instant you know

00:16:50.869 --> 00:16:57.869
what is it. This kind of a computer is made
for us, why? To be wasted, to be confused,

00:17:01.029 --> 00:17:08.029
to be ended up in a lunatic asylum? We must
have the proper value system about ourselves.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:15.689
First of all we are human beings made from
amoeba to this stage in thousands of years

00:17:15.689 --> 00:17:21.630
with great care and delicacy, for what purpose
we must ask the question, why are we made?

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:27.579
Are we made here just to ruin ourselves or
not to do anything just like blind people

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:34.579
going about hitting here hitting there. No,
we are made to become the Spirit and the whole

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:42.390
system is built-in within you. And we have
to go into another realm of our awareness

00:17:43.299 --> 00:17:49.529
into a new dimension. Now these dimensions
can be also misinterpreted. It’s such a

00:17:49.529 --> 00:17:55.399
dangerous line we are into because these modern
times are full of horrible people.

00:17:55.399 --> 00:18:01.850
Like somebody says that “All right, I can
hear voices." So what?

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.330
"I can see light." So what?

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:12.330
Or somebody says that, "All right, I feel
like I’m flying in the air, I leave my body."

00:18:12.399 --> 00:18:13.240
So what?

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:20.240
What have you got? You are under the control
of something else, you don’t know anything.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:26.190
Logically you must know what you are doing,
what’s happening to you, what is within

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:33.190
you, you must know each and everything. You
have to know that if I have become the light

00:18:34.409 --> 00:18:39.390
then I must have the power of the light, I
don’t see the light. If I see the light

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:46.390
I’m not the light. If I become the light,
then I have the power of light. In the light

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:55.090
you see clearly and that is what you get is
collective consciousness. You can feel another

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:02.960
person’s Chakras, you can feel your centers
and if you know how to cure that, how to improve

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:09.149
that and how to raise the Kundalini which
is a very, very simple thing - because it

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:13.130
is so fundamental that’s why it is so simple.

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:20.130
You can cure yourself, you can cure others
and you can live very joyously within yourself.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:30.100
This is what you have to have and that’s
how you will realize that we are part and

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:37.600
parcel of the whole. The microcosm becomes
one with the macrocosm. Not by talking about

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:45.690
it by saying about it by mental projections
no, it happens to you, it really happens to

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:54.230
you when you become the spirit, it works on
your central nervous system, you know what

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:05.120
you are and what others are. That they’re
part and parcel of you is known to you on

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:10.860
your central nervous system.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:17.389
So we come to conclusion that if we have to
become the Spirit what should we do? Nothing.

00:20:17.389 --> 00:20:24.389
What do we do when we put the seed in the
Mother Earth? Nothing, but once you become

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:31.980
that then you have to look after it. When
the seed is sprouted, comes out of the Mother

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:38.950
Earth then we have to look after it, and that’s
the point where most of the western people

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:45.950
fail. The reason is this knowledge is not
known to them. Their knowledge is like the

00:20:48.889 --> 00:20:53.950
tree, which is exposed outside. They don’t
have the knowledge of the roots. This is the

00:20:53.950 --> 00:21:00.480
knowledge of the roots and we have to give
and take. We have to talk about it; we have

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:07.480
to understand that there’s nothing like
India and England two different things. England

00:21:07.519 --> 00:21:14.519
I call it the heart of the universe, it is,
and India is the Kundalini of the universe.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:22.980
The Kundalini has to know England and England
has to know the Kundalini. If it is one whole

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.559
body then one part has to know another part.

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:38.559
So all your misconceptions, or conceptions,
or maybe right ideas are all become absolutely

00:21:44.139 --> 00:21:51.139
evident, vividly seen because you get the
light of your own Spirit. That Spirit is missing.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:59.419
That Spirit which is all the time watching
you, witnessing you has to be enlightened

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:06.419
in the sense that the Spirit must enlighten
your attention. That’s how you become the

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:13.840
attention and wherever you put the attention
you act. It’s very surprising, like if you’re

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:21.320
watching the television, watching the television,
it’s unreal and you’re looking at the

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:28.350
television. They cannot act on you and you
cannot act on them because it is artificial.

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:35.289
But supposing there’s a gentleman sitting.
He’s a living body not artificial you are

00:22:35.289 --> 00:22:41.120
talking to that person and that person is
talking to you it acts. But this attention

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:47.889
which is a subtler being within you - your
attention - supposing you project it to someone

00:22:47.889 --> 00:22:53.909
and it acts for the benevolence, never for
destruction but for the benevolence. When

00:22:53.909 --> 00:23:00.909
it acts for the benevolence you are amazed,
how does it happen? How can my attention have

00:23:01.049 --> 00:23:08.049
the power of benevolence? Because in your
attention is now the light of the Spirit.

00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:12.549
So you become benevolent.

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:19.549
You know the truth whether it is true or not.
How will you know? I was once in Pune and

00:23:24.809 --> 00:23:29.570
you see in England they say I’m preaching,
I’m preaching about Hinduism, I’m converting

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:34.919
everybody to Hindus. And in India they say
I’m converting them to Christianity - because

00:23:34.919 --> 00:23:40.159
I’m doing both you see, [laughter from Shri
Mataji and from the audience] So they have

00:23:40.159 --> 00:23:44.720
a great objection about Me everywhere because
they don’t see the integrated work about

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.659
Sahaja Yoga, all right?

00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:53.659
So they said that “This is wrong, whatever
She’s saying is not correct because we are

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.399
Brahmins and we know about our shastras and
we are Brahmins.”

00:23:58.399 --> 00:24:02.509
But they didn’t tell Me all this. They talked
all these things to others and they said,

00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:07.649
“We can’t have Her in our hall, She’s
not a Brahmin and She’s in a Christian family

00:24:07.649 --> 00:24:09.899
we can’t have Her.”

00:24:09.899 --> 00:24:14.909
So the Brahmins, as usual all priests as they’re
always against the truth you see they were

00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:20.059
against the truth there also as Brahmins.
I didn’t know all these things but suddenly

00:24:20.059 --> 00:24:25.259
I felt and I said, "Whosoever are Brahmins
among you please come forward."

00:24:25.259 --> 00:24:31.090
So four five you see very hefty people came
and sat in front like this. I said," Really

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.070
are you Brahmins?"

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.049
“Yes” they said.

00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:36.009
“All right, all put your hands towards Me,
like this.”

00:24:36.009 --> 00:24:40.799
They put their hands like this towards Me
and what happened that they start shaking

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:41.200
like this.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.860
I said, “What’s happening? Stop it, why
are shaking?

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.690
He said to the others who are there they are
also shaking. I said yes but ask them from

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:54.509
where they come. They said we are certified
lunatics coming from a lunatic asylum [audience

00:24:54.509 --> 00:25:01.039
laughs] because Mother has cured some lunatics
so we are sitting here. Then they realized

00:25:01.039 --> 00:25:04.529
that they were also quite lunatic [audience
laughs again] because they’re fundamentalists.

00:25:04.529 --> 00:25:11.500
If you go to extremes you become lunatic,
I mean lunatics at least can be put in the

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.860
lunatic asylum but these people are going
around everywhere, you don’t know how to

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:21.620
control them, all over the world they are
creating such problems every, every country

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:26.639
has them. Somewhere they are very sophisticated
so you can’t make them out somewhere they

00:25:26.639 --> 00:25:31.600
are very closed so you know they are there
but some are can be very subtle you can’t

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.740
make them out but you cannot make them budge
from whatever they are holding onto.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:43.740
So this is how relatively first you realize
what is the Truth. With these vibrations,

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:51.110
with the vibrations that flow that you feel
when the Kundalini crosses through your Brahmarandra

00:25:51.279 --> 00:25:57.309
as they call it, we can call the fontanel
bone area you start feeling the cool breeze

00:25:57.309 --> 00:26:04.259
of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.
Then also you start feeling sometimes little

00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:08.080
late in your fingers the cool breeze coming
in.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.110
Now some people are very proud, "Oh, I’m
not feeling anything."

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:17.279
That’s not a good thing; if you’re not
feeling there’s something wrong. Somewhere

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:23.820
something missing, normally you should. Children
feel it very fast because they’re so innocent,

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:30.820
not yet spoiled by anything. They are not
so egoistical; they do not have these barriers.

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:35.679
Some sort of problem is there that you’re
not feeling the cool breeze. You should because

00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:41.259
this is the All Pervading Power of God which
surrounds us, is everywhere and every one

00:26:41.259 --> 00:26:44.019
of you should feel that cool breeze.

00:26:44.019 --> 00:26:50.779
Once you start feeling the cool breeze then
you become the joy because first of course

00:26:50.779 --> 00:26:55.419
you want to try with everything. "Is it cool
breeze? Is it cool breeze? That is cool breeze.

00:26:55.419 --> 00:26:59.740
Should I go or not? Let me see now, if it
is cool breeze I’ll go otherwise."

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:06.740
You go on like that. Then you realize this
is the truth, this is the truth, and then

00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:17.630
the joy of finding the truth emerges. But
in India it’s just the other way round.

00:27:18.759 --> 00:27:22.879
They’re not bothered because they know what
happens. They know; they have the knowledge

00:27:22.879 --> 00:27:29.289
of the roots, so they know what is to be found
out. We don’t have to go very far, even,

00:27:29.289 --> 00:27:35.659
so near, I mean, few years back we should
say was, we had Nanaka, we had Kabira. They

00:27:35.659 --> 00:27:42.659
talked about it very clearly they told about
this so vividly that anybody with any sense

00:27:43.159 --> 00:27:50.159
should understand. Especially Kabira who was
such a great poet and such a great incarnation,

00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:59.629
I would say the way he talked right from all
these Brahmins to all the hypocrites and everything

00:28:02.379 --> 00:28:09.379
he gave them left and right. He was like Saint
Michael with a sword in his hand cutting everybody.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.139
Like your William Blake, he was really like
your William Blake who gave left and right

00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:22.139
to all these nonsensical people. He has talked
about it, he very clearly describing Sahaj.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:27.450
He said, Nanaka has said (???) you can only
get Samadhi through Sahaja.

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:33.159
Sahaja means spontaneous, only spontaneously
can you get it. Then you have got Kabira who

00:28:33.159 --> 00:28:40.159
was treated like a (shidule?) caste. Like
a (shidule?) caste he was treated. Nobody

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:48.090
respected him. Then we had Ramdas another
one a great man I’m told, there is a temple

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:55.070
of this Ramdas. I was so amazed that in England
it should come and prosper. They were treated

00:28:55.070 --> 00:29:00.090
just like (shidule?) caste by these people
nobody would listen to them. Nobody would

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:05.820
allow them to come in a temple, these great
saints, because they were not be a born in

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:12.820
a Brahmin family; and these great people have
talked, Nanaka has talked very clearly, very

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:20.029
recently they have talked about these things.
Hundred years back only. William Blake has

00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:27.029
talked about Sahaja Yoga. He has said, "The
men of God, men of God" - that’s you - "will

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:33.580
become prophets and they will have powers
to make others prophet." He had such hopes

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:40.580
of making England into Jerusalem, but where
are those English? I have still to meet many.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.980
I’ve worked in this country for twelve years,
relentlessly. India I’ve worked very little

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:53.980
but we have thousand fold people who have
got realization in India. They may be poor

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:03.750
but they know what they have to get, to them
to get to their self realization is the thing.

00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:09.649
Nothing else matters, they do not intellectualize,
they know already this is it, this is it.

00:30:09.649 --> 00:30:16.649
Everyone knows, right from President downward
everyone knows what to expect, but whatever

00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:25.649
is our knowledge has been, we have to know
that this outside knowledge whatever we have

00:30:25.649 --> 00:30:31.259
has to have roots and we have to go to our
roots. We cannot live with this outside knowledge,

00:30:31.259 --> 00:30:38.259
we have to know ourselves. Everybody is talking
about self-knowledge. There have been so many

00:30:38.659 --> 00:30:45.659
books, so many things, I mean so much of seeking
is on, that we cannot just avoid getting to

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:53.720
our spirit, we have to get to it but the only
problem where I stumble down is that people

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:59.389
do not have (?). They’re very frivolously
treating the whole thing, those who have got

00:30:59.389 --> 00:31:06.389
realization for them the Kingdom of God is
awaiting. They are not only welcome but they’ll

00:31:07.379 --> 00:31:10.570
be cherished and that’s what has to be done.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:17.490
You have to cherish your Spirit, your Self
- you’ve not done it. Only just getting

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:22.350
realization, feeling satisfied about it itself
is not sufficient. “Now I’m realized,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.210
all right, I’ve got the cool breeze, I’m
this.” No, you have to grow. It’s still

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:32.999
a sapling that has to grow, for that you don’t
have to pay anything, nothing. Here these

00:31:32.999 --> 00:31:39.009
people, really I tell you, they are working
so hard because they have achieved a certain

00:31:39.009 --> 00:31:45.419
height in Sahaja Yoga. They don’t take any
money. They were just like you, they had to

00:31:45.419 --> 00:31:50.799
work hard to first establish themselves, because
that is the time where people want to say,

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:54.809
"No, Mother said Sahaj, so all right, we’ll
sit at home."

00:31:54.809 --> 00:32:00.639
That is only for sprouting I said Sahaj, but
we have to look after because we have had

00:32:00.639 --> 00:32:07.210
conditionings, we have had problems, we have
had physical problems, we have had social

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:14.210
problems, we have had psychological problems.
They are to be attended to and the Kundalini

00:32:15.419 --> 00:32:22.419
just goes and raise this energy there. Unless
and until you know how to maneuver it or work

00:32:23.639 --> 00:32:30.639
it out, it is very difficult for this Kundalini
to manage by Herself. You have to show the

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:36.370
will. If you do not have the will nobody can
force on you. The Divine is not going to fall

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:41.450
at your feet. "All right, all right, get your
realization." You have to knock at the door,

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:48.450
and these doors are only six - not many. Six
doors which are partly opened out, again closing,

00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:56.669
again opening out. You have to just know how
to knock and how to keep them open, finished.

00:32:57.279 --> 00:33:01.429
Then you become the light, and once you become
the light you give light to others.

00:33:01.429 --> 00:33:08.429
That’s how this world is going to be saved.
No other way out, no other way out. We have

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:14.190
to have transformation; we have to become
the Spirit. We have to be enlightened and

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:21.190
to be the light in the Great Being that is
our Creator, our Preserver and the One who

00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:34.509
is our existence itself. All these things
are so simple. They may look bombastic when

00:33:36.379 --> 00:33:43.379
we see from outside, but when you come inside
it’s so simple, it’s very easy. Sahaj

00:33:45.179 --> 00:33:49.330
also has another meaning that’s “very
easy” - apart from it is spontaneous, it

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:54.870
is very easy. We don’t want to do something
easy. Like if we can eat our food like this

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:58.960
we’ll not, we’ll have to take our hand
like this, and if you can eat in a difficult

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.179
way then it’s very good. That’s human
nature. They want to do something like that.

00:34:04.179 --> 00:34:09.179
Like some people suggested to Me, "Mother
when You go to India and settle down there,

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:13.119
then we’ll make these people that, ‘If
you have to get realization, you have to go

00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:19.210
to Mother. Then you must stay on a mountaintop
where there will be freezing cold.’ Let

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:23.470
them climb up seven miles and then they will
come to You and they’ll get their realization.

00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:28.780
Otherwise they will not because their ego
will not be satisfied with given things."

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:34.710
What about Me? I don’t want to trouble you,
why should you? I’ve taken all the troubles;

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:39.869
Christ has taken all the troubles for you.
Everybody has taken troubles, you better enjoy

00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:46.869
now. You have to enjoy it; just you have to
get it.

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:53.849
There’s no end to My lectures. I’ve been
lecturing and lecturing and lecturing and

00:34:53.849 --> 00:35:00.680
I would say that this subject is so interesting
that all here there are at least 60 percent

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:04.380
people who must have heard thousands of My
lectures. Still they would like to hear more

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:09.390
and more [Shri Mataji laughs as She speaks]
so I would suggest that we finish at this

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:15.290
point, but know that once you become the knowledge
it’s easier to understand what we are saying.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:19.770
It’s very simple but only thing you have
to become the Spirit.

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.280
May God Bless You.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:27.270
Now I would like to have some questions but
I’ve seen people when they ask questions

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:33.829
they are representatives of some horrid gurus.
Their horrid gurus pay them some money because

00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:38.780
they take a lot of money then they pay them
some money. Then they come here as identified

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.130
with these gurus. I have to request them what
have you got out of that guru? Why are you

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:50.130
so much enamored by him? Why are you so much
charmed by that, what have you got? He’s

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:59.140
using you. So please when you ask questions
ask independently, freely, I’ll be very

00:36:00.839 --> 00:36:07.079
happy to answer you but I don’t like that
you are talking because somebody has told

00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:12.520
you something. Whatever you know you ask me
I’ll be very happy to answer those questions

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:19.520
to you.

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:32.490
May God bless you.

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:58.410
Question: You mentioned Christ, you mentioned
the Holy Ghost, you mentioned the Kundalini.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:06.790
If Christ is the Son, what is the Kundalini?

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:13.790
Shri Mataji: She is the Mother. Christ within
us is the Spirit and Kundalini is the Holy

00:37:14.319 --> 00:37:21.319
Ghost, which is the Mother. The reflection
of Holy Ghost within us is the Kundalini and

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:31.720
the reflection of Christ within us is the
spirit. But everybody has played the role.

00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:51.349
Like Moses, like Abraham, like Socrates, like
Lao Tze, everybody has played the role to

00:37:55.839 --> 00:38:01.250
build up this drama they are all part and
parcel of one being. This one you must understand.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:07.780
When they said there is one God, he’s not
like rock of Gibraltar. Even rock of Gibraltar

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:14.329
has got different molecules you see but to
ask God is one means, I don’t know, I can

00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:21.329
not think of such thing just a one block.
He’s not, He has many aspects and these

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:28.440
aspects are expressed in these different ways.
Of course He’s one, united, integrated,

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:38.200
one; but all these aspects are there, and
this one God is either in the pockets of the

00:38:43.569 --> 00:38:47.180
priests or the pockets of the Brahmins or
the pockets of the mullahs or the pockets

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:54.180
of someone. One God.

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:09.050
Question: Does the Kundalini have any relationship
to the Virgin Mary, the physical Mother of

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:15.990
Jesus?

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:22.730
Shri Mataji: It is, very much so. Yes you
asked the same question. She is the Virgin

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:29.730
the (kanya?) but gradually when you come to
Sahaja Yoga you will know the Virgin Mary,

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:38.940
what is Her exposure is, how many times She
was born even in India, what is Her relationship

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:47.710
and how great She is. But why Martin Luther
did not talk about Virgin Mary? I asked My

00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:55.859
father who was a realized soul and he gave
a good explanation. He said it was (?) it

00:39:55.859 --> 00:40:01.750
means according to the circumstances at the
time, that time suddenly he found that he

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:08.750
has to take the people in a more enlightened
field and he is doing so he wanted Muslims

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:17.339
also to be included, and if you suddenly talk
about the Mother, they may not accept.

00:40:17.339 --> 00:40:24.339
So for that he avoided, but actually he knew
that one day somebody will explain. But human

00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:35.950
nature is such I must say that if you accept
one flower, you’ll not accept another, and

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:42.950
when they’re dead - not when they’re living,
never, never. When they’re living we’ll

00:40:44.059 --> 00:40:48.380
never accept it, we’ll never listen to them.
But once they’re dead then wonderful because

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:54.559
he’s in our pocket, do what you like, it’s
very common.

00:40:54.559 --> 00:41:01.559
We had one Gyaneshwara, a great saint in India,
very great saint and they have built huge

00:41:01.569 --> 00:41:08.240
big temple for him and he is in a statue.
So when we went there they said, "You cannot

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.450
do meditation here."

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:12.559
I said, "Why? What did he do? He did meditation."

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:16.170
He said, "No, you have to do that kind of
a dance they do called (?)"

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:19.020
I said, "But he did not do it.'

00:41:19.020 --> 00:41:25.960
He said, "So what? We do this way. He was
another; he was great. We are not so we have

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.450
to do this"

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:32.329
So I didn’t know how to argue at with that,
so I said, "Look at the statue. Now you are

00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:38.069
in a statue, better come in a form to tell
all these people.” But when he came in form

00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:45.069
he didn’t even have shoes to wear. He burnt
his feet on charred grounds. Nobody gave him

00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:47.000
water to drink. All the saints suffered.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:47.250
Any other question please? Yes.

00:41:47.079 --> 00:41:54.079
Question: Do you need to believe in God to
get realization, like Buddha didn’t believe

00:41:56.059 --> 00:42:01.390
in God but still got realization.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:08.390
Shri Mataji: All right, Buddha did not believe
that’s not the point - He did believe but

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:13.950
He didn’t say about God. I also didn’t
say in the beginning about God, because if

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:20.950
you start talking about God it creates problems.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.770
That he said all these things because, why,
that’s what I’m trying to tell you. You

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:49.770
see it is (?) the time, that time. What he
thought that the people in India especially

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:56.599
were worshipping a God in a temple, the Brahmins,
this, that. The Brahmins thought this is a

00:42:56.599 --> 00:43:01.460
God; they had pocketed all the money and all
those things. So how to bring them out of

00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:06.920
it? He said, “Don’t talk of God; don’t
talk of anything. Talk of the Self. First

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.500
step is Self.”

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:13.730
He said, “First they will have the Self,
then they will know where is the God.” Of

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:19.480
course in the temple also we have some things,
which we can say are swayambus, which are,

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:26.480
come out of Mother Earth. It is said in one
of the commandments that whatever is created

00:43:26.599 --> 00:43:33.599
by Mother Earth or by the heavens should not
be reproduced, but there is something created.

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:41.780
So these temples were all completely monopolized
by Brahmins and these Brahmins tried to rule

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:52.660
the whole country, that’s the thing happened.
So Buddha thought, how to get these people

00:43:52.819 --> 00:43:56.869
out and He talked about the Self only and
nothing else. He said, “First Self”, and

00:43:56.869 --> 00:44:03.630
I also felt the same way in the beginning.
but now the time is different. Now I would

00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:10.630
say that it can go to any extent this stupidity
of these fundamentalists. Like in Nasik when

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:17.500
Mahatma Gandhi returned from England they
said, “You have to go for (? Chitta)”

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:22.809
- means a repentance – “You have to go
in for repentance because you put your foot

00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:28.859
on a foreign land.” Imagine! And they would
not allow him to exist. They would not allow

00:44:28.859 --> 00:44:35.859
him to exist and he had to do it. He said,
“Now get rid of these mad people.” He

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:44.950
had to do it and it was a Brahmin who killed
him ultimately.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:52.200
So I mean, it’s a very funny world, you
know and in that world we come and we tell

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:59.880
about something that is truth - which is truth,
which is good, which is benevolent, which

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:08.799
is the thing, but people just kill. I mean
there is no need - at least if you don’t

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:15.930
want to hear, all right. Don’t kill them,
but they kill. Even Mohammed Sahib was given

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:22.930
poison, even Buddha was tortured by the people,
very much tortured in the beginning and His

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:32.030
disciples also went to extremes later on,
not his own disciples but his followers.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:39.030
So now we have people who beat the seekers
on their back. We had one gentleman, his name

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:48.140
was, he called himself Omkar. He came from
some Llama and he had a broken spine and I

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:54.859
had to work for days together to put his spine
right, and they used a stick to hit him. Can

00:45:54.859 --> 00:46:01.859
you imagine? Is it God? Is it religion?

00:46:04.569 --> 00:46:11.569
So Buddha and Mahavira, these two persons,
at that time did not talk of God, both of

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:20.430
them. Later on they again incarnated and talked
of God as Hassan and Hussein, as Kabira. And

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:09.130
the illusion was that every time He turned
His feet the carpet turned with Him. They’re

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:31.880
all one; we are only fighting because we don’t
see the oneness. So because of the time they

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:41.950
did speak but they did not cut out, they had
to say, “Stop at this point”, not more

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:45.200
because that was the situation. You can see
that. All right? So it’s logical.

00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:51.089
Question: Do you have to do any practices
to raise the force?

00:47:51.089 --> 00:47:58.089
Shri Mataji: No, first of all I’d better
do it in a different way that you all get

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:09.720
your realization, first of all. Then of course,
as I said, your Kundalini attends to your

00:48:10.049 --> 00:48:16.720
problems. She goes down, so then I have to
tell you how to raise it, how to bring it

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:22.539
back, how to correct yourself. Once you’re
established, you can do it to others. So we

00:48:22.539 --> 00:48:28.089
can say it is in three parts. First is your
establishment, like we can say the sprouting

00:48:28.089 --> 00:48:33.420
of the seed. So that’s the awakening first
of all or realization as you touched. And

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:40.420
then the second part you establish yourself.
In the third part we establish others. All

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:08.010
right?

00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:15.010
Question: (repeated by Sahaja Yogi) Are You
speaking of Kundalini awakening? Others talk

00:49:36.069 --> 00:49:40.799
about it and then deliver the goods, is this
what You’re saying? Yes.

00:49:40.799 --> 00:49:46.849
Shri Mataji: It’s true. That’s true. Easy
to talk about anything. It’s true when one

00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:53.130
need not talk. There’s no need to talk,
it works silently. It is working in all of

00:49:53.130 --> 00:50:00.130
you. That’s the right approach, who delivers
the good. That’s right, he said the right

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:10.640
thing. Who delivers the good? We can be satisfied
with artificial things you know, we can, we

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:21.880
can be. Be careful on that point, you said
the right thing. Correct.

00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:49.569
Question: As a realized soul how can one help
social problems such as problems in Ethiopia

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:55.240
and so on?

00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:02.240
Shri Mataji: Well very much. Now Ethiopia’s
problem comes from two angles, two angles.

00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:11.609
First is Ethiopia you know that the Rastafarians.
Have you heard about them? It comes from them;

00:51:14.819 --> 00:51:21.760
Rastafarians took to the wrong side. In their
religion itself you are supposed to take the

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:26.359
drugs and with taking drugs where will you
go? Into your collective subconscious, and

00:51:26.359 --> 00:51:32.680
what is in your collective subconscious is
so injurious that it can give you cancer.

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:39.230
Cancer comes from the left side, which we
call as the collective subconscious. It can

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:44.859
give all kinds of diseases, which cannot be
cured. Most of the incurable diseases come

00:51:44.859 --> 00:51:51.859
from there and also the famine. The trees
will burn. If you want to find out about a

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:59.880
person if it is true or not see the flower.
Flower will just burn off, if there’s a

00:52:00.109 --> 00:52:07.079
person who is possessed by the left side,
it will just burn off. The cows will not give

00:52:07.079 --> 00:52:13.470
milk, all things will happen in the nature,
and when there are so many people who are

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:20.470
doing this nonsensical thing and having all
the left sided movement of their attention,

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:27.490
they catch onto these and that’s how the
whole thing works on their nature. That’s

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:34.490
one thing. Now a realized soul if he goes
to Ethiopia, by his mere existence there,

00:52:37.839 --> 00:52:44.839
the nature may change. If he is of a very
evolved soul it will, even with attention

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:46.329
he can.

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:53.329
Now the second point is, what is gone wrong?
You see this is what you say is the sin, the

00:52:53.819 --> 00:53:00.819
sin, the wages of sin is fear, it’s much
more than fear. It acts, this is a sin to

00:53:02.609 --> 00:53:09.609
go to these things and succumb to collective
subconscious. Instead of rising higher, keeping

00:53:09.619 --> 00:53:16.460
in the center, going to the right and the
left we can call it is the sin but in a very

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:22.690
wider sense of the word. All right? Now this
is one thing that the country has indulged

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:29.690
too much into the left side will be grabbed,
will be definitely grabbed into the power

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:37.980
of negative forces, no doubt about it. Their
trees won’t grow, their flowers won’t

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:45.240
prosper, their children will die. They will
have negative population, they will have all

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:47.079
problems of terrible diseases even AIDS comes.
AIDS also comes from the same area. It’s

00:53:47.079 --> 00:53:47.829
a very serious thing and when collectively
people start doing it, you just entering into

00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:50.839
the satanic land where everything can work
out. That’s one thing, no use giving them

00:53:50.839 --> 00:53:57.839
money, it’s very temporary. Easy money is
the worst thing; you have to give them something

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:06.440
solid, something permanent, something eternal,
something living, which will make them grow.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:11.809
That’s one point.

00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:18.809
The second point of Ethiopia is a very collective
happening, which happened in Ethiopia. I met

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:25.960
a minister by chance from Ethiopia who was
traveling with Me in the train and he told

00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:33.079
Me it was a political game. The politics which
is not benevolent is no politics at all, it’s

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:47.000
a dirty game; and when you go to the extremes
you see the falsehood is such a nonsense,

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:53.650
such an ignorance, such a darkness that you
start moving in it you don’t know where

00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:59.750
you go till you reach your complete doom;
and when you see that you don’t understand

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:06.750
what have we done, because to move on a slope
is the easiest and that’s how Ethiopia has

00:55:10.619 --> 00:55:12.579
landed in trouble.

00:55:12.579 --> 00:55:19.579
Third point which comes to Me very important
that applies to all the nations, whether they

00:55:21.529 --> 00:55:27.960
are developing or developed, that we don’t
realize that we are part and parcel of one

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:34.960
world. God never created a separate world.
It’s one world. Like one human being it

00:55:38.289 --> 00:55:44.180
has a heart, all right? It has a liver, it
has everything but it’s one and that we

00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:51.180
are all part and parcel of this. I would say
that Roosevelt once said that poverty anywhere

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:58.660
is a threat to prosperity everywhere, and
when he said that I think he understood the

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:03.779
subtle thing. Anywhere in the body there is
poverty, means if there is any disease is

00:56:03.779 --> 00:56:10.779
a threat to the whole body. But for that we
are not yet there, we are not grown up, we

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:18.410
are still so insular, so insular.

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:25.119
Like the other day we had a lady who was English,
I must say, she came, and in My house I have

00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:31.130
- because my husband is international diplomat
traveling a lot - we have got things from

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:38.130
everywhere and she only appreciated English
things, invariably even without knowing. She

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:46.260
couldn’t appreciate anything even if for
sixth century, second century she wouldn’t.

00:56:48.059 --> 00:56:55.059
So insular, we are all insular, everywhere,
whether it’s Indian, whether it’s English

00:56:55.230 --> 00:57:02.230
whether it’s American, we are very insular
people, self-opinionated. We are not global.

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:09.900
Unless and until we become global, problems
of the world cannot be solved. As if this

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:18.020
finger of a leper is affected and then there
is no sensitivity in the whole body. Then

00:57:23.119 --> 00:57:28.950
what happens that if a rat comes and takes
away the finger the leper doesn’t know.

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:34.160
So the lepers if you go to a leper home they’ll
say, “Just have the light for us to see”,

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:41.160
but this light when it comes within you see
that we are part and parcel of the whole and

00:57:41.319 --> 00:57:48.319
that’s how you grow up into the global personality.
We are still English, British, Irish, Welsh.

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:57.740
I was surprised even the Welsh won’t like
them to be called British. I mean it’s such

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:04.740
a little land like that. Imagine in the heart
if you have cells, which do not call themselves

00:58:04.930 --> 00:58:11.210
cells of the heart, what will happen to that
heart? It will collapse.

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:17.910
It is happening everywhere, it’s not only
in one country it’s the same as I said in

00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:23.890
every country we are very insular people.
We have to expand and how do we expand, how

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:30.890
do we expand? Through our Spirit. As you can
see the characters of these people they were

00:58:31.339 --> 00:58:35.829
global they never talked about one country,
two countries, three countries, they talked

00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:42.829
for everyone. This is the third big mistake,
which all the countries are doing and they

00:58:47.069 --> 00:58:54.069
are fighting, for what? Why are they all fighting,
why are they having wars? God did not create

00:58:56.599 --> 00:59:03.599
wars, did He? It’s not His mistake. This
world belongs to Him and not to us. All theories

00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:18.710
they become self-destructive how can that
be called as a benevolent politics? In Sahaja

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:28.940
Yoga we will have the politics of Socrates,
of giving and of not taking. But we have to

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:45.500
have that race raised into that personality
that global personality. Can I do it alone?

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:53.010
You all have to help Me.

00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:06.660
Question: She’s no will power whatsoever,
She’s been a drug addict for 15 years, She

01:00:16.339 --> 01:00:17.599
just wonder she can….

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:24.599
Shri Mataji: Don’t you worry, it’s all
there it will come back don’t you worry,

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:34.640
all right? Don’t you worry. Love is the
most powerful thing, we have never used the

01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:40.750
power of love, don’t you worry.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:47.750
Question: I followed Swami Vivekananda for
years, advocated stern practices for years

01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:00.130
and years ….

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:07.130
Shri Mataji: Now he is dead and gone, all
right [laughter…applause]. I’m sitting

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:23.230
here; I’m your Mother, all right? I agree,
I know, I know all that, all horrid things

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:31.900
forget it. I’m your Mother, all right? If
I can work it out only with My love, why should

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:38.890
you worry about Vivekananda? It’s all right,
forget it, that’s over. You have done it

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:42.990
in previous life. Vivekananda had to do it
in this life but you have done it before,

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:48.160
all right? You all have finished with it,
now you just get your prizes. [Shri Mataji

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:55.160
and everyone laughs]You don’t have
to do anything like that. You see a person
who has to cook who has never cooked before

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:08.789
has to go through all rigmarole. But supposing
your Mother knows cooking. She’s done the

01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:15.789
cooking. Come along and have the food, finished.
Why to worry? All right? It’s already made.

01:02:22.049 --> 01:02:26.220
You are a seeker, you have been a seeker.
You have done all that many lives, you’ve

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:33.220
been to Himalayas so now forget it, forget
it. Better have it, all right? There are so

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:39.240
many here I can see that kind.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:46.240
Question: Can we have the food that You’ve
prepared?

01:02:46.339 --> 01:02:53.339
Shri Mataji: You’re hungry, that’s great.
Let’s have it, all right? Should we? Now

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:57.549
do not analyze anymore, just have it, don’t
analyze, when you’re hungry you don’t

01:02:57.549 --> 01:03:02.559
analyze from where did you get it, what has
happened, how (will) you cook it. You just

01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:06.440
see the fun, that’s all. You just enjoy
it, that’s a good idea.

01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:13.440
Question: After you die, would you like to
go to heaven or do you wish to stay around?

01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:29.970
Shri Mataji: Who I? I die? I think of the
present never of the future. You be in the

01:03:32.329 --> 01:03:39.329
present, don’t worry about the future. We
should worry about the present, that’s why

01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:47.819
you see Buddha talked about the Self. Why
talk of the future? Doesn’t exist for Me.

01:03:47.819 --> 01:03:51.640
Question: Present and future bind together

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:58.180
Shri Mataji: Yes, Yes but you become first
the present, otherwise there’s no binding.

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:03.569
Either you are in the future or in the past,
first of all become the present. There’s

01:04:03.569 --> 01:04:08.700
no binding, that’s the chain is missing,
that’s why I’m saying become the present.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.339
All right?

01:04:10.339 --> 01:04:17.339
Question: I want to know the answer, are You
going to stay around or are You going to go

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.069
to heaven when You die?

01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:33.069
Shri Mataji: I’m already in heaven (laughter…
applause) would you like to join Me? You please

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:51.900
join Me in heaven, all right? I’m already
in heaven. I see the heaven around Me everywhere,

01:04:52.519 --> 01:04:59.519
only thing you have to enter into that subtle
thing. It’s so beautiful; it’s so beautiful.

01:05:02.079 --> 01:05:09.079
All right, now you don’t have to do much,
but as I said we have problems within ourselves.

01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:25.170
We have to little bit work out ourselves,
our awakening and doing so you will know also

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:31.029
later on if the Kundalini falls off how to
raise it. It’s very simple, not much. You

01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:38.029
have to use your left and right hand because
as Mohamed Sahib has said that at the time

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:43.740
of resurrection your hands will speak, in
the sense that you get your collective consciousness

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:49.390
and your fingertips become enlightened. So
as all the doctors will also say that we have

01:05:49.390 --> 01:05:53.970
a sympathetic nervous system acting on our
fingertips.

01:05:53.970 --> 01:06:00.970
Now when you put the left hand towards Me,
it represents your desire to be self realized.

01:06:02.079 --> 01:06:07.029
So just you have to put your left hand like
this nothing else is to be done - simple,

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:14.029
but in a humble way. If you say, “now give
me realization”, all right, but we have

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:22.299
to be humble. That’s very important. When
we are humble, we are peaceful and the thing

01:06:22.299 --> 01:06:29.119
works out faster. So do not analyze it just
get it. It’s simple how to eat the food

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:29.829
I’m just telling you.

01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:34.400
Put your left hand straight like this. First
of all it’s better to take the advantage

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:39.339
of Mother Earth so you have to take out your
shoes. You can keep your socks but better

01:06:39.339 --> 01:06:46.339
to take out your shoes, because sometimes
they can be very tight and your hats. Anything

01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:55.750
tight, which makes you uncomfortable, should
be loosened, that’s all.

01:06:57.130 --> 01:07:03.950
Now, just put your left hand straight like
this. Everyone should try to do it, it’s

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:10.190
very simple, it’s not going to take much
time, it’s very simple. Nothing is going

01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:16.539
to happen to you but, on the contrary, you
will become at least ten years younger, that’s

01:07:16.539 --> 01:07:23.539
a promise. You see a mother when she gives
castor oil, also she has to cover it with

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:30.299
some chocolates. So now this is one of the
temptations for many people must be, but there

01:07:30.299 --> 01:07:36.000
are so many other things that I cannot describe
in this short lecture. So I would say that

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.529
just put your left hand because this is your
own power within you, which you do not know,

01:07:40.529 --> 01:07:46.380
just put your left hand just like this. All
of you please put your left hand on your lap

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:53.380
very comfortably. Now your right hand is the
one, which is the power of action. With this

01:07:53.730 --> 01:08:00.730
you act, so you have to use your right hand
just first on your heart centre then because

01:08:03.619 --> 01:08:08.760
in the heart resides the Spirit. Then I’ll
tell you one by one, but just now can see

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:15.410
on the upper part of the stomach, in the lower
part of the stomach, then again in the upper

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:22.410
part of the stomach, then on the heart, then
here, then here, then here. I will tell you

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:32.489
one by one everywhere and then on top of your
head here, stretch your hand palm, put it

01:08:32.489 --> 01:08:36.279
down there and press it hard, that’s all.
It’s very simple.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:42.089
Now this all has to be done with the right
hand, just remember this one point and left

01:08:42.089 --> 01:08:48.580
hand here. What are these centers? I will
tell you. One by one, you need not remember.

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:54.230
It’s all in the book, but just now you know
that it is to be worked out on the left-hand

01:08:54.230 --> 01:09:01.230
side. Because left-hand side is our desire
and we are putting our hand of our desire.

01:09:01.719 --> 01:09:08.719
Now the left hand is already quite heavy I
must say, all right, so now. You put your

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:16.109
left hand just like this and at the very outset,
as I’ve told in every Western program, you

01:09:19.859 --> 01:09:26.859
have to forgive yourself. You’re not to
feel guilty for anything whatsoever even for

01:09:32.089 --> 01:09:39.089
reading Vivekananda. You have to be pleasantly
placed towards yourself; after all you are

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:46.130
the temple of God. So don’t despise yourself,
don’t think low of yourself, forgive yourself

01:09:48.089 --> 01:09:55.089
and say with full confidence that you’re
not guilty. This is a fashion also, everybody

01:09:56.239 --> 01:10:01.870
wants to say “I’m guilty.” It’s a
fashion, it’s just a fashion. So please

01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:08.870
don’t consider yourself guilty for anything
you have done in the past what you think of

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:16.050
the future. Let your present come up and then
you will know that all these were mythical

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:21.630
ideas. The truth has to come.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:28.260
So now you have to close your eyes. Don’t
open your eyes. There’s no mesmerism going

01:10:28.260 --> 01:10:34.300
on, so no need to keep the eyes open. But
in any case keep your eyes shut till I tell

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:39.730
you to open, because when the Kundalini is
rising it’s better to keep your attention

01:10:39.730 --> 01:10:45.889
inside. At least through the eyes the attention
goes out, so if you keep your eyes closed

01:10:45.889 --> 01:10:52.540
the Kundalini rises much better. Sometimes
She does not rise if your attention is out,

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:59.230
so I know attention cannot be inside, but
when you close your eyes at least it is not

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:05.840
going out too much. So the Kundalini rises
and It sucks in all your attention, like I

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:11.219
can say in My sari if I have the Kundalini
rising like that it sucks in the sari like

01:11:11.219 --> 01:11:18.210
the attention, In the same way it goes up
and ultimately pierces through here. It should

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:23.540
happen, you all should certify yourself, nobody
needs certify you. Once you say you are feeling

01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:28.110
the cool breeze then you can ask somebody
to see you. If you are not feeling it, don’t

01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:35.110
get desperate, you all can feel it. There
are so many here sitting and I’m sure you

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:39.880
can be told and helped. And then once you
get it, you have to help others. That’s

01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:44.860
how we are going to work it out.

01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:51.860
So now please put left hand like this, right
hand on your heart. Now here close your eyes.

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:07.380
In the heart resides the Spirit, so please
ask Me three times a question in your heart,

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:18.090
not loudly. Please ask Me sincerely a question.
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or you can

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:29.080
call Me “Mother”, whatever you like. “Mother,
am I the Spirit? Mother, am I the Spirit?

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:37.630
Mother, am I the Spirit?” Now this is a
fundamental question you’re asking to a

01:12:37.630 --> 01:12:44.630
computer, which has to give you the answer.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:05.800
Now this question is followed by another question
when you put your right hand in the upper

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:27.900
part of your stomach on the left-hand side.
You’re working everything on the left-hand

01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:34.900
side and press it hard. Now here is the centre,
which gives you the power of mastery over

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:45.570
yourself, the mastery over the divine knowledge,
the mastery over the working of the divine

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:52.290
knowledge. That means you become your own
master, you become your own guru, nobody can

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:59.290
dominate you, nothing can dominate you, no
habits can dominate you. So at this point

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:06.400
you press your fingers dig them down here
you have to ask the second question to me,

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:15.170
Mother am I my own master? Ask this questions
three times please, with full faith in yourself

01:14:17.679 --> 01:14:22.889
ask this question: “Mother, am I my own
master? “ This will neutralize all your

01:14:22.889 --> 01:14:29.889
useless feelings and everything. “Mother
am I my own master?”

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:57.050
Now please take your hand down in the lower
part of your abdomen and press it hard there

01:14:58.969 --> 01:15:05.969
on the left-hand side, keep the left hand
towards me. Now here is the centre, which

01:15:07.409 --> 01:15:14.409
is working out the divine technique, the pure
knowledge, the true art of this technique

01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:26.010
is worked out through this centre here. At
this centre I cannot force you in any way

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:37.610
that you should ask me for your self-realization.
It should be your own desire free will ask

01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:48.730
for it. So here you please ask Me, “Mother,
may I have the true knowledge?” This has

01:15:57.909 --> 01:16:04.469
to be said six times because there are six
petals to this center. “Mother, may I have

01:16:04.469 --> 01:16:11.469
the true knowledge, the pure knowledge of
the divine technique?”

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:21.570
(Why don’t you do? You’re so young, please
try, it’s very easy. For young people to

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:31.040
be that adamant is not good. But please try,
it’s worth it.)

01:16:34.679 --> 01:16:41.679
Six times please. You must learn to listen
and sometimes understand, all right? Now raise

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:36.360
this hand again on the left-hand side, on
the same center of the principle of the mastery

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:44.110
on the upper part of your abdomen of your
stomach, on the left-hand side, And now press

01:17:44.710 --> 01:17:51.710
it hard. This center has got ten petals, so
here now you have to help your Kundalini to

01:17:56.710 --> 01:18:03.710
rise by asserting the truth, by saying ten
times with full confidence in yourself, “Mother

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:14.800
I am my master. Mother I am my own master.
Mother I am my own master.” Please say it

01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:24.310
ten times.

01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:08.760
Now again you raise your hand on top of your
heart and put it there with full confidence

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:17.760
here, as this centre has got twelve petals
you have to say with full confidence in yourself

01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:25.170
the truth, “Mother I am the Sprit.” You
are the Spirit, so please say with full confidence,

01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:32.170
“Mother I am the Spirit.” Believe Me,
you are the Spirit. Twelve times.

01:20:19.889 --> 01:20:26.889
You have to know that Divine is the ocean
of God’s love. It is the ocean of His forgiveness

01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:37.670
and you cannot do anything that He cannot
forgive. He’s that powerful, His forgiveness

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:44.520
is that powerful, so there’s no need for
you to feel guilty about anything whatsoever,

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:51.520
by that you’re challenging His power of
forgiveness. So now you raise your hand in

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:08.760
the angle of your neck and your shoulder and
push it back towards the spinal chord and

01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:19.020
press it very hard. Now this is the most difficult
center in the West. As I said, when you feel

01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:25.800
guilty you catch this center and you get all
kinds of troubles like angina also troubles

01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:31.150
like spondylitis and so many other problems.

01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:38.150
Now press it hard and with full confidence,
you say sixteen times, “Mother I’m not

01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:49.090
guilty.” Sixteen times. You have to be pleasant
with yourself; you have to cherish yourself

01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:01.960
and not to condemn yourself at all by any
chance. You are not guilty. So please say,

01:22:03.989 --> 01:22:08.719
“Mother, I am not guilty at all” sixteen
times. But those who still want to go ahead

01:22:08.719 --> 01:22:15.710
with it punish themselves by saying it 108
times. That would be the best. (Shri Mataji

01:22:15.710 --> 01:22:20.739
blowing on her hand and rubbing Her hands)
So much heat coming out from there, so much

01:22:20.739 --> 01:22:27.739
of heat. “I’m not guilty.”

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:37.360
Put your left hand towards Me, say with full
confidence. Wow, this is the worst hurdle,

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:46.820
I tell you. It’s just a myth; it’s a conception
in your head that you’re guilty. What guilt

01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:58.530
can you have that cannot be washed by the
great power of God’s love and forgiveness?

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:07.100
(Shri Mataji is rubbing Her hands) Sixteen
times or 108 times. You do not know how to

01:23:13.389 --> 01:23:16.409
love yourself. You’re supposed to be selfish
but there’s no selfishness I think. (Shri

01:23:16.409 --> 01:23:23.409
Mataji is blowing hard and rubbing Her hands)

01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:06.790
Now raise this hand on your forehead across
and press it on both the sides. Now, here

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:18.880
is the center where you have to forgive others.
I will not say how many times but from your

01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:27.070
heart, please say, “Mother, I forgive everyone,
I forgive everyone, I forgive everyone.”

01:24:29.449 --> 01:24:36.210
Now maybe you might say it’s very difficult,
but it’s not all because it is mythical.

01:24:36.210 --> 01:24:42.770
What do you do by not forgiving or forgiving?
Is nothing, but when you don’t forgive you

01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:49.340
play into the hands of wrong people. So just
say, “Mother, I forgive everyone, everyone

01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:55.119
I forgive.” This is the greatest weapon
Christ has given us - to forgive. Forgive

01:24:55.119 --> 01:24:58.510
everyone, forgive everyone, forgive everyone.

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:05.510
Now for

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:28.850
your own satisfaction you may put your hand
on the backside of your head, backside of

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:37.400
your head. Here is the center where you have
to say that “If I have done anything wrong

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:46.900
against the Divine, please forgive me.”
You have to ask the Divine the forgiveness,

01:25:47.850 --> 01:25:54.850
so that there’s no doubt in your mind or
sort of lurking guilt. Say that three times

01:25:58.469 --> 01:26:05.469
of from your heart it will work out, but don’t
count the mistakes, so called. Just say that,

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:20.360
saying is sufficient. Saying is the enlightened
chanting, all right?

01:26:21.489 --> 01:26:28.489
Now stretch your hand put it on top of your
head, bend you head a little bit forward.

01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:37.570
On top of your head, bend it and now rub it
hard the scalp seven times. Here again I cannot

01:26:44.610 --> 01:26:50.770
cross your freedom, so you have to say, “Mother,
I want my Realization.” I cannot force it

01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:56.580
on you, so just say, “I want my Realization.”
I can only persuade you, but I cannot force

01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:02.360
it. You have to ask for it. So please say
seven times, “Mother, please may I have

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:09.360
my realization? Please give me my Realization”
seven times. (Shri Mataji blows seven times

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:36.080
into the microphone)

01:27:37.850 --> 01:27:44.850
Now bring down your right hand, put it towards
Me. Slowly open your eyes and put your left

01:27:53.270 --> 01:28:00.270
hand bending your head a little bit on top
of your head here, little higher and see if

01:28:00.630 --> 01:28:05.489
there’s a cool breeze coming out. With the
left hand you see, not with the right, right

01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:10.130
hand towards Me, the right hand towards Me,
the left hand just try to see if you’re

01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:17.130
feeling any cool breeze out of your head,
all right? Don’t get upset. If you’re

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:27.040
not feeling doesn’t matter, we’ll work
it out. Doesn’t matter. Now turn it round

01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:36.310
again put it here the right hand, see with
the right hand if you’re feeling the cool

01:28:36.310 --> 01:28:43.310
breeze. Some people don’t feel it, doesn’t
matter. Nothing so desperately bad. There

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:52.080
is, I can see that. Now left hand again, little
higher, maybe little higher, some people feel

01:29:14.050 --> 01:29:20.929
it very high you see, it shoots off, just
see.

01:29:20.929 --> 01:29:26.830
Now you may put your hand up towards the sky
and ask the question, “Is this the All-Pervading

01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:33.830
Power of God’s love? Is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost? Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

01:29:35.239 --> 01:29:42.239
Ask the question three times. Now, such a
lot, all the Sahaja Yogis sitting here. Are

01:29:57.719 --> 01:30:04.110
you feeling? Cool breeze? Or what? Something
happening? Now put back your hand, now don’t

01:30:04.110 --> 01:30:11.110
analyze it just see in the hands are you feeling
any cool breeze in the hands. All right, little

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:24.900
bit, some feel a little bit; but it’s all
right, the beginning has started. Now most

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:31.719
of you have got the right hands less, so put
the right hand towards Me, left hand like

01:30:31.719 --> 01:30:38.719
this towards the sky, it will ventilate. Left
hand like this and now forgive, forgive everyone,

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:53.440
everyone you forgive, just forgive. That’s
the mantra. It will release, left hand up.

01:30:58.590 --> 01:31:05.590
Right hand towards Me and left hand up. Now
right hand towards Me. Moving, is it? Slowly,

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:15.560
slowly it will move, right hand is difficult
because mostly we are very right-sided people,

01:31:21.119 --> 01:31:25.590
mostly. Yes, good.

01:31:25.590 --> 01:31:32.590
Now with the left hand you put towards Me
and right hand towards the Mother Earth like

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:39.960
this. Left hand towards Me and right hand
towards the Mother earth. This is what we

01:31:40.739 --> 01:31:47.739
are doing: we are correcting the elements
within us, bringing them into balance. Which

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:52.850
you will know very soon what it was, what
we were doing. You’ll know everything. No,

01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:59.750
no left towards Me, left towards Me and right
towards the Mother Earth. Right towards the

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:06.750
Mother Earth. Left towards Me, right towards
the Mother Earth. Mmm, better. All right?

01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:17.380
Now all those who have felt the cool breeze
in the head or in the hands raise your both

01:32:39.159 --> 01:32:46.159
the hands. All

01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:40.540
of you? Practically? The sprouting has started.

01:33:58.690 --> 01:34:05.690
May God bless you.
