00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.110
I had a grandma. She was My father's aunt

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.901
and she used to tell us a nice story about
somebody who was going to meet God.

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:23.660
Of course this - in India everybody
understands all these things.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.083
They will not say: "How is he going to
meet God?" but they accept, you see:

00:00:27.163 --> 00:00:28.843
“All right, he is going to meet God”.

00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:33.650
So when he was going on the way,
on the road, he found one gentleman

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.940
sitting there, nicely singing
songs, bhajans of God,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.790
doing nothing on the roadside.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.222
So he said: "Oh, so you are going to meet God?"

00:00:47.302 --> 00:00:51.947
"Yes, I am going to meet Him. So
have you any message for Him?"

00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:56.030
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.740
but He should arrange for my food,
because I think the food is now finishing."

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.433
He said: "Really, that's what
you want me to tell Him?"

00:01:06.513 --> 00:01:14.830
"Yes, yes, please tell Him. Oh, of
course He'll arrange, but please tell Him."

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.730
So he went ahead and he met another gentleman

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.530
who was standing on his head,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.378
doing all kinds of yoga asanas and everything.

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:29.297
And he asked him: "Please go
and ask God - I've tried everything.

00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:32.007
When is He going to meet
me? I would like to see Him.

00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:34.797
I would like to have His
darshan." He said: "All right."

00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:40.617
So he went to God,

00:01:40.697 --> 00:01:46.147
and whatever work he had he finished with it,

00:01:46.227 --> 00:01:51.057
and then God asked him: "Have
you got anything to tell Me?"

00:01:51.137 --> 00:01:58.227
He said: "Nothing much, but I
met one gentleman while coming

00:01:58.307 --> 00:02:02.277
and he said that 'I'm doing all kinds
of things, I have tried everything,

00:02:02.357 --> 00:02:05.187
and when will God meet
me? I am standing on my head,

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:09.567
and I am doing also all kinds of
yoga asanas, and all kinds of things,

00:02:09.647 --> 00:02:13.107
and also I am going to church
and mosque, I am praying,

00:02:13.187 --> 00:02:19.027
doing all sorts of prayers,
but when will God meet me?'"

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:23.007
So God said: "Tell him he has to do little more.

00:02:23.087 --> 00:02:28.107
See, it's not easy. When
Sahaja Yoga will come we'll see!"

00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:43.437
So then even he said: "And there’s
another one who was on the road, You see.

00:02:43.517 --> 00:02:46.637
He was just enjoying himself singing songs,

00:02:46.717 --> 00:02:48.787
he suddenly saw me, and he told me:

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.957
'You see, my food is now finishing,
ask God to arrange it for me.'"

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:55.950
He said: "Really, is the food just
finishing?" Immediately God said:

00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:59.727
"What are you doing, why don't you go
and look after him? His food is finishing."

00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:02.706
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday
only, we arranged it, all that."

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:06.435
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't
matter." You see, he couldn't understand,

00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:09.129
you know, that this fellow
who is trying all these things

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.737
and God is still saying that he has to wait.

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.397
And while this fellow is just
singing songs of God and all that,

00:03:15.477 --> 00:03:19.707
and why is it so much
impressed by this another fellow

00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:25.357
who is doing nothing to seek God?

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:28.587
So then God realized that he
is in some sort of an illusion.

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:33.487
So He told him: "All right,
you go and tell them one thing.

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:39.167
To both of them the same thing, that
'When I went to God what I saw there

00:03:39.247 --> 00:03:47.517
was that He made a camel
pass through the eye of a needle.'"

00:03:49.217 --> 00:03:52.527
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

00:03:52.607 --> 00:03:55.807
"Yes, yes, you just tell
them, and see the reaction."

00:03:55.887 --> 00:04:00.177
So he went down. So this is, the first
one met him, he said: "What God has said?"

00:04:00.257 --> 00:04:04.087
He said that God has said: "Wait till
Sahaja Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:06.707
Before that you go round like this."

00:04:06.787 --> 00:04:08.987
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

00:04:09.067 --> 00:04:11.547
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me sometime?

00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:16.477
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:19.327
And he was quite disappointed.

00:04:19.407 --> 00:04:24.057
So he went and he asked him
that: "What did you see with,

00:04:24.137 --> 00:04:27.617
there when you went to see
God?" He said: "I saw that, you know,

00:04:27.697 --> 00:04:31.827
He passed a camel through
the eye of an, of a needle."

00:04:31.907 --> 00:04:34.844
He said: "What? How is it
possible? It's impossible!"

00:04:34.884 --> 00:04:35.877


00:04:35.957 --> 00:04:38.797
Now mental - "How is it possible,

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:41.967
that a camel can pass
through the eye, it's not possible,

00:04:42.047 --> 00:04:46.855
see the volume of this one and
such a little thing. How can he pass?

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:50.417
No, no, no, no you are just telling me
a story because you have been to God,

00:04:50.497 --> 00:04:54.647
you are trying to show off, that's all.
I, I don't believe in all this nonsense.

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:58.347
You see, you are just telling me
lies, and don't try to befool me."

00:04:58.427 --> 00:05:02.515
So he went to another person
who was on the street eating nicely.

00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:06.147
He said: "How are you?" "Oh, I know He
had arranged before you reached there,

00:05:06.227 --> 00:05:10.537
I know it was all right after all. You
see, He looks after me all the time.

00:05:10.617 --> 00:05:16.247
So what did you see when you went
there?" He said: "I saw that God Almighty

00:05:16.327 --> 00:05:23.227
passed a camel through an eye of
a needle. It's a very amazing thing."

00:05:23.307 --> 00:05:28.637
He said: "What amazing thing?
He is God, do you know He is God?

00:05:28.717 --> 00:05:35.717
Do you know He is God? God can
do anything. He can do anything!"

00:05:35.797 --> 00:05:44.277
That's made him understand, that if
you understand that God is all-powerful -

00:05:44.357 --> 00:05:48.677
all-powerful, it doesn't mean that He
can move Himalayas to Maharashtra.

00:05:48.757 --> 00:05:51.877
It doesn't mean that!

00:06:01.247 --> 00:06:04.997
But it means He is all powerful.

00:06:05.077 --> 00:06:09.097
Means He can do subtlest and
subtlest thing, and such things

00:06:09.177 --> 00:06:14.457
which our brain, this mental
side cannot understand.

00:06:14.537 --> 00:06:20.427
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

00:06:21.813 --> 00:06:24.514
This is what God is.
