00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.940
[CLAPPING]

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.620
We said on our National television to day that

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.880
sahaja yoga is a respectable yoga

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.620
because of some so called yogas that have gone before.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.320
Shri Mataji has come to

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.380
show us the truth because that's what we all desire for.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.940
That we have a special reason for existence -

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.860
- it is to find the truth.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.340
And those of us who have been blessed to be with Her

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.600
have found the truth. So She's come to Sydney

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.600
to tell us about the truth.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.660
In a very troubled world, has arrived with

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.720
many other wrong answers to our troubles - the answers of drugs, hard and soft

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.540
and other things that distract us - we found that those are not the answer.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.320
Holy Mother thank You for coming and thank You for being with us.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.980
So, once again, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.040
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.400
The idea about truth

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.740
is sometimes a misconception.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.640
Truth is what it is and will be the truth.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.160
We cannot change it, we cannot organize it,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.460
we cannot work it out - it remains what it is.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.620
And the greatest truth is that we all have become human beings

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.960
to become the spirit. We're still

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.760
not in that stage that's why there are problems around us.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.320
Once you become the truth, it being the Absolute,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.900
you reach the state of Absoluteness. Then there is

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.700
no difference of ideologies,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.740
no differences of nation -

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.380
- all nations one knows are created by God Almighty.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.620
Just He created variety to give a beautiful world to us.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.760
Variety always gives beauty.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.480
That's why this variety was created just to make the world very interesting

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.180
but not for fighting or for quarreling or for believing

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.880
that this part belongs to us and that part belongs to somebody else.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.620
The human problem, as I have studied, is very simple -

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.920
- is to be understood in a detached way.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:28.660
Now here you can see the beautiful machinery that is working within ourselves.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:37.260
If you see on the left-hand side we have [ASIDE - SOMEBODY SHOULD COME AND SHOW] blue colored line

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.120
and the right-hand side you see a yellow line.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.680
In the center you see a white channel

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:00.440
These are our Autonomous Nervous Systems - three channels -

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.860
Left and Right Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.120
When I talk of Medical Science people get quite surprised.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.140
But it has something to do to understand what are we inside ourselves.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:25.480
Now this Parasympathetic Nervous System is a system that gives us balance.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:33.140
For example, if I'm running fast, My heart will start thumping

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.180
but it comes to normal through Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.420
And Medical Science doesn't know much about the Parasympathetic Nervous System which is actually in the center.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.100
These chakras are around the Parasympathetic Nervous System and

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:01.440
like My fingers here, this is the chakra in the center here

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.860
and this the Left Sympathetic and this the Right Sympathetic and they both put together make this center

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.920
to form the Parasympathetic - simple as that.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:22.120
Now what happens with human-beings, that they have a capacity, they have a freedom also

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:30.060
to go to the left or to the right. They can be very emotional people.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:36.600
They can go to the emotional side to such an extent that they can become fanatics.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.460
They can go further with it so that

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:53.260
the left side which represents our Subconscious,

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.700
then the Collective Subconscious can be entered into.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.480
So they can enter into Collective Subconscious also.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:13.200
Subconscious also has 3 - 4 layers that is we can say the Present Subconscious,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.620
the Past Subconscious and the Subconscious of ages.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:24.480
Then the Collective Subconscious where all that is dead exists in that area.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:33.420
Now, when you move too much on that side, you get attacked by that side

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:42.320
and that side has got all that is dead which attacks you, which triggers you.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:54.000
On the right hand side we have got another channel of the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:03.740
This channel represents our activity and our future.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:13.420
So when you're overactive, you're working very hard, you're futuristic - all the time thinking about the future

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.900
- you start moving towards the right side

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:26.960
to such an extent that you can enter into your Collective Supra-conscious also.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:34.080
In the same way you have got your Present Supra-conscious and also Collective Supra-conscious.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:43.780
Now, human beings have a capacity, that they can move to the left and to the right with their attention.

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:51.240
They can project their attention to the left or to their right or they can be moderate in the center.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:09:00.340
So, when people talked of religion - I mean the real people who came on this earth, they talked of religion -

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:08.500
they talked about our valency, that's a human valency is of ten number -

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:15.280
and that's why they talked of ten commandments. Or in every religion they talked about it

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:21.220
that we have to keep this balance. When we go out of this balance

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.800
then we either move to the left or to the right.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.260
But, if you see the history of religions, it is just the opposite.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.660
That all these religions have created conditionings within us -

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.220
a kind of a fanatism, a kind of a blind faith

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.380
which was never the purpose of establishing your

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.480
valencies within yourself.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.880
The movement to the right is also another problem of the modern times.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:10.080
When we move to the right, we actually start becoming very egoistical.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:18.240
The activity that we form, the activity that we perform

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:25.660
creates a balloon like structure on our head, as you see, crossing over here,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.500
as ego - that yellow stuff.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.160
On the left hand side when we're conditioned very much, we get another balloon, which we call as super-ego.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:53.000
Jung also, missed the point because he described

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:58.840
that there're layers horizontally placed within ourselves - it is not so.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:05.780
God, is a great constructor and a manager.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:13.740
For example, you have put a road for Me here - I don't have to pass through different, different rows.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:21.020
In the same way He placed everything in a vertical way

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:26.060
and the road to realization is kept free within us.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.660
The road to realization is straightforward, which you see,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:36.780
is the shown in the white color, is the Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:45.440
Now those people who move to the left or to the right, develop diseases.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.060
For example, I'll show you here, now supposing, I move one finger too much here

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.700
then I'm cut off, cut off with the main -

00:11:57.380 --> 00:12:04.720
this side is cut off with the main, this side is cut off with the main. Then what happens that there is no control

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:13.640
and the cells become malignant, on their own. They start over-powering others

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.480
and that's how they start destroying other cells - we say cancer has been established.

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:29.060
Is a very simple thing, is to bring them back again and put them in contact

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.660
with the Divine and bring them to the mains.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:43.280
Secondly, people have these days diseases like Diabetes - very common, Diabetes is a very common disease.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:49.620
Now in Indian villages, the villagers when they take tea

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:57.240
they say, the we must take so much sugar that the spoon must stand in the sugar.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:03.800
And they drink such a lot of sugar - they never have Diabetes, never - they have never known Diabetes.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.920
What is the cause of Diabetes or liver trouble

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.780
or we can say, other troubles like Blood Cancer?

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:23.080
Is a very simple thing that we do - is the imbalance within us.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.280
Is you see, the yellow center we call as Swadhisthana,

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:35.560
which looks after the Aortic plexus in our body, on the physical level,

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:40.040
this center has a very special work to do

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:46.980
that is to convert the fat cells for the use of the brain.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.380
So it converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:14:00.160
If people are very futuristic - all the time thinking, thinking, thinking - then this poor

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:09.020
center or chakra has one work, is to convert cells after cells for the use of the brain.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.440
Brain starts growing but what about the other function it has to do?

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:21.460
It has to look after the liver, it has to look after the pancreas,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:29.540
it has to look after the spleen, it has to look after part of the intestines and also the kidneys.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.200
When we start thinking too much, we give too much work to this one center

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:44.200
all these visceras are neglected and you may develop any one of these troubles.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.100
But when it comes to spleen, it is even worse.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:55.900
When it comes to spleen - these days the life is so hectic - first of all,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:02.800
we get up in the morning, first thing we do is to read the newspaper - that's the horrid thing to do.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.900
Coming out of very nice sleep, you suddenly read the newspaper and so many are bombed,

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.640
so many are killed and so many are harassed - Oh God!

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.900
You get a shock, the system gets a shock.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.840
Now, when the system gets a shock, the spleen has to

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:27.740
produce more Red blood corpuscles - it has to work very hard.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:34.140
Then you suddenly discover, you have to go to your work, so you get out of your bed and rush here and there,

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:41.340
brush your teeth on your way and carry your breakfast - maybe your wife is running after you with the breakfast - you have no time for anything.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.640
Such a hectic life you lead - extremely hectic.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.800
Then you get into the car, you find there's a jam - finished.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.600
Is a, we don't understand how much you're shocking ourselves all the time.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.420
We are on a war path with the watch.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.680
All the time struggling for time, struggling for time.

00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.460
This spleen doesn't understand the person -

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.860
there's no rhythm in the life of that person.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:24.800
The spleen thinks, what am I to do now? Suddenly this person needs the Red blood corpuscles, then it doesn't need, then suddenly it needs it - it becomes hectic.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:34.660
It needs hec.. when it becomes hectic, it becomes vulnerable for Blood Cancer.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:43.280
And then, if a person gets any shock or goes to the left side in an emotional way, he gets Blood Cancer.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:50.960
Even the mothers who are like this, very hectic, disciplining their children, "Keep the carpet clean,

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:57.220
eh..walk this way, first put your right foot then left foot, don't walk that way" -

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:04.540
the child, when she's pregnant, can get Blood Cancer.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:15.780
We must understand we are delicately made beautiful flowers of God, we're human beings

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.320
and the time has come for us to become now the fruits.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:28.340
This is the blossom time. But we shock our system with so many things - for what have we achieved?

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:38.580
In India we have Taj Mahal, we have Ajanta caves, we have so many things to show you

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:46.360
but they are all in the past. I don't think in Sydney you can make a hall like this anymore - is not possible.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.460
What have we achieved - plastics?

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.080
What are we achieving?

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:06.080
The modern times we have lost the sense of greatness and glorious things.

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.520
All the time you're struggling with time and no body has time.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:22.420
Everybody is rushing up. I asked one gentleman, "Why're you in such a hurry to go to London, after all,

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.960
it's all right you can go tomorrow, if you don't get the seat today you can go tomorrow?"

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.100
He said, "No, I have to attend a ball."

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:35.660
He'll waste 3 hours in the ball or in a pub, that's all right.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:43.780
But, he's so worried about getting his ticket - for that he will completely rattle his system.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.920
Just to get the ticket and that for what?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:55.500
That ball is not going to give him any relaxation because he's already finished his system.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:00.300
That's how one develops this Blood Cancer.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:10.040
Then the pancreas is out of order, one develops Diabetes

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.900
Kidneys are out of order - high blood pressure.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.980
Then all kinds of kidney troubles and then they go on the machine and all kinds of things happen.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:31.720
It is happening in all the nonsensical things also we have taken.

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:38.260
Like for us now, so far he was, Mr. Freud was

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:44.420
had displaced Christ completely. He had become Christ for us.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.880
Blind-folded we followed him and also out-witted him

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:57.260
in our projections. "What's wrong?"

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.880
When I went to America in '73

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:10.860
I told them that this is all wrong you're doing, it will have a very bad effect, it's not natural.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.360
If promiscuousness is good, then why does it give diseases?

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:23.720
If it is natural, then why does it give you problems - simple question?

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:34.760
There's a kind of a ego that we can do it - but why fight with the nature?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.040
If you fight with the nature, nature will take it's respite.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:51.780
And today that's why, we have to say, "This was wrong we have done and we're not going to do it anymore."

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.420
Our children are not going to do it.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:04.860
After going through all the experiences now they're talking that cigarette should be abandoned.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:14.140
But Nanak Sahab had told long time back that cigarette is the worst thing, it will cause horrible trouble to you.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:21.000
Now they're saying about no smoking - now they cannot give up.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:30.460
There are thousand and one problems - the greatest is, I think now, is AIDS -

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:36.160
is caused by nothing but stupid ego.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:48.040
Anything they try, you ask them why do you do it ; like some people are now coloring their heads.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:55.520
And I found some of them are becoming blind. So I said, "Why are you doing it?" They said, "What's wrong?"

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:02.720
But why do you want to color your hair? "But what's wrong?" I didn't know what to answer.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.260
I said, "But it will make you blind." "We'll see when it makes us blind." - Such arrogance!

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:20.240
You can't challenge your system like that, you have to be humble about it because it's a delicate system of a human being.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:28.040
We are not hippopotamus, are we? That on a hippopotamus you paint anything, nothing will happen to him.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:35.100
But we're human beings, we have got cells here, which absorb paints and that can go on to our nerves,

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.900
can also go on to our other centers.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:48.200
There should be a basic understanding - what is ridiculous?

00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:02.680
As if, people have gone a muck and doing all these things - but that's what, you're going to the left or to the right.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:10.580
Now, those people who move too much to the right, get heart attacks.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:19.960
They maybe thin like dried fishes but they can get heart attacks.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:28.620
When you extract too much of your energy on the right side, the heart gives in.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:40.020
There is no need to put in so much effort

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:46.620
- like one day I met a lady who had a heart attack -

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.380
she's just a housewife with only two children.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:24:00.000
I said, "Why do you get a heart attack, madam?" She said, "I've to work very hard, You know."

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:07.900
"With two children what do you do?" "Oh, I've to keep everything clean, absolutely clean,

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:14.100
to keep my children clean, I've to keep my husband clean, I've to keep my bathroom clean, to keep," and I said,

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:21.500
"It's all right, but why don't you understand that also your health is there and you should take some rest in between."

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.600
"No, to me cleanliness is everything." Then you have the heart attack.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.640
This is the norms of today's life.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.000
I don't think our parents used to polish everything all the time

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:45.140
or they were all the time with a vacuum cleaner, you see, like a tail we have a vacuum cleaner with us.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:52.480
Doesn't matter, it's house. After all, it should be a cozy place for children

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:57.960
and for the husband to come down. Doesn't matter, once you clean it, it's all right.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.240
But that kind of a attitude we cannot take because that's the norm.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:11.560
So many norms we have which are really absurd and ridiculous.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:16.200
We can never sit down and enjoy each other's company.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:24.340
If the husband and wife are sitting, there should be a television in between or some sort of a drama or something.

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:32.220
There should be something in between, they cannot talk to each other - there's no relaxing mood.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.040
There's so much to be talked between husband and wife.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:42.840
I mean, when husband wife are enjoying themselves and talking to each other, it's better to switch off the horrible

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.900
television which is showing the quarrel between husband and wife all the time.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:26:00.860
So, all these things work out - the family system, the household and the all the norms we have started.

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:07.240
All these things work out on our sweet beautiful system that we have.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.120
We are fighting all the time with each other, for what?

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:22.280
This is what takes us to the extremes and these extremes are responsible for giving us all these problems.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:32.140
Now, with the Kundalini awakening, when She rises, passes through those centers -

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:37.220
first of all She puts them like a slot, they all come back,

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:44.880
fall in lines, She awakens them, gives them energy, the energy flows out

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.740
cures cancer, cures this, cures that, cures that.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:55.980
Then it passes through your Agnya chakra here, where you forgive everyone.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:05.620
You just forgive. You don't know, what a weapon Christ has given us to forgive.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.900
Half of the marriages would be all right if we know how to forgive.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:19.560
Just makes you a sweet, beautiful, charming person

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.940
in the real sense of the word, not outwardly because you're dressed up well or you have

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:32.820
a beautiful ornament or something like that. You really become a very charming person in the sense

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:40.440
that you charm the children, you charm your family, you charm the whole world.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:49.060
Because once you start forgiving, the love of your heart starts pouring everywhere.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:59.340
When She opens this last center, actually here on the fontanel bone area, where you get your real baptism

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:06.340
this is the, we call the seat of the heart center, seat of the heart center.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.700
When She opens the transformation starts

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:20.700
and you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So, the transformation in the temperament,

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:27.720
in the behavior of a person - you immediately notice the face changing -

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.940
the tense face that you see suddenly becomes mellowed down - we're relaxed.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:43.320
And this Kundalini awakening then kept up well, makes you grow spiritually.

00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:50.060
And the spiritual growth in a person is what we want today.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:59.180
Of course, no diseases, no physical problems, no mental problems -

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.600
many mad people have been cured, this Schizophrenia has been cured with sahaja yoga.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:13.880
Is all because our spirit has not come into our attention.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:20.540
Spirit is the light but the light we see here is jarring sometimes -

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:25.640
has nothing in it - the light of the spirit has love -

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:35.220
is beautiful love about which we have heard about, which is All Pervading, is all over

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:42.780
and you just feel absolutely sure of yourself as if you're entered

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.160
into the beautiful hall of God's kingdom where you're secured, you're respected,

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.020
you're loved, you're looked after - is a fact.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.680
But we have to enter there and we have to receive that blessing.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.880
Then this physical things look nothing, insignificant.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.760
If somebody has some problem you can go and cure it, I need not be there.

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.280
You can raise the Kundalini of other people. This is your birthright

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.800
to get the Kundalini awakened and to have your real baptism.

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:31.300
You have got it within yourself, all is your power - I'm doing nothing,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:38.320
maybe a catalyst - for a little while and then you become the catalyst.

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:45.440
The whole world can change and transform itself

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:51.580
if it follows the power of love. We have never used the power of love -

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.220
is all the power of hatred all the time.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:01.480
But the power of love that is Divine love is devoid of lust and greed -

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.380
is just you enjoy the loving of love.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:14.900
And that situation when it works, you see the whole world in a different way

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.940
and you develop that witness state which is described many a times by many saints

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.160
and many prophets and Incarnations.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:31.280
It's a very easy thing to happen, it is spontaneous because it's the living force,

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:39.860
is the living thing - you cannot pay for it, it's ridiculous to think that you can pay for it - you cannot.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:50.400
How much money did we pay to the plants which produce these beautiful flowers - nothing.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.700
They just gave you the flowers because they enjoy giving.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:04.780
That sort of personalities we all become - beautiful people. Actually we have wasted our life quite a lot.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:12.080
After realization we understand how valuable we are, how glorified we are,

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:19.760
how God loves us and how He looks after us moment to moment!

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:30.180
These imbalances within us have now increased more by time

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:39.260
because the ego increased a lot and then we said, "Why not do this, why not try this, why not try that,"

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:47.180
like everybody going a muck trying this, trying that, trying that. Everything new they should have,

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:57.800
they did not believe in what people told them before, they discarded all that and they said, "Let's try everything new."

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:03.940
Like, the other day we were having a banquet and there was an ambassador sitting next to Me

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.480
and he said, "I know, You don't like Freud." Oh, I said, " I don't like him at all."

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.920
But he said, "He told us something new, while Hume didn't tell us something new, You see."

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.540
I said, "All right, we've had dinner many a times but we have never eaten the table, let's have it."

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:29.380
[LAUGHTER] That's a new thing, why not? He was shocked at Me.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.920
He said, " Everything new can be very dangerous."

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.740
Let us try with the snakes, let us try with the tigers.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:54.220
This is the trouble with us. We have to humble down to understand that no, this

00:33:54.440 --> 00:34:01.600
is a trust of God within us - this body of ours - we have no business to insult it,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:10.360
to be disrespectful to it, to waste it - we have to respect it.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:21.280
With what difficulty it was made, the whole, you see, beautiful mechanism that is made within us

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.060
and it works so spontaneously, so beautifully -

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:31.920
even whatever you have done to it, doesn't matter, forget it -

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.600
even if you have not respected it, forget it.

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:44.740
Please don't develop any guilt - that's another disease of the modern times - everybody is guilty.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:52.540
Why are you guilty? You're human beings, if you have done mistakes so it's all right.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:59.580
It's for God to correct it - that's His job, so give Him to do that job.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.940
But we shouldn't go on doing the mistakes.

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.520
Once we're blessed by Him, let us enjoy.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:15.400
Now many scientists say that there is no God - I think it's very unscientific to say that.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:20.220
A scientist must have an open mind.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.540
If he doesn't have an open mind, he's not a scientist at all.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.440
He has not known anything about God, how does he say there's no God.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:37.240
You may say that the way religion is followed, is wrong - I agree there.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:44.340
The way they make money in the name of God, is wrong - I agree there - but there is God.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:55.580
Definitely there is God - keep your minds open like a scientist and also,

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:05.220
what I say is a hypothesis to you - tomorrow it will become a law and you'll be amazed

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:12.040
the laws of God's love are so definite,

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:20.740
unchangeable, they work so beautifully. For example, when you get your realization

00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:27.280
you feel the cool breeze on top of your head and you feel the cool breeze all around your fingers.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:36.360
These fingers tell you - one, two, three, four, five, six and seven -

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.600
seven centers that are within you - which one is catching.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:50.860
Is said so - Mohammad Sahab has said, "Your hands will tell you,

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:55.800
they will speak at the time of your resurrection."

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:04.440
Your fingers tell you what's wrong with you, they will tell you what's wrong with another person.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:14.560
And that's absolute - all those who're realized will say the same thing.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:25.220
What's wrong with this country, what's wrong with that country, and you can verify it.

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:33.720
It's very easy to verify whether it's the truth or not.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:39.200
Supposing you want to ask a question, "Is there God?" - You'll get tremendous vibrations.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:45.060
If you say, "Is Freud was a good man?" - You'll get blisters, maybe.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:56.960
So, it is within you, just to reach that point where you become so sensitive

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.840
that you can say what is what and you can verify,

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:10.240
and you can correct yourself, you can diagnose yourself, you can treat yourself, you can treat others,

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:16.600
you can help the whole world. Like one light which is enlightened can enlighten many lights -

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.380
that's how it is going to work out.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:26.960
Yesterday we spent a lot of time asking questions.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:34.520
Today if you want, you can ask but not too many and sensible questions will be better

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:44.160
because I'm not here for election. They ask me questions as if I'm standing for some election or asking for goods from you.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.220
I have come here to give you what is yours

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.060
- nothing to take.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:07.780
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:16.020
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:23.800
I will, little later we'll do that, that's good. Listening to Me you may not, may some people maybe but you will be.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:30.780
I'm happy that you're anxious to get the enlightenment - it's correct, very correct attitude.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:38.520
Does it, does it matter if you're following another teaching?

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.340
Depends on.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:50.420
You see, if you're following the teachings which are against natural things, naturally

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:59.060
how can you judge - let us see on Kundalini. Kundalini immediately indicates

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:07.960
All right? If you're following a wrong person then it indicates immediately

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:15.840
and then you better give up, all right, in that case. Whatever is good for you, you should take it.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:24.020
There have been horrible people in this world, I must confess.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:31.140
I'm very sorry, so many have been Indians who came around spoiling the name of India.

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:38.600
I don't know what to say and taking full advantage

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:44.920
of your ignorance about this knowledge.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:56.200
Uh.. I have to just say one thing, that you must give a full test

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:02.480
of these people - take a full understanding - how?

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:10.460
For example, if somebody is here and says, "You pay five hundred rupees or five hundred dollars

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:19.280
for just seeing my face," - you better never see such a face again. [LAUGHTER]

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:28.020
Or that, "There is some technique which I'll teach you." There is no technique for living things.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.800
It's already built-in, it works out by itself.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:38.240
Or anybody who says, "There's a course you have to go through," - there is no course.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:44.200
What is a course of a tree that is growing -  do you give a course to that tree?

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:50.120
All right, you have five days' course - [LAUGHTER] It will grow despite everything.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.760
Then,

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:04.660
you cannot take any money in the name of God.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:13.560
You cannot live on the earnings in the name of God.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:25.320
We don't believe in priesthoods in sahaja yoga. You have to do your normal work

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.840
you have to be married, you must have children, you must live like normal people

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.060
and be spiritually developed.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.960
We don't have all these systems that people had

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:44.800
where we become a priest and you pay them money - the priest is taking money and living on that.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:50.440
God has nothing to do with money, He actually doesn't understand any money.

00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:01.400
If you put only this test, then most of them will be finished.

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:12.580
We may say, how are they to live? They should live by, as they have been living.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:18.100
They can teach in the school, they can sell things in the market, do what they like.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:25.340
What is the need to take money?

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:33.900
Now for Me, I must say, luckily in this lifetime, I have

00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:39.940
a good husband and we're well off but still

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:46.420
if these boys want to pay, say, for My travelling they can pay to the travel agent, not to Me.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:58.920
If they give Me any presents, I can return them sweetly, something of the same kind or better.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.920
But there should not be any greed.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:12.780
Sometimes you feel like giving flowers - all right, then I must also return it.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.020
All matter has this value is to

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:27.620
gives and communicate your feelings to another - that's the only thing a matter can do

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:34.680
and that's what we should utilize it for.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:47.980
So this ghost of materialism will drop out. It's a ghost, I tell you and it's growing bigger and bigger.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:56.620
I won't be surprised after some time people won't have their hair, won't have their teeth, won't have their ears left.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:04.220
Because all kinds of things they tell you to do to your hair, all kinds of things they tell you to do to your face -

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.440
I mean, it's going on and on and on.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:14.880
The kind of food we have to eat, God knows whether we are to eating plastic or polyester. [LAUGHTER]

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:23.880
Everything becoming uh.. materialistic. With sahaja yoga

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:30.700
you can transform non-hybrid seeds for such

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:38.880
great germination power that they can produce crops better than hybrid - this we have experimented.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:52.640
What's this question there? Somebody was asking.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.560
It's gone away or what?

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:02.180
- All right.
 - Mother, [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:09.120
Can you speak out, it's raining outside, we can't hear?

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:18.740
- She tends to sleep twelve to fourteen hours a day, she said that
 - She sleeps a lot
  - sleeps a lot

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:25.520
You're left sided, that's all - we'll work it out, all right. It's very simple to give a balance to yourself.

00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:33.920
That's simple. You're a left sided person, that's why you sleep more.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:49.880
- Can, can somebody stand up and say things?
 - He's asking the question
  - Is he?

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:59.020
[INAUDIBLE AND UNCLEAR]

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:22.720
Mother, may Your Holiness explain us

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:30.800
whether there is a difference between a knowledge, a steady wisdom and Self- realization?

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:36.660
If there is a difference in what aspect do they differ?

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:42.940
- What is the difference between Self-realization and knowledge?
 - It's just the same.
  - And

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:50.160
No difference. You see in the Vedas it is written Vid - Vid is the word used in Sanskrit language -

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.440
means to know on your Central Nervous System.

00:47:53.820 --> 00:48:00.120
Whatever is known on your Central Nervous System is the knowledge, the rest of it is just

00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:05.040
'Shabd Pandityam' means only the word, the words.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.980
Words and words. Whatever you know on your Central Nervous System is the Knowledge.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.520
the rest of it is just talking, talking, talking.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:28.360
What's it? - [UNCLEAR AND INAUDIBLE]

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.660
Knowledge, wisdom and Self-realization.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:39.660
Huh.. Now, Knowledge - When you have knowledge you get wisdom automatically - is a result of that, all right?

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:55.220
- What is it yet?
 -  [UNCLEAR] he wants to be detached

00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:02.200
Yes, by, by realization you become detached and then you become wise.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:08.840
All right. By Self-realization you automatically become detached

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.200
and you develop a witness state and that's how you become wise.

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.420
All right, now let others say.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.520
These are half-read Indians. Haan, what's it?

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:37.400
- Yes, My child.
 - I have a question about re-birthing and whether that is an advanced technique, it's very common nowadays.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.120
- [UNCLEAR] re-birthing
 - Annh?
  - Re-birthing, the technique of re-birthing

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:49.980
It's the technique that's being solved in, in example in Sydney

00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:56.280
- What it is?
 - It's a technique where people are made to re-live their birth

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:05.040
- That's the vogue, that's the fashion?
 - The fashion.
  - What is that?

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:12.660
A technique called re-birthing where people pay money and they made to re-live their birth

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:19.720
their actual physical birth to clear any sub-conscious', sub-conscious blocks that are there in the system.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:23.120
She wants to know that's an advanced...
