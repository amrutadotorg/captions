00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:14.200
Today, we have decided to have a Vishnumaya
Puja. In this context, one has to know who

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:26.329
is this Vishnumaya and what is Her – you
can call it mythological [Shri Mataji laughs

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.609
gently] – but a historical relationship.
I have told you that America is the country

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:42.079
of Shri Krishna and He’s Kubera, as well
as He’s Yama. Because He’s Kubera, people

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.729
have got their affluence, they are rich people,
they have money, more than anywhere else,

00:01:48.729 --> 00:02:03.159
but if you do not remember, that you have
to have balance, and that Shri Krishna’s

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:19.849
power is of Mahalakshmi. So Mahalakshmi Principle
is such that where seeking is important, Vishnu

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:29.650
Principle is there when Shri Lakshmi is His
power. After getting the Lakshmi up to a certain

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:39.060
point, then you jump into a new awareness
or a new sort of a seeking which is the seeking

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.890
of the spirit where the Mahalakshmi principle
starts, the central path.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.829
That far, of course, in America it started,
the Mahalakshmi Principle, but people did

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:04.879
not know, they had no discretion to know which
way to go for their seeking and so many got

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:12.099
enamoured by false advertisements, by all
kinds of promises, claims and things and I

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.959
came here long time back at that moment where
I knew that the seeking now is showing results

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.469
and that all the people from all over the
world will try to come down here because there

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:37.969
was a market for them and their marketing
will start in such a manner that these people

00:03:37.969 --> 00:04:08.799
who are used to marketing will fall into it.
I came here, I think I was the first to arrive,

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:14.989
I warned them, I told them names of the people
who will be doing all this kind of work. Also

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:20.220
I told them what were they in their last lives,
what kind of a thing they did, what kind of

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.220
work they did, what are their negatives powers
and how they tried to manipulate. But nobody

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.349
would listen to me. Because these people found
out that the weaknesses of Americans, if you

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:43.759
can pamper them, pamper their ego, and tell
them that this is something very important,

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:57.750
that you should do something – ah- that
is very superficial but something looks fantastic

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.990
as I told you that they said : you can fly
three feet height. And the Americans took

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.710
to it. All such absurd ideas, they took to
it because they thought it was something new,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:18.349
something different and they wouldn’t listen
to Me because I said I won’t take money.

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:24.060
And they told Me very clearly that “Nobody
will understand you if you don’t take money.”

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.280
So I said how much will you pay Me which is
so invaluable? How much money are you going

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.860
to pay Me?” And they had no answer.
So those people who were still money-oriented,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.550
so the Mahalakshmi Principle was not in them
to understand that if you have to seek the

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.319
truth, you cannot pay for it. They couldn’t
understand that and that is how they had to

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:55.330
go through all this circle of facing all kinds
of false gurus, all types, all superficial

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.409
things.
Ultimately now, I think, first year I feel

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:14.560
everything has come up very well, but one
of the chakras of this Vishuddhi is, as you

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.020
know, very important, is the Left Vishuddhi.
And the Left Vishuddhi is the centre, if it

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:30.190
is caught up, you get angina, you get spondylitis
and also you get lethargic organs. So this

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:40.060
Left Vishuddhi has been a sort of a fashion
with the Western people, maybe because of

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.979
Christianity where you had to confess and
you have to say you’re a sinner and you’re

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.340
a born sinner, an original sinner all kinds
of things.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.900
So, as you are branded as sinner, you see,
you always felt guilty and that guilt was

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:03.479
built in, in the Left Vishuddhi. I think this
is one of the greatest drawbacks, even today,

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:12.789
that people in America feel extremely guilty
for very small things, because they have no

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:18.819
confidence in themselves. Firstly, they think
that “We are a very young nation. We had

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:26.470
no tradition – basically”. They may look
arrogant, they may look to be very show-offs,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:33.169
but basically inside, they feel that “We
have had no tradition. We are a very young

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:41.789
nation.” Like they think that the English
are too over sophisticated or the French are

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:47.240
very sophisticated and we are not, compared
to them. We are primitive.” This kind of

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:56.530
funny ideas they have. And because of this,
you see, they try to make up. To make it up,

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:05.550
the path they followed ended up into all kinds
of things and it built up a very huge Left

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:16.930
Vishuddhi in them. That’s why Americans
are having so many problems of the Left Vishuddhi.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:25.060
First of all, this centre catches when you
do not want to face your mistakes. “I’ve

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.030
committed this mistake all right, I’ve committed
it, now I’m not going to do it, and why

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:34.680
I commit it and why it happened, just face
it.” They don’t want to. They will feel

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.900
guilty that we have done this or I’ll put
it here. [Shri Mataji puts Her hand on Her

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:44.160
left shoulder, close to the neck] Like, they
go on amassing, like very black clouds of

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:54.160
guilt.
Then this Vishnumaya, who is the thunder,

00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:05.780
we can call, who is the electrical charge,
which is liberated by the friction of these

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:17.660
black clouds, which actually is a catalyst
for rain. It’s a catalyst for rain. This

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:32.760
starts acting on such people, that is, they
suddenly get a shock. They become extremely

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:44.830
sensitive people. They get nervous and this
nervousness can make, makes them think “Why

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:51.100
are we nervous? What is the problem?” Like
the exposure of their guilt comes through

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.510
the Vishnumaya Power.
Now I have to tell you about also the origin

00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:01.020
of Vishnumaya, which is very interesting.
Vishnumaya was the sister of Shri Krishna,

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:09.040
who was born after Shri Krishna was born.
Actually She was not His own sister, but She

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:19.120
was a daughter of Nanda. And when Shri Krishna
was taken over and was put in the care of

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:27.350
Nand and Yeshoda they gave their own daughter
in His place and the father of Shri Krishna

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:35.870
brought it back [in the castle]. So when Kamsa
came – the uncle- you all know about the

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:42.870
story – to ask about the eighth child, they
said, “This is the child.” He said, “But

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:50.070
this’s not a man. This is a woman.” He
took the child in his hand and did like this

00:10:50.070 --> 00:11:00.600
and threw it in the sky. And there She went
and there She announced that : “Shri Krishna

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:11.070
is already incarnated, He is living and He
is your killer.” So She is the announcer.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:18.040
She is the announcer of the incarnations.
She is the announcer of something good that

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:33.560
is going to happen to you. Also She’s the
one who can burn things, which are not spiritually

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:41.420
all right.
At the time of Mahabharata, She was born as

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:52.950
Draupadi and this Draupadi was the sister
of Shri Rama and when, as you know in Mahabharata

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:59.910
– all of you know the story of Mahabharata,
I need not tell that – Duryodhana tried

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:06.980
to take out Her clothes. Then She called for
Krishna. First She said, “Kri.” She had

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:13.280
put Her teeth like this [Shri Mataji holds
her own sari with her teeth]. Till She had

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.460
said, “Krish,” [the sari] it was there.
Because She was thinking if She said “shna,”

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:27.140
the thing will fall down and She ‘ll become
exposed. As soon as She said, “Krishna,”

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:34.670
the thing fell down and that’s the time
Shri Krishna came all the way from Dwarika

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:40.160
and Tulsida has here described it very well
in Hindi language : “Dwarika me Shabad gayo

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:48.420
[message went to Dwarika]”. In Dwarika,
there was a big – big noise, you can call

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:58.180
it or what I don’t know. “Shor bhayo,
shor bhayo bhare [caused comotion ; shora:

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:03.320
noise, bhare : to fill] – tremendous, what
you call the – thunder, you can call it,

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:10.190
because She was the one who’s responsible
for thunder. “Shor bhayo bhare, Shankha

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:17.560
(conch) Chakra (disc) Gada Padma (weapon)
Garuda le sidhare” With the shankar, with

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:26.610
Chakra, with Garuda, with Padma, all of them,
He came on the Garuda. With all His weapons,

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:37.520
He came on a Garuda to help Her. He started
supplying the saris to Her and this Duryodhana

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:45.980
got absolutely – Dushansana did that – got
absolutely tired and he fell on the ground.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:53.500
So now here, Vishnumaya is the one who is
the virgin. Not only that She is a virgin,

00:13:53.500 --> 00:14:02.040
but She exists in all the five elements as
shown that She married five Pandavas and that

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:19.760
this power of virginity in Her used to expose
people to the dangers of these horrible Kauravas

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:30.620
who were going to rule and destroy the dharma.
So She stood back and She is the one who said

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:36.670
that “You have to fight. You have to fight
for dharma, whatever may happen” and Krishna

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:43.470
always supported Her. So as a brother, Shri
Krishna supported Her, so the relationship

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:51.300
between brother and sister are very important
in India. Also should be with Sahaja Yogis

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:57.050
because we have raki bandhan. You also have
what you call the bhaiya duj [Hindi; Bhau

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:03.370
bij in Marathi], where on Diwali day we tie
up a raki to the Brother. Now this raki is

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:09.250
nothing but the Vishnumaya’s power, which
protects the brother. Actually, there the

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:14.980
brother protected Her and now the sister’s
love protects the brother. So the relationship

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:21.220
between brother and sister is much more important
than any other relationship because it’s

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:29.320
so pure, it’s so protective, it’s so loving
and also it is of an equal age.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:36.480
For example, between the parents and the children,
cannot be that or say, between the grandparents

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.610
and the children can be quite imbalanced also.
But between the brother and sister they’re

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:49.430
of the same age group, same understanding
and this relationship is maintained by this

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:55.900
Vishnumaya.
We have a very good incident of that in India,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:03.430
which I must tell you, how this Rakhi Bandhan
or this relationship between brother and sister

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:10.120
is respected. I mean nobody will believe because
in these countries where there is no relationship

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:16.600
which is respected, we won’t understand.
But when Alexander the Great came to India,

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:23.550
he conquered our country quite a lot. But
there was one king Poru, who defeated him

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:32.680
and put him in jail. Alexander had married
an Indian lady. So it was a day of this Rakhi

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:40.980
Purnima. She put one rakhi in one plate and
covered it up and sent it to this king Poru.

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:46.090
So they said : “a rakhi has come.” So
the King said : “All right, tie up the rakhi.”

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:51.360
He didn’t know whose rakhi it was and it
was tied. He said, “Who’s rakhi it was?”

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.070
“It’s your sister’s.” “Who is my
sister?” “She is the wife of this King

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:03.590
Alexander.” “Oh, my God! How could I do
such a thing? He is my brother-in-law.”

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:12.120
He immediately went to the jail and prostrated
before him. He said, “I’m sorry. Whatever

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:19.429
I -”. This is the graciousness, you understand.
“How could I be – how could I be so stupid

00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:26.019
as to arrest you?” Alexander was flabbergasted.
He couldn’t understand this reaction. He

00:17:26.019 --> 00:17:35.529
said, “What’s this going on?” And he
said that “Now, I ask for your forgiveness

00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:41.559
and please come out.” With great pomp and
show, with ornaments for his sister and all

00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:48.279
that, he sent the brother-in-law home. Now
this Alexander could not understand. He went

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:53.970
in and his wife was smiling. He said, “What’s
the matter? How am I here?” She said, “Do

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:59.809
you know, I have saved you with one thread?”
She showed him a rakhi. “With this thread

00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:05.940
you saved me? How?” She said, “You know
what is today? Is a day when a sister can

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:13.549
tie this to a brother and the brother has
to do what sister wants. So I said I sent

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:22.210
it to this Poru, the king, and he has released
you.” Alexander thought, “What sort people

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:27.340
these Indians are? On one thread they release
such an enemy like me. How can I rule this

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:32.070
people? They’ll put me out any time, so
symbolic they are.” He said, “All right,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:38.490
I am sorry.” He took one fellow called Bardai,
Chanda Bardai, took him down – he was a

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:43.870
poet with him, and he said, : “Now, you
write poetry because Indians are very subtle

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.860
people and I can’t understand how can they
release such a horrible enemy like me, only

00:18:48.860 --> 00:19:00.250
on a thread?” Such trust, such understanding
of a brother for a sister and the sister has

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:07.080
to keep the trust also.
So now when we go deeper into it and see for

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:18.029
ourselves, our Vishuddhi problems is this
that we always try, in the West, to feel guilty

00:19:18.029 --> 00:19:28.070
and get out of our mistakes. For small, small
things feel guilty, people, because the norms

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:35.250
in the West – Western life are so rigid,
like if you put a spoon on the other side,

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:41.200
finished. I mean what does it matter? You
can take it on this side and eat it. If you

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:50.620
spill some coffee, then that guilt will last
all your life. After all coffee is to be spilt.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:57.570
[big laughs] If it is hot, it can happen,
some accident can take place. And the guilt

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:04.899
business is so great that nobody corrects
oneself, just go on feeling guilty, guilty,

00:20:04.899 --> 00:20:12.929
guilty, guilty. And all the subtleties of
life you start missing. In Sahaja Yoga, specially,

00:20:12.929 --> 00:20:19.870
to feel guilty means all your left side is
caught up. You cannot feel the vibrations

00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:25.340
properly because this is the cervical nerve
on which your guilt is sitting and it’s

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:32.159
just clamping it, you cannot feel the left
side. You start catching on the left side

00:20:32.159 --> 00:20:41.399
till you receive some sort of a horrible disease,
then you realize.

00:20:41.399 --> 00:20:51.419
The subtler part of this Vishnumaya is that
She knows the truth. When She shines you can

00:20:51.419 --> 00:21:02.080
see everything out of Her. Even for a short
time, She exposes in the darkness everything.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:11.659
In the same way, when Vishnumaya starts acting
on you, then She exposes the truth to you.

00:21:11.659 --> 00:21:21.120
But supposing you continue with your left
Vishuddhi too much, then She just disappears.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:27.980
She’s not there to correct you, to help
you in any way or to expose you. Then you

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:34.779
don’t feel anything. You become numb on
the left side, absolutely numb on the left

00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:46.210
side and the left side is, know, is the indicator
of all kinds of left side diseases. This is

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:53.080
one of the reasons that we have the maximum
number of left-sided diseases in the West

00:21:53.080 --> 00:22:01.460
than in India. Indian diseases are from right
side while the left-sided diseases come from

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:10.870
this left Vishuddhi. So to feel guilty, itself
is wrong and is a mythical thing.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:20.070
Now you feel guilty for something. What’s
the use of feeling guilty? It’s just a myth.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:27.009
It’s an empty thing you are carrying upon
yourself. No use feeling guilty. If you think

00:22:27.009 --> 00:22:32.769
you have done something wrong, just face it.
That I have done this wrong and I will not

00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:38.190
do it again. But if you feel guilty, then
you see, it’s like a stored up stuff there

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:42.909
and then again you do the same mistake. Again
you do the same mistake and you become immune,

00:22:42.909 --> 00:22:51.700
immune to your development. Then you start
not even feeling that it is wrong, you know.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:58.850
People do wrong things even without thinking
that it is wrong. Even that consciousness

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:05.639
or, you can say, that alertness is finished.
Then you think, “What’s wrong?” For

00:23:05.639 --> 00:23:11.960
anything, this is a very good answer, “What’s
wrong?” It’s like a drunkard, he starts

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.870
drinking. First he feels, “Oh, I should
not have done.” Then he starts little bit

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:20.759
more, then little bit more, little bit more.
Ultimately, he’ll say “What’s wrong?

00:23:20.759 --> 00:23:21.659
If I’m drinking is perfect.”

00:23:21.659 --> 00:23:31.499
Anything of that kind starts with left Vishuddhi
because we do not face the mistake. It’s

00:23:31.499 --> 00:23:39.639
not true that because your tradition has been
very short or anything, it’s only thing

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:47.899
your attitude. Because it is Krishna’s place,
especially for Americans, it is very important

00:23:47.899 --> 00:23:53.409
to face their mistakes and to admit, “All
right, I have done this mistake and I’m

00:23:53.409 --> 00:23:56.590
not going to do it.”

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:03.659
So because they do not want to admit, they
put up this arrogant behavior. I know underneath

00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:15.460
this arrogant there’s somebody who is very
guilty. They are, actually, here very collective,

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:24.759
also, very collective in the sense they will
be worried about Vietnam, Korea, everything.

00:24:24.759 --> 00:24:29.899
Anything happens in the world they are worried
about. They are, they are the ones who started

00:24:29.899 --> 00:24:36.409
UN and every sort of thing, you see. Everything
is there. But despite all that, this guilt

00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:45.119
business makes them very insensitive, very
insensitive to things which are reality.

00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:53.799
Anything which is negative, they should face
that thing as negative that they don’t face.

00:24:53.799 --> 00:24:59.769
They will support a country which is despotic
despite the fact they are democratic country.

00:24:59.769 --> 00:25:06.610
All such things, not only in politics, but
also in day to day life. Then the whole thing

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:17.809
becomes such a lifestyle. It becomes a lifestyle.
The whole thing becomes collective. Nobody

00:25:17.809 --> 00:25:23.600
ever can come and say that this is something
we are doing wrong and we should stop it.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.970
If somebody says that or they say he’s mad,
he’s no good.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:34.600
For Freud, I was telling you that Freud was
denounced by many people and people gave some

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:41.320
papers, everything happened, but nobody would
listen to them. And the same thing happened

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:48.649
with Sahaja Yoga also. They would not listen
to Me because they have developed a immunity

00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:58.710
against reality. In everything, whatever is
real they become immune to it. They do not

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:09.480
want to face it. ‘That’s too much, much
too much for me.’ With this kind of an attitude,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:15.990
they had to work out something else and in
that they have gone to the right side. With

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:21.999
that they have developed all kind of machinery,
science, all this, everything. But science

00:26:21.999 --> 00:26:29.700
is not conclusive. It cannot give you the
totality. It cannot give the reality.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:39.749
So this Vishnumaya shows Her strength. She
does lots of things by which people are frightened.

00:26:39.749 --> 00:26:53.480
She can enter into any, any element. She can
permeate. Supposing She enters into a water

00:26:53.480 --> 00:27:03.049
element, She can create a typhoon. She can
create any kind of disasters. She can enter

00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:14.429
into Mother Earth and She can create a earthquake.
She can do anything because She has a power

00:27:14.429 --> 00:27:18.899
to enter into anything. You know that She
can enter into Mother Earth very easily. She

00:27:18.899 --> 00:27:24.950
can enter into water very easily and when
She gets into it, She becomes the catalyst.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:34.249
And all these problems that you are facing
today in America are because of left Vishuddhi,

00:27:34.249 --> 00:27:35.639
because of Vishnumaya.

00:27:35.639 --> 00:27:43.309
I’m happy today’s program has been arranged
for Vishnumaya because this is the power which

00:27:43.309 --> 00:27:53.139
you Sahaja Yogis should be able to harness
and should be able to worship so that She

00:27:53.139 --> 00:28:00.179
sees all of you there and She looks after
you and She maintains your life and looks

00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:04.090
after you.

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:17.289
Now the most difficult thing is to convince
people in America that money’s not everything.

00:28:17.289 --> 00:28:27.899
You may have any amount of money, you may
have any amount of so-called pleasures, everything,

00:28:27.899 --> 00:28:35.460
but still, you can never be satisfied and
you can never be at peace with yourself and

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:45.509
you cannot generate peace. Money cannot replace
reality. It’s just there.

00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:56.509
Now the problem is that people become so addicted
to this money that all value systems start

00:28:56.509 --> 00:29:12.480
going down. I was surprised I knew somebody
here who took his own sister for prostitution.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.799
So I said, “What’s this? What are you
doing?”

00:29:15.799 --> 00:29:19.330
“What’s wrong? We’ll get money.”

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:26.909
So whatever can get money, they indulge into.
So there’s no chastity which is the basics,

00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:38.289
which is the foundation of human beings. As
a result, when you insult this virginity of

00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:48.210
Vishnumaya, then the Maya – means the – Her
play is that you get AIDS, you get all kinds

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:53.899
of other diseases which are incurable and
which are what you can call as the secret

00:29:53.899 --> 00:30:08.169
diseases. Because She’s the virgin and because
She respects the virginity. And those who

00:30:08.169 --> 00:30:15.320
go against, not that virginity is meant only
for women, also meant for men, because everybody

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:22.080
has here left Vishuddhi. Here the idea is
that only the virginity is word used for women

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:30.929
only. It’s not. Even the men who do not
respect their virginity, their chastity are

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:37.429
attacked by Vishnumaya in different ways.
I’m not surprised that Los Angeles, they

00:30:37.429 --> 00:30:44.619
say, is in danger all the time, because of
your cinemas you produce, all these things

00:30:44.619 --> 00:30:48.769
you produce.

00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:56.019
Of course, I mean now with the Sahaja Yoga
being established very well in Los Angeles,

00:30:56.019 --> 00:31:03.609
thing may be averted, but still it’s very
dangerous. It’s one of the most powerful

00:31:03.609 --> 00:31:18.009
Shakti is this of Vishnumaya because She plays
the illusion. She creates the Maya also. Also

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:27.489
She breaks the Maya and She can burn anything.
Your forest is burning now. Sixty-five hectares

00:31:27.489 --> 00:31:37.450
of land is burning. Who has done this? Is
nothing but Vishnumaya. Nobody has to take

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:45.879
any matchbox for that. She can burn anything
and is Her burning gives you the feeling that

00:31:45.879 --> 00:31:56.359
if there’s an electrical charge, as if burnt
with electrical charge. This is very true

00:31:56.359 --> 00:32:03.649
in so many cases I’ve seen. Those who came
to Me with problems of left Vishuddhi, that

00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:08.080
they said that, “We think that there’s
some electrical charge coming out of here.”

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:18.200
As if it’s the burning of an electrical
shock. This is Vishnumaya’s doing and She’s

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:27.460
the one who is the corrector. She corrects.
Don’t feel guilty. Face your problems. It’s

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:38.809
sort of when we hide our mistakes in the name
of guilt, when we try to camouflage it, She’s

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:51.850
the one who exposes it on individual level,
on collective level, on national level, international

00:32:51.850 --> 00:33:01.749
level. Because She can permeate into anything
and this permeation of Hers gives Her such

00:33:01.749 --> 00:33:15.239
subtleties. But people cannot relate disaster
to their mistakes. They cannot. They don’t

00:33:15.239 --> 00:33:21.929
understand why such a disaster has taken place,
what has happened.

00:33:21.929 --> 00:33:33.600
There was a big typhoon that came, came up
to a point and suddenly turned towards Kauai.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:40.389
Now what was the reason for that, to go and
hit Kauai? In Kauai there is a Swayambu of

00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:48.700
Shiva, is a fact. People are making money
out of it, quite a lot of money and deceiving

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:58.169
people. There’s big business going on in
the name of Shiva. So Kauai was hit, not Hawaii

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:04.889
so much as Kauai, and it turned suddenly,
no one can understand that.

00:34:04.889 --> 00:34:11.470
So all these thundering things that are coming
from nature, anything, whether it is earthquake

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:21.060
or it is landslide or it could be floods or
it could be typhoon, anything is the work

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:29.440
of this Vishnumaya or we can say all natural
catastrophes are brought about by this Vishnumaya.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.919
She has this power to do it. This is the only
way they can shock people, but despite all

00:34:35.919 --> 00:34:43.370
that shocking, people have to relate these
disasters so their mistakes that they have

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:49.520
committed and have nicely kept it here, not
facing it.

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:56.440
I’ve heard from some Indian students that
when they came to America some boys asked

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:01.680
them to take drugs and do all other things
also. So they wouldn’t do. They said, “You

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.200
are goody-goodies,” this, that. You know,
they just pumped it into their head that,

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:12.250
“You have to do it. You are cowards. You
cannot do it.” And all that. So some of

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:16.560
them said, “All right, we’ll try.” But
what surprised them that they knew it was

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:20.170
wrong while those who were telling them never
thought it was wrong. They thought they have

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:27.900
been great martyrs or they have been liberators
and they have got liberties. They couldn’t

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.320
understand this.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:38.440
This kind of liberty that they were boasting
of was so destructive. They’d never understood

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:46.810
that this is destructive. So once your left
Vishuddhi is absolutely jammed, you lose complete

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:56.230
discretion of the chakra here which we call
as Hamsa chakra and then you do not know what

00:35:56.230 --> 00:36:01.590
is destructive, what is constructive. You
start accepting mostly the destructive thing

00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:13.660
if your left Vishuddhi is bad. Escape. “So
what. What wrong?” That is how violence

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:23.590
has come. That is how all kind of cheating,
corruption has come. “What’s wrong?”

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:27.480
Because if you do anything wrong you put it
there. Finished. Stored up.. Again, you do

00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:34.780
anything, you put it there and till you become
absolutely immune to all destructive action,

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.310
you go on doing.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:48.920
So to get out of it, what to do. To get out
of this horrible state where you do not feel

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:56.780
anything wrong, what is the thing is only
is to take to Sahaja Yoga in a right fashion.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:11.410
First of all, you must face yourself. If you
start facing yourself, you’ll realize that

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:19.040
you have committed a mistake. “So this is
the mistake I have committed. Doesn’t matter.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.580
I am not going to feel guilty about it. If
I ever have to do this, I will not do it and

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:29.420
I’m not guilty for whatever has happened.
Is the past. Finished.”

00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:38.640
With this faith in yourself, you can definitely
get rid of your left Vishuddhi. The problem

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:46.020
is even if I tell you something, I am worried
that you start feeling guilty about it also.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:50.680
I mean, I am telling you for something for
your correction. Then you start guilty that,

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:56.830
“Oh, I – Mother is saying, so you see,
I did this and -” that you did. At this

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:04.690
moment what I am telling you, never to do
it again. And face it. Whatever you did is

00:38:04.690 --> 00:38:14.490
finished and gone and is forgiven completely,
otherwise Vishnumaya will take over. This

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:24.830
is very important because one side is the
leela, it’s a play and it’s all the world

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:31.670
is beautiful. The another side is the guilt.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:37.660
So we think that by just feeling guilty, we
are solving all our problems and this side

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:43.640
we are enjoying ourselves and this, the guilt
part, is just like a storehouse of a garbage

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:51.930
we put there. But we never think this garbage
what it is wrong, it is doing to us. And this

00:38:51.930 --> 00:39:00.880
is what it is that Vishnumaya has to burn
this garbage, then She works in Her own ways,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.150
in Her own Maya ways and so many things happen.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:11.600
Like there was a lady and she was very right-sided.
She used to dominate everyone, but nobody

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.910
dared tell her that because, if you tell her,
she would come back on you. So nobody wanted

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:21.040
to tell her what’s wrong with her. They
said, “All right. Let it be.” But I told

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.010
her, “That you see you are very right-sided.
You are dominating everyone. Everybody’s

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:29.950
frightened of you.” So she said, “No,
Mother, I’m not.” I said, “All right

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:37.550
I’m telling you. You better believe Me or
really you are in for trouble.” And that

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:43.960
very day she was getting down from the staircase
and she fell from top to bottom she did and

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:49.370
all her right side. She came to Me, “Mother,
you see.” Her right hand is broken. “My

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:56.380
right leg is broken. This is broken. That
is broken.” I said, “Then you know what

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:03.550
happened.” “I now know why it has happened.”
Then I cured her. She was all right. But what

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:10.260
I am trying to tell you that she wouldn’t
listen to Me. So the right-sided people have

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:19.180
a special capacity to put everything here.
So I always say that it is the by-product

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:32.150
of ego. Those people who try to dominate,
who try to be angry, try to control everyone,

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:42.910
they put it down there and then the whole
thing works against them. This is to be understood

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:49.170
in a very serious manner, that feeling guilty
is not that you are harming yourself, but

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:52.660
you are harming all others.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:41:03.050
Also this Vishnumaya gets very upset with
two other things. One of the things is smoking.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:12.040
If you smoke too much, then this Vishnumaya
gets very angry. She is the one who then causes

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:20.970
cancer. She can spoil your throat. I mean,
all kinds of ear, nose, throat problems can

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:30.230
come in with the smoking because She doesn’t
like that smoke. She – once, twice, thrice

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:37.150
– but once you start smoking and after some
time, “Oh, what’s wrong?” They will

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:43.900
quote such and such man who is eighty-three,
he still smokes. See, quoting like this, they

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:49.920
have ideals like this. Then you have also
some cinema heroes. “Such and such man,

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:57.280
see, he murdered his wife. He’s not – see,
he’s going along.” So we should also murder.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:02.570
We should also smoke. So the all ideals which
have destroyed themselves become our ideals

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:11.080
and we start exactly doing what they are doing
without knowing that how they are destroyed,

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.220
we’ll be also destroyed.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:25.340
So this understanding about Vishnumaya’s
powers should be there with us. That if we

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:37.990
try to continue with our mistakes and putting
them here, then first thing we become vulnerable

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:47.820
to all kinds of diseases. With that if you
are smoking, you can become also very much

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:57.760
vulnerable to cancer of the throat. Another
thing which people do not know is the mantras.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:03.610
If you go on saying any mantra – I mean
in India there are people who will every day,

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:11.730
morning get up and say some mantra for about,
say, hundred times, some say it at least three

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:17.160
hundred times, five hundred times. They go
on measuring, mantra, mantra, mantra, mantra,

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:25.400
like that. Now She’s the mantrika. She’s
the one who gives the power to the mantra.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:33.970
Now if you are not connected to this Divine
Power, then there’s a short-circuiting takes

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:39.300
place and if you go on saying this mantra,
you develop all the troubles of the throat,

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:45.520
throat cancer. You can develop also stomach,
in the stomach, problems because it is Krishna

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:55.120
and Vishnu are the same. You might develop
also the problem of Virata. Because you are

00:43:55.120 --> 00:44:03.710
reciting a mantra like this, you see – a
telephone, if it is not connected, I go on

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:07.700
using it, the telephone will go out of order.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:16.240
In the same way, if you are doing wrong mantras
in the sense that the mantras which are said

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:23.470
before you have connection with the Divine,
then they can spoil your left Vishuddhi, like

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:32.140
this. This is the style they use in India.
Supposing you are a business man in India.

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:37.160
Now a big business man, you have made a lot
of money, now you feel guilty about it because

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:43.450
you have made by bad means, also by all kinds
of black-market and all that sort of things.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:52.930
So they’ll make a big temple of Vishnu,
not Vishuddhi but they’ll make a very big

00:44:52.930 --> 00:45:00.830
temple of Shri Vishnu and they will create
a kind of image that they are great religious

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:06.690
people. Or they’ll have khairat, means they
will distribute food to people or distribute

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:13.930
some things to people and feel satisfied.
Here you go on committing any amount of sins,

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:24.250
any amount of nonsense and then out of that
money you make a little contribution to Shri

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:30.710
Vishnu thinking that Shri Vishnu will be very
happy and will not punish them. But He’s

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:35.900
Kubera, what can you give it to Him. He’s
the Kubera. He gives you all the money. He

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:46.220
does everything. So how can you give anything
to Kubera who is Himself the Lord of wealth.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:52.280
It’s a very common thing in India, like
there was a bhudan [donating land] thing.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:58.960
I knew of a man who was very corrupt, very
bad person, I mean really, he was really very,

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.370
very bad man and he had taken away so much
land from the poor farmers and all that. So

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:13.540
he gave one land to Mahatma Gandhi and this
land, this bhudan land was no good, it was,

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:20.540
you know, I think why he gave. This land was
so bad that you could not put even cactus

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:29.200
there and he was telling everybody, “I have
given so much land to bhudan. I have given

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:33.870
so much land to bhudan.” So trying to sort
of justify himself for taking all the land

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:42.010
from the poor and flinching them and then
to do this kind of a generosity.

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:51.070
So this is another escape people have, that
do what you like and ultimately be generous.

00:46:51.070 --> 00:47:01.460
This kind of gracious covering of your mistakes
can be very misleading. It doesn’t work

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:08.010
with Vishnumaya. She knows you out and out
and if you try all these tricks with Her,

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:15.650
She will show Her own powers. I would say
all our left side problems come because of

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:25.550
Vishnumaya power. She punishes you, as well
as She exposes, as well as She gives you light,

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:29.160
as well as She corrects you.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:39.670
With all these powers of Vishnumaya, we should
be very thankful that today we are celebrating

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:46.010
Her special puja because I think it is one
of the curses of the West, especially of Americans

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:48.190
to feel guilty.

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:54.920
So today you all have to promise in your heart
that the mantra is – now She also understands

00:47:54.920 --> 00:48:01.900
English perhaps – you can say that, “Mother,
I am not guilty at all.” That’s all. If

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.940
that is said, She will be very happy. “I’m
not guilty at all. I’m not going to feel

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:12.220
guilty.” Once you stop feeling guilty you
will not do wrong things because how will

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:17.030
you manage. Because you are not doing, you
cannot put it as guilt, so what’s the use

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:21.760
of doing anything wrong. If you do wrong,
it comes on your head, you cannot put it in

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:29.540
your left Vishuddhi, so you won’t do anything
wrong. You will immediately understand that

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:34.800
if I have to do wrong, I have to face it.
But if there’s a space here, kept where

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:42.530
you can put your guilt for your wrong doings
available, then you don’t mind so much.

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:46.270
Supposing somebody has a small house, no place
to store, then somebody brings something.

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:55.890
Says, “No, no, no, no space here. I am all
ready very full.” It’s like that.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:49:02.760
So the best thing is to have no guilt at any
cost. I will have no guilt. If I have done

00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:08.590
mistake, all right I’ll admit I have done
the mistake and I’ll have no guilt at all

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:14.640
about it. I’ll face it. You’ll be surprised.
You’ll stop doing wrong things. Definitely

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:18.070
you’ll stop because there’s no space left.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:26.700
So this is very important today to do Vishnumaya’s
thing and I am sure now very happy with the

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:32.690
tour of America. This time I’m really happy
because I think it has worked in most of the

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:40.580
places very well, and if it has not worked,
one should not feel guilty, but face the problem,

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:48.810
why it has not worked and the problem lies
with Sahaja Yogis and nobody else. You shouldn’t

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:56.020
blame anybody else for it. Just see yourself,
what mistakes you must have committed. Could

00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:03.230
be a small or big mistake. Whatever it is,
face it. There’s no harm in saying, “I

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:09.470
have done mistake.” But if you say, “Sorry,”
means it goes there, straight off. No, “I

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:18.330
have committed a mistake.” To admit that
is very gracious, very beautiful and very

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:20.410
kind to yourself for your benevolence.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:27.500
In Sahaja Yoga it’s one of the biggest mantras
for all the Western people. They should all

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:35.880
the time say to all the trees, all the nature
around, “I am not guilty”. Your ecological

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:43.930
problem will improve because then you won’t
do wrong things to spoil your ecology. You’ll

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:48.320
be careful because you spoil it and you’ll
feel guilty, “Oh, I should not have done

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:53.620
this. Oh, I should not.” But why did you
do in the first place is the point. So now,

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:56.730
next time you are not going to do it.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:04.000
So many of our problems will be solved if
you face them and correct them boldly. It’s

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.390
possible for Sahaja Yogis because you are
separated from your being, you’re away from

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:15.210
it. You can see your body, you can see your
mind, you can see your ego, you can see all

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:21.700
of those things and you know how to put them
right. You are not that, you know, so you

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:28.880
are the spirit and with the light of the spirit
you can correct all these things. But this

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:35.360
guilt is something where it stops you completely
from correcting or doing anything better about

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:41.110
it or bringing any constructive thing to your
own mind.

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:50.110
This will solve many problems for America,
as well as for all the Western world. Same

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:56.040
with the Indians, that they should not think
that if they are generous a little bit they

00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:00.370
can get rid of their mistakes. See, they have
to face it. It’s a different style. Indians

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:08.670
are very clever, you know, they know how to
find excuses and escapes. But after all, it

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:15.940
is Vishnumaya. She will show you that there
is no escape, just face it. There’s no need

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:23.520
to condemn yourself, no need to, in any way,
degrade yourself or to feel inferior, but

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:29.130
to be superior as the spirit, I see. Like
I would say, “All right, Nirmala, I see

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:34.730
you very well now, you did this.” Separate
yourself from yourself. You can talk on the

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:41.940
mirror. You can go to the river and talk there
or you can go to an ocean and tell them that,

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:47.660
“See, I’ve done this mistake and now I’m
not going to do it.” You can make promises

00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:49.490
to all of these elements.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:56.310
Once you make these promises, this Vishnumaya
will receive the message and She won’t enter

00:52:56.310 --> 00:53:00.950
into any one of these elements to disturb
you. So you have to go and tell the ocean

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:08.720
that, “All right, America is not guilty
for whatever they have done.” Say like that.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.980
If you say is all right, not other people
because I told your genetics are changed.

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:20.840
You are different people. Whatever you say,
Vishnumaya will always believe in and everything

00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:23.380
will work out very well.

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:29.760
But this is a special time, as I told you
before where we call it is the Krita Yuga,

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:35.630
where between the Kali Yuga and Satya Yuga
this time is so important that whatever mistakes

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:40.010
we have committed, we have to pay for it.
Is a karmaphala [consequences of past deeds].

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:44.240
It won’t work out by just putting it here.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:52.910
So one has to get to realization, change the
genetics completely and then you can go and

00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:58.220
tell the nature that, “All right, we are
not guilty now. We have got our realization.”

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:04.660
And it will work, I am sure. So many of catastrophes
of this country can be avoided by you Sahaja Yogis.

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.820
May God bless you!
