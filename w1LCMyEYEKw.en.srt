1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:08,840
Today we are going to do the worship of Shri Krishna.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,600
Shri Krishna came at a time on this earth

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:23,640
when in India the people were very much ritualistic.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,480
They had become slaves of the so-called Brahmins

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,760
who had no idea about God at all

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,640
because they started a theme

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,640
that a Brahmin can have a Brahmin son.

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:52,040
So the birth determined the caste of a person.

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,200
Before that,

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,480
it was not that a Brahmin would have a Brahmin as his son.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,280
It’s also true that if you are a Realized soul,

12
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,960
in the real sense, if you are a really Realized soul,

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,080
then you must have a child which is a Realized soul.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,600
And that is how also

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,640
if it was said that if the father is a Brahmin, is a Realized soul,

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,440
his son also becomes a Brahmin.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,120
Because you are a Sahaja Yogi now you can understand

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,040
that a Sahaja Yogi’s son normally becomes a Sahaja Yogi.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,840
So it was agreed that

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,200
children of a Brahmin will be called as a Brahmin.

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
Gradually, it amounted to this

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,240
that any child born out

23
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,560
of a Brahmin was called as Brahmin.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,440
Now, we have seen that many Sahaja Yogis also don’t have

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,160
Realized souls as their children.

26
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,440
Maybe their own karmas,

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,760
maybe the child, anything it is,

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,120
but even I have seen some Sahaja Yogis having horribly

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,520
devilish children.

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:18,200
So, it shows that it is not through your birth

31
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,680
you can claim that you are a Brahmin

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,160
or the one who has known the Brahma.

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,000
Brahma is the All-pervading power.

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,520
So you have to be a Brahmin by your karma,

35
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,360
by what you do.

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,800
That is how we have got Valmiki who was just a fisherman.

37
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:42,545
He wrote Ramayana, he was a great Brahmin.

38
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,732
Then you have got Vyasa who wrote Gita.

39
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:52,826
He was an illegitimate son of a fisherwoman and he wrote Gita.

40
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:59,906
So this idea was flouted by Shri Krishna's incarnation.

41
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:04,946
He wanted to flout this idea that Brahmins are the ones

42
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:08,146
who can only worship God.

43
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:14,346
So to put another extreme

44
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:18,546
to what Rama has created,

45
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:21,466
to bring people into the centre,

46
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:25,506
because through Rama they went to another rigid form

47
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:27,906
and rigidity of ritualism

48
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:33,986
and too much of fundamentalism.

49
00:03:34,306 --> 00:03:35,986
So to put an end to that

50
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:39,026
he wanted to bring the society to another extreme.

51
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:45,066
Of course Shri Rama himself incarnated as Shri Krishna.

52
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:49,826
So he started a new theme of,

53
00:03:50,026 --> 00:03:56,266
which was absolutely eventual, it was just absolutely evolutionary

54
00:03:56,466 --> 00:03:58,866
that such a new theme should come up.

55
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:04,066
And this new theme was that the whole thing is nothing but a Leela.

56
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,266
It's just a play, it's a Leela.

57
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:11,026
So not to be taken that seriously, not to be so rigid,

58
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:17,706
not to be fundamental, not to be so particular about something.

59
00:04:18,026 --> 00:04:20,426
So the whole thing is a Leela.

60
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:25,026
And on this theme he worked out everything

61
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:28,386
to establish that it is a play.

62
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:32,026
And that is what you see in America,

63
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:35,386
very common that for people it has become a joke,

64
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:38,146
life has become a joke.

65
00:04:38,426 --> 00:04:41,106
And they think that life is not to be taken seriously,

66
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:45,386
there is more fun in doing all kinds of things

67
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:51,506
than in getting into any kind of inhibitions, as they call it,

68
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:57,226
or maybe some sort of forms or patterns.

69
00:04:57,586 --> 00:05:00,466
But it is a myth with Americans now

70
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,506
because for that you have to have Shri Krishna,

71
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:05,546
you have to have realisation.

72
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:08,586
Like if you are standing in the water,

73
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:15,786
the waves of the water are there absolutely real for you and you,

74
00:05:16,986 --> 00:05:21,706
if you think it's a illusion you'll be completely finished.

75
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:25,826
The illusion will prove that it's not an illusion

76
00:05:26,026 --> 00:05:28,106
by asserting itself.

77
00:05:28,346 --> 00:05:30,226
But if you're in the boat

78
00:05:30,506 --> 00:05:34,386
then the water that is around is an illusion.

79
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,066
So it's the state at which you are.

80
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:41,746
If you are in the state of self-realised mind,

81
00:05:41,946 --> 00:05:46,346
then everything is an illusion, but otherwise it is not.

82
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:50,426
It is a reality. So what they forgot this point,

83
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:53,666
that you are not in that state to call it an illusion.

84
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:57,786
So to call everything an illusion is just to delude yourself,

85
00:05:58,226 --> 00:05:59,546
thinking that it's an illusion

86
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:03,746
and doesn't matter, what's wrong, so what.

87
00:06:05,106 --> 00:06:07,866
It's quite symbolic that in Shri Krishna's place

88
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,426
this thing should be so

89
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:12,986
commonly accepted that everything is an illusion.

90
00:06:13,186 --> 00:06:16,426
So who is wrong, who is bad, nothing is wrong.

91
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,426
There is nothing like evil, nothing like good.

92
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:22,826
And some people go to that limit to say

93
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:25,786
that there's nothing like a bhoot, nothing like a rakshasa,

94
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:28,306
nothing like a evil force.

95
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:32,226
Now for Shri Krishna how did he look at things was this way

96
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:38,306
that for him even to kill a rakshasa was a play.

97
00:06:39,026 --> 00:06:43,586
To destroy a rakshasa was also a play.

98
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:48,346
In that play he was to be destroyed.

99
00:06:48,986 --> 00:06:54,426
So he discriminated in a way that what play is to be destroyed,

100
00:06:54,626 --> 00:06:57,026
what not to be destroyed.

101
00:06:57,226 --> 00:07:00,666
The play of the evil he destroyed by his own play.

102
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:03,506
So to say there was nothing evil is also wrong.

103
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:06,866
Like even if you think everything is a play,

104
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:11,306
what happens that your attitude towards it is like a spectator.

105
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,346
You see the whole thing as a spectator,

106
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:16,106
like in a drama you sit down

107
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:18,426
and you watch everything as a spectator,

108
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:24,586
but you know what is depicting tragedy and what is depicting comedy.

109
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:29,066
You are not inert to that then you are good for nothing.

110
00:07:29,306 --> 00:07:32,466
That doesn't mean that you become inert to that.

111
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,106
You have a sense of discretion to know

112
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:37,866
what is a comedy and what is a tragedy.

113
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:42,666
But if you are an actor, then to you it is not,

114
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:47,666
it is not a comedy or a tragedy, it is a work for you.

115
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:51,066
If you're acting then you're acting and you're an actor,

116
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,386
you're involved in it. So it is not,

117
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:56,426
for you do not know the discretion

118
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:58,226
between the tragedy and the comedy.

119
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:01,506
For you, you're just an actor as long as you're paid well,

120
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:05,226
if you do your job well, then it's a comedy,

121
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:08,306
otherwise it's a tragedy.

122
00:08:08,826 --> 00:08:12,586
So there are two types of awareness, now of one of a spectator,

123
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,426
another of the one who is in it.

124
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,386
So one has to understand in that light,

125
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,546
that when Krishna said the whole thing is a play,

126
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:27,786
he was meaning for him, not for others.

127
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:29,786
For him it is a play.

128
00:08:29,986 --> 00:08:33,786
And that's why when they talk to you about the play and the illusion

129
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:37,146
you must tell them then why did he kill Kamsa.

130
00:08:37,346 --> 00:08:40,146
Why did he kill Jarasandha?

131
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:45,666
Why did he kill all the people who were following Kamsa?

132
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,306
So to him it was a play, everything was a play

133
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:54,226
and he did it in his own attitude of a play.

134
00:08:54,706 --> 00:08:59,546
So the first thing if you are

135
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,026
awakened by Shri Krishna's powers,

136
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:06,546
then the first thing that should happen to you is wisdom.

137
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:11,626
Now the wisdom is something you cannot describe.

138
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:14,186
You cannot say what is wisdom.

139
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:18,306
It's very difficult to describe it or to delimit it.

140
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:21,866
Wisdom is a temperament,

141
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:25,346
is a quality of a personality

142
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:30,706
which comes to you by balancing yourself, by trial and error method.

143
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:34,946
All traditional countries innately have much more wisdom than people

144
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:36,946
who are not traditional.

145
00:09:37,186 --> 00:09:40,066
But Krishna broke all the traditions.

146
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:43,386
That's why you people are here without much tradition.

147
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:47,626
He broke all the traditions, but he was Shri Krishna,

148
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:50,346
so he did not need any tradition at all.

149
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:53,706
But for you, you have to understand from the people

150
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:56,066
who have tradition what is wisdom.

151
00:09:56,306 --> 00:10:00,506
So we do trial and error. We make mistakes, from that we learn.

152
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:06,026
But when the ego is so strong in a country like America,

153
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:10,906
when we do wrong, we do not want to accept it was wrong,¨

154
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:17,786
it was against our ascent, it was against our higher goals.

155
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:19,826
We get satisfied with the lower goals,

156
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:24,466
like I've seen people who do some funny things in Sahaja Yoga.

157
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:28,546
They don't realise that this is absolutely against them,

158
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:31,946
whatever they are doing is against them, they should not do this,

159
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:34,706
it was wrong to do it. On the contrary,

160
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:36,346
they catch on the left Vishuddhi

161
00:10:36,546 --> 00:10:39,786
that is another catch they have on the Vishuddhi chakra.

162
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:44,106
So because you're indiscreet, you do wrong things.

163
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:48,906
To develop discretion, outcome of all this is discretion.

164
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,066
You make mistakes. When you make mistakes,

165
00:10:52,266 --> 00:10:53,186
instead of

166
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,546
developing the discretionabout it that this was a mistake,

167
00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:58,346
next time we should not do it, facing up to it,

168
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:02,226
what we do is to feel guilty about it, so you escape it,

169
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:05,466
spoiling the other chakra also.

170
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:13,386
That is how people get a problem on the left Vishuddhi,

171
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,226
and left Vishuddhi is that you feel guilty.

172
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:20,426
It's very good to feel guilty than to do anything about it.

173
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,186
That's the best way to escape it.

174
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:27,866
Actually we have seen that mostly left Vishuddhi comes from ego.

175
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,786
When ego is too much, you can't bear your ego,

176
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:33,746
so you put it in the guilty side of it,

177
00:11:33,946 --> 00:11:37,666
and you say, "I'm very guilty, I should not have done it."

178
00:11:37,946 --> 00:11:38,986
Now the another side

179
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:42,026
which is also very dangerous is the right Vishuddhi.

180
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:44,306
Right Vishuddhi is the one by which

181
00:11:44,546 --> 00:11:48,866
we try to justify all our indiscreet behaviour.

182
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:52,426
So, "What's wrong?"

183
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:57,826
"What is wrong in this?" "So what!"

184
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:00,786
All these things are right Vishuddhi problems.

185
00:12:01,026 --> 00:12:05,426
So it's very common you tell somebody that it is wrong to do,

186
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:07,786
for example they paint their hair.

187
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:11,426
You tell them, "Don't do this, it will spoil your eyes,"

188
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:16,586
they will say, "So what, we have a right to spoil ourselves,

189
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:19,306
we have a right to destroy ourselves," as if they are Shri Krishna,

190
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:22,506
that they can destroy themselves, can they?

191
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:29,226
They cannot even create a little ant,

192
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:33,146
leave alone ant, they can't even create a stone.

193
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,906
And how do they have right to destroy themselves?

194
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:37,586
So this is the right side thing

195
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:44,106
where we think that we have the right to destroy.

196
00:12:45,746 --> 00:12:49,426
As I told you about eyes yesterday, it's very important

197
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:54,026
that eyes are the ones

198
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:57,066
which gives you the play of Shri Krishna,

199
00:12:57,546 --> 00:12:58,866
the power of Shri Krishna.

200
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:04,386
Even a glance, a little glance of a person

201
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:07,346
who has Krishna consciousness, as they call it,

202
00:13:07,546 --> 00:13:09,226
if he has Krishna consciousness,

203
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:12,186
then should be able to awaken the Kundalini,

204
00:13:12,386 --> 00:13:15,786
should be able to redeem, should be able to comfort,

205
00:13:16,026 --> 00:13:17,466
should be able to cure anyone.

206
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:20,346
Even a glance, a side glance can do it,

207
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:22,386
if it has Krishna consciousness,

208
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:26,466
but not self-certified ones who say, "We are Krishna consciousness,"

209
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:30,986
all the time taking the name of Shri Krishna or any mantra.

210
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:35,506
So on the left hand side the escape is feeling guilty.

211
00:13:35,746 --> 00:13:36,786
When you feel guilty,

212
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:40,026
they try to find out some method of expression.

213
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,026
So they say they go to some guru

214
00:13:42,226 --> 00:13:44,826
and then the guru gives them some sort of a mantra,

215
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:47,506
and they accept that mantra, they go on saying.

216
00:13:47,706 --> 00:13:51,426
As a result of that they catch more on the left Vishuddhi.

217
00:13:51,626 --> 00:13:54,666
Because if you go on saying mantra without the connection,

218
00:13:54,866 --> 00:13:57,186
you get completely caught-up.

219
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,586
So the left Vishuddhi is again gone

220
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:03,266
and your mantras are absolutely useless, they're destroying them.

221
00:14:03,506 --> 00:14:07,026
Actually many people I've seen who get to heart attacks,

222
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:12,426
who get anginas and also who get cancer

223
00:14:12,626 --> 00:14:14,786
are the people who have been doing mantras like this,

224
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:17,666
without the connection with the Divine.

225
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:20,546
If you're not connected, say for example this is not connected

226
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:23,546
and I start using it too much, it will get spoilt.

227
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:27,066
In the same way the centre on the left hand side gets spoilt

228
00:14:27,306 --> 00:14:32,466
when you start saying any mantra without being connected,

229
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:37,146
without feeling the power of that mantra.

230
00:14:37,826 --> 00:14:39,986
So in Sahaja Yoga we've got mantras

231
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:42,946
to neutralise these mantras on the left hand side.

232
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:45,546
Right hand side comes when we talk big.

233
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:49,066
It's a common thing with your politicians, they talk very big.

234
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:50,986
They think they're very responsible people

235
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:53,306
and do all irresponsible things.

236
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,026
So when you want to spoil that chakra,

237
00:14:56,226 --> 00:15:00,226
one has to do some irresponsible talk.

238
00:15:00,426 --> 00:15:04,866
So like that we can say, "I will do this for you, I will do that.

239
00:15:05,106 --> 00:15:10,986
I like it, I can find this, I can manage this," finished.

240
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,786
When you start saying in the ego form that,

241
00:15:15,026 --> 00:15:20,226
"I have to do this, I will do this," then our ego shows up.

242
00:15:20,506 --> 00:15:24,586
But on the contrary, if you say, "I have to do for you, Father;

243
00:15:24,826 --> 00:15:28,666
I have to do for you, Mother, it's your work I'm doing,"

244
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:30,546
then the whole thing disappears

245
00:15:30,786 --> 00:15:34,826
and you get that beautiful thing called surrender which is Islam.

246
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,506
Islam is nothing but surrender.

247
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:41,546
So you surrender yourself by saying, "This is your work, Father;

248
00:15:41,786 --> 00:15:46,506
I'm working for you, I'm your instrument, I'm your flute."

249
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,546
So you play the melody of God.

250
00:15:49,746 --> 00:15:54,026
But for that also the central point of discretion has to be used.

251
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:56,586
Every time you go back to discretion.

252
00:15:56,786 --> 00:15:59,226
Like some people do all kinds of wrong things

253
00:15:59,466 --> 00:16:02,506
and they say, "Mother, we did it for you." How can it be?

254
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:04,346
Like somebody wants to drink.

255
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:09,866
He says, "I got drunk because Mother I wanted to help you."

256
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:13,826
Or Hitler can say that, "I killed so many people

257
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:18,906
because I wanted to remove all the Jews who killed Christ."

258
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:24,346
So this right Vishuddhi gives you a kind of a mind

259
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:30,386
which tries to justify everything and tries to explain everything.

260
00:16:30,586 --> 00:16:33,626
Every action can be explained. "Why did you murder?" "Because this."

261
00:16:33,866 --> 00:16:35,586
"Why did you do that?" "Because of this."

262
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:38,706
Once you start justifying your wrong deeds,

263
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:41,826
right Vishuddhi goes up to your brain.

264
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:44,746
And then whatever you do has a justification.

265
00:16:44,986 --> 00:16:50,226
Like, if I say that the Americans came to this country,

266
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,346
they actually robbed the other people of their land

267
00:16:52,546 --> 00:16:54,906
and now very nicely settled down.

268
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:56,386
Now, when I say that,

269
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:59,106
immediately most of them will go to the left Vishuddhi.

270
00:16:59,346 --> 00:17:03,346
"Oh, we are very guilty, we did this, we did that."

271
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:05,866
But a real Sahaja Yogi won't do that.

272
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:08,506
A real Sahaja Yogi, what he will do, he'll say, "Alright,

273
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:11,506
this is done by my fore-fathers, I did not do it.

274
00:17:11,746 --> 00:17:17,026
But I can try to rectify it, I'll try to be beyond racialism;

275
00:17:17,226 --> 00:17:19,786
I'll look after these people who have been robbed,

276
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:22,506
I'll try to give them whatever is possible."

277
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:25,906
This is the way you face and not just to say,

278
00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:30,386
"Oh, I'm so guilty that my fore-fathers did this and all that."

279
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:32,866
But what are you doing about it?

280
00:17:33,106 --> 00:17:36,666
Like I went to Switzerland and I said, "Don't feel guilty."

281
00:17:36,866 --> 00:17:40,386
So one lady said that "I'm feeling guilty for Vietnam."

282
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,706
I said, "What did you do there?

283
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:45,346
Why are you feeling guilty for Vietnam, of all the things,

284
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:47,986
at least you did not go to fight there.

285
00:17:48,186 --> 00:17:49,826
Why did you feel guilty about it."

286
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,186
So she says, "I'm feeling just guilty

287
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:57,346
because I think we have done a wrong thing."

288
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,986
I said, "But how do call yourself 'we'?"

289
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:04,586
So this is also another point which comes out of indiscretion

290
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:09,706
that we suddenly become a personality

291
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:13,066
which is a part and parcel of the whole.

292
00:18:13,346 --> 00:18:18,106
So we think that "Oh, we Americans are of the world."

293
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,346
Alright, how?

294
00:18:21,706 --> 00:18:26,546
The day you become the world most of the problems will be solved.

295
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:30,466
They're the greatest headaches, like Russians are.

296
00:18:30,706 --> 00:18:33,226
Both are headaches to the whole world.

297
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:36,626
If they become the whole world, there's no problem,

298
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:40,786
there's no problem, because then they become the love.

299
00:18:41,106 --> 00:18:47,546
But just assuming a situation where we think, we are, we.

300
00:18:47,986 --> 00:18:52,746
Who are the 'we'?  Husband and wife can't live together.

301
00:18:53,026 --> 00:18:55,426
Children and father cannot live together.

302
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,386
Mother cannot live with the children.

303
00:18:57,586 --> 00:19:00,666
What are 'we'? Where are 'we'?

304
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,946
Such fragmentations. They'll fight over small things

305
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:10,066
like a pen-knife or something, which pen-knife to be bought.

306
00:19:10,346 --> 00:19:12,346
For that they will fight. How are they 'we'?

307
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,826
There's no unison, there is no concord.

308
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:18,746
Just the opposite of all that is the Vishuddhi chakra.

309
00:19:18,946 --> 00:19:23,346
So from the very beginning, if you see that a person

310
00:19:23,546 --> 00:19:28,986
who is a realised soul should see everything as a play.

311
00:19:29,226 --> 00:19:32,426
Even the destruction of evil is important,

312
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:35,826
even the killing of the evil is important.

313
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:39,506
If you do not kill the evil, the evil will rule.

314
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:41,106
Do you think Hitler should have been saved

315
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:45,426
and should have been put in charge of God?

316
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:48,866
He's saved by killing him.

317
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,866
Because he was destroyed,

318
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:55,986
because everything was destroyed, he's saved.

319
00:19:56,466 --> 00:19:59,746
This is to be understood in his life, Krishna's life,

320
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:03,226
that this is first thing happens, so that for you people,

321
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:05,746
evil is to be finished.

322
00:20:06,026 --> 00:20:07,106
So what you have to pray

323
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:10,106
that, "O Lord, finish all the evil of the world,

324
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:14,826
all the destruction of the world,

325
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:18,586
all the minds which build up our destruction,

326
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:21,426
please try to neutralise it."

327
00:20:21,626 --> 00:20:23,946
This is what a Sahaja Yogi should ask for.

328
00:20:24,146 --> 00:20:24,946
Instead of that,

329
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:30,106
they try to sometimes identify themselves with these ideas.

330
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,466
That's not correct . You have to stand up

331
00:20:32,706 --> 00:20:34,626
and you have to say that it's wrong,

332
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:38,226
"We are not to destroy anyone, we are not to kill anybody,

333
00:20:38,466 --> 00:20:39,746
we have no right."

334
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:44,506
So when Krishna told Arjuna that "You kill everyone

335
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:47,266
who are related to you, who are your friends

336
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:52,546
and who look like your gurus, but they're already dead."

337
00:20:52,746 --> 00:20:54,906
It was Shri Krishna who said,

338
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:59,426
it was the incarnation of Shri Krishna said it.

339
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,946
That doesn't that you start killing everybody,

340
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:07,226
becoming Arjuna, you're not Arjuna.

341
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:12,306
That is how Anand Marg, this thing organisation came up,

342
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:14,546
which started killing everyone,

343
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:18,786
thinking that they have a right to kill. How?

344
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:20,746
You have no sense of right and wrong.

345
00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:24,426
How can you kill anyone or how can you save any.

346
00:21:24,626 --> 00:21:26,906
First of all try to save instead of killing.

347
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:31,626
Supposing you are faced with a boat which is in danger,

348
00:21:31,826 --> 00:21:33,146
people are getting drowned

349
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,506
and you find that you have to save the people.

350
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:39,586
Will you kill the people there or you try to salvage them?

351
00:21:39,786 --> 00:21:41,706
There is no occasion for killing now.

352
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:44,946
You don't have to worry about killing, let God do that job.

353
00:21:45,146 --> 00:21:47,626
What you have to do is to save people,

354
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:51,906
you have to save as many as possible all the time.

355
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:56,706
And those who are wrong type of people, you just forget about them.

356
00:21:56,946 --> 00:22:00,146
You just move them out. Take them away.

357
00:22:00,426 --> 00:22:01,546
Have nothing to do with them.

358
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:04,906
Do what you like, but do not kill them.

359
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:08,786
So that is one thing one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis,

360
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:12,626
that you are not here to kill anyone, to destroy anyone,

361
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:16,546
to trouble anyone or to do something that is not proper.

362
00:22:16,786 --> 00:22:20,106
Even there is no need to say harsh words.

363
00:22:20,466 --> 00:22:23,466
God is going to look after. He's so anxious today,

364
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:27,906
you are on the stage and He's so anxious to help you in every way

365
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:30,466
because you're doing His work. But doing His work

366
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:31,386
you don't take up

367
00:22:31,586 --> 00:22:35,266
His sword into your hands and start killing everyone.

368
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:38,426
That's a very common thing we do it, in Sahaja Yoga,

369
00:22:38,626 --> 00:22:40,746
I've seen people become very aggressive,

370
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:42,586
they talk very aggressively.

371
00:22:42,786 --> 00:22:45,906
Specially the new-comers who come in, in a programme.

372
00:22:46,146 --> 00:22:49,986
Instead of being kind, nice, compassionate, good to them,

373
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:52,706
immediately they'll say, "You're a bhoot!"

374
00:22:52,946 --> 00:22:55,746
Very common.

375
00:22:56,946 --> 00:23:01,386
You won't find me doing that anytime, do I?

376
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:04,226
Then you start aggressing each other also,

377
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:07,266
which is against the principle of Vishuddhi.

378
00:23:07,466 --> 00:23:08,386
You're not to aggress.

379
00:23:08,586 --> 00:23:11,346
You see, because whole thing becomes discretion.

380
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:14,666
What is discretion is diplomacy.

381
00:23:14,946 --> 00:23:18,066
The divine diplomacy is expressed through your discretion.

382
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:20,346
If you have a sense of discretion, now you know -

383
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:22,266
this man is dangerous,

384
00:23:22,506 --> 00:23:23,866
he is troubling you,

385
00:23:24,066 --> 00:23:25,746
now if you have a proper sense,

386
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,386
you will remove that person in such a way from amidst yourself

387
00:23:29,626 --> 00:23:34,426
that there won't be any more discussion, or destruction.

388
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:39,266
But on the contrary, what you do is to challenge that person,

389
00:23:39,506 --> 00:23:42,226
and a big fight starts. And Sahaja Yogis can fight,

390
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:46,786
I tell you sometimes I don't know what to say about their fights.

391
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:49,146
So must have discretion, must understand.

392
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:52,346
A situation develops, for example, a situation develops

393
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:54,426
where you find somebody is telling you,

394
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:57,346
"You see, this person has said this about you."

395
00:23:57,586 --> 00:24:00,066
Then the same person goes and tells another person,

396
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,786
"That person has said this about you."

397
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:04,706
Then you start quarelling.

398
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:09,066
Instead of finding out the basic reason, instead of finding out,

399
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:12,186
"Why, why this is happening,

400
00:24:12,426 --> 00:24:14,866
why such a situation has come between ourselves.

401
00:24:15,106 --> 00:24:16,666
We were friends, what has happened?"

402
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:19,786
Instead of that, one starts fighting, getting angry.

403
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:26,346
That's not the sign of any realised soul expression.

404
00:24:26,586 --> 00:24:31,346
Realised souls expressions have to be extremely discreet,

405
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,626
delicate, beautiful.

406
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:37,506
Nobody should notice

407
00:24:37,706 --> 00:24:43,786
that you have been in any way effective,

408
00:24:45,386 --> 00:24:47,706
and that's how you'll work it out.

409
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:50,746
So the incarnation of Shri Krishna as we say

410
00:24:50,946 --> 00:24:54,506
is the incarnation of the divine diplomacy.

411
00:24:54,906 --> 00:24:57,386
So he plays.

412
00:24:57,586 --> 00:24:59,626
Give you an example how he plays.

413
00:24:59,826 --> 00:25:05,186
There was a rakshasa, a devil,

414
00:25:05,586 --> 00:25:10,666
who had a blessing from Shiva

415
00:25:10,906 --> 00:25:16,986
that nobody can kill him.

416
00:25:17,986 --> 00:25:23,786
And only a saint who has never opened his eyes all his life,

417
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:27,546
if he puts his eyes on him, he will be killed.

418
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:32,466
So there was a saint who had a blessing

419
00:25:32,786 --> 00:25:36,386
that you go into your yoga, yoga nidra,

420
00:25:36,586 --> 00:25:40,506
sleep in your yoga sleep,

421
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,586
and once you open your eyes

422
00:25:43,786 --> 00:25:49,266
on whomsoever it will fall, such a person will die.

423
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:54,746
Alright, so Shri Krishna was very clever.

424
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:57,906
He was fighting this devil

425
00:25:58,106 --> 00:26:01,786
and this devil was about to kill Shri Krishna.

426
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:05,826
And Shri Krishna knew all about this, his background.

427
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:08,986
So he started running away from the field,

428
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:11,226
so he's got a name called Ranchodas,

429
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:13,986
the one who runs away from the battle field,

430
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:16,826
is regarded as something really derogatory,

431
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:20,666
because it's not something great to run away from the battle field.

432
00:26:20,906 --> 00:26:21,786
So he didn't mind,

433
00:26:21,986 --> 00:26:25,626
he ran away and then this devil started following him

434
00:26:25,826 --> 00:26:26,946
And he went into the cave

435
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:31,306
where this great saint was sleeping in his yoga nidra.

436
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:34,906
And he removed his shawl

437
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:39,226
and put it slowly, delicately, on that saint

438
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:41,186
and hid himself.

439
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:43,466
So this rakshasa came behind him.

440
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:47,346
He saw him lying down there. He thought this was Shri Krishna.

441
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:51,226
He said, "Ah so now you're tired, you're lying down here.

442
00:26:51,466 --> 00:26:53,506
Come along now, open your eyes!"

443
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:59,706
And as soon as he pulled the shawl with little strength,

444
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:02,746
this fellow got up and his eyes looked at him

445
00:27:02,946 --> 00:27:05,986
and he just was burnt.

446
00:27:08,986 --> 00:27:12,786
And he did not mind getting the bad name of Ranchodas.

447
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:16,386
That is the sign of diplomacy.

448
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:21,786
So the whole discretion of his is plain throughout his life,

449
00:27:21,986 --> 00:27:24,586
the whole discretion, what he should do,

450
00:27:24,786 --> 00:27:26,506
what is right, what is wrong,

451
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:30,306
is he doesn't have this problem.

452
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:35,426
Then he had to have his powers, all of them brought on this earth.

453
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,146
So he played a trick .

454
00:27:37,346 --> 00:27:43,106
He got all those powers in the form of women, young women.

455
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:49,346
And he made one king - you see-

456
00:27:50,306 --> 00:27:57,586
drag these women into his own court for him to use them.

457
00:27:57,786 --> 00:28:00,306
But he could never touch them.

458
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:03,346
So Shri Krishna went and defeated this man.

459
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:05,466
He has to have justification also,

460
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:08,266
he has to have a religious justification for doing something.

461
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,146
So he killed this king, brought all these women

462
00:28:11,386 --> 00:28:17,226
and they all became his wives, so-called.

463
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:20,906
All kinds of tricks he used to play.

464
00:28:21,106 --> 00:28:23,626
I'll tell you the Radha's trick that he played.

465
00:28:23,826 --> 00:28:27,066
Today I'm wearing a dress like Radha because she's Viratangana,

466
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:30,266
she's the one who protects our Sushumna Nadi.

467
00:28:30,546 --> 00:28:34,546
She's the Mahalakshmi and she wears the sari like this to protect.

468
00:28:34,786 --> 00:28:38,226
She wears this way, while she leaves her left hand open

469
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:42,586
because this is the Shakti of Mahakali and the right hand she closes

470
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:46,906
because the right hand is the Shakti of Mahasaraswati,

471
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:50,226
meaning the power of creation,

472
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:52,546
because creation has been done already.

473
00:28:52,786 --> 00:28:55,746
She's created the earth and she's created human beings,

474
00:28:55,946 --> 00:28:57,786
everything is done . Now that is stopped.

475
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,946
And in India, Brahmadeva is not worshipped

476
00:29:00,146 --> 00:29:03,386
except there's one temple where they worship Brahmadeva,

477
00:29:03,586 --> 00:29:06,586
otherwise Brahmadeva has no temple or anything.

478
00:29:06,826 --> 00:29:09,946
So she closes this side, she preserves it within herself

479
00:29:10,186 --> 00:29:11,906
and she opens her left side.

480
00:29:12,146 --> 00:29:13,986
And in front of her

481
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:18,226
is the complete protection made for all her disciples.

482
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,106
This is the whole big 'archal' she makes,

483
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:23,586
normally the 'archal' is other side of it,

484
00:29:23,786 --> 00:29:28,026
where the child is kept inside, hidden in other sari.

485
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:31,146
But in this one, the one that they have here

486
00:29:31,386 --> 00:29:33,306
is the child is kept underneath this,

487
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:36,826
so the whole ascent takes place of Mahalakshmi.

488
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:41,026
And that's why this is the Radha's powers is shown.

489
00:29:41,226 --> 00:29:44,026
So I'll tell you the last story about her

490
00:29:44,226 --> 00:29:50,666
which will conclude this talk about

491
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:52,626
Radha and Shri Krishna.

492
00:29:52,866 --> 00:29:55,306
That one day,

493
00:29:56,106 --> 00:30:01,746
one of the wives of Shri Krishna was befooled by Narada,

494
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:03,706
and Narada said, "See,

495
00:30:03,946 --> 00:30:06,426
Krishna doesn't love you, he only loves Radha.

496
00:30:06,626 --> 00:30:08,906
He's just telling you stories that he loves you,

497
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:13,746
that you are his wives but he is not. He is only attached to Radha."

498
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:18,666
So the rumour, you see, went into the women.

499
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:22,626
All of them started feeling that, "O really, it is so."

500
00:30:22,826 --> 00:30:25,866
So they went and told Shri Krishna that

501
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:28,986
"You don't love us, you just love Radha."

502
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:30,866
He said, "Who told you?" They said, "Narada."

503
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:34,146
"No, no, who told you this." They said, "Narada."

504
00:30:34,346 --> 00:30:35,746
He said, "Narada is just telling you lies, you see,

505
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:39,666
he is just trying to make some quarrel between you and me,

506
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,626
so don't listen to him."

507
00:30:41,826 --> 00:30:43,946
They said, "No, no, it's true, we can prove it."

508
00:30:44,186 --> 00:30:45,746
He said, "Alright. I don't know that,

509
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:47,906
but just now I got terrible pain in the stomach,

510
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:51,466
terrible pain, I can't get over it." So they got all worried.

511
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:55,226
They said, "What's the matter, what sort of a pain it is,

512
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:58,426
what can we do to overcome this pain."

513
00:30:58,626 --> 00:31:00,386
He said, "There's very simple thing that

514
00:31:00,586 --> 00:31:05,306
you'll have to give me the dust of your feet to drink.

515
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:09,066
If you can take out the dust of your feet and give me to drink,

516
00:31:09,306 --> 00:31:10,866
then I'll be saved."

517
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:14,506
So these ladies used their brains. They said that

518
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,226
"Already he doesn't love us

519
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:18,466
and then if we give him the dust of our feet

520
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:22,426
we'll be committing sins and then it is going to be much worse.

521
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:25,506
So what's the use of playing into his hands, he's very diplomatic,

522
00:31:25,706 --> 00:31:27,146
it's better to forget about it."

523
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:29,666
They said, "No, no, no we don't want to do such a sinful thing,

524
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:33,266
is to give you the dust of our feet, it's non-protocolish,

525
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:36,466
we have nothing to do like that, you don't teach us all bad things."

526
00:31:36,666 --> 00:31:39,706
So they stopped it. So Narada came, he said, "Now what to do,

527
00:31:39,906 --> 00:31:42,186
how to get rid of your pain in the stomach."

528
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:44,706
He said, "There's only way out, you go to Radha

529
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:47,266
and tell her that I've got a pain in the stomach

530
00:31:47,466 --> 00:31:50,106
and this is the medicine." So he went to Radhaji

531
00:31:50,306 --> 00:31:53,346
and he said to her that,

532
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:56,626
"You see, Shri Krishna is very sick, he's got pain in the stomach

533
00:31:56,826 --> 00:32:01,826
and what you have to do is to give the dust of your feet."

534
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:04,866
She said, "Yes, why not, take it,

535
00:32:05,186 --> 00:32:07,906
for that pain, of course, why not?"

536
00:32:08,706 --> 00:32:14,346
So he said, "Aren't you worried about your punyas,

537
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:16,546
aren't you worried that you're committing sin."

538
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:18,866
She said, "You don't know this Shri Krishna,

539
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,866
he has no sense of sin at all.

540
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,146
He makes me do sin morning till evening,

541
00:32:23,386 --> 00:32:24,706
what am I to worry about sins.

542
00:32:24,906 --> 00:32:28,066
I'm not going to worry about that, you better take this for him,

543
00:32:28,266 --> 00:32:29,386
this is his worry."

544
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:32,186
So he took the dust of Radha's feet

545
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:34,706
and took it down to Shri Krishna.

546
00:32:34,946 --> 00:32:37,746
Shri Krishna: "Did she give you." He said, "Did she give you?"

547
00:32:37,946 --> 00:32:40,106
He said, "Yes, she has, I'm surprised,

548
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:43,626
but she's not worried about her sins, she's not worried."

549
00:32:43,866 --> 00:32:46,706
He said, "That I know." So he said, "But how do you explain it?"

550
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:48,626
He said, "You'll understand just now."

551
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:51,186
He took the dust of Radha's feet,

552
00:32:51,426 --> 00:32:56,426
you see Radha's feet were dusted

553
00:32:56,626 --> 00:32:58,626
or were full of dust of Vrindavan,

554
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:05,066
and Vrindavan has got yellow kind of clay,

555
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:07,746
you see, the soil is yellowish

556
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:12,106
and the whole yellow thing was on her feet

557
00:33:12,306 --> 00:33:14,586
which she removed and took it.

558
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:19,826
So when Shri Krishna drank that dust,

559
00:33:20,306 --> 00:33:23,866
Narada saw in the heart of Shri Krishna,

560
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:28,826
Radha was lying down and playing with her feet

561
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:31,106
on the lotus of his heart.

562
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:37,306
The lotus had the pollen,

563
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,826
the pollen of the lotus was touching her feet

564
00:33:40,026 --> 00:33:41,706
and was making it yellow.

565
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:45,426
That's what she said that "What is it when I'm in his heart,

566
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:51,626
my feet are in his heart, so what is the sin I can commit?"

567
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:58,266
And when the ladies heard this, they realised that

568
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:01,466
their idea about Shri Krishna is still not sufficient.

569
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:05,026
They have to be Radha to understand him.

570
00:34:05,266 --> 00:34:07,506
And this is how he plays diplomacy,

571
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:10,466
simple tricks here and there by which he did it.

572
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:16,346
And to introduce the beauty of Leela, he started Ras;

573
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:19,746
Ra is energy, Sa means 'with'.

574
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:23,146
So he made Radha dance, stand there with him,

575
00:34:23,386 --> 00:34:25,946
give him the the power and everybody danced.

576
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:29,746
And they looked like as if Radha and Krishna dancing.

577
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,466
And this is what he started, and then to make it, culminate it,

578
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:37,706
he made a festival of Holi in which he said, "Abandon everything!

579
00:34:37,946 --> 00:34:39,786
For a minute you abandon everything."

580
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:42,866
And that abandonment has now become a,

581
00:34:43,106 --> 00:34:44,986
that's for only one day you have to abandon,

582
00:34:45,186 --> 00:34:48,986
here it has become a year-long Holi.

583
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:51,066
So people are busy with a year-long Holi

584
00:34:51,266 --> 00:34:52,946
without Shri Krishna and Radha.

585
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:56,426
So what will be the situation of such a place?

586
00:34:56,626 --> 00:34:59,226
And that's why I think, what happens that

587
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:03,306
when you try to attract others by all these stupid things,

588
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:06,546
only the bhoots are attracted and they get into you.

589
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:09,786
And once they get into you, you get funny,

590
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:11,506
you don't know why you behave like this,

591
00:35:11,706 --> 00:35:14,066
why things work out that way.

592
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,226
This is why we have to understand

593
00:35:16,426 --> 00:35:19,066
that we have to be attractive to God.

594
00:35:19,306 --> 00:35:23,626
And you'll be only attractive to God if you have got your spirit.

595
00:35:23,906 --> 00:35:27,626
If the spirit is shining, then only you can get into it.

596
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:30,786
So May God Bless You.
