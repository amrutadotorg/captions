00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.440
Again it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you again

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.640
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.640
For those of you who have been coming regularly

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.840
to the series these last two nights and tonight,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.320
I think many of you will have experienced Self-realization.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.400
For those of you who haven’t, don’t despair,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.480
because it can be worked out in everyone.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.520
Not everyone

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.000
keeps that gift of Self-realization,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.120
because, very foolishly, when we touch it,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.720
we let it go, we squander it, or perhaps we don’t develop it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.000
in a way in which that seeking that lies within us would desire.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080
But whatever it is,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.360
most of us who get this experience of Self-realization

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.520
come to a point where logically they reach the conclusion

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.760
that there must be something that has happened within me,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.760
which has taken me into this new dimension of awareness.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.960
In my own case, when I experienced Self-realization …

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:21.160
it was a very remarkable experience because I gained my experience

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.520
from Mataji, in Her presence, in India.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.560
But the events that led up to that were quite interesting.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.120
Because, as practicing

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.440
professional in health care, looking after lots of patients,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.840
I was able to watch a lot of those patients

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.200
who were going to India, going to America,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.440
going to various places of Spiritual pilgrimage all over the world.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.160
And many of them were coming back —

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.760
quite curiously to me at that time —

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.039
quite damaged and quite in a state

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.000
of mental and physical disarray.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.640
I had done a lot of reading about seeking,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.640
I had read a lot about Eastern religion,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.720
I had read, of course, the Christian scriptures,

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:15.760
I’d also read extensively the Koran.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.800
But I was watching what was happening to my patients,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.160
to these people who were coming back with physical problems

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.120
and especially psychological problems,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.280
and psychosexual problems,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.239
which were far worse than when they went away.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440
But having done the reading,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.160
having read about these so-called masters

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.560
that are granting Self-realization — so-called —

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.679
or the experience, or the promise, or some such thing,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.600
I was curious to find out

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.840
why it was that these people seemed to be a lot worse off.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.440
Worse off, not better.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.119
And this was from a purely rational point of view:

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.760
at that stage I hadn’t gained my Self-realization.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.680
So

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.960
I was given to believe that many of them

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.000
who had these experiences were actually purifying themselves.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.799
That was one explanation.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.480
Other explanations were that it was a process of growth

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.280
in which you have to re-experience so many of, for example,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.480
your childhood experiences, or repressions, or whatever it was.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.200
And this seemed to be, I suppose,

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.800
to a rational mind that wanted explanations for things,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.800
reasonably sensible.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.920
But I still couldn’t come to terms with why these people

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.400
were really — if I could use the word — quite freakish

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.280
when they came back from these so-called pilgrimages.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.200
So I went myself.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.480
I went to the ashrams of these so-called sat gurus,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.120
I went to the places where hundreds of my own fellow countrymen

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.880
and dozens of my own patients actually reside,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.480
where they live, where they have regarded it as their Spiritual home.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.200
And they live a most remarkable life.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.600
They live a life which is, to my way of thinking —

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.120
from a purely Western,

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.800
but perhaps a more universal point of view —

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.720
a very sick life.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.760
I watched the depraved things that go on in the ashrams.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.120
I watched the mental sickness which was manifesting everywhere.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.680
I watched them using sexual and other,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.080
rather bizarre techniques for the so-called awakening of Kundalini.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.039
Because I knew that Kundalini had to be awakened. That much I knew.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.719
I was also very worried about this whole notion of Kundalini

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.360
because all the books that I’d read were … somewhat …

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.600
scaring because they had suggested

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.320
that Kundalini is a dangerous energy that you mustn’t play with,

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.120
and that when it’s awakened it can lead to all sorts

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.080
of mental and physical disorders, and so on and so forth.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.840
So I had all these sorts of conditionings.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.200
But what I saw in fact in these places

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.239
was nothing but a nonsense.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.040
Watching them dancing to this subliminal music,

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.240
which, in fact, damages the brain cells;

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.040
using strobe lights, which damage the cells of the back of the eye;

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.080
using tantric techniques of so-called sexual kind

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.880
that are “awakening” the Kundalini;

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.400
people going into contortions;

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.040
but worse than anything, people getting mesmerized.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.040
This was the most frightening part.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.520
Watching an hour-long “technique” — and that was what it was —

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.360
whereby the “guru” mesmerized his audience,

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.160
it reminded me, in fact, of much of what I’d read of Hitler,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.760
and it really disturbed me.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.000
I went from one to the other.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.400
I don’t mind naming them: I went to Rajneesh,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.760
I went to Muktananda, I went to all of these different places.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.640
I went to Sai Baba’s ashram.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.239
I, thank God, was never initiated by them,

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.480
nor did I see any sign of them.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.680
They were in America,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.240
living their luxurious life.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.480
But the disciples were there. And they were in a horrible state.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.320
Many of my patients were there, and they were very very damaged.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.919
So from one to the other I went, forming increasingly

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.360
a view which ranged from disillusionment to total disgust.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.040
If this was Spiritual seeking,

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.600
then I just wanted to forget it.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.280
So I virtually abandoned the idea

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.920
of finding out in India

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.280
because it seemed to me to be a just one big joke,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.720
a very sick joke.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.000
People like Rajneesh were practicing

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.680
nothing but sexual pranks and pseudo-psychology

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.560
as the means of awakening this energy,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.760
which of course it doesn’t do.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.840
In fact, what happens is the very deities

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.080
that William Doble has just spoken of

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.599
recede from those centers in a very very angry way,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.560
and you feel fire and burning and all sorts of negative experiences

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.000
at the hands of these “gurus”.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.120
I came to the conclusion very clearly that I wandered away

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.599
from this situation.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.080
In fact, I very quickly came to the conclusion

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.239
that these must be, in fact, the antichrists.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.760
Because the very thing that I had been seeking,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.400
that very beautiful experience of Self-realization,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.920
was at best no more than a promise,

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.720
and at worst was, in fact, absolute damage

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.760
to either the psyche or the physical body.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.640
And so,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.760
I was about to come home, I had my flight booked back,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:24.159
and I also had the telephone number of Shri Mataji.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.360
I telephoned to Her.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.880
Something in me said, “Give one more a chance,”

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.880
and this precisely what I did.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.880
I went to Her.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.360
In fact, I gave Her a telephone call, and at the other end

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:42.479
was a very warm, loving voice,

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:46.359
who simply invited me to come over and to meet Her.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.040
And this I did, in Bombay.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.319
And after a very beautiful hour or so

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.520
in which there were grandchildren scrambling all over Her,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.400
in which there were all sorts of very very normal things

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.320
happening around Her,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.439
She invited me to come to the Sahaja Yoga center in Bombay

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.520
and to experience the realization that I’d been seeking.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.200
By that time I was feeling very relaxed, I was feeling calm,

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.800
and I certainly wanted to experience what She had to offer.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.440
I hope you bear with me in telling this story because it’s a story

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.760
which lies behind the pain and the agony

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.600
which so many people have suffered in their seeking,

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.199
in their disillusionment with their seeking,

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.959
and it reflects just one such person who —

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:44.360
but for the grace of God, but for the grace of the Mother —

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.239
would perhaps have been lost in this round of human existence.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.000
We’re at a crisis point.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.000
All the great incarnations have spoken

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.480
of the great time of confusion,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:04.640
of the time when there would be these antichrists on the earth.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.840
They are here — to seduce the seekers.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.800
These are very strong words,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.760
but they are here to seduce the seekers.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.640
They’re here to mesmerize, they’re here to confuse.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.840
And we have every evidence of it.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.680
From Pune,

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.360
there has been one gentleman — if we can call him that —

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.160
who has had to run away.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.000
The BBC did a documentary on the subject

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.280
called “The god who ran away”.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.400
And they call him Bhagwan.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.480
And he’s now settled down in Oregon, in America.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.719
And the American government don’t want him either:

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.599
they’ve given him a deportation order.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.160
He might come here. You people should take a responsible stand.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.520
There is another one who claims to be the incarnation

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.360
of the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.640
He was a little fat boy who, at the age of sixteen,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.880
started a mission.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.120
First he married his secretary who was nineteen,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.200
then he had a squabble with his mother and his brother,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.720
and they wrangled for the position of power.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:15.479
And finally he settled down in Denver City and in Florida,

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:20.280
and he has literally thousands and thousands and thousands of people

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.960
who are awaiting so-called knowledge, whatever that might be.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.640
There are so many.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.640
There is one “guru” who lives in Bangalore,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.440
who plucks diamonds out of the air

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.040
and offers them to American tourists.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.080
He calls himself the incarnation of Kalki.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.199
He’s a man known to have certain sexual deviations,

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.920
which have been written up extensively

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.760
by many people who’ve been there.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.720
There’s a man who died recently called Muktananda,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.520
who died of a massive heart attack.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.280
What great saint would die of a massive heart attack?

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.400
What great saint would need a bypass valving his heart

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600
for the last fifteen years?

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.520
What man who called himself a saint would have a dirty disease?

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.640
I ask us all

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.800
to be very rational about this, to use our brains

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.160
and to openly oppose these false gurus.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.040
Take a stand on the subject because they are the ones

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.480
who are going to damage these young people

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.599
who are coming up in the world today.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.640
Many of us — I’m forty-seven years of age —

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.480
many of us at this age,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.120
all right, we’ve made our mistakes.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.120
With the grace of Mother, those mistakes are going to be repaired.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.440
The effects are going to be neutralized,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.160
the damage is going to be fixed up.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.920
Not so much from these false gurus,

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.320
not so much from them,

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.880
because we missed out, thank God,

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.120
but many of the young people today

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.600
are part and parcel of this whole

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:16.520
mesmeric nightmare that’s going on against our evolution.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.800
And we owe it to the young people, who are in their twenties,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.880
in their teens, and the young children,

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.520
who could be very seriously damaged.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:33.120
Mataji, as you know, speaks openly against these fake gurus.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:38.200
She has done, since Her message began in 1970,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.400
She has named them,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.960
She has said who they were in their previous births.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.280
She has warned the sort of diseases that they cause in the seekers,

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.800
many of which She has had to cure.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So, in contrast to that beautiful

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.400
optimistic potential,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.400
which we all have,

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.320
and which Mother has granted to most of us,

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.000
so many of the people who miss out

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.520
and do not get their realization,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.760
contrary to our possibilities,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.440
so many people are going to be lost.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.920
And I urge each and every one of you people

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.240
who get your realization, who develop their realization,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.640
to take a stand, to speak out against these people.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.520
When you hear them come to your city to lecture,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.960
when you hear people conversing about them,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.040
when you hear people defending them, take a stand.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.280
How many people sitting in this audience may have been

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.320
someone in the crowd at the time of the Lord Jesus Christ

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.439
and did not have the courage that even Peter may have had?

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.199
How many of us can sit comfortably in the chair and say

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.240
that “I will take a stand

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.920
when it comes to this nonsense that’s going on in the society,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.440
when it’s anti-God in its nature and its effect”?

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.280
As I said, I’m a professional person.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.680
All Sahaja Yogis are professional people

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.880
or, in some sense, working people, in a very very normal way.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.000
And we don’t believe in stupid attitudes and practices

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.640
such as sannyas,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.000
wearing clothes that are specially designed for the guru,

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.200
giving him Rolls-Royces,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.400
a hundred other,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.320
rather ridiculous tactics that are employed.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.360
We reject this nonsense.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.359
And in its place we have Mother.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.719
Mother, who is the one who Christ spoke about

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:58.040
as the one who would come as the Counsellor, the Comforter,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:01.720
the Holy Spirit who would teach us all things.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.439
She’s the one who can do the job, in a very very simple way,

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.000
as I said last night.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.080
You feel this manifestation of the cool wind of the Holy Spirit

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.640
you feel it on your central nervous system, consciously.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:19.840
You begin to have the manifestation which all the great teachers

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.920
who came on this earth said we had to look for.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:30.320
Mohammed said it is the Ruh that has to be looked for.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.640
And Bill has spoken of all the others.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.600
“At this resurrection time our hands have to speak” —

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.400
all of these things.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.400
We have so many Muslims, Hindus, Christian, Buddhist —

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.120
people who belong to Sahaja Yoga and who now have finally

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.200
been liberated from that limitation of any one sect,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.199
or denomination, or group.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.520
This is the long-awaited experience,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.600
which you’ve all been waiting for.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.520
As I said, so many of you

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.680
have probably been a Christian, a Jew, a Hindu;

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:18.080
you’ve probably stood in the crowd — silently, knowing the truth —

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.960
in those incarnations where you’ve been seeking.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.520
Now you’ve come to this point in your evolution

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:27.960
where all you have to do is, by the grace of God,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.400
by the grace of God, get it.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.240
In the form of the Mother,

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:39.560
that grace has come.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.600
That grace flows on your hands,

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.000
it flows from the top of your head.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.800
It neutralizes negativity,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.800
it dissolves

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.600
all those things in us which are against our evolution,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.520
and it gives us the bliss, that is the Spirit.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.880
Ladies and gentlemen, again I introduce to you

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.240
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.200
To all the seekers of truth I bow.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.600
Dr. Reeves has spoken rather strongly today.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.480
I think he is a very great Australian

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.520
to have that kind of a wisdom

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.720
to see through the nonsense and the mockery

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.360
that people were inflicting

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.360
on simple naive seekers from abroad.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:10.960
It requires a great intelligence

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.720
and common sense to see through that.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.520
But the greatest of all is the desire

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.240
to do good to others,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.040
to be touched by the agonies of others,

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.080
to be upset what others are suffering.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.120
This is the biggest thing,

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:39.320
that really brings you to the right point of understanding.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.080
What he said is absolute truth.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.960
I’ve been to all these gurus to find out what they have been up to.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.680
And they have been telling everyone that “She was my disciple.”

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.240
Another said, “She was my disciple.”

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.320
I just wanted to find out

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:01.400
what are they doing to these people,

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.760
how are they grabbing them,

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.080
and what are they managing.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.520
I knew the divine path, I knew the holy path, the pure path,

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.240
but I didn’t know the path of the crooks,

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.600
of the antichrist,

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.440
and actually I had to find it out Myself.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.000
And that’s how I went to all these people

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:30.920
in a garb that “I have come to learn” — they never recognized Me.

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.560
What you do and all those things.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.520
And that’s how I have been able to find out methods,

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.280
in the permutation, combinations of your barriers,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.120
how to achieve en masse realization.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.240
In the beginning of My life, I started with normal, common people,

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.880
intelligent people, educated people in all walks of life.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.720
I had to go through various types of phases,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.840
in which I met all types of people,

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.440
and I could, through My subtle methods,

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.040
find out what are the barriers.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.720
But the worst of all,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.400
which concerned Me the most of all,

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.679
was that the great seekers of the ancient times

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:23.560
have gone into such mesmerism,

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.840
into such ego-pampering processes

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.680
that how will they retreat back?

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.400
It was a big concern to Me.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.120
I have tried —

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.639
after getting so many normal people first to Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.320
then to these combinations —

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.960
I must confess

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.320
that it is not easy to give realization to people

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.920
who have been to those gurus.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.080
Day in and day out

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.120
I have to work out the permutations and combinations of barriers,

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.919
of terrible barriers within them.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.199
It’s not an easy thing,

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.720
but, thank God, I have achieved it

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.600
by My own love and concern.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.440
Still I must tell you: those who belong to some guru

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.120
are very difficult people for realization.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.960
Last year in Melbourne

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:33.680
we had about, I think, fifty people like that,

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:38.160
and it was impossible to give them realization;

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.880
and they even tried their level best —

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.720
they found it difficult to get it,

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.760
while a drunkard could get it in no time,

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.280
an alcoholic could get it in no time,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.560
a prostitute could get it in no time.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.320
Can you imagine?

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.400
What harm is done within yourself

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.399
that it is not easy to give them realization!

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.439
And even if they get realization —

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.280
because they are so ego-oriented — they fall back.

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.840
They mock, that’s the only thing they can do.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.120
They are least bothered about their own realization.

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.840
They are not bothered. They are identified with that idea

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.360
that they belong to some sort of a cult,

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.159
and they always try to be with them.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.040
Even in Perth we went, then in Adelaide,

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.920
I found these, some of them, are paid by gurus

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.919
to come and disturb us.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.880
To that extent these people, who are seekers of God, are going down.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:47.199
They have no eyes, no sensitivity to feel what is the truth.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.960
And they are not bothered about their own well-being.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.120
This is the worst thing that is happening to them.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:58.000
It’s a thing of concern. Every time I have an interview anywhere —

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.600
in Australia, America, anywhere — they ask Me such questions

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.040
that “Why not your government stops these things?

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.840
Why not your government do something about these people?

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.639
They have amassed so much of money.”

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.360
This Muktananda now, we have learnt, officially, he has got

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.399
sixty thousand rupees worth of diamonds,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.280
and both the disciples are fighting for it.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Still, you see, it is impossible for people to accept

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.600
that “Whatever has happened has happened,

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:41.120
it’s a naiveness we went into. Let us get to the real thing.”

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.920
They just can’t think of it.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.320
And anything that guru says, they listen to it,

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.440
not even logically think about it.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.280
Moreover, if you talk to them, they don’t know anything about reality.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.480
Now, as you have seen Warren,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.760
then you have seen William,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.080
there are all these Sahaja Yogis who are equipped

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.399
with complete knowledge about Kundalini,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.560
how to give realization and how to cure people, what are the problems.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.000
I mean, William, I had never told him anything about it as such.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:17.240
But he has given realization to so many people in your Melbourne.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.040
So you start manifesting your own powers,

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.360
and you don’t live on some sort of an ego

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.200
that you belong to some cult or anything,

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.960
but you belong to yourself.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.400
Every individual becomes a beautiful flower.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.199
That’s what we have to expect within ourselves.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.280
That’s what really you are seeking.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.080
Not to be called into this guru or that guru

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.600
but your own guru within yourself — is your Spirit,

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:47.000
is the Shiva’s Spirit within you.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.280
Today, of course, he has already told you

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:54.560
about these three centers which I would like to deal with you.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:00.200
The first center that I dealt

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.160
and the second and third are very important,

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.040
but these higher centers

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:14.840
are playing a very vital role in our being.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.840
The one which is the Heart center

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:25.000
is looking after

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:31.200
the security of God’s children.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:38.240
When a person sees something horrible,

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.600
this center starts pulsating fast.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.159
Till the age of twelve years,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.600
the sternum bone, which is placed in the ribs here, as you know,

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:57.000
creates antibodies to fight any invasion within,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.280
whether mental, emotional, or physical.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:06.040
These antibodies get distributed, till the age of twelve years,

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:11.960
throughout your body.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.960
And when this sternum gets the message,

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.800
it starts shaking,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.240
and it conveys, communicates, through no …

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.400
nerves or arteries or veins — any connection known so far —

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.520
to these antibodies that they should all fight.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.120
They fight the disease,

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:44.320
they fight also the things what you call possessions.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:50.040
They also fight your own mistakes.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:57.120
That’s why this is a very important center within us.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:02.560
If a lady is an insecure woman,

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.800
if she feels insecure,

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.320
then this center is always in a pulsating mood.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.520
And that’s how it makes all the antibodies very tired,

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.920
because they are all the time in a state of emergency.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.680
Also these cults have used

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.280
this method of putting people onto emergency:

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.480
give them exercises where they jump, jump, jump, or something like that.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.080
Now, you can ask any doctor,

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.720
this kind of jumping without any support

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.320
can create impotency in a personality.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.720
Now, this is very physically used method by these people,

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.920
to make them nervous

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:54.919
by making this center go very fast.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.199
Now, when these antibodies are tired,

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.920
they become absolutely numbed down,

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:07.120
and they cannot find any strength to fight any aggression.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.840
Now, in everyday life also,

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.600
if some lady, as I told you, is nervous,

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:18.680
and she has problem, and she’s always afraid,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:23.800
then what happens — that this system

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.480
starts exerting itself too much;

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.120
ultimately it gets sick,

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:36.320
and then she can develop a disease called the breast cancer.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.920
This breast cancer is very common nowadays

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.120
among women in the West.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:50.480
Because the motherhood of the lady is challenged.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.680
This center is bestowed upon

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.040
by the deity of Mother of the Universe.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:05.240
And when the lady finds that her motherhood is challenged,

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:10.760
then she starts feeling very nervous,

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.000
this center goes into over-activity,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.000
and then she developed this cancer of the breast,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.200
troubles of the breast, all kinds of such troubles.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.040
Because the antibodies have become now very weak.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.400
On the left-hand side of this center

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.480
is the center what we call as the left Heart center.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.720
But beyond that is residing the Spirit,

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:53.240
in your heart, in the organ, separated from everyone.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:59.760
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within yourself.

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.440
And the Kundalini is the Holy Ghost,

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.320
which is the Power of God,

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.960
which is the Primordial Mother,

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.520
expressed within you as the Kundalini.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:23.480
So we have got within us that power, shakti,

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.800
and the Shiva, sitting in your heart.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:33.399
So this Kundalini has to rise to give you realization.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:38.240
The baptism, the real baptism. Not an artificial one.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:45.400
Now, how it can happen in a person is a problem.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.120
It used to happen. What knowledge I am telling you

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.879
is not the knowledge of today.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.439
Is the knowledge of very very ancient times.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.240
Fourteen thousand years back,

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:01.400
Markandeya, a great poet in India, has written about it.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.080
After that

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:07.320
there were many other poets who wrote about it,

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.240
till, in the sixth century, Adi Shankaracharya

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.280
very clearly wrote about the Kundalini and its awakening.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.520
Nobody has said so far,

00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:22.920
from those ancient writers, that Kundalini gives you any problems,

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.719
or she makes you dance, jump and all that — is all modern nonsense.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.840
Traditionally, nobody has said so.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.440
Sixth century is the time

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.040
when Adi Shankaracharya incarnated on this earth.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.280
Buddha got His realization without doing any dancing or anything.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.959
You know for definite.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.680
So this new idea of all these happenings

00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.680
come by a generation of these horrible people

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.000
in the last fifty years.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.520
I would say there has been a Holy Trinity

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.360
as well as a Unholy Trinity.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.440
These people preceded the others who were to come,

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.400
to execute what they wanted to do.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.280
These antichrists had two type of things,

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:21.200
because … how to neutralize also the writings of the ancient times.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.080
Like Freud — was one of them.

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.600
There are some more. They came down like this

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.760
and wrote some things to uproot human beings completely,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.040
first of all, from reality.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.840
And then another lot came in

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.879
for using that as a written thing for them —

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.399
because writing is something great —

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.600
and then preaching what these people have preached,

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.040
using that as a base to express themselves.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.919
You see, all hand-in-gloves knowledge.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.280
But if you read any ancient book —

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.080
which many are not translated…

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.040
Because nobody’s interested in that!

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.440
They diverted all our attention from the sublime

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:22.000
to absolutely wretched life.

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.679
And this uprooting has taken place

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:28.080
because these are antichrist activities;

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.240
they are all joined together, they never talk against each other,

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.360
that’s one thing great about them.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.799
And Christ has said

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.520
that Satan is not going to talk against his own house.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.880
They praise each other, meet each other,

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.840
I’ve seen them behaving like that.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.199
Give them presents, this one gives presents to another —

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.560
big fraternity exists between them.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:54.160
Great fraternity, no problem between them.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.520
But the real saints in India,

00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:02.040
who are living in the forest and Himalayas,

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.880
into the hills and dales, I should say,

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:11.080
hidden away from … you people,

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.760
are just quite aware that these are antichrist.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.520
The first thing that happened when these people

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.200
started manifesting themselves — India is very good at astrology,

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.120
so, as soon as their birth date came in, they just cast their… horoscope

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.200
and said, “Now let’s see what’s in their horoscope.”

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.080
So, most of them changed their birth dates also.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.960
Nothing consistent!

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.560
And when you ask them, “Why are you not consistent?”

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:50.680
they said change is the way the life is.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:55.640
But that is life. You are talking of something eternal.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:59.040
How can eternal change?

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.960
It’s very difficult

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.839
to make people take to eternal life

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.200
than to make them take to just mundane life. You know that.

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:15.160
Now, see, there’s a show on today. How many cars there are!

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.720
And how many people there are to see that!

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.360
But to take to real life, it takes time,

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.080
otherwise why is it all the great saints

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.440
and all the great prophets and incarnations

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.879
were tortured by human beings?

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.080
Why did they torture them?

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.200
So this is one of the things one has to realize —

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.000
that the Spirit resides in your heart.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.360
Which is the Sat-chit-ananda, as they say —

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.799
is the one which is the truth,

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.240
which is the attention,

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:54.760
and which is the joy.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.400
Now, first of all, we must understand what is attention.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.080
What is “God who is an attention”, what does that mean.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.200
“God who is the attention” means

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.520
God knows about everything that’s happening.

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.880
He is aware of what is happening in this world.

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:26.920
He's the only spectator of the drama of life,

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.759
which is created by His Power, the Primordial Mother.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.200
He knows each and everything about us;

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.520
whatever He wants to know, He can find out,

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.240
there is no problem about it.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.960
So He is the knower,

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.520
and He is the knowledge too.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.440
So, when we become realized,

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:55.920
we have to know through our awareness:

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.160
we have to become collectively conscious.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:03.760
And this is a very important point which we must remember.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.920
It’s not very difficult to understand

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.040
that you have to become something more.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.160
Only by wearing some dress

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.560
or putting something in your neck what do you become?

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.720
Some people tell Me, “We lead a very good life, Mother,

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.880
so it should be all right.”

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.000
But “good life” is according to your concept.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.799
Even according to the divine concept,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.800
if it is a good life — for what?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.720
Everybody will ask, “For what?

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.800
Why do you want to lead such a religious life, for what?

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
What is the need to have such a life?”

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.319
One should ask oneself, “Why to lead such a life

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.520
which is so conditioned?”

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.560
The answer is, you have to have balance to ascend.

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.320
If you do not ascend, what’s the use

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.720
of building up this balance within you?

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.319
The purpose is to ascend.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.720
If you cannot transcend,

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.960
then this is just a binding, your mental projection

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.720
that you should lead this kind of life and that kind of life.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.360
It’s just your mental process.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:15.799
But when the Spirit ascends,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.200
then all the religions are born within you.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.960
They get enlightenment. You just don’t do things which are wrong.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.279
Just don’t do it, you just don’t like it.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.600
As we have told you that there are people who gave up

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.320
their drugs and things overnight. Is a fact!

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.400
Because, as soon as this happens,

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:42.360
the enlightenment brings forth

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:47.200
complete new awareness

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.040
which refuses to have anything that is not good for this body.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:58.240
You just have the things that are good for your body, for your life.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.280
You don’t have to fight with yourself

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.960
that “Oh God, how will I give up?” In the morning you say,

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:06.799
“I will not drink in the night,” but in the night you drink.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.319
So, in the beginning there is no need in Sahaja Yoga today

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.560
to say that “Don’t do this and don’t do that.”

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.360
There’s no need at all.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:21.920
Once it is enlightened within you, you just look after yourself.

00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.560
But when the Spirit starts coming in your attention,

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.520
you become collectively conscious, and you know.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:33.600
You know, again. It’s not mental projection.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.120
You know about yourself.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.160
You know what centers are catching, on your fingers you can tell.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.120
Fingertips, you can say. You know on your fingertips.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.400
And you know about others also.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:51.279
And also, if you really learn the complete technique —

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.640
which is very easy to learn, within a week you can learn it —

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.720
you can help another and yourself very well

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:03.760
to rise above this level to a higher level.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.840
People have all kinds of fears these days.

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.080
It’s a very abnormal situation.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.720
They don’t have any joy. Only fear. They live with fear.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.240
They were telling Me there’s a person who cannot live out

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.960
in the space, then there’s fear of even building bad oxygen,

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.319
then they have fear of germ touching them,

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:28.320
and all those things are there. They have lost confidence in life.

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.520
By awakening of this center within you,

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.520
you become absolutely a normal person.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.520
You have no fears.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:41.200
Because nothing that is wrong can attack you.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.800
You are well prepared for it.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.640
There’s a strength within you which really

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.800
makes you very confident.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.400
That’s why this center is very important

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.400
for us to know that this center

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:03.279
gives us that strength, that confidence.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.000
The other day — every program —

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.240
they asked Me another question:

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:11.040
“What do You think about Australians?”

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.959
Which is a very very common question, I’ve found.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:19.120
I said that they are great people, very nice people.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:24.360
But they lack only one thing — is complete confidence in themselves.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.640
They haven’t got that confidence that they should have.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:30.600
They are not aggressive people, they are not worried

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.320
about aggressing other territories or anything.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.320
But a kind of a diffidence is still in them

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.040
which they should get rid of it. Completely.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.839
You are the people who belong to God.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:47.920
And why should you have any diffidence about it?

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.600
But this diffidence

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:56.480
is completely finished

00:42:56.680 --> 00:43:01.040
when you get this center awakened within you.

00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:05.840
To get this center awakened, you have to do nothing.

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.360
The Kundalini herself rises,

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.400
and if you have any problem in that center, she comes back;

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.120
again she rises with a greater force and hits there,

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:22.320
opens it out and awakens the deity of that center,

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.600
so that you feel very confident.

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.360
Today, if you see, Dr. Warren so confident.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.560
I must tell you, he was not,

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.840
he was quite diffident.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.560
He thought you all are going to beat him

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.240
when he tells you all these things.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.880
But today he’s a changed man.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:47.160
Now, we have on the right-hand side of this,

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.800
is another part of the center, which we call as right Heart.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.320
This center is the father’s center,

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:58.120
and the left Heart is the mother’s center.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:04.399
So, if your fatherhood is challenged in any way —

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.640
or, also, husband-wise, we can say it like that —

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:12.120
if a husband is not loyal to his wife

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.080
and is playing tricks with her,

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.600
he gets this into trouble.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:24.400
But physically, he feels it very much

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.960
because he gets asthma.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:31.439
Asthma one develops,

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:35.080
but this is more a center of the father.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:37.640
If the fatherhood of a person is not all right,

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.280
for example, if a girl has lost her father

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.920
and she has never seen him, she might develop asthma.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.279
If the grandfather had the asthma,

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.360
the grandchild might develop the asthma.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.040
It comes from the father’s side.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.560
Anybody who has asthma problem should know

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.760
that there's something wrong in the fatherhood side.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.760
Maybe the father is sick and you are worried,

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.200
maybe you are a good father, but the son is not all right,

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.880
so you are suffering — anything like that, you see,

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.040
could be responsible for this asthma.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.959
But if the deity here is awakened, you can be all right,

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.080
and you can get rid of your asthma, quite all right.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:29.760
On the left-hand side is the center of your mother.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.800
If the mother has died very early,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.840
such a person is a nervous person,

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.040
and such a person also doesn’t trust anyone.

00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:45.479
He can become secretive by nature, sulking type.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:50.799
He may not open his heart to anyone, because he doesn’t trust anyone.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.440
Some people who have no mother,

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.319
whom they have not known,

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.680
can become extremely cautious by nature

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.960
because they think they have to look after themselves.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.720
Extremely cautious.

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.560
But with Sahaja Yoga, you can awaken this center,

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.040
and you become a complete personality,

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.200
without any fear, without any nervousness,

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.320
and without any malice to your parents.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.600
Actually, after Sahaja Yoga, I’ve found,

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:25.800
many people who have just forgotten their parents,

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.440
had been very angry with their parents,

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:31.400
given them up, could not forgive them —

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.520
went back to their parents.

00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:36.959
We had a French girl in England

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.480
who had not seen her mother for eighteen years,

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:43.720
and the mother was alone, a widow lady.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.200
But after the realization, she has a tremendous feeling;

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.360
she went back and looked after her mother,

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.560
and also started doing Sahaja Yoga there.

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.920
It’s not … it’s a very very common thing

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.759
that you start expanding your heart to others.

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.920
You start loving other people,

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.520
you start understanding them.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.480
I know of a man in America — I gave him realization —

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.960
and he said, “Most surprising, I went to the race this time.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.720
I said this would be the last I go to the race.

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.120
And there I find my uncle, and I wished him;

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.440
and he was amazed, he started looking at me,

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.200
because I had not wished him all these years at all.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.080
He just started, he was quite amazed at my attitude.

00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.320
And now he has become a great friend of mine.”

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.240
So the friendship —

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.000
which is a pure friendship, this homosexual and all nonsense —

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:40.240
but a pure friendship based on pure relationship develops.

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.560
And then you don’t feel insecure.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.040
In a society where even a mother’s love is challenged,

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:52.359
one would feel extremely insecure in a thing like that.

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:54.840
If a mother has to love the child, she has to think,

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.200
“I hope there is no bad feeling in my mind.”

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.720
In America it happened: there was a little boy of eight years,

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.920
just a little boy of eight years.

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.080
And her mother said that she has started taking

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.160
lot of drugs and things,

00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:15.680
and these drugs have created a problem

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.720
for this little boy of eight years, can you imagine?

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.040
So I couldn’t bear it, I just took the boy to My heart,

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.919
and I kissed him.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.920
He said, “Mother, this is never done to me by my mother.”

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.799
So I asked the lady, “Why didn’t you do this to your child?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.360
He’s only eight years of age, doesn’t he love your care,

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.680
and your expression of your love?”

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.920
So she said, “Mother, I feel guilty.” I said, “How?” —

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.680
“Freud has said…” Freud was a perverted useless fellow!

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:51.760
He died of cancer, look at his life!

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.120
These psychologists, when they come in contact with others,

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:00.720
people who are suffering from pathological troubles —

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.640
they are pathological cases —

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.840
and when they deal with pathological cases,

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.080
they don’t know how to protect them. Jung has said about it.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.960
Then they catch those diseases among themselves,

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.480
and they start generalizing this for everyone.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.560
They have generalized, it’s an absurd thing!

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.200
In Rome, there was a girl who came to Me, she said,

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.720
“Ah, psychologists, horrid, horrid, horrid!”

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:26.080
I said, “What happened?” — “They are telling me I have bad eyes

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:30.640
towards my father. I felt like beating them!”

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:34.440
It's all absurd things, you see, to create — this is anti-Christ —

00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.879
to create a feeling of enmity,

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.840
that everything is perverted, polluted.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.920
It’s so pure!

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:46.480
In India nobody can understand this.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:49.399
Thank God this Freud and all these people just touched

00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.880
the periphery of India, and it’s like an elephant:

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:58.080
so nobody is there, and it’s just gone … nobody believes in it.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:02.600
So, I have to tell you this, that there is no such thing

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:07.600
as polluted relationship or bad relationship.

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:10.120
It’s all pure relationships.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.560
We must understand we are not animals.

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:16.280
Even animals have got sense, so do you think we won’t have

00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:21.280
the sense of purity within us and holiness within us?

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.880
So all these ideas also drop out completely,

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.440
and you develop a personality.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.480
You live with others: in the ashram now we have

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.960
many girls, boys, this — they’re all are like brothers and sisters.

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.040
There is no problem on that.

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.640
Now, we have the other centre,

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.720
which we call as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.800
This is a very very important center

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.280
which is bestowed upon by Shri Krishna Himself.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:53.680
The right Heart by Shri Rama, and left Heart by Uma,

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.120
or we can call Her the wife of Shiva;

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:01.240
while the centre Heart is bestowed upon by the Mother,

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:04.200
called Jagadamba, who is the one

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:08.840
who helps people to cross this ocean of illusion,

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:11.880
and to protect them. This is the Divine Mother.

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.600
The other day you were asking Me about Divine Mother —

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.600
this is one of the glimpse of Her.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.040
So now the other center which we have here

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:23.479
is very important center, called as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.640
This is the center Vi-shuddha. One is “shuddha”, means “pure”,

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.560
but “vishuddha” means “absolutely pure”.

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.040
This has got sixteen petals,

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.640
as we have got the cervical plexus expressed in the gross,

00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.600
which has also got sixteen sub-plexuses.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.040
It tallies with medical science completely.

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:49.720
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra is bestowed upon

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.840
by the deity of Shri Krishna.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:58.320
Shri Krishna is the one which is the evolution

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.200
of the Vishnu Tattwa [Vishnu Principle] from there

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:06.400
upward to the state of Primordial Being.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:11.040
He is the one who resides

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.120
as the Primordial Being, as the Whole, as the Akbar.

00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:19.880
When Mohammed Sahib talked of Akbar, he talked of Shri Krishna.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.520
This is the finger which represents this center,

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:28.040
and He said: “Put these into your ears

00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.560
and say ‘Allah hu Akbar’ —

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.160
you get in connection with the Virat.”

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.960
Now, what Sahaja Yoga does is to make you

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.080
in contact with the whole.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.680
It makes you in contact with the whole.

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.880
It’s not that it limits you,

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.000
but it makes you one with the whole.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.080
So one must understand

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.360
that what you have to achieve in your realization

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:58.200
is just not talk of Shri Krishna, just thinking, singing about —

00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.800
which is absurd! People don’t understand!

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.280
That in Oxford Street we find people

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:06.600
with all these nonsensical things going on;

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.160
begging, asking for alms…

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:12.760
I feel it’s such an insult to Shri Krishna

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.400
that people in His name are begging.

00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.560
But it’s done in all religious movements

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:22.320
that people beg in the name of God.

00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.040
There is no need to beg.

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.080
First you equip yourself with the blessings of God

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.640
that there is no need for you to beg at all.

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.960
And begging is against God’s realization,

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.920
against Self-realization.

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:40.920
You must have self-esteem. That’s one thing very important.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:45.080
If you do not have self-esteem, you cannot get realization.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.480
Why should you go on the streets and beg?

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.879
It's absolutely absurd, it's a showing-off thing,

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.000
which is of no use to yourself.

00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:59.480
By doing this, you are really corrupting the name of Shri Krishna.

00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.319
But if you take to the right path,

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.440
if this center is awakened,

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:08.680
your hands become connected with the Primordial Being,

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:13.400
and you become, your hands become collectively conscious.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.200
Medically, they accept that the extremities

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.480
have got something to do with the sympathetic nervous system.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.960
That far, no more than that.

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.520
But in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be amazed

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:27.319
that the vibration starts flowing through your hand

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:30.560
when you take the name of Shri Krishna.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:34.480
And these vibrations, when you want to find out what are these,

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:38.640
then you’ll be amazed they relate to your centers within yourself.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:41.680
Even if you get ten children who are realized souls,

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.000
and tie their eyes, and ask them about a person

00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.359
who is sitting before them what’s wrong with him,

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:49.520
they will say one finger, or this finger,

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:51.480
or this finger, or two fingers.

00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.839
Because you can feel the charring,

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.759
you can feel sometimes a kind of a heat.

00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.480
Sometimes you may feel the numbness.

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.919
If you feel the numbness on your fingers,

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.839
then you must know that the person has to die.

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.240
So many things you can know, all the permutations

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:14.600
of these seven centers and this one:

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:19.000
one, five, and … six and seven.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:22.200
So we have seven centers.

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.280
To understand about the centers,

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.480
first you must get your realization, that is important.

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:30.600
In the beginning you’ll find the vibrations are coming, going,

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.320
coming, going. It is not steady.

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:35.080
First you must steady yourself.

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.880
Then you can find out, from your hands,

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.920
what are the centers catching.

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.720
Because these vibrations are nothing

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.040
but the Power of God is flowing through you.

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:50.800
They understand, these vibrations, they co-ordinate.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.320
They are life’s force.

00:55:52.520 --> 00:55:57.160
They are the one who create all these living things

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.720
like … they are the one who sprout a seed,

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:06.840
they are the one who transform the flower into a fruit.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.200
All living work is done by these vibrations,

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:15.040
which is called as Chaitanya, Aum, Ruh,

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:19.479
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, and all-pervading Power of God.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.839
That starts flowing through you, first time you feel them.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:24.880
Yesterday many people felt it, and people were very happy

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:27.799
that so many felt it, because that’s a sign

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000
that here many people are going to get realization.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.080
You don’t have to go to anybody,

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.480
you have to just practice a little bit and find out.

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:43.200
You’ll become such an expert!

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.920
One person in India who got realization

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:51.799
has so far given realization to at least ten thousand people.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.040
In a village. Many villages.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:57.680
He’s a very ordinary man. We wanted him to come,

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:02.200
but there was a kind of a visa problem, so he could not come.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.280
He’s a very simple farmer, and he got his realization,

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.720
and he knows so much about Sahaja Yoga that you’ll be amazed;

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:12.280
he has not been to any university, to any college or anything,

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.920
but he’s so knowledgeable.

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.680
Because once you have these vibrations they guide you.

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:22.200
So the Spirit sitting in your heart

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:27.160
guides you and tells you what is right and what is wrong.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:31.840
If you have to ask a question: “Mother, is there God?” —

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.680
if you ask this question, immediately there will be

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:38.440
a tremendous flow saying that it is there.

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.920
Now, how to understand that these are the vibrations of God,

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.960
also this question can come.

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.120
We can judge them relatively.

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.560
For example, in one of the programs in Pune,

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.000
people invited Me to speak

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.359
in a place which was owned by brahmins, and they opposed it.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.759
They said, “She’s not a brahmin, so we will not have her here.”

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.800
So they said, “All right, we’ll publish in the newspaper —

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.360
because Her name has gone in the newspaper — we’ll tell them

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.640
that these people are so ‘brahminic’ that they don’t want to have Her.”

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.800
Of course, they didn’t want to have that bad name,

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.840
so they said, “All right, let’s have her.”

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.480
These people never told Me what had happened.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.960
Suddenly I said, “Those who think who are brahmins, come down.”

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.919
So four-five of them came and sat before Me.

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.520
These are brahmins without knowing the Brahma!

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.720
So I said, “All right, put your hands before Me.”

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.440
And they just started shaking like this, going back.

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.400
I said, “What’s happening to you?”

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.920
So they said, “Mother, you are Shakti,

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:35.759
that’s why it is happening to me, to us,”

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.440
but I said, “What about others? It’s not happening to others.”

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.040
So they turned round and said, “Look at these,

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.319
they are also doing like this.”

00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.320
I said, “Ask them from where do they come.”

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.080
They went and asked them; they said, “We are coming

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:48.920
from the lunatic asylum of Thane.”

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:51.880
So these fanatics, who believed that they were brahmins,

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:56.720
were reacting the same way as these lunatics.

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.799
And they believed that they were brahmins,

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.720
they were not supposed to touch anybody,

00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.400
they were “untouchables” people, and they were …

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:09.000
the one who gave them realization was from so-called untouchable,

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.839
a shoemaker.

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.200
Now he’s become their guru, of all these brahmins,

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.440
and he’s teaching them about God.

00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:19.879
So this center gives you the power

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:22.440
to be one with the whole.

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:26.480
It has many powers, but the main power it gives you

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.560
is the power to be one with the whole

00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:34.760
and to have all the powers of that deity within you awakened,

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.760
so that you can become aware

00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:43.320
and make others also aware of it.

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.800
Those people who talk too much catch on the right Vishuddhi,

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.080
those who do not talk at all catch on the left.

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.760
Those who feel guilty catch on the left,

00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:55.040
those who think they are all right and aggressive,

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.319
they catch on the right. It’s like that.

00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:01.360
So this has to be understood in right perspective:

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.640
that if you misuse this center, what happens to you,

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.800
so how you should give yourself a balance to improve that.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.560
But the best part of Sahaja Yoga is this:

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.120
that when you get them realization,

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.040
they are separated from themselves.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:21.200
They’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, my Agnya Chakra is catching.”

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.880
So, if you ask them, “Really?” — “Yes, Mother, very much.”

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.040
That means they are suffering from too much ego.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.839
But can you imagine anybody saying,

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.920
“Mother, I’m suffering from too much ego”?

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:36.279
Because you are separated from yourself, you see your ego,

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:37.960
the big balloonic-like thing,

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:40.720
and you say, “Mother, please remove my ego.”

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.720
That is how people talk to Me.

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.600
They will tell Me: “Mother, I talk too much,

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.640
that’s why my right Vishuddhi is catching.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.520
You better cure it, I must stop my talking too much.”

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.319
So you start correcting yourself

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.920
because you get separated from yourself,

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:57.160
you become the Spirit; and the rest you see.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.840
Like I see My sari: if there’s a spot,

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.960
I would like to clean it, I’m not identified with the spot.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:06.960
So, that’s how it happens; you are no more identified with yourself,

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:10.640
and you start seeing the faults in you, and you try to correct it.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.240
That’s how you become a beautiful person — by your own attention,

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.600
not by anybody else, it is you who has to do it.

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:23.000
Now, we have a very important center here

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.799
called as Agnya Chakra.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.960
This is bestowed upon

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:33.440
by the great incarnation of Lord Jesus Christ.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.480
We have no idea as to how this incarnation

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.600
has come on this earth.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:44.480
Because if you just read Bible, it is a little bit of Christ we see.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.560
They allowed Him to live only for about four years

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.400
to talk to people; within four years He was killed.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.360
So He had no time to tell you all about it.

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.520
But He did the job what He was supposed to do

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.000
and which He achieved in His lifetime.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.520
But if you read some books,

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.319
in other scriptures like Devi Mahatmyam,

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:13.520
where the Goddess was the one who created Him —

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.960
and how She created, and what She did to Him,

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.240
and everything is given in detail —

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.480
and in every detail, you’ll be surprised, is the life of Christ.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.600
Only thing, there He is called as Mahavishnu and not as Christ.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.800
But even the name of Christ comes to Him

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.480
from the same heritage which I was telling you:

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:37.279
that His name was Yeshu, not Jesus,

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.240
because, in the Bible, I get Myself confused when I read

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.160
that Anna was not Anna, it was Hannah, John was Johann —

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:49.640
every name has been corrupted in the English Bible.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:54.320
In the same way they have corrupted Christ’s name, Yeshu, into Jesus.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.600
Actually, they call Him — some people, of course — call Him Jesu.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:01.480
This is the name given to Him by Shri Radhaji,

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:04.759
the one who was the power of Shri Krishna.

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.280
She's the one who gave Him this name

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.600
because She was very much indebted

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.160
to the foster mother of Shri Krishna, who was Yeshoda,

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.280
and that’s why She called Him Yeshu.

01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.240
“Yeshu” is the word in Hebrew language,

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.440
and we call Yeshoda as Yeshu;

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.480
also some people, in a … what you call … in a country language,

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:28.600
also call the same thing as Jesu.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.000
You know that Y and J is always sort of

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:35.240
brought together in that way: like Yugoslavia, we call it —

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.080
they call it Jugoslavia.

01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.120
So His name Yeshu came from that,

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.320
and that’s how He was created a special one.

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.320
In the Devi Mahatmyam it is said that Krishna has said

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:51.800
that “You will become the support of the universe.”

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:56.680
Now, in India, people and seers were waiting for Mahavishnu

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.920
to come and tell them that, Mahavishnu has been born.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.359
But the people who went to India,

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:06.400
they had Bible in one hand and the pistol in another hand,

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.560
or a big gun, or maybe a huge big cannon.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.520
And that’s how they entered India,

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.439
and they said that “You must get converted.”

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:18.359
Now, what is a “conversion” God only knows. You can take a donkey

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.400
and put a thing on that “You are a Christian” —

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.279
you don’t become a Christian.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.720
That’s how they spread Christianity throughout India,

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.240
which was all absurd type of Christianity.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:31.800
I was also born in one of the Protestant Christian families.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.800
My father was a realized soul, My mother was another,

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.720
they were very learned people.

01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.720
And My father told Me, “God, look at this now,

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.360
what are these Christians doing to Christ!”

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:48.279
And he was the one who fought for Independence,

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.320
he went to jail, My mother went to jail, and he was member

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.280
of our constituent assembly, parliament and all that,

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.880
but Christians only started recognizing him

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.520
when he became a member of something or a mayor of a place.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.600
They had no other idea of a person,

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:05.520
that somebody has Spiritual endowment

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.680
or any sort of a Spiritual powers.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.480
Now, in our family,

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:14.799
we were very much with Gandhiji, all of us;

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.280
we had sacrificed a lot for the country,

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:20.760
and My father decided to marry us all out of community,

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.040
not among Christians, because he thought these Christians

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.600
are so much worshipping these missionaries:

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:30.120
they would even pray for their health,

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.640
the health of their dog, and health of their umbrellas.

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:37.680
It was such a wretched condition of these Christians in those days;

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.760
I mean, they were so dedicated to these missionaries.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.240
The missionaries were only busy converting people.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:49.640
Now, this Mahavishnu Tattwa — the one who was born as Christ —

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.480
was never understood, never told,

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.720
they never read anything about it they never found out.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:59.920
So, Indians believed that so far Mahavishnu is not born,

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.200
and so it continued with the idea

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.440
that we have to still go on.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.640
Because in the principle Mahavishnu it was written

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.840
that “Not only You will be the support of the universe,

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:14.480
but You will have such purity within You,” —

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.759
because He is the Omkara, He’s the Chaitanya,

01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:20.440
He’s the vibrations, that’s why He could walk,

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.560
that’s why He was resurrected —

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:26.920
that it was said that when His Advent will come,

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:30.120
He will cross this path —

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.800
this is the cross, the resurrection part —

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.360
and, by His advancement,

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.920
He will be able to suck in

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.799
the ego and superego within you, the karmas,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.600
the conditionings, the ego in you,

01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:47.360
by which people will get their realization.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:50.080
So Indians continued with the idea

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.920
that “We have to still pay for our karmas, Mahavishnu has not come.”

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.280
Because of misrepresentation.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:00.240
Once I told them that Christ was Mahavishnu, you see,

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.280
thousands are getting realization because they believe in Mahavishnu,

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.560
they of course respect Christ very much, but they did not know

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.120
that He was Mahavishnu; if He’s Mahavishnu, it’s perfect!

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.360
And that’s how He was enlightened, and He got -

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.320
the people got their realization in no time.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:18.960
Because they are educated in it, they know what it is.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.640
You see, these missionaries just read some Bible

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.360
in some schools and all that and came down.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.279
But they did not know how to correlate the whole thing.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:29.760
You see, it cannot be truth just in Bible,

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.320
it has to be everywhere.

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:35.080
And that is what happened when they came down

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:41.280
and they told us something which was not Christ.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.160
Now, this thing happens to us also:

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:46.560
that when Kundalini rises,

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.960
Christ is born within you here, He’s awakened within you.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:55.000
And when He is awakened, the ego and superego both are sucked in,

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.200
and you get a space here;

01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:00.560
and when you get that space here, the Kundalini shoots off,

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:05.600
and that’s how you feel the cool breeze on your head.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:10.439
I have given at least seven lectures continuously on Christ

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:14.240
in a church called as Unity Church.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:16.760
It was, again, the unity and fraternity

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:19.359
of all the horrible people.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.880
They were preaching about Rajneesh, preaching about …

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.960
at least Rajneesh is antichrist, anybody can see.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:29.319
When Christ has said: “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes” —

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.320
to that extent His purity has gone —

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:36.360
how can you accept Rajneesh as a guru for any Spirituality?

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.480
But they had books from all kinds of horrible people.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:42.080
They had no books which were ancient books with them,

01:08:42.279 --> 01:08:44.719
nothing, no knowledge of any kind!

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.160
Indians don’t depend — the real Indians, I mean,

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.040
not the westernized pseudo-Indians

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.840
who have been to Cambridge and Oxford —

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.319
but those who are real Indians don’t depend on these books:

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.200
they think it’s all trash that has come and will go away,

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:58.519
it has no meaning.

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.880
And they had all these books put there to destroy.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.319
Really the unity within us lies —

01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.280
when you become collectively conscious.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.919
All this work has been done in the ancient times.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.080
As Mohammed was one of the Prophets who came,

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:20.679
out of the ten Prophets: Moses, Abraham,

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.960
Lao Tse …

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:28.880
then we had also people like other Prophets …

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.479
Socrates…

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.680
Recently, we had in India the last one,

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.840
is the Sai Nath — not the “Satya” one, but the Sai Nath —

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.600
who lived … who was representing

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:47.520
this great principle of Primordial Master.

01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:51.280
So this is the story of your evolution.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:55.120
The last is the most important center, is the Sahasrara,

01:09:55.320 --> 01:10:01.679
which is open today, open from 1970, 5 May,

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000
that we can feel the Sahasrara opening out.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.519
About this center also, if you go to My center,

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:14.600
you’ll find many, many tapes

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.720
which will explain to you this center.

01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.920
The only thing is that all the seats

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:24.680
of all the subtle centers within us

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.760
lie along the line like this.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.440
And all the centers are within us. This is the Agnya Chakra.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.480
And that’s how it moves: this is the Vishuddhi Chakra,

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:38.960
this is the Heart, this is the Nabhi,

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.680
what you call the solar plexus;

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:46.160
then we have got, in the center here, is the Mooladhara,

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:51.160
and around it is what you call the Swadhishthana.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:53.360
That’s why when Swadhishthana goes out

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.960
or you get diabetes, you get blindness.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.160
Blindness is due to the fact that your Swadhisthana is not all right.

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:02.759
Many people get blind when their eyes open —

01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.840
can be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.000
In Geneva I cured a lady in ten minutes time.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:10.480
It’s all due to possessions that you get here.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.360
Coming to the Agnya Chakra, one has to say that all these chakras

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:16.720
have movement on both the sides:

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.760
one moves to the collective subconscious,

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.240
another moves to the collective supraconscious.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:24.599
Now, if at the Agnya Chakra you start moving like that,

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.280
in the collective subconscious you start seeing

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.679
all the dead things:

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.920
like great deities,

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:37.680
or you can also start think … past, we can say.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:40.960
If you move to the right, then you start seeing colors,

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.720
and also you start seeing lights and all those things.

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.320
With LSD also you can do it.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.600
If you take LSD … many people who used to take LSD

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.560
and were suffering from coma just came to Me,

01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.600
and they just never saw Me, they just saw the lights.

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.760
So, that is not the right thing to see Me as light

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.520
or as some previous deity —

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.120
is to see Me as I am, is the present.

01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.639
So we have to be in the present.

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.880
Sahaja Yoga brings you to the present moment,

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:15.800
by which you enjoy every moment of life in its all dynamics,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.480
and that’s how you become a dynamic,

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:23.080
loving, affectionate, relaxed personality.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.960
May God bless you all!

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.680
Thank you very much, three days have been very good.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.840
I would expect you also to come on Sunday morning —

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.720
not at seven o’clock as he said but at ten o’clock —

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.520
Sunday morning to our ashram, which he will tell you the address.

01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.240
Please come along, and you can also have your lunch with us.

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:47.919
I hope we’ll be able to cook something for all of you.

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.960
Because this is your Mother’s house,

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:54.200
and in a mother’s house you must at least eat your food.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.200
That’s what it is. It’s very personal, it’s very intimate,

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.799
it’s not like the guru sitting on the seventh storey

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.480
and all everybody bowing to him, it’s not like that.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.400
It’s absolutely personal, individual,

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.440
and everybody is given full, proper attention

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.320
and respect in Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.520
May God bless you!

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.320
Today we’ll not have any questions,

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.840
because we have had too many of them before and wasted lot of time.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.240
Let us have it without questions;

01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:38.960
without asking anything you can get your realization.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.599
So tell your mind to ask questions later on.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:44.360
Once you have got realization, you won’t ask,

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.160
so just tell your mind, which is working all the time

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.880
and giving you some ideas, tell it to wait.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.280
Because by thinking you have achieved nothing so far,

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.839
by mental conception you have not achieved anything.

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:59.880
Because, after all, this mind is a limited thing,

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.880
and you have to be triggered into unlimited space,

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:06.559
and for that, if you think, you cannot reach there.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.280
So, actually, first thing that happens to you —

01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:13.639
that your thought stops when the Kundalini crosses Agnya.

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.320
And when you feel this cool breeze,

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.560
you absolutely get calmed down and relaxed.

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.920
Yesterday was a great experience for people.

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:23.960
I’m sure today also it will work out the same way.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:26.559
You have to do exactly as I tell you,

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.760
which is a very simple thing, you don’t have to do anything great,

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.120
just take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.720
Just take out your shoes.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:18.000
Just take out your shoes, sit comfortably;

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.559
if you have anything tight on your body,

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.400
just remove it, but keep yourself comfortable.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.480
Put your hands on your laps.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.160
One thing is, you have to be comfortable,

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:29.320
so that during the process

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:32.080
you don’t feel any uncomfortable feeling.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:35.200
So, please just put your right hands …

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:40.240
both the hands towards Me first of all, just hands like this.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.960
Now you have to close your eyes.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.400
Please don’t open your eyes.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.160
Because if you open your eyes,

01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.040
the Kundalini won’t cross the Agnya Chakra.

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.760
So please don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:57.640
It’s nothing is going to happen, there’s nothing to have any fear,

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.920
everything is going to be all right.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.400
But I must warn: some people have a habit of showing off,

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.200
and they start going into a funny …

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.880
contortions and this — that is not needed at all here.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.559
It’s something that happens inside, antar-yoga.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.920
Nothing happens outside, it happens inside,

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.320
so be sensible and wise.

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.360
Take your realization — is the best thing that you can do to yourself

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.960
and to anybody else.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.760
So put your both the hands towards Me

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.960
and just close your eyes.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.000
Just close your eyes, all of you should close your eyes.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.400
Even if you have spectacles, you can remove

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:44.960
because it also improves your eyesight; so remove your spectacles.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:49.320
Sit very comfortably. Don’t worry about others,

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:53.040
just now you have to think about yourself.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.480
Now, left hand, as he said,

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.840
is the power of desire,

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:04.160
so put it … left hand on your lap towards Me.

01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:05.839
That is not to be removed.

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:09.519
Only use your right hand to raise your Kundalini

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.360
on different chakras on the left-hand side throughout.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.880
So we put our right hand on the heart. With full confidence!

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.680
Now, as I have said, you have to have confidence!

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.880
On the heart. If there is anything in your pocket,

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.040
you better take out, and if it’s a coat or anything, put it inside.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.840
Put it on your heart, press it a little bit

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:36.080
and say with full confidence,

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.120
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:45.360
Feel no hesitation in saying that — you are the Spirit!

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:52.680
You are not the body, mind, and this ego, you are the Spirit.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.160
Close your eyes, all of you, keep your eyes shut.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:01.040
Even if they’re not shutting, try to press them a little,

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.400
they’ll shut down.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.600
They must relax.

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.000
Don’t say mechanically. With full confidence, I said,

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.599
please say, “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:32.440
Now put down this hand on the left-hand side,

01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.160
on the left-hand side of your stomach.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.960
Now, this is very good for you

01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.680
because the principle of guru

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.560
resides in the stomach area.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:50.280
So you put your right hand on the stomach on the left-hand side

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:55.400
and press it a little bit with your fingers, fingertips.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.080
At this point you have to say ten times,

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.480
“Mother, I am my own guru.”

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.760
Again, with great confidence and understanding

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:07.000
and respect for yourself, with all your self-esteem:

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.160
“Mother, I am my own guru.”

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:18.120
Please put your left hand straight towards Me.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.400
Both the legs should be straight on the ground,

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:25.320
little apart from each other. Little apart from each other.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:30.560
It’s good.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.600
Now.

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.560
You raise your right hand now upward,

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.640
again to your heart position,

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.040
put it on your heart again.

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:47.000
And now twelve times you have to say,

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:53.200
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:02.040
Now put the same hand on the left-hand side of your neck.

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:05.080
Why don’t you do, is a good chance.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:08.040
Just try, just try, it will work out. Close your eyes.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.719
Be a little attentive, be little attentive.

01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:13.440
It will work out, it’s very simple.

01:21:13.640 --> 01:21:16.880
Right hand on the left-hand side of your neck,

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.720
on the left Vishuddhi, as we call it.

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.040
At this point, sixteen times you have to say,

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:24.920
“Mother, I am not guilty,”

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.599
because you have been feeling guilty for nothing at all.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.760
Sixteen times, there are sixteen sub-plexuses.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:35.320
You have to say sixteen times,

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:41.480
with full confidence: “Mother, I am not guilty.”

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:45.040
All right.

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:49.520
Now raise this right hand onto your forehead,

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.920
after saying sixteen times.

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:04.679
At this point, you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.440
Because you know this is the center of Christ,

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.440
and Lord Jesus Christ has given us a prayer

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:13.960
which is the mantra, which is the chanting of this center is,

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.480
so you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:19.400
Because if we do not forgive others,

01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:22.680
God is not going to forgive us.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.000
Without feeling guilty, you have to say,

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:37.480
“God, forgive us because we forgive all those

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.680
who have done harm to us.”

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.800
Without feeling guilty, again I’m saying,

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.320
without feeling guilty, with all confidence.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.560
The guilt is too much in you people.

01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:53.120
What is the guilt for, you see, what are you guilty of?

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:58.559
As I have said yesterday, God is the ocean of love,

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.760
ocean of forgiveness,

01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:06.080
ocean of compassion.

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:09.360
Trust Him.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:15.480
Not to feel guilty, and say that “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:18.960
Now put this hand on top of your head.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.480
On top of your head where it’s a fontanelle bone area,

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:27.280
which was a soft bone in your childhood — and try to press it.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.440
You’ll find a little heat coming out.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.800
Now raise the hand little higher, about four inches,

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.720
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming out.

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:46.519
If not, change the hand: put your right hand towards Me

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.760
and left hand on top of your head.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.000
Otherwise also you can do it.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:58.480
Again change over, again and again,

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:02.120
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming out.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.920
At this point, you have to ask for your realization.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:11.040
I cannot cross your freedom, so you have to say,

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:13.440
“Mother, I want my realization.”

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:17.680
“Mother, I want my realization”, “Please give me my realization” —

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.880
anything like that.

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:28.280
It’s all right.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:33.600
Now you may open your eyes

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:36.360
and put your hands like this, just like this.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:40.280
All of you put your hands and ask a question in your heart:

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:45.240
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.679
Is this the Brahma Shakti?

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:52.080
Is this the all-pervading Power of God?”

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:58.880
Great.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.680
The breeze you are feeling is not the breeze

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:06.600
from any air conditioner or anything, is the breeze.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.440
Now put down your hands and see for yourself.

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:17.240
Again I’ll tell you how to raise your own Kundalini.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:18.679
Please follow me.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.080
This will take about two minutes more,

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:24.920
but it will help you to establish yourself.

01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:30.080
We have left hand in front of the Kundalini, like this,

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:34.360
and you have to move the right hand up, forward,

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.760
lower, backward, like that, you have to move. Now, start it off.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.320
Keep your eyes open, start moving your Kundalini.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.360
Other way round, other way round. Other way round.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:48.160
Just see how I’m doing it.

01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:52.000
Now, take it up on your head. Take it up on your head,

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.720
stretch your hands up there and give it a twist,

01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.280
a nice twist, and give a knot to your Kundalini.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:00.360
Because your hands are now powerful,

01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.160
you are working through your hands. Now again start it.

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.719
Do it again, but do it properly;

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.560
you should do it this way, as I am saying it to you,

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:10.960
not the other way round.

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.440
Now take your hand up there, give it a twist again,

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.640
and give it one knot.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.320
For the third time, you have to give three knots

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.160
because of three powers. Let’s do it again please.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:28.080
Do it with full understanding that your hands are powerful,

01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.200
there is power flowing through your hands.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:33.759
Only thing that you want — that it should be established.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:36.960
Now, one …

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.520
it’s two …

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:42.760
it’s three.

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:47.400
Now see in your hands how do you feel.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.480
All right?

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:58.000
Those who came for the last two days definitely are feeling.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.240
Even the people who came yesterday might be feeling, most of them.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.120
Those who have come for the first time may not be,

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.559
but doesn’t matter, it is going to work out.

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.720
You are all going to come and see Me on Sunday.

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.360
I’ll be very happy to meet all of you.

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.360
Now, if you have any personal problems,

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:16.640
you can come and see Me just now.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.680
Thank you very much. But not for a long time.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.880
It’s already nine o’clock, so for about half an hour I’ll be here.

01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.720
Thank you very much. But when you come on Sunday,

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:31.680
please bring some sugar, salt, and oil with you.

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:33.360
And water.

01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.320
Not too much, little bit.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.280
But not so little also,

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:42.519
bring at least half a kilo, or a quarter of a kilo.

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:51.839
Just come along. You got it? May God bless you!

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.760
SEEKER: Thank You very much! I love You!

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.720
SHRI MATAJI: That’s your own! That’s your own,

01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:59.920
what is there to thank Me. It's your own, it's your own.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.120
Come along. Yes.
