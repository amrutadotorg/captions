00:04:29.955 --> 00:04:39.355
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:04:41.035 --> 00:04:48.355
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

00:04:48.515 --> 00:04:53.694
His power comes from his innocence.

00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:58.496
When we see small children we are automatically

00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:02.115
compelled towards them

00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:09.635
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:14.555
And very innocent they are,

00:05:15.835 --> 00:05:18.155
extremely innocent,

00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:24.675
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

00:05:24.835 --> 00:05:31.635
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:38.515
These days people have become extremely cunning,

00:05:38.675 --> 00:05:42.315
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

00:05:42.475 --> 00:05:45.875
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:49.915
who are innocent and simple.

00:05:50.075 --> 00:05:53.315
They can justify themselves always

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:58.395
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

00:05:58.555 --> 00:06:01.675
when everybody is so cunning.

00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:11.915
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

00:06:12.115 --> 00:06:15.235
which is very much punishable,

00:06:15.515 --> 00:06:21.075
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:25.075
which are physical, you can say.

00:06:25.435 --> 00:06:33.395
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:37.595
Also, they can have other troubles

00:06:37.755 --> 00:06:41.275
with their liver treatments and all that.

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:47.315
All this comes up. Then to punish them

00:06:47.475 --> 00:06:52.995
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:56.395
At this time, when you have these problems,

00:06:56.555 --> 00:06:59.795
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

00:06:59.955 --> 00:07:02.835
should worship Shri Ganesha.

00:07:03.075 --> 00:07:10.395
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:15.875
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:20.075
extra work, I should say, than normal.

00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:24.795
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

00:07:24.955 --> 00:07:29.235
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:36.715
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:39.515
One of the two things come up

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:43.835
and he does not know where he is going.

00:07:43.995 --> 00:07:50.035
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:54.675
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

00:07:54.835 --> 00:08:02.035
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:05.392
All these diseases of the right side

00:08:05.552 --> 00:08:09.955
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:15.915
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

00:08:16.915 --> 00:08:23.355
but there is a simple way to remember him

00:08:23.515 --> 00:08:28.915
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

00:08:29.075 --> 00:08:32.835
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:37.755
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:41.595
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:46.475
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:51.315
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

00:08:51.475 --> 00:08:56.275
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.955
and all the worries from you.

00:08:59.115 --> 00:09:03.035
So this is the most important deity we have.

00:09:03.195 --> 00:09:06.395
Though its a very simple deity.

00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:10.075
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

00:09:10.235 --> 00:09:13.435
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:22.115
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

00:09:22.275 --> 00:09:29.115
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

00:09:29.275 --> 00:09:31.995
So to steady down these

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:39.195
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

00:09:39.435 --> 00:09:46.395
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

00:09:46.595 --> 00:09:51.355
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

00:09:51.515 --> 00:09:55.515
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

00:09:55.675 --> 00:09:59.835
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

00:09:59.995 --> 00:10:05.235
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:07.355
he never said who it was.

00:10:07.515 --> 00:10:12.315
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

00:10:12.475 --> 00:10:18.915
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

00:10:19.075 --> 00:10:21.795
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:24.635
he used to go all out to fight it.

00:10:24.795 --> 00:10:26.755
Same is Shri Ganesha.

00:10:26.915 --> 00:10:31.835
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

00:10:31.995 --> 00:10:36.875
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

00:10:37.035 --> 00:10:40.195
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

00:10:40.355 --> 00:10:45.035
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

00:10:45.195 --> 00:10:49.475
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

00:10:49.635 --> 00:10:54.235
in different troubles and hurdles and also

00:10:54.395 --> 00:10:57.875
different type of very very difficult times.

00:10:58.035 --> 00:11:02.475
It is his style that he manages things so well

00:11:02.635 --> 00:11:05.315
because he is a Ganapati.

00:11:05.475 --> 00:11:11.435
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

00:11:11.595 --> 00:11:16.195
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

00:11:16.355 --> 00:11:24.355
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

00:11:24.515 --> 00:11:28.435
who report if there is any problem.

00:11:28.595 --> 00:11:32.715
They report to the brain that there is a problem

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:39.515
and on the sternum bone is the residence

00:11:39.675 --> 00:11:45.315
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

00:11:45.475 --> 00:11:54.315
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

00:11:54.475 --> 00:11:58.035
sternum bone starts vibrating

00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:04.675
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

00:12:04.835 --> 00:12:08.835
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

00:12:08.995 --> 00:12:13.955
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

00:12:14.115 --> 00:12:18.075
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

00:12:18.235 --> 00:12:22.195
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

00:12:22.355 --> 00:12:24.995
are helped by Ganas is not true.

00:12:25.155 --> 00:12:28.475
Also the people who are mentally upset,

00:12:28.635 --> 00:12:33.355
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

00:12:33.515 --> 00:12:38.635
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

00:12:38.795 --> 00:12:43.715
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

00:12:43.875 --> 00:12:50.355
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

00:12:50.515 --> 00:12:55.155
Now his parents start crying for Mother

00:12:55.315 --> 00:12:59.275
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:03.035
that they immediately rush to that place

00:13:03.195 --> 00:13:07.675
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:11.435
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

00:13:11.595 --> 00:13:18.235
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

00:13:18.395 --> 00:13:21.995
They are also small like him

00:13:22.155 --> 00:13:25.755
and they are very active and very alert.

00:13:25.915 --> 00:13:27.875
They never sleep.

00:13:28.035 --> 00:13:32.075
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:37.075
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

00:13:37.235 --> 00:13:43.395
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

00:13:44.155 --> 00:13:47.795
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

00:13:47.955 --> 00:13:52.115
For example there was a boy who got drowned

00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:58.515
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

00:13:58.675 --> 00:14:00.595
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

00:14:00.755 --> 00:14:03.315
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

00:14:03.475 --> 00:14:05.635
because there were children.

00:14:05.795 --> 00:14:08.355
So one boy fell down into that

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:11.715
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:13.835
Nobody knew he was there.

00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:19.515
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

00:14:19.675 --> 00:14:23.235
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:28.195
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:31.875
After that they got so frightened

00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:35.635
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

00:14:35.795 --> 00:14:38.315
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

00:14:38.475 --> 00:14:40.745
I didn’t know even the address.

00:14:40.905 --> 00:14:45.315
But I asked to telephone to this number,

00:14:45.475 --> 00:14:48.395
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:54.155
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

00:14:54.315 --> 00:14:57.395
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

00:14:57.555 --> 00:14:59.115
and he will be saved.

00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:01.275
Nobody had told me anything.

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:04.035
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:08.875
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

00:15:09.035 --> 00:15:12.915
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

00:15:13.075 --> 00:15:15.595
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

00:15:15.755 --> 00:15:18.635
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

00:15:18.795 --> 00:15:21.235
If there is one chance of his surviving,

00:15:21.395 --> 00:15:26.315
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

00:15:26.475 --> 00:15:29.435
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.515
So, like this, so many things happen

00:15:31.675 --> 00:15:37.635
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

00:15:37.795 --> 00:15:41.235
your blessings that this has happened.

00:15:41.395 --> 00:15:44.235
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

00:15:44.395 --> 00:15:46.835
but because of Shri Ganesha.

00:15:46.995 --> 00:15:49.475
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

00:15:49.635 --> 00:15:52.995
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

00:15:53.155 --> 00:15:58.995
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

00:15:59.155 --> 00:16:02.595
To him his Mother is everything.

00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:05.755
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

00:16:05.915 --> 00:16:11.435
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

00:16:11.595 --> 00:16:18.955
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

00:16:19.115 --> 00:16:23.715
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:29.275
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

00:16:29.435 --> 00:16:32.595
but His work is tremendous.

00:16:32.755 --> 00:16:37.475
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

00:16:37.635 --> 00:16:43.395
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

00:16:43.555 --> 00:16:47.235
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

00:16:47.395 --> 00:16:53.515
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

00:16:53.675 --> 00:16:58.195
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

00:16:58.355 --> 00:17:00.795
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:03.955
Its not only in women but also in men,

00:17:04.115 --> 00:17:07.275
he expects chastity to be present.

00:17:07.435 --> 00:17:12.635
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

00:17:12.795 --> 00:17:16.035
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

00:17:16.195 --> 00:17:22.115
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:26.435
of communicating with young women and young men

00:17:26.595 --> 00:17:29.355
and spoiling your chastity.

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:32.355
Even your eyes should be clean,

00:17:32.515 --> 00:17:35.035
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

00:17:35.195 --> 00:17:39.115
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:41.715
what mistakes you have committed

00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:48.715
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:54.155
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

00:17:54.315 --> 00:17:57.675
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

00:17:57.835 --> 00:18:02.075
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

00:18:02.235 --> 00:18:04.875
but that is a very important thing.

00:18:05.035 --> 00:18:10.195
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:11.915
We should be very chaste.

00:18:12.075 --> 00:18:16.115
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

00:18:16.275 --> 00:18:19.915
But religions have become so useless now,

00:18:20.075 --> 00:18:23.355
have become without any basis,

00:18:23.515 --> 00:18:34.035
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

00:18:34.195 --> 00:18:37.595
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

00:18:37.755 --> 00:18:41.955
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

00:18:42.115 --> 00:18:45.155
Actually the religions have failed completely

00:18:45.315 --> 00:18:50.155
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

00:18:50.315 --> 00:18:52.435
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

00:18:52.595 --> 00:18:55.795
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

00:18:55.955 --> 00:18:59.475
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

00:18:59.635 --> 00:19:06.315
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

00:19:06.475 --> 00:19:11.275
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:18.035
and where people are also having very bad morals.

00:19:18.195 --> 00:19:22.835
He creates problems for them. What happens that

00:19:22.995 --> 00:19:29.875
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

00:19:30.035 --> 00:19:32.419
Earthquake takes place in places where

00:19:32.579 --> 00:19:36.235
there is no respect of chastity,

00:19:36.395 --> 00:19:40.235
also where there are fundamentalist

00:19:40.395 --> 00:19:47.235
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:52.155
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

00:19:52.315 --> 00:19:54.595
So the Mother earth also understands.

00:19:54.755 --> 00:19:58.195
Now we have so many earthquakes,

00:19:58.355 --> 00:20:00.635
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

00:20:00.795 --> 00:20:03.795
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

00:20:03.955 --> 00:20:05.715
So he protects them.

00:20:05.875 --> 00:20:10.595
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

00:20:10.755 --> 00:20:12.795
he tries to destroy them,

00:20:12.955 --> 00:20:16.915
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

00:20:17.075 --> 00:20:27.835
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:30.715
he attracts people towards himself,

00:20:30.875 --> 00:20:35.715
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

00:20:35.875 --> 00:20:40.515
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

00:20:40.675 --> 00:20:46.195
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

00:20:46.355 --> 00:20:49.395
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

00:20:49.555 --> 00:20:53.115
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

00:20:53.275 --> 00:20:57.875
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

00:20:58.035 --> 00:21:01.595
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

00:21:01.755 --> 00:21:08.275
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

00:21:08.435 --> 00:21:13.195
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:17.755
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

00:21:17.915 --> 00:21:20.075
they go back to their own place.

00:21:20.235 --> 00:21:23.435
So going back to the same place is only possible

00:21:23.595 --> 00:21:26.435
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

00:21:26.595 --> 00:21:30.875
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

00:21:31.035 --> 00:21:34.995
also they are bound by their own qualities.

00:21:35.155 --> 00:21:40.035
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

00:21:40.195 --> 00:21:42.435
and a lion will be a lion.

00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:46.195
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

00:21:46.355 --> 00:21:48.475
So they could be anything, you can’t say

00:21:48.635 --> 00:21:52.515
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

00:21:52.675 --> 00:21:55.275
And once they become anything like that

00:21:55.435 --> 00:22:00.035
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

00:22:00.195 --> 00:22:02.595
when they are human beings.

00:22:02.755 --> 00:22:07.355
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

00:22:07.515 --> 00:22:12.435
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

00:22:12.595 --> 00:22:16.915
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

00:22:17.075 --> 00:22:21.915
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

00:22:22.075 --> 00:22:24.995
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

00:22:25.155 --> 00:22:29.595
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

00:22:29.755 --> 00:22:37.435
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

00:22:37.595 --> 00:22:39.635
Before the statue they dance

00:22:39.795 --> 00:22:46.195
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

00:22:46.355 --> 00:22:51.875
music from some very funny films or something.

00:22:52.035 --> 00:22:54.995
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

00:22:55.155 --> 00:22:59.275
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

00:22:59.435 --> 00:23:03.635
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

00:23:03.795 --> 00:23:06.075
and they were dancing before it.

00:23:06.235 --> 00:23:11.835
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

00:23:11.995 --> 00:23:16.275
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

00:23:16.435 --> 00:23:20.795
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

00:23:20.955 --> 00:23:24.435
At that time the earth moved

00:23:24.595 --> 00:23:34.195
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

00:23:34.355 --> 00:23:36.675
They all disappeared into earth.

00:23:36.835 --> 00:23:39.995
Apart from that there were many others also

00:23:40.155 --> 00:23:44.395
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

00:23:44.555 --> 00:23:48.235
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:55.995
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

00:23:56.155 --> 00:24:02.075
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

00:24:02.235 --> 00:24:07.355
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

00:24:07.515 --> 00:24:16.635
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

00:24:16.795 --> 00:24:21.755
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

00:24:22.075 --> 00:24:24.235
They were all right.

00:24:24.395 --> 00:24:29.355
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

00:24:29.515 --> 00:24:32.031
and this is how they saved the Ashram

00:24:32.191 --> 00:24:34.995
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

00:24:35.155 --> 00:24:39.395
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

00:24:39.555 --> 00:24:43.315
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

00:24:43.475 --> 00:24:45.955
So we must respect his Ganas,

00:24:46.115 --> 00:24:50.715
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

00:24:50.875 --> 00:24:52.915
they are acting within us.

00:24:53.075 --> 00:24:56.235
They see us what sort of person you are,

00:24:56.395 --> 00:25:01.155
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

00:25:01.315 --> 00:25:03.318
by your misbehavior

00:25:03.478 --> 00:25:07.755
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

00:25:07.915 --> 00:25:09.915
They give you a chance many a times.

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:17.555
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

00:25:17.715 --> 00:25:24.275
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

00:25:24.435 --> 00:25:28.355
I should say, calamity for you people.

00:25:28.515 --> 00:25:31.115
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

00:25:31.275 --> 00:25:34.515
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

00:25:34.675 --> 00:25:40.075
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

00:25:40.235 --> 00:25:43.275
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

00:25:43.435 --> 00:25:45.955
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

00:25:46.115 --> 00:25:52.515
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

00:25:52.675 --> 00:25:57.475
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

00:25:57.635 --> 00:26:00.355
so we are not at all helped by this.

00:26:00.515 --> 00:26:03.235
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:07.155
don’t do any worship of any idol

00:26:07.315 --> 00:26:11.035
because these idols have been created by human beings

00:26:11.195 --> 00:26:15.835
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

00:26:15.995 --> 00:26:18.315
They are not created by the mother earth

00:26:18.475 --> 00:26:21.234
but are copied by people

00:26:21.394 --> 00:26:24.875
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

00:26:25.035 --> 00:26:28.675
So that’s, how any idol you get,

00:26:28.835 --> 00:26:34.955
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

00:26:35.115 --> 00:26:38.315
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

00:26:38.475 --> 00:26:41.155
So whatever is not there,

00:26:41.315 --> 00:26:45.355
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

00:26:45.515 --> 00:26:48.955
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

00:26:49.115 --> 00:26:53.075
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

00:26:53.235 --> 00:26:56.475
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

00:26:56.635 --> 00:26:59.515
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

00:26:59.675 --> 00:27:04.315
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

00:27:04.475 --> 00:27:08.355
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

00:27:08.515 --> 00:27:14.835
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

00:27:14.995 --> 00:27:20.235
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

00:27:20.395 --> 00:27:24.515
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

00:27:24.675 --> 00:27:29.195
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

00:27:29.355 --> 00:27:34.115
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

00:27:34.275 --> 00:27:37.315
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

00:27:37.475 --> 00:27:40.515
and how he is doing this to us.”

00:27:40.675 --> 00:27:47.035
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:53.275
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

00:27:53.435 --> 00:27:54.795
And then he realized it.

00:27:54.955 --> 00:27:57.635
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

00:27:57.795 --> 00:28:03.075
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

00:28:03.235 --> 00:28:07.515
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

00:28:07.675 --> 00:28:10.195
and being very cunning and clever.

00:28:10.355 --> 00:28:14.915
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

00:28:15.075 --> 00:28:22.355
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

00:28:22.515 --> 00:28:27.875
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

00:28:28.035 --> 00:28:33.115
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

00:28:33.275 --> 00:28:36.395
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

00:28:36.555 --> 00:28:39.315
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

00:28:39.475 --> 00:28:45.715
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

00:28:45.875 --> 00:28:48.955
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

00:28:49.115 --> 00:28:54.635
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

00:28:54.795 --> 00:29:01.675
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

00:29:01.835 --> 00:29:10.075
that he can move mountains after mountains.

00:29:10.235 --> 00:29:16.635
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

00:29:16.795 --> 00:29:23.955
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

00:29:24.115 --> 00:29:27.235
can be changed.

00:29:28.155 --> 00:29:32.955
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

00:29:33.115 --> 00:29:35.195
of the right direction.

00:29:35.355 --> 00:29:41.235
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

00:29:41.395 --> 00:29:45.795
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

00:29:45.955 --> 00:29:49.315
it was the right type and he was successful.

00:29:49.475 --> 00:29:52.475
But then what happened, they had stencils

00:29:52.635 --> 00:29:55.235
and they started using it from the other side.

00:29:55.395 --> 00:29:58.515
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

00:29:58.675 --> 00:30:01.795
and then they were all destroyed.

00:30:01.955 --> 00:30:05.915
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

00:30:06.075 --> 00:30:08.163
Also we have proved now

00:30:08.323 --> 00:30:12.275
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

00:30:12.435 --> 00:30:15.995
is actually from the Carbon atom.

00:30:16.155 --> 00:30:18.715
The carbon atom has got Swastika

00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:25.675
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

00:30:25.835 --> 00:30:27.715
all put in series.

00:30:27.875 --> 00:30:33.035
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

00:30:33.195 --> 00:30:35.755
look at it from the left side to right side,

00:30:35.915 --> 00:30:39.755
what you see is Omkar.

00:30:39.915 --> 00:30:42.555
If you see it from right side to left side,

00:30:42.715 --> 00:30:44.315
you see the Swastika,

00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:51.195
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

00:30:51.355 --> 00:30:56.555
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

00:30:56.715 --> 00:31:01.395
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

00:31:01.555 --> 00:31:04.995
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:09.075
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

00:31:09.235 --> 00:31:12.395
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

00:31:12.555 --> 00:31:17.155
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

00:31:17.315 --> 00:31:21.355
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

00:31:21.515 --> 00:31:23.115
because we are confused.

00:31:23.275 --> 00:31:25.395
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

00:31:25.555 --> 00:31:27.435
that this is already written there.

00:31:27.595 --> 00:31:33.035
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

00:31:33.195 --> 00:31:40.435
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

00:31:40.595 --> 00:31:46.715
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

00:31:46.875 --> 00:31:49.715
All the things I have told you about Christ,

00:31:49.875 --> 00:31:56.195
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

00:31:56.355 --> 00:31:59.355
Like Christ had these two fingers,

00:31:59.515 --> 00:32:03.835
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

00:32:03.995 --> 00:32:08.475
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:12.355
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

00:32:12.515 --> 00:32:16.035
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

00:32:16.195 --> 00:32:18.795
only these two fingers why did he use.

00:32:18.955 --> 00:32:21.620
Pointing out towards his father

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.695
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

00:32:26.035 --> 00:32:29.275
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

00:32:29.435 --> 00:32:32.755
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

00:32:32.915 --> 00:32:39.595
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

00:32:39.755 --> 00:32:45.155
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

00:32:45.315 --> 00:32:49.315
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

00:32:49.475 --> 00:32:51.251
So it all opens out

00:32:51.411 --> 00:32:56.827
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

00:32:56.995 --> 00:33:00.955
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

00:33:01.115 --> 00:33:06.235
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

00:33:06.395 --> 00:33:10.395
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:12.355
You are no more cunning.

00:33:12.515 --> 00:33:19.075
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

00:33:19.235 --> 00:33:24.315
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

00:33:24.475 --> 00:33:29.475
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

00:33:29.635 --> 00:33:36.435
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

00:33:36.595 --> 00:33:41.315
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

00:33:41.475 --> 00:33:45.675
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

00:33:45.835 --> 00:33:48.875
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:55.086
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

00:33:55.246 --> 00:33:59.006
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:02.595
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

00:34:02.755 --> 00:34:04.755
We don’t look after the mother earth.

00:34:04.915 --> 00:34:08.235
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

00:34:08.395 --> 00:34:12.355
Actually in Indian culture it is that

00:34:12.515 --> 00:34:15.515
when you are getting up in the morning,

00:34:15.675 --> 00:34:20.595
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

00:34:20.755 --> 00:34:25.035
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

00:34:25.195 --> 00:34:28.275
because I am touching you with my feet.

00:34:28.435 --> 00:34:30.755
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

00:34:30.915 --> 00:34:32.635
then you won’t exploit it,

00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:36.395
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

00:34:36.555 --> 00:34:39.395
It all comes out of our ignorance

00:34:39.555 --> 00:34:43.955
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

00:34:44.115 --> 00:34:47.795
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

00:34:47.955 --> 00:34:52.435
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

00:34:52.595 --> 00:34:55.515
what is to be done.

00:34:55.675 --> 00:34:58.595
The mother earth itself we should look after,

00:34:58.755 --> 00:35:02.355
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

00:35:02.515 --> 00:35:04.755
we can do all kinds of things

00:35:04.915 --> 00:35:10.435
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

00:35:10.595 --> 00:35:15.275
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

00:35:15.435 --> 00:35:18.515
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

00:35:18.675 --> 00:35:23.235
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

00:35:23.395 --> 00:35:25.275
is a very wrong thing.

00:35:25.435 --> 00:35:29.035
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

00:35:29.195 --> 00:35:31.195
you should put another one there.

00:35:31.355 --> 00:35:34.715
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

00:35:34.875 --> 00:35:39.315
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

00:35:39.475 --> 00:35:46.915
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

00:35:47.075 --> 00:35:50.275
I don’t know how they live but they do

00:35:50.435 --> 00:35:56.435
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

00:35:56.595 --> 00:36:00.475
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

00:36:00.635 --> 00:36:06.515
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

00:36:06.675 --> 00:36:09.675
that it should get the sunrays.

00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:11.395
There is no quarrel about it.

00:36:11.555 --> 00:36:15.195
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

00:36:15.355 --> 00:36:20.475
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

00:36:20.635 --> 00:36:22.835
The animals also don’t destroy,

00:36:22.995 --> 00:36:26.035
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

00:36:26.195 --> 00:36:29.875
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

00:36:30.035 --> 00:36:32.515
do not destroy anything

00:36:32.675 --> 00:36:38.555
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

00:36:38.715 --> 00:36:41.835
Whatever may be the cry for this,

00:36:41.995 --> 00:36:45.755
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

00:36:45.915 --> 00:36:48.755
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

00:36:48.915 --> 00:36:52.875
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

00:36:53.035 --> 00:36:57.875
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

00:36:58.035 --> 00:37:00.435
He is the greatest yogi we have

00:37:00.595 --> 00:37:04.035
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

00:37:04.195 --> 00:37:10.315
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

00:37:10.475 --> 00:37:18.835
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

00:37:18.995 --> 00:37:21.715
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

00:37:21.875 --> 00:37:23.835
and we should really worship him.

00:37:23.995 --> 00:37:26.645
Through him all deities are worshiped

00:37:26.805 --> 00:37:34.035
and are made happy and blissful.

00:37:34.195 --> 00:37:39.675
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

00:37:39.835 --> 00:37:44.955
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

00:37:45.115 --> 00:37:56.235
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

00:37:56.395 --> 00:38:00.875
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

00:38:01.035 --> 00:38:04.035
but you are dishonoring yourself

00:38:04.195 --> 00:38:07.635
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

00:38:07.795 --> 00:38:13.475
by becoming so sinful.

00:38:13.635 --> 00:38:17.115
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

00:38:17.275 --> 00:38:23.515
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

00:38:23.675 --> 00:38:27.155
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

00:38:27.315 --> 00:38:30.835
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

00:38:30.995 --> 00:38:34.915
Decency is very important in understanding,

00:38:35.075 --> 00:38:41.075
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

00:38:41.235 --> 00:38:47.595
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

00:38:47.755 --> 00:38:51.835
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

00:38:51.995 --> 00:38:55.755
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

00:38:55.915 --> 00:39:00.153
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

00:39:00.313 --> 00:39:03.988
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

00:39:04.148 --> 00:39:09.924
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

00:39:10.084 --> 00:39:14.475
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

00:39:14.635 --> 00:39:19.378
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

00:39:19.538 --> 00:39:21.766
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

00:39:21.926 --> 00:39:24.388
because men can develop so many diseases

00:39:24.548 --> 00:39:28.196
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

00:39:29.037 --> 00:39:36.092
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

00:39:36.252 --> 00:39:39.451
because he is all the time repairing our body.

00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:43.296
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

00:39:43.456 --> 00:39:49.307
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

00:39:49.467 --> 00:39:52.220
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.755
he is protecting our Kundalini.

00:39:54.915 --> 00:40:01.494
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

00:40:01.654 --> 00:40:07.252
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

00:40:07.412 --> 00:40:11.696
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

00:40:11.856 --> 00:40:15.875
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

00:40:16.035 --> 00:40:22.896
which is also a basis of your self realization.

00:40:23.056 --> 00:40:26.494
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

00:40:26.654 --> 00:40:29.431
and you should find out about yourself,

00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:34.210
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.755
If we are; what are we doing about it?

00:40:36.915 --> 00:40:43.096
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

00:40:43.256 --> 00:40:46.018
You will not like them, will not like such people.

00:40:46.178 --> 00:40:49.300
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.374
The children are the best as we know.

00:40:52.534 --> 00:40:59.961
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

00:41:00.121 --> 00:41:04.336
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

00:41:04.496 --> 00:41:07.831
He is the one who is really innocent

00:41:07.991 --> 00:41:12.239
but extremely, protective of you,

00:41:12.399 --> 00:41:15.873
very much protective, with his innocence.

00:41:16.033 --> 00:41:18.609
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

00:41:18.769 --> 00:41:22.515
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

00:41:22.675 --> 00:41:25.359
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

00:41:25.519 --> 00:41:28.809
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:34.030
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.355
people are talking about it that

00:41:36.515 --> 00:41:40.579
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:43.934
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

00:41:44.094 --> 00:41:50.875
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

00:41:51.035 --> 00:41:55.593
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

00:41:55.753 --> 00:41:59.403
In America, I was surprised to see that

00:41:59.563 --> 00:42:02.315
there were so many Red Indians,

00:42:02.475 --> 00:42:06.315
who are called as Indian Americans.

00:42:06.475 --> 00:42:11.602
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

00:42:11.762 --> 00:42:15.913
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

00:42:16.073 --> 00:42:18.715
I found the vibrations were so good.

00:42:18.875 --> 00:42:21.515
That means they were very innocent, simple people

00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:24.694
and Americans that time, who went there,

00:42:24.854 --> 00:42:27.715
tried to completely finish them.

00:42:27.875 --> 00:42:31.204
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

00:42:31.364 --> 00:42:34.955
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

00:42:35.115 --> 00:42:37.965
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

00:42:38.125 --> 00:42:41.835
still the people who live there or worked about

00:42:41.995 --> 00:42:47.136
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

00:42:47.296 --> 00:42:51.869
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

00:42:52.029 --> 00:42:54.204
But they are so simple and innocent

00:42:54.364 --> 00:42:57.315
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

00:42:57.475 --> 00:43:00.115
because they used to worship the Mother.

00:43:00.275 --> 00:43:02.915
All the time they worship the Mother.

00:43:03.075 --> 00:43:06.675
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

00:43:06.835 --> 00:43:11.935
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

00:43:12.095 --> 00:43:14.895
They have many Maoris and all those people

00:43:15.055 --> 00:43:16.775
and they encourage all of them

00:43:16.935 --> 00:43:20.775
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

00:43:20.935 --> 00:43:28.018
and they are bringing them to this state to show

00:43:28.184 --> 00:43:32.891
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

00:43:33.051 --> 00:43:35.255
Its a very good venture.

00:43:35.415 --> 00:43:42.135
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

00:43:42.295 --> 00:43:46.954
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

00:43:47.114 --> 00:43:52.033
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

00:43:52.193 --> 00:43:56.295
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

00:43:56.455 --> 00:43:57.695
from the mother earth.

00:43:57.855 --> 00:44:01.615
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

00:44:01.775 --> 00:44:08.935
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

00:44:09.095 --> 00:44:10.731
That’s what it is.

00:44:10.891 --> 00:44:15.571
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

00:44:15.731 --> 00:44:19.295
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

00:44:19.455 --> 00:44:21.796
and Government also has never troubled us

00:44:21.956 --> 00:44:24.411
or there has been no problem with them.

00:44:24.571 --> 00:44:27.116
I don’t know what’s this helping them

00:44:27.276 --> 00:44:31.636
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

00:44:31.796 --> 00:44:36.085
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

00:44:36.245 --> 00:44:40.136
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

00:44:40.296 --> 00:44:42.386
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:46.790
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.074
You will be helped, miraculously

00:44:49.234 --> 00:44:54.445
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

00:44:54.643 --> 00:44:56.468
May God Bless You.
