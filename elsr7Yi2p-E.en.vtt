00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.118
They didn't talk of Kundalini.

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:13.274
That is the only trouble.

00:00:15.893 --> 00:00:18.931
And they all, that time they were all fighting.

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:23.204
Because of that fighting nature

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.415
nobody had the patience

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:32.062
to tell them," Baba! you don't fight now."

00:00:34.227 --> 00:00:36.863
because when there is fight going on

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:39.689
you can't talk to them

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:45.256
But with Sahaj yoga

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.401
and there was no fighting.

00:00:47.602 --> 00:00:48.896
A child saying something (NOT CLEAR)

00:00:49.097 --> 00:00:52.551
Sahaj yoga has given you a complete

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:54.393
freedom

00:00:55.101 --> 00:01:00.435
but as Sahaja is complete (INAUDIBLE)

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.988
INAUDIBLE

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:05.798
(Shri Mataji telling to a child) ,"Come here."

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.061
Come here!

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.514
Baba! Please come!

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:18.111
INAUDIBLE

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.644
That means nobody talked about Kundalini

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.920
All of them

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.520
talked about Self Realisation.

00:01:46.012 --> 00:01:47.012
(NOT CLEAR)

00:01:50.538 --> 00:01:51.538
within you

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:55.538
settles

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.443
Kundalini

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.305
None of them talked about kundalini.

00:02:06.748 --> 00:02:11.230
A child saying something ....INAUDIBLE

00:02:17.214 --> 00:02:19.545
There have been

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:22.328
very great

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:25.911
Spirits

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:29.367
At that time

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:31.987
everybody was quarrelling.

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:34.997
Nobody was listening.

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:42.006
They were all fighting.

00:02:47.017 --> 00:02:48.017
get a ......

00:02:50.013 --> 00:02:51.568
So they never talked about

00:02:52.643 --> 00:02:55.125
basic in the Kundalini.

00:02:58.948 --> 00:03:00.890
See the trouble.

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:04.498
and there we

00:03:06.017 --> 00:03:07.017
...........

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:10.941
all of this

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:13.482
they were

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:17.033
not friendly with each other.

00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:27.671
that (NOT CLEAR)

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:35.613
and they didn't talk of kundalini and self realisation.

00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:42.218
They were all very

00:03:43.681 --> 00:03:45.149
evident

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:48.977
but because of this

00:03:52.328 --> 00:03:53.328
gap

00:03:57.393 --> 00:03:59.064
the problem

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:03.140
became wider and wider.

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:14.485
None of them talked of kundalini

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:17.026
Can you imagine!

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:23.664
They say it is

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:27.882
Some mentioned about it in Sanskrit language.

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:29.961
But I have not seen.

00:04:30.162 --> 00:04:31.572
Have you seen?

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.423
So they all knew

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400
the same thing

00:04:42.343 --> 00:04:43.746
but they didn't say.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:45.834
So

00:04:47.243 --> 00:04:50.741
so many got separated

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:55.699
and there was

00:04:56.971 --> 00:04:58.100
a big (rift) within

00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:01.856
each other.

00:05:05.957 --> 00:05:08.290
Because the truth was, there is a Kundalini

00:05:12.782 --> 00:05:15.377
And this was not said critically.

00:05:47.796 --> 00:05:49.060
Please look out.

00:05:52.727 --> 00:05:56.846
we will tie up that

00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:11.935
NOT CLEAR

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:21.250

Shri Mataji laughing

00:07:15.097 --> 00:07:17.691
and these grown ups

00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:20.512
they

00:07:21.481 --> 00:07:24.754
always stand first in their class.

00:07:24.907 --> 00:07:26.859
And it is a very well known school.

00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:31.622
But he always stands first.

00:07:32.172 --> 00:07:36.817
But one thing is, he come rarely and so............

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:59.829

00:23:25.875 --> 00:23:26.925
Sir C. P,"Russia."

00:23:28.011 --> 00:23:30.026
Shri Mataji,"After that Russia."

00:23:30.227 --> 00:23:32.499
Sir C.P,"Russians are very very keen."

00:23:32.843 --> 00:23:35.855
Sir C.P repeating,"Russians are very very keen."

00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:40.167
Shri Mataji,"So what WE have to do?"

00:23:40.368 --> 00:23:42.832
Sir C.P,"Russians are very very keen.They want very much."

00:23:42.866 --> 00:23:45.181
Sir C.P," They have been praying to you to come to Russia."

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:50.916
Shri Mataji,"Yea! Yes Russians are!

00:23:51.117 --> 00:23:55.592
Russians are extremely keen, very keen.

00:23:57.334 --> 00:23:58.450
And

00:24:01.015 --> 00:24:02.579
they are great Sahaj yogis.

00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:06.381
Now what is happening

00:24:07.536 --> 00:24:10.324
It is a .........nation there.

00:24:12.064 --> 00:24:14.942
They want to work out

00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:20.317
and have a way, not Communism.

00:24:22.404 --> 00:24:28.738
But I told them that now your communism is internal.

00:24:29.024 --> 00:24:31.487
So every part it................

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.302
They are all communists.

00:24:36.897 --> 00:24:39.561
But now the thing is

00:24:39.762 --> 00:24:44.082
It has to bring sahajyog

00:24:44.283 --> 00:24:46.409
After communism

00:24:47.044 --> 00:24:48.466
They have to bring

00:24:49.537 --> 00:24:51.002
Sahajyog

00:24:52.878 --> 00:24:55.378
because in communism

00:24:56.167 --> 00:24:59.431
if there are some extraordinary people

00:25:00.437 --> 00:25:02.480
extra sensory people

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:05.060
you cannot

00:25:08.479 --> 00:25:09.936
they cannot come up.

00:25:12.698 --> 00:25:15.122
but after

00:25:17.018 --> 00:25:19.563
they seek, they take to Sahaj yoga

00:25:20.358 --> 00:25:23.338
Then all such people who are...........

00:25:26.493 --> 00:25:35.077
In every country there are very remarkable people and very talented

00:25:36.297 --> 00:25:40.119
and great understanding

00:25:41.108 --> 00:25:42.108
Every country

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:45.250
but the only thing is

00:25:46.947 --> 00:25:47.947
I have to

00:25:49.266 --> 00:25:50.741
 meet all of them

00:25:52.068 --> 00:25:54.391
and I have to go to all these countries.

00:25:56.394 --> 00:25:58.734
So, now the only thing is that

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.846
I cannot go to all the countries

00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:06.905
but I can go to two countries at least.

00:26:18.628 --> 00:26:23.285
Sir C. P," President of Russia,  President of Russia, met me there

00:26:24.317 --> 00:26:26.974
taken self realization from Sahajyogis."

00:26:27.657 --> 00:26:28.657
Shri Mataji,"There".

00:26:29.204 --> 00:26:34.368
End is Russia. First I will go to Canada.

00:26:35.515 --> 00:26:40.654
Canadians have been trying but somehow, I could not go.

00:26:41.501 --> 00:26:43.947
Canada is far away.

00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:45.975
So,

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.092
I couldn't do that. But now I have to go to Canada.

00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:55.197
And then to Russia.

00:26:57.725 --> 00:26:58.725
That I cannot........

00:27:00.281 --> 00:27:04.244
But, there is some work here

00:27:05.398 --> 00:27:06.398
that has to be done.

00:27:13.397 --> 00:27:14.703
Now

00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:17.951
it is the work of ..............

00:27:18.927 --> 00:27:19.927
................

00:27:29.966 --> 00:27:31.985
Why did you sit at the back?

00:27:44.841 --> 00:27:45.841
Is it okay?

00:27:47.027 --> 00:27:48.027
Here.......INAUDIBLE

00:28:00.579 --> 00:28:03.382
She is a great organiser.

00:28:03.583 --> 00:28:05.825
Sir C.P:" Musician."

00:28:13.082 --> 00:28:15.232
Shri Mataji: "She is very good at music.

00:28:16.123 --> 00:28:19.795
and she writes poems.

00:28:21.385 --> 00:28:23.855
and she gives tunes for........

00:28:25.772 --> 00:28:26.772
She is very capable

00:28:29.059 --> 00:28:35.800
We have all kinds of experts

00:28:37.047 --> 00:28:39.318
and

00:28:40.113 --> 00:28:46.055
I know, they will come up and spread Sahajyoga.

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:51.395
They can.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.168
Now there won't be any mistake.

00:28:58.844 --> 00:29:00.718
You will

00:29:00.919 --> 00:29:04.761
should not say much about Sahajyoga.

00:29:05.653 --> 00:29:08.187
In a way, he has spoken

00:29:08.937 --> 00:29:10.742
but nothing is clear.

00:29:12.726 --> 00:29:19.878
But now, you are clear about it and you know what is Sahaj

00:29:21.403 --> 00:29:24.183
And how it can help the whole world.

00:29:25.171 --> 00:29:28.982
can solve the problems of the whole world.

00:29:34.739 --> 00:29:37.435
Of course whatever your problem you have,

00:29:37.635 --> 00:29:40.330
please write it down and give it to ME

00:29:41.591 --> 00:29:44.070
I would like to attend  to it.

00:29:53.932 --> 00:29:58.359
Now will have to come to Delhi, specially will have to come

00:29:59.168 --> 00:30:01.235
that they should spread Sahajyoga.

00:30:12.411 --> 00:30:13.411
It has spread

00:30:14.877 --> 00:30:16.363
but they have to spread all the more.

00:30:18.173 --> 00:30:20.287
It has spread.

00:30:21.139 --> 00:30:23.443
There are so many Sahajyogis

00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:25.491
