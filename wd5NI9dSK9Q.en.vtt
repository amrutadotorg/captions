First Public Program
Melbourne, Australia

00:03:11.230 --> 00:05:17.760
11 April 1991

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:53.320
Please be seated.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:01.210
I think I’ll stand up and speak, would be
better now.

00:27:09.721 --> 00:27:12.911
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:27:21.569 --> 00:27:29.940
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:44.949
We cannot conceptualize it, we cannot change
it, we cannot buy it, and also unfortunately

00:27:44.949 --> 00:27:46.850
at this human level we cannot know it.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:28:09.860
The truth is that you are not this body, this
mind, this intellect, this ego, these conditionings,

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:16.190
but you are the pure spirit.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:30.850
The second truth is that there is a all-pervading
Power of divine love, which is very subtle

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.509
and which works out all the living work.

00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:40.300
You see all these beautiful flowers here,
and we take them for granted.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:45.020
We never even think from where have they come,
how have they come, from a one little seed

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:57.860
how – and so many varieties, so many types
– how they have been created and how they

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:03.350
grow, and how a flower becomes a fruit.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:06.050
Look at ourselves; look at our eyes.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:09.910
It’s one of the greatest cameras you could
think of.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:16.150
Look at every machinery that is within us,
how it is working beautifully there.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:22.430
But we do not think about it; we take it for
granted.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:29.000
All this living work is done by this all-pervading
Power of divine love.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.980
Now when I say that, you need not accept it
blindfolded.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:43.519
But I would request you to have a scientific
mind, have a scientific attitude that you

00:29:43.519 --> 00:29:45.809
keep yourself open.

00:29:45.809 --> 00:29:57.050
Treat this as a hypothesis, and if it is proved
then you have to accept it as truth, if you

00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:09.150
are honest, because it is not only for individual
emancipation but for the emancipation of the

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:14.190
whole world.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:30.430
As I have told you that truth cannot be understood
or felt at this human level because we are

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:37.010
mental, at the most, if not emotional being,
or we are mixture of both.

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:43.660
We are a bundle of conditionings and egos
and everything, but we are not our selves.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:50.240
When we say “my ego”, “my intelligence”,
“my body” – but where is this “my”?

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.140
From where does this word “my” comes?

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:56.840
This is what is the spirit within us.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:12.640
You have been already explained about a mechanism
we have here … and you have been already

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:22.190
told this kind of a mechanism exists within
us.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:27.390
(If you remove this one would be better, I
think.)

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:38.120
Now this mechanism does exist within us, and
is for your last breakthrough in your evolutionary

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.470
process.

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:48.900
You have become from amoeba to a human state,
but we have not yet known the absolute truth.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:56.380
We have not yet known the absolute knowledge.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.919
[Microphone falls down.]

00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:14.850
All right, now can you see that?

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:24.570
It’s just for your seeing we are managing
something!

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.510
It’s all right.

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:35.950
But this is all within yourself, is all within
yourself which is not going to fall out!

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:52.740
So, we have this mechanism, as I told you,
for your last breakthrough.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:58.890
If we had known the absolute truth and if
we had the absolute knowledge, there would

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:09.240
have been no quarrelling, no different “isms”;
there would have been no wars.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:17.640
But because we haven’t got that, we are
separated by ignorance, and everybody thinks

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.240
“I’m right.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:26.120
Whatever I am doing is the correct thing and
whatever I am thinking is the correct thing.”

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:31.000
But there is no way to judge whether it is
correct or not.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.990
Like when you say it’s a one meter long,
then we have a meter, as you know, in the

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:47.820
Museum of Paris which is kept as one meter
all the time.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:56.520
But that, unless and until you discover we
are living in a relative world without any

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.760
absolute relativity.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:04.470
That’s why there is chaos; that’s why
there are problems.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:14.350
Most of the problems if you see are created
by human beings.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:22.400
These problems, if you just try to locate,
are just based because we haven’t found

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.460
out the absolute knowledge.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:30.990
For example, if this place is completely dark
and you can’t see anyone and if you start

00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:37.700
all running, you’ll hit someone, somebody
will fall down, somebody will be beaten up,

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:45.760
somebody might get hurt because there is darkness,
there is confusion.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:51.150
These are the days of the greatest confusion
that we are born in, and it’s promised that

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:55.330
in those days of confusion only you are going
to find out the truth.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:35:02.470
That’s why there is a category of people,
as William Blake has said, are the men of

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:10.660
God who will find themselves and they will
make others the men of God.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:18.990
The time has come for you all to have your
Self-realization, your self-knowledge.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:23.950
As a result of that you develop a new awareness.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:31.100
You develop – again I say it’s a question
of becoming; it is not certifying – you

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:39.530
develop a new awareness on your central nervous
system, which we call as “collective consciousness.”

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:43.800
Is described by Jung very clearly.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:53.770
This is where you can feel your centers on
your fingertips, and you can feel the centers

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:56.360
of other people on your fingertips.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:03.860
Now only thing you have to do is to know what
do they denote – this decoding has been

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:08.300
done already – and how to correct them.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:16.020
So, to correct your being physically, mentally,
emotionally and also spiritually, you have

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.140
to enter inside your being – which you cannot.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:26.710
For example, you are paying attention to Me,
but if I say “pay attention to yourself”

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:27.740
you cannot.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.740
You cannot pay attention to yourself inside.

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:36.159
So something has to happen, and this something
is the awakening of this residual power which

00:36:36.159 --> 00:36:38.020
we call as “kundalini.”

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:46.490
It’s a Sanskrit word: “kundal” means
“the coils” and is there in three-and-a-half

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:50.029
coils, this energy is settled down.

00:36:50.029 --> 00:36:59.010
If this energy is awakened, just like a primule
in a seed – it’s a living process – just

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:08.490
like a seed sprouts, this kundalini gets awakened,
passes through six centers, pierces through

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:14.850
the last one, and you yourself feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:20.310
And then for the first time you start feeling
this cool breeze – it’s not very cool,

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:28.560
it’s very pleasantly cool – which is the
all-pervading Power of divine love.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:34.710
With this you become like a divine computer.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:41.820
You can feel the centers which are in trouble
within yourself.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.120
You can feel the centers of people around.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:51.950
You can feel the centers of people who are
far away, also the centers of people who are

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.070
dead and gone.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:58.740
That’s how you can know who was a realized
soul who came on this Earth, and who was a

00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:03.180
nasty fellow and who was a devil.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.010
Otherwise there is no way of making out.

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:12.580
For example, from India people get out of
the jail, immediately they wear these saffron-colored

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:18.710
clothes and are in Australia: they become
big gurus.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:23.830
And Australians had lot of money, and they
have really fed them with that.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.130
So many of them are coming down.

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:33.750
But not so many, because so many are exposed
also, so many are in jail, so many have died.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:37.909
But still, they can say that “the world
is coming to an end, and you must do this.

00:38:37.909 --> 00:38:41.790
This is happening, and you must do that”;
and just frighten you.

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.480
And you think, “Oh, otherwise, you see,
how can they tell lies?”

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.080
But they are thieves!

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:53.560
They are coming from the jail direct – you
find out their bona fides: from what kind

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:58.000
of families they come, what sort of education
they have had?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.770
But blindfolded, people go to them and get
infected by them.

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:08.460
Mostly they are mesmerizers and they spoil
your chances of your ascent.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:14.200
Not only that: they can give you some diseases,
they can give you some sort of a brain – you

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.380
might have an effect of your taking a drug.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.060
Anything can they do, I don’t know to what
extent they can go; because so many have come

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:27.560
to Me, and I am really now fed up the way
people are still running after them, paying

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.560
them money.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.770
It’s something like you see some people
coming out of the pub and falling down on

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:40.310
the street, and others try to push their way
inside to get again the same way.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:44.240
But in spirituality you have to know that
you cannot pay.

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:50.970
It’s a living process of living energy;
it’s a living process.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:55.070
(Will you take photographs afterwards?

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:58.510
All right?)

00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:05.181
So the second thing that should happen to
you as a result of Self-realization, that

00:40:05.181 --> 00:40:09.640
you get empowered yourself.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.850
You yourself can give realizations to others.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:20.970
You can find out about another person, you
can give them realization, you can cure them.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.980
You can help them in every way possible.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:29.210
It’s like one enlightened light can enlighten
another light.

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:33.720
You are all ready for it, absolutely ready
to get enlightened.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:40.840
I don’t have to do much, you will see that
– how easily you all can get your realization.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:46.630
It has to be easy, it has to be sahaj, it
has to be spontaneous, because the time has

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.630
come.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:54.140
And also this all-pervading Power has become
extremely active, extremely active, and it

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:56.380
is working wonders everywhere.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:06.930
When the kundalini rises on this center, then
you reach a state which we call as thoughtless

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:10.110
awareness – in Sanskrit it’s called as
“nirvichar samadhi.”

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:14.019
When you watch something you just watch, you
don’t think.

00:41:14.019 --> 00:41:17.990
If you want to think you can think, but you
are not bombarded by thoughts, you are not

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.820
under the control of thoughts.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:27.020
Then she rises above and pierces through here,
and establishes a connection properly: then

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:32.419
you get into another kind of a higher awareness
we call as “nirvikalpa samadhi”, which

00:41:32.419 --> 00:41:40.150
is a doubtless awareness, in which you start
raising the kundalini of others, curing others,

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:46.190
helping others, knowing such a lot of knowledge;
because once this kundalini goes into the

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:54.170
limbic area, she enlightens these thousand
petals there – that is the thousand nerves.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:42:02.300
Many children I’ve seen who have been absolutely
very dull children now are scoring above everybody

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:04.640
else, getting scholarships.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:13.789
We have some boys who have done their engineering
or chartered accountancy and all this thing

00:42:13.789 --> 00:42:16.370
in very, very record time; they have records.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:24.560
They always stand first and they are doing
very well in their education, but despite

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.019
all that they are extremely humble and obedient.

00:42:28.019 --> 00:42:34.590
They respect their teachers, they respect
everyone; because the new virtue which has

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:41.460
come in them is the respect, to respect others,
which we have lost long time back.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:48.110
The second thing that happens to a person
is this: that you become absolutely free.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:52.200
Of course, in the beginning also I respect
your freedom.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.419
I cannot force Self-realization on you – you
have to ask for it.

00:42:56.419 --> 00:43:00.230
Otherwise, I cannot force it on you.

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:06.340
But when you get your Self-realization you
become really free, in the sense that you

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.100
are able to be free.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:16.480
Like we think we are free, but we have addictions,
we are slaves to so many things, we cannot

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:19.200
control ourselves; so we are not free.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:25.320
But when you become a self-realized person
all such things which dominate us – whether

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:32.789
it’s addiction, alcoholism, any habit, any
such thing, tempers, or too much interest

00:43:32.789 --> 00:43:42.039
in wrong things – all drops out and you
become really a able person: absolutely you

00:43:42.039 --> 00:43:49.210
have the ability to be enjoying your freedom
and your virtues.

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:59.730
Then it happens that you start seeing everything,
as I told you, and not getting into thoughts.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:05.710
The human nature is such that whatever you
see, you react.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:11.620
But after getting Self-realization you do
not react, and your mind is thoughtless.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:22.750
It’s like a lake which has no ripples on
it, and all that is created around that lake

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:23.750
is reflected inside.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.830
In the same way when you watch something,
you just watch it.

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:32.659
Now I watch these flowers: I’m just watching,
and all the joy that the Creator has put it

00:44:32.659 --> 00:44:38.480
in it, it doesn’t come to Me as words but
as joy itself, and it starts pouring on Me

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.700
and it soothes Me down.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:48.399
You become a person without tension, because
tension comes to you through thoughts.

00:44:48.399 --> 00:44:52.990
But thoughts are coming from the past or from
the future, and they throng your head and

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:57.230
give you this tension.

00:44:57.230 --> 00:45:05.630
When the kundalini rises she comes in between
two thoughts, so the future and past – the

00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:09.389
kundalini is in the center, that is, in the
present.

00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:14.990
So you just stand in the present, and when
you are in the present there is no tension

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.940
in your mind.

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:22.820
These days there’s a big trouble people
are having of tensions, blood pressures and

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:29.550
all kinds of things, which are absolutely
there because this window has not yet opened

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:30.550
out.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:34.740
Once it has opened out everything goes away,
and you are extremely a relaxed person.

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:37.992
You also reduce at least ten years of your
age.

00:45:37.992 --> 00:45:43.450
As you know, I am sixty-eight years of age
and I am travelling every third or fourth

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:45.380
day all over the world.

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:49.450
So you get very dynamic and you get such a
lot of energy within you.

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:57.680
At the same time you are very compassionate,
you are very considerate, and you are extremely

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:58.680
wise.

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:04.649
In every way you are helped: you are helped
in your business, you are helped in your work,

00:46:04.649 --> 00:46:06.820
you are helped in your relationship with,
in your family, with others, and the whole

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:10.230
thing becomes like a beautiful drama you are
playing.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:15.880
I’m telling, all these things sound very
fantastic to you, and should find – because

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.240
you might say “we have never seen such angels
before.”

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.300
But there is a chance for all of you to become
that.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:29.789
Supposing you take a television into a remote
village of India where they have never seen

00:46:29.789 --> 00:46:34.730
a television, and tell them that “you can
see pictures from all over the world inside

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:35.730
this.”

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:36.941
They’ll say, “What, this box?

00:46:36.941 --> 00:46:38.800
Useless thing – how can it be?”

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.459
But when you put it to the mains, then they
see the miracles of it.

00:46:43.459 --> 00:46:49.289
In the same way when you are put it, you are
put to the mains you start seeing the miracles

00:46:49.289 --> 00:46:50.289
of your being.

00:46:50.289 --> 00:46:56.450
Then you understand how glorified you are,
how beautiful you are, and what is the purpose

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:57.450
of your life.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.420
There’s no end to this knowledge.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:04.100
For example, in here so many lights I see
here, but to put them on there might be only

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:10.910
one switch and you can put on all the lights.

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:15.449
But supposing I have to tell you all the history,
how it came and how the electricity came,

00:47:15.449 --> 00:47:21.090
and then how it was brought in Melbourne and
how it was fixed and everything, it’s quite

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.090
boring.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.860
So the best thing is just to put on the light
first.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:31.130
So I would request you, you’d better have
your Self-realization first and then understand,

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:35.500
because it’s a very subtle subject and I
don’t know how many thousand lectures I

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.160
have given only in English language.

00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:43.870
There are many other languages I speak, but
only in English language I don’t know how

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:47.940
many lectures I have given, and every time
they say, “Mother, every time You say something

00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:48.940
new.”

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:55.030
I am giving you thus a introduction to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:48:01.170
Now, once you get your realization you have
to know it works on collectivity.

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:05.810
It’s not that you go home and say, “All
right, Mother, I am meditating at home.”

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:09.330
It would be like a nail cut out of the body.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:15.380
You don’t have to pay for anything, but
you have to give some time for your Self-realization

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.729
and you have to come to the collective.

00:48:17.729 --> 00:48:22.680
Luckily in Melbourne we have wonderful people
who have achieved great heights in Sahaja

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:23.680
Yoga.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:28.760
They are extremely humble, they are extremely
beautiful people, and I’m sure they’ll

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:32.280
help you to achieve the same heights as they
have achieved.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.280
This is what we have to get.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:40.209
We have to emancipate the human beings to
solve all our problems, to enter into the

00:48:40.209 --> 00:48:41.310
Kingdom of God.

00:48:41.310 --> 00:48:45.459
This has been promised, and this promise has
to be fulfilled.

00:48:45.459 --> 00:48:52.300
Of course, before I go ahead with the process
of Self-realization which will take ten minutes

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:56.469
only, I would request you to ask Me questions.

00:48:56.469 --> 00:49:04.830
But ask relevant questions, questions which
show your curiosity to get your realization,

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:10.469
because I’m not here for any votes, nor
am I here for any money.

00:49:10.469 --> 00:49:14.360
I am here to give you your own key of your
own treasures.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:22.010
So accordingly, please ask Me questions.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:31.000
I’ll be very thankful to you.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:37.000
May God bless you.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:50:02.070
[Question: He says he thinks he is reaching
that stage, but could You tell him the symptoms?]

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:03.420
Yes.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:07.470
We’ll tell him.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:15.180
You see, first what happens, that you start
feeling the cool breeze out of your head.

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:22.770
Sometimes you might get hot also, hot breeze
coming out; then you start feeling the cool

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:27.170
breeze all around it.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:33.449
Then you become aware of it and you work it
out.

00:50:33.449 --> 00:50:37.290
Then you give realizations to others.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:42.970
All these things happen, and you become extremely
peaceful, loving, affectionate, and a righteous

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:43.970
person – you become.

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:50.680
It’s not like following any religion as
such, because when we follow a religion we

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.820
can do, we can commit any mistakes; any sins
we can commit.

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:59.940
But Sahaja Yoga is such that religion is born
within you – like here, as we have got eight

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:05.050
valencies within us, ten valencies within
us, and these ten valencies are in this green

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:07.660
part: when they’re awakened, you become
religious.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:08.660
You become.

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:11.040
You are not to be told, you just become.

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:14.680
I don’t have to tell you “don’t do this”
– I never say that.

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:24.190
It just happens, because you see in the light
what is right and what is wrong.

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:45.123
[Question: What is God, for You, and is God
a separate entity?]

00:51:45.123 --> 00:51:46.123
Ya, He is.

00:51:46.123 --> 00:51:48.670
He is, and God for Me is the one who is witnessing
everything.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:55.110
But He has His Power which is the Primordial
Mother, which is the Holy Ghost, which is

00:51:55.110 --> 00:52:03.440
reflected within you as the kundalini, and
God is reflected within you as the spirit

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.440
in your heart.

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:07.920
At this point they meet, and that’s how
you get your Self-realization.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:16.660
But such a wide subject it is, so you have
to have more patience for such a wider subject.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:44.940
[Question: Will there ever come a time when
the negative force in society will cease to

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.700
exist?]

00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:54.380
Yes, of course, if you help us.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:57.770
[Question: Which Indian saints or masters
do You acknowledge, or did any of them inspire

00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:59.790
You in Your cause?]

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:06.709
Yah, all of them were there, and there are
some more but they have all disappeared in

00:53:06.709 --> 00:53:12.840
the Himalayas, because they say that “these
human beings are absolutely dullards and they

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:17.630
won’t listen to us; You try Your luck!”

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:26.861
We have so many saints in India who are no
more, who really came down to the masses.

00:53:26.861 --> 00:53:33.870
The first one who really ventured to talk
to masses was Gyaneshwara, Saint Gyaneshwara.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:39.440
About kundalini it was written in so many
Sanskrit books, so many of them, you see,

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.290
but never in a local or a vernacular language.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:48.640
So Gyaneshwara in the twelfth century first
time talked about it.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:53.949
He took the permission of his master – because
it was a tradition to have one master and

00:53:53.949 --> 00:54:00.560
one disciple – and he wrote it about it
in his book first of all.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:04.950
And today the time has come for you to get
en masse realization.

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:12.820
There are so many saints that I really, in
this thing I cannot tell you, but there was

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:19.310
Ramadasa, there is Nanaka, there is Kabira
– so many of them – Adi Shankaracharya;

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:22.180
in India, as you ask.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:30.880
But outside also: William Blake was another
saint.

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:47.830
[Question: He says that T.M.

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:58.000
talks about Self-realization.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:10.000
What is the difference between their talking
about Self-realization and You talking about

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000
it?]

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.050
Now they have started.

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:14.910
They never talked about it before, and they
are just talking.

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:19.900
If I have to tell you everything frankly about
T.M., it’s better that you listen to it.

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.340
I’m not afraid of them.

00:55:22.340 --> 00:55:31.240
I had the head of their siddha – what they
call the “flying academy” – head of

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:37.939
that, the director, one Mr. Peter Pearce,
his wife, his deputy director and his child,

00:55:37.939 --> 00:55:40.180
all suffering from epilepsy, came to Me.

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:46.410
Luckily My husband was not at home those days,
so I kept them in My house and treated them,

00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:47.910
and got them well.

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:51.229
He’s about to write a book about it.

00:55:51.229 --> 00:55:53.200
Now I asked him what do they do.

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:59.199
So he told Me – because he was in it – he
said that they give three mantras, first stage

00:55:59.199 --> 00:56:07.590
they give three mantras, and these three mantras,
they were to pay three thousand pounds.

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:13.310
Now these three mantras, out of them any one
could be yours.

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:19.790
One was “inga”, another was “pinga”,
another was “tinga”.

00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:24.660
Now any Indian would laugh at it because they
know there is, these are not Sanskrit words.

00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:29.420
“Inga” means the scorpion bite; the “pinga”
means a person when he gets possessed, he

00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:34.400
goes round, is called “pinga” – it is
also in vernacular language, not in Sanskrit

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:37.540
– and “tinga” means showing like this.

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.870
And they paid three thousand – done!

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:42.530
It’s all marketing.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.750
People are so stupid!

00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:51.870
I mean, I have a disciple who came to Me from
T.M., her sister was in lunatic asylum.

00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:56.750
We had to work so hard on her, but now she’s
cured; and this barrister girl, poor thing,

00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:58.310
she suffered so much.

00:56:58.310 --> 00:57:01.230
So many people have gone into recluses.

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:07.950
She told Me that she had to go to Switzerland,
pay six thousand pounds for a course of seven

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:08.950
days.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:13.580
And the first day they were given – this
is for flying in the air.

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:19.160
Now this is also another stupidity, to go
for flying in the air, half-way through – what

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.160
is the need?

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:26.150
As it is, today there was such a lot of jam;
you see, if you start flying like this, then

00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:29.600
no car can move!

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.250
What is the need for you to fly at three feet?

00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:37.030
But this is stupidity, and for that stupidity
she paid six thousand pounds.

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:41.709
And she had to go to Switzerland, and she
said, “No arrangements for us, nothing.

00:57:41.709 --> 00:57:49.620
We were to live in a big hall, and they asked
us that we have to jump on, what you call

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:56.229
these foam mattresses,” and she broke her
bottom, and many broke their bottom.

00:57:56.229 --> 00:58:00.530
And they were asked, they were asked to give.

00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:07.080
And they were given to drink the water that
boiled the potatoes for six days, and the

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:11.630
seventh day they were given the rind, and
the fifth day the potatoes.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:15.340
For that they paid six thousand pounds!

00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:20.030
She’s a daughter of a very, very rich man.

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:25.260
But this is what it is, if you have surplus
money there are people to befool you.

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:28.290
There’s a market, it’s all marketing.

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:31.500
Now they are marketing what you call ayurveda.

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.990
What is there to market ayurveda?

00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:39.950
You can buy things directly from India; you
don’t need a guru for that.

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:44.330
And most of the ayurveda cannot be practiced
abroad because these are made out of fresh

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:45.340
leaves.

00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:50.070
But if you have to treat yourself with ayurveda
you can go to India.

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:56.590
But Sahaja Yoga is a direct method that you
can cure yourself by, with your kundalini

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:57.590
awakening.

00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:04.480
There are two doctors in Delhi University
who have got their M.D.

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:10.530
on Sahaja Yoga, which proved that Sahaja Yoga
can cure many incurable diseases.

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:11.530
We have cured.

00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:18.170
Not that I have cured, but people are cured
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:18.170 --> 00:59:23.939
Diseases like blood cancer, myelitis, so many
diseases have been cured, and there are so

00:59:23.939 --> 00:59:28.150
many that I really do not know how to even
keep account.

00:59:28.150 --> 00:59:30.699
We cannot keep account of them.

00:59:30.699 --> 00:59:31.699
So this is what T.M. is.

00:59:31.699 --> 00:59:33.370
Whatever they talk, they should prove it.

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:35.900
Have you met any T.M.

00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:45.350
fellow who can give realizations to others,
or who can talk like Stephen?

00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:46.939
There is no modus operandi.

00:59:46.939 --> 00:59:50.610
There is no modus operandi they can describe
– nothing.

00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:56.430
On the contrary, if you are a doctor you can
find them out just like that.

00:59:56.430 --> 01:00:03.300
Once in a lecture there was a Sahaja yogi,
who is now head of the Psychology Department

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:08.760
in Amman – he was there in their meetings
– and they said that when you take the brain

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.410
scan, you see the theta waves.

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:16.920
Immediately he got up, he said, “But you
get it with epilepsy; you get it with epilepsy.”

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920
And they were shocked.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.680
They just got round him and said, “Doctor,
will you come and have some tea with us?”

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.680
and this.

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:28.290
Then he went there and they were offering
him money and all that.

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:29.770
Is all money business.

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:33.760
If you have intelligence you can understand
it, that it’s all money.

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.920
You cannot purchase it.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.910
How much money did you give to Christ?

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:45.340
How much money did you give to Krishna or
to Rama, or to any one of them?

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:54.780
Those people whom you can purchase are your
servants; they cannot be your gurus.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:01:05.030
[Seeker: I was in Siddha Yoga for seven years
and I have a lot of problems.]

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:06.420
You will, but I know that, I’ll manage that.

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:07.420
It’s very difficult, but I’ll manage.

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:09.580
I know, with all these yogas you get nothing
but trouble.

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:10.580
I know that.

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:15.320
[Seeker: I tend to get very sleepy and tired,
and meditation makes me even sleepier.]

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.410
I know.

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:18.040
I know that.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:21.300
I’ll help you, don’t you worry.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:24.020
I’ll help you, all right?

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:25.020
Definitely.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.429
I know this is not only your case, it’s
so many.

01:01:27.429 --> 01:01:28.959
But in Australia he was so popular.

01:01:28.959 --> 01:01:32.850
I don’t know why he was so popular here.

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:38.750
You are supposed to be much more intelligent
than normal people!

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:40.740
Aren’t you?

01:01:40.740 --> 01:01:52.699
[Question: What are Your views on eating meat,
as opposed to vegetarianism?]

01:01:52.699 --> 01:02:03.740
You see, we, in Sahaja Yoga we treat a person
according to his needs.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:07.330
Supposing you need proteins, you have to have
proteins.

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:10.090
Supposing you need more carbohydrates, so
you have to have carbohydrates.

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:11.880
It’s a balancing thing.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:18.350
By eating meat or anything – like you think,
if you save some chickens, can I give them

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:19.350
realization?

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:20.700
Simple question.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.550
So we are paying too much attention to all
nonsensical things.

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:28.080
What you have to think, what we are human
beings on top of everything.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:33.740
Of course, some people don’t have to eat
meat because they have problems; but some

01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:37.360
people have to eat meat because they have
problems.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:49.600
We have to be logical about everything.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.140
These are all fads, or “isms”.

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:59.459
These are fads: don’t do this, wear this
kind of a dress, go on the street and sing

01:02:59.459 --> 01:03:03.949
“Hare Rama, Hare Krishna” or do another
nonsensical thing, or jump here.

01:03:03.949 --> 01:03:06.199
These are all fads and fashions.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:12.400
The fashion started that you should put a
tin on your head and tie up your hair, bouffant

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.400
or something.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.610
Everybody started doing that.

01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:18.150
We must have our individuality, we should
have our personality.

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:21.700
How can we accept anything that comes in the
way?

01:03:21.700 --> 01:03:26.710
And these entrepreneurs are playing with you,
so these gurus also play with you.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:29.410
We should be alert now – we have already
suffered a lot, haven’t we?

01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:37.850
[Question: What’s Your opinion of Swami
Muktananda?]

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:39.860
Ah.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.640
Better not ask!

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:49.580
You know, I have got just now a complete file
on him, from America they have published:

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.459
he’s such a horrible man.

01:03:51.459 --> 01:03:55.510
If you want you can read it, but I assure
you will not be able to eat food for at least

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:58.000
eight days.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.530
He had relations with even thirteen-year-old
girls.

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:05.290
What are you asking about a swami like that?

01:04:05.290 --> 01:04:07.340
Useless fellow!

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:10.420
[Question: Sai Baba?]

01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:13.500
Another horrible person.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.510
He is giving you diamonds.

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:17.140
Who has given diamonds to others?

01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.459
Who wants diamonds?

01:04:18.459 --> 01:04:21.090
From where does he get diamonds?

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:23.290
You know that very well.

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:24.490
He gets even Swiss watches.

01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:25.490
People are so stupid!

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:33.060
You are talking of spirituality and of God,
not of these mundane things.

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:37.520
If you want you can go in the market and get
a diamond; even if you don’t get, doesn’t

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.520
matter.

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:46.350
Those who have it or have not, nothing wrong
with them.

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:51.123
Look at his, their faces, how they look.

01:04:51.123 --> 01:04:53.300
I tell you, how can you be enamored by these
things?

01:04:53.300 --> 01:05:01.330
You always talk of materialism, you talk against
it and then you get enamored by these people

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.280
because they are in America.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:09.459
When I went there in Boston – can you imagine,
Americans are the best for this – so that

01:05:09.459 --> 01:05:11.830
they asked Me, “How many Rolls-Royces You
have?”

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:13.120
I said, “I have none.”

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.439
They said, “Then we are not interested in
You.”

01:05:15.439 --> 01:05:18.179
Can you imagine?

01:05:18.179 --> 01:05:24.459
If you are going to impress by these things
you are not going to get to the real thing

01:05:24.459 --> 01:05:26.820
– is definite.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:32.920
These all things can be bought by money, but
you cannot buy reality with money.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.480
Take it from Me, you cannot.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.602
It has to happen – is a fact.

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:39.602
I am telling you the truth, whether you like
it or not.

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.130
[Question: Is there an energy field that is
built up by raising the kundalini en masse,

01:05:42.130 --> 01:06:18.820
and does it spill over into another area?]

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:22.330
I think, you see, before describing it you’d
better feel it.

01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:23.330
All right?

01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:28.530
What’s the use of describing the beautiful
Australia unless and until you visit it?

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:36.750
Better feel it yourself and then you will
know.

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:38.940
All right?

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.040
Yes?

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:49.890
[Question from seeker about kundalini raising
giving her headaches.]

01:06:49.890 --> 01:07:00.650
She’s a … With whom did she do this kundalini
awakening?

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:03.030
Do you know?

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:05.179
…. Ah, must be somebody like that.

01:07:05.179 --> 01:07:13.910
You see, kundalini is your mother, all right,
and she is anxious to give you a second birth.

01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:17.610
She works it out herself, beautifully, like
your mother gave you the birth without giving

01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:19.340
you any trouble.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:24.160
That’s how she works it out.

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:34.620
But if you go to a person who’s not authorized
spiritually, they do all these things.

01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:39.910
I have not seen, but – now as they must
have told you that we are working in about

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:45.620
fifty-four nations, and I must have visited
at least forty-five of them – I have never

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:48.770
seen anybody suffering because of kundalini
awakening.

01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:51.929
On the contrary, feeling very much better.

01:07:51.929 --> 01:07:54.419
This is what it is.

01:07:54.419 --> 01:08:02.920
You must see first of all when you go to somebody:
what about the disciples, how are they?

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.969
How are they behaving?

01:08:04.969 --> 01:08:07.750
Are they beautiful people?

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:11.620
Have they achieved anything, have they got
anything?

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:15.179
And also you must see the life of the so-called
guru.

01:08:15.179 --> 01:08:16.740
How does he live?

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:20.660
Where is his interest?

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:25.699
But headlong if you fall into something you
are going to suffer, isn’t it?

01:08:25.699 --> 01:08:32.920
Now I’ve been coming to Australia for the
last, how many, from the year ’78 I think,

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:40.010
’77 or ’78; but I saw all the people were
scattered around these people, not around

01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:41.010
Me.

01:08:41.010 --> 01:08:45.990
They all like them, all such kinds.

01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:49.740
They wouldn’t come to Me.

01:08:49.740 --> 01:08:52.890
Even some people advised Me that “You’d
better charge some money.”

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:54.790
I said, “How much will you pay?

01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:56.570
Tell Me.”

01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:58.209
This is invaluable – you can’t pay for
it.

01:08:58.209 --> 01:09:01.699
[Question: Could You suggest anything that
would help her, now that she’s in that situation,

01:09:01.699 --> 01:09:03.219
please?]

01:09:03.219 --> 01:09:04.729
Help!

01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:14.699
Doesn’t matter, we have people there also.

01:09:14.699 --> 01:09:19.000
You give us her address, we’ll find out
for her.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.719
Australia and Iceland’s quite close, isn’t
it!

01:09:21.719 --> 01:09:23.960
But sweet of you to remember her.

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:45.750
[Question: When she meditates she feels the
kundalini rising, but suddenly it drops down

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:48.350
again.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:10:03.900
How does she keep it up?]

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.740
You have been in Sahaja Yoga?

01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:14.620
Did you get your realization through Sahaja
Yoga?

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:19.231
You see, we do not take responsibility of
people who have been to other places, but

01:10:19.231 --> 01:10:23.310
if you have been in Sahaja Yoga then we can
find out why it is happening.

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:29.090
If you have got your realization through Sahaja
Yoga we know, and we can help you very much

01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:30.090
better.

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:31.090
All right?

01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:32.360
Then it’s our responsibility.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:39.010
It does happen sometimes because if you have
problems in your brain, or maybe in your body

01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:44.141
there is some disease where the kundalini
wants to help, may be happening, but it can

01:10:44.141 --> 01:10:46.280
be expedited, it can be cleared out.

01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:49.760
These are all the problems which can be solved.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:11:06.930
You should have patience with yourself, that’s
all.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:18.550
[Question: Could You explain levels of samadhi
and nirvana?]

01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:19.550
Ah?

01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:20.550
Nirvana?

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:25.219
…. It’s too early to talk about it, but
first you get your samadhi, all right, step

01:11:25.219 --> 01:11:27.939
by step, step by step.

01:11:27.939 --> 01:11:36.080
Nirvana is the same as samadhi is, but in
nirvana state the, it’s the highest that

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.620
you can achieve in spirituality.

01:11:38.620 --> 01:11:39.790
All right?

01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:42.630
So it’s step by step we have to move.

01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:55.179
We can say it is the beginning of nirvana
and then you have to be working it out and

01:11:55.179 --> 01:11:59.140
you go to nirvana itself, into the complete
state.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:08.080
But one thing is definite there, that we have
to understand that these words we have read

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:17.260
from some books and the connotation of them,
it could be very, very wrong, could be very,

01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:19.340
very misunderstood.

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:28.090
So whatever is the reality you should face
it as reality, you should see it as reality:

01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:34.610
not to have any concept about it, because
if you have a concept then may be that it

01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:35.679
might be wrong.

01:12:35.679 --> 01:12:44.199
So it’s better to see for yourself.

01:12:44.199 --> 01:12:51.189
All right?

01:12:51.189 --> 01:13:18.750
[Question: Is it possible for the kundalini
to be raised prematurely, or does it just

01:13:18.750 --> 01:13:29.250
rise in its own time?]

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:31.360
Prematurely?

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:32.360
This is …

[Question: Is it dangerous?

– there are lots of written warnings that
kundalini can be dangerous?]

01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.360
No, there is no danger at all in kundalini
awakening at all.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.610
As I have told you just now, she’s your
mother.

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:39.080
There’s no danger.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:43.640
But people must have warnings because they
don’t want you to get realization, perhaps.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:47.790
One might have warned because they must have
put their hands into some sort of a burning

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:51.209
fire, thinking it is the kundalini.

01:13:51.209 --> 01:13:52.780
So that must be the reason.

01:13:52.780 --> 01:14:00.860
So far, we have had thousands and thousands
and thousands of people: nobody has felt anything

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:01.860
bad.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:06.479
After all, when you became a human being,
what was the danger in becoming human being

01:14:06.479 --> 01:14:07.479
from a monkey stage?

01:14:07.479 --> 01:14:08.950
Did you feel the cutting of your tail even?

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:21.630
So after all, you are made a human being for
a purpose, and that purpose is to make you

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:23.370
the higher being.

01:14:23.370 --> 01:14:26.210
How can it be troublesome?

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:28.010
It is so vitally important.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:31.300
Why should it be troublesome to you?

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:35.490
Use logic.

01:14:35.490 --> 01:14:49.630
If that is the last breakthrough of your evolution,
it has to work spontaneously and easily.

01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:59.850
Now, so there’s one more gentleman but now
this is the last, all right?

01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:01.300
What is the question?

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.390
Can you get up, please?

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:06.949
We can’t even see you.

01:15:06.949 --> 01:15:08.370
Thank you.

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:19.760
[Question: Does Self-realization have to take
place in this life or if you believe in reincarnation,

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:25.459
does it take place over a longer period?]

01:15:25.459 --> 01:15:28.690
Some people are realized in last life, I know.

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:31.700
They are born as realized souls also, I know.

01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:37.460
But I know one thing, that they don’t know
all about it – partly they know.

01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:39.890
They have to know all about it.

01:15:39.890 --> 01:15:42.490
They have to know all about their powers.

01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:46.243
They have to know how to raise the kundalini.

01:15:46.243 --> 01:15:50.810
They have to know what is missing in their
realization.

01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:57.300
All that they have to know.

01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.470
All right.

01:15:59.470 --> 01:16:06.890
So now, very simple thing we have to do, raise
…. As you know, we have to use the force

01:16:06.890 --> 01:16:09.120
of the Mother Earth very much.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:16.520
For that we have to take out our shoes for
a very short time.

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:28.020
Those who are sitting on the ground just have
to take out shoes, that’s all, and sit comfortably.

01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:53.729
We have the left and the right, two sides,
left and right sympathetic nervous system.

01:16:53.729 --> 01:17:06.300
The left caters to our emotional side, and
the right to our physical and our mental side.

01:17:06.300 --> 01:17:12.320
So we put both our feet apart from each other
– but those who are sitting on the ground

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.969
are all right, no problem – those who are
not sitting on the ground.

01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:18.710
They can sit comfortably there, just folded.

01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:23.740
Just sit whichever way you like, folded is
better.

01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:29.630
Be comfortable is the point.

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:36.560
Before we start anything else, there are two
conditions which you have to fulfill.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:49.909
The first one is that you have to know that
you are a human being, and you have to be

01:17:49.909 --> 01:18:03.590
confident that you will get your realization
and that it is your right to get your Self-realization.

01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:13.640
You are not to feel guilty about whatever
has happened in the past, because the divine

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:26.890
love is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever
mistakes you might have committed can be easily

01:18:26.890 --> 01:18:31.160
dissolved by that ocean of forgiveness.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:34.240
You must have faith in the power of that ocean.

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:40.050
After all, you are a human being, you are
not God, and if you have done any mistakes

01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:42.380
it’s all right.

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:45.560
So don’t feel guilty, don’t condemn yourselves.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.159
Those who have told you “you are sinners,”
you should know they must be the greatest

01:18:49.159 --> 01:18:50.909
sinners to say that.

01:18:50.909 --> 01:18:53.840
Nobody has business to say that to anyone.

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.260
So please have full confidence in yourself,
and not to feel guilty.

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:03.890
When you feel guilty, then this center here
on the back side there catches on, on the

01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:19.120
left side, and this gives you horrible diseases
like angina, lethargic organs and also spondylitis.

01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:21.090
So why to feel guilty for nothing at all?

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:28.729
If you think you have done mistakes, forget
it just now.

01:19:28.729 --> 01:19:36.570
Second condition is that you have to forgive
everyone in general.

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:41.219
You don’t have to think about people whom
you want to forgive.

01:19:41.219 --> 01:19:46.590
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you
don’t do anything.

01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:53.179
Again, logically you don’t do anything – it’s
just a myth; but if you don’t forgive then

01:19:53.179 --> 01:19:58.503
you play into wrong hands, in the sense those
who wanted to torture you or trouble you,

01:19:58.503 --> 01:20:05.979
they are quite happy, but you are suffering
mentally.

01:20:05.979 --> 01:20:14.570
So the best thing is to forgive everyone in
general, not even thinking about any individual

01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:15.570
whatsoever.

01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:19.990
This is a very, very important condition.

01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:27.449
Every time I have seen everywhere that people
just don’t forgive, and I have to work hard

01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:28.449
on them.

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:38.800
So best is, to make My situation better and
to make the whole thing work out faster, please,

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.200
for My sake forgive everyone, everyone.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:49.740
These are the two conditions.

01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:54.539
That’s all.

01:20:54.539 --> 01:21:05.530
(… You know, I don’t need that now.

01:21:05.530 --> 01:21:07.349
Too … )

01:21:07.349 --> 01:21:22.010
Now please put your left hand towards Me,
and right hand on your heart.

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:31.869
The spirit is residing in your heart.

01:21:31.869 --> 01:21:44.829
Left hand on your lap, just on your lap please,
comfortably.

01:21:44.829 --> 01:21:47.129
Now.

01:21:47.129 --> 01:21:56.199
Now we are working only on the left-hand side
with right hand, because right hand is for

01:21:56.199 --> 01:21:59.719
action and left hand is for desire.

01:21:59.719 --> 01:22:06.049
So when you put the left hand towards Me,
you are desiring to have your Self-realization;

01:22:06.049 --> 01:22:12.260
and with the right hand you are nourishing
your centers, yourself raising your own kundalini.

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:23.780
Now take down your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:34.319
This is the center which all the prophets
have created for us, all the great masters

01:22:34.319 --> 01:22:47.789
have created for our mastery: mastery over
the divine work, divine laws.

01:22:47.789 --> 01:22:57.390
Now we take down our hand in the lower portion
of our abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:22:57.390 --> 01:23:01.740
This is the center of pure knowledge.

01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:09.260
This knowledge manifests on your central nervous
system.

01:23:09.260 --> 01:23:13.979
This is what is called is “bodh” from
where the word “Buddha” has come, or “Ved”

01:23:13.979 --> 01:23:19.229
from the word “vida” – meaning “feeling
on your central nervous system.”

01:23:19.229 --> 01:23:21.689
As the Gnostic: “gn” means “to know.”

01:23:21.689 --> 01:23:27.550
“Know” doesn’t mean mentally, but to
know on your central nervous system.

01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:33.140
That’s the pure knowledge.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:39.050
Now you raise your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen and press it hard,

01:23:39.050 --> 01:23:43.329
on the left-hand side.

01:23:43.329 --> 01:23:57.559
Again you take your hand onto your heart.

01:23:57.559 --> 01:24:06.910
Now please put your right hand in the corner
of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your

01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:10.180
head to your right.

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:23.579
This is the center I’ve told you already
is in trouble when you feel guilty.

01:24:23.579 --> 01:24:36.029
Now please take your right hand on to your
forehead across, and put down your head as

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:41.149
far as possible.

01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:52.760
This is the center where you have to forgive
everyone in general.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:57.990
Now take back this right hand on the back
side of your head, and push back your head.

01:24:57.990 --> 01:25:03.149
Push back your head as far as possible.

01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:12.249
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting
your mistakes, you have to say, “Oh divine

01:25:12.249 --> 01:25:21.609
Power, please forgive me if I have done anything
wrong, knowingly or unknowingly.”

01:25:21.609 --> 01:25:25.919
That I’ll tell you later on; just now I’m
telling you the position.

01:25:25.919 --> 01:25:29.999
Now stretch your palm fully.

01:25:29.999 --> 01:25:40.240
Put the center of your palm on top of the
fontanel bone area here.

01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:42.309
And now press it hard.

01:25:42.309 --> 01:25:46.410
Press down your head.

01:25:46.410 --> 01:26:01.099
Press it hard, push back your fingers and
start moving your scalp with the pressure,

01:26:01.099 --> 01:26:02.269
seven times clockwise.

01:26:02.269 --> 01:26:03.649
This is important.

01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:04.649
Push back your fingers.

01:26:04.649 --> 01:26:32.539
Put down your head fully and now go on moving
your scalp seven times clockwise, very slowly.

01:26:32.539 --> 01:26:42.370
Now take down your hands.

01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:48.070
Now you have to close your eyes.

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:54.689
Before that you can take out your spectacles,
because you are not to open your eyes till

01:26:54.689 --> 01:26:59.329
I tell you; this might help your eyesight.

01:26:59.329 --> 01:27:15.279
Now please remember to put your feet on, away
from each other a little bit.

01:27:15.279 --> 01:27:27.390
If there’s anything tight on your neck or
on your waist, you can loosen it a little

01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:28.390
bit.

01:27:28.390 --> 01:27:42.920
Now put your right hand on your heart.

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:53.930
Here you ask Me a very fundamental question
– you can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”,

01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:57.939
whatever you like – “Mother, am I the
spirit?

01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:00.829
Mother, am I the spirit?”

01:28:00.829 --> 01:28:13.069
Ask this in your heart three times.

01:28:13.069 --> 01:28:24.519
If you are the spirit then you become your
own master, because in the light of the spirit

01:28:24.519 --> 01:28:29.740
you see everything clearly.

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:36.789
So now please take your hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side,

01:28:36.789 --> 01:28:43.780
press it hard.

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:55.660
Here you have to say, again a question you
have to ask Me, “Mother, am I my own master?”

01:28:55.660 --> 01:29:09.249
Ask this question three times, “Mother,
am I my own master?”

01:29:09.249 --> 01:29:36.879
Three times, in your heart.

01:29:36.879 --> 01:29:44.390
As I told you, I respect your freedom and
I cannot force pure knowledge on you, so you

01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:46.140
have to ask for it.

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:57.039
Take your right hand in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and

01:29:57.039 --> 01:30:08.529
here you say six times, because this center
has got six petals, “Mother, please give

01:30:08.529 --> 01:30:16.490
me self-knowledge” – or you can say “pure
knowledge” – “Mother, please give me

01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:19.479
pure knowledge.”

01:30:19.479 --> 01:30:47.070
Say it six times.

01:30:47.070 --> 01:31:20.799
Now, raise your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:31:20.799 --> 01:31:27.829
As you have asked for pure knowledge, your
kundalini has started moving upward, so we

01:31:27.829 --> 01:31:34.539
have to nourish these upper centers with self-confidence.

01:31:34.539 --> 01:31:47.999
So here you say ten times, “Mother, I am
my own master.”

01:31:47.999 --> 01:32:02.399
Say it with full self-confidence, ten times,
“Mother, I am my own master.”

01:32:02.399 --> 01:32:20.349
I have already told you that the most important
truth about is that you are not this body,

01:32:20.349 --> 01:32:27.089
not mind, not your conditionings, your ego,
but you are pure spirit.

01:32:27.089 --> 01:32:40.280
So now raise your right hand on your heart
and say here with full confidence, twelve

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:45.120
times, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

01:32:45.120 --> 01:33:10.649
Please say it twelve times.

01:33:10.649 --> 01:33:24.319
The divine Power is the ocean of knowledge,
is the ocean of love, joy and bliss, but above

01:33:24.319 --> 01:33:28.849
all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:33:28.849 --> 01:33:34.740
So whatever mistakes you have committed can
be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean

01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.220
of forgiveness.

01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:40.999
So please forgive yourself and raise your
right hand in the corner of your neck and

01:33:40.999 --> 01:33:49.729
your shoulder, and turn your head to your
right.

01:33:49.729 --> 01:34:02.740
Here with full confidence say sixteen times,
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:24.229
Please say that, “Mother, I am not guilty
at all.”

01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:31.049
I have already told you, whether you forgive
or don’t forgive you don’t do anything,

01:34:31.049 --> 01:34:35.209
but if you don’t forgive then you play into
wrong hands.

01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:41.740
It’s a myth to know that you are not forgiving
someone.

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:44.359
It’s a myth.

01:34:44.359 --> 01:34:55.899
So please raise your right hand on your forehead
across, and please put down your head as far

01:34:55.899 --> 01:34:59.479
as possible.

01:34:59.479 --> 01:35:06.419
And here with full confidence you have to
say from your heart – not how many times,

01:35:06.419 --> 01:35:12.829
from your heart – please say, it is very
important, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:35:12.829 --> 01:35:22.059
Don’t say “I try” – just saying it,
with full confidence, “Mother, I forgive

01:35:22.059 --> 01:35:32.749
everyone in general.”

01:35:32.749 --> 01:35:45.789
Now, take back your hand on the back side
of your head.

01:35:45.789 --> 01:35:51.300
Push back your head as far as possible.

01:35:51.300 --> 01:36:06.720
Here we have to say, without feeling guilty,
without counting your mistakes; just for your

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:14.120
satisfaction, from your heart, not how many
times, “Oh divine Power, if I have done

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:46.140
any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please
forgive me.”

01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:50.200
Now stretch your right hand.

01:36:50.200 --> 01:37:02.519
Put the center of your palm on the fontanel
bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:37:02.519 --> 01:37:06.470
Now put down your head as far as possible,
put down.

01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:08.809
Push back your fingers.

01:37:08.809 --> 01:37:17.339
Here again I respect your freedom.

01:37:17.339 --> 01:37:22.950
I cannot force Self-realization on you – you
have to ask for it.

01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:32.229
So now push back your fingers with the pressure;
move your scalp seven times clockwise, saying

01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:45.550
seven times, “Mother, please give me Self-realization.”

01:37:45.550 --> 01:38:19.180
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone seven
times.]

01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:37.189
Now please take down your hand.

01:38:37.189 --> 01:38:43.269
(If you can close the air-conditioning, they
would feel it better.)

01:38:43.269 --> 01:39:00.669
Now please put, open your eyes and put both
the hands towards Me like this, like this.

01:39:00.669 --> 01:39:09.579
Now, put your right hand like this, and don’t
think – you can manage, now you don’t

01:39:09.579 --> 01:39:10.579
think.

01:39:10.579 --> 01:39:17.003
Put the right hand and put down your head,
and see with the left hand if there is a cool

01:39:17.003 --> 01:39:22.289
breeze – can you get up and show them? – if
there’s a cool breeze coming out of your

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:23.970
fontanel bone area.

01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:32.660
Now, please put the left hand away from your
head, not on top – away, not very far; some

01:39:32.660 --> 01:39:38.610
people get it far also – but just try to
feel if there’s a cool breeze coming out

01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:44.890
of your head.

01:39:44.890 --> 01:39:52.569
Now please put your left hand towards Me like
this, like this.

01:39:52.569 --> 01:40:04.289
And now put down your head, and now see for
yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming

01:40:04.289 --> 01:40:06.269
out of your head.

01:40:06.269 --> 01:40:10.829
(There is so much of cool breeze.)

01:40:10.829 --> 01:40:28.430
Now feel it with the right hand.

01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:32.870
Right hand towards Me and left hand: you see
it clearly, if there’s a cool breeze coming

01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:35.459
out of your head, the fontanel bone area.

01:40:35.459 --> 01:40:41.079
You can move your hand a little bit up and
down and see for yourself on sideways.

01:40:41.079 --> 01:40:47.410
Now, raise both your hands towards the sky.

01:40:47.410 --> 01:40:56.069
Push back your head and ask a question, “Mother,
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

01:40:56.069 --> 01:41:05.549
or ask, “Mother is this the all-pervading
Power of divine love?” or “Mother, is

01:41:05.549 --> 01:41:06.870
this the Paramachaitanya?”

01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:15.959
Ask any one of these questions three times,
raising your hands.

01:41:15.959 --> 01:41:22.070
Put down your hands, please.

01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:25.339
So much of breeze already blowing all over!

01:41:25.339 --> 01:41:31.399
All those … it’s tremendous breeze already
blowing all over.

01:41:31.399 --> 01:41:36.149
It’s not air-conditioning, for your information.

01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:43.669
Now those who have felt the cool breeze out
of their fontanel bone area or on their hands

01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:55.099
or fingertips, please raise both your hands.

01:41:55.099 --> 01:42:01.640
May God bless you.

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.200
So many of you have felt it now.

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:06.930
Some of you have not felt, doesn’t matter.

01:42:06.930 --> 01:42:15.069
Tomorrow again we have a program, and I’ll
explain to you more about the nature of spirit

01:42:15.069 --> 01:42:18.019
and the nature of these centers.

01:42:18.019 --> 01:42:24.450
Please inform your friends, everyone, to come,
and tomorrow hopefully, I will meet all of

01:42:24.450 --> 01:42:27.019
you one by one.

01:42:27.019 --> 01:42:34.759
Also those who have problems should write
them on a piece of paper and their address,

01:42:34.759 --> 01:42:42.289
and we’ll try to contact them and help them
as far as possible.

01:42:42.289 --> 01:42:45.430
Thank you very much.

01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:54.740
Those who have not felt can come on this side
and the Sahaja yogis can work it out in five

01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:56.249
minutes, those who have not felt.

01:42:56.249 --> 01:42:59.249
Because you did not forgive; I know you have
not forgiven.

01:42:59.249 --> 01:43:01.029
If you had forgiven you would have felt it.

01:43:01.029 --> 01:43:02.059
Come along, this side.

01:43:02.059 --> 01:43:07.430
Just five minutes and they’ll give you realization.

01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:08.430
You felt it?

01:43:08.430 --> 01:43:09.430
Ha, good.

01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:13.279
Your problems will be solved now, it’s good.

01:43:13.279 --> 01:43:17.999
You felt it?

01:43:17.999 --> 01:43:22.879
…. Which hand you felt?

01:43:22.879 --> 01:43:31.249
Left you felt, not the right?

01:43:31.249 --> 01:43:35.329
…. Doesn’t matter.

01:43:35.329 --> 01:43:43.490
We’ll work it out.

01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:47.569
It’s good.

01:43:47.569 --> 01:43:49.609
Surprising!

01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:53.049
…. First of all, see on their heads are
you feeling it or not; just see it.

01:43:53.049 --> 01:44:00.410
They might be saying they are not feeling
it because of Vishuddhi.

01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:02.669
…. Yes, yes, do.

01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:24.880
[Seeker asks about her chronic low energy,
and the Hatha Yoga she has been doing.]

01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:36.010
You know, you see this modern Hatha Yoga is
most unscientific.

01:44:36.010 --> 01:44:41.490
It is just done like all the medicines you
take from the medicine box, without knowing

01:44:41.490 --> 01:44:42.779
what you need really.

01:44:42.779 --> 01:44:48.189
So you give up that and come to Sahaja Yoga
and know what’s wrong with you, and fill

01:44:48.189 --> 01:44:50.059
yourself with energy, all right?

01:44:50.059 --> 01:44:51.189
Is all nonsense.

01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:52.309
It’s all nonsense.

01:44:52.309 --> 01:44:55.120
It has given heart attacks to people, heart
attacks.

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.499
It’s the way they go about it.

01:44:57.499 --> 01:45:01.410
We also do a little bit of Hatha Yoga, but
wherever it is necessary; it’s not like

01:45:01.410 --> 01:45:03.160
mad, doing all the time there.

01:45:03.160 --> 01:45:10.189
Now you have a catch on this one, you have
a catch on there.

01:45:10.189 --> 01:45:11.979
Two centers are very badly caught up.

01:45:11.979 --> 01:45:16.930
So you’d better come to Sahaja Yoga, all
right, and fix yourself up, because Hatha

01:45:16.930 --> 01:45:20.349
Yoga nobody reaches God, that’s true.

01:45:20.349 --> 01:45:22.789
But this Hatha Yoga is very limited: a wee
bit of it.

01:45:22.789 --> 01:45:29.109
You see, Patanjali wrote “Ashtanga Yoga”
out of which this Hatha Yoga that you do is

01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:32.680
one-eighth of one of them.

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:37.720
And that to be is understood with the guidance
of the kundalini: where is the kundalini stopping?

01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:42.019
Whatever center it is stopping, that is the
one you have to look after.

01:45:42.019 --> 01:45:47.859
And that is the one you have to do that particular
asana for that particular thing – not all

01:45:47.859 --> 01:45:51.990
of them like that mad.

01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:53.640
All right?

01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:57.049
So …. You cannot do it unless and until
you start your kundalini.

01:45:57.049 --> 01:46:01.070
Once you start your kundalini, you will know
where the problem is.

01:46:01.070 --> 01:46:07.279
It’s like if your car has started then you
will know where is the problem is, isn’t

01:46:07.279 --> 01:46:08.669
it?

01:46:08.669 --> 01:46:12.819
It’s like that.

01:46:12.819 --> 01:46:18.359
May God bless you.

01:46:18.359 --> 01:46:25.289
So now, how are you?

01:46:25.289 --> 01:46:28.059
Your sister?

01:46:28.059 --> 01:46:34.979
You are all right now?

01:46:34.979 --> 01:46:39.129
She’s in Iceland.

01:46:39.129 --> 01:46:46.470
You give her address to us, we’ll contact
her.

01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:47.470
All right.

01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:57.589
What is she, now?

01:46:57.589 --> 01:47:02.559
Iceland?

01:47:02.559 --> 01:47:16.859
…. What’s the matter with her?

01:47:16.859 --> 01:48:02.221
…. You see, they will tell …. You come
and see Me, and take the photograph .… And

01:48:02.221 --> 01:48:22.599
then you send My photograph, and tell her
to put both her hands towards the photograph

01:48:22.599 --> 01:52:21.079
and both her feet in

01:52:21.079 --> 01:55:56.000
the water with salt every night …. Both
the hands to the photograph, and both the

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:44.489
feet in the water …. All right?

01:56:44.489 --> 02:05:36.999
But

02:05:36.999 --> 02:06:03.579
first you master this.

02:06:03.579 --> 02:06:31.079
You felt the cool breeze?

02:06:31.079 --> 02:07:25.589
[Seeker says he wasn’t sure if it was cool
or not.]

02:07:25.589 --> 02:07:35.499
Better forgive.

02:07:35.499 --> 02:15:08.129
You have to forgive …. you don’t forgive.

02:15:08.129 --> 02:17:18.129
How can I forgive for you?

02:17:18.129 --> 02:18:54.999
You have to forgive yourself, forgive everyone.

02:18:54.999 --> 02:19:23.169
I can’t forgive for you.

02:19:23.169 --> 02:20:19.509
[Seeker asks where Shri Mataji lives in India.]

02:20:19.509 --> 02:21:17.319
For practical purposes I live in London.
