00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:13.831
Om is a word that people don’t understand because it is

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:27.555
at the very beginning of this creation that 
the energy of God, energy of His Love

00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:33.263
separated from His identity.

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:40.190
He pushed Her, called it as Lasik, He pushed Her to create

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:47.001
and He became the spectator and She had to create.

00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:55.183
At that time when She was pushed (we don’t have 
here something to show you how it worked),

00:00:55.303 --> 00:00:58.993
but when He tried to push Her,

00:00:59.113 --> 00:01:11.021
Her movement went into a kind of a word

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:20.130
which is written as “A” “U” and “MA” 
(Shri Mataji draws the symbol for Om).

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.245
So there are three words in it.

00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:31.167
At the time of that pushing when the separation took place,

00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:38.532
there was a sound, the first sound 
and that sound is called as Om.

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:47.137
So many people call it as logos, but to understand it 
you have to go deeper into it, what is involved.

00:01:47.257 --> 00:01:59.670
So Her power got divided into three – A, U and Ma – 
and that’s how She became Om.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:08.520
So Om is the sound which is emitted when she creates,

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:20.155
which acts as the basis of the essence of Her Love.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:27.446
Then how She started creating is a very long story 
which I won’t be able to tell you today,

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:37.415
but this Om is the one that She first used 
to create the innocence on this Earth.

00:02:37.535 --> 00:02:45.868
So this Om was the innocence with which 
She filled the whole universe.

00:02:45.988 --> 00:02:53.290
Om is nothing but the innocence that you see in children,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.651
in so many people, in saints 
and in most of the incarnations.

00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:06.847
They are empowered by their innocence

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:11.706
and this innocence first filled the whole space.

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:16.670
Even before creating the space the innocence was there.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.270
That was the first creation of element 
and that was the innocence.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:35.816
So Om is innocence which does 
all the living work on this Earth.
