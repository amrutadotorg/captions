00:00:00.435 --> 00:00:06.435
Public Program. Vienna (Austria), 27 July 1992.

01:16:08.055 --> 01:16:11.638
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:16:17.805 --> 01:16:23.763
At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is.

01:16:28.971 --> 01:16:32.721
We cannot imagine about it,

01:16:33.013 --> 01:16:36.430
think about it or conceptualize it.

01:16:46.721 --> 01:16:52.138
Also unfortunately, at this human level we cannot feel it.

01:16:58.222 --> 01:17:02.097
We have to become a subtler being

01:17:02.305 --> 01:17:06.305
to feel our subtle being.

01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:15.514
We have to be the Spirit.

01:17:18.805 --> 01:17:24.138
Otherwise whatever we think about it

01:17:24.347 --> 01:17:26.430
is not reality.

01:17:39.805 --> 01:17:45.347
Reality has to be known by ascending

01:17:45.721 --> 01:17:48.679
to another state of Spirit.

01:17:57.138 --> 01:18:00.472
Now, let us know what is the truth.

01:18:03.595 --> 01:18:09.388
The truth is we are not this body, this mind

01:18:10.638 --> 01:18:13.971
Is... Sorry, go ahead.

01:18:19.347 --> 01:18:23.347
This is not your conditionings,

01:18:23.595 --> 01:18:26.430
nor your ego, emotions,

01:18:26.596 --> 01:18:29.555
but it is pure Spirit.

01:18:38.263 --> 01:18:43.097
The second truth is that there is an All-pervading Power

01:18:43.305 --> 01:18:45.472
of Divine Love,

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:56.138
which does all the living work.

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:05.180
We see these beautiful flowers –  it’s a miracle,

01:19:08.721 --> 01:19:10.888
but we take it for granted.

01:19:13.971 --> 01:19:16.055
Look at our eyes,

01:19:16.263 --> 01:19:20.222
which is a miracle itself – it’s a camera.

01:19:26.097 --> 01:19:30.138
Look at our brain, which is such a computer.

01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:37.055
But we take it for granted

01:19:39.347 --> 01:19:41.721
and do not think about it.

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:46.013
Who does this work?

01:19:48.388 --> 01:19:51.388
Who runs our heart?

01:20:02.013 --> 01:20:05.180
What's the matter? Please take the child out.

01:20:13.721 --> 01:20:16.846
We call it in medical terminology

01:20:17.138 --> 01:20:20.430
that autonomous nervous system runs the heart.

01:20:26.013 --> 01:20:28.472
But who is this auto?

01:20:33.013 --> 01:20:36.388
All this living work is done by

01:20:36.595 --> 01:20:40.222
this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

01:20:48.595 --> 01:20:53.097
Whatever I’m telling you, you need not take it blindfolded.

01:20:58.055 --> 01:21:02.595
But you have to keep your mind open

01:21:03.222 --> 01:21:05.638
like a scientist

01:21:08.638 --> 01:21:11.721
and treat it as a hypothesis.

01:21:14.514 --> 01:21:18.679
And if you find that it is true

01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:23.180
then you have to accept it as honest people.

01:21:28.055 --> 01:21:31.846
Because it is for your benevolence

01:21:32.263 --> 01:21:36.097
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

01:21:44.638 --> 01:21:50.638
So now, within us is based this mechanism,

01:21:50.846 --> 01:21:54.805
which has been shown to you and about which they have told you.

01:22:02.595 --> 01:22:05.721
And there is this power

01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:08.638
which is going to connect you

01:22:08.846 --> 01:22:12.222
to this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

01:22:21.679 --> 01:22:23.805
We are all born

01:22:24.013 --> 01:22:28.430
with that Divinity within us in a potential state.

01:22:35.138 --> 01:22:38.138
And it is quite intact.

01:22:40.055 --> 01:22:42.013
Whatever you might have done,

01:22:42.222 --> 01:22:45.388
whatever so called mistakes you might have committed,

01:22:45.721 --> 01:22:50.097
this faith of Divinity is also within us.

01:22:58.097 --> 01:23:01.180
We had this faith from our childhood,

01:23:01.388 --> 01:23:04.055
but gradually we lost it.

01:23:09.555 --> 01:23:12.888
We had faith that there is something beyond

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:16.055
and that’s what we have lost it.

01:23:20.138 --> 01:23:23.222
Or we are misled.

01:23:29.595 --> 01:23:32.055
We have to understand that

01:23:32.263 --> 01:23:37.180
this Divinity is absolutely there,

01:23:37.472 --> 01:23:41.846
untarnished, without any problem,

01:23:49.679 --> 01:23:53.430
because it is of eternal nature.

01:23:57.388 --> 01:24:02.222
Like clouds, maybe some of the actions

01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:05.846
in our life might have covered it.

01:24:14.055 --> 01:24:19.679
But you’ll be amazed to see that it is there, alive.

01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:29.388
Now, the second problem we have to understand

01:24:29.595 --> 01:24:34.347
that all world problems come from human beings.

01:24:40.013 --> 01:24:42.555
And all human problems come from

01:24:42.721 --> 01:24:45.514
these fundamental centers within us.

01:24:50.763 --> 01:24:55.596
When these fundamental centers go into problems

01:24:55.846 --> 01:24:59.846
we get all kinds of physical, mental,

01:25:00.055 --> 01:25:02.888
emotional, social, political

01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:06.097
and also spiritual problems.

01:25:12.529 --> 01:25:16.610
Physical, mental, emotional,

01:25:16.805 --> 01:25:21.595
political, economical and social.

01:25:22.763 --> 01:25:28.679
So, if these centers could be corrected, nourished,

01:25:28.971 --> 01:25:32.679
made healthy all the problems will be solved.

01:25:41.971 --> 01:25:47.971
The time has come for us to achieve that state of Spirit.

01:25:53.472 --> 01:25:58.971
Is a special time. I call it the blossom time.

01:26:00.846 --> 01:26:05.263
In the Bible they called it the Last Judgment.

01:26:10.055 --> 01:26:12.888
In the Koran, Puranas,

01:26:13.138 --> 01:26:17.555
also it is described as ”Satya Yuga”.

01:26:22.638 --> 01:26:26.721
And in the Koran it is described as

01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:29.430
”Kiyama”, meaning Resurrection time.

01:26:34.846 --> 01:26:38.138
It is fortunate that at this time you are all born

01:26:38.347 --> 01:26:41.347
and that you are seekers of truth.

01:26:47.638 --> 01:26:52.347
Sahaja Yoga – ”Saha” means ‘with you’, is born the right

01:26:52.721 --> 01:26:55.222
to achieve the state of Spirit.

01:27:00.763 --> 01:27:02.930
”’Ja”’ is born.

01:27:16.638 --> 01:27:20.805
So, this right you have. All of you have got that right.

01:27:21.013 --> 01:27:24.430
And you have to achieve that state of Spirit.

01:27:31.055 --> 01:27:35.888
In short I’ll tell you what is this nature of the Spirit.

01:27:40.805 --> 01:27:44.097
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty.

01:27:47.638 --> 01:27:50.595
So, it is a universal being.

01:27:55.555 --> 01:28:01.013
It exists as a witness in our heart.

01:28:04.763 --> 01:28:07.263
It watches whatever we are doing.

01:28:10.805 --> 01:28:14.347
But when it manifests in our attention

01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:20.930
then we can feel

01:28:22.097 --> 01:28:25.721
the our centers and the centers of others.

01:28:34.263 --> 01:28:39.097
Thus we get self knowledge – selfhood.

01:28:41.514 --> 01:28:46.138
And also we develop a new dimension in our awareness

01:28:46.347 --> 01:28:49.763
called as collective consciousness,

01:28:57.138 --> 01:29:00.347
when you can feel the centers of others.

01:29:03.055 --> 01:29:07.097
If you can understand

01:29:07.514 --> 01:29:13.222
and master the art of Divine working

01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:16.222
you can cure your centers

01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:19.846
and you can cure the centers of others.

01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:35.013
When this Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area

01:29:35.222 --> 01:29:39.721
it connects you to this All-pervading Power of Divine Love.

01:29:47.472 --> 01:29:51.138
Just like this instrument has got this

01:29:51.347 --> 01:29:54.971
connection with the mains, in the same way

01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:58.472
you get connected with that power.

01:30:06.013 --> 01:30:08.971
Once this connection is fully established

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:13.222
all the time this dynamic energy starts flowing through you.

01:30:20.846 --> 01:30:26.305
You become dynamic – at the same time extremely compassionate.

01:30:32.138 --> 01:30:37.222
You become very wise, with divine discretion.

01:30:41.013 --> 01:30:43.305
On your fingertips you can feel

01:30:43.514 --> 01:30:46.514
your centers and the centers of others.

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:54.430
Everybody feels the same.

01:30:56.013 --> 01:30:58.638
If you want to know this is wrong or right

01:30:58.846 --> 01:31:01.805
you can feel it on your fingertips.

01:31:07.097 --> 01:31:09.638
Thus you know the absolute truth.

01:31:13.222 --> 01:31:16.222
If everyone feels the same way,

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:21.013
then how can there be quarrels? How can there be wars also?

01:31:30.138 --> 01:31:35.305
So, this is a new awareness,

01:31:35.555 --> 01:31:39.638
a new dimension, which manifests within us.

01:31:46.013 --> 01:31:49.555
And it takes us much beyond mental activity,

01:31:49.721 --> 01:31:53.721
where your thoughts cannot overpower you.

01:32:01.805 --> 01:32:05.638
Thoughts come from the future or from the past

01:32:05.846 --> 01:32:08.930
and we are dancing on the cusp of the thoughts.

01:32:16.097 --> 01:32:22.138
But with this happening we enter into our present.

01:32:27.138 --> 01:32:30.595
In between these thoughts there is a space

01:32:30.805 --> 01:32:33.263
where there is peace

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:36.430
and we enter into our peace.

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:49.596
This state, in this state you become

01:32:49.805 --> 01:32:52.888
thoughtlessly aware.

01:33:01.638 --> 01:33:08.138
When you start growing in your spiritual being

01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:13.514
then the second thing that happens to you

01:33:13.805 --> 01:33:17.930
is that you become

01:33:20.721 --> 01:33:24.763
one with reality.

01:33:32.595 --> 01:33:36.222
All kinds of falsehood start dropping out.

01:33:40.596 --> 01:33:44.846
And you know that you have become a saint.

01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:49.472
And you become extremely confident with your knowledge.

01:33:57.222 --> 01:34:00.430
The Spirit is the source of joy.

01:34:04.013 --> 01:34:08.097
And you jump into the ocean of joy.

01:34:12.555 --> 01:34:15.763
Joy has no duality.

01:34:18.721 --> 01:34:22.430
It does not have happiness and unhappiness.

01:34:25.679 --> 01:34:27.763
It is absolute.

01:34:29.846 --> 01:34:32.596
All this is your own.

01:34:35.222 --> 01:34:37.721
You have to just get it.

01:34:41.097 --> 01:34:43.721
It’s a very easy thing,

01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:47.638
it’s very spontaneous, it’s a living process.

01:34:53.763 --> 01:34:56.763
For this process you don’t have to pay.

01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:03.430
You don’t have to put in any efforts.

01:35:05.888 --> 01:35:07.971
It’s spontaneous.

01:35:10.180 --> 01:35:13.180
It spontaneously sprouts.

01:35:16.013 --> 01:35:20.555
You have to only look after it like a gardener.

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:32.430
Whatever I am telling you is not a sermon or a lecture,

01:35:38.013 --> 01:35:41.388
it’s the actualization of the experience.

01:35:46.638 --> 01:35:50.971
And actualization of your baptism.

01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:57.638
Because you feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost

01:35:57.846 --> 01:36:00.097
coming out of your head.

01:36:06.097 --> 01:36:09.930
Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

01:36:14.097 --> 01:36:18.097
And Kundalini is the Primordial Mother.

01:36:22.888 --> 01:36:26.805
This is what is reflected in you

01:36:27.013 --> 01:36:30.055
as your own individual mother.

01:36:34.472 --> 01:36:37.805
And she gives you your second birth.

01:36:42.138 --> 01:36:44.305
Christ has said,

01:36:44.514 --> 01:36:48.555
“The humble in heart will inherit the Earth.”

01:36:57.222 --> 01:37:00.555
So one has to be humble.

01:37:04.013 --> 01:37:08.595
If you are arrogant about it, your own Kundalini won’t rise.

01:37:16.805 --> 01:37:19.805
Moreover

01:37:21.055 --> 01:37:25.263
this Kundalini knows all about you.

01:37:29.472 --> 01:37:32.472
She does not give you any trouble.

01:37:35.055 --> 01:37:40.263
And just spontaneously She manages to connect you

01:37:40.472 --> 01:37:43.595
to that All-pervading Divine Power.

01:37:50.430 --> 01:37:54.888
And for the first time you start feeling on your fingertips

01:37:55.971 --> 01:37:59.971
this All-pervading Power as cool breeze.

01:38:09.846 --> 01:38:12.305
I respect your freedom,

01:38:12.514 --> 01:38:17.888
and your Self Realization cannot be forced on you.

01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:30.388
Those who really want it, in a humble way, can have it.

01:38:36.846 --> 01:38:39.721
Those who do not want

01:38:40.013 --> 01:38:43.721
are not forced – cannot be forced.

01:38:47.930 --> 01:38:51.055
All such people should please leave the hall.

01:38:56.347 --> 01:39:01.388
It will take about 10 or 15 minutes to get your Realization.

01:39:06.388 --> 01:39:10.222
In this short time you should appreciate I cannot tell you

01:39:10.430 --> 01:39:13.555
everything about this vast knowledge,

01:39:19.638 --> 01:39:22.013
but if you get your enlightenment

01:39:22.222 --> 01:39:25.388
you’ll understand this subtle knowledge very easily.

01:39:36.472 --> 01:39:40.430
So, those who do not want can leave the hall.

01:39:44.388 --> 01:39:47.846
It will hardly take 10 to 15 minutes.

01:39:51.595 --> 01:39:54.763
The lights are very dim, I can’t see the people.

01:40:08.595 --> 01:40:11.846
I know, some of you have questions –

01:40:12.805 --> 01:40:16.638
but just now keep them away from yourself.

01:40:23.222 --> 01:40:25.514
And you can write them down

01:40:25.679 --> 01:40:28.679
and we’ll try to answer them later on.

01:40:38.138 --> 01:40:40.347
Can’t see them.

01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:50.472
It's good.

01:41:05.638 --> 01:41:10.347
There are three conditions which are very simple.

01:41:14.971 --> 01:41:18.638
The first condition is that

01:41:18.846 --> 01:41:21.971
you all have to have  full confidence

01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:26.596
that you will all get your Self Realization tonight.

01:41:39.388 --> 01:41:43.555
Second is you are not to feel guilty

01:41:43.721 --> 01:41:46.888
about anything whatsoever.

01:41:53.971 --> 01:41:58.846
This idea of sin – please take it out of your mind.

01:42:03.805 --> 01:42:05.805
This gives you a guilt,

01:42:06.013 --> 01:42:09.180
which makes your left Vishuddhi here – this chakra –

01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:11.971
very weak.

01:42:21.595 --> 01:42:26.514
And this causes a disease called angina,

01:42:26.679 --> 01:42:31.595
spondylitis and the lethargy of the organs.

01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:45.930
If you have done mistakes, it’s all right.

01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:49.514
After all you are human beings, you are not God.

01:42:57.555 --> 01:43:00.013
And if you have done mistakes you should face them,

01:43:00.222 --> 01:43:04.555
instead of putting them as guilt here and torture yourself.

01:43:10.805 --> 01:43:13.347
In short, forgive yourself

01:43:13.555 --> 01:43:17.846
and be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

01:43:23.263 --> 01:43:28.930
because you are going to enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:43:35.514 --> 01:43:40.930
This Divine Power is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

01:43:47.888 --> 01:43:50.555
And you cannot commit any mistake

01:43:50.721 --> 01:43:55.846
that cannot be dissolved by this Ocean of Forgiveness.

01:44:05.846 --> 01:44:09.888
The third condition is also very simple.

01:44:13.596 --> 01:44:19.555
Third ccondition is that you have to forgive everyone.

01:44:25.514 --> 01:44:28.805
You have to forgive in general, you don’t have to think

01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:31.595
about each one of them.

01:44:35.763 --> 01:44:38.097
Logically,

01:44:38.305 --> 01:44:42.347
whether you forgive or don’t forgive you don’t do anything.

01:44:47.638 --> 01:44:52.222
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

01:44:56.514 --> 01:45:01.514
Those who have tortured you, or troubled you are happy

01:45:01.679 --> 01:45:06.180
and you are torturing yourself on their behalf.

01:45:16.846 --> 01:45:21.097
So, what’s the use of not forgiving?

01:45:25.888 --> 01:45:31.888
Moreover, the chakra which we call as the Agnya chakra,

01:45:32.347 --> 01:45:35.638
in the optic chiasma,

01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:39.430
it's closed like this, constricted like this.

01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:49.971
It won’t open unless and until you forgive.

01:45:53.596 --> 01:45:56.596
But once you forgive it opens like this.

01:46:01.097 --> 01:46:03.388
You have to just say, “I forgive everyone of them.”

01:46:03.595 --> 01:46:06.846
Don’t even think of them, because it’s a headache.

01:46:14.930 --> 01:46:17.514
These are the only three conditions.

01:46:19.971 --> 01:46:24.138
If you really accept them, it will work out very fast.

01:46:27.555 --> 01:46:30.595
You have to cooperate with Me.

01:46:35.097 --> 01:46:37.472
Now

01:46:38.055 --> 01:46:41.595
we have to take out our shoes. That will help us a lot,

01:46:41.763 --> 01:46:46.679
because this Mother Earth sucks in our problems.

01:47:15.596 --> 01:47:19.555
Now, they have already told you about the left and right side.

01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:25.013
And

01:47:25.222 --> 01:47:28.222
as they are two powers, we have to put both the feet

01:47:28.430 --> 01:47:30.805
little away from each other.

01:47:39.595 --> 01:47:44.347
You don’t have to stay in yourself, you have to be comfortable

01:47:44.595 --> 01:47:47.263
only thing, don’t bend yourself too much

01:47:47.472 --> 01:47:50.388
or don’t stretch yourself too much till I tell you.

01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:58.595
You have to be very comfortable.

01:48:01.555 --> 01:48:04.180
You don’t have to go to Himalayas for that.

01:48:07.763 --> 01:48:10.055
And you don’t have to suffer.

01:48:12.097 --> 01:48:14.305
Christ has suffered for us already.

01:48:20.430 --> 01:48:22.721
Just have faith in yourself.

01:48:25.472 --> 01:48:29.347
Don’t be doubts about yourself.

01:48:33.763 --> 01:48:38.846
I assure you, you all can get your Self Realization tonight.

01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:51.472
So, now we’ll show you how we’ll nourish

01:48:51.638 --> 01:48:54.971
our own centers, you will nourish your own centers.

01:49:01.305 --> 01:49:04.805
Please put your left hand towards Me like this.

01:49:09.097 --> 01:49:15.222
This is symbolic that you want your Self Realization,

01:49:15.555 --> 01:49:20.595
because left side is the power of ordinary desire.

01:49:30.388 --> 01:49:32.388
All of you have to do it.

01:49:32.595 --> 01:49:35.763
Those who don’t want to do should go away.

01:49:44.097 --> 01:49:48.388
Then we have the second power,

01:49:48.595 --> 01:49:51.222
the power of action on the right hand side,

01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:54.679
with which we’ll be nourishing our centers.

01:50:04.763 --> 01:50:08.347
Third is the power of Kundalini

01:50:08.555 --> 01:50:12.055
which is the power of pure desire.

01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:22.971
So, all of you should have pure desire in your heart

01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:28.180
that you should all get your Self Realization.

01:50:35.055 --> 01:50:38.347
So, just put your left hand towards Me like this,

01:50:38.555 --> 01:50:45.596
very comfortably on your lap or on your legs,

01:50:54.097 --> 01:50:56.971
resting like this.

01:50:58.555 --> 01:51:01.013
Now, with the right hand we’ll be nourishing

01:51:01.222 --> 01:51:03.971
our centers on the left hand side.

01:51:08.472 --> 01:51:13.555
First we do it, we’ll show you and then we'll close our eyes

01:51:13.721 --> 01:51:15.971
and the process will start.

01:51:22.472 --> 01:51:25.595
Please put your right hand on your heart.

01:51:29.555 --> 01:51:35.388
This is the center where the Spirit resides.

01:51:41.721 --> 01:51:45.679
If you become the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit,

01:51:45.888 --> 01:51:48.971
you become your guide, your master.

01:51:55.930 --> 01:52:00.263
Then you put your hand... Please come. put your hand

01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:05.347
on the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:52:11.472 --> 01:52:15.263
This is the center of your mastery.

01:52:20.763 --> 01:52:24.305
This is being created by great prophets.

01:52:28.595 --> 01:52:31.097
We have to just enlighten it.

01:52:33.846 --> 01:52:36.472
Now, please take your right hand in the lower portion

01:52:36.638 --> 01:52:39.721
of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:52:42.347 --> 01:52:44.971
Lower, lower, lower here.

01:52:49.097 --> 01:52:51.763
This is the center

01:52:51.971 --> 01:52:56.721
for pure divine knowledge.

01:53:03.555 --> 01:53:07.679
Again we raise our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen.

01:53:14.097 --> 01:53:17.721
Then we raise our right hand on our heart.

01:53:22.595 --> 01:53:24.805
Now we raise our right hand

01:53:25.013 --> 01:53:27.138
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

01:53:27.347 --> 01:53:29.388
and turn our head to our right.

01:53:35.347 --> 01:53:37.595
This is the center as I told you –

01:53:40.595 --> 01:53:43.888
I told you this center

01:53:44.097 --> 01:53:47.347
gets in trouble when you feel guilty.

01:53:54.180 --> 01:53:57.971
Now, please take your right hand

01:53:58.180 --> 01:54:02.430
on top of your forehead across and put down your head.

01:54:09.305 --> 01:54:14.180
This is the center where you have to ask forgiveness

01:54:15.595 --> 01:54:18.596
no, no, you have to forgive others, I am sorry.

01:54:19.055 --> 01:54:22.388
This is the center where you have to forgive others.

01:54:25.679 --> 01:54:28.930
Now please take your right hand back side of your head

01:54:29.138 --> 01:54:31.305
and push back your head.

01:54:35.888 --> 01:54:41.721
Here. Here, without feeling guilty,

01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:46.222
without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction

01:54:46.472 --> 01:54:48.721
you have to ask forgiveness

01:54:48.930 --> 01:54:52.055
from the All-pervading Divine Power.

01:55:04.846 --> 01:55:08.805
Now, the last center which is very important.

01:55:11.721 --> 01:55:15.263
Please stretch your palm

01:55:18.638 --> 01:55:21.097
and put the center of your palm

01:55:21.305 --> 01:55:25.222
on top of the fontanel bone area,

01:55:25.430 --> 01:55:27.888
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:55:35.596 --> 01:55:38.180
Now, very important is to push back your fingers,

01:55:38.388 --> 01:55:39.638
there is a good pressure,

01:55:39.846 --> 01:55:42.347
there should be a good pressure on your scalp.

01:55:48.888 --> 01:55:51.430
Now, please put down your head.

01:55:57.305 --> 01:56:03.305
Here now you have to move your scalp seven times, clockwise.

01:56:17.514 --> 01:56:19.595
That’s all we have to do.

01:56:29.596 --> 01:56:32.805
Now you have to close your eyes.

01:56:44.638 --> 01:56:48.180
And till I tell you please don’t open your eyes.

01:56:53.055 --> 01:56:55.055
Just turn it towards Me.

01:56:56.055 --> 01:56:58.971
Both the feet away from each other.

01:57:07.971 --> 01:57:11.721
Now please take out your spectacles.

01:57:17.222 --> 01:57:19.097
No, it doesn't work out here.

01:57:24.180 --> 01:57:26.930
Put your right hand on your heart.

01:57:31.514 --> 01:57:33.555
Now it's better.

01:57:33.846 --> 01:57:38.596
Put it on here. Much better.

01:57:38.846 --> 01:57:42.971
It’s terrible, such heat I’m absorbing from all of them.

01:57:43.514 --> 01:57:47.097
Terrible heat they have. All right, doesn’t matter.

01:57:47.305 --> 01:57:50.430
Please put your right hand on your heart.

01:57:57.472 --> 01:58:01.679
Here now you have to ask Me a very fundamental question

01:58:07.721 --> 01:58:09.971
three times,

01:58:12.263 --> 01:58:16.971
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:58:20.595 --> 01:58:26.595
You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

01:58:31.596 --> 01:58:34.222
It's better now. Little bit [strike] it more.

01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:52.679
I have already told you

01:58:52.888 --> 01:58:57.055
that if you become the Spirit

01:58:57.805 --> 01:59:03.805
you become your own master.

01:59:11.805 --> 01:59:14.180
So, now please take your hand

01:59:14.388 --> 01:59:18.222
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:59:25.472 --> 01:59:31.805
Here, here you have to say again another question.

01:59:38.846 --> 01:59:41.514
Three times please ask,

01:59:41.679 --> 01:59:45.679
“Mother am I my own master?”

02:00:15.555 --> 02:00:19.222
I’ve already told you that I respect your freedom.

02:00:23.180 --> 02:00:27.846
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

02:00:31.930 --> 02:00:34.514
You have to ask for it.

02:00:36.595 --> 02:00:41.555
So, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

02:00:41.971 --> 02:00:45.097
on the left hand side and press it hard.

02:00:51.472 --> 02:00:55.055
Here you have to ask six times,

02:00:55.263 --> 02:00:58.888
because this center has got six petals.

02:01:06.971 --> 02:01:10.472
Please say, “Mother,

02:01:10.805 --> 02:01:14.595
give me pure knowledge.

02:01:14.763 --> 02:01:18.638
Please Mother, give me pure knowledge.” Six times.

02:01:35.805 --> 02:01:39.514
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge

02:01:39.679 --> 02:01:43.638
your Kundalini starts moving upward.

02:01:51.138 --> 02:01:57.138
So now, we have to nourish our higher centers

02:01:57.679 --> 02:02:01.388
so that Kundalini can pass easily through them.

02:02:07.888 --> 02:02:11.763
It has to be nourished with our self confidence.

02:02:15.555 --> 02:02:17.930
So, now please take your right hand

02:02:18.138 --> 02:02:20.930
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:32.430
And here you have to say with full confidence

02:02:32.638 --> 02:02:37.721
ten times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

02:02:37.930 --> 02:02:39.930
Please say it ten times.

02:03:01.222 --> 02:03:04.305
I’ve already told you that you are not this body,

02:03:04.514 --> 02:03:08.222
this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

02:03:08.472 --> 02:03:11.721
but you are pure Spirit.

02:03:21.805 --> 02:03:25.888
So, now please raise your right hand on your heart.

02:03:30.013 --> 02:03:33.595
And here

02:03:33.971 --> 02:03:38.013
with full confidence say twelve times,

02:03:38.347 --> 02:03:45.977
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit.”

02:04:05.615 --> 02:04:10.281
The All-pervading Divine Power is the Ocean

02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:14.073
of divine knowledge.

02:04:21.947 --> 02:04:25.906
It is the Ocean of Compassion and Bliss.

02:04:29.863 --> 02:04:33.365
But above all, it is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

02:04:36.490 --> 02:04:39.156
So whatever mistake you have committed

02:04:39.365 --> 02:04:43.573
can be easily dissolved by this Ocean of Forgiveness.

02:04:52.448 --> 02:04:56.114
So, now please raise your hand

02:04:56.448 --> 02:05:04.198
on to the corner of, between your neck and your shoulder,

02:05:04.406 --> 02:05:07.281
and turn your head to your right.

02:05:14.114 --> 02:05:20.782
Here now with full confidence, please say 16 times,

02:05:20.947 --> 02:05:24.073
“Mother, I’m not guilty at all.”

02:05:31.782 --> 02:05:34.782
Please turn your head to your right.

02:05:46.073 --> 02:05:48.656
I have already told you whether you forgive

02:05:48.863 --> 02:05:51.863
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

02:05:57.740 --> 02:06:02.198
But you torture yourself and play into wrong hands.

02:06:06.863 --> 02:06:09.863
So,

02:06:15.740 --> 02:06:19.323
please take your right hand on top of your forehead

02:06:19.531 --> 02:06:22.406
and put down your head.

02:06:28.573 --> 02:06:33.490
Here you have to forgive everyone in general,

02:06:33.864 --> 02:06:37.782
not how many times, but from your heart.

02:06:45.031 --> 02:06:47.740
If you do not forgive

02:06:47.906 --> 02:06:52.156
then you will also miss your Self Realization,

02:06:52.365 --> 02:06:55.323
because Kundalini cannot pass

02:06:55.531 --> 02:06:58.448
through the constricted Agnya chakra.

02:07:19.239 --> 02:07:23.573
Now, please take back your hand, on the back side of your head,

02:07:23.782 --> 02:07:29.531
and put it up as far as possible.

02:07:38.863 --> 02:07:42.114
Here without feeling guilty,

02:07:44.615 --> 02:07:47.615
without counting your mistakes,

02:07:49.156 --> 02:07:53.656
for your satisfaction you have to say,

02:07:54.198 --> 02:07:56.239
“Oh Divine Power,

02:07:56.448 --> 02:08:00.947
please forgive me, if I have done any mistakes.”

02:08:22.239 --> 02:08:26.989
Now,  this has to be said from your heart,

02:08:27.198 --> 02:08:29.365
not how many times.

02:08:50.864 --> 02:08:54.823
Now, please stretch your palm fully.

02:08:59.656 --> 02:09:02.239
And put the center of your palm

02:09:02.448 --> 02:09:06.490
on top of the fontanel bone area.

02:09:11.406 --> 02:09:14.947
Push back your fingers. Why are you not doing, madam?

02:09:17.031 --> 02:09:20.031
Why is she not doing it? This lady.

02:09:24.198 --> 02:09:26.989
She wants to listen only. She only wants to listen.

02:09:27.198 --> 02:09:29.531
Then let her go away. She should go.

02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:33.365
She should not try to be arrogant like that, not proper.

02:09:49.406 --> 02:09:54.656
All right. Now put your right hand on your fontanel bone area

02:09:59.406 --> 02:10:02.156
and please put down your head.

02:10:06.073 --> 02:10:10.656
Here now, you have to move your scalp

02:10:11.656 --> 02:10:15.239
seven times, clockwise.

02:10:16.906 --> 02:10:19.281
But here again

02:10:19.490 --> 02:10:25.531
I cannot force Self Realization on you.

02:10:36.531 --> 02:10:40.198
You have to ask for your Self Realization.

02:10:43.448 --> 02:10:49.239
So while moving your scalp seven times you should just say,

02:10:49.448 --> 02:10:52.864
“Mother, please give me my Self Realization.”

02:11:09.198 --> 02:11:12.698
Seven times, please.

02:11:19.031 --> 02:11:21.823
Litlle like that. Yes.

02:12:02.615 --> 02:12:05.323
Now please take down your hands.

02:12:16.989 --> 02:12:19.740
Put both the hands like this towards Me.

02:12:21.823 --> 02:12:24.740
Open your eyes.

02:12:26.615 --> 02:12:31.864
Watch Me. Watch Me without thinking, you can do it.

02:12:39.239 --> 02:12:42.406
Now please put right hand towards Me.

02:12:44.863 --> 02:12:48.365
And put down your head and see with your left hand

02:12:48.573 --> 02:12:53.615
if there is a cool or a warm breeze coming out of your head.

02:13:03.406 --> 02:13:06.365
You shouldn’t put your hand on top of your head,

02:13:09.863 --> 02:13:12.863
but away from it.

02:13:17.864 --> 02:13:20.863
Now please put your left hand towards Me.

02:13:24.698 --> 02:13:27.281
And now bend your head and see with your right hand

02:13:27.490 --> 02:13:29.947
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

02:13:30.156 --> 02:13:33.490
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

02:13:44.281 --> 02:13:48.031
Now please put your right hand towards Me again

02:13:48.239 --> 02:13:50.864
and with the left hand you can see it again.

02:14:09.947 --> 02:14:14.281
Now raise both your hands towards the sky

02:14:17.989 --> 02:14:20.615
and ask a question

02:14:20.823 --> 02:14:24.573
one of these three questions, anyone of them, three times.

02:14:28.823 --> 02:14:32.156
Push back your head and ask the question,

02:14:32.406 --> 02:14:35.531
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

02:14:42.323 --> 02:14:45.198
Or ask the question three times,

02:14:45.406 --> 02:14:50.031
“Mother, is this the All-pervading Power of Divine Love?”

02:14:56.239 --> 02:14:58.863
Or ask the question three times,

02:14:59.031 --> 02:15:01.615
“Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

02:15:08.031 --> 02:15:10.323
Please take down your hands.

02:15:12.239 --> 02:15:14.448
It’s hot.

02:15:15.365 --> 02:15:21.323
All those who have felt cool breeze

02:15:22.281 --> 02:15:27.490
or hot breeze from their fontanel bone area

02:15:27.782 --> 02:15:32.365
or on their fingertips or on their palms

02:15:32.863 --> 02:15:35.863
please raise both your hands.

02:15:49.239 --> 02:15:51.863
The whole of Austria.

02:15:52.031 --> 02:15:55.573
May God bless you all! May God bless you! May God bless you!

02:16:00.531 --> 02:16:02.782
Vienna!

02:16:03.239 --> 02:16:08.198
I bow to you all. You have now started your saintly life.

02:16:13.615 --> 02:16:17.656
Now respect, respect your Self Realization.

02:16:21.989 --> 02:16:26.073
Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening.

02:16:30.989 --> 02:16:33.864
You cannot do it individually.

02:16:35.906 --> 02:16:38.490
Of course, at home you can meditate,

02:16:38.698 --> 02:16:42.239
but you have to come to collective to grow.

02:16:48.156 --> 02:16:51.198
Like this finger, if it is sick,

02:16:51.406 --> 02:16:55.323
the whole body runs for the help of this.

02:16:56.114 --> 02:17:00.863
In the same way now you have become the whole.

02:17:08.863 --> 02:17:13.031
The microcosm has become the macrocosm.

02:17:17.863 --> 02:17:23.281
You’ll have so many blessings and so many miracles

02:17:23.615 --> 02:17:26.740
that you may not believe them even.

02:17:34.823 --> 02:17:41.156
And you’ll be amazed how fantastically you are so glorious.

02:17:48.281 --> 02:17:52.281
But you must learn how to use this power.

02:17:56.823 --> 02:18:00.863
You’ll hardly take a month to master it.

02:18:06.448 --> 02:18:09.740
You don’t have to pay for this at all.

02:18:13.031 --> 02:18:16.823
No one is going to pay for it,

02:18:17.782 --> 02:18:21.239
only thing you have to give little time

02:18:21.573 --> 02:18:24.281
for your Self Realization.

02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:37.740
May God bless you all!
