00:01.960 --> 00:06.120
It's been two years since Shri Mataji came to Sydney and

00:06.400 --> 00:10.000
many people have joined Sahaja Yoga and

00:10.280 --> 00:12.960
many people will remember Her.

00:13.160 --> 00:16.880
Many people are developing their realization

00:17.160 --> 00:20.360
and it's a great experience that's happening

00:20.560 --> 00:24.720
not only of course in Sydney but all over the world.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.360
Sahaja Yoga is a happening,

00:27.600 --> 00:30.880
it's an actualization of something that lies within us.

00:31.120 --> 00:36.400
The subtle body that is represented here on the chart

00:36.640 --> 00:39.480
is a map or a chart of our inner mechanism

00:39.800 --> 00:43.960
that mechanism of our subtle body which

00:44.720 --> 00:47.360
doctors can't of course see,

00:47.560 --> 00:53.080
or operate on but which lies quietly working

00:53.720 --> 00:57.720
as the basis of our whole human existence.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.360
Within that subtle body

01:00.560 --> 01:04.600
there is system of what we call centers or chakras

01:04.840 --> 01:07.280
and those chakras are the

01:07.480 --> 01:10.840
I suppose we could call them, energy centers which

01:11.480 --> 01:15.480
give us at first the vitality

01:16.120 --> 01:19.080
for physical existence but

01:19.320 --> 01:24.160
as we develop, as we evolve into higher of human beings,

01:24.480 --> 01:29.320
they become slowly to stage where

01:29.880 --> 01:34.080
they can be enlightened.

01:34.400 --> 01:39.000
We become aware of the seeking within each one of us.

01:39.200 --> 01:44.160
We become aware of that inner subtlety that is always there

01:44.360 --> 01:47.880
but which due to our human existence,

01:48.120 --> 01:50.520
we become disconnected from.

01:50.720 --> 01:52.160
What is this subtlety?

01:52.360 --> 01:56.880
The subtlety is the eternal Spirit of Almighty God,

01:57.080 --> 02:01.880
that aspect of God which lies quietly,

02:02.080 --> 02:04.680
the witness to all that we do but

02:04.880 --> 02:08.760
not manifesting in our daily being.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.880
The Spirit is what we have to become,

02:12.120 --> 02:16.200
it's what Christ has said, "We have to become the Spirit."

02:16.520 --> 02:20.960
It's what Mohammed said, it's what the Buddha said,

02:21.600 --> 02:25.960
it's what all the Hindu philosophers, all the Hindu saints

02:26.200 --> 02:28.840
and all the great incarnations that  have come on this earth,

02:29.040 --> 02:30.280
have said.

02:30.480 --> 02:34.000
"You have to become the Spirit." You have to be born again.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.440
And what is this being born again?

02:36.640 --> 02:40.200
So many people hear about re-birth,

02:40.440 --> 02:44.160
hear about being born again. Cults that are developing,

02:44.400 --> 02:46.440
talking about being born again

02:46.640 --> 02:51.920
and yet it's actually only mental activity at that stage.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.120
You have to become something, you have to get your own powers,

02:56.320 --> 02:59.360
you have to be able to maneuver those powers

02:59.640 --> 03:03.640
before we can speak of being a realized soul.

03:04.200 --> 03:09.680
You actually develop within yourself an awareness,

03:09.880 --> 03:14.080
but not only an awareness but a practical capacity

03:14.360 --> 03:17.800
to become a spiritual person.

03:18.000 --> 03:21.680
For all these lifetimes we've been a human being.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.680
We've reached the stage in evolution now where,

03:24.880 --> 03:27.840
we can just go that extra stage further

03:28.040 --> 03:30.880
to become a spiritual being.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.680
Now whose going to do the job? How does it happen?

03:34.880 --> 03:40.880
What is the mechanism within us that allows this process to work?

03:41.960 --> 03:45.400
Until recently meaning,

03:45.640 --> 03:49.920
until the last ten years,

03:50.480 --> 03:53.200
this process has been one whereby

03:53.400 --> 03:57.400
individuals and perhaps on a one to one basis

03:57.720 --> 04:01.440
a few people got their Self Realization.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.760
It was almost as if that first on the tree of life there were

04:04.960 --> 04:08.880
just a few flowers and those flowers turned to fruit.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.560
But now the grace of God is completely overflowing,

04:14.760 --> 04:17.520
He wants everybody to have it,

04:17.720 --> 04:21.680
He wants us to take that last step in our evolution

04:21.880 --> 04:26.000
and we all have to get our Self Realization.

04:26.360 --> 04:29.760
And yet it seems too simple, it seems too easy,

04:29.960 --> 04:35.360
it seems too much something which cannot happen

04:35.560 --> 04:37.760
in such a beautiful simple way.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.120
And yet that's precisely what it is.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.160
So many people are looking for a complex explanation

04:44.360 --> 04:45.920
of Self-Realization.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.280
So many people are looking in books

04:49.640 --> 04:51.680
to find out how you get it.

04:51.880 --> 04:54.040
Others are going to gurus,

04:54.240 --> 04:59.840
others are seeking it in the highways and byways of various forms of

05:00.040 --> 05:05.480
perhaps even area of fringed seeking such as parapsychology

05:05.680 --> 05:09.840
and ESP and clairvoyance and a hundred other

05:10.040 --> 05:13.920
isms and methods so called as spiritual seeking.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.920
And yet it's so simple.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.760
What happens is that the subtle energy within us

05:19.960 --> 05:22.160
which lies in that triangular bone

05:22.400 --> 05:25.200
that is at the base of the chart and which is in fact

05:25.400 --> 05:27.680
our sacrum at the base of the spine,

05:27.880 --> 05:32.240
that subtle energy has to rise and when it rises

05:32.480 --> 05:34.800
it passes through each of the centers

05:35.000 --> 05:37.480
that are shown graphically on the chart

05:37.680 --> 05:41.760
and finally pierces through this chakra at the top of the head,

05:41.960 --> 05:46.680
and you begin to feel on your hands, the cool vibrations.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.880
You begin to feel those same cool vibrations

05:49.080 --> 05:51.680
coming from the top of the head,

05:51.880 --> 05:55.160
you begin to become one with God.

05:55.520 --> 05:59.840
You become a complete personality, you become integrated.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.760
So what is this happening and how does it happen so simply?

06:04.960 --> 06:07.880
It's almost as if,

06:08.160 --> 06:11.280
we with our Western,

06:11.600 --> 06:16.680
rather torturous minds, want a complex explanation.

06:16.880 --> 06:21.600
So, we go to complex disciplines, we read complex books,

06:21.800 --> 06:25.040
we do all sorts of exercises,

06:25.280 --> 06:30.400
we strive, we pray, we do so many things which

06:30.680 --> 06:35.880
attain very, very little in the sense of real achievement.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.680
And so, we have to get it.

06:40.880 --> 06:45.680
And before us is a person who is an enlightened being

06:45.880 --> 06:50.880
and She is one who not only promises to give it,

06:51.120 --> 06:55.880
not only talks about the process of Self Realization,

06:56.160 --> 06:58.680
not only brings you to the logical conclusion that

06:58.880 --> 07:01.280
you have to achieve something higher,

07:01.560 --> 07:03.880
but She can actually do the job.

07:04.120 --> 07:07.680
She can actually give you the experience of Self Realization

07:07.880 --> 07:09.440
and you can begin to feel it

07:09.640 --> 07:13.880
as those same cool vibrations that I spoke about.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.800
You begin to feel the cool vibrations that were referred to

07:17.000 --> 07:21.880
by the Lord Jesus Christ as the cool wind of the Holy Spirit.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.400
You begin to feel

07:23.640 --> 07:28.880
the cool vibrations that Mohammad referred to as the Ruh,

07:29.080 --> 07:33.920
that the Hindu teachers referred to as the chaitanya.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.760
You begin to feel it. Not only do you feel it on your hands but

07:37.960 --> 07:40.240
you feel it emitting from the top of the head,

07:40.480 --> 07:42.200
from this center here.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.200
And so, logically

07:45.520 --> 07:49.800
and within the sensitivity

07:50.000 --> 07:54.080
and consciously within your central nervous system

07:54.280 --> 07:58.800
you begin to perceive the experience of Self Realization.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.800
The Kundalini rises, it ignites the flame of the Spirit which lies

08:04.000 --> 08:07.880
dormant in the heart, just the witness,

08:08.120 --> 08:11.240
and you become connected to Almighty God.

08:11.480 --> 08:16.600
You become one with the All-Pervading power of God.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.680
When this brain of Divinity, which lies within each one of us

08:20.880 --> 08:24.880
which is only just a reflection of Almighty God within us,

08:25.080 --> 08:29.680
actually unites with Almighty God

08:29.880 --> 08:31.280
in a very real way.

08:31.520 --> 08:36.200
This is what happens, when Self-Realization takes place

08:36.400 --> 08:40.240
and after it happens you get your own powers.

08:40.560 --> 08:41.920
You become your own guru.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.880
You don't slavishly have to follow anything.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.400
You don't have to read any more books.

08:47.680 --> 08:51.160
You can become quite selective about the type of food you eat

08:51.360 --> 08:55.880
and the type of exercises you do.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.320
You choose according to the type of temperament you are,

08:59.520 --> 09:02.400
that type of food, or activity, or

09:02.640 --> 09:05.120
exercise or whatever it is, which is

09:05.360 --> 09:07.880
particularly suitable to your tendency

09:08.080 --> 09:10.560
and which will bring you into that balance,

09:10.760 --> 09:14.200
which Self Realization expresses.

09:14.560 --> 09:19.680
And so, if before us, is sitting one who can do the job,

09:19.880 --> 09:24.320
and all we have to do is simply hold our hands up to Her,

09:24.720 --> 09:26.800
She must be somebody rather special,

09:27.000 --> 09:30.160
especially if it happens so simply.

09:30.400 --> 09:35.400
Our logical mind or perhaps even I should say, our rational mind

09:35.680 --> 09:37.800
will question it.

09:38.000 --> 09:42.160
It will ask all sorts of complicated questions.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.480
It will ask whether She is real,

09:46.720 --> 09:49.240
it will ask whether the experience that you are feeling is

09:49.520 --> 09:50.680
perhaps not the air conditioning

09:50.880 --> 09:54.320
I just hear that it seems to gone off,

09:54.600 --> 09:55.880
all sorts of things,

09:56.080 --> 09:59.960
coming to our rational mind and we put barriers in the place.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.080
What actually happens at that moment is

10:02.320 --> 10:04.920
the Kundalini that rises through the central channel

10:05.160 --> 10:06.880
gets blocked at this point,

10:07.120 --> 10:12.520
where as you can probably see the two left and the right channels

10:12.720 --> 10:15.960
create what we call our ego and our super ego

10:16.160 --> 10:19.720
what psychologists have often called

10:19.920 --> 10:22.920
the intuitive mind and the mechanical mind

10:23.160 --> 10:26.880
or which Freud referred to, when he was talking about the id

10:27.120 --> 10:29.880
being the super ego.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.080
Not that Freud was an expert on this

10:32.320 --> 10:36.000
He dealt with one side only and in fact

10:36.240 --> 10:39.280
in our opinion has done a lot of harm.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.360
So, the Kundalini rises to this point

10:43.640 --> 10:48.360
and these two balloons actually block the rising of the Kundalini

10:48.600 --> 10:52.960
when, in fact, we use rational methods to reach God.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.880
So we have to go a step further.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.360
We have to say I have not reached it rationally,

10:58.600 --> 11:01.680
I have not reached it by my striving,

11:01.880 --> 11:05.360
I am a seeker, I love God,

11:05.600 --> 11:09.360
I want the ultimate, I want that union with God,

11:09.600 --> 11:11.400
so how do I get it?

11:11.600 --> 11:16.720
So if there is somebody who is an enlightened light

11:16.920 --> 11:19.920
and if that principle of the candle,

11:20.160 --> 11:23.800
of one light enlightening another is true,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.120
then, this can happen to you tonight.

11:26.320 --> 11:30.800
And it does happen to thousands all over the world.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.680
There are Sahaja Yogis

11:33.880 --> 11:37.760
all over the world who are growing

11:37.960 --> 11:42.280
in the awareness within themselves of the nature of their spirit

11:42.520 --> 11:47.280
who are Realized souls but who are attaining their ultimate,

11:47.560 --> 11:48.960
who are finding that their health

11:49.160 --> 11:51.760
both mental and physical is improving,

11:51.960 --> 11:55.920
who is finding a great deal more joy in their life,

11:56.200 --> 11:58.680
who are finding that they overcome the stresses

11:58.880 --> 12:01.480
and strains of modern living

12:01.760 --> 12:06.720
and who themselves become a powerhouse of that dynamic force,

12:06.920 --> 12:10.120
which thinks and loves and coordinates

12:10.360 --> 12:13.160
and does all of those things which,

12:13.360 --> 12:18.200
in our imagination, we see as the job of God.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.680
You develop your own powers,

12:20.880 --> 12:23.280
you don't slavishly follow any guru.

12:23.560 --> 12:28.080
Mother is only here to enlighten that which is your own

12:28.320 --> 12:31.080
and so, when She does the job,

12:31.280 --> 12:33.320
you become a complete personality,

12:33.520 --> 12:37.680
you can give Realization to others,

12:37.880 --> 12:39.680
you become very dynamic

12:39.880 --> 12:43.800
and it works out in a very, very wonderful way

12:44.000 --> 12:46.800
that so many people are transformed.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.520
What you were yesterday, what you were last year

12:51.720 --> 12:55.040
is not what you are today.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.400
After Realization you can do something about

12:58.600 --> 13:01.160
the complications of modern living.

13:01.400 --> 13:06.000
You can actually see the transformation in yourself and others

13:06.240 --> 13:09.680
and you begin to enjoy the beauty of the Spirit.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.680
Ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to again introduce

13:12.880 --> 13:16.400
to some of you but to many for the first time,

13:16.640 --> 13:20.880
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

13:41.560 --> 13:45.960
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

13:47.120 --> 13:50.160
But before

13:50.360 --> 13:54.480
we come to right conclusion

13:54.680 --> 13:58.040
about our seeking

13:59.080 --> 14:01.200
we have to understand

14:01.400 --> 14:06.880
that truth is not a mental action.

14:08.160 --> 14:13.680
If your mind says that this is this, it need not be that.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.040
It is our everyday experience in life,

14:17.240 --> 14:21.680
that mentally when we try to establish something

14:21.880 --> 14:24.040
we find after some time

14:24.280 --> 14:28.880
that we have not been absolutely correct about it.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.120
Whatever is known to us is already there

14:32.400 --> 14:34.240
but whatever is unknown,

14:34.440 --> 14:37.960
even about that, if you have pre-conceived ideas

14:38.200 --> 14:42.400
that this is the unknown, this is God, this is Spirit,

14:42.600 --> 14:48.880
then, it could be that you are very much away from the truth.

14:50.160 --> 14:54.880
But scientifically if you have to approach any subject

14:55.080 --> 15:00.960
you have to keep your mind absolutely clean and open.

15:01.360 --> 15:06.040
That it has been said by many great saints,

15:06.280 --> 15:11.160
many great gurus, that we are to be born again

15:11.400 --> 15:14.280
and that we are the Spirit.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.520
Are we to believe in them or not?

15:17.800 --> 15:22.360
Perhaps we should reach at least this conclusion,

15:22.560 --> 15:25.680
that they did not take any money from anyone

15:25.880 --> 15:28.000
and they could not have been fake people.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.760
They did not do it for money sake.

15:31.960 --> 15:36.120
So, if we have to be born again,

15:36.360 --> 15:38.000
to reach the right conclusion

15:38.200 --> 15:39.920
we should know what should happen to us.

15:40.160 --> 15:44.040
For example, if you certify that "I am a born again"

15:44.240 --> 15:46.120
then it is misleading.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.960
Supposing I self certify Myself

15:48.160 --> 15:52.760
that I am the Prime Minister of Australia. do I become?

15:52.960 --> 15:54.880
I have to become.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.600
So just by taking a certificate we are cheating ourselves

15:58.800 --> 16:02.040
and avoiding the opportunity to be born again.

16:02.280 --> 16:05.680
So to be honest is the first

16:05.880 --> 16:09.000
way we can really be the seekers of truth.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.680
If you are not honest and if you have preconceived ideas

16:11.880 --> 16:16.000
you want to stick to it, then I would say it is rather difficult.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.680
But logically we should come to a point where we should understand

16:19.880 --> 16:24.960
that what should happen, when we receive the truth,

16:25.200 --> 16:29.800
in our evolutionary process what has happened to us.

16:30.000 --> 16:34.280
Actually, our awareness has been enlightened in new dimensions

16:34.520 --> 16:37.680
as we grew up in our evolution.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.880
An animal does not understand filth and dirt.

16:41.120 --> 16:44.000
You can take a horse through any dirty lane

16:44.200 --> 16:47.680
but a human being is very sensitive, he has to close his nose

16:47.880 --> 16:52.880
or sometimes he even refuses to go through that.

16:53.720 --> 16:57.720
So, in our awareness something has to happen

16:57.960 --> 17:01.560
and that is not some sort of an abnormal thing.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.800
Like some people, I was told, have written books

17:04.000 --> 17:06.880
that you have to become mad to be evolved.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.120
I mean in what evolutionary stage did it happen?

17:10.320 --> 17:11.800
Did the fishes became mad

17:12.000 --> 17:17.880
to become the higher animals?

17:18.080 --> 17:21.520
When did it happen that you had to become mad to evolve?

17:21.720 --> 17:23.680
Is a wrong idea that people give,

17:23.880 --> 17:28.200
because they can only make you mad, nothing else.

17:28.720 --> 17:32.680
And you like it, because one way they pamper your ego by saying

17:32.880 --> 17:35.360
that you can pay for them and secondly

17:35.640 --> 17:39.400
they also give you a feeling that you are something different.

17:39.720 --> 17:43.680
To be something different is not to be evolved.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.680
We have so many mad people in this world,

17:45.880 --> 17:49.360
we have so many epileptic people, we have so many people who jump

17:49.640 --> 17:52.480
all over the places. There's nothing great about it.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.000
Whatever you can do easily is to jump

17:55.200 --> 17:58.120
or to shout or to scream or to misbehave.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.520
All these things are very easy for human-beings to do.

18:01.720 --> 18:04.680
But if something has to happen from the Divine

18:04.880 --> 18:06.680
and if it is a living process,

18:06.880 --> 18:12.880
then something should happen within us, which is not in our reach,

18:13.640 --> 18:17.360
which is the, something that is beyond the human reach.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.840
That has to be this Divine thing.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.360
So we must understand that in our seeking

18:22.640 --> 18:28.520
what we have to seek is a higher dimension to our awareness.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.680
In that dimension you have to become something.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.680
Like you have become a human being,

18:33.880 --> 18:37.040
you are no more a monkey, you are a human being now.

18:37.280 --> 18:40.080
In the same way you have to become something.

18:40.320 --> 18:44.400
In Sanskrit language, a brahmin, a person who is a realized soul,

18:44.640 --> 18:47.160
the one who knows the Brahma, the All Pervading power,

18:47.360 --> 18:50.880
is called as dwijaha, means born again.

18:51.120 --> 18:55.400
And also a bird is called as dwijaha.

18:55.680 --> 18:58.240
A bird is first born as an egg

18:58.520 --> 19:00.960
and then it is born as a bird.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.000
There's complete transformation.

19:03.200 --> 19:06.680
You don't have to certify a bird that it is no more an egg

19:06.880 --> 19:11.080
it just becomes, you see it's true that it becomes.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.240
So those who are honest and those who are really seeking

19:14.480 --> 19:17.800
must know that you have to become something.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.360
It's not just that you become mad

19:20.600 --> 19:23.880
or you become like some sort of a funny, freaky fellow,

19:24.080 --> 19:28.680
but you become really something that is in your awareness.

19:28.880 --> 19:31.440
Now if you have to go to science we'll find out

19:31.680 --> 19:35.760
that Jung, who was a realized soul, who got Realization much later,

19:35.960 --> 19:37.680
and then he defied Freud,

19:37.880 --> 19:41.520
has clearly said that if a human being evolves,

19:41.720 --> 19:47.000
he'll have to become collectively conscious,

19:47.520 --> 19:53.360
his consciousness becomes collectively aware.

19:54.120 --> 19:58.680
Meaning that you should feel others

19:58.880 --> 20:04.880
within yourself on your finger tips.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.400
Mohammad Sahab has said,

20:06.880 --> 20:11.880
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak".

20:12.560 --> 20:14.080
Your hands have to speak.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.320
Now the hands have no tongues to speak, so what happens?

20:17.600 --> 20:20.040
It is accepted in the medical science

20:20.240 --> 20:25.880
that the sympathetic

20:26.080 --> 20:30.880
nervous system is expressed in your seven centers,

20:31.120 --> 20:34.040
on your fingers but they don't know which are where and how it is.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.960
They, they cannot quote it and they are honest about it.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.960
But they say there is some sympathetic connection

20:40.160 --> 20:42.760
with the fingertips.

20:42.960 --> 20:47.320
So in your awareness it has to happen

20:47.600 --> 20:50.120
by which you have to be more alert,

20:50.320 --> 20:55.520
more normal, more dynamic,

20:55.760 --> 21:01.880
more beautiful, more loving, more understanding.

21:02.160 --> 21:06.880
So something has to happen to your central nervous-system.

21:07.160 --> 21:11.280
It must be apparent that you are feeling something more

21:11.520 --> 21:14.880
in your central nervous system.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.680
Now what people are enamored is that

21:17.880 --> 21:21.920
if they see some people dancing madly, they feel enamored.

21:22.160 --> 21:27.880
Is a sign that you have not been able to understand.

21:28.440 --> 21:30.800
We have seen Christ,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.040
we have seen Buddha, Mahavira,

21:34.240 --> 21:38.400
Kabira, Nanaka, we had Laotse

21:38.640 --> 21:41.840
and so many others.

21:42.040 --> 21:46.560
Did they behave like this? Did they become mad?

21:46.760 --> 21:50.000
We have got Moses. Did he become mad anytime?

21:50.200 --> 21:54.120
Was he mad anytime, behaving like a mad person?

21:54.360 --> 21:57.880
All these new theories have started, I think, fifty years back

21:58.120 --> 22:00.360
or about sixty years back, that

22:00.640 --> 22:05.000
people believe in these new theories and they have forgotten all the

22:05.240 --> 22:08.400
traditional things that have come to us, our heritage.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.680
And we depend more on these non-nonsensical things

22:11.880 --> 22:14.920
which has no moorings at all,

22:15.120 --> 22:18.320
because the people who are supposed to be

22:18.560 --> 22:21.400
the founders of all the religions have never behaved like this

22:21.680 --> 22:24.240
and why this new type of thing that has started

22:24.480 --> 22:26.680
that people are behaving in this manner

22:26.880 --> 22:31.320
and accepting it to be a very normal thing.

22:31.880 --> 22:36.080
So all the seekers must know that you have to become the Spirit

22:36.280 --> 22:39.760
means you must feel your own powers.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.880
It is not that you feel the powers of another person,

22:43.080 --> 22:46.920
now he is a person who brings out some diamonds for you. So what?

22:47.160 --> 22:50.680
Logically you reach a conclusion

22:50.880 --> 22:54.680
do you want diamonds or do you want your Spirit?

22:54.880 --> 22:56.240
You can buy them in the market.

22:56.480 --> 22:58.800
Why do you need a guru to do that kind of a job?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.680
There must be some jugglery.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.480
All days of these spiritual juggleries are on

23:04.680 --> 23:10.360
and when I came here from Perth onward, Melbourne, Adelaide and here

23:10.600 --> 23:13.880
everywhere all the people of the media have been asking Me

23:14.080 --> 23:16.880
that why these gurus have come from India

23:17.120 --> 23:19.680
and they have ruined us like this. They have so many Rolls Royces

23:19.880 --> 23:21.800
and they have things and that and that.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.680
I said, thank God now at least you are realizing.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.040
But I went to America and told them long time back

23:28.280 --> 23:31.480
that these people are going to come and be careful about them.

23:31.680 --> 23:36.200
Has been already told about it but people did not want to follow it.

23:36.400 --> 23:38.120
They thought that it is better

23:38.320 --> 23:40.680
that you accept a guru, live with him

23:40.880 --> 23:44.280
and that when he goes to Heaven means Hell actually,

23:44.520 --> 23:47.320
you will be there.

23:47.960 --> 23:53.880
Now, I'm very happy that an awareness is coming to the seekers that

23:54.640 --> 23:58.880
lot of them are realizing that they have not found the truth.

23:59.080 --> 24:02.000
If you are reaching that conclusion

24:02.200 --> 24:06.800
that you have to find the truth within yourself

24:07.000 --> 24:10.960
then, Sahaja Yoga will work much wonders.

24:12.200 --> 24:18.120
Now, our evolutionary process has not been anything which is dead.

24:18.720 --> 24:21.000
It is a living process.

24:21.200 --> 24:24.920
There is a force within us which brings forth our evolution.

24:25.160 --> 24:29.120
And living process cannot be activated by mental activity.

24:29.360 --> 24:33.680
For example, if you put a seed in the Mother Earth

24:33.880 --> 24:37.680
it sprouts by itself. By saying that, "you better sprout now"

24:37.880 --> 24:39.680
or by saying that "it has sprouted"

24:39.880 --> 24:41.680
you'll have just mental satisfaction

24:41.880 --> 24:46.760
of creating an imaginary image, but actually it has to happen.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.320
The happening has to take place and this happening

24:50.520 --> 24:55.680
is built within you, that has to happen within your being

24:55.880 --> 24:59.680
and is already you are destined for it.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.040
As he has told you that lies this

25:02.240 --> 25:06.280
triangular bone which is very inconspicuous,

25:06.480 --> 25:08.800
you can't even see that. I think it is drawn very small.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.880
We should really enlarge it and show.

25:11.080 --> 25:15.840
That is the triangular bone within us, which contains this force,

25:16.040 --> 25:18.680
called as the Kundalini.

25:18.880 --> 25:22.000
Now regarding Kundalini you must have read many books also.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.080
In India, I saw some books, I was amazed,

25:25.280 --> 25:27.920
written by mostly foreigners. Such big books and they didn’t know

25:28.120 --> 25:31.760
where the Kundalini was, in the stomach or in the nose.

25:31.960 --> 25:34.360
Such confused people need not have written.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.120
If you are confused, better not talk about it.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.160
You see, if you are confused about something

25:39.400 --> 25:42.080
what's the use of talking that "this was the confusion,

25:42.280 --> 25:45.680
I got a shock and I got a heat" and all this? Then why do you talk?

25:45.880 --> 25:47.800
You don't know anything, you have no authority

25:48.000 --> 25:49.400
so you have no business to talk about it.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.480
That means you are naive or you have been,

25:52.680 --> 25:57.680
just been absolutely a person

25:57.880 --> 26:00.120
who is uneducated about it.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.480
Why should you talk when you are not in authority?

26:02.680 --> 26:04.400
Not only talk but write.

26:04.640 --> 26:06.920
And books after books have been written by people

26:07.120 --> 26:09.680
who have no authority to write these books.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.880
And that's how they have created another myth,

26:12.120 --> 26:13.600
that Kundalini awakening

26:13.800 --> 26:16.200
is the most dangerous thing and one should not do.

26:16.440 --> 26:22.280
Now, imagine, what a mistake it is!

26:22.880 --> 26:25.920
Who is the photographer?

26:28.720 --> 26:32.200
It's all right. So what is the,

26:32.440 --> 26:36.280
what is the advantage

26:36.560 --> 26:41.680
in this kind of spreading news that Kundalini awakening,

26:41.880 --> 26:45.080
which is the epitome of your evolution,

26:45.320 --> 26:48.360
which is what human beings have to achieve in their life

26:48.560 --> 26:51.520
that's the aim of their life to be the Spirit

26:51.720 --> 26:53.880
and Kundalini is the only way it happens,

26:54.160 --> 26:56.680
so why should people talk like this

26:56.880 --> 27:00.360
and say it is dangerous to have the Kundalini awakened?

27:00.600 --> 27:03.320
Because, why they are doing it?

27:03.560 --> 27:08.880
Because they are under some anti-God activity.

27:09.200 --> 27:14.680
Because they are not with God.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.040
There's some sort of a sinister,

27:17.240 --> 27:20.080
satanic force, which is telling these things to people

27:20.320 --> 27:22.920
that you should not have your Kundalini awakened.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.720
Imagine it is like

27:24.920 --> 27:27.800
saying that you should not enter into the Kingdom of God.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.880
If that is the only way if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God

27:32.080 --> 27:33.960
why should you frighten people about it?

27:34.160 --> 27:36.720
There's nothing frightening about Kundalini awakening,

27:36.920 --> 27:40.760
I can assure you. I've had, as you know,

27:40.960 --> 27:42.880
I've been working for years together

27:43.120 --> 27:47.360
and so many people have got Realization,

27:47.640 --> 27:53.320
en-mass, and nobody has got any problems like that.

27:53.680 --> 27:56.680
Sometimes of course you feel little heat in the body, sometimes,

27:56.880 --> 27:58.840
do feel little heat in the body,

27:59.040 --> 28:01.040
sometimes you feel a little shaking in the body,

28:01.280 --> 28:03.040
if there is a problem in the body,

28:03.240 --> 28:05.680
if your nerves are tensed and anything.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.680
The Kundalini, when She rises, She little bit shakes you

28:08.880 --> 28:12.280
but it settles down. Settles you down completely

28:12.520 --> 28:16.120
and you feel absolutely blissful and peaceful.

28:16.360 --> 28:19.480
No problem is created I have seen so far

28:19.680 --> 28:22.760
which can be called anywhere near danger.

28:22.960 --> 28:26.400
On the contrary when Kundalini rises,

28:26.680 --> 28:29.800
She gives so many by-products to begin with.

28:30.000 --> 28:35.200
Of course She is the power of pure desire within you.

28:35.400 --> 28:39.280
The only desire that is pure in human beings is

28:39.520 --> 28:41.240
to be one with the Divine.

28:41.520 --> 28:47.320
All other desires are not pure, because they do not give pure joy.

28:47.920 --> 28:51.400
You think of anything, you want to, say, have a car.

28:51.600 --> 28:57.200
All right. Good. Work for it, try your level best to achieve that.

28:57.480 --> 29:00.680
Then you have the car then you want to have something else.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.680
If that was your pure desire it would have given you

29:03.880 --> 29:06.240
complete joy and satisfaction. It is not so.

29:06.480 --> 29:09.240
So matter is making you just run from one to another

29:09.480 --> 29:13.680
but doesn't give you joy. So the pure desire in a human being

29:13.880 --> 29:17.360
is this great desire to be one with the Divine.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.520
If you do not accept it today you will come tomorrow.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.280
You will have to take it because nothing is going to satisfy you

29:24.520 --> 29:27.000
unless and until you receive the truth,

29:27.200 --> 29:29.760
you become one with the Divine.

29:29.960 --> 29:32.960
People may, I've seen people deny it for the time being,

29:33.200 --> 29:36.160
"I'm not ready". That's another style is, "I'm not ready"

29:36.360 --> 29:38.280
and all sorts of things people say.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.440
But I say "Let Me decide".

29:40.680 --> 29:44.240
Why are you worried? Let Me decide if you are ready or not,

29:44.440 --> 29:46.760
what is the problem is, it can be worked out.

29:46.960 --> 29:52.120
I have really worked for years together to know all the permutations

29:52.320 --> 29:55.680
and combinations and the problems and the barriers you have.

29:55.880 --> 30:00.680
And it is not going to take any time for you. It's very simple

30:00.880 --> 30:03.160
it's a living process, it is not going to trouble you.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.200
Why should you have fright about it?

30:05.400 --> 30:08.080
So this is one side of Kundalini awakening.

30:08.320 --> 30:12.680
The other side is, where people think that

30:12.880 --> 30:18.320
it can be done by themselves. It cannot be done by yourself.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.280
Somebody has to do it for you

30:20.480 --> 30:23.400
and then once you get it you can do it for others.

30:23.680 --> 30:26.680
Now for example a candle which is enlightened

30:26.880 --> 30:29.160
can only enlighten another candle.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.000
By itself a candle cannot enlighten.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.040
But for that you have to have a real person.

30:35.240 --> 30:38.480
A person who knows everything about the Kundalini,

30:38.680 --> 30:40.440
one who can awaken your Kundalini

30:40.640 --> 30:43.320
and not a person who is already shocked by Kundalini

30:43.520 --> 30:45.680
or who just talks about Kundalini

30:45.880 --> 30:48.680
or he makes people jump all over the places.

30:48.880 --> 30:52.680
There was a guru in India who used to give Kundalini awakening

30:52.880 --> 30:55.720
and where this Dr. Warren went first of all

30:55.920 --> 30:59.120
and they all were jumping and saying ha ha, hoo hoo, hee hee, hey

30:59.360 --> 31:01.200
and he got such a fright seeing them

31:01.400 --> 31:04.000
and he thought "It's a lunatic asylum here"

31:04.200 --> 31:06.760
and he ran away from that place and came to Me and he said,

31:06.960 --> 31:09.680
'Mother don't give Me awakening because I am frightened of it'.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.400
I said that's not awakening.

31:11.640 --> 31:15.200
That's not. That is hypnosis, a kind of a hypnosis

31:15.400 --> 31:18.680
and that hypnosis will create such problems. That's not Kundalini.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.680
She's your Mother

31:21.880 --> 31:24.480
and She's waiting for days together

31:24.720 --> 31:27.480
for ages together, many lives She has waited

31:27.680 --> 31:31.120
for this great opportunity to give you your second birth.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.320
But so far you have not allowed Her to do Her work

31:34.600 --> 31:37.680
because mentally you are equipped with all books in your head

31:37.880 --> 31:40.680
or all gurus in your head or all kinds of ideas in your head,

31:40.880 --> 31:43.320
and She, poor thing, is waiting for that

31:43.520 --> 31:47.720
to manifest your second birth.

31:47.920 --> 31:51.760
And that is a big problem how to make people understand

31:51.960 --> 31:56.160
that by mental activity you cannot raise the Kundalini.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.080
I may give you lectures after lectures,

31:59.280 --> 32:02.080
not necessary that your Kundalini will rise.

32:02.320 --> 32:06.280
But it will rise when I pay attention to it.

32:06.480 --> 32:08.680
And if you get your Realization

32:08.880 --> 32:11.440
you can also make it rise through your attention.

32:11.640 --> 32:15.800
That is called as through the power of chitta, chitta shakti.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.840
But you must have your chitta shakti enlightened.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.960
If you are not an enlightened person you cannot do it.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.800
Can you do it by paying attention to

32:24.000 --> 32:25.960
somebody raising up the Kundalini?

32:26.200 --> 32:28.960
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini in many people,

32:29.160 --> 32:32.000
those who have got problems in their centers,

32:32.200 --> 32:34.280
like the second and the third center.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.120
You can see it very clearly what happens

32:37.320 --> 32:40.200
and you can see it pulsating just like a heart,

32:40.400 --> 32:42.160
the bone pulsating like heart.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.840
You'll be amazed to see that this bone which is,

32:45.040 --> 32:47.680
looks such a stiff thing, is pulsating.

32:47.880 --> 32:49.320
You can even see, say,

32:49.520 --> 32:52.400
see the rising of the Kundalini with your naked eye,

32:52.680 --> 32:53.920
but if you have a stethoscope

32:54.120 --> 32:56.920
you can hear the lap tap, lap tap going up.

32:57.120 --> 33:00.080
This is called as Anahata, means without percussion,

33:00.280 --> 33:01.680
the sound without percussion.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.240
And you can feel it on top of your head, also the same thing rising,

33:05.440 --> 33:10.200
which Kabira has said that on the

33:10.400 --> 33:14.480
shunya shikhara, means on the silent

33:14.760 --> 33:20.360
peak of your brain you start first feeling the Anahata,

33:20.560 --> 33:24.760
means the sound of lap tap, lap tap that you hear in your heart

33:24.960 --> 33:26.080
you start feeling it here.

33:26.280 --> 33:30.680
And when it press that area

33:30.880 --> 33:33.880
the fontanel bone area which is called as taalu

33:34.080 --> 33:37.680
you just feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.200
Now this you cannot do.

33:39.520 --> 33:44.960
You can jump, dance, become mad, take drugs, take alcohols,

33:45.160 --> 33:49.280
grow your beard or cut it off or do anything that you want to do

33:49.640 --> 33:53.720
but you cannot make the cool breeze come out of your head.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.880
And that is what is the proof

33:56.080 --> 33:59.880
that it is a living process that does this.

34:00.360 --> 34:03.080
Unless and until this happens to you

34:03.280 --> 34:07.320
you try everything else there's going to be a big problem.

34:07.560 --> 34:12.360
As I was telling today to the people from television,

34:12.560 --> 34:16.680
he very sincerely asked "What's the problem with us?"

34:16.880 --> 34:21.080
with Indians, with Australians, when You say they are naive?

34:21.280 --> 34:25.040
I said they are naive because they don't know what to seek.

34:25.280 --> 34:28.680
That's one point is. They don't know what they should ask for,

34:28.880 --> 34:32.680
what should happen to them. And they are attacked by people

34:32.880 --> 34:36.200
who are here just to make money, it's money making proposition.

34:36.400 --> 34:39.600
Imagine people have made

34:39.800 --> 34:43.840
millions and millions of pounds through you people.

34:44.040 --> 34:50.040
It's such a multimillion big enterprise and is done on that level

34:50.240 --> 34:54.880
and you people are enamored by these things because you,

34:55.120 --> 34:58.200
it appeals to your brain, somehow or the other, I don't know why

34:58.440 --> 35:01.280
because it appeals to your ego perhaps.

35:01.560 --> 35:04.720
The lady asked Me, that "If it is so simple, Mother,

35:04.920 --> 35:07.320
then why is it people don't take to simple things?"

35:07.600 --> 35:10.120
Now, see, today I came first of all here at 7 o'clock

35:10.320 --> 35:11.840
and they said there are very few people.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.920
So I went round and I came back.

35:14.120 --> 35:16.880
I said that's the trouble, they don't want anything simple.

35:17.080 --> 35:21.240
But whatever is living is so simple you cannot explain it mentally.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.840
You put, as I said a seed into the Mother Earth.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.080
How it sprouts, how a flower becomes a fruit,

35:28.320 --> 35:30.680
all these things you cannot explain mentally.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.360
It's a living process done by the All Pervading power

35:34.560 --> 35:35.840
which is the love of God,

35:36.040 --> 35:39.480
and that activates and works it out and actualizes,

35:39.720 --> 35:43.560
which you cannot by your mental process understand

35:43.760 --> 35:49.320
nor can you do it. You can't transform one flower into fruit.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.600
So this is what, one has to understand

35:51.800 --> 35:54.880
that it has to be a living process within us

35:55.120 --> 35:59.560
and the living process is spontaneous that's why we say Sahaja.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.440
'Saha' means with and and 'ja' means born.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.680
Is born with you, is spontaneous.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.680
Like your breathing is born with you,

36:07.880 --> 36:10.200
like your pulsation is born with you,

36:10.400 --> 36:13.360
like everything that is born with you, you take it for granted.

36:13.680 --> 36:17.360
It exists. In the same way this Kundalini is born with you.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.880
And this awakening is also your birthright.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.880
As a human being you have a right to have this awakening within you,

36:25.080 --> 36:27.840
and you should have it and you must seek that.

36:28.040 --> 36:32.480
But, because of no education on this point, perhaps,

36:32.720 --> 36:35.280
traditionally we are not educated to understand.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.120
Christ came on this earth.

36:37.360 --> 36:41.680
When He wanted to explain all these things He had to go away.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.480
And He lived only for four years to talk to people.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.000
In that four years the way people behave

36:47.240 --> 36:49.400
and the way they never accepted Him,

36:49.600 --> 36:52.400
it was impossible to talk to you about Kundalini.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.160
But in the Bible it is written

36:54.400 --> 36:58.000
that "I will appear before you like tongues"

36:58.200 --> 37:02.680
even in all the Toras it is written that "I'll appear before you

37:02.880 --> 37:07.720
like flames of tongues". Now what are these flames?

37:07.920 --> 37:11.880
These are the chakras which are within us.

37:12.080 --> 37:14.680
When you see them they look like that, the flames.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.680
You can see them clearly.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.320
But it is not the seeing that is important, it is being.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.240
People think that if you see the light, now you become the light.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.840
If you see the light, do you become the light? It's simple.

37:26.040 --> 37:28.280
Simple thing you can understand, you do not become a light

37:28.480 --> 37:30.680
if you see the light. You have to become the light.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.840
And when you become the light what happens?

37:33.040 --> 37:37.880
That you act like the light. Your power acts like a light.

37:38.080 --> 37:41.080
When you are there, people can see how to walk.

37:41.280 --> 37:44.400
They know how to understand the difference

37:44.640 --> 37:48.480
between a carpet and a chair and a human being.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.440
The discrimination is there.

37:50.640 --> 37:54.000
When there is light you discriminate and you start understanding

37:54.200 --> 37:59.160
that the truth is this and this is untruth.

37:59.400 --> 38:03.240
So when the Kundalini rises through your fontanel bone area

38:03.440 --> 38:06.160
the first blessing you get is of good health.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.120
That's the minimum that should happen, but is a by product.

38:09.320 --> 38:14.120
But I don't want to emphasize more on good health

38:14.320 --> 38:17.280
because tomorrow we'll get all the hospitals dropping on My head.

38:17.520 --> 38:20.680
That's what I don't want. You have to be first the Spirit.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.680
and you have to be the doctors and you yourself can treat

38:24.880 --> 38:26.760
your body as well as the body of others.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.680
This is the minimum that should happen

38:28.880 --> 38:32.800
that you become a healthy person.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.000
Now what does that?

38:36.200 --> 38:40.840
Within us lies a power, which is evolutionary power,

38:41.040 --> 38:45.680
in the center, and it is the power

38:45.880 --> 38:48.480
which we call as

38:48.720 --> 38:54.440
the power of Mahalakshmi,

38:54.640 --> 39:00.160
is the power by which we sustain

39:00.400 --> 39:05.080
our own character, by which we become human beings.

39:05.280 --> 39:08.240
From Carbon where it is four valencies

39:08.480 --> 39:11.240
as human beings we develop ten valencies.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.880
We become

39:15.720 --> 39:19.760
eligible for our ascent through this power to begin with,

39:19.960 --> 39:23.080
because this is the power that gives us balance.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.040
In the gross it expresses itself as parasympathetic nervous system.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.360
Now what is parasympathetic nervous system?

39:29.560 --> 39:34.080
Is that it gives a balance to your sympathetic nervous system.

39:34.320 --> 39:37.080
Now sympathetic nervous system is the gross expression

39:37.280 --> 39:39.800
of the two other powers which are around us

39:40.000 --> 39:44.680
one is the power of desire and another is the power of action.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.280
These sympathetic nervous systems

39:47.480 --> 39:50.120
come into play when we want to use them.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.520
For example if you want to run fast.

39:52.720 --> 39:56.920
So, when you are running fast these two powers come into power

39:57.160 --> 39:59.680
that they give us the force to run fast.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.320
But what is the thing that brings it back to normal,

40:02.520 --> 40:04.960
is the central power that brings it to the normal

40:05.200 --> 40:08.040
or gives it a balance. So, this balancing force

40:08.240 --> 40:11.560
is the one that is responsible for your ascent.

40:11.800 --> 40:16.800
If you are not yet balanced, the same force will first balance you.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Because of imbalances so many diseases are caused.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.680
There's no end to it. Apart from that,

40:22.880 --> 40:25.680
those people who go to extremes to the left and to the right

40:25.880 --> 40:28.560
also can develop horrible diseases.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.200
Those who go to the left side

40:30.440 --> 40:33.680
develop mostly the psychosomatic diseases like cancer,

40:33.880 --> 40:37.240
like all myelitis and all these incurable diseases.

40:37.480 --> 40:42.040
And imbalances, people develop say blood pressures and

40:42.240 --> 40:48.040
diabetes and all these problems of the organs of the stomach.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.760
And the people who are too much right sided,

40:50.960 --> 40:52.160
who are too much speedy,

40:52.400 --> 40:54.680
who are thinking of the future all the time,

40:54.880 --> 40:57.120
they develop problems of the heart

40:57.320 --> 41:00.520
and also the problems of the physical side.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.320
Those who indulge into too much physical exercises and all that

41:04.520 --> 41:07.440
also develop the problems of the physical side.

41:07.640 --> 41:10.680
So it is all our doing that we get sick, mostly,

41:10.880 --> 41:12.240
or maybe of our parents.

41:12.440 --> 41:13.800
For example somebody asked Me

41:14.000 --> 41:17.240
that how is it Mother that leukemia is caused in the people

41:17.480 --> 41:20.680
who, children also, they are born with it.

41:20.880 --> 41:23.880
I said the mother must be a very speedy woman.

41:24.160 --> 41:25.960
If the mother is speedy, hectic,

41:26.200 --> 41:29.720
her spleen is working in a hectic way she sets in, in motion

41:29.920 --> 41:32.400
the same kind of a spleen the child should have.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.760
And if that happens, a child develops a kind of a spleen

41:35.960 --> 41:38.720
which is hectic and starts producing RBCs

41:38.920 --> 41:42.680
which are not rhythmic and not in proper shape,

41:42.880 --> 41:47.680
and these are vulnerable to cancer and things like leukemia.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.680
Because at this stage some things triggers it

41:50.880 --> 41:52.520
and that triggering takes place

41:52.720 --> 41:55.680
because of the extreme behavior of a personality,

41:55.880 --> 41:57.440
which I'll explain to you tomorrow.

41:57.680 --> 42:02.880
But in any case, physically you feel fit, mentally you feel fit.

42:03.120 --> 42:06.880
Mentally, because your extreme behavior disappears.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.880
Mostly we take to habits.

42:09.120 --> 42:12.000
Any habit we take to is, the reason is

42:12.200 --> 42:15.920
because we get bored, I think, in life,

42:16.120 --> 42:18.880
or we are fed up or we are very unhappy,

42:19.080 --> 42:23.080
or we are disturbed about something, or we are shocked.

42:23.280 --> 42:25.680
Under these circumstances we'll take to it.

42:25.880 --> 42:29.080
But supposing the reverse happens, that you feel settled,

42:29.320 --> 42:33.360
you feel blissful, you feel happy, you feel cheerful,

42:33.560 --> 42:37.080
you feel on top of the world, naturally everything drops out.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.520
When you have got

42:38.720 --> 42:41.240
the highest you don't want to indulge into all these things,

42:41.480 --> 42:43.680
which are sensational for the time being,

42:43.880 --> 42:45.200
work out for a short period,

42:45.400 --> 42:48.680
but you start enjoying that is what is eternal within you,

42:48.880 --> 42:52.080
flowing all the time. Stress and all that also disappears,

42:52.320 --> 42:55.880
because supposing, I give an example always, of a car

42:56.080 --> 42:57.760
which is about to finish its petrol.

42:57.960 --> 43:00.960
Everybody is in a stress, the car as well as the driver

43:01.160 --> 43:03.200
is worried that the petrol is going to finish.

43:03.400 --> 43:06.240
But supposing by some chance you are connected to the mains

43:06.440 --> 43:08.880
and all the time the energy is flowing into you

43:09.080 --> 43:11.680
then, then you have no worry,

43:11.880 --> 43:15.960
you have no worry and just you get over all these things.

43:16.200 --> 43:19.680
People have a very great,

43:19.880 --> 43:22.280
I should [say], impetus or we can say all the time

43:22.560 --> 43:27.080
a kind of a coaxing from all sensational practices of the society.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.680
And this can quite upset us,

43:29.880 --> 43:33.680
all the time, the way we are all the time

43:33.880 --> 43:36.680
stimulated by these sensations.

43:36.880 --> 43:38.680
Now with the Realization, what happens,

43:38.880 --> 43:40.880
the Spirit doesn't take note of all these stimulus,

43:41.080 --> 43:43.960
nothing of the kind. It is not bothered about these things.

43:44.160 --> 43:49.280
It is just witnessing the whole play as a drama and a joke

43:49.480 --> 43:52.680
and it doesn't take anything into record

43:52.880 --> 43:55.480
and doesn't react to it, as the human beings do.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.840
And that's how the stress drops, drops out.

43:58.040 --> 44:00.680
On the contrary I have met some people who have been doing

44:00.880 --> 44:02.880
all kinds of things, their hands were going like this

44:03.080 --> 44:05.320
and the feet were going like, all sorts of contortions

44:05.520 --> 44:07.200
and I said "Why are you doing it?" And they said

44:07.400 --> 44:09.960
"We have been to a guru and he said your stress is coming out".

44:10.160 --> 44:11.680
Now if the stress is coming out

44:11.880 --> 44:13.800
and if this is the stateof the stress,

44:14.000 --> 44:15.880
when are you going to end this up?

44:16.080 --> 44:19.680
It is not possible, you must understand. You see, what I feel,

44:19.880 --> 44:22.040
when I talk about these things, people just leave Me

44:22.240 --> 44:24.880
and go away because they get angry. But I'm for you,

44:25.120 --> 44:26.360
I'm, for your good I'm saying.

44:26.560 --> 44:29.160
Just understand that how can stress get out

44:29.360 --> 44:31.760
by this kind of a nonsensical thing happen to you.

44:31.960 --> 44:36.040
You are getting mad. This is not the way the stress has to get out.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.680
But you have to get over the stress.

44:38.880 --> 44:41.160
And that is a very simple thing to understand

44:41.360 --> 44:43.680
that if you are standing in the water,

44:43.880 --> 44:45.680
the waves are coming to you,

44:45.880 --> 44:48.080
coming and going, and you are afraid of the waves.

44:48.280 --> 44:49.880
But supposing by any chance,

44:50.080 --> 44:55.400
the state becomes that you become seated in a boat,

44:55.600 --> 44:57.360
somehow or the other, you rise up to that point

44:57.600 --> 45:00.680
that you are in a boat, then you enjoy the same waves from there

45:00.880 --> 45:02.680
and you don't mind any kind of thing.

45:02.880 --> 45:05.120
And this is the state one has to achieve.

45:05.360 --> 45:08.440
Unless and until you achieve that state, all your guru,

45:08.680 --> 45:11.760
all your money is of no value, nothing of the kind.

45:11.960 --> 45:15.160
But this should not upset you, because many people also take a view

45:15.360 --> 45:17.880
that "we have paid for it so we better go through it".

45:18.120 --> 45:21.040
I mean if you have paid for the poison, will you go through it?

45:21.400 --> 45:23.680
Is a simple thing like that. Because you have paid for it

45:23.880 --> 45:25.800
better not go through it because it's dangerous.

45:26.000 --> 45:27.680
You must see what's happening

45:27.880 --> 45:30.040
to the people who are going to these gurus,

45:30.240 --> 45:34.320
or to these cults, or to these other things like

45:34.520 --> 45:36.680
clairvoyance and all that. What is happening to them?

45:36.880 --> 45:39.400
Are they, are they transforming?

45:39.640 --> 45:41.680
Are they getting any of their powers?

45:41.880 --> 45:44.880
Have they become peaceful people? Have they finished their seeking?

45:45.080 --> 45:47.040
They think that they have done it?

45:47.240 --> 45:50.040
if not, then no use going to a place like that.

45:50.240 --> 45:52.440
But human mind I don't understand sometimes.

45:52.640 --> 45:55.280
Like they see a person coming out of the pub, falling on the,

45:55.480 --> 45:58.760
in the dirty lane and still they're walking to the same pub.

45:58.960 --> 46:02.000
So I can't understand why people do all these things,

46:02.200 --> 46:05.680
but mainly we have to know that one day will come

46:05.880 --> 46:09.280
when we'll face ourselves, and that time we'll ask a question,

46:09.520 --> 46:12.680
that why did I not use my wisdom to understand?

46:12.880 --> 46:15.280
That these are not the things I was asking for.

46:15.480 --> 46:18.880
What I was asking was the ultimate, the truth.

46:19.120 --> 46:23.040
Those who talk about love of God, power of God, is very easy

46:23.240 --> 46:25.680
because you see you can read any book and start talking.

46:25.880 --> 46:29.080
"There is power of God and power of love" and all that.

46:29.320 --> 46:34.440
But it must act. If you talk of compassion it must act.

46:34.640 --> 46:37.040
It is not just I say that I'm, I'm compassion

46:37.240 --> 46:39.160
embodiment of compassion, so what?

46:39.360 --> 46:40.960
You may be a monument of compassion.

46:41.160 --> 46:44.240
I can gather some money from you people and start a hospital

46:44.440 --> 46:46.560
and say I have treated so many people and

46:46.760 --> 46:50.800
you give Me a big prize or something like that for, is nothing.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.920
That's not the way the compassion acts.

46:53.120 --> 46:57.400
The compassion acts in the same way as the sunshine acts.

46:57.640 --> 46:59.560
If you are near such a person, you remember,

46:59.760 --> 47:04.360
that somebody touched Christ and something went into that person.

47:04.560 --> 47:07.400
Christ said, "Somebody has touched Me who's sick,"

47:07.640 --> 47:08.880
and the person got cured.

47:09.120 --> 47:12.680
The compassion must act otherwise it has no meaning, it just talks

47:12.880 --> 47:16.680
and advertises that you are the love power and all that.

47:16.880 --> 47:20.040
It's not so. Something has to happen.

47:20.240 --> 47:22.160
That is also not madness

47:22.360 --> 47:26.960
or any kind of a crackpot behavior

47:27.200 --> 47:29.680
but by which you get your transformation

47:29.880 --> 47:32.400
and that's what you should ask for, for the reality

47:32.600 --> 47:35.480
and not for unreal and in reality

47:35.680 --> 47:39.240
you'll be amazed you will see where you stand

47:39.440 --> 47:43.040
as far as you are concerned and others are concerned.

47:43.240 --> 47:45.320
What is the relative position?

47:45.520 --> 47:47.880
That you are the part and parcel of the whole.

47:48.080 --> 47:51.200
You start feeling that you are part and parcel of the whole.

47:51.400 --> 47:55.200
And when that happens, there is no compassion that speaks,

47:55.400 --> 47:57.080
because supposing this finger is paining,

47:57.280 --> 47:59.160
automatically I press this finger.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.680
I just press it because it ,

48:01.880 --> 48:04.680
it is paining and I just feel it because it's Me,

48:04.880 --> 48:06.680
it's Me there, so I just do it.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.560
So that's how the compassion acts.

48:08.760 --> 48:11.200
It doesn't think it is doing any obligation to anyone

48:11.400 --> 48:13.680
that this finger should pay anything to Me.

48:13.880 --> 48:16.080
It's My finger, it's Myself.

48:16.280 --> 48:19.200
How can I not touch it and put it right?

48:19.400 --> 48:20.800
In the same way it happens

48:21.000 --> 48:22.880
that you become part and parcel of the whole.

48:23.120 --> 48:27.080
And when you become that, you just act

48:27.320 --> 48:30.960
as a part of that whole with all its powers.

48:31.160 --> 48:34.560
And that should happen to all of you who are seekers.

48:34.760 --> 48:36.680
Normally Sahaja Yoga is better for people

48:36.880 --> 48:38.320
who are not extremes by nature,

48:38.560 --> 48:40.840
who are central people. That's very good.

48:41.040 --> 48:44.360
It acts very well on them and helps them immensely.

48:44.560 --> 48:47.680
Also those who are in the extremes are also drawn in the center,

48:47.880 --> 48:52.800
because Kundalini is a movement in the central path,

48:53.000 --> 48:55.760
and when you are paying attention to Me

48:55.960 --> 48:58.520
and I say you pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.720
But when Kundalini rises, She sucks in your attention inside.

49:01.920 --> 49:05.880
Like an incident or a happening within and then, the attention,

49:06.080 --> 49:08.680
even if it is on the extremes, is sucked inside

49:08.880 --> 49:12.000
and when it is sucked in, it just rises.

49:12.240 --> 49:15.320
One must know that lots of things happen when it rises.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.680
It just doesn't rise, just like a primule rising up,

49:18.880 --> 49:21.880
but it, lots of things happen within your body.

49:22.080 --> 49:24.480
Lots of centers go into different kind

49:24.680 --> 49:26.720
of bandhans and all that. It happens.

49:26.920 --> 49:30.280
As a car starts, lot of things happen in the inside machinery.

49:30.520 --> 49:32.680
In the same way when the Kundalini starts rising

49:32.880 --> 49:35.480
lots of things happen inside but very smoothly

49:35.720 --> 49:37.080
because you are fantastically,

49:37.280 --> 49:40.680
beautifully and delicately made, with great care.

49:40.880 --> 49:44.680
It's not easy to destroy Kundalini. It's not easy.

49:44.880 --> 49:47.880
But I have seen some people have got very sick Kundalini.

49:48.120 --> 49:51.680
Some people have bleeding Kundalini, I have seen.

49:51.880 --> 49:53.520
And of course, if they are devils,

49:53.720 --> 49:55.200
they may not have Kundalini at all.

49:55.400 --> 49:59.680
But it is not easy to destroy this bone also.

49:59.880 --> 50:03.120
If you burn the body of a human being,

50:03.320 --> 50:04.880
this bone is the last to be burnt

50:05.080 --> 50:07.400
and requires a very high temperature to burn it.

50:07.600 --> 50:11.680
That's why people call it a sacred bone. But when I went to Greece,

50:11.880 --> 50:14.040
when I asked people "Why did you call it sacrum?",

50:14.280 --> 50:18.160
they said, "Because we had a report with a

50:18.360 --> 50:21.200
Indo Aryan group, much before Alexander and went there

50:21.400 --> 50:23.840
and they told us that this is a sacred bone".

50:24.040 --> 50:27.280
And we found out that when you burn the body

50:27.520 --> 50:29.480
this bone remains still there.

50:29.680 --> 50:32.520
So we thought must be something sacred about it.

50:32.720 --> 50:36.280
Now, tomorrow, day after, and after that,

50:36.480 --> 50:38.400
we are going to have three more programs.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.960
Today, in a general way, I have spoken to you because

50:41.160 --> 50:43.680
they said "Just give introduction to Sahaja Yoga,

50:43.880 --> 50:44.920
what is Sahaja Yoga is",

50:45.120 --> 50:47.680
and that's how I told you that you cannot pay for it

50:47.880 --> 50:49.920
it is effortless, it is spontaneous,

50:50.120 --> 50:54.840
it's a living process and through the grace of God it works out.

50:55.040 --> 50:58.800
And by this happening you get your transformation.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.840
You become something else than what you are, in your awareness.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.120
You become a more powerful person

51:05.320 --> 51:08.120
a dynamic person, you start feeling another person.

51:08.320 --> 51:12.680
It's a fact. You can ask, somebody has come now

51:12.880 --> 51:15.360
all the way from Perth, and when he came to Me

51:15.560 --> 51:19.680
he was in a big problem because he had been to gurus, this thing,

51:19.880 --> 51:21.880
and he, he realized that he's made a mistake

51:22.080 --> 51:23.680
but nothing could rectify it.

51:23.880 --> 51:27.040
But now he's rectified and he could feel this cool breeze,

51:27.240 --> 51:29.760
actually on his head and all over.

51:29.960 --> 51:33.320
So, this is the thing one has to understand, that

51:33.520 --> 51:37.400
you must honestly ask for the truth,

51:37.640 --> 51:40.880
and not for something that is being told to you before.

51:41.080 --> 51:43.680
This is what it is, should happen to you,

51:43.880 --> 51:46.680
that has never happened before, and cannot happen

51:46.880 --> 51:49.400
through human effort. So, tomorrow,

51:49.640 --> 51:52.160
day after and after that, we have three more days.

51:52.360 --> 51:54.800
One day I will talk about chakras,

51:55.000 --> 51:57.520
tomorrow, and then about these three powers.

51:57.720 --> 52:01.560
And last day I'll tell you what is to be done after Self Realization

52:01.760 --> 52:04.720
how to keep it up, how your Spirit is your guru,

52:04.920 --> 52:07.880
and how he teaches through your vibratory awareness,

52:08.080 --> 52:10.520
how you understand what is right and what is wrong.

52:10.720 --> 52:14.000
I think that is how we'll space it out and we'll work it out.

52:14.200 --> 52:15.320
But today we should try

52:15.560 --> 52:18.280
to have the session of Self Realization also.

52:18.520 --> 52:21.680
It might be, might work out very well. May God bless you!

52:21.880 --> 52:23.120
If you have any questions

52:23.320 --> 52:25.360
I would like to have the questions for first day,

52:25.680 --> 52:28.120
is important, if you have any sensible questions.

52:28.320 --> 52:29.920
But I, I don't know.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.960
Some people say "In this book it is written,

52:32.160 --> 52:34.320
in that book it is written", or "This one says like that".

52:34.520 --> 52:39.360
Please don't do that, because all these books have given you nothing

52:39.560 --> 52:42.920
so better forget about them.

52:58.360 --> 53:01.840
Any questions? Yes.

53:02.800 --> 53:08.760
[unclear]

53:09.880 --> 53:15.880
[unclear]

53:17.880 --> 53:22.080
[unclear]

53:22.480 --> 53:24.960
He is, doesn't really understand,

53:25.160 --> 53:28.720
the what you were saying about Kundalini

53:28.920 --> 53:33.200
and he's a little unclear about the action and how it works

53:33.400 --> 53:36.320
and how it manifests.

53:36.560 --> 53:40.000
I understand that, because it's a very complicated thing.

53:40.200 --> 53:44.880
It's a big mechanism. See, now supposing you come in this room

53:45.080 --> 53:47.920
and I'll tell you one thing, that if you want to put on the light,

53:48.120 --> 53:49.760
just press a button.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.680
While you can say, "Mother, I don't understand this, how can it be,

53:52.880 --> 53:54.840
if I press the button it will work out".

53:55.040 --> 53:58.680
So, I'll have to explain to you the history of all this mechanism,

53:58.880 --> 54:01.760
and how the electricity has come here and how it works

54:01.960 --> 54:02.680
and how we have brought,

54:02.880 --> 54:04.800
brought it here, all those things I'll have to explain.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.360
But it's a headache.

54:06.560 --> 54:09.280
So first why not have the light and then I'll tell you everything?

54:09.480 --> 54:11.680
You will know each and everything about Kundalini

54:11.880 --> 54:14.520
because in a small lecture like this, where I have to cover

54:14.720 --> 54:17.480
so many points, you see, not easy to tell you all about it.

54:17.680 --> 54:20.680
But you will know each and everything about Kundalini,

54:20.880 --> 54:23.080
yourself you will be able to raise the Kundalini,

54:23.280 --> 54:26.080
you'll be able to give Realization to people and understand it

54:26.320 --> 54:28.520
as if it is your own thing.

54:28.760 --> 54:33.960
So what I'm saying, is better to have the enlightenment first

54:34.160 --> 54:37.880
and then we can understand it mentally.

54:38.120 --> 54:41.120
All right? Thank you.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.680
Yes?

54:43.880 --> 54:47.880
Why is it some people's heart open out easily and others don't?

54:48.280 --> 54:53.880
Why is it that some people's hearts open easily and others don't?

54:54.200 --> 54:59.360
You see, some have good brains and some have good hearts.

55:01.120 --> 55:03.880
What can we do about it?

55:04.080 --> 55:07.720
It's all your doing.

55:08.880 --> 55:12.840
All right, is there any question?

55:13.040 --> 55:14.120
Yes, please.

55:14.320 --> 55:18.080
Mataji, it says in Your literature that You are going

55:18.280 --> 55:21.680
to spark a transformation on this earth.

55:21.880 --> 55:27.840
and among the literature that I've read lately [unclear] it says,

55:28.040 --> 55:31.680
"Finnaly there is someone here to be [unclear]

55:31.880 --> 55:32.880
What is it?

55:33.160 --> 55:35.880
and You are the first and there we find You have been granting

55:36.120 --> 55:40.120
Self Realization and I wonder if You have knowledge that there are

55:40.320 --> 55:44.880
other people, living now, who have been grating this Realization.

55:45.120 --> 55:46.960
O.k., just hold.

55:47.280 --> 55:48.880
What is it?

55:49.080 --> 55:53.120
In the literature it speaks of sparking a transformation

55:53.320 --> 55:55.880
and phases like that.

55:56.240 --> 56:00.520
This implies that You can do the job? He is asking whether

56:00.720 --> 56:03.680
there are others who can do the job,

56:03.880 --> 56:07.400
of doing this, of achieving this result?

56:07.680 --> 56:12.680
Now I must say, I must confess, I haven't met any who does en-masse,

56:12.880 --> 56:16.040
I haven't met. I mean, I wish I could meet someone

56:16.240 --> 56:18.400
because I would like to retire now. I'm sixty years of age,

56:18.720 --> 56:20.360
so I better retire now, isn't it?

56:20.600 --> 56:23.160
But the trouble is, I haven't met anyone so far,

56:23.360 --> 56:25.280
who can give a en-masse Realization.

56:25.480 --> 56:29.880
Also My disciples, can give Realization to people,

56:30.120 --> 56:32.800
but not en-masse, they have to use My photograph or something.

56:33.000 --> 56:36.160
So, if you know of anyone, I'll be very happy to know someone

56:36.360 --> 56:39.480
but I haven't met any. So, I don't claim I'm the only one,

56:39.680 --> 56:43.080
could be many, but I haven't met anyone, I'm sorry to say.

56:43.280 --> 56:47.880
I'm thinking of people like Muktananda and Maharishi.

56:48.200 --> 56:53.040
You must go, that's, that's the ashram he has been to, I was saying.

56:53.240 --> 56:55.280
That's the ashram he has been to.

56:55.800 --> 56:58.840
Y - And also Maharishi.
Dr. Warren - And Maharishi he is saying.

56:59.040 --> 57:03.000
We have patients from there, epilepsy, I'll show you, you meet them.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.120
They are epileptic patients who are coming to Me.

57:05.360 --> 57:08.680
He has made sixty, six thousand crores of rupees.

57:08.880 --> 57:12.440
Crores. It's in billions and billions of money.

57:12.680 --> 57:15.200
You must meet the people who have suffered from there.

57:15.400 --> 57:17.360
If you think so, it's all right.

57:17.600 --> 57:19.680
You can go to them, but then don't come back to Me,

57:19.880 --> 57:21.400
that's the only thing is, because

57:21.600 --> 57:24.320
I know they end up with epilepsy, penniless

57:24.520 --> 57:28.080
and all kinds of problems are there.

57:28.880 --> 57:32.120
Muktananda, recently I heard in Delhi

57:32.320 --> 57:34.880
that his two disciples are now fighting

57:35.080 --> 57:37.680
for the seat and third lady has now got over

57:37.880 --> 57:40.280
but there's a problem of

57:40.480 --> 57:43.400
diamonds worth thirty-four million rupees,

57:43.600 --> 57:45.880
of diamonds they are fighting among themselves.

57:46.080 --> 57:48.000
This is all right. I'll do it. You see, if you move,

57:48.200 --> 57:51.280
all the people start looking at you. Please don't come.

57:51.880 --> 57:55.200
Yes. All right? Thank you.

57:55.600 --> 57:58.800
So, that's not the way. You should see the result on people.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.880
That's the thing, on yourself.

58:01.120 --> 58:03.720
You see, they have lot of money, they have made lot of money

58:03.920 --> 58:05.760
and they can propagate whatever they like

58:05.960 --> 58:11.880
but you must see what you get yourself, is the point.

58:15.880 --> 58:18.680
Mataji I'm very grateful that You pointed out

58:18.880 --> 58:21.960
that the individual mind can't be trusted.

58:22.160 --> 58:24.760
On the other hand the collective mind can be,

58:24.960 --> 58:26.680
and I'd like to thank You for that.

58:26.880 --> 58:31.960
And by the way I'm the gentleman that Mataji [corrected].

58:32.600 --> 58:35.680
I came from Perth

58:35.880 --> 58:39.040
and on the sixth occasion tried to feel

58:39.240 --> 58:42.920
the breeze on the top of my head, I really didn't. Disgusted by,

58:43.120 --> 58:46.200
I've also been to Krishnamurti in England.

58:46.520 --> 58:48.400
And he's been to all of them.

58:48.840 --> 58:52.920
And not to mention, not to mention [unclear] this to this night.

58:53.120 --> 58:57.680
And on the second occasion in Perth I did feel the breeze

58:57.880 --> 59:00.880
on the top of the head, so...

59:01.280 --> 59:03.720
Thank you. I was so happy to see him here

59:03.920 --> 59:07.240
because once, when I met him, he's such a great seeker, you see,

59:07.480 --> 59:10.480
really tears came into My eyes. I said look at this one

59:10.720 --> 59:14.680
he's such a great seeker and I don't know what has happened to him.

59:14.880 --> 59:17.280
And today I find him here. I'm so very happy, you don't know.

59:17.480 --> 59:20.680
It's such a great thing, because you are seeking the truth.

59:20.880 --> 59:22.400
You are My children I feel.

59:22.640 --> 59:27.120
The way you are mislaid is something so painful, you can't imagine.

59:27.320 --> 59:30.680
It's very painful.

59:30.880 --> 59:33.680
Yes, please.

59:33.880 --> 59:37.680
Mataji, what [do You think] of the aboriginals' life from Australia?

59:37.880 --> 59:40.680
You see, the only problem with aboriginals' [rights],

59:40.880 --> 59:45.800
[unclear]

59:46.000 --> 59:48.680
You just tell Me.

59:48.880 --> 59:53.400
He's, he's concerned about the aboriginal problem and

59:53.600 --> 59:55.680
No, they all can get Realization very fast,

59:55.880 --> 59:57.840
much faster than you people can.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.320
I've given Realization to some of aboriginal people

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.400
because they are very simple people you know.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.160
They are extremely simple, good people,

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.680
they get Realization in no time. You just don't worry,

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.280
I'm going to look after them very well.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.640
May God bless you, you are concerned about them,

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.400
I'm very happy to know. Yes.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.960
Shall we have it?

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.880
Now is there any one else?

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.800
Now one thing is, you should not in any way feel diffident.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.200
That's one thing is very important.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:35.080
As I said that you are all children of God.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.760
As William Blake has said that

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.400
man of God will become prophet, they'll become prophets,

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.400
and they will have powers to make other prophets.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.120
The time has come, that's what is the time.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.720
So, don't feel diffident about anything,

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.680
by no means, nor you should feel guilty.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.680
That's a very big disease in the West,

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.200
to feel guilty for nothing at all.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.880
God is great love so please, don't feel guilty.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.040
These two first conditions has to be there,

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.280
that you are not to feel guilty, upset. Be cheerful

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.800
that you have to enter into the Kingdom of God, that's your right.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.680
As seekers of truth you have greatest right

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.680
than anybody else has.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.200
So please don't feel guilty

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.680
for whatever you have done. Is finished now.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.200
Now is not what you have done,

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.200
but what you are going to be. So may God bless you!

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.400
Let us have the

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.000
session of Self Realization, for which

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.800
simple things you have to do, is to take out your shoes.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.040
It's a very simple thing that one should take out one's shoes.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.680
It's good because the Mother Earth helps us a lot

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.920
by taking out the shoes.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.680
Now put both your feet

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.320
on the Mother Earth, parallel,

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.280
and put both the hands towards Me, like this,

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.360
or on your lap. Be comfortable,

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.920
that's the main point, is you have to be comfortable.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.880
If there's any thing tight on your waist or anything,

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:45.880
please try to loosen it.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.880
Put your both the hands straight

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.680
and close your eyes. Please close your eyes.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.280
You are not to open your eyes till I tell you.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.680
Because when the Kundalini rises above this Agnya Chakra,

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.960
your eyes, if they are not closed, will stop at that point.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.120
It will be nice if you can take out your spectacles also

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.920
because eye-sight is very much benefited

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.160
by Kundalini rising.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.080
So just put both your hands towards Me, very comfortably,

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.520
and don't worry if you are thinking

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.800
or your mind is going here and there. Do not try to concentrate.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.400
It will just work out, by itself.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.680
You don't have to do anything. it's all within you,

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.680
it will just work out.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.120
When I will tell you what is to be done, when I find

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.920
there's a problem in a particular chakra in the collective way,

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.240
then I will tell you and that's how you should follow.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.400
But just now, for the time being,

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.040
you just sit with both the hands on your lap,

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.040
fingers towards Me and close your eyes please.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.680
Have full faith in yourself, first of all,

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.320
that you are the children of God

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.560
and that He is your Father who is waiting for you.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.200
He's anxious that you should enter into His Kingdom

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:18.040
so that He bestows all the beauty and bounties.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.880
Now, your right hand is the hand of action,

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.960
and left hand is the hand of your desire.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.120
Your desire is to be the Spirit.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.320
So put your left hand where it is

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.680
in a proper way, in a comfortable way.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.600
You don't have to move the left hand, because the desire is there

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.240
but action has to take place through the right hand.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.200
Now, keep the left hand as it is

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.880
and the right hand, you put it on your heart to begin with.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.680
On your heart, on the left hand side, please,

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.040
and with a very humble feeling

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.240
ask the question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.960
Ask this question three times please, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:01.360
Now put the same hand, down on the stomach, on the left hand side.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.400
We have to work only on the left side, with the right hand.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.680
Press there with your finger

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.120
and just say with full confidence,

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:17.240
"Mother, I am my own master, I am my own guru."

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:38.880
This is to awaken your own principle of guru.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.680
If you have believed in all gurus, forget it for the time being.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.360
First you become your own guru, then you will know

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.800
whether your guru is true or not.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.880
You have to say this ten times, that,

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.400
"Mother, I am my own guru", with full confidence.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.160
On the Kundalini itself.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.760
Now, raise this hand higher again, onto the heart.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.720
Now with full confidence and humility

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.720
you have to say twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:05.200
Why these times I am saying? Because of the different plexuses,

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.800
the number of plexuses, you have on these centers.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.960
Twelve times please say, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.160
Heart.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.600
Now, the same hand you have to raise higher

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.680
onto the left side of your neck. This is another center

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.880
which is called as Vishuddhi center.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:16.640
Here you have to say, "Mother, I'm not guilty".

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:22.360
This is to be said sixteen times as a punishment for feeling guilty.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.040
You have to be cheerful and not to be upset about anything.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.640
Just say, "Mother, I am not guilty", just say that,

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.320
"for doing anything". Because you are seekers of God,

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.720
and if you have done any mistakes, it is done of your [ignorance],

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.640
none of your mistakes.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:43.160
It's just done, because you did not know what was to be done.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.800
So just first of all forgive yourself and...

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.680
Now put the same hand on your forehead across,

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.880
on your forehead across.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:35.160
Now say one thing, which is very simple,

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:41.400
"Mother, I forgive everyone". Say it from your heart, everyone.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.680
Some might think that it is difficult to forgive, but it is a myth.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.920
By not forgiving you are doing no harm to the other person,

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.240
you are just harming yourself.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.000
So just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.880
Unless and until you forgive others, why should God forgive you?

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.360
Just say it with full heart. Put your hand on your forehead,

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.240
comfortably, and say, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.760
From your heart, just forgive everything.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.600
You'll find your load and stress will all go away.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.600
This is a mantra for that center.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.680
Now raise your hand on top of your head

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.040
and just press in the center, in the fontanel bone area.

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.120
At this point, I cannot go further.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.480
You have to give Me a consent.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.760
You have to ask for your Realization

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.880
because you are free to choose.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.720
With your heart you should say, "Mother,

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:20.800
please give me Realization". Just ask for it.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.680
Seven times, and slowly raise your hand

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.560
and see if there's a breeze, cool breeze coming in.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.560
First, you might feel the heat coming out.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.880
Raise it higher, about four inches maybe.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.520
Just see if there is... You can move your hand and see.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.640
You can put another hand on top of your head

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.840
and the right hand down, the same way as the left hand was.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.400
So you can change your hand

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:02.560
and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.400
Gives some shock.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.200
This gives a shock in.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.080
Just try to see if there's a cool breeze.

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:27.080
Again. Raise your hand one by one.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:42.000
Good! Those who are feeling, please raise your hands.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.120
Great! So many of you.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.680
Now you can open your eyes and raise your hands,

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.120
both the hands like this. Let's see.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.680
And ask the question, "Mother, is this the Brahma shakti?"

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.840
"Is this the power of God, that is all-pervading love?"

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.960
"Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask a question.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.760
It's a sensation in the fingers you feel first

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.000
and a kind of cool breeze all around.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.160
Now bring your hands down and see if it is coming

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:27.720
in your hands as well.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.240
You'll feel very peaceful, extremely peaceful.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.880
Better.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:46.880
Good?

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.280
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.120
It's better.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.920
Now I will teach you how to raise your own Kundalini,

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.640
if you can open your eyes.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.040
This will even help you to feel it more, if you have not felt

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:36.520
because it's a very subtle, sukshma,

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.080
and you, we are from a gross awareness going

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.840
to the sukshma's awareness, to the subtle awareness.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.360
It is rather difficult in the beginning to conceive it,

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.680
because you cannot conceive it mentally, you have to feel it.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:52.360
And unless and until you have felt it you should not

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.640
say that you have felt it, but try to understand that it is there.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.960
It is there.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.000
Now let us see how you can all raise your own Kundalini.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.360
You don't have to go to any guru to do it. Yourself can do it.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.880
Put your left hand in front of your Kundalini,

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.240
just while you are sitting, just in front, little further,

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.760
because you have to move the other hand like this.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.680
You have to move the other hand which is the power of action,

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.360
up, front, below, backwards.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.680
Up, front, below, backwards. Like that you have to move.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.400
So you have to start raising it now from that point.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.600
Let's start moving it

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:35.840
up, front, below, backwards.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.280
Start moving it, trying to raise this hand.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.200
Bring it up higher, higher, higher, higher.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.680
Now put up your hands absolutely and give it a big twist there.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.720
Twist and now tie it up.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.320
Let's do it once more, again.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:03.160
We have to do it three times, for three powers. Now again tie it.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.880
If you don't try it and if you fail,

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.200
then you should not blame Me for that.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.360
Again try it. Worth trying and finding out if it is true or not.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.960
Come along let's have it again.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.960
This time we have to give three twists and three knots.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:27.240
Now give one twist, one, another twist,

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.960
the third one and knot it out.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:35.240
Now see your hands.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.560
Working out?

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.360
Some people are getting more in the left, some more on the right.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.520
How to correct it, also one should know.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.680
Those who are getting more on the left and less on the right,

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.040
should put right hand towards Me like this

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.560
The one which is less should be towards Me,

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:17.360
and the left hand on the stomach.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.400
If the right hand is getting less,

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.400
then put the right hand towards Me and the left hand in the stomach

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.880
means something wrong with your guru principle

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.600
or maybe with your liver or kidney

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.680
or anything like that, stomach part.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.480
Those who are getting

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.680
less on the left hand side or not at all on the left hand side

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.880
should put left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:53.400
Is only thing you should know how to understand your own machine,

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.040
Left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:01.160
Those people who are getting less on the left hand side

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:07.120
should put the left hand like this and the right hand on the heart.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.960
So many are still feeling guilty. Please don't feel guilty.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.080
Still feeling guilty I can catch on the left Vishuddhi,

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.680
means feeling guilty for nothing at all.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.280
Why are you feeling guilty for anything?

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.760
We have to talk about the present and not about the past

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.840
because past doesn't exist.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.920
Better!

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.200
Now put both the hands and see how it works out.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:02.880
Watch Me without thinking, just without thinking.

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.000
It's feeling it?

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.360
All those who are feeling cool breeze in the hand

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:26.560
or in the head, raise your hands please, again.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.880
You all didn't feel at all, anyway?

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.120
None of you?

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.600
All right.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.280
It's good, lots of people have felt it.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.600
Say it again. Say again, they got confused.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.880
Yes. Those who have felt the cool breeze in the hand

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:51.000
or on the head, please raise your hands.

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.680
All right!

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.880
Now those who have not felt, can also feel it.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.000
Nothing to be desperate or unhappy.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.120
Maybe something wrong with you physically, mentally,

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.560
maybe something wrong somewhere which can be found out.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.520
It's not difficult to find out. It's very simple.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:21.720
So, tomorrow if you can come again,

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.040
I'll work it out for you, very nicely,

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.240
and also for people who have felt it,

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.640
they should understand that it is to be retained.

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.480
You cannot think about it. By thinking you did not get it,

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:38.560
it just happened. So to retain it, what is to be done?

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.720
You can take from them the books.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.600
Those who have got it, can take the books from them,

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.080
and can work it out tonight.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.600
But don't read the book, otherwise you will again start thinking.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.680
It's better not to read much about things and

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.640
as long as you do not think about it.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:59.680
Just give peace to your head, which has been thinking all the while.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.000
So allow it to rest for a while.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.080
Those who haven't felt it can go at the back and some people

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.080
who can work on them can find out.

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.000
Tomorrow I'll personally see you, each one of you

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.360
and we'll work it out, in a better way.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.080
We have to establish it, fully. Tomorrow I'll come down

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:22.280
and see all of you, one by one. May God bless you!

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.880
But those who want, can go at the back, please.

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.640
They are there, they'll just look, see,

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:31.400
tell you what's the problem is. All right? It's very simple.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.320
Vishuddhi.

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.080
I hope tomorrow you bring some more friends of yours,

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.280
to tell them, telephone to them, that they should come to reality.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.520
Thank you very much.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.760
As well as the program is over the next three days,

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.200
there will be a workshop on Sunday,

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.160
in which you'll be able to meet Mataji again,

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.680
and where we'll get down to the practical details of

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.440
developing your Self Realization.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.080
Tomorrow night and each night, we'll give you the

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.200
address of that workshop where you'll be able to meet Mataji and

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.520
where She will work on individual problems,

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:17.000
where you'll be able to discuss with Her those problems,

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.200
and where you'll be able to learn more about

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.760
developing your Self Realization.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.920
So even if you haven't felt it tonight, don't,

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.160
as She said, be desperate about it.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.480
We, we switched the air conditioning off, so that

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.000
you could be honest about it, because so many people get confused.

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.320
It is, again She says, "Don't be desperate,

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.320
don't be anxious that it didn't happen.

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.400
It doesn't mean that you are not a spiritual person.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.600
Maybe the perception is a little bit dulled..

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.240
S.M.: Don't doubt yourself, that's the thing.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.960
so keep the Sunday at 10 o'clock open please.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.240
We'll have lunch together

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.680
and we'll work it out during that day.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.960
Inside the booklet that you'll get

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.400
it is the address of the center, where we have in Sydney.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.600
And after the programs are over, you want,

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.840
you must feel free at any time to come to the center and to

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.600
learn more about Sahaja Yoga,

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.600
to develop it, to work out how it...

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800
S.M.: All about Kundalini.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.840
how the Kundalini works it out, how it clears the chakras,

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.000
how you can give awakening to others.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.200
As Mother said, you have to become an expert.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.840
Thank you very much. For those people that want to talk to a few

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.200
of the Sahaja Yogis at the back, they'll be there.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.520
If you didn't feel it, if you want somebody to try and work on you

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.520
by all means do so. But tomorrow night as Mother said

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.520
She'll do the job on each and everyone of you.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.520
She'll walk around and from one to the other, She'll work it out.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.600
Thank you very much and good night!

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.040
Just one other small point, so that we keep in touch with you,

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.040
and let you know when the further programs are going to be held,

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.240
would you mind, on a small card at the back,

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.600
giving your name and address and telephone number?

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.680
Just write it on the card so that we can keep in touch with you

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.840
and let you know where and when the programs will be, so that

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.560
you can keep in touch, so that we can keep in touch with you.

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.800
Is it, they all go these cards at the back.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.840
Just scribble your name and address

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.840
and telephone number, and we'll give you a ring once we determine

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.640
on which evenings we'll be having programs and so on.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.400
At the back of the room, please.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.560
[unclear] Kundalini within you. All right?

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.680
You take out your shoes and apart put it there.

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.960
You see, just, it's all right.
