00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.120
It's been two years since Shri Mataji came to Sydney and

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.000
many people have joined Sahaja Yoga and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.960
many people will remember Her.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.880
Many people are developing their realization

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.360
and it's a great experience that's happening

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.720
not only of course in Sydney but all over the world.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.360
Sahaja Yoga is a happening,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.880
it's an actualization of something that lies within us.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.400
The subtle body that is represented here on the chart

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.480
is a map or a chart of our inner mechanism

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.960
that mechanism of our subtle body which

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.360
doctors can't of course see,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.080
or operate on but which lies quietly working

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.720
as the basis of our whole human existence.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.360
Within that subtle body

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.600
there is system of what we call centers or chakras

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.280
and those chakras are the

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.840
I suppose we could call them, energy centers which

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.480
give us at first the vitality

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.080
for physical existence but

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.160
as we develop, as we evolve into higher of human beings,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.320
they become slowly to stage where

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.080
they can be enlightened.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.000
We become aware of the seeking within each one of us.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.160
We become aware of that inner subtlety that is always there

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.880
but which due to our human existence,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.520
we become disconnected from.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.160
What is this subtlety?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.880
The subtlety is the eternal Spirit of Almighty God,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.880
that aspect of God which lies quietly,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.680
the witness to all that we do but

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.760
not manifesting in our daily being.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.880
The Spirit is what we have to become,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.200
it's what Christ has said, "We have to become the Spirit."

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.960
It's what Mohammed said, it's what the Buddha said,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.960
it's what all the Hindu philosophers, all the Hindu saints

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.840
and all the great incarnations that  have come on this earth,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.280
have said.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.000
"You have to become the Spirit." You have to be born again.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.440
And what is this being born again?

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.200
So many people hear about re-birth,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.160
hear about being born again. Cults that are developing,

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.440
talking about being born again

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.920
and yet it's actually only mental activity at that stage.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.120
You have to become something, you have to get your own powers,

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.360
you have to be able to maneuver those powers

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.640
before we can speak of being a realized soul.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.680
You actually develop within yourself an awareness,

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.080
but not only an awareness but a practical capacity

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.800
to become a spiritual person.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.680
For all these lifetimes we've been a human being.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.680
We've reached the stage in evolution now where,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.840
we can just go that extra stage further

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.880
to become a spiritual being.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.680
Now whose going to do the job? How does it happen?

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.880
What is the mechanism within us that allows this process to work?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.400
Until recently meaning,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.920
until the last ten years,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.200
this process has been one whereby

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.400
individuals and perhaps on a one to one basis

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.440
a few people got their Self Realization.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.760
It was almost as if that first on the tree of life there were

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.880
just a few flowers and those flowers turned to fruit.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.560
But now the grace of God is completely overflowing,

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.520
He wants everybody to have it,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.680
He wants us to take that last step in our evolution

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.000
and we all have to get our Self Realization.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.760
And yet it seems too simple, it seems too easy,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.360
it seems too much something which cannot happen

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.760
in such a beautiful simple way.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.120
And yet that's precisely what it is.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.160
So many people are looking for a complex explanation

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.920
of Self-Realization.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.280
So many people are looking in books

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.680
to find out how you get it.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.040
Others are going to gurus,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.840
others are seeking it in the highways and byways of various forms of

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.480
perhaps even area of fringed seeking such as parapsychology

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.840
and ESP and clairvoyance and a hundred other

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.920
isms and methods so called as spiritual seeking.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.920
And yet it's so simple.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.760
What happens is that the subtle energy within us

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.160
which lies in that triangular bone

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.200
that is at the base of the chart and which is in fact

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.680
our sacrum at the base of the spine,

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.240
that subtle energy has to rise and when it rises

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.800
it passes through each of the centers

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.480
that are shown graphically on the chart

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.760
and finally pierces through this chakra at the top of the head,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.680
and you begin to feel on your hands, the cool vibrations.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.880
You begin to feel those same cool vibrations

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.680
coming from the top of the head,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.160
you begin to become one with God.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.840
You become a complete personality, you become integrated.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.760
So what is this happening and how does it happen so simply?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.880
It's almost as if,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.280
we with our Western,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.680
rather torturous minds, want a complex explanation.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.600
So, we go to complex disciplines, we read complex books,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.040
we do all sorts of exercises,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.400
we strive, we pray, we do so many things which

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.880
attain very, very little in the sense of real achievement.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.680
And so, we have to get it.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.680
And before us is a person who is an enlightened being

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.880
and She is one who not only promises to give it,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.880
not only talks about the process of Self Realization,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.680
not only brings you to the logical conclusion that

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.280
you have to achieve something higher,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.880
but She can actually do the job.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.680
She can actually give you the experience of Self Realization

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.440
and you can begin to feel it

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.880
as those same cool vibrations that I spoke about.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.800
You begin to feel the cool vibrations that were referred to

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.880
by the Lord Jesus Christ as the cool wind of the Holy Spirit.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.400
You begin to feel

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:28.880
the cool vibrations that Mohammad referred to as the Ruh,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.920
that the Hindu teachers referred to as the chaitanya.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.760
You begin to feel it. Not only do you feel it on your hands but

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.240
you feel it emitting from the top of the head,

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.200
from this center here.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.200
And so, logically

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.800
and within the sensitivity

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.080
and consciously within your central nervous system

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.800
you begin to perceive the experience of Self Realization.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.800
The Kundalini rises, it ignites the flame of the Spirit which lies

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.880
dormant in the heart, just the witness,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.240
and you become connected to Almighty God.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.600
You become one with the All-Pervading power of God.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.680
When this brain of Divinity, which lies within each one of us

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.880
which is only just a reflection of Almighty God within us,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.680
actually unites with Almighty God

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.280
in a very real way.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.200
This is what happens, when Self-Realization takes place

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.240
and after it happens you get your own powers.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.920
You become your own guru.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.880
You don't slavishly have to follow anything.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.400
You don't have to read any more books.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.160
You can become quite selective about the type of food you eat

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.880
and the type of exercises you do.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.320
You choose according to the type of temperament you are,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.400
that type of food, or activity, or

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.120
exercise or whatever it is, which is

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.880
particularly suitable to your tendency

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.560
and which will bring you into that balance,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.200
which Self Realization expresses.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.680
And so, if before us, is sitting one who can do the job,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.320
and all we have to do is simply hold our hands up to Her,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.800
She must be somebody rather special,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.160
especially if it happens so simply.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.400
Our logical mind or perhaps even I should say, our rational mind

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.800
will question it.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.160
It will ask all sorts of complicated questions.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.480
It will ask whether She is real,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.240
it will ask whether the experience that you are feeling is

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:50.680
perhaps not the air conditioning

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.320
I just hear that it seems to gone off,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.880
all sorts of things,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.960
coming to our rational mind and we put barriers in the place.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.080
What actually happens at that moment is

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.920
the Kundalini that rises through the central channel

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.880
gets blocked at this point,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.520
where as you can probably see the two left and the right channels

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.960
create what we call our ego and our super ego

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.720
what psychologists have often called

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.920
the intuitive mind and the mechanical mind

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.880
or which Freud referred to, when he was talking about the id

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.880
being the super ego.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.080
Not that Freud was an expert on this

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.000
He dealt with one side only and in fact

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.280
in our opinion has done a lot of harm.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.360
So, the Kundalini rises to this point

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:48.360
and these two balloons actually block the rising of the Kundalini

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.960
when, in fact, we use rational methods to reach God.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.880
So we have to go a step further.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.360
We have to say I have not reached it rationally,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.680
I have not reached it by my striving,

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.360
I am a seeker, I love God,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.360
I want the ultimate, I want that union with God,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.400
so how do I get it?

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.720
So if there is somebody who is an enlightened light

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.920
and if that principle of the candle,

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.800
of one light enlightening another is true,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.120
then, this can happen to you tonight.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.800
And it does happen to thousands all over the world.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.680
There are Sahaja Yogis

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.760
all over the world who are growing

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.280
in the awareness within themselves of the nature of their spirit

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:47.280
who are Realized souls but who are attaining their ultimate,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.960
who are finding that their health

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.760
both mental and physical is improving,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.920
who is finding a great deal more joy in their life,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.680
who are finding that they overcome the stresses

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.480
and strains of modern living

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.720
and who themselves become a powerhouse of that dynamic force,

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.120
which thinks and loves and coordinates

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.160
and does all of those things which,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.200
in our imagination, we see as the job of God.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.680
You develop your own powers,

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.280
you don't slavishly follow any guru.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.080
Mother is only here to enlighten that which is your own

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:31.080
and so, when She does the job,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.320
you become a complete personality,

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.680
you can give Realization to others,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.680
you become very dynamic

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.800
and it works out in a very, very wonderful way

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.800
that so many people are transformed.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.520
What you were yesterday, what you were last year

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.040
is not what you are today.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.400
After Realization you can do something about

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.160
the complications of modern living.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.000
You can actually see the transformation in yourself and others

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.680
and you begin to enjoy the beauty of the Spirit.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.680
Ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to again introduce

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.400
to some of you but to many for the first time,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.880
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:45.960
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.160
But before

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:54.480
we come to right conclusion

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.040
about our seeking

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.200
we have to understand

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:06.880
that truth is not a mental action.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:13.680
If your mind says that this is this, it need not be that.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.040
It is our everyday experience in life,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.680
that mentally when we try to establish something

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.040
we find after some time

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.880
that we have not been absolutely correct about it.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.120
Whatever is known to us is already there

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.240
but whatever is unknown,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.960
even about that, if you have pre-conceived ideas

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.400
that this is the unknown, this is God, this is Spirit,

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:48.880
then, it could be that you are very much away from the truth.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.880
But scientifically if you have to approach any subject

00:14:55.080 --> 00:15:00.960
you have to keep your mind absolutely clean and open.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:06.040
That it has been said by many great saints,

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.160
many great gurus, that we are to be born again

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.280
and that we are the Spirit.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.520
Are we to believe in them or not?

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.360
Perhaps we should reach at least this conclusion,

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.680
that they did not take any money from anyone

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.000
and they could not have been fake people.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.760
They did not do it for money sake.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.120
So, if we have to be born again,

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.000
to reach the right conclusion

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.920
we should know what should happen to us.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.040
For example, if you certify that "I am a born again"

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.120
then it is misleading.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.960
Supposing I self certify Myself

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:52.760
that I am the Prime Minister of Australia. do I become?

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.880
I have to become.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.600
So just by taking a certificate we are cheating ourselves

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.040
and avoiding the opportunity to be born again.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.680
So to be honest is the first

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.000
way we can really be the seekers of truth.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.680
If you are not honest and if you have preconceived ideas

00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:16.000
you want to stick to it, then I would say it is rather difficult.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.680
But logically we should come to a point where we should understand

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.960
that what should happen, when we receive the truth,

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:29.800
in our evolutionary process what has happened to us.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.280
Actually, our awareness has been enlightened in new dimensions

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.680
as we grew up in our evolution.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.880
An animal does not understand filth and dirt.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.000
You can take a horse through any dirty lane

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.680
but a human being is very sensitive, he has to close his nose

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.880
or sometimes he even refuses to go through that.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.720
So, in our awareness something has to happen

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.560
and that is not some sort of an abnormal thing.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.800
Like some people, I was told, have written books

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.880
that you have to become mad to be evolved.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.120
I mean in what evolutionary stage did it happen?

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:11.800
Did the fishes became mad

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.880
to become the higher animals?

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.520
When did it happen that you had to become mad to evolve?

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.680
Is a wrong idea that people give,

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.200
because they can only make you mad, nothing else.

00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.680
And you like it, because one way they pamper your ego by saying

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.360
that you can pay for them and secondly

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.400
they also give you a feeling that you are something different.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.680
To be something different is not to be evolved.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.680
We have so many mad people in this world,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.360
we have so many epileptic people, we have so many people who jump

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.480
all over the places. There's nothing great about it.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.000
Whatever you can do easily is to jump

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.120
or to shout or to scream or to misbehave.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.520
All these things are very easy for human-beings to do.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.680
But if something has to happen from the Divine

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.680
and if it is a living process,

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.880
then something should happen within us, which is not in our reach,

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.360
which is the, something that is beyond the human reach.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.840
That has to be this Divine thing.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.360
So we must understand that in our seeking

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:28.520
what we have to seek is a higher dimension to our awareness.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.680
In that dimension you have to become something.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.680
Like you have become a human being,

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.040
you are no more a monkey, you are a human being now.

00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.080
In the same way you have to become something.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.400
In Sanskrit language, a brahmin, a person who is a realized soul,

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.160
the one who knows the Brahma, the All Pervading power,

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:50.880
is called as dwijaha, means born again.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.400
And also a bird is called as dwijaha.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.240
A bird is first born as an egg

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.960
and then it is born as a bird.

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.000
There's complete transformation.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.680
You don't have to certify a bird that it is no more an egg

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.080
it just becomes, you see it's true that it becomes.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.240
So those who are honest and those who are really seeking

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.800
must know that you have to become something.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.360
It's not just that you become mad

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.880
or you become like some sort of a funny, freaky fellow,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.680
but you become really something that is in your awareness.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.440
Now if you have to go to science we'll find out

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.760
that Jung, who was a realized soul, who got Realization much later,

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.680
and then he defied Freud,

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.520
has clearly said that if a human being evolves,

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:47.000
he'll have to become collectively conscious,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.360
his consciousness becomes collectively aware.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.680
Meaning that you should feel others

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:04.880
within yourself on your finger tips.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.400
Mohammad Sahab has said,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.880
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak".

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.080
Your hands have to speak.

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.320
Now the hands have no tongues to speak, so what happens?

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.040
It is accepted in the medical science

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.880
that the sympathetic

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.880
nervous system is expressed in your seven centers,

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.040
on your fingers but they don't know which are where and how it is.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.960
They, they cannot quote it and they are honest about it.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.960
But they say there is some sympathetic connection

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.760
with the fingertips.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.320
So in your awareness it has to happen

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.120
by which you have to be more alert,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.520
more normal, more dynamic,

00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:01.880
more beautiful, more loving, more understanding.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.880
So something has to happen to your central nervous-system.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.280
It must be apparent that you are feeling something more

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.880
in your central nervous system.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.680
Now what people are enamored is that

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.920
if they see some people dancing madly, they feel enamored.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:27.880
Is a sign that you have not been able to understand.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.800
We have seen Christ,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.040
we have seen Buddha, Mahavira,

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.400
Kabira, Nanaka, we had Laotse

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.840
and so many others.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.560
Did they behave like this? Did they become mad?

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.000
We have got Moses. Did he become mad anytime?

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.120
Was he mad anytime, behaving like a mad person?

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.880
All these new theories have started, I think, fifty years back

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.360
or about sixty years back, that

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.000
people believe in these new theories and they have forgotten all the

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.400
traditional things that have come to us, our heritage.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.680
And we depend more on these non-nonsensical things

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.920
which has no moorings at all,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.320
because the people who are supposed to be

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.400
the founders of all the religions have never behaved like this

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.240
and why this new type of thing that has started

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.680
that people are behaving in this manner

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.320
and accepting it to be a very normal thing.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:36.080
So all the seekers must know that you have to become the Spirit

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:39.760
means you must feel your own powers.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.880
It is not that you feel the powers of another person,

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.920
now he is a person who brings out some diamonds for you. So what?

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:50.680
Logically you reach a conclusion

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:54.680
do you want diamonds or do you want your Spirit?

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.240
You can buy them in the market.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.800
Why do you need a guru to do that kind of a job?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.680
There must be some jugglery.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.480
All days of these spiritual juggleries are on

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:10.360
and when I came here from Perth onward, Melbourne, Adelaide and here

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.880
everywhere all the people of the media have been asking Me

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.880
that why these gurus have come from India

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.680
and they have ruined us like this. They have so many Rolls Royces

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.800
and they have things and that and that.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.680
I said, thank God now at least you are realizing.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.040
But I went to America and told them long time back

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.480
that these people are going to come and be careful about them.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.200
Has been already told about it but people did not want to follow it.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.120
They thought that it is better

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.680
that you accept a guru, live with him

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.280
and that when he goes to Heaven means Hell actually,

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.320
you will be there.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:53.880
Now, I'm very happy that an awareness is coming to the seekers that

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.880
lot of them are realizing that they have not found the truth.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.000
If you are reaching that conclusion

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.800
that you have to find the truth within yourself

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.960
then, Sahaja Yoga will work much wonders.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:18.120
Now, our evolutionary process has not been anything which is dead.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.000
It is a living process.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.920
There is a force within us which brings forth our evolution.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:29.120
And living process cannot be activated by mental activity.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.680
For example, if you put a seed in the Mother Earth

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.680
it sprouts by itself. By saying that, "you better sprout now"

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:39.680
or by saying that "it has sprouted"

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.680
you'll have just mental satisfaction

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.760
of creating an imaginary image, but actually it has to happen.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.320
The happening has to take place and this happening

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:55.680
is built within you, that has to happen within your being

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.680
and is already you are destined for it.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:02.040
As he has told you that lies this

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.280
triangular bone which is very inconspicuous,

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.800
you can't even see that. I think it is drawn very small.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.880
We should really enlarge it and show.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:15.840
That is the triangular bone within us, which contains this force,

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.680
called as the Kundalini.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.000
Now regarding Kundalini you must have read many books also.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.080
In India, I saw some books, I was amazed,

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.920
written by mostly foreigners. Such big books and they didn’t know

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.760
where the Kundalini was, in the stomach or in the nose.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.360
Such confused people need not have written.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:37.120
If you are confused, better not talk about it.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.160
You see, if you are confused about something

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.080
what's the use of talking that "this was the confusion,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.680
I got a shock and I got a heat" and all this? Then why do you talk?

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.800
You don't know anything, you have no authority

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.400
so you have no business to talk about it.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.480
That means you are naive or you have been,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.680
just been absolutely a person

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.120
who is uneducated about it.

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.480
Why should you talk when you are not in authority?

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.400
Not only talk but write.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.920
And books after books have been written by people

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.680
who have no authority to write these books.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.880
And that's how they have created another myth,

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.600
that Kundalini awakening

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.200
is the most dangerous thing and one should not do.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:22.280
Now, imagine, what a mistake it is!

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.920
Who is the photographer?

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.200
It's all right. So what is the,

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.280
what is the advantage

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.680
in this kind of spreading news that Kundalini awakening,

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.080
which is the epitome of your evolution,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.360
which is what human beings have to achieve in their life

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.520
that's the aim of their life to be the Spirit

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.880
and Kundalini is the only way it happens,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.680
so why should people talk like this

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.360
and say it is dangerous to have the Kundalini awakened?

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.320
Because, why they are doing it?

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.880
Because they are under some anti-God activity.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.680
Because they are not with God.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.040
There's some sort of a sinister,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.080
satanic force, which is telling these things to people

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.920
that you should not have your Kundalini awakened.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.720
Imagine it is like

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.800
saying that you should not enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.880
If that is the only way if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.960
why should you frighten people about it?

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.720
There's nothing frightening about Kundalini awakening,

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.760
I can assure you. I've had, as you know,

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.880
I've been working for years together

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.360
and so many people have got Realization,

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:53.320
en-mass, and nobody has got any problems like that.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.680
Sometimes of course you feel little heat in the body, sometimes,

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.840
do feel little heat in the body,

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.040
sometimes you feel a little shaking in the body,

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.040
if there is a problem in the body,

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.680
if your nerves are tensed and anything.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.680
The Kundalini, when She rises, She little bit shakes you

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.280
but it settles down. Settles you down completely

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:16.120
and you feel absolutely blissful and peaceful.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.480
No problem is created I have seen so far

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.760
which can be called anywhere near danger.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.400
On the contrary when Kundalini rises,

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.800
She gives so many by-products to begin with.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.200
Of course She is the power of pure desire within you.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.280
The only desire that is pure in human beings is

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.240
to be one with the Divine.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:47.320
All other desires are not pure, because they do not give pure joy.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.400
You think of anything, you want to, say, have a car.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:57.200
All right. Good. Work for it, try your level best to achieve that.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.680
Then you have the car then you want to have something else.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.680
If that was your pure desire it would have given you

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.240
complete joy and satisfaction. It is not so.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:09.240
So matter is making you just run from one to another

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.680
but doesn't give you joy. So the pure desire in a human being

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.360
is this great desire to be one with the Divine.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.520
If you do not accept it today you will come tomorrow.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.280
You will have to take it because nothing is going to satisfy you

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.000
unless and until you receive the truth,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.760
you become one with the Divine.

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.960
People may, I've seen people deny it for the time being,

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.160
"I'm not ready". That's another style is, "I'm not ready"

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.280
and all sorts of things people say.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.440
But I say "Let Me decide".

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.240
Why are you worried? Let Me decide if you are ready or not,

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.760
what is the problem is, it can be worked out.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.120
I have really worked for years together to know all the permutations

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.680
and combinations and the problems and the barriers you have.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.680
And it is not going to take any time for you. It's very simple

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.160
it's a living process, it is not going to trouble you.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.200
Why should you have fright about it?

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.080
So this is one side of Kundalini awakening.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:12.680
The other side is, where people think that

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:18.320
it can be done by themselves. It cannot be done by yourself.

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.280
Somebody has to do it for you

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.400
and then once you get it you can do it for others.

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.680
Now for example a candle which is enlightened

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.160
can only enlighten another candle.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.000
By itself a candle cannot enlighten.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.040
But for that you have to have a real person.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.480
A person who knows everything about the Kundalini,

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.440
one who can awaken your Kundalini

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.320
and not a person who is already shocked by Kundalini

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.680
or who just talks about Kundalini

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.680
or he makes people jump all over the places.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.680
There was a guru in India who used to give Kundalini awakening

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.720
and where this Dr. Warren went first of all

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.120
and they all were jumping and saying ha ha, hoo hoo, hee hee, hey

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.200
and he got such a fright seeing them

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.000
and he thought "It's a lunatic asylum here"

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.760
and he ran away from that place and came to Me and he said,

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.680
'Mother don't give Me awakening because I am frightened of it'.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.400
I said that's not awakening.

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.200
That's not. That is hypnosis, a kind of a hypnosis

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.680
and that hypnosis will create such problems. That's not Kundalini.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.680
She's your Mother

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.480
and She's waiting for days together

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.480
for ages together, many lives She has waited

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.120
for this great opportunity to give you your second birth.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.320
But so far you have not allowed Her to do Her work

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.680
because mentally you are equipped with all books in your head

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.680
or all gurus in your head or all kinds of ideas in your head,

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.320
and She, poor thing, is waiting for that

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.720
to manifest your second birth.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.760
And that is a big problem how to make people understand

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:56.160
that by mental activity you cannot raise the Kundalini.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.080
I may give you lectures after lectures,

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.080
not necessary that your Kundalini will rise.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.280
But it will rise when I pay attention to it.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.680
And if you get your Realization

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.440
you can also make it rise through your attention.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:15.800
That is called as through the power of chitta, chitta shakti.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.840
But you must have your chitta shakti enlightened.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.960
If you are not an enlightened person you cannot do it.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.800
Can you do it by paying attention to

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.960
somebody raising up the Kundalini?

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.960
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini in many people,

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.000
those who have got problems in their centers,

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.280
like the second and the third center.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.120
You can see it very clearly what happens

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.200
and you can see it pulsating just like a heart,

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.160
the bone pulsating like heart.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.840
You'll be amazed to see that this bone which is,

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.680
looks such a stiff thing, is pulsating.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.320
You can even see, say,

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.400
see the rising of the Kundalini with your naked eye,

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.920
but if you have a stethoscope

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.920
you can hear the lap tap, lap tap going up.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.080
This is called as Anahata, means without percussion,

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.680
the sound without percussion.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.240
And you can feel it on top of your head, also the same thing rising,

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.200
which Kabira has said that on the

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.480
shunya shikhara, means on the silent

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:20.360
peak of your brain you start first feeling the Anahata,

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.760
means the sound of lap tap, lap tap that you hear in your heart

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.080
you start feeling it here.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.680
And when it press that area

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.880
the fontanel bone area which is called as taalu

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.680
you just feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.200
Now this you cannot do.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.960
You can jump, dance, become mad, take drugs, take alcohols,

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.280
grow your beard or cut it off or do anything that you want to do

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.720
but you cannot make the cool breeze come out of your head.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.880
And that is what is the proof

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.880
that it is a living process that does this.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.080
Unless and until this happens to you

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.320
you try everything else there's going to be a big problem.

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:12.360
As I was telling today to the people from television,

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.680
he very sincerely asked "What's the problem with us?"

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.080
with Indians, with Australians, when You say they are naive?

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.040
I said they are naive because they don't know what to seek.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.680
That's one point is. They don't know what they should ask for,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.680
what should happen to them. And they are attacked by people

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.200
who are here just to make money, it's money making proposition.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.600
Imagine people have made

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:43.840
millions and millions of pounds through you people.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:50.040
It's such a multimillion big enterprise and is done on that level

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:54.880
and you people are enamored by these things because you,

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.200
it appeals to your brain, somehow or the other, I don't know why

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.280
because it appeals to your ego perhaps.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.720
The lady asked Me, that "If it is so simple, Mother,

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.320
then why is it people don't take to simple things?"

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:10.120
Now, see, today I came first of all here at 7 o'clock

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.840
and they said there are very few people.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.920
So I went round and I came back.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.880
I said that's the trouble, they don't want anything simple.

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:21.240
But whatever is living is so simple you cannot explain it mentally.

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.840
You put, as I said a seed into the Mother Earth.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.080
How it sprouts, how a flower becomes a fruit,

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.680
all these things you cannot explain mentally.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.360
It's a living process done by the All Pervading power

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.840
which is the love of God,

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.480
and that activates and works it out and actualizes,

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.560
which you cannot by your mental process understand

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:49.320
nor can you do it. You can't transform one flower into fruit.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600
So this is what, one has to understand

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:54.880
that it has to be a living process within us

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.560
and the living process is spontaneous that's why we say Sahaja.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.440
'Saha' means with and and 'ja' means born.

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:04.680
Is born with you, is spontaneous.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.680
Like your breathing is born with you,

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.200
like your pulsation is born with you,

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.360
like everything that is born with you, you take it for granted.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.360
It exists. In the same way this Kundalini is born with you.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.880
And this awakening is also your birthright.

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:24.880
As a human being you have a right to have this awakening within you,

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.840
and you should have it and you must seek that.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.480
But, because of no education on this point, perhaps,

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.280
traditionally we are not educated to understand.

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:37.120
Christ came on this earth.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.680
When He wanted to explain all these things He had to go away.

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.480
And He lived only for four years to talk to people.

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:47.000
In that four years the way people behave

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.400
and the way they never accepted Him,

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:52.400
it was impossible to talk to you about Kundalini.

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.160
But in the Bible it is written

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.000
that "I will appear before you like tongues"

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.680
even in all the Toras it is written that "I'll appear before you

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.720
like flames of tongues". Now what are these flames?

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:11.880
These are the chakras which are within us.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.680
When you see them they look like that, the flames.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.680
You can see them clearly.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.320
But it is not the seeing that is important, it is being.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.240
People think that if you see the light, now you become the light.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.840
If you see the light, do you become the light? It's simple.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.280
Simple thing you can understand, you do not become a light

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.680
if you see the light. You have to become the light.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:32.840
And when you become the light what happens?

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.880
That you act like the light. Your power acts like a light.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.080
When you are there, people can see how to walk.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.400
They know how to understand the difference

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.480
between a carpet and a chair and a human being.

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.440
The discrimination is there.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:54.000
When there is light you discriminate and you start understanding

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:59.160
that the truth is this and this is untruth.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:03.240
So when the Kundalini rises through your fontanel bone area

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.160
the first blessing you get is of good health.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.120
That's the minimum that should happen, but is a by product.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.120
But I don't want to emphasize more on good health

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.280
because tomorrow we'll get all the hospitals dropping on My head.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.680
That's what I don't want. You have to be first the Spirit.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:24.680
and you have to be the doctors and you yourself can treat

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.760
your body as well as the body of others.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.680
This is the minimum that should happen

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:32.800
that you become a healthy person.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Now what does that?

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.840
Within us lies a power, which is evolutionary power,

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:45.680
in the center, and it is the power

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.480
which we call as

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.440
the power of Mahalakshmi,

00:38:54.640 --> 00:39:00.160
is the power by which we sustain

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.080
our own character, by which we become human beings.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.240
From Carbon where it is four valencies

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.240
as human beings we develop ten valencies.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.880
We become

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.760
eligible for our ascent through this power to begin with,

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.080
because this is the power that gives us balance.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:27.040
In the gross it expresses itself as parasympathetic nervous system.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.360
Now what is parasympathetic nervous system?

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.080
Is that it gives a balance to your sympathetic nervous system.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.080
Now sympathetic nervous system is the gross expression

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.800
of the two other powers which are around us

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.680
one is the power of desire and another is the power of action.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.280
These sympathetic nervous systems

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.120
come into play when we want to use them.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.520
For example if you want to run fast.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.920
So, when you are running fast these two powers come into power

00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.680
that they give us the force to run fast.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.320
But what is the thing that brings it back to normal,

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.960
is the central power that brings it to the normal

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.040
or gives it a balance. So, this balancing force

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.560
is the one that is responsible for your ascent.

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.800
If you are not yet balanced, the same force will first balance you.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Because of imbalances so many diseases are caused.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:22.680
There's no end to it. Apart from that,

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.680
those people who go to extremes to the left and to the right

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:28.560
also can develop horrible diseases.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:30.200
Those who go to the left side

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.680
develop mostly the psychosomatic diseases like cancer,

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.240
like all myelitis and all these incurable diseases.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.040
And imbalances, people develop say blood pressures and

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:48.040
diabetes and all these problems of the organs of the stomach.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.760
And the people who are too much right sided,

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.160
who are too much speedy,

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.680
who are thinking of the future all the time,

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.120
they develop problems of the heart

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.520
and also the problems of the physical side.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:04.320
Those who indulge into too much physical exercises and all that

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.440
also develop the problems of the physical side.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.680
So it is all our doing that we get sick, mostly,

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.240
or maybe of our parents.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.800
For example somebody asked Me

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.240
that how is it Mother that leukemia is caused in the people

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.680
who, children also, they are born with it.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.880
I said the mother must be a very speedy woman.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.960
If the mother is speedy, hectic,

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.720
her spleen is working in a hectic way she sets in, in motion

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.400
the same kind of a spleen the child should have.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.760
And if that happens, a child develops a kind of a spleen

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.720
which is hectic and starts producing RBCs

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.680
which are not rhythmic and not in proper shape,

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:47.680
and these are vulnerable to cancer and things like leukemia.

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.680
Because at this stage some things triggers it

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.520
and that triggering takes place

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.680
because of the extreme behavior of a personality,

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.440
which I'll explain to you tomorrow.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:02.880
But in any case, physically you feel fit, mentally you feel fit.

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.880
Mentally, because your extreme behavior disappears.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.880
Mostly we take to habits.

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:12.000
Any habit we take to is, the reason is

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.920
because we get bored, I think, in life,

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.880
or we are fed up or we are very unhappy,

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.080
or we are disturbed about something, or we are shocked.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:25.680
Under these circumstances we'll take to it.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.080
But supposing the reverse happens, that you feel settled,

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:33.360
you feel blissful, you feel happy, you feel cheerful,

00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:37.080
you feel on top of the world, naturally everything drops out.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.520
When you have got

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.240
the highest you don't want to indulge into all these things,

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.680
which are sensational for the time being,

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.200
work out for a short period,

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.680
but you start enjoying that is what is eternal within you,

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:52.080
flowing all the time. Stress and all that also disappears,

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.880
because supposing, I give an example always, of a car

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.760
which is about to finish its petrol.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.960
Everybody is in a stress, the car as well as the driver

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.200
is worried that the petrol is going to finish.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:06.240
But supposing by some chance you are connected to the mains

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.880
and all the time the energy is flowing into you

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.680
then, then you have no worry,

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.960
you have no worry and just you get over all these things.

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.680
People have a very great,

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.280
I should [say], impetus or we can say all the time

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:27.080
a kind of a coaxing from all sensational practices of the society.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.680
And this can quite upset us,

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.680
all the time, the way we are all the time

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.680
stimulated by these sensations.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.680
Now with the Realization, what happens,

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.880
the Spirit doesn't take note of all these stimulus,

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.960
nothing of the kind. It is not bothered about these things.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:49.280
It is just witnessing the whole play as a drama and a joke

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.680
and it doesn't take anything into record

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.480
and doesn't react to it, as the human beings do.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.840
And that's how the stress drops, drops out.

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.680
On the contrary I have met some people who have been doing

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.880
all kinds of things, their hands were going like this

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.320
and the feet were going like, all sorts of contortions

00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:07.200
and I said "Why are you doing it?" And they said

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.960
"We have been to a guru and he said your stress is coming out".

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.680
Now if the stress is coming out

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.800
and if this is the stateof the stress,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.880
when are you going to end this up?

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:19.680
It is not possible, you must understand. You see, what I feel,

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.040
when I talk about these things, people just leave Me

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.880
and go away because they get angry. But I'm for you,

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.360
I'm, for your good I'm saying.

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:29.160
Just understand that how can stress get out

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.760
by this kind of a nonsensical thing happen to you.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:36.040
You are getting mad. This is not the way the stress has to get out.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.680
But you have to get over the stress.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:41.160
And that is a very simple thing to understand

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.680
that if you are standing in the water,

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.680
the waves are coming to you,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.080
coming and going, and you are afraid of the waves.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.880
But supposing by any chance,

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:55.400
the state becomes that you become seated in a boat,

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.360
somehow or the other, you rise up to that point

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.680
that you are in a boat, then you enjoy the same waves from there

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.680
and you don't mind any kind of thing.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.120
And this is the state one has to achieve.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:08.440
Unless and until you achieve that state, all your guru,

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.760
all your money is of no value, nothing of the kind.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:15.160
But this should not upset you, because many people also take a view

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.880
that "we have paid for it so we better go through it".

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.040
I mean if you have paid for the poison, will you go through it?

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.680
Is a simple thing like that. Because you have paid for it

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.800
better not go through it because it's dangerous.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.680
You must see what's happening

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:30.040
to the people who are going to these gurus,

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:34.320
or to these cults, or to these other things like

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.680
clairvoyance and all that. What is happening to them?

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.400
Are they, are they transforming?

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.680
Are they getting any of their powers?

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.880
Have they become peaceful people? Have they finished their seeking?

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:47.040
They think that they have done it?

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.040
if not, then no use going to a place like that.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.440
But human mind I don't understand sometimes.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.280
Like they see a person coming out of the pub, falling on the,

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.760
in the dirty lane and still they're walking to the same pub.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.000
So I can't understand why people do all these things,

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.680
but mainly we have to know that one day will come

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.280
when we'll face ourselves, and that time we'll ask a question,

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.680
that why did I not use my wisdom to understand?

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:15.280
That these are not the things I was asking for.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:18.880
What I was asking was the ultimate, the truth.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:23.040
Those who talk about love of God, power of God, is very easy

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:25.680
because you see you can read any book and start talking.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.080
"There is power of God and power of love" and all that.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:34.440
But it must act. If you talk of compassion it must act.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.040
It is not just I say that I'm, I'm compassion

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.160
embodiment of compassion, so what?

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.960
You may be a monument of compassion.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.240
I can gather some money from you people and start a hospital

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.560
and say I have treated so many people and

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.800
you give Me a big prize or something like that for, is nothing.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.920
That's not the way the compassion acts.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:57.400
The compassion acts in the same way as the sunshine acts.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.560
If you are near such a person, you remember,

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.360
that somebody touched Christ and something went into that person.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.400
Christ said, "Somebody has touched Me who's sick,"

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:08.880
and the person got cured.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.680
The compassion must act otherwise it has no meaning, it just talks

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:16.680
and advertises that you are the love power and all that.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.040
It's not so. Something has to happen.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.160
That is also not madness

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:26.960
or any kind of a crackpot behavior

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.680
but by which you get your transformation

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.400
and that's what you should ask for, for the reality

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.480
and not for unreal and in reality

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:39.240
you'll be amazed you will see where you stand

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.040
as far as you are concerned and others are concerned.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.320
What is the relative position?

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.880
That you are the part and parcel of the whole.

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.200
You start feeling that you are part and parcel of the whole.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:55.200
And when that happens, there is no compassion that speaks,

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.080
because supposing this finger is paining,

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.160
automatically I press this finger.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.680
I just press it because it ,

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.680
it is paining and I just feel it because it's Me,

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.680
it's Me there, so I just do it.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.560
So that's how the compassion acts.

00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:11.200
It doesn't think it is doing any obligation to anyone

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.680
that this finger should pay anything to Me.

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.080
It's My finger, it's Myself.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.200
How can I not touch it and put it right?

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.800
In the same way it happens

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.880
that you become part and parcel of the whole.

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.080
And when you become that, you just act

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:30.960
as a part of that whole with all its powers.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:34.560
And that should happen to all of you who are seekers.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.680
Normally Sahaja Yoga is better for people

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.320
who are not extremes by nature,

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.840
who are central people. That's very good.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.360
It acts very well on them and helps them immensely.

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:47.680
Also those who are in the extremes are also drawn in the center,

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:52.800
because Kundalini is a movement in the central path,

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.760
and when you are paying attention to Me

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.520
and I say you pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.720
But when Kundalini rises, She sucks in your attention inside.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.880
Like an incident or a happening within and then, the attention,

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.680
even if it is on the extremes, is sucked inside

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.000
and when it is sucked in, it just rises.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.320
One must know that lots of things happen when it rises.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.680
It just doesn't rise, just like a primule rising up,

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.880
but it, lots of things happen within your body.

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.480
Lots of centers go into different kind

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.720
of bandhans and all that. It happens.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.280
As a car starts, lot of things happen in the inside machinery.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.680
In the same way when the Kundalini starts rising

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.480
lots of things happen inside but very smoothly

00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.080
because you are fantastically,

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.680
beautifully and delicately made, with great care.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.680
It's not easy to destroy Kundalini. It's not easy.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:47.880
But I have seen some people have got very sick Kundalini.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.680
Some people have bleeding Kundalini, I have seen.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.520
And of course, if they are devils,

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.200
they may not have Kundalini at all.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:59.680
But it is not easy to destroy this bone also.

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.120
If you burn the body of a human being,

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.880
this bone is the last to be burnt

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.400
and requires a very high temperature to burn it.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:11.680
That's why people call it a sacred bone. But when I went to Greece,

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.040
when I asked people "Why did you call it sacrum?",

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:18.160
they said, "Because we had a report with a

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:21.200
Indo Aryan group, much before Alexander and went there

00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.840
and they told us that this is a sacred bone".

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.280
And we found out that when you burn the body

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.480
this bone remains still there.

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.520
So we thought must be something sacred about it.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:36.280
Now, tomorrow, day after, and after that,

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.400
we are going to have three more programs.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.960
Today, in a general way, I have spoken to you because

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.680
they said "Just give introduction to Sahaja Yoga,

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.920
what is Sahaja Yoga is",

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.680
and that's how I told you that you cannot pay for it

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.920
it is effortless, it is spontaneous,

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:54.840
it's a living process and through the grace of God it works out.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:58.800
And by this happening you get your transformation.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.840
You become something else than what you are, in your awareness.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:05.120
You become a more powerful person

00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.120
a dynamic person, you start feeling another person.

00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:12.680
It's a fact. You can ask, somebody has come now

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.360
all the way from Perth, and when he came to Me

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.680
he was in a big problem because he had been to gurus, this thing,

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.880
and he, he realized that he's made a mistake

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.680
but nothing could rectify it.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.040
But now he's rectified and he could feel this cool breeze,

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.760
actually on his head and all over.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.320
So, this is the thing one has to understand, that

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.400
you must honestly ask for the truth,

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.880
and not for something that is being told to you before.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.680
This is what it is, should happen to you,

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.680
that has never happened before, and cannot happen

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.400
through human effort. So, tomorrow,

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.160
day after and after that, we have three more days.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.800
One day I will talk about chakras,

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.520
tomorrow, and then about these three powers.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.560
And last day I'll tell you what is to be done after Self Realization

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.720
how to keep it up, how your Spirit is your guru,

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.880
and how he teaches through your vibratory awareness,

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:10.520
how you understand what is right and what is wrong.

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:14.000
I think that is how we'll space it out and we'll work it out.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.320
But today we should try

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.280
to have the session of Self Realization also.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.680
It might be, might work out very well. May God bless you!

00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.120
If you have any questions

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:25.360
I would like to have the questions for first day,

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:28.120
is important, if you have any sensible questions.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.920
But I, I don't know.

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.960
Some people say "In this book it is written,

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.320
in that book it is written", or "This one says like that".

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:39.360
Please don't do that, because all these books have given you nothing

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:42.920
so better forget about them.

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:01.840
Any questions? Yes.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:08.760
[unclear]

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:15.880
[unclear]

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:22.080
[unclear]

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.960
He is, doesn't really understand,

00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.720
the what you were saying about Kundalini

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.200
and he's a little unclear about the action and how it works

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:36.320
and how it manifests.

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.000
I understand that, because it's a very complicated thing.

00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.880
It's a big mechanism. See, now supposing you come in this room

00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:47.920
and I'll tell you one thing, that if you want to put on the light,

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.760
just press a button.

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:52.680
While you can say, "Mother, I don't understand this, how can it be,

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:54.840
if I press the button it will work out".

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.680
So, I'll have to explain to you the history of all this mechanism,

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:01.760
and how the electricity has come here and how it works

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:02.680
and how we have brought,

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.800
brought it here, all those things I'll have to explain.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.360
But it's a headache.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.280
So first why not have the light and then I'll tell you everything?

00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.680
You will know each and everything about Kundalini

00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.520
because in a small lecture like this, where I have to cover

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.480
so many points, you see, not easy to tell you all about it.

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:20.680
But you will know each and everything about Kundalini,

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.080
yourself you will be able to raise the Kundalini,

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.080
you'll be able to give Realization to people and understand it

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.520
as if it is your own thing.

00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:33.960
So what I'm saying, is better to have the enlightenment first

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:37.880
and then we can understand it mentally.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:41.120
All right? Thank you.

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.680
Yes?

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:47.880
Why is it some people's heart open out easily and others don't?

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:53.880
Why is it that some people's hearts open easily and others don't?

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:59.360
You see, some have good brains and some have good hearts.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.880
What can we do about it?

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:07.720
It's all your doing.

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:12.840
All right, is there any question?

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.120
Yes, please.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:18.080
Mataji, it says in Your literature that You are going

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.680
to spark a transformation on this earth.

00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:27.840
and among the literature that I've read lately [unclear] it says,

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.680
"Finnaly there is someone here to be [unclear]

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:32.880
What is it?

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:35.880
and You are the first and there we find You have been granting

00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:40.120
Self Realization and I wonder if You have knowledge that there are

00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:44.880
other people, living now, who have been grating this Realization.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.960
O.k., just hold.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.880
What is it?

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.120
In the literature it speaks of sparking a transformation

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.880
and phases like that.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:00.520
This implies that You can do the job? He is asking whether

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.680
there are others who can do the job,

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.400
of doing this, of achieving this result?

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:12.680
Now I must say, I must confess, I haven't met any who does en-masse,

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.040
I haven't met. I mean, I wish I could meet someone

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.400
because I would like to retire now. I'm sixty years of age,

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.360
so I better retire now, isn't it?

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:23.160
But the trouble is, I haven't met anyone so far,

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.280
who can give a en-masse Realization.

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:29.880
Also My disciples, can give Realization to people,

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:32.800
but not en-masse, they have to use My photograph or something.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.160
So, if you know of anyone, I'll be very happy to know someone

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.480
but I haven't met any. So, I don't claim I'm the only one,

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:43.080
could be many, but I haven't met anyone, I'm sorry to say.

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.880
I'm thinking of people like Muktananda and Maharishi.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:53.040
You must go, that's, that's the ashram he has been to, I was saying.

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.280
That's the ashram he has been to.

00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:58.840
Y - And also Maharishi.
Dr. Warren - And Maharishi he is saying.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.000
We have patients from there, epilepsy, I'll show you, you meet them.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.120
They are epileptic patients who are coming to Me.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.680
He has made sixty, six thousand crores of rupees.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.440
Crores. It's in billions and billions of money.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.200
You must meet the people who have suffered from there.

00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:17.360
If you think so, it's all right.

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:19.680
You can go to them, but then don't come back to Me,

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.400
that's the only thing is, because

00:57:21.600 --> 00:57:24.320
I know they end up with epilepsy, penniless

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:28.080
and all kinds of problems are there.

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:32.120
Muktananda, recently I heard in Delhi

00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:34.880
that his two disciples are now fighting

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:37.680
for the seat and third lady has now got over

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.280
but there's a problem of

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.400
diamonds worth thirty-four million rupees,

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.880
of diamonds they are fighting among themselves.

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.000
This is all right. I'll do it. You see, if you move,

00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:51.280
all the people start looking at you. Please don't come.

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:55.200
Yes. All right? Thank you.

00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:58.800
So, that's not the way. You should see the result on people.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.880
That's the thing, on yourself.

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.720
You see, they have lot of money, they have made lot of money

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.760
and they can propagate whatever they like

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:11.880
but you must see what you get yourself, is the point.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:18.680
Mataji I'm very grateful that You pointed out

00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.960
that the individual mind can't be trusted.

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.760
On the other hand the collective mind can be,

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.680
and I'd like to thank You for that.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.960
And by the way I'm the gentleman that Mataji [corrected].

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.680
I came from Perth

00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:39.040
and on the sixth occasion tried to feel

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.920
the breeze on the top of my head, I really didn't. Disgusted by,

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.200
I've also been to Krishnamurti in England.

00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.400
And he's been to all of them.

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:52.920
And not to mention, not to mention [unclear] this to this night.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:57.680
And on the second occasion in Perth I did feel the breeze

00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.880
on the top of the head, so...

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.720
Thank you. I was so happy to see him here

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:07.240
because once, when I met him, he's such a great seeker, you see,

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:10.480
really tears came into My eyes. I said look at this one

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:14.680
he's such a great seeker and I don't know what has happened to him.

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.280
And today I find him here. I'm so very happy, you don't know.

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:20.680
It's such a great thing, because you are seeking the truth.

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.400
You are My children I feel.

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:27.120
The way you are mislaid is something so painful, you can't imagine.

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:30.680
It's very painful.

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.680
Yes, please.

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:37.680
Mataji, what [do You think] of the aboriginals' life from Australia?

00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.680
You see, the only problem with aboriginals' [rights],

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:45.800
[unclear]

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.680
You just tell Me.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:53.400
He's, he's concerned about the aboriginal problem and

00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:55.680
No, they all can get Realization very fast,

00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:57.840
much faster than you people can.

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.320
I've given Realization to some of aboriginal people

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.400
because they are very simple people you know.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.160
They are extremely simple, good people,

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.680
they get Realization in no time. You just don't worry,

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.280
I'm going to look after them very well.

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.640
May God bless you, you are concerned about them,

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.400
I'm very happy to know. Yes.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:17.960
Shall we have it?

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.880
Now is there any one else?

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:26.800
Now one thing is, you should not in any way feel diffident.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.200
That's one thing is very important.

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:35.080
As I said that you are all children of God.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:38.760
As William Blake has said that

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.400
man of God will become prophet, they'll become prophets,

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.400
and they will have powers to make other prophets.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.120
The time has come, that's what is the time.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.720
So, don't feel diffident about anything,

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:55.680
by no means, nor you should feel guilty.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.680
That's a very big disease in the West,

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.200
to feel guilty for nothing at all.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.880
God is great love so please, don't feel guilty.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.040
These two first conditions has to be there,

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.280
that you are not to feel guilty, upset. Be cheerful

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.800
that you have to enter into the Kingdom of God, that's your right.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.680
As seekers of truth you have greatest right

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.680
than anybody else has.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.200
So please don't feel guilty

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.680
for whatever you have done. Is finished now.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.200
Now is not what you have done,

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.200
but what you are going to be. So may God bless you!

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.400
Let us have the

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.000
session of Self Realization, for which

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:42.800
simple things you have to do, is to take out your shoes.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:47.040
It's a very simple thing that one should take out one's shoes.

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.680
It's good because the Mother Earth helps us a lot

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.920
by taking out the shoes.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.680
Now put both your feet

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.320
on the Mother Earth, parallel,

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:30.280
and put both the hands towards Me, like this,

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.360
or on your lap. Be comfortable,

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.920
that's the main point, is you have to be comfortable.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.880
If there's any thing tight on your waist or anything,

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:45.880
please try to loosen it.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.880
Put your both the hands straight

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.680
and close your eyes. Please close your eyes.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.280
You are not to open your eyes till I tell you.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.680
Because when the Kundalini rises above this Agnya Chakra,

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.960
your eyes, if they are not closed, will stop at that point.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.120
It will be nice if you can take out your spectacles also

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:16.920
because eye-sight is very much benefited

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.160
by Kundalini rising.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:26.080
So just put both your hands towards Me, very comfortably,

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.520
and don't worry if you are thinking

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.800
or your mind is going here and there. Do not try to concentrate.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.400
It will just work out, by itself.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.680
You don't have to do anything. it's all within you,

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:40.680
it will just work out.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.120
When I will tell you what is to be done, when I find

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.920
there's a problem in a particular chakra in the collective way,

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.240
then I will tell you and that's how you should follow.

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.400
But just now, for the time being,

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:54.040
you just sit with both the hands on your lap,

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.040
fingers towards Me and close your eyes please.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.680
Have full faith in yourself, first of all,

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.320
that you are the children of God

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:08.560
and that He is your Father who is waiting for you.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.200
He's anxious that you should enter into His Kingdom

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:18.040
so that He bestows all the beauty and bounties.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.880
Now, your right hand is the hand of action,

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.960
and left hand is the hand of your desire.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:55.120
Your desire is to be the Spirit.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.320
So put your left hand where it is

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.680
in a proper way, in a comfortable way.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.600
You don't have to move the left hand, because the desire is there

01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.240
but action has to take place through the right hand.

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.200
Now, keep the left hand as it is

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.880
and the right hand, you put it on your heart to begin with.

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.680
On your heart, on the left hand side, please,

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:24.040
and with a very humble feeling

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:28.240
ask the question, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.960
Ask this question three times please, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:01.360
Now put the same hand, down on the stomach, on the left hand side.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.400
We have to work only on the left side, with the right hand.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.680
Press there with your finger

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.120
and just say with full confidence,

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:17.240
"Mother, I am my own master, I am my own guru."

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:38.880
This is to awaken your own principle of guru.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.680
If you have believed in all gurus, forget it for the time being.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.360
First you become your own guru, then you will know

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.800
whether your guru is true or not.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.880
You have to say this ten times, that,

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:10.400
"Mother, I am my own guru", with full confidence.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.160
On the Kundalini itself.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:52.760
Now, raise this hand higher again, onto the heart.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.720
Now with full confidence and humility

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:01.720
you have to say twelve times, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:05.200
Why these times I am saying? Because of the different plexuses,

01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:09.800
the number of plexuses, you have on these centers.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.960
Twelve times please say, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:21.160
Heart.

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:06.600
Now, the same hand you have to raise higher

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.680
onto the left side of your neck. This is another center

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.880
which is called as Vishuddhi center.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:16.640
Here you have to say, "Mother, I'm not guilty".

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:22.360
This is to be said sixteen times as a punishment for feeling guilty.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.040
You have to be cheerful and not to be upset about anything.

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.640
Just say, "Mother, I am not guilty", just say that,

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:32.320
"for doing anything". Because you are seekers of God,

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.720
and if you have done any mistakes, it is done of your [ignorance],

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.640
none of your mistakes.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:43.160
It's just done, because you did not know what was to be done.

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:49.800
So just first of all forgive yourself and...

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.680
Now put the same hand on your forehead across,

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:26.880
on your forehead across.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:35.160
Now say one thing, which is very simple,

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:41.400
"Mother, I forgive everyone". Say it from your heart, everyone.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.680
Some might think that it is difficult to forgive, but it is a myth.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.920
By not forgiving you are doing no harm to the other person,

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.240
you are just harming yourself.

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:57.000
So just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:26.880
Unless and until you forgive others, why should God forgive you?

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.360
Just say it with full heart. Put your hand on your forehead,

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.240
comfortably, and say, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.760
From your heart, just forgive everything.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.600
You'll find your load and stress will all go away.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:44.600
This is a mantra for that center.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.680
Now raise your hand on top of your head

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:53.040
and just press in the center, in the fontanel bone area.

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:06.120
At this point, I cannot go further.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.480
You have to give Me a consent.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.760
You have to ask for your Realization

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.880
because you are free to choose.

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.720
With your heart you should say, "Mother,

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:20.800
please give me Realization". Just ask for it.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.680
Seven times, and slowly raise your hand

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.560
and see if there's a breeze, cool breeze coming in.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:37.560
First, you might feel the heat coming out.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.880
Raise it higher, about four inches maybe.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.520
Just see if there is... You can move your hand and see.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.640
You can put another hand on top of your head

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.840
and the right hand down, the same way as the left hand was.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.400
So you can change your hand

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:02.560
and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.400
Gives some shock.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.200
This gives a shock in.

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:22.080
Just try to see if there's a cool breeze.

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:27.080
Again. Raise your hand one by one.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:42.000
Good! Those who are feeling, please raise your hands.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.120
Great! So many of you.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.680
Now you can open your eyes and raise your hands,

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.120
both the hands like this. Let's see.

01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:53.680
And ask the question, "Mother, is this the Brahma shakti?"

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.840
"Is this the power of God, that is all-pervading love?"

01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.960
"Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost?" Ask a question.

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.760
It's a sensation in the fingers you feel first

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:22.000
and a kind of cool breeze all around.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.160
Now bring your hands down and see if it is coming

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:27.720
in your hands as well.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.240
You'll feel very peaceful, extremely peaceful.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.880
Better.

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:46.880
Good?

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:52.280
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.120
It's better.

01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:27.920
Now I will teach you how to raise your own Kundalini,

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:29.640
if you can open your eyes.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:33.040
This will even help you to feel it more, if you have not felt

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:36.520
because it's a very subtle, sukshma,

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.080
and you, we are from a gross awareness going

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.840
to the sukshma's awareness, to the subtle awareness.

01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:46.360
It is rather difficult in the beginning to conceive it,

01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:49.680
because you cannot conceive it mentally, you have to feel it.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:52.360
And unless and until you have felt it you should not

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.640
say that you have felt it, but try to understand that it is there.

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:57.960
It is there.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.000
Now let us see how you can all raise your own Kundalini.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.360
You don't have to go to any guru to do it. Yourself can do it.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:09.880
Put your left hand in front of your Kundalini,

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:13.240
just while you are sitting, just in front, little further,

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.760
because you have to move the other hand like this.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.680
You have to move the other hand which is the power of action,

01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.360
up, front, below, backwards.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.680
Up, front, below, backwards. Like that you have to move.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.400
So you have to start raising it now from that point.

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.600
Let's start moving it

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:35.840
up, front, below, backwards.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.280
Start moving it, trying to raise this hand.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.200
Bring it up higher, higher, higher, higher.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.680
Now put up your hands absolutely and give it a big twist there.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.720
Twist and now tie it up.

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.320
Let's do it once more, again.

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:03.160
We have to do it three times, for three powers. Now again tie it.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.880
If you don't try it and if you fail,

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.200
then you should not blame Me for that.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.360
Again try it. Worth trying and finding out if it is true or not.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.960
Come along let's have it again.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:20.960
This time we have to give three twists and three knots.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:27.240
Now give one twist, one, another twist,

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.960
the third one and knot it out.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:35.240
Now see your hands.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.560
Working out?

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:55.360
Some people are getting more in the left, some more on the right.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.520
How to correct it, also one should know.

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:04.680
Those who are getting more on the left and less on the right,

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.040
should put right hand towards Me like this

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.560
The one which is less should be towards Me,

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:17.360
and the left hand on the stomach.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:22.400
If the right hand is getting less,

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.400
then put the right hand towards Me and the left hand in the stomach

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:29.880
means something wrong with your guru principle

01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.600
or maybe with your liver or kidney

01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.680
or anything like that, stomach part.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.480
Those who are getting

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:45.680
less on the left hand side or not at all on the left hand side

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:49.880
should put left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:53.400
Is only thing you should know how to understand your own machine,

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.040
Left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart.

01:19:57.720 --> 01:20:01.160
Those people who are getting less on the left hand side

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:07.120
should put the left hand like this and the right hand on the heart.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.960
So many are still feeling guilty. Please don't feel guilty.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.080
Still feeling guilty I can catch on the left Vishuddhi,

01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.680
means feeling guilty for nothing at all.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.280
Why are you feeling guilty for anything?

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.760
We have to talk about the present and not about the past

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.840
because past doesn't exist.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.920
Better!

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.200
Now put both the hands and see how it works out.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:02.880
Watch Me without thinking, just without thinking.

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.000
It's feeling it?

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.360
All those who are feeling cool breeze in the hand

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:26.560
or in the head, raise your hands please, again.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.880
You all didn't feel at all, anyway?

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.120
None of you?

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.600
All right.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:40.280
It's good, lots of people have felt it.

01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:43.600
Say it again. Say again, they got confused.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.880
Yes. Those who have felt the cool breeze in the hand

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:51.000
or on the head, please raise your hands.

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.680
All right!

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:02.880
Now those who have not felt, can also feel it.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.000
Nothing to be desperate or unhappy.

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.120
Maybe something wrong with you physically, mentally,

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:12.560
maybe something wrong somewhere which can be found out.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.520
It's not difficult to find out. It's very simple.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:21.720
So, tomorrow if you can come again,

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:25.040
I'll work it out for you, very nicely,

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.240
and also for people who have felt it,

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.640
they should understand that it is to be retained.

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.480
You cannot think about it. By thinking you did not get it,

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:38.560
it just happened. So to retain it, what is to be done?

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.720
You can take from them the books.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.600
Those who have got it, can take the books from them,

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.080
and can work it out tonight.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:49.600
But don't read the book, otherwise you will again start thinking.

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:52.680
It's better not to read much about things and

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.640
as long as you do not think about it.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:59.680
Just give peace to your head, which has been thinking all the while.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.000
So allow it to rest for a while.

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:07.080
Those who haven't felt it can go at the back and some people

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.080
who can work on them can find out.

01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.000
Tomorrow I'll personally see you, each one of you

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.360
and we'll work it out, in a better way.

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:18.080
We have to establish it, fully. Tomorrow I'll come down

01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:22.280
and see all of you, one by one. May God bless you!

01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.880
But those who want, can go at the back, please.

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.640
They are there, they'll just look, see,

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:31.400
tell you what's the problem is. All right? It's very simple.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.320
Vishuddhi.

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.080
I hope tomorrow you bring some more friends of yours,

01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.280
to tell them, telephone to them, that they should come to reality.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.520
Thank you very much.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.760
As well as the program is over the next three days,

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.200
there will be a workshop on Sunday,

01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.160
in which you'll be able to meet Mataji again,

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.680
and where we'll get down to the practical details of

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.440
developing your Self Realization.

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.080
Tomorrow night and each night, we'll give you the

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.200
address of that workshop where you'll be able to meet Mataji and

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.520
where She will work on individual problems,

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:17.000
where you'll be able to discuss with Her those problems,

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.200
and where you'll be able to learn more about

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:21.760
developing your Self Realization.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.920
So even if you haven't felt it tonight, don't,

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:26.160
as She said, be desperate about it.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:29.480
We, we switched the air conditioning off, so that

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.000
you could be honest about it, because so many people get confused.

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.320
It is, again She says, "Don't be desperate,

01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:39.320
don't be anxious that it didn't happen.

01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:42.400
It doesn't mean that you are not a spiritual person.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.600
Maybe the perception is a little bit dulled..

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:47.240
S.M.: Don't doubt yourself, that's the thing.

01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:52.960
so keep the Sunday at 10 o'clock open please.

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.240
We'll have lunch together

01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:57.680
and we'll work it out during that day.

01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.960
Inside the booklet that you'll get

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.400
it is the address of the center, where we have in Sydney.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.600
And after the programs are over, you want,

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.840
you must feel free at any time to come to the center and to

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.600
learn more about Sahaja Yoga,

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.600
to develop it, to work out how it...

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:16.800
S.M.: All about Kundalini.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.840
how the Kundalini works it out, how it clears the chakras,

01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.000
how you can give awakening to others.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:26.200
As Mother said, you have to become an expert.

01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:29.840
Thank you very much. For those people that want to talk to a few

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.200
of the Sahaja Yogis at the back, they'll be there.

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:35.520
If you didn't feel it, if you want somebody to try and work on you

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:39.520
by all means do so. But tomorrow night as Mother said

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.520
She'll do the job on each and everyone of you.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:44.520
She'll walk around and from one to the other, She'll work it out.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.600
Thank you very much and good night!

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.040
Just one other small point, so that we keep in touch with you,

01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.040
and let you know when the further programs are going to be held,

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.240
would you mind, on a small card at the back,

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.600
giving your name and address and telephone number?

01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:00.680
Just write it on the card so that we can keep in touch with you

01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.840
and let you know where and when the programs will be, so that

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:09.560
you can keep in touch, so that we can keep in touch with you.

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.800
Is it, they all go these cards at the back.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.840
Just scribble your name and address

01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:18.840
and telephone number, and we'll give you a ring once we determine

01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.640
on which evenings we'll be having programs and so on.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.400
At the back of the room, please.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.560
[unclear] Kundalini within you. All right?

01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.680
You take out your shoes and apart put it there.

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:47.960
You see, just, it's all right.
