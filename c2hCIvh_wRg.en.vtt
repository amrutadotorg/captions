Shri Mahavira Puja. Barcelona (Spain), 17 June 1990.

00:06:51.984 --> 00:06:55.664
Today we are going to do  puja of Mahavira

00:06:55.864 --> 00:07:00.277
and we never had this puja before.

00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:11.835
The reason for this was that

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:18.642
Mahavira’s life was an ascetic’s life,

00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:27.617
just like Buddha.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.258
Even more than Buddha it would be

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:41.102
because at the time when these two were born,

00:07:46.768 --> 00:07:53.360
the Brahminism of the Hinduism had taken a very funny form.

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:01.528
People had become extremely ritualistic

00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:04.687
and they were worshipping all kinds of stones

00:08:04.887 --> 00:08:10.741
and all kinds of things instead of worshipping only the swayambu.

00:08:21.123 --> 00:08:25.441
Who is that fellow eating food at the time.

00:08:26.782 --> 00:08:29.793
There is a gentleman who is eating food at the time of a –

00:08:29.993 --> 00:08:33.486
Please tell him.

00:08:49.207 --> 00:08:53.881
Let it be, let it be open (the window).

00:08:56.230 --> 00:09:01.345
The ascetic life of Mahavira

00:09:01.545 --> 00:09:05.386
was of a very, very extreme nature.

00:09:12.433 --> 00:09:22.834
He was the one who was born in a clan of warriors, Kshatriyas,

00:09:27.469 --> 00:09:31.252
and then He was also married.

00:09:34.077 --> 00:09:38.250
Also He had a daughter

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.039
and then He decided – because He knew He had

00:09:43.239 --> 00:09:49.030
to do the work of the Divine –

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.762
He decided to take a sanyasa.

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.250
So He took the permission of His brother,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.703
because His parents were dead.

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:08.028
He was a king, so He gave up all His material wealth,

00:10:08.228 --> 00:10:13.185
everything and He became a complete sanyasi.

00:10:24.898 --> 00:10:33.235
And He left His family, left His house everything behind

00:10:33.435 --> 00:10:40.398
and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms.

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:54.104
And the people who joined Him were very few

00:10:54.304 --> 00:10:59.574
and He asked them that : “ you have to also become ascetics”, munis.

00:11:06.384 --> 00:11:09.964
He was a reincarnation of St. Michael

00:11:13.823 --> 00:11:18.290
and He resides on the left side

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.121
on the Ida Nadi.

00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:25.574
And He looks after the whole of it,

00:11:25.774 --> 00:11:30.742
right from Mooladhara onwards up to the Sahasrara.

00:11:36.052 --> 00:11:41.171
So St Michael was born as Mahavira,

00:11:44.873 --> 00:11:49.087
meaning the greatest warrior.

00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:57.630
But when He was born, the whole place got lot of prosperity.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:01.987
That’s why He was called as Vardhaman, to begin with.

00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:16.859
But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism

00:12:17.059 --> 00:12:18.978
that was so prevalent in those days,

00:12:19.178 --> 00:12:23.827
and people were absolutely drowned into it.

00:12:30.874 --> 00:12:36.166
After Shri Krishna, these two persons, Buddha and Mahavira,

00:12:36.366 --> 00:12:40.402
both of them incarnated in India.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.853
As you know, their history is very far out because

00:12:51.053 --> 00:12:55.628
they were the children of Rama and they were two twins,

00:12:55.828 --> 00:12:59.964
called as Lav and Kush.

00:13:06.903 --> 00:13:11.886
So Rama led a life of a very great king,

00:13:12.086 --> 00:13:16.125
benevolent king, and of lots of limitations,

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:19.325
mariada Purushottama.

00:13:25.579 --> 00:13:30.947
Because of that, people became extremely serious and

00:13:31.147 --> 00:13:40.373
also very closed, because of Rama’s following.

00:13:45.737 --> 00:13:49.410
Of course after every incarnation,

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.974
as they do not get their Realization, they get deviated

00:13:53.174 --> 00:13:57.967
and start going to the extremes of everything.

00:14:04.526 --> 00:14:10.326
So they went to the extremes and became very, very much –

00:14:10.526 --> 00:14:13.909
sort of quiet people wouldn’t talk to anyone

00:14:14.109 --> 00:14:16.996
and would be very formal sort of people,

00:14:17.196 --> 00:14:22.379
because that was the life Rama had to live, lead.

00:14:32.161 --> 00:14:36.557
And because Rama left His wife, many people at that time

00:14:36.757 --> 00:14:42.162
felt that wife is not to be paid so much attention to.

00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:55.232
So Shri Krishna came. Actually Rama took birth as Shri Krishna

00:14:55.432 --> 00:14:58.432
to overcome these conditionings.

00:15:06.388 --> 00:15:10.404
And He said, “All this is leela. This is all a play.”

00:15:14.114 --> 00:15:17.565
And that it is a play and you should have pure heart

00:15:17.765 --> 00:15:20.485
and you can play about.

00:15:20.685 --> 00:15:24.485
There is, as long as you have pure character,

00:15:24.685 --> 00:15:30.162
nothing can go wrong if you mix up with people freely.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:43.081
So after Shri Krishna, people started becoming

00:15:43.281 --> 00:15:47.869
very licentious and permissive

00:15:54.235 --> 00:15:58.622
and they created poems and things of Krishna’s love stories,

00:15:58.822 --> 00:16:02.309
which was all false.

00:16:06.618 --> 00:16:10.450
Because He lived with Radha at the age of five or six years,

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:14.563
and with the, in the Gokul.

00:16:19.301 --> 00:16:24.331
So all these false stories about Him were used

00:16:24.532 --> 00:16:29.318
for the licentiousness of the people.

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:41.271
So now, the situation was such, that the whole place

00:16:41.471 --> 00:16:46.542
was getting completely drowned into immorality.

00:16:51.987 --> 00:16:54.746
The priests, the Brahmins themselves, had become

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:57.786
extremely immoral and

00:16:57.986 --> 00:17:03.343
were indulging into all kinds of corrupt practices.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.182
Not only that, but they took to tantric,

00:17:15.382 --> 00:17:22.751
tantric manifestations of using spirits and things like that,

00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:33.482
and became very self-indulgent.

00:17:36.403 --> 00:17:42.966
At that time Buddha, Lord Buddha and Mahavira were born

00:17:48.935 --> 00:17:53.084
to de-condition people

00:17:53.284 --> 00:17:57.625
from this kind of an extreme behaviour,

00:18:02.773 --> 00:18:05.731
because whatever the incarnations tried,

00:18:05.931 --> 00:18:10.550
people always went to the extremes.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:20.293
So they found out that people were very much indulgent

00:18:20.493 --> 00:18:27.660
in killing animals and eating flesh all the time

00:18:32.016 --> 00:18:35.260
and if you eat too much of flesh and all that you become

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.285
right sided personality

00:18:42.926 --> 00:18:47.854
and so then you become very aggressive

00:18:50.842 --> 00:18:54.564
and start killing others.

00:18:56.389 --> 00:19:00.715
Moreover the people who were very much attached to their family

00:19:00.915 --> 00:19:04.168
or to their children and all that

00:19:04.368 --> 00:19:10.312
would not do the work of the Divine

00:19:18.685 --> 00:19:23.778
and it was a very intensive work which He had to do.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:31.564
So He made very strict rules as Moses did.

00:19:36.716 --> 00:19:40.262
He said that nobody should kill

00:19:40.462 --> 00:19:43.891
any animal and eat it first of all.

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:56.291
Those who are becoming the munis or the bhikshus

00:19:56.491 --> 00:20:00.973
should not even go on any bullock cart;

00:20:01.173 --> 00:20:05.903
should walk bare feet; should not even wear shoes.

00:20:12.613 --> 00:20:14.794
They should shave their head completely;

00:20:14.994 --> 00:20:19.429
should have only three changes, three dresses

00:20:19.629 --> 00:20:25.346
with them of a big tunic-like thing.

00:20:30.655 --> 00:20:35.873
Whether it is sun or rain, they should not use any umbrellas.

00:20:41.666 --> 00:20:46.319
They should eat before six o’clock; before the sun sets.

00:20:49.888 --> 00:20:53.277
They should sleep only for five hours

00:20:55.563 --> 00:20:59.371
and all the time meditate and ascend

00:20:59.571 --> 00:21:04.283
and then try to do the work of the Divine.

00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:13.794
Then only they can do the work of the Divine.

00:21:17.564 --> 00:21:22.571
After they get their Realization that, He called as Kevalagyan,

00:21:22.771 --> 00:21:27.898
only the knowledge, only knowledge, means pure knowledge.

00:21:33.406 --> 00:21:35.793
They will develop Samvaddharshan means

00:21:35.993 --> 00:21:40.057
integrated personality .

00:21:43.787 --> 00:21:48.724
and all the collective consciousness He talked of all, all these things

00:21:50.899 --> 00:21:53.169
but as He belonged to the left side,

00:21:53.369 --> 00:21:58.448
He has described hell very clearly.

00:22:03.703 --> 00:22:09.394
Fundamentally, basically there are fourteen hells according to Him

00:22:13.156 --> 00:22:19.744
and is horrible to read all that what He has described about hell.

00:22:23.332 --> 00:22:25.512
Because He wanted to tell people that

00:22:25.712 --> 00:22:30.418
if you do all these wrong things you will go to hell

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.794
and He talked about, not about form, formly God,

00:22:40.994 --> 00:22:45.234
but formless God,

00:22:48.766 --> 00:22:54.158
because He didn’t want people to again start ritualism

00:22:56.168 --> 00:22:59.952
but get to right, right to the position

00:23:00.152 --> 00:23:05.207
where they could get their Self Realization to cleanse themselves.

00:23:10.289 --> 00:23:14.946
So you can imagine how difficult in those days at Mahavira

00:23:15.146 --> 00:23:22.560
was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization.

00:23:29.703 --> 00:23:33.341
It’s frightening for you.

00:23:35.198 --> 00:23:41.998
That’s why I never had this puja.

00:23:44.807 --> 00:23:48.678
Because to do all these things first of all

00:23:48.878 --> 00:23:51.411
and to become absolutely pure,

00:23:51.611 --> 00:23:55.722
then only He would give realization.

00:24:02.315 --> 00:24:05.027
I wonder how many got realization.

00:24:05.227 --> 00:24:11.767
But the way He made rules for people was so strict.

00:24:20.171 --> 00:24:22.414
Nobody would have followed Him.

00:24:22.614 --> 00:24:25.564
But He told them about the hell in which they will go

00:24:25.764 --> 00:24:29.336
if they don’t follow.

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:38.159
So they were so frightened that they joined Him

00:24:38.359 --> 00:24:43.126
and started following Jainism. ‘Jain’ means ‘the one who has known,

00:24:43.326 --> 00:24:47.882
who is enlightened, gnayan.’

00:24:55.148 --> 00:24:58.749
Is the, the same word is gnayan means ‘to know.’

00:24:58.949 --> 00:25:02.561
‘Ja’ – it means ‘to know.’

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.527
Just like the Jews. Is the same word

00:25:08.727 --> 00:25:12.917
is the ‘Jew’ means also ‘the one who knows.’

00:25:15.479 --> 00:25:19.210
Moses also did the same.

00:25:20.583 --> 00:25:23.518
He didn’t say that you should not eat meat

00:25:23.718 --> 00:25:28.065
but He said that if anybody is found with another woman

00:25:28.265 --> 00:25:31.741
he should be killed.

00:25:37.093 --> 00:25:43.337
The Muslims as they follow Sharia is made by Moses for the Jews

00:25:43.537 --> 00:25:49.235
because they had become so self-indulgent.

00:25:51.846 --> 00:25:55.834
The Sharia that is followed by Muslims

00:25:56.034 --> 00:26:00.200
is made by Moses for the Jews

00:26:06.772 --> 00:26:09.612
because when He brought those ten commandments

00:26:09.812 --> 00:26:12.932
He found the Jews were indulging into

00:26:13.132 --> 00:26:17.156
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:26:22.266 --> 00:26:25.002
But Jews very nicely put it on the shelf

00:26:25.202 --> 00:26:28.956
and the Muslims took to it.

00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:40.822
So now this Mahavira style went to the extreme as usual

00:26:45.431 --> 00:26:49.526
even Lord Buddha’s same thing.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.084
Mahavira was the one who said that

00:26:57.284 --> 00:26:59.536
you should not kill any animal,

00:26:59.736 --> 00:27:06.153
so now in India we have people who are absolutely abstaining

00:27:06.353 --> 00:27:10.845
from even killing bugs and killing even mosquitoes.

00:27:20.465 --> 00:27:23.684
How far human beings can go to stupidity

00:27:23.884 --> 00:27:27.686
can be seen from this.

00:27:33.257 --> 00:27:37.694
Nowadays there’s a custom, very common in India,

00:27:37.894 --> 00:27:40.282
that they take get hold of a Brahmin,

00:27:40.482 --> 00:27:45.016
put him in a hut and put all the bugs inside

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:58.421
and when these bugs have got completely, have got completely,

00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:02.808
fed up with the drinking of the blood of this Brahmin

00:28:03.008 --> 00:28:06.008
they just drop out.

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:14.124
Then this Brahmin is paid a big amount by the Jains

00:28:14.324 --> 00:28:17.837
who have lots of money.

00:28:23.988 --> 00:28:28.235
They are vegetarians to such an extent

00:28:28.435 --> 00:28:32.227
that they don’t want to go to the bathroom,

00:28:32.427 --> 00:28:35.353
but they’ll go on some sort of a open space

00:28:35.553 --> 00:28:38.942
that no animal should die.

00:28:47.573 --> 00:28:51.796
Such ridiculous things they do

00:28:53.319 --> 00:28:59.423
and in the, in all doing all this abstinence and all that

00:28:59.623 --> 00:29:03.671
they are extremely money oriented.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.754
Jains are just like Jews in India.

00:29:11.954 --> 00:29:17.816
Jains and Jews are the same in their money orientation.

00:29:23.347 --> 00:29:26.997
So the Jains won’t kill even a bug or a mosquito

00:29:27.197 --> 00:29:32.145
but they don’t mind harassing a man up to his death

00:29:32.345 --> 00:29:35.876
for their two rupees.

00:29:46.093 --> 00:29:52.461
So this extreme temperament is seen in every religion

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:01.070
and that comes because human beings start moving like

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:05.422
a pendulum from one end to another.

00:30:09.134 --> 00:30:13.039
An incarnation comes and tries to bring them in the center

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.840
but again they start moving on the other side.

00:30:22.024 --> 00:30:24.046
They cannot remain in the center.

00:30:24.246 --> 00:30:28.040
This is the problem of the human beings

00:30:31.241 --> 00:30:35.313
and this is why all religions look so funny.

00:30:40.224 --> 00:30:42.929
When you see the way the Jains are,

00:30:43.129 --> 00:30:45.659
I mean, you are surprised and

00:30:45.859 --> 00:30:51.374
can’t believe how stupid they are; educated people, doctors,

00:30:58.413 --> 00:31:03.485
but they never know that, they never understand that they are stupid.

00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:09.737
So this is the story of Mahavira

00:31:09.937 --> 00:31:14.380
where He has tried to bring in a kind...

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.896
(…) you will please sit down. Who is that lady?

00:31:17.096 --> 00:31:19.523
Don’t move around.

00:31:19.723 --> 00:31:22.007
You shouldn’t get up and walk when I am talking.

00:31:22.207 --> 00:31:24.286
All right? Tell her.

00:31:24.487 --> 00:31:26.309
They are eating, they are walking about.

00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:31.223
Will you please tell the Spanish to behave themselves.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:47.044
When I started Sahaja Yoga if I’d started like Mahavira

00:31:47.244 --> 00:31:50.998
how many would have joined Me?

00:31:57.838 --> 00:32:00.136
Even when we have raised the Kundalini,

00:32:00.336 --> 00:32:05.910
you have got your Realization there is not much of detachment.

00:32:14.645 --> 00:32:17.508
Sanyassi meant that he had nothing to do with his wife,

00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:21.350
nothing to do with his children, nothing to do with his family

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:26.518
or house or anything possessions, no possessions.

00:32:32.883 --> 00:32:36.093
But...

00:32:59.004 --> 00:33:01.004
And...

00:33:07.174 --> 00:33:13.668
They were given such a little to eat

00:33:13.868 --> 00:33:16.938
without any, just boiled food,

00:33:17.138 --> 00:33:24.646
just boiled and such strict order.

00:33:36.287 --> 00:33:41.476
But in Sahaja Yoga I have first of all raised your Kundalini

00:33:41.676 --> 00:33:44.429
without telling you any ritual,

00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:48.525
any what you can call strictness or anything about it.

00:33:48.725 --> 00:33:53.256
Just whatever you are, all right, get your Realization.

00:34:01.415 --> 00:34:07.957
And I thought that by raising the Kundalini, by Self Realization,

00:34:08.157 --> 00:34:12.679
I need not tell them about hell.

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:19.175
Only by that, they will become quite detached and wise.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:30.819
But even now what you find is that there are people

00:34:31.019 --> 00:34:38.239
who get married in Sahaja Yoga and just get lost.

00:34:45.675 --> 00:34:48.528
Either the wife dominates or the husband dominates

00:34:48.728 --> 00:34:53.561
or both of them get completely lost.

00:34:59.413 --> 00:35:03.181
Normally in the western countries as soon as they get married,

00:35:03.381 --> 00:35:08.461
first second day they start quarrelling

00:35:12.888 --> 00:35:17.499
and within one week they start talking about divorce.

00:35:20.274 --> 00:35:23.010
But in Sahaja Yoga when they get married

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:27.996
they just get attached to each other like glue you see.

00:35:33.429 --> 00:35:36.689
Then there is no other interest left all the time thinking

00:35:36.889 --> 00:35:41.546
of wife, wife, wife or husband, husband, husband,

00:35:46.966 --> 00:35:50.813
someone to go for honeymoon, someone to do it

00:35:51.013 --> 00:35:55.386
in a very big way with a reception and things.

00:36:01.208 --> 00:36:05.079
The importance is given so much,

00:36:05.279 --> 00:36:07.492
that it is unbelievable that

00:36:07.692 --> 00:36:10.977
whatever things we have left to come to Sahaja Yoga

00:36:11.178 --> 00:36:15.536
have become multi-fold

00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:27.150
and this marriage system that we have started in India

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:31.213
is becoming a headache to Me now.

00:36:35.665 --> 00:36:38.954
Either they fight as usual and divorce

00:36:39.154 --> 00:36:45.106
or they get glued together. There’s nothing in-between.

00:36:51.314 --> 00:36:55.980
They don’t understand that they have married for Sahaja Yoga

00:36:59.709 --> 00:37:07.400
and they have to use marriage for Sahaja Yog only.

00:37:12.524 --> 00:37:21.933
But this attitude of Sahaja yogis is very surprising,

00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:25.227
because I always felt after Self Realization

00:37:25.427 --> 00:37:30.558
they will be automatically sanyassis from within.

00:37:39.956 --> 00:37:44.297
They will themselves be like Mahavira’s disciples,

00:37:48.676 --> 00:37:56.438
but what I find is that still they are always falling back into

00:37:56.638 --> 00:38:02.711
the same ocean from which they have come on to the boat.

00:38:08.608 --> 00:38:12.224
For example, now somebody was fond of seeing films

00:38:12.424 --> 00:38:17.011
or, say, football, of all the things football.

00:38:19.368 --> 00:38:22.047
So they are still busy with football.

00:38:22.247 --> 00:38:25.897
It's become a craze with football,

00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:34.252
or a picnic or a holiday or a sea resort.

00:38:40.022 --> 00:38:44.853
After Realization how can you enjoy these things so much?

00:38:49.123 --> 00:38:54.318
That means you have not touched that depth within you yet.

00:39:00.032 --> 00:39:02.910
Your depth of joy you have not yet touched.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.466
Still you have to touch it. Once you have touched that

00:39:05.666 --> 00:39:11.753
you really don’t care for anything. Just don’t bother for anything.

00:39:17.377 --> 00:39:22.980
You are so self-contented you just enjoy your Self.

00:39:30.959 --> 00:39:35.894
But I do not know if I should tell you about hell

00:39:36.094 --> 00:39:40.264
and frighten you, or I should put restrictions on you,

00:39:40.464 --> 00:39:47.391
but this is the one, Mahavira’s puja, I have been avoiding…

00:39:47.591 --> 00:39:50.591
so far.

00:40:00.684 --> 00:40:06.684
Even the ladies have to take out all their hair

00:40:08.766 --> 00:40:16.432
and wear only white one sari and one blouse, that’s all.

00:40:19.976 --> 00:40:23.808
No shoes

00:40:24.008 --> 00:40:30.939
and also had to walk. Never get into a bullock cart,

00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:34.909
leave alone cars.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:42.333
They had to get up at four o’clock, have their food till six only

00:40:42.533 --> 00:40:46.168
and then sleep off.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.715
There is forty days purgation

00:40:55.915 --> 00:41:00.603
when you have to only live on water, only water.

00:41:04.709 --> 00:41:09.749
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s the other way round, it’s all enjoyment.

00:41:12.741 --> 00:41:15.087
You enjoy everything. You enjoy each other’s company.

00:41:15.287 --> 00:41:19.755
You enjoy music. There’s all enjoyment for you.

00:41:22.803 --> 00:41:26.846
But without touching your inner enjoyment you cannot,

00:41:27.046 --> 00:41:30.322
you cannot ascend. You must touch your inner enjoyment

00:41:30.522 --> 00:41:34.534
and then enjoy everything else.

00:41:43.652 --> 00:41:48.246
And any hard word said, even one word said hard

00:41:48.446 --> 00:41:52.023
they had to repent and go on fast for days together

00:41:52.223 --> 00:41:56.804
for saying one harsh word.

00:42:02.864 --> 00:42:06.164
But here people go, suddenly I find they are walking nicely

00:42:06.364 --> 00:42:09.791
and suddenly they get onto the horse of a ego

00:42:09.991 --> 00:42:13.878
and start jumping on others.

00:42:20.036 --> 00:42:23.329
The whole, see is so jocular I tell you.

00:42:23.529 --> 00:42:26.965
I just watch suddenly what was, he was a nice fellow walking

00:42:27.166 --> 00:42:29.043
just now. Suddenly what has happened to him?

00:42:29.243 --> 00:42:32.766
Suddenly he started behaving like this.

00:42:38.179 --> 00:42:40.932
I never wanted to frighten you about the hell

00:42:41.132 --> 00:42:44.994
but there is hell I must say.

00:42:51.319 --> 00:42:55.035
And so one has to go deeper into your own enjoyment

00:42:55.235 --> 00:42:59.442
so that there is complete contentment.

00:43:07.553 --> 00:43:10.081
So the things that are said about Mahavira

00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:13.572
are taken to the extreme that one day He was meditating

00:43:13.772 --> 00:43:16.680
and He had only one piece of cloth on Him

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.231
wrapped with a dhoti

00:43:19.431 --> 00:43:23.589
and He had covered Himself up with one piece of cloth.

00:43:30.916 --> 00:43:33.415
So when He was coming out of His meditation

00:43:33.615 --> 00:43:39.867
His cloth got entangled with some bush.

00:43:40.067 --> 00:43:44.586
So He had to take off half of it.

00:43:52.998 --> 00:43:58.039
Then Krishna came to tease Him as an, as a

00:43:58.239 --> 00:44:01.985
what do you call, a beggar.

00:44:06.437 --> 00:44:09.689
And He said, “You are a king and You can always get

00:44:09.889 --> 00:44:12.110
something cloth but I am shivering,

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:17.021
so why don’t You give Me this piece of cloth that You have.”

00:44:23.045 --> 00:44:25.684
So He gave Him His cloth

00:44:25.884 --> 00:44:29.557
and covered Himself with some leaves and went into His palace

00:44:29.757 --> 00:44:32.216
and changed Himself.

00:44:32.416 --> 00:44:36.523
Into His house and changed His clothes.

00:44:42.698 --> 00:44:45.180
So these horrible Jains

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:49.031
make His complete nude photographs so huge.

00:44:49.231 --> 00:44:51.927
Hundred and fifty feet height nude

00:44:52.127 --> 00:44:57.479
absolutely nude into details they work it out, stupid things.

00:45:07.146 --> 00:45:09.523
And there are followers of His, so called,

00:45:09.723 --> 00:45:12.502
He never had such followers but they call themselves

00:45:12.702 --> 00:45:14.623
as degambaras.

00:45:14.823 --> 00:45:18.484
Means they do not have cloth but their cloth is all the directions

00:45:18.684 --> 00:45:24.089
degambar, directions are their cloth,

00:45:31.235 --> 00:45:34.789
and they’ll walk on the street, walk everywhere in the villages

00:45:34.989 --> 00:45:38.728
absolutely nude.

00:45:42.053 --> 00:45:49.145
I mean horrible things people do in the name of Mahavira.

00:45:53.876 --> 00:45:56.231
Now as you have got realization

00:45:56.431 --> 00:46:00.618
I am sure you won’t go to that extreme.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:12.540
But still you must learn to have self-discipline.

00:46:16.143 --> 00:46:21.676
If you have no self-discipline you cannot jump into that depth,

00:46:21.876 --> 00:46:27.845
where there is complete kavalyan, means absolute knowledge,

00:46:28.045 --> 00:46:33.886
absolute love and absolute joy.

00:46:44.239 --> 00:46:48.039
So this self-disciplining is very important.

00:46:48.239 --> 00:46:51.198
Of course, you need not go to the Mahavira’s extent now,

00:46:51.398 --> 00:46:54.321
because luckily I have given you Realization

00:46:54.521 --> 00:46:59.656
but still do not go back to things, which you have left.

00:47:07.185 --> 00:47:09.441
As men also do stupid things

00:47:09.641 --> 00:47:12.509
also women do it in Sahaja Yoga which is surprising.

00:47:12.709 --> 00:47:19.067
People told me that they carry so many make-ups with them to India.

00:47:27.093 --> 00:47:31.385
What is the use? I just don’t understand.

00:47:31.585 --> 00:47:35.888
To, to I mean for Indians it is useless

00:47:36.088 --> 00:47:39.173
and it is absolutely useless for you also.

00:47:39.373 --> 00:47:43.030
You are saints. There is no need to load yourselves

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:47.664
with so many things unnecessarily.

00:47:54.132 --> 00:47:56.620
So if you again indulge into the same nonsense

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.691
that you have been doing; going to the hairdresser,

00:47:59.891 --> 00:48:03.136
looking funny in the hair, all sorts of things if you do,

00:48:03.336 --> 00:48:08.101
then what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:16.494
Or following any fashion and these things.

00:48:16.694 --> 00:48:19.288
If you have to do the same thing again and again

00:48:19.488 --> 00:48:23.901
it is better, you don’t come to Sahaja Yog.

00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:32.246
That’s all I can say. I cannot say like Mahavira that:

00:48:32.446 --> 00:48:36.563
‘you shave your hair,’ or ‘you wear just a white sari.’

00:48:36.763 --> 00:48:41.398
But I can only say that: ‘try to detach yourself.’

00:48:50.274 --> 00:48:52.812
I was sure with My experiment, that people

00:48:53.012 --> 00:48:58.457
when they get Realization gradually they’ll get detached

00:49:04.351 --> 00:49:06.843
and you all have to co-operate with Me:

00:49:07.043 --> 00:49:11.068
to see where is your attention.

00:49:15.909 --> 00:49:20.226
What are we doing the whole day?

00:49:20.426 --> 00:49:24.274
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:49:24.474 --> 00:49:29.609
How many people we have given Realization?

00:49:30.228 --> 00:49:35.213
Everything seems to be important but Sahaja Yog.

00:49:38.736 --> 00:49:43.769
But Mahavira’s day people did not do any jobs, nothing.

00:49:43.969 --> 00:49:51.056
They had to live in jungles, they had to beg for their food

00:50:04.018 --> 00:50:08.645
and that’s how this Jainism has spread.

00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:17.151
But what sort of a Jainism it is I have told you already.

00:50:20.613 --> 00:50:23.325
So unless and until you touch your depth

00:50:23.525 --> 00:50:26.397
you’ll become like any other religion,

00:50:26.597 --> 00:50:35.075
because you won’t be actually Sahaja Yogis, just nominal.

00:50:46.408 --> 00:50:50.034
So we have to work in such a manner that

00:50:50.234 --> 00:50:54.559
we understand ourselves and we understand our attention

00:50:54.759 --> 00:50:59.624
and we try to ascend.

00:51:06.356 --> 00:51:10.113
I don’t have to tell you. You yourself have to work it out

00:51:10.313 --> 00:51:12.791
in such a manner that you touch your depth

00:51:12.991 --> 00:51:18.610
and you become an ascetic within yourself.

00:51:24.943 --> 00:51:32.585
Then only you will be really doing the Divine work properly

00:51:32.785 --> 00:51:37.154
with proper understanding.

00:51:43.004 --> 00:51:47.264
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all these great prophets

00:51:47.464 --> 00:51:51.798
and these incarnations.

00:51:57.508 --> 00:52:01.052
So I have to tell you that, whatever were your conditionings

00:52:01.252 --> 00:52:03.546
and all that, to get rid of them,

00:52:03.746 --> 00:52:08.477
you must get out of this ocean of illusion.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:22.454
So this is the only thing I can just now say about Mahavira

00:52:22.654 --> 00:52:26.906
but lots can be said because of the, He deals with the past.

00:52:27.106 --> 00:52:32.518
All His past lives and everything are described,

00:52:40.613 --> 00:52:42.961
but that is not so important. What is important

00:52:43.161 --> 00:52:47.034
is what is today the present.

00:52:50.688 --> 00:52:53.662
I hope My lecture goes into your head

00:52:53.862 --> 00:52:58.386
and settles into your heart

00:53:02.925 --> 00:53:07.297
and you understand what you have to do about yourself,

00:53:07.497 --> 00:53:12.614
about your ascent. You have to be genuine people.

00:53:17.733 --> 00:53:22.730
