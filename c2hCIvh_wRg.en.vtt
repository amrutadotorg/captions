WEBVTT

03:43.284 --> 03:50.308
Shri Mahavira Puja. Barcelona (Spain), 17 June 1990.

06:51.984 --> 06:55.664
Today we are going to do  puja of Mahavira

06:55.864 --> 07:00.277
and we never had this puja before.

07:08.549 --> 07:11.835
The reason for this was that

07:12.036 --> 07:18.642
Mahavira’s life was an ascetic’s life,

07:23.688 --> 07:27.617
just like Buddha.

07:29.220 --> 07:34.258
Even more than Buddha it would be

07:34.458 --> 07:41.102
because at the time when these two were born,

07:46.768 --> 07:53.360
the Brahminism of the Hinduism had taken a very funny form.

07:59.124 --> 08:01.528
People had become extremely ritualistic

08:01.728 --> 08:04.687
and they were worshipping all kinds of stones

08:04.887 --> 08:10.741
and all kinds of things instead of worshipping only the swayambu.

08:21.123 --> 08:25.441
Who is that fellow eating food at the time.

08:26.782 --> 08:29.793
There is a gentleman who is eating food at the time of a –

08:29.993 --> 08:33.486
Please tell him.

08:49.207 --> 08:53.881
Let it be, let it be open (the window).

08:56.230 --> 09:01.345
The ascetic life of Mahavira

09:01.545 --> 09:05.386
was of a very, very extreme nature.

09:12.433 --> 09:22.834
He was the one who was born in a clan of warriors, Kshatriyas,

09:27.469 --> 09:31.252
and then He was also married.

09:34.077 --> 09:38.250
Also He had a daughter

09:38.450 --> 09:43.039
and then He decided – because He knew He had

09:43.239 --> 09:49.030
to do the work of the Divine –

09:49.230 --> 09:52.762
He decided to take a sanyasa.

09:59.165 --> 10:01.250
So He took the permission of His brother,

10:01.450 --> 10:03.703
because His parents were dead.

10:03.903 --> 10:08.028
He was a king, so He gave up all His material wealth,

10:08.228 --> 10:13.185
everything and He became a complete sanyasi.

10:24.898 --> 10:33.235
And He left His family, left His house everything behind

10:33.435 --> 10:40.398
and went alone with a little bowl for begging alms.

10:49.081 --> 10:54.104
And the people who joined Him were very few

10:54.304 --> 10:59.574
and He asked them that : “ you have to also become ascetics”, munis.

11:06.384 --> 11:09.964
He was a reincarnation of St. Michael

11:13.823 --> 11:18.290
and He resides on the left side

11:18.490 --> 11:22.121
on the Ida Nadi.

11:22.321 --> 11:25.574
And He looks after the whole of it,

11:25.774 --> 11:30.742
right from Mooladhara onwards up to the Sahasrara.

11:36.052 --> 11:41.171
So St Michael was born as Mahavira,

11:44.873 --> 11:49.087
meaning the greatest warrior.

11:51.663 --> 11:57.630
But when He was born, the whole place got lot of prosperity.

11:57.830 --> 12:01.987
That’s why He was called as Vardhaman, to begin with.

12:11.725 --> 12:16.859
But His asceticism was there because of the Brahminism

12:17.059 --> 12:18.978
that was so prevalent in those days,

12:19.178 --> 12:23.827
and people were absolutely drowned into it.

12:30.874 --> 12:36.166
After Shri Krishna, these two persons, Buddha and Mahavira,

12:36.366 --> 12:40.402
both of them incarnated in India.

12:47.680 --> 12:50.853
As you know, their history is very far out because

12:51.053 --> 12:55.628
they were the children of Rama and they were two twins,

12:55.828 --> 12:59.964
called as Lav and Kush.

13:06.903 --> 13:11.886
So Rama led a life of a very great king,

13:12.086 --> 13:16.125
benevolent king, and of lots of limitations,

13:16.325 --> 13:19.325
mariada Purushottama.

13:25.579 --> 13:30.947
Because of that, people became extremely serious and

13:31.147 --> 13:40.373
also very closed, because of Rama’s following.

13:45.737 --> 13:49.410
Of course after every incarnation,

13:49.610 --> 13:52.974
as they do not get their Realization, they get deviated

13:53.174 --> 13:57.967
and start going to the extremes of everything.

14:04.526 --> 14:10.326
So they went to the extremes and became very, very much –

14:10.526 --> 14:13.909
sort of quiet people wouldn’t talk to anyone

14:14.109 --> 14:16.996
and would be very formal sort of people,

14:17.196 --> 14:22.379
because that was the life Rama had to live, lead.

14:32.161 --> 14:36.557
And because Rama left His wife, many people at that time

14:36.757 --> 14:42.162
felt that wife is not to be paid so much attention to.

14:49.848 --> 14:55.232
So Shri Krishna came. Actually Rama took birth as Shri Krishna

14:55.432 --> 14:58.432
to overcome these conditionings.

15:06.388 --> 15:10.404
And He said, “All this is leela. This is all a play.”

15:14.114 --> 15:17.565
And that it is a play and you should have pure heart

15:17.765 --> 15:20.485
and you can play about.

15:20.685 --> 15:24.485
There is, as long as you have pure character,

15:24.685 --> 15:30.162
nothing can go wrong if you mix up with people freely.

15:39.740 --> 15:43.081
So after Shri Krishna, people started becoming

15:43.281 --> 15:47.869
very licentious and permissive

15:54.235 --> 15:58.622
and they created poems and things of Krishna’s love stories,

15:58.822 --> 16:02.309
which was all false.

16:06.618 --> 16:10.450
Because He lived with Radha at the age of five or six years,

16:10.650 --> 16:14.563
and with the, in the Gokul.

16:19.301 --> 16:24.331
So all these false stories about Him were used

16:24.532 --> 16:29.318
for the licentiousness of the people.

16:34.161 --> 16:41.271
So now, the situation was such, that the whole place

16:41.471 --> 16:46.542
was getting completely drowned into immorality.

16:51.987 --> 16:54.746
The priests, the Brahmins themselves, had become

16:54.946 --> 16:57.786
extremely immoral and

16:57.986 --> 17:03.343
were indulging into all kinds of corrupt practices.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.182
Not only that, but they took to tantric,

17:15.382 --> 17:22.751
tantric manifestations of using spirits and things like that,

17:29.481 --> 17:33.482
and became very self-indulgent.

17:36.403 --> 17:42.966
At that time Buddha, Lord Buddha and Mahavira were born

17:48.935 --> 17:53.084
to de-condition people

17:53.284 --> 17:57.625
from this kind of an extreme behaviour,

18:02.773 --> 18:05.731
because whatever the incarnations tried,

18:05.931 --> 18:10.550
people always went to the extremes.

18:15.344 --> 18:20.293
So they found out that people were very much indulgent

18:20.493 --> 18:27.660
in killing animals and eating flesh all the time

18:32.016 --> 18:35.260
and if you eat too much of flesh and all that you become

18:35.460 --> 18:39.285
right sided personality

18:42.926 --> 18:47.854
and so then you become very aggressive

18:50.842 --> 18:54.564
and start killing others.

18:56.389 --> 19:00.715
Moreover the people who were very much attached to their family

19:00.915 --> 19:04.168
or to their children and all that

19:04.368 --> 19:10.312
would not do the work of the Divine

19:18.685 --> 19:23.778
and it was a very intensive work which He had to do.

19:26.580 --> 19:31.564
So He made very strict rules as Moses did.

19:36.716 --> 19:40.262
He said that nobody should kill

19:40.462 --> 19:43.891
any animal and eat it first of all.

19:49.922 --> 19:56.291
Those who are becoming the munis or the bhikshus

19:56.491 --> 20:00.973
should not even go on any bullock cart;

20:01.173 --> 20:05.903
should walk bare feet; should not even wear shoes.

20:12.613 --> 20:14.794
They should shave their head completely;

20:14.994 --> 20:19.429
should have only three changes, three dresses

20:19.629 --> 20:25.346
with them of a big tunic-like thing.

20:30.655 --> 20:35.873
Whether it is sun or rain, they should not use any umbrellas.

20:41.666 --> 20:46.319
They should eat before six o’clock; before the sun sets.

20:49.888 --> 20:53.277
They should sleep only for five hours

20:55.563 --> 20:59.371
and all the time meditate and ascend

20:59.571 --> 21:04.283
and then try to do the work of the Divine.

21:09.442 --> 21:13.794
Then only they can do the work of the Divine.

21:17.564 --> 21:22.571
After they get their Realization that, He called as Kevalagyan,

21:22.771 --> 21:27.898
only the knowledge, only knowledge, means pure knowledge.

21:33.406 --> 21:35.793
They will develop Samvaddharshan means

21:35.993 --> 21:40.057
integrated personality .

21:43.787 --> 21:48.724
and all the collective consciousness He talked of all, all these things

21:50.899 --> 21:53.169
but as He belonged to the left side,

21:53.369 --> 21:58.448
He has described hell very clearly.

22:03.703 --> 22:09.394
Fundamentally, basically there are fourteen hells according to Him

22:13.156 --> 22:19.744
and is horrible to read all that what He has described about hell.

22:23.332 --> 22:25.512
Because He wanted to tell people that

22:25.712 --> 22:30.418
if you do all these wrong things you will go to hell

22:35.700 --> 22:40.794
and He talked about, not about form, formly God,

22:40.994 --> 22:45.234
but formless God,

22:48.766 --> 22:54.158
because He didn’t want people to again start ritualism

22:56.168 --> 22:59.952
but get to right, right to the position

23:00.152 --> 23:05.207
where they could get their Self Realization to cleanse themselves.

23:10.289 --> 23:14.946
So you can imagine how difficult in those days at Mahavira

23:15.146 --> 23:22.560
was even to be one of the candidates for Self-realization.

23:29.703 --> 23:33.341
It’s frightening for you.

23:35.198 --> 23:41.998
That’s why I never had this puja.

23:44.807 --> 23:48.678
Because to do all these things first of all

23:48.878 --> 23:51.411
and to become absolutely pure,

23:51.611 --> 23:55.722
then only He would give realization.

24:02.315 --> 24:05.027
I wonder how many got realization.

24:05.227 --> 24:11.767
But the way He made rules for people was so strict.

24:20.171 --> 24:22.414
Nobody would have followed Him.

24:22.614 --> 24:25.564
But He told them about the hell in which they will go

24:25.764 --> 24:29.336
if they don’t follow.

24:34.359 --> 24:38.159
So they were so frightened that they joined Him

24:38.359 --> 24:43.126
and started following Jainism. ‘Jain’ means ‘the one who has known,

24:43.326 --> 24:47.882
who is enlightened, gnayan.’

24:55.148 --> 24:58.749
Is the, the same word is gnayan means ‘to know.’

24:58.949 --> 25:02.561
‘Ja’ – it means ‘to know.’

25:05.100 --> 25:08.527
Just like the Jews. Is the same word

25:08.727 --> 25:12.917
is the ‘Jew’ means also ‘the one who knows.’

25:15.479 --> 25:19.210
Moses also did the same.

25:20.583 --> 25:23.518
He didn’t say that you should not eat meat

25:23.718 --> 25:28.065
but He said that if anybody is found with another woman

25:28.265 --> 25:31.741
he should be killed.

25:37.093 --> 25:43.337
The Muslims as they follow Sharia is made by Moses for the Jews

25:43.537 --> 25:49.235
because they had become so self-indulgent.

25:51.846 --> 25:55.834
The Sharia that is followed by Muslims

25:56.034 --> 26:00.200
is made by Moses for the Jews

26:06.772 --> 26:09.612
because when He brought those ten commandments

26:09.812 --> 26:12.932
He found the Jews were indulging into

26:13.132 --> 26:17.156
all kinds of nonsensical things.

26:22.266 --> 26:25.002
But Jews very nicely put it on the shelf

26:25.202 --> 26:28.956
and the Muslims took to it.

26:33.711 --> 26:40.822
So now this Mahavira style went to the extreme as usual

26:45.431 --> 26:49.526
even Lord Buddha’s same thing.

26:54.300 --> 26:57.084
Mahavira was the one who said that

26:57.284 --> 26:59.536
you should not kill any animal,

26:59.736 --> 27:06.153
so now in India we have people who are absolutely abstaining

27:06.353 --> 27:10.845
from even killing bugs and killing even mosquitoes.

27:20.465 --> 27:23.684
How far human beings can go to stupidity

27:23.884 --> 27:27.686
can be seen from this.

27:33.257 --> 27:37.694
Nowadays there’s a custom, very common in India,

27:37.894 --> 27:40.282
that they take get hold of a Brahmin,

27:40.482 --> 27:45.016
put him in a hut and put all the bugs inside

27:52.040 --> 27:58.421
and when these bugs have got completely, have got completely,

27:58.621 --> 28:02.808
fed up with the drinking of the blood of this Brahmin

28:03.008 --> 28:06.008
they just drop out.

28:10.221 --> 28:14.124
Then this Brahmin is paid a big amount by the Jains

28:14.324 --> 28:17.837
who have lots of money.

28:23.988 --> 28:28.235
They are vegetarians to such an extent

28:28.435 --> 28:32.227
that they don’t want to go to the bathroom,

28:32.427 --> 28:35.353
but they’ll go on some sort of a open space

28:35.553 --> 28:38.942
that no animal should die.

28:47.573 --> 28:51.796
Such ridiculous things they do

28:53.319 --> 28:59.423
and in the, in all doing all this abstinence and all that

28:59.623 --> 29:03.671
they are extremely money oriented.

29:08.010 --> 29:11.754
Jains are just like Jews in India.

29:11.954 --> 29:17.816
Jains and Jews are the same in their money orientation.

29:23.347 --> 29:26.997
So the Jains won’t kill even a bug or a mosquito

29:27.197 --> 29:32.145
but they don’t mind harassing a man up to his death

29:32.345 --> 29:35.876
for their two rupees.

29:46.093 --> 29:52.461
So this extreme temperament is seen in every religion

29:57.620 --> 30:01.070
and that comes because human beings start moving like

30:01.270 --> 30:05.422
a pendulum from one end to another.

30:09.134 --> 30:13.039
An incarnation comes and tries to bring them in the center

30:13.240 --> 30:17.840
but again they start moving on the other side.

30:22.024 --> 30:24.046
They cannot remain in the center.

30:24.246 --> 30:28.040
This is the problem of the human beings

30:31.241 --> 30:35.313
and this is why all religions look so funny.

30:40.224 --> 30:42.929
When you see the way the Jains are,

30:43.129 --> 30:45.659
I mean, you are surprised and

30:45.859 --> 30:51.374
can’t believe how stupid they are; educated people, doctors,

30:58.413 --> 31:03.485
but they never know that, they never understand that they are stupid.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.737
So this is the story of Mahavira

31:09.937 --> 31:14.380
where He has tried to bring in a kind...

31:14.580 --> 31:16.896
(…) you will please sit down. Who is that lady?

31:17.096 --> 31:19.523
Don’t move around.

31:19.723 --> 31:22.007
You shouldn’t get up and walk when I am talking.

31:22.207 --> 31:24.286
All right? Tell her.

31:24.487 --> 31:26.309
They are eating, they are walking about.

31:26.509 --> 31:31.223
Will you please tell the Spanish to behave themselves.

31:43.530 --> 31:47.044
When I started Sahaja Yoga if I’d started like Mahavira

31:47.244 --> 31:50.998
how many would have joined Me?

31:57.838 --> 32:00.136
Even when we have raised the Kundalini,

32:00.336 --> 32:05.910
you have got your Realization there is not much of detachment.

32:14.645 --> 32:17.508
Sanyassi meant that he had nothing to do with his wife,

32:17.708 --> 32:21.350
nothing to do with his children, nothing to do with his family

32:21.550 --> 32:26.518
or house or anything possessions, no possessions.

32:32.883 --> 32:36.093
But...

32:59.004 --> 33:01.004
And...

33:07.174 --> 33:13.668
They were given such a little to eat

33:13.868 --> 33:16.938
without any, just boiled food,

33:17.138 --> 33:24.646
just boiled and such strict order.

33:36.287 --> 33:41.476
But in Sahaja Yoga I have first of all raised your Kundalini

33:41.676 --> 33:44.429
without telling you any ritual,

33:44.629 --> 33:48.525
any what you can call strictness or anything about it.

33:48.725 --> 33:53.256
Just whatever you are, all right, get your Realization.

34:01.415 --> 34:07.957
And I thought that by raising the Kundalini, by Self Realization,

34:08.157 --> 34:12.679
I need not tell them about hell.

34:12.879 --> 34:19.175
Only by that, they will become quite detached and wise.

34:26.850 --> 34:30.819
But even now what you find is that there are people

34:31.019 --> 34:38.239
who get married in Sahaja Yoga and just get lost.

34:45.675 --> 34:48.528
Either the wife dominates or the husband dominates

34:48.728 --> 34:53.561
or both of them get completely lost.

34:59.413 --> 35:03.181
Normally in the western countries as soon as they get married,

35:03.381 --> 35:08.461
first second day they start quarrelling

35:12.888 --> 35:17.499
and within one week they start talking about divorce.

35:20.274 --> 35:23.010
But in Sahaja Yoga when they get married

35:23.210 --> 35:27.996
they just get attached to each other like glue you see.

35:33.429 --> 35:36.689
Then there is no other interest left all the time thinking

35:36.889 --> 35:41.546
of wife, wife, wife or husband, husband, husband,

35:46.966 --> 35:50.813
someone to go for honeymoon, someone to do it

35:51.013 --> 35:55.386
in a very big way with a reception and things.

36:01.208 --> 36:05.079
The importance is given so much,

36:05.279 --> 36:07.492
that it is unbelievable that

36:07.692 --> 36:10.977
whatever things we have left to come to Sahaja Yoga

36:11.178 --> 36:15.536
have become multi-fold

36:23.540 --> 36:27.150
and this marriage system that we have started in India

36:27.350 --> 36:31.213
is becoming a headache to Me now.

36:35.665 --> 36:38.954
Either they fight as usual and divorce

36:39.154 --> 36:45.106
or they get glued together. There’s nothing in-between.

36:51.314 --> 36:55.980
They don’t understand that they have married for Sahaja Yoga

36:59.709 --> 37:07.400
and they have to use marriage for Sahaja Yog only.

37:12.524 --> 37:21.933
But this attitude of Sahaja yogis is very surprising,

37:22.133 --> 37:25.227
because I always felt after Self Realization

37:25.427 --> 37:30.558
they will be automatically sanyassis from within.

37:39.956 --> 37:44.297
They will themselves be like Mahavira’s disciples,

37:48.676 --> 37:56.438
but what I find is that still they are always falling back into

37:56.638 --> 38:02.711
the same ocean from which they have come on to the boat.

38:08.608 --> 38:12.224
For example, now somebody was fond of seeing films

38:12.424 --> 38:17.011
or, say, football, of all the things football.

38:19.368 --> 38:22.047
So they are still busy with football.

38:22.247 --> 38:25.897
It's become a craze with football,

38:29.516 --> 38:34.252
or a picnic or a holiday or a sea resort.

38:40.022 --> 38:44.853
After Realization how can you enjoy these things so much?

38:49.123 --> 38:54.318
That means you have not touched that depth within you yet.

39:00.032 --> 39:02.910
Your depth of joy you have not yet touched.

39:03.110 --> 39:05.466
Still you have to touch it. Once you have touched that

39:05.666 --> 39:11.753
you really don’t care for anything. Just don’t bother for anything.

39:17.377 --> 39:22.980
You are so self-contented you just enjoy your Self.

39:30.959 --> 39:35.894
But I do not know if I should tell you about hell

39:36.094 --> 39:40.264
and frighten you, or I should put restrictions on you,

39:40.464 --> 39:47.391
but this is the one, Mahavira’s puja, I have been avoiding…

39:47.591 --> 39:50.591
so far.

40:00.684 --> 40:06.684
Even the ladies have to take out all their hair

40:08.766 --> 40:16.432
and wear only white one sari and one blouse, that’s all.

40:19.976 --> 40:23.808
No shoes

40:24.008 --> 40:30.939
and also had to walk. Never get into a bullock cart,

40:31.139 --> 40:34.909
leave alone cars.

40:38.210 --> 40:42.333
They had to get up at four o’clock, have their food till six only

40:42.533 --> 40:46.168
and then sleep off.

40:53.690 --> 40:55.715
There is forty days purgation

40:55.915 --> 41:00.603
when you have to only live on water, only water.

41:04.709 --> 41:09.749
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s the other way round, it’s all enjoyment.

41:12.741 --> 41:15.087
You enjoy everything. You enjoy each other’s company.

41:15.287 --> 41:19.755
You enjoy music. There’s all enjoyment for you.

41:22.803 --> 41:26.846
But without touching your inner enjoyment you cannot,

41:27.046 --> 41:30.322
you cannot ascend. You must touch your inner enjoyment

41:30.522 --> 41:34.534
and then enjoy everything else.

41:43.652 --> 41:48.246
And any hard word said, even one word said hard

41:48.446 --> 41:52.023
they had to repent and go on fast for days together

41:52.223 --> 41:56.804
for saying one harsh word.

42:02.864 --> 42:06.164
But here people go, suddenly I find they are walking nicely

42:06.364 --> 42:09.791
and suddenly they get onto the horse of a ego

42:09.991 --> 42:13.878
and start jumping on others.

42:20.036 --> 42:23.329
The whole, see is so jocular I tell you.

42:23.529 --> 42:26.965
I just watch suddenly what was, he was a nice fellow walking

42:27.166 --> 42:29.043
just now. Suddenly what has happened to him?

42:29.243 --> 42:32.766
Suddenly he started behaving like this.

42:38.179 --> 42:40.932
I never wanted to frighten you about the hell

42:41.132 --> 42:44.994
but there is hell I must say.

42:51.319 --> 42:55.035
And so one has to go deeper into your own enjoyment

42:55.235 --> 42:59.442
so that there is complete contentment.

43:07.553 --> 43:10.081
So the things that are said about Mahavira

43:10.281 --> 43:13.572
are taken to the extreme that one day He was meditating

43:13.772 --> 43:16.680
and He had only one piece of cloth on Him

43:16.880 --> 43:19.231
wrapped with a dhoti

43:19.431 --> 43:23.589
and He had covered Himself up with one piece of cloth.

43:30.916 --> 43:33.415
So when He was coming out of His meditation

43:33.615 --> 43:39.867
His cloth got entangled with some bush.

43:40.067 --> 43:44.586
So He had to take off half of it.

43:52.998 --> 43:58.039
Then Krishna came to tease Him as an, as a

43:58.239 --> 44:01.985
what do you call, a beggar.

44:06.437 --> 44:09.689
And He said, “You are a king and You can always get

44:09.889 --> 44:12.110
something cloth but I am shivering,

44:12.310 --> 44:17.021
so why don’t You give Me this piece of cloth that You have.”

44:23.045 --> 44:25.684
So He gave Him His cloth

44:25.884 --> 44:29.557
and covered Himself with some leaves and went into His palace

44:29.757 --> 44:32.216
and changed Himself.

44:32.416 --> 44:36.523
Into His house and changed His clothes.

44:42.698 --> 44:45.180
So these horrible Jains

44:45.380 --> 44:49.031
make His complete nude photographs so huge.

44:49.231 --> 44:51.927
Hundred and fifty feet height nude

44:52.127 --> 44:57.479
absolutely nude into details they work it out, stupid things.

45:07.146 --> 45:09.523
And there are followers of His, so called,

45:09.723 --> 45:12.502
He never had such followers but they call themselves

45:12.702 --> 45:14.623
as degambaras.

45:14.823 --> 45:18.484
Means they do not have cloth but their cloth is all the directions

45:18.684 --> 45:24.089
degambar, directions are their cloth,

45:31.235 --> 45:34.789
and they’ll walk on the street, walk everywhere in the villages

45:34.989 --> 45:38.728
absolutely nude.

45:42.053 --> 45:49.145
I mean horrible things people do in the name of Mahavira.

45:53.876 --> 45:56.231
Now as you have got realization

45:56.431 --> 46:00.618
I am sure you won’t go to that extreme.

46:06.920 --> 46:12.540
But still you must learn to have self-discipline.

46:16.143 --> 46:21.676
If you have no self-discipline you cannot jump into that depth,

46:21.876 --> 46:27.845
where there is complete kavalyan, means absolute knowledge,

46:28.045 --> 46:33.886
absolute love and absolute joy.

46:44.239 --> 46:48.039
So this self-disciplining is very important.

46:48.239 --> 46:51.198
Of course, you need not go to the Mahavira’s extent now,

46:51.398 --> 46:54.321
because luckily I have given you Realization

46:54.521 --> 46:59.656
but still do not go back to things, which you have left.

47:07.185 --> 47:09.441
As men also do stupid things

47:09.641 --> 47:12.509
also women do it in Sahaja Yoga which is surprising.

47:12.709 --> 47:19.067
People told me that they carry so many make-ups with them to India.

47:27.093 --> 47:31.385
What is the use? I just don’t understand.

47:31.585 --> 47:35.888
To, to I mean for Indians it is useless

47:36.088 --> 47:39.173
and it is absolutely useless for you also.

47:39.373 --> 47:43.030
You are saints. There is no need to load yourselves

47:43.230 --> 47:47.664
with so many things unnecessarily.

47:54.132 --> 47:56.620
So if you again indulge into the same nonsense

47:56.820 --> 47:59.691
that you have been doing; going to the hairdresser,

47:59.891 --> 48:03.136
looking funny in the hair, all sorts of things if you do,

48:03.336 --> 48:08.101
then what’s the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

48:13.649 --> 48:16.494
Or following any fashion and these things.

48:16.694 --> 48:19.288
If you have to do the same thing again and again

48:19.488 --> 48:23.901
it is better, you don’t come to Sahaja Yog.

48:28.390 --> 48:32.246
That’s all I can say. I cannot say like Mahavira that:

48:32.446 --> 48:36.563
‘you shave your hair,’ or ‘you wear just a white sari.’

48:36.763 --> 48:41.398
But I can only say that: ‘try to detach yourself.’

48:50.274 --> 48:52.812
I was sure with My experiment, that people

48:53.012 --> 48:58.457
when they get Realization gradually they’ll get detached

49:04.351 --> 49:06.843
and you all have to co-operate with Me:

49:07.043 --> 49:11.068
to see where is your attention.

49:15.909 --> 49:20.226
What are we doing the whole day?

49:20.426 --> 49:24.274
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

49:24.474 --> 49:29.609
How many people we have given Realization?

49:30.228 --> 49:35.213
Everything seems to be important but Sahaja Yog.

49:38.736 --> 49:43.769
But Mahavira’s day people did not do any jobs, nothing.

49:43.969 --> 49:51.056
They had to live in jungles, they had to beg for their food

50:04.018 --> 50:08.645
and that’s how this Jainism has spread.

50:11.921 --> 50:17.151
But what sort of a Jainism it is I have told you already.

50:20.613 --> 50:23.325
So unless and until you touch your depth

50:23.525 --> 50:26.397
you’ll become like any other religion,

50:26.597 --> 50:35.075
because you won’t be actually Sahaja Yogis, just nominal.

50:46.408 --> 50:50.034
So we have to work in such a manner that

50:50.234 --> 50:54.559
we understand ourselves and we understand our attention

50:54.759 --> 50:59.624
and we try to ascend.

51:06.356 --> 51:10.113
I don’t have to tell you. You yourself have to work it out

51:10.313 --> 51:12.791
in such a manner that you touch your depth

51:12.991 --> 51:18.610
and you become an ascetic within yourself.

51:24.943 --> 51:32.585
Then only you will be really doing the Divine work properly

51:32.785 --> 51:37.154
with proper understanding.

51:43.004 --> 51:47.264
Sahaja Yoga is the integration of all these great prophets

51:47.464 --> 51:51.798
and these incarnations.

51:57.508 --> 52:01.052
So I have to tell you that, whatever were your conditionings

52:01.252 --> 52:03.546
and all that, to get rid of them,

52:03.746 --> 52:08.477
you must get out of this ocean of illusion.

52:16.850 --> 52:22.454
So this is the only thing I can just now say about Mahavira

52:22.654 --> 52:26.906
but lots can be said because of the, He deals with the past.

52:27.106 --> 52:32.518
All His past lives and everything are described,

52:40.613 --> 52:42.961
but that is not so important. What is important

52:43.161 --> 52:47.034
is what is today the present.

52:50.688 --> 52:53.662
I hope My lecture goes into your head

52:53.862 --> 52:58.386
and settles into your heart

53:02.925 --> 53:07.297
and you understand what you have to do about yourself,

53:07.497 --> 53:12.614
about your ascent. You have to be genuine people.

53:17.733 --> 53:22.730
Then only it is going to show results in the whole world.

53:30.278 --> 53:34.902
I hope you will pass this tape to all the people

53:35.102 --> 53:41.451
so they should know why I didn’t have Mahavira’s Puja all these years.

53:48.942 --> 53:52.911
May God bless you all!
