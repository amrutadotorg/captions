1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,960
This is the important thing that has to happen to us:

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,720
to become the Spirit, as Christ has told us

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,040
that we have to become the Spirit,
that we are to be born again.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,560
It is again certifying ourselves.
[By saying] that we are born again you do not become!

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,520
Let us accept one thing: we are not
going to live with myths and dishonesty.

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:38,280
If we are going to be honest
with ourselves it is beneficial to us.

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,447
It is benevolent for us to be honest with ourselves and
to realise

8
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:47,313
that by giving ourselves certificates we do not become
anything.

9
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:50,153
It’s only a mental projection.

10
00:00:50,273 --> 00:00:56,665
To reach that absolute stage this Kundalini has to rise.

11
00:00:56,785 --> 00:01:04,052
There’s no other way out. 
And this is what is the Holy Ghost within us.

12
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:08,572
This is the Holy Ghost, it the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

13
00:01:08,698 --> 00:01:17,060
And Holy Ghost is the energy of God, which is Love, which is His desire.

14
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:24,323
His desire is the Holy Ghost, and is reflected within us as the Kundalini.

15
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:32,492
So the desire of God is that you should become the citizen of His Kingdom,

16
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:40,692
that you should enter into His Kingdom
and enjoy all the fruits of His blessings:

17
00:01:40,818 --> 00:01:46,762
understandingly, knowingly, on your central nervous system.

18
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:53,181
This is his pure desire, and if that pure desire within us rises,

19
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:58,922
then we see that all our desires were useless, and they are not pure, either.

20
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,292
Because we have some desire, say, for example,

21
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,925
we want to have a car: all right, have a car; then we want to have a house: have a house.

22
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:11,322
They are never satisfied. 
In general, it is said that wants are not satiable

23
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:15,463
because they are not [real] wants, they are artificial wants.

24
00:02:15,583 --> 00:02:22,712
The real want, the real desire, is this one: 
this energy of pure desire

25
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:25,918
that says you have to unite,

26
00:02:26,044 --> 00:02:30,558
unite with the Divine, with the All-pervading Power of God.

27
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:35,926
That is our pure desire, and unless and until that desire is completed,

28
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:39,497
you may do any kind of things, you may go to all kinds of things,

29
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:43,652
try anything: you can never achieve it.

30
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:49,182
Now, this is a living process because God is a living being. 
He is not empty words.

31
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:53,796
He is not just something like a dead book. He’s not.

32
00:02:53,916 --> 00:03:03,283
He is a living God. He is a living energy and this is a living process,

33
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:08,932
so it has to be spontaneous. It has to be spontaneous if it is living.

34
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:15,269
For example, there is a seed and you want to sprout it. 
Can you order it?

35
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,144
Can you mentally say, “All right, it has now sprouted.”?

36
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:25,681
Can you say that, “All right, I read these mantras 
to you, or Bible to you,” or do this? Will it rise?

37
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:29,983
No, it won’t. It’s a living process.

38
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:34,691
You have to place it in the Mother Earth [and] spontaneously it will rise.

39
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:38,691
You don’t have to say anything. 
You don’t have to imagine anything. It will rise.

40
00:03:38,811 --> 00:03:43,329
And that’s what it is, that this Kundalini has to be awakened

41
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:46,662
in the same manner, in the living process.
