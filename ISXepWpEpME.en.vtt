00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:11.884
Everybody was feeling very nice 
when they came here,

00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:18.401
happy, and they felt their vibrations were 
all right, but it was not so.

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:25.209
You should be on the alert. 
Ask each other to check you.

00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:28.545
Be humble about it. 
You must go on checking.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.099
Unless and until you check yourself, 
how will you know

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.431
what’s the thing you are catching?

00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:38.300
Ask others to check you and be humble, 
very humble about it

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:42.854
and do not take things for granted because,

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:48.611
unless and until we transform ourselves, 
Sahaj Yoga has no meaning to you.

00:00:48.778 --> 00:00:56.987
You see, it would be a very material way 
of expression of Sahaj Yoga;

00:00:57.067 --> 00:01:09.057
like this radio or this transistor or 
this loudspeaker are just radiating.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.392
We have to know that Sahaj Yoga is not just 
to pass energy through us

00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:20.566
like all other material things are passing energy.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:26.658
This mic is passing the energy, 
this transistor is passing the energy,

00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:30.567
and all other such things 
are just passing the energy.

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:32.907
Nothing goes into them!

00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:40.396
Like an artist is singing 
and nothing passes into the radio.

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:45.048
In the same way, 
if our power starts flowing, because

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:48.920
somehow the Kundalini 
has been connected to the mains,

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.765
it has not done its job, 
neither you have done any justice to yourself.

00:01:56.931 --> 00:02:02.574
So you have to absorb 
that flow of the Ganges within you

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:06.799
and assimilate it and transform yourself.

00:02:08.444 --> 00:02:09.974
The Ganges would be flowing,

00:02:09.974 --> 00:02:17.276
but if it is flowing through the stony area,

00:02:17.496 --> 00:02:21.761
the stones are not going 
to absorb anything from the river Ganges.

00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:25.040
But if it is flowing through fertile lands,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.364
everybody will be making use of that water.

00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:34.034
So you have to make use 
of your Kundalini by transforming yourself.

00:02:34.034 --> 00:02:37.607
Try to transform. 
See how much you transform.

00:02:37.607 --> 00:02:47.717
Now, the expectation about Kundalini 
becomes so ‘sahaja’, they call it,

00:02:47.717 --> 00:02:50.386
in the very funny manner;

00:02:50.386 --> 00:02:54.545
that people think that Kundalini 
should work it out itself

00:02:54.545 --> 00:02:56.559
while we are stones on both the sides,

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.930
and the Kundalini is going to work it out, 
which is a very, very wrong idea.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.867
If the river Ganges is flowing, 
you have to go to the river,

00:03:04.988 --> 00:03:08.527
you have to fill your pitchers, 
you have to have beautiful pitchers,

00:03:08.527 --> 00:03:12.653
and you have to carry them 
and you have to bring them home and

00:03:12.653 --> 00:03:19.740
then use the water for enrichment 
of your food, of your household.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.389
In the same way, 
if you cannot transform yourself,

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.696
if you do not, cannot, change, yourself

00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:29.859
then this Kundalini will be just going 
like a thin line

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.006
and you will be catching all the time 
and there won’t be much progress.

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:38.008
The progress must be shown outside.

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.537
Those who think that 
by saying mantras morning till evening

00:03:42.537 --> 00:03:45.356
they are going to achieve much, 
they are sadly mistaken;

00:03:45.356 --> 00:03:47.583
it’s all mechanical then.

00:03:47.703 --> 00:03:51.273
So many people have a habit 
of all the time shouting mantras.

00:03:51.273 --> 00:03:57.115
It’s not habit! Mantras should open your chakras, 
otherwise, it has no meaning.

00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:01.453
They should be used properly, 
at key points,

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.980
with great respect, 
with a great understanding.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.734
And then allow them to open your chakras, 
by which you take the water in,

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:15.270
of that great thing known as Kundalini.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.404
The greatest blessing will come to you 
through Her love.

00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:23.895
But not the way people are: just they think 
there should be no transformation.

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:25.803
If you are identified with your ego

00:04:25.923 --> 00:04:29.730
and think you are all right, 
you are sadly mistaken.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.924
You have to transform completely 
within yourself.

00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:35.895
Some people, if their circumstances 
are changed,

00:04:35.895 --> 00:04:39.436
then they feel very well and they think 
oh, they have achieved the highest.

00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:40.836
It is not so.

00:04:40.836 --> 00:04:43.310
It’s only the circumstance that has changed,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.234
only the atmosphere that has changed,

00:04:45.234 --> 00:04:49.898
and that makes you feel 
that you have achieved something great.

00:04:50.096 --> 00:04:53.184
You have to achieve it 
wherever you are,

00:04:53.304 --> 00:04:55.788
and it should be retained 
and must be there.

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.134
But by coming to a quieter place, 
you can pay more attention,

00:05:00.134 --> 00:05:01.607
that’s why you are here.

00:05:01.607 --> 00:05:05.053
But by coming here, 
if you just feel nice and think that

00:05:05.053 --> 00:05:08.668
oh, you have achieved everything, 
then you are sadly mistaken.

00:05:08.668 --> 00:05:12.159
You have to grow in this atmosphere; 
you have come here to grow

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.389
and to be changed, to be 
a different person altogether.
