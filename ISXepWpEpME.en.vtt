00:07.966 --> 00:11.884
Everybody was feeling very nice
when they came here,

00:12.005 --> 00:18.401
happy, and they felt their vibrations were
all right, but it was not so.

00:19.252 --> 00:25.209
You should be on the alert.
Ask each other to check you.

00:25.276 --> 00:28.545
Be humble about it.
You must go on checking.

00:28.779 --> 00:32.099
Unless and until you check yourself,
how will you know

00:32.219 --> 00:34.431
what’s the thing you are catching?

00:34.571 --> 00:38.300
Ask others to check you and be humble,
very humble about it

00:38.387 --> 00:42.854
and do not take things for granted because,

00:43.014 --> 00:48.611
unless and until we transform ourselves,
Sahaj Yoga has no meaning to you.

00:48.778 --> 00:56.987
You see, it would be a very material way
of expression of Sahaj Yoga;

00:57.067 --> 01:09.057
like this radio or this transistor or
this loudspeaker are just radiating.

01:09.450 --> 01:16.392
We have to know that Sahaj Yoga is not just
to pass energy through us

01:16.518 --> 01:20.566
like all other material things are passing energy.

01:20.659 --> 01:26.658
This mic is passing the energy,
this transistor is passing the energy,

01:26.818 --> 01:30.567
and all other such things
are just passing the energy.

01:30.667 --> 01:32.907
Nothing goes into them!

01:33.047 --> 01:40.396
Like an artist is singing
and nothing passes into the radio.

01:40.516 --> 01:45.048
In the same way,
if our power starts flowing, because

01:45.095 --> 01:48.920
somehow the Kundalini
has been connected to the mains,

01:48.920 --> 01:56.765
it has not done its job,
neither you have done any justice to yourself.

01:56.931 --> 02:02.574
So you have to absorb
that flow of the Ganges within you

02:02.695 --> 02:06.799
and assimilate it and transform yourself.

02:08.444 --> 02:09.974
The Ganges would be flowing,

02:09.974 --> 02:17.276
but if it is flowing through the stony area,

02:17.496 --> 02:21.761
the stones are not going
to absorb anything from the river Ganges.

02:21.895 --> 02:25.040
But if it is flowing through fertile lands,

02:25.040 --> 02:28.364
everybody will be making use of that water.

02:28.593 --> 02:34.034
So you have to make use
of your Kundalini by transforming yourself.

02:34.034 --> 02:37.607
Try to transform.
See how much you transform.

02:37.607 --> 02:47.717
Now, the expectation about Kundalini
becomes so ‘sahaja’, they call it,

02:47.717 --> 02:50.386
in the very funny manner;

02:50.386 --> 02:54.545
that people think that Kundalini
should work it out itself

02:54.545 --> 02:56.559
while we are stones on both the sides,

02:56.559 --> 03:00.930
and the Kundalini is going to work it out,
which is a very, very wrong idea.

03:00.930 --> 03:04.867
If the river Ganges is flowing,
you have to go to the river,

03:04.988 --> 03:08.527
you have to fill your pitchers,
you have to have beautiful pitchers,

03:08.527 --> 03:12.653
and you have to carry them
and you have to bring them home and

03:12.653 --> 03:19.740
then use the water for enrichment
of your food, of your household.

03:20.020 --> 03:23.389
In the same way,
if you cannot transform yourself,

03:23.389 --> 03:25.696
if you do not, cannot, change, yourself

03:25.816 --> 03:29.859
then this Kundalini will be just going
like a thin line

03:29.859 --> 03:35.006
and you will be catching all the time
and there won’t be much progress.

03:35.006 --> 03:38.008
The progress must be shown outside.

03:38.129 --> 03:42.537
Those who think that
by saying mantras morning till evening

03:42.537 --> 03:45.356
they are going to achieve much,
they are sadly mistaken;

03:45.356 --> 03:47.583
it’s all mechanical then.

03:47.703 --> 03:51.273
So many people have a habit
of all the time shouting mantras.

03:51.273 --> 03:57.115
It’s not habit! Mantras should open your chakras,
otherwise, it has no meaning.

03:57.115 --> 04:01.453
They should be used properly,
at key points,

04:01.574 --> 04:04.980
with great respect,
with a great understanding.

04:04.980 --> 04:11.734
And then allow them to open your chakras,
by which you take the water in,

04:11.734 --> 04:15.270
of that great thing known as Kundalini.

04:15.270 --> 04:19.404
The greatest blessing will come to you
through Her love.

04:19.404 --> 04:23.895
But not the way people are: just they think
there should be no transformation.

04:24.016 --> 04:25.803
If you are identified with your ego

04:25.923 --> 04:29.730
and think you are all right,
you are sadly mistaken.

04:29.730 --> 04:32.924
You have to transform completely
within yourself.

04:32.924 --> 04:35.895
Some people, if their circumstances
are changed,

04:35.895 --> 04:39.436
then they feel very well and they think
oh, they have achieved the highest.

04:39.436 --> 04:40.836
It is not so.

04:40.836 --> 04:43.310
It’s only the circumstance that has changed,

04:43.310 --> 04:45.234
only the atmosphere that has changed,

04:45.234 --> 04:49.898
and that makes you feel
that you have achieved something great.

04:50.096 --> 04:53.184
You have to achieve it
wherever you are,

04:53.304 --> 04:55.788
and it should be retained
and must be there.

04:55.909 --> 05:00.134
But by coming to a quieter place,
you can pay more attention,

05:00.134 --> 05:01.607
that’s why you are here.

05:01.607 --> 05:05.053
But by coming here,
if you just feel nice and think that

05:05.053 --> 05:08.668
oh, you have achieved everything,
then you are sadly mistaken.

05:08.668 --> 05:12.159
You have to grow in this atmosphere;
you have come here to grow

05:12.159 --> 05:15.389
and to be changed, to be
a different person altogether.
