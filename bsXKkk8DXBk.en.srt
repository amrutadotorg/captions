1
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:11,578
Today is a great day for all of us to be jubilant

2
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:19,329
that the Primordial Being Himself incarnated on this earth

3
00:05:19,329 --> 00:05:22,371
as Shri Krishna.

4
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:38,465
So many aspects of His being have been described

5
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:43,298
in so many of my lectures to you all;

6
00:05:43,298 --> 00:05:47,881
but the greatest and greatest of all the aspects

7
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:51,881
of this Primordial Being

8
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:55,756
was that He was the Yogeshwara.

9
00:05:55,797 --> 00:06:02,089
He was the God of Yoga - Yogeshwara.

10
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:15,256
He was the Lord of our Union with the Divine.

11
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:23,589
Without His permission and without His sanction we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

12
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:35,547
He was Yogeshwara and a real Yogi is a person

13
00:06:35,547 --> 00:06:45,423
who gets this Yogeshwara awakened within him.

14
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:50,381
The word "Yoga", that we understand,

15
00:06:50,381 --> 00:07:04,048
is the union of our attention with the Divine.

16
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:09,714
But still we do not realize the implications --

17
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:18,465
what does it mean? What should happen to us?

18
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:21,173
Of course you get powers.

19
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:24,797
As soon as you become the spirit you get powers.

20
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,506
One of the powers you get is of collective consciousness --

21
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:31,298
that is also the gift of Shri Krishna --

22
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,256
and that you start feeling the collectivity.

23
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:39,797
Your ego and superego is sucked in,

24
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:46,048
so you get rid of your karmas and your conditionings

25
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:51,256
and a new sprouting of the new life of the new age starts.

26
00:07:51,256 --> 00:08:01,340
But still what is the speciality, the greatness of Yogeshwara?

27
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:12,589
Because He is Ishwara for you. He is the Ishwara of all the Yogis

28
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:20,672
and what is His capacity, what is His nature?

29
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:27,589
That for Him everything is a play - Leela.

30
00:08:27,631 --> 00:08:30,964
For Shri Rama it was not a play.

31
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:44,465
For Him life was a platform on which he had to demonstrate

32
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:53,714
how to lead a very dharmic life as Maryada Purushottama.

33
00:08:53,756 --> 00:09:10,256
But Shri Krishna came up to show that He is the Leeladhara --

34
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:14,465
the one who plays the Leela, the play.

35
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:21,340
The whole thing is a play, the whole universe is a play.

36
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,797
All that is created by Adi Shakti, all these three gunas

37
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,465
is nothing but a play. And that is what He manifested

38
00:09:33,505 --> 00:09:39,505
in His own incarnation. But still what is Yogeshwara?

39
00:09:39,505 --> 00:09:45,756
Leeladhara is the one for whom this whole universe is a play,

40
00:09:45,797 --> 00:09:49,923
that He is at the axis, and for the whole periphery

41
00:09:49,964 --> 00:10:00,006
is nothing but a play. Because everything is false.

42
00:10:00,006 --> 00:10:06,423
Except for your spirit everything is false.

43
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:13,465
It's all a joke going on, you can say,

44
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:16,215
a drama going on, nothing so serious.

45
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:21,006
Spirit is the only truth within us the rest is all untruth.

46
00:10:21,048 --> 00:10:26,048
There cannot be many types of truths you see.

47
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,756
In Sanskrit language there is only truth or untruth,

48
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,215
satya or asatya, there are no ten words for truth.

49
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:36,714
So when this happens,

50
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:42,173
this great happening takes place within you,

51
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:46,173
when you become one with [the] Spirit you get powers

52
00:10:46,215 --> 00:10:53,215
without even your maturity reaching that stage,

53
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:57,756
your understanding reaching that stage

54
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:04,006
and your heart opening out.

55
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:12,756
so that you have faith with open understanding.

56
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:17,298
You should have faith with experience of it

57
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,173
so it starts off. When you start using your powers

58
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:25,465
you see it is manifesting, you are sometimes amazed,

59
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:27,465
how you raise Kundalini of people,

60
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:32,089
how you tie them up, how you give them realization,

61
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:34,048
how you cure people.

62
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:36,173
You are amazed, how it has happened.

63
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:40,298
So we can say it is all built within you

64
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,381
which has started manifesting.

65
00:11:42,423 --> 00:11:48,340
But there is so much more that has to still manifest,

66
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:54,131
which has to establish and make you grow.

67
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:59,131
One of the very important points is the Yogeshwara

68
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:04,672
and that point we must understand

69
00:12:04,714 --> 00:12:13,423
that unless and until you follow the path of Yogeshwara,

70
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:17,006
you cannot establish yourself fully.

71
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:20,173
So Krishna has said that:

72
00:12:20,215 --> 00:12:24,714
"Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja"

73
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:28,964
"You give up all your relationships...",

74
00:12:29,006 --> 00:12:34,381
dharma is relationship. Like your sister, your brother

75
00:12:34,423 --> 00:12:40,547
you see these are dharmas, like Sri dharma  a woman's job.

76
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:46,465
Then we can say also there is Rashta dharma.

77
00:12:46,505 --> 00:12:51,423
Today is the day of India's freedom.

78
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:56,547
So we have Rashta dharma, we are patriotic people.

79
00:12:56,547 --> 00:13:01,964
Patriotism to your own country is Rashta dharma.

80
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:06,714
Then you have got Samaj dharma

81
00:13:06,714 --> 00:13:13,505
that is duty towards your society, is Samaj dharma.

82
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:19,381
Then you have got Pati dharma, husbands' duties,

83
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:28,131
wives' duties. Everybody's duties are called as dharmas

84
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:31,048
because this is what you have to do,

85
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:34,964
you are duty bound - they form your dharmas.

86
00:13:35,006 --> 00:13:38,215
But He says, "Give up all these dharmas,

87
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:42,797
give up all the duties, just surrender yourself fully to Me"

88
00:13:42,797 --> 00:13:46,672
"Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja".

89
00:13:46,714 --> 00:13:51,381
Because you have become now the collective being,

90
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:54,340
now you have become one with Him,

91
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:56,714
now He looks after your dharmas,

92
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:58,714
He looks after your relationships,

93
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,048
He cleanses them, He purifies them,

94
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:04,298
so you just surrender yourself to Him fully.

95
00:14:04,298 --> 00:14:11,006
He said it to Shri Arjuna only not to everyone.

96
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:13,839
He didn't say to everyone they didn't deserve it,

97
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:16,547
or He didn't think it proper to say to them.

98
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:20,631
But I think you are proper people to know this

99
00:14:20,672 --> 00:14:25,298
so I'm telling you that: forget every other duty

100
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,131
to every other thing but do your duty

101
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:33,048
to your collective being, to your collectivity.

102
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:39,131
But He is Yogeshwara. That's the main point.

103
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:43,465
And to do duty to Him first and foremost thing

104
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:49,839
is you have to develop that purity of a Yogeshwara.

105
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:59,923
For Him sublimation was not needed  He was sublime.

106
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:02,215
He was the source of sublimation.

107
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:06,423
He did not need sublimation from the baser instincts

108
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:13,256
of human beings. He did not need anything to do,

109
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:17,547
to be done to Himself to raise Himself out of the maya

110
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:22,256
as they call it. Especially in the West, as you know,

111
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:28,631
we have created a hell for ourselves - real hell.

112
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:34,298
All kinds of perverted ideas are within us.

113
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,173
To a Yogeshwara this is nothing but maya,

114
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:44,714
absolutely filth. Never comes into His [mind]

115
00:15:44,756 --> 00:15:47,923
that such things are possible - they are shocking.

116
00:15:47,964 --> 00:15:52,881
On His birthday - I would say if today is His birthday

117
00:15:52,923 --> 00:15:57,256
and if He was born as He was at that time --

118
00:15:57,298 --> 00:16:01,465
He would have gone back immediately.

119
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:06,839
He would have said, "No sorry, I've nothing to do,

120
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,923
had enough." And that too,

121
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:10,964
if He had met the Western culture,

122
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:12,340
He would have been shocked back

123
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:14,923
he [would have] said, "Oh God, no, nothing doing.

124
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:17,381
I'm not coming here.

125
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:21,173
Despite the times when He was born,

126
00:16:21,215 --> 00:16:23,423
where there was dharma, there were people

127
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:25,340
[who] understood what was right, what was wrong.

128
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,964
When there was none of these nonsensical things

129
00:16:27,964 --> 00:16:32,964
were there - He came as Yogeshwara - pure.

130
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:41,964
The story of His is that once His wives wanted to go...

131
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:46,173
to Him what was wives? Nothing - is just a play.

132
00:16:46,173 --> 00:16:48,589
To Him no sin can be attached.

133
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:51,298
He married because He had to marry

134
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,423
His five principles or the five elements.

135
00:16:56,465 --> 00:16:59,089
So He made them into women and married them.

136
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,797
He had to marry 16,000 women

137
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:06,923
because He had to have 16,000 powers

138
00:17:06,923 --> 00:17:12,756
and He had to channelize them through some bodies,

139
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:14,881
so they came as women.

140
00:17:14,923 --> 00:17:19,423
To Him it was not a relationship of a wife

141
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:22,256
but a pure relationship.

142
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:26,589
To Him sex had no existence at all.

143
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:30,923
He was beyond it.

144
00:17:30,964 --> 00:17:32,714
So no question of temptations

145
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:35,131
and perversions - is out of [the] question.

146
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:41,048
The story is that once His five wives wanted to go

147
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:45,506
and pray to some saint who had come,

148
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:53,923
a great saint, to their town.

149
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:57,756
But he really stayed across the river.

150
00:17:57,797 --> 00:18:01,631
So they wanted to go and worship him

151
00:18:01,672 --> 00:18:05,465
and they found a very good time when they could go and see him.

152
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:10,756
So when they went near the river they said

153
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,631
"It is in spate we cannot cross it,

154
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:16,465
it's not the time that you can cross it."

155
00:18:16,505 --> 00:18:22,672
So they felt it was very inauspicious if they did not go

156
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:25,006
and that was such an auspicious time.

157
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:29,839
They wanted to go at that time and worship this guru.

158
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:32,881
So they went to Krishna and said that

159
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:35,714
"Now, how can we cross, the river is in spate?"

160
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:42,048
He said: "Really? Doesn't matter.

161
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:49,298
You go and tell the river.." - that is the river Yamuna river,

162
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:52,506
no I'm sorry  Tapi, Tapi river..

163
00:18:52,547 --> 00:19:03,672
He said "Go and tell the river that 'if we have a husband

164
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:11,340
who is Shri Krishna, is a Yogeshwara - that means

165
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,298
who has never indulged into any sex activity..."

166
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,131
Yogeshwara means a person who has never indulged

167
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:21,589
into any sex relationships.

168
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:26,547
That's not possible. One cannot think of such a thing.

169
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:29,756
Means though He indulged, He never indulged into [it].

170
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:37,756
Though He was in it still He was not there, like a lotus. "...

171
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:45,631
If He has not indulged into any such action..." --

172
00:19:45,672 --> 00:19:51,672
it's a... only possible for Him, nobody else.

173
00:19:51,714 --> 00:19:53,506
That's why He is an incarnation,

174
00:19:53,547 --> 00:19:55,256
He's not a human being.

175
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:56,923
Only incarnations can do it.

176
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:58,839
If some human being starts saying that

177
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:02,256
"I am Shri Krishna, so I am doing this and I am doing that",

178
00:20:02,298 --> 00:20:04,256
like you see, there are very bombastic ones,

179
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:05,797
you must have heard about them.

180
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,923
They do not become, is only an incarnation can do it.

181
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:19,506
That means Yogeshwara is the one who had incarnated.

182
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:24,089
So they went and told the river that,

183
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:28,256
"If He is the Yogeshwara, then please you subside."

184
00:20:28,298 --> 00:20:35,672
And she went down. So they went to the other side,

185
00:20:35,672 --> 00:20:37,964
did the puja to the guru and they came back.

186
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:41,089
Again the river was in spate and they could not cross.

187
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:46,048
So they went to the guru.

188
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:52,505
This is the sign of a good guru or a real guru,

189
00:20:52,505 --> 00:20:58,048
is an incarnated guru. And they said that

190
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:01,756
"See, we cannot cross, the river is in spate."

191
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:05,797
So they said: "Really, how did you come?"

192
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,756
They said, "Shri Krishna asked us,

193
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:15,506
that 'if I am the Yogeshwara, it will go down, you ask the question'."

194
00:21:15,547 --> 00:21:20,340
So he said: "All right, now you go and ask the question,

195
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:37,839
that if I am the bhukta. Bhukta, that means

196
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:41,714
if I have eaten all the food you have given me,

197
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:45,547
but I have not enjoyed it, I've not indulged into it,

198
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:50,672
then let the river subside."

199
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:52,672
They went and told the river,

200
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:54,423
I mean they could not believe it

201
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:56,923
because they had fed him, that:

202
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:58,756
"Whatever food we offered him,

203
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:05,672
if he has not eaten any food, then you subside".

204
00:22:05,714 --> 00:22:07,506
And the river subsided!

205
00:22:07,547 --> 00:22:18,881
So the moral of the whole thing is that your ideal,

206
00:22:18,923 --> 00:22:28,340
your ideal again, in this respect, is Shri Krishna.

207
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:37,797
Not that you think you are the ideal of the rest.

208
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:41,839
This is the big mistake Sahaja Yogis do.

209
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,964
They think immediately they have become now

210
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:50,131
Shri Krishna or they have become something greater

211
00:22:50,173 --> 00:23:00,048
or that there is an ideal that they have imbibed within themselves

212
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:05,173
It's not so - that one thing one has to know,

213
00:23:05,215 --> 00:23:13,006
that that is the ideal you have to reachand your eyes

214
00:23:13,048 --> 00:23:15,881
should be towards that ideal and the movement

215
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:18,547
should be towards that. Before that,

216
00:23:18,589 --> 00:23:23,381
if you fall into any such thing like perversions

217
00:23:23,423 --> 00:23:26,256
and nonsensical sexual things and all that,

218
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:28,923
you must know that you are falling down very badly.

219
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:32,672
It's a possession that is working on you.

220
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:37,048
That's an ideal - they are incarnations.

221
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:41,173
You are not incarnations nor can you become incarnations.

222
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:45,964
But they are the light, which are enlightening your path,

223
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:50,506
on which you are walking. They are taking you to the realm

224
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:53,672
where they are the Kings and they are the Lords.

225
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:56,256
He is Ishwara - He is your Ishwara.

226
00:23:56,298 --> 00:24:01,964
You are not Ishwaras. But you are at least the Yogis.

227
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:08,381
We have to be the yogis first, then He is our Ishwara, nah?

228
00:24:08,423 --> 00:24:10,465
Otherwise He doesn't want to rule you.

229
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:16,048
So what we have to do, is to become the Yogis first.

230
00:24:16,048 --> 00:24:21,173
And one of the signs of a yogi is

231
00:24:21,215 --> 00:24:28,505
that he is in his sex life extremely pure.

232
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:40,547
Absolutely purity must exist

233
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:44,589
and after some time one should get beyond.

234
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:53,173
Your relationships with other people,

235
00:24:53,215 --> 00:24:57,964
whether it is your sister or a brother

236
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:00,756
or any other woman or any other man,

237
00:25:00,797 --> 00:25:05,631
there should be complete purity.

238
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:11,923
And this is extremely important.

239
00:25:11,923 --> 00:25:18,923
Now in the countries like India, people are extremely corrupt,

240
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:24,048
very corrupt, extremely corrupt. You can give them 5 rupees

241
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:26,589
and you can buy anybody there.

242
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:29,714
It's very corrupt, moneywise.

243
00:25:29,756 --> 00:25:34,964
But people are not so immoral, they know it is immorality,

244
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:37,256
I mean they know. I mean if they do immoral thing

245
00:25:37,298 --> 00:25:39,923
they know it is not moral.

246
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:44,505
In the West the immorality has become a general rule.

247
00:25:44,506 --> 00:25:47,631
For them the 'morality' word should vanish now.

248
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:49,923
I mean it doesn't exist like morality.

249
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,506
Do anything whatever you like,

250
00:25:51,547 --> 00:25:54,006
people don't think of immorality.

251
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:58,173
They don't want to talk of it, "it is Victorian."

252
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:01,589
And if somebody says that one should be moral,

253
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:03,839
they start thinking he's an hypocrite.

254
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,173
I mean they cannot think there can be any connection

255
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:09,631
between human being and morality in a genuine way.

256
00:26:09,672 --> 00:26:14,506
This is a big problem we have. It's the biggest problem we have.

257
00:26:14,547 --> 00:26:20,089
Now corruption is something you can avoid

258
00:26:20,131 --> 00:26:25,298
because if you are not corrupt, it is alright, you can be.

259
00:26:25,298 --> 00:26:28,589
But immorality is such a thing that,

260
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:35,547
if you live in an immoral world, it has effect on everyone.

261
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:38,465
For example, a moral woman is walking on the road

262
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:41,256
and there is a man full of lust and all that looking at her.

263
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:45,797
In any way she looses her chastity.

264
00:26:45,797 --> 00:26:48,465
She doesn't mean to attract him or anything,

265
00:26:48,505 --> 00:26:50,256
she doesn't want to loose her chastity,

266
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:53,465
but the way he is looking at her, you see,

267
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:58,589
though her simple methods are there, she may be responsible

268
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:02,089
in a distant way to ruin his chastity,

269
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:07,006
his morality. Even a little child, who is a simple,

270
00:27:07,048 --> 00:27:10,215
innocent child but if there''s a dirty man with a dirty eyes,

271
00:27:10,215 --> 00:27:13,839
he can have very dirty feelings for the child.

272
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:18,714
So, though of course that person himself is dirty and all that,

273
00:27:18,756 --> 00:27:20,756
we cannot say the child is not affected.

274
00:27:20,797 --> 00:27:23,465
But in a way, that becomes an object,

275
00:27:23,465 --> 00:27:26,006
a sort of a Vastu as you call it.

276
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:30,839
A thing which makes another person

277
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,923
even lower than what he is.

278
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:38,173
Even an ordinary picture, which has nothing to do,

279
00:27:38,215 --> 00:27:40,964
is placed there, any funny thing

280
00:27:41,006 --> 00:27:46,131
which is giving some dirty feelings.

281
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:51,256
Because these days I have seen so many symbols

282
00:27:51,298 --> 00:27:55,131
have started, which to my eye I don't even see

283
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,048
there is anything wrong in it.

284
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:00,340
That to my eye I can't see because I'm too innocent.

285
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,256
My eyes can't see [that] there''s anything wrong.

286
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:06,006
But to somebody, who is an expert on these things,

287
00:28:06,006 --> 00:28:08,631
[he] will immediately say, "oh look at this."

288
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:13,714
I mean really it is impossible to understand

289
00:28:13,756 --> 00:28:17,423
how the human mind has really woven their yarns

290
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:19,797
all around and made these patterns

291
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:22,298
to ruin themselves and ruin others.

292
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:33,256
So to worship Yogeshwara we must know

293
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:40,340
that our relationships with everyone in this world

294
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:42,505
has to be pure.

295
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:49,215
He played lots of things in His lifetime.

296
00:28:49,256 --> 00:28:52,131
The time when He came,

297
00:28:52,173 --> 00:28:58,381
the whole country was absolutely drowned

298
00:28:58,423 --> 00:29:02,048
into fanatic ideas about religion.

299
00:29:02,089 --> 00:29:07,672
If Freud was there he would have said,

300
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:11,465
"oh this is all nonsense" you see, "What's wrong? Go ahead."

301
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:16,381
Krishna did not do that.

302
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:23,089
He wanted to break all the nonsensical shackles

303
00:29:23,131 --> 00:29:30,131
of traditions and shackles of false fanaticism.

304
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:35,173
But He did it in a very beautiful manner

305
00:29:35,215 --> 00:29:39,173
keeping the relationship absolutely pure.

306
00:29:39,173 --> 00:29:44,465
Now people ask questions,

307
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:46,964
"Mother, was He married to Radha?"

308
00:29:47,006 --> 00:29:49,881
You know He's eternally married to Her, doesn't matter.

309
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:53,714
But He actually performed the marriage

310
00:29:53,714 --> 00:29:59,881
just the day He was born. He was brought by His father

311
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:04,964
across the river and put down on the bank of the river,

312
00:30:05,006 --> 00:30:09,465
when Shri Brahmadeva himself came on this earth.

313
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:13,465
That's why He wears a yellow thing, always,

314
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:18,465
as a blessing from Brahmadeva to cover His lower part,

315
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:23,839
lower than the waist with a cloth. That's the sign.

316
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,631
That's why He always wears yellow.

317
00:30:26,672 --> 00:30:34,881
He himself came, made Him into man and married Him to Radhaji.

318
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:43,298
Then again He became a child just to appear to be a child.

319
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:45,589
Somebody may appear to be a child.

320
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:48,215
To some of you I appear to you to be a sixteen-year-old girl

321
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:50,506
as you say, but I'm not.

322
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:54,923
While I may be, according to counting,

323
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:58,298
might be sixty years of age, but I'm not.

324
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:04,839
My age is eternal. I can't say what age is Mine.

325
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:11,547
It could be two years old or it could be absolutelyancient.

326
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:13,672
It could be anything.

327
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:22,048
So in His whole life, whatever He did,

328
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:25,465
He did with the purity of understanding.

329
00:31:25,505 --> 00:31:28,215
So Radhaji was married to Him first.

330
00:31:28,215 --> 00:31:35,423
And afterwards when He came as a child,

331
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:40,506
when He was a child, He did all kinds of pranks and things.

332
00:31:40,547 --> 00:31:43,215
It was nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

333
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:46,714
It was not sitting like this and seriously telling about things.

334
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:49,215
But with little bit here and there

335
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:56,756
He tried to improve their chakras and raise their Kundalinis.

336
00:31:56,756 --> 00:32:00,465
Of course realization was not possible in a game.

337
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:04,089
You cannot do it. Supposing I just play about with you

338
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,964
you cannot get your realization

339
00:32:07,006 --> 00:32:10,465
because at the Sahastrara stage

340
00:32:10,465 --> 00:32:13,006
you have to completely recognize.

341
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:24,506
It has to be a game of serenity.

342
00:32:24,547 --> 00:32:29,714
Of course, you can just raise your hand

343
00:32:29,756 --> 00:32:32,256
and give realization to people.

344
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:35,048
But you have to bring them to serene level.

345
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:39,672
If you just came andsaid, "alright, you now play about",

346
00:32:39,714 --> 00:32:42,006
it would be all finished.

347
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:44,048
You have to sit down and meditate.

348
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:47,589
Though He has said it in Geeta you have to do it.

349
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:52,173
So one could not say that all the time if you are playing,

350
00:32:52,173 --> 00:32:54,256
if you are just singing songs,

351
00:32:54,256 --> 00:33:00,131
or if you are in a very happy mood, a mirthful mood,

352
00:33:00,173 --> 00:33:03,173
then it's the end of Sahaja Yoga. It is not.

353
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:06,173
It's a serious matter.

354
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:10,423
So He did not give them realization

355
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:13,423
but He reduced the tension on their minds

356
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:19,964
of the so-called dharma and its shackles of fanaticism

357
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:24,756
and He made it loose and then He wanted them

358
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:29,131
to understand that dharma is not

359
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,631
going to enslave you.

360
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,631
You have to rise above the dharma --

361
00:33:34,672 --> 00:33:39,048
become dharma itself.

362
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:52,006
But Yogeshwara is to be worshipped with pure heart.

363
00:33:52,048 --> 00:34:00,672
In this atmosphere it''s difficult, I know.

364
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:05,131
You just go out and you see a horrid thing there.

365
00:34:05,131 --> 00:34:07,714
You open any page of the magazine,

366
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:11,589
there''s another horrid thing. Anywhere you advertise Me

367
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:15,714
the next page I turn I find a discotheque nonsense

368
00:34:15,756 --> 00:34:17,923
going on there. I mean what can you do,

369
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:22,256
you just can't help it. And all this is on, I mean,

370
00:34:22,298 --> 00:34:27,547
if you look at it - how gross, dirty, filthy the whole thing is.

371
00:34:27,547 --> 00:34:32,839
To add to problems, psychologists have come forward.

372
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:37,256
They themselves are affected by their methods

373
00:34:37,256 --> 00:34:39,298
and everything, they are so possessed

374
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:46,756
and their sense about morality is absolutely in complete confusion.

375
00:34:46,797 --> 00:34:48,215
No doubt about it.

376
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:50,340
You know Freud, what happened to him?

377
00:34:50,381 --> 00:34:52,672
He was having relations with his mother.

378
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:54,839
He couldn't even understand, I mean imagine

379
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:57,964
what a adharmi he must be, horrible wretched fellow,

380
00:34:58,006 --> 00:35:01,881
he did not even have that purity to understand

381
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:04,340
relationship with a mother. I mean, imagine.

382
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:08,173
It is such a clear-cut background of this man.

383
00:35:08,215 --> 00:35:11,048
Shows how wrong he must have been.

384
00:35:11,048 --> 00:35:16,256
Because what was in him, such filth, such dirt,

385
00:35:16,298 --> 00:35:21,923
that he could not even look at his mother with clear heart.

386
00:35:21,964 --> 00:35:25,964
Must be all mud in his eyes or I don't know what he be like,

387
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:28,381
to see things like that.

388
00:35:28,423 --> 00:35:36,215
You are shaking with my vibrations already.

389
00:35:36,256 --> 00:35:42,672
Now when we think of Him as Yogeshwara

390
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:46,672
that means we are Yogis and He is our Ishwara.

391
00:35:46,714 --> 00:35:55,797
Ishwara is to be praised - Dhayaati??

392
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:03,589
you have to praise Him. You have to praise Him

393
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:09,547
for his quality as Yogeshwara because He is your Ishwara

394
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:11,505
so you have to praise Him.

395
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:14,465
Now what praise can we give Him.

396
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:20,465
Today He's born. What should we do

397
00:36:20,505 --> 00:36:23,839
on such a great occasion when He is born?

398
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:32,173
We have to decide that He is our Ishwara.

399
00:36:32,215 --> 00:36:40,173
He is the Ishwara aspect and if He is our Ishwara

400
00:36:40,173 --> 00:36:48,256
then we have to cleanse our attitude towards sex,

401
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:57,381
towards the gross way of life that we have developed,

402
00:36:57,423 --> 00:37:03,131
to just shun it and throw it away. Absolutely.

403
00:37:03,173 --> 00:37:06,173
There cannot be compromise on that

404
00:37:06,173 --> 00:37:15,256
otherwise you cannot be a yogi, you cannot be a yogi.

405
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:19,423
You may become very powerful, maybe for the time being.

406
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:21,714
Because I play with you, you get ideas

407
00:37:21,714 --> 00:37:25,923
that you are very powerful and all that. But that's not true.

408
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:32,256
As My name is Nirmala, as My name is purity --

409
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:35,215
you have to be pure yogis.

410
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:41,215
Nobody says you should not marry.

411
00:37:41,215 --> 00:37:44,506
Nobody says you should not have proper sex relationships

412
00:37:44,547 --> 00:37:47,505
with you wives, that's not done.

413
00:37:47,506 --> 00:37:53,048
But that's one thing people may avoid and spoil it.

414
00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:58,797
But the other thing, which is the most important, is your attention

415
00:37:58,797 --> 00:38:06,672
to be pure of sex attractions [of] any kind.

416
00:38:06,672 --> 00:38:11,340
Your attention should never go to anything like that.

417
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:24,881
You see to Me, I mean I'm now supposed to be an old lady, I don't see things

418
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:29,048
which normally people see. This is something surprising.

419
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:32,298
You see, I see something and I don't know what's happening

420
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,797
and everybody laughs at me in the house you see.

421
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:37,589
They don't understand that - how I didn't see the point.

422
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:39,797
But I don't understand these jokes

423
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,923
because the attention never goes into these dirty things,

424
00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:46,089
never goes into these things. I can't see,

425
00:38:46,131 --> 00:38:48,547
till somebody tells me that 'this is this.'

426
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:50,923
But they have to explain ten times.

427
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:57,131
So all these sophisticated methods of nonsense

428
00:38:57,131 --> 00:39:02,547
and the filth and the dirt that we have accumulated here,

429
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:05,631
please wash off your hands of that.

430
00:39:05,672 --> 00:39:09,589
That's one thing, will not be tolerated in Sahaja Yoga.

431
00:39:09,631 --> 00:39:12,215
Every Sahaja Yogi I must tell.

432
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:18,215
Itself, sex cannot be enjoyed, if you live like this.

433
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,923
You cannot! You don't enjoy sex at all in this country.

434
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:24,298
None of them.

435
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,756
Only in a country, where people are innocent,

436
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:29,131
you can enjoy. If you were enjoying,

437
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:31,173
you would not run from one woman to another woman,

438
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,839
you would not run from man to woman and man to man

439
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:37,089
and then to all donkeys all those things.

440
00:39:37,131 --> 00:39:44,923
It is impossible that you could be a yogi

441
00:39:44,923 --> 00:39:47,881
with all these dirty ideas.

442
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:54,547
And then you cannot mature,

443
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:56,547
even a normal person won't mature.

444
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:58,672
In India a person who is about 40 years,

445
00:39:58,672 --> 00:40:00,839
he becomes a matured father.

446
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:03,173
You leave any girls with him, anybody with him,

447
00:40:03,173 --> 00:40:05,089
it will not even get into his head

448
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:08,256
that there's something could exist between them.

449
00:40:08,298 --> 00:40:10,215
Once you are married it should not.

450
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:12,048
I mean I have seen my two son-inlaws,

451
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:14,256
they never get these ideas into their heads.

452
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:25,589
So try to put your attention onto proper track

453
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,797
because your Ishwara is Yogeshwara.

454
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:31,672
Now the other side of Shri Krishna

455
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:33,881
people do not know.

456
00:40:33,923 --> 00:40:38,298
It's a play, all right. But He is Samhara-shakti.

457
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:46,089
He is the power of destruction. It's very good,

458
00:40:46,089 --> 00:40:50,089
He's there, comes with everything to protect us.

459
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:55,256
But He also has got Sudarshan chakra. Sudarshan,

460
00:40:55,298 --> 00:41:00,340
'su' means auspicious, "darshan" is vision.

461
00:41:00,381 --> 00:41:04,340
He gives us auspicious visions, you see.

462
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:09,340
If you try tricks with Him, that goes round your neck

463
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:15,048
and then you have auspicious darshans of yourself,

464
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:17,881
that you are hanging in the air somewhere.

465
00:41:17,923 --> 00:41:24,298
So Shri Krishna's methods; on one side

466
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:30,797
He is a "Leelamayi", He is compassionate,

467
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:36,881
He stands by His bhaktas, He comes on this earth

468
00:41:36,923 --> 00:41:42,505
to revive the dharma. If the dharma goes down,

469
00:41:42,505 --> 00:41:47,298
He comes to uplift it. "Yada yada hi dharmasya" --

470
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:50,423
"whenever there is the decline of dharma."

471
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:53,215
But dharma doesn't mean only corruption,

472
00:41:53,215 --> 00:41:56,048
it doesn't mean only honesty and dishonesty.

473
00:41:56,089 --> 00:42:01,839
Basically it means Mooladhara.

474
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:07,215
That is the beginning of the end.

475
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:11,714
And He comes to - "sa sansthapana arthaya" --

476
00:42:11,714 --> 00:42:16,964
again to establish into the holy state.

477
00:42:17,006 --> 00:42:22,506
He comes on this earth to raise human beings to that level.

478
00:42:22,547 --> 00:42:37,672
This is what He does. So if we are Sahaja Yogis,

479
00:42:37,714 --> 00:42:41,881
we are part and parcel of His Being.

480
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:49,006
We are instruments into His working.

481
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:52,589
So we have to establish dharma, but the one,

482
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:54,923
who has no dharma within himself,

483
00:42:54,964 --> 00:42:58,256
what dharma is he going to establish anywhere?

484
00:42:58,298 --> 00:43:04,131
You have come on this earth to establish the dharma

485
00:43:04,173 --> 00:43:09,298
in its holy aspect. Not like Roman Catholic church

486
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:12,505
or another Pentecostal church

487
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:17,797
or these Hindu religious activities

488
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:19,839
or these Hindu temples

489
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,505
or the Islamic state.

490
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:27,215
But dharma in its pure state you have to establish.

491
00:43:27,256 --> 00:43:29,006
But if there is no dharma within us,

492
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:33,131
how are we going to establish?

493
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:35,797
So He comes on this earth every time

494
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,006
to establish dharma at Vishnu level.

495
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:42,340
But at Shri Krishna level, He comes at Yogeshwara.

496
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:47,797
This is the point many people have not even thought out.

497
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,547
For Vishnu they may not say Yogeshwara.

498
00:43:50,589 --> 00:43:56,340
That is He is the Ishwara of Yogis,

499
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:10,589
as Ganesha is the Ishwara of the Ganas.

500
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:17,714
You see, it's the Ganapati [who] looks after the Ganas,

501
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:23,089
and He is our Ishwara.

502
00:44:23,131 --> 00:44:27,547
That is we have to have Him as our ideal.

503
00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:33,256
With the understanding that today is the day --

504
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:35,923
in the night about 12 o'clock,

505
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,672
now must be about 12 o'clock in India also, about that,

506
00:44:39,672 --> 00:44:51,547
so it matches - He was born at this time in the night,

507
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:55,881
because it was real night symbolically,

508
00:44:55,923 --> 00:45:01,006
under horrible circumstances.

509
00:45:01,048 --> 00:45:07,881
He came, at a time,

510
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:15,714
when His own birth was very dangerously placed.

511
00:45:15,756 --> 00:45:22,006
He was saved, and then, in His very childhood

512
00:45:22,048 --> 00:45:33,465
He killed Rakshasas. But all this He did

513
00:45:33,505 --> 00:45:35,048
because He was an incarnation.

514
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:38,505
Nobody is asking you to go and kill Rakshasas. Is it?

515
00:45:38,506 --> 00:45:42,589
In Sahaja Yoga did I ask you to go and kill some Rakshasas?

516
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:46,131
On the contrary I'm just saying -keep yourself protected.

517
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:54,048
There was a Rakshasin who came, her name was Putana

518
00:45:54,048 --> 00:46:01,173
and she wanted to put poison through her breast

519
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:05,381
and she took the child and started nursing.

520
00:46:05,423 --> 00:46:09,672
He was a little baby. And when He started sucking her breast,

521
00:46:09,714 --> 00:46:18,256
she came out in her true form and she died.

522
00:46:18,298 --> 00:46:24,089
Because He was, after all, He was an incarnation.

523
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:26,298
Can anyone of us do that?

524
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:30,131
I mean the Sahaja Yogis?

525
00:46:30,173 --> 00:46:37,381
Then as a child He was very mischievous.

526
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:47,173
He ate some clay, I think.

527
00:46:47,215 --> 00:46:50,256
Whether He ate it or not, His mother doubted.

528
00:46:50,298 --> 00:46:52,173
She got very angry and she said:

529
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:55,089
"Open your mouth, I would like to see, did you eat that?"

530
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:57,923
When He opened the mouth - she saw a complete universe

531
00:46:57,964 --> 00:47:04,714
moving in His throat - because Vishuddhi chakra She saw.

532
00:47:04,756 --> 00:47:08,340
Because she could see. She had power to see, she could see.

533
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,006
Not...everybody can't see that.

534
00:47:12,048 --> 00:47:16,256
Those who have powers can see.

535
00:47:16,298 --> 00:47:21,465
We don't even have the powers as much as she had

536
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:24,714
to see the universe.

537
00:47:24,714 --> 00:47:32,465
So one has to understand that first, as Sahaja Yogis,

538
00:47:32,465 --> 00:47:37,506
we get the powers much before we have passed,

539
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:44,173
really, the test of Sahaja Yogis.

540
00:47:44,215 --> 00:47:46,215
Just the other way round it is.

541
00:47:46,215 --> 00:47:50,506
In the university they will first give you the degree,

542
00:47:50,506 --> 00:47:54,964
the certificate and then you will get a job,

543
00:47:55,006 --> 00:48:00,964
may not get job also, these days!

544
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:07,423
Here you get the job first of all, you get all the powers

545
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:12,215
you are paid for, but the degree is still not sure.

546
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:15,964
Anybody walks about as Sahaja Yogi,

547
00:48:16,006 --> 00:48:19,964
next day I find him coming out with something else.

548
00:48:20,006 --> 00:48:26,089
They are certified Sahaja Yogis, I have seen.

549
00:48:26,131 --> 00:48:33,589
They become afterwards certified something else.

550
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:37,714
God knows how. So this is the thing of Sahaja Yoga

551
00:48:37,756 --> 00:48:40,423
that you can become a Sahaja Yogi

552
00:48:40,423 --> 00:48:44,423
even without having the real certificate.

553
00:48:44,423 --> 00:48:50,089
It's definitely so. And the certificate is given,

554
00:48:50,131 --> 00:48:52,714
as you know, by Lord Jesus Christ.

555
00:48:52,714 --> 00:48:57,714
He doesn't give certificate easily.

556
00:48:57,714 --> 00:49:03,006
That way He is very, very strict.

557
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:08,589
He is not going to give you. He''s extremely strict

558
00:49:08,631 --> 00:49:11,881
as far as the Sahaja Yogis are concerned,

559
00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:13,881
He''s not going to give you certificates,

560
00:49:13,881 --> 00:49:19,256
He's going to judge you. And what is His basic nature, is He's innocence.

561
00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:23,631
He is going to judge you on your innocence.

562
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:27,714
If you are a superego you can say,

563
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:30,506
Oh I got possessed by a bhoot, you see,

564
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:32,506
and the bhoot did this. So He will say:

565
00:49:32,547 --> 00:49:36,547
"Alright you go to the bhoot for the certificate not to me."

566
00:49:36,547 --> 00:49:40,714
Even when Yogis fight, I've seen, they tell me,

567
00:49:40,756 --> 00:49:43,839
"Mother, must be my bhoot and his bhoot must have fought".

568
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:46,006
And what were you doing?

569
00:49:46,006 --> 00:49:54,506
They were witnessing it like Shri Krishnas!

570
00:49:54,547 --> 00:49:59,298
With all these things happening,

571
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:10,631
I get a big promise sometimes, that, "Mother, alright,

572
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:13,465
now we are not going to quarrel,

573
00:50:13,465 --> 00:50:18,298
there's not going to be any problem, you rest assured,

574
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:24,839
we'll all live in harmony." Then suddenly I find

575
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:27,381
that somebody is fighting for a bathroom

576
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:30,672
or for a soap or something like that.

577
00:50:30,714 --> 00:50:34,631
That's not for a Sahaja Yogi to behave.

578
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:40,465
First of all you have to be a satisfied person,

579
00:50:40,465 --> 00:50:45,797
a person of great dignity and forbearance,

580
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:49,423
otherwise what are you going to bear?

581
00:50:49,423 --> 00:51:01,672
"I love him very much, but he should not have taken my towel."

582
00:51:01,714 --> 00:51:07,797
For small, small things if you go on insisting,

583
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:15,256
be sure you are not a yogi as yet.

584
00:51:15,256 --> 00:51:18,298
If you are fighting for things,

585
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,089
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

586
00:51:21,131 --> 00:51:22,547
What do these things matter?

587
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:25,131
I never say anything about anything, do I?

588
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:27,256
That "I must have this, I must have that,

589
00:51:27,256 --> 00:51:28,881
how did you prepare this?"

590
00:51:28,923 --> 00:51:31,631
Though it is sometimes really wrong and unprotocolish.

591
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:34,381
I never say that, "Why did you bring these bananas,

592
00:51:34,423 --> 00:51:37,964
they are no good, I'm not going to eat!" Did I say so?

593
00:51:38,006 --> 00:51:42,839
I mean, even the flowers you use may not be auspicious.

594
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:45,714
I know certain flowers should not be used for puja.

595
00:51:45,756 --> 00:51:48,714
But I have not opened my mouth. If I have to tell you,

596
00:51:48,756 --> 00:51:51,797
I just tell you because you have to know it

597
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:56,131
for your own good, not for my good.

598
00:51:56,173 --> 00:52:04,215
So, on a day like this, which is a day of great joy

599
00:52:04,256 --> 00:52:06,923
to all the world, and happiness,

600
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:11,298
you should know one thing, that, when Christ was born,

601
00:52:11,298 --> 00:52:14,714
he was born in a very humble place,

602
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,964
but when Krishna was born,

603
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:25,423
He was born in the most horrifying circumstances.

604
00:52:25,465 --> 00:52:31,881
Same is the case of Sahaja Yogis today.

605
00:52:31,923 --> 00:52:34,547
It's a thing of great joy and jubilation, no doubt,

606
00:52:34,547 --> 00:52:37,547
that He came and he gave us His Vishuddi power,

607
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:40,465
but we must understand that we are born

608
00:52:40,465 --> 00:52:43,048
in a very precarious time.

609
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:46,131
I've been saying this so many times.

610
00:52:46,173 --> 00:52:50,048
There''s not only one Kamsa there. So many are there.

611
00:52:50,048 --> 00:52:52,672
There''s a big fight going on,

612
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:55,923
in that you people are here in charge.

613
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:59,881
You are the ones employed by God, you are the ones,

614
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:08,089
who have been given this great work. You have powers.

615
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:10,506
Like Shri Krishna, when He was crossing,

616
00:53:10,506 --> 00:53:13,964
as a child was put in a basket

617
00:53:14,006 --> 00:53:16,756
and the father was carrying the child in the basket

618
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:20,173
and when His feet touched the river Yamuna,

619
00:53:20,173 --> 00:53:22,423
the river went down.

620
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,964
Because she was in spate, she went down.

621
00:53:25,006 --> 00:53:28,672
In the same way, you too have all these powers.

622
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,465
Krishna has given you all the powers.

623
00:53:31,505 --> 00:53:35,881
Though they will be really known to you,

624
00:53:35,923 --> 00:53:42,465
when only Lord Jesus Christ accepts you as Sahaja Yogis.

625
00:53:42,505 --> 00:53:48,505
That's important because you have to be innocent.

626
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:52,381
Purity must be brought in.

627
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:57,672
Last time on this great day we had 16 marriages.

628
00:53:57,672 --> 00:54:00,714
They came out well most of them.

629
00:54:00,714 --> 00:54:05,173
Not all, but most of them were very good

630
00:54:05,173 --> 00:54:07,089
and I am really very happy

631
00:54:07,131 --> 00:54:10,589
that such good couples came on that day.

632
00:54:10,589 --> 00:54:12,173
It was very auspicious.

633
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:21,756
And marriage gives you a sense of purity

634
00:54:21,797 --> 00:54:29,631
and that's why our marriage is important in Sahaja Yoga.

635
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:33,797
But that's not the last word, like this is not

636
00:54:33,797 --> 00:54:35,631
a hunting ground for everyone,

637
00:54:35,631 --> 00:54:38,714
"I'm finding out this husband or I'm finding out that husband."

638
00:54:38,756 --> 00:54:42,381
That must be stopped completely. Leave it to Sahaja.

639
00:54:42,381 --> 00:54:46,340
You are not to search out your wives in Sahaja Yogis,

640
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:49,506
no, not at all, nor husbands! Leave it!

641
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:57,589
If you have done something like that, then you may be harmed.

642
00:54:57,589 --> 00:55:00,923
Don't do any searching or any thing.

643
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,839
A time will come, when you will find,

644
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,006
I will myself tell you "alright, marry this person."

645
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:10,881
It's still on among Sahaja Yogis, I have known people

646
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:14,881
who just take out people and try courting.

647
00:55:14,923 --> 00:55:17,923
That's not needed in Sahaja Yoga, no courting needed.

648
00:55:17,923 --> 00:55:19,631
See, we have got so many cases,

649
00:55:19,672 --> 00:55:21,423
where the marriage was decided like that,

650
00:55:21,423 --> 00:55:23,298
they married, they are very happily married,

651
00:55:23,298 --> 00:55:26,089
than people who had courting, this thing, selections,

652
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:29,881
and nominations and elections and everything.

653
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:35,423
And after that you find within 2 days they are out for divorce.

654
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,714
In Sahaja Yoga it is spontaneous,instantaneous.

655
00:55:39,756 --> 00:55:43,340
You don't have to do all these things

656
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,048
with all these deliberations what have you achieved?

657
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:50,547
It's just spontaneous. So you don't have to worry

658
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,505
and you don't have to think. You don't have to say,

659
00:55:53,506 --> 00:55:56,048
that "Oh Mother, I have to find a girl for me"

660
00:55:56,089 --> 00:56:00,631
You see, you don't! Leave it me, it's my headache.

661
00:56:00,672 --> 00:56:04,340
But once you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

662
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:06,672
you must know what it means.

663
00:56:06,714 --> 00:56:09,340
And both of you must work it out properly

664
00:56:09,381 --> 00:56:11,797
and it is for the good of everyone.

665
00:56:11,797 --> 00:56:21,006
Should be good for everyone.

666
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:33,423
So, this is what it is. And I would say that, on this day,

667
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:37,423
let us take one vow:

668
00:57:00,672 --> 00:57:06,298
To decide that we will be worshippingYogeshwara.

669
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,173
We have to worship Him.

670
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:14,964
Means our relationships about these things has to be clean.

671
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:19,089
We should not get involved into it, it''s nothing important.

672
00:57:19,131 --> 00:57:23,631
It's just like having your food,

673
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:32,089
you have to be with your wife. Is the need of the body.

674
00:57:32,131 --> 00:57:45,006
You don't eat from the dirty plates, do you?

675
00:57:45,006 --> 00:57:48,215
You want to have a clean plate.

676
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:51,672
You want to have a plate, which you have used yourself,

677
00:57:51,672 --> 00:57:56,505
your own plate that should be clean.

678
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:59,381
If you could have a cleaner plate, you would like to have,

679
00:57:59,423 --> 00:58:01,465
if you can get a silver plate, you would like.

680
00:58:01,505 --> 00:58:05,089
If it is even a golden plate is even better.

681
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:09,131
In the same way, we should also have

682
00:58:09,173 --> 00:58:15,506
a very pure understanding that, it is the need of the body,

683
00:58:15,506 --> 00:58:19,381
the body which can be very subtle.

684
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:26,505
So let us not just go on shopping for it everywhere,

685
00:58:26,506 --> 00:58:28,756
looking out, "oh this is that, this one that one,"

686
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:37,423
then discard this one. It has to come to you specially.

687
00:58:37,465 --> 00:58:43,215
And all great things happen suddenly. Always.

688
00:58:43,256 --> 00:58:51,423
The more deliberations you will have, the worse it will be.

689
00:58:51,465 --> 00:58:58,881
So don't form ideas, don't plan about it.

690
00:58:58,923 --> 00:59:02,340
It will happen. It''s not so important.

691
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:09,589
That will give you a lot of purity. Your ego will be perfect.

692
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:16,797
I know of someone, whom nobody wanted to marry.

693
00:59:16,797 --> 00:59:21,506
And when I suggested someone,

694
00:59:21,547 --> 00:59:24,381
who agreed with great difficulty, she said,

695
00:59:24,381 --> 00:59:34,547
"I don't want to marry." It's funny. It is very funny that,

696
00:59:34,589 --> 00:59:37,089
the way our ego is working out. Because, you see,

697
00:59:37,089 --> 00:59:40,797
when we are looking at another person for marriage or anything,

698
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:43,423
we are not thinking of Yogeshwara.

699
00:59:43,423 --> 00:59:46,048
We don't think that it is Yogeshwara,

700
00:59:46,089 --> 00:59:48,672
who will do everything for us, we are thinking,

701
00:59:48,714 --> 00:59:51,756
we have to do it. Alright, so we go ahead with this,

702
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:58,256
that, and spoil our attention completely.

703
00:59:58,256 --> 01:00:03,089
""Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja."

704
01:00:03,089 --> 01:00:09,381
In this part of your decision, if you can leave it to God,

705
01:00:09,423 --> 01:00:17,631
it would be better. I tell you, if you can do that,

706
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:21,797
you have crossed your ego half way through.

707
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:27,215
Because at least 50% ego is used in this.

708
01:00:27,215 --> 01:00:30,048
In the West especially.

709
01:00:30,048 --> 01:00:33,173
In India this question doesn't arise much.

710
01:00:33,173 --> 01:00:38,505
Because the parents can't decide here, nobody can decide,

711
01:00:38,506 --> 01:00:42,756
you have to decide yourself. It's a big responsibility

712
01:00:42,756 --> 01:00:45,215
and a big thing for you.

713
01:00:45,256 --> 01:00:49,173
So 50% of your ego problem will be finished,

714
01:00:49,173 --> 01:00:56,964
I tell you, once you just give up this responsibility

715
01:00:57,006 --> 01:01:08,631
of choosing a bride or a bridegroom for yourself. Just forget it.

716
01:01:08,631 --> 01:01:15,340
Such a waste of energy, I tell you.

717
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:22,006
When I see people, young people, doing all these things

718
01:01:22,048 --> 01:01:25,547
I wish they could understand the value of their lives,

719
01:01:25,547 --> 01:01:32,381
the esteem of their lives. Their Ishwara is Shri Krishna.

720
01:01:32,423 --> 01:01:43,340
He''s not Ishwara of everyone, only of yogis.

721
01:01:43,381 --> 01:01:45,256
Anybody else who tries to say

722
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:49,547
"Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" will get throat cancer.

723
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:55,131
Anybody who tries to call Him

724
01:01:55,173 --> 01:02:02,506
who is not a yogi gets a problem in the throat, you know.

725
01:02:02,506 --> 01:02:14,006
So He is only available to you, He is only your Ishwara.

726
01:02:14,048 --> 01:02:22,923
He manifests only for you. He is your own.

727
01:02:22,964 --> 01:02:28,631
He won't act for any Dick, Tom and Harry.

728
01:02:28,672 --> 01:02:30,589
Maybe you might be a prime minister,

729
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:33,672
you might be a king or queen, it makes no difference to him.

730
01:02:33,714 --> 01:02:38,923
To him only a yogi, only a yogi can call him.

731
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:43,089
Only a yogi can ask for his help.

732
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:46,465
He is not bothered about anybody else.

733
01:02:46,505 --> 01:02:55,797
And if a yogi recommends, then only He can look after someone.

734
01:02:55,797 --> 01:02:59,465
Otherwise He will not bother about him.

735
01:02:59,505 --> 01:03:13,089
So He is actually your own king, who is always there,

736
01:03:13,131 --> 01:03:20,340
looking after you. When you call Him,

737
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:27,881
He comes with all His powers to support you.

738
01:03:27,923 --> 01:03:35,173
But you have to be a yogi. If you are not a yogi,

739
01:03:35,215 --> 01:03:41,714
which is of course certified by Lord Jesus Christ,

740
01:03:41,756 --> 01:03:44,964
then Krishna has nothing to do with you.

741
01:03:45,006 --> 01:03:48,505
So before the entry to Shri Krishna,

742
01:03:48,505 --> 01:03:52,298
though He is not the one who is going to judge your innocence,

743
01:03:52,298 --> 01:03:59,672
in the door resides Lord Jesus Christ.

744
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:02,964
When you get in, then it's all right.

745
01:04:03,006 --> 01:04:09,589
But to get in, also is difficult because He''s always throwing you out.

746
01:04:09,589 --> 01:04:18,756
Shri Krishna has said, that "You will be the ...",

747
01:04:18,797 --> 01:04:23,923
to Jesus, He said, "You will be the Adhara, the support of the universe."

748
01:04:23,964 --> 01:04:26,547
Means the innocence is your support, innocence.

749
01:04:26,589 --> 01:04:29,298
If that innocence is not established in you,

750
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:36,505
then Shri Krishna cannot help you. He is helpless.

751
01:04:36,506 --> 01:04:39,298
Because you don't become a yogi and

752
01:04:39,298 --> 01:04:44,173
so He''s not your Ishwara any more.

753
01:04:44,173 --> 01:04:47,505
Now one may say that, "Mother the Agnya chakra

754
01:04:47,505 --> 01:04:52,048
is here and He is here," Alright,

755
01:04:52,048 --> 01:04:59,340
but Agnya chakra when you cross, here he is.

756
01:04:59,381 --> 01:05:06,048
When, you cross your Agnya chakra,

757
01:05:06,089 --> 01:05:10,505
that means He is sitting there and the Virata is sitting here.

758
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:17,756
So unless and until you pass your Agnya Chakra

759
01:05:17,797 --> 01:05:23,131
properly, you can't get to Virat.

760
01:05:23,131 --> 01:05:27,173
And Yogeshwara is the Virat.

761
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:35,089
That is the aspect we have to worship, we have to worship!

762
01:05:35,089 --> 01:05:39,881
Worshipping doesn't mean that you become that person.

763
01:05:39,923 --> 01:05:42,797
You worship Me, you don't become Me.

764
01:05:42,797 --> 01:05:45,381
What do you do, when you worship?

765
01:05:45,423 --> 01:05:51,589
You surrender all that is not liked by Me,

766
01:05:51,631 --> 01:06:05,672
in the fire, in the water, outside. In the elements you throw them away.

767
01:06:05,714 --> 01:06:11,714
And you bring to Me your heart. That''s what it is, worshipping.

768
01:06:11,756 --> 01:06:15,256
In the same way we have to worship the aspect

769
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:21,506
of Shri Krishna in me, which is Yogeshwara.

770
01:06:21,506 --> 01:06:24,714
I am Yogeshwara.

771
01:06:24,756 --> 01:06:28,131
Things do not come into My head at all,

772
01:06:28,173 --> 01:06:30,465
I don't see things like that.

773
01:06:30,505 --> 01:06:32,923
I don't know what is temptation is, what attraction is,

774
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:37,298
I just don't understand. On the contrary

775
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:41,465
these things repel me, repel absolutely, I vomit.

776
01:06:41,505 --> 01:06:47,131
Even to hear these things, I don't want to open My ears,

777
01:06:47,131 --> 01:06:51,381
My ears become deaf. I can't hear these things.

778
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:54,006
I can't understand any dirty jokes.

779
01:06:54,048 --> 01:06:57,256
I have no brains [for this]. My brains refuse to understand.

780
01:06:57,298 --> 01:07:06,881
I become a dull person, absolutely. Deaf and dumb.

781
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:09,589
People have written books and books on these things,

782
01:07:09,589 --> 01:07:11,256
I don't know what they must be writing.

783
01:07:11,298 --> 01:07:14,215
What is there to write on this?

784
01:07:14,256 --> 01:07:21,714
So today we have to know that our personal life

785
01:07:21,756 --> 01:07:25,089
has to be extremely clean.

786
01:07:25,089 --> 01:07:27,714
We face ourselves every moment

787
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:29,756
and find out within ourselves --

788
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:33,256
are we really worshipping Yogeshwara within ourselves

789
01:07:33,256 --> 01:07:39,215
who resides within us? Let us develop that purity.

790
01:07:39,256 --> 01:07:45,131
Then innocence will be established in our eyes.

791
01:07:45,173 --> 01:07:49,465
We'll be innocent. The eyes will speak of innocence.

792
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:53,298
What's the use of having eyes,

793
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,964
which are all the time shifting,

794
01:07:56,964 --> 01:07:59,256
you don't know where they are going, wobbling eyes,

795
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,256
you see, like this, like this, like this.

796
01:08:01,256 --> 01:08:04,006
You can't trust these eyes at all.

797
01:08:04,048 --> 01:08:09,797
But the eyes, which are innocent,

798
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:18,505
receive nothing they just give. They just give.

799
01:08:18,506 --> 01:08:24,006
Innocence is very penetrating, very purifying,

800
01:08:24,006 --> 01:08:32,215
very soothing and very beautiful.

801
01:08:32,215 --> 01:08:39,881
We have to become beautiful people.

802
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:46,589
Today I said on these things

803
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:53,131
because I'm sometimes disturbed the way people

804
01:08:53,173 --> 01:08:59,006
don't understand that purity of sex life

805
01:08:59,048 --> 01:09:03,298
is so important to Sahaja Yoga, especially in the West.

806
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:06,839
People don't understand.

807
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:11,340
To Indians this lecture has no meaning, they will think,

808
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,839
"Why Mother is wasting Her energy so much?"

809
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:16,381
Because they don't understand.

810
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:22,173
But to Me it is very important here.

811
01:09:22,215 --> 01:09:31,006
Whatever I have seen and heard and see all around.

812
01:09:31,006 --> 01:09:37,756
I think today's message should be of Yogeshwara.

813
01:09:37,797 --> 01:09:42,131
Let us worship Yogeshwara with our heart.

814
01:09:42,173 --> 01:09:44,089
When you worship Me today,

815
01:09:44,131 --> 01:09:49,547
it should be the worship of Yogeshwara and nothing else.

816
01:09:49,547 --> 01:09:53,631
May God bless you.
