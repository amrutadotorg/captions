1
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,770
So the principle of ascent

2
00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:16,599
is to be in the center,

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,610
to be in the balance,

4
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:21,091
to be in the maryadas of the center.

5
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:25,404
To be in the boundaries of the center is the principle.

6
00:00:26,464 --> 00:00:30,068
So what happens when we do not keep to the boundaries,

7
00:00:30,229 --> 00:00:32,399
to the maryadas?

8
00:00:35,454 --> 00:00:38,344
Then we get caught up.

9
00:00:38,693 --> 00:00:42,844
If we keep to maryadas we can never be caught up.

10
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:45,464
Many people say, “Why have the maryadas?”

11
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:48,211
Say we have the maryadas,

12
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:53,404
the boundaries of this beautiful ashram here

13
00:00:55,434 --> 00:01:00,421
and somebody is attacking you from all the sides,

14
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:03,592
on all the sides of the void,

15
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:08,731
so if you go out of the void you get caught up.

16
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:14,595
That’s why you have to keep to the boundaries,

17
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:19,511
and to keep to the boundaries

18
00:01:19,672 --> 00:01:21,811
is difficult when you have two problems:

19
00:01:21,972 --> 00:01:25,494
one is the ego, another is the superego.

20
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:31,069
Now as in the West superego is not such a problem.

21
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:35,414
Ego is the problem, and it has very, very subtle implications now,

22
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:39,564
I can see the complicated styles of egos we have.

23
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:44,127
One is a gross,

24
00:01:44,288 --> 00:01:46,784
like Khomeini style, which is dry,

25
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:50,955
is obvious, evident, everybody can condemn.

26
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:57,151
That one is the one,

27
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:02,991
either one corrects or gets completely destroyed.

28
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:10,413
But ego, if it is of a stupid person,

29
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:19,959
then he behaves in this manner only

30
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,112
that he doesn’t know how to hide his ego in sophistication.

31
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:29,166
But the Western ego is extremely sophisticated;

32
00:02:29,327 --> 00:02:33,347
the language, everything, is very sophisticated.

33
00:02:34,594 --> 00:02:36,444
Like in English language we’ll say,

34
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:40,455
“I’m afraid I have to slap you.”

35
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:48,487
“I’m sorry I have to kill you.”

36
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:52,293
It’s such a devious thing,

37
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:54,304
you see, once you’ve said “I’m sorry”

38
00:02:54,464 --> 00:02:58,384
that means you have put a chocolate on top of that, isn’t it?

39
00:02:58,544 --> 00:03:01,334
Such a camouflage, must understand.

40
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:03,314
See we must face as we are,

41
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,394
we cannot be facing something else.

42
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,468
But this is exactly what happens with sophistication,

43
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,569
that we avoid facing ourselves.

44
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:19,742
Today though the day is of celebration

45
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:22,044
so in all humor we should understand

46
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:25,344
what this stupid thing called ego is.

47
00:03:25,504 --> 00:03:27,607
In all humor, not in seriousness,

48
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:30,618
for I don’t want you again to feel guilty.

49
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:38,344
Now as I was explaining in the morning

50
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:42,303
how ego becomes the Left Vishuddhi.

51
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:46,036
I mean even before going to the hall,

52
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:50,575
My attention on the hall, I get a big lump here

53
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:53,731
- just, just painful horrible, excruciating.

54
00:03:53,892 --> 00:03:55,669
I mean all the time it has been there

55
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,978
since I’ve been in the West. Can you imagine?

56
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,122
It has never vanished.

57
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:02,314
So this chakra is all the time working,

58
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:06,534
poor thing is so much now tired, Vishnumaya’s chakra.

59
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,464
So what happens really,

60
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,384
we should see the physical side of it,

61
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:14,004
it’s very important to understand.

62
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:17,444
You see from childhood if we are taught

63
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:21,176
in a society like this, where you are an extrovert,

64
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:24,437
you have to achieve something, some success or this and that,

65
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,683
then the idea of strength is given to you,

66
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:32,957
that it is weakness to tolerate something.

67
00:04:33,118 --> 00:04:36,055
Imagine in Christian nations that’s the best part of it,

68
00:04:36,216 --> 00:04:38,769
“I’m sorry I will kill you,” sort of a thing.

69
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,441
In Christian nation, you see, they have this thing, theory

70
00:04:42,602 --> 00:04:49,323
that it is weakness that if you tolerate anything.

71
00:04:49,484 --> 00:04:54,894
It is a weakness if you get dominated by someone.

72
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:58,740
You can never be successful if you do like that.

73
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,919
So unless and until you are possessed

74
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,720
you can never be obedient.

75
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,610
This is what it is.

76
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,590
Somebody has to possess you,

77
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,730
absolutely possess you like Hitler,

78
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,103
then you can be obedient;

79
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,432
otherwise everybody has a big ego,

80
00:05:16,593 --> 00:05:20,671
as I had told you the story of the garbage cleaner.

81
00:05:20,832 --> 00:05:23,572
So everybody has a very, very big ego,

82
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:27,554
everybody wants to have their own way,

83
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:32,339
and from childhood you spoil your children too much,

84
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,910
you spoil them, completely spoil them.

85
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,770
All the time you‘ll hug them, you’ll hold them,

86
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:41,937
you’ll do too much, children get spoiled.

87
00:05:42,098 --> 00:05:44,783
Think no end of themselves and then on top of that,

88
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,189
if you tell them that you should not tolerate anything,

89
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,219
they become disobedient.

90
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:54,964
So you do not know how to obey others in any way.

91
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:57,999
Ego does not know how to obey, because that is weakness,

92
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,788
obedience is weakness.

93
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:10,019
So now this poor thing ego has a limited, limited thing.

94
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:15,620
That is, this ego has a balloon, which is limited.

95
00:06:15,781 --> 00:06:18,028
But it bursts when you get your paralysis

96
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,009
and all those things it does burst,

97
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:23,582
but it is flexible also.

98
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:29,793
So when the ego starts getting too much on top of the

99
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:35,763
superego, then the superego

100
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,150
can go up to a point, it is also there.

101
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:49,129
So to get rid of the ego people take drinks,

102
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,674
drugs just to push it back

103
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:57,914
so, increase the superego so the ego comes down.

104
00:06:58,078 --> 00:07:02,226
So you are playing between, then you have a hangover,

105
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:04,898
then it goes on like this, you see, works out.

106
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:10,073
This is the modern solution they find for ego, all right.

107
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:14,347
Otherwise ego is too much.

108
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:19,031
So when somebody says something to you,

109
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:21,511
instead of facing up to it

110
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:25,532
- supposing you find you have not been able to, say,

111
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:30,542
find a glass for Me, a simple thing like, take it like that.

112
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:35,472
You sulk. Why? Why should you sulk for that?

113
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,613
Because there’s another place

114
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:42,552
where this ego can go is when you come round,

115
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,492
you see here it crosses at Vishuddhi,

116
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:49,195
so when it is suppressed from the other side

117
00:07:49,356 --> 00:07:52,077
it goes into that Vishuddhi part.

118
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:56,898
So then you get the Left Vishuddhi,

119
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:01,183
it is nothing but pure ego. Believe Me, it’s pure ego,

120
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:05,263
because it has no other way to get in, it goes there

121
00:08:09,283 --> 00:08:12,408
and that’s how you sulk and think.

122
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:15,172
Think so you get more ego,

123
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:21,069
you fill up your left side and you sulk, you never face.

124
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,786
Now, the practical way

125
00:08:26,947 --> 00:08:33,648
the central path is established by being in reality.

126
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:37,551
Now as a matter of habit you must develop.

127
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:40,824
Supposing something has gone wrong,

128
00:08:40,984 --> 00:08:43,744
tell yourself, “Yes it has gone wrong,

129
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:45,654
because I’ve done the mistake.

130
00:08:45,814 --> 00:08:47,673
All right, why did I do the mistake?

131
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,952
Because of this, so next time no.”
