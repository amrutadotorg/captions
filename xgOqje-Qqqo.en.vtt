00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:15.710
Why I asked him to talk to arrange a meeting
with you people is this

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:25.359
because I’ve discovered that in Kali Yuga,
especially in the West, the problem will be

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:36.430
coming from the women.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.200
We have had a very bad problem in Australia,
you must have heard about it.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.730
Have you heard about it?

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.970
It’s a very serious problem.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.790
Now this wife has shown her ego so clearly.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:08.180
And She said: “I won’t listen to Mother,
I know I’m bhootish and I can’t help it

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:17.010
now anymore, and I want to disappear, with
my parents I’ll live, I’ll take my children

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.100
there, and do what you like.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.390
In case you want to have [the] children I
will fight you”.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:38.010
Because of her, these children had meningitis,
they were about to die, when I just was there

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.890
I saved them.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:53.010
But when in a negative woman, the ego enters,
then nobody can help.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:06.270
I, being a woman, you see, I can come much
closer to you people.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.730
And sometimes people start thinking that the
ladies have a special relationship with Me.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:23.350
Now new one who has come is another horrible
woman [In England].

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:35.030
And I don’t know what she -, how much she
is going to destroy us and damage us.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.790
And she wouldn’t allow anybody to talk to
her.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.190
She says: “I have a special relationship
with Mother."

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.380
She wouldn’t listen to any leaders, nothing,
and she did a horrible, horrible, horrible

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.380
thing.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.700
And especially in the west, you see, with
this woman slave and all these nonsensical

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.540
ideas have gone into the heads of even Sahaja
Yogis.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:11.630
One of the conditionings they have: women’s
lib, the liberation of women.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:25.400
Now in Sahaja Yoga nobody can dominate you,
because you are the Spirit and Spirit cannot

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.849
be dominated.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:36.590
If you think you are dominated then know that
you are not

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.590
the Spirit.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:46.070
So now we have to understand we are women
in Sahaja Yoga and we have to understand our

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.820
balancing power.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:56.349
As I’ve said many a time, there is a, they
are like two wheels of a chariot, one on the

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.430
left, one on the right.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:08.970
Now the left cannot be fixed on to the right,
and right cannot be fixed on to the left.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.489
We are made like that, we are made by the
Divine.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:24.080
But one should be very proud that you are
women.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.379
I am very proud that I am a woman.

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:36.610
Because women can perform so many things which
men cannot do.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.540
Woman is like the Mother Earth.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:55.639
So, and we can say the men are like the Sun,
both have to combine.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.919
But the Sun can be eliminated, but Earth cannot.

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.960
The Sun is not there in the night, still we
exist.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:15.199
But look at the Mother Earth, how much she
can bear!

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.870
How much she can bear.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:37.129
See now, she is so sensible, she creates beautiful
flowers, beautiful trees, everything for us

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.270
with out any grudge.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:53.589
And moreover that she nourishes us, despite
the fact we are doing so many sins against

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:54.589
her.

00:05:54.589 --> 00:06:00.189
But the Sun doesn’t want to become the Earth
and Earth doesn’t want to become the Sun.

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:10.560
Because they know they are stationed for a
particular purpose.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:18.060
Same women in Sahaja Yoga are very important
for Me.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:27.639
But the first thing they should have is a
bearing power.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:36.629
And also they should have lots and lots of
love and compassion.

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:44.619
Supposing without Me there was, supposing
in My place, say there was Christ.

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:54.749
He would have seen the condition of Sahaja
Yogis He would have crucified Himself.

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:55.749
Finished.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:11.960
Or if it was Krishna He would have taken a
Sudarshan in His hand and would have cut every

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.319
bodies’ heads.

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.499
Finished.

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:20.590
If it was Rama He would have used His arrows
and finished all of you.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.830
They would not have considered anything that
you have to have patience, you have to look

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:30.110
after, you have to bear, if you have to bear
fruits.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:39.360
So the women can only bear fruits.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:47.729
You can only produce children, which are Realized
Souls.

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:55.870
But if you go on a ego trip, you are neither
man nor woman, you become something in between,

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.939
neither here nor there.

00:07:59.939 --> 00:08:03.879
You are good for nothing.

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:11.449
So for a woman it doesn’t show, behoove
that she should be egoistical.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:19.189
It behooves better that she is more emotional.

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:26.780
Like she could feel sad sometimes and sometimes
the tears can come into her eyes,

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.979
like you see even I start weeping sometimes.

00:08:27.979 --> 00:08:31.830
When I am leaving you I feel so sad.

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:48.199
I don’t take out My hand and say sit down
there, you do this, I don’t talk like that,

00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:50.139
do I?

00:08:50.139 --> 00:08:53.209
I never even raise My voice.

00:08:53.209 --> 00:08:57.430
That’s only men can do.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:05.830
Whatever they can do let them do it, what
you can do, you can do.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:12.389
Absolute womanhood is the climax for you.

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:23.300
The complete womanhood is the climax.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.880
You should be an expert to be a woman.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.890
In cooking, in gardening, in looking after
people, in loving and just that’s how you

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:34.890
control everyone.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:51.100
Looking after, you see, you can be controlling
everyone not by all nonsensical things as

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.579
the men try to control, you see.

00:09:54.579 --> 00:10:01.819
Love is the best way to control any one.

00:10:01.819 --> 00:10:05.040
But love means sacrifice.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:12.600
But after sometime you won’t feel any sacrifice.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:24.320
Once you start enjoying giving, then it is
no more a sacrifice,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:31.870
and this is what is very important especially
for French women, because they have been very

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.519
dominating before.

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:52.060
So you have to now create a new tradition,
a new age, a new personality, that personality

00:10:52.060 --> 00:11:03.839
that will, that will give protection, nourishment,
everything to children, and companionship

00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:16.629
and affection to your husband.

00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:21.880
Women have been given so many qualities, because
their lifestyle is more difficult than that

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.360
of men.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:39.209
So I have to make one request to you that
you must try to make yourself into a proper

00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:42.449
Sahaja Yogini.

00:11:42.449 --> 00:11:48.910
I will say I’ll give all full credit to
Indian women, because they have created a

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.730
beautiful society.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:12:01.029
We had a prime minister as a woman, but we
had so many great warriors as women as leaders

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:03.449
of the armies.

00:12:03.449 --> 00:12:16.620
But this was during wartime, not all the time,
otherwise they were just housewives.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:24.949
So God has given you special qualities.

00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:32.079
If you want to improve on it, if you want
to manifest them then you have to know that

00:12:32.079 --> 00:12:40.329
you are a woman and you have to be dignified
like a woman.

00:12:40.329 --> 00:12:46.360
And that works out very well.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:56.970
Now supposing you are egoistical and you are
quarrelsome and hot by temperament, then your

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:02.899
children will take after you.

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:09.769
They don’t, they don’t take after the
father.

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:13.850
They take after the mother.

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:19.699
So that is why the Indian society is so good,
society is excellent.

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:25.480
But Indian men are hopeless.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:34.200
They have made a mess of our politics, mess
of our economics.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:44.040
But at least maybe your [French] men are better,
I don’t know that.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:52.350
I must say they are at least they are milder
people than Indian, the men are very dominating,

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:53.449
very dominating.

00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:57.519
But we just laugh, you know, we know that’s
their nature is you see, just like a child

00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:05.410
tries to dominate, the husband also tries
to dominate.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:11.829
And if they dominate somebody else they will
be beaten up, so they want to dominate us.

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:28.899
[Shri Mataji laughts] Or else where should
they take out their temper?

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:30.779
Yes.

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:42.550
So it’s nice that they are taking on us,
otherwise outside they will be beaten up!

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:49.319
If you find any man to be very quiet and nice
then know that his wife must be having a bad

00:14:49.319 --> 00:14:50.319
time.

00:14:50.319 --> 00:15:03.029
[Shri Mataji laughts] [A Sahaja Yogini Marie
translates this part because the Sahaja Yogi

00:15:03.029 --> 00:15:07.600
translator has just become speechless.]

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.050
So you should just make a fun out of it and
shouldn’t take it so seriously and you should

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:16.550
know that you have much more bearing power
and you know how to handle the situation and

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.899
you are much wiser and much collected.

00:15:20.899 --> 00:15:25.990
[Shri Mataji to Marie.]

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.360
Will you do it Marie?

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.360
You tell them.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:39.180
If he’s a little embarrassed you’d better
tell.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.649
[Laughter.

00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:48.070
Marie translates now]
So life becomes a fun.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:16:02.660
And you see men will remain men, women will
remain women, whatever dress you may wear.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.529
You have to be what you are.

00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:12.600
But once you know what you are you will enjoy
yourself.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.800
Men will always see the watches.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.990
Women will be always late.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:32.350
Sahaja Yogi: The flight has been delayed of
25 minutes Shri Mataji.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.759
[Laughter.

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:42.399
Applause]
Shri Mataji: He was seeing the watch.

00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:43.399
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

00:16:43.399 --> 00:16:44.399
Don’t keep it.

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:51.209
I do those tricks with My husband also.

00:16:51.209 --> 00:16:53.759
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.790
See the fun.

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:57.970
You see, sometimes he is so particular.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.079
I am going and he is after My life, you see.

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:01.079
“You better go now, better go now."

00:17:01.079 --> 00:17:05.260
I say: “I am going, you are not going, why
are you looking at your watches."

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:06.950
And whenever he goes with Me, he does the
same.

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.270
Then always the plane is 2 hours late.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.270
And he never knows.

00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:12.120
Then he goes to the airport.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.870
Then he finds out 2 hours late.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:24.450
Then we are hanging there in the air.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:29.390
Yes, Yes, about My husband only.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:39.290
And sometimes he is going with Me just to
leave Me, you see, there.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.420
I tell him, don’t come.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.030
But he”ll come and he will go on after My
life.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.030
“You’re getting late, you’re getting
late."

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:47.770
Then the plane will be 3 hours late.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:48.770
[Laughter.]

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.870
It is like that.

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.970
So it’s such a fun.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:01.720
Life is make it a beautiful life.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.640
No use quarrelling, fighting, becoming obstinate.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:18.280
These are not good things.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.820
And also it’s nice if some husband says
that: “Do this”.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.820
“All right I will do it” say that.

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:33.940
Now you do it yourself, you will like it to
do something like that, no harm.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:51.290
Or even the leader says: “You should do
something”.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:19:01.220
But if you go on saying no, no to everything,
then he gets fed up with you.

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.690
And there is no grace.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:11.300
So why to create problems?

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:19.340
Now say, supposing somebody puts some paper
[wallpaper] here, all right.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:27.420
Now supposing I put some paper, but supposing
My husband doesn’t like it.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:33.600
So he will say: “All right please remove
this paper”.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.200
Now wise woman will say: “All right I will
remove it.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.880
When should I do it?”

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.400
“Tomorrow there is a party, so you can’t
remove.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400
All right.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.800
Day after tomorrow we are going away, so you
can’t remove.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.530
All right we will do it after three days”.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.510
Within three days the people who come to the
party will definitely say: “What a nice

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:51.510
paper!”

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:57.400
All the ladies will say, because it’s a
ladies’ taste.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.120
You see, men want to make an office, you see.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.190
So they will come, what a nice paper what
a nice- then husband will say: “You better

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:44.890
keep it, it’s very nice I think”.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:21:21.490
That’s how they are.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.670
So you understand how, you must know how to
handle.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:39.400
That’s, that’s a beauty a woman has, she
knows how to handle the situation.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.710
If she does not know how to handle the situation
and then she just starts just jumping at husband,

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:57.180
jumping at children, that that shows she is
not capable.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:04.870
And the capacity of a woman is how she handles
the situation, brings for the peace in the

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:17.580
family, how she makes everybody feel comfortable
and happy.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:46.000
You see how she we can say articulate with
other people, how she makes them feel comfortable,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.880
her home is her domain.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.710
And in that, you see, some women are experts.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:23:00.530
And that’s what you have to make your daughters
also.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:05.860
This is how we are going to have Sahaja Yoga
women.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:15.450
We don’t want Joan of Arcs just now.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:27.180
But they have to be very brave, courageous,
and compassionate personality.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.650
And you must listen to your leaders.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.940
I have so many complaints sometimes.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:50.550
I cannot attend to you directly.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:54.210
We have tried leadership with ladies, doesn’t
work out.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:58.930
Marie herself [the translator] was a leader,
she gave up.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:11.160
She said: “I don’t want to be a leader,
give it to any one."

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.160
She gave up.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.720
Now we have one Christine as a leader.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:22.020
The other day only she telephoned to Me: “Mother
will You please give it to somebody else."

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.570
[Laughter.]

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:43.020
Because she realizes, you see, that to handle
these men is better to have a man, only to

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.020
handle them.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.020
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:54.270
Now, men are more intelligent, no doubt, but
women have intuition.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.170
But you don’t have to argue.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:11.520
It will happen, the way you have intuition
will happen and they will learn a lesson.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:21.271
So, that you don’t assert yourself, it will
all work out the way you like, because you

00:25:21.271 --> 00:25:32.250
have intuition, you have understood what’s
going to happen.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.680
And you’ll be amazed how it will work out.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.430
All right, So now any questions.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.430
Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible.]

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:52.240
Shri Mataji: What is it?

00:25:52.240 --> 00:26:28.120
Ask Joseph [?]
Sahaja Yogi: She would like to know what You

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.120
mean by intelligence.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.120
Shri Mataji: Intelligence.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.120
Intelligence is gross.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.120
Say for example, with intelligence they will
say that we are getting late, we have to go,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.230
with intelligence [rationality], with the
watch and all this.

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:47.330
But by intuition you will know we are not
going to be late.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.020
So you develop your intuition, not intelligence.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:27:01.130
You see the trouble is, you try to compete
them with intelligence.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:04.560
By argument you will say: “No there are
three minutes”.

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.400
They will say: “Two minutes”.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.770
You will say: “Three minutes”.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.110
“Two minutes”.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.130
Yes that’s it.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:18.360
But actually what you should say: “All right
lets see, three minutes, all right, lets see,

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.460
lets see”, like that.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:28.130
And then he finds really what you said is
true!

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:32.740
You just have to say once.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.740
Finished.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.740
After that he says: “All right, all right”.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.290
You should say: “All right we will go this
way”.

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:45.730
He’ll go further: “I think we are going
wrong, I think what you said was right, we

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:53.470
had to go this way”.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:28:11.640
In Sahaja Yoga all these men and women, I
have managed through My intuition.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:21.230
But the intuition of women in the West is
very poor I must say, because they are very

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.230
argumentative.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:29.570
So, you see, the special quality with this
intuition must be developed.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.260
All right?

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:39.210
Now see the difference, because you are deep,
you are much deeper.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:47.040
In evolution you are higher, no doubt.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:54.310
But you start competing with them and also
enslaving them quite a lot.

00:28:54.310 --> 00:29:06.270
Like this culture in this, where we see all
the women exposing their body just to attract

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:19.020
men, all the time attract the men is what?

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.160
Why should you attract men?

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.680
Always trying to have your exposure of your
body just to please men, why?

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.170
Why should we do that?

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:32.360
Why should we expose our body?

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:39.520
There’s a story Ravindranath has written
where there is a writer, you see, he was writing

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.520
a story, a love story.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.790
So he asked his wife: “Supposing before
marriage if I had come and asked you that

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.880
you elope with me, what you would do?”

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.890
She said: “I will, I would have reported
to police immediately”.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:30:10.830
Ravindranath Tagore writing this story about
a writer.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:19.070
That’s what it is.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:37.140
You see, so you keep your dignity.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.180
You see the way women expose themselves, run
after men, then how can we complain there

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:46.170
is rape and all that, I mean we want it as
if it’s the way we want, as if we want all

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:47.350
this attention of men, dirty attention of
men.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:31:05.460
But Sahaja Yoginis are not like that.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.840
They are dignified.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:22.080
They have their own, they have their own poise
and they have respect for themselves, because

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.570
they are Yoginis.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:29.660
They have light above their head.

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.530
They are special people.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.640
So we have to really de-condition ourself
a little bit.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:43.470
Especially the ego part, which is very, very
developed in the West should be brought down

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:44.470
by women.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:58.890
I’ll tell you one incident how I brought
down the ego of a saint once.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:13.990
Once, you know, I went to see some saint who
was living in a very high mountain.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:33.890
He was an evolved soul, but a man, you see,
so he had some ego I think in him.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:43.220
So it started raining very heavily and it
would not stop.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:48.330
And it was said that this saint could control
the rain.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:57.220
And he got very upset when I went up there,
he was just going on like this, like that,

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:01.180
feeling very bad about the whole thing that
he could not control the rain.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:15.810
So he came later on, when I went and sat down
I was all drenched, you see.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:19.350
So he came and he touched My feet, of course
that he did.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:28.030
But then he said: “Mother why did You not
allow me to control the rain?

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:41.220
Is it that You wanted to control my ego?”

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:46.250
I said: “No, not at all.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:52.190
I didn’t want to control your ego by any
chance."

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:56.870
“Then why did You not allow me to stop the
rain?”

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:05.060
So I said: “The problem is like this.

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:10.590
You are a saint and a sanyasi you see and
you bought a saree for Me and I can’t take

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:11.590
a saree from a sanyasi.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:31.840
But if I get drenched then I can easily take
the saree."

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:40.330
Very sweetly I told him.

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:46.320
So he said: “You know I have a saree for
You."

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:53.470
And he didn’t know what to answer.

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:56.170
Then I told him that: “You regard Me as
Adishakti, isn’t it."

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:57.340
“Yes, yes,” he said.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.190
“Yes I do.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:01.190
You have greater powers."

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.280
I said: “That’s not the point.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.460
But when I was coming I thought if the rain
flows over My body then the whole thing will

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.160
get vibrated and you will have a very lush
area here.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:17.250
That’s why I wanted to do that."

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:46.180
And he was completely paralyzed down below,
you see, but he got hold of My feet and started

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.390
crying.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:55.840
He said: “My Mother, please forgive me."

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:06.370
See this is what intelligence is and this
is what intuition is.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:08.100
All right?

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:18.300
So try to develop your intuition and always
say yes to every thing, but whatever you know

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:26.520
will happen.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.330
But we, if we decide:” No this should happen
like this, it must be like this, it must be

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:37.540
like that”, if you go on like that, you
see then you will make everybody miserable

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:48.100
and you will be miserable.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:37:18.250
Now if you have kept the cup like this, then
you will say no like this.

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:19.250
Then husband will come and put like that.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:20.250
Then you will keep it like that.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:24.310
Go on like that, you see.

00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:36.650
But if you are a real woman you said all right
keep it like that only, all right, keep it.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:43.390
So immediately all the Ganas will come to
help you.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:55.520
Either he will spill the whole tea on himself
or he will break the ear of the cup.

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.240
That’s how the Ganas will help you.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.260
[Shri Mataji laughs.]

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.500
So you are the Devis.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.700
You see they will all look after you.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:10.990
If you want to be men, half way and there,
why should the Ganas be bothered about such

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:13.900
half people?

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:25.700
I’ve tried that, many a times I’ve tried
that [Shri Mataji laughs.]

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:34.570
And I’ve seen people, you see, try to show
off too much and they just don’t know how

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.450
they get lost ultimately, you see.

00:38:37.450 --> 00:38:41.700
So the main thing is, that you develop your
intuition and leave it to your intuition and

00:38:41.700 --> 00:39:05.920
whatever is your intuition will come true,
because intuition is coming from the Ganas.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:17.530
So the left side is to be developed in a way
for Ganas to be pleased.

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:31.110
And once you develop the Ganas with you, no
body can touch you.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:39.320
See today we had gone out and the car was
kept there, it was all locked.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:53.800
And I had a very expensive sweater and an
extremely expensive shawl inside the car.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:40:02.620
And suddenly intuition came into My head and
I asked them: “Have you really locked the

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:05.730
car properly?”

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:10.400
They said: “Yes."

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:16.619
I said: “Better see."

00:40:16.619 --> 00:40:20.940
But they said: “Yes, all right."

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:30.940
But, when we went into the car they said:
“Where is the Radio?”

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:38.200
So Patrick started looking in his pocket you
see.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.950
They started searching here and there.

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:47.290
I said that: The thief is not going to leave
it in the car.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:49.710
He must have taken it away”.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:54.990
But all My things were intact.

00:40:54.990 --> 00:41:00.190
Ganas must have beaten them: “Don’t touch
this."

00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:16.380
Because these are much more expensive than
that, but still nobody touched it.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:25.360
And they [men] have many deficiencies, which
are very interesting, like they always forget

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.360
things.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.360
Always!

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.360
[Laughter.]

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:45.280
Forget, this they will leave there, this they
will leave there, that they will forget.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.080
You see that’s their specialty.

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:53.530
You give them the key: “Oh you never give
me the key!” they will say.

00:41:53.530 --> 00:41:55.400
“All right.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.840
I never gave you the key, all right?”

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:04.250
So then he- now My husband is very tall.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:15.420
So I see everything above six feet and there
it is.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:22.470
So it’s very interesting, isn’t it?

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:30.080
So you should be calm and quiet and collected.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:38.040
Collected together.

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:44.510
And then you will see how all the Ganas are
with you.

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:58.530
And after sometime, your husband will be walking
behind you in every way, in money matters,

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:01.250
in everything.

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:06.190
Right, we had lots of profit in our house,
you see.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.580
So My husband gave Me some money and kept
his money very nicely, some sort of a God

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:31.850
knows, he said: “We’ll get a big interest
this that”.

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:32.850
I said: “All right.

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:36.120
It’s all right”.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:44.520
And I bought a house a little, small little
part of the Hounslow house.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:50.290
And the house has now achieved the price seven
times.

00:43:50.290 --> 00:44:00.970
And his savings now are not even one fourth
of what I have.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:11.770
So it’s not even one fourth now his savings
are.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:17.340
So now he is saying: “Should I buy a house?

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:18.510
If You say I will buy a house."

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:26.210
I said: “Not now, because it’s the highest
price.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:32.100
It is the highest price now."

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:40.150
He said: “How do You know economics?”

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:42.450
“Just intuition."

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:51.030
He is an honours of economics and he’s got
gold medals, imagine!

00:44:51.030 --> 00:45:02.640
They are so intelligent that they lack common
sense and practical sense.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:09.260
See they have one type of a dress they go
on wearing it.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.260
You can change so many times, do this.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:14.110
They have no time.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:21.770
They are gross people.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:31.330
Common sense they don’t have.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:39.230
So you are a complement to them.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:52.420
They are good at laws and regulations and
things.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.810
There you must accept what they are saying.

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:59.500
And if they say: “Do this and do that”
you must accept, because they know that part.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:09.650
They are conversant with that part and should
never argue.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:14.360
You cannot achieve anything after with arguments.

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.090
All right?

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:21.270
Now this is for one question.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.380
Now which is the other one?

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:25.460
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:26.460
All right?

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:27.460
So everybody seems to be happy now.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:37.800
We have to get the Ganas on our side.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:42.770
All right?

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:52.720
May God bless you.
