00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.277
Now then there we have another center
on top,

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:26.701
which we call as the Heart Center.
It is in the center.

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:30.496
Now in the sternum bone, behind the sternum
bone this center is there,

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:36.215
and thymus produces the antibodies
in your sternum bone.

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:40.801
These antibodies later on fight your
diseases.

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:44.410
When you are about twelve years of age
they go into the whole body,

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:51.965
and waiting there for a signal from
your sternum bone.

00:00:52.173 --> 00:00:54.355
That means supposing you see something,
you get frightened,

00:00:54.556 --> 00:00:56.418
this bone starts pulsating.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.832
When it pulsates the antibodies know
there’s some emergency,

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:02.160
and they get prepared for it.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:06.658
Now this is such a normal thing to happen
to people,

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.512
but the insecurities can be of the worst
type,

00:01:10.713 --> 00:01:13.051
and when these insecurities develop,

00:01:13.252 --> 00:01:16.113
people can develop all kinds of diseases
of the lungs;

00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:20.465
specially the women develop what you call
as the breast cancer.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:24.176
Mostly these women are insecured: maybe
their husbands are not good,

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:28.098
or they feel that the husband may leave
them alone or something like that.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.026
There are certain insecurities that are
built in.

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:34.199
They might be quite frightened
personalities.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.330
I have seen most of the air-hostesses

00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:38.426
have this Center Heart catching,

00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:41.379
because they are afraid they may miss
the plane or I don’t know,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.183
they have to be on the job and run and do.

00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:46.993
Mostly these time-bound jobs

00:01:47.194 --> 00:01:50.574
cause you a trouble here of the Center
Heart,

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:53.238
and this Center Heart is very important,

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.183
because for women specially they have
to be secured.

00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:59.465
If their motherhood is challenged then
they are even worse.

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:02.933
And this is how one has to understand,
a woman should be

00:02:03.134 --> 00:02:07.683
very much respected if she is your wife,
she’s your child or anything,

00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:11.113
she has to be respected and given
all the security.

00:02:11.314 --> 00:02:15.113
It’s the woman who makes the society,
is the woman who creates the children,

00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:17.387
is the woman who looks after the children.

00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:22.729
So the men have to give all the security
and the protection to the womenhood

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.832
and understand that it is a very important
factor,

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.535
which if we neglect we can have lots
of problems with our society;

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.066
and the women will start competing with men

00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:36.761
and then the society will be all
dislocated.

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:48.214
If there’s any problem with your father,
then the right side catches

00:02:48.415 --> 00:02:50.847
and it gives you asthma.

00:02:51.048 --> 00:02:54.079
First of all you are, we can say,
vulnerable to asthma,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.557
due to bad liver. Plus if you have problems

00:02:56.758 --> 00:03:01.109
with your father or if with your fatherhood –
supposing you are an unhappy father,

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.972
or maybe that you are not looking after
your children,

00:03:04.173 --> 00:03:06.901
then you get this center caught up
very badly.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.262
It can happen to any one of us, if a man
is unkind to his son,

00:03:12.476 --> 00:03:14.231
is the father principle.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:19.255
If the son is unkind to the father, so
the father is hurt,

00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:23.770
is the father principle - if it is
disturbed by any chance,

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:30.044
or if suddenly father dies and you feel
the pinch of that all your life,

00:03:30.245 --> 00:03:34.559
all that can work out here, and you get
this Right Heart catch,

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.083
with that you get asthma.

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:41.512
It is said that in homeopathy they believe
that with more tension you get it,

00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:45.184
because when you are more tense, you see,
you remember your father,

00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:47.106
if he was here he would have helped you.

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:49.307
In the subconscious sometimes it works out

00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:53.543
and that’s how it adds to the problem.

00:03:54.416 --> 00:03:58.733
It is so simple to work out, that you’ll
be amazed

00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:04.919
that if you have to just raise the
principle of father in a person like that,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.380
who might be a dejected father, who
might be a cruel father,

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.762
who might be a son who has lost a father,
can be anything,

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:15.995
that you have to just put your hand
on that part.

00:04:23.728 --> 00:04:33.567
On the left hand side of this, is
the essence of motherhood.

00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:37.775
If in your childhood

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:45.454
your mother had played a role which
has given you fear,

00:04:45.655 --> 00:04:51.540
or kind of a frightening experience, then
this center goes out,

00:04:51.741 --> 00:04:55.134
we say the Left Heart is catching.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.840
Sometimes, if you are a bad mother also,
it might catch.

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:08.556
This center is very important. On the left
hand side is the mother’s side,

00:05:08.757 --> 00:05:11.398
and the mother itself, if the mother is a lunatic, you get a problem there.

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.494
You might get it, we call it a Heart:

00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:17.663
there are two Hearts, one is the Heart
of the Spirit

00:05:17.864 --> 00:05:20.595
and one is the Heart Chakra.

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:26.158
If a mother is a fanatic, she is a woman
who is very fanatic about her food,

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.728
things like that, then the children get it.

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:31.736
It’s a dangerous thing to play with
children like that,

00:05:31.937 --> 00:05:35.595
to have complete discipline on the children
and just keep them,

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:38.884
“Must walk straight like a horse, put
two things and...”

00:05:39.124 --> 00:05:41.205
Children should be allowed to have
their freedom.

00:05:41.406 --> 00:05:44.774
Actually, when we suppress them too much,
they become hooligans.

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:47.914
That way Indians are better, they know
how to bring up their children.

00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:52.752
With this cruelty towards children, I don’t
know what women are up to.

00:05:52.953 --> 00:05:54.859
Where are they going to take their figures

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.306
and their beauties and everything?
In front of God?

00:06:00.874 --> 00:06:05.611
Such cruelty exists, such
self-centeredness!

00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:08.387
Then, with all, this the children develop
this trouble

00:06:08.588 --> 00:06:12.998
and they have palpitations. They have
very weak hearts.

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:16.906
Or when the children

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:19.166
are not nice to the mother, they
also get it.

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:23.783
So mother and father are very important
factors in Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:23.984 --> 00:06:29.022
and you have to understand that if your
parents have been unkind to you,

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:31.696
you must forgive them. Just forget
about them -

00:06:31.897 --> 00:06:34.327
because they have given you birth -
you should be thankful,

00:06:34.528 --> 00:06:37.212
and just forget about them. That’s
the best way

00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:40.820
to get over the problem of Left
and Right Heart.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.648
So I have explained to you all these
things, now this is the heart.

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:55.453
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:02.890
The Spirit is watching the game of this
creation,

00:07:03.677 --> 00:07:08.804
and is watching what is happening to this
person,

00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:12.757
to this person, to this person, to this
person.

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:21.467
Everybody has got in their heart
the Spirit, which is watching.

00:07:21.668 --> 00:07:26.296
It’s called as the Kshetragnya, means
the One, the Knower of the field.

00:07:26.497 --> 00:07:30.249
He is watching you, every minute.
He knows what you do,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:36.678
where you go, what mistakes you create,
He watches, He doesn’t interfere.

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:41.242
Is only the interference comes from here,
from that area,

00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:45.968
which tries to give you a conscience,
which tries to improve you.

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:48.614
From here sometimes, the wisdom part,

00:07:48.815 --> 00:07:51.966
which tries to tell you ‘be in the center’,
by punishing you,

00:07:52.167 --> 00:07:54.788
by showing it is wrong.

00:07:54.989 --> 00:08:01.093
But He is just watching the game,
“Let’s see how far it goes”.

00:08:01.294 --> 00:08:05.453
He is the Knower of your field.

00:08:05.654 --> 00:08:09.484
He is the Universal Being within you.

00:08:09.685 --> 00:08:16.305
He is the reflection of that God Almighty
who is a Spectator within you.

00:08:16.918 --> 00:08:21.285
And His power is this all-pervading power

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:24.879
which has created all this.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.288
So, to feel this all-pervading power,

00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:32.805
you have to become the Spirit.

00:08:33.115 --> 00:08:36.470
All this creation has no meaning if you
do not become the Spirit.

00:08:36.671 --> 00:08:41.337
In the Vedas, the first, the very first
stanza says

00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:45.337
that by reading Vedas if you do not
become vid –

00:08:45.538 --> 00:08:49.618
vid means, Veda word comes from vida,
vida means to know –

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:54.360
if you do not become the knowledge, then
it has no meaning.

00:08:55.648 --> 00:08:57.226
Shri Mataji: What’s the question?

00:08:57.427 --> 00:08:59.181
Seeker: You were talking about the Spirit

00:08:59.382 --> 00:09:03.220
being in the Heart chakra there, over
on the left side.

00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:06.752
I’d like to know why it’s on the left
instead of in the middle,

00:09:06.953 --> 00:09:09.744
because if the Spirit – it has to do
with Realization –

00:09:09.945 --> 00:09:12.323
why isn’t it in the middle in the central
Kundalini,

00:09:12.524 --> 00:09:16.531
instead of on the other side like that,
and why is it… and why in…

00:09:16.732 --> 00:09:18.229
Shri Mataji: …the heart.
Seeker: Yeah.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.006
Shri Mataji: Heart is the main thing
within us, you see;

00:09:21.207 --> 00:09:25.244
that’s the last. Once heart stops, we
don’t exist:

00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:28.022
it’s sheer existence.

00:09:28.223 --> 00:09:32.405
That’s the most important organ that
God has given us.

00:09:32.606 --> 00:09:40.718
Once the Spirit is angry, in any
way strained, any way despaired,

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:45.250
He just disappears, and then we die;
there’s nothing left.

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:49.283
Heart is very important, that’s why
He's placed there.
