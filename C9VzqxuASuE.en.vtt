00:03.280 --> 00:10.160
The first power that you get is that you become,

00:10.240 --> 00:15.200
your awareness becomes collectively conscious,

00:15.280 --> 00:21.240
that you can feel another person\hon your fingertips,

00:21.360 --> 00:25.480
that means\hyou become absolutely aware.

00:25.680 --> 00:29.800
Like, I went today to Mexico

00:29.880 --> 00:33.280
and I could feel\h the whole country.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.440
I knew about it before,

00:36.560 --> 00:40.200
but my attention was not so deeply there.

00:40.280 --> 00:45.200
I\hcould feel the whole country has a very bad left side problem

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
and the left side\hproblem is affecting even this area.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.600
And the left side problem, you can feel it very clearly

00:56.680 --> 00:59.200
that your left side becomes heavy

00:59.280 --> 01:06.160
and you feel the heat in all your\hcenters.

01:06.240 --> 01:11.960
So, you start feeling the atmosphere,

01:12.080 --> 01:18.520
the country, the\hpeople and individual and yourself.

01:20.480 --> 01:24.320
So, you know the problem of a particular place.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.920
I\hmean you may not feel that much, in the beginning,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.800
you may just feel yourself to begin with.

01:31.880 --> 01:35.440
Then you start feeling others.

01:35.520 --> 01:42.160
So, thus the awareness grows more and more.

01:42.240 --> 01:51.160
In the central nervous system, you start feeling the problems of other people,

01:51.240 --> 01:54.280
your own problems.

01:54.960 --> 02:01.760
But it is not that you feel them as something, which is painful or troublesome,

02:01.880 --> 02:05.840
but you feel them as little heat

02:05.960 --> 02:10.560
or sometimes little pain, very little,

02:10.640 --> 02:14.720
as\hif you are recording it like a barometer.

02:15.640 --> 02:20.720
And when that happens you want to get rid of it,

02:20.800 --> 02:24.120
as if they are your own problem,

02:24.480 --> 02:28.320
and if you know how to get rid of it, you can do it.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.600
That’s what I was doing and that’s how I’m late,

02:32.760 --> 02:35.320
something on the collective.

02:35.440 --> 02:41.600
If you\hare working on something you want to finish the job

02:42.760 --> 02:47.240
and then you want to attend to another.

02:47.320 --> 02:52.800
Don’t want to leave something half done.

02:52.960 --> 02:57.920
For human beings, it is difficult in the beginning,

02:58.000 --> 03:03.520
because from human awareness you are rising to super humaness

03:03.600 --> 03:07.160
or you can call it to super awareness,

03:07.240 --> 03:09.800
into a subtler awareness.

03:09.880 --> 03:17.000
So, first the awareness\his gross and then your awareness becomes subtler.

03:18.120 --> 03:23.520
But with that, you do not fell in\hany way uncomfortable

03:23.800 --> 03:29.840
or upset,\hbecause you become extremely\hpowerful.

03:30.280 --> 03:35.280
Such power of compassion,\h\hthat you don’t feel anything,

03:35.360 --> 03:43.600
no pain, no\hproblems, the illusions disappear completely.

03:43.680 --> 03:47.400
There’s no more illusion in the mind.

03:47.480 --> 03:57.360
Like, people say that when you face something you are filled with the greed,

03:57.440 --> 04:00.520
or\hgreed or lust.

04:00.600 --> 04:06.880
But when your eyes become pure, there is no greed or lust.

04:06.960 --> 04:14.040
But what happens, that you start feeling the oneness

04:14.840 --> 04:20.920
with another thing, whatever it is,

04:21.120 --> 04:24.920
in a way\hthat it is joy giving.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.480
Like, you see someone, an attractive person,

04:30.560 --> 04:36.680
there is no sensation\hof baser feelings for that person.

04:36.840 --> 04:42.000
But the sensation just disappears

04:42.080 --> 04:46.400
and you start feeling the joy

04:46.480 --> 04:52.520
of the creation of that person or the thing.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.120
Like in Mexico, people have made so many things with hand.

04:57.200 --> 05:01.000
If you watch them, you might think,

05:01.080 --> 05:06.600
"How much it will cost? what will be the price? Who has made it?"

05:06.680 --> 05:11.240
But if there is no thought, then you see something,

05:11.320 --> 05:14.960
which looks very\hjoyous,

05:15.040 --> 05:18.320
because you can feel the vibrations.

05:18.400 --> 05:23.400
And you know somebody has made it, who might have been a Realized soul,

05:23.960 --> 05:28.480
who might have been a very great devotee of God,

05:28.560 --> 05:37.440
might have been a person who must have thought that, “This is your creation, oh God.”

05:38.280 --> 05:43.600
Such a person might have made, with that\hfeeling

05:43.680 --> 05:48.040
which is to be gratified, and you feel\hthat, "We should take it".

05:48.120 --> 05:50.120
The matter has only one\hcapacity

05:50.200 --> 05:53.560
that it gives joy in giving to others,

05:53.640 --> 05:56.760
so that you can express your happiness into it.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.520
So, you become very subtly aware of the matter,

06:00.600 --> 06:04.760
that you start understanding the matter, what it means

06:04.840 --> 06:08.560
and what is the use of a particular thing.

06:08.640 --> 06:12.120
In the same way, when you meet people,

06:12.200 --> 06:15.200
new people, absolutely never known,

06:15.320 --> 06:18.720
you know what are their needs,

06:18.800 --> 06:21.000
what\hproblems they have,

06:21.080 --> 06:23.680
on a wider scale, on a collective scale,

06:23.760 --> 06:27.800
and also you know one\hsimple thing

06:27.880 --> 06:34.680
that there are people in Mexico,

06:35.640 --> 06:40.080
who are seeking God, who are to be helped,

06:40.160 --> 06:44.440
who are to be given something that they want.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.960
They may not be so much aware of it.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.080
But we become aware of them.

06:50.160 --> 06:55.400
And a kind of a rapport of a very subtle type is established

06:55.800 --> 07:05.320
and you get attracted towards other people not through any lust or greed or any purpose

07:05.400 --> 07:13.040
but in oneness with the joy that they have within themselves,

07:13.120 --> 07:17.320
the joy of the Spirit.

07:17.400 --> 07:27.160
You look at them and you feel, “This person is such a wonderful person”.

07:27.320 --> 07:34.160
How do you know? You start feeling the cool vibrations in your hand from that person.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.080
And you just enjoy that person for that person’s sake,

07:38.160 --> 07:41.840
not for anything, whether poor, rich,

07:41.960 --> 07:45.400
good looking, bad looking, doesn’t matter.

07:45.480 --> 07:51.360
You approach the Spirit of another person because you have become the Spirit.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.920
People talk of big things, of organizing peace missions,

07:57.000 --> 08:01.920
this mission, that mission, to create a better relationship.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.760
All relationships,\hwhich are at a gross level create problems,

08:07.880 --> 08:13.000
because there is some sort of a lurking selfishness behind it.

08:13.440 --> 08:19.873
But once it becomes the spiritual
relationship you just enjoy the other person

08:19.953 --> 08:25.480
without getting into any discussion about what is your gain,

08:25.560 --> 08:35.360
what is you are going to achieve
through going nearer to that personality.

08:35.480 --> 08:40.914
Thus you become the receiver of the\hjoy.
