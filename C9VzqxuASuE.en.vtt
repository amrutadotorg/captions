00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.160
The first power that you get is that you become,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.200
your awareness becomes collectively conscious,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.240
that you can feel another person&nbsp;on your fingertips,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.480
that means&nbsp;you become absolutely aware.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.800
Like, I went today to Mexico

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.280
and I could feel&nbsp; the whole country.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.440
I knew about it before,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.200
but my attention was not so deeply there.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.200
I&nbsp;could feel the whole country has a very bad left side problem

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and the left side&nbsp;problem is affecting even this area.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.600
And the left side problem, you can feel it very clearly

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.200
that your left side becomes heavy

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.160
and you feel the heat in all your&nbsp;centers.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.960
So, you start feeling the atmosphere,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.520
the country, the&nbsp;people and individual and yourself.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.320
So, you know the problem of a particular place.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.920
I&nbsp;mean you may not feel that much, in the beginning,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.800
you may just feel yourself to begin with.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.440
Then you start feeling others.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.160
So, thus the awareness grows more and more.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.160
In the central nervous system, you start feeling the problems of other people,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.280
your own problems.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.760
But it is not that you feel them as something, which is painful or troublesome,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.840
but you feel them as little heat

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.560
or sometimes little pain, very little,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.720
as&nbsp;if you are recording it like a barometer.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.720
And when that happens you want to get rid of it,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.120
as if they are your own problem,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.320
and if you know how to get rid of it, you can do it.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.600
That’s what I was doing and that’s how I’m late,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.320
something on the collective.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.600
If you&nbsp;are working on something you want to finish the job

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.240
and then you want to attend to another.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.800
Don’t want to leave something half done.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.920
For human beings, it is difficult in the beginning,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.520
because from human awareness you are rising to super humaness

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.160
or you can call it to super awareness,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.800
into a subtler awareness.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:17.000
So, first the awareness&nbsp;is gross and then your awareness becomes subtler.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.520
But with that, you do not fell in&nbsp;any way uncomfortable

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.840
or upset,&nbsp;because you become extremely&nbsp;powerful.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.280
Such power of compassion,&nbsp;&nbsp;that you don’t feel anything,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.600
no pain, no&nbsp;problems, the illusions disappear completely.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.400
There’s no more illusion in the mind.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:57.360
Like, people say that when you face something you are filled with the greed,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.520
or&nbsp;greed or lust.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.880
But when your eyes become pure, there is no greed or lust.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.040
But what happens, that you start feeling the oneness

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.920
with another thing, whatever it is,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.920
in a way&nbsp;that it is joy giving.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.480
Like, you see someone, an attractive person,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.680
there is no sensation&nbsp;of baser feelings for that person.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.000
But the sensation just disappears

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.400
and you start feeling the joy

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.520
of the creation of that person or the thing.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.120
Like in Mexico, people have made so many things with hand.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.000
If you watch them, you might think,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.600
"How much it will cost? what will be the price? Who has made it?"

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.240
But if there is no thought, then you see something,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.960
which looks very&nbsp;joyous,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.320
because you can feel the vibrations.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.400
And you know somebody has made it, who might have been a Realized soul,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.480
who might have been a very great devotee of God,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:37.440
might have been a person who must have thought that, “This is your creation, oh God.”

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.600
Such a person might have made, with that&nbsp;feeling

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:48.040
which is to be gratified, and you feel&nbsp;that, "We should take it".

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.120
The matter has only one&nbsp;capacity

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.560
that it gives joy in giving to others,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.760
so that you can express your happiness into it.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.520
So, you become very subtly aware of the matter,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.760
that you start understanding the matter, what it means

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.560
and what is the use of a particular thing.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.120
In the same way, when you meet people,

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.200
new people, absolutely never known,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.720
you know what are their needs,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.000
what&nbsp;problems they have,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.680
on a wider scale, on a collective scale,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.800
and also you know one&nbsp;simple thing

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.680
that there are people in Mexico,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.080
who are seeking God, who are to be helped,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.440
who are to be given something that they want.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.960
They may not be so much aware of it.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.080
But we become aware of them.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.400
And a kind of a rapport of a very subtle type is established

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:05.320
and you get attracted towards other people not through any lust or greed or any purpose

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:13.040
but in oneness with the joy that they have within themselves,

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.320
the joy of the Spirit.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:27.160
You look at them and you feel, “This person is such a wonderful person”.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:34.160
How do you know? You start feeling the cool vibrations in your hand from that person.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.080
And you just enjoy that person for that person’s sake,

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.840
not for anything, whether poor, rich,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.400
good looking, bad looking, doesn’t matter.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.360
You approach the Spirit of another person because you have become the Spirit.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.920
People talk of big things, of organizing peace missions,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.920
this mission, that mission, to create a better relationship.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.760
All relationships,&nbsp;which are at a gross level create problems,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:13.000
because there is some sort of a lurking selfishness behind it.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:19.873
But once it becomes the spiritual
relationship you just enjoy the other person

00:08:19.953 --> 00:08:25.480
without getting into any discussion about what is your gain,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:35.360
what is you are going to achieve
through going nearer to that personality.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.914
Thus you become the receiver of the&nbsp;joy.
