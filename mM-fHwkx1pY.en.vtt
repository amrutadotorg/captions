Shri Virata Viratangana Puja. Los Angeles (USA), 10 October 1993

00:01.160 --> 00:07.800
Today, we are going to celebrate

00:07.920 --> 00:12.720
the puja of Virata and Viratangana.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.000
North America and South America,

00:25.120 --> 00:37.040
as you know is the Shri Krishna’s center of Vishuddhi.

00:39.480 --> 00:45.480
And it is very important to know also

00:45.600 --> 00:49.440
that all the communications,

00:49.560 --> 00:54.720
all the relationships with the whole creation

00:54.840 --> 01:00.160
has to be established through this center of Vishuddhi.

01:00.280 --> 01:06.000
Vishuddhi, as you know is the most important center

01:06.120 --> 01:08.920
in your ascent, in a way.

01:10.800 --> 01:17.040
Because Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for your ascent

01:17.160 --> 01:20.560
but for the ascent of the whole world,

01:20.680 --> 01:25.840
and only through Vishuddhi you can achieve it.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.240
Even if you get your self-realization

01:29.360 --> 01:38.800
and you get all the powers,

01:38.920 --> 01:44.080
unless and until you use your Vishuddhi, it won’t work out.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.720
Look at my Vishuddhi also,

01:45.840 --> 01:50.000
talking, talking everywhere, keeping communications,

01:50.120 --> 01:52.400
Vishuddhi goes out!

01:56.160 --> 02:02.840
Also, this Vishuddhi chakra being so important,

02:02.960 --> 02:06.840
it is under attack.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.920
Attack of the negative force.

02:17.360 --> 02:23.520
Today we are going to worship Virata and Viratangana.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.960
Virat is the ultimate,

02:28.080 --> 02:32.960
the complete development of the Vishuddhi chakra is Virata.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.680
And as you know the chakra is here

02:37.720 --> 02:39.880
here at this point.

02:40.840 --> 02:46.400
If this chakra is not alright, you are not collective.

02:46.520 --> 02:50.840
You behave in a manner that is not collective.

02:50.960 --> 02:57.960
You cannot communicate with other Sahaja yogis.

02:58.080 --> 03:06.520
You cannot be friendly, loving and one with other Sahaja yogis

03:07.480 --> 03:13.120
unless and until this center here,
Vishuddhi is alright.

03:13.240 --> 03:16.400
And it is part of Ekadesha.

03:16.520 --> 03:21.280
Vishuddhi is the center of the Ekadesha Rudra.

03:25.920 --> 03:36.760
So one has to understand that Virata Shakti is spread all over.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.320
We have communications.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.280
Mean I could telephone from here to anyone

03:44.400 --> 03:46.840
and they told me they don’t charge much.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.520
You see is something also from Shri Krishna’s blessing, I think.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.920
Because you telephone from anywhere else it is very difficult,

03:55.040 --> 03:57.560
and very expensive.

03:57.680 --> 04:04.280
Also, most of the communications vehicles

04:04.400 --> 04:11.880
like computer, like television, other things also,

04:12.000 --> 04:16.960
all those so many of them were developed in this country.

04:19.160 --> 04:23.720
So it is the subtle of that Ether

04:25.000 --> 04:30.440
which communicates us to other worlds.

04:31.920 --> 04:36.520
That is one power of Virata.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.080
That he is the subtle of that.

04:45.040 --> 04:48.360
The second power which we have

04:48.480 --> 04:53.680
of Viratangana we can say because Virat is

04:53.800 --> 04:59.720
the kinetic force of but the source is Viratangana,

05:01.560 --> 05:10.760
is everything that brain can do.

05:13.040 --> 05:26.960
All thinking, all creativity, all compassion,

05:31.160 --> 05:39.200
all kinds of looking after other nations.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.400
The other day somebody asked,

05:41.520 --> 05:44.200
“Why should we be policemen of the whole world?”

05:44.320 --> 05:46.880
You jolly well have to be,

05:47.880 --> 05:51.440
because, you are Viratas.

05:51.560 --> 05:56.800
So you have to look after the law and order of the whole world.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.000
You have to look after

05:59.120 --> 06:04.040
all the people who are suffering in this world.

06:04.160 --> 06:08.080
You have to look after all the suppressions

06:08.200 --> 06:13.840
and the wars and the civil wars everywhere,

06:13.960 --> 06:16.640
is all your headache,

06:17.760 --> 06:22.320
because you are sitting in the land of Virat.

06:23.320 --> 06:27.520
So He’s the Father.

06:28.560 --> 06:33.840
He’s what you call Jehovah.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.240
He’s Akhbar.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.440
So on the brain level

06:45.400 --> 06:52.040
when Kundalini reaches and enlightens your brain

06:52.160 --> 06:56.640
then this science that you know

06:57.920 --> 07:07.000
becomes logical not only that but you know meta science

07:08.200 --> 07:13.680
because the brain which was just knowing science

07:13.800 --> 07:16.920
now knows the source of science.

07:17.960 --> 07:22.560
The whole thing it can see, clearly.

07:24.400 --> 07:29.320
Like you climb up a hill or a mountain,

07:29.680 --> 07:37.520
the higher you go you can see the whole vision of the place.

07:37.880 --> 07:44.440
In the same way whatever is created out of your brain, anything,

07:46.440 --> 07:50.680
you start getting the whole vision of it what they have created.

07:50.800 --> 07:55.960
Not only that but you also see what has created that.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.840
Now they created United Nations.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.920
It had to be here, Why?

08:01.040 --> 08:03.520
Why in America?

08:04.320 --> 08:11.360
Why is America so much worried about United nations?

08:12.280 --> 08:17.560
What is its responsibility?

08:17.960 --> 08:19.520
No country will do that.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.480
It’s a headache.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.800
But they’ll go to Vietnam,

08:23.920 --> 08:25.720
they’ll go to Korea.

08:25.840 --> 08:27.571
Now they are busy with Bosnia.

08:27.692 --> 08:30.932
Everywhere, Somalia.

08:32.040 --> 08:35.200
It’s your responsibility

08:35.320 --> 08:40.000
because all these things are created by your brain.

08:40.120 --> 08:44.200
The human brain has created different nations.

08:45.360 --> 08:50.440
So above all we realize that all these nations

08:50.560 --> 08:52.720
belong to one world.

08:53.480 --> 08:58.120
Once you rise above you see that this was created by us,

08:58.240 --> 09:03.600
by our own thinking, by our own projections we have created.

09:05.960 --> 09:15.720
So when you go above this you start thinking of one world,

09:15.840 --> 09:19.400
because you see that it was one world.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.400
It is one world.

09:22.720 --> 09:28.520
You start seeing God has created beautiful rivers

09:29.200 --> 09:35.680
and beautiful mountains, He never divided.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.440
I mean He wanted to create beauty for you.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.240
But then we started thinking

09:41.360 --> 09:45.520
“This is my land, that is my land.”

09:45.640 --> 09:49.600
Most of the Americans have come from outside,

09:49.720 --> 09:52.400
and the real land owners I don’t know where are they hiding.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.320
I seldom see them.

09:56.360 --> 10:00.040
Now the responsibility is coming in their heads

10:00.160 --> 10:03.600
that we have taken this land

10:04.640 --> 10:11.760
and we feel that this is our land

10:11.880 --> 10:15.280
but it belongs to the whole world.

10:15.400 --> 10:19.200
Whatever they have done now is coming back.

10:19.320 --> 10:22.200
Once you rise higher you start seeing the vision.

10:22.320 --> 10:27.120
Whatever you have done through your mental projections.

10:27.240 --> 10:30.880
People don’t even realize in many countries

10:31.000 --> 10:33.720
that this is one world.

10:35.960 --> 10:42.560
Mental projection is on another level

10:42.680 --> 10:49.000
is that you have created a materialistic world.

10:49.120 --> 10:53.120
With this materialistic world

10:53.240 --> 10:58.800
you have reduced everything to the level of money.

10:58.920 --> 11:03.520
Religion is money, everything is money.

11:04.520 --> 11:09.840
Nobody has any respect for anything but for money.

11:11.880 --> 11:17.320
And then material things.

11:17.720 --> 11:25.280
One starts seeing matter as a source of wealth

11:25.760 --> 11:29.320
and source of dignity

11:30.320 --> 11:38.160
and a source of great positions, powers.

11:41.280 --> 11:48.000
But when you rise higher into Virata’s power

11:48.560 --> 11:52.440
you see the stupidity of materialism.

11:54.520 --> 11:57.520
What is matter after all?

11:59.160 --> 12:05.240
Matter is for making the place beautiful,

12:06.480 --> 12:09.040
giving you joy,

12:10.960 --> 12:19.160
and this matter is also for expression of your joy to others.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.800
When you give them some present,

12:21.920 --> 12:25.600
some material thing beautifully made.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.320
Then you start thinking also

12:28.440 --> 12:34.160
how God has created this beautiful world

12:34.280 --> 12:42.720
and you start creating beautiful things

12:42.840 --> 12:52.880
in art, in music, drama, even films, everything.

12:54.880 --> 13:01.600
But at the material level and at the mental level

13:01.720 --> 13:05.480
the projection is linear; it moves like this.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.480
As a result, it falls down.

13:08.960 --> 13:15.040
So everything, the standard of our expression has fallen down.

13:15.160 --> 13:20.320
I know films in the twenties and thirties and forties

13:20.440 --> 13:22.240
from the same Hollywood

13:22.360 --> 13:25.360
were very different from what they are today.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.600
You can’t even see some of them.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.720
Then in the same mental projection

13:33.840 --> 13:39.080
we see the dramas and the novels and the art,

13:39.240 --> 13:44.120
everything has come down, is deteriorated,

13:44.240 --> 13:51.240
is not at all joy giving but it is destructive.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.960
It is destroying itself, first of all,

13:55.080 --> 13:57.480
and so it is destructive.

13:57.600 --> 14:01.520
As a result, we are moving our mind

14:01.640 --> 14:04.680
and moving on that decline also

14:04.800 --> 14:09.560
and we also take to things which are destructive.

14:09.680 --> 14:14.000
Our standards in everything have gone down.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.680
Morality also is an innate blessing to human beings

14:17.800 --> 14:24.560
but he starts putting it on a mental level.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.400
When you put it on the mental level

14:29.520 --> 14:33.360
people like Freud become Christ,

14:33.480 --> 14:35.720
and you start following them

14:35.840 --> 14:40.480
and you become nothing but a sex point.

14:40.720 --> 14:47.960
In every direction if you see there’s a big decline

14:50.520 --> 14:53.920
and you get upset, you don’t understand,

14:54.040 --> 14:57.520
how there is such a decline in human nature,

14:57.640 --> 15:01.840
how there is a decline in art, decline under treasure,

15:01.960 --> 15:04.240
decline on human relationships,

15:04.360 --> 15:08.360
in everywhere you find this decline.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.120
With money of course, certain things

15:12.240 --> 15:16.680
may appear to be smart, fast, like tennis you can say.

15:16.800 --> 15:21.640
People used to play tennis for joy, never for money.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.440
But now they play for money and

15:24.560 --> 15:28.360
after four, five days we find he has gone down,

15:28.480 --> 15:32.040
or four, five years he is finished.

15:34.040 --> 15:41.680
So the speed has come also into sports because of money.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.560
This money has been like a big load

15:45.680 --> 15:55.680
has brought down all the beautiful things in its own level.

15:55.800 --> 16:00.360
They are not the same level at which they are created.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.560
If it was on the same level,

16:02.680 --> 16:06.880
Sahaja Yoga would have worked very nicely in America.

16:07.000 --> 16:13.000
But it did not, because here is the maximum load

16:13.680 --> 16:20.560
on all our creations of our mind of our mental projections.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.920
Whatever direction you will see

16:23.040 --> 16:27.520
you will find there is such a decline.

16:27.640 --> 16:32.960
We know of lawyers who would be so honest

16:33.080 --> 16:37.840
and who would work out something

16:37.960 --> 16:40.720
for the person for whom they are fighting.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.720
But today you can bribe the lawyers.

16:43.840 --> 16:52.480
We know the doctors which would go all out to cure patients,

16:52.920 --> 16:57.480
they have lost their sense of ethics.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.200
Everybody has lost the sense of ethics.

17:01.320 --> 17:10.400
First is this materialism, money and above all I think

17:11.520 --> 17:17.080
at this time there is a big growth of people

17:17.200 --> 17:20.880
because this is a resurrection time.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.320
And many types of people are born.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.840
Thousands and thousands of them are born

17:27.960 --> 17:31.280
who might be like animals or maybe

17:31.400 --> 17:37.920
some sort of absolutely idiotic type

17:38.040 --> 17:41.720
or maybe some stupid stuff.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.880
At this time, we have to do resurrection work,

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
means what, that our Virata Shakti

17:49.120 --> 17:54.040
has to be enlightened in our brain.

18:06.920 --> 18:12.480
So in Sahaja Yoga when you rise into Virata Shakti

18:12.600 --> 18:19.320
you go up and see all these declines,

18:19.440 --> 18:26.240
all these falling mental projections, from that height.

18:26.360 --> 18:29.520
And also you see yourself.

18:29.640 --> 18:35.840
That you had gone into all these nonsensical things,

18:35.960 --> 18:39.120
but now you feel that you have come out of it

18:39.240 --> 18:43.200
and now you have become like a lotus.

18:43.320 --> 18:46.120
Especially the ego part.

18:46.240 --> 18:52.840
Ego is extremely strong in modern times. It was never so.

18:54.720 --> 19:03.960
It is, I think the birth of many fighting cocks

19:04.080 --> 19:09.240
has come on this earth and also

19:09.360 --> 19:14.720
some of the jungle creatures are also reborn.

19:14.840 --> 19:16.720
Because you can’t talk to them.

19:16.840 --> 19:19.280
If you say anything they just jump on you.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.040
You cannot criticize them,

19:21.160 --> 19:23.160
you cannot tell them what’s wrong with you,

19:23.280 --> 19:24.680
they’ll just sit on your head,

19:24.800 --> 19:27.120
if you say anything they’ll start hitting you.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.040
They never want to see what’s wrong with them.

19:31.160 --> 19:36.560
It’s impossible to communicate to them because of their ego

19:36.680 --> 19:42.920
and this ego has come because of certain

19:43.040 --> 19:46.880
declining nature of the modern time.

19:48.400 --> 19:52.600
For example, from childhood

19:52.720 --> 19:59.320
a mother starts scolding her child for spoiling her carpet.

19:59.440 --> 20:02.920
So carpet becomes more important.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.680
So the next day the child gets very angry,

20:05.800 --> 20:09.720
he gets the scissors and cuts the carpet

20:09.840 --> 20:11.760
to punish the mother.

20:13.880 --> 20:21.200
Then they see that the child wants money for something

20:22.640 --> 20:24.040
and they ask him for what.

20:24.160 --> 20:27.080
“Because I have seen in the television that

20:27.200 --> 20:31.200
there is a bear which has a birth date.”

20:31.320 --> 20:36.200
So a new type of devils have come up they are entrepreneurs

20:36.320 --> 20:39.040
and through their mental projections

20:39.160 --> 20:42.200
they take out novel ideas,

20:42.320 --> 20:45.960
see like a teddy bear which has a birth date,

20:46.080 --> 20:49.560
can you imagine, such a stupid idea.

20:49.680 --> 20:53.080
And all the children wanting to buy that.

20:53.200 --> 20:57.560
Now if one child buys another must have it.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.640
All kinds of things these entrepreneurs do.

21:00.760 --> 21:04.600
And people start becoming slaves of them.

21:04.720 --> 21:09.600
Like in Paris they started a fashion

21:09.720 --> 21:13.840
that you’ll have six inches of skirts.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.200
So all other skirts were thrown away.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.600
The six inches skirts started.

21:18.720 --> 21:22.160
Imagine in that cold, they would wear socks

21:22.280 --> 21:26.360
and six inches of skirts. Everybody looks the same.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.960
What is so beautiful about it.

21:29.080 --> 21:33.360
Whatever they want the entrepreneurs so called,

21:34.080 --> 21:40.280
they are called as artists, also as designers,

21:40.400 --> 21:45.840
but their designs are just to kill your freedom,

21:45.960 --> 21:49.360
just to make you a slave.

21:49.480 --> 21:55.080
And all kinds of monkey tricks they play, which you accept.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.960
Once you start accepting those monkey tricks,

21:59.080 --> 22:06.960
then you don’t also realize that how you have become a slave

22:08.440 --> 22:11.320
and there is no individuality about it.

22:11.440 --> 22:17.480
Hairstyle they will start particular hair style.

22:17.600 --> 22:21.320
So everybody goes about with the same hairstyle.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.440
Or you go to a hairdresser.

23:33.480 --> 23:40.560
So when you rise into your Virata Shakti

23:40.800 --> 23:44.360
by the enlightenment of the Kundalini,

23:45.200 --> 23:51.840
the Viratangana is the power which gives you

23:52.240 --> 23:59.240
a complete vision of the decline

23:59.360 --> 24:05.600
into which every mental projection

24:05.720 --> 24:13.440
which was idealistic, beautiful has fallen.

24:14.600 --> 24:22.600
For example, Abraham Lincoln gave a very great idealistic idea

24:23.160 --> 24:28.800
about the a state, about democracy.

24:28.920 --> 24:33.800
But now many people say that it is demonocracy.

24:34.520 --> 24:38.600
Those people who were in Russia, of course they were wrong,

24:38.720 --> 24:41.680
but still they had an argument

24:41.800 --> 24:45.120
that we don’t want to become democratic

24:45.240 --> 24:51.040
because look at America.

24:51.160 --> 24:56.520
Nothing is safe, nothing is normal,

24:58.320 --> 25:01.240
so what’s the use of becoming democratic country.

25:01.360 --> 25:07.600
Can you hear me there, it's all right! it's all right.

25:12.600 --> 25:16.520
After all we are on a picnic, you see.

25:21.440 --> 25:24.480
And we cannot have any problems

25:24.600 --> 25:29.240
because I told him whatever is here is here,

25:29.360 --> 25:32.280
and whatever is not, is not here.

25:32.400 --> 25:36.480
So if you have any problem, we can’t help it.

25:44.720 --> 25:49.160
So you rise to that level, gradually, gradually,

25:49.280 --> 25:52.800
first, I don’t know what you see.

25:54.400 --> 26:00.280
But you start seeing what’s wrong with your society,

26:00.400 --> 26:07.480
what’s wrong with your relationships.

26:07.600 --> 26:12.680
Ultimately, you start seeing what’s wrong with you,

26:13.800 --> 26:16.120
how you are wrong.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.920
That I would say is the higher state

26:21.040 --> 26:23.520
where you reach and you start seeing

26:23.640 --> 26:26.240
"This is wrong with me".

26:28.360 --> 26:36.760
After that you start understanding

26:38.920 --> 26:44.680
that you have got powers, Viratangana’s powers.

26:46.160 --> 26:49.640
You have got powers.

26:49.760 --> 26:54.280
In your brain itself, you have got powers.

27:03.440 --> 27:09.280
By which you understand the Meta Science,

27:09.400 --> 27:15.520
science above science, the meta art.

27:15.640 --> 27:21.720
The vulgarity of art. Discrimination starts working,

27:21.840 --> 27:27.080
you start understanding what is really art, what is not.

27:28.640 --> 27:32.160
You start enjoying that art.

27:33.520 --> 27:38.360
And the enjoyment of Nirananda,

27:39.040 --> 27:45.280
you get it when you rise above and see

27:45.400 --> 27:49.240
the whole thing in a different perspective.

27:50.040 --> 27:57.400
First of all, you see it as a drama, as a witness.

27:59.960 --> 28:02.240
And you laugh, you see.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.920
I was telling a joke about a lady who was interviewed

28:08.040 --> 28:12.720
for doing some art with the mehndi on the hand.

28:12.840 --> 28:15.720
She’s an Indian lady from India.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.480
So the interviewer asked her,

28:18.600 --> 28:23.920
“What about the foreigners, how do they react,

28:24.040 --> 28:26.440
the Americans, how do they react?

28:26.560 --> 28:31.280
She said that they ask very funny questions.

28:31.400 --> 28:35.240
Funny questions? Yes, they ask me, “What is this?”

28:35.360 --> 28:40.120
So I said, “This is my Suhaag,

28:40.240 --> 28:47.440
my husband’s symbol, that's what I wear.”

28:48.600 --> 28:52.640
So they said, what about extras?

28:52.760 --> 28:57.080
“You didn’t follow?”- What about the extra husbands if you have?

29:00.120 --> 29:04.320
Now you all are laughing at it, you all Americas are laughing,

29:04.440 --> 29:06.800
but at that time point you would not have laughed,

29:06.920 --> 29:09.000
because very common.

29:12.720 --> 29:16.160
In the same way, everyone,

29:16.280 --> 29:21.440
even India or any place where they do absurd things

29:21.560 --> 29:28.880
it becomes very obvious and you start seeing it very clearly,

29:29.840 --> 29:35.960
very very clearly that what are we doing, it’s all absurd.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.320
But this is not only on mental level.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.320
This is what I am going to tell you.

29:43.440 --> 29:46.640
It is not just you see the vision,

29:46.760 --> 29:49.440
all right, still mental level,

29:50.080 --> 29:54.360
then you understand it is wrong, still mental level.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.600
But you just don’t do it.

29:59.160 --> 30:04.680
You become part and parcel of Virata.

30:06.640 --> 30:12.360
When you become part and parcel of Virata then

30:15.072 --> 30:19.632
you don’t have to even think, you just see it, and you laugh.

30:19.760 --> 30:23.000
You just see and you know it is wrong.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.360
It is all absurdity.

30:31.520 --> 30:36.560
We went to see one temple in India

30:37.400 --> 30:42.160
and there were some pujaris, doing puja.

30:42.280 --> 30:45.720
So the Indian Sahaja Yogis ran out.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.480
I said, “What happened?”

30:47.600 --> 30:51.560
“Mother, they are all hypocrites, they have horrible vibrations,

30:51.680 --> 30:53.560
how can they do puja,

30:53.680 --> 30:56.600
they have horrible vibrations, all bhoots.

31:00.240 --> 31:06.760
That’s how we become so powerful,

31:08.720 --> 31:11.480
I would not say you are like a light,

31:11.600 --> 31:15.400
because light doesn’t see the light does it?

31:16.800 --> 31:22.880
But you see, you are light and you see light.

31:26.280 --> 31:32.480
And the third thing that happens to you with this Viratangana

31:32.600 --> 31:39.360
that you humble down. You humble down.

31:41.160 --> 31:46.640
You become extremely sweet, obedient,

31:46.760 --> 31:49.280
just like children.

31:50.840 --> 31:54.760
And you don’t mind anything, anything you don’t mind.

31:56.680 --> 32:05.000
That is the state you achieve not as a slave,

32:05.120 --> 32:13.600
not out of domination, but it just works in you,

32:15.240 --> 32:22.440
it penetrates into your brain, you become that.

32:23.040 --> 32:27.000
I’ve seen people who are horrid absolutely,

32:27.120 --> 32:31.040
and after some time you can’t even recognize them.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.000
How do they change?

32:36.320 --> 32:39.320
How do they get the change?

32:39.760 --> 32:42.480
What happens to them?

32:42.600 --> 32:48.640
Is the brain is enlightened, has become the light

32:48.760 --> 32:51.640
and you know you have the light.

32:51.760 --> 32:55.000
That is doubtless awareness.

32:55.120 --> 32:58.000
You should have no doubts about yourself,

32:58.120 --> 33:01.040
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.000
Some people falsely have.

33:04.640 --> 33:06.840
They are bhoots but they say no we are Sahaja Yogis.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.480
That’s not the thing.

33:11.480 --> 33:16.720
The discretion power becomes so beautiful

33:16.840 --> 33:20.320
of the Hamsa Chakra, because they are all connected,

33:20.440 --> 33:23.840
the Vishuddhi, Hamsa and Virata.

33:23.960 --> 33:28.560
They are all connected centers.

33:28.680 --> 33:32.440
It is not only that the Virata improves,

33:32.560 --> 33:36.760
but the Vishuddhi improves and Hamsa.

33:38.120 --> 33:43.520
So now what happens that you jump into collectivity.

33:43.640 --> 33:48.680
Collectivity is the blessing of Viratangana.

33:50.400 --> 33:57.720
She teaches you how to love each other.

33:58.680 --> 34:03.800
She teaches you how to enjoy other Sahaja Yogis.

34:05.080 --> 34:12.520
She teaches you how to have bhakti in your heart.

34:15.160 --> 34:21.360
But that teaching is like innate.

34:22.000 --> 34:25.640
If I say She teaches, means you are the disciple

34:25.760 --> 34:27.800
and She is the teacher, No, No.

34:27.920 --> 34:32.160
You become Viratangana yourself.

34:32.280 --> 34:38.040
And the love and the affection and the understanding

34:38.160 --> 34:42.720
that you have for each other is remarkable,

34:42.840 --> 34:46.840
is very enjoyable and very beautiful.

34:47.720 --> 34:50.040
So all that happens,

34:50.160 --> 34:54.240
absolutely happens in your brain.

34:54.360 --> 34:59.480
That’s how your brain, which is

35:00.400 --> 35:04.840
the one which receives all the information

35:04.960 --> 35:08.680
and creates all the information,

35:08.800 --> 35:12.520
creates all the mental projections

35:12.640 --> 35:18.440
becomes a new vehicle to create a dimension

35:18.560 --> 35:22.080
which goes higher, not declining.

35:24.320 --> 35:28.200
All of you are part and parcel of that, all of you

35:28.320 --> 35:33.440
are part and parcel of that and all of you are important.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.160
All of you have to support that,

35:36.280 --> 35:38.600
all of you have to raise it.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.240
It is very important;

35:40.360 --> 35:48.120
you all should understand your own responsibility.

35:48.240 --> 35:53.760
So between South and North America

35:53.880 --> 36:00.280
we have to at least have 16,000 Sahaja Yogis.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.240
Krishna was very clever,

36:10.360 --> 36:14.560
He created his 16,000 powers into ladies.

36:15.720 --> 36:19.960
Then these 16,000 women were taken away

36:20.080 --> 36:25.320
by one king and he just kept them.

36:25.440 --> 36:30.840
So Shri Krishna went and defeated that king

36:30.960 --> 36:37.440
and brought all the 16,000 powers to himself, very nice.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.760
He could do all those tricks, not Me.

36:40.880 --> 36:46.560
I have to have 16,000 children who are human beings

36:46.680 --> 36:50.600
and who get this power within them.

36:50.720 --> 36:56.240
Not like my own powers I manifest. What is the use?

36:56.360 --> 36:58.600
You can’t give realization to others,

36:58.720 --> 37:02.600
you cannot communicate towards others, you cannot do anything with them.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.040
So Shri Krishna only told Gita, finished.

37:07.160 --> 37:12.280
They were clever people, they didn’t want to face the problem.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.480
It’s very difficult.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.200
You people have a bad Vishuddhi, I get it.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.160
You people have a problem, I get it.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.920
It's just collectively to work out.

37:25.040 --> 37:29.360
To take you inside my body as a cell

37:29.480 --> 37:34.680
and to cleanse it, it’s very very difficult task

37:34.800 --> 37:37.160
but one has to do it.

37:37.720 --> 37:41.920
One has to do it and one will do it.

37:42.040 --> 37:46.760
I’m sure one day when you all will be

37:46.880 --> 37:52.600
completely aware of Viratangana power within yourself,

37:52.720 --> 37:56.720
I don’t know what will happen to this country.

37:56.840 --> 38:01.720
As it is I find it is just bubbling now, about to break.

38:01.840 --> 38:05.800
It’s a big breakthrough I find this year,

38:06.480 --> 38:13.640
among Sahaja Yogis as well as among the other people.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.440
But there was another quality of Shri Krishna

38:17.560 --> 38:22.520
was diplomacy, is to be diplomatic.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.320
With others you have to be diplomatic.

38:25.440 --> 38:29.560
You should not just jump on them and try to oppress them,

38:29.680 --> 38:31.680
or in any way try to show

38:31.800 --> 38:33.640
that they are nowhere compared to you, No.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.520
You should say that we were like you, worse than you.

38:36.640 --> 38:40.840
Then people are happy. But see now we have changed.

38:40.960 --> 38:45.040
Somebody says that “I was smuggling drugs

38:45.160 --> 38:49.600
you should say no I was smuggling even arms”.

38:53.120 --> 38:56.560
Then their ego will not be hurt,

38:56.680 --> 38:59.200
if their ego is not hurt then it’s easy.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.240
So diplomacy also you must learn.

39:02.360 --> 39:06.400
Also Diplomacy is a mental projection at a lower level.

39:06.520 --> 39:15.280
At a higher level diplomacy is where is your charisma,

39:15.400 --> 39:19.800
where you attract people, where you capture them.

39:19.920 --> 39:24.000
How you talk to them, how you behave towards them.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.280
And also have a compassion, because

39:27.400 --> 39:29.400
you are now sitting on the Himalayas,

39:29.520 --> 39:31.640
but what about these poor people.

39:31.760 --> 39:35.480
In that way if you see the whole thing I am sure

39:35.600 --> 39:39.880
you will not feel so much

39:40.000 --> 39:44.440
that you are doing this work and that work.

39:47.160 --> 39:52.040
Shri Krishna’s whole philosophy is like this.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.840
That you should get your “Ghyana”.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.600
Ghyana is Ghy means Gnostics,

39:58.720 --> 40:01.480
you have to become Gnostics means

40:01.600 --> 40:03.520
on your central nervous system

40:03.640 --> 40:06.200
you must know it. That’s the first thing.

40:06.320 --> 40:11.120
The second thing was because Arjuna was so half-hearted,

40:11.240 --> 40:14.640
still he asked him questions.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.800
So he said,

40:30.520 --> 40:35.800
“What about Karma? Everybody talks of Karma.”

40:35.920 --> 40:38.560
Again diplomacy.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.960
The whole Gita is full of diplomacy

40:42.080 --> 40:45.400
and normal human beings can’t understand.

40:45.520 --> 40:51.760
So he said, “Yes of course, you must do your Karmas,

40:51.880 --> 40:58.200
but you have to surrender your karmas at My Lotus Feet.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.800
No not possible.

41:01.560 --> 41:06.720
Very clever because as long as you have

41:06.840 --> 41:10.720
“I am doing this, I am doing that” idea,

41:10.840 --> 41:15.480
how can you put your karmas onto the feet of Shri Krishna.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.160
That means you should get your realization

41:19.280 --> 41:22.480
where you know you that you are not doing anything.

41:22.600 --> 41:25.600
When that happens that you know you are not doing anything,

41:25.720 --> 41:31.600
at that time the Karma becomes Akarma.

41:32.920 --> 41:36.160
And how you talk, I’ve seen people raising Kundalini

41:36.280 --> 41:38.840
saying, “Mother, it doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.760
You don’t say that, “I am doing it.”

41:41.880 --> 41:45.120
You just say, “It doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work out.”

41:45.240 --> 41:49.840
in the third person. Another is about Bhakti,

41:49.960 --> 41:56.320
because now we have lots of these Hare Ram’s, Hare Krishna’s

41:56.440 --> 41:58.520
spoiling their Vishuddhi.

41:59.720 --> 42:04.480
So for Bhakti He has used only one word.

42:04.600 --> 42:10.600
He says, “You give me flowers, you give me water,

42:10.720 --> 42:13.840
you give me leaves, I’ll take them.”

42:13.960 --> 42:16.560
But while giving what does He say?

42:16.680 --> 42:20.040
“But you must do “Ananya Bhakti”.

42:20.160 --> 42:23.600
“Ananya” means when there is not the other,

42:23.720 --> 42:27.600
when you become one with Me, when you are connected.

42:27.720 --> 42:30.680
On “Ananya” word he has danced

42:30.800 --> 42:33.520
the whole thing and these stupid people don’t know

42:33.640 --> 42:37.080
that they are not connected as yet and they are talking

42:37.200 --> 42:41.880
about Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Hare Rama.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.160
That’s how they are not connected.

42:44.280 --> 42:47.120
They don’t understand that they have to be connected.

42:47.240 --> 42:51.840
And this is the trick he has played with all the people

42:51.960 --> 42:53.480
that “All right, all right

42:53.600 --> 42:58.480
you go on saying Hare Rama, Hare Rama we’ll see.”

42:59.520 --> 43:05.040
So the diplomacy part in his case because

43:05.160 --> 43:10.560
He had to bring them to the point that

43:10.680 --> 43:14.080
No, No, this doesn’t work out, No this doesn’t work out.

43:14.200 --> 43:17.880
So then “Gyana. Now what is Gyana is they start reading books,

43:18.000 --> 43:23.800
No, No. It means 'bodh', means on your central nervous system

43:23.920 --> 43:28.680
you have to do. So how gradually he brought them to that level.

43:28.800 --> 43:31.760
In the same way when you are dealing with others

43:31.880 --> 43:34.560
you have to work it out that way.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.800
And once you work it out that way,

43:37.920 --> 43:40.880
you can spread Sahaja Yoga much faster.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.160
You’ll be a very light person,

43:43.280 --> 43:45.360
everybody will enjoy you

43:45.480 --> 43:48.800
and you’ll have no temper, nothing.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.800
We get into temper because

43:54.920 --> 43:57.680
we don’t know how to handle the situation.

43:57.800 --> 43:59.920
If we know how to handle the situation

44:00.040 --> 44:02.200
we’ll never get angry, on the contrary

44:02.320 --> 44:06.720
use the anger of another person for your own benefit.

44:07.640 --> 44:12.760
All these things you learn through the power of Viratangana.

44:12.880 --> 44:19.640
Viratangana gives you the full detachment

44:20.360 --> 44:24.680
from every subject of worry.

44:24.800 --> 44:31.480
She sucks in all this and throws them in the air.

44:33.680 --> 44:43.280
It is Her great power that has really given you

44:43.600 --> 44:48.080
such an understanding about life, about yourself.

44:48.200 --> 44:51.920
Your own value system has changed.

44:52.600 --> 44:57.800
If you see what a change it was for you,

44:57.920 --> 45:05.320
all this transformation, everything is the power of Viratangana.

45:05.440 --> 45:10.920
And ultimately what She gives you is “Nirananda”.

45:11.040 --> 45:20.440
Is the joy, joy and nothing else but joy.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.480
May God bless you.

45:48.673 --> 45:49.919
(Shri Mataji compliments Gregoire.)

45:50.040 --> 45:55.480
I must give full credit here to Gregoire

45:55.600 --> 46:02.320
because he came and struggled and fought and like Arjuna you see,

46:04.200 --> 46:09.040
he felt very desperate and went away.

46:09.160 --> 46:12.560
He had to go also in any way.

46:13.600 --> 46:16.720
And suddenly as he is gone,

46:16.840 --> 46:21.840
I find here is everything so sprouting, so well

46:21.960 --> 46:26.320
and people have started taking over the responsibility

46:26.440 --> 46:29.480
of working out Sahaja Yoga.

46:29.600 --> 46:33.520
But I still remember him at this time

46:33.640 --> 46:37.120
because he was really very desperate

46:37.240 --> 46:44.440
and absolutely fed up with the American style of thinking.

46:44.560 --> 46:47.760
But now we’ll give him a very good news

46:47.880 --> 46:53.480
that how America has improved.

47:04.960 --> 47:07.480
We have many Sahaja Yogis in America

47:07.600 --> 47:09.520
who have been very dedicated

47:09.640 --> 47:13.280
despite all kinds of negative forces and everything.

47:13.400 --> 47:16.400
With all the nightmares they have gone through,

47:16.520 --> 47:19.160
they are stuck on to Sahaja Yoga

47:19.280 --> 47:26.520
and I find that their efforts are now showing results.

47:29.640 --> 47:31.240
I will not take their names

47:31.360 --> 47:34.440
because you know all of them very well one by one.

47:34.560 --> 47:40.640
But I must say that Steven has done a great contribution.

47:40.760 --> 47:44.280
I never asked him to come to America.

47:44.400 --> 47:50.240
But he himself decided and he himself came here on his own

47:50.360 --> 47:56.800
and he has really contributed a lot to Sahaja Yoga by coming here.

47:56.920 --> 47:58.240
May God Bless You.

48:09.960 --> 48:13.560
Of course, your leader is there

48:13.680 --> 48:17.280
and all the leaders in every place

48:17.400 --> 48:20.760
have been really working very hard

48:20.880 --> 48:28.080
and I just see how things are prospered in one-year time.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.600
It's very creditable.

48:30.720 --> 48:34.040
We never had so many people for the Puja.

48:34.160 --> 48:39.360
I am quite surprised as all of you being here.

48:39.480 --> 48:40.880
Thank you very much.
