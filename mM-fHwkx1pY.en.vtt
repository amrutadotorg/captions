Shri Virata Viratangana Puja. Los Angeles (USA), 10 October 1993

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.800
Today, we are going to celebrate

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.720
the puja of Virata and Viratangana.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.000
North America and South America,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:37.040
as you know is the Shri Krishna’s center of Vishuddhi.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.480
And it is very important to know also

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.440
that all the communications,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.720
all the relationships with the whole creation

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.160
has to be established through this center of Vishuddhi.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.000
Vishuddhi, as you know is the most important center

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.920
in your ascent, in a way.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.040
Because Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for your ascent

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.560
but for the ascent of the whole world,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.840
and only through Vishuddhi you can achieve it.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.240
Even if you get your self-realization

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:38.800
and you get all the powers,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.080
unless and until you use your Vishuddhi, it won’t work out.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.720
Look at my Vishuddhi also,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.000
talking, talking everywhere, keeping communications,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.400
Vishuddhi goes out!

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.840
Also, this Vishuddhi chakra being so important,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.840
it is under attack.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.920
Attack of the negative force.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.520
Today we are going to worship Virata and Viratangana.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.960
Virat is the ultimate,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.960
the complete development of the Vishuddhi chakra is Virata.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.680
And as you know the chakra is here

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.880
here at this point.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.400
If this chakra is not alright, you are not collective.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.840
You behave in a manner that is not collective.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.960
You cannot communicate with other Sahaja yogis.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:06.520
You cannot be friendly, loving and one with other Sahaja yogis

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.120
unless and until this center here,
Vishuddhi is alright.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.400
And it is part of Ekadesha.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.280
Vishuddhi is the center of the Ekadesha Rudra.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:36.760
So one has to understand that Virata Shakti is spread all over.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.320
We have communications.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.280
Mean I could telephone from here to anyone

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.840
and they told me they don’t charge much.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.520
You see is something also from Shri Krishna’s blessing, I think.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.920
Because you telephone from anywhere else it is very difficult,

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.560
and very expensive.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.280
Also, most of the communications vehicles

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.880
like computer, like television, other things also,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.960
all those so many of them were developed in this country.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.720
So it is the subtle of that Ether

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.440
which communicates us to other worlds.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.520
That is one power of Virata.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.080
That he is the subtle of that.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.360
The second power which we have

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.680
of Viratangana we can say because Virat is

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.720
the kinetic force of but the source is Viratangana,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:10.760
is everything that brain can do.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:26.960
All thinking, all creativity, all compassion,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:39.200
all kinds of looking after other nations.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.400
The other day somebody asked,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.200
“Why should we be policemen of the whole world?”

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.880
You jolly well have to be,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.440
because, you are Viratas.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.800
So you have to look after the law and order of the whole world.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.000
You have to look after

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.040
all the people who are suffering in this world.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.080
You have to look after all the suppressions

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:13.840
and the wars and the civil wars everywhere,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.640
is all your headache,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.320
because you are sitting in the land of Virat.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.520
So He’s the Father.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.840
He’s what you call Jehovah.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.240
He’s Akhbar.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.440
So on the brain level

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:52.040
when Kundalini reaches and enlightens your brain

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.640
then this science that you know

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:07.000
becomes logical not only that but you know meta science

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.680
because the brain which was just knowing science

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.920
now knows the source of science.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.560
The whole thing it can see, clearly.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.320
Like you climb up a hill or a mountain,

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:37.520
the higher you go you can see the whole vision of the place.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:44.440
In the same way whatever is created out of your brain, anything,

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.680
you start getting the whole vision of it what they have created.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.960
Not only that but you also see what has created that.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.840
Now they created United Nations.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.920
It had to be here, Why?

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.520
Why in America?

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:11.360
Why is America so much worried about United nations?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.560
What is its responsibility?

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.520
No country will do that.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.480
It’s a headache.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.800
But they’ll go to Vietnam,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.720
they’ll go to Korea.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.571
Now they are busy with Bosnia.

00:08:27.692 --> 00:08:30.932
Everywhere, Somalia.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.200
It’s your responsibility

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:40.000
because all these things are created by your brain.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.200
The human brain has created different nations.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.440
So above all we realize that all these nations

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.720
belong to one world.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:58.120
Once you rise above you see that this was created by us,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.600
by our own thinking, by our own projections we have created.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:15.720
So when you go above this you start thinking of one world,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.400
because you see that it was one world.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.400
It is one world.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.520
You start seeing God has created beautiful rivers

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.680
and beautiful mountains, He never divided.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.440
I mean He wanted to create beauty for you.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.240
But then we started thinking

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.520
“This is my land, that is my land.”

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.600
Most of the Americans have come from outside,

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.400
and the real land owners I don’t know where are they hiding.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.320
I seldom see them.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.040
Now the responsibility is coming in their heads

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.600
that we have taken this land

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:11.760
and we feel that this is our land

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.280
but it belongs to the whole world.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.200
Whatever they have done now is coming back.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.200
Once you rise higher you start seeing the vision.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.120
Whatever you have done through your mental projections.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.880
People don’t even realize in many countries

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.720
that this is one world.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:42.560
Mental projection is on another level

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:49.000
is that you have created a materialistic world.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.120
With this materialistic world

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.800
you have reduced everything to the level of money.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.520
Religion is money, everything is money.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.840
Nobody has any respect for anything but for money.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:17.320
And then material things.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:25.280
One starts seeing matter as a source of wealth

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.320
and source of dignity

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:38.160
and a source of great positions, powers.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:48.000
But when you rise higher into Virata’s power

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.440
you see the stupidity of materialism.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.520
What is matter after all?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:05.240
Matter is for making the place beautiful,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.040
giving you joy,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:19.160
and this matter is also for expression of your joy to others.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.800
When you give them some present,

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:25.600
some material thing beautifully made.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.320
Then you start thinking also

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.160
how God has created this beautiful world

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:42.720
and you start creating beautiful things

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:52.880
in art, in music, drama, even films, everything.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:01.600
But at the material level and at the mental level

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:05.480
the projection is linear; it moves like this.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.480
As a result, it falls down.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:15.040
So everything, the standard of our expression has fallen down.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.320
I know films in the twenties and thirties and forties

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.240
from the same Hollywood

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.360
were very different from what they are today.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.600
You can’t even see some of them.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.720
Then in the same mental projection

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:39.080
we see the dramas and the novels and the art,

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.120
everything has come down, is deteriorated,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:51.240
is not at all joy giving but it is destructive.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.960
It is destroying itself, first of all,

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.480
and so it is destructive.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.520
As a result, we are moving our mind

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.680
and moving on that decline also

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:09.560
and we also take to things which are destructive.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.000
Our standards in everything have gone down.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:17.680
Morality also is an innate blessing to human beings

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:24.560
but he starts putting it on a mental level.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.400
When you put it on the mental level

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.360
people like Freud become Christ,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.720
and you start following them

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.480
and you become nothing but a sex point.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:47.960
In every direction if you see there’s a big decline

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.920
and you get upset, you don’t understand,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.520
how there is such a decline in human nature,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.840
how there is a decline in art, decline under treasure,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.240
decline on human relationships,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.360
in everywhere you find this decline.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.120
With money of course, certain things

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.680
may appear to be smart, fast, like tennis you can say.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.640
People used to play tennis for joy, never for money.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.440
But now they play for money and

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.360
after four, five days we find he has gone down,

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.040
or four, five years he is finished.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:41.680
So the speed has come also into sports because of money.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.560
This money has been like a big load

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:55.680
has brought down all the beautiful things in its own level.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.360
They are not the same level at which they are created.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.560
If it was on the same level,

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.880
Sahaja Yoga would have worked very nicely in America.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
But it did not, because here is the maximum load

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:20.560
on all our creations of our mind of our mental projections.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.920
Whatever direction you will see

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.520
you will find there is such a decline.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.960
We know of lawyers who would be so honest

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.840
and who would work out something

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.720
for the person for whom they are fighting.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.720
But today you can bribe the lawyers.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:52.480
We know the doctors which would go all out to cure patients,

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.480
they have lost their sense of ethics.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.200
Everybody has lost the sense of ethics.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:10.400
First is this materialism, money and above all I think

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:17.080
at this time there is a big growth of people

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.880
because this is a resurrection time.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.320
And many types of people are born.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.840
Thousands and thousands of them are born

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.280
who might be like animals or maybe

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:37.920
some sort of absolutely idiotic type

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.720
or maybe some stupid stuff.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.880
At this time, we have to do resurrection work,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
means what, that our Virata Shakti

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:54.040
has to be enlightened in our brain.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:12.480
So in Sahaja Yoga when you rise into Virata Shakti

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:19.320
you go up and see all these declines,

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:26.240
all these falling mental projections, from that height.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.520
And also you see yourself.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:35.840
That you had gone into all these nonsensical things,

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.120
but now you feel that you have come out of it

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.200
and now you have become like a lotus.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.120
Especially the ego part.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.840
Ego is extremely strong in modern times. It was never so.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:03.960
It is, I think the birth of many fighting cocks

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.240
has come on this earth and also

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:14.720
some of the jungle creatures are also reborn.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.720
Because you can’t talk to them.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.280
If you say anything they just jump on you.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.040
You cannot criticize them,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.160
you cannot tell them what’s wrong with you,

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.680
they’ll just sit on your head,

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.120
if you say anything they’ll start hitting you.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.040
They never want to see what’s wrong with them.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.560
It’s impossible to communicate to them because of their ego

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:42.920
and this ego has come because of certain

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.880
declining nature of the modern time.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.600
For example, from childhood

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:59.320
a mother starts scolding her child for spoiling her carpet.

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.920
So carpet becomes more important.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.680
So the next day the child gets very angry,

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.720
he gets the scissors and cuts the carpet

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.760
to punish the mother.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:21.200
Then they see that the child wants money for something

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.040
and they ask him for what.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.080
“Because I have seen in the television that

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.200
there is a bear which has a birth date.”

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:36.200
So a new type of devils have come up they are entrepreneurs

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.040
and through their mental projections

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.200
they take out novel ideas,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.960
see like a teddy bear which has a birth date,

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.560
can you imagine, such a stupid idea.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.080
And all the children wanting to buy that.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:57.560
Now if one child buys another must have it.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.640
All kinds of things these entrepreneurs do.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.600
And people start becoming slaves of them.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.600
Like in Paris they started a fashion

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.840
that you’ll have six inches of skirts.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.200
So all other skirts were thrown away.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.600
The six inches skirts started.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.160
Imagine in that cold, they would wear socks

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.360
and six inches of skirts. Everybody looks the same.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.960
What is so beautiful about it.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.360
Whatever they want the entrepreneurs so called,

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:40.280
they are called as artists, also as designers,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.840
but their designs are just to kill your freedom,

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.360
just to make you a slave.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:55.080
And all kinds of monkey tricks they play, which you accept.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.960
Once you start accepting those monkey tricks,

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:06.960
then you don’t also realize that how you have become a slave

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.320
and there is no individuality about it.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:17.480
Hairstyle they will start particular hair style.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.320
So everybody goes about with the same hairstyle.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.440
Or you go to a hairdresser.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:40.560
So when you rise into your Virata Shakti

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.360
by the enlightenment of the Kundalini,

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:51.840
the Viratangana is the power which gives you

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:59.240
a complete vision of the decline

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.600
into which every mental projection

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:13.440
which was idealistic, beautiful has fallen.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:22.600
For example, Abraham Lincoln gave a very great idealistic idea

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.800
about the a state, about democracy.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.800
But now many people say that it is demonocracy.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.600
Those people who were in Russia, of course they were wrong,

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.680
but still they had an argument

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.120
that we don’t want to become democratic

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:51.040
because look at America.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.520
Nothing is safe, nothing is normal,

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.240
so what’s the use of becoming democratic country.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.600
Can you hear me there, it's all right! it's all right.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.520
After all we are on a picnic, you see.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.480
And we cannot have any problems

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:29.240
because I told him whatever is here is here,

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.280
and whatever is not, is not here.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.480
So if you have any problem, we can’t help it.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.160
So you rise to that level, gradually, gradually,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.800
first, I don’t know what you see.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:00.280
But you start seeing what’s wrong with your society,

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:07.480
what’s wrong with your relationships.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.680
Ultimately, you start seeing what’s wrong with you,

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.120
how you are wrong.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.920
That I would say is the higher state

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.520
where you reach and you start seeing

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.240
"This is wrong with me".

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:36.760
After that you start understanding

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:44.680
that you have got powers, Viratangana’s powers.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.640
You have got powers.

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:54.280
In your brain itself, you have got powers.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:09.280
By which you understand the Meta Science,

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:15.520
science above science, the meta art.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:21.720
The vulgarity of art. Discrimination starts working,

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:27.080
you start understanding what is really art, what is not.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.160
You start enjoying that art.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.360
And the enjoyment of Nirananda,

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:45.280
you get it when you rise above and see

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.240
the whole thing in a different perspective.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:57.400
First of all, you see it as a drama, as a witness.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.240
And you laugh, you see.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.920
I was telling a joke about a lady who was interviewed

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.720
for doing some art with the mehndi on the hand.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.720
She’s an Indian lady from India.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.480
So the interviewer asked her,

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.920
“What about the foreigners, how do they react,

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.440
the Americans, how do they react?

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.280
She said that they ask very funny questions.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.240
Funny questions? Yes, they ask me, “What is this?”

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.120
So I said, “This is my Suhaag,

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:47.440
my husband’s symbol, that's what I wear.”

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.640
So they said, what about extras?

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.080
“You didn’t follow?”- What about the extra husbands if you have?

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.320
Now you all are laughing at it, you all Americas are laughing,

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.800
but at that time point you would not have laughed,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.000
because very common.

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.160
In the same way, everyone,

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.440
even India or any place where they do absurd things

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:28.880
it becomes very obvious and you start seeing it very clearly,

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:35.960
very very clearly that what are we doing, it’s all absurd.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.320
But this is not only on mental level.

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.320
This is what I am going to tell you.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.640
It is not just you see the vision,

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.440
all right, still mental level,

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.360
then you understand it is wrong, still mental level.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.600
But you just don’t do it.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.680
You become part and parcel of Virata.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:12.360
When you become part and parcel of Virata then

00:30:15.072 --> 00:30:19.632
you don’t have to even think, you just see it, and you laugh.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:23.000
You just see and you know it is wrong.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.360
It is all absurdity.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.560
We went to see one temple in India

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.160
and there were some pujaris, doing puja.

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.720
So the Indian Sahaja Yogis ran out.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.480
I said, “What happened?”

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.560
“Mother, they are all hypocrites, they have horrible vibrations,

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.560
how can they do puja,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.600
they have horrible vibrations, all bhoots.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:06.760
That’s how we become so powerful,

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.480
I would not say you are like a light,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.400
because light doesn’t see the light does it?

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:22.880
But you see, you are light and you see light.

00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:32.480
And the third thing that happens to you with this Viratangana

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:39.360
that you humble down. You humble down.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.640
You become extremely sweet, obedient,

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.280
just like children.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.760
And you don’t mind anything, anything you don’t mind.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:05.000
That is the state you achieve not as a slave,

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:13.600
not out of domination, but it just works in you,

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:22.440
it penetrates into your brain, you become that.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.000
I’ve seen people who are horrid absolutely,

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:31.040
and after some time you can’t even recognize them.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.000
How do they change?

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.320
How do they get the change?

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.480
What happens to them?

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:48.640
Is the brain is enlightened, has become the light

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.640
and you know you have the light.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.000
That is doubtless awareness.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.000
You should have no doubts about yourself,

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.040
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.000
Some people falsely have.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.840
They are bhoots but they say no we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.480
That’s not the thing.

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.720
The discretion power becomes so beautiful

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.320
of the Hamsa Chakra, because they are all connected,

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.840
the Vishuddhi, Hamsa and Virata.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.560
They are all connected centers.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:32.440
It is not only that the Virata improves,

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.760
but the Vishuddhi improves and Hamsa.

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:43.520
So now what happens that you jump into collectivity.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.680
Collectivity is the blessing of Viratangana.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:57.720
She teaches you how to love each other.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.800
She teaches you how to enjoy other Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:12.520
She teaches you how to have bhakti in your heart.

00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:21.360
But that teaching is like innate.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.640
If I say She teaches, means you are the disciple

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.800
and She is the teacher, No, No.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.160
You become Viratangana yourself.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:38.040
And the love and the affection and the understanding

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:42.720
that you have for each other is remarkable,

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.840
is very enjoyable and very beautiful.

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.040
So all that happens,

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:54.240
absolutely happens in your brain.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:59.480
That’s how your brain, which is

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.840
the one which receives all the information

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.680
and creates all the information,

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:12.520
creates all the mental projections

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:18.440
becomes a new vehicle to create a dimension

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.080
which goes higher, not declining.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.200
All of you are part and parcel of that, all of you

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.440
are part and parcel of that and all of you are important.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.160
All of you have to support that,

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.600
all of you have to raise it.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.240
It is very important;

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:48.120
you all should understand your own responsibility.

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.760
So between South and North America

00:35:53.880 --> 00:36:00.280
we have to at least have 16,000 Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.240
Krishna was very clever,

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:14.560
He created his 16,000 powers into ladies.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.960
Then these 16,000 women were taken away

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:25.320
by one king and he just kept them.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.840
So Shri Krishna went and defeated that king

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:37.440
and brought all the 16,000 powers to himself, very nice.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.760
He could do all those tricks, not Me.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:46.560
I have to have 16,000 children who are human beings

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:50.600
and who get this power within them.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:56.240
Not like my own powers I manifest. What is the use?

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.600
You can’t give realization to others,

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.600
you cannot communicate towards others, you cannot do anything with them.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.040
So Shri Krishna only told Gita, finished.

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:12.280
They were clever people, they didn’t want to face the problem.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.480
It’s very difficult.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.200
You people have a bad Vishuddhi, I get it.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.160
You people have a problem, I get it.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.920
It's just collectively to work out.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.360
To take you inside my body as a cell

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.680
and to cleanse it, it’s very very difficult task

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.160
but one has to do it.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.920
One has to do it and one will do it.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:46.760
I’m sure one day when you all will be

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.600
completely aware of Viratangana power within yourself,

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.720
I don’t know what will happen to this country.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.720
As it is I find it is just bubbling now, about to break.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.800
It’s a big breakthrough I find this year,

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:13.640
among Sahaja Yogis as well as among the other people.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.440
But there was another quality of Shri Krishna

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:22.520
was diplomacy, is to be diplomatic.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.320
With others you have to be diplomatic.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.560
You should not just jump on them and try to oppress them,

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.680
or in any way try to show

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.640
that they are nowhere compared to you, No.

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.520
You should say that we were like you, worse than you.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.840
Then people are happy. But see now we have changed.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.040
Somebody says that “I was smuggling drugs

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:49.600
you should say no I was smuggling even arms”.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.560
Then their ego will not be hurt,

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.200
if their ego is not hurt then it’s easy.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.240
So diplomacy also you must learn.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.400
Also Diplomacy is a mental projection at a lower level.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:15.280
At a higher level diplomacy is where is your charisma,

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.800
where you attract people, where you capture them.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.000
How you talk to them, how you behave towards them.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.280
And also have a compassion, because

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.400
you are now sitting on the Himalayas,

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.640
but what about these poor people.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.480
In that way if you see the whole thing I am sure

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:39.880
you will not feel so much

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.440
that you are doing this work and that work.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:52.040
Shri Krishna’s whole philosophy is like this.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.840
That you should get your “Ghyana”.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.600
Ghyana is Ghy means Gnostics,

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.480
you have to become Gnostics means

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.520
on your central nervous system

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.200
you must know it. That’s the first thing.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:11.120
The second thing was because Arjuna was so half-hearted,

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.640
still he asked him questions.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.800
So he said,

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.800
“What about Karma? Everybody talks of Karma.”

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.560
Again diplomacy.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.960
The whole Gita is full of diplomacy

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.400
and normal human beings can’t understand.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:51.760
So he said, “Yes of course, you must do your Karmas,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:58.200
but you have to surrender your karmas at My Lotus Feet.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.800
No not possible.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.720
Very clever because as long as you have

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.720
“I am doing this, I am doing that” idea,

00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.480
how can you put your karmas onto the feet of Shri Krishna.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.160
That means you should get your realization

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.480
where you know you that you are not doing anything.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.600
When that happens that you know you are not doing anything,

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:31.600
at that time the Karma becomes Akarma.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.160
And how you talk, I’ve seen people raising Kundalini

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.840
saying, “Mother, it doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.760
You don’t say that, “I am doing it.”

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.120
You just say, “It doesn’t rise, it doesn’t work out.”

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:49.840
in the third person. Another is about Bhakti,

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:56.320
because now we have lots of these Hare Ram’s, Hare Krishna’s

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:58.520
spoiling their Vishuddhi.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.480
So for Bhakti He has used only one word.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:10.600
He says, “You give me flowers, you give me water,

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.840
you give me leaves, I’ll take them.”

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.560
But while giving what does He say?

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:20.040
“But you must do “Ananya Bhakti”.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.600
“Ananya” means when there is not the other,

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.600
when you become one with Me, when you are connected.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.680
On “Ananya” word he has danced

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.520
the whole thing and these stupid people don’t know

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:37.080
that they are not connected as yet and they are talking

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.880
about Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Hare Rama.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.160
That’s how they are not connected.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.120
They don’t understand that they have to be connected.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.840
And this is the trick he has played with all the people

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.480
that “All right, all right

00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.480
you go on saying Hare Rama, Hare Rama we’ll see.”

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:05.040
So the diplomacy part in his case because

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:10.560
He had to bring them to the point that

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.080
No, No, this doesn’t work out, No this doesn’t work out.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:17.880
So then “Gyana. Now what is Gyana is they start reading books,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.800
No, No. It means 'bodh', means on your central nervous system

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.680
you have to do. So how gradually he brought them to that level.

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.760
In the same way when you are dealing with others

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.560
you have to work it out that way.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:37.800
And once you work it out that way,

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.880
you can spread Sahaja Yoga much faster.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.160
You’ll be a very light person,

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.360
everybody will enjoy you

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.800
and you’ll have no temper, nothing.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:54.800
We get into temper because

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.680
we don’t know how to handle the situation.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:59.920
If we know how to handle the situation

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.200
we’ll never get angry, on the contrary

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.720
use the anger of another person for your own benefit.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:12.760
All these things you learn through the power of Viratangana.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:19.640
Viratangana gives you the full detachment

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.680
from every subject of worry.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:31.480
She sucks in all this and throws them in the air.

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:43.280
It is Her great power that has really given you

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:48.080
such an understanding about life, about yourself.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.920
Your own value system has changed.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:57.800
If you see what a change it was for you,

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:05.320
all this transformation, everything is the power of Viratangana.

00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:10.920
And ultimately what She gives you is “Nirananda”.

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:20.440
Is the joy, joy and nothing else but joy.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.480
May God bless you.

00:45:48.673 --> 00:45:49.919
(Shri Mataji compliments Gregoire.)

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:55.480
I must give full credit here to Gregoire

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:02.320
because he came and struggled and fought and like Arjuna you see,

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:09.040
he felt very desperate and went away.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.560
He had to go also in any way.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.720
And suddenly as he is gone,

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:21.840
I find here is everything so sprouting, so well

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.320
and people have started taking over the responsibility

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.480
of working out Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.520
But I still remember him at this time

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:37.120
because he was really very desperate

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:44.440
and absolutely fed up with the American style of thinking.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.760
But now we’ll give him a very good news

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:53.480
that how America has improved.

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:07.480
We have many Sahaja Yogis in America

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.520
who have been very dedicated

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.280
despite all kinds of negative forces and everything.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:16.400
With all the nightmares they have gone through,

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:19.160
they are stuck on to Sahaja Yoga

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:26.520
and I find that their efforts are now showing results.

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.240
I will not take their names

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:34.440
because you know all of them very well one by one.

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.640
But I must say that Steven has done a great contribution.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.280
I never asked him to come to America.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:50.240
But he himself decided and he himself came here on his own

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:56.800
and he has really contributed a lot to Sahaja Yoga by coming here.

00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.240
May God Bless You.

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.560
Of course, your leader is there

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.280
and all the leaders in every place

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.760
have been really working very hard

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:28.080
and I just see how things are prospered in one-year time.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.600
It's very creditable.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.040
We never had so many people for the Puja.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:39.360
I am quite surprised as all of you being here.

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.880
Thank you very much.
