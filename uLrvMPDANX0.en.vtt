00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.400
How are you Pat?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.400
Very well Mother.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.640
Put My shawl there. I think [unclear].

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.080
Sit down. Please be seated.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.640
People from Brighton have come? Has Sil come?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.800
No?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920
I beg your pardon.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.920
They have evening classes [unclear].

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.800
But today they could have come from the evening class.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.440
Gavin, just come here for one minute.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.440
This ventilator is so strong. I just can't bear it.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.880
If you don't mind I'll ...

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.920
I know there are some ...

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.560
It is better to say it now.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800
It's too much. I personally think.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.680
There are of course extreme cases as I said.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.920
[unclear]

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.240
the palms, the hands, with the palms [unclear]

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.880
[unclear] you are asking for a gift.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.640
I'm Myself going into austerities all the time.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.960
I don't take any lunch, breakfast, nothing else, very little.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.880
I've received such letters from India also and they said the same.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.880
Some of them are really,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.280
I just don't know, why it happens like that.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.680
Like Gill said that it took six months for her to get vibrations,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.400
while there are people who are feeling the vibrations.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.280
Just they saw [unclear].

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.240
It's true, I mean I don't know what to say. What to do, you say.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.040
Let’s start.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.920
Today is a day of departure for Me, for India,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.080
and, I am very sad that

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.880
I have to leave My children here.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.280
It’s a sad day, no doubt.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.640
But I have to go as you know and you all are going to join Me,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.680
quite a lot of you.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.160
But those who are going to stay here

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.800
have to understand that they are here with a purpose,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.600
not without a purpose.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.080
And during My absence

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.000
one should not waste that time.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.800
On the contrary, you must put your mind

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.400
to find out what you can do

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.280
to improve the

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.880
conditions of other Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.520
Many of you are

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.000
Sahaja Yogis and you have felt cool breeze from the very first day,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.560
and have been feeling it all through.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.160
But there are so many, still,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.520
who don’t even feel the cool breeze

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.560
and they feel very funny about it and feel sort of guilty.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.280
Sometimes they feel that they are something

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:30.800
of a lower type, or something wrong with them,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.240
that they don’t feel the cool breeze.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.680
So, one of the greatest worry,

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.520
for all of you, should be that

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.240
there are some people who are not feeling anything in their hands.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.840
They have been coming to Sahaja Yoga, have been

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.560
religiously working it out,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.080
but they haven’t been able to achieve

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.200
the first experience of cool breeze.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.640
For this there can be many, many reasons,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.400
not one, but there can be many reasons.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:29.800
And without getting involved into these reasons,

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.800
if you try to see within yourself,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:39.600
and if others who have felt it are compassionate and kind,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.000
they can definitely help others.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.800
But the worst thing that we human beings suffer from,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.360
is ego.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.160
And this ego makes us feel small

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:02.600
at the slightest thing anybody tries to help you.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.320
Some people might have a hurt ego,

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:15.440
might have a bloated ego, might have

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:21.120
a state of mind,

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.960
which does not even see the ego.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.400
And that is why it is difficult

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:41.760
to talk to anyone what is to be done to improve.

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.400
So those who are better off, suffer from a dilemma.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.560
They don’t want to hurt another person,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.760
and another fear they have, that if they try to help others

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.880
their ego might go up.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.720
Because they are afraid of their own ego.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:17.560
But we must understand that, once we have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.080
once our Kundalini has been awakened,

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:29.040
then, all of us have now become part and parcel of one body,

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:37.400
of one body of the great Primordial Being.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.720
In a body, as human bodies are,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.080
supposing a finger is numb,

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.400
then all the body’s attention is on that finger to cure it.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:00.960
And all the other fingers and the whole body, the brain,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.760
the mind you can call it,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.400
everything is worried about that finger ,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.960
how to make it all right.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.960
Naturally there is no ego for these fingers,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.880
so nobody feels hurt or bad.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.320
And the fingers are also anxious to do it, because they can feel

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.720
the problem of the finger which is numb.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.800
If there is some problem, say, internally within your body,

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:46.040
all the cells which are needed to correct that problem will rush.

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.560
The blood will rush. The heart will pump.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.400
Everything will work out in a very co-coordinated way,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.320
but nobody feels hurt.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.680
that “Why should I take help from anyone?”.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.680
Neither the one who helps is frightened or afraid

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.440
or also feels the ego.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.800
The reason is, the cells of the body

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.640
are under the complete control of one brain,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.240
or one personality, or one Self.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:31.320
But in Sahaja Yoga, this collectivity is not yet established.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:38.720
That’s why people feel hurt, people hurt each other.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:46.480
They have fear

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.920
of another ‘cell’, which is the brother ‘cell’,

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.880
witch is the partner ‘cell’,

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.160
which is the part and parcel of your own being.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.160
Are we afraid of our eyes? Or afraid of our nose?

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.360
Are we afraid of our hands, or of our feet?

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.800
And this collectivity is such a vicious circle

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.880
that unless and until you become really collective,

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.720
you cannot feel another person.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.920
And unless and until you have that sense of responsibility

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.560
of collectivity built in yourself,

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.000
you cannot help another person.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.400
So certain amount of growth is needed in the whole body

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.200
to be sensitive enough to help each other,

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.640
to be wise enough to help each other,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:51.480
to be resourceful enough to really nourish another.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.040
And that development has to come again through collectivity;

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.800
is most surprising.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:08.520
I know sometimes people feel that there are Sahaja Yogis

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.160
who are not even of one mind.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.320
I agree.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.800
That somebody will say, “Your Vishuddhi is catching,”

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.440
another will say, “Your heart is catching.” Another will say,

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.240
“Your void is catching.”

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.480
They don’t say that all of them will say the same thing.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.240
One will say this, one will say that, one will say that.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.680
The reason is, some of them have developed

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.400
certain sensitivity to a certain centre,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.760
but not to all the centres.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.880
And that’s how there can be

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:51.160
a difference of opinion as there should not be at all.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:57.160
So firstly we must all know that we are still growing.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.480
We have to still grow.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.320
In Sahaja Yoga even if you get your Realization, that doesn’t mean

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.960
you have suddenly become John the Baptist.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.360
We all have to grow.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:17.480
And for growing and growth we have to discard something

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.040
and we have to accept something.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:30.880
And the best thing that should be discarded is your ego,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.720
and it comes in so many ways

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:42.080
that it creates a barrier between you and your Creator.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:46.000
Sometimes this ego can take you to anti-God activities

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.160
and you will not know that it is your ego is taking down there,

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.400
because the identification with ego has been,

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.320
not in this life, but in many lives before also.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:05.560
So to get misidentified, or we can say, to get dissolved

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:13.160
or, this ego, or to get away from this ego

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.240
is a difficult thing.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.720
But as you grow out of the mud of this ego,

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.040
the lotus starts becoming fragrant

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.840
and everybody can see that fragrance.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.080
It is more difficult in the Western countries, than in the Eastern.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.800
Because the whole basis of the growth in the West

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.720
has been so far based on ego and competition.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.920
There is no competition in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.040
You just think, if one finger starts competing

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.960
with another finger, what will happen?

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.160
It is as absurd as that.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.920
Now we are talking of roots.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:17.200
We are not talking of the shoot, what people have achieved

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.160
through Western style of thinking.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.600
Now we have to go deep down into the roots,

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.240
so we must change our methods.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.760
There is no competition at all among roots.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:40.720
They help each other. If one fails, another goes and helps .

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.360
That is how this living process can work out.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:53.480
We have to change our ways of tackling ourselves and others,

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:02.720
and we have to realize, that God’s Power of Love

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.240
is the highest, deepest and the mightiest.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.960
And this is the power of love that we have to assert.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.200
But love just does not mean that you spoil someone

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.960
or tell lies just to please someone.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.760
It may not be pleasing, in the beginning maybe,

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.840
but ultimately it will be.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.360
So when we, you have to talk to someone,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.440
of course, you need not be arrogant or rude at all,

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:46.840
should be sweet, you should be kind, compassionate,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.520
but it’s not diplomacy going on there.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.720
It’s not any that you are trying

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.200
to get out some votes from that person.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.240
It’s a guideline you are giving to the person.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.320
And the guideline can be even silent.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:15.240
The greatest guideline for anyone is

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.720
the precepts that you follow,

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.440
the ideals you have, the way you behave.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.920
You know in India one person

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.760
gave Realization to ten thousand people.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:39.440
And how he did it, how he impressed others.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:49.320
He impressed others because he went to an office,

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:56.800
a commissioner's office, for some, his personal work,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.280
and then he started talking

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.640
in such a manner that they couldn’t understand

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:11.320
that this man has come for some practical,

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.640
every day-to-day stuff, and the way he’s talking,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.480
the way he’s behaving, the way he’s dignified,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.600
and so firm,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:33.880
how is he managing that? So they said, “Who is your guru?”

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.040
Immediately it came into their head

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.360
“Must be some good gurus here they have.”

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.600
He said, “I have no guru,

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.880
I’ve only a Mother.” He said, “We all have.”

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.280
That’s how it started.

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.040
So one must

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.400
know that, by your own behaviour,

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.400
you can talk to another person.

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:12.560
and that behaviour should not be superficial,

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.840
must be coming from the heart, the concern within,

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.760
the concern that this person should be all right.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.320
Genuine concern.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:30.000
And even a dog knows that, you don’t have to tell anybody

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.440
by taking some sort of a vow,

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.440
but even a dog knows what is a genuine concern

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.560
and what is not a genuine concern.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.520
With that concern you have to talk.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.040
And that is what we lack

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:54.040
is the genuineness within ourselves, our heart is not open.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.360
Open your hearts.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.560
Now you have entered into the Kingdom of God. Open your hearts!

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.320
Just see yourself. Why have you got fear? For what?

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.160
Ultimately what is going to happen?

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.080
We are all going to die, isn’t it?

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.680
So put that, fix that point, "we are going to die",

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.280
whether a tiger eats us, or we jump from anywhere.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.040
Something has to happen to us to die.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:31.040
So why should there be any fear?

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.720
Now if there could be a genuine fear, is this,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.160
that you may not receive your Realization.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.960
Even this genuine fear has no meaning

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.800
because this will also kill your chances of Realization.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.000
You should believe that God is great

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.560
and that His compassion is great,

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:06.960
really from your heart. You’ll get your Realization no doubt.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.400
You all are there for that and

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.000
the Divine Power itself is anxious to do it, extremely anxious.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.040
You can see. Can you believe that there are

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.080
so many people who are realised souls today in this London?

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.760
I came here about twenty years back and if somebody had told Me

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:37.240
that there are going to be so many realised souls, here, in this

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.080
place, I would never have believed,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.520
because at that time I had met very few,

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.360
in the whole world I would say.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.400
So the things are happening, but be patient!

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.480
And believe

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.160
in the mercy of God, in the kindness of God, in His compassion,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.680
in His anxiety

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.800
to give you this gift of Realization.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.200
And this is one of the greatest hindrances people have,

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:22.040
when they do not feel their vibrations.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:31.400
Today I received a letter from Gill

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.400
and she said she went with My photograph to be framed

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.960
or something, in a shop.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:47.640
And the shopkeeper, that lady, she looked at the photograph,

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:53.160
she was little bit, I don’t know, concerned.

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.040
A+nd she said, “Who’s photograph is this?”

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.040
So Gill just said that,  “You put your hands towards it.”

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.560
“Oh God, what has happened? As if some door has opened.”

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:07.320
Just she put hands there and she gets that.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.120
And Gill was amazed, because six months she never felt anything!

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.240
She was breaking her head with it,

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.960
“Mother, I never feel cool breeze, I never feel cool breeze.”

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.160
But she is a great seeker no doubt.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.400
And now, she says that her brother came

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.400
and he didn’t feel the cool breeze.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.240
So Gill said, “You have a bad liver,”

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.000
“Yes, yes, How do you know? I have.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.240
I’ve got pain in the liver. I’ve had problems with the liver.”

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.160
So Gill said, “Put your hands towards the photograph

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.560
and put your left hand on the liver.”

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.400
“Oh God, I am feeling this,

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.800
and I’m feeling the tingling ”

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.800
and this and that, and he showed the finger for the liver.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:04.160
And she was amazed that this gentlemen just walks into the shop

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.160
where are so many people are coming, going,

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.160
no Caxton Hall,

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:13.320
no peaceful atmosphere, no other Sahaja Yogis sitting there,

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.840
and suddenly you find

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.800
this gentleman feels the cool breeze.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.080
Not only that, but he can exactly say where he’s catching.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:32.400
Nothing happened, no trembling in the hands, no shaking, no burning.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.640
And he felt better on the liver.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:44.400
She couldn’t understand what was the reason.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.320
The reason is very simple.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.800
When you come for a program

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.720
there are many others who are already feeling vibrations.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.160
And you don’t feel it. It’s like, you see,

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.560
they have a property and you don’t have sort of a thing.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:13.360
So your mind, which has worked through competition,

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.600
mind which has worked

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.560
through realising that, “Somebody has something. I don’t have”,

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.240
have-s and have not-s, you see,

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.120
that mind starts putting fear into your head

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.760
“Oh God, will you have it or not?

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.240
Will I get it? Or even if I get it, will I lose it?”

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.000
And that fear I see on the faces of many new people.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.840
Give up that fear!

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.560
You are all going to get your Realization. Give up that fear!

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:58.600
You have not entered into any competition here. Just to relax.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.320
Just relax now!

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:11.720
Then the more you want to do about Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.000
again you are tensed.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.000
“I have to meditate early in the morning;

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.840
I have to get up tomorrow early in the morning,”

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:23.440
you see, you go on pestering yourself. Whole night you won’t sleep,

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.360
and when you are meditating you are dozing.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.760
Relax!

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:34.360
God is looking after you, believe Me!

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.840
He is going to give you Realization

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.160
and He is going to look after you,

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.400
and He is going to wake you up in the morning too. But relax!

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.240
The first idea that “I can do it” is wrong.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.160
He has to do it.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:59.000
It’s not working out because you think you can do it.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.560
If you can come to this conclusion that

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.280
“I cannot do it, it is His mercy, His graciousness has to work out.”

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:18.800
But, after Realization,

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:25.880
you have to do something, in the sense you have to desire.

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.160
But when I say you have to desire it, again you will say,

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.280
“All right. Now I’m going to sit down here

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.320
and nail myself to this place

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:37.520
and I’m going to sit down and desire it!”

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.040
This desire is a dead desire, you see,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.760
just pushed onto your head that,

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:48.800
"Oh, I must desire! Mother has told I must desire.”

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.880
You have to be hungry.

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.040
You don’t say that “I have to desire that I have to be hungry,”

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.240
do you?

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.560
The hunger is from within, which is there, no doubt,

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.880
but is clouded.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.240
The hunger is clouded

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.240
because you have fear.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:28.120
If you put a goat before a tiger

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.440
and give him to eat,

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.080
he will reduce with that, eating whatever it is,

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.720
because it has that fear,

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.760
that there is a tiger which is going to eat me.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.160
So first kill all the imaginary tigers around you.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.000
Again we come back to the same

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.400
that desire must come from within.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:59.720
And it is there, but is clouded.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.360
Relax!

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:11.240
It should not be that “I’m very relaxed!”

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.320
It’s childlike. It’s simple.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.720
A relaxed person is just like a child.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.720
So not to get frantic.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.880
Try to relax.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.120
That’s all. For everyone.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.920
But relaxation never means that you are inactive.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:56.800
On the contrary, the person who is relaxed is extremely active

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:03.080
on the exterior, but inside is absolutely silent,

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:11.240
absolutely relaxed and at ease. Outside you may feel.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.920
As you know now, at this time, tremendous vibrations are flowing.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.120
And I can see the flow, tremendous.

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:29.040
And all the chakras are doing like this, around Me.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:33.160
But I see them and their play.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.840
At the most I may stop talking,

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.600
but it is flowing.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.040
So whether

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.920
it is for the seeking

00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:00.240
or for anything else in the world, the first thing is

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:06.960
that you must take an attitude of a relaxed witness

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:16.480
If you can do that, then those who are not feeling vibrations

00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.320
will definitely feel.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:23.960
I have see people on whom I’ve been working,

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.720
and it wouldn’t work out.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.320
Of course they were not rude or not even arrogant,

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.440
but felt very sad that they couldn’t get the vibrations.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:36.080
So I said, “All right, today you go and

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.800
enjoy the flowers in a garden,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.680
enjoy the birds and talk to the sky, and come back tomorrow.”

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.120
It works out.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.880
Because you have been always like this.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.320
In Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to achieve anything,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.880
you become.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:12.360
First you become and then mentally you understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:17.160
But those who try to understand Sahaja Yoga mentally first

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.920
are really in for trouble.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.160
Because when you read it,

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:30.640
it sounds so great and you think, “Oh God, where am I?”

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
So please, if you give Realization to someone, take it easy.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.080
It will grow.

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:49.840
Don’t give ‘Advent’ to read, next moment.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.600
We do it! Why? We think we should impress the person that

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.560
Sahaja Yoga is a great thing and the person must read ‘The Advent’

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.560
so he’ll come to Sahaja Yoga and we’ll establish this man

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.920
because he will see and will be impressed.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.000
If somebody is going to be impressed by these things,

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.600
such a person is of no use for Sahaja Yoga, take it from Me.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.840
If they are going to be impressed by something

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.800
exterior and superficial,

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.000
how far will they go?

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.320
They have to achieve it within themselves, their own Spirit.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.560
They have to be impressed by themselves,

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.640
by their own achievements.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.400
If you understand this simple principle

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:58.440
that, when we become the Spirit,

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.760
we manifest a power

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.720
which is just the opposite of any other so-called powers.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:23.000
Like, you take science, it will analyse.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.840
Sahaja Yoga will synthesise.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.640
Take philosophy, so-called,

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.680
it will try to find out the dogmas.

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:48.120
Sahaja Yoga will neutralise all barriers of all the religions.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:59.000
Because all these forces are deadening, they deaden.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:02.800
The religion is deadened, God is deadened,

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:05.280
everything is deadened by that.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.360
While Sahaja Yoga is a living force within you,

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.200
and that’s how

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:18.520
it neutralises all that is destructive, all that is deadening.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.720
It’s a living force of God, is a very powerful force,

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:34.760
It's very wise, it understands everything.

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.880
We have heard about it,

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.200
but we never believe there could be such a force.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.640
And the first time we feel that force,

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.360
we don’t want to believe it, “How can that be?”.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.360
Because we still don’t believe that we can be

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.000
the source of that force,

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.440
which is integrating,

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.000
which is synthesising completely,

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.960
which nourishes, which helps you,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.240
to rise above falsehood to Reality.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.880
It doesn’t allow any falsehood to build in.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.280
While all other forces, whatever you try,

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.360
political forces, based on falsehood, absolute falsehood.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.400
All politics is based on falsehood.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.960
We can see that.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:46.640
How can you explain the policies of these nations?

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.720
You just don’t understand.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.400
All falsehood. Your democracy is ‘demonocracy’.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:03.680
Your communism, I don’t know what sort of a thing it is.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.520
All absurd, perverted and false.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:17.160
But in Reality you are a communist, you are a democratic person,

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:21.760
everything within yourself is the Spirit.

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.120
But to become the Spirit,

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.800
if you stand on falsehood and want to achieve it, you cannot.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.800
Give up all that! Become the Spirit.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:40.680
Then you start seeing from the window of the Spirit

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.440
everything is different.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:54.760
So the falsehood that we have accepted throughout

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.760
stops your vibrations.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.640
All this is falsehood, believe Me.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.760
The truth is God’s love. That’s the only truth there is.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:15.680
That’s why I say that "God is love, and He is truth".

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.600
The rest is all falsehood and if you believe

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.520
in this principle to begin with,

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.920
really, from the heart,

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.800
then this power starts flowing through you.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.240
It’s the most powerful thing, universal thing,

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.800
which is doing thousands and thousands of things of

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:49.320
making these beautiful flowers, fragrant flowers,

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.720
our heart beating, creating human beings, animals,

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:58.080
everything is done through this living power.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.320
And this living power just has to flow through you,

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.600
and believe Me that human beings,

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:14.600
are the only instruments of that power.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.360
Some people think of compassion

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.960
and think that they must help other people.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.640
That’s falsehood! You can’t help.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.760
You help on a superficial basis.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.960
The only help one can give to another

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.960
is when you become part and parcel of that

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:50.760
Great Being and realise that other ‘cells’ are also there,

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:56.000
who are awakened or may be awakened.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.520
That’s the real help, that’s the real compassion,

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.680
that’s real happening.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:11.440
Sahaja Yoga is definitely,

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:17.240
is the deep understanding of this fact.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.960
We indulge into activities

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:29.560
which are superficial and could be anti-God, as I told you.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.160
But for Sahaja Yoga

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.240
the activities are extremely simple.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.960
Even a finger movement, like that, is sufficient

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.640
to do tremendous things.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:54.240
There’s no need to stand on your head for it.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.840
Awakening is your own.

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.560
There’s no problem on that.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.160
The problem is,

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.920
to prepare yourself for that awakening

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:12.080
by not preparing yourself.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.720
Be unprepared!

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.560
Be simple!

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.800
Just be simple people. Be childlike.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:37.320
Just that. Which is such a difficult thing, to be simple.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.320
No elaborations are needed,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.440
nothing is needed for that,

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.280
no preparations as such,

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:03.160
except open your heart. Now how will you open? Like that?

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:10.160
Pay attention to your heart, just pay attention to your heart.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:14.600
You’ll be amazed, it will start melting.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.760
Just melt your heart.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.520
The thawing starts as soon as you pay attention to it.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.320
Tensions will drop off

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.840
and you will feel cool breeze.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:38.480
So those Sahaja Yogis who came to Sahaja Yoga

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.280
and didn’t feel vibrations,

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.320
should know that the fear that they have…

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.640
Everybody thinks there’s a show on, like a dog show,

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:55.560
like other shows, you see.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.240
And they come with that idea.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.600
There’s no show on.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.160
It’s a thing that you have to achieve yourself,

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.760
which you achieve that state, automatically.

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.960
Now this is about the Sahaja Yogis

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:18.320
who feel that they do not feel any vibrations.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.680
Maybe sometimes it happens also in some places also,

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.320
where the Vishuddhi Chakra is very bad,

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:26.160
you don’t feel any cool breeze.

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.040
So doesn’t matter! As long as you feel peaceful, enjoy that!

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.360
Why worry about the vibrations? I don’t understand.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.160
What is the need?

00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:40.240
If it is not there, well and good.

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:45.960
As long as you feel the peace of your Spirit.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.720
You just put your hands to another person.

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.200
I remember one gentleman in India always used to say,

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.680
“Mother, I don’t feel anything, I don’t feel anything.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:02.760
I’ve done that, done this.”

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.360
I said, “Thank God you don’t feel  it.”

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:12.440
He said, “Why do you say that, Mother?” I said, “Enjoy your peace!

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.520
Enjoy it!”

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.240
But then he wouldn’t listen so I said,

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.640
“All right, go and feel the vibrations of a particular gentleman!”

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.560
And he got blisters on all his five fingers!

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.520
And he came to Me and said, “Bad, oh, Ma!”

00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:35.480
I said, “You wanted to feel, now have the blisters! What can I do?”

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:40.920
So those who do not feel, also are avoiding

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:43.240
little problems for the time being!

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:48.240
Take it easy! It's a very good word  "Take it easy!",

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.400
which is, you know, this word has come very recently.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.560
It was not there, never.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:58.240
It was"‘Run! Run! Run!" before. Now everybody says ‘Take it easy!’

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.720
Specially if you have been to some other gurus

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.440
and some other ‘meditation’ centres and all that,

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:09.400
where you have been jumping morning till evening, you see,

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:14.160
you don’t want to believe that Sahaja Yoga you get,

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:17.320
only by sitting quietly.

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.760
Now there are ways and methods for improving your vibrations.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:37.440
As you know in Sahaja Yoga they are all described.

00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:42.440
For people who suffer from ego,

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.600
I think best thing is

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:49.920
to put your hands into the ice, right hand, maybe.

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.200
It may work out. Try it!

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.360
But don’t prepare.

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.400
Just push your hands into ice sometimes.

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:03.440
It may work out.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:07.760
And for people who suffer from superego,

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:12.000
little bit burning your hand on the candle may help.

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:16.600
Just try! Because the hands are not sensitive.

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.760
So there is a heat or a cool too much.

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.080
Either you are a frozen personality or you are a heated personality,

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:26.120
you are not in the centre.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.160
So if you are a frozen personality, better melt it a little bit,

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:33.160
Try! I never said this before because

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.400
half of you would have run away if I had said this.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:41.000
But don’t burn it to have blisters I am saying!

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:47.400
Just a little bit, try to see that, if you burn your finger

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.240
the sensitivity will improve.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.360
But someone is thinking just now,

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:56.840
that if you have both the problems, what do you do?

00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.280
There are permutations and combinations.

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.480
Because if you get out of your ego

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.360
you have a big superego that comes up,

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:14.520
and if you get after your superego the ego comes up.

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:21.960
That case, the attention has to be brought here.

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.240
And sahaja yogis know what it is, here to put the attention here.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:31.760
If you can keep your attention here, then you are above this,

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.480
and if something drops out it drops out forever

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.720
because you are standing here.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.960
Say if I have a shawl,

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.880
and somehow I can jump on to that gallery

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.400
and this shawl falls off, then I never have it, isn’t it?

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:52.400
Because I’m there,  and the shawl is down below.

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:58.360
So the ascent must take place.

00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:02.640
If you do not ascend…

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:07.320
How do you ascend is through your attention.

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:11.160
Where is your attention?

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.400
Ask yourself, “Where is my attention?”

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:23.320
Either you are counting your money, counting your votes

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:30.240
or some people even count lamp posts I am told!

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.760
If they have nothing to do they can go on doing whatever they like.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.920
But count your blessings!

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.880
Count your blessings!

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.080
And your ascent will start. Count your blessings.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.160
And that is how you ascend,

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:02.440
ascend in the Realm of God.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.320
If there is no ascent,

00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.360
then you’ll move from left to right, right to left,

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.960
you will be wobbly person.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:22.720
But count your blessings with your heart. Feel it!

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.960
The thankfulness. English language is very good,

00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.080
you say "Thank you".

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.280
Now Indian languag is also, you see, we translated it,

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:35.560
to say "Thank you". But we don’t say "Thank you".

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:39.200
Because what is there to say with the mouth?

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:47.160
Normally there are no words for thanking,

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:53.760
because how can you say this if you are feeling from the heart?

00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.960
Even a glance,

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.960
even a tint in the eye, glint in the eye, can express that.

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.760
Just a smile,

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.560
just a bending of your head.

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.240
There’s nothing to be said,

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:22.600
to feel the gratefulness and thankfulness

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.800
for the great blessings of God.

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.080
But if you read newspapers every day, you’ll forget this mantra.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.800
Because when you read newspapers you think,

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.640
"What a curse it is! God is a curse on this earth!”

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.680
or that,“ He has put His curse on me

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.880
and I am the persecuted animal.”

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:58.080
For ascent it’s not a mental procedure,

00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:03.200
it’s a procedure of the heart which is thanksgiving.

00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.000
Look at the flowers,

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:12.760
they are giving thanks to God.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.080
The whole being is nothing but thanksgiving.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.600
Not worried, they are being plucked,

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.120
they will die tomorrow - not worried.

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.960
As long as they live it’s giving thanks.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.760
Look at everything.

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.960
Look at this candle. What is it? Is thanksgiving.

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:39.520
Everything that is created is giving thanks.

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:46.080
What about us human beings?

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:53.800
We say, because we can say it. They cannot say.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.760
It doesn’t have words to say.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:07.720
We have language, that’s how we have become superficial.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.360
We have lost our depth because we have language.

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:17.480
There is no language

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:22.160
for the silent expression.

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.680
So those who do not feel Realization,

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:31.240
should be thankful to God

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.200
that, at least they desire it,

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:38.840
that they are seekers,

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.840
that they are seeking God. How many there are?

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.760
Today when I was coming to Caxton Hall,

00:55:45.960 --> 00:55:49.280
I found people walking with their tailcoats and

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.960
so many, seriously, you know, all of them. Bow ties!

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.000
How many are seekers in this world?

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.920
How many are seeking God?

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:06.920
How many are seeking higher life?

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:12.160
So be thankful that you are seekers,

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:18.120
that you have felt the need of God’s love,

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:24.640
that you do not want anything

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:28.840
that is not God. It’s such a great thing,

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:35.480
that you have a heart, you have a mind that desires the Highest.

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:42.760
Be thankful that you are seekers and born in this great time

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:46.520
where you have to get your Realization. Be thankful.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.560
I know you have committed mistakes. All right, doesn’t matter!

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.840
In your seeking, you have committed mistakes, doesn’t matter.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:01.880
But be thankful that God is looking after you.

00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:08.880
You are the special people created by His love, guided by Him.

00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.680
So be thankful.

00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:20.600
And thankfulness is a quality of heart.

00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:27.080
That’s how, when you feel the beauty of thankfulness,

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.880
then you start feeling the Spirit within you.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:39.760
It cannot be expressed,

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.920
it cannot be returned, it can only be enjoyed.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.920
The blessings can only be enjoyed, isn’t it?

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.320
And it is for enjoyment only,

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.000
it’s not for anything else.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.120
Just that you should enjoy the blessings,

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.760
that’s why the blessings are there.

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:08.880
So to achieve the blessings, is not the point.

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.400
Blessings are everywhere, or I would say,

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:15.480
there are tremendous vibrations today in Caxton Hall.

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.720
And now some of you are not feeling it, that doesn’t mean

00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:24.840
that God has not accepted you, that doesn’t mean that.

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:31.480
It only means you have to turn your face a little bit this side.

00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:37.760
Nobody should feel higher because they are feeling vibrations

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:42.560
or nobody should feel lower because they are not feeling vibrations.

00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:51.520
But if somebody tries to help you, don’t feel bad.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.760
Now all of you who are going to look after the new people here,

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:10.520
must know that, again, it’s God’s blessings that you are here,

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:15.520
that you have this great work to be done,

00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:19.760
that you are now employed by God,

00:59:20.280 --> 00:59:23.280
and He has given you this special job,

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.600
to give Realization to people.

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.640
Again, count your blessings.

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:33.400
Don’t feel depressed. Some people say,

00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.800
“Mother, now you are going and they are all going with you.”

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:39.040
God knows why I’m taking them there.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:42.160
Perhaps, they need more training than you do.

00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.720
But again the competitiveness comes in.

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:57.080
Some have to be in the reserve force, as they say.

00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:01.040
But where am I going?

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:08.040
And that is how, in both ways, we have to count our blessings.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.720
That you are going or not going, is not the point.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:18.680
Both of you have a responsibility

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.240
which is bestowed upon you as a blessing from God.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:32.800
If the attitude towards Sahaja Yoga becomes

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.160
of a child who expects everything from God,

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:40.960
because he’s the child of God.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.280
What’s wrong? It’s no ego.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:46.320
Because if God is Almighty,

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.440
He jolly will have to look after you, isn’t it?

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.080
But we are not like children you know, that’s the reason.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.720
A child will demand.

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.360
But you must have that faith,

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.440
that, whatever you demand, He will do it.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.920
I don’t know if you have forgotten a story

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.560
I used to tell long time back,

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.160
what My grandmother told Me once upon a time….

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.960
Here, here. Come, come!

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.800
What do you want? You want this? All right, have it.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.520
No? You want chana? Ha! Have it.

01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:35.120
Chana? No? Then a kiss?

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.920
Come, come, give me a kiss.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.680
Come along.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.440
No? All right.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.360
Give this to mummy. Come along, give this to mummy.

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.800
Responsibility.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:03.880
They like it, they like it.You must watch them.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:09.440
All right. Now, what do you want?

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:14.600
You want flowers?  No? All right. You give it to them.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.360
Give it to them. Give it to them. Give it to them.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:23.080
Not for himself but for others.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:27.040
Give it.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.240
This is Godsend.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.360
How children explain things so in a, such a simple way.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.280
We cannot be like children. We are very grown-ups, you see.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.800
First give me a kiss.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:56.240
Now, put your hand like that.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.800
Oh, it's fallen.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.800
Today really I don’t know what to say.

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.840
You better ask Me some questions.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.680
All right . Give it to others.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.880
Any other questions please?

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.440
Mother,  I am hearing about that you suggested

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.840
that we have a day without food and a night without sleep.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.720
Come here, I can’t hear you.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.480
Today the vibrations are just blowing in My ears.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.560
Come here. What did you say it is that...

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:06.880
You suggested to us that we have a day without food

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.600
and a night without sleep each week.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.240
One night. Good idea, better try!

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.160
So we’ve been doing it four weeks.

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:15.480
It helped you?

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.440
Yes, I don’t mind the days without food  but

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.120
when I have the days without sleep I find that,

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:22.560
really like now, I can hardly keep awake in the evening.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.480
I don’t think if it’s really very good to continue it every week.

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.200
I think every day you must sleep early, is a good idea.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:34.200
It’s not nice to keep awake in the night.

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.480
Night time is not very good.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:42.720
And, why I said to keep awake in the night was that,

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.360
because what I find, that Sahaja Yogis, have more problem

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.760
of the left-side.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.880
For the left-side people it is important

01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.080
that they should keep awake in the night,

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.120
and lots of things work out.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.360
Because you are alert. In the night only these attacks come.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.920
Left-sided people get all their attacks in the night,

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.600
and right-sided people get all their attacks in the daytime.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.440
So for the people who are night left-sided,

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.520
in your case, specially, you are left-sided,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.040
so what you have to do,

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:28.280
so what you have to do,

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:35.440
what you have to do is to sleep less in the night.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:39.600
You can sleep in the daytime, I don’t mind.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.960
Sometimes you can do it, now do it on a Saturday or a Sunday.

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.480
Otherwise, this left side won’t come up.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.000
Because we have to try and experiment you know.

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:54.240
Would You say something about the timing because for example

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.000
to keep awake from say 12 o’clock to 4 is very easy for me

01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.760
the other night I stayed awake from 12 to 6.30.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.400
The other way round I would say.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.640
And what is that?

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.400
You get up at 12 o’clock, that’s better.

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.280
Yes I did that.

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.200
Yes, that's all right. That's all right.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.320
Then if you are awake from 12 to 6,

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.800
and then can you rest for an hour before you go to work?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.720
No, no. It’s all your lookout.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.840
And there’s no compulsion in Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:21.000
You experiment with it, see whatever suits you.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.200
And you will be able to see yourself. You have to experiment.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:27.840
You see, every individual has their individual problems,

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.000
and this is one of them. One has to see that,

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.920
if you are a left-sided person,

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:36.200
is to keep awake before 12 o’clock is better.

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:38.960
Afterwards, gradually if you sleep,

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.640
you see, all these left-sided problems will disappear.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.680
But the right-sided problems start in the morning time.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.080
You see, “I have to go, I have to catch the bus,

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:55.120
I have to take this”, plan it, plan it, plan it.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:07:00.360
So that time if you at least don’t eat, you get more time.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:06.320
You get more time and apart from that,

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:10.240
your stomach, which is active less,  is better off.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:14.200
I also don’t mind about eating at all. I don't mind about eating so.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.320
If, You want us to do it every week then, one night?

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:18.760
No, no, you have to experiment.

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.560
There’s nothing like that in Sahaja Yoga,

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.440
as you know it is not compulsory.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.960
But if it helps you, the way it helps you, try.

01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:27.800
I mean, I am saying that doesn’t mean now all of you should buy

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.760
a bucket of ice and put your hands into it.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.600
You see this is the trouble with human beings,

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.280
you tell them anything and you'll find them

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:34.960
sitting with a bucket in their hand.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.680
No, I’m just saying ‘try’.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:42.440
You see, because, you must know, I have no problems.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.360
All right?

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:03.760
You are all individuals, you are all professionals,

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.320
you are research scholars.

01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.640
Keep your mind open

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:13.520
and try and find out if it helps you.

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.360
Every individual has individual problems.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:22.760
All these little, little problems you can solve yourself,

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360
because you have the light.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.360
You have the light of vibrations,

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.320
the Spirit is with you, so you are independent.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.200
I just give you guidelines.

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:38.240
That doesn’t mean that you everyday have a vision.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.480
No, horrible it is!

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.480
But it has helped some people.

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.960
May not be for everyone, this may suit or may not suit.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.800
But for left-sided people is better, I have seen.

01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:58.960
With the right-sided people it suits better

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.600
that they don’t eat so much,

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.600
or  their attention

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:14.080
is more towards better things of life.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.480
Actually I don’t think right-sided people eat much.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.680
On the contrary they are very fussy people about food.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.000
I mean the whole thing is a mental thing.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.320
Mentally they will say,

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:30.560
“That’s not  good, I don’t like it, what will I have it?”

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:34.560
You go to a party and the menu card will come

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.120
and seriously they’ll think it ten times what they will eat.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:42.040
I mean what difference does it make what you eat? Does it?

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.840
And they’ll all discuss, “What will I have?”

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:50.920
and they’ll eat two morsels and finish it off.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.440
They’ll not finish even that!

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.360
Because food cannot be enjoyed by mental activity

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.360
– simple thing as that.

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.960
The tongue has to enjoy,

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.800
but all your energy has been spent in your mental activity

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.320
so tongue is not there anymore to enjoy.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:14.600
So, towards food also, anything, if your attention is too much

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.760
reduce it.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.560
And that’s why I said, “Eat less!”

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.160
Or if you fast you don’t have to think about food.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.440
You think more about food than eat!

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.440
And enjoy less. Least of all.

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.520
That’s why it is said ‘fasting’, but when I say 'fasting',

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:40.920
people start thinking, “Then what time should I eat Mother exactly?"

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.520
Is it alright at 8.30 or say 8 o’clock?”

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.360
As if there is a jail in Sahaja Yoga!

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:54.720
Eat at any time you feel like.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.080
But if you are thinking about food what’s the use of fasting?

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.000
Like in India, we have fasting, you see,

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.680
women start planning about the fasting ten days ahead,

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.600
“What will you have for your fasting?”

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.480
See, because in Indian life, people have made some concessions

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.000
that if you eat this, this is not fasting, that is  fasting!

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.520
So then they'll plan out, what they are going to eat.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.400
And they accumulate everything, you know,

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.560
all that is to be eaten because you are fasting.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.680
The whole attention is on ‘fasting’ only.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.440
And actually you are eating all the time .

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:36.760
Like this have Ramadan, Muslims have.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.120
They are supposed to eat early in the morning.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:42.840
But they eat so much in those days that they never eat,

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:45.960
because they know that they are not going to eat later on.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.640
So it’s a funny situation.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:53.040
You see I’m just giving you it as a research scholar

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:59.440
to find out about yourself, what type of life will suit you.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.720
Any other question?

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.200
Mother, what was the end of the story about your grandmother?

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.560
What was the end of the story about your grandmother?

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.400
About the story, about?

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:24.040
What was the end of the story about your grandmother?

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.760
The end of the story about your grandmother, you began...

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:31.120
Oh! That you want to hear again?

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.200
It’s a real grandmother story.

01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.680
So don’t use too much intellectual things.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:42.080
It’s a simple one.

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:48.040
See, she said that, those who believe in God,

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.640
just believe in His blessings, and they have full right on God.

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:03.600
She told a story, that once a man had to go and see God.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:08.440
Now don’t ask question "How is it possible?’" But it’s a story.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:18.920
And on his way he met a gentleman who was doing hatha yoga,

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.640
Western style.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.600
Sometimes he was standing on his head,

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.040
and sometimes standing on one leg

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:31.920
and then tying up his hair to some branches of,

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.600
and dangling himself, and shouting ‘oh God, oh God, oh God’.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.680
This fellow got frightened you know, the way he was showing.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.240
His bones were swaying, all his bones, skeleton.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.240
He said, ‘Now what are you doing?’

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.600
He said, “You see, I’m calling God, when will I see him...”

01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:56.120
He said, “All right, I’m going to see God now,

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.680
I’ll tell Him, but for till then at least don’t

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.600
go to this extreme. It’s too much.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.840
And you settle down. I’ll go and tell God

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.560
that He must come and see you, otherwise this is going on too much.”

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.920
Then he went ahead and he saw one gentleman,

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.480
just on the side of the road, was sitting there.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.280
He said “What are you doing here?”

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.240
He said, “I’m doing nothing. God is doing everything,

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:23.280
what am I to do?”

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:28.600
So he said, “I’m going to see God. Have you any message?”

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.400
“No, no, you just tell Him, you see,

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:33.880
I have not eaten my food today, and He is not bothered.

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.520
Please tell Him to send all my food properly to me.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.080
And tell Him that I need the food.”

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.400
So this fellow said, “Look at this arrogant fellow

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:43.320
who ordered God like this.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.440
And he says God is doing everything

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.920
and he’s just relaxing and ordering God!”

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.080
So he went to God,

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.360
and whatever work he had, he finished with God, and all that,

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.640
and then he looked a little perplexed,

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:58.120
so God asked him “What’s the problem?”

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.120
He said “I have two more jobs to be done.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:07.280
There is one fellow who met me on my way

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.160
and he was doing all these horrible things to his body

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:15.920
and he said that I hope I meet God with all this.”

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.960
“Oh ho, I know him, I know him very well” God said,

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.800
“All right, go and tell him that "You have to do some more of this,

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:27.600
it’s not sufficient.” He got a shock of his life.

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.960
He said “Look at this! God has no compassion at all.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.000
How does He say?”

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.760
So the other fellow he told about, the one

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:38.680
who was just on the roadside.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.760
So he said “Oh, he hasn’t got His food? How can it be?”

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.440
God called all his managers, everyone. He said,

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.760
“How is it you have not given him his food? Please,

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.760
arrange immediately!”

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.360
This fellow was surprised that, “What sort of a thing it is?”

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.480
And this fellow is just ordering God and

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.400
God is looking after this fellow!

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.720
So God, as He knows about everything, He told him

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.320
“All right. You are perplexed? All right, you go down,

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.160
and tell them one story. It’s a tall story,

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.200
but you tell them and see their reaction.”

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.880
So said the story was,

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.400
that “You go and tell them that I saw God

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:26.360
passing a camel through an eye of a needle.”

01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:30.680
He said “All right, I will do that”,

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:34.080
"To both of them you tell and see their reactions

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.600
and then you will know why I did it”.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:41.640
So he went to the first fellow and told him

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:45.280
that, "God has said, still you have to do more of these things.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.440
He’ll come and meet you but

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.920
you have to do more. He said, “Yes, yes. Then He will meet?

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.120
So I will do more and more and more.”

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.040
Then he said, “Then what happened at God’s place?”

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:59.800
He said “It’s something miraculous.”

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:05.280
“What was that?” He said, “The God passed a camel

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:08.680
through an eye of a needle!”

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:10.680
He said, “Must be a very big needle.”

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:13.400
He said, “No, just ordinary one.”

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.560
He said “How can that be?

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.800
Now you have been to God so you are telling me stories!

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.000
You can’t get along with me like this.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:26.000
I understand this is all false,

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.960
just telling me stories.”

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.000
So this gentleman said, “All right, I’ll go to the other gentleman.”

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.560
So he went to him. He was having his food.

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.520
He said, “Sit down, sit down,

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.000
God has sent all food for me.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:43.920
I know, once I tell Him. You see, there’s no need to tell Him also.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.720
He really looks after me, but you wanted to have some message

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:49.200
so I said to Him. But how much He has sent food for me?

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.120
How can I eat all that?”

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:53.840
So this fellow was surprised, you see.

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.840
So he said, “What happened? You went to God.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.960
What did you see there?” He said,

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:06.440
“I went and I saw a camel was passed through an eye of a needle,

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.880
a very small needle, I tell you.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.560
And I saw it!” He said “So what? What’s so surprising?

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.400
After all He’s God.”

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.600
“What is there for Him, for a camel?

01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:22.400
He can pass Universes after Universes.

01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:24.680
He’s God Almighty!

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.760
What is so miraculous for Him?”

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.680
Then he realized.

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.680
This is what it is.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:43.280
If you have faith, God wants to establish it.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.560
Only your faith works it.

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:53.880
But the faith in Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has to be

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.600
the faith of Spirit, of the experience, is not blind faith.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.200
When your eyes are open, you have to have faith in God.

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.000
But still after Realization “So what? Vibrations are there, so what?

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:09.000
What is it so great? Yes, so what?”

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.440
Then God says, “All right, go ahead!”

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:16.480
It’s such a tremendous thing that you get

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.360
but you don’t have faith in yourself,

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.960
how can you have faith in God?

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:25.280
You don’t respect yourself. How can you respect God?

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:29.680
And this is exactly what happens to human beings

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.600
when they deny Sahaja Yoga.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
As you know there have been some miracles also in England,

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:42.120
which were stunning, and people were surprised.

01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:45.360
But there’s absolutely nothing to be surprised at all,

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.560
it’s absolutely very common.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:52.720
And I wish Gavin could tell you about these

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:55.600
few miracles that he has seen, because

01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:59.640
some of you may not be knowing about it, so I would request him

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.480
to tell all about this what happened and what happened in India.

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:07.120
To Me it is not at miraculous, this is nothing.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.840
It’s very simple.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.920
And this has been published in the newspapers and all that.

01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:16.240
I think it’s better that Gavin should tell about this.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:24.040
Come here. Loudly.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.880
When I've [read] the newspapers it happened in Bedford,

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.640
about [unclear].

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:54.360
For the first time

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.680
Shri Mataji had a programme in Bedford

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.320
and, we learnt the next day, that,

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:09.440
a young boy had been going home on his motorbike

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:14.880
and he had an accident, he fell off the bike,

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.720
and he said that a Lady stopped her car and got out

01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:21.280
and put Her hands on him where it was hurting,

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:24.440
and he got better.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:27.680
So he went to the hospital because they asked him

01:21:27.880 --> 01:21:30.080
to do that and they said "You are all right"

01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:33.080
and they discharged him.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:39.240
And then he saw the picture of Mother in the newspaper,

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:42.960
and he told his own mother. He said,

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:45.760
“That’s the Lady who stopped the car.”

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:51.200
So, newspaper reporter heard about this

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:54.440
and he rang up the people who were organising the programme

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.800
in Bedford. He said that,  “Is it true that

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:00.400
this Lady came to Bedford

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:05.640
stopped Her car to heal this boy?” And I said, “What time was it?”

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:09.480
He said, “It was about 9:30 on that evening.”

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:12.400
I said “It’s impossible, Mother was giving a programme

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.560
in Bedford in the Guildhouse ”

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:22.040
But he is still [convinced] it was Her.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.160
And we know that it was Her, in a way, also

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.400
because we’ve heard other things.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.360
For instance in India, even more remarkable,

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.920
Loudly.

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:39.640
there’s a very highly placed attorney

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.320
in Bombay, who is a very great devotee of our Mother.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:54.040
Many of us, we've met him. He’s come here, Mr. Pradhan.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.840
And, one day, when he was

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:02.360
at a programme of Mother’s.

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.480
No, no, at home, with other people, sitting and talking.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.360
No, at a meditation programme,

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:14.040
just sitting, taking vibrations together.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.560
He realized that there was a case he was due to defend,

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.080
which might come up in the courts.

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.000
But it was a long way down the list

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.920
and he thought “Well it will be all right,

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.960
there are a lot of other cases, they will be heard,

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.960
then mine will come up on Monday.”

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:34.480
So the next day he went to the court just to check

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:38.480
and they said, “What do you mean? You were here yesterday,

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.560
it’s down in the court records. You defended the case brilliantly.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.720
The judge commented what an excellent defence you made,

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.560
and you won the case.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.200
What are you talking about?”

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:52.480
He said, “Oh, was I there?”

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:58.320
and then  he thought “No, Mother, was there”

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.640
Ani Petkar tsa diste ahai. (meaning: Tell about Petkar)

01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:08.080
Petkar was another one in Poona, there's a

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:10.880
great Sahaja Yogi named Petkar.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.920
And he had a dream in the night that his brother,

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.080
fell in a big well in the village where they live,

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.920
which is north some way from Poona.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.200
He had a habit of walking in the night, the brother.

01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:33.280
So he was so anxious about this dream, he got up, he prayed

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.520
before Mother’s picture that his brother should be all right.

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:39.440
And the next morning he went home to his village

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.120
and he met his father and his father said

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.600
“Yes it’s true, he did fall in the well and

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.480
they were looking for him with torches

01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:52.440
and suddenly your brother came up out of the water

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:56.520
and was just sitting on the side of the bank. And

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:01.160
his brother told him that, this is what happened,

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:05.640
in the lights he saw a hand with the bangles,

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:09.200
and they came and they pulled him up out of the water”

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.280
And at first he couldn’t speak, he fainted,

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.720
and then began to tell this

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:15.480
to the people who had come looking for him.

01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:19.680
And the brother wasn’t  a devotee of Mataji,

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:25.160
but Petkar had done something,

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.360
and Mother was there.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:39.680
It’s like a camel being passed through the …

01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:45.960
All right. So any other questions please?

01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:49.040
Thank you very much Gavin.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.040
There are thousand and one stories which

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.680
so many sahaja yogis can tell.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.840
How they were helped in every way.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:06.680
God looks after everyone,

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:12.040
but specially the ones who are seeking

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.680
and the highest of all, the ones who are realized souls.

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:28.440
If there’s any question please ask Me.

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:45.240
Did you hear him?

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.200
What could be done about the threat of nuclear war?

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:49.720
What is the?

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.160
What could be done about the threat of nuclear war?

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.680
What caould be done about the threat of nuclear war?

01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:04.200
If you believe in God just don’t think about it!

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.880
Everything can be diffused isn’t it

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.200
It’s only if God wants there will be wa, otherwise there cannot.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:25.400
But there should be people for whom God should interfere.

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:30.960
If all of them are horrible devils, it’s better to have a war.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.480
Man proposes and God disposes – this is English proverb.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.000
You have forgotten all that.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:28:00.760
Nuclear war is the creation of human beings.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:07.920
All right? And human beings are the creation of God.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.200
So the Creator,

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.640
is not going to allow these stupid children

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:27.480
to work it out.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.640
But in case they are that stupid, all of them put together,

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.880
let them have it!

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:45.880
What’s the use of also saving stupid people and donkeys?

01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:54.800
Only the people who are realized souls will be saved,

01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:59.960
because nobody dies,

01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:08.200
they will be re-born again, those who are innocent.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:13.160
And those who are devils will go to hell.

01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:18.920
All right?

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.240
We have one of them born here, see, Markandeya,

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.760
he’s a born realized child.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.560
There are so many you can find them here.

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.200
How does one dissolvefear?

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.040
How does one dissolve fear?

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.680
Fear?

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.680
Fear of what?

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:04.520
Unconscious or conscious fear?

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:07.480
Fear of fear.

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.760
Death?

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.920
Fear of fear.

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.280
Fear of what?

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.200
Of fear.

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:19.840
To fear the fear, something.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:27.720
What fear it is? I tell you.

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.600
Oh, fear without reason.

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:32.560
You see the fear comes to you

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:35.120
because not you are one with Reality.

01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.200
You are not one with Reality.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:42.040
All right? So in Sahaja Yoga there are many ways

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.880
by which you come in the centre.

01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:47.480
You can have fear from your ego or from superego,

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:49.040
from anywhere you can have.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:52.720
But if you are in the centre, fear drops out.

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.120
Gradually the fear drops out completely.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.120
All right? It’s the happening of awakening

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:04.960
that takes you away from that fear.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.800
It’s a happening. You don’t have to do anything.

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.280
What has to happen is that,

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:14.840
when you ascend, it will all drop out automatically.

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.760
We have so many ways and methods of

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.480
keeping yourself in the centre

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.040
and of ascending, that’s all.

01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:28.360
Not only fear but so many things drop out,

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:33.200
habits, addictions,

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.400
tempers, lots of things.

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:42.360
All these barriers drop out because you get out of it.

01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.080
You are born again. All right?

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:51.760
That's how. So you are not to do anything about it. Just ascend.

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.400
And there are so many ways and methods. I hope you will come to

01:31:56.800 --> 01:32:00.640
our programmes and to our ashram here.

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.720
And they will tell you how to do it.

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:07.080
There are many, we had people, who had horrible fears,

01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.640
but they are all right. Now they are fearless.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.440
But they are not fearful.

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.920
Mother, if only You can advise us regarding food.

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.280
Regarding what?

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:25.200
Whatever food should be taken.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:29.480
In Sahaja Yoga we do not pay much attention to food.

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:32.680
Only thing I feel that,

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:36.760
so much attention has been paid to food.

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:39.760
It's not a correct attitude.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:43.120
You see, the Spirit doesn’t eat at all,

01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:49.200
it’s a detached thing. Atma is beyond.

01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:55.480
Now when we try to say that, if we eat this kind of food,

01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:01.360
Atma will be happy, that kind of,  Atma will be happy, is not true.

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.160
For example we’ll say vegetarianism,

01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.880
which is a very common problem with people is.

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.120
You’ll be amazed, all the false gurus are vegetarians;

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:17.840
one by one, Mahesh yogi, Rajneesh...

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:23.240
Rajneesh is a great vedge. He doesn’t even eat garlic and onions.

01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:25.720
This Mahesh yogi’s disciples,

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.040
if you show them a garlic, they’ll jump, 100 times.

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:34.320
They are afraid of the garlic! Can you imagine?

01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:41.240
But I don’t say that you eat meat, that’s not the point is.

01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.280
But those people, whatever they require they should eat,

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:52.760
but don’t eat meats of animals which are bigger than you.

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.880
Now what happens?

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.360
How the evolution in the animals takes place?

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.120
Nobody has put attention to that.

01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:05.400
Supposing there are many chickens you save.

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.520
I am not going to give Realization to chickens, am I?

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:12.920
Or to bugs, am I going to give Realization? Or to mosquitoes?

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:18.520
So our attention is on these, not on the higher level of life.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.080
When we think of food, that we must save chickens

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:26.480
actually nothing dies. Is Krishna Himself has said ‘Nothing dies’.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.480
All right?

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.720
And that’s how some people denied Krishna,

01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:35.200
because He had a samhara shakti, He used to kill.

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:39.160
And killing is so important in evolution.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.160
Otherwise if you don’t kill these rakshasas,

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.920
are you going to adore them?

01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:45.320
What are you to do with them?

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.960
They are to be killed they are to be thrown out.

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:51.920
In the evolutionary process also,

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.840
so many things have to die out for the real thing to come up.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:01.240
Say this flower has to die to become the fruit, all right?

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:04.440
And there is no ‘hinsa’ in it.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.520
The word ‘hinsa’ is so misinterpreted

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:12.520
that people are satisfied, if they do not eat meat. It's not true.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:17.120
For some people it is essential they must eat meat.

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:22.080
Now as you know, Sahaja Yoga works on the power of shakti.

01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:27.600
And the Devi not only killed raskshasas but She ate them!

01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:29.920
And She drank the blood

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:33.200
of these rakshasas as you know, Raktabija’s.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.360
So how can She be vegetarian?

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.280
Just tell Me. Put reason.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:42.920
All right?

01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.040
Because we are conditioned that way, we think.

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:51.480
But actually what happens, in the evolutionary process,

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.760
when a person, say, eats chicken,

01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:00.440
not person, we should say, a higher animal,

01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.400
eats a lower animal, then it passes through the circle

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.680
and achieves a higher life.

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:11.840
It's absolutely this is how evolution takes place.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:16.280
Of course, we can give Realization

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.560
to human beings so we need not worry about that.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.760
That’s a different point. But,

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:25.680
if you eat chicken, you definitely give it a higher life.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.080
But not the animals which are bigger than you.

01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.920
Smaller animals, if you eat, it’s

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:35.280
not going to be harmed by that. No doubt.

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.120
But you may be harmed.

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:40.680
For example, if you eat mosquitoes, you’ll be harmed!

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:47.640
Now in countries where there is not even any vegetable or anything,

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.000
they have not seen green leaves, like Greenland.

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:54.680
Now the name is ‘Greenland’, they have never seen green colour!

01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:03.080
Are they sinners that they can’t live without eating meat?

01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:08.000
How can God be so partial?

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:12.320
There are many countries where they cannot live without eating meat.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:16.800
So, there must be some reason. All right? So reason it out.

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.400
If you eat vegetables, all right.

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:24.040
If you want to eat meat, it’s all right.

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:29.240
But again for a Sahaja Yogi, what we decide is not

01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:32.720
on what you like, but what is good for you.

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.960
For example, for Western people it is better that they don’t eat

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.280
much meat now because, I think

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.440
they and their fathers have eaten all that.

01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:46.600
Eat less. There should have more carbohydrates, while

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.800
the vegetarians should take more proteins.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.680
If they do not like meat they should take to other proteins,

01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:54.240
because proteins are very important.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.640
If you do not take proteins in life, people suffer.

01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:02.600
In Sahaja Yoga we find such people have trouble from Left Nabhi.

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:06.000
I have seen in India, many people, who are strict vegetarians,

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:08.160
have a problem of Left Nabhi.

01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:10.800
So we told them, all right, you can eat proteins.

01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:12.640
There are so many proteins you can eat.

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.440
If you don’t like to eat meat from childhood, you have not eaten,

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.280
you don’t feel like eating, all right, forget it. Eat some.

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.600
We have to be wise, we have to be open,

01:38:22.120 --> 01:38:27.120
we are not to be bound by our conditioning from childhood.

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.440
This we must understand,

01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.760
that vegetarianism is not going to take you to God,

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:35.640
neither non-vegetarianism.

01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:40.520
Because the Spirit is neither a vegetarian nor a non-vegetarian.

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.760
It is a detached thing, it’s above food.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:47.920
But whatever you need for your body is important.

01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:50.400
If you need protein, eat protein.

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:53.520
If you don’t eat protein, don’t eat protein,

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:56.880
but then eat something which you need.

01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:02.480
So it is not that one has to understand it

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:08.880
in a way that we understand as a chicken and vegetables,

01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.960
but we must understand

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:15.360
in the way a doctor understands, proteins and carbohydrates.

01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.120
All right? Whatever you like, you can eat.

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.920
There’s no, in Sahaja Yoga there’s no such a compulsion.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:27.640
So many saints used to eat meat.

01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:32.240
So many saints. Guru Nanaka, Kabira, Mohammed-sahib,

01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:36.320
Christ, Rama Himself, Krishna Himself.

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:40.440
All of them ate meat. Even Buddha ate meat.

01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:44.560
The proof is that, at the end of His life,

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:49.160
He went to one of His disciples who was a hunter,

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:53.640
and He told him, “I am very hungry, give Me something to eat.”

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.040
So he said “Sir, I have nothing else but a wild boar

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.800
which I have killed very recently

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.200
and it is not yet fully cooked.”

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:03.720
So he said, “All right, doesn’t matter I’ll have it,”

01:40:04.040 --> 01:40:07.440
And He ate it and He died because of that

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:11.600
half-cooked wild boar.

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:15.040
And He died with that.

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:18.600
So now Buddhists think that, “We should not eat meat.” It’s not so.

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.960
Because He ate something that was half-cooked,

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.960
That means He did eat, isn’t it?

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:28.400
Even Jains know that, it’s only Neminath

01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:32.840
who got a kind of a feeling against meat eating.

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:35.320
That was Neminath, was at the time of,

01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.880
he was contemporary of Shri Krishna.

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:41.560
When his marriage was celebrated he found many birds

01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:44.080
were killed and he felt terrible about it

01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:47.600
and he didn’t want to eat any meat. Was all right.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.120
It’s all right. If you don’t feel like, don’t eat it.

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.760
But then a cult started.

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:57.000
But that means till Neminath, means, Jainis are ancient people,

01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:01.320
till Neminath they were eating meat – is a fact.

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.480
So to get attached to some idea

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:10.200
is not the way you are doing it.

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:12.880
If you don’t want to eat, just don’t eat it.

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:17.400
And if somebody has to eat it, because of health purposes

01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:21.120
or because of the need, there’s nothing wrong in it.

01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:24.040
Everybody has a different need,

01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:26.960
every individual has a different need

01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:31.160
If I, personally, take just to vegetarian food,

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.440
I won’t exist I can tell you.

01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:40.280
Because I have such a great capacity to have purges.

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.080
If I meet somebody, shake hands with somebody,

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.240
he has lots of bhoots you see,

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:49.360
then I just clear him out by purging.

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.960
And if I take just to say, carbohydrates,

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:56.960
I don’t know what will happen to Me.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:00.560
But doesn’t mean that I should be a meat eater,

01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:03.560
but I have to have proteins. That’s the point is.

01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:06.800
It’s no question of meat or anything but this is question

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:10.320
of eating proteins or carbohydrates.

01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:13.280
We have to be wise about it.

01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:15.360
And all such cults you see,

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.960
that “You eat this, you eat that”, is not so.

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.000
There is no cult in Sahaja Yoga.

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:24.600
Every individual has  a different personality,

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:29.120
but, the common thing is one, and that is the Spirit.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.440
But for example, drinking, we abhor.

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:38.560
But after Realization, before that I don’t talk of drinking.

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:42.320
Because it goes against your chaitanya, means your awareness.

01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.600
So one has to look after the awareness.

01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.360
So much time has been wasted in people in

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:51.040
deciding what to eat what not to eat.

01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:53.040
What have they achieved? Nothing!

01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.360
Sometimes I have seen vegetarians can be horrid people.

01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:03.600
Absolutely horrid. We have a community in India called Marwadis.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:08.400
They are blood suckers you see, and they are vegetarians.

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:13.960
Not all, we have some in Sahaja Yoga also, very few.

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:19.360
They are extremely money-minded people, you know that.

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:23.760
So, this kind of thing, to believe that

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:27.080
such food will make us great is, will be falsehood.

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.920
So you don’t decide on that.

01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:31.880
You decide on proteins and carbohydrates.

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:36.200
Whatever good for your health, you should do.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.360
Those who eat too much of vegetarian food

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:43.280
are liable to certain type of diseases

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:47.280
and those who eat too much of non-veg are liable to some.

01:43:49.040 --> 01:43:53.880
Those who eat vegetarian food can get leucoderma very easily,

01:43:54.880 --> 01:44:00.520
can get leukemia very easily.

01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:04.920
Certain types of cancers they can get very easily.

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:08.400
Those who are non-vegetarians can get another kind of diseases.

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.040
There are numerous diseases they can get.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:14.040
So we have to have a balance,

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:17.520
that when we eat vegetarian food also, we must see that we eat

01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:21.880
sufficiently, sufficient amount of proteins,

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.600
because body has to be all right.

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:30.480
Healthy body is the temple of God,

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:35.120
and to temple of God, you have to keep it healthy and happy.

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:39.200
That’s the attitude. But it’s not so important,

01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.800
because once you get into Sahaja Yoga, as it is,

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.440
automatically doctors' bill drops to nil.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:46.960
Automatically.

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.760
So we have to take a wise attitude towards ourselves.

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:54.480
Not to torture ourselves because of certain conditionings.

01:44:55.120 --> 01:44:57.160
Because we have been taught something from childhood

01:44:57.280 --> 01:45:00.200
we should not accept it, but see for ourselves.

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:03.480
I have seen that people who had

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.880
tremendous stigmas about vegetarian food,

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:10.600
when they took to, say, protein food,

01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:14.000
they improved very much in vibrations. They did.

01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:17.200
Protein food is very important for certain people

01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.600
and for certain people carbohydrates.

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:23.360
Liverish people should take to carbohydrates.

01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:29.040
It is absolutely an open thing for us to understand.

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:33.600
But whatever goes against our awareness,

01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:38.200
because in our own awareness we have to achieve our Spirit,

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:41.720
we drop out that, also, very easily.

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:44.160
I don’t have to say that, “Don’t drink! Don’t smoke!”

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.360
You just drop out.

01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:55.720
Mother, Bernard Shaw, a very distinguished Irish writer

01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:58.920
apparently once said that he doesn’t like his stomach

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.800
to be graveyard out of dead animals.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:05.200
Now Bernard Shaw did not give Realization to anyone, did he?

01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.640
He was very great and a vegetarian.

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:09.560
You see, he might become vegetarian

01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:12.360
doesn’t mean that everybody should, is it?

01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:16.960
It’s not a graveyard. I tell you, it’s not a graveyard.

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.920
He must be constipated.

01:46:22.280 --> 01:46:25.880
That’s all I can say. You see Bernard Shaw,

01:46:26.080 --> 01:46:28.880
is all right whatever he said. According to his own is correct.

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.320
For him it may be.

01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.560
You see most of the vegetarians

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.840
have a problem and non-vegetarians have a problem.

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.280
I have seen it every day in My life.

01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.520
Today is not Bernard Shaw here, otherwise

01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:44.000
I would have told him what he suffered from.

01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.880
You see it is, whatever they express in their individual experience.

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:53.000
All right? I am not expressing an individual experience,

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.840
I am giving you an experience of many. All right?

01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:00.720
I get your point that one should eat proteins.

01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:03.640
Are you saying that vegetarian food doesn’t have proteins?

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:08.880
What is it? Yes, you can. So you should eat. When did I say no?

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.320
I never said, that if you can eat, eat proteins, finished.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:16.680
It should be decided on proteins and carbohydrates,

01:47:16.840 --> 01:47:20.360
and not on all these things because nobody dies.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.640
You see, we have no compassion for our own fellow being.

01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:34.560
Where are we? We have no compassion for our own relations,

01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.680
our own father, our own mother,

01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:41.080
our own brothers and sisters and other people.

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.280
And what’s the use of having compassion on things

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:48.080
which do not understand at all?

01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:53.160
And they don’t need it! Who needs compassion, are human beings,

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:55.720
who are aware of it.

01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:00.880
It is too far fetched, and that is very true with human mind,

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:03.520
because they want to shift their mind to something

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.760
which will take them away from Reality.

01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:08.720
Like the other day I told somebody not to feel guilty

01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:11.120
because they were catching on the Left Vishuddhi.

01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:14.160
And she said, “I feel guilty”. I said, “For what?”

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:16.800
“I feel guilty for Vietnam”. I said “For what?”

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.960
“Because the people are dying in Vietnam,”

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:22.080
I said, “Are you going to solve the problem of Vietnam?

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:26.680
Are you concerned with it? Why are you worried about that?”

01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:32.080
You do whatever is good for you,

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:37.000
and what you can do. This is how we shift our mind.

01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:41.320
And it’s very true, you see. People have their accepted ideas,

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:45.400
they stick onto it, and get nothing.

01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:51.480
So I say that there should be no ‘ism’ about anything.

01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:54.320
You must have an open mind.

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.280
Absolutely an open mind.

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:04.600
Anybody who, whatever problems they have,

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:08.200
they know, and they should solve it.

01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:15.280
I am not here to spread vegetarianism or non-vegetarianism,

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:18.360
I am here to spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:22.200
"Sahaja Samadhi Lago”. That’s what is said.

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:25.200
You have to get your samadhi.

01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:29.720
And that how do you get? Sahaj, spontaneous.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:34.760
It depends, it depends what we eat, you see.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.960
How will we get samadi if we do not have proper food or anything?

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:43.160
Now, I will say that, I’ve already told you about Buddha.

01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:47.520
What do you think of Guru Nanak?
What do you think of Christ?

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:50.560
You think, were they any way lower?

01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:54.600
You see because the Spirit is not concerned. As Krishna has said,

01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:58.200
"Nainam chindanti shastrani nainam dahati pavakah

01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:02.160
na chainam kledayanty apo na sosayati marutah". (meaning: The Spirit cannot be cut or burned, nor moistened nor blown)

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:06.200
It is Shri Krishna himself has said it.

01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.480
And He Himself has killed rakshasas and Jainis are against

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:12.040
Shri Krishna because He killed rakshashas.

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:15.280
According to him He’s a hinsatmak (aggressive) fellow.

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:18.320
If you go too far with it, then you go to that limit,

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:22.480
where you start saving bugs and mosquitoes.

01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:26.880
But we have got it, we have got Realization, no doubt about it.

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:31.200
First of all you get your Realization. You have had all these ideas,

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:34.440
all our forefathers had these ideas, they never got Realization.

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:38.080
All right? So forget it. First thing is get to your Spirit.

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:41.560
This is not important, this is just you are directing your attention

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.280
to something else which is not important.

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:50.960
So many of them. So we discard Mohammed-sahib, we discard everyone.

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:55.440
That’s how it is, it’s Brahmanism,

01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:00.560
it's Brahmanism. It’s ‘ism’ again.

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:04.480
We discard all the great people of the world by this.

01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:08.320
They were not realized? Kahlil Gibran was he not realized?

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.920
How will you know?

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:12.720
Unless and until you are realized

01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:14.840
you will not know who is realized or not.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:18.280
You will live on these ideas only.

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:22.560
You have to feel it. William Blake, was he not realized?

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:26.240
He was Markandeya Himself.

01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:32.640
We have forgotten so many things. Even in the Indian Scriptures

01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:35.760
we never see, we don’t want to see these things.

01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:40.680
We had a great saint in India, called Sajan Kasai.

01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:50.800
So one should understand, that in Sahaja Yoga,

01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:56.480
whatever is the Reality, we try to accept. See for yourself.

01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:00.200
What about your vibrations? Are you getting vibrations or not?

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:03.280
That’s the main point is. Attention should be there.

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:06.160
Actually vegetarians have much more attention on food

01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:08.640
than the non-veg have. I can tell you this fact.

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:11.720
And the women of vegetarian people

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:15.840
are all the time busy, what to make for their men.

01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:19.560
All the time they are planning what to have

01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:21.680
“Aaj papad banaye ki falana banaye ki…?”

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:24.440
They are all the time busy cooking, cooking, cooking.

01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:28.480
And the men are also all the time fussing about food.

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:30.840
“In that house I ate that karela.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:34.000
In that house I ate this, you better make that.”

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:36.760
All our Indian men I know too well.

01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:40.080
And I know all the vegetarians. I am from that country.

01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:43.040
And the women are busy with that and men are busy with that.

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:46.760
All their attention is in food all the time.

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:51.480
Women want to cook and men want to enjoy.

01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:53.120
That’s not the way.

01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:55.720
Remove your attention from food, it’s not important.

01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:58.680
Whatever you are eating is all right. Have a balanced diet.

01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:00.880
Don’t worry about others.

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:03.200
You are not forced to eat anything in Sahaja Yoga.

01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:06.200
Nothing is forced, but you eat what you like.

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:12.360
But the thing that you like must be balanced,

01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:18.040
must be proper, must be health giving.

01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:21.560
That is the point is. Whatever you eat, you eat.

01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:26.120
Nothing is forced. You have to see for yourself.

01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:29.960
So many of Sahaja yogis just don’t eat meat at all.

01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:32.480
I mean they just don’t eat, and they need not eat at all,

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:34.240
there’s no need.

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:37.560
I mean if you don’t want to eat, just don’t eat it!

01:53:37.800 --> 01:53:42.200
It’s not importan. [missing part] All your quality is tested,

01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:45.840
when your Kundalini is awakened.

01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:49.080
Before that you do not know.

01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:52.280
I've known of people, they think, oh, they are very great.

01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:54.880
Like one sanyasi fellow came in,

01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:57.760
and he was sitting on the dais (stage)

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:00.840
and he thinks, oh, he is a great man,

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:04.080
he’s the very big man and all that.

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:08.000
And my grandchild who’s a realized soul, she was sitting in front,

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.720
and I was the guest of honour there, so I was sitting there.

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.760
So she shouted from her seat,

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:15.280
She said, “Mother, ask this man with the maxi to get out

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:17.360
he’s giving too much heat to us!”

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:20.480
And this fellow was going to talk on vegetarianism,

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:22.760
this that "ism", another "ism" and religion

01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:24.960
and God and this and that.

01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.960
And she said, “Please ask him to get out!

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.960
He’s giving heat to us this maxi-fellow.”

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:30.880
She has thought he's a maxi-man.

01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:35.200
She didn’t know he was, he was supposed to be detached.

01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:40.080
Those so-called ‘sanyasis’, be careful.

01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:44.360
So-called ‘vegetarians’, they are such hot-tempered people.

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.840
Aren’t you hot-tempered!

01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:54.400
So what you manifest is the point,

01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.320
and manifestation is silent. It works.

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.960
So, “Somebody said so”, “Another fellow said so”,

01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:10.600
So what? What about you? What have you to say?

01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:15.920
What have you manifested?

01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:19.240
Have you got the powers of your Spirit?

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:23.720
Ask a question to yourself. That’s the first thing you achieve.

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.040
Then we’ll talk about these things.

01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:29.640
First of all you achieve your Spirit.

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:45.320
This is the first time people are achieving their Spirit, isn’t it?

01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:48.160
This is the first time it’s happening.

01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:50.160
So you cannot have

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:54.440
any relationship with anything else, you can say.

01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.440
This is an absolute thing that should happen

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:00.160
and that you should ask for.

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.480
Because somebody said so, because this was so.

01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:04.440
What? What have they done?

01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:08.160
Did they manifest their Spirit?

01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:12.760
All right, they did, one or two, here and there.

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:16.800
So first, get your Spirit manifested.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.800
Don’t get lost into these things. Be kind to yourself.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.680
First be ‘vegetarian’ to yourself,

01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:25.760
by being kind and by getting your Spirit

01:56:25.880 --> 01:56:29.280
liberated completely from all these ideas.

01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:32.320
Spirit is a reality, it’s not an idea,

01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:36.080
and it cannot be nourished by any idea,

01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:40.320
except Reality, which you face yourself and manifest.

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.520
Mother, what should we do get the Spirit?

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:46.480
What should we do get the Spirit? What should we do?

01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:49.000
That’s what I said, you don’t have to do anything.

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:51.600
That’s what you should do.

01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:55.920
The Kundalini has to rise, all right?

01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:59.040
Now what does this lamp do, when it is to be enlightened?

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:02.240
The another enlightened light comes near it and manifests this.

01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.120
You are all ready for it. All right?

01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:08.480
Only thing , the Kundalini has to be awakened and it works out.

01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:11.680
Anybody who is enlightened can give you Realization.

01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:15.760
You want us to work it out on you? We’ll try.

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:19.360
All of you who haven’t go Realization so far,

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:22.040
we can try that. Not today,

01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:27.920
I’m sorry but, because the time is up, I think.

01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:31.760
You have to go to our ashrams

01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:34.680
where people are doing this work and

01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:38.280
you all are going to feel the Realization.

01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:45.120
I used to do that before. In every programme we did it.

01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:49.280
All of them got their Realization, in the programmes only.

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:53.320
And if the Kundalini is not coming up,

01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:55.880
they will tell you what’s the problem is.

01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:58.000
All right? Try to do that.

01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:00.760
Help yourself. You have to co-operate with yourself.

01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:03.600
You are not to get identified with

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:06.920
some wrong ideas or right ideas or whatever you think.

01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:11.520
It is the Kundalini which is not moving. That’s the main point is.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:16.360
Every Indian knows that the Kundalini has to be awakened

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:20.480
to get to Atma Sakshatkar, to get to Self-Realization.

01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:23.480
And if the Kundalini is not moving then there’s a problem.

01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:27.680
And what is that problem? That these people know.

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:31.240
All right? So just co-operate with yourself.

01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:34.280
Be humble about it, it has to work out.

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:38.320
Thik hai na? (Ok?)

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.760
Zarur (absolutely).

01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:43.320
Aasha ruk lijiye, aisa hath rukhiye. (keep hope, hands like this)

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:45.400
Just see, you will work it. It will work out as

01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:48.800
It flows as Chaitanya Lahari in the hands.

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:55.920
I mean, I would say people like

01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:00.120
Adi Shankaracharya,

01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:03.320
who was such a great person but he had to take to sanyasa

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.600
because he had to do the work.

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:08.080
He’s the one, he said, “Na yoge, na sukhe na"

01:59:08.280 --> 01:59:10.920
by any thinking you do not get it.

01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:14.040
You get it by Mother’s grace.”

01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:18.120
So simple he writes. But look at him,

01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:23.080
when his mother died, they would not allow him to burn the body,

01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:26.760
because they said a sanyasi cannot burn. See this is also an idea.

01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:30.240
A sanyasi cannot burn - the idea of a grihasta (householder).

01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:33.160
Another idea, you see. Same type.

01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:38.200
So they say, that he burned the body of his mother

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:41.720
with the banana tree, which never burn.

01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:45.920
And he cursed... I mean they said that he did not curse, but

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:49.720
it was cursed that they will all bury their dead in their houses.

01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:54.280
And even today you find in Kerala, they do it.

01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:03.000
So, so many people with these ideas have killed so many saints.

02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:06.560
Do not have fixed ideas.

02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:11.920
Sai Nath, so many people

02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:15.960
Sai Nath, they say that, many people say that

02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:20.720
Sai Nath was a realized soul. Not this new one but the Sai Nath.

02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.880
But he was a Muslim.

02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:29.120
Kabira was a Muslim

02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:33.000
Still, Nanaka included him in this Guru Granth Sahib.

02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:37.520
Only a realized person can understand who is a realized person.

02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:42.600
Before that, talking about it is just a mental feat.

02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.280
By mental feat you are not going to go there.

02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:48.920
Aren’t you tired already of your mental feats? Aren’t you?

02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:52.880
Thinking, thinking, thinking mad?

02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:56.960
One doctor once said, “Mother, you cut my throat,

02:00:57.080 --> 02:01:00.880
do what you like, but stop this thinking.”

02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:09.400
So give up all these ideas that are yours.

02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:16.280
Achieve the Reality, achieve the Reality.

02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:20.240
That is, also, you cannot achieve it,

02:01:20.480 --> 02:01:22.440
the Kundalini is to be awakened,

02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:25.000
somebody will awaken for you,

02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.440
and once you get it, you can it do for others.

02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:30.720
You can awaken others. There are so many

02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:32.360
who have given Realization here.

02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:36.680
these people are looking so simple and ignorant

02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:39.720
but they know all about it. They are experts.

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:43.600
Immediately as you were talking, they were all giving

02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:47.040
bandhan on your chakras that were catching.

02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:51.800
They all know. You do not know but they know. All right?

02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:55.560
So with humility you must go and receive your Realization,

02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:59.000
learn all about it and then you give Realization to another person.

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:01.480
That’s the main thing we have to do today.

02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:05.720
We are not here to save bugs, mosquitoes and chickens!

02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:28.280
I hope nobody is coming out about the support of

02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:32.320
smoking some horrible thing like hashish or...

02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:35.160
They smoke or eat I don’t know.

02:02:36.520 --> 02:02:41.640
Like we had a big letter from someone who says that,

02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:44.880
“Mother, people will never understand You unless and until

02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:48.240
they smoke... What is, what is it?

02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:50.720
No, cannabis”.

02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:53.520
I don’t know what is that supposed to be, but they said that,

02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:57.520
“Without that, they cannot understand You and Sahaja Yoga.”

02:02:57.880 --> 02:03:00.680
[Hindi]

02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:15.480
All right? how many have felt cool breeze, the new people?

02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:18.520
Let’s see.

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:22.200
Cool breeze?

02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:25.120
Did you feel the cool breeze in the hands?

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:29.560
Yes, I know. Who else? What about you?

02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:32.560
Great. You?

02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:38.160
I am asking this lady.

02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.000
You have felt it? Great. What about you?

02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:44.880
Great. Aab dekhiye, ye logon vegetarian nahi,

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:50.040
aur unko cool breeze aa raha, aur aap ko nahi aa. (meaning: now look,
these people aren’t vegetarians but they felt it and you didn't!)

02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:52.440
What about you?

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:54.560
Are you feeling cool breeze or not?

02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:58.880
I have already done that. I have had this before.

02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:00.000
But you have lost it.

02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:00.960
No I have not.

02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:02.600
You are getting it now?

02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:04.000
I already had it.

02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:05.120
You never had it.

02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:06.480
I have had it.

02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:08.560
And then what is the situation just now?

02:04:08.760 --> 02:04:10.440
My hands are cool! Is that so?

02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.320
No, just see, if he is realized, on top of his head.

02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:17.760
He’s catching on his liver. Hot?

02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.840
All right. That’s the compassion!

02:04:24.480 --> 02:04:27.120
The proof of the pudding is there.

02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:33.520
All right. What about you? How did you feel? Good.

02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:37.960
What about you? You were very tensed. What is the problem with you?

02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.680
I've come so early when [unclear].

02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:43.040
And then you got nervous.

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:44.920
I've come really in tense, very much.

02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:47.960
And then what happened? You started thinking about it?

02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:50.680
No, I start feeling [about pain] and uncomfortable.

02:04:50.840 --> 02:04:53.560
I start feeling uncomfortable physically.

02:04:53.720 --> 02:04:54.840
What is it?

02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:57.280
He's not feeling physically comfortable from [unclear].

02:04:57.440 --> 02:05:00.160
I know, then you sit on a chair, there’s no compulsion.

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.880
Please. No, no, you'll be all right.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.360
I tell you, you’ll be better off.

02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:06.120
We have no compulsion like that. You please be seated.

02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:08.440
Yes, come. Come along, sit on the chair. All right.

02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:11.480
That’s a good idea! There is no compulsion.

02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:13.440
You see because the hall is smaller,

02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:16.000
they thought there will be many people so they spread this.

02:05:16.160 --> 02:05:18.240
There’s no compulsion, whether you sit on a chair

02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:20.800
or a throne make no difference.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.400
Makes no difference, it’s not that.

02:05:22.600 --> 02:05:25.960
You see it is the Kundalini is inside, in subtler being,

02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:29.160
it doesn’t mean where you sit.

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:32.120
Of course it helps, if you sit on the ground, in a way,

02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:34.160
because the Mother Earth helps you, you see.

02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:36.400
If you sit before the light it helps you also.

02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:39.120
That’s a different point. But if you can’t sit on the ground,

02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:40.880
doesn’t matter.

02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:44.600
We have given Realization to people only on sitting on chairs.

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:51.880
Yes. What to do? All of you got it sitting on chairs, isn’t it?

02:05:53.800 --> 02:05:56.240
About four hundred people, in Vienna,

02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:59.800
got it just like that, sitting on chairs.

02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:03.320
It happens. If it has not happened,

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:06.560
it should happen to every one of you.

02:06:07.880 --> 02:06:11.760
[unclear]

02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.960
You tell something more about Kundalini [unclear].

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:17.880
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:19.560
There are so many lectures of Mine.

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:23.120
Today, you see, because I am going away, I’m rather quite full.

02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:27.200
And there are so many lectures I have given on Kundalini,

02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:30.440
you don’t know, I must have spoken at least thousand times.

02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:34.440
In Caxton Hall itself at least six hundred times.

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:38.560
So there are lectures and lectures, you can see, listen to them.

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:42.680
But it is Kundalini, by that listening to it, nothing will happen.

02:06:42.880 --> 02:06:47.040
Actually it’s an actualisation. You see it’s like a seed sprouting.

02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:50.360
So by the, talking about Kundalini, nothing happens.

02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:53.520
It has to raise. [Hindi/Marathi]

02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:57.360
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:05.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:08.560
Shivaji Maharaj and Rana Pratap,

02:07:08.760 --> 02:07:11.440
they were all kshatriyas and they used to eat meat.

02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:13.120
What do you think of Shivaji Maharaj?

02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:17.400
Was he a bad man by any chance? Or Rana Pratap?

02:07:17.680 --> 02:07:20.680
They were not spiritual. They were not spiritual people.

02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:21.920
They were?

02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.040
Not spiritual.

02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:24.680
Who? Shivaji?

02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:27.480
Oh, he was very spiritual. That’s the trouble.

02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:29.320
Because you are not a realized soul,

02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:31.760
you cannot feel their vibrations.

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.520
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:36.880
They are not all, those who take that flag that they are spiritual,

02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:40.200
they are not, mostly. Mostly they are not.

02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:44.640
Mostly they are not, beti. You see, they are very simple people.

02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:47.920
They can be kings, they can be anybody.

02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:52.920
We never understand them, unless and until we have Realization.

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:58.040
Shri Rama was understood by Shabari,

02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:02.200
but His own father never knew who He was.

02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:11.120
The understanding of the Spirit comes from Spirit only.

02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:12.920
[Sanskrit] (meaning: “Spirit is satisfied by Itself”)

02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:16.560
Atma should know atma, nothing else.

02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:20.480
Through your mental attitude you cannot reach there.

02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:24.000
It’s the Atma knows Atma.

02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:26.240
You ask about Shivaji, all of you ask,

02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:29.880
“Was he a realized soul?” See the vibrations you get.

02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:37.320
Now they can know. Was he?

02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:41.520
Absolutely.

02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:47.720
Now ask, “Was Blake a realized soul?”

02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.200
Was he?

02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:01.080
You can feel it.

02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:08.720
It’s sometimes shocking you know,

02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:12.480
to find out about people who are supposed to be very spiritual,

02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:15.400
are not even realized souls, so many!

02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:19.080
Are you from Vallabhacharya? No.

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:22.200
Vallabhacharya was a great realized soul.

02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:26.800
And when Surdas went to him and he said...

02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:28.680
Surdas is supposed to be very spiritual,

02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:30.880
but he was not a realized soul.

02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:33.480
So Vallabhacharya said to him,

02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:37.640
“Why are you weeping like a baby for God?

02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:43.960
I have found Him. The one who has found doesn’t weep”.

02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:49.320
Spiritual person is that who has found the Spirit.

02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.680
You still find it is not spiritual.

02:09:51.880 --> 02:09:54.560
Maybe spiritual in the way that his attitude is,

02:09:54.760 --> 02:09:56.600
but he must find it.

02:09:57.160 --> 02:10:00.800
Then only he’s a really, a spiritual person.

02:10:06.480 --> 02:10:09.120
Even an ordinary person could be a realized soul

02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:11.440
and the king may not be.

02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:13.280
We have so many like this.

02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:15.360
We have so many misnomers in our country

02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.960
if you find out, in every country.

02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:21.000
Here also, so many are called as ‘saints’,

02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:23.600
and horrible vibrations come from them.

02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:27.760
They are ‘saints’ you know. Saint this, saint that.

02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.320
I don’t know, saints or satans but they are something like that!

02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:37.400
And there are people who are real saints, nobody knows about them!

02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:40.440
How will you make out?

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:46.280
Only through Atma. The Spirit knows the Spirit.

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:51.600
Not through mental activity, outward things,

02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:56.600
but through the knowledge that is manifesting,

02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:01.840
the knowledge of Reality, you know the Spirit.

02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:04.680
There’s no other way out.

02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:09.760
That’s a fact.

02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:16.360
All other things are useless

02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:22.200
because, whatever you do in ignorance, are useless.

02:11:22.720 --> 02:11:25.920
But when you have the knowledge of the Spirit

02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:28.520
then you do it

02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:32.800
with your absolute value.

02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:39.280
It does not know any race, any creed, any colour, nothing!

02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:42.160
It knows vibrations.

02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:53.240
Is described, everything is described.

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:00.920
So now, what should we do now at the end when I’m going now?

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:04.120
Would you like to sing a song to Me? Will they allow us.

02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:07.760
Jerusalem Shri Mataji.

02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:10.560
All right. Close the door. I think they should not say that

02:12:10.800 --> 02:12:14.120
we have misused their liberties.

02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:25.080
[Hindi/Marathi]

02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:43.000
Who will sing it?

02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:48.280
Who will start?

02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:24.720
Thank you very much.
