08:20.012 --> 08:28.751
Today we have gathered here to do
the Sahastrara puja.

08:29.743 --> 08:36.923
Sahastrar, the word ‘sahastr’, in Sanskrit
language, means ‘one thousand’.

08:37.124 --> 08:47.585
And there are one thousand petals
in our brain, which get enlightened.

08:47.786 --> 08:54.230
Of course, the doctors are quarrelling
on that point, but forget about them.

08:54.524 --> 09:02.403
Now these petals are kept ready
for our enlightenment,

09:03.309 --> 09:11.364
and these are really the nerves,
one thousand nerves,

09:11.565 --> 09:16.975
which are there for the enlightenment
of the brain.

09:17.483 --> 09:28.692
So when the Kundalini rises, she enlightens
those one thousand nerves

09:28.893 --> 09:37.985
which become like a –

09:38.186 --> 09:50.486
as you see here, the shape of these
flames – like a petal.

09:51.311 --> 10:00.981
And that’s why it is called as ‘Sahastrara’
- is the centre of Sahastrara.

10:01.182 --> 10:08.970
In the human beings it is a very important
centre,

10:09.171 --> 10:16.465
because this is the only centre by which
we think

10:16.666 --> 10:24.564
and we try to stop whatever we don’t like.

10:25.358 --> 10:33.028
This is the centre which reacts, reacts
in such a manner

10:33.229 --> 10:41.067
that, without any discretion we start
saying, ‘no’ to this, and, ‘no’ to that,

10:41.268 --> 10:46.549
on small things also. Like somebody might
say, “I don’t like this carpet,”

10:46.750 --> 10:51.546
“I don’t like this house,” “I don’t
like that.”

10:54.824 --> 11:00.838
This language itself shows that – who
are you? First find out!

11:01.039 --> 11:05.753
But you cannot become yourself unless
and until this Sahastrara,

11:05.954 --> 11:14.832
this brain is opened out and the Kundalini
becomes one with the Paramchaitanya.

11:16.864 --> 11:26.001
Before that, you are in complete ignorance
about what is good and what is bad.

11:26.202 --> 11:32.269
Whatever you think [that], for this brain,
is good, you do it.

11:32.470 --> 11:37.127
But whatever is really good, you do
not know,

11:37.328 --> 11:41.510
because you do not know the Reality.

11:42.542 --> 11:47.225
Now we have to understand the consciousness
that we have:

11:47.426 --> 11:54.019
consciousness of being alive, consciousness
of so many things we have,

11:54.220 --> 11:59.673
and the so-called knowledge we have
about everything.

12:00.252 --> 12:07.094
All that consciousness is stored near
the liver – for your information –

12:07.340 --> 12:10.271
by this diaphragm.

12:10.472 --> 12:15.998
But then, this consciousness starts rising,
higher and higher.

12:16.199 --> 12:20.731
Then you become aware. In the evolutionary
process,

12:20.932 --> 12:25.985
you become aware, aware of things.

12:26.186 --> 12:33.524
Without going through your brain, you just
become aware. And how?

12:33.725 --> 12:39.519
Not by thinking, not by understanding
or seeing,

12:39.720 --> 12:45.817
but you become aware because
your brain has now

12:46.018 --> 12:53.251
started working in a manner that’s very,
very sensitive.

12:53.452 --> 12:59.262
So you just become aware of some sort
of a fear,

12:59.463 --> 13:06.107
or maybe some sort of a goodness
or anything. But it goes even further.

13:06.308 --> 13:11.489
The growth of consciousness, which becomes
aware, goes further:

13:11.690 --> 13:21.702
where you start liking a person,
or disliking a person.

13:23.473 --> 13:28.741
But, still it’s nothing definite and sure.

13:28.942 --> 13:33.377
You dislike a person because he has
a particular type of a face,

13:33.578 --> 13:37.336
maybe eyes or maybe anything.

13:38.309 --> 13:45.365
Or maybe because you have known
somebody who has been very nice,

13:45.566 --> 13:51.693
so you start transferring that image
onto others.

13:51.894 --> 13:59.940
With these transferred images, you can
hate or love someone.

14:00.141 --> 14:05.843
Then you start saying, “I hate this,
I hate that,”

14:06.395 --> 14:11.093
which has no, actually, substantial
meaning.

14:11.294 --> 14:19.821
You hate it because, perhaps, maybe such
and such person looks like somebody.

14:20.178 --> 14:24.240
Now you go further with it, then you see
that, such and such person –

14:24.441 --> 14:28.088
now I’m not talking about things, but
about persons -

14:28.289 --> 14:35.901
such and such person has done this harm to me
- something positive (may mean "negative").

14:36.102 --> 14:42.250
So you start feeling that you should hate
that person.

14:42.955 --> 14:46.601
Now you start hating that person.
With that hatred

14:46.802 --> 14:51.216
you develop new faculties [of] how to harm
that person.

14:51.417 --> 14:55.663
Then you start thinking how to destroy
that person,

14:55.864 --> 15:01.243
how to make his life miserable.

15:01.444 --> 15:07.174
Then you may beat that person, you may
shout at that person,

15:07.375 --> 15:11.452
you may try to kill that person. You can
do anything.

15:11.653 --> 15:17.026
So now the awareness is going towards
another direction, which is darkness,

15:17.227 --> 15:22.862
which is not light, because in the light
you won’t do such a thing.

15:23.063 --> 15:28.940
In the light you see everybody, everybody
is sitting, you know how far you are,

15:29.141 --> 15:34.182
where you are sitting. If you want to go
out, you know how to walk out.

15:34.383 --> 15:39.193
But when, in the darkness you are there,
you just don’t understand

15:39.394 --> 15:47.133
and you go on behaving in a manner
which is, which cannot be explained

15:47.334 --> 15:51.536
otherwise, except that, because you are
a human being.

15:51.737 --> 15:56.784
Animals don’t do like that. Animals have
limitation [on them].

15:56.985 --> 16:03.775
The animals, if they find something wrong,
something absolutely

16:03.982 --> 16:08.917
harmful done to them, then they will attack
or run away,

16:09.118 --> 16:14.139
but they do not carry a kind of a hatred
or anything.

16:14.340 --> 16:18.862
But they can carry the impression of fear,
could be,

16:19.063 --> 16:25.134
of some sort of a harm done to them.
But human beings are not like that.

16:25.335 --> 16:34.683
Human beings don’t have any particular
reason, as such, to hate someone.

16:34.884 --> 16:41.619
But why it works out? Because they are
involved in their ego.

16:41.820 --> 16:51.163
Egoistical person feels that he has a right
to do what he wants to do:

16:51.396 --> 16:58.201
he can kill anybody, he can bomb anyone,
he can do whatever he likes.

16:59.090 --> 17:04.602
But a person who is not doing that,
is the other way round:

17:04.803 --> 17:09.644
he is frightened, he is afraid of someone.

17:09.845 --> 17:14.639
Now the awareness moves on. This is
a subtler awareness,

17:14.840 --> 17:21.685
because, if you are afraid of somebody,
you would not like to go to his house,

17:21.886 --> 17:27.364
you will avoid him in the street,
all things you can do.

17:27.565 --> 17:32.066
So all this kind of knowledge about other
human beings also

17:32.267 --> 17:35.743
accumulates in your mind.

17:35.944 --> 17:45.094
Then this thing starts working on
a collective level,

17:45.295 --> 17:49.756
because you think, “This group is very bad.
They are good.

17:49.957 --> 17:54.780
These are bad. They are excellent!”
like that, it works out.

17:54.981 --> 18:01.716
In your own mind you think that somebody
has a group,

18:01.917 --> 18:06.273
and the other group is better or that group
is better.

18:06.474 --> 18:16.334
And collectively, then, you start working
out your whole temperament, your awareness.

18:16.535 --> 18:20.578
Like once people decide that say,
for example,

18:20.779 --> 18:28.597
that black people are to be finished,
so all the white people can join together.

18:28.798 --> 18:36.782
Or like at the time of Hitler, he decided
that all other human beings but Germans

18:36.983 --> 18:42.184
were useless. So he gathered people around
his thought and ideas.

18:42.385 --> 18:47.305
And this collective awareness just
comes to,

18:47.506 --> 18:51.524
I don’t know how, but it enters into
the minds of many.

18:51.725 --> 18:57.174
They never challenge it, they never ask
[about] it, whether it is correct or not.

18:57.375 --> 19:04.000
So this grows more and more and more,
and then it becomes like a –

19:04.597 --> 19:10.673
country-wise, you can say – an awareness
of this kind of a feeling.

19:10.874 --> 19:20.416
But whether it is correct or not is not
understood, is not known.

19:20.617 --> 19:26.060
So, what is important [is] that you should
know Reality,

19:26.261 --> 19:30.881
you should know exactly what is right
and what is wrong.

19:31.082 --> 19:41.018
For that, as I told you, there is this
great power of Kundalini within you.

19:41.573 --> 19:44.707
She is the one, She passes through
all these centres,

19:44.908 --> 19:51.153
enlightens them first of all, so your
awareness gets enlightened.

19:51.354 --> 19:56.798
And when She pierces through Sahastrara,
She joins you

19:56.999 --> 20:05.274
to this All-pervading Power which is
Knowledge,

20:06.567 --> 20:13.399
which is love, which is Truth.

20:14.845 --> 20:19.207
So, after that, you immediately know –

20:19.864 --> 20:24.029
some people don’t know immediately,
but some people do –

20:24.230 --> 20:33.029
that what we have been thinking so far,
of separating ourselves from others

20:33.230 --> 20:37.182
by thinking they are not all right, they are
wrong, they are whatever it is –

20:37.383 --> 20:41.460
this disappears. This disappears
completely,

20:41.661 --> 20:45.413
and then you realise that your awareness
itself,

20:45.619 --> 20:51.050
awareness itself is dominated by so many
other circumstances.

20:51.251 --> 20:55.257
For example, where you were born, what
your parents taught you,

20:55.458 --> 20:58.354
what experiences you have had.

20:58.555 --> 21:03.583
And then you realise that it was all wrong,
because it’s not Reality.

21:03.784 --> 21:09.079
Whatever feelings you have, whatever
ideas you have

21:09.280 --> 21:16.539
about another person or about other nation,
all of them are not correct.

21:16.740 --> 21:24.597
Because now your Sahastrara is awakened,
that it is connected now

21:24.798 --> 21:31.283
to the All-pervading Power. So this
starts flowing into you.

21:31.484 --> 21:40.534
This - I should say - enlightened awareness,
it starts flowing down into your being,

21:40.735 --> 21:48.774
in your brain, and then on your nerves
you can feel that awareness.

21:48.975 --> 21:55.152
Now once you want to know about something,
whether it is right or wrong –

21:55.353 --> 21:58.970
absolute right and wrong, it’s not [a]
question of relative –

21:59.171 --> 22:04.024
you just have to put your hands towards
that person,

22:04.225 --> 22:07.214
or towards that thing or whatever it is:

22:07.415 --> 22:11.994
immediately on these vibrations you
will know.

22:12.195 --> 22:16.922
So what are these vibrations, is this
Paramachaitanya,

22:17.123 --> 22:24.009
we call it ‘Brahmachaitanya’, which starts
flowing through your finger tips.

22:24.215 --> 22:29.149
Now you start feeling what chakras
they are catching,

22:29.350 --> 22:36.613
whether they are right or wrong, and your
discretion improves immensely.

22:36.814 --> 22:40.536
The brain, which was putting you
in delusions

22:40.737 --> 22:45.399
and wrong type of life, immediately
corrects itself.

22:45.600 --> 22:51.087
For example, I’m walking in a place
with my eyes closed,

22:51.288 --> 22:57.972
and there is a big ditch. I can’t see it,
I’m just walking.

22:58.173 --> 23:01.416
And suddenly I open my eyes and see
the ditch:

23:01.617 --> 23:05.542
immediately I know it’s wrong and I give up
and come away.

23:05.743 --> 23:11.573
In the same way it happens to you when
your Sahastrara is enlightened.

23:11.774 --> 23:17.630
Whatever you had gathered, knowledge,
whatever you think was right,

23:17.831 --> 23:23.280
whatever was your dream and your aims
of life, all these aspirations,

23:23.481 --> 23:26.010
they melt away.

23:26.211 --> 23:33.142
And then you take to reality and you start
seeing the reality of everything.

23:33.343 --> 23:41.740
Unless and until you see that reality, you
will be going with [the] other crowd:

23:41.941 --> 23:44.270
“These people are saying so, so let’s
do that.”

23:44.471 --> 23:49.765
“They are saying so, so let’s do that”.
But you cannot see whether it is correct

23:49.966 --> 23:56.072
or not, it’s good for you or not, or
whether it is going to help you.

23:56.273 --> 24:02.266
This kind of thing is so common
in the whole world

24:02.467 --> 24:09.163
and that’s why there is so much problem.
Because they don’t know the reality.

24:09.364 --> 24:13.968
Once you know the reality, most of
the problems can be finished,

24:14.169 --> 24:17.967
because this brain itself is creating
problems.

24:18.168 --> 24:24.161
First of all, it commits all kinds
of atrocities, violence, everything;

24:24.362 --> 24:30.297
then it also justifies itself, and then
it does even worse things.

24:30.498 --> 24:37.786
All this, they used to call it as ‘sin’, but
now in Sahaja Yoga, that’s finished now.

24:38.008 --> 24:42.809
Whatever your brain was contaminated with
is now cleansed.

24:43.010 --> 24:47.603
It has got the knowledge and through
the knowledge you can make out

24:47.804 --> 24:52.871
what is right and what is wrong.
Up to this point is all right.

24:53.072 --> 25:01.802
But then you must have full understanding
that, whatever [is] right, is right,

25:02.003 --> 25:08.063
and whatever [is] wrong is wrong, and we
should not do anything that is wrong,

25:08.264 --> 25:14.064
always do the right. You have to decide
on that point.

25:14.265 --> 25:19.390
”Now we have to do the right only,
never the wrong”.

25:19.591 --> 25:24.781
This, when it comes to your mind, then
what starts is your determination:

25:24.982 --> 25:30.561
what we call as devotion, dedication,
surrendering.

25:32.804 --> 25:40.879
With that, you give up all your false ideas
and all your false pride,

25:41.080 --> 25:43.962
all other things that you have been doing
so far,

25:44.163 --> 25:50.351
and immediately you become a different
person, a beautiful person.

25:53.575 --> 25:59.014
Now the third thing that happens to you,
which never happened to you before,

25:59.215 --> 26:06.436
[is] that you feel that: “Unless and until
I give the same state to other people

26:06.637 --> 26:12.925
it won’t be all right, it won’t be -
all right for me to talk to them”.

26:13.126 --> 26:16.463
So you start talking to your brothers,
sisters.

26:16.664 --> 26:21.333
Then you start talking to other people,
then you start talking to...

26:21.534 --> 26:25.127
[the] whole nation you can talk about
Sahaja Yoga,

26:25.328 --> 26:32.652
that, “I have gained so much, I have got
these things; so now, why not you take it?”

26:32.853 --> 26:36.372
But to expect that by talking,
by discussion,

26:36.573 --> 26:41.086
by arguments, by sermoning…
they will never take.

26:41.287 --> 26:48.994
Because their brain, as I told you, is just
the same - still full of ignorance.

26:49.195 --> 26:52.846
So what you have to do is to raise
their Kundalini.

26:53.047 --> 26:57.951
Once you raise their Kundalini and their
brain opens,

26:58.152 --> 27:04.145
then they are on the same line as yourself.
They don’t have to worry

27:04.346 --> 27:12.536
about what is good and what is bad,
they know [it] themselves.

27:15.355 --> 27:22.131
Now that is what is very important.
To correct this world is very important:

27:22.332 --> 27:26.663
that you all should know what is right
and what is wrong.

27:26.864 --> 27:34.203
And you have a vehicle of Paramachaitanya
to know what is wrong and what is right.

27:34.404 --> 27:39.227
Now this strength starts moving and,
as you see, there are

27:39.428 --> 27:44.002
so many people, today, with their open
Sahastrara.

27:44.203 --> 27:50.670
So opening Sahastrara was the most
important part of the evolutionary process.

27:50.871 --> 27:56.143
All the evolution process brought human
beings to what level?

27:56.344 --> 28:04.310
We had wars, we had all kinds of silly
programmes

28:04.511 --> 28:11.041
by which we really ruined so many
countries, so many people.

28:11.784 --> 28:19.764
Now when you are one with that
All-pervading Power: It’s a pure power.

28:19.965 --> 28:25.810
It’s a nirmal power. Absolutely pure
power.

28:26.011 --> 28:31.797
That gives you complete sense and complete
understanding

28:31.998 --> 28:39.977
as to how you should move, how you should
live, and what you should have.

28:40.314 --> 28:44.894
This is what is Self-realisation, they say.

28:45.095 --> 28:51.075
But I would say that Self-realisation is
much further than that.

28:51.276 --> 28:58.404
Even if your brain is enriched by
the Knowledge, the Real Knowledge,

28:58.605 --> 29:02.813
still there are other things which you
should have.

29:03.014 --> 29:08.989
And the most important thing is that
you have to be

29:09.190 --> 29:14.671
completely aware – again I say word
‘aware’ –

29:14.872 --> 29:24.341
of where you stand in this big plan
of world global transformation.

29:24.542 --> 29:29.062
What is your position? What are you
supposed to do

29:29.263 --> 29:35.885
for this global transformation? What is
your position?

29:36.099 --> 29:42.779
Where do you stand? What is the work
for you to be done?

29:42.980 --> 29:50.860
Now you’ve got this compulsion on you,
that, “I have to do something.”

29:51.061 --> 29:57.053
When this compulsion starts working
on you, which is not dreadful,

29:57.254 --> 30:04.744
which is not annoying, but very peaceful
and joyful,

30:04.945 --> 30:10.882
which says that, “I have to see that others
also know themselves!”

30:11.083 --> 30:17.154
So to know themselves is, first of all
you must know your own chakras.

30:17.829 --> 30:23.182
Yes, many people get their Realisation,
I know, very quickly.

30:23.383 --> 30:27.543
But they do not settle down with
their chakras.

30:27.744 --> 30:32.223
They have to see to their chakras: why you
have problems on your chakras.

30:32.424 --> 30:36.096
They will know they have problems,
but they still go on

30:36.297 --> 30:40.969
without paying attention or without looking
at it.

30:41.170 --> 30:45.504
To them it is a kind of a

30:48.271 --> 30:54.135
by the way [style], you can say: that,
“These problems are with me doesn’t matter.

30:54.336 --> 31:01.414
But what does it matter as long as I am
working out Sahaja Yoga?”

31:01.600 --> 31:06.053
It is not only for others, but for yourself
also!

31:06.254 --> 31:11.287
Is important that you should get your
chakras corrected.

31:11.488 --> 31:16.651
That’s the most important thing for you,
and then you will have Self-knowledge,

31:16.852 --> 31:20.778
in the sense [that] you will know what is
the defect, where is the defect,

31:20.979 --> 31:27.175
”What am I doing wrong? What should I do?”
And then when you correct it,

31:27.376 --> 31:31.569
when you correct those centres, then
your awareness,

31:31.770 --> 31:36.494
I would say, will be really, fully
enlightened about all the world.

31:36.695 --> 31:40.052
Now, it’s a tremendous thing – it’s very
tremendous.

31:40.253 --> 31:45.725
Because if you have to transform this mad
world into something very sane,

31:45.926 --> 31:50.256
and if we have to give them all
Self-realisation,

31:50.457 --> 31:56.362
imagine the task, how great it is, how many
people we need to do it.

31:56.539 --> 32:04.147
But if your willpower is strong about it
and you see – you feel compelled to do it.

32:04.348 --> 32:09.279
But normally, you see, we are compelled
because we have to run our houses,

32:09.480 --> 32:13.932
we have to earn money, we have to do this,
we have to do that.

32:14.133 --> 32:21.376
That you can do. But main object of your
life is to transform people

32:21.585 --> 32:29.401
and to work it out, this transformation –
for the global peace.

32:29.602 --> 32:33.538
I don’t know [if] it has been predicted
or not,

32:33.739 --> 32:36.838
that a complete transformation will take
place,

32:37.039 --> 32:41.638
but they have talked about transformation.
I don’t know that part,

32:41.839 --> 32:48.160
and I just don’t bother my head as to how
many people are getting transformed.

32:48.361 --> 32:53.555
But after transformation you must settle
down.

32:53.756 --> 32:58.707
First of all you should see if you are
a peaceful person,

32:58.867 --> 33:03.528
if there’s peace in your heart.
If you have no peace in your heart

33:03.729 --> 33:08.542
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.
If you get excited

33:08.743 --> 33:15.250
and if you start shouting at people and all
that, it means you are not Sahaja Yogis.

33:15.451 --> 33:22.004
You have to have a very, very peaceful
temperament, that is very important.

33:22.205 --> 33:28.016
Now with that peace what should be there,
[is] pure compassion.

33:29.944 --> 33:35.716
What you are doing is not for your benefit
or as such,

33:35.917 --> 33:45.292
but because you are compelled by this Force
to do good for others, to transform them.

33:45.493 --> 33:50.923
This is the greatest good you can do
to others, that their brains are put right,

33:51.124 --> 33:55.802
they get rid of their diseases, they get
rid of their problems. It’s all there.

33:56.003 --> 34:00.805
But, the first thing and the most important
thing that happens

34:01.006 --> 34:04.462
[is] that they get the power to transform
others.

34:04.663 --> 34:10.838
When you have that power to transform
others you should not waste it,

34:11.039 --> 34:15.736
you should not use it for yourself. That
means the growth is not complete.

34:15.937 --> 34:22.555
You must talk about it, you must tell
about it, and you must work it out.

34:22.756 --> 34:26.329
Wherever it is possible you have to work
it out.

34:26.530 --> 34:31.980
This is the way we can spread people
on a global level,

34:32.181 --> 34:35.504
who can get complete transformation.

34:35.705 --> 34:41.212
All our problems, whether in India
or anywhere,

34:41.413 --> 34:50.319
is because of human beings, because they
have been not enlightened.

34:50.520 --> 34:56.116
See, if you are enlightened you’ll have
no problem of any quarrelling

34:56.317 --> 34:59.764
or any fighting and all that.

34:59.965 --> 35:06.690
If you are enlightened, then you will think
about others,

35:06.891 --> 35:12.103
others as if they are your own, bother
your heads about them.

35:12.304 --> 35:16.840
You will not think about yourself anymore.

35:17.041 --> 35:23.164
If you are enlightened then [there's]
no question of any violence in your head.

35:23.365 --> 35:27.055
Nowadays in the name of religion,
in the name of everything,

35:27.256 --> 35:29.604
there is so much of violence.

35:29.827 --> 35:34.994
This violence can be easily corrected
if they all become Sahaja Yogis.

35:35.195 --> 35:40.454
Think, if all people become Sahaja Yogis,
how will they quarrel, for what?

35:40.655 --> 35:44.517
So this religion is there, but above
all these religions

35:44.718 --> 35:49.423
is the religion of Sahaja Yoga, where
you become one.

35:49.624 --> 35:54.319
And there all these quarrels of religions
will disappear.

35:54.908 --> 35:57.905
This is not the only problem we have
as human beings,

35:58.106 --> 36:01.512
we have some other problems also,
very serious.

36:01.713 --> 36:09.437
That is, we have a hankering.

36:10.168 --> 36:15.924
We are very greedy. We cannot adjust
yourself to any other circumstances.

36:16.125 --> 36:20.093
We want to live in complete comfort and
this and that.

36:20.286 --> 36:25.774
But after this you can sleep anywhere, you
can eat anywhere, you need not eat.

36:25.953 --> 36:35.973
You become a person who is above all these
needs, all these demands, absolutely.

36:50.029 --> 36:55.605
Then you don’t worry, you don’t worry.
There’s worry for what?

36:55.806 --> 37:00.098
Supposing I get lost somewhere and the car
is going in a wrong way:

37:00.299 --> 37:04.662
all right, I have to go that way,
that’s why I’m going like that.

37:04.863 --> 37:07.614
What is there to feel upset about it?

37:07.815 --> 37:14.799
So many things, small, big, happen in your
life for which you get upset.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.459
But now, with this blessing of Sahastrara,

37:19.660 --> 37:25.693
you’ll be amazed, there is help
from Paramchaitanya.

37:25.915 --> 37:34.797
And that means a tremendous help, because
it acts globally, it acts individually,

37:34.998 --> 37:41.905
it acts on communities, it acts on nations,

37:42.106 --> 37:51.154
because there is a Divine – what we call
‘Divine’ – where is a Divine play going on.

37:51.355 --> 37:56.736
And this Divine play plays tremendous
beautiful things,

37:56.937 --> 38:01.220
by which people start correcting
themselves.

38:01.421 --> 38:04.769
So, you should never be nervous, you should
never be upset,

38:04.970 --> 38:10.064
because you have the Divine Power
within you, and it will correct.

38:10.265 --> 38:16.093
It can correct anyone. I mean, recently
we had a case of one boy

38:16.294 --> 38:21.866
who was hit by a truck and they said
his lungs were smashed.

38:22.067 --> 38:26.644
Now, with the lungs smashed, nobody has
heard that they become normal.

38:26.850 --> 38:30.427
Not only they became normal, but he started
breathing normally.

38:30.628 --> 38:36.699
And now he is all right. Is only this work
is done by Paramchaitanya.

38:36.900 --> 38:41.189
You don’t have to do anything. Any problem
comes before you,

38:41.390 --> 38:47.975
before it really touches you, is solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

38:48.737 --> 38:55.756
But you must have full faith in yourself
and in Paramachaitanya

38:55.957 --> 39:01.358
and believe that you are a realised-soul.
Nobody can harm you.

39:01.559 --> 39:05.993
If they try to harm you, for the time
being, all right, you may suffer,

39:06.194 --> 39:11.188
but you don’t also feel the sufferings
and you get out of it.

39:11.389 --> 39:17.790
Such a security, such a proper guidance
is there.

39:17.991 --> 39:22.019
Also you are saved from all kinds
of attacks

39:22.220 --> 39:26.665
and all kinds of mistakes that you commit.

39:26.866 --> 39:34.156
It’s all such a big – I would say,
a Computer of Knowledge.

39:34.357 --> 39:41.212
He knows, It knows what you are doing
and what you should not do,

39:41.413 --> 39:47.147
where you are going and what should
not be your way.

39:47.348 --> 39:53.638
He knows, It knows everything, knows
everything about you.

39:53.839 --> 39:59.183
So then you have to become aware of It.

39:59.384 --> 40:03.828
Now this is the stage where I would say
that you have to be aware

40:04.029 --> 40:11.618
that you are realised-souls, you are
different,

40:11.819 --> 40:17.297
very unique. You are realised-souls,
you are not ordinary people.

40:17.498 --> 40:27.275
And that you are protected by this
Paramchaitanya. Nothing can change you,

40:27.476 --> 40:34.825
nothing can trouble you, nothing can
overpower you.

40:35.026 --> 40:40.088
Because you are not aware, also, of this
Paramachaitanya,

40:40.289 --> 40:44.073
that’s why you, a little bit, get worried.
And people write to me,

40:44.274 --> 40:48.317
“Mother, my - something wrong with
my daughter, something this thing."

40:48.518 --> 40:54.197
Everything can be corrected
by Paramchaitanya,

40:54.398 --> 40:58.447
if you know how to leave it to That,

40:59.264 --> 41:04.400
if you understand how you are one
with that Paramchaitanya,

41:04.601 --> 41:12.857
you are a part and parcel of that. And that
Paramchaitanya is looking after you.

41:13.058 --> 41:17.775
You don’t have [a] very conscious effort,

41:17.976 --> 41:23.794
there’s no need to have very conscious
effort. Accept life as it is.

41:23.995 --> 41:28.199
As it is, whatever life is there, accept.
Don’t retaliate,

41:28.400 --> 41:31.983
don’t get angry, don’t get upset.
Just accept.

41:32.184 --> 41:37.040
And you’ll enjoy the same life which
was irritating you!

41:37.241 --> 41:43.253
You will see the enjoying part of that,
and it will be so beautiful

41:43.454 --> 41:47.810
the way you will see that you’ll get over
all your problems,

41:48.011 --> 41:50.543
you’ll get over all your enemies.

41:50.744 --> 41:58.123
And a kind of a very fresh, beautiful
existence you’ll have.

41:58.324 --> 42:05.445
So now, as you are all Sahaja Yogis,
is a very great position.

42:05.646 --> 42:13.085
With that, if you humble down, humble down,
then you’ll be amazed to see

42:13.286 --> 42:20.394
that, you are absolutely in contact with
this Paramchaitanya;

42:20.595 --> 42:25.221
not only that, but you have become
Paramchaitanya.

42:28.186 --> 42:32.719
With this Paramchaitanya you can do
anything.

42:32.920 --> 42:39.235
I need not tell you what you can do,
because some of you may not believe.

42:39.436 --> 42:45.318
But that’s [what] my own experience is,
that, if you are the Paramchaitanya,

42:45.519 --> 42:50.803
if you know you are the Paramchaitanya,
then it keeps your dignity,

42:51.004 --> 42:57.214
it keeps your position, it keeps your world
and looks after you.

42:57.415 --> 43:02.556
And whatever is just said or desired,
you just get it.

43:02.757 --> 43:08.669
Your desires also change. Your desires
are not for stupid things,

43:08.870 --> 43:13.479
but for something that is very noble.

43:14.535 --> 43:20.488
Like, you want to transform people, you
want to do Sahaja Yoga work.

43:20.695 --> 43:24.733
All these desires are fulfilled fully,

43:24.934 --> 43:31.027
when you want to do it, you like it and
you think of it.

43:31.228 --> 43:35.163
It is something, even seeing something:

43:35.364 --> 43:39.831
if you see something and you are stunned
by that!

43:40.032 --> 43:48.867
Immediately Paramchaitanya will take over
and you will have no problems, no problems.

43:49.068 --> 43:57.313
Because the way we react to all these
difficulties and to so-called odds in life

43:57.514 --> 44:00.737
becomes a play, just a play.
You are amazed!

44:00.938 --> 44:05.114
You looked at it and finished!
Look at that, and finished!

44:05.315 --> 44:13.063
That is how it is the light, which goes into
the darkness and finishes the darkness.

44:13.264 --> 44:17.934
The darkness is finished, and our problems
are finished also.

44:18.135 --> 44:21.687
So this is what is our awareness has
to become.

44:21.888 --> 44:25.518
Awareness has to become Paramachaitanya.

44:25.719 --> 44:30.899
Then you get all the ideas, everything
that are Divine.

44:31.100 --> 44:38.592
But not only that, but also the help of
the Divine, all the solutions of the Divine.

44:38.793 --> 44:43.723
It’s something amazing! And everything
quietens down,

44:43.924 --> 44:50.232
everything settles down, and you are
amazed, watching all this,

44:50.433 --> 44:56.261
that you are the centre of doing
all these things.

44:56.462 --> 45:00.114
You are not aware that you are doing,
and you are this.

45:00.315 --> 45:04.786
That ego part is missing. But you
see it’s all happening around you,

45:04.987 --> 45:09.639
and then you are amazed how it is
happening.

45:09.840 --> 45:15.459
The whole lifestyle changes, the whole
understanding changes,

45:15.660 --> 45:22.143
and you become a great source of happiness,
joy and knowledge to others.

45:22.344 --> 45:28.609
You don’t have to study anything, you don’t
have to know much,

45:28.777 --> 45:34.938
but you will know about everything,
what is right and what is wrong.

45:36.089 --> 45:41.836
And then only you can tell the things
with complete authority

45:42.037 --> 45:47.370
that, “This is not right!” Like today,
we had a discussion on this point

45:47.571 --> 45:52.365
about the economic position and
the economics of modern times.

45:52.566 --> 46:00.192
I said, “Is all wrong, because it is
self-destructive.”

46:00.393 --> 46:06.867
It destroys the nations, if not your
nation, other nations.

46:07.068 --> 46:16.172
Then it also destroys your family life.
It destroys your value system.

46:16.373 --> 46:23.619
It completely destroys you. So what sort
of an economics is this?

46:23.820 --> 46:34.753
It’s just a show, just a, like a, you can
say, a balloon: it can burst any moment.

46:34.954 --> 46:38.294
I have seen people who are very rich,
very this thing,

46:38.495 --> 46:43.898
think no end of themselves [then] become
bankrupt. And very bankrupt become rich.

46:44.099 --> 46:50.838
So it’s [a] kind of a turmoil in which
they are jumping,

46:51.039 --> 46:57.122
from one shore to another shore. But
you are not. You watch that drama.

46:57.323 --> 47:03.754
You see all that drama, and with your peace
you can see everything, very calmly.

47:03.955 --> 47:08.155
Not, it’s not difficult for you to create
more people like this.

47:08.356 --> 47:14.895
It’s not difficult to transform this world.
The time has come, just ripe time.

47:15.096 --> 47:19.345
Like when the proper time comes,
the blossom time comes,

47:19.546 --> 47:24.958
so many flowers become fruits. So,
like that, you all have become.

47:25.159 --> 47:30.394
Now it is for you to create seeds to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

47:30.595 --> 47:35.735
You are at that level of awareness now
where Paramchaitanya is with you,

47:35.936 --> 47:41.898
absolutely part and parcel of you,
absolutely with you to give you

47:42.099 --> 47:51.059
all necessary help, all necessary prestige,
and also the personality.

47:52.772 --> 47:55.578
May God bless you all.
