00:08:20.012 --> 00:08:28.751
Today we have gathered here to do
the Sahastrara puja.

00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:36.923
Sahastrar, the word ‘sahastr’, in Sanskrit
language, means ‘one thousand’.

00:08:37.124 --> 00:08:47.585
And there are one thousand petals
in our brain, which get enlightened.

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:54.230
Of course, the doctors are quarrelling
on that point, but forget about them.

00:08:54.524 --> 00:09:02.403
Now these petals are kept ready
for our enlightenment,

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:11.364
and these are really the nerves,
one thousand nerves,

00:09:11.565 --> 00:09:16.975
which are there for the enlightenment
of the brain.

00:09:17.483 --> 00:09:28.692
So when the Kundalini rises, she enlightens
those one thousand nerves

00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:37.985
which become like a –

00:09:38.186 --> 00:09:50.486
as you see here, the shape of these
flames – like a petal.

00:09:51.311 --> 00:10:00.981
And that’s why it is called as ‘Sahastrara’
- is the centre of Sahastrara.

00:10:01.182 --> 00:10:08.970
In the human beings it is a very important
centre,

00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:16.465
because this is the only centre by which
we think

00:10:16.666 --> 00:10:24.564
and we try to stop whatever we don’t like.

00:10:25.358 --> 00:10:33.028
This is the centre which reacts, reacts
in such a manner

00:10:33.229 --> 00:10:41.067
that, without any discretion we start
saying, ‘no’ to this, and, ‘no’ to that,

00:10:41.268 --> 00:10:46.549
on small things also. Like somebody might
say, “I don’t like this carpet,”

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:51.546
“I don’t like this house,” “I don’t
like that.”

00:10:54.824 --> 00:11:00.838
This language itself shows that – who
are you? First find out!

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:05.753
But you cannot become yourself unless
and until this Sahastrara,

00:11:05.954 --> 00:11:14.832
this brain is opened out and the Kundalini
becomes one with the Paramchaitanya.

00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:26.001
Before that, you are in complete ignorance
about what is good and what is bad.

00:11:26.202 --> 00:11:32.269
Whatever you think [that], for this brain,
is good, you do it.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:37.127
But whatever is really good, you do
not know,

00:11:37.328 --> 00:11:41.510
because you do not know the Reality.

00:11:42.542 --> 00:11:47.225
Now we have to understand the consciousness
that we have:

00:11:47.426 --> 00:11:54.019
consciousness of being alive, consciousness
of so many things we have,

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:59.673
and the so-called knowledge we have
about everything.

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:07.094
All that consciousness is stored near
the liver – for your information –

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.271
by this diaphragm.

00:12:10.472 --> 00:12:15.998
But then, this consciousness starts rising,
higher and higher.

00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:20.731
Then you become aware. In the evolutionary
process,

00:12:20.932 --> 00:12:25.985
you become aware, aware of things.

00:12:26.186 --> 00:12:33.524
Without going through your brain, you just
become aware. And how?

00:12:33.725 --> 00:12:39.519
Not by thinking, not by understanding
or seeing,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.817
but you become aware because
your brain has now

00:12:46.018 --> 00:12:53.251
started working in a manner that’s very,
very sensitive.

00:12:53.452 --> 00:12:59.262
So you just become aware of some sort
of a fear,

00:12:59.463 --> 00:13:06.107
or maybe some sort of a goodness
or anything. But it goes even further.

00:13:06.308 --> 00:13:11.489
The growth of consciousness, which becomes
aware, goes further:

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:21.702
where you start liking a person,
or disliking a person.

00:13:23.473 --> 00:13:28.741
But, still it’s nothing definite and sure.

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:33.377
You dislike a person because he has
a particular type of a face,

00:13:33.578 --> 00:13:37.336
maybe eyes or maybe anything.

00:13:38.309 --> 00:13:45.365
Or maybe because you have known
somebody who has been very nice,

00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:51.693
so you start transferring that image
onto others.

00:13:51.894 --> 00:13:59.940
With these transferred images, you can
hate or love someone.

00:14:00.141 --> 00:14:05.843
Then you start saying, “I hate this,
I hate that,”

00:14:06.395 --> 00:14:11.093
which has no, actually, substantial
meaning.

00:14:11.294 --> 00:14:19.821
You hate it because, perhaps, maybe such
and such person looks like somebody.

00:14:20.178 --> 00:14:24.240
Now you go further with it, then you see
that, such and such person –

00:14:24.441 --> 00:14:28.088
now I’m not talking about things, but
about persons -

00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:35.901
such and such person has done this harm to me
- something positive (may mean "negative").

00:14:36.102 --> 00:14:42.250
So you start feeling that you should hate
that person.

00:14:42.955 --> 00:14:46.601
Now you start hating that person.
With that hatred

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:51.216
you develop new faculties [of] how to harm
that person.

00:14:51.417 --> 00:14:55.663
Then you start thinking how to destroy
that person,

00:14:55.864 --> 00:15:01.243
how to make his life miserable.

00:15:01.444 --> 00:15:07.174
Then you may beat that person, you may
shout at that person,

00:15:07.375 --> 00:15:11.452
you may try to kill that person. You can
do anything.

00:15:11.653 --> 00:15:17.026
So now the awareness is going towards
another direction, which is darkness,

00:15:17.227 --> 00:15:22.862
which is not light, because in the light
you won’t do such a thing.

00:15:23.063 --> 00:15:28.940
In the light you see everybody, everybody
is sitting, you know how far you are,

00:15:29.141 --> 00:15:34.182
where you are sitting. If you want to go
out, you know how to walk out.

00:15:34.383 --> 00:15:39.193
But when, in the darkness you are there,
you just don’t understand

00:15:39.394 --> 00:15:47.133
and you go on behaving in a manner
which is, which cannot be explained

00:15:47.334 --> 00:15:51.536
otherwise, except that, because you are
a human being.

00:15:51.737 --> 00:15:56.784
Animals don’t do like that. Animals have
limitation [on them].

00:15:56.985 --> 00:16:03.775
The animals, if they find something wrong,
something absolutely

00:16:03.982 --> 00:16:08.917
harmful done to them, then they will attack
or run away,

00:16:09.118 --> 00:16:14.139
but they do not carry a kind of a hatred
or anything.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.862
But they can carry the impression of fear,
could be,

00:16:19.063 --> 00:16:25.134
of some sort of a harm done to them.
But human beings are not like that.

00:16:25.335 --> 00:16:34.683
Human beings don’t have any particular
reason, as such, to hate someone.

00:16:34.884 --> 00:16:41.619
But why it works out? Because they are
involved in their ego.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:51.163
Egoistical person feels that he has a right
to do what he wants to do:

00:16:51.396 --> 00:16:58.201
he can kill anybody, he can bomb anyone,
he can do whatever he likes.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:04.602
But a person who is not doing that,
is the other way round:

00:17:04.803 --> 00:17:09.644
he is frightened, he is afraid of someone.

00:17:09.845 --> 00:17:14.639
Now the awareness moves on. This is
a subtler awareness,

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:21.685
because, if you are afraid of somebody,
you would not like to go to his house,

00:17:21.886 --> 00:17:27.364
you will avoid him in the street,
all things you can do.

00:17:27.565 --> 00:17:32.066
So all this kind of knowledge about other
human beings also

00:17:32.267 --> 00:17:35.743
accumulates in your mind.

00:17:35.944 --> 00:17:45.094
Then this thing starts working on
a collective level,

00:17:45.295 --> 00:17:49.756
because you think, “This group is very bad.
They are good.

00:17:49.957 --> 00:17:54.780
These are bad. They are excellent!”
like that, it works out.

00:17:54.981 --> 00:18:01.716
In your own mind you think that somebody
has a group,

00:18:01.917 --> 00:18:06.273
and the other group is better or that group
is better.

00:18:06.474 --> 00:18:16.334
And collectively, then, you start working
out your whole temperament, your awareness.

00:18:16.535 --> 00:18:20.578
Like once people decide that say,
for example,

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:28.597
that black people are to be finished,
so all the white people can join together.

00:18:28.798 --> 00:18:36.782
Or like at the time of Hitler, he decided
that all other human beings but Germans

00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:42.184
were useless. So he gathered people around
his thought and ideas.

00:18:42.385 --> 00:18:47.305
And this collective awareness just
comes to,

00:18:47.506 --> 00:18:51.524
I don’t know how, but it enters into
the minds of many.

00:18:51.725 --> 00:18:57.174
They never challenge it, they never ask
[about] it, whether it is correct or not.

00:18:57.375 --> 00:19:04.000
So this grows more and more and more,
and then it becomes like a –

00:19:04.597 --> 00:19:10.673
country-wise, you can say – an awareness
of this kind of a feeling.

00:19:10.874 --> 00:19:20.416
But whether it is correct or not is not
understood, is not known.

00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:26.060
So, what is important [is] that you should
know Reality,

00:19:26.261 --> 00:19:30.881
you should know exactly what is right
and what is wrong.

00:19:31.082 --> 00:19:41.018
For that, as I told you, there is this
great power of Kundalini within you.

00:19:41.573 --> 00:19:44.707
She is the one, She passes through
all these centres,

00:19:44.908 --> 00:19:51.153
enlightens them first of all, so your
awareness gets enlightened.

00:19:51.354 --> 00:19:56.798
And when She pierces through Sahastrara,
She joins you

00:19:56.999 --> 00:20:05.274
to this All-pervading Power which is
Knowledge,

00:20:06.567 --> 00:20:13.399
which is love, which is Truth.

00:20:14.845 --> 00:20:19.207
So, after that, you immediately know –

00:20:19.864 --> 00:20:24.029
some people don’t know immediately,
but some people do –

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:33.029
that what we have been thinking so far,
of separating ourselves from others

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.182
by thinking they are not all right, they are
wrong, they are whatever it is –

00:20:37.383 --> 00:20:41.460
this disappears. This disappears
completely,

00:20:41.661 --> 00:20:45.413
and then you realise that your awareness
itself,

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:51.050
awareness itself is dominated by so many
other circumstances.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:55.257
For example, where you were born, what
your parents taught you,

00:20:55.458 --> 00:20:58.354
what experiences you have had.

00:20:58.555 --> 00:21:03.583
And then you realise that it was all wrong,
because it’s not Reality.

00:21:03.784 --> 00:21:09.079
Whatever feelings you have, whatever
ideas you have

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:16.539
about another person or about other nation,
all of them are not correct.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:24.597
Because now your Sahastrara is awakened,
that it is connected now

00:21:24.798 --> 00:21:31.283
to the All-pervading Power. So this
starts flowing into you.

00:21:31.484 --> 00:21:40.534
This - I should say - enlightened awareness,
it starts flowing down into your being,

00:21:40.735 --> 00:21:48.774
in your brain, and then on your nerves
you can feel that awareness.

00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:55.152
Now once you want to know about something,
whether it is right or wrong –

00:21:55.353 --> 00:21:58.970
absolute right and wrong, it’s not [a]
question of relative –

00:21:59.171 --> 00:22:04.024
you just have to put your hands towards
that person,

00:22:04.225 --> 00:22:07.214
or towards that thing or whatever it is:

00:22:07.415 --> 00:22:11.994
immediately on these vibrations you
will know.

00:22:12.195 --> 00:22:16.922
So what are these vibrations, is this
Paramachaitanya,

00:22:17.123 --> 00:22:24.009
we call it ‘Brahmachaitanya’, which starts
flowing through your finger tips.

00:22:24.215 --> 00:22:29.149
Now you start feeling what chakras
they are catching,

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:36.613
whether they are right or wrong, and your
discretion improves immensely.

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:40.536
The brain, which was putting you
in delusions

00:22:40.737 --> 00:22:45.399
and wrong type of life, immediately
corrects itself.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.087
For example, I’m walking in a place
with my eyes closed,

00:22:51.288 --> 00:22:57.972
and there is a big ditch. I can’t see it,
I’m just walking.

00:22:58.173 --> 00:23:01.416
And suddenly I open my eyes and see
the ditch:

00:23:01.617 --> 00:23:05.542
immediately I know it’s wrong and I give up
and come away.

00:23:05.743 --> 00:23:11.573
In the same way it happens to you when
your Sahastrara is enlightened.

00:23:11.774 --> 00:23:17.630
Whatever you had gathered, knowledge,
whatever you think was right,

00:23:17.831 --> 00:23:23.280
whatever was your dream and your aims
of life, all these aspirations,

00:23:23.481 --> 00:23:26.010
they melt away.

00:23:26.211 --> 00:23:33.142
And then you take to reality and you start
seeing the reality of everything.

00:23:33.343 --> 00:23:41.740
Unless and until you see that reality, you
will be going with [the] other crowd:

00:23:41.941 --> 00:23:44.270
“These people are saying so, so let’s
do that.”

00:23:44.471 --> 00:23:49.765
“They are saying so, so let’s do that”.
But you cannot see whether it is correct

00:23:49.966 --> 00:23:56.072
or not, it’s good for you or not, or
whether it is going to help you.

00:23:56.273 --> 00:24:02.266
This kind of thing is so common
in the whole world

00:24:02.467 --> 00:24:09.163
and that’s why there is so much problem.
Because they don’t know the reality.

00:24:09.364 --> 00:24:13.968
Once you know the reality, most of
the problems can be finished,

00:24:14.169 --> 00:24:17.967
because this brain itself is creating
problems.

00:24:18.168 --> 00:24:24.161
First of all, it commits all kinds
of atrocities, violence, everything;

00:24:24.362 --> 00:24:30.297
then it also justifies itself, and then
it does even worse things.

00:24:30.498 --> 00:24:37.786
All this, they used to call it as ‘sin’, but
now in Sahaja Yoga, that’s finished now.

00:24:38.008 --> 00:24:42.809
Whatever your brain was contaminated with
is now cleansed.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:47.603
It has got the knowledge and through
the knowledge you can make out

00:24:47.804 --> 00:24:52.871
what is right and what is wrong.
Up to this point is all right.

00:24:53.072 --> 00:25:01.802
But then you must have full understanding
that, whatever [is] right, is right,

00:25:02.003 --> 00:25:08.063
and whatever [is] wrong is wrong, and we
should not do anything that is wrong,

00:25:08.264 --> 00:25:14.064
always do the right. You have to decide
on that point.

00:25:14.265 --> 00:25:19.390
”Now we have to do the right only,
never the wrong”.

00:25:19.591 --> 00:25:24.781
This, when it comes to your mind, then
what starts is your determination:

00:25:24.982 --> 00:25:30.561
what we call as devotion, dedication,
surrendering.

00:25:32.804 --> 00:25:40.879
With that, you give up all your false ideas
and all your false pride,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.962
all other things that you have been doing
so far,

00:25:44.163 --> 00:25:50.351
and immediately you become a different
person, a beautiful person.

00:25:53.575 --> 00:25:59.014
Now the third thing that happens to you,
which never happened to you before,

00:25:59.215 --> 00:26:06.436
[is] that you feel that: “Unless and until
I give the same state to other people

00:26:06.637 --> 00:26:12.925
it won’t be all right, it won’t be -
all right for me to talk to them”.

00:26:13.126 --> 00:26:16.463
So you start talking to your brothers,
sisters.

00:26:16.664 --> 00:26:21.333
Then you start talking to other people,
then you start talking to...

00:26:21.534 --> 00:26:25.127
[the] whole nation you can talk about
Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:25.328 --> 00:26:32.652
that, “I have gained so much, I have got
these things; so now, why not you take it?”

00:26:32.853 --> 00:26:36.372
But to expect that by talking,
by discussion,

00:26:36.573 --> 00:26:41.086
by arguments, by sermoning…
they will never take.

00:26:41.287 --> 00:26:48.994
Because their brain, as I told you, is just
the same - still full of ignorance.

00:26:49.195 --> 00:26:52.846
So what you have to do is to raise
their Kundalini.

00:26:53.047 --> 00:26:57.951
Once you raise their Kundalini and their
brain opens,

00:26:58.152 --> 00:27:04.145
then they are on the same line as yourself.
They don’t have to worry

00:27:04.346 --> 00:27:12.536
about what is good and what is bad,
they know [it] themselves.

00:27:15.355 --> 00:27:22.131
Now that is what is very important.
To correct this world is very important:

00:27:22.332 --> 00:27:26.663
that you all should know what is right
and what is wrong.

00:27:26.864 --> 00:27:34.203
And you have a vehicle of Paramachaitanya
to know what is wrong and what is right.

00:27:34.404 --> 00:27:39.227
Now this strength starts moving and,
as you see, there are

00:27:39.428 --> 00:27:44.002
so many people, today, with their open
Sahastrara.

00:27:44.203 --> 00:27:50.670
So opening Sahastrara was the most
important part of the evolutionary process.

00:27:50.871 --> 00:27:56.143
All the evolution process brought human
beings to what level?

00:27:56.344 --> 00:28:04.310
We had wars, we had all kinds of silly
programmes

00:28:04.511 --> 00:28:11.041
by which we really ruined so many
countries, so many people.

00:28:11.784 --> 00:28:19.764
Now when you are one with that
All-pervading Power: It’s a pure power.

00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:25.810
It’s a nirmal power. Absolutely pure
power.

00:28:26.011 --> 00:28:31.797
That gives you complete sense and complete
understanding

00:28:31.998 --> 00:28:39.977
as to how you should move, how you should
live, and what you should have.

00:28:40.314 --> 00:28:44.894
This is what is Self-realisation, they say.

00:28:45.095 --> 00:28:51.075
But I would say that Self-realisation is
much further than that.

00:28:51.276 --> 00:28:58.404
Even if your brain is enriched by
the Knowledge, the Real Knowledge,

00:28:58.605 --> 00:29:02.813
still there are other things which you
should have.

00:29:03.014 --> 00:29:08.989
And the most important thing is that
you have to be

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:14.671
completely aware – again I say word
‘aware’ –

00:29:14.872 --> 00:29:24.341
of where you stand in this big plan
of world global transformation.

00:29:24.542 --> 00:29:29.062
What is your position? What are you
supposed to do

00:29:29.263 --> 00:29:35.885
for this global transformation? What is
your position?

00:29:36.099 --> 00:29:42.779
Where do you stand? What is the work
for you to be done?

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:50.860
Now you’ve got this compulsion on you,
that, “I have to do something.”

00:29:51.061 --> 00:29:57.053
When this compulsion starts working
on you, which is not dreadful,

00:29:57.254 --> 00:30:04.744
which is not annoying, but very peaceful
and joyful,

00:30:04.945 --> 00:30:10.882
which says that, “I have to see that others
also know themselves!”

00:30:11.083 --> 00:30:17.154
So to know themselves is, first of all
you must know your own chakras.

00:30:17.829 --> 00:30:23.182
Yes, many people get their Realisation,
I know, very quickly.

00:30:23.383 --> 00:30:27.543
But they do not settle down with
their chakras.

00:30:27.744 --> 00:30:32.223
They have to see to their chakras: why you
have problems on your chakras.

00:30:32.424 --> 00:30:36.096
They will know they have problems,
but they still go on

00:30:36.297 --> 00:30:40.969
without paying attention or without looking
at it.

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:45.504
To them it is a kind of a

00:30:48.271 --> 00:30:54.135
by the way [style], you can say: that,
“These problems are with me doesn’t matter.

00:30:54.336 --> 00:31:01.414
But what does it matter as long as I am
working out Sahaja Yoga?”

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.053
It is not only for others, but for yourself
also!

00:31:06.254 --> 00:31:11.287
Is important that you should get your
chakras corrected.

00:31:11.488 --> 00:31:16.651
That’s the most important thing for you,
and then you will have Self-knowledge,

00:31:16.852 --> 00:31:20.778
in the sense [that] you will know what is
the defect, where is the defect,

00:31:20.979 --> 00:31:27.175
”What am I doing wrong? What should I do?”
And then when you correct it,

00:31:27.376 --> 00:31:31.569
when you correct those centres, then
your awareness,

00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:36.494
I would say, will be really, fully
enlightened about all the world.

00:31:36.695 --> 00:31:40.052
Now, it’s a tremendous thing – it’s very
tremendous.

00:31:40.253 --> 00:31:45.725
Because if you have to transform this mad
world into something very sane,

00:31:45.926 --> 00:31:50.256
and if we have to give them all
Self-realisation,

00:31:50.457 --> 00:31:56.362
imagine the task, how great it is, how many
people we need to do it.

00:31:56.539 --> 00:32:04.147
But if your willpower is strong about it
and you see – you feel compelled to do it.

00:32:04.348 --> 00:32:09.279
But normally, you see, we are compelled
because we have to run our houses,

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.932
we have to earn money, we have to do this,
we have to do that.

00:32:14.133 --> 00:32:21.376
That you can do. But main object of your
life is to transform people

00:32:21.585 --> 00:32:29.401
and to work it out, this transformation –
for the global peace.

00:32:29.602 --> 00:32:33.538
I don’t know [if] it has been predicted
or not,

00:32:33.739 --> 00:32:36.838
that a complete transformation will take
place,

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:41.638
but they have talked about transformation.
I don’t know that part,

00:32:41.839 --> 00:32:48.160
and I just don’t bother my head as to how
many people are getting transformed.

00:32:48.361 --> 00:32:53.555
But after transformation you must settle
down.

00:32:53.756 --> 00:32:58.707
First of all you should see if you are
a peaceful person,

00:32:58.867 --> 00:33:03.528
if there’s peace in your heart.
If you have no peace in your heart

00:33:03.729 --> 00:33:08.542
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.
If you get excited

00:33:08.743 --> 00:33:15.250
and if you start shouting at people and all
that, it means you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:15.451 --> 00:33:22.004
You have to have a very, very peaceful
temperament, that is very important.

00:33:22.205 --> 00:33:28.016
Now with that peace what should be there,
[is] pure compassion.

00:33:29.944 --> 00:33:35.716
What you are doing is not for your benefit
or as such,

00:33:35.917 --> 00:33:45.292
but because you are compelled by this Force
to do good for others, to transform them.

00:33:45.493 --> 00:33:50.923
This is the greatest good you can do
to others, that their brains are put right,

00:33:51.124 --> 00:33:55.802
they get rid of their diseases, they get
rid of their problems. It’s all there.

00:33:56.003 --> 00:34:00.805
But, the first thing and the most important
thing that happens

00:34:01.006 --> 00:34:04.462
[is] that they get the power to transform
others.

00:34:04.663 --> 00:34:10.838
When you have that power to transform
others you should not waste it,

00:34:11.039 --> 00:34:15.736
you should not use it for yourself. That
means the growth is not complete.

00:34:15.937 --> 00:34:22.555
You must talk about it, you must tell
about it, and you must work it out.

00:34:22.756 --> 00:34:26.329
Wherever it is possible you have to work
it out.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:31.980
This is the way we can spread people
on a global level,

00:34:32.181 --> 00:34:35.504
who can get complete transformation.

00:34:35.705 --> 00:34:41.212
All our problems, whether in India
or anywhere,

00:34:41.413 --> 00:34:50.319
is because of human beings, because they
have been not enlightened.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:56.116
See, if you are enlightened you’ll have
no problem of any quarrelling

00:34:56.317 --> 00:34:59.764
or any fighting and all that.

00:34:59.965 --> 00:35:06.690
If you are enlightened, then you will think
about others,

00:35:06.891 --> 00:35:12.103
others as if they are your own, bother
your heads about them.

00:35:12.304 --> 00:35:16.840
You will not think about yourself anymore.

00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:23.164
If you are enlightened then [there's]
no question of any violence in your head.

00:35:23.365 --> 00:35:27.055
Nowadays in the name of religion,
in the name of everything,

00:35:27.256 --> 00:35:29.604
there is so much of violence.

00:35:29.827 --> 00:35:34.994
This violence can be easily corrected
if they all become Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:35.195 --> 00:35:40.454
Think, if all people become Sahaja Yogis,
how will they quarrel, for what?

00:35:40.655 --> 00:35:44.517
So this religion is there, but above
all these religions

00:35:44.718 --> 00:35:49.423
is the religion of Sahaja Yoga, where
you become one.

00:35:49.624 --> 00:35:54.319
And there all these quarrels of religions
will disappear.

00:35:54.908 --> 00:35:57.905
This is not the only problem we have
as human beings,

00:35:58.106 --> 00:36:01.512
we have some other problems also,
very serious.

00:36:01.713 --> 00:36:09.437
That is, we have a hankering.

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:15.924
We are very greedy. We cannot adjust
yourself to any other circumstances.

00:36:16.125 --> 00:36:20.093
We want to live in complete comfort and
this and that.

00:36:20.286 --> 00:36:25.774
But after this you can sleep anywhere, you
can eat anywhere, you need not eat.

00:36:25.953 --> 00:36:35.973
You become a person who is above all these
needs, all these demands, absolutely.

00:36:50.029 --> 00:36:55.605
Then you don’t worry, you don’t worry.
There’s worry for what?

00:36:55.806 --> 00:37:00.098
Supposing I get lost somewhere and the car
is going in a wrong way:

00:37:00.299 --> 00:37:04.662
all right, I have to go that way,
that’s why I’m going like that.

00:37:04.863 --> 00:37:07.614
What is there to feel upset about it?

00:37:07.815 --> 00:37:14.799
So many things, small, big, happen in your
life for which you get upset.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.459
But now, with this blessing of Sahastrara,

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:25.693
you’ll be amazed, there is help
from Paramchaitanya.

00:37:25.915 --> 00:37:34.797
And that means a tremendous help, because
it acts globally, it acts individually,

00:37:34.998 --> 00:37:41.905
it acts on communities, it acts on nations,

00:37:42.106 --> 00:37:51.154
because there is a Divine – what we call
‘Divine’ – where is a Divine play going on.

00:37:51.355 --> 00:37:56.736
And this Divine play plays tremendous
beautiful things,

00:37:56.937 --> 00:38:01.220
by which people start correcting
themselves.

00:38:01.421 --> 00:38:04.769
So, you should never be nervous, you should
never be upset,

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:10.064
because you have the Divine Power
within you, and it will correct.

00:38:10.265 --> 00:38:16.093
It can correct anyone. I mean, recently
we had a case of one boy

00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:21.866
who was hit by a truck and they said
his lungs were smashed.

00:38:22.067 --> 00:38:26.644
Now, with the lungs smashed, nobody has
heard that they become normal.

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:30.427
Not only they became normal, but he started
breathing normally.

00:38:30.628 --> 00:38:36.699
And now he is all right. Is only this work
is done by Paramchaitanya.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.189
You don’t have to do anything. Any problem
comes before you,

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:47.975
before it really touches you, is solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

00:38:48.737 --> 00:38:55.756
But you must have full faith in yourself
and in Paramachaitanya

00:38:55.957 --> 00:39:01.358
and believe that you are a realised-soul.
Nobody can harm you.

00:39:01.559 --> 00:39:05.993
If they try to harm you, for the time
being, all right, you may suffer,

00:39:06.194 --> 00:39:11.188
but you don’t also feel the sufferings
and you get out of it.

00:39:11.389 --> 00:39:17.790
Such a security, such a proper guidance
is there.

00:39:17.991 --> 00:39:22.019
Also you are saved from all kinds
of attacks

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:26.665
and all kinds of mistakes that you commit.

00:39:26.866 --> 00:39:34.156
It’s all such a big – I would say,
a Computer of Knowledge.

00:39:34.357 --> 00:39:41.212
He knows, It knows what you are doing
and what you should not do,

00:39:41.413 --> 00:39:47.147
where you are going and what should
not be your way.

00:39:47.348 --> 00:39:53.638
He knows, It knows everything, knows
everything about you.

00:39:53.839 --> 00:39:59.183
So then you have to become aware of It.

00:39:59.384 --> 00:40:03.828
Now this is the stage where I would say
that you have to be aware

00:40:04.029 --> 00:40:11.618
that you are realised-souls, you are
different,

00:40:11.819 --> 00:40:17.297
very unique. You are realised-souls,
you are not ordinary people.

00:40:17.498 --> 00:40:27.275
And that you are protected by this
Paramchaitanya. Nothing can change you,

00:40:27.476 --> 00:40:34.825
nothing can trouble you, nothing can
overpower you.

00:40:35.026 --> 00:40:40.088
Because you are not aware, also, of this
Paramachaitanya,

00:40:40.289 --> 00:40:44.073
that’s why you, a little bit, get worried.
And people write to me,

00:40:44.274 --> 00:40:48.317
“Mother, my - something wrong with
my daughter, something this thing."

00:40:48.518 --> 00:40:54.197
Everything can be corrected
by Paramchaitanya,

00:40:54.398 --> 00:40:58.447
if you know how to leave it to That,

00:40:59.264 --> 00:41:04.400
if you understand how you are one
with that Paramchaitanya,

00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:12.857
you are a part and parcel of that. And that
Paramchaitanya is looking after you.

00:41:13.058 --> 00:41:17.775
You don’t have [a] very conscious effort,

00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:23.794
there’s no need to have very conscious
effort. Accept life as it is.

00:41:23.995 --> 00:41:28.199
As it is, whatever life is there, accept.
Don’t retaliate,

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.983
don’t get angry, don’t get upset.
Just accept.

00:41:32.184 --> 00:41:37.040
And you’ll enjoy the same life which
was irritating you!

00:41:37.241 --> 00:41:43.253
You will see the enjoying part of that,
and it will be so beautiful

00:41:43.454 --> 00:41:47.810
the way you will see that you’ll get over
all your problems,

00:41:48.011 --> 00:41:50.543
you’ll get over all your enemies.

00:41:50.744 --> 00:41:58.123
And a kind of a very fresh, beautiful
existence you’ll have.

00:41:58.324 --> 00:42:05.445
So now, as you are all Sahaja Yogis,
is a very great position.

00:42:05.646 --> 00:42:13.085
With that, if you humble down, humble down,
then you’ll be amazed to see

00:42:13.286 --> 00:42:20.394
that, you are absolutely in contact with
this Paramchaitanya;

00:42:20.595 --> 00:42:25.221
not only that, but you have become
Paramchaitanya.

00:42:28.186 --> 00:42:32.719
With this Paramchaitanya you can do
anything.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:39.235
I need not tell you what you can do,
because some of you may not believe.

00:42:39.436 --> 00:42:45.318
But that’s [what] my own experience is,
that, if you are the Paramchaitanya,

00:42:45.519 --> 00:42:50.803
if you know you are the Paramchaitanya,
then it keeps your dignity,

00:42:51.004 --> 00:42:57.214
it keeps your position, it keeps your world
and looks after you.

00:42:57.415 --> 00:43:02.556
And whatever is just said or desired,
you just get it.

00:43:02.757 --> 00:43:08.669
Your desires also change. Your desires
are not for stupid things,

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:13.479
but for something that is very noble.

00:43:14.535 --> 00:43:20.488
Like, you want to transform people, you
want to do Sahaja Yoga work.

00:43:20.695 --> 00:43:24.733
All these desires are fulfilled fully,

00:43:24.934 --> 00:43:31.027
when you want to do it, you like it and
you think of it.

00:43:31.228 --> 00:43:35.163
It is something, even seeing something:

00:43:35.364 --> 00:43:39.831
if you see something and you are stunned
by that!

00:43:40.032 --> 00:43:48.867
Immediately Paramchaitanya will take over
and you will have no problems, no problems.

00:43:49.068 --> 00:43:57.313
Because the way we react to all these
difficulties and to so-called odds in life

00:43:57.514 --> 00:44:00.737
becomes a play, just a play.
You are amazed!

00:44:00.938 --> 00:44:05.114
You looked at it and finished!
Look at that, and finished!

00:44:05.315 --> 00:44:13.063
That is how it is the light, which goes into
the darkness and finishes the darkness.

00:44:13.264 --> 00:44:17.934
The darkness is finished, and our problems
are finished also.

00:44:18.135 --> 00:44:21.687
So this is what is our awareness has
to become.

00:44:21.888 --> 00:44:25.518
Awareness has to become Paramachaitanya.

00:44:25.719 --> 00:44:30.899
Then you get all the ideas, everything
that are Divine.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:38.592
But not only that, but also the help of
the Divine, all the solutions of the Divine.

00:44:38.793 --> 00:44:43.723
It’s something amazing! And everything
quietens down,

00:44:43.924 --> 00:44:50.232
everything settles down, and you are
amazed, watching all this,

00:44:50.433 --> 00:44:56.261
that you are the centre of doing
all these things.

00:44:56.462 --> 00:45:00.114
You are not aware that you are doing,
and you are this.

00:45:00.315 --> 00:45:04.786
That ego part is missing. But you
see it’s all happening around you,

00:45:04.987 --> 00:45:09.639
and then you are amazed how it is
happening.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:15.459
The whole lifestyle changes, the whole
understanding changes,

00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:22.143
and you become a great source of happiness,
joy and knowledge to others.

00:45:22.344 --> 00:45:28.609
You don’t have to study anything, you don’t
have to know much,

00:45:28.777 --> 00:45:34.938
but you will know about everything,
what is right and what is wrong.

00:45:36.089 --> 00:45:41.836
And then only you can tell the things
with complete authority

00:45:42.037 --> 00:45:47.370
that, “This is not right!” Like today,
we had a discussion on this point

00:45:47.571 --> 00:45:52.365
about the economic position and
the economics of modern times.

00:45:52.566 --> 00:46:00.192
I said, “Is all wrong, because it is
self-destructive.”

00:46:00.393 --> 00:46:06.867
It destroys the nations, if not your
nation, other nations.

00:46:07.068 --> 00:46:16.172
Then it also destroys your family life.
It destroys your value system.

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:23.619
It completely destroys you. So what sort
of an economics is this?

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:34.753
It’s just a show, just a, like a, you can
say, a balloon: it can burst any moment.

00:46:34.954 --> 00:46:38.294
I have seen people who are very rich,
very this thing,

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:43.898
think no end of themselves [then] become
bankrupt. And very bankrupt become rich.

00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:50.838
So it’s [a] kind of a turmoil in which
they are jumping,

00:46:51.039 --> 00:46:57.122
from one shore to another shore. But
you are not. You watch that drama.

00:46:57.323 --> 00:47:03.754
You see all that drama, and with your peace
you can see everything, very calmly.

00:47:03.955 --> 00:47:08.155
Not, it’s not difficult for you to create
more people like this.

00:47:08.356 --> 00:47:14.895
It’s not difficult to transform this world.
The time has come, just ripe time.

00:47:15.096 --> 00:47:19.345
Like when the proper time comes,
the blossom time comes,

00:47:19.546 --> 00:47:24.958
so many flowers become fruits. So,
like that, you all have become.

00:47:25.159 --> 00:47:30.394
Now it is for you to create seeds to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:30.595 --> 00:47:35.735
You are at that level of awareness now
where Paramchaitanya is with you,

00:47:35.936 --> 00:47:41.898
absolutely part and parcel of you,
absolutely with you to give you

00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:51.059
all necessary help, all necessary prestige,
and also the personality.

00:47:52.772 --> 00:47:55.578
May God bless you all.
