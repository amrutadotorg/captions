00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is a recording of the advice given by our Holiness Mataji on the occasion of three-day seminar held at Cowasji Jehangir Hall, from 19 to 21st March 1976.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is a recording of the first day that is of the 19th March 1976.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:55.950
After a very long time we are again assembled in this hall.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:13.946
When Sahaja Yoga was just in its infancy we had arranged the program in this hall.

00:01:23.526 --> 00:01:43.000
Since then, by God's grace, Sahaja Yoga has settled in the minds.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:02:01.879
The mind of the Sahaja Yogis as if the rain has been absorbed by the hungry earth.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for people who are superficial and not seeking within themselves

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
with all earnestness and the hankering of a seeker.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It is not meant for people who are seeking God in the books because God is not there.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It is also not meant for people who think they can achieve God, that they can by their

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:59.000
effort, by their extreme hutah as we call it, obstinacy, win the grace of God.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It is meant for those people who are from the heart all the time asking for Him and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:24.000
looking for Him for the genuine and for the reality.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Sahaja, I have told you many a times, sahaja means, saha means with and ja is born with you.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I have elaborately told you many a times what is Sahaja.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It is a spontaneous growth of your being into that infinite realm of God's place.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We have to enter into the kingdom of God, not by words, not by deeds, but it has to

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
be the actualization of the experience.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.830
If you are satisfied by the tomfoolery and the spiritual jugglery

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.000
that is going on, it is better you take to that course and be lost.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But for sahaja you have to be an earnest and a genuine seeker.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.693
Whatever mistakes you have committed in your search will be forgiven by God because He

00:04:33.783 --> 00:04:39.000
knows that it was in ignorance that all these mistakes were committed.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:53.000
We have here some sahaja yogis who know this, but when I see people and when I have been

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
experienced of them I am sometimes surprised the way they are contradictory to themselves.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.854
How they live with those contradictory ideas it is something beyond the imagination of

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.930
God Almighty also.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:22.483
It has been since ages one simple question, how to reach the infinite through this whole

00:05:22.543 --> 00:05:27.000
through this finite mind, through this rationality which God has given.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
This is the eternal problem which has been there from the times of Socrates, Confucius,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Kant, Hegel, all these great philosophers have been only asking this question in all

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.926
their findings and search how to reach the infinite through this finite.

00:05:56.256 --> 00:06:03.000
As it is human being is made that way that he has to worry for himself and worry also

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
about God's doing.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
He is also worried how God is going to give him this blessing.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Who has created you, who has created this universe, who has created this beautiful heaven

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000
for you here, but you are worried how is he going to give you that blessing by which you

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
will know the heaven within yourself.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000
You are worried how he is going to bestow upon you the bliss of self-knowledge.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000
You need not worry, it is His job.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:58.000
But He has made you like this, He has made you this way specially with a purpose.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The articulation of your personality came into being just like an egg develops a shell

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
around itself to grow.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.000
In the same way you also developed a shell in which you have to develop your personality,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000
your being in such a manner that ultimately you become the proper instrument to receive

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:40.477
that knowledge that is God, that is divine and then to emit it to others and to seek

00:07:40.577 --> 00:07:50.000
it to be aware of that, to be a saakshat, to be a witness of that divine flowing through you.

00:07:54.047 --> 00:08:01.970
Of course some of these philosophers never had any inkling of that divine.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Some of them did have, that's why there is such a disparity in what they seeking.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
But there have been really genuine people, most of them and they have been honest about

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
they are not finding it or finding it.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:29.000
But today is the worst time of hypocrisy known as Kali Yuga in which every Dick Tom Harry

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
has started claiming that he is the person who is going to introduce you to Him.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And he has found his own ideas and his own imagination to give you that this is how you

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
are going to receive Him and I have got it already.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000
There's one thing good about Kali Yuga is that all the ancient scriptures are for you

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
written down long time back and you have to tally it.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:11.000
If it is Bible it is there, if it is Quran it is there and if it is any one of the Vedas

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
it is there.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But when you start your new scriptures and new ideologies and try to fit in everything

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:34.000
according to that, when you try to mold God into your own cups of weaknesses, then how

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
can you be Sahaja spontaneous.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So the problem today in Kali Yuga is much worse than it was ever before because apart

00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:00.000
from the original articulation we have had, we have many more articulations on us.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:09.000
The worst of all is the mental articulation that we think by reading books, by talking

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.000
about books, by giving lectures or by receiving it through lectures we are going to achieve

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
it, you are sadly mistaken.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This is the greatest Maya or the illusion I think of the present day.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Other Mayas can be conquered but this is one of the most elusive temptations for the modern

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:46.000
man that he thinks by reading, by listening about God he is going to achieve.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It is a spontaneous.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Let us understand what is spontaneous.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Spontaneous is natural living thing that happens to us.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000
For example you see a seed when you plant it, it spontaneously grows.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:12.032
Do you stand on your head before that seed or do you read books or does the seed has

00:11:12.082 --> 00:11:16.050
to read the books of germination to get germinated?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.875
Not that, never.

00:11:20.025 --> 00:11:27.000
But it is only the human being who thinks so foolishly which an ordinary dog also doesn't

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000
think that way.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:38.000
You may say that there are books which are truthful, there are books which are pouring reality

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
but have you got any measure to know which are the books which are pouring reality and

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
which are not.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:55.000
There are gurus who are of course prospering materially better because they tell you, you

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000
take sannyasa, you take sannyas, you renounce and bring all the money to Me.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And foolishly so many human beings are attached and attracted towards such people.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Why?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Because our articulation has given us this darkness that we grow to something that is

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
false much faster than to reality.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000
We are shaken up within ourselves, we haven't got strength to hold to the reality, to ask

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
for the reality that they have to give us the reality.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.977
So anybody who speaks, you see in a bombastic manner, quotations after quotations reading,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
this reading, that giving you big lectures, people are very much fascinated.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000
They think by listening to lectures you are going to have it.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Never, never it is going to happen to you.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:09.000
You have been to so many lectures before, you have listened to so many people, there

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
have been many gurus good and bad.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Have you been able to make out who is a real guru and who is not?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000
How will you know that this man is talking from the seventh heaven?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It may be a rakshasa talking to you, it may be a devil incarnate in these horrible days,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.000
he could be anything who is talking to you.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000
What makes you believe that some person who is behaving like a God-man is a real God-man

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.000
or not?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
There is a way.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And that is why when there is a more necessity the things happen by which you know.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
You have to become something else to know what is what.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:23.000
You have to be reborn, you have to be baptized, you have to become a Brahmin, you have to

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
become a Musalma, you have to become a Christian.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000
You are to be reborn, you are born with a body, you are born with a mind which is articulated.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:48.000
You have to jump into that infinite love of God to know who is emitting that love.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And then the knowledge comes to you, unless and until your eyes are opened.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Don't believe into any personality because he knows how to impress you people and even

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:13.000
not me, unless and until I have been able to give you that which you are seeking.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
You must ask for the reality.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Ask for that from me.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I cannot give you anything else but that.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Unless and until you have had that experience, the actualization of that, of the Sahaja Yoga

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:40.000
by which you receive the blessings within yourself and you feel it and it emits through

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
your extremities and you see that power flowing through you, which is known as the Chaitanya

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Lahari, which was very well described by Adi Shankaracharya, whom nobody reads these days.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
They want to read somebody who talks of sex.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:06.879
The mind is so much attached to sex that everything must come through sex otherwise nothing goes here.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:14.000
These people who try to impress you, try to work on your weakness but a mother is not

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000
going to do that.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000
A mother is going to give you the real that is there and is going to tell you that, my

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
child, this has been wrong and you have to get detached from that idea and stand within

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.955
yourself.

00:16:32.905 --> 00:16:47.000
Every one of them those who have been great have been saying [Hindi/Sanskrit], but Hindus are the first

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
who will go to yoga, to Hatha Yoga.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:00.000
When Shankaracharya never did any one of these yoga, yogas are meant for very, very

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:08.000
few people, for very few people who live with a guru in the jungles.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.000
You have to do six things simultaneously under the guidance of any world.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
But everybody is trying to do yoga because they want to slim down.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
God is not to be used for this frivolous thing.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
All right you do exercise is different but this is no yoga.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Yoga means union with God.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
It is union with God.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
It is not the union with the worldly things that you think so important.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Those who go to the extremes of things are also no good for Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Extreme takes you away from reality which was said by Gautam Buddha.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
He said take to the middle part, keep to the middle part.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But his disciples have gone to the extreme part of foolishness.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:27.000
He said don't worship any gods and goddesses at that time because he was in Sahaja.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
So his disciples started worshipping his tooth, nails everything.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Of course that too has a meaning but not for people who are not realized.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:48.000
How can you make out whether the hair of Mohammed Sahib is in that place in Kashmir or it is

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
of some impostor?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Have you got any method by which you can detect?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I can say it is the hair of Mohammed Sahib.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I say that.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
But why should you accept me also?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:11.000
With all your brains and intelligence why should you accept anything which is not actually

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000
focused within your awareness, which is not brought within your awareness?

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.000
There is a method, there is a way, there is an education but it is spontaneous.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:42.000
It happens to you, you just become this education, comes to you in such a manner, in such a way

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
that even a child knows.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:50.000
It is a subjective knowledge that comes to you.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:02.000
When you jump into that Divine love through Sahaja Yoga then you become one with collective

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000
consciousness.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.000
It's not that I tell you that you are collectively conscious but you become conscious.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:19.000
For example now for me when I say that this saree has got a border, you will say yes of

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
course we know, we can see that.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:31.000
But if I say that you are all one bound by one string within yourself, oh we have big

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
organisations describing human beings, they are all brothers and sisters, we are all one,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
we have to be one nation.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
But this is just conditioning, artificial talking about it.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:51.000
But if you become a Sahaja Yogi immediately you know that you are one with another because

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
you can feel the other one.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000
It is fantastic but it is happening and it will happen to you also if this experience

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
dawns upon you.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.284
What do you feel in collective consciousness?

00:21:09.334 --> 00:21:14.010
For example I put my hand towards someone like this, immediately

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I can feel it what is the problem with the Kundalini of that person.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:26.167
That means immediately my fingers will indicate to me because they indicate all the chakras [unclear]

00:21:26.257 --> 00:21:31.000
and immediately I can decode it and say that this is the finger and that's why

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
there's a problem here in the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000
It's an absolute truth has been experimented but people do not want to see the truth, they

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
want to see some magic.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
It's an absolute truth once you put your hands towards somebody immediately a Sahaja

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Yogi can say that this person is suffering from some throat trouble and when that person

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
starts rubbing the hand the other person feels better.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
You can even feel a little lump in the throat here understanding that another person also

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
has got a problem.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
This is a fact, this is scientific.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:24.000
If I say something to you, you should just take it as a hypothesis but if it works in

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
you then you go ahead with it and see for yourself that these vibrations that are flowing

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
to you are they not working it out.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Luckily in Bombay now we have many Sahaja Yogis spread out all over the place who have

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:48.000
got vibrations and who have experimented but there is a university, Lahore University which

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:58.000
is working on the vegetables and the wheat and when they put this chaitanya, this divine

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:07.000
force on the wheat they found that it was ten times more than it was normal, it was

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
produced in such a large bulk.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
They have tried many experiments with this and they are amazed at the results that these

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000
vibrations produce on the vegetables and the food that we eat.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Of course they have published also in the papers but nobody wants to see the eyes open,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
want to know about it.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
This is the joke of this Kali Yuga.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
We have definitely cured people of cancer because it's the control of the parasympathetic

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000
that we arise after realization and cancer cannot be cured by anything else but Sahaja

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Yoga you take it down today.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:05.000
You cannot cure cancer without Sahaja Yoga, you may just give up some gap, you see some

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:13.000
sort of a stop gap arrangement could be done but you cannot cure because through the parasympathetic

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
nervous system only you can refill your sympathetic nervous system.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000
It is a fact and we have cured many cancer patients, there are some doctors who have

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
cured it, they are sitting down here but they are also breaking their heads because these

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
doctors do not want to come and open their eyes because they think their practice will

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
be lost, just think of that.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000
There was a doctor who we approached, he was a very well known surgeon, he was a cardiologist

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:54.000
of Bombay and he, when we approached him, we talked to him, he wouldn't just listen

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
to us even and we told him, I told him very frankly that doctor your own heart is in danger

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
be careful.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.990
He said how do you know, I said I can see your cardiac fat cells, it is absolutely

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:13.000
in a mud but he wouldn't believe that and he had a very bad heart which was discovered

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
after three four months and then he died of heart.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Today I read in the papers about cardiologists coming here, will they ever come and listen

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
to us and know that heart can be cured.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Now there is a patient here who was a heart patient has been cured by Sahaja Yoga because

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000
it is free, it is just flowing, you do not believe in love, you believe in money, if

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
you pay money to someone and if he cures you, you think it is something great because it

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
satisfies your ego.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
But if Mother says that by love, by this Divine love you can be cured, you will immediately

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000
how can that be?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:02.000
But curing is not the only point, that's not so important, of course it is a by-product.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Because when the Divine has to come into you, your body is cured.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000
But mentally also you must have heard how many mental stages we have cured.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.000
All mental stress and strain is due to the tension built up by the sympathetic nervous

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:34.725
system and when this tension is built up, you feel you are very tense, you have got

00:26:34.825 --> 00:26:41.000
high blood pressure, you have got all kinds of problems, even people are becoming mad

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000
now.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Specially in the affluent country I find people are very nervous because they have exhausted

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
their sympathetic flow and they have to fill in through the parasympathetic.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Despite all that, despite all that they will not ask for relaxation.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.000
When I say through Sahaja Yoga you can immediately get relaxation because your parasympathetic

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000
is filled in, the petrol that was exhausting is again filled in, they will not ask for

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
it.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
It is most amazing the way human beings are.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
But supposing tomorrow I take out a ring, diamond ring, even the people who are supposed

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
to be very rich would be running after it, haven't they got sufficient rings with

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000
them that they are running after rings?

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:48.000
I can understand people who have no money but it is the rich who are running after such

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
people who are giving them rings.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
There have been such horrible organizations in our country, it's shameful the way people

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
have been following them.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.000
You have heard of them, some of them are already landed in the [unclear].

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
All these money making things can only size because the human beings themselves are not

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000
yet ready, are not yet prepared to receive the reality but if they are not prepared a

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
day may come when the reality has to express itself.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
It will destroy all such people, it will have to destroy because it has to come.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000
You are to be tuned in such a manner that you receive that love but the same love when

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
you do not accept you will be thrown out of evolutionary process.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:51.000
The time is very short, believe me the time is very short.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Within two years time I have to tell you things are going to be decided.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:10.000
While people are already lost thanks to these thugs and these cheats who want to make money,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:24.000
shamelessly living on other people's money luxuriously selling their artificial enticements.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:35.000
At least a few, very few of them could take upon themselves that we are going to receive

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:41.000
the reality, we are asking for the reality you can save the humanity even today.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Sahaja Yoga if you say it is My discovery I would say it is not.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
It is the discovery of this age, the discovery of the seekers, those who have been hankering

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
for it, those who have been asking for it, so God says all right have it now.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
But when it comes to have it they don't want to have it.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Like Tulsi Dasa wrote all his Tulsi Ramayana and when Shri Rama Himself appeared before

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:22.000
him He put a tilak on his head and still he could not recognize who was Shri Ram.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
You must understand that God cannot allow His creation to be destroyed.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
He must have made some provision within you.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.962
He must have made some sort of arrangement within you to enlighten you at a point when

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
there will be complete darkness.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000
This is the time of complete darkness, at this time the light has to come.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:59.000
How it happens, how it works out, there is an engineering behind it, no doubt there is.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:10.000
What God has planned into you, how a human being is made and what has brought out all

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
these happenings in the Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:20.000
I will be discussing tomorrow explaining to you, I have done it many a times about Kundalini

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
but I'll also give you the side effects of Kundalini, the way people have misused

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
the name, the word Kundalini that is your Mother.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
That I will tell you tomorrow.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:40.000
It is no use wasting time in talking, as you all are here I think it is better that for

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
a short time if you could go into meditation, let us see if it works out in some of you.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Then tomorrow at ten o'clock we are having the meditation.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Do come for that.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
You will not come for meditation today but after six months when I come back from London

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
then there will be a row of people for curing them.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
It's something surprising the way we are.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
There are so many people whom I tell that why don't you come for Sahaja Yoga, why

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.833
don't you get it instead of getting cancer later on and waiting in my house for hours

00:32:15.893 --> 00:32:20.000
to get a darshan of Mataji.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000
What has happened to our brains if I say that I give you something that is eternal which

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000
will give you a complete cure and a curative power yourself, not only but you can raise

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
the Kundalini of others and give realization to others.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
It is such a fantastic thing in a bundle I want to give you but you want to come to my

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
house for treatment.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
I told them why don't you come to my program.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
They said no Mother we want to get cured.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.898
There are so many wrestlers who come to me Mother give us peace why don't you come

00:32:56.948 --> 00:32:58.458
to our program.

00:32:58.478 --> 00:33:00.010
No Mother you give us peace.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
We command, we command God.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
You give us this, you do this for us, do that for us.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
What is your right to do that?

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
How do you command God all the time that you must do this for me, you must do that.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Are you connected with Him?

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Have you entered into His citizenship?

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
You have not.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000
You have no right on Him but when you start calling His name Rama Rama Rama Rama who appears

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
before you is a Ramagadi, is a servant.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
God does not want the homages of slaves.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Unless and until you are liberated you have no right on God but once you are liberated

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:52.000
He comes, He acts, He looks after you, He does everything.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:58.619
Whether He does it or not you should come and receive it and see for yourself.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
We see a temple here we'll say all right very good we must say Namaskar.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000
If you go to a church we'll nicely sing a same oh we've been to church on a Sunday, finished.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And then when there is a problem oh God please save my Mother, she is very sick.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Oh God give job to my husband, oh God look after my children.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Why because you have just said Namaskar to me.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
But you don't have to do anything, only thing from your heart you have to say oh Lord shine

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
into me, give me light, enlighten me, that's all.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
You don't have to say anything it just works like that.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000
But are we that genuine, is our attention that free?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Our attention is lost into so many things.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000
This attention is created, human attention is specially created only to enter into that

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
divine ocean.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.000
While our attention is lost into such things that are absolutely useless.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:09.000
And temporary which we are not seeking really is a camouflage.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
We think we are seeking in that we are not.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
If you are seeking joy and bliss then ask for it.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
You have to just ask for it and you'll have.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
The time has come, the blossom time has come, that's why it is going to work out.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Of course it cannot be a plastic production but it is going to be a mark.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Many people are going to get realization and have got it.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
You know in Bombay there are many people who have got it.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:51.000
But there are very few who have reached a height and they have kept there but so many

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
of them they rise and come down, they rise and come down.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
They do not settle.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
You have to steady your goals when you get into it.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
That is also can be done through Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
So many of you have now done it.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
You have to do it.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
That is the time you have to do it after realization.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Before realization no religion has any meaning for you, no religious ritual or anything whatsoever,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000
the prayers or anything has any help for you.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Actually very few of those high spirited people, I should say the great people who were born,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
the evolved people did not know that you are not even awakened.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:48.000
They did not know this point because when I read their books I feel that just like small

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
children they have said that you hold the force in your, vital force in your heart and

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
raise it.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
How can you raise it?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
There is no vital force already awakened.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
You are not even awakened people.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
How can you?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:11.000
There is only an inkling, abhas, towards spiritual running.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
But you are not even awakened people.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
How can you do the things that they have to?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
It's so artificial when you will know through Sahaja Yoga, you will really feel like laughing

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
at those things.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
So let us have the experiment of Sahaja Yoga which I have told you is the simplest thing

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000
and you don't have to do anything.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
It's like one light which is enlightened has to enlighten another light.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
The light which is not yet enlightened cannot do anything about it but once it is enlightened

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
it has to give light to others.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
There are many Sahaja Yogis and also there are new people I can see them.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Let us work it out and tomorrow also do come for meditation.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
After meditation I will also have a purity which I have not announced in the paper because

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
I know there will be thousands of them coming here.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Let me first make some good doctors and we have made some very good doctors.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Nobody is barred.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Everybody is invited with great love and with great honor.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Do come, it is your mother's own cooking.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
It's your own mother's giving which does not mean giving.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Actually by giving you only I feel relieved it is like that.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:51.000
So it's more you are doing an obligation towards Me than I am doing anything to you

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
because I cannot receive anything I can only give that's my problem.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
I would request you to put your hands towards Me this way.
