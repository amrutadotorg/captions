AI GENERATED. This is a recording

1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.359
Of

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.849
the advice given by Holiness Mataji

3
00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.969
on the occasion

4
00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:11.659
of three-day seminar held at Kawaji Yongir Hall from

5
00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:13.750
19

6
00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:18.020
to 21st March 1976.

7
00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:20.290
This is a recording of the first day,

8
00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:21.510
that is of

9
00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.930
the 19th March 1976.

10
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.250
Don't let the

11
00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:49.080
After a very long time.

12
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.549
We are again assembled in this hall.

13
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.009
When Sergio was

14
00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.400
Just

15
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.870
In its infancy.

16
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.220
We had arranged a programme in this hall.

17
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.279
Since then

18
00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:29.849
By God's grace

19
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.379
The yoga.

20
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.699
Ha

21
00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:43.059
In the mind

22
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:47.949
Of the 3iovi.

23
00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:51.010
I

24
00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:53.620
The rain

25
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.180
Has been absorbed.

26
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.839
By the hungry earth.

27
00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.589
Saha yoga is not man.

28
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.680
For people

29
00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:10.110
Who are superficial?

30
00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.630
And not seeking within themselves with all earnestness.

31
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.570
And the hankering

32
00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.830
All for

33
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.690
It is not meant

34
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.300
for people who are seeking God.

35
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.070
In the books

36
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.210
Because God is not there.

37
00:02:34.149 --> 00:02:37.179
It is also not meant for people who think.

38
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.339
They can achieve God.

39
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.729
That

40
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.029
they can by their efforts.

41
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.710
By their

42
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.839
extreme

43
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.800
Hot as we call it.

44
00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:55.990
Obstinacy.

45
00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.970
Win the grace

46
00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:58.669
of God.

47
00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.839
It is meant for those people.

48
00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.100
Who are from the heart

49
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.960
all the time asking for him

50
00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.000
and looking for him

51
00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.529
for the genuine and for the reality.

52
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.889
Sahaja,

53
00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.179
I have told you many a times.

54
00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.649
Sahaja means Saha meansanja is born.

55
00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:38.360
I've elaborately told you many a times what is the haja.

56
00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:46.139
It is a spontaneous growth of your being into that infinite realm

57
00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:47.550
of God'sness.

58
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.910
We have to enter into the kingdom of God.

59
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.000
Not by words,

60
00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:56.229
not by deed,

61
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.750
but it has to be the actualization of the experience.

62
00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.850
If you are satisfied.

63
00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.929
By the tomfoolery and the spiritual jugglery that is going on,

64
00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.010
it is better you take to that course and be lost.

65
00:04:18.869 --> 00:04:19.950
But for Sahaja,

66
00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.730
you have to be an earnest and a genuine.

67
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.019
Whatever mistakes you have committed.

68
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.420
In your search

69
00:04:29.989 --> 00:04:30.950
will be forgiven.

70
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:32.809
By God,

71
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.679
because he knows that it was in ignorance

72
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.739
that all these mistakes.

73
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.989
We have here some yogis who know this.

74
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.750
But

75
00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:51.570
When I see people.

76
00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:55.029
And when I have experience of them,

77
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.630
I'm sometimes surprised

78
00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.279
the way they are contradictory to themselves.

79
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.640
How they live with those contradictory ideas,

80
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.899
it is something

81
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.799
beyond the imagination of God Almighty.

82
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.630
It has been

83
00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:13.059
Since

84
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.200
E

85
00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:17.390
One simple question.

86
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.239
How to reach the infinite.

87
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.049
Through this finite mind,

88
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.519
through this rationality which God has given.

89
00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.089
This is the eternal problem which has been there

90
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.779
from the times of Socrates,

91
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.059
Confucius.

92
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.820
Hegel,

93
00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:40.369
all these great

94
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.390
Philosophers

95
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.260
have been only asking this question

96
00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:49.220
in all their findings and search

97
00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:52.989
how to reach the infinite through this fine art.

98
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:57.410
As it is,

99
00:05:57.429 --> 00:05:58.320
human being

100
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.239
is made that way,

101
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.809
that he has to worry for himself and worry also about God's doing.

102
00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:09.269
He is also worried how God is going to give him this blessing.

103
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.410
Who has created you,

104
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.700
who has created this universe,

105
00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:16.859
who has

106
00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:19.380
created this beautiful

107
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.019
heaven for you here?

108
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.179
But you are worried,

109
00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:26.500
how is he going to give you

110
00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:29.910
that blessing by which you will know the heaven within yourself.

111
00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.350
You're worried how he is going

112
00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:35.890
to bestow on you.

113
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.670
The bliss of self knowledge.

114
00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:42.119
You need not worry.

115
00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:44.359
It is his job

116
00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:48.640
But he has made you like this.

117
00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:54.510
He has made you this way,

118
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.519
especially.

119
00:06:56.609 --> 00:06:56.970
With a

120
00:06:59.359 --> 00:07:02.670
The articulation of your personality came into being.

121
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.170
Just like an egg.

122
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.950
Develops a shell around itself to grow

123
00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:14.600
in the same way you also develop a shell.

124
00:07:16.929 --> 00:07:19.959
In which you have to develop your personality,

125
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.019
your being in such a manner.

126
00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:27.320
That ultimately you become the proper instrument to receive.

127
00:07:28.549 --> 00:07:29.959
That knowledge.

128
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.519
That is God that is divine.

129
00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.000
And then to emit it.

130
00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:37.510
To others

131
00:07:39.429 --> 00:07:43.329
And to seek it to be aware of that,

132
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.640
to be a sash,

133
00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:48.529
to be a witness of that divine flowing through you.

134
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.820
Of course

135
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.369
Some of these philosophers never had any inkling of that device.

136
00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:03.510
Some of them did have.

137
00:08:03.549 --> 00:08:06.230
That's why there's such a disparity in what they see.

138
00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:10.929
But there have been really genuine people,

139
00:08:11.049 --> 00:08:11.850
most of them.

140
00:08:13.269 --> 00:08:15.570
And they have been honest about

141
00:08:16.049 --> 00:08:18.329
them not finding it or finding it.

142
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.850
But today is the

143
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.989
Worst time

144
00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:24.690
of hypocrisy

145
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.739
known as Kaliba

146
00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:31.899
in which every dictum Harry has started claiming that he is

147
00:08:31.899 --> 00:08:34.859
the person who is going to introduce you to him.

148
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.950
And he has formed his own ideas and his own.

149
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.549
Imagination to give you that this is how you are

150
00:08:44.549 --> 00:08:46.580
going to receive it and I have got it already.

151
00:08:50.719 --> 00:08:53.030
There's one thing good about Kalijuga is.

152
00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:54.609
That

153
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:59.650
all the ancient scriptures are for you written down a long time back,

154
00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:01.780
and you have to tell it.

155
00:09:03.099 --> 00:09:04.570
If it is Bible,

156
00:09:04.739 --> 00:09:05.650
it is there.

157
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.150
If it is Koran,

158
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.090
it is there,

159
00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:09.570
and if it is

160
00:09:10.109 --> 00:09:11.099
one of the Vedars,

161
00:09:11.109 --> 00:09:11.859
it is there.

162
00:09:13.599 --> 00:09:17.789
But when you start your new scriptures and new ideology,

163
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.429
And try to fit in everything according to that.

164
00:09:24.619 --> 00:09:24.630
When

165
00:09:24.929 --> 00:09:29.080
you try to mould God into your own cups of weaknesses.

166
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580
Then,

167
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.450
how can you be Sahajaon thing?

168
00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:43.000
So the problem problem today in Kaliba.

169
00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:47.010
Is much worse than it was ever before,

170
00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:51.609
because apart from the original articulation we have had.

171
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.109
We have

172
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.919
Many more

173
00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.880
Articulations on us.

174
00:10:01.289 --> 00:10:05.000
The worst of all is the mental articulation.

175
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.380
That we think by reading books,

176
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.210
by talking about books,

177
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.809
by giving lectures or by receiving it through lectures,

178
00:10:13.929 --> 00:10:15.289
we are going to achieve.

179
00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:16.809
You are sadly mistaken.

180
00:10:18.929 --> 00:10:20.289
This is the greatest

181
00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:23.109
Maya or the illusion I think of the present.

182
00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:26.219
Other Maya

183
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.190
Can be

184
00:10:28.479 --> 00:10:29.469
conquered,

185
00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:31.869
but this is one of the

186
00:10:32.599 --> 00:10:34.309
most elusive

187
00:10:34.719 --> 00:10:39.200
temptation for the modern man that he thinks by reading.

188
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.659
By listening about God,

189
00:10:42.789 --> 00:10:44.309
he is going to achieve.

190
00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:49.799
It is a spontaneous.

191
00:10:50.969 --> 00:10:53.200
Let us understand what is spontaneous.

192
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:58.000
Spontaneous is natural living thing that happens to us.

193
00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:00.080
For example,

194
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.429
you see a seed,

195
00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:02.669
when you plant it,

196
00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:04.669
it spontaneously grows.

197
00:11:04.799 --> 00:11:07.349
Do you stand on your head before that seed,

198
00:11:07.479 --> 00:11:08.909
or do you read books,

199
00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:10.630
or does the

200
00:11:10.789 --> 00:11:14.359
the seed has to read the books of germination to get germinated?

201
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:17.260
Not that

202
00:11:18.789 --> 00:11:19.539
Never,

203
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.179
but

204
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.909
It is only the human beings

205
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.679
who think so foolishly,

206
00:11:25.849 --> 00:11:28.200
which an ordinary dog also doesn't think that.

207
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.859
You may say that

208
00:11:32.219 --> 00:11:33.950
There are books which are.

209
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.530
There are books which are boring reality.

210
00:11:39.599 --> 00:11:42.429
But have you got any measure to know which are

211
00:11:42.429 --> 00:11:45.549
the books which are for reality and which are not?

212
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.650
There are gurus

213
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.140
Who are

214
00:11:50.349 --> 00:11:51.729
of course prospering

215
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.380
materially better.

216
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.559
Because they tell you you take Sanya,

217
00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.890
you take Sanya,

218
00:11:57.979 --> 00:12:00.409
you renounce and bring all the money to me.

219
00:12:02.119 --> 00:12:05.299
And foolishly so many human beings are attached

220
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.580
and attracted to such people.

221
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:11.169
Why?

222
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.179
Because

223
00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:16.080
Our articulation has

224
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:21.919
Given us this darkness that we grow up to something that is false much faster

225
00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:23.369
than to reality.

226
00:12:25.049 --> 00:12:26.760
We are shaken up within ourselves.

227
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.590
We haven't got strength

228
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.489
to

229
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.080
hold to the reality,

230
00:12:31.119 --> 00:12:33.510
to ask for the reality that

231
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.599
they have to give us the reality.

232
00:12:38.479 --> 00:12:40.250
So anybody who speaks,

233
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.280
you see in a bombastic manner,

234
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.400
quotations after quotations,

235
00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:45.010
reading this,

236
00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:45.890
reading that,

237
00:12:45.969 --> 00:12:47.280
giving you big lectures,

238
00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:50.010
people are very much fascinated.

239
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:55.020
They think by listening to lectures

240
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.640
you are going to have

241
00:12:57.429 --> 00:12:57.700
never,

242
00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:58.429
never.

243
00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:01.380
It is going to happen to you.

244
00:13:02.849 --> 00:13:05.159
You have been to so many lectures before.

245
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.619
You have listened to so many people.

246
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.419
There have been many gurus,

247
00:13:10.479 --> 00:13:11.619
good and bad.

248
00:13:13.809 --> 00:13:18.280
Have you been able to make out who is a real guru and who is not?

249
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:21.820
How did you know?

250
00:13:23.179 --> 00:13:23.190
That

251
00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:26.770
this man is talking from the 7th heaven.

252
00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.919
It may be a Rakshaha talking to you.

253
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.239
It may be a devil incarnate in these

254
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:35.840
horrible day.

255
00:13:36.489 --> 00:13:38.020
He could be anything

256
00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:39.330
who is talking to you.

257
00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.909
What makes you believe that some person?

258
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:47.849
Who is

259
00:13:49.369 --> 00:13:53.570
Behaving like a godman is a real godman or not?

260
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.979
There is a way.

261
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.789
And that is why when there is more necessity,

262
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.669
the things happen by which you know.

263
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.169
You have to become something else to know what is.

264
00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.799
You have to be reborn.

265
00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:20.650
You have to be baptised.

266
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.729
You have to become a Brahmin.

267
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.570
You have to become a Musalmah.

268
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:25.979
You have to become a Christian.

269
00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.710
You are to be reborn,

270
00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:31.669
you are born with a body,

271
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.479
you are born with a mind,

272
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.719
which is articulated.

273
00:14:37.239 --> 00:14:39.830
You have to jump into that infinite.

274
00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.369
Love of God.

275
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.340
To know

276
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.599
who is emitting that love.

277
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.539
And then the knowledge comes to you unless and until your eyes are open.

278
00:14:53.909 --> 00:14:59.429
Don't believe into any personality because he knows how to impress you.

279
00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:02.359
And even not me.

280
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.429
Unless and until I've been able to give you that which you are.

281
00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.219
You must ask for the reality.

282
00:15:16.349 --> 00:15:17.900
Ask for that from me.

283
00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.900
I cannot give you anything else but that.

284
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.659
Unless and until you have had that experience,

285
00:15:28.729 --> 00:15:30.169
the actualization of that.

286
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.679
Of the sai yoga by which

287
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.510
You receive the blessings within yourself and you

288
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.500
feel it and it emits through your extremities

289
00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:44.619
and you see that power flowing through you,

290
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.280
which is known as the Chaitanellahari.

291
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.929
Which was very well described by Avi Shankaraja,

292
00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:53.479
whom nobody reads these days.

293
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:56.539
They want to reach somebody who talks of sex.

294
00:15:57.469 --> 00:15:59.460
The mind is so much attached

295
00:15:59.659 --> 00:16:00.590
to sex

296
00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:03.539
that everything must come through sex,

297
00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:04.979
otherwise nothing goes here.

298
00:16:08.289 --> 00:16:12.530
These people who try to impress you try to work on your weakness.

299
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.849
But a mother is not going to do that.

300
00:16:16.099 --> 00:16:18.289
A mother is going to give you the

301
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.809
real that is there and is going to tell you that my child,

302
00:16:23.099 --> 00:16:25.940
this has been wrong and you have to get

303
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.059
detached from that idea and stand within yourself.

304
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.070
Every one of them,

305
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.280
those who have been great,

306
00:16:35.369 --> 00:16:36.359
have been saying.

307
00:16:40.619 --> 00:16:41.260
The yoga.

308
00:16:44.099 --> 00:16:45.080
Chanarra Charez

309
00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.039
But Hindus are the first who will go to yoga,

310
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:50.450
to hat yoga.

311
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.640
When Shankaracharya never did any one of these yoga.

312
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:00.140
Yogas are meant for very,

313
00:17:00.179 --> 00:17:01.099
very few people.

314
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:04.310
For very few people who live

315
00:17:04.689 --> 00:17:05.400
with a guru.

316
00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.170
In the jungle

317
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:14.848
You have to do 6 things simultaneously under the guidance of any wars.

318
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.400
But everybody is trying to do yoga because they want to slim down.

319
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.199
God is not to be used for this frivolous things.

320
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.910
All right,

321
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:27.598
you do exercise is different,

322
00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.910
but this is no yoga.

323
00:17:29.989 --> 00:17:31.949
Yoga means union with God.

324
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.459
It is union with God.

325
00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.349
It is not

326
00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.670
The union with the worldly things that you think were important.

327
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:48.050
Those

328
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.300
who go to the extremes of things.

329
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.739
Are also no good

330
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:53.780
for Sahajo.

331
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.310
Extreme

332
00:17:58.719 --> 00:17:59.619
Takes you

333
00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:03.880
Away from reality which was said by Gautam Buddha,

334
00:18:04.869 --> 00:18:05.300
he said,

335
00:18:05.349 --> 00:18:06.390
take to the many.

336
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.489
Keep to the middle part.

337
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.890
But his disciples

338
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.119
Have gone to the extreme part.

339
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.790
Or foolish

340
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.359
He said,

341
00:18:21.439 --> 00:18:24.670
Don't worship any gods and goddesses at that time,

342
00:18:25.199 --> 00:18:26.609
because he was in Sahaja.

343
00:18:27.699 --> 00:18:30.209
So his disciples started worshipping his tooth,

344
00:18:30.339 --> 00:18:30.949
nail

345
00:18:31.709 --> 00:18:32.050
everything.

346
00:18:33.439 --> 00:18:35.630
Of course that too has a meaning,

347
00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.589
but not for people who are not realised.

348
00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:40.640
How can you make out

349
00:18:40.839 --> 00:18:42.140
whether the hair

350
00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.199
or mamaab is in that place in Kashmir

351
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.829
or it is of some.

352
00:18:49.719 --> 00:18:50.430
Import

353
00:18:51.439 --> 00:18:54.839
Have you got any method by which you can detect?

354
00:18:55.739 --> 00:18:58.500
I can say it is the hair of Moan.

355
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:00.089
I say that.

356
00:19:01.109 --> 00:19:03.300
But why should they accept me also?

357
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.260
With all your brains and intelligence,

358
00:19:07.599 --> 00:19:11.930
why should you accept anything which is not actually focused

359
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.910
within your awareness,

360
00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.640
which is not brought within your awareness.

361
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.109
There is a method,

362
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.569
there is a way,

363
00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.599
there is an education,

364
00:19:25.979 --> 00:19:27.699
but it is a spontaneous.

365
00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.130
It happens to you,

366
00:19:31.479 --> 00:19:32.680
you just become.

367
00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.260
This education

368
00:19:36.699 --> 00:19:38.939
comes to you in such a manner.

369
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.329
In such a way

370
00:19:42.189 --> 00:19:44.060
That even a child knows.

371
00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.770
It is a subjective knowledge that comes to me.

372
00:19:50.969 --> 00:19:52.660
When you jump into

373
00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.130
that divine love

374
00:19:54.489 --> 00:19:55.560
through Sahajeo.

375
00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:56.810
Then

376
00:19:57.949 --> 00:19:58.989
you become one.

377
00:20:01.479 --> 00:20:02.920
With collective consciousness.

378
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.599
It's not that I tell you that you are collectively conscious,

379
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.469
but you become conscious.

380
00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:10.569
For example,

381
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.229
now,

382
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.359
for me.

383
00:20:14.449 --> 00:20:17.920
When I say that this sari has got a border,

384
00:20:18.489 --> 00:20:19.040
you will say,

385
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:19.290
yes,

386
00:20:19.369 --> 00:20:20.569
of course we know we can.

387
00:20:23.239 --> 00:20:27.479
But if I say that you are all one bound by one

388
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:29.319
string within yourself.

389
00:20:30.319 --> 00:20:30.550
Oh,

390
00:20:30.589 --> 00:20:33.510
we have big organisations describing human beings.

391
00:20:33.589 --> 00:20:35.150
They are all brothers and sisters.

392
00:20:35.229 --> 00:20:36.030
We are all one.

393
00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:37.469
We have to be one nation.

394
00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.650
But this is just conditioning artificial talking about.

395
00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:44.209
But

396
00:20:45.469 --> 00:20:47.530
If you become a sur yogi,

397
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.550
immediately you know that you are one with

398
00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.310
another because you can feel the other one.

399
00:20:54.729 --> 00:20:55.839
It is fantastic,

400
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.709
but it is happening and it will happen to you also if

401
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.479
this experience

402
00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.479
dawns upon.

403
00:21:07.079 --> 00:21:09.000
What do you feel in collective consciousness?

404
00:21:09.079 --> 00:21:09.589
For example,

405
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:11.589
I put my hand towards someone

406
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.310
like this.

407
00:21:13.869 --> 00:21:15.670
Immediately I can feel it.

408
00:21:15.839 --> 00:21:18.479
What is the problem with the kundalini of that first.

409
00:21:19.349 --> 00:21:22.579
That means immediately my fingers will indicate to

410
00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:25.180
me because they indicate all the chakras.

411
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.010
And immediately I can decode it and say that this is the finger and that's

412
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:36.489
why there's a problem here in the Vishu is an absolute truth has been experimented.

413
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:40.109
But people do not want to see the truth.

414
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.770
They want to see some magic.

415
00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:46.369
It's an absolute truth.

416
00:21:46.619 --> 00:21:48.689
Once you put your hands towards somebody,

417
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.819
immediately a Saha Yogi can say that this

418
00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:54.859
person is suffering from some throat trouble.

419
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.790
And when that person starts

420
00:21:58.829 --> 00:21:59.729
Rubbing the hand,

421
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.300
the other person feels better.

422
00:22:02.689 --> 00:22:05.829
You can even feel a little lump in the throat here,

423
00:22:06.839 --> 00:22:09.790
understanding that another person also has got a problem.

424
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.069
This is a fact.

425
00:22:15.439 --> 00:22:16.719
This is scientific.

426
00:22:18.099 --> 00:22:19.790
If I say something to you,

427
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.760
you should just take it as a hypothesis,

428
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.680
but if it works in you,

429
00:22:24.689 --> 00:22:26.060
then you go ahead with it

430
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:30.319
and see for yourself that these vibrations that are flowing through you,

431
00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.969
are they not working it out?

432
00:22:32.979 --> 00:22:33.770
Luckily

433
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:34.859
in Bombay.

434
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.010
Now we have

435
00:22:38.589 --> 00:22:38.619
many Savi.

436
00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:41.349
Spread out all over the place,

437
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.439
who have got vibrations and who have experimented.

438
00:22:45.209 --> 00:22:46.859
But there is a university,

439
00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.060
Rahu University,

440
00:22:48.469 --> 00:22:50.469
which is working on.

441
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.449
The vegetables

442
00:22:52.819 --> 00:22:54.089
and the wheat

443
00:22:54.619 --> 00:22:56.619
and when they put this titania.

444
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.119
This divine force on the wheat,

445
00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:03.050
they found that it was 10 times more.

446
00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.250
Than it was normal,

447
00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:09.839
it was produced in such a large bulk.

448
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.890
They have tried many experiments with this,

449
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.040
and they're amazed at the results that these vibrations produce

450
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:18.989
on the

451
00:23:19.609 --> 00:23:20.569
vegetable

452
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:21.300
and

453
00:23:21.449 --> 00:23:22.810
the food that we eat.

454
00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:26.359
Of course they are published also in the papers,

455
00:23:26.609 --> 00:23:30.770
but nobody wants to see that our eyes open,

456
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.199
want to know about it,

457
00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.599
the joke.

458
00:23:37.209 --> 00:23:37.920
Of

459
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:38.920
this.

460
00:23:40.099 --> 00:23:43.310
We have definitely cured people of cancer because

461
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:46.339
it's the control of the parasympathetic that we arrive

462
00:23:47.069 --> 00:23:48.430
after realisation.

463
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.439
And cancer cannot be cured by anything else but surgical,

464
00:23:53.489 --> 00:23:55.140
you take it down today.

465
00:23:56.689 --> 00:24:00.290
You cannot cure cancer without surgery.

466
00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.390
You may just give up

467
00:24:03.089 --> 00:24:03.819
some gap.

468
00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.109
You see some sort of a

469
00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:08.699
stopgap arrangement could be done,

470
00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.390
but you cannot feel.

471
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.849
Because through the parasympathetic nervous system,

472
00:24:13.939 --> 00:24:17.829
only you can refill your sympathetic nervous system.

473
00:24:18.099 --> 00:24:19.180
It is a fact.

474
00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:22.270
And we have cured

475
00:24:22.619 --> 00:24:23.699
many cancer patients.

476
00:24:23.739 --> 00:24:26.459
There are some doctors who have cured it that are sitting down here.

477
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.369
But they are also breaking their heads

478
00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:33.250
because these doctors do not want to come

479
00:24:33.699 --> 00:24:37.810
and open their eyes because they think their practise will be lost.

480
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.020
Just think of that.

481
00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:42.719
There was a doctor whom he approached.

482
00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.750
He was a very

483
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.510
well known surgeon.

484
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:46.619
Oh,

485
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.020
he was a cardiologist

486
00:24:48.229 --> 00:24:49.030
of Bombay.

487
00:24:49.859 --> 00:24:50.579
And he,

488
00:24:50.709 --> 00:24:51.589
when we approached him,

489
00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:52.579
we talked to him,

490
00:24:52.869 --> 00:24:53.619
he wouldn't just,

491
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.930
you see,

492
00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:54.760
listen to us even,

493
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:56.420
and we told him,

494
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.270
I told him very frankly that doctor,

495
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.750
your own heart is in danger,

496
00:24:59.829 --> 00:25:00.349
be careful.

497
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:01.109
He said,

498
00:25:01.189 --> 00:25:01.630
how do you know?

499
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:01.869
I said,

500
00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:03.069
I can feel your

501
00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:06.069
cardiac flexor and it is absolutely in a mud.

502
00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:09.920
But he wouldn't believe that.

503
00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.109
And he had a very bad heart which was discovered after

504
00:25:14.109 --> 00:25:16.000
3 or 4 months and then he died of heart.

505
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.579
Today I read in the papers about cardiologists coming here.

506
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.329
Will they ever come and listen to us and

507
00:25:23.699 --> 00:25:25.459
know that heart can be cured.

508
00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.369
Now there is a patient here who was a heart patient has been cured

509
00:25:29.939 --> 00:25:30.540
by surgery.

510
00:25:33.079 --> 00:25:34.349
Because it is free,

511
00:25:34.479 --> 00:25:36.030
it is just flowing.

512
00:25:36.239 --> 00:25:38.069
You do not believe in love.

513
00:25:38.479 --> 00:25:39.709
You believe in money.

514
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.589
If you pay money to someone and if he cures you,

515
00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.890
you think it is something great because it satisfies your ego.

516
00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:49.280
But if mother says that by love,

517
00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:50.699
by this divine love,

518
00:25:50.829 --> 00:25:51.699
you can be cured,

519
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:52.469
you will immediately,

520
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.439
how can that be?

521
00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.780
But curing is not the only point.

522
00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:01.280
That's not so important.

523
00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:03.140
Of course it is a byproduct

524
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:05.500
because when the divine has to come into you,

525
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:06.969
your body is cured.

526
00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.310
But mentally.

527
00:26:11.719 --> 00:26:14.589
You must have heard how many mental cases we have here.

528
00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.020
All mental stress and strain

529
00:26:20.329 --> 00:26:23.890
is due to the tension built up by the sympathetic nervous system.

530
00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:26.380
And when

531
00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:32.199
Tension is built up.

532
00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:34.369
You feel you are very tense.

533
00:26:34.469 --> 00:26:36.170
You have got high blood pressure,

534
00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:38.729
you have got all kinds of problems,

535
00:26:38.859 --> 00:26:41.140
even people are becoming mad now.

536
00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.260
Especially in the African country,

537
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.000
I find people are very nervous

538
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:48.140
because they have exhausted their sympathetic flow and

539
00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.420
they have to fill in through the parasite.

540
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.050
Despite all that,

541
00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.319
Despite all that,

542
00:26:59.689 --> 00:27:01.810
they will not ask for relaxation.

543
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.430
When I say through er,

544
00:27:04.949 --> 00:27:07.260
you can immediately get relaxation

545
00:27:07.829 --> 00:27:08.189
because

546
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.569
Your parasympathetic is filled in.

547
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.810
The petrol that was exhausting is again filled in.

548
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.560
They will not ask for it.

549
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.369
It is most amazing the way human beings are,

550
00:27:22.819 --> 00:27:26.119
but supporting tomorrow I take out a ring,

551
00:27:26.459 --> 00:27:27.650
diamond ring.

552
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.420
Even the people who are supposed to be very rich would be running.

553
00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:33.520
After it,

554
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:36.000
haven't they got sufficient rings with them

555
00:27:36.209 --> 00:27:38.050
that they're running after rings?

556
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.699
I can understand people who have no money.

557
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:50.410
But it is the rich who are running after such people who are giving them rings.

558
00:27:52.579 --> 00:27:56.219
There have been such horrible organisations in our country.

559
00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.280
It's shameful the way people have been following them.

560
00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:00.520
You have heard of them.

561
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:02.430
Some of them are already landed in the gene.

562
00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:08.609
All these money making things can only thrive

563
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.119
because the human beings themselves are not.

564
00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:14.150
Yet ready

565
00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.150
They are not yet prepared to receive the reality,

566
00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:20.099
but if they are not prepared,

567
00:28:20.199 --> 00:28:21.040
they may come.

568
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.670
When the reality has to express itself,

569
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.949
it will destroy all such people.

570
00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:28.630
It will have to destroy

571
00:28:28.959 --> 00:28:30.310
because it has to come.

572
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.550
You have to be tuned in such a manner that you receive that love,

573
00:28:35.119 --> 00:28:36.189
but the same love.

574
00:28:38.089 --> 00:28:39.459
When you do not accept

575
00:28:40.079 --> 00:28:41.180
You'll be thrown

576
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.109
out of evolutionary process.

577
00:28:45.449 --> 00:28:47.040
The time is very short,

578
00:28:47.319 --> 00:28:47.930
believe me,

579
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.119
the time is very short.

580
00:28:51.359 --> 00:28:52.770
Within 2 years' time,

581
00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.469
I have to tell you,

582
00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.339
things are going to be decided.

583
00:28:59.459 --> 00:29:00.930
While people are already

584
00:29:02.209 --> 00:29:02.780
Love

585
00:29:04.369 --> 00:29:05.489
Thanks to these

586
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.609
thugs and these cheats who want to make money.

587
00:29:11.109 --> 00:29:15.030
Shamelessly living on other people's money luxuriously.

588
00:29:16.449 --> 00:29:17.310
Selling their

589
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.359
Artificial

590
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:21.760
enticement.

591
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.810
At least

592
00:29:26.979 --> 00:29:27.939
If you

593
00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.750
Very few of them.

594
00:29:32.099 --> 00:29:36.680
To take upon themselves that we are going to receive the reality.

595
00:29:36.849 --> 00:29:40.410
We are asking for the reality you can save the humanity even today.

596
00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:42.310
Sahayoga

597
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.660
If you say it is my discovery,

598
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.430
I would say it is not.

599
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.170
It is the discovery of this age,

600
00:29:51.589 --> 00:29:53.099
the discovery of the secret,

601
00:29:53.739 --> 00:29:55.689
those who have been hankering for it,

602
00:29:55.979 --> 00:29:57.739
those who have been asking for it.

603
00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:58.579
So God says,

604
00:29:58.699 --> 00:29:58.900
all right,

605
00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.739
have it now.

606
00:30:02.099 --> 00:30:03.640
But when it comes to have it,

607
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.859
they don't want to have it.

608
00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:08.829
Like Tulsi Dasa wrote all his Tulsi rama,

609
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.660
and when Sri Rama himself appeared before him,

610
00:30:12.829 --> 00:30:14.339
he put a tiak on his head,

611
00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.270
and still he could not recognise who was Tilda.

612
00:30:22.729 --> 00:30:27.229
You must understand that God cannot allow his creation to be destroyed.

613
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.510
He must have made some provision within you.

614
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.489
He must have made some sort of arrangement within you.

615
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.170
To enlighten you at a point when there will be completed.

616
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:44.069
This is a time

617
00:30:44.239 --> 00:30:45.699
of complete dumbness.

618
00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.280
At this time the night has to come.

619
00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:51.689
How it happens,

620
00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:52.939
how it works out.

621
00:30:54.969 --> 00:30:56.680
There is an engineering behind it,

622
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:58.239
no doubt there is.

623
00:30:59.619 --> 00:31:01.459
What God has planned into you,

624
00:31:01.709 --> 00:31:03.380
how a human being is made,

625
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.099
and what has brought out.

626
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.790
All these happenings in the Soho yoga.

627
00:31:13.219 --> 00:31:15.089
I will be discussing tomorrow.

628
00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.800
Explaining to you,

629
00:31:17.839 --> 00:31:20.119
I have done it many times about Kundalini.

630
00:31:21.199 --> 00:31:23.810
But I'll also give you the side effects of Kundalini,

631
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:25.800
the way people have misused

632
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:26.560
the name,

633
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:27.949
the word kundalini,

634
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.849
that is your mother.

635
00:31:29.859 --> 00:31:31.410
That I will tell you tomorrow.

636
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.800
It is no use wasting time in talking.

637
00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:38.689
As you all are here,

638
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.170
I think it is better

639
00:31:40.369 --> 00:31:41.410
that for a short time,

640
00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.050
if you could go into meditation,

641
00:31:43.219 --> 00:31:45.099
let us see if it works out with some options.

642
00:31:45.939 --> 00:31:48.760
And tomorrow at 10 o'clock we are having the meditation.

643
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.550
Do come for that.

644
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:52.890
You will not come for meditation today,

645
00:31:52.989 --> 00:31:55.640
but after 6 months when I come back from London,

646
00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:56.760
then there will be

647
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.449
a row of people procuring them.

648
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.010
It's something surprising the way we are.

649
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.739
There are so many people who might tell that why

650
00:32:07.739 --> 00:32:11.079
don't you come for surgery or why don't you get it

651
00:32:11.079 --> 00:32:14.010
instead of getting cancer later on and waiting in my

652
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:17.000
house for hours together to get a darshan of matai.

653
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:22.520
What has happened to our brains?

654
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.400
If I say that I give you something that is eternal.

655
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:31.739
Which will give you a complete cure and accurity power yourself

656
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:37.109
not only but you can raise the kundalini of others and give realisation to others.

657
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.060
It is such a fantastic thing in a bundle I want to give you,

658
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.469
but you want to come to my house.

659
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:46.609
For treatment.

660
00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:48.609
I told them,

661
00:32:48.719 --> 00:32:50.319
Why don't you come to my programme?

662
00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:50.810
They said,

663
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.969
No,

664
00:32:51.089 --> 00:32:51.290
Mother,

665
00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:52.680
we want to get cured.

666
00:32:53.359 --> 00:32:55.430
There are so many wrestlers who come to me,

667
00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:55.790
Mother,

668
00:32:55.829 --> 00:32:56.390
give us peace.

669
00:32:56.469 --> 00:32:58.060
Why don't you come to our programme?

670
00:32:58.229 --> 00:32:58.310
No,

671
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.630
Mother,

672
00:32:58.670 --> 00:32:59.550
you give us peace.

673
00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:02.349
We command

674
00:33:03.479 --> 00:33:04.589
The command gone.

675
00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:06.750
You give us this,

676
00:33:06.829 --> 00:33:07.810
you do this for us,

677
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:08.939
do that for us.

678
00:33:10.349 --> 00:33:11.920
What is your right to do that?

679
00:33:13.369 --> 00:33:15.400
How do you command God all the time

680
00:33:15.609 --> 00:33:16.890
that you must do this for me,

681
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.170
you must do that?

682
00:33:18.369 --> 00:33:19.770
Are you connected with Him?

683
00:33:20.859 --> 00:33:22.979
Have you entered into his citizenship?

684
00:33:22.989 --> 00:33:23.770
You have not.

685
00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:26.520
You have no rights on him,

686
00:33:26.699 --> 00:33:30.000
but when you start calling his name Rama Rama Rama Rama,

687
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:32.380
who appears before you is Ramadi.

688
00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:34.209
He's a servant.

689
00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.489
God does not want

690
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:37.920
the homages of clay.

691
00:33:39.209 --> 00:33:41.290
Unless and until you are liberated,

692
00:33:41.439 --> 00:33:42.910
you have no right on God,

693
00:33:43.199 --> 00:33:44.829
but once you are liberated,

694
00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.839
she comes.

695
00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.099
He

696
00:33:49.099 --> 00:33:50.390
He looks after.

697
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.229
He does everything

698
00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.859
whether he does it or not,

699
00:33:53.959 --> 00:33:54.989
you should come

700
00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:57.119
and receive it and see for yourself.

701
00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:00.930
We see a temple here.

702
00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:01.430
We'll say,

703
00:34:01.459 --> 00:34:02.050
all right,

704
00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:03.060
very good.

705
00:34:03.099 --> 00:34:04.449
We must say Namaskar.

706
00:34:04.619 --> 00:34:05.810
If you go to a church,

707
00:34:05.939 --> 00:34:06.849
we nicely sing us,

708
00:34:06.979 --> 00:34:07.099
Hey,

709
00:34:07.219 --> 00:34:07.290
oh,

710
00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.330
we've been to church on a Sunday.

711
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:10.649
Finished.

712
00:34:12.428 --> 00:34:14.329
And then when there is a problem,

713
00:34:14.458 --> 00:34:14.938
oh God,

714
00:34:14.978 --> 00:34:16.069
please save my mother,

715
00:34:16.299 --> 00:34:17.018
she's very sick.

716
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:17.658
Oh God,

717
00:34:17.697 --> 00:34:19.368
give job to my husband.

718
00:34:19.498 --> 00:34:20.217
Oh God,

719
00:34:20.319 --> 00:34:21.498
look after my children.

720
00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:23.010
Why?

721
00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:24.938
Because you have just said Namaskar leave.

722
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.770
But you don't have to do anything.

723
00:34:28.899 --> 00:34:30.250
Only thing from your heart,

724
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:30.820
you have to say,

725
00:34:30.899 --> 00:34:31.629
oh Lord,

726
00:34:31.899 --> 00:34:32.899
shining to me.

727
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:34.870
Give me light,

728
00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.840
enlighten me.

729
00:34:35.918 --> 00:34:36.489
That's all.

730
00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.870
You don't have to say anything.

731
00:34:37.879 --> 00:34:39.438
It just works like that.

732
00:34:40.408 --> 00:34:41.938
But are we that genuine?

733
00:34:42.279 --> 00:34:43.918
Is our attention that free?

734
00:34:43.998 --> 00:34:46.388
Our attention is lost into so many things.

735
00:34:46.799 --> 00:34:48.408
This attention is created,

736
00:34:48.697 --> 00:34:53.559
human attention is specially created only to enter into that divine ocean.

737
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:57.350
While our attention is lost into such things.

738
00:34:58.729 --> 00:35:00.909
That are absolutely useless.

739
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.169
And temporary

740
00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:06.969
Which we are not seeking really.

741
00:35:07.879 --> 00:35:09.159
It's a camouflage.

742
00:35:09.929 --> 00:35:13.429
We think we are seeking in that we are not.

743
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.540
If you are seeking joy and.

744
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.439
Then ask for it.

745
00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:25.560
You have to just ask for it and you'll have.

746
00:35:25.929 --> 00:35:26.979
The time has come.

747
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:28.780
The blossom time has.

748
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.929
That's why it is going to work out.

749
00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.530
Of course,

750
00:35:32.699 --> 00:35:35.169
it cannot be a plastic production,

751
00:35:35.419 --> 00:35:37.270
but it is going to be a mask.

752
00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.820
Many people are going to get realisation and have got it,

753
00:35:40.899 --> 00:35:41.330
you know,

754
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:43.770
in Bombay there are many people who have got it,

755
00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:44.669
but

756
00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:50.120
There are very few who have reached a height and they have kept there,

757
00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:50.750
but

758
00:35:51.489 --> 00:35:52.669
So many of them,

759
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:54.610
they rise and come down.

760
00:35:54.739 --> 00:35:56.250
They rise and come down.

761
00:35:56.419 --> 00:35:57.909
They do not settle.

762
00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.360
You have to steady your boats when you get into it.

763
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.179
That is also can be done through Sahadio.

764
00:36:05.909 --> 00:36:07.129
So many of you

765
00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.620
have now done it.

766
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.669
You have to do it.

767
00:36:13.239 --> 00:36:16.939
That is the time you have to do it after realisation.

768
00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:18.830
Before realisation,

769
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.719
no religion has any meaning for you.

770
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.600
No religious ritual or anything whatsoever,

771
00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:27.929
the prayers or anything has any.

772
00:36:29.149 --> 00:36:30.179
Help for you.

773
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:30.860
Actually,

774
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.780
very few of those high spirited people,

775
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.419
I should say the great people

776
00:36:35.909 --> 00:36:36.469
who were born,

777
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:39.479
the evolved people did not know that you are not even a great.

778
00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:44.969
They did not know this point because when I read their books,

779
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.600
I feel.

780
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.699
That just like small children,

781
00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.629
they have said

782
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:54.050
that you hold the force in your vital force in your heart and raise it.

783
00:36:54.219 --> 00:36:55.169
How can you raise it?

784
00:36:55.179 --> 00:36:57.340
There is no vital force already awaken.

785
00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.719
You are not even awaken people.

786
00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:01.770
How can you?

787
00:37:03.939 --> 00:37:05.250
There is only

788
00:37:06.659 --> 00:37:08.070
a inkling of heart.

789
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:10.840
Toward which you are running.

790
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.360
But you are not even awaken people.

791
00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:17.560
How can you do the things that they have to?

792
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.919
It's so artificial.

793
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:23.739
When you will know through Sajo,

794
00:37:23.989 --> 00:37:26.280
you will really feel like laughing at those.

795
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.459
So let us have

796
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.879
The experiment of sojo which I have told you is the simplest thing

797
00:37:35.209 --> 00:37:37.169
and you don't have to do anything.

798
00:37:37.979 --> 00:37:42.909
It's like one light which is enlightened has to enlighten another light.

799
00:37:43.169 --> 00:37:46.719
The light which is not yet enlightened cannot do anything about it,

800
00:37:46.929 --> 00:37:48.330
but once it is enlightened,

801
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:49.729
it has to give light to others.

802
00:37:52.629 --> 00:37:55.820
There are many yogis and also there are new people.

803
00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.739
I can see them.

804
00:37:57.939 --> 00:38:01.770
Let us work it out and tomorrow also do come for meditation.

805
00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:02.979
After meditation,

806
00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:04.929
I will also have a curative,

807
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.820
which I have not announced in the paper because I

808
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.100
know there will be thousands of them coming here.

809
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:13.830
Let me first make some good doctors.

810
00:38:15.129 --> 00:38:17.399
And we have made some very good doctors.

811
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.860
Nobody is barred.

812
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.070
Everybody.

813
00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.060
I invited with great love

814
00:38:25.489 --> 00:38:26.639
and with great honour.

815
00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:27.909
Do come,

816
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.800
it is your mother's own cooking.

817
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.320
It's your own mother's.

818
00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:36.080
Giving,

819
00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.209
which does not mean giving actually by giving you

820
00:38:39.209 --> 00:38:41.919
only I feel relieved it is like that.

821
00:38:42.489 --> 00:38:43.239
So it's

822
00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:44.729
more you're doing.

823
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.060
An obligation towards me then I'm

824
00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:50.080
Doing anything to you.

825
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.429
Because I cannot receive anything.

826
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.949
I can only give.

827
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.159
That's my problem.

828
00:38:57.489 --> 00:39:01.000
I would request you to put your hands towards me this way.

829
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:08.560
The grand
