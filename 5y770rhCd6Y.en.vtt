WEBVTT

00:00.611 --> 00:04.631
Yesterday, I told you about

00:07.731 --> 00:15.131
the way these all incarnations of the Guru principle

00:16.291 --> 00:19.711
came on this earth,

00:20.175 --> 00:24.695
and how they tried to establish dharma,

00:25.235 --> 00:29.295
this valence among human beings.

00:30.455 --> 00:43.155
As you know that in the nature, whatever elements we have got,

00:44.395 --> 00:50.235
all these elements have got eight valences

00:51.735 --> 00:55.935
in which, some maximum is eight.

00:57.015 --> 01:04.135
So, it could be two, three, four,

01:05.015 --> 01:12.455
could be five, six, seven, eight.

01:14.175 --> 01:20.555
So, whichever is -say there are three valences, or two.

01:22.815 --> 01:31.215
Then the two valences because they are less, they’ll combine with others.

01:31.595 --> 01:38.395
If they are more than four - supposing they are five,

01:38.395 --> 01:40.375
so they have three places.

01:40.775 --> 01:46.015
So, they’ll attract others which are the three, it’s like this.

01:46.015 --> 01:55.055
And this goes on in such a way that the atoms

01:55.115 --> 02:00.455
are not aware of it. They don’t know about it.

02:00.635 --> 02:03.695
Automatically it’s happening.

02:04.015 --> 02:09.515
Like carbon has four valences, so it can take four or give four.

02:11.315 --> 02:17.175
That’s how the life started, with the carbon

02:17.175 --> 02:28.575
because it had more possibility of attracting elements to itself.

02:33.495 --> 02:48.355
But all the things that are dead are not aware of the Divinity, about dharma.

02:48.675 --> 02:55.675
Their dharmas are built-in. So, if you take, say oxygen, it will behave like oxygen.

02:55.915 --> 02:59.915
If you take hydrogen, it will behave like hydrogen.

03:00.335 --> 03:07.395
They don’t change because they are not aware.
They do not have awareness.

03:08.535 --> 03:14.495
Then comes the animal stage where they have nine valences.

03:15.555 --> 03:26.555
These also, their dharmas are determined by Sadhashiva.

03:26.995 --> 03:32.755
That’s why He’s called as Pashupati. It means the Lord of all the animals.

03:33.955 --> 03:38.135
So, a serpent will be a serpent.  A tiger will be a tiger.

03:39.315 --> 03:44.195
It cannot be that a tiger can behave like a serpent, the serpent can behave like a tiger,

03:44.375 --> 03:49.115
or a wolf can behave like a bird.

03:49.535 --> 03:53.915
They all have built-in, within themselves, their dharmas.

03:55.195 --> 04:03.895
Of course, they know that they can fly, they can see, they can smell, they can make out,

04:03.895 --> 04:08.115
they have got magnet within themselves, they have directions.

04:08.575 --> 04:13.355
Because how can the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia

04:13.355 --> 04:17.875
if they didn’t have a sense of some direction?

04:18.735 --> 04:23.275
They have magnet within them and they know how to act according to the magnet.

04:23.395 --> 04:29.355
They have a sense, another sense which you can call, which we don’t have.

04:30.355 --> 04:33.215
Say, there are birds in Japan, when there’s

04:33.215 --> 04:39.935
And if these birds all disappear going to be an earthquake, they can hear, it. They know.

04:40.175 --> 04:48.115
And if these birds all disappear then you know that this earthquake is going on.

04:48.115 --> 04:52.195
Or else there are some birds, another kind,

04:52.195 --> 04:57.895
like, you know the Noah’s ark, he said, "They go outside" and ultimately,

04:57.895 --> 05:02.815
he found out that there is-

05:03.955 --> 05:07.535
water has receded and the leaves have come.

05:08.055 --> 05:21.735
Because he brought one leaf of [Shri Mataji’s looking for the name in English]

05:21.735 --> 05:27.835
So, this is how, you see, but this can only be
done by dove,

05:27.835 --> 05:34.895
any other, supposing you use a crow, they won’t do it. So, all their dharmas are built in themselves.

05:36.275 --> 05:42.835
And they are bound by those dharmas.

05:44.975 --> 05:47.455
They have to be that.

05:48.095 --> 05:51.715
Then human beings were given the freedom.

05:51.715 --> 05:55.975
So, we are not bound by any dharma.

05:56.535 --> 06:02.855
We can be cruel like Hitler or we could be like Christ

06:03.875 --> 06:08.895
or we could be like any animal.

06:08.895 --> 06:16.135
So, but our natural source is the animal nature,

06:16.135 --> 06:22.655
that we had first of all, is to obey our dharma, it’s natural.

06:23.735 --> 06:27.135
Whatever within us is the dharma instilled,

06:27.455 --> 06:30.955
those ten dharmas we obey.

06:30.955 --> 06:35.415
Basically, we know that this is wrong, basically.

06:36.535 --> 06:41.435
Even small children know what is wrong and what is good.

06:42.195 --> 06:44.515
Then we have freedom.

06:44.515 --> 06:52.855
Then we start taking to adharma, start crossing our limits, going away

06:52.855 --> 06:57.515
from what we think right is and reach such a state

06:57.515 --> 07:02.675
where we start thinking that whatever we are doing is the right thing.

07:07.515 --> 07:12.075
That’s why these Gurus came and brought you your dharma.

07:12.775 --> 07:19.275
So, the dharma gives you the balance and gives you the height.

07:19.695 --> 07:26.555
Supposing you have some wheat and you spread it, it spreads all over, there’s no height.

07:26.555 --> 07:30.235
But you put it in a [inaudible] then it gets
heights.

07:30.235 --> 07:36.335
In the same way, when you have dharma, you get the depth of your dharma

07:36.875 --> 07:41.135
you become a deeper personality.

07:41.655 --> 07:51.055
And from this dharma, once you become dharmic, then only you start seeing that there’s something beyond you.

07:52.735 --> 07:58.335
But if you are adharmic, then you think, "This is best for me,

07:58.335 --> 08:03.915
good, nice lifestyle, why give up this?" And you go on

08:06.295 --> 08:16.715
gradually disappearing from human value system to sub-human value system.

08:16.715 --> 08:26.675
It can be animal system, it can be devil system, it can be "bhootish" system, can be any system, there’s no end to it.

08:28.055 --> 08:35.455
So, there are many dharmas built-in within us which are ten basically, ten dharmas.

08:35.575 --> 08:41.715
And these ten dharmas are like Ten Commandments in the West.

08:42.275 --> 08:45.355
They are taught to us as commandments.

08:45.355 --> 08:50.835
But actually, they are for our benevolence by which we develop our dharma.

08:52.275 --> 09:03.435
But once you develop your dharma in the centre then your dharma expands to everything:

09:04.395 --> 09:12.615
the money, the power, your family, to your society, to your country, to the whole world.

09:12.615 --> 09:18.495
You start thinking, "It’s my dharma." "What
is my dharma now, what should I do?"

09:19.455 --> 09:27.735
"Towards my children, towards my family, towards my village, towards my nation, towards this whole word,

09:27.735 --> 09:32.455
what is my dharma?"

09:32.455 --> 09:37.155
Then when this dharma starts extending, on the horizontal way,

09:41.175 --> 09:44.995
then you start looking at others,

09:44.995 --> 09:50.335
trying to find out what is their
problem is? It is my dharma to help this person,

09:51.335 --> 09:54.435
it is my dharma to do this way, that way.

09:54.435 --> 09:59.815
Then you extend your family more and more and more, you become very generous,

09:59.815 --> 10:05.335
you become very righteous, you become very kind, you become very mild,

10:05.335 --> 10:07.915
all those things happen.

10:07.915 --> 10:12.435
But despite that, you are not yet a Realized soul.

10:14.135 --> 10:20.455
So, sometimes when you are nice and you find there’s reaction outside,

10:20.735 --> 10:23.395
because you are nice people try to trouble you,

10:23.395 --> 10:27.395
then you think that it’s not sufficient to be nice.

10:27.695 --> 10:31.255
It’s not enough,  you have to rise higher.

10:31.755 --> 10:36.735
And that’s how a Mahalakshmi principle is born within you of seeking.

10:37.315 --> 10:44.595
And modern times are the main things where so many people have got this principle within themselves,

10:44.595 --> 10:48.915
whether they are conscious of it or not, but they are.

10:50.735 --> 10:53.175
You never had so many seekers.

10:53.175 --> 10:58.575
It’s a category, a special category of people you are, that you are all seekers

10:58.575 --> 11:02.135
and that you’ve been seeking the Truth and that’s how you are seekers.

11:05.315 --> 11:09.915
And once you’re seeking the Truth, then you try to understand

11:10.235 --> 11:13.255
that you have to seek something higher.

11:13.255 --> 11:17.875
But if you are not already dharmic, then while seeking there are problems,

11:17.875 --> 11:21.935
conflicts. Your mind also can fight with you,

11:21.935 --> 11:24.035
your liver can fight with you,

11:24.035 --> 11:27.595
anything can fight with you in your body.

11:27.595 --> 11:33.375
Supposing you have spoiled your liver, then it will fight with you when you are rising.

11:33.375 --> 11:36.415
If there’s something wrong with you,

11:36.415 --> 11:39.455
say, your father’s side, mother’s side anything,

11:39.455 --> 11:41.455
it will fight you.

11:41.455 --> 11:45.235
But still, if the urge is deep

11:45.235 --> 11:48.355
and intense, you can rise.

11:48.355 --> 11:51.075
Everybody has to rise.

11:51.075 --> 11:56.155
Whether you are a king or a queen or a servant or anything,

11:56.155 --> 11:59.995
everybody has to rise and everybody can rise.

11:59.995 --> 12:04.055
But everybody will not, this is the problem.

12:04.055 --> 12:08.295
Everybody will not rise; this is a big problem you have.

12:08.295 --> 12:13.055
And that’s why we shouldn’t worry about those who do not want to rise.

12:13.355 --> 12:18.615
We should worry only about people who want to rise and who want to ascent.

12:18.755 --> 12:26.375
So today, I’ve already told you about the
incarnation of the Goddess at the heart level.

12:26.375 --> 12:29.655
And this is what Navaratri is,

12:29.655 --> 12:34.355
where at the heart level She came and saved people

12:34.355 --> 12:40.415
from getting destroyed by the evil forces.

12:41.135 --> 12:44.635
But they were already dharmic, they were already bhaktas,

12:44.635 --> 12:50.175
they were already seeking of God of their "moksha ", their "kalyan ".

12:51.575 --> 12:55.915
They were not to be told all these things, they were already there.

12:56.375 --> 12:59.175
So, She just saved them at that time

12:59.175 --> 13:03.455
and She came, again and again, to do that nine times,

13:03.995 --> 13:07.675
and her ncarnations are regarded as the highest value.

13:08.415 --> 13:13.255
But then it didn’t work out, because you save those people for what?

13:13.255 --> 13:16.695
They are still only on the dharma level.

13:16.695 --> 13:19.395
How will they go beyond this?

13:19.395 --> 13:22.815
How dharma will become just part and parcel of them?

13:22.815 --> 13:27.255
It should be Sahaj within them that they should be dharmic,

13:27.255 --> 13:32.375
as you are.  I don’t have to tell you don’t drink, don’t- you just don’t do it.

13:33.275 --> 13:39.175
So, this problem is: how to become dharmic without putting any effort.

13:39.175 --> 13:44.575
Like, morning take hundred and eight names, then you do this, and the whole day you work out,

13:44.575 --> 13:46.835
you go to the Himalayas,

13:46.835 --> 13:50.975
and get there in that cold; also here, you have a little bit of that here!

13:53.615 --> 13:56.375
You should get little immunity.

13:56.375 --> 14:00.355
Ah! This is nothing compared to what is Himalayas, but still,

14:01.055 --> 14:07.035
a little bit of its limbs.

14:08.635 --> 14:14.555
then all these things people seek, they worked very hard for it within themselves.

14:15.815 --> 14:20.195
But Goddess didn’t tell them that you have to ascend.

14:20.195 --> 14:22.195
She just killed all the devils

14:24.715 --> 14:27.635
and She killed all the evil forces.

14:28.275 --> 14:31.075
And that’s what nine energies have incarnated,

14:31.095 --> 14:33.535
it was very important.

14:33.535 --> 14:39.515
So, Navaratri is to pray to Her,

14:39.515 --> 14:45.435
to pay your tribute that She saved you from evil

14:46.835 --> 14:50.915
and She gave you a sense of security within you.

14:51.255 --> 14:54.715
So, at the heart level, centre heart,

14:54.715 --> 14:58.035
there’s a sense of security.

14:58.935 --> 15:04.715
When this sense of security is disturbed, then you catch on your centre heart.

15:05.195 --> 15:11.355
And at the centre heart only, in your childhood, up to twelve years,

15:11.835 --> 15:13.835
on this sternum bone,

15:13.835 --> 15:18.355
you develop what you call the antibodies  which are the Ganas.

15:18.855 --> 15:23.415
These are the Ganas of the Goddess

15:23.415 --> 15:31.835
and the king of those Ganas is Ganapati, is Ganesha.

15:33.075 --> 15:41.015
So, whenever you see something that you get a fright,  the sternum starts pulsating in your childhood.

15:42.315 --> 15:48.395
But when you are grown up, it sends like a remote control the message to all those Ganas

15:48.395 --> 15:55.935
which go out of the sternum bone in the whole body

15:56.515 --> 15:59.395
and receive messages

15:59.395 --> 16:04.615
and then they prepare themselves to fight attacks. Attacks of negativity.

16:04.615 --> 16:10.135
Say, there’s cancer which is coming out,
that is the kind of a violence they fight.

16:10.135 --> 16:13.135
They try to fight all kinds of things.

16:13.655 --> 16:17.255
All the negativity they try to fight.

16:17.255 --> 16:23.855
They have to fight the negativity of the left
side, not the right side.

16:25.715 --> 16:32.155
The right-side negativity, I think you have
to fight yourself.

16:33.115 --> 16:36.995
Also, people like Hanumana

16:36.995 --> 16:38.995
and other angels,

16:38.995 --> 16:44.275
they try to show how stupid you are to be egoistical.

16:44.695 --> 16:49.435
Every time you try to have some ego,  they show you.

16:50.375 --> 16:53.355
And then they control your ego, they try to show

16:53.475 --> 16:58.215
how you have fallen into the ditch of ego.

16:58.635 --> 17:03.355
But when it happens to you, then you start
seeing your ego,

17:04.135 --> 17:06.775
then you become guilty.

17:06.855 --> 17:08.035
But that’s not the way.

17:08.035 --> 17:15.255
If you see your ego then you have to separate yourself from that ego.

17:15.355 --> 17:17.435
You say, "Oh, so I’m beating
you all right,

17:17.435 --> 17:19.435
I’ll put you right now."

17:19.435 --> 17:21.435
"What do you think of yourself?"

17:21.715 --> 17:25.915
Put the ego down with your ego.

17:28.655 --> 17:30.675
"What do you think of yourself?"

17:30.835 --> 17:33.855
"You’re Mr. So and so, you behave like this? All right,

17:33.855 --> 17:36.595
I’ll beat you with shoes."

17:37.735 --> 17:42.775
But one should never play into the hands of ego, it’s very dangerous.

17:43.435 --> 17:48.875
But sometimes, I’ve seen people who are
possessed also can become very egoistical

17:48.875 --> 17:53.295
because these "bhoots" make you [inaudible].

17:55.055 --> 17:58.855
And then it’s very dangerous, you never feel you’re doing anything wrong.

17:59.595 --> 18:02.395
Just start doing wrong, you start aggressing others,

18:02.395 --> 18:05.255
you never know what you’re aggressing others.

18:05.255 --> 18:08.295
But if you oppose also these "bhoots" they’ll trouble your body;

18:08.295 --> 18:10.475
they’ll give you pain.

18:10.475 --> 18:13.275
But if you accept, they’ll trouble others.

18:13.275 --> 18:16.755
The person who has ego never feels the pain himself.

18:16.895 --> 18:20.235
But others feel it and they know it’s a very difficult person.

18:20.235 --> 18:22.515
But he feels, “I’ don't do anything wrong.

18:22.515 --> 18:24.515
How can people say I’m difficult” [Unsure]

18:25.475 --> 18:29.955
So, this is how it’s working out within
us

18:29.955 --> 18:34.575
that we can see our ego because now we have become the Spirit.

18:35.315 --> 18:41.275
So, whatever we see is like a window. Now we can see through the window what is outside.

18:41.675 --> 18:46.715
And we can really expel our ego and our conditionings

18:46.715 --> 18:49.255
very nicely if we try to do it.

18:51.755 --> 18:58.795
So, at this stage, the Mahalakshmi principle started

18:59.135 --> 19:05.115
and the first incarnation of the Mahalakshmi, as you may know, has come as Sita,

19:06.115 --> 19:08.115
because of Maryada Purushotama.

19:08.115 --> 19:11.455
He was the one who was full of Maryadas.

19:11.455 --> 19:18.275
His wife, She came as the first incarnation of Mahalakshmi on this earth.

19:19.215 --> 19:24.695
Now, we have today a film on Ramayana, if you want, if you are not been very sleepy, we can see,

19:25.275 --> 19:28.835
and you can see how She behaved.

19:31.535 --> 19:34.975
You have some problem of the right heart, I think.

19:35.955 --> 19:37.955
Yes. What do you mean?

19:39.335 --> 19:41.335
How is your father?

19:41.335 --> 19:42.775
My father?

19:42.775 --> 19:44.775
All right?

19:44.775 --> 19:47.635
He cannot see out with one eye.

19:47.635 --> 19:50.575
He cannot see from one eye, Shri Mataji.

19:50.575 --> 19:51.675
He can’t see.

19:51.675 --> 19:52.795
From one eye, he’s blocked.

19:52.795 --> 19:53.755
Which eye?

19:53.755 --> 19:56.935
The right eye.

19:56.935 --> 19:58.775
Right eye, he can’t see.

19:58.775 --> 20:01.295
He has drunk a lot.

20:02.095 --> 20:04.095
Right eye, he can’t see at all.

20:04.095 --> 20:08.775
Since two weeks, he cannot see with his right eye.

20:09.535 --> 20:16.255
It happened suddenly after sleep and he couldn’t see out of his eye.

20:17.335 --> 20:19.335
Where is he?

20:19.335 --> 20:21.335
At home.

20:29.195 --> 20:32.035
He has been to some guru or somebody?

20:32.255 --> 20:34.255
No, but he has drunk a lot.

20:35.235 --> 20:39.075
Drinking Shri Mataji. He was drinking much alcohol.

20:41.175 --> 20:43.175
Drinking.

20:44.075 --> 20:46.655
But I have been to a guru.

20:46.755 --> 20:48.055
You have been.

20:48.055 --> 20:48.695
Yes.

20:48.855 --> 20:50.855
Which one?

20:50.855 --> 20:54.795
I have done rebirthing and I
have been to “Sai Baba”.

20:54.795 --> 20:55.515
Hu?

20:55.515 --> 20:57.215
“Sai Baba”.

20:57.215 --> 21:00.275
This Shirdi Sai Nath?

21:00.275 --> 21:02.535
Fake Sai Baba.

21:02.535 --> 21:03.955
It’s another fellow?

21:04.135 --> 21:04.815
Yes

21:12.555 --> 21:16.795
He was one of the devils killed by the Goddess. And he was Mahishasura.

21:17.495 --> 21:22.795
The whole song, Mahishasura Mardini, is on that.”

21:27.115 --> 21:31.315
But your father must be having diabetes, I’m sure.

21:31.995 --> 21:33.995
Did he have diabetes?

21:36.835 --> 21:39.575
My girl-friend has diabetes.

21:39.575 --> 21:40.775
Who has?

21:40.775 --> 21:42.075
My girl-friend.

21:42.075 --> 21:42.735
She has.

21:42.735 --> 21:43.635
Yes.

21:44.555 --> 21:46.935
He doesn’t have. Your father doesn't have.

21:49.435 --> 21:52.775
It’s possible but as far as I know, not.

21:54.175 --> 22:00.975
Must have started also. Drinking too much, you see, spoils your liver completely

22:00.975 --> 22:05.935
and also can go to the Agnya, Swadisthana.

22:08.995 --> 22:11.755
[The old black and white Ramayana video starts]

22:11.755 --> 22:14.355
Now, you all can turn round.

22:16.855 --> 22:20.135
I don’t know which sort of a- this thing.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.775
Rama is going to the jungle.

22:27.955 --> 22:33.835
As you are around here. What is this? This you can take it out of here.

22:37.715 --> 22:39.715
You can just [inaudible].

22:43.815 --> 22:47.315
Very, very, very old pictures.

22:47.315 --> 22:51.115
Very old one. You must have seen this one.

23:08.215 --> 23:10.215
Very old.

23:29.335 --> 23:33.235
You see, you have to be the other way round, I think.

23:33.235 --> 23:35.235
See what you have to pray.

23:35.235 --> 23:37.235
[Hindi]
