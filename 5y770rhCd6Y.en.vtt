00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:04.631
Yesterday, I told you about

00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:15.131
the way these all incarnations of the Guru principle

00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.711
came on this earth,

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:24.695
and how they tried to establish dharma,

00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:29.295
this valence among human beings.

00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:43.155
As you know that in the nature, whatever elements we have got,

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:50.235
all these elements have got eight valences

00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:55.935
in which, some maximum is eight.

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:04.135
So, it could be two, three, four,

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:12.455
could be five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:20.555
So, whichever is -say there are three valences, or two.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:31.215
Then the two valences because they are less, they’ll combine with others.

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:38.395
If they are more than four - supposing they are five,

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:40.375
so they have three places.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:46.015
So, they’ll attract others which are the three, it’s like this.

00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:55.055
And this goes on in such a way that the atoms

00:01:55.115 --> 00:02:00.455
are not aware of it. They don’t know about it.

00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:03.695
Automatically it’s happening.

00:02:04.015 --> 00:02:09.515
Like carbon has four valences, so it can take four or give four.

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:17.175
That’s how the life started, with the carbon

00:02:17.175 --> 00:02:28.575
because it had more possibility of attracting elements to itself.

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:48.355
But all the things that are dead are not aware of the Divinity, about dharma.

00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:55.675
Their dharmas are built-in. So, if you take, say oxygen, it will behave like oxygen.

00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:59.915
If you take hydrogen, it will behave like hydrogen.

00:03:00.335 --> 00:03:07.395
They don’t change because they are not aware.
They do not have awareness.

00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:14.495
Then comes the animal stage where they have nine valences.

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:26.555
These also, their dharmas are determined by Sadhashiva.

00:03:26.995 --> 00:03:32.755
That’s why He’s called as Pashupati. It means the Lord of all the animals.

00:03:33.955 --> 00:03:38.135
So, a serpent will be a serpent.  A tiger will be a tiger.

00:03:39.315 --> 00:03:44.195
It cannot be that a tiger can behave like a serpent, the serpent can behave like a tiger,

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:49.115
or a wolf can behave like a bird.

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:53.915
They all have built-in, within themselves, their dharmas.

00:03:55.195 --> 00:04:03.895
Of course, they know that they can fly, they can see, they can smell, they can make out,

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:08.115
they have got magnet within themselves, they have directions.

00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:13.355
Because how can the birds fly all the way from Siberia to Australia

00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:17.875
if they didn’t have a sense of some direction?

00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:23.275
They have magnet within them and they know how to act according to the magnet.

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:29.355
They have a sense, another sense which you can call, which we don’t have.

00:04:30.355 --> 00:04:33.215
Say, there are birds in Japan, when there’s

00:04:33.215 --> 00:04:39.935
And if these birds all disappear going to be an earthquake, they can hear, it. They know.

00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:48.115
And if these birds all disappear then you know that this earthquake is going on.

00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:52.195
Or else there are some birds, another kind,

00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:57.895
like, you know the Noah’s ark, he said, "They go outside" and ultimately,

00:04:57.895 --> 00:05:02.815
he found out that there is-

00:05:03.955 --> 00:05:07.535
water has receded and the leaves have come.

00:05:08.055 --> 00:05:21.735
Because he brought one leaf of [Shri Mataji’s looking for the name in English]

00:05:21.735 --> 00:05:27.835
So, this is how, you see, but this can only be
done by dove,

00:05:27.835 --> 00:05:34.895
any other, supposing you use a crow, they won’t do it. So, all their dharmas are built in themselves.

00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:42.835
And they are bound by those dharmas.

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:47.455
They have to be that.

00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:51.715
Then human beings were given the freedom.

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:55.975
So, we are not bound by any dharma.

00:05:56.535 --> 00:06:02.855
We can be cruel like Hitler or we could be like Christ

00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:08.895
or we could be like any animal.

00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:16.135
So, but our natural source is the animal nature,

00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:22.655
that we had first of all, is to obey our dharma, it’s natural.

00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:27.135
Whatever within us is the dharma instilled,

00:06:27.455 --> 00:06:30.955
those ten dharmas we obey.

00:06:30.955 --> 00:06:35.415
Basically, we know that this is wrong, basically.

00:06:36.535 --> 00:06:41.435
Even small children know what is wrong and what is good.

00:06:42.195 --> 00:06:44.515
Then we have freedom.

00:06:44.515 --> 00:06:52.855
Then we start taking to adharma, start crossing our limits, going away

00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:57.515
from what we think right is and reach such a state

00:06:57.515 --> 00:07:02.675
where we start thinking that whatever we are doing is the right thing.

00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:12.075
That’s why these Gurus came and brought you your dharma.

00:07:12.775 --> 00:07:19.275
So, the dharma gives you the balance and gives you the height.

00:07:19.695 --> 00:07:26.555
Supposing you have some wheat and you spread it, it spreads all over, there’s no height.

00:07:26.555 --> 00:07:30.235
But you put it in a [inaudible] then it gets
heights.

00:07:30.235 --> 00:07:36.335
In the same way, when you have dharma, you get the depth of your dharma

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:41.135
you become a deeper personality.

00:07:41.655 --> 00:07:51.055
And from this dharma, once you become dharmic, then only you start seeing that there’s something beyond you.

00:07:52.735 --> 00:07:58.335
But if you are adharmic, then you think, "This is best for me,

00:07:58.335 --> 00:08:03.915
good, nice lifestyle, why give up this?" And you go on

00:08:06.295 --> 00:08:16.715
gradually disappearing from human value system to sub-human value system.

00:08:16.715 --> 00:08:26.675
It can be animal system, it can be devil system, it can be "bhootish" system, can be any system, there’s no end to it.

00:08:28.055 --> 00:08:35.455
So, there are many dharmas built-in within us which are ten basically, ten dharmas.

00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:41.715
And these ten dharmas are like Ten Commandments in the West.

00:08:42.275 --> 00:08:45.355
They are taught to us as commandments.

00:08:45.355 --> 00:08:50.835
But actually, they are for our benevolence by which we develop our dharma.

00:08:52.275 --> 00:09:03.435
But once you develop your dharma in the centre then your dharma expands to everything:

00:09:04.395 --> 00:09:12.615
the money, the power, your family, to your society, to your country, to the whole world.

00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:18.495
You start thinking, "It’s my dharma." "What
is my dharma now, what should I do?"

00:09:19.455 --> 00:09:27.735
"Towards my children, towards my family, towards my village, towards my nation, towards this whole word,

00:09:27.735 --> 00:09:32.455
what is my dharma?"

00:09:32.455 --> 00:09:37.155
Then when this dharma starts extending, on the horizontal way,

00:09:41.175 --> 00:09:44.995
then you start looking at others,

00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:50.335
trying to find out what is their
problem is? It is my dharma to help this person,

00:09:51.335 --> 00:09:54.435
it is my dharma to do this way, that way.

00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:59.815
Then you extend your family more and more and more, you become very generous,

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:05.335
you become very righteous, you become very kind, you become very mild,

00:10:05.335 --> 00:10:07.915
all those things happen.

00:10:07.915 --> 00:10:12.435
But despite that, you are not yet a Realized soul.

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:20.455
So, sometimes when you are nice and you find there’s reaction outside,

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:23.395
because you are nice people try to trouble you,

00:10:23.395 --> 00:10:27.395
then you think that it’s not sufficient to be nice.

00:10:27.695 --> 00:10:31.255
It’s not enough,  you have to rise higher.

00:10:31.755 --> 00:10:36.735
And that’s how a Mahalakshmi principle is born within you of seeking.

00:10:37.315 --> 00:10:44.595
And modern times are the main things where so many people have got this principle within themselves,

00:10:44.595 --> 00:10:48.915
whether they are conscious of it or not, but they are.

00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:53.175
You never had so many seekers.

00:10:53.175 --> 00:10:58.575
It’s a category, a special category of people you are, that you are all seekers

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:02.135
and that you’ve been seeking the Truth and that’s how you are seekers.

00:11:05.315 --> 00:11:09.915
And once you’re seeking the Truth, then you try to understand

00:11:10.235 --> 00:11:13.255
that you have to seek something higher.

00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:17.875
But if you are not already dharmic, then while seeking there are problems,

00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:21.935
conflicts. Your mind also can fight with you,

00:11:21.935 --> 00:11:24.035
your liver can fight with you,

00:11:24.035 --> 00:11:27.595
anything can fight with you in your body.

00:11:27.595 --> 00:11:33.375
Supposing you have spoiled your liver, then it will fight with you when you are rising.

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:36.415
If there’s something wrong with you,

00:11:36.415 --> 00:11:39.455
say, your father’s side, mother’s side anything,

00:11:39.455 --> 00:11:41.455
it will fight you.

00:11:41.455 --> 00:11:45.235
But still, if the urge is deep

00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:48.355
and intense, you can rise.

00:11:48.355 --> 00:11:51.075
Everybody has to rise.

00:11:51.075 --> 00:11:56.155
Whether you are a king or a queen or a servant or anything,

00:11:56.155 --> 00:11:59.995
everybody has to rise and everybody can rise.

00:11:59.995 --> 00:12:04.055
But everybody will not, this is the problem.

00:12:04.055 --> 00:12:08.295
Everybody will not rise; this is a big problem you have.

00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:13.055
And that’s why we shouldn’t worry about those who do not want to rise.

00:12:13.355 --> 00:12:18.615
We should worry only about people who want to rise and who want to ascent.

00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:26.375
So today, I’ve already told you about the
incarnation of the Goddess at the heart level.

00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:29.655
And this is what Navaratri is,

00:12:29.655 --> 00:12:34.355
where at the heart level She came and saved people

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:40.415
from getting destroyed by the evil forces.

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:44.635
But they were already dharmic, they were already bhaktas,

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:50.175
they were already seeking of God of their "moksha ", their "kalyan ".

00:12:51.575 --> 00:12:55.915
They were not to be told all these things, they were already there.

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:59.175
So, She just saved them at that time

00:12:59.175 --> 00:13:03.455
and She came, again and again, to do that nine times,

00:13:03.995 --> 00:13:07.675
and her ncarnations are regarded as the highest value.

00:13:08.415 --> 00:13:13.255
But then it didn’t work out, because you save those people for what?

00:13:13.255 --> 00:13:16.695
They are still only on the dharma level.

00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:19.395
How will they go beyond this?

00:13:19.395 --> 00:13:22.815
How dharma will become just part and parcel of them?

00:13:22.815 --> 00:13:27.255
It should be Sahaj within them that they should be dharmic,

00:13:27.255 --> 00:13:32.375
as you are.  I don’t have to tell you don’t drink, don’t- you just don’t do it.

00:13:33.275 --> 00:13:39.175
So, this problem is: how to become dharmic without putting any effort.

00:13:39.175 --> 00:13:44.575
Like, morning take hundred and eight names, then you do this, and the whole day you work out,

00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:46.835
you go to the Himalayas,

00:13:46.835 --> 00:13:50.975
and get there in that cold; also here, you have a little bit of that here!

00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:56.375
You should get little immunity.

00:13:56.375 --> 00:14:00.355
Ah! This is nothing compared to what is Himalayas, but still,

00:14:01.055 --> 00:14:07.035
a little bit of its limbs.

00:14:08.635 --> 00:14:14.555
then all these things people seek, they worked very hard for it within themselves.

00:14:15.815 --> 00:14:20.195
But Goddess didn’t tell them that you have to ascend.

00:14:20.195 --> 00:14:22.195
She just killed all the devils

00:14:24.715 --> 00:14:27.635
and She killed all the evil forces.

00:14:28.275 --> 00:14:31.075
And that’s what nine energies have incarnated,

00:14:31.095 --> 00:14:33.535
it was very important.

00:14:33.535 --> 00:14:39.515
So, Navaratri is to pray to Her,

00:14:39.515 --> 00:14:45.435
to pay your tribute that She saved you from evil

00:14:46.835 --> 00:14:50.915
and She gave you a sense of security within you.

00:14:51.255 --> 00:14:54.715
So, at the heart level, centre heart,

00:14:54.715 --> 00:14:58.035
there’s a sense of security.

00:14:58.935 --> 00:15:04.715
When this sense of security is disturbed, then you catch on your centre heart.

00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:11.355
And at the centre heart only, in your childhood, up to twelve years,

00:15:11.835 --> 00:15:13.835
on this sternum bone,

00:15:13.835 --> 00:15:18.355
you develop what you call the antibodies  which are the Ganas.

00:15:18.855 --> 00:15:23.415
These are the Ganas of the Goddess

00:15:23.415 --> 00:15:31.835
and the king of those Ganas is Ganapati, is Ganesha.

00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:41.015
So, whenever you see something that you get a fright,  the sternum starts pulsating in your childhood.

00:15:42.315 --> 00:15:48.395
But when you are grown up, it sends like a remote control the message to all those Ganas

00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:55.935
which go out of the sternum bone in the whole body

00:15:56.515 --> 00:15:59.395
and receive messages

00:15:59.395 --> 00:16:04.615
and then they prepare themselves to fight attacks. Attacks of negativity.

00:16:04.615 --> 00:16:10.135
Say, there’s cancer which is coming out,
that is the kind of a violence they fight.

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:13.135
They try to fight all kinds of things.

00:16:13.655 --> 00:16:17.255
All the negativity they try to fight.

00:16:17.255 --> 00:16:23.855
They have to fight the negativity of the left
side, not the right side.

00:16:25.715 --> 00:16:32.155
The right-side negativity, I think you have
to fight yourself.

00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:36.995
Also, people like Hanumana

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:38.995
and other angels,

00:16:38.995 --> 00:16:44.275
they try to show how stupid you are to be egoistical.

00:16:44.695 --> 00:16:49.435
Every time you try to have some ego,  they show you.

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:53.355
And then they control your ego, they try to show

00:16:53.475 --> 00:16:58.215
how you have fallen into the ditch of ego.

00:16:58.635 --> 00:17:03.355
But when it happens to you, then you start
seeing your ego,

00:17:04.135 --> 00:17:06.775
then you become guilty.

00:17:06.855 --> 00:17:08.035
But that’s not the way.

00:17:08.035 --> 00:17:15.255
If you see your ego then you have to separate yourself from that ego.

00:17:15.355 --> 00:17:17.435
You say, "Oh, so I’m beating
you all right,

00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:19.435
I’ll put you right now."

00:17:19.435 --> 00:17:21.435
"What do you think of yourself?"

00:17:21.715 --> 00:17:25.915
Put the ego down with your ego.

00:17:28.655 --> 00:17:30.675
"What do you think of yourself?"

00:17:30.835 --> 00:17:33.855
"You’re Mr. So and so, you behave like this? All right,

00:17:33.855 --> 00:17:36.595
I’ll beat you with shoes."

00:17:37.735 --> 00:17:42.775
But one should never play into the hands of ego, it’s very dangerous.

00:17:43.435 --> 00:17:48.875
But sometimes, I’ve seen people who are
possessed also can become very egoistical

00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:53.295
because these "bhoots" make you [inaudible].

00:17:55.055 --> 00:17:58.855
And then it’s very dangerous, you never feel you’re doing anything wrong.

00:17:59.595 --> 00:18:02.395
Just start doing wrong, you start aggressing others,

00:18:02.395 --> 00:18:05.255
you never know what you’re aggressing others.

00:18:05.255 --> 00:18:08.295
But if you oppose also these "bhoots" they’ll trouble your body;

00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:10.475
they’ll give you pain.

00:18:10.475 --> 00:18:13.275
But if you accept, they’ll trouble others.

00:18:13.275 --> 00:18:16.755
The person who has ego never feels the pain himself.

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:20.235
But others feel it and they know it’s a very difficult person.

00:18:20.235 --> 00:18:22.515
But he feels, “I’ don't do anything wrong.

00:18:22.515 --> 00:18:24.515
How can people say I’m difficult” [Unsure]

00:18:25.475 --> 00:18:29.955
So, this is how it’s working out within
us

00:18:29.955 --> 00:18:34.575
that we can see our ego because now we have become the Spirit.

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:41.275
So, whatever we see is like a window. Now we can see through the window what is outside.

00:18:41.675 --> 00:18:46.715
And we can really expel our ego and our conditionings

00:18:46.715 --> 00:18:49.255
very nicely if we try to do it.

00:18:51.755 --> 00:18:58.795
So, at this stage, the Mahalakshmi principle started

00:18:59.135 --> 00:19:05.115
and the first incarnation of the Mahalakshmi, as you may know, has come as Sita,

00:19:06.115 --> 00:19:08.115
because of Maryada Purushotama.

00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:11.455
He was the one who was full of Maryadas.

00:19:11.455 --> 00:19:18.275
His wife, She came as the first incarnation of Mahalakshmi on this earth.

00:19:19.215 --> 00:19:24.695
Now, we have today a film on Ramayana, if you want, if you are not been very sleepy, we can see,

00:19:25.275 --> 00:19:28.835
and you can see how She behaved.

00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:34.975
You have some problem of the right heart, I think.

00:19:35.955 --> 00:19:37.955
Yes. What do you mean?

00:19:39.335 --> 00:19:41.335
How is your father?

00:19:41.335 --> 00:19:42.775
My father?

00:19:42.775 --> 00:19:44.775
All right?

00:19:44.775 --> 00:19:47.635
He cannot see out with one eye.

00:19:47.635 --> 00:19:50.575
He cannot see from one eye, Shri Mataji.

00:19:50.575 --> 00:19:51.675
He can’t see.

00:19:51.675 --> 00:19:52.795
From one eye, he’s blocked.

00:19:52.795 --> 00:19:53.755
Which eye?

00:19:53.755 --> 00:19:56.935
The right eye.

00:19:56.935 --> 00:19:58.775
Right eye, he can’t see.

00:19:58.775 --> 00:20:01.295
He has drunk a lot.

00:20:02.095 --> 00:20:04.095
Right eye, he can’t see at all.

00:20:04.095 --> 00:20:08.775
Since two weeks, he cannot see with his right eye.

00:20:09.535 --> 00:20:16.255
It happened suddenly after sleep and he couldn’t see out of his eye.

00:20:17.335 --> 00:20:19.335
Where is he?

00:20:19.335 --> 00:20:21.335
At home.

00:20:29.195 --> 00:20:32.035
He has been to some guru or somebody?

00:20:32.255 --> 00:20:34.255
No, but he has drunk a lot.

00:20:35.235 --> 00:20:39.075
Drinking Shri Mataji. He was drinking much alcohol.

00:20:41.175 --> 00:20:43.175
Drinking.

00:20:44.075 --> 00:20:46.655
But I have been to a guru.

00:20:46.755 --> 00:20:48.055
You have been.

00:20:48.055 --> 00:20:48.695
Yes.

00:20:48.855 --> 00:20:50.855
Which one?

00:20:50.855 --> 00:20:54.795
I have done rebirthing and I
have been to “Sai Baba”.

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:55.515
Hu?

00:20:55.515 --> 00:20:57.215
“Sai Baba”.

00:20:57.215 --> 00:21:00.275
This Shirdi Sai Nath?

00:21:00.275 --> 00:21:02.535
Fake Sai Baba.

00:21:02.535 --> 00:21:03.955
It’s another fellow?

00:21:04.135 --> 00:21:04.815
Yes

00:21:12.555 --> 00:21:16.795
He was one of the devils killed by the Goddess. And he was Mahishasura.

00:21:17.495 --> 00:21:22.795
The whole song, Mahishasura Mardini, is on that.”

00:21:27.115 --> 00:21:31.315
But your father must be having diabetes, I’m sure.

00:21:31.995 --> 00:21:33.995
Did he have diabetes?

00:21:36.835 --> 00:21:39.575
My girl-friend has diabetes.

00:21:39.575 --> 00:21:40.775
Who has?

00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:42.075
My girl-friend.

00:21:42.075 --> 00:21:42.735
She has.

00:21:42.735 --> 00:21:43.635
Yes.

00:21:44.555 --> 00:21:46.935
He doesn’t have. Your father doesn't have.

00:21:49.435 --> 00:21:52.775
It’s possible but as far as I know, not.

00:21:54.175 --> 00:22:00.975
Must have started also. Drinking too much, you see, spoils your liver completely

00:22:00.975 --> 00:22:05.935
and also can go to the Agnya, Swadisthana.

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:11.755
[The old black and white Ramayana video starts]

00:22:11.755 --> 00:22:14.355
Now, you all can turn round.

00:22:16.855 --> 00:22:20.135
I don’t know which sort of a- this thing.

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:25.775
Rama is going to the jungle.

00:22:27.955 --> 00:22:33.835
As you are around here. What is this? This you can take it out of here.

00:22:37.715 --> 00:22:39.715
You can just [inaudible].

00:22:43.815 --> 00:22:47.315
Very, very, very old pictures.

00:22:47.315 --> 00:22:51.115
Very old one. You must have seen this one.

00:23:08.215 --> 00:23:10.215
Very old.

00:23:29.335 --> 00:23:33.235
You see, you have to be the other way round, I think.

00:23:33.235 --> 00:23:35.235
See what you have to pray.

00:23:35.235 --> 00:23:37.235
[Hindi]
