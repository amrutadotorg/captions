00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:10.074
It was very beautiful of [the] children
to come and receive Me

00:00:11.217 --> 00:00:14.652
in this beautiful manner.

00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:22.215
It can take you back to the days of Krishna

00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:31.812
when, in His childhood, He was very much
respected by His friends

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:40.201
and they tried to do all the honour
that was possible.

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:44.762
You know the story of His birth.

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:49.140
Also you know the story –

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:55.098
[I think if you stop the water then -
otherwise, My speech might be little bit…]

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.489
You know the story of His birth.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.523
And here we have the flowing of water,
both the sides.

00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:17.916
The way He used to play His flute,
along the Yamuna River.

00:01:19.304 --> 00:01:26.719
The whole thing looks, sometimes, so human,
but it is not.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.970
And, at the right time, whenever He needed,
as a child, He manifested His powers:

00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:41.572
that He killed a woman who was a devil

00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:45.617
[and] ultimately He killed Kansa.

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:55.310
After that you know that He preached Gita,

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:59.254
but it’s not so fast as that.

00:01:59.455 --> 00:02:06.271
After killing Kansa, He went down
to Dwarika to rule there.

00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:13.525
And there He had to marry five more wives.

00:02:14.313 --> 00:02:19.445
First He had sixteen thousand wives.
So then many people can ask a question,

00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:23.720
“Mother, what sort of a husband
He must be?”

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:33.314
These sixteen thousand should explain
that He has sixteen petals

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.579
on His domain of Vishuddhi chakra

00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:53.244
and theses sixteen petals, multiplied
by the one thousand petals

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.213
of the Sahastrara become sixteen thousand.

00:02:57.414 --> 00:03:05.236
So these are sixteen thousand powers,
which are available to us also.

00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:13.459
These sixteen thousand powers are working
in the brain.

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:21.547
These powers could not come
as Sahaja Yogis,

00:03:21.982 --> 00:03:25.618
so they came as women

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.851
who were entrapped by a king – exactly
sixteen thousand –

00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:39.097
and He married them because by marriage,
it was all very dharmic.

00:03:39.298 --> 00:03:46.869
Also He married five wives later, who
represented the five elements.

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:58.316
Incarnations cannot be understood
from human angle –

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.980
can never be understood, I should say –

00:04:04.197 --> 00:04:11.116
because their ways and methods
are different.

00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:15.260
They have ways and methods of their own

00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:22.125
and they do not expose them to other
people.

00:04:22.326 --> 00:04:28.768
Not that they are afraid to expose
or they don’t want to expose,

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:35.983
but it will not be intelligible, it cannot
be understood by human beings.

00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:40.882
If you ask Me a question, say, “Mother,
how do you manage that?”

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.092
I may just change the topic very cleverly.

00:04:53.821 --> 00:05:02.047
So now, I am going to tell you about
sixteen thousand petals of the Sahastrara

00:05:02.248 --> 00:05:06.225
and now we can start the translation.

00:05:07.232 --> 00:05:10.451
[To the translator: “In gist you can
tell them.”]

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:06.910
So now, to understand the sixteen thousand
powers that you have got

00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:12.507
in your brain, already manifesting:
As soon as you get your Realisation

00:07:12.708 --> 00:07:19.293
those sixteen thousand powers start
manifesting.

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:46.146
Every petal of Sahastrara has got sixteen
powers.

00:07:53.522 --> 00:08:05.730
And these are – I mean the petals -
are made of the five elements.

00:08:09.268 --> 00:08:20.356
So these five elements, who create these
one thousand petals,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:32.062
have got sixteen powers on every petal.

00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:43.079
Now the five elements is the right side,

00:08:44.593 --> 00:08:56.071
which is the content or, we can say,
the matter of the brain.

00:09:01.221 --> 00:09:11.507
The matter of the brain is created
in such a manner

00:09:12.033 --> 00:09:15.550
that it has a protective matter also.

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:20.305
So we have grey matter and also

00:09:20.506 --> 00:09:26.069
the white matter which is outside
to protect the grey matter.

00:09:39.052 --> 00:09:50.364
Now these sixteen powers which are
expressed in every petal

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:57.967
are coming from the left side.

00:10:00.295 --> 00:10:05.196
Shri Krishna is an Incarnation of the left
side.

00:10:07.493 --> 00:10:15.029
So the sixteen powers which are coming
from the left side

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:24.298
adorn the petals which are made
of five elements.

00:10:33.117 --> 00:10:39.680
But these powers already exist
in the brain.

00:10:41.795 --> 00:10:54.704
By these five, plus sixteen, powers we do
all our nervous system work.

00:11:01.401 --> 00:11:07.135
For example, if you have to lift your hand
like this,

00:11:08.536 --> 00:11:16.249
then it is worked, first of all, through
the left side

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.777
which desires that it should be lifted.

00:11:27.003 --> 00:11:36.872
And then is ordered to the five powers
or five elements: they go into the action.

00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:46.899
Also we have in our system

00:11:47.745 --> 00:11:57.386
a special type of arrangement where
there is a reflex action,

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:09.070
which is built earlier in our evolution.

00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:22.866
So, in a human consciousness whatever
works is not a reflex action.

00:12:28.954 --> 00:12:34.811
But now, when your Sahastrara is
enlightened with the Kundalini,

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:45.540
all these one thousand powers multiply it
into sixteen thousand.

00:12:51.336 --> 00:12:56.033
So all the nerves in the body get
enlightenment.

00:12:58.798 --> 00:13:03.776
Your attention becomes enlightened.

00:13:05.592 --> 00:13:13.945
With these one thousand dimensions you
become collectively conscious.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:25.758
We can say like this: if there are sixteen
people staying in five houses

00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:33.927
and they are working separately

00:13:34.128 --> 00:13:37.572
and sometimes coordinating.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.720
But [then] a flood comes in.

00:13:44.187 --> 00:13:46.867
[Aside to the translator: “Flood, flood.”]

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:55.992
As a result of the flood all these houses
are brought together

00:13:58.368 --> 00:14:03.497
and get enveloped into the energy
of that flood.

00:14:05.438 --> 00:14:09.137
Then they join hands together.

00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:14.604
They forget their houses

00:14:15.507 --> 00:14:22.913
and they start using now a new energy
of collective consciousness.

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:29.953
This is exactly what has happened in you,

00:14:31.061 --> 00:14:37.359
that as soon as the Kundalini has risen
within you and given you Realisation,

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:46.978
the flood has brought these dormant
energies in you into play.

00:14:56.106 --> 00:15:00.241
You don’t have to think that you have
to hold each other’s hand

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:05.467
when there’s a flood, you just hold it
automatically, spontaneously.

00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:19.182
So all the energies suddenly start getting
into motion.

00:15:22.954 --> 00:15:31.878
So this power where the one thousand
energies of the brain

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:39.600
[are] suddenly awakened, is the power
called as Viratangana.

00:15:47.676 --> 00:15:52.541
That is - she is the power of the Virat.

00:15:55.519 --> 00:16:03.736
She is the power which makes Shri Krishna
a Virat.

00:16:08.057 --> 00:16:17.322
So the sixteen thousand powers which
He achieves in your being

00:16:20.758 --> 00:16:25.394
is done through the power of Viratangana.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:36.121
And at these modern times you know
who is that.

00:16:39.075 --> 00:16:44.300
So the Adi Shakti takes the form
of Viratangana.

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:56.718
With that enlightenment you achieve
your Realisation.

00:17:00.372 --> 00:17:05.293
So the Kundalini passing through different
centres,

00:17:05.494 --> 00:17:10.103
enlightening the different energies,
ultimately comes to the brain

00:17:10.304 --> 00:17:15.051
and enlightens the Viratangana power.

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:31.441
At this point, at the brain point,
the Kundalini starts spreading in the head.

00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:41.265
She, of course, shoots off from the
Sahastrara but also she trickles down

00:17:41.466 --> 00:17:48.944
through this plate of the brain (medha)
downwards on the sympathetic.

00:17:58.673 --> 00:18:03.329
That relaxes you. That’s why you feel
relaxed.

00:18:03.629 --> 00:18:07.097
It relaxes the sympathetic.

00:18:07.748 --> 00:18:13.236
That enlarges the centres.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:20.167
It brings it back to its normal positions.

00:18:22.071 --> 00:18:25.425
The enlargement of the parasympathetic,
or Sushumna,

00:18:25.626 --> 00:18:30.590
makes the Kundalini rise in more quantum.

00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:44.430
It is all done by a reflex action
of Kundalini.

00:18:46.332 --> 00:18:50.975
So the Kundalini is already built in such
a manner that, when she rises,

00:18:51.176 --> 00:18:56.029
she automatically does all these things.

00:19:00.793 --> 00:19:06.984
So your Kundalini has got the power
to enlighten all your centres,

00:19:07.185 --> 00:19:14.653
and to enlighten your brain, and
to relax you,

00:19:14.854 --> 00:19:23.877
to increase the size of the centres, and
make the Kundalini rise again!

00:19:39.413 --> 00:19:45.574
But the Kundalini has a very special power:

00:19:47.047 --> 00:19:53.027
that every human being’s Kundalini
knows Me.

00:19:56.683 --> 00:19:59.199
Many people who have just seen
My photograph

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.637
have got their Kundalini awakened.

00:20:08.553 --> 00:20:14.278
But if your centres are very clouded,
or exhausted,

00:20:14.479 --> 00:20:20.574
or jammed together, or separated away
from each other,

00:20:20.775 --> 00:20:24.923
then the Kundalini stops there.

00:20:36.901 --> 00:20:43.787
That’s why some people get Realisation
very fast and some take time.

00:20:48.726 --> 00:20:53.869
These conditioned minds are the most
difficult.

00:20:56.939 --> 00:20:59.192
Shri Mataji: What’s happening?
Yogi: I don’t know.

00:20:59.393 --> 00:21:02.544
Shri Mataji: Is it touching each other?

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.688
Energy joined together.

00:21:11.048 --> 00:21:14.350
Yogi translator: But not in the central
way.

00:21:23.397 --> 00:21:26.079
Shri Mataji: What’s happening?

00:21:29.124 --> 00:21:31.657
Yogi translator: OK? No.

00:21:35.566 --> 00:21:44.460
Now the rising of the Kundalini is achieved
better in a place

00:21:44.661 --> 00:21:56.355
which is frequented or visited
or lived into by saints,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:10.141
also for people who are not so complicated.

00:22:15.159 --> 00:22:19.029
For example, today only, I discovered

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:24.901
that the Catholic Church has complicated
your lives so much.

00:22:30.533 --> 00:22:36.938
I did not know that they have been
preaching that sex is a sin!

00:22:41.985 --> 00:22:45.050
Then, if that is so,

00:22:45.251 --> 00:22:51.805
that means only Adam and Eve, two
would have lived on this Earth.

00:22:56.552 --> 00:23:02.395
And these people were not with Adam and Eve
to know what they did!

00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:11.394
And this absurd idea

00:23:11.595 --> 00:23:18.015
was very much there also at the time
of Shri Krishna among Indians.

00:23:22.011 --> 00:23:29.081
And as a result of that, we had ascetics
who were very hot-tempered.

00:23:35.134 --> 00:23:42.269
They developed one-sided personality,
of say, a sun-like,

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:49.659
if they looked at somebody, they could just
burn him off – bhasma (ashes).

00:23:55.031 --> 00:24:00.084
And such austerity they had that,
if you had to talk to them,

00:24:00.285 --> 00:24:11.851
you had to use at least a distant,
some pole, hollow pole -

00:24:15.625 --> 00:24:18.810
such horrid people.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.429
But Shri Krishna when He was born,

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:30.678
He found out this imbalance is being
created.

00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:40.189
At the same time His cousin, whose name
was Neminath,

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:47.866
who was a Jain Tirthankara, developed
an aversion to meat eating.

00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:51.103
(Aside to the translator: “Meat eating”).

00:25:00.843 --> 00:25:06.452
As a result of that, another extreme nature
started,

00:25:08.992 --> 00:25:14.623
and people thought that eating meat
is a sin.

00:25:16.912 --> 00:25:22.551
All kinds of varieties of ‘sins’ started
prospering.

00:25:24.543 --> 00:25:27.371
And they had brands [of sins]; this brand,
that brand.

00:25:27.572 --> 00:25:30.178
As you have brands like Christian Dior,
this, that –

00:25:30.379 --> 00:25:34.951
like that: this sin, this sin, this sin,
like that.

00:25:40.827 --> 00:25:49.150
But underneath, they were very much
infatuated by sex.

00:25:54.966 --> 00:26:03.101
They are the ones who started these
erotic temples in India – Jains.

00:26:06.709 --> 00:26:14.677
Now the other side of it is that
the horrible Hindu ‘saints’ –

00:26:14.899 --> 00:26:18.074
not saints I should say, what should we
call them? – ascetics,

00:26:18.275 --> 00:26:24.344
and the terrible, these Jain people,
all put together,

00:26:24.545 --> 00:26:31.145
formed a formidable idea about religion.

00:26:38.591 --> 00:26:43.158
So Krishna took an Incarnation.

00:26:45.031 --> 00:26:49.483
It was not only to kill Kansa

00:26:52.285 --> 00:27:00.051
but to tell people that this kind of stupid
conditioning is not religion.

00:27:04.347 --> 00:27:09.939
Religion can never be against the natural
laws.

00:27:12.466 --> 00:27:22.493
But the ascent starts moving from a sex
which has no maryadas –

00:27:22.694 --> 00:27:26.463
or in the lower animals it is even worse
than that –

00:27:26.664 --> 00:27:31.556
going up to a point in human beings where
it has to have maryadas:

00:27:31.757 --> 00:27:39.275
to be devoted to one person, and be
faithful to that person.

00:28:02.698 --> 00:28:14.336
And then He brought forth the religion
of natural maryadas.

00:28:24.236 --> 00:28:29.729
You have to marry the person.
Yogi translator: You have to marry.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:37.152
Shri Mataji: Marry. You had to marry
the person. Marriage.

00:28:37.353 --> 00:28:41.946
Yogi translator: Marry? Yes? Shri Mataji:
He gets nervous with the word!

00:28:49.976 --> 00:28:55.077
All right. Yes, people do get nervous!

00:29:01.992 --> 00:29:09.909
Now, He had married five wives and sixteen
more, sixteen thousand more.

00:29:11.568 --> 00:29:16.930
So they challenged (Him), “What do you
say of one marriage with one person?

00:29:17.131 --> 00:29:20.809
You already have so many wives!”

00:29:24.246 --> 00:29:31.257
Then, I have told you already a story [of]
how He proved that He was a Yogeshwara.

00:29:36.069 --> 00:29:40.550
He was beyond all these relationships.

00:29:42.775 --> 00:29:51.993
And this shows that, for Yogeshwaras, it
does not matter how many times He married

00:29:56.210 --> 00:30:01.898
or, for a Yogeshwari like Me, how many
children I have!

00:30:26.189 --> 00:30:32.633
So the times – or what we call
the samayachar –

00:30:32.834 --> 00:30:39.528
makes a person behave in a particular
manner which is an Incarnation.

00:30:46.341 --> 00:30:57.000
There was a murder case for a man who was
following Hare Rama Hare Krishna [cult].

00:31:00.654 --> 00:31:05.599
Of course, it was not established, but
he felt that, after all, he’s Krishna,

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.829
so he can kill people.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:21.120
Now, Krishna was an Incarnation,

00:31:23.803 --> 00:31:28.126
He knew whom to kill and how to kill.

00:31:29.394 --> 00:31:35.589
He said that, “Nobody is living, now I’ve
already killed them.”

00:31:41.112 --> 00:31:46.560
The discretion of an Incarnation is
perfect.

00:31:48.007 --> 00:31:54.212
So one should not immediately think that
because an Incarnation has done like this,

00:31:54.413 --> 00:31:57.245
so we can also do.

00:32:01.868 --> 00:32:06.017
But human beings always take over.

00:32:09.239 --> 00:32:15.034
That’s the stupidity part of all the human
beings, I must say.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:23.884
Like the Christians, all of them believe
they must get crucified

00:32:26.548 --> 00:32:29.209
and they must suffer.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.869
Are you Christ?

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:39.131
By so many crucifixions of so many
stupid Christians

00:32:41.536 --> 00:32:44.971
what are we going to achieve?

00:32:46.081 --> 00:32:53.051
All sorts of complicated ideas come out
of all this kind of a nonsensical thing,

00:32:55.357 --> 00:33:00.019
just to say [that] there has to be gloom.

00:33:02.307 --> 00:33:09.337
Like yesterday as I told you, is
a miserable people.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.530
Christ crucified Himself so that your Agya
could be cleared

00:33:16.739 --> 00:33:20.144
and that you enjoy life,

00:33:24.895 --> 00:33:28.987
because Christ Himself was an Incarnation,

00:33:29.188 --> 00:33:34.920
and whether you crucify Him or do not
crucify Him makes no difference to Him.

00:33:38.824 --> 00:33:42.964
So the difference between the Incarnation
and a human being

00:33:43.165 --> 00:33:48.394
is to be understood, first of all,
in Krishna’s life.

00:33:55.094 --> 00:33:59.465
When it started raining heavily and when
Indra wanted

00:33:59.666 --> 00:34:04.855
to put down Shri Krishna, the rains
were so strong.

00:34:05.056 --> 00:34:12.390
He just lifted one mountain, Govardhan,
on His one finger.

00:34:24.269 --> 00:34:29.689
So the others, who were His followers,
His Gopas,

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:35.535
they also had some sticks with them,
so they also put some sticks, you see.

00:34:44.812 --> 00:34:47.594
But they were children!

00:34:47.795 --> 00:34:55.909
Now, I don’t understand the people who
are so grown up, who look grown up,

00:34:56.385 --> 00:35:00.987
and behave worse than children!

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.876
Nature teaches us all the time.

00:35:13.111 --> 00:35:16.584
See now, people are understanding that
whatever they have done,

00:35:16.785 --> 00:35:19.614
as far as the marriage is concerned,
is a wrong thing

00:35:19.815 --> 00:35:24.621
and now they are coming down to what
Shri Krishna had said.

00:35:37.473 --> 00:35:41.199
Shri Mataji: What did you say?
Translator: As far as what is concerned.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.474
Shri Mataji: Again marriage.
Translator: Marriage again!

00:35:48.351 --> 00:35:53.202
It’s like a red rag [to a bull] to him!
And to many!

00:35:53.403 --> 00:35:59.198
That’s also, I think, is this Catholic
Church.

00:36:03.852 --> 00:36:07.984
But why did Christ attend a wedding?

00:36:10.325 --> 00:36:14.523
I mean, this should be understood:
if He was against marriage

00:36:14.724 --> 00:36:21.466
why did He attend a wedding and also
made wine for them?

00:36:32.404 --> 00:36:38.373
But they used that incident just because
they want to drink wine!

00:36:44.515 --> 00:36:48.055
But even there, Christ was very careful,

00:36:48.256 --> 00:36:52.736
what He did, He made water into wine,
in a second like that.

00:36:52.937 --> 00:36:57.656
But to make an alcohol, you must
ferment it.

00:37:05.801 --> 00:37:09.818
I can also do that, so what?

00:37:10.019 --> 00:37:15.413
But I can’t make an alcohol, I‘ll have
to put some fungus into it.

00:37:21.488 --> 00:37:30.341
So, this is what it is: how people have
made God or Incarnations into –

00:37:30.542 --> 00:37:37.126
according to their small minds and
according to their selfish ends.

00:37:42.528 --> 00:37:46.121
Because if you say that you are originally
a sinner,

00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:49.568
then you say, “Now what do we do?”

00:37:53.049 --> 00:37:57.592
“Now for atonement, you give lots
of money,”

00:38:00.221 --> 00:38:04.686
and God doesn’t understand money –
what’s the use?

00:38:07.888 --> 00:38:12.870
Is all wrong, absolutely wrong.

00:38:13.071 --> 00:38:15.299
You have committed no sins.

00:38:15.508 --> 00:38:20.347
These are all non-existent things
they are talking about.

00:38:23.275 --> 00:38:26.915
But I've seen in the West, people would
say, “How can our Kundalini rise?

00:38:27.116 --> 00:38:30.039
We are sinners."

00:38:35.101 --> 00:38:39.899
Better give up all these conditionings.

00:38:42.315 --> 00:38:45.913
Nobody is a sinner:

00:38:46.114 --> 00:38:49.538
that’s what Shri Krishna said.

00:38:49.926 --> 00:38:55.654
Of course, He divided people into three
categories, basically.

00:38:58.765 --> 00:39:04.402
But He said that anybody can get
Self-realisation

00:39:06.014 --> 00:39:09.501
and could be enlightened.

00:39:10.462 --> 00:39:17.717
If He had believed that people are sinners
He would not have said this.

00:39:20.895 --> 00:39:28.339
This is absolutely anti-God and anti-Christ
and anti-Krishna.

00:39:30.497 --> 00:39:35.483
Here you are, the Virata has created you,

00:39:35.684 --> 00:39:39.669
up to a point, brought you to a point.

00:39:42.486 --> 00:39:47.399
Now you are just about to flower out

00:39:50.272 --> 00:39:56.757
and already you are told that, as seeds,
you had some disease in you.

00:40:00.848 --> 00:40:03.911
So all the great work of evolution,

00:40:04.112 --> 00:40:11.829
the great work of taking you to the Kingdom
of God is completely cut out.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.963
So today is the day to be joyous,

00:40:29.022 --> 00:40:31.772
to be happy –

00:40:32.181 --> 00:40:39.255
but not jumping in the sea [but] keeping
to your boat of maryadas –

00:40:44.801 --> 00:40:52.333
because you have got now your brain
enlightened.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:41:00.359
This brain is now, such a powerful thing
you have got,

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.741
that it pierces through all the five koshas
you have around you,

00:41:05.942 --> 00:41:12.903
all the five auras around you, made
by the five elements.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:26.877
This brain touches the subtle of the ether,

00:41:31.229 --> 00:41:34.759
the subtle of the Mother Earth,

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:41.282
the subtle of all the elements.

00:41:42.782 --> 00:41:47.574
By this enlightenment you have become
subtle.

00:41:49.232 --> 00:41:53.738
So we have to forget about the gross
things.

00:41:54.899 --> 00:42:05.444
Gross things just follow anything that is
subtle just like a magnet attracts.

00:42:11.924 --> 00:42:20.903
Once in Australia, it was a puja
of Shri Ganesha.

00:42:22.899 --> 00:42:30.356
And the hibiscus, red flower, is the flower
for Shri Ganesha.

00:42:33.278 --> 00:42:36.017
And when we were going for the puja,
all around

00:42:36.218 --> 00:42:40.042
I saw this hibiscus flower coming out.

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:46.766
So I told Sahaja Yogis, “Better stop
the car somewhere,

00:42:46.967 --> 00:42:52.262
and get hold of some of these flowers
for the puja."

00:42:55.583 --> 00:42:58.869
But then they forgot!

00:43:00.364 --> 00:43:06.815
You know the mantra, “Ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu bhranti rupena samsthita”.

00:43:08.884 --> 00:43:10.889
So the illusion.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:17.187
And then, they suddenly remembered, “Oh
Mother, we’ve forgotten the flowers!”.

00:43:21.416 --> 00:43:26.751
I said, “It’s nice you’ve forgotten,
somebody has taken over from you.

00:43:28.543 --> 00:43:31.682
That’s why you have forgotten."

00:43:32.179 --> 00:43:37.155
When we reached the puja thing, the whole
place was filled

00:43:37.356 --> 00:43:42.756
with baskets and baskets
of those flowers!

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:53.550
So when you forget, don’t think that
you have forgotten something,

00:43:53.751 --> 00:43:57.327
so something has gone wrong with you.

00:44:02.505 --> 00:44:07.577
No, it has gone to your subtle
understanding,

00:44:09.931 --> 00:44:14.352
which works out in a reflex manner,

00:44:14.727 --> 00:44:20.372
but into sixteen thousand dimensions.

00:44:21.642 --> 00:44:27.294
Can you imagine an instrument with sixteen
thousand wires

00:44:27.495 --> 00:44:31.033
connected with another sixteen thousand
wires

00:44:31.234 --> 00:44:39.315
with another sixteen thousand wires, and
all the time working so efficiently?

00:44:46.597 --> 00:44:50.160
This is the work of Virata

00:44:50.697 --> 00:44:55.333
and this is the work of this enlightened
mind.

00:44:57.685 --> 00:45:02.691
So you don’t have to worry about the gross
part.

00:45:03.505 --> 00:45:07.274
You want an ashram, you’ll have it.

00:45:26.581 --> 00:45:33.573
Anything gross, mundane, will work out.

00:45:35.346 --> 00:45:38.381
But, at this stage, you must remember

00:45:38.582 --> 00:45:45.099
that you have to just put your
attention to it for a minute.

00:45:48.131 --> 00:45:54.793
Just an attention – what we say is
the bandhan – and it works.

00:45:58.109 --> 00:46:00.142
But the main thing one has to remember [is]

00:46:00.343 --> 00:46:05.361
that we are Yogis, we are enlightened
souls.

00:46:07.623 --> 00:46:12.715
We are specially blessed people with
special powers.

00:46:14.548 --> 00:46:18.801
And there are very simple ways by which
we can control

00:46:19.011 --> 00:46:22.695
all these mundane things.

00:46:25.583 --> 00:46:31.634
And the whole thing will happen so
beautifully that you’ll be surprised!

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:42.598
That is what one has to realise: the powers
of your Sahastrara.

00:46:45.048 --> 00:46:50.700
I’ve told you that sixteen powers already
were there.

00:46:51.939 --> 00:46:57.018
So, sixteen powers that were there,
were twelve of the heart

00:46:57.219 --> 00:47:03.072
and four of Shri Ganesha, were
in your brain already.

00:47:08.677 --> 00:47:11.613
And that is how you were an emotional
person

00:47:11.814 --> 00:47:17.520
and you had relationships of emotions
and also relationships

00:47:17.721 --> 00:47:26.023
with others of innocence as well
as of relationship of marriage.

00:47:34.684 --> 00:47:40.037
This was all built-in within you.

00:47:42.604 --> 00:47:48.904
But because of these kind of stupid ideas,
all these natural feelings were suppressed,

00:47:49.113 --> 00:47:54.199
that nobody was a sister, nobody was
a child, nobody was a brother,

00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:01.085
and all these stupid ideas have finishes
those beautiful feelings

00:48:01.286 --> 00:48:13.552
of flowers, of fragrance – completely
destroyed.

00:48:33.444 --> 00:48:39.926
The false fears and the false ideas
and the false prohibitions,

00:48:40.127 --> 00:48:45.705
all have ruined that part of the brain.

00:48:54.018 --> 00:48:57.431
The ‘gauche’, correct.

00:48:58.867 --> 00:49:03.183
And the right side started working.

00:49:04.358 --> 00:49:08.036
Only the right side working.

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:12.291
Then left side doesn’t exist,

00:49:12.492 --> 00:49:17.604
all the values of the left side do not
exist.

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:24.919
Only the right side and the connection
with the right side,

00:49:25.303 --> 00:49:29.750
with the things that we do with the right
side.

00:49:35.772 --> 00:49:40.135
Also to add it up, so many things came
like industrial revolution

00:49:40.336 --> 00:49:46.882
and the war and all that, so the right side
became the dominant part

00:49:51.181 --> 00:49:54.644
and this ego developed.

00:49:54.953 --> 00:50:01.145
Ego makes you feel very important
and you just -

00:50:01.314 --> 00:50:06.599
love becomes nothing but egocentric.

00:50:12.699 --> 00:50:17.492
In addition to that, when money became
important,

00:50:19.421 --> 00:50:27.598
then it is like somebody who is already
a drunk man, and a scorpion bites him.

00:50:29.408 --> 00:50:33.438
The situation was very bad.

00:50:34.644 --> 00:50:42.204
All the ways and methods, permutations
and combinations,

00:50:42.405 --> 00:50:51.400
of escalating this situation, escalating
this ego was created by the same ego.

00:51:00.417 --> 00:51:06.345
This is the most dangerous thing we have
in the West.

00:51:07.646 --> 00:51:14.396
For them, even a love for the wife

00:51:14.597 --> 00:51:19.940
(Aside: “Thank you. Thank you very much.
It’s alright.”)

00:51:20.385 --> 00:51:29.417
is a thing to be valued in money.

00:51:36.108 --> 00:51:39.736
Everything is business,

00:51:39.937 --> 00:51:46.595
whether it is church, whether it is mafia,

00:51:47.035 --> 00:51:49.841
whether it is politics,

00:51:50.042 --> 00:51:53.951
everything is money.

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:58.074
Money becomes the power.

00:51:59.582 --> 00:52:03.953
Then, if money is everything, why care
for chastity?

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:08.062
Why care for innocence?

00:52:12.182 --> 00:52:16.436
Why care for art?

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:21.751
Whatever can sell is art.

00:52:23.667 --> 00:52:28.464
Whatever can fetch money is a relationship.

00:52:29.845 --> 00:52:34.374
So the whole dryness on the left hand side

00:52:35.052 --> 00:52:48.398
created a problem again for the left-sided
extremes to be sucked in.

00:52:56.241 --> 00:53:01.239
So the Collective Subconscious was sucked
into your subconscious mind

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:04.899
and then to your conscious mind.

00:53:14.145 --> 00:53:19.549
And you can say that the ego reached
such a point into your brain

00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:25.722
that it started getting into superego,

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:37.578
and a very messy personality was created.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.380
So I have to tell you one thing:

00:53:45.581 --> 00:53:49.932
you are in for your ascent,

00:53:51.596 --> 00:53:56.247
you are in for getting all your powers,

00:54:00.523 --> 00:54:07.505
and you are in for your Kingdom of God,

00:54:08.799 --> 00:54:15.061
but you must work out your left side

00:54:16.824 --> 00:54:23.443
with understanding of purity,

00:54:25.053 --> 00:54:28.606
pure relationships,

00:54:28.807 --> 00:54:33.558
and the right side by facing it,

00:54:35.574 --> 00:54:40.397
the facing [of] your plastic ego.

00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:49.488
When you don’t want to do something,
ask yourself, “Why am I not doing it?”

00:54:53.814 --> 00:55:03.056
And when the left side is sucked in,
a lethargy, an inertia sets in.

00:55:07.863 --> 00:55:15.481
All the right side gets completely drenched
or completely overpowered

00:55:15.682 --> 00:55:21.617
by the left side powerful entities.

00:55:30.154 --> 00:55:34.359
People feel very tired all the time

00:55:34.785 --> 00:55:41.494
and they want always to drink or to take
drugs to go to the left side

00:55:43.661 --> 00:55:47.054
and the inertia sets in.

00:55:47.927 --> 00:55:51.766
That’s why there’s a problem.

00:55:52.203 --> 00:55:56.914
But collectively, if we understand this is
the problem,

00:56:00.927 --> 00:56:04.898
we all can work it out together.

00:56:06.726 --> 00:56:10.373
Not despising anyone,

00:56:10.849 --> 00:56:14.464
not correcting anyone,

00:56:15.086 --> 00:56:18.494
but correcting yourself

00:56:18.695 --> 00:56:22.497
and not correcting your leaders.

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:27.252
It will work out, I'm sure it will
work out.

00:56:27.453 --> 00:56:30.396
Today is a great day,

00:56:30.597 --> 00:56:35.090
and I remember this France,

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:42.191
such inertia like rock of Gibraltar.

00:56:44.998 --> 00:56:48.643
I didn’t know how to move their brains;

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:53.459
brains were made of plastic –

00:56:53.697 --> 00:56:56.261
what to do with them?

00:56:56.462 --> 00:57:01.252
Can you believe, in the first year I came
three times!

00:57:02.499 --> 00:57:07.785
I went on banging in France and even
English people said,

00:57:07.986 --> 00:57:11.818
“Mother, why do you go to France so often?”

00:57:17.689 --> 00:57:23.498
Now, even the English are comparable!

00:57:26.072 --> 00:57:31.697
I should have been equally dynamic
about them,

00:57:32.469 --> 00:57:35.170
and I was.

00:57:35.934 --> 00:57:41.216
It was a work of tremendous patience,
and love,

00:57:43.906 --> 00:57:51.098
of understanding that they are deserving
cases

00:57:53.325 --> 00:57:57.685
lost in the wilderness of ego.

00:58:01.622 --> 00:58:07.736
But they are the ones who will save Europe,

00:58:08.325 --> 00:58:12.362
England and America.

00:58:12.563 --> 00:58:15.476
May God bless you.
