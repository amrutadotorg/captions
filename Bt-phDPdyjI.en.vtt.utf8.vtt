00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:09.450
Today's puja is very important for us. You
all have got your Self Realization. You have

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.080
all the knowledge that is necessary to give
Realizations to others. You have to know what

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:31.440
you have already. That's very important, because
if you do not try your hand and if you do

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.270
not try to give Realizations to others, firstly
you'll have no faith in yourself. You'll have

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.600
no self-esteem also.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.600
The second part is that you try giving vibrations
to other persons, but don't get involved with

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.120
that person. I've seen some people get too
much involved. If they give Realization to

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.149
one person, they think they have done a great
job and they start working on that person,

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:20.149
his family, his relations, this thing. So,
so far as you must have learned, that one

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.549
may be related, one may be closer to one person,
but not necessarily he will have that much

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.439
of chance of Self Realization. Only way to
grow is to be collective. There's no other

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:50.340
way out. If people think that by staying away
from ashrams, alone living somewhere they

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.310
will achieve much - that's not the way Sahaja
Yoga is meant.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.310
Formerly, people used to go to Himalayas and
most of them were separated and only one or

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.880
two persons were chosen for spiritual growth.
Here it is not question of spiritual growth,

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:21.099
it's a question of your collectivity growing
in you. That is how you become a person who

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.400
is collective, who enjoys collective, who
works on collective and lives with collective.

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.739
Such a person develops new kind of powers.
And these powers are such that they are very

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.959
subtle, but they penetrate into any molecule,
atom or human beings, anywhere. And their

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:08.519
penetration is only possible if you have a
temperament which is collective. Without being

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.959
fully collective, you cannot achieve that
height which is very necessary today for Sahaja

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.049
Yoga.

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:29.049
As you know, there are problems and problems
all over, as if you feel that the world is

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.950
going to sink. Specially when I went to America
I felt that "My goodness, this is a hell that

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.749
they have created here." Is just a hell because
they have no dharma, they don't believe in

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:50.749
any dharma, completely they worship adharma
and this kind of climate is flowing all over.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.819
All over the world, you get reaction of American
adharmic life. And people think there's nothing

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.329
wrong in it. Whatever you may tell them, they
will not believe nor they will think that

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:16.329
there's any verdict. But they don't see the
destruction from the very basis of their life,

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.420
their families, their societies. The whole
country, I feel, is filled with such ugly

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.340
type of adharmic nature, that one cannot even
imagine how such ideas came into their heads.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:45.170
And these ideas I need not tell you, you know
them very well. But if you have to save your

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:52.170
children, you have to be an ideal guru yourself.
If you just talk of Sahaja Yoga and if you

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.820
try to assume that you are a Sahaja Yogi,
also you try to propagate Sahaja Yoga without

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:10.170
all these powers being awakened in you, it
would be a failure. So, how to develop these

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.050
powers within us we should see.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:21.050
It's rather embarrassing for Me to tell you
how you have to behave towards your Guru.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.750
I think people have told you. But naturally,
spontaneously, as soon as you get your Realization

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.050
and grow in it, naturally you develop a very
humble attitude. Also an attitude through

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:51.310
which you achieve lots of qualities of your
Guru. Now, supposing the Guru is at a particular

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.160
height and if you try to go on to the same
height, nothing will move towards you. So

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.440
you must sit at a place which is much lower
than the Guru's is. Some people take too much

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.060
advantage of My good nature, I should say,
and so many people have pointed out to Me

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.310
that "You must correct these people, they
talk to You at equal level and all that."

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.870
I said: "They will learn a lesson, they will
learn a lesson." But sometimes, it doesn't

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.870
work out and they start talking on the same
manner as if you are talking to your friend

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.460
or to your equal.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.030
First is complete humility. You have to be
a humble person, extremely humble. Now, you

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:54.030
check on that, when you talk to others, are
you humble? When you think of others, are

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:07.480
you humble? When you look after your wife
and children, are you humble? That's a very

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:17.550
important thing for every person who thinks
he is a Guru. Humility is the first quality

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:29.300
or, I should say, the ocean into which you
must jump. Some people think that "If you

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:36.150
are humble, Mother, then people will take
advantage of you." Nobody can take advantage

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:43.060
of you, because you have to remember another
point, that you are protected all the time,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:50.060
looked after by Param Chaitanya. I know you
know that, but how many really believe that

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:55.320
there is Param Chaitanya with us?

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:02.320
If you really believe that there is Param
Chaitanya, then you don't get frightened,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.640
you don't get worried, you are not subjected
to all kinds of nonsensical ideas also. But

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:19.900
if you think that you are not protected, "What
will happen? How will things happen?" then

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:26.900
Param Chaitanya leaves you alone. You have
to see the whole drama, how Param Chaitanya

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:36.620
works out, how It works out, how you are behaving.
Supposing you are not in a proper shape and

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:54.580
you try to show off too much, then what happens?
Then, you get the reward for it. Not that

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:02.690
I do anything, but it is the Param Chaitanya
which will teach you a lesson that you will

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:09.070
remember, that you should have been little
different from what you have been. After all,

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:15.920
we have to know why have we come to Sahaja
Yoga. Begin at the root of it. We have come

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:22.920
to Sahaja Yoga because we wanted to know the
absolute truth, and this absolute truth has

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:29.950
been now known to you through your vibrations.
You know it through your vibrations, what

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.980
is the absolute truth, and you should work
everything on that line, that absolute truth,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:49.780
whatever you feel on your vibrations you have
to follow.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:55.740
Unfortunately, I have seen many people think
that their vibrations are all right, they

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:01.520
are all right and whatever they are receiving
on their vibrations is first class. Now, how

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:08.180
to correct that point is very difficult. It
comes from ego. When you have ego, you can

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:14.730
never find anything wrong with you. And even
if the vibrations are telling you something,

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.980
it might be somebody else who is telling you
something, because you are not there, your

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:25.980
ego is there and your ego is just spoiling
you and teaching you things which normally

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:34.430
you would see clearly that "I'm doing something
wrong, I should not have done it."

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:41.940
In this process of correction and improvement,
when you indulge you should see: "Are you

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:51.300
getting subtler or grosser?" That is the best
way to judge. Now, I've seen people who go

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:58.350
on judging on small things like vibrations
- whether this vibration are all right or

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:08.270
not in this tree or on this flowers or on
this land, all kinds of material things they

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:16.790
want to see the vibrations. But for what are
you seeing the vibration? You are seeing vibration

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:23.980
because some sort of material gain. You think
that if you check the vibrations and the vibrations

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:31.420
are all right, then you are quite safe, you
will not loose this, will not loose that.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:38.660
It's not true. Because vibrations are not
meant to judge all these worldly things and

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:45.660
worldly matters. It's absolutely cheapening
the vibrations. You should not cheapen them,

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:54.450
because vibrations can suggest things which
may be detrimental to your growth very much.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:12:00.770
Once, I wanted somebody to go somewhere, so
he said, "I didn't go, Mother."

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:01.589
I said, "Why?"

00:12:01.589 --> 00:12:03.920
"Because I saw the vibrations were very bad."

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:10.920
I said, "That's why I asked you to go. If
the vibrations were good, what was your use

00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:19.560
going there? That's the reason I asked you
to go there so that you could help but before

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.670
that you judged yourself, judged your vibrations
and then you didn't want to go."

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:31.670
So, what happens, we want to have a easy,
cozy life. And all our problems must be solved

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:39.710
by Sahaja Yoga, otherwise we think Sahaja
Yoga is of no use. Whatever is our desire

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:47.080
must be fulfilled. So, now the desires are
mostly personal. "My child is not well, so

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.610
the child should be all right, my husband
is misbehaving, the husband should be all

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:59.610
right" or "I have no house, I must get a house."
See how we are moving our mind, is still on

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:07.890
a very consumer society, as they call it.
We are all the time thinking, "Now I should

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:14.750
have a son, now, instead of a girl" and you
get a son and then you blame Sahaja Yoga for

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:19.710
that! Anything that according to your desire
doesn't work out, then you think it's Sahaja

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:26.710
Yoga which has done the harm and you are suffering
because of Sahaja Yoga. Or this faith in Sahaja

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:38.240
Yoga gets little moving or we can say, in
a way, it's not that deep. But if you are

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:47.920
deeply imbedded in Sahaja Yoga, then what
happens? "What may come, I will be a Sahaja

00:13:53.649 --> 00:13:55.140
Yogi."

00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:01.200
Supposing somebody dies, normally in Sahaja
Yoga it's difficult for people to die also,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.480
I must tell you. Even if they want to die,
they can't die. It's the Param Chaitanya which

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:13.600
decides for you. But supposing you take up
a position like that, still you must know

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:20.600
that that wish may not be fulfilled. If that
is not fulfilled then you feel disturbed and

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:28.260
you think, "What's wrong?" But 
your wish is not the wish of God Almighty,
while Param Chaitanya is the wish of God Almighty.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:48.630
Now for example I went to America, take it
like this, and America attacked Me. Negativity

00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:00.120
and troubled Me. For all these days I'm suffering
so-called, and I have had pain, I have had

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:09.250
all kinds of things. But that I had to do
because now the American Sahaja Yogis will

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:16.250
realize how much one has to pay to make this
dumb head of Americans to rise. How stupid

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:27.810
they are and how foolish they are who are
enamored by people who are taking money!

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:38.620
So many people came to Me and told Me, "Mother,
if You start saying that, this I can give

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:45.180
for 300 dollars, You'll get thousands and
thousands of disciples of Yours."

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:52.180
I said, "They'll not be My disciples. If they
come for money, thinking that because I'm

00:15:53.339 --> 00:16:00.339
taking money it is worthy something, that
means they are absolutely stupid!" Sahaja

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:06.050
Yoga, you cannot get it by money, this is
the first principle they don't understand,

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:13.050
most of them! Most of them don't understand
that you can get Self Realization without

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.089
paying any money.

00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:23.089
They were some Gujarati rich people in New
Jersey and they asked questions to Sahaja

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:32.890
Yogis that "How is it possible to get it so
easily? It's not possible because it's a very

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:38.029
difficult thing, all the shastras have said,
everybody has said, it's very difficult to

00:16:38.029 --> 00:16:45.029
get your Realization. All right! If so, how
is it you are giving it so easily? Why?" Nobody

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:53.930
knew how to answer to these people. You should
have said like this, "All right it is difficult,

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:59.270
very difficult and you cannot give mass, true!
But if somebody is doing it, then you have

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:03.620
to think about it, how somebody is doing it?"

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.049
So, this kind of stupid questions are there
and still if they go on, you have really to

00:17:09.049 --> 00:17:16.049
tell them in a very humble way: "Sir, one
has to be worthy also." So, they will run

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:22.249
after people who are just making money out
of them, making fool out of them. And they

00:17:22.249 --> 00:17:27.159
boast, "We have three gurus." Somebody says,
"We have seven gurus!" And I wonder what must

00:17:27.159 --> 00:17:34.159
be their condition. So the people who are
extremely stupid, in Sanskrit they call "Mudha"

00:17:35.499 --> 00:17:42.499
people who are brainless
cannot get their Realization, so give them

00:17:42.659 --> 00:17:49.659
up. If they are arguing with you, you just
give them up. It's not their right to argue

00:17:52.169 --> 00:17:57.629
with you. Their right is to get Realization
but not a right to argue with you, ask you

00:17:57.629 --> 00:18:04.629
foolish questions and stupid questions. But
you should always remember that with that

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:12.259
humility you must have your dignity intact
because you are a Guru. Once you know you

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:19.470
are a Guru, one thing should be there that
you will not behave like a joker all the time.

00:18:19.999 --> 00:18:26.999
Your behavior will be dignified. At the same
time, it will be very pleasant face or a pleasant

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:34.649
personality. It won't be annoying type. Your
personality itself will suggest that there's

00:18:34.649 --> 00:18:36.309
something special about you.

00:18:36.309 --> 00:18:43.309
Now, how do you develop that kind of a personality?
The biggest problem in the West is ego and

00:18:54.129 --> 00:19:00.539
the biggest problem in the East is superego.
Now, this ego business, I don't know from

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:07.509
where it has come. In all walk of life, they
show how egoistical they are.

00:19:07.509 --> 00:19:14.509
For example, I went to America and I was surprised
that there is a racial problem, and the blacks

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:20.759
are treated in a different manner, and the
whites in a different manner. I mean, color

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:27.379
is given by God and somebody has to be black,
and white. If everybody looked the same, it

00:19:27.379 --> 00:19:33.929
will look like a regiment. There should be
some variety, there should be some change

00:19:33.929 --> 00:19:40.929
in the face and also in the expression. One
has to be a person carrying better or different

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:53.889
expressions, otherwise you will be bored with
such a world where there is everybody looks

00:19:53.889 --> 00:20:00.889
the same, just the same. But so much of racialism
there that I was surprised that how it has

00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:05.129
worked into human mind.

00:20:05.129 --> 00:20:12.129
So, as a Guru, you must develop a complete
detest for racialism, complete detest. That's

00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:21.519
very easy to understand that anybody who has
fair complexion could be a cruelest man, cruelest

00:20:23.379 --> 00:20:30.379
woman and could be a cruelest mother also.
And the one who is black could be very kind,

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:40.399
generous. It doesn't go with the color, temperament
doesn't go with the color. But because the

00:20:41.399 --> 00:20:48.399
blacks have been ill-treated so much that
they react. And they react, naturally, in

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:55.789
sometimes in such a manner that it is very
crude and very cruel. But this kind of attention,

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:07.509
this kind of a, you can say, a wrong type
of attitude towards human beings, even towards

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:15.059
animals they won't bear it. So towards human
beings to have such an attitude itself shows

00:21:15.059 --> 00:21:22.059
that you are not worthy of Sahaja Yoga at
all. So anyone of you who has such a feeling

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:31.409
that somebody is black and somebody is white
cannot be a guru in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:43.779
Then in India we have caste system, equally
bad and horrible. It has no sense in it, no

00:21:44.869 --> 00:21:51.639
basis whatsoever, but in India we have people
who believe that some castes are higher and

00:21:51.639 --> 00:21:58.629
some castes are lower. Every caste people
can do all the worst possible things, there

00:21:58.629 --> 00:22:05.629
is no demarcation for them and every low caste
can be very, very good. We have had many great

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:16.460
poets and Sufis in the lowest castes in India.
This castes are man-made. You know man-made

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:23.929
cloth doesn't suit us, and all these man-made
ideas are not going to suit us and it will

00:22:23.929 --> 00:22:30.929
lead us into a great - I wouldn't know discretion
- but I would say to a complete destruction,

00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:44.619
because hatred begets hatred and it goes on
increasing and increasing. If you cannot get

00:22:44.619 --> 00:22:50.980
rid of your hatred, then, I would say you
are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:57.980
These are all conditionings. You were born
in a white family, so you are white, you were

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.820
born in a Christian family that's why you
are Christian, you were born in a Jew family,

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:11.820
that's why you are a Jew. All this is just
because you were born in that. But does that

00:23:12.519 --> 00:23:19.350
mean that you are higher or lower? All the
problems of the world today, if you see, are

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:26.350
because of human attachment to nonsensical
ideas of superiority. Only through collective

00:23:27.789 --> 00:23:34.789
living will change. For example, I would say,
in an ashram, we should have all colored people

00:23:39.019 --> 00:23:46.019
living together with the equal rights, with
the equal understanding and love and affection.

00:23:47.399 --> 00:23:54.399
If that is not there, no use calling it an
ashram.

00:23:58.239 --> 00:24:05.239
Once, they asked Me, "Mother, will You come
and give a lecture in Harlem?"

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.019
I said, "Why not?"

00:24:10.019 --> 00:24:14.129
So some Sahaja Yogis said, "Harlem? Mother,
do You know what is Harlem?"

00:24:14.129 --> 00:24:16.399
I said, "I know. There's no harm."

00:24:16.399 --> 00:24:19.479
They said, "You know the blacks are there
and..."

00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:26.479
I said, "I'm also black." You could call Me
black or you can call Me white, but the love

00:24:28.399 --> 00:24:35.399
is such a thing, you see, love is such a thing
that cleanses all these ridiculous ideas we

00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:43.029
have about other people. To brand anyone as
black and white shows that you have no eyes

00:24:44.489 --> 00:24:51.489
to see. Any person with depth, any person
with loving heart cannot see these superficial

00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:58.869
things, cannot see!

00:24:58.869 --> 00:25:05.869
Today is a day where we are celebrating the
Guru's greatness. Now, look at all the Gurus,

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:17.320
how they were, how they behaved. We have many
in India and many others many Sufis in other

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:31.850
countries. These Sufis or these saints that
we had never believed in any caste system,

00:25:33.019 --> 00:25:40.019
never believed in black and white. Christ,
He never believed in black and white. Buddha

00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:48.529
never believed in black and white. Nobody
believed in any kind of man-made ideas.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:59.470
These are all man-made ideas which we have
accepted and, even after Realization, which

00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:08.539
I have to carry all the time. Now, by saying,
we do not get rid of it, but acting we can.

00:26:14.659 --> 00:26:21.659
Just see how we work out these stupid ideas
within us and how we can get rid of them.

00:26:24.259 --> 00:26:31.259
Very simple is in meditation you should sit
down and see how many people you love and

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:42.119
why do you love, not out of pity, but just
with love, how much you care for others. I've

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:52.820
seen some very beautiful examples of that,
but still I must say that there are certain

00:26:53.059 --> 00:27:00.059
fixed ideas which are to be dislodged completely,
very important for every person who is a Guru

00:27:02.169 --> 00:27:09.169
in Sahaja Yoga. Means he has to be a clean-hearted,
open-hearted, loving-hearted fellow. His heart

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:18.100
should play the tune of Param Chaitanya. If
his heart is full of all these man-made ideas,

00:27:20.289 --> 00:27:27.289
I don't know what will happen. Even when they
transplant the heart, they cannot do it with

00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:34.729
a man-made, they have to use a real, natural
one. So you can imagine when you try to take

00:27:34.729 --> 00:27:41.729
to all these odd ideas, are just divisive,
they will never give you collectivity.

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:54.299
So, introspection has to be made. Are we one,
or we are judging each other? Now, the judgment

00:28:03.229 --> 00:28:10.229
is quite a lot also. Now, all this can be
seen only when you live together, otherwise

00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:18.669
how will you know? When you start living together,
you discover, start discovering what is missing

00:28:23.559 --> 00:28:30.559
in you, what is not there, what has to be
there. It is so peaceful to have a heart which

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:40.580
is full of love because every movement of
that heart is so much joy giving, so much

00:28:45.299 --> 00:28:47.149
joy giving.

00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:54.149
There's a story of Shri Rama, that He ate
the bers, a kind of fruit, which were first

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:06.450
tasted by an old lady with such love. Shows
what? Shows that a person like Shri Ram Who

00:29:09.809 --> 00:29:16.809
was the King of the highest heritage and this
old lady who was just of the lowest caste

00:29:18.639 --> 00:29:25.639
gives Him these fruits with such love, and
when He eats that, He starts praising it.

00:29:26.249 --> 00:29:29.139
So His wife says, "Give me some!"

00:29:29.139 --> 00:29:35.720
He says, "All right," but the brother is still
half way, I think, in Sahaja Yoga, so he doesn't

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.690
like, he doesn't like, he gets angry.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:44.769
Then She eats and She says, "Brother-in-law,
it's wonderful fruit, I must say!"

00:29:44.769 --> 00:29:46.269
He says, "All right, give me some."

00:29:46.269 --> 00:29:51.879
She says, "Why should I give you now? First
you were a very much angry, so why should

00:29:51.879 --> 00:29:54.239
I give you these fruits to eat?"

00:29:54.239 --> 00:30:01.239
The story shows that the level of your personality
as Guru is judged by your clean heart, by

00:30:04.979 --> 00:30:11.979
your loving heart, by your highest, remarkable
personality. In the personality it is not

00:30:18.029 --> 00:30:25.029
something that is to be built-in artificially.
It is not artificial; it is natural, absolutely

00:30:27.229 --> 00:30:34.229
natural. Whatever you do has to be natural.
So, this artificiality of certain ways of

00:30:36.429 --> 00:30:43.429
talking or certain ways of living together
creates problem. For example, we had a ashram

00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:53.309
in America, in New York, and there was a lady
who was very strict, everything should be

00:30:53.379 --> 00:31:00.269
tip-top, it should be here, the spoons must
be there and the forks should be here, and

00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:07.269
all sort of things and she hurt many people.
Not important. These cultural, what you can

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:16.820
call it, the taboos are not important in Sahaja
Yoga, because now, you have become a Guru.

00:31:17.659 --> 00:31:24.659
Guru can stay anywhere, live anywhere, eat
anything, any time. That should be the case.

00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:31.789
But also I've seen in Sahaja Yoga, there are
many who are very anxious to eat food as soon

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:34.389
as it is served.

00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:39.849
Once it happened, I was there, they had served
the food and just they started removing the

00:31:39.849 --> 00:31:40.729
plates.

00:31:40.729 --> 00:31:47.289
I said, "What's the matter, I have to eat."

00:31:47.289 --> 00:31:49.909
"Oh! You haven't eaten, Mother?"

00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:53.389
"No, I haven't yet touched it even."

00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:59.690
So, you see, sort of, first it is the very
lowest type of, we should say, desire, is

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:05.519
the hunger. Now, a Guru doesn't bother. Whatever
you give, all right, whatever he wants not

00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:11.590
to give, all right. Even if you don't give
is all right, but one has to develop that

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:18.590
by killing your ego. People feel very hurt
if you serve them little later than another

00:32:20.249 --> 00:32:27.039
person. It's all kinds of funny things I've
seen in Sahaja Yoga. On the contrary it is

00:32:27.039 --> 00:32:34.039
the lowest type of, I should say, a desire.
You should not be very much catered to, if

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.019
you want to be a real Guru.

00:32:39.019 --> 00:32:46.019
Of course, many problems are solved, as I
have seen so far that they do not take to

00:32:50.349 --> 00:32:57.259
drugs, they do not take to drinking and all
such things. You see, it's such a blessing,

00:32:57.259 --> 00:33:03.889
because if I had to start from that level,
I don't know how deep I would have gone, from

00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:09.929
where I would have pulled you out. But that
is of course a very big thing. That is quite

00:33:09.929 --> 00:33:16.929
a nice thing but still, to make a beautiful
life out of it which will attract the attention

00:33:17.999 --> 00:33:24.999
of everyone - how you talk, how you behave,
how you love. So, again one has to say that

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:32.440
Guru Pada comes only through the love that
you have. Like they'll have, say, ten people

00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:44.029
for anything, for a drama supposing, and they
have it only from a particular country or

00:33:47.179 --> 00:33:54.179
from a particular group, then there's no fun!
There's no fun. For example they'll have a

00:33:56.979 --> 00:34:03.979
music group, so, from the particular one caste
could be or could be one religion, could be

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:11.950
one, you can say, one school or anything.
So that shows that you are still not there.

00:34:15.309 --> 00:34:22.309
As a Guru, you should like every kind of culture,
every kind of beauty and that has to be brought

00:34:27.279 --> 00:34:34.279
in, in our daily life. You should not look
down upon anyone for their color, for their

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:45.639
race, for their status, class consciousness.
All this has been shown in the lives of all

00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:53.809
these Guru saints who lived.

00:34:53.809 --> 00:34:59.880
Tukarama says, "Oh God, thank God you have
made me a schedule caste." He was not but he

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:06.880
just says so. All of us, all the time should
not be conscious of what has been our birth,

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:20.650
what has been our personality or what has
been our beginning. One should not be able

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:30.260
to make out even who is the saint and who
is not. Even people are proud that they are

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.819
saints.

00:35:35.819 --> 00:35:42.500
I was surprised in America, also, very much
that the Russians who have gone there are

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:48.920
a very different quality people. They wouldn't
raise their eyes to Me, wouldn't raise their

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:55.920
eyes and very deep, very, very deep. Vibrations
were very deep. The reason is, I think, they

00:35:56.539 --> 00:36:03.539
have been oppressed during communism, perhaps,
maybe, and now they have come to America where

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:12.480
they have seen so-called freedom and what
nonsense it is doing. So knowing these two

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:22.000
extremes, I think they have gone very deep
into their own being, and they have such strength

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:31.730
and such unity among themselves. I was surprised
that I had never met them before. They didn't

00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:45.089
come from Russia, they came, only they were
there. So, what is it that has kept them like

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:54.130
that is, that they had no religion in their
heads. They had no religion. To them, every

00:36:55.099 --> 00:37:02.099
religion is the same and they had no religion
to follow.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:10.020
So, a Guru cannot belong to any religion because
these religions are also man-made. They have

00:37:13.049 --> 00:37:20.049
created such a problem all over and they are
all fighting among themselves, how can they

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:27.720
be divine? So, you should not get involved
into some sort of a religious bias. I've seen

00:37:32.839 --> 00:37:39.839
it, that a Sahaja Yogi, say if he is a Christian,
then the bias will be shown that he is a Christian,

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.839
you can make it out. If he is a Jew, you can
make it out. So what's the use of coming to

00:37:47.839 --> 00:37:54.839
Sahaja Yoga? Their attention, if it goes inside
they'll find out. You have to dissect yourself

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:09.880
to see what's wrong with you and why is it
that you are not very successful as a Guru.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:22.990
The success of the Guru is: he doesn't bother
about time. Every time is the holy time. For

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:37.099
he's not bothered if somebody is late or has
come early. He is not a slave of watches and

00:38:38.289 --> 00:38:45.289
time. This is also man-made. There were no
watches about, I think, three hundred years

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:54.270
back and nobody was so particular about the
timing. So, first thing, he is beyond time,

00:38:56.829 --> 00:39:03.829
kalatit as they call it. Then he is also gunatit.
Gunatit means he doesn't belong to the left

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:12.119
side or to the right side or to the center.
He is beyond these three, beyond these gunas

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:20.950
where he stands and sees everything in the
Divine Light. Everything! If something good

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:29.359
happens to him, he said, "The Divine Light
has done." If something bad happens to him,

00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:35.720
he said, "The Divine light wanted this way."
Everything he leaves for the Divine Light.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.109
He is beyond the gunas.

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:43.869
Like, supposing there is a person who is on
the right side - egoistical - then he'll start

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:50.869
saying, "How is it? I wanted this, this didn't
work out and how...," he'll challenge. Another

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:57.349
will start crying, the left sided one that
"I'm very sorry this has happened to me, it

00:39:57.349 --> 00:40:04.349
should not have happened" and all that. In
the center also, he might think that "How

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:12.400
far are my vibrations, how could I not know?"
and all that. But a person who is a real Guru,

00:40:16.269 --> 00:40:23.230
he looks at it as a drama, as a, just a witness
of the drama. "It happened, it was to happen,

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:24.579
so it has happened."

00:40:24.579 --> 00:40:31.579
So, what do we get out of it? You see we get
something: the lesson that this was not right

00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:39.329
or this was wrong, that's all. For that moment,
not to go on churning in your head, that's

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:47.700
all one gets and he is not bothered about
anything else. So he goes beyond his gunas,

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:54.750
beyond gunas he lives, he eats anywhere, sleeps
anywhere, he is not bothered where he lives,

00:40:55.549 --> 00:41:02.549
he is not bothered whether he goes by car
or he goes by bullock cart, he doesn't feel

00:41:03.089 --> 00:41:10.089
he is being not honored if they give him a
garland of few flowers. It's not that. He

00:41:14.809 --> 00:41:21.809
is not bothered, because nothing can enhance
his personality - nothing! You give them something

00:41:25.569 --> 00:41:32.569
simple it's all right, or even if you don't
give, it's all right. It's not he judges himself

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:41.470
through your eyes, but he judges himself through
his own eyes and he sees for himself the joy

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:48.880
of enjoying himself. What is there to be so
particular about anything? What is so great

00:41:56.190 --> 00:42:03.190
to be hankering after anything? It just works
out in its own time and if it doesn't, it

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:08.799
doesn't. What does it matter? Just think of
it!

00:42:08.799 --> 00:42:15.799
Also, in Sahaja Yoga, a Guru has to be a binding
force. There are two types of people, I've

00:42:22.819 --> 00:42:29.819
seen, which go on breaking relations. It's
very easy for them. They go on complaining.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:42.950
But there are others who have a power to bind
people together in such a manner, in such

00:42:43.339 --> 00:42:50.339
a sweet manner that the people are brought
closer together. Not that they have to forgive,

00:42:54.309 --> 00:43:01.309
it automatically it works out. Just works
out like that and people go on joining such

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.970
a man.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:10.200
I was surprised that in America they were
very, very few Sahaja Yogis. "We spend," they

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:17.200
said, "Fifty thousand dollars and got fifty
Sahaja Yogis." One thousand for one Sahaja

00:43:19.529 --> 00:43:26.529
Yogi in America! So, very bad shape, but still,
you see we have to hope for them, because

00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:37.109
there are lots of seekers and lost in the
wilderness of seeking. But I thought that

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:46.130
maybe it's a circle. They have to pass through
this circle of stupidity and then definitely

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:54.230
they will see the point and it has happened.
We had about four thousand people for My lecture

00:43:56.589 --> 00:44:03.589
which never has happened there in that country.
"Nobody has got such a lot of audience," they

00:44:06.059 --> 00:44:13.059
said. But still, not many came but they got
their Realization.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:20.190
So, I think gradually, even in America it
may start growing. And the Sahaja Yogis must

00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:28.940
not only worry about their houses and where
they live and all that, but go all out to

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:35.119
them. I would say some of the Sahaja Yogis
who could afford to go, should go to America

00:44:35.119 --> 00:44:42.119
and work out this outside work. May be if
there are outsiders who come and talk about

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:51.130
Sahaja Yoga, they might be impressed. There
are so many false gurus that you can't count

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:59.839
them. And they have accepted them. It's very
surprising, though they have suffered, they

00:44:59.839 --> 00:45:05.539
have lost in money, everything, still they
have accepted, "After all he is our guru!"

00:45:05.539 --> 00:45:10.950
So, there is basically something wrong with
their brains that they don't understand what

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:12.589
is to be expected.

00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:19.589
I have written one book. Perhaps it may reach
them, but in any case you all can write your

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:27.680
experiences and things and can publish it.
Maybe it might help them to open their eyes.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:34.190
While writing anything, you have to remember
that it should show your quality of Sahaja

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:41.190
Yoga, how you are. In that, one should not
feel that you are putting them down or trying

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:57.349
to say some things which will hurt them, but
say it in such a manner that it corrects them

00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:58.599
and helps them.

00:45:58.599 --> 00:46:05.599
For a Guru, it is important that he should
not have any false ideas about himself. He

00:46:10.369 --> 00:46:16.579
might be from a poor family, might be from
the rich family. Whatever it is, he should

00:46:16.579 --> 00:46:23.579
not be conscious of that. Because, once you
become that ... See, look at Kabira, he was

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:31.740
just a weaver, look at Raidas, he was just
a... what you call that? Shoemaker. See, in

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.680
India these are very low castes, supposed
to be. He has written beautiful poetry. Then

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:49.680
Namadeva, he was a tailor, just think of that.
All these people have written the same thing

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:58.190
with such great beauty of poetry. How have
they achieved? Because, now they have entered

00:47:00.380 --> 00:47:03.869
into that great realm of spirituality.

00:47:03.869 --> 00:47:10.869
You people also write some very good poetry,
I know. But some of the people who have written

00:47:11.609 --> 00:47:17.650
good poetry turned out to be very obstinate,
very egoistical people. This is something

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:24.519
I couldn't understand. You are writing here
a beautiful poetry and here you are full of

00:47:24.519 --> 00:47:25.269
ego.

00:47:25.269 --> 00:47:32.269
So, from where this poetry is coming, God
knows. So, first of all is yourself, your

00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:40.809
personality has to be something that people
should say, "This is the real Guru we have

00:47:46.059 --> 00:47:53.000
met." For that, you know very well, you don't
have to give up your family, don't have to

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:00.000
give up anything. But ego, if it is still
there, I don't know what to say, but you must

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:09.630
get rid of it completely and collectively
also, ego should be driven out, collectively.

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:17.380
It's a thing that, people are egoistical secretly
within themselves but sometimes it shows,

00:48:17.609 --> 00:48:24.609
it's a very subtle nonsensical disease that
people have and they just indulge into it.

00:48:26.269 --> 00:48:33.269
On this day of Guru Puja, I have to say now
that one has to work very hard, very hard.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:43.700
The most important thing is how much you have
dedicated your life, your time to Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:53.710
Then only you will achieve that state of Guru.
Look at Me, I'm a house wife and I have my

00:48:54.740 --> 00:49:01.740
family's responsibilities, problems, but despite
that, I'm all the time thinking about Sahaja

00:49:03.799 --> 00:49:10.799
Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and all that is this emancipation
of human beings in the whole world. Not only

00:49:15.299 --> 00:49:22.299
here or there, in the whole world. So, that
should be your widened vision, not for only

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:33.319
your school, college, or university, your
this or that but a very wider vision one should

00:49:33.319 --> 00:49:40.319
have and that you have to develop through
your working into every type of circumstances,

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:53.420
every type of problems you have. Once you
develop that kind of a personality, then

00:51:00.819 --> 00:51:07.819
you'll 
be amazed how you can help so many people.
I know there are so many Sahaja Yogis here

00:53:41.049 --> 00:53:48.049
who are worthy of praise and really I love
them very much and they also love Me very

00:54:00.089 --> 00:54:07.089
much, but one should always see that, as you
are now going to be the Gurus, you have to

00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:53.490
be careful not to think that you are a Guru.
You should never think you are a guru already.

00:56:43.049 --> 00:56:50.049
Once you start thinking again Mr. Ego, the
guru, comes up.

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:05.700
So, once you decide that "I'm nothing, I'm
nothing, I'm just a little ripple in

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:43.390
the heart of my Mother." If such a humble
feeling you get, then, all your problems can

01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:41.609
be solved and things will work out. Because
your attention and your behavior is going

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:53.140
to impress other people, nothing else. Whatever
you

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:21.250
may try, it is you

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:11.590
who

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:25.920
is going to get Sahaja Yoga further.

01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:31.240
There is so much to be said about how to become

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:56.700
a good Guru and all that

01:39:56.690 --> 01:40:03.690
but

01:40:35.250 --> 01:40:42.250
I think I'll keep it for next Guru Puja.

01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:53.280
Thank you very much.
