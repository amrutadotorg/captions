1
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:10,603
So when we talk of communications first of all the
greatest thing

2
00:00:10,683 --> 00:00:14,995
is the communication between human beings

3
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:20,222
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

4
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,747
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

5
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:28,790
which is not true.

6
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:35,507
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

7
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:42,122
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

8
00:00:42,215 --> 00:00:46,382
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

9
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:54,055
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

10
00:00:54,588 --> 00:01:00,321
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

11
00:01:01,389 --> 00:01:08,241
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

12
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:12,322
that trick one has to learn:

13
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:21,112
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

14
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:25,141
This is one of His special qualities,

15
00:01:25,222 --> 00:01:31,831
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

16
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:36,035
in a very sweet manner, and

17
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:45,520
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

18
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:49,508
Now there are many tricks

19
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:56,314
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

20
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:00,274
First of all you must always show

21
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:05,484
that you are less intelligent than another person.

22
00:02:09,355 --> 00:02:12,906
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

23
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:17,208
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know.

24
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:24,345
I'm no good for a scientist." So they feel "ahhhh, very good."

25
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:37,308
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

26
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:43,644
No, I just have learned a little bit, but not much."

27
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,455
Musician feels very happy.

28
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:51,455
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

29
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:58,610
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

30
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:08,830
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

31
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:13,474
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

32
00:03:13,595 --> 00:03:20,440
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

33
00:03:22,508 --> 00:03:30,005
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

34
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:36,041
but I would like to hear" this is first.

35
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:42,041
The first quality of communication is to be
extremely humble about yourself.

36
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:46,122
The other person should not know who you are.

37
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:52,700
And there's a lot of fun in it.

38
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:59,762
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

39
00:04:00,355 --> 00:04:04,041
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

40
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:09,165
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

41
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:14,175
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

42
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:17,889
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was just a

43
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:22,306
useless, small, little place meant 
for very ordinary officers because

44
00:04:22,392 --> 00:04:27,601
they had not allotted us any house or
anything so, temporarily, we were there.

45
00:04:27,682 --> 00:04:32,077
She said "what? What is your husband doing?" I said "He's
some government servant."

46
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:41,220
I didn't tell her [his position]! He came down, 
so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

47
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:44,175
She said "do you know him?" 
I said "He's My husband".

48
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:48,255
She was shocked, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

49
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:52,174
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

50
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:54,747
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

51
00:04:54,828 --> 00:05:01,601
She had started looking down upon Me,
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

52
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:13,122
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

53
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,515
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

54
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:21,640
"Oh Mother
has given me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

55
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,772
This boastfullness is of no use.

56
00:05:24,853 --> 00:05:28,974
"I haven't got any powers you see. 
I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

57
00:05:29,055 --> 00:05:32,555
But if you want I can try."

58
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:44,815
So play down as much as you can.

59
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:48,041
Practice this at home.

60
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:51,122
First practice and then do it.

61
00:05:52,307 --> 00:05:59,297
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

62
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:04,194
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

63
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:08,464
there's one is very important thing. He says 
"krodho'bhijaayate sammohah" (Gita 2:61)].

64
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:13,174
You see among all the worst things that we have -

65
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:18,122
according to Him we have six enemies.

66
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:24,740
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'.

67
00:06:24,821 --> 00:06:28,421
He said - it starts with Krodha, means anger.

68
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:37,408
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

69
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:40,728
There's no need for a master to get angry

70
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:43,481
because he can play about.

71
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:47,074
He can make you dance like this.

72
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:50,914
What is the need to lose your temper?

73
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:56,208
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

74
00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:01,041
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

75
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:05,455
and something starts barking,

76
00:07:08,122 --> 00:07:11,668
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

77
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:18,281
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

78
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:26,174
He has started with Krodha, that: with the Krodha all problems start.

79
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:29,340
from one to another to another to another.

80
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:33,621
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

81
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:45,007
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver - Vishnu -

82
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:47,793
but is expressed through Vishuddhi.

83
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:51,525
The face becomes red, eyes become red.

84
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:57,192
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

85
00:07:57,273 --> 00:08:02,359
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

86
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,625
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

87
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:11,525
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

88
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:17,321
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

89
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:21,579
Many people I have seen people say "Mother 
you know this lady is such a hot tempered women,

90
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,177
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

91
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:30,445
But if you tell her she says, "No no, 
I don't do that way. No, no I'm very good."

92
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:37,169
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

93
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:40,798
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

94
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,660
do you get into tempers or not?

95
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:51,101
Are you loosing your temper?
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

96
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:54,182
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

97
00:08:54,273 --> 00:08:59,417
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

98
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,851
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

99
00:09:04,932 --> 00:09:13,258
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

100
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,439
There is no need to take to temper.

101
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,039
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

102
00:09:19,152 --> 00:09:20,953
Why are you doing that way?"

103
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:24,168
Now if you do something, you know, 
maybe something I might say which

104
00:09:24,249 --> 00:09:31,528
I would not like, so I don't want to say."
Like that - at the most!

105
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:35,441
Up to that point is alright; that you should
say that, "I dislike it",

106
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:38,701
but not to go further with it.

107
00:09:41,926 --> 00:09:45,726
If you just stop at a point,

108
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:52,152
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

109
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,692
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

110
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:59,392
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

111
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:03,459
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

112
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,945
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

113
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:12,926
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

114
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:18,368
you feel very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have said this."

115
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:24,988
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

116
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:29,091
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

117
00:10:29,206 --> 00:10:34,326
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

118
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:38,820
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

119
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:45,391
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

120
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:51,569
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

121
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,273
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

122
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:58,179
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

123
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:06,020
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

124
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:12,459
you'll never feel guilty.
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

125
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,120
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

126
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:19,075
Next time you won't do it.
