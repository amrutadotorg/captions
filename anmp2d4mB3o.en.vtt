00:03:49.835 --> 00:04:07.920
I want to congratulate you all for getting married in the  Sahaja system.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:14.210
We are here to establish a new culture of our married life.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:23.210
It's not the old style that we had or the new style that we were going to have.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:32.890
Actually marriages should be made very much comfortable, beautiful and enjoyable.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.770
If that cannot be done, it's better not to marry.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.010
You don't want to marry to make yourself less level and make others less level.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:48.570
So the first thing one has to remember that these girls that they are marrying are coming

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.690
from another family, from another country, from another standards.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.370
So try to understand them.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.970
One thing I have seen, if you have love for your wife, then you can solve all the problems.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.890
What a wife wants is a love, attention from the husband.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.970
If you could do that, then you are very well off to begin with.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.850
You can also find out what does she like, what she doesn't like.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:28.250
It is the oneness of character that will help.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.490
But that is only possible by understanding each other, not by forcing your culture or

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.810
her culture on her, but by observing what is Sahaja culture.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:48.570
As a husband, of course, you have a higher position in the married life because you are

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:57.330
the earning member and you are the one who has to look after the family as far as financial

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.170
side is concerned.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:08.370
But the another side is your mental side, I would say, of your mind, which has to be

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.610
managed by your wife.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:18.210
So if you torture her, if you neglect her, if you trouble her, she cannot compensate

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.450
for that.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:27.250
So first thing one has to remember that your greatest responsibility is to make this marriage

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:34.650
successful, not by dominating, not by controlling.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.650
One governs best when he doesn't control.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.370
If there is love, then you don't have to do all these things and you can easily manage

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.330
a very happy Sahaj man.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.210
I don't like the most, nor do I like the husband and wife fighting.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.490
There are certain stupid things which makes them fight also.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:06.490
Recently there were some girls who came up, of course, Westerners, and they said, Mother,

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.490
we feel he is our not husband, our brother.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:11.490
I say, what is this?

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.490
After having children from that man, living like a wife, suddenly why have you become

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.490
so mad?

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.490
You are talking like this.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:26.770
I couldn't understand what was the reason for such a stupid statement, but I told them

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:32.770
that you don't try to deceive Me, you can deceive yourself, and then they were all right.

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:42.770
So I would like to tell you that you should try to find out why your wife is upset or

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:49.770
what's going wrong with her, because she is the person who looks after your emotional

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.050
side and looks after all the emotional side.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.050
So try to understand why she is objecting to something, she doesn't like something,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:04.050
but mostly I tell them also, they will try to address much better and help you much better

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.050
if you just try to give them lots of love.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:12.050
There are many ways of expression of love.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:20.050
If she is fond of, say, some sort of speech, even if you bring that, she will be very happy.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:27.050
Try to know what she likes, try to understand what are her desires, and you will be amazed

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:34.050
how you can win her over with very small things, because she will think that you care, you

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.050
try to understand, and you know so much about her.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:44.050
This is something, is an art, I think it's an art to be a good husband, and those who

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.050
don't have that art always fail.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:53.050
Of course, some women are very tolerant and good, they can bear it up, that's not, that

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:57.050
should not be the way or be a surgeon this period.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:06.050
You should have a lot of love, understanding, and also care for your wife.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:13.050
I wish you all very great love, and I want you to show that you can be very happily married.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:20.050
Whatever may be your culture, whatever you had in the past, forget it and you become

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.050
a cultured man in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:29.050
And I would like to say very happy married life and very happy small little children.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.050
Thank you very much.

00:09:56.552 --> 00:10:04.050
I congratulate all of you for deciding to marry in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:22.050
Compared to other weddings, in Sahaja Yoga you have much greater responsibility.

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:27.050
You are married because you are Sahaja Yogini's.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:34.050
And as a Sahaja Yogini, your behavior should be very Sahaj.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:43.050
That is very important because we are having these marriages, in Sahaja Yoga, mostly to

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.050
create very beautiful families.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:53.050
You see, everywhere now in the world, families are breaking.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:01.050
And it is the responsibility of the woman to save the family so that she can save the

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.050
society.

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:11.050
She is the one who is responsible for the preservation of the society by creating children

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:20.050
who are Sahaj, who are disciplined, who are sensible, loving, affectionate.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:27.050
So the woman's job is not to go on demanding things but should give.

00:11:29.447 --> 00:11:31.947
All the time demanding, 

00:11:32.127 --> 00:11:35.657
doesn't create any good feeling.

00:11:36.432 --> 00:11:39.762
On the contrary, you must care for your husband

00:11:39.772 --> 00:11:42.272
and see whatever he needs,

00:11:42.332 --> 00:11:44.832
whit great love and attention

00:11:44.952 --> 00:11:47.522
you should giving whatever he needs

00:11:47.612 --> 00:11:50.112
whatever are the [unclear].

00:11:50.142 --> 00:11:53.252
Must respect your husband,

00:11:53.372 --> 00:11:55.072
if you don't respect him,

00:11:55.058 --> 00:11:58.552
then things want work out, you must respect him.

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:03.002
Love is alright but in love, there should be respect.

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.532
A marriage was broken like this 

00:12:05.542 --> 00:12:08.792
when the girl didn't know how to respect him. 

00:12:09.002 --> 00:12:11.182
And then the husband told me 

00:12:11.172 --> 00:12:13.462
"that Mother impossible to live with her, 

00:12:13.462 --> 00:12:16.772
she is always making fun of me for nothing at all".

00:12:16.992 --> 00:12:19.492
So, you must respect your husband

00:12:19.804 --> 00:12:21.494
and also support him.

00:12:21.944 --> 00:12:23.914
In the presence of others

00:12:27.694 --> 00:12:30.194
Anything, whatever he is doing

00:12:23.944 --> 00:12:27.584
you should not try to say things against your husband. 

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:32.834
you discuss with him, you tell him

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.660
it should not be done like this, in a beautiful manner.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.240
The relationship have be kept beautiful by the way. 

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.990
Sometimes is true, that men go out, work hard, 

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.280
come back home and there are not in a good mood. 

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.160
It is the duty of the women 

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.530
to put the man in to good mood. 

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.950
Is actually she is, she is there responsible for the peace

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.580
and joy of the family. 

00:13:00.717 --> 00:13:04.737
Your responsibility is much more than that of the husband.

00:13:04.877 --> 00:13:07.837
So first of all when you are getting married, 

00:13:07.947 --> 00:13:10.577
you must realize that it is not sacrifice.

00:13:11.233 --> 00:13:16.147
It is just your capability that you can handle a situation 

00:13:16.187 --> 00:13:18.197
whatever it may be. 

00:13:18.377 --> 00:13:22.497
One thing why you should not ask for anything for a husband.

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:28.637
But see that what he needs, because you are already a women and you are complete.

00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:30.877
You don't need anything.

00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:33.127
So you have to look after them in such

00:13:33.127 --> 00:13:37.267
a manner that they don't feel that you are trying to dominate,

00:13:37.327 --> 00:13:40.187
or you are trying to manipulate in any way.

00:13:40.317 --> 00:13:42.817
But, try to do things in such beautiful

00:13:42.927 --> 00:13:46.667
sweet manners that he like it.

00:13:46.977 --> 00:13:49.927
And to expect anything from your husband

00:13:50.017 --> 00:13:51.467
is absolutely wrong. 

00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:54.851
Your love will generating him that feeling. 

00:13:54.957 --> 00:13:56.831
Maybe one or two may not,

00:13:56.821 --> 00:14:01.331
but mostly the husband is very sensitive to a wife 

00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:03.221
who is loving and kind. 

00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:06.471
And definitely, he will look after you very well. 

00:14:06.561 --> 00:14:09.701
I'm sure your marriages will be very successful 

00:14:09.891 --> 00:14:12.581
because you are all Sahaja Yoginis and 

00:14:12.631 --> 00:14:15.131
that you will have beautiful children

00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:17.191
who will be all Sahaja Yogis. 

00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:19.781
I wish you all the blessings.
