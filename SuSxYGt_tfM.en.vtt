00:05:21.508 --> 00:05:30.898
I am really over-delighted that in France
we have so many visitors as well as French

00:05:30.898 --> 00:05:38.848
Sahaja Yogis for this Puja. That shows the
collectivity. The collectivity which attracts

00:05:38.848 --> 00:05:49.578
all of you from all over the places, and that
you try to enjoy that collectivity. But the

00:05:49.578 --> 00:06:05.428
basis of collectivity, the foundation of collectivity
is very deep. And the deep understanding can

00:06:05.428 --> 00:06:21.878
only tell you that the basis of collectivity
is detached love. Love is the only way. It's

00:06:21.878 --> 00:06:33.398
not possible to have collectivity unless and
until you have detached love. French have

00:06:33.398 --> 00:06:43.648
been good at so many types of love that they
have been talking about. And they have written

00:06:43.648 --> 00:06:50.228
books after books, novels after novels and
have created lots of romantic and unromantic

00:06:50.228 --> 00:07:03.887
and all kinds of atmospheres to talk of love.
But the pure love as we understand in Sahaja

00:07:03.887 --> 00:07:14.578
Yoga is to be now expressed by Sahaja Yogis
among themselves.

00:07:14.578 --> 00:07:31.878
After all, we are all human beings made by
one God. And that we are all Sahaja Yogis

00:07:31.878 --> 00:07:46.798
created by one Mother. So there should be
no misunderstanding between us of any kind.

00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:58.698
But we must know what sometimes makes us little
different. If we can understand the problems

00:07:58.698 --> 00:08:10.198
that we face, then it would be much easier
for us to see why our love becomes so attached

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:23.418
and not so detached. Starts becoming smaller
and smaller, then a person just starts loving

00:08:23.418 --> 00:08:39.338
oneself only. One of the main reasons that
we have this problem is because of our conditionings.

00:08:39.338 --> 00:08:47.698
We are conditioned the way that we don't know
how to love.

00:08:47.698 --> 00:08:57.498
When I see the advertisements in the West,
I don't know from where the West starts and

00:08:57.498 --> 00:09:03.328
where it ends and from where the East ends.
They talk of West and East, but I don't know

00:09:03.328 --> 00:09:12.308
which is the demarcating line. Can anybody
tell Me that? Where do we start East and West,

00:09:12.308 --> 00:09:22.748
because it's one round world, you see? (Laughter)
But somehow or other there is some line, unknown

00:09:22.748 --> 00:09:33.908
line, underlying line which creates sometimes
this East and West - two types of conditionings.

00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:49.017
So, when I see some advertisements they show
about, recently I saw, about James Bond that

00:09:49.017 --> 00:10:11.108
he is free to kill and the best film for revenge
- this is the advertisement. If revenge is

00:10:11.108 --> 00:10:21.778
the best way of fulfillment, then how can
we love someone? So, this kind of conditioning

00:10:21.778 --> 00:10:34.908
comes to us from outside. That we should not
forgive anyone, we should take the revenge.

00:10:34.908 --> 00:10:44.128
And if you do not take the revenge then you
are not worthy your name. So, if you cannot

00:10:44.128 --> 00:10:51.267
take the revenge, like a duel that they used
to have in France quite a lot between the

00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:57.838
two persons. They would take two guns and
kill each other. I mean, what a stupid idea

00:10:57.838 --> 00:11:03.168
it was! Just think of it in modern times.
But it was so.

00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:16.528
So, if the revenge is not taken then it was
thought to be something very sly, very low

00:11:16.528 --> 00:11:29.608
level. So, a person must take revenge. History
shows also the same things that one had to

00:11:29.608 --> 00:11:43.658
take a revenge of another person who has harmed
you in any way, troubled you. I think it's

00:11:43.658 --> 00:11:51.808
the quality of a snake, they say. That if
you step onto any snake, it follows you all

00:11:51.808 --> 00:12:00.138
his life to take the revenge. The only thing
that it does all its life is to run after

00:12:00.138 --> 00:12:11.808
that person who has by mistake put the foot
on its body. In the same way a human endeavor,

00:12:11.808 --> 00:12:20.198
I have seen in so many novels it's suggested
how a man gets after a person who has some

00:12:20.198 --> 00:12:35.898
way or other harmed. If we go on like this,
there's no end to it. Firstly, it is absolutely

00:12:35.898 --> 00:12:36.808
absurd.

00:12:36.808 --> 00:12:46.077
For that, I will give you an example of Buddha,
very much I have been impressed by the way

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:53.017
He said once to somebody who insulted Him
and abused Him and said all kinds of horrible

00:12:53.017 --> 00:13:02.528
words. Then Buddha went to another village.
Now, this fellow felt the remorse and he went

00:13:02.528 --> 00:13:09.808
back, and back, and said, "Sir, I'm sorry.
I have said these things to you. I'm really

00:13:09.808 --> 00:13:19.178
very sorry." He said, "What? When?" He said,
"Yesterday." He said, "Yesterday is finished

00:13:19.178 --> 00:13:28.948
now. You are now with Me today. So, why are
you talking about yesterday? It's finished."

00:13:28.948 --> 00:13:36.517
So, with this kind of idea that somebody has
harmed us, somebody is horrid to us we linger

00:13:36.517 --> 00:13:40.868
on in the past.

00:13:40.868 --> 00:13:57.828
Now, I'm told they are celebrating the French
Revolution that took place. If you ask Me

00:13:57.828 --> 00:14:03.708
there was no need to have revolution of that
kind to kill Marie Antoinette. It was not

00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:11.328
necessary. If they had killed or not killed,
it would have been all right. But they had

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:21.678
to kill her. Why? Because according to them
she spent lot of money in Versailles and created

00:14:21.678 --> 00:14:27.128
some beautiful furniture. Today only they
are showing that furniture only. What is there

00:14:27.128 --> 00:14:35.198
to show in this France? As soon as you come,
they say, "Have you seen her palace?" I said,

00:14:35.198 --> 00:14:35.768
"Really?"

00:14:35.768 --> 00:14:42.448
First time when I came to France, this was
the first question. "You must go and see this.

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:47.418
Impossible, you cannot get such beautiful
things anywhere created. It's an impossible

00:14:47.418 --> 00:14:52.758
situation." I said, "Impossible?" "Yes, because
you cannot make such nice things."

00:14:52.758 --> 00:14:59.738
She made such nice beautiful things. She was
not going to carry it with her. Now, when

00:14:59.738 --> 00:15:11.008
you murdered her, then you ask Me to go and
see those beautiful things. We have to learn

00:15:11.008 --> 00:15:17.018
from history that it was stupid to kill her.
What was the need to kill her? When you have

00:15:17.018 --> 00:15:23.458
taken over the government, all right, stop
at that point and then you start governing.

00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:29.958
With that revolution you think world has improved
for us? Anywhere in the world, do you think

00:15:29.958 --> 00:15:45.418
things have improved? Also, the
revolution should have been to change the
government. All right! But to go to that limit

00:15:45.418 --> 00:15:46.978
was not necessary.

00:15:46.978 --> 00:15:55.018
So, the second conditioning that comes to
us that we cross all limits of humanity when

00:15:55.018 --> 00:16:01.138
we take revenge. They would not have been
satisfied that she was still living. "Oh God,

00:16:01.138 --> 00:16:13.708
we have to kill her!" Of course, I don't say
that somebody who has done any harm to the

00:16:13.708 --> 00:16:24.348
country, to the nation, should be allowed
to go on like that. But how far you go with

00:16:24.348 --> 00:16:33.248
that is to be seen. So, the wisdom of Sahaja
Yoga is in understanding the limitations up

00:16:33.248 --> 00:16:43.148
to which you can go to express your anger,
to express your revenge, so called, on anyone

00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:56.087
whatsoever. But the best thing would be to
leave it to the Divine power, because everything

00:16:56.087 --> 00:17:05.337
is done by Divine power. We all exist inside
the Divine power. We cannot think of anything

00:17:05.337 --> 00:17:13.688
else of that kind. I cannot give you an analogy
how Divine power works. For example, if there

00:17:13.688 --> 00:17:25.568
were no rays of the sun coming out of the
sun, staying inside the sun, and all things

00:17:25.568 --> 00:17:35.777
working out, then we would have said, "It's
something like Divine power." Nothing is outside

00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:44.938
that, everything is inside. And this Divine
power is the power of compassion and love,

00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:55.488
which does everything. But when we take up
responsibility, and when we decide we have

00:17:55.488 --> 00:18:06.168
to do something, and that we are something,
and try to go against that Divine power, we

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:15.828
become stupid people as we have seen. So,
to leave it in the hands of Divine power,

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:26.328
and to be just an instrument of that Divine
power is the way a Sahaja Yogi has to be.

00:18:26.328 --> 00:18:36.688
Because the compassion, the love of Divine
power is so great that it is wisdom, complete

00:18:36.688 --> 00:18:46.618
wisdom. A person who has no compassion cannot
be wise. He could be worldly wise but he could

00:18:46.618 --> 00:19:01.418
not be really wise. So, those who believe
that they have to be - they have to be very

00:19:01.418 --> 00:19:19.788
accurate must know that your accuracy will
be challenged by the Divine power. There has

00:19:19.788 --> 00:19:32.308
to be lot of relaxed and a mobile temperament
a person should have.

00:19:32.308 --> 00:19:40.918
For example, now I have come, suddenly perhaps
you were not told, people were not ready absolutely

00:19:40.918 --> 00:19:52.858
in the formal manner, lined up together like
a military. It's all right, makes no difference.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:20:03.837
Makes no difference. I am in no way disturbed,
no way unhappy. I was very happy to see you

00:20:03.837 --> 00:20:12.878
all. Because after all, you all love Me and
I love you. It's a family and there's nothing

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:21.688
like being very formal about things. No formality
between you and God Almighty, there cannot

00:20:21.688 --> 00:20:38.428
be. But there has to be understanding as to
what we are doing. I find suddenly human beings

00:20:38.428 --> 00:20:54.657
either become extremely relaxed, extremely
lazy, extremely confused.

00:20:54.657 --> 00:21:04.467
You ask them their name, they'll say ten times,
"Ah ... Ah". I said, "What's your name?" They

00:21:04.467 --> 00:21:18.318
will say, "Ah ...". "I just asked your name."
"What You asked me, my name?" "Yes, your name."

00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:20.508
"Ah, I see." (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

00:21:20.508 --> 00:21:27.707
So the - I mean, least bothered as to even
remember your own name or to say it. Like

00:21:27.707 --> 00:21:37.517
a drug acting on that person. That's going
too far. Another style is where too much of

00:21:37.517 --> 00:21:48.707
formalities. That, supposing now, Mother is
coming and we have to give Her something,

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:57.698
and something is missing. All right, doesn't
matter. After all, this is Paris. Lots of

00:21:57.698 --> 00:22:02.837
things were missing once upon a time. If there
is something missing, doesn't matter. It's

00:22:02.837 --> 00:22:11.198
not so important, you should not be in tension.
If you are in tension you cannot absorb My

00:22:11.198 --> 00:22:14.628
vibrations. Or if you are lethargic also you
cannot absorb My vibrations. So, you have

00:22:14.628 --> 00:22:27.158
to be in the center. Center, in a receptive
mood like a child is that you have to absorb

00:22:27.158 --> 00:22:43.538
the vibrations with that feeling of expectation
and joy. We have to receive Mother. But not

00:22:43.538 --> 00:22:49.218
with tension that, "This is not done, that
is not done." I see each and every thing so

00:22:49.218 --> 00:22:59.598
beautifully done. So beautiful are these flowers,
everything done so well!

00:22:59.598 --> 00:23:08.898
And so many ideas. I can see them so clearly.
It's all expressive of not your tension but

00:23:08.898 --> 00:23:23.187
your love. So, are we expressing our love
or our tension? What is that we are doing?

00:23:23.187 --> 00:23:34.068
Are we trying to be tense because we are over-alert,
or we are trying to neglect everything because

00:23:34.068 --> 00:23:49.807
we want to escape? Between the two lies Sahaja
Yoga. You are very anxious, very much waiting.

00:23:49.807 --> 00:23:59.898
You want to do something with your heart and
then, when there is fulfillment, you can enjoy.

00:23:59.898 --> 00:24:08.358
But you are tense, I come in, what I find
you all have headaches. So, first I have to

00:24:08.358 --> 00:24:15.238
tell you, "Remove your headaches first, then
I'll talk to you." So, it has to be a very

00:24:15.238 --> 00:24:23.248
relaxed rapport between us, but relaxed never
means lethargic. It doesn't mean, if you are

00:24:23.248 --> 00:24:31.578
lethargic you'll be sleeping off and nothing
will go onto your ears.

00:24:31.578 --> 00:24:41.588
So, what we see that our conditioning, one
conditioning we have that either we want people

00:24:41.588 --> 00:24:49.778
to be over-alert or we want that they should
not be at all alert. So, the underlying problem

00:24:49.778 --> 00:25:03.547
of all these things is this - that we want
extremes. In our conditionings we go to extremes.

00:25:03.547 --> 00:25:19.807
We go to extremes of this or extremes of that.
If you are absolutely lethargic, lenient,

00:25:19.807 --> 00:25:31.788
disheveled, we can say absolutely confused,
you are not in the center. And on the contrary,

00:25:31.788 --> 00:25:47.898
if you are very strict, like a Rock of Gibraltar
and after all like a big Hitler-like behavior

00:25:47.898 --> 00:25:55.838
-"You should be in time, everybody must have
proper steps, must walk properly." That's

00:25:55.838 --> 00:25:59.288
not being Sahaj. That's not being Sahaj.

00:25:59.288 --> 00:26:09.598
Now, look at these flowers. See one by one
how beautiful they are. Everyone is different,

00:26:09.598 --> 00:26:16.908
even one leaf of one flower will not match
with another. One petal won't match with another.

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:28.528
They're all different, but so relaxed, creating
beauty, giving us so much of joy. All different.

00:26:28.528 --> 00:26:36.638
Placed in different manner, moving in different
manner. Everyone has a different angle. But

00:26:36.638 --> 00:26:48.248
there is unison. There is oneness in them
that they all want to give us joy. But with

00:26:48.248 --> 00:26:54.318
tension you cannot give joy. I mean if there
is somebody tense, I think I better run away

00:26:54.318 --> 00:27:00.398
from that person. God knows if he is tense,
if the tension increases he might beat you.

00:27:00.398 --> 00:27:08.778
(Shri Mataji laughing) Or might throw you
out, or might himself be hurt. So, the tension

00:27:08.778 --> 00:27:19.937
part of it is very common in the West and
that conditioning has come because of certain

00:27:19.937 --> 00:27:23.098
lifestyles that we have had.

00:27:23.098 --> 00:27:32.598
Now, there's not going to be a war of Waterloo
anymore. So, we can say that Waterloo war

00:27:32.598 --> 00:27:41.177
was won because they reached in time. That's
not the thing. The war was won because it

00:27:41.177 --> 00:27:46.828
was to be won by the Divine power. Even if
they had reached late, they would have won

00:27:46.828 --> 00:27:58.437
it. Whatever happens is by the Divine power.
So, there is no need to be tense. Then you

00:27:58.437 --> 00:28:03.547
will say, "All right. Then, let us sit down
and have a nice time. Everything will be done

00:28:03.547 --> 00:28:12.797
by the Divine power." No! Divine power is
going to work through your institutions, through

00:28:12.797 --> 00:28:19.988
your medium. So, you have to be alert.

00:28:19.988 --> 00:28:28.547
I hope you understand what I am trying to
say - that a person who is relaxed need not

00:28:28.547 --> 00:28:46.258
be a person who is lethargic, but alert. Alert
you can be as well as you can be relaxed because

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:52.677
you are Sahaja Yogis. You are not like other
people. Other people, you take the name of

00:28:52.677 --> 00:28:58.038
the airport and I don't know what goes wrong
in their brains. Suddenly, they go off. They

00:28:58.038 --> 00:29:11.258
are off their heads, they go mad. Like today,
we were going to the airport. Thank God everything

00:29:11.258 --> 00:29:18.078
- nobody was on the road. "They must be having
these hangovers", I said, "last night. And

00:29:18.078 --> 00:29:26.358
today that the streets were all right." I
said, "Let's go easily. After all, there is

00:29:26.358 --> 00:29:27.648
no program."

00:29:27.648 --> 00:29:34.708
At home everybody was thinking I'll be late.
I said, "I am not going to be late." We reached

00:29:34.708 --> 00:29:41.478
there. There was a big queue. And nobody could
get into the plane because there was such

00:29:41.478 --> 00:29:52.057
a big queue. Nobody could even book the seat.
So, what was the need to be tense? And supposing

00:29:52.057 --> 00:30:02.528
you are tense, take a position. And then you
do not get the plane. So what? At the most

00:30:02.528 --> 00:30:10.108
only there is one mishappening, which is going
to take place, is our death. That is inevitable.

00:30:10.108 --> 00:30:19.888
Because we are born, so this body has to die.
That's all! The rest of it is just a joke.

00:30:19.888 --> 00:30:28.088
So, even if you are tense or not tense makes
no difference. I think sometimes people stand

00:30:28.088 --> 00:30:33.718
at the same point and start running thinking
they are going to the airport. (Laughter)

00:30:33.718 --> 00:30:42.287
No movement - tense. So, first of all we have
to know that if we can reduce our tensions,

00:30:42.287 --> 00:30:51.718
heart will open. Heart has to open. After
all, we are now in the ocean of joy and bliss.

00:30:51.718 --> 00:31:06.818
Why should we have any tension? But when we
are in the ocean of joy and bliss, we are

00:31:06.818 --> 00:31:18.398
not drowning. We are swimming, so we have
to swim. And this part, I think is not understood

00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:19.998
by many people.

00:31:19.998 --> 00:31:27.028
Now, we have conditionings of countries, of
different, different styles. Every country

00:31:27.028 --> 00:31:40.068
has different styles of conditionings. Let's
think of France has got conditionings that

00:31:40.068 --> 00:31:46.278
you should never look happy. (Laughter) You
can make out a French man. A French lady sitting

00:31:46.278 --> 00:31:53.228
in front of Me, she was looking so miserable,
I was about to ask, "Who has died in your

00:31:53.228 --> 00:32:03.908
family?" (Laughter) She was well dressed.
She had made all make-up, hairstyle, everything

00:32:03.908 --> 00:32:11.368
fine she must have been. But her face was
so miserable that I didn't understand how

00:32:11.368 --> 00:32:17.088
these two things combine. She has taken good
care to look, appear very nice with her paints

00:32:17.088 --> 00:32:27.498
and all that, and here she is looking so miserable.
She's put up a show that she was very miserable.

00:32:27.498 --> 00:32:37.687
Now, the conditioning is so stupid, so stupid
that according to them whatever is ugly has

00:32:37.687 --> 00:32:44.378
become beautiful. The ugliest of ugly women
they'll choose and give her the first prize

00:32:44.378 --> 00:32:52.388
as the beautiest. I don't know for what, which
angle they saw this lady that they called

00:32:52.388 --> 00:33:00.148
her beauty. You'll find the lady is caught
up, she is bhootish, giving horrible vibrations

00:33:00.148 --> 00:33:04.318
and they say, "She is beauty."

00:33:04.318 --> 00:33:12.758
So, because of this tensed oblique visions
that we have either this way or this way,

00:33:12.758 --> 00:33:26.098
we never see the reality. And, what we accept
is absolutely whatever is unreal and worry

00:33:26.098 --> 00:33:36.508
about it. It's like a bubble. We are worried
about a bubble, as if it's an atomic bomb

00:33:36.508 --> 00:33:47.018
or hydrogen bomb. So, unimportant things we
worry so much. As a result of that, when we

00:33:47.018 --> 00:33:55.828
worry, worry, worry, anybody who comes near
us, we jump on that person. What are you worried

00:33:55.828 --> 00:34:06.057
about? What's the problem? I tell you the
only worry I have, if I have any, is this:

00:34:06.057 --> 00:34:22.198
that My children should love each other. So,
I talk of friendship - is to have a friend.

00:34:22.198 --> 00:34:30.118
If we have worries, we always tell to our
friends but not to persons of acquaintance.

00:34:30.118 --> 00:34:36.218
If you have problems, we'll never tell it
to somebody who we just know by-the-way, but

00:34:36.218 --> 00:34:44.787
to our friends, and so friendship. Even if
you are a leader, you are a friend of the

00:34:44.787 --> 00:34:46.208
people.

00:34:46.208 --> 00:35:01.218
Friendship is such that you could share your
secrets, you could share your problems. You

00:35:01.218 --> 00:35:11.348
do that with Me. And why not with each other?
It's a question of understanding that Sahaja

00:35:11.348 --> 00:35:18.118
Yogis are all really friends to each other.
I think relationship of friendship is even

00:35:18.118 --> 00:35:23.687
higher than any other relationship we could
think of, because there is nothing to be gained

00:35:23.687 --> 00:35:32.937
out of our friendship. It never ceases and
you just enjoy the friendship, that's all.

00:35:32.937 --> 00:35:41.547
Then you can pull each other's legs, sometimes.
You could be little joking with another person,

00:35:41.547 --> 00:35:52.018
making fun of another person. It's all right,
it's friendship. But this is the purest form

00:35:52.018 --> 00:36:07.407
of understanding our relationships with each
other. And a friend is the one who is always,

00:36:07.407 --> 00:36:15.037
for no rhyme and reason, concerned about his
friend. Before Sahaja Yoga, you could have

00:36:15.037 --> 00:36:25.768
only one friend or at the most two. Three
meant a crowd, cannot have three persons as

00:36:25.768 --> 00:36:35.718
your friends. But in Sahaja Yoga we are all
friends, pure friendship. Friendship of a

00:36:35.718 --> 00:36:49.518
very beautiful nature - that you enjoy the
joy of another person. In vibrations you do.

00:36:49.518 --> 00:37:00.307
If you feel the vibrations of another Sahaja
Yogi, you really enjoy.

00:37:00.307 --> 00:37:09.698
I have seen this kind of friendship when we
were young because that time people were more

00:37:09.698 --> 00:37:20.118
open hearted as my father had his friends.
He was a very orthodox Brahmin, a friend of

00:37:20.118 --> 00:37:30.398
his and he was the chairman of an organization
all over the country. And the school that,

00:37:30.398 --> 00:37:37.047
one of the schools where I was studying, that
organization was running. So, he was the big

00:37:37.047 --> 00:37:45.978
boss in that school. So, My father had to
go for a case far away and he took all his

00:37:45.978 --> 00:37:53.148
family and he sent Me to the hostel. He wrote
to his friend that, "I'm going away and my

00:37:53.148 --> 00:37:59.657
daughter has to appear for her final exams.
But I'm sorry I had to go, taking my family

00:37:59.657 --> 00:38:01.588
with me. But this is a nice chance."

00:38:01.588 --> 00:38:07.238
So, the friend wrote, "All right, doesn't
matter. You can go away. I'm going to look

00:38:07.238 --> 00:38:09.078
after your daughter."

00:38:09.078 --> 00:38:15.427
He came down and he stayed in the hostel.
Took a room there in the hostel. We all were

00:38:15.427 --> 00:38:20.818
there. He was a Brahmin, he would not touch
an egg. He was a Brahmin. But he knew that

00:38:20.818 --> 00:38:30.448
I eat eggs and I am a non-veg. So, this was
about summertime had started. But he would

00:38:30.448 --> 00:38:38.318
still put on his overcoat or a raincoat and
walk out. I don't know from where he used

00:38:38.318 --> 00:38:46.008
to get eggs in the morning, bring it in his
room because it was a Brahmin school, and

00:38:46.008 --> 00:38:54.088
secretly cook the eggs for Me, and then he
would call Me, and give Me the eggs to eat.

00:38:54.088 --> 00:38:57.687
I said, "I don't need them." "No, no, no you
have to have. You know, Your father has gone

00:38:57.687 --> 00:38:59.508
away, I have to look after You."

00:38:59.508 --> 00:39:05.108
So sweetly! And he was the head of heads there,
breaking his own rules and regulations for

00:39:05.108 --> 00:39:10.568
Me that he was making non-veg food. (Shri
Mataji laughing) And then he would take all

00:39:10.568 --> 00:39:21.598
the, see, shells of the eggs in a paper, put
it in the pocket in a big overcoat, walked

00:39:21.598 --> 00:39:30.497
out and throw them somewhere. Then he would
come with Me to leave Me for My exams. Evening

00:39:30.497 --> 00:39:38.627
again, he was there, waiting for Me. He was
such a big man, such a great man, very much

00:39:38.627 --> 00:39:43.967
respected. I mean, he was the head of the
heads.

00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:55.027
And everyday I was very much surprised at
this friendship. And nothing - I mean, I didn't

00:39:55.027 --> 00:40:06.677
see them talking about anything or I mean,
they had nothing in common as such. Was just

00:40:06.677 --> 00:40:12.877
friendship! My father was a literary person,
as you know, and this one was a social worker.

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:21.997
I mean there was, My father was busy with
politics. And such friends I have seen, My

00:40:21.997 --> 00:40:28.818
father would go to jail, so his friends would
come and take us away to their houses and

00:40:28.818 --> 00:40:32.508
their wives will look after us, give us bath.
No difference. I never felt any difference

00:40:32.508 --> 00:40:38.518
between their children and Me. Moreover, we
felt that they were looking after us more

00:40:38.518 --> 00:40:44.197
than their own children. First they will give
us bath.

00:40:44.197 --> 00:40:54.508
In friendship one can really enjoy! You need
a very large heart to be a friend, very large

00:40:54.508 --> 00:41:00.887
heart. If you look after your own child, support
your own child then you are a gone case for

00:41:00.887 --> 00:41:08.417
Sahaja Yoga, but if you have that kind of
a largeness of friendship.

00:41:08.417 --> 00:41:16.048
There is a nice story My father used to tell
us about friends because My brother was, had

00:41:16.048 --> 00:41:24.687
lots of friends, they used to go about gallivanting,
this, that. And then used to always criticize

00:41:24.687 --> 00:41:30.997
that what father your friends come in. They
just look after your lawn sometimes because

00:41:30.997 --> 00:41:37.177
somebody is fond of lawn. Then another does
that. And you don't people discuss, argue

00:41:37.177 --> 00:41:40.617
anything - just, I don't know how you enjoy
each other's company.

00:41:40.617 --> 00:41:47.847
He said, "No, we talk, it's not that. No,
no, we enjoy very much." So, My father told

00:41:47.847 --> 00:41:50.367
him, "All right, I will tell you a story".

00:41:50.367 --> 00:41:57.937
That there was a father who had a friend and
the son had a friend. Modern times, I mean

00:41:57.937 --> 00:42:07.147
modern these days is also old times, I should
say. So, the father said to the son that,

00:42:07.147 --> 00:42:15.647
"You see, friendship is where you can always
rely on your friend and your friend can rely

00:42:15.647 --> 00:42:20.018
on you."

00:42:20.018 --> 00:42:30.707
He said, "Really?" "Yes", he said so. "Oh,
my friends I can rely", the boy said, "I can

00:42:30.707 --> 00:42:35.167
rely on my friends". He said "Really?" "Yes."

00:42:35.167 --> 00:42:42.137
So, father said, "All right, let's test your
friends and my friends."

00:42:42.137 --> 00:42:50.967
So, they went down, they asked. The father
went with the son, and went to these friends

00:42:50.967 --> 00:42:59.957
of the son. And the son thought - he told
the son that, "You have to say that I have

00:42:59.957 --> 00:43:06.058
murdered someone and help me." He said, "All
right".

00:43:06.058 --> 00:43:14.997
So, they went to one friend. That friend said,
"You murdered? Baba, you get out!" He closed

00:43:14.997 --> 00:43:19.758
the door. Another one they went to, he closed
the door. Third one he said, "No, no don't

00:43:19.758 --> 00:43:24.857
say that you have come to my house. I have
nothing to do with you." All his twenty friends

00:43:24.857 --> 00:43:25.487
said, "No".

00:43:25.487 --> 00:43:31.558
He said, "All right, now let me go to one
friend of mine." They went there. So, they

00:43:31.558 --> 00:43:36.308
knocked at the door, knocked at the door.
Door would not open. Then he shouted, "I am

00:43:36.308 --> 00:43:40.857
here." So, the boy started saying, "Look at
this. Your friend is not even coming." He

00:43:40.857 --> 00:43:42.798
said, "No, no, no, just wait and see."

00:43:42.798 --> 00:43:49.417
So, about ten minutes later the friend came
and opened the door, and took him inside.

00:43:49.417 --> 00:43:50.578
"What's the matter?"

00:43:50.578 --> 00:43:56.157
He said, "You know I have murdered somebody"
- the father said - "and so we have come to

00:43:56.157 --> 00:43:57.687
you for help".

00:43:57.687 --> 00:44:06.268
"I knew something must be there because why
will you come at this hour? So, I was collecting

00:44:06.268 --> 00:44:11.568
all the ornaments of my wife. I mean, if you
need money, I better give you the ornaments.

00:44:11.568 --> 00:44:13.258
So, that's why I was late."

00:44:13.258 --> 00:44:19.217
"But", he said, "if you have murdered, it
doesn't matter. Now, you've got children,

00:44:19.217 --> 00:44:24.038
I don't have. So, you better tell them I have
murdered. Tell me how the murder took place,

00:44:24.038 --> 00:44:31.828
I'll take the murder upon myself." And the
son was surprised. He said, "No, take this."

00:44:31.828 --> 00:44:38.018
Then the father said, "See now, this is my
friend. You had twenty friends and I have

00:44:38.018 --> 00:44:41.457
only one friend. This is his friendship."

00:44:41.457 --> 00:44:46.607
And this kind of a friendship, we Sahaja Yogis
should have. I mean with a friend you cannot

00:44:46.607 --> 00:44:54.377
be tense. Cannot be. That is first sign. And
with your friend sitting there, you won't

00:44:54.377 --> 00:44:58.768
doze off, and you won't sleep. But you enjoy.

00:44:58.768 --> 00:45:09.367
Once I was traveling by train and we had two
compartments. So, in one compartment myself

00:45:09.367 --> 00:45:16.447
and one old lady were there. I mean, I was
older than her but she though she was older.

00:45:16.447 --> 00:45:24.778
And she was trying to sleep. And in the other
compartment were two friends. They had met.

00:45:24.778 --> 00:45:30.117
Ahh! So they were enjoying. He was hitting
him and he was hitting him. He said, "Aye,

00:45:30.117 --> 00:45:31.258
you!" And like that going on.

00:45:31.258 --> 00:45:36.068
So, this lady said, "Look at these people.
They are not allowing us to sleep." So she

00:45:36.068 --> 00:45:41.477
went and shouted at them, "Will you stop this
nonsense? What is going on?"

00:45:41.477 --> 00:45:43.487
He said, "We have met after a long time, you
see, so, we are enjoying."

00:45:43.487 --> 00:45:48.528
She said, "This is not the way. Why are you
hitting each other if you are enjoying? And

00:45:48.528 --> 00:45:50.227
don't talk loudly." She went away.

00:45:50.227 --> 00:45:54.747
Then I went and said, "Now, you shout. I am
here. Don't say anything. I'll lock the door.

00:45:54.747 --> 00:45:59.217
This lady won't come." They were surprised.
I said, "I am enjoying the way you are enjoying

00:45:59.217 --> 00:46:04.187
each other." They said, "You don't want to
sleep?" "No, no, I want to hear what you say

00:46:04.187 --> 00:46:08.837
to each other." And they were surprised how
I was enjoying the way they were hitting each

00:46:08.837 --> 00:46:12.077
other and enjoying each other.

00:46:12.077 --> 00:46:21.367
So, this is how, I have to tell you that we
have to be friends. We have to share, enjoy

00:46:21.367 --> 00:46:29.497
sharing. There is no seriousness about it.
How can you be serious with your friend? Just

00:46:29.497 --> 00:46:36.637
relaxed enjoying each other's company. Even
if you have to argue - argue, doesn't matter.

00:46:36.637 --> 00:46:45.407
Even if you have a different view, it's all
right. But, you should not try to impose yourself

00:46:45.407 --> 00:46:50.477
on your friend, nor your friend should try
to impose. But try to understand each other.

00:46:50.477 --> 00:46:58.018
That's how we are going to learn such a lot.
You have to learn such a lot from each other.

00:46:58.018 --> 00:47:03.697
For example, I learnt so much from French
you'll be surprised. Learnt lot of things

00:47:03.697 --> 00:47:10.997
from French, the way they have their art,
their ideas of art, their music, their culture.

00:47:10.997 --> 00:47:18.337
Lots of things to be learnt. So, you have
friends in India, you have friends everywhere,

00:47:18.337 --> 00:47:25.298
you have friends now in South America. Everywhere
you have friends. You just go ahead with My

00:47:25.298 --> 00:47:33.028
badge. Finished. Oh! They will all jump for
you, they will do anything for you.

00:47:33.028 --> 00:47:41.887
So, this friendship, just think of it in this
world we have thousands and thousands of friends

00:47:41.887 --> 00:47:51.977
everywhere we go. And this is what we have
to know within ourselves that we have to be

00:47:51.977 --> 00:48:02.397
ourselves very, very friendly type, very friendly.
There is an openness between one friend and

00:48:02.397 --> 00:48:09.237
another friend. There is no closeness. There
is no tension. There is no formality. And,

00:48:09.237 --> 00:48:20.778
reliance. So much so that you can talk to
them about what you want, what is your need

00:48:20.778 --> 00:48:25.897
and what problems you have.

00:48:25.897 --> 00:48:36.387
I hope you understand that love means complete
freedom to yourself and to others. If you

00:48:36.387 --> 00:48:43.467
love someone, then there is complete freedom
and understanding. But this love has to be

00:48:43.467 --> 00:48:56.407
very, very pure. Complete understanding. You
have to feel that friendship. And, you will

00:48:56.407 --> 00:49:01.808
feel very proud that you have so many friends.
And real friends! You have so many friends

00:49:01.808 --> 00:49:17.147
who are real friends. You will be so very
- feeling a thing as if you are a great personality

00:49:17.147 --> 00:49:24.528
that you have so many friends in this world.
You are not alone.

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:35.327
Imagine before this what we had, so many saints,
so many great souls were born and they were

00:49:35.327 --> 00:49:47.657
treated like singular people and tortured,
killed, poisoned. They were alone. But you

00:49:47.657 --> 00:49:57.337
are not. You are all - are friends to each
other and the greatest friend you have is

00:49:57.337 --> 00:50:06.417
the Divine power, which is looking after you
and doing everything for you. If you have

00:50:06.417 --> 00:50:15.018
that kind of a relaxed, beautiful alertness
within you, you are going to enjoy life. You

00:50:15.018 --> 00:50:22.127
are going to enjoy Sahaja Yoga and you are
going to get many, many more people in Sahaja

00:50:22.127 --> 00:50:30.627
Yoga. And, if you don't have this among yourselves
then people are going to say, "Oh Mother,

00:50:30.627 --> 00:50:37.577
whatever You may say but Sahaja Yogis are
no good."

00:50:37.577 --> 00:50:48.518
So, for today, in this country of France where
we have got liberation, where we have fought

00:50:48.518 --> 00:50:58.857
for liberation, let us take to real liberation,
the real liberation of the soul of our spirit

00:50:58.857 --> 00:51:06.349
to enjoy. Enjoy everything that is available
with understanding.

00:51:07.938 --> 00:51:10.858
May God bless you all!
