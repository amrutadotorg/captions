00:00:08.303 --> 00:00:15.417
1994-1113 Address to Tunisian women,
Tunis (Tunisia)

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:19.977
You can’t see? You can come here.

00:01:32.588 --> 00:01:41.148
I’ve been here for a short time, but
I really felt so close to you.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:52.202
You are so sensitive and so sensible

00:01:58.632 --> 00:02:03.147
and you didn’t mind whatever I’ve told you.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.246
I’m a Mother, and I have to tell you
the truth

00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:22.232
and you shouldn’t feel bad if you think
that I’m your Mother.

00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:30.081
That is a Mother’s job;

00:02:31.173 --> 00:02:40.005
she has to have patience, love, affection
and also wisdom.

00:02:46.372 --> 00:02:54.548
Perhaps we women don’t realize how
important we are.

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:04.881
Men can do politics, economics and all
the mess of it,

00:03:09.298 --> 00:03:14.243
but women are responsible for the society.

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:22.303
They can make the society or mar
the society.

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:30.725
Wherever there are good societies, where
children are good,

00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:37.258
families are good, and there is peace,

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.810
there the women are responsible.

00:03:52.141 --> 00:04:03.530
The woman who has the job of rocking
a child can rule the world.

00:04:08.943 --> 00:04:16.026
In no way a woman should think she is less
than man.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.912
Woman is like this Mother Earth

00:04:28.383 --> 00:04:32.496
and man is like the sun.

00:04:33.577 --> 00:04:38.227
Look at the Mother Earth: how she bears us,

00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:45.477
how we torture her, and how she looks
after us.

00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:56.345
So the greatest quality of a woman is
her tolerance,

00:04:56.546 --> 00:05:01.564
her love and her wisdom.

00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:13.091
I forgot to bring a newspaper which
I wanted to show you,

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:19.860
in which English newspaper they have shown
a woman looking like a man

00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:26.697
and having few hair here coming
on the face, like a man.

00:05:38.913 --> 00:05:43.080
I would hate to be a man

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:51.275
because a man has to please so many bosses
and fight in life,

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:56.922
while woman has to please only one; that is
her husband.

00:06:07.628 --> 00:06:15.875
So the society can only be made alright
by human beings

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.153
who are not men, but women.

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:34.197
You all can play a very great part, and
a great role in your country also.

00:06:37.455 --> 00:06:46.012
Like when we had to fight the British I was
only about 17, 18 years of age

00:06:49.595 --> 00:06:54.019
and I was very active.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.019
They gave me electric shocks, they made
me sleep on the ice,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.267
did all kinds of things,

00:07:08.347 --> 00:07:13.882
but that time our country had to be free.

00:07:16.183 --> 00:07:25.083
But now, we have to be free from our ego
and conditionings.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.510
I’m very happy to see that you ladies here
in a Muslim country,

00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:41.545
so intelligent, so advanced and so free,

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:56.037
but in My own country there is another law
for Muslims.

00:07:58.634 --> 00:08:02.093
There’s not a common law

00:08:04.082 --> 00:08:11.743
and the condition of Muslim women is
horrible.

00:08:15.118 --> 00:08:24.265
Once I was going to a place in My car and
it failed on the way.

00:08:28.932 --> 00:08:37.984
And I got down from the car and there were
many ladies, Muslims,

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:48.481
ill-clad, very poor, were standing
for the water from a tap.

00:08:55.679 --> 00:09:03.221
They were all Muslims. Then I started
talking to them.

00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:10.728
So they told Me that each one of them had
been divorced by their husbands,

00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:14.573
they had “talaq, talaq, talaq”, finished.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:22.881
And some of them had even 24 children

00:09:25.541 --> 00:09:31.138
and they were just left on the lurch.

00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:38.217
They have no way of eating any sensible
food,

00:09:38.418 --> 00:09:43.928
no house, no water; so they live
on the street.

00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:53.891
There were more than hundred women there
and their children,

00:09:55.399 --> 00:10:00.916
and only one tap of water.

00:10:01.836 --> 00:10:08.426
Then there was one lady called Shah Bano.
She was divorced like this

00:10:08.627 --> 00:10:13.669
and she had no way to live.

00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:23.203
So she went to some reformers [She repeats
to the translator: “Reformers”],

00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:28.884
and requested them to put her case
in the court,

00:10:32.076 --> 00:10:36.201
I mean, charitable organization.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:47.203
And this case went up to the High Court.

00:10:50.237 --> 00:10:57.351
The High Court decided that her husband
has to support her

00:11:01.234 --> 00:11:04.946
because when she married, her husband was
a poor man

00:11:05.147 --> 00:11:09.806
so the man had - was very little amount;

00:11:14.744 --> 00:11:23.298
but then he became very rich, and drove her
out with all her children.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:31.964
So now she had no way where to go.

00:11:32.538 --> 00:11:35.954
So the court decided on the common law,

00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:42.262
that she should be given one third
of the income

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:54.320
and one house should be given to her
to live, because she was on the street!

00:11:59.922 --> 00:12:03.360
Though the High Court did that, our Prime
Minister

00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:08.190
who was Rajiv Gandhi, he was threatened
by Muslims

00:12:08.391 --> 00:12:15.613
that “if you give money to Shah Bano we
will not vote for Congress”.

00:12:30.028 --> 00:12:35.601
So the Shah Bano case was dismissed

00:12:37.204 --> 00:12:43.433
and Rajiv Gandhi said that even if one
Muslim man says

00:12:43.634 --> 00:12:51.968
that ‘Alright, Shah Bano should get
the money, then I will support the case.'

00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:08.184
But no Muslim man in India supported this
poor lady, no Muslim.

00:13:11.595 --> 00:13:19.705
Immediately she was helped by some
charitable institution.

00:13:23.164 --> 00:13:28.101
Such fear in the minds of many also

00:13:28.302 --> 00:13:31.530
that if they had supported her case

00:13:31.731 --> 00:13:37.129
they, they would have been killed or fatwa
on them.

00:13:47.942 --> 00:13:51.832
Worse is the case in Bangladesh,

00:13:52.033 --> 00:13:56.363
[She repeats to the translator: “worse is
the case in Bangladesh.”].

00:13:56.564 --> 00:14:05.809
In one week, four ladies were buried
half-naked into the Mother Earth

00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:13.297
and were stoned by people

00:14:13.498 --> 00:14:20.554
because their husbands said that they were
looking at other men, you see.

00:14:22.774 --> 00:14:28.015
Ultimately these women committed suicide.

00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:36.270
Then that you must have heard about a lady
from Bangladesh; Talisma (Taslima)

00:14:38.719 --> 00:14:42.475
She’s now hiding in Sweden

00:14:43.456 --> 00:14:50.002
because she said that it’s better that we
revise Koran

00:14:53.719 --> 00:14:58.382
and this harshness on women is too much

00:15:02.513 --> 00:15:06.158
and we have to work it out.

00:15:07.989 --> 00:15:12.709
So she had to run away to Sweden.

00:15:13.505 --> 00:15:18.691
Now they want her back in Bangladesh
to prosecute her

00:15:18.892 --> 00:15:22.716
because there is fatwa on her.

00:15:27.315 --> 00:15:31.598
They may kill her the same way.

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:40.648
If you see, all over the world, Muslim
women are the most tortured ones.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:52.143
It could not have been Mohammed Sahib who
would have allowed such nonsense.

00:15:54.668 --> 00:15:59.303
He talked of Rahim and Rahimat.

00:16:02.682 --> 00:16:13.271
The condition of these women, even
in Arabic countries, is very bad.

00:16:18.502 --> 00:16:27.103
There are thousands of French women
as keeps in Riyadh, thousands

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:37.486
and the poor Arabic ladies are tortured.

00:16:39.924 --> 00:16:43.787
There’s a reaction to it also.

00:16:44.383 --> 00:16:51.899
In Arabia there are some rich widows

00:16:52.108 --> 00:17:01.830
who actually take away young boys and
imprison them in their palaces.

00:17:10.253 --> 00:17:21.184
And also horrible things. Once an Indian
boy, married to one, was captured

00:17:25.824 --> 00:17:30.821
and he was arrested and kept with these
ladies.

00:17:33.844 --> 00:17:38.147
They used him for one month

00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:47.799
and he came out like a mad man. We know
him.

00:17:49.467 --> 00:17:56.221
This kind of thing still going on in modern
times.

00:17:58.219 --> 00:18:02.214
Now when I went to Turkey I was happy
to see

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:11.642
that Kemal Pasha Ataturk, Kemal Pasha has
done a good work for ladies there.

00:18:17.698 --> 00:18:23.758
He really gave them dignity and equal
rights,

00:18:26.315 --> 00:18:30.074
but unfortunately – I don’t know why –

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:37.089
the German culture has come in Turkey;
German culture.

00:18:42.361 --> 00:18:49.182
So they import even the cakes from Germany,
even the cakes,

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:58.272
while, while Turkish food is excellent,

00:18:58.473 --> 00:19:02.163
[She repeats to lady translator: “Turkish
food is excellent”].

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:11.674
They import their clothes from Germany;
everything from Germany,

00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:17.912
as if Germans are something coming
from heavens.

00:19:27.298 --> 00:19:29.900
I asked them ‘Why do you do it?’

00:19:30.101 --> 00:19:35.391
so they said, ‘If we are like this then
our men will respect us.’

00:19:41.398 --> 00:19:44.195
I couldn’t understand

00:19:44.804 --> 00:19:51.899
because after all men are created
by mothers.

00:19:55.517 --> 00:19:59.852
What discipline you give to your children

00:20:00.053 --> 00:20:07.963
should be Tunisian or Turkish,
your children.

00:20:14.124 --> 00:20:21.510
They must respect your culture and not that
of Germany or of France.

00:20:25.073 --> 00:20:30.488
Whatever dress we wear is traditional
from days together,

00:20:30.689 --> 00:20:34.817
thousands of years we’ve been wearing sari.

00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:46.687
Actually by travelling it’s little awkward
with sari.

00:20:49.109 --> 00:20:54.107
But I can never wear jeans, whatever you
may try,

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:03.658
because this is our tradition

00:21:04.098 --> 00:21:13.107
and in our tradition, the way a woman is
respectable has to be in sari.

00:21:18.303 --> 00:21:24.468
In some cities before marriage they do wear
every kind of dress,

00:21:27.838 --> 00:21:35.407
but after marriage they assume the position
as a Gruha Lakshmi,

00:21:35.608 --> 00:21:40.024
meaning the goddess of the household.

00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:51.899
She is the goddess and if she is
the goddess,

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:58.352
then all kinds of blessings come on that
family.

00:22:04.439 --> 00:22:12.977
We have seen our experiences that if
the woman is a Gruha Lakshmi

00:22:13.178 --> 00:22:22.670
in the pattern of Fatima, then all the good
can come to that family.

00:22:33.334 --> 00:22:41.150
I went to your bazaar and bought some
traditional dresses

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:53.688
and all these girls from all over the world
are wearing these dresses.

00:22:57.578 --> 00:23:05.358
Not only that they look very nice, but
also, they look like ladies, you see.

00:23:10.469 --> 00:23:14.782
There’s nothing to learn from French.

00:23:16.568 --> 00:23:22.441
If you want to know about French you’d
better read Moliere

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:31.069
or you can read Maupassant or Emile Zola.

00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:38.187
They have brought out the nonsense
of French families

00:23:44.545 --> 00:23:52.050
and the woman are so aggressive that men
have to go on dancing behind them.

00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:06.510
We can see from these, from these writers;
they have brought out so many things.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:20.189
As a result, men have become very ugly
in a way,

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:26.594
because Sartre, a horrible fellow, you must
have heard his name, Sartre,

00:24:26.795 --> 00:24:33.222
he’s written such horrible things that you
can’t even read one page.

00:24:45.918 --> 00:24:53.569
French women have ruined their society
completely.

00:24:54.852 --> 00:25:03.579
You see the first time when I went
to France they told me, ‘Mother,

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.416
You look so happy and joyous, but you
shouldn’t look like that,

00:25:08.617 --> 00:25:13.153
because French think you are ignoramus.’

00:25:24.702 --> 00:25:29.934
So I started my lecture with
‘Les Miserables’.

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:39.300
I said, “After every lamppost you have
a pub,

00:25:41.993 --> 00:25:47.412
and after every 11th lamppost you have
a prostitute.

00:25:48.961 --> 00:25:55.274
Then what will happen? You are going to be
miserable”.

00:25:57.078 --> 00:26:02.434
I’ve heard recently that the housewife
could be

00:26:02.635 --> 00:26:07.972
partly a prostitute in France.

00:26:14.478 --> 00:26:19.113
They say they are very tolerant society.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:25.570
No wonder there are so many children taking
to drugs,

00:26:25.771 --> 00:26:31.678
to violence, to AIDS; all kinds of things.

00:26:36.735 --> 00:26:50.729
I blame their mothers because they are busy
with their own decorations and things.

00:26:52.643 --> 00:26:56.913
They have no time for their children.

00:26:58.785 --> 00:27:01.557
After I started Sahaja Yoga I was
surprised:

00:27:01.758 --> 00:27:07.280
were many people coming from France,
many girls;

00:27:12.256 --> 00:27:16.496
and they told Me that, ‘Mother, in France

00:27:16.697 --> 00:27:23.322
we have been always around the hotels.’
‘For what?’

00:27:29.649 --> 00:27:37.575
To, to go into the hotels and available
to their customers,

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:48.478
from the college and they were on the list
of many girls

00:27:48.679 --> 00:27:53.514
who could accompany men for their holidays.

00:27:59.777 --> 00:28:03.802
Absolutely common,

00:28:05.244 --> 00:28:12.782
it’s nothing new, it is I’m telling you
at least ten years back it was going on.

00:28:17.045 --> 00:28:23.924
I mean, in such an immoral country
of immoral mothers,

00:28:24.125 --> 00:28:28.439
what would happen to children?

00:28:33.242 --> 00:28:37.674
There was one bank robber,

00:28:38.906 --> 00:28:43.047
and this bank robber was shown
on the television

00:28:43.248 --> 00:28:46.759
before the magistrate

00:28:49.288 --> 00:28:57.685
and he was boasting how he went through
a tunnel into the bank and then he stole.

00:29:00.851 --> 00:29:04.543
What was his name?
Yogi: Spaggiari.

00:29:04.744 --> 00:29:10.380
Shri Mataji: They say, you see, he’s famous
like Mahatma Gandhi.

00:29:12.771 --> 00:29:18.622
And then he was telling, he was, he told
that, ‘I went to the window

00:29:18.823 --> 00:29:22.950
and opened it and jumped out’.

00:29:25.285 --> 00:29:30.409
And he told the magistrate, ‘Should I show
you how I do it?’

00:29:33.268 --> 00:29:38.003
We saw it on the television, saw it
on the television.

00:29:39.426 --> 00:29:45.504
He went to the window, opened the window,
and jumped down,

00:29:47.965 --> 00:29:57.437
and escaped! And there was one fellow
waiting for him on a motorbike down below.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.891
And he became a hero; national hero.

00:30:05.092 --> 00:30:08.253
Next year I went there, all the young boys
and girls

00:30:08.478 --> 00:30:13.844
were wearing his photograph on their
T-shirts.

00:30:20.178 --> 00:30:23.452
The French women don’t realize what they
have done

00:30:23.653 --> 00:30:27.867
to their own children, to their own family.

00:30:31.927 --> 00:30:36.455
We, we started a school in India just
for children

00:30:36.656 --> 00:30:41.509
who are in these Western countries and
are suffering.

00:30:47.395 --> 00:30:52.677
And we had one French boy, Johan,

00:30:55.790 --> 00:31:01.497
and his grandparents reported
to the police,

00:31:03.148 --> 00:31:08.378
so five newspaper people came,

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:16.164
entered inside the premises without
permission

00:31:18.006 --> 00:31:21.678
and tortured that boy:

00:31:23.218 --> 00:31:27.286
asked thousand questions

00:31:31.065 --> 00:31:38.791
and the government forced us to send that
child back to France.

00:31:41.054 --> 00:31:49.501
Then the boy told Me, ‘Mother, I don’t want
to stay in France.’

00:31:51.222 --> 00:31:56.769
He wrote to the magistrate, ‘I don’t want
to stay in France,’

00:31:58.995 --> 00:32:07.019
and he was asked questions by Freudian
psychologist, Freudian.

00:32:10.268 --> 00:32:12.972
You must be knowing that Freud used
to teach

00:32:13.173 --> 00:32:18.462
that the first relationship, bad relation,
starts with mother

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:30.711
and they said, ‘This boy is no good
as a French one,

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.845
because he has no open heart.’

00:32:40.587 --> 00:32:44.984
But this boy told me that in the school
when the children go to the bathroom

00:32:45.185 --> 00:32:50.756
they open their clothes and do all kinds
of things which he doesn’t like.

00:32:59.109 --> 00:33:05.487
They take drugs, hashish, everything,
in school

00:33:09.259 --> 00:33:13.876
and still they want to keep the child
there.

00:33:15.275 --> 00:33:22.628
But these five newspaper people were
brought to courts in India

00:33:22.829 --> 00:33:27.329
because it was trespass,

00:33:31.284 --> 00:33:35.922
and they are fighting their case in India.

00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:42.016
They made hell for our life.

00:33:43.892 --> 00:33:47.309
All the French countries were informed

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:55.746
that we had a school where you take
children from Europe,

00:34:01.098 --> 00:34:09.543
as if it is – as if it is a crime, because,
you see, we are not Europeans, you see.

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:20.180
But our Indian children studied in England,
everywhere, no objection.

00:34:24.394 --> 00:34:27.086
Now they have made it compulsory

00:34:27.287 --> 00:34:33.927
that if you come to France you must speak
in French.

00:34:35.845 --> 00:34:44.975
No other language, as if French language
is the last word on literature.

00:34:48.691 --> 00:34:56.655
All this should tell you that nothing
to learn from French.

00:34:58.354 --> 00:35:05.094
They have ruined their society completely,
entirely.

00:35:07.464 --> 00:35:12.686
No marriage is successful, children are
immoral, mothers are immoral,

00:35:12.887 --> 00:35:20.089
husbands are immoral… I used to say it is
the gate of hell.

00:35:29.994 --> 00:35:37.100
You won’t believe, in the beginning, every
year I used to go three times to Paris.

00:35:39.928 --> 00:35:45.633
Now we have thousands who are Sahaja Yogis

00:35:47.651 --> 00:35:54.363
because there were so many who didn’t want
this, who didn’t like this.

00:35:56.916 --> 00:36:02.483
There were so many who didn’t want their
children to be ruined,

00:36:07.533 --> 00:36:11.715
who wanted to have a happy married life.

00:36:13.854 --> 00:36:19.271
So now we have lots of people who are
Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:23.036 --> 00:36:30.068
And it’s surprising; they are very great
Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:33.403 --> 00:36:40.706
Why I’m telling you this, that do not get
enamored by the culture of these people.

00:36:46.796 --> 00:36:54.652
This is the best way you can put down
all the fundamentalist, you see.

00:36:58.265 --> 00:37:01.956
What they are saying, that these are not
traditional Muslims,

00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:04.612
they do not dress up like traditional
Muslims,

00:37:04.813 --> 00:37:09.770
their lives are not like ours and all that.

00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:19.389
They say they are French; they are not
Muslims.

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:29.522
So if you show them that we respect
our culture

00:37:32.602 --> 00:37:36.456
and we don’t care for other cultures,

00:37:38.524 --> 00:37:44.648
immediately you’ll be amazed that they will
have no platform.

00:37:46.454 --> 00:37:49.592
What will they fight?

00:37:49.793 --> 00:37:55.389
What will they say against you people who
are sensible?

00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:02.283
As I told you yesterday, we cannot have
fundamentalists

00:38:02.484 --> 00:38:09.333
because we Indian women are extremely
traditional.

00:38:11.899 --> 00:38:19.721
We, we respect our culture and
our chastity,

00:38:24.096 --> 00:38:29.007
not in the history alone, but even today.

00:38:33.445 --> 00:38:37.940
So nobody can say, even Ayatollah Khomeini
used to say

00:38:38.141 --> 00:38:44.560
that Indian women are more than Muslims,
used to say that,

00:38:52.468 --> 00:39:01.475
because we believe in all the auspiciousness
of religion, auspiciousness.

00:39:05.949 --> 00:39:11.667
Thank God there is a word for
‘auspiciousness’ in French.

00:39:15.736 --> 00:39:21.798
So I’m just telling you that this is just
the beginning.

00:39:23.693 --> 00:39:28.260
Djamel came to Sahaja Yoga long time back.

00:39:28.461 --> 00:39:32.443
And I think about 16, 17 years back he told
Me, ‘Mother,

00:39:32.644 --> 00:39:39.653
there are dangerous things are happening
in Algeria.’

00:39:44.377 --> 00:39:47.179
I said, ‘What?’

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:54.975
‘That the women and young girls are taking
to French style of life;

00:40:00.386 --> 00:40:06.909
that women want to expose their body, and
do all kinds of such things.’

00:40:09.993 --> 00:40:13.222
I said, ‘Very dangerous!

00:40:13.423 --> 00:40:18.174
Because fundamentalists will take advantage
of this’.

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:23.848
And that’s what exactly has happened
after that.

00:40:24.049 --> 00:40:29.127
Now, Algeria is in the grip
of fundamentalists.

00:40:33.921 --> 00:40:37.676
They don’t know what to do, how to get out
of it.

00:40:38.615 --> 00:40:42.666
So imagine if you people decide

00:40:42.867 --> 00:40:47.172
to live like traditional Muslim living,

00:40:47.373 --> 00:40:51.814
just for the sake of it,

00:40:57.819 --> 00:41:02.937
or, as in American language:
‘for the heck of it.’

00:41:04.285 --> 00:41:08.817
So they cannot say.

00:41:10.639 --> 00:41:14.546
What objection they can have?

00:41:16.405 --> 00:41:21.441
And with Sahaja Yoga you can beat them
hollow.

00:41:23.838 --> 00:41:28.662
Sahaja Yoga is the middle path.

00:41:29.752 --> 00:41:37.885
Neither it is the extreme West, and nor
the extreme fundamentalism.

00:41:41.078 --> 00:41:47.316
It is a very essence of religion,

00:41:48.303 --> 00:41:52.329
that we don’t do anything wrong.

00:41:54.291 --> 00:42:04.349
We don’t take to anything that is wrong,
or bad, or irreligious.

00:42:10.721 --> 00:42:16.588
In this country the women look very
sensible

00:42:19.762 --> 00:42:29.077
and you can take a lead for the whole world
of the Muslim women.

00:42:31.793 --> 00:42:38.769
Poor one Talisma is there, who is
suffering, but here you are so many.

00:42:42.732 --> 00:42:50.819
If you take up upon yourself that “we will
show them

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:58.165
that we are really religious people”,

00:43:05.475 --> 00:43:12.949
you can solve the problem of fundamentalism
all over the world.

00:43:17.172 --> 00:43:21.225
This is in your hands.

00:43:21.492 --> 00:43:27.597
Also, to bring your men-folk to the central
path.

00:43:30.966 --> 00:43:37.219
They should not go to the extreme
of the left side.

00:43:39.565 --> 00:43:45.714
Like Mohammed Sahib has said, you should
not drink alcohol.

00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:54.460
Now what Christians say, that Christ went
to attend

00:43:54.661 --> 00:44:00.920
a wedding and there He made water
into wine.

00:44:05.286 --> 00:44:11.265
So among Christians it is not sinful
to drink wine – very nice, you see.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:17.290
That may be the reason Mohammed Sahib
has said,

00:44:17.491 --> 00:44:21.245
‘No wine, no alcohol.’

00:44:24.644 --> 00:44:31.638
Now, I, I had an interview, in Italy,

00:44:31.839 --> 00:44:37.492
and the gentleman is a very famous man,
who interviewed Me,

00:44:37.693 --> 00:44:40.687
and he said, ‘Mother, first You give me
realization,

00:44:40.888 --> 00:44:45.990
then I’ll interview You”. Romano Battaglia
his name is.

00:44:57.331 --> 00:45:05.465
I said, ‘Alright, get some water,’ and
I put My hand in it.

00:45:05.666 --> 00:45:10.707
He drank it, he said, ‘This tastes like
wine!’

00:45:12.385 --> 00:45:16.404
I said ‘That’s what Christ did.’

00:45:18.756 --> 00:45:30.115
Wine, which is described in the Bible,
is the grape juice – fresh grape juice.

00:45:34.284 --> 00:45:40.206
In Hebrew, in Hebrew language, it’s called
wine.

00:45:42.517 --> 00:45:49.605
Now, you can’t make alcohol
instantaneously, can you?

00:45:50.892 --> 00:45:55.905
It has to rot, rot, and rot.

00:45:56.106 --> 00:46:04.510
The more it rots, the better it is.
The more it smells, the better it is.

00:46:05.933 --> 00:46:10.230
What about cheese? Horrible.

00:46:12.763 --> 00:46:16.346
There are some good cheeses, but some
of them, some of the French,

00:46:16.547 --> 00:46:24.674
are horribly smelling, I tell you.
And the mouth also smells

00:46:26.146 --> 00:46:31.054
and they have a habit of kissing you.

00:46:36.665 --> 00:46:45.024
Oh, very difficult. Their hands smell
because they don’t use water at all,

00:46:45.225 --> 00:46:48.845
their mouth smells.

00:46:52.545 --> 00:46:55.955
You know My husband was Secretary General,
General,

00:46:56.156 --> 00:47:00.348
of the International Maritime Organization

00:47:02.182 --> 00:47:05.649
and sometimes we had to shake hands
with 700 people

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:11.481
at a time, going in, and coming out of
a drunken state, imagine it.

00:47:11.682 --> 00:47:14.387
[She repeats to lady translator:
“Shake hands. ”].

00:47:23.515 --> 00:47:26.954
And my husband would say, ‘Baba,
please press my hand; it’s paining.’

00:47:27.155 --> 00:47:31.037
I said, ‘Mine is paining also.’

00:47:37.858 --> 00:47:41.907
I said, ‘Why can’t you say ‘namaste’?’

00:47:43.664 --> 00:47:47.224
They said, my husband said, ‘They’ll think
something wrong with you,

00:47:47.425 --> 00:47:52.796
you are mentally upset,

00:47:52.997 --> 00:47:56.542
if you say namaste.’

00:47:56.759 --> 00:48:01.553
You see, they don’t like anything like that

00:48:04.262 --> 00:48:09.189
and men kiss and women also kiss.

00:48:09.494 --> 00:48:14.831
I don’t mind the women but men also kiss,
you know?

00:48:18.696 --> 00:48:25.516
I don’t know what to say. For us, it’s
absolutely absurd.

00:48:29.081 --> 00:48:32.337
Now the new trend has started in the West,
as you know.

00:48:32.538 --> 00:48:36.926
Not very new, but about ten years back,
first time.

00:48:39.493 --> 00:48:42.624
Is you must have heard of horrible things
of homosexuality,

00:48:42.825 --> 00:48:45.952
I can’t understand.

00:48:49.675 --> 00:48:53.161
You know, if they make a goal,

00:48:53.362 --> 00:48:56.695
the fellow gets very excited, is the one
who makes the goal,

00:48:56.896 --> 00:49:02.882
but he can’t hug others; he has to touch
with the hands.

00:49:10.263 --> 00:49:15.943
Sometimes after making the goal, he is
so excited that he runs out of the field,

00:49:16.144 --> 00:49:20.956
but he can’t hug anyone, you know,
he cannot express.

00:49:30.522 --> 00:49:33.544
The women can’t hug men.

00:49:33.745 --> 00:49:37.341
Women cannot hug men. They can only hug…

00:49:37.542 --> 00:49:43.845
no, women can’t hug women, they can only
hug men.

00:49:48.512 --> 00:49:55.699
If you go to a hotel with your father, you
can’t stay in the same room.

00:49:58.353 --> 00:50:02.189
With your brother also you can’t stay,

00:50:02.835 --> 00:50:07.997
but any other man you can stay,

00:50:08.198 --> 00:50:15.177
that is allowed. Such absurd people
they are.

00:50:16.591 --> 00:50:21.813
Now there was a law in England

00:50:22.014 --> 00:50:27.841
that a man can stay only with a woman,

00:50:28.042 --> 00:50:33.278
but no woman can stay with woman.

00:50:40.677 --> 00:50:44.449
Especially with parents it was so absurd,

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:49.802
that a girl, daughter, cannot stay with
the father.

00:50:54.089 --> 00:50:57.858
We Indians can’t understand.

00:50:58.059 --> 00:51:04.014
We are not, we are not so advanced. We
don’t know, we don’t know these things.

00:51:06.001 --> 00:51:11.276
They cannot trust a father with
the daughter,

00:51:15.819 --> 00:51:21.704
but then I saw on the television that
so many fathers and mothers

00:51:21.905 --> 00:51:27.031
and sons and daughters were fighting,
that they should be allowed to have

00:51:27.232 --> 00:51:30.776
relationship with each other.

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:38.170
These are parallel: English ones.

00:51:46.050 --> 00:51:52.378
There was a protest and a big strike
of these stupid people.

00:51:53.355 --> 00:51:57.787
In thousands mothers wanted to have
relations with their daughters,

00:51:57.988 --> 00:52:01.127
and the fathers wanted to have relations
with –

00:52:01.328 --> 00:52:04.288
no, mothers wanted to have with the sons,

00:52:04.489 --> 00:52:09.108
and the fathers wanted to have with their
daughters.

00:52:16.426 --> 00:52:21.773
It is the worst decadent society.

00:52:23.529 --> 00:52:27.001
And anything stupid comes like that they
accept,

00:52:27.202 --> 00:52:31.814
because they are very self-destructive.

00:52:38.331 --> 00:52:46.949
Now there are so many, 80 persons, who have
come from Western countries.

00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:54.560
For them it’s a historical event

00:52:56.518 --> 00:53:07.630
to have a breakthrough in the all kinds
of problems the Muslims are having.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.881
They all will not object to what I’m saying

00:53:19.082 --> 00:53:23.201
because they’ve seen it; they know what
it is.

00:53:30.654 --> 00:53:39.116
There is no respect of women. They want
to put them as nude women everywhere

00:53:42.567 --> 00:53:49.686
and women also accept. Even the parents
accept.

00:53:49.887 --> 00:53:55.521
Just making money out of their body
all the time.

00:53:57.864 --> 00:54:03.775
No self-respect, no sense of decency.

00:54:06.381 --> 00:54:14.200
Women have no respect. They want everybody
to look at them all the time.

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:22.479
In India any man tries to look at a woman
she’ll go and give him two slaps.

00:54:26.525 --> 00:54:31.394
That way, I must say, they have saved
our country.

00:54:34.513 --> 00:54:38.315
So, with such a decadent society,

00:54:38.516 --> 00:54:47.617
who have no moral values, who are getting
destroyed, we have to learn a lesson.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:55:00.091
It starts slowly and then it, they start
slipping down.

00:55:03.773 --> 00:55:11.666
So now you have to realize your importance
as the mothers of this country.

00:55:16.802 --> 00:55:22.590
Whatever Mohammed Sahib has done is
to respect women.

00:55:25.677 --> 00:55:32.895
He has written more about Christ’s Mother
than it is written in the Bible.

00:55:37.107 --> 00:55:42.429
For Her chastity, nobody should challenge,
He says.

00:55:45.429 --> 00:55:49.833
In Sahaja Yoga you will know who They were:
who was Fatima,

00:55:50.034 --> 00:55:56.476
who was Hazrat Ali, who was Mohammed Sahib.
You will now everything.

00:56:01.895 --> 00:56:08.624
All the subtle side of these great
Incarnations you will know,

00:56:10.862 --> 00:56:18.110
and you will get proof. It is a tangible
thing,

00:56:20.912 --> 00:56:24.306
absolutely tangible.

00:56:25.545 --> 00:56:29.201
Thus you have to believe,

00:56:31.179 --> 00:56:37.267
but for that, first you should grow
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:39.225 --> 00:56:44.885
In India women are regarded as the Shakti,
the power.

00:56:46.367 --> 00:56:51.505
I can see it here that, you see, because
of you people showing your personality,

00:56:51.706 --> 00:56:55.896
this country is very balanced.

00:57:03.621 --> 00:57:09.086
So just think of your responsibility.

00:57:09.437 --> 00:57:18.061
You can do a lot to change the fate of many
women who are suffering.

00:57:22.677 --> 00:57:26.805
I was very happy to come here.

00:57:27.006 --> 00:57:33.556
Not only that, but the vibrations were
so great and flowing,

00:57:33.757 --> 00:57:42.859
that I just couldn’t even sit. So many were
there, these Divine vibrations.

00:57:49.971 --> 00:57:55.586
You are people of great Divine value;

00:57:57.844 --> 00:58:04.906
respect yourself. Respect your value
system.

00:58:05.639 --> 00:58:14.106
Tell your children how to be respectable.
You can do it.

00:58:15.237 --> 00:58:20.302
I know you have great capacity.

00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:25.447
I am all with you.

00:58:25.648 --> 00:58:32.500
As you have suggested, I may buy
a residence here for Myself.

00:58:55.649 --> 00:58:58.354
I have few presents for you, very few,

00:58:58.555 --> 00:59:04.358
because I didn’t know I’ll meet so many
ladies here.

00:59:22.284 --> 00:59:24.636
You see, I couldn’t get something very nice

00:59:24.836 --> 00:59:29.131
but whatever I have, this is for you,

00:59:29.332 --> 00:59:33.508
and this stone is what you call the golden
topaz,

00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:43.416
and this is for the guru, is the master.
All the leaders are given this.

00:59:53.864 --> 00:59:58.831
What’s this? Yogini: …Mecca…
Shri Mataji: I know.

00:59:59.063 --> 01:00:03.944
Yogi: She wants to give You this from -
this is from Mecca, here. From Mecca.

01:00:04.145 --> 01:00:09.051
Shri Mataji: I know, beautiful. Thank you
very much.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:17.212
Now. This one is… no, no, for the other
lady, what’s her name?

01:00:18.573 --> 01:00:23.523
The one who has organized this.
The behind... This is the thing…

01:00:37.787 --> 01:00:41.639
(The yogini says in French that, as Mother
has said that we have be loyal

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.741
therefore she has to be also loyal
to the other participants,

01:00:46.942 --> 01:00:51.457
and starts listing the ladies

01:00:55.780 --> 01:01:01.884
who have helped in the organization
of the seminar.

01:01:02.149 --> 01:01:07.545
Then distribution of the presents starts)

01:01:09.429 --> 01:01:17.370
These are all Indian, Indian, this thing,
but this is also Western…

01:01:26.913 --> 01:01:31.640
You see, (mossia?) they call it, a kind
of a small flower.

01:01:58.067 --> 01:02:02.386
Who… She likes roses? This is a rose. Good?

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:35.712
This is musk, musk, musk. Musk.

01:02:43.322 --> 01:02:50.864
Now who…. This is sandalwood.

01:03:05.589 --> 01:03:11.162
No, no, no... This you can give lastly…
even gargar.

01:03:11.372 --> 01:03:17.942
Now we have so many, for all the ladies.
This is lotus.

01:03:21.107 --> 01:03:26.806
For the younger girls we’ll give
the Western… for the younger girls.
