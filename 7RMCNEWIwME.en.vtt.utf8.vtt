[Music]

00:24.410 --> 00:33.640
today we are here

00:27.400 --> 00:41.199
to know about guru principle what does a

00:33.640 --> 00:48.390
guru to whatever you have all the

00:41.199 --> 00:48.390
precious things within you he discovers

00:48.720 --> 00:54.960
them for your knowledge

00:57.329 --> 01:11.580
actually it is all there everything all

01:05.220 --> 01:19.670
the knowledge all the spirituality all

01:11.580 --> 01:19.670
the joy is there like time

01:23.380 --> 01:28.229
is all contained within you

01:32.759 --> 01:37.189
only thing the guru does

01:39.270 --> 01:52.409
makes you knowledgeable about your

01:41.520 --> 01:59.789
knowledge about your own spirit everyone

01:52.409 --> 02:04.700
has the spirit within himself everyone

01:59.789 --> 02:09.390
has the spirituality within yourself

02:04.700 --> 02:13.319
there is nothing that you get from

02:09.390 --> 02:17.250
outside but before getting this

02:13.319 --> 02:26.780
knowledge you are dealing or you are

02:17.250 --> 02:32.280
living in ignorance in that ignorance

02:26.780 --> 02:38.040
you do not know what clay here you have

02:32.280 --> 02:43.470
got within ear so the Guru's job is to

02:38.040 --> 02:48.950
make you know what you are that

02:43.470 --> 02:48.950
sensation that you should know your

02:51.080 --> 03:01.400
but means you know yourself you know

02:53.630 --> 03:05.570
party the experience is not so she the

03:01.400 --> 03:12.020
knowledge has to come and the Guru gives

03:05.570 --> 03:16.670
the knowledge about yourself now you

03:12.020 --> 03:20.690
have to tell it you should find out

03:16.670 --> 03:21.500
whatever your guru has to it is it true

03:20.690 --> 03:28.360
or not

03:21.500 --> 03:28.360
is it correct or not when we talk about

03:28.570 --> 03:37.340
realization one has to do first of all

03:34.960 --> 03:44.390
that we have to have patience with

03:37.340 --> 03:46.510
ourselves I know some people don't feel

03:44.390 --> 03:51.080
so good

03:46.510 --> 03:52.880
some people still have sicknesses some

03:51.080 --> 04:00.050
people don't even feel vibration

03:52.880 --> 04:02.300
sometimes have patience with you when

04:00.050 --> 04:07.670
you become your own guru first thing as

04:02.300 --> 04:12.459
the Guru has patience with his or her

04:07.670 --> 04:12.459
disciple you must have patience

04:16.389 --> 04:28.840
in that patience you will learn that you

04:23.159 --> 04:31.319
can tolerate so many things without any

04:28.840 --> 04:31.319
club

04:31.590 --> 04:39.000
they say one person who goes on grudging

04:35.379 --> 04:39.000
oh this is not good that is not good

04:43.419 --> 04:51.159
because they have no patience with

04:45.939 --> 04:56.400
themselves if you have patience with

04:51.159 --> 04:56.400
yourself everything you'll accept

04:57.389 --> 05:05.009
wherever you are you are with yourself

04:59.860 --> 05:09.629
cause you're realized Souls so you want

05:05.009 --> 05:09.629
the state to not get angry

05:13.349 --> 05:19.740
and also you not go on crumbling than

05:16.800 --> 05:27.149
clutching because you are enjoying

05:19.740 --> 05:32.039
yourself so for such people who have

05:27.149 --> 05:33.659
imaginary miseries of the past which do

05:32.039 --> 05:37.379
not exist in reality

05:33.659 --> 05:46.139
they cannot have the joy of reality they

05:37.379 --> 05:50.119
can so for a sahaja yogi is important

05:46.139 --> 05:50.119
that he should have joy

05:55.880 --> 06:10.070
within his heart it's like an ocean it's

06:02.630 --> 06:21.550
like an ocean which is there all the

06:10.070 --> 06:21.550
time to give you such trees

06:23.539 --> 06:36.319
even little drops of this ocean when

06:31.490 --> 06:41.180
they trickle down in your being it is so

06:36.319 --> 06:48.979
soothing the experience can be only

06:41.180 --> 06:55.509
experienced it's all waiting within

06:48.979 --> 07:00.110
yourself so I sahaja Yogi's and as gurus

06:55.509 --> 07:01.099
we have to love ourselves and understand

07:00.110 --> 07:04.969
our own wagon

07:01.099 --> 07:08.360
I think sahaja Yogi's have not yet

07:04.969 --> 07:15.560
understood their worth how many people

07:08.360 --> 07:21.199
in this world can give realization how

07:15.560 --> 07:23.930
many know about Kundalini so this is

07:21.199 --> 07:29.990
what is to remember that you are a

07:23.930 --> 07:33.919
sahaja yogi take abandon owning and

07:29.990 --> 07:38.120
ending it's so simple even to say on the

07:33.919 --> 07:41.479
mind it seems stupid to me but I have to

07:38.120 --> 07:44.599
say because people forget you forget

07:41.479 --> 07:47.629
that you are realizes use your vibratory

07:44.599 --> 07:50.139
awareness for at least protecting

07:47.629 --> 07:50.139
yourself

07:53.040 --> 07:58.740
because there is negativity sitting next

07:55.650 --> 08:01.550
to her so they're very careful about

07:58.740 --> 08:03.960
this to remember that I am a sahaja yoga

08:01.550 --> 08:07.110
once you say that you will know how you

08:03.960 --> 08:08.580
have to behave what is the protocol you

08:07.110 --> 08:11.010
will know what is the discipline you

08:08.580 --> 08:18.410
have to follow you will know how to love

08:11.010 --> 08:20.670
others everything this is the essence

08:18.410 --> 08:23.580
that will give you complete confidence

08:20.670 --> 08:29.580
in yourself and will be absolutely

08:23.580 --> 08:34.800
secure try to establish the state that

08:29.580 --> 08:38.370
you are sahaja yoga thus you become

08:34.800 --> 08:41.190
gurus of yourself and of others I hope

08:38.370 --> 08:45.780
we will understand as a guru what you

08:41.190 --> 08:49.740
have to do as a guru there's so many

08:45.780 --> 08:53.940
change and as your character yesterday

08:49.740 --> 08:57.590
as they showed how love se has written

08:53.940 --> 09:04.730
about the Masters how they were about

08:57.590 --> 09:09.990
about turmoil about jealousy about

09:04.730 --> 09:12.510
talking loose they are so great they are

09:09.990 --> 09:16.260
the Masters and they will be the Masters

09:12.510 --> 09:20.490
and you will be the Guru's if you try to

09:16.260 --> 09:24.000
do this what you hope to achieve I know

09:20.490 --> 09:28.080
somehow achieve it but most of you have

09:24.000 --> 09:30.320
to achieve with compassion and may about

09:28.080 --> 09:30.320
this

09:30.870 --> 09:53.670
[Music]

09:53.760 --> 09:55.820
