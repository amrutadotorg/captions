WEBVTT

00:08:47.969 --> 00:08:56.010
Today we are here to celebrate Mahashivaratri.

00:08:56.131 --> 00:09:00.171
It’s a very great privilege for all of us

00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:03.606
to understand about

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.929
Shri Mahadeva.

00:09:17.969 --> 00:09:24.252
Unless and until you have got your Self Realisation

00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:28.768
you cannot understand what

00:09:31.768 --> 00:09:39.929
is the great personality,

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:54.211
the character and the powers of Shri Mahadeva.

00:09:58.969 --> 00:10:03.894
It is not easy to conceive,

00:10:03.954 --> 00:10:07.873
also to reach the depths

00:10:07.994 --> 00:10:13.276
of his greatness,

00:10:13.397 --> 00:10:18.196
unless and until we are humble.

00:10:19.357 --> 00:10:25.478
We have to be very humble to reach

00:10:25.671 --> 00:10:30.671
at the Lotus Feet of Shri Mahadeva.

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:49.075
As you have seen, one has to cross even the Sahasrara

00:10:49.196 --> 00:10:57.317
to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality.

00:11:03.196 --> 00:11:09.478
He is beyond – beyond all our conceptions.

00:11:09.599 --> 00:11:15.317
But he resides in our hearts as the Spirit,

00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:23.873
and is reflected very well when you get your Realisation.

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:33.155
But still, one has to understand the powers of Shri Mahadeva

00:11:34.317 --> 00:11:41.559
which is not very easy to describe about

00:11:41.671 --> 00:11:50.559
this great God in liuttle words.

00:11:51.913 --> 00:11:56.599
But the first power he himself has,

00:11:56.712 --> 00:12:01.155
that he is a very forgiving God.

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:04.752
He forgives!

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:11.913
He forgives us so many of our sins,

00:12:12.034 --> 00:12:17.833
so many of our destructive activities,

00:12:18.115 --> 00:12:21.599
our horrible minds

00:12:21.752 --> 00:12:26.599
which tries to create problems for everyone.

00:12:27.357 --> 00:12:29.954
Up to a point!

00:12:32.196 --> 00:12:37.913
But he has the greatest power to destroy.

00:12:38.478 --> 00:12:43.833
His destruction comes so suddenly

00:12:43.954 --> 00:12:49.196
because he rules all the elements.

00:12:49.317 --> 00:12:54.873
All the elements he rules. He rules the Mother Earth,

00:12:55.599 --> 00:13:00.034
and he rules all other elements.

00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:03.752
Through their causal he rules,

00:13:03.873 --> 00:13:08.712
and he can destroy everything that he wants to

00:13:08.833 --> 00:13:13.438
if he finds there is problem.

00:13:19.196 --> 00:13:21.357
I have to tell you

00:13:21.478 --> 00:13:25.792
that earthquakes are managed by him, not by me.

00:13:26.357 --> 00:13:29.833
I am not there for destruction.

00:13:29.954 --> 00:13:35.954
He is the one who sees what’s happening on this earth,

00:13:36.075 --> 00:13:39.873
what’s happening to the human beings.

00:13:40.317 --> 00:13:44.792
I’ll give you an example of Gujurat:

00:13:45.873 --> 00:13:51.438
apart from anything, Gujurat people are very money-oriented,

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:53.994
they are worried with the stock-exchange, this, that,

00:13:54.115 --> 00:13:58.075
all the time money, money, money, money, money.

00:13:58.196 --> 00:14:04.397
Even if they are abroad, they are extremely money-oriented.

00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:08.873
Sometimes I am surprised,

00:14:08.994 --> 00:14:14.357
impossible to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:14.478 --> 00:14:21.075
and they like artificial type of things like some gurus or somebody.

00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:26.518
I don’t know from where they get like this.

00:14:26.599 --> 00:14:34.994
Whatever it is, you have a state called Bhavnagar in Gujurat.

00:14:35.518 --> 00:14:37.671
Bhavnagar people came,

00:14:37.792 --> 00:14:44.115
they brought for me those silver slippers, padukas,

00:14:44.236 --> 00:14:50.438
to be vibrated; I was surprised, I was happy at least,

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:53.559
that these people are thinking about it.

00:14:53.671 --> 00:14:59.559
So they did a Puja, they did a Havan in Bhavnagar

00:14:59.671 --> 00:15:02.792
and also in Baroda.

00:15:03.478 --> 00:15:06.276
These are the two places that were not touched,

00:15:06.397 --> 00:15:12.357
even touched even by bookambh by the earthquake.

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:14.357
Can you imagine.

00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:23.317
And Surat which is very much distant, was absolutely shattered.

00:15:25.034 --> 00:15:28.317
There are Sahaja Yogis, very few,

00:15:28.438 --> 00:15:35.155
all of them were saved, and their houses also did not move.

00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:42.075
This is between the protection of your Mother

00:15:42.196 --> 00:15:47.236
and the wrath of God Almighty.

00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:52.438
One has to understand this very well,

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:58.397
that he has powers over all the elements.

00:15:58.518 --> 00:16:01.671
I went to France,

00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:06.155
and there some people in France tried to trouble Me.

00:16:06.276 --> 00:16:09.671
And all the media got after Me.

00:16:09.792 --> 00:16:12.599
And on the television, everywhere,

00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:16.034
they were saying all kinds of things against me.

00:16:16.155 --> 00:16:19.631
I knew something would go somewhere

00:16:19.752 --> 00:16:24.438
and suddenly from the sea a big –

00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:29.792
I don’t know what to call it – a big storm started,

00:16:29.913 --> 00:16:32.792
suddenly, no-one knows why.

00:16:32.913 --> 00:16:37.954
And two ships were completely sunk,

00:16:38.752 --> 00:16:44.671
and those people who went to rescue them got cancer.

00:16:45.155 --> 00:16:50.954
Then it came, this storm started moving fast

00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:59.276
and all the churches lost their top – heads I should say.

00:16:59.397 --> 00:17:06.954
All the churches lost it. So many priest’s houses were ruined

00:17:07.075 --> 00:17:12.599
and it travelled and came up to the place where I had purchased

00:17:12.752 --> 00:17:15.833
a very big castle.

00:17:15.954 --> 00:17:21.559
It just stopped – and just stopped at the brink of it.

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:25.873
Now, it is not my doing, I must tell you.

00:17:25.994 --> 00:17:29.599
But this is what he does.

00:17:29.712 --> 00:17:35.317
Though he is very forgiving, he is extremely kind,

00:17:35.438 --> 00:17:44.397
he’s blissful, but you should be aware of his powers.

00:17:44.518 --> 00:17:53.994
All those powers are used to protect my work, I should say.

00:17:54.115 --> 00:18:01.276
It goes too far and it is to show to people that

00:18:01.397 --> 00:18:06.873
they shouldn’t obstruct the work of spirituality.

00:18:06.994 --> 00:18:13.397
It should be real spirituality. It should not be somebody

00:18:13.518 --> 00:18:20.115
like a false guru coming up and showing some magic,

00:18:20.236 --> 00:18:26.631
or talking something about some far-fetched thing.

00:18:26.752 --> 00:18:30.994
But the real spirituality, if you have,

00:18:31.115 --> 00:18:34.317
the protection will be always there,

00:18:34.438 --> 00:18:37.873
and Shiva will be very blissful.

00:18:37.994 --> 00:18:41.236
It’s extremely blissful.

00:18:41.357 --> 00:18:47.276
And what does he give you is even more beautiful

00:18:47.397 --> 00:18:49.559
than you could think of.

00:18:51.913 --> 00:18:55.196
He is extremely forgiving.

00:18:55.317 --> 00:18:59.034
I should say he is the source of such forgiveness.

00:18:59.155 --> 00:19:05.833
If you have forgiveness in your heart, he resides in your heart.

00:19:05.954 --> 00:19:16.155
Otherwise, gradually, you start developing

00:19:17.276 --> 00:19:22.438
very difficult types of diseases.

00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:30.994
Say, if you are forgiving, your heart runs very fast.

00:19:31.115 --> 00:19:37.792
No-one can touch your heart. You cannot get heart-attacks.

00:19:38.357 --> 00:19:45.873
But if you are tolerating, suffering

00:19:45.994 --> 00:19:55.873
and taking many things as a power of your own,

00:19:55.994 --> 00:20:02.478
doing wrong things and forgetting about God,

00:20:02.599 --> 00:20:09.752
then you also start developing a very weak heart.

00:20:10.034 --> 00:20:13.994
So one side is that you develop a heart

00:20:14.115 --> 00:20:19.994
which is extremely aggressive,

00:20:21.357 --> 00:20:25.599
and can become like Hitler’s heart.

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:33.752
Under any kind of pretensions, if you start torturing someone,

00:20:33.873 --> 00:20:37.478
your heart becomes solid

00:20:37.599 --> 00:20:41.994
and then you can get a tremendous massive heart-attack,

00:20:42.115 --> 00:20:45.155
and all the troubles from that.

00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:50.155
This is inevitable.

00:20:50.276 --> 00:20:56.075
But supposing you are extremely tolerant

00:20:56.196 --> 00:21:01.075
and you tolerate all nonsense, you are very docile,

00:21:01.196 --> 00:21:04.438
you are a frightened person.

00:21:04.559 --> 00:21:09.196
If you are frightened, then because of fright you do that,

00:21:09.317 --> 00:21:14.478
you can develop another kind of a heart we call as angina

00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:17.034
where the blood supply is less,

00:21:17.155 --> 00:21:23.034
and ultimately you develop a kind of guilt and

00:21:23.155 --> 00:21:28.115
you lead a very mediocre life.

00:21:29.913 --> 00:21:35.236
So this second thing also is very visible

00:21:35.357 --> 00:21:40.631
among people who think they are very, very tolerant.

00:21:40.752 --> 00:21:45.397
I am saying that tolerance is alright,

00:21:45.518 --> 00:21:48.115
because of Spirituality,

00:21:48.236 --> 00:21:51.671
but not because you are frightened,

00:21:51.792 --> 00:21:56.317
and you are afraid of something.

00:21:56.438 --> 00:21:59.792
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have no business to be

00:21:59.913 --> 00:22:02.357
afraid of anything.

00:22:03.518 --> 00:22:07.397
In India people are afraid of everything!

00:22:07.518 --> 00:22:11.671
If they can see a squirrel, they will be frightened.

00:22:15.671 --> 00:22:18.994
If they see a lizard – finished!

00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:21.873
I mean they are afraid of anything,

00:22:21.994 --> 00:22:27.994
and the ladies in India are so afraid of even cockroaches!

00:22:28.833 --> 00:22:33.196
This kind of temperament is absolutely stupid!

00:22:33.317 --> 00:22:42.236
Because that makes you a kind of a person who is prone to angina.

00:22:42.357 --> 00:22:45.236
What is there to be afraid of?

00:22:45.357 --> 00:22:48.559
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini,

00:22:48.671 --> 00:22:52.236
you are not to be afraid of anything.

00:22:52.357 --> 00:22:55.438
They are afraid of rats,

00:22:55.671 --> 00:22:59.478
all kinds of nonsense and they boast of it,

00:22:59.599 --> 00:23:01.712
and they talk about it.

00:23:01.833 --> 00:23:07.236
Here the heart is becoming weak and weak and weak.

00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:12.752
Also, I must say, the Indian men are responsible for that.

00:23:12.873 --> 00:23:15.712
Because they treat their women as

00:23:15.833 --> 00:23:20.357
if they are appendages or some sort of a liability,

00:23:20.478 --> 00:23:22.873
I don’t know what they think they are.

00:23:22.994 --> 00:23:28.599
Their behaviour is so bad, unbelievable!

00:23:28.752 --> 00:23:34.438
Especially in north India, I have seen, women have no position.

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:39.792
The woman is brought in the house, kept in the house,

00:23:40.954 --> 00:23:43.357
just like a maidservant,

00:23:43.478 --> 00:23:46.518
she has to cover he face all the time,

00:23:46.599 --> 00:23:52.671
she doesn’t have to go out anywhere without permission.

00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:54.752
It’s terrible!

00:23:54.873 --> 00:23:59.155
Some people say it is a Muslim influence or whatever it is.

00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:09.196
But when you believe in eternal life, in spiritual life,

00:24:09.317 --> 00:24:18.599
you should not be governed by any such nonsensical atrocities.

00:24:20.357 --> 00:24:23.236
And that’s why I feel

00:24:23.357 --> 00:24:27.792
that you really need the emancipation of women in India.

00:24:27.913 --> 00:24:34.034
They are very good, they are very tolerant, they are very sweet,

00:24:34.155 --> 00:24:42.599
but they develop all the bad diseases, all the mental diseases,

00:24:42.712 --> 00:24:47.155
because they don’t know their own value,

00:24:47.276 --> 00:24:50.559
they don’t know their own self-respect.

00:24:50.671 --> 00:24:54.994
And on this I have already spoken at length.

00:24:55.115 --> 00:24:58.397
Whey should men behave like that?

00:24:58.994 --> 00:25:06.397
I think in our country, we have at least seventy percent are women;

00:25:07.075 --> 00:25:13.478
and seventy percent people’s energy is wasted in the north India.

00:25:14.317 --> 00:25:17.712
I don’t know what they think of themselves.

00:25:17.833 --> 00:25:20.792
And then they are punished.

00:25:20.913 --> 00:25:25.034
All such countries can never prosper,

00:25:25.155 --> 00:25:29.075
because women are the Laxmis.

00:25:29.518 --> 00:25:32.631
But they have to be Laxmis also,

00:25:32.752 --> 00:25:35.712
they have to behave like Laxmis.

00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:40.792
But some of them come up like this that you are shocked.

00:25:41.034 --> 00:25:45.397
How can they be women, they look like devils?

00:25:45.712 --> 00:25:50.276
So such an imbalance in the society

00:25:50.397 --> 00:25:55.115
which is punished, again, by Shri Mahadeva.

00:25:56.599 --> 00:26:00.196
He is very kind,

00:26:00.317 --> 00:26:04.196
and he looks after the people who have to suffer it.

00:26:04.317 --> 00:26:08.994
And he tries to punish people who make them suffer.

00:26:09.478 --> 00:26:14.913
It is his quality to help

00:26:15.034 --> 00:26:20.833
by destroying people who are aggressive.

00:26:21.671 --> 00:26:24.833
He doesn’t talk of any Kundalini,

00:26:24.954 --> 00:26:27.792
he doesn’t talk of Self Realisation,

00:26:27.913 --> 00:26:31.236
he just punishes them, nicely!

00:26:31.357 --> 00:26:35.994
In such a bad way that it’s shocking!

00:26:36.115 --> 00:26:39.518
And he relieves sometimes people like

00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:45.873
– I have seen many women who live like this, suffer so much.

00:26:45.994 --> 00:26:51.357
They die much earlier than their ages.

00:26:51.994 --> 00:26:59.671
All this one has to see in the right perspective.

00:27:00.712 --> 00:27:05.115
He’s there to protect, of course,

00:27:05.236 --> 00:27:08.397
but more to destroy.

00:27:08.599 --> 00:27:14.631
He protects all kinds of animals, all birds,

00:27:14.752 --> 00:27:18.397
all the nature, he protects.

00:27:19.357 --> 00:27:26.792
He is the one who brings all the joy,

00:27:26.913 --> 00:27:30.599
all the joy of spirituality.

00:27:30.712 --> 00:27:38.034
But if you try to become aggressive,

00:27:39.478 --> 00:27:43.873
then he is the one who will destroy.

00:27:44.236 --> 00:27:50.357
Sometimes he gives more long rope to hang,

00:27:50.478 --> 00:27:52.599
and so people think we are alright,

00:27:52.712 --> 00:27:55.518
they are satisfied with themselves.

00:27:55.631 --> 00:27:58.155
On the contrary, in the west I find,

00:27:58.276 --> 00:28:01.833
the women are ruling the men more than the men.

00:28:01.954 --> 00:28:04.034
Very surprising.

00:28:04.155 --> 00:28:07.518
I don’t know how they have handled the situation,

00:28:07.631 --> 00:28:10.196
but they are ruling, all the time,

00:28:10.317 --> 00:28:13.196
and the men have to be under their thumb

00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:15.913
– I don’t know how they have managed it –

00:28:16.034 --> 00:28:20.438
but they do it! They are not humble.

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:23.196
They don’t love,

00:28:23.317 --> 00:28:27.518
and they go on divorcing their husbands all the time.

00:28:27.631 --> 00:28:30.833
They do not love!

00:28:30.954 --> 00:28:33.438
They don’t know what is love is.

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:40.155
But also, I have seen men don’t understand what love is in India.

00:28:40.276 --> 00:28:42.599
They don’t know how to love

00:28:42.712 --> 00:28:47.631
their wives, which is a life-partner.

00:28:47.752 --> 00:28:52.276
How to respect, they don’t understand.

00:28:52.397 --> 00:28:57.397
There, then comes a great wrath,

00:28:57.518 --> 00:29:02.034
and this wrath works in so many ways,

00:29:02.752 --> 00:29:05.873
in creating horrible diseases

00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:13.438
and in creating problems and problems for such men.

00:29:19.075 --> 00:29:23.913
And the society also is responsible

00:29:24.034 --> 00:29:31.317
for doing all kinds of things against humble people.

00:29:33.236 --> 00:29:39.873
Both ways, one has to understand, that if you are aggressive,

00:29:39.994 --> 00:29:46.833
you are under the Third Eye of Shri Mahadeva.

00:29:47.712 --> 00:29:53.155
In any way if you are aggressive, say with your servants,

00:29:53.276 --> 00:29:57.115
if you are aggressive with your subordinates,

00:29:57.236 --> 00:30:02.833
if you are aggressive with your children,

00:30:03.913 --> 00:30:09.317
there is this wrathful God watching,

00:30:09.397 --> 00:30:16.792
and one can get under the spell of his destruction.

00:30:18.397 --> 00:30:25.075
But he gives us the great heights of Himalaya.

00:30:25.599 --> 00:30:35.397
He makes human beings extremely beautiful, very noble,

00:30:35.994 --> 00:30:41.792
and he wants that people should love each other.

00:30:42.438 --> 00:30:46.559
There should be pure love among human beings.

00:30:47.397 --> 00:30:59.034
And also he makes you, very delicately,

00:31:01.671 --> 00:31:04.833
behaving towards other people;

00:31:04.954 --> 00:31:09.873
very sweetly behaving towards others.

00:31:10.438 --> 00:31:18.559
If you don’t have that, then you are going in the wrong direction.

00:31:18.671 --> 00:31:21.357
But his greatest privilege,

00:31:21.478 --> 00:31:26.276
that he gives you the height and the depth.

00:31:26.954 --> 00:31:35.155
If you are worshipping him, then you develop such heights

00:31:35.276 --> 00:31:40.438
that you see the whole world as a witness.

00:31:40.833 --> 00:31:48.913
He sees the whole world as a sakshi-swarupa, as a witness.

00:31:49.034 --> 00:31:55.317
And so he is the knowledge, he is the pure knowledge.

00:31:55.438 --> 00:31:59.155
You may get your Realisation, alright;

00:32:00.075 --> 00:32:03.357
you might feel the cool breeze in your hands, alright;

00:32:03.478 --> 00:32:08.478
but do you have the knowledge?

00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:13.155
I have to tell you what finger means what,

00:32:13.276 --> 00:32:18.196
what hand means what, what is vibrations, I have to tell you.

00:32:18.317 --> 00:32:23.994
He is that knowledge, He is the pure knowledge,

00:32:24.115 --> 00:32:29.913
complete knowledge, of the highest level.

00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:34.671
So he is the source of knowledge.

00:32:34.913 --> 00:32:42.599
Those people who are not humble cannot get that knowledge.

00:32:43.155 --> 00:32:47.833
Those people who are arrogant

00:32:47.954 --> 00:32:54.873
and who do not handle others delicately, sweetly, beautifully,

00:32:55.994 --> 00:32:59.478
are not blessed by him.

00:32:59.599 --> 00:33:06.913
They cannot achieve anything in life.

00:33:07.034 --> 00:33:09.276
What do we have to achieve?

00:33:09.397 --> 00:33:16.438
Not your position, not your wealth, not all these outward things,

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:21.034
but you have to achieve a loving heart!

00:33:21.155 --> 00:33:24.631
Heart with which you can love.

00:33:24.752 --> 00:33:28.954
If there is Shiva in your heart, you will love

00:33:29.075 --> 00:33:34.671
everyone in a very beautiful manner.

00:33:34.792 --> 00:33:39.752
There won’t be any nonsensical ideas about love.

00:33:39.873 --> 00:33:51.599
Just pure love, pure love for all the people.

00:33:51.994 --> 00:34:00.631
With the blessing, then all your harshness goes away.

00:34:01.034 --> 00:34:05.913
For example, if you have a little power, little power,

00:34:09.075 --> 00:34:12.631
so you start to misuse it.

00:34:13.317 --> 00:34:21.236
Look at Shiva, he has so many powers; if he starts misusing,

00:34:21.357 --> 00:34:25.913
there won’t be even a blade of grass left on this earth.

00:34:26.034 --> 00:34:32.873
How much you are sinful, selfish, you know that.

00:34:34.236 --> 00:34:36.599
But still he gives you a chance

00:34:36.752 --> 00:34:39.478
‘So let’s see, they might improve’.

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:44.631
And he is extremely generous, extremely generous,

00:34:44.752 --> 00:34:50.913
he is very forgiving and also extremely generous.

00:34:51.438 --> 00:35:00.712
Now supposing there are people who are living in a desert

00:35:01.438 --> 00:35:05.397
and they are very good people,

00:35:05.518 --> 00:35:10.357
and they are suffering because they are living in a desert,

00:35:10.478 --> 00:35:15.833
he will create oasis for them, he controls the Mother Earth.

00:35:15.954 --> 00:35:19.913
He can do everything to make them happy,

00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:25.913
if they are spiritual, if they worship.

00:35:26.236 --> 00:35:30.196
But human beings are so stupid

00:35:30.317 --> 00:35:35.671
that they go on fighting also in the name of God.

00:35:35.792 --> 00:35:43.034
Like in the south we have two types of people,

00:35:43.155 --> 00:35:46.712
one who worships Shiva, another who worships Vishnu.

00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:48.397
Can you imagine!

00:35:49.196 --> 00:35:52.397
Vishnu used to worship Shiva!

00:35:52.518 --> 00:35:57.236
Nobody’s higher, nobody’s lower. It’s so important.

00:35:57.357 --> 00:35:59.913
Everything is so important.

00:36:00.034 --> 00:36:05.276
But they used to fight on this point, if they are worshipping Shiva,

00:36:05.397 --> 00:36:08.357
or they are worshipping Vishnu,

00:36:08.478 --> 00:36:11.671
and nowhere near the reality they were.

00:36:11.792 --> 00:36:14.913
They didn’t know what was the reality, nothing,

00:36:15.034 --> 00:36:18.397
just fighting, fighting, fighting.

00:36:18.518 --> 00:36:24.599
In the name of God, those who fight, Shiva comes on them

00:36:24.752 --> 00:36:28.075
and with his trident hits them.

00:36:28.196 --> 00:36:30.873
You are not to fight in the name of God,

00:36:30.994 --> 00:36:34.115
but you have to love and understand.

00:36:34.236 --> 00:36:38.075
So this fighting in the name of God is a nonsense.

00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:41.518
Not only that but it’s very, very dangerous.

00:36:41.631 --> 00:36:46.357
All such people who do that will be destroyed.

00:36:46.478 --> 00:36:52.599
It is self-destructive. Such people will be destroyed completely. 

00:36:52.752 --> 00:36:59.833
So, you should understand that in the name of God you have to love.

00:36:59.954 --> 00:37:02.115
You have to understand.

00:37:02.236 --> 00:37:05.357
You need not tolerate nonsenses, it’s different;

00:37:05.478 --> 00:37:11.599
but you have to love people, spread you love.

00:37:11.712 --> 00:37:17.075
Gradually this love can go all over, all over the world,

00:37:17.196 --> 00:37:23.276
and then the vision of mine I can see working out.

00:37:23.397 --> 00:37:27.196
But if there is fighting, there’s hatred,

00:37:27.317 --> 00:37:29.833
there’s all kinds of aggressiveness,

00:37:29.954 --> 00:37:34.559
these are all against Shiva, and such people will be destroyed.

00:37:34.671 --> 00:37:37.075
What will I do with them?

00:37:37.196 --> 00:37:40.438
What can I do if they are destroyed?

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:46.276
If they are very money oriented, materialistic people,

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:50.357
they are not loving them, they are loving only for money.

00:37:50.478 --> 00:37:54.478
All such people will be destroyed, no doubt.

00:37:54.599 --> 00:38:01.518
One should be not only humble, but should be extremely loving.

00:38:01.631 --> 00:38:08.518
To get the blessings of Shiva you have to be extremely loving.

00:38:09.833 --> 00:38:16.276
Such people may not be very cunning, clever,

00:38:16.397 --> 00:38:20.599
maybe very innocent – they must be.

00:38:20.712 --> 00:38:25.873
Because when you love somebody, you want to help that person.

00:38:25.994 --> 00:38:27.954
I have suffered myself,

00:38:28.075 --> 00:38:32.518
I have tried to help people and they have deceived me.

00:38:32.712 --> 00:38:35.478
So what? That’s their nature,

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:38.155
and they are destroyed, what can I do?

00:38:38.276 --> 00:38:43.276
I didn’t ask them that you deceive me, but they deceived me

00:38:43.397 --> 00:38:45.518
– I don’t know why.

00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:49.873
And I have been very kind and nice, and still they deceived me.

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:56.518
So when the destruction follows, what can I do about it?

00:38:56.671 --> 00:38:59.712
I don’t want anybody to be destroyed,

00:38:59.833 --> 00:39:02.518
I love this creation of mine,

00:39:02.631 --> 00:39:04.397
and I don’t have

00:39:04.518 --> 00:39:10.873
any way of protecting them if they are destructive.

00:39:11.792 --> 00:39:18.196
Because there is another great power who can destroy them.

00:39:19.397 --> 00:39:25.236
See then, I am absolutely in a helpless condition, sometimes I feel

00:39:25.357 --> 00:39:27.913
and I don’t know how to express,

00:39:28.034 --> 00:39:31.397
but one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis

00:39:31.518 --> 00:39:38.155
that with Shiva’s love and his blessings

00:39:38.276 --> 00:39:47.317
you can become extremely loving, extremely generous,

00:39:47.438 --> 00:39:55.671
very, very sweet and innocent like children.

00:39:56.397 --> 00:39:59.631
You have to be innocent.

00:39:59.752 --> 00:40:03.518
There is no need to be very clever and cunning

00:40:03.631 --> 00:40:12.317
and you will be amazed how your innocence will be protected.

00:40:12.438 --> 00:40:17.155
If you are innocent, you don’t have to worry,

00:40:17.599 --> 00:40:27.034
there’s a power, the Third Eye of Shiva looking after you.

00:40:27.155 --> 00:40:30.478
Wherever you are going, he is with you.

00:40:30.599 --> 00:40:34.034
That doesn’t mean that you become stupid.

00:40:34.155 --> 00:40:40.196
It doesn’t mean that you are not practical.

00:40:40.317 --> 00:40:45.115
All that is taken over, all the practical side,

00:40:45.236 --> 00:40:47.873
by the power of Shiva.

00:40:47.994 --> 00:40:54.712
His guidance, his love, his kindness,

00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:58.994
you can see at every, every step of life.

00:40:59.115 --> 00:41:01.913
But first of all, watch your steps!

00:41:02.034 --> 00:41:06.599
Are you aggressive? Are you troublesome?

00:41:06.712 --> 00:41:11.954
Do you say harsh things to others?

00:41:12.752 --> 00:41:17.115
Or are you humble? Are you gentle?

00:41:17.236 --> 00:41:22.712
And if you are kind, he is very much pleased.

00:41:22.833 --> 00:41:29.196
In the nature, it is His rule that works.

00:41:29.833 --> 00:41:32.712
And they (animals) are so systematic,

00:41:32.833 --> 00:41:40.752
they live with understanding of each other.

00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:57.196
For example, if you go in the jungle and it is absolutely quiet,

00:41:57.954 --> 00:42:01.155
and you don’t even hear the birds twittering:

00:42:01.276 --> 00:42:05.397
then you should know there is a tiger sitting some way.

00:42:05.518 --> 00:42:10.075
Because he is the king. They know they have to obey,

00:42:10.196 --> 00:42:14.236
and when the king is there, his protocol is there.

00:42:14.357 --> 00:42:17.397
They know automatically what is the protocol of the king.

00:42:17.518 --> 00:42:22.115
Nobody would be even moving if he is there.

00:42:22.236 --> 00:42:24.994
He sits in his majesty.

00:42:25.115 --> 00:42:30.478
Then in one week, or maybe fifteen days he will kill one animal.

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:32.397
He has to eat.

00:42:32.518 --> 00:42:41.357
He kills one animal then he and his family, they eat first.

00:42:41.438 --> 00:42:46.034
He waits for some time, of course, for the blood to ooze out,

00:42:46.155 --> 00:42:49.712
then the whole family comes and eats.

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:53.115
Then he leaves the body there.

00:42:53.236 --> 00:42:59.873
Then by gradation, one by one, all kinds of animals come

00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:03.075
and eat it as a prasad.

00:43:03.196 --> 00:43:12.115
And the last thing are the crows who come and eat that animal.

00:43:12.236 --> 00:43:17.518
Such discipline, such understanding of the protocol;

00:43:17.631 --> 00:43:24.631
I am amazed how animals are managed by Shiva.

00:43:24.752 --> 00:43:31.397
You never hear that animals are having a ‘strike’,

00:43:31.518 --> 00:43:38.671
or animals are having a big ‘underworld’ animals!

00:43:38.792 --> 00:43:45.954
You don’t hear that these animals are stealing things.

00:43:46.075 --> 00:43:51.792
And just imagine, we are coming from that animal life,

00:43:51.913 --> 00:43:54.752
but we are worse than them.

00:43:54.873 --> 00:44:00.075
How are we going to rise if we have all such funny ideas

00:44:00.196 --> 00:44:05.671
of behaving in such a manner of fighting.

00:44:05.792 --> 00:44:09.599
On any small little excuse they will fight,

00:44:09.752 --> 00:44:11.994
they will start fighting.

00:44:12.115 --> 00:44:15.357
Animals also fight a little bit among themselves,

00:44:15.478 --> 00:44:18.155
but not in a collective way.

00:44:18.276 --> 00:44:22.155
They don’t do it in a collective way as we do it here.

00:44:24.712 --> 00:44:29.357
It is really at the slightest provocation

00:44:29.478 --> 00:44:33.438
we get into groups and start fighting.

00:44:33.559 --> 00:44:37.559
They get into groups but they don’t fight.

00:44:37.671 --> 00:44:39.712
What is the thing among them?

00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:46.317
Everything is so much, so much understood by animals,

00:44:46.438 --> 00:44:53.438
why not for us also to understand the law of nature?

00:44:53.559 --> 00:44:55.599
It is Mahadeva

00:44:55.712 --> 00:45:03.196
who manages that all the nature’s law are to be obeyed.

00:45:03.317 --> 00:45:07.752
Even the Mother Earth, the sky, everything,

00:45:07.873 --> 00:45:11.478
is looked after by him.

00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:15.155
He does nice, nice, beautiful things for us.

00:45:15.276 --> 00:45:18.075
With the changing of the seasons,

00:45:18.196 --> 00:45:22.833
he creates these beautiful flowers;

00:45:22.954 --> 00:45:28.115
he creates all that is soothing and joy-giving and beautiful,

00:45:28.236 --> 00:45:29.994
he looks after.

00:45:30.115 --> 00:45:35.317
He gives us to see what nature has given us,

00:45:35.438 --> 00:45:42.397
and tries to please us, keep us happy, entertain,

00:45:42.518 --> 00:45:45.196
like an innocent child.

00:45:45.317 --> 00:45:48.954
But while we are, in our arrogance,

00:45:49.075 --> 00:45:53.155
we have our reactions – to everything!

00:45:53.438 --> 00:45:57.276
You see a carpet, you will say “I don’t like it!”

00:45:57.397 --> 00:46:00.155
Especially in the west, it is a common

00:46:00.276 --> 00:46:02.075
thing to say “I don’t like it”.

00:46:02.196 --> 00:46:07.034
Who are you not to like something, or to dislike something?

00:46:07.155 --> 00:46:09.599
What do you think of yourself?

00:46:09.712 --> 00:46:13.115
It’s very common, and shamelessly they will say

00:46:13.236 --> 00:46:19.317
“I don’t like this, I like it …” It’s impossible!

00:46:19.397 --> 00:46:22.833
Such human beings, I don’t know where they will go,

00:46:22.954 --> 00:46:24.833
what will happen to them.

00:46:24.954 --> 00:46:30.954
Instead of appreciating, instead of enjoying everything,

00:46:31.075 --> 00:46:36.115
why to start criticizing and reacting.

00:46:36.236 --> 00:46:38.954
Reaction is much more in the west, I must say,

00:46:39.075 --> 00:46:40.913
not so much in India.

00:46:41.034 --> 00:46:47.236
But there are certain cultural differences, I think,

00:46:47.357 --> 00:46:49.559
that’s why people say like that.

00:46:49.712 --> 00:46:51.671
Here if somebody says like that,

00:46:51.792 --> 00:46:54.155
people will think that person is mad or that

00:46:54.276 --> 00:46:57.155
something is wrong with him, the way he talks.

00:46:57.276 --> 00:47:02.671
It is important how you express your love,

00:47:02.792 --> 00:47:06.631
how you talk about your love.

00:47:06.752 --> 00:47:10.115
Start it with your wife, to begin with,

00:47:10.236 --> 00:47:14.954
and then you can move towards your children and other people.

00:47:15.034 --> 00:47:17.196
And we are so stupid sometimes,

00:47:17.317 --> 00:47:21.357
that we love the whole world but we can’t love our wives!

00:47:21.478 --> 00:47:25.397
It’s a specialty! In India that’s very true,

00:47:25.518 --> 00:47:29.196
but also in the west I have seen people love their wives

00:47:29.317 --> 00:47:34.276
because of fear – fear of divorce maybe, I don’t know –.

00:47:35.155 --> 00:47:44.357
Love should have no fear. It should be just ‘free’ love.

00:47:44.599 --> 00:47:53.752
Without any fear, without any aggression, enjoy that pure love.

00:47:53.873 --> 00:48:00.357
And that is what is missing in the human beings today as it is.

00:48:00.478 --> 00:48:05.317
When the day will come when human beings will

00:48:05.397 --> 00:48:10.994
be understanding the beauty of love,

00:48:09.935 --> 00:48:18.414
then from the heavens there will be flowers falling on us,

00:48:18.484 --> 00:48:24.888
it would be such a tremendous day when

00:48:29.041 --> 00:48:34.888
Mahadeva will be able to close his Third Eye

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.242
and would be peaceful in his heart.

00:48:38.363 --> 00:48:41.565
It is my vision.

00:48:41.686 --> 00:48:45.686
It’s the future for you;

00:48:45.807 --> 00:48:52.404
to see how peacefully you can talk to people,

00:48:52.525 --> 00:48:58.605
how sweetly you can love others,

00:48:59.283 --> 00:49:02.888
how much you can give to others.

00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:09.121
For example, they have to give something,

00:49:09.363 --> 00:49:13.242
they’ll go in the market and buy the cheapest,

00:49:13.363 --> 00:49:17.565
the rottenest thing for giving.

00:49:18.686 --> 00:49:21.000
That’s not the way.

00:49:21.121 --> 00:49:27.525
You must buy small or big, whatever it is, out of love!

00:49:27.646 --> 00:49:30.525
That (thing) should talk about your love,

00:49:30.646 --> 00:49:32.960
tell about your love,

00:49:33.081 --> 00:49:37.041
and not about your money and what you have spent.

00:49:37.162 --> 00:49:41.202
It’s very common nowadays, even in India,

00:49:41.323 --> 00:49:47.646
that people try to show how much they are worth,

00:49:47.767 --> 00:49:51.686
what they wear, how they dress up.

00:49:51.807 --> 00:50:00.928
For what? For what? I’ve known such people, very many,

00:50:01.081 --> 00:50:04.404
and when they die there are not even four people available

00:50:04.525 --> 00:50:07.525
to carry their dead bodies!

00:50:07.646 --> 00:50:11.283
When they lived they think no end of themselves.

00:50:11.444 --> 00:50:18.000
That time, you should see how many people there are

00:50:18.686 --> 00:50:23.605
to love that person, to care for that person.

00:50:23.726 --> 00:50:28.888
Maybe it is the upbringing,

00:50:29.041 --> 00:50:31.767
maybe, that he had never known love,

00:50:31.888 --> 00:50:33.888
anything you may blame.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.323
But for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to learn

00:50:38.444 --> 00:50:46.484
that love is your life, love is spirituality, and love

00:50:46.605 --> 00:50:51.646
– without expectations – to do something.

00:50:51.767 --> 00:50:55.525
Some people are, I know, very good at helping

00:50:55.646 --> 00:50:58.121
poor people, this, that.

00:50:58.242 --> 00:51:04.202
But behind that is the power that …

00:51:06.121 --> 00:51:09.686
They think “Oh, we are great, we are doing this work, that work”

00:51:09.807 --> 00:51:14.242
just to satisfy their power, not their love.

00:51:14.363 --> 00:51:17.646
So when you are working,

00:51:17.767 --> 00:51:23.041
you have to know that it’s just to satisfy your Spirit,

00:51:23.162 --> 00:51:27.121
just to satisfy your love that you are doing it,

00:51:27.242 --> 00:51:34.767
not for any name or for any kind of a position.

00:51:34.888 --> 00:51:43.323
If you have that kind of a detached love,

00:51:43.444 --> 00:51:49.960
virakta as they call it, then nobody has to certify you.

00:51:50.081 --> 00:51:56.121
You have it, and you are enjoying it!

00:51:58.807 --> 00:52:04.242
It is unfortunate I have to speak in English language,

00:52:04.363 --> 00:52:08.565
and maybe there are some who do not understand English,

00:52:08.686 --> 00:52:13.686
but nowadays English has become dominating, what to do?

00:52:13.807 --> 00:52:17.323
You have to suppose people will read  English language.

00:52:17.444 --> 00:52:21.202
I can’t use any other language.

00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:27.888
But one has to speak the language of love.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.686
You see animals, you see if you have a horse

00:52:33.807 --> 00:52:35.605
and if you have a dog,

00:52:35.726 --> 00:52:42.444
all these animals, they understand your love;

00:52:42.928 --> 00:52:49.283
how they stick to you, how they express their love,

00:52:49.404 --> 00:52:51.928
they are very sweet.

00:52:53.081 --> 00:52:58.041
And this we have to learn from them now, I think.

00:52:58.162 --> 00:53:02.767
Otherwise I don’t know how to make them understand

00:53:02.847 --> 00:53:05.605
the value of love.

00:53:06.726 --> 00:53:14.928
It is not that the way people are criticising:

00:53:15.041 --> 00:53:20.484
that we are not practical, that we have not

00:53:20.605 --> 00:53:29.242
achieved much money or power or something, that’s not important.

00:53:29.767 --> 00:53:35.041
Because there are many like that selling in the market.

00:53:35.484 --> 00:53:43.726
But we are different. We are the jewels of humanity,

00:53:43.847 --> 00:53:47.000
and we have to be like that, shining,

00:53:47.121 --> 00:53:52.202
cutting out all the wrong things within us

00:53:52.323 --> 00:53:59.565
as a diamond is cut to look something very, very great.

00:54:00.404 --> 00:54:08.121
My only, if I have any desire, is that:

00:54:08.242 --> 00:54:16.081
‘Try to follow the qualities of Shri Mahadeva’.

00:54:16.726 --> 00:54:26.888
How great he is, how detached he is, detached, absolutely detached.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:34.202
He lives with bones and things like that.

00:54:34.847 --> 00:54:38.686
He is not bothered about where he is, what he lives with,

00:54:38.807 --> 00:54:41.960
what he has, nothing.

00:54:42.444 --> 00:54:47.283
So detached, and we should be detached like that.

00:54:47.404 --> 00:54:52.484
At the same time, we should be very loving like him,

00:54:52.605 --> 00:54:55.960
extremely loving.

00:54:56.081 --> 00:55:00.646
How his heart is full of love for others,

00:55:00.767 --> 00:55:03.646
how he looks after others.

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:10.323
I am warning you, because I know you all love me very much,

00:55:10.444 --> 00:55:13.726
but you should also love each other,

00:55:13.847 --> 00:55:16.847
you should have a loving heart,

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:22.323
and have satisfaction in loving others.

00:55:22.444 --> 00:55:27.404
If you could develop that, your height will grow,

00:55:27.525 --> 00:55:32.484
your depth in Sahaja Yoga will grow.

00:55:32.605 --> 00:55:37.928
It’s alright, the Goddess gives you the shraddha, alright,

00:55:38.081 --> 00:55:42.242
but the depth in shraddha,

00:55:43.444 --> 00:55:48.081
in Sanskrit, or in Hindi and Marathi I don’t know,

00:55:48.202 --> 00:55:52.404
but in Marathi they call it dyas.

00:55:52.525 --> 00:55:59.041
Just deep in to that love, drenched in to that love,

00:55:59.162 --> 00:56:02.283
enjoying that love – then you don’t want anything.

00:56:02.404 --> 00:56:07.000
What do you want? You’ve got everything.

00:56:07.121 --> 00:56:09.605
So what do you want now?

00:56:09.726 --> 00:56:18.242
Just like the greatness of Shri Mahadeva.

00:56:18.363 --> 00:56:24.081
He’s so great that he’s detached.

00:56:24.202 --> 00:56:28.000
What does he want? I mean nothing is greater than him,

00:56:28.121 --> 00:56:32.404
nothing is more important than him. Then what does he want?

00:56:32.525 --> 00:56:38.242
He doesn’t want anything. That’s why he’s detached.

00:56:38.363 --> 00:56:43.847
This detachment you have to develop.

00:56:43.928 --> 00:56:50.081
But at the same time he is the Lord of all the arts,

00:56:50.202 --> 00:56:54.484
of the music, of the rhythm.

00:56:54.605 --> 00:56:59.000
The other day you saw these boys were playing the rhythm.

00:56:59.121 --> 00:57:02.726
The whole rhythm of everything he gives.

00:57:02.847 --> 00:57:11.323
The rhythmic life that we have, we are not yet aware of it.

00:57:11.444 --> 00:57:21.081
See a child is born exactly after nine months and so-many days.

00:57:21.202 --> 00:57:24.242
Who keeps this rhythm?

00:57:25.162 --> 00:57:30.162
Then we get, say, certain flowers at such-and-such time,

00:57:30.283 --> 00:57:36.646
then we get in the nature all kinds of seasons.

00:57:36.767 --> 00:57:39.041
Who keeps the rhythm?

00:57:39.162 --> 00:57:44.121
He is the one who is nothing but rhythm!

00:57:44.242 --> 00:57:48.888
And that rhythm is kept up, in the nature,

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.242
in everything there is a rhythm.

00:57:52.363 --> 00:57:59.323
And a rhythmic person is the one who has a very large heart!

00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:03.081
It’s like an ocean.

00:58:03.202 --> 00:58:08.404
You get just that rhythm disturbed immediately if you

00:58:08.525 --> 00:58:13.888
find somebody who is being very cruel, very bad and all that.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:22.525
But in a smooth, beautiful, peaceful lake,

00:58:22.646 --> 00:58:27.283
there is no ripple at all, it is just love.

00:58:27.363 --> 00:58:30.565
And then at that time, if the rhythm,

00:58:30.686 --> 00:58:35.807
the silent rhythm of that heart is broken,

00:58:35.928 --> 00:58:39.041
then Shiva takes charge.

00:58:39.162 --> 00:58:46.525
So one has to have a complete sense of the rhythm of time,

00:58:46.646 --> 00:58:51.888
rhythm of nature, rhythm of everything.

00:58:52.041 --> 00:58:55.363
People don’t know even the names of the flowers.

00:58:55.484 --> 00:58:58.565
They don’t know what these flowers are,

00:58:58.686 --> 00:59:01.525
what time they come up;

00:59:01.646 --> 00:59:08.444
they have no idea what is the rhythm of their ‘living’

00:59:08.565 --> 00:59:10.525
– nobody’s bothered.

00:59:10.646 --> 00:59:15.767
All over, if you see, there is seasons and things.

00:59:15.888 --> 00:59:22.283
So all the rhythm, like his play, with tabla or pakwaj

00:59:22.404 --> 00:59:30.283
on which he played all the beautiful tunes of all the seasons.

00:59:30.404 --> 00:59:34.202
And that’s how the nature flourishes

00:59:34.323 --> 00:59:39.081
and comes up and then subsides.

00:59:39.202 --> 00:59:42.162
We do not see that point.

00:59:42.242 --> 00:59:46.242
We are just bothered about ourselves.

00:59:46.363 --> 00:59:48.686
Like I’ll ask “How are you?”

00:59:48.807 --> 00:59:52.363
“Mother, I’ve got a headache, I’ve got a stomach trouble,

00:59:52.484 --> 00:59:57.000
I have another trouble” … or everything is there.

00:59:57.121 --> 01:00:02.484
But another one would say “Ah, I’m alright!”

01:00:02.605 --> 01:00:04.242
“So, what’s the matter?”

01:00:04.363 --> 01:00:06.565
“Put the world right Mamma!

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:09.081
Mother, why don’t you put the world right?”

01:00:09.202 --> 01:00:14.960
He’s worried about others, not about himself.

01:00:15.081 --> 01:00:21.081
And in that understanding of what one should do

01:00:21.202 --> 01:00:24.807
to make this world happy, beautiful,

01:00:24.928 --> 01:00:29.686
for that one has to really work hard, so called,

01:00:29.807 --> 01:00:33.847
and in that working one thinks,

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.041
“Isn’t it our duty to make this world beautiful?

01:00:40.162 --> 01:00:43.525
Isn’t it our job to make

01:00:43.646 --> 01:00:48.767
this world rhythmic, rhyming with the Spirit?”

01:00:48.888 --> 01:00:51.928
It’s our duty. We have to do it!

01:00:52.041 --> 01:00:58.525
Not only taking Sahaja Yoga for yourself, but for others.

01:00:58.646 --> 01:01:02.121
It’s not you are all the time worried about yourself,

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:05.847
but you are worried about others,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.847
what’s happening in the world.

01:01:09.928 --> 01:01:15.888
That is love! That love is spontaneous,

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.404
and when it works, it works wonders.

01:01:25.484 --> 01:01:30.404
So this is a beautiful evening,

01:01:31.202 --> 01:01:42.767
where we are worshipping such a great source of our ascent.

01:01:42.888 --> 01:01:48.283
And I hope you people will understand

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:52.960
how far you are with that force,

01:01:53.081 --> 01:01:58.162
how much are you drenched in that force,

01:01:58.283 --> 01:02:04.807
in that rhythm of Shiva,

01:02:04.928 --> 01:02:10.283
who, in his rhythmic way, gives you vibrations.

01:02:10.404 --> 01:02:15.081
Vibrations flow in the way we live,

01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:20.960
and that way should engulf you completely;

01:02:21.081 --> 01:02:25.726
and you should be asked in that your ‘I-ness’

01:02:25.847 --> 01:02:29.726
should be dissolved in that which is I bless you.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:31.363
Thank you.

01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:56.296
Today we have a Ganesha Puja, a small Ganesha Puja,

01:02:56.417 --> 01:03:00.678
then Shiva Puja and then the Devi’s Puja.

01:03:00.823 --> 01:03:02.673
May God Bless You
