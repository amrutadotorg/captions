00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.365
Final Day of India Tour
Bordi (India), 9 February 1985

01:29:44.611 --> 01:29:48.730
[Shri Mataji arrives: “You all have got
photographs?

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:58.042
All of you have got photographs.”

01:29:58.275 --> 01:30:01.244
Shri Mataji is then told that a group
of yogis would like

01:30:01.445 --> 01:30:06.711
to sing a song called “The Extollation
of the Devi”,

01:30:06.912 --> 01:30:10.830
from the 1st Chapter of the Devi Mahatmyam:

01:30:51.824 --> 01:30:55.403
Shri Mataji: “Alright, please, start”.

01:31:09.089 --> 01:31:14.188
“O You who are the Soul of everything,

01:31:14.418 --> 01:31:19.047
Who is capable of extolling You?

01:31:19.248 --> 01:31:22.363
Eternal and Imperishable One,

01:31:22.564 --> 01:31:27.611
You are the embodiment of the Sacred Word,

01:31:27.812 --> 01:31:34.429
You are Savitri and the Supreme Mother
of the Devas.

01:31:34.630 --> 01:31:39.194
By You this universe is born,

01:31:39.395 --> 01:31:44.439
by You this world is created,

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.475
By You it is protected, O Devi,

01:31:49.676 --> 01:31:55.498
And You always consume it at the end.

01:31:55.699 --> 01:32:02.234
O You who are always of the form
Of the whole world,

01:32:02.435 --> 01:32:10.540
At the time of creation, You are
of the form of the creative force,

01:32:10.744 --> 01:32:18.529
At the time of sustentation, You are
of the form of the protective power,

01:32:18.730 --> 01:32:22.469
And at the time of the dissolution
of the world,

01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:27.937
You are of the form of the destructive
power.

01:32:28.138 --> 01:32:34.585
You are the supreme knowledge
As well as the great nescience,

01:32:34.786 --> 01:32:39.648
The great intellect and contemplation,

01:32:39.849 --> 01:32:44.007
As also the great delusion,

01:32:44.208 --> 01:32:50.369
The great Devi as also the great asuri.

01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:55.725
You are the primordial cause of everything,

01:32:55.926 --> 01:33:00.993
Bringing into force the three qualities,

01:33:01.194 --> 01:33:06.870
You are the dark night of periodic
dissolution

01:33:07.071 --> 01:33:10.938
You are the great night of final
dissolution,

01:33:11.138 --> 01:33:16.303
And the terrible night of delusion.

01:33:16.504 --> 01:33:20.942
You are the Goddess of good fortune,

01:33:21.143 --> 01:33:25.088
The ruler, modesty, intelligence

01:33:25.911 --> 01:33:29.446
Characterized by knowledge;

01:33:29.647 --> 01:33:34.354
Bashfulness, Nourishment, contentment,

01:33:34.555 --> 01:33:39.015
Tranquillity and forbearance.

01:33:39.216 --> 01:33:45.390
Armed with sword, spear, club, discus,
conch,

01:33:45.591 --> 01:33:51.188
Bow, arrows, slings and iron mace,

01:33:51.389 --> 01:33:57.013
You are terrible and at the same time,
You are pleasing;

01:33:57.214 --> 01:34:05.343
Yea more pleasing than all the pleasing
Things and exceedingly beautiful”.

01:34:05.544 --> 01:34:09.734
Om Twamewa Sakshat,

01:34:09.935 --> 01:34:17.749
Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,
Mahakali,

01:34:17.950 --> 01:34:24.072
Trigunatmika, Kundalini Sakshat,

01:34:24.273 --> 01:34:27.438
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:34:27.639 --> 01:34:34.212
Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namaha.

01:34:34.413 --> 01:34:38.604
Om Twamewa Sakshat,

01:34:38.805 --> 01:34:42.857
Shri Kalki Sakshat,

01:34:43.058 --> 01:34:46.209
Shri Adi Shakti,

01:34:46.410 --> 01:34:52.933
Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namaha.

01:34:53.190 --> 01:34:57.941
Om Twamewa Sakshat (...)

01:35:47.579 --> 01:35:51.188
On this occasion when you are all leaving
me,

01:35:51.389 --> 01:35:54.518
it’s rather hard to listen to these
qualities

01:35:54.719 --> 01:35:59.302
described in your beautiful song.

01:36:06.434 --> 01:36:16.062
My words are so loaded with a feeling
of extreme sadness,

01:36:17.019 --> 01:36:29.434
plus the exuberance of new ventures,

01:36:29.635 --> 01:36:32.606
some ideas that I have to do much more

01:36:32.807 --> 01:36:37.486
to establish whatever you are describing
me.

01:36:38.185 --> 01:36:44.182
So many rakshasa are to be killed as you
have described me.

01:36:45.016 --> 01:36:49.765
All the disparities are to be removed
from this world.

01:36:49.966 --> 01:36:52.677
All the ignorance, the darkness,
the chimera

01:36:52.878 --> 01:36:56.843
has to be removed, as you have described
me.

01:36:57.044 --> 01:37:01.722
It is very easy to destroy this world

01:37:02.044 --> 01:37:10.909
and it was easier to destroy the demons
and the devils,

01:37:11.132 --> 01:37:14.619
but today the time is so precarious

01:37:14.820 --> 01:37:21.019
that all these have entered into
the brains,

01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:27.114
the Sahasrara of many seekers.

01:37:27.315 --> 01:37:30.798
So, it’s a very delicate task

01:37:30.999 --> 01:37:37.346
to remove those horrible influences

01:37:37.563 --> 01:37:43.262
to save the seekers from the clutches
of these devils.

01:37:44.089 --> 01:37:48.549
You have been very kind to understand

01:37:49.609 --> 01:37:55.987
that it is a very delicate thing and we
cannot do it

01:37:56.188 --> 01:38:01.136
with harshness, with bluntness, with
straightforward statements.

01:38:01.337 --> 01:38:07.302
We have to take them round because they
are hard rocks

01:38:07.503 --> 01:38:12.886
and make them understand through
compassion,

01:38:13.087 --> 01:38:17.869
love and complete concern.

01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:21.532
Discretion is the only way we can manage

01:38:21.733 --> 01:38:28.695
and one has to use all kinds of methods
of discretion to save these people.

01:38:28.896 --> 01:38:32.343
Once a maximum number is saved,

01:38:32.544 --> 01:38:35.956
the rakshasas can be destroyed.

01:38:36.157 --> 01:38:40.734
As it is they are so much exposed now,
they are getting destroyed

01:38:40.935 --> 01:38:43.204
by themselves, by their own behaviour.

01:38:43.405 --> 01:38:47.997
That’s the best about the falsehood, that
it shows itself.

01:38:48.198 --> 01:38:51.905
The effects are shown.

01:38:53.135 --> 01:38:58.856
In the process we also find

01:38:59.057 --> 01:39:05.847
that the effects of these devils are still
in our behaviour sometimes lingering.

01:39:06.048 --> 01:39:10.177
So all the Sahaja Yogis who have been
to other false gurus should be careful

01:39:10.378 --> 01:39:15.074
so that they should not be any more
dominated when they are ascending.

01:39:15.275 --> 01:39:18.306
Also there are other effects of our past,

01:39:18.507 --> 01:39:22.469
our aggressiveness, our incompatibility,

01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:26.997
our anti-collective activities.

01:39:27.213 --> 01:39:29.897
All this comes from the grossness
of personality.

01:39:30.098 --> 01:39:33.330
As soon as your grossness becomes subtler
and subtler

01:39:33.531 --> 01:39:41.986
you’ll merge, dissolve into the collective
understanding, very easily.

01:39:42.187 --> 01:39:55.477
Now, the things that I have to do sometimes
looks like mountainous

01:39:55.754 --> 01:40:01.686
and I seek your help in every way.

01:40:01.887 --> 01:40:06.291
I cannot do it alone, so I seek your help

01:40:06.492 --> 01:40:10.513
and I ask for your guidance in many ways,

01:40:10.715 --> 01:40:15.015
because human beings are not easy
to understand.

01:40:15.215 --> 01:40:19.192
You have to ask human beings what they
are up to.

01:40:19.393 --> 01:40:23.221
Now, the first task is ahead of you is
to save yourself

01:40:23.422 --> 01:40:27.566
from negativity from within, from within.

01:40:27.767 --> 01:40:30.184
You might find one or two murmuring souls
here and there

01:40:30.385 --> 01:40:33.236
talking nonsense about the programme
we had,

01:40:33.437 --> 01:40:35.822
the tour we had, the way we went round,

01:40:36.023 --> 01:40:40.278
about nonsensical things, which has no
meaning to the spiritual life.

01:40:40.479 --> 01:40:43.961
Or maybe some people who would be grudging
about something else,

01:40:44.162 --> 01:40:46.423
whose attentions have been on some other
things.

01:40:46.624 --> 01:40:50.281
So forget about them, because you should
worry about your ascent.

01:40:50.482 --> 01:40:56.334
The negativity can also come from your
own understanding of things.

01:40:56.535 --> 01:41:02.303
My only effort was to see that you forget
the rest of the world

01:41:02.504 --> 01:41:07.092
and start ascending in collectivity,

01:41:07.293 --> 01:41:10.056
as well as in your own spiritual growth.

01:41:10.257 --> 01:41:14.732
These are so simultaneous that I cannot
differentiate between the two.

01:41:14.933 --> 01:41:19.077
Like the sun when it rises the sunshine
comes. It’s like that.

01:41:19.278 --> 01:41:22.237
So, one has to be very careful about this
point,

01:41:22.438 --> 01:41:27.034
that when you go from here, anybody who
starts talking

01:41:27.235 --> 01:41:32.200
in the anti-way, just put your hands
on your ears

01:41:32.401 --> 01:41:37.275
and say that, “This is not… We don’t want
to hear. Please don’t make us pull down”.

01:41:37.476 --> 01:41:43.111
Because they’ll pull you down and some who
are half-baked Sahaja Yogis will fall down.

01:41:43.312 --> 01:41:45.613
I hope all those who have come will stick

01:41:45.814 --> 01:41:48.343
to what they have achieved, what they
have felt,

01:41:48.544 --> 01:41:52.446
what they have understood and go further
with it.

01:41:52.647 --> 01:42:00.046
The wholesomeness, the wholesomeness
of the experience is to be envisaged,

01:42:00.247 --> 01:42:04.156
to be felt when you are gone from here.

01:42:04.357 --> 01:42:09.245
Just to think of it, the memory of that,
the Mahakali Shakti of that

01:42:09.446 --> 01:42:13.740
will give you all the beautiful
experiences,

01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:17.336
the shiver, which we call the shiver
of the experiences

01:42:17.537 --> 01:42:22.419
and you will enjoy the thrills that you
had in India,

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:24.930
again back when you are in that country.

01:42:25.130 --> 01:42:27.761
And those thrills will fill the atmosphere.

01:42:27.962 --> 01:42:30.428
The atmosphere changes tremendously.

01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:33.137
When the Sahaja Yogis increase in sizes,

01:42:33.338 --> 01:42:37.080
the atmosphere changes and the climate
changes.

01:42:37.281 --> 01:42:40.255
Not only that, but human beings also start
changing.

01:42:40.456 --> 01:42:44.569
So it is necessary for us to have more and
more people coming to it.

01:42:44.770 --> 01:42:47.508
So now, first your own negativity is to be
seen.

01:42:47.709 --> 01:42:50.720
Then, you must see it among Sahaja Yogis,
we are one.

01:42:50.921 --> 01:42:52.811
Never criticize another Sahaja Yogi.

01:42:53.012 --> 01:42:55.619
Never talk to other Sahaja Yogi harshly.

01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:58.530
We are very kind to other people, because
we know that

01:42:58.731 --> 01:43:04.367
if we talk like this to another person that
person will not accept it and he will react.

01:43:04.568 --> 01:43:07.561
But with Sahaja Yoga many people try,
I have seen, to talk to each other

01:43:07.761 --> 01:43:11.327
in a very rough manner and sometimes

01:43:11.528 --> 01:43:15.311
in the organization also they try
to aggress.

01:43:15.512 --> 01:43:20.257
Like some arrangement is there so they’ll
say, “Why not this?”

01:43:20.458 --> 01:43:24.845
Try to give up most of the things that you
want to say.

01:43:25.046 --> 01:43:30.263
Is very simple, like that. That, now
supposing say to have this colour.

01:43:30.464 --> 01:43:33.234
Just keep quiet, see what happens.

01:43:33.435 --> 01:43:35.815
Because you think you can give a suggestion
you just

01:43:36.016 --> 01:43:37.969
give a suggestion, because you must say
something.

01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:40.689
Not necessary. Not necessary.

01:43:40.890 --> 01:43:43.926
Because you have seen in Japan, only one
person speaks.

01:43:44.127 --> 01:43:48.045
You see, if there is necessary to say
something, then you should say.

01:43:48.246 --> 01:43:52.166
Otherwise, unnecessarily, just to create
a new idea,

01:43:52.367 --> 01:43:56.949
a new theme, a new stuff, is not proper.

01:43:58.409 --> 01:44:02.603
Now, the main thing about Sahaja Yoga
is this,

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:05.938
that it does not belong to any country.

01:44:06.139 --> 01:44:10.317
It belongs to the country that is God’s
kingdom.

01:44:10.518 --> 01:44:13.283
So it’s a very different thing into which
you have landed.

01:44:13.484 --> 01:44:16.666
Once you realize this, once you accept
this situation

01:44:16.867 --> 01:44:20.399
that you have now entered into the kingdom
of God,

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:22.710
your sense of security will be built up,

01:44:22.911 --> 01:44:27.598
your style will [be] built up, your
behaviour will improve,

01:44:27.798 --> 01:44:30.133
your attitude towards yourself will improve

01:44:30.334 --> 01:44:36.504
and you will really feel you have jumped
into the sea, the ocean of joy.

01:44:36.705 --> 01:44:40.351
Just assume the power. Assumption is very
difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

01:44:40.552 --> 01:44:44.316
Reality people assume with difficulties.

01:44:44.517 --> 01:44:47.006
If it is unreal, if somebody can mesmerize,
you believe it.

01:44:47.207 --> 01:44:52.786
So just believe that you are in the heaven
now.

01:44:52.987 --> 01:44:58.256
This is the kingdom of God and this is
where you have to be and enjoy that.

01:44:58.457 --> 01:45:02.427
You will be amazed. Once it happens,
all your seeking will end,

01:45:02.628 --> 01:45:05.870
all your frustrations will end and now you
will know

01:45:06.071 --> 01:45:09.343
that you have reached that situation where
now you have to give.

01:45:09.544 --> 01:45:11.756
Now you have become the light and light
has to give.

01:45:11.957 --> 01:45:14.840
That’s the job of the light and you will
not be any more bothered

01:45:15.041 --> 01:45:17.714
about how to keep light going, because
once you start

01:45:17.915 --> 01:45:21.918
giving it that way it freely moves.

01:45:22.872 --> 01:45:26.512
The collectivity cannot come with mediocre
efforts.

01:45:26.713 --> 01:45:30.060
Like many people think that if you invite
people for tea

01:45:30.261 --> 01:45:32.747
or something like that, then the some
more people will come.

01:45:32.948 --> 01:45:34.820
Such people never stay.

01:45:35.021 --> 01:45:39.538
Or those people who like very sweet words
to be said to them and all that,

01:45:39.739 --> 01:45:42.303
they just come for a picnic sort
of a thing,

01:45:42.504 --> 01:45:48.914
have a very sweet sitting down, some sort
of a group, and then they disappear.

01:45:49.115 --> 01:45:52.147
So, we have to have people who are
of quality.

01:45:52.348 --> 01:45:54.618
To begin with we have to have people
of quality,

01:45:54.818 --> 01:45:57.828
to end with also we have to have people
with quality.

01:45:58.029 --> 01:46:01.499
The people who are peripheral are headaches
for Sahaja Yoga.

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:03.774
They come, trouble us from the sides.

01:46:03.982 --> 01:46:08.473
Like you see these skirmishes we have
from the outside,

01:46:08.674 --> 01:46:12.560
that’s how they come and just hit some
people on the outside and went – go away.

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:16.676
So the people who are on the periphery are
of no use to us.

01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:21.679
So try to have people of quality as far
as possible,  as many as you can.

01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:24.179
The popularity is not the point in Sahaja
Yoga.

01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:27.638
Is the quality, what you achieve and where
you reach.

01:46:27.839 --> 01:46:30.478
If the quality of the people is poor, just
give them up.

01:46:30.679 --> 01:46:32.364
Forget it, don’t argue with them,

01:46:32.565 --> 01:46:35.624
don’t try to persuade them, don’t try
to bring them.

01:46:35.825 --> 01:46:38.610
This is one of the understandings we should
have.

01:46:38.811 --> 01:46:41.422
We should not go on fighting for the whole
world.

01:46:41.623 --> 01:46:46.831
Where is the place in God’s heaven to fit
all these nonsensical people?

01:46:47.032 --> 01:46:49.374
There’s no room there. There’s no room.

01:46:49.575 --> 01:46:52.008
So better have it, because they don’t
deserve it.

01:46:52.209 --> 01:46:55.446
So don’t try to push such people into it.

01:46:55.647 --> 01:46:56.960
We are trying some experiments

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.789
with some people who are very difficult
and useless.

01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:01.475
We are trying to push them here and there.

01:47:01.676 --> 01:47:04.934
If they do not work out, we’ll have to
throw them out. And you must accept it.

01:47:05.135 --> 01:47:07.344
There should be no compassion for such
people,

01:47:07.544 --> 01:47:10.999
but compassion for other Sahaja Yogis who
are suffering from them.

01:47:11.200 --> 01:47:13.343
That’s the best way to have compassion
is to understand

01:47:13.543 --> 01:47:16.656
these are saints and they are suffering
because of the negative people,

01:47:16.857 --> 01:47:20.990
so why push them into Sahaja Yoga and
trouble everyone?

01:47:21.191 --> 01:47:22.960
That’s not the way it should be.

01:47:23.161 --> 01:47:26.067
Now, so this is one of the things one
should understand

01:47:26.268 --> 01:47:29.290
when you are organizing, that have people
of quality.

01:47:29.491 --> 01:47:33.413
If you have ten people of quality will
create ten thousand tomorrow.

01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:35.639
But, if you have even one hopeless fellow,

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:37.840
it will kill even the rest of the nine.

01:47:38.041 --> 01:47:41.819
So be careful that you don’t allow people

01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:44.357
who are not of quality to come to puja.

01:47:44.558 --> 01:47:46.663
Outsiders should not come to puja.

01:47:46.864 --> 01:47:49.406
Only the people who are of quality should
come,

01:47:49.607 --> 01:47:53.473
and those who have been now travelling,
we have been noting

01:47:53.674 --> 01:47:56.683
how they have been behaving, how their
behaviour has been,

01:47:56.884 --> 01:48:01.474
how they have been progressing. We know
all about it, every one of them.

01:48:01.675 --> 01:48:04.875
So, we’ll see them, how they are
progressing further

01:48:05.076 --> 01:48:07.507
when I visit your countries and I’ll see
for it.

01:48:07.708 --> 01:48:10.196
And then, I’ll be able to tell you

01:48:10.397 --> 01:48:15.028
that such and such person has not
progressed at all.

01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:19.859
So, this should be the attitude that we all
should individually progress

01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:24.315
and once we progress individually it shows
in collective enjoyment.

01:48:24.516 --> 01:48:29.734
A person who cannot enjoy collectivity is
not a Sahaja Yogi.

01:48:29.935 --> 01:48:32.987
Now Leader can be only one; there cannot
be three leaders.

01:48:33.188 --> 01:48:37.132
Now for all purposes I have appointed Danny

01:48:37.333 --> 01:48:42.383
as the Leader of United Nations,
the United ...

01:48:42.584 --> 01:48:46.944
Ah, that’s the word, that’s the word,
that’s the word!

01:48:47.145 --> 01:48:53.506
Ah, we should say United States, but then
we have to have United Nations later on.

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:07.179
Because I find in Danny those qualities
which are required for a good Sahaja Yogi.

01:49:07.380 --> 01:49:10.954
He’s very congenial, he knows how to go
round people,

01:49:11.155 --> 01:49:15.037
he is very steadfast in his own ascent

01:49:15.238 --> 01:49:18.719
and he is a person who doesn’t shout
at people,

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:22.080
who doesn’t get angry with people too much,

01:49:22.281 --> 01:49:26.189
and I haven’t seen him getting angry with
anyone whatsoever, so far.

01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:28.005
I have been with him for so many days.

01:49:28.206 --> 01:49:32.190
And, he manages people very well and he
knows how to control them.

01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:35.236
But, he is extremely strong as far as
Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

01:49:35.437 --> 01:49:37.886
Extremely strong and he understands it.

01:49:38.087 --> 01:49:42.312
So, all these qualities can help you people
very much to understand

01:49:42.513 --> 01:49:44.682
how a leader should be. Moreover, he is
selfless.

01:49:44.883 --> 01:49:47.515
He has no selfish aims for anything
whatsoever,

01:49:47.716 --> 01:49:50.243
for his name, for his position, for
anything I have seen.

01:49:50.444 --> 01:49:53.871
He doesn’t mind anybody becoming a leader,
he doesn’t mind anything whatsoever.

01:49:54.072 --> 01:49:58.093
That sort of a thing should be that anybody
becomes a leader is just a joke.

01:49:58.294 --> 01:50:01.211
Otherwise, I have seen people, you make them
the trustees they just ride on the horse.

01:50:01.412 --> 01:50:03.702
You make them something, leader, they’ll
ride on the horse.

01:50:03.903 --> 01:50:07.494
All sorts of things happen. That should not
happen anymore,

01:50:07.695 --> 01:50:10.121
and the leaders must see to the point

01:50:10.322 --> 01:50:14.113
that they have to become really great
evolved avadhutas.

01:50:14.314 --> 01:50:15.848
Otherwise they cannot impress people.

01:50:16.049 --> 01:50:21.757
Avadhutas are the people who are
extremely compassionate, extremely kind.

01:50:21.958 --> 01:50:25.516
And for you I would say you should follow
the example of Tukarama,

01:50:25.717 --> 01:50:29.027
because he was such a kind and a sweet
person,

01:50:29.228 --> 01:50:35.560
but he said things which were very, very
deep and very straightforward.

01:50:35.761 --> 01:50:38.734
So the forthright behaviour need not be

01:50:38.934 --> 01:50:41.233
so sharp as to cut everybody through.

01:50:41.434 --> 01:50:44.093
Forthright could be such that it guides
the person

01:50:44.294 --> 01:50:47.730
in the proper way and the plying
of a person

01:50:47.931 --> 01:50:53.079
in this ocean of maya becomes easier.
That is what is called the leadership.

01:50:53.279 --> 01:50:55.629
Now leadership should not be challenged.

01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:58.916
Some people have too much ideas from
outside, because they think

01:50:59.117 --> 01:51:03.742
they are something, you see, they know, they
are administrators or they are journalists

01:51:03.943 --> 01:51:08.002
or they have worked as some sort of
a politicians or this and that,

01:51:08.203 --> 01:51:12.096
and they try to control the leaders -
is a wrong thing.

01:51:12.297 --> 01:51:14.939
So now do not try to control the leaders.

01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:17.348
If there’s something wrong I’ll correct
them.

01:51:17.549 --> 01:51:20.487
This is very important, because again and
again I tell you

01:51:20.688 --> 01:51:24.898
that once you start challenging the leader
I get the pangs of it.

01:51:25.099 --> 01:51:28.097
So, please do not do it. If you do not want
to hurt me,

01:51:28.298 --> 01:51:31.378
do not challenge the leader as he is.

01:51:31.579 --> 01:51:35.081
Now, as you are going away,

01:51:35.282 --> 01:51:39.260
you are taking all the sweet memories from
here of the Indians.

01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:45.371
You have to take their last, I should say,
the glimpse

01:51:45.572 --> 01:51:52.820
and also give them a promise that you will
write to them, thanking them,

01:51:53.021 --> 01:51:57.461
keep contact, have friends, write letters
to them, they will write to you.

01:51:57.662 --> 01:52:01.378
Let us have contacts and know what’s
happening, where, what is happening

01:52:01.579 --> 01:52:07.382
and thus we can have a nice circulation
and communication with each other

01:52:07.583 --> 01:52:11.337
and we can establish a better understanding

01:52:11.538 --> 01:52:15.331
of different countries through this method.

01:52:15.532 --> 01:52:21.828
Also, those who have come from other
countries, like say Australians have come,

01:52:22.029 --> 01:52:25.078
should write to English or they can write
to French

01:52:25.279 --> 01:52:27.319
or the French could write to Australians.

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:30.170
Like that there should be a big movement.

01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:31.871
The circulation has to be good.

01:52:32.072 --> 01:52:34.810
If the circulation is not good the body
gets sick,

01:52:35.011 --> 01:52:40.501
so the circulation has to be good and all
of you have to do that circulation

01:52:40.702 --> 01:52:46.460
in a way that is good, compassionate and
in a Sahaj manner.

01:52:46.661 --> 01:52:51.977
My own work does not finish.

01:52:52.178 --> 01:52:57.049
I am moving on now, as you know,
to another areas.

01:52:57.250 --> 01:53:00.179
Then I’ll be going to Calcutta. For
the first time we’ll be having

01:53:00.380 --> 01:53:02.429
programme in Calcutta in this way.

01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:08.728
And then I am going to Australia and again
back, New Zealand

01:53:08.929 --> 01:53:13.319
and back to India and then again back
to London and I go on moving.

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:17.733
You see mine is such a circuitous,
complicated roundabout ways.

01:53:17.934 --> 01:53:23.320
The sun has to do only one way. I’m going
this way, that way.

01:53:23.602 --> 01:53:26.815
All sorts of movements are there, nothing
regular.

01:53:27.016 --> 01:53:32.871
Absolutely it is regularly irregular. It is
like that.

01:53:33.072 --> 01:53:36.835
And it’s, still it’s working out.

01:53:37.038 --> 01:53:40.717
It works out with some sort of a rhythm
in it, I think.

01:53:40.918 --> 01:53:45.190
It pulsates and I feel quite happy with
that rhythmic movement.

01:53:45.391 --> 01:53:51.209
So, I have to pray that you look after
your health,

01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:54.529
look after your spiritual wealth

01:53:54.729 --> 01:54:00.084
and look after your Sahaja Yoga family
in your own countries.

01:54:00.285 --> 01:54:04.145
So may God bless you all.

01:54:05.717 --> 01:54:13.025
[Sentence in Marathi]

01:54:13.226 --> 01:54:18.009
I’m thanking them for looking after you
very much.

01:54:27.455 --> 01:54:31.261
They have, I mean, gone all the way out
in the villages

01:54:31.462 --> 01:54:37.135
and in very far-fetched places, and
whatever I asked them for

01:54:37.344 --> 01:54:43.088
they arranged the programmes in the actual
jungles and along the riversides,

01:54:43.289 --> 01:54:46.871
and all kinds of things they have done,
just to make you

01:54:47.072 --> 01:54:51.075
feel happy and away from the madding crowd.

01:54:51.276 --> 01:54:55.214
All this has worked out, only because
of their cooperation,

01:54:55.415 --> 01:54:58.519
without any reward, without anything.

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:02.430
They have to take leave, giving up their
jobs and coming down.

01:55:02.631 --> 01:55:06.194
Everything they have done so well that
we can see

01:55:06.395 --> 01:55:09.768
that how in a place like Brahmapuri which
is such a far-fetched place,

01:55:09.969 --> 01:55:13.526
or in a place like Sangli where we had
no rooms or anything,

01:55:13.727 --> 01:55:16.263
they arranged all these tents, and all
that overnight

01:55:16.464 --> 01:55:19.464
for you people to stay and to enjoy your
stay there.

01:55:19.665 --> 01:55:24.546
So, if there was some sort of a problem
you must understand

01:55:24.747 --> 01:55:28.110
that we don’t have tents easily available
in India.

01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:31.431
We have to make them. We haven’t got
all these facilities

01:55:31.631 --> 01:55:35.065
as you have for camping, because you are
so fond of camping there

01:55:35.266 --> 01:55:38.100
that if you go to a shop you can get
everything for camping.

01:55:38.301 --> 01:55:42.078
Here you have to make everything. You just
cannot get things for camping, because

01:55:42.279 --> 01:55:45.497
somehow Indians have no time for
camping at all,

01:55:45.698 --> 01:55:48.755
and they have no part time for taking
a holiday,

01:55:48.956 --> 01:55:51.059
and neither they go for a holiday,

01:55:51.260 --> 01:55:53.394
and I was the other day surprised.
Somebody told me

01:55:53.595 --> 01:55:57.676
that he took a taxi and went to south
of India for a trip.

01:55:57.877 --> 01:56:02.488
I was really surprised. How could he do it,
because normally this is seldom done,

01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:06.058
and is a good idea to go down like that,
meet other Sahaja Yogis

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:09.141
and have a little travel. But they just
don’t move.

01:56:09.342 --> 01:56:11.167
They’re like Ganeshas. Once set in one
place,

01:56:11.368 --> 01:56:16.825
they are set till they are put in the sea.

01:56:17.722 --> 01:56:20.805
So, it was very remarkable how so many
people have come

01:56:21.006 --> 01:56:24.284
from Delhi, all the way, and I thank them
for coming down

01:56:24.485 --> 01:56:29.314
and making this occasion so auspicious
and so beautiful.

01:56:36.023 --> 01:56:38.992
Specially, I have to thank Madras Sahaja
Yogis

01:56:39.193 --> 01:56:41.994
who have come all the way from Madras,
it’s so far away,

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:46.469
to come here and to join us.

01:56:51.403 --> 01:56:54.865
Of course, the Maharashtra Sahaja Yogis are
to be thanked again and again

01:56:55.066 --> 01:56:58.409
for looking after us so well.

01:57:08.197 --> 01:57:12.156
I hope one day we’ll be able to invite them
to your different countries

01:57:12.386 --> 01:57:15.790
and can have some seminars like this.
One day, might be.

01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:18.345
Such a day might come when we will be
able to do it,

01:57:18.546 --> 01:57:23.357
when we’ll have our own ship and people
can travel on the ship.

01:57:25.528 --> 01:57:30.823
Yogi: Bolo Jaganmata Shri Nirmala Devi ki!
Yogis: Jai!

01:57:31.024 --> 01:57:36.151
Shri Mataji: And, I have such ideas. You
see, I’m too enthusiastic [fantastic?].

01:57:36.857 --> 01:57:38.846
I have tremendous ideas. If I tell you,

01:57:39.047 --> 01:57:43.030
you’ll be all jumping in the air, so I
don’t want to tell you all of them.

01:57:43.231 --> 01:57:46.150
But it materializes. Somehow or other,
my ideas materialize,

01:57:46.351 --> 01:57:51.691
and we should have such a seminar that we
can celebrate it on a ship,

01:57:51.892 --> 01:57:54.949
where the ship moves throughout the world,
and we meet

01:57:55.150 --> 01:57:58.453
every corner and the shores of the world.
That would be a nice idea.

01:57:58.654 --> 01:58:01.693
For a month, if you travel, you can do it,
the whole world, I think.

01:58:01.894 --> 01:58:04.999
It’s not so difficult if you have a good,
nice ship,

01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:09.295
given us to us by IMO.

01:58:16.931 --> 01:58:19.545
So, this is hoping for the best.

01:58:19.746 --> 01:58:22.944
Now as it is, people are very helpful
in this country.

01:58:23.145 --> 01:58:24.783
The government is very helpful.

01:58:24.984 --> 01:58:26.881
We have seen the central government was
very helpful.

01:58:27.082 --> 01:58:29.832
The Customs were very helpful. All this
has happened

01:58:30.033 --> 01:58:32.487
because one person gets realization
in the Customs,

01:58:32.688 --> 01:58:35.523
he talks to another person, he gets all
the Custom people to do it.

01:58:35.724 --> 01:58:38.424
Then another person, a policeman, talks
to another policeman,

01:58:38.625 --> 01:58:39.986
all the policemen are there.

01:58:40.187 --> 01:58:42.582
But you see, the rapport in this country
is much more

01:58:42.783 --> 01:58:46.158
than it is otherwise because the climate
of this country is such

01:58:46.359 --> 01:58:49.763
that we are open, our houses are open,
we have an open home.

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:54.271
We live in an open way. In a village
everybody knows everyone.

01:58:54.472 --> 01:58:58.862
Say, in a city, now, in Nagpur if you tell
my father’s name everybody knows him.

01:58:59.063 --> 01:59:01.729
I mean, everybody knows me, everybody
knows my father,

01:59:01.930 --> 01:59:04.601
and I know them, so it’s like a big
rapport,

01:59:04.801 --> 01:59:07.817
and that’s an advantage we have which
we can create there

01:59:08.018 --> 01:59:12.583
with the sunshine of our love. So, even
those who are not Sahaja Yogis,

01:59:12.784 --> 01:59:15.637
try to be kind to them, try to be nice
to them.

01:59:15.838 --> 01:59:18.021
Don’t show that you are fanatics
or anything,

01:59:18.221 --> 01:59:20.321
but try to be sweet and nice. Try.

01:59:20.522 --> 01:59:23.497
If they can come, well and good, but do not
insist, do not force them.

01:59:23.698 --> 01:59:26.638
That’s the worst thing. Never force such
people to come in

01:59:26.839 --> 01:59:29.958
because such people, if they come, they
are very great troublesome people.

01:59:30.158 --> 01:59:31.881
They are of no gain to us,

01:59:32.081 --> 01:59:34.527
so just do not force anybody to come.

01:59:34.728 --> 01:59:39.760
They are your relations, brothers, sisters,
husband, wife, just forget them.

01:59:39.968 --> 01:59:42.860
If they want to come, let them come.
Otherwise, just forget them.

01:59:43.061 --> 01:59:47.527
Don’t bother your heads about them.
Now, regarding next tour,

01:59:47.728 --> 01:59:50.295
I don’t know how we’ll do, manage it
next year,

01:59:50.498 --> 01:59:52.642
but I’ll let you know about it in time

01:59:52.842 --> 01:59:55.683
so that we can arrange it in a better way
than this time.

01:59:55.891 --> 01:59:59.196
Maybe we might have again two tours,
I don’t know,

01:59:59.396 --> 02:00:01.952
or maybe fifteen days’ tours, or something
like that,

02:00:02.153 --> 02:00:08.768
so that we do two sides of tour in fifteen
days, something like that.

02:00:08.969 --> 02:00:12.286
So, we’ll try to evolve new ideas as you
have seen

02:00:12.487 --> 02:00:16.678
that realisation giving is becoming simpler
and simpler, and maybe

02:00:16.879 --> 02:00:19.397
that just attending the programme, people
might get realised.

02:00:19.608 --> 02:00:23.860
It may happen like that, one day in India.

02:00:30.718 --> 02:00:33.693
I would like to have sensible, proper,

02:00:33.894 --> 02:00:36.938
constructive ideas from you for your
country.

02:00:37.139 --> 02:00:39.914
That’s a very good idea, but do not
condemn somebody else

02:00:40.115 --> 02:00:42.213
and say that that fellow is like this and
that.

02:00:42.414 --> 02:00:44.709
That I don’t like at all because I know
who is who.

02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:48.887
So, just tell me if you have any
constructive ideas about this,

02:00:49.088 --> 02:00:51.370
about propagating, going to some new
countries.

02:00:51.571 --> 02:00:54.993
Like, Gregoire wanted to start something
in Greece,

02:00:55.193 --> 02:00:58.065
and there are some people who want to do it
in Greece also.

02:00:58.266 --> 02:01:01.136
So, we have to see how we can work it out
in Greece

02:01:01.337 --> 02:01:03.726
and we have to find out people who will
work it out

02:01:03.927 --> 02:01:06.690
in other places, wherever you think you
can do it.

02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:11.205
Like Tunisia, some people said (it) would
be a good idea to enter into.

02:01:11.406 --> 02:01:14.752
But you just work it out and let me know

02:01:14.953 --> 02:01:17.971
whatever countries you think we can do
this.

02:01:18.172 --> 02:01:21.349
Maybe Brazil, maybe another place,
one could go.

02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:24.663
But now I think, before I go there, some
of you should go,

02:01:24.864 --> 02:01:29.406
work it out, establish a centre, have
a proper centre running,

02:01:29.623 --> 02:01:32.933
and then I should go. It’s better.
Otherwise it is quite wasted.

02:01:33.134 --> 02:01:35.548
That’s how we are going to propagate
in the west.

02:01:35.757 --> 02:01:40.374
In the same way in India, also we have
to do the same.

02:01:40.575 --> 02:01:46.062
I used to propagate it in such a manner
that we ourselves travel a lot.

02:01:46.263 --> 02:01:49.852
Say we are living in a place like Delhi,
we can go along,

02:01:50.053 --> 02:01:52.846
meet people of different organizations,
talk to them

02:01:53.047 --> 02:01:56.963
and organize that we’ll come and talk.
It’s not necessary for me to go there.

02:01:57.164 --> 02:02:01.047
You can all talk and give lectures, in
different organizations,

02:02:01.248 --> 02:02:07.093
in different institutions and in different
municipalities and all that.

02:02:07.294 --> 02:02:09.755
In India it is much easier to organize
these lectures.

02:02:09.955 --> 02:02:12.193
Indians are very fond of listening
to lectures.

02:02:12.394 --> 02:02:15.842
So that would be a good idea. But for
westerners also,

02:02:16.043 --> 02:02:19.520
like in universities you can handle
professors and talk to them.

02:02:19.721 --> 02:02:22.801
On your own you can think of so many things
that you can do.

02:02:23.002 --> 02:02:27.298
And I’m sure one day will come that all
these efforts will work out.

02:02:27.499 --> 02:02:30.261
As I told you about Buddha’s disciples
used to do.

02:02:30.462 --> 02:02:33.075
And I need not go to all these various
places.

02:02:33.276 --> 02:02:37.267
You can manage it and seeing you only,
people will get to Sahaja Yoga

02:02:37.492 --> 02:02:41.194
much faster, because they’ll think, the One
who has given them this,

02:02:41.395 --> 02:02:44.901
if they are so great, then that the Person
who has given must be greater

02:02:45.124 --> 02:02:50.731
and I need not see them, because sometimes
they get disappointed to see me also.

02:02:51.170 --> 02:03:00.652
They think that a person who was talking to
us was very brilliant and this and that,

02:03:00.852 --> 02:03:06.935
and in my own svabhava of Mahamaya

02:03:07.136 --> 02:03:10.601
I try to fumble and sometimes make
mistakes,

02:03:10.802 --> 02:03:16.364
and try to become a simple housewife.

02:03:16.565 --> 02:03:21.901
And then people don’t understand that this
little housewife,

02:03:22.102 --> 02:03:26.054
a government servant’s wife, you see,
that’s another gone case,

02:03:26.263 --> 02:03:33.049
and then an Indian Christian and all that
thing, then she’s must be hopeless.

02:03:33.596 --> 02:03:37.895
So all these things, you see, make up
for the mind

02:03:38.096 --> 02:03:43.483
and that’s how the, one can go into
the final decision

02:03:43.684 --> 02:03:48.060
of the last judgment. You see, Mahamaya
is the only way

02:03:48.261 --> 02:03:50.575
one can judge people. There’s no other
way out.

02:03:50.776 --> 02:03:57.938
Those who can see through the Maya, only
such people will be redeemed.

02:03:58.139 --> 02:04:02.258
Those who cannot see through the Maya
cannot be redeemed.

02:04:02.459 --> 02:04:06.163
So Maya is important.

02:04:14.983 --> 02:04:19.315
Now the last, but not the least,

02:04:19.523 --> 02:04:23.614
remember that your Mother loves you
very much.

02:04:38.421 --> 02:04:41.338
Thank you very much.

02:04:46.437 --> 02:04:49.190
So now the different groups want to see me.

02:04:49.391 --> 02:04:52.322
The Australians are already here, quite
a lot.

02:04:52.561 --> 02:04:54.382
So, some more Australians who have come
can come.

02:04:54.636 --> 02:04:56.896
Warren: Let them be separate. They are
going tomorrow, Mother.

02:04:57.097 --> 02:05:00.733
Shri Mataji: All right, so those who are
going today.

02:05:00.934 --> 02:05:04.437
Warren: May I just make an announcement?

02:05:05.313 --> 02:05:09.401
Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji,

02:05:09.602 --> 02:05:12.441
the certain groups have got to have quick
little meetings themselves.

02:05:12.642 --> 02:05:16.859
So, if they may, they’ll just retreat
to the trees there,

02:05:17.060 --> 02:05:20.418
and other groups can come and see You here
in the front. Is that all right?

02:05:20.626 --> 02:05:22.157
Shri Mataji: You want me to go
to the trees?

02:05:22.358 --> 02:05:25.435
Warren: No, no, no, no, Shri Mataji.
They have to have little groups

02:05:25.651 --> 02:05:28.518
and administrative meetings about their
baggage, and there are certain books,

02:05:28.719 --> 02:05:31.230
Advents, and all these things that have
to be taken back.

02:05:31.431 --> 02:05:37.264
Shri Mataji: All right. Now, I’ve got three
books to be given.

02:05:38.635 --> 02:05:43.819
Warren: So, why don’t we have the Americans
here first?

02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:51.763
Gregoire: [unclear] Shri Mataji will now
see the Americans

02:05:51.964 --> 02:05:56.250
and someone will make liaison. Now,
all the national leaders,

02:05:56.451 --> 02:06:00.166
take your group along the pine trees here,

02:06:00.367 --> 02:06:03.599
and we’ll call you when Shri Mataji calls
another nation.

02:06:03.799 --> 02:06:06.751
Be fast, it has to be done fast [unclear].

02:06:06.952 --> 02:06:09.160
When you have your national group, you
can summarise

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:13.164
very quickly how to be part of the Spirit
of this place,

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:19.419
and speak also about the organizations,
and a few points that you have to do,

02:06:19.620 --> 02:06:22.590
notably, collecting these books, Advents,
and other things.

02:06:22.854 --> 02:06:27.073
So, I would suggest, now we, inside our
heart, we do our pranam to Shri Mataji…

02:06:27.274 --> 02:06:31.097
Shri Mataji: Danny!
Gregoire: All the Americans come here,

02:06:31.298 --> 02:06:34.790
and all the national groups meet here.
Jai Shri Mataji!

02:06:34.991 --> 02:06:37.412
Yogis: Jai Shri Mataji!
Gregoire: Now let us move fast.

02:06:37.627 --> 02:06:39.619
Warren: Americans means Canada and
the United States.

02:06:39.820 --> 02:06:42.887
Gregoire: Americans, means Canada and
the United States.

02:06:43.088 --> 02:06:44.294
Shri Mataji: Gregoire…
