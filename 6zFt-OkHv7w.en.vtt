00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Interviewer: I mean, there is a chance about all the books.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, You see, there is only one book

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
which is Patanjali,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and he has called it the Ashtanga Yoga long time back, [unclear].

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
With great, great aspects of yoga.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Like he stars, with the possibility of getting up the centres,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
tensing up the centers, and then goes forward to be,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.660
and it says that you have to have the Kundalini awakening.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.720
You have to[unclear] collective consciousness,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.000
and thoughtless awareness and ultimately you have to be connecting with the All-Pervading Power.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That's what he calls as Ritambhara Pragnya.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And you have to become doubtlessly aware, Nirvikalpa.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So these are the three-four stages.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But the main thing is that these people are taking part [unclear].

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
For example, if you say Hatha Yoga is a very big part, one-twenty-fourth of one part.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So it's not conceivable.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But you see this is also, must have full idea as to where is the blocking,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
for which one are you doing yoga.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If you start doing yoga like this, then you are taking all the medicines you see indiscriminately.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It's a big science of understanding.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So all these yoga systems, whatever is there,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
we used to be understood when the Kundalini starts moving,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and you go where is the blocking actually,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
then whatever is needed is to be done.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
For example this Raja Yoga, we call it.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Now Raja Yoga is also the same thing,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
as the start starts [unclear] and it starts working in such a way

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that all the things that are inside the car start working according to the need of the car.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The same way with the Kundalini rises, then it should not fall down.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So in every chakra, there is a bandhan stoping for falling,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and the tongue it's a little bit pushed in, but you won't feel it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I mean if somebody is a master, you won't feel anything,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
you just take a realization like that.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But this was all described.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Now so the what they did even up to this much,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
they started a Kriya Yoga, means that suppose it's Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Sahaja is spontaneous, Kriya is action yoga.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They started action yoga and in the action yoga,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
they even cut the tongue.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
You see in America you'll find some people,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
their tongues are cut from here, the thread,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and it's hanging on the end and just to push it back.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The bigger artificial thing like if you take out the wheels of a car,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
will the car move?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
It has to get ignited.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Ignition must be done, the car must get the ignition.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
What you say to the ignitions?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Ignition in a car.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So without that, if you start moving any instrument or anything,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
how can the car move? Artificial?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So all these people you see had very little knowledge here and there,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
some of them went to some great saints,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and the saints then turned them off,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
they thought we are no good, they taught them little asanas,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and that's what they're teaching.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
It's very dangerous.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Sahaja Yoga is for everybody?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Yes, of course.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And it's so gentle, it's beautiful, it's a living process,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
it's all your own, it's your own power,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and you rise the Kundalini which rises and pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that integrates itself.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
That's what it is that you have to have an actualization of the bautism.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It's not artificial, it's something to put the water on your head,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
you have become, that applies, no is actualization,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
when you really feel the cool things of the Holy Ghost.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And all the things that are said by all the prophets comes to you.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Like even Mohammad Sahab has said that your hands should speak,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
then it should be the time of resurrection [unclear].

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
That's what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It has to be the actualization, it has to work,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
it has to move on your central nervous system.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
It's not just artificial, it's standing on your head.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Interviewer: And the only way to learn that is to put the centre, your centre,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
the books.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It's a living process.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Now, supposing it's so vital that we should read,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in the same way it is vital.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And for anything vital, say,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
for your breathing, if you have to read books, what will happen?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It's so vital, it's so important, it's a living process.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Interviewer: And a question that I want to explain to....

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I would say,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
leave the Sahaja yoga of how many, how long

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
in every day you have to dedicate today.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Shri Mataji: No, nothing, it's just that moment, it happens.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
That moment, it happens.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But to master it, you need little time to understand the coding

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and all that, takes about a month or two months.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You can become a master yourself and you start giving realization.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Interviewer: Just a month, that is for everybody.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Shri Mataji: At the most.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
We don't have much time, you know.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And God also doesn't have much time.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
He wants everybody to enter into his kingdom as fast as possible.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Interviewer: And in the brief biography that I have found,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
it's written that you discovered this kind of a Yoga on the [unclear],

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
but before you passed it through different, I don't know.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no. You see, what I did was to....

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
This yoga was used since long,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
but one or two persons used to get realization in those days.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Very few.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Like you can say in the Tree of Life, there are one or two flowers.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But I wanted to have a mass method by which masses are converted.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So I worked through my own subtleties

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
to find out what's wrong with human beings.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
You see, why? What's the problem?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Then I worked out the permutations and combinations,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and then I opened the last chakra.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
By opening that, now everybody is waiting in the masses.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
It's a mass happening.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Interviewer: And I have read in some books that it can be dangerous to the kundalini.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Shri Mataji: Those who have no authority should not do it.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
You see, authority comes from God, not from human beings.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So those people who are leading a dirty life, who are not pure people,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
they can't give realization.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
They have to know everything about Kundalini,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
they have to [unclear] raise Kundalini and all that,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
is dangerous because it is not actually the Kundalini which is dangerous,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
but there are other forces which work on you,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
if you try to do some sort of a funny thing.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Like you put your hand in the plug, you get a shock.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So you don't know how to do it.

00:08:59.118 --> 00:09:01.618
Simple as that. 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Now we have had so many people realize,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
in your Italy we have so many people realize,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
that giving realization.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
No, nothing happens at all.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Interviewer: And are you not afraid to,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
permitted to write down on your brochure that

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000
some person with very strong illness, like cancer,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Shri Mataji: No, no, because we have proved it.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
We have proved it, not only that,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
but there are pieces now written on this thing in India

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and doctors have got MD degrees out of it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So it's a well known fact.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And for your information, we went to Russia

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and the Russian government has accepted now Sahaja Yoga

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
as an independent identity for us,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
because they have seen the results.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Why should I be afraid?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
It's a fact.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Interviewer: I don't know, because in India,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
there is a kind of court of...

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
It forms a kind of court of miracles,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
in other words, in a court of how to say it.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It becomes like a kind of legend.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Shri Mataji: Legends have to be proved.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Interviewer: The data, let's say, of this research,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
there are studies in India

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that are found in these papers.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
No, we haven't seen them either.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
We have seen all the statistics.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Shri Mataji: No, in your country, look,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
[unclear] what was she suffering from?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
[unclear]

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Yogi: Myasthenia gravis

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Yogi: Myasthenia gravis

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Shri Mataji: She is completely cured.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
She [unclear]

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Okay.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Yogi: Now you see the experiment,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Shri Mataji: It's an incurable disease.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
You can see the realization in the mirror.
