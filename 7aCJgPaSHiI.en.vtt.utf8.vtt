There should be someone to show also; If there's need to show, somebody should come up there and show later on.

It's alright.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:12.280
- I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
- Shri Mataji [GERMAN INTERPRETER]

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:20.320
Yesterday, I told you that Truth is to be discovered

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:25.340
on your Central Nervous system through the evolutionary process

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:39.020
- not through some imaginary mental projections

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.460
and to believe into something because somebody is telling you

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.720
in a very convincing manner.

00:22:54.320 --> 00:23:01.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.200
Even, you have not to believe Me, what I tell you.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.800
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:17.040
As I said yesterday, you have to treat it like a hypothesis

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.640
and with an open mind of a scientist to discover the Truth yourself.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:38.060
It is your lookout that you have to be convinced;

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.940
I am not here to convince you

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:49.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:56.300
- or to persuade you to believe into something
- [INTERPRETER]

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:01.160
because even if you believe in Me, believe in what I say,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:07.220
if you do not get the experience of Self-realization, it is of no value.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:12.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:17.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:24.520
Now today, as I told you yesterday, how the human awareness, which has got

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:32.340
it's roots in the brain, starts growing downward and takes us to our destruction in every center

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:38.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.720
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:50.340
and unless and until we get the ascent, we, our human awareness can never take us

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:56.040
to that place where we say that this is the Self, the Spirit.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:59.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:06.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:14.580
So, every human effort to experience new things or to try new things is nothing

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.820
but amounts to a ego trip -

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:26.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.560
- is not reality.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:39.600
Now today, I would like to tell you what happens if our human awareness moves to the left or to the right.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:46.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:52.420
Now in our system there is something called Autonomous Nervous System,

00:25:53.200 --> 00:26:00.020
which means, auto means somebody driven by self.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.900
It is driven by self - autonomous. So, what is this self?

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:13.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:23.980
Now, this Autonomous Nervous System is divided into Sympathetic and Parasympathetic Nervous Systems within us.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:31.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:38.780
On the subtler level, the left side that you see here, what we call as Ida Nadi, in the Sanskrit language,

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:44.220
manifests the left, the Left Sympathetic Nervous System

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:51.500
and the one which is on the right hand side, which starts from the Swadhishtana - the yellow colored one -

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.760
is the one, what we call as, the Pingala Nadi.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:04.180
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:09.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:16.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:23.380
- It manifests the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:31.660
Now the central path, that you see here half-broken, is the path of Kundalini,

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.820
which, actually, manifests

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:43.600
in us the Parasympathetic Nervous System and is called as Sushumna Nadi in the Sanskrit language.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:49.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.160
By the left Nadi, that you see here the blue colored one,

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:04.460
you desire something - is a power of desire.

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:15.520
- It looks after our emotional side
- [INTERPRETER]

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.980
and is somewhere near Freud's id, we can call it but he was very confused -

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:27.060
but is the one that looks after your past and your conditioning.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:42.460
So, this is the one that gives you your conditioning or your past.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:48.740
[INTERPRETER]

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:56.540
Now the right side one that you see, the yellow one, is the one that gives you your future

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:08.580
and this is the one which works on your physical and your mental level

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:14.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:23.360
so that you have now - left hand side is emotional and the physical and the mental side on the right side.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:30.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:34.680
I must confess, English language is extremely confusing

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.160
because the one who suffers from the mental side,

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.640
uh.. they say, is actually suffering from the emotional side

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:58.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:03.340
So, let us take an exact word for that, is the

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.820
when we say the mind, we mean the emotional side.

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:18.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:25.040
[ASIDE - I think, that will do.] and the Kundalini, you say, is the fourth power within us,

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:31.120
which is coiled up in three and a half coils and is lying in that

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:37.160
sacrum bone, as we call it, in a sleeping state.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.400
[INTERPRETER]

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.720
[ASIDE - That will do, I'll manage. It's alright. Thank You.]

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.340
Now we have seen these four powers within us.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:04.920
First is the left side power of desire, right side power of action

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:10.640
and the central path of our evolution.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:17.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:22.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:30.320
Now whatever we have evolved, is shown on our Central Nervous System which records everything.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:37.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:42.700
We can say that all these three powers built-in

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:47.300
the program of the Central Nervous System.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:54.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:01.760
Now say, for animals, you ask a horse to pass through a dirty lane

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.360
or a dog - he will just go through, he will not have any problems

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.280
but for a human-being, to go through a dirty lane, will be very difficult.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:17.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:22.960
- [INTERPRETER]
- So, on our Central Nervous System

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:31.040
we have built-in a new capacity to see beauty, to see color, to see uh..

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.880
the dirt and filth, on our Central Nervous System.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:46.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:50.740
Human-beings need not be told that this is smelling dirty - they can smell it.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.340
As in Sanskrit it is said, "Nahin kasturi ka modaha shapathe namo bhavyathe."

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:08.820
The smell of the musk need not be vowed for; It exists, you can see it yourself.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:17.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:24.740
In the same way, our Central Nervous System records all that we have gained

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:30.920
through our past, through our conditioning and also what we think about our future.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:37.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:43.720
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:48.880
Now, when you start moving towards the left side in your attention,

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.800
you become, sort of, very emotional person.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:58.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:05.300
- Like, we can say, a Greek tragedy
- [INTERPRETER]

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.660
you indulge into something tragic - you enjoy tragedies.

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.660
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.520
You are a happily married man still you like to hear the songs of separation.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:25.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.260
You have everything and a nice wife

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:34.200
but still you are thinking of somebody and unnecessarily you are miserable.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:41.340
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:45.660
Then this devotion can go to anything - it can go to God also

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:51.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:58.080
- as we call it as bhakti cult.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:03.120
I mean, they will go on saying, "Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama,"

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.920
thousand times, sometimes six thousand times, like mad.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:14.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:20.640
- or like, "Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ," they'll go on.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:27.180
They will just, sort of, without any connection with Christ or without any connection with Ram,

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:32.240
just imaginary emotions they will start putting on God.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:39.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:45.580
This bhakti cult we had in India much before anywhere it started, I think.

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:53.260
[INTERPRETER]

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:59.680
So, they are running on the street, all of them, 'Hare Rama, hare Krishna,' running on the street like mad, has no meaning.

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:06.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:14.440
As a result of this kind of a chanting on the left hand side, you develop a kind of a very funny cancer,

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:21.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:27.360
which also can result into a situation, where we call it,

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.440
as the Left Vishuddhi catch where you feel unnecessarily guilty.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:39.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:46.140
It becomes a fashion with people to say you're miserable and that you're very guilty, for nothing at all

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:52.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:58.560
and to say that you must go into misery is the same nonsense that you go to the left side.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:06.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:13.960
You cannot go into any situation yourself and achieve it as far as spirituality is concerned

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:21.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:28.440
but, you must know that the Spiritual ascent is a living process

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.900
and is evolutionary process which works spontaneously.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:38.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.300
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.740
So, going towards left side is even more dangerous than going towards right side.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.500
Left-sided people don't torture others but torture themselves.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:04.760
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:12.900
Now the area they entered into, first of all, is their past, this past, this life's past.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:18.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:24.020
- Then they enter into their own past
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:31.960
This is a very wrong thing, these days some people have started asking about your past, past - it's a very dangerous area.

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:38.720
[INTERPRETER]

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:45.860
- Past is finished and gone - it doesn't exist.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:51.040
Now, when you go beyond that, you go into the very, very dangerous area called

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.560
Collective Subconscious area.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:00.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:08.140
- From Subconscious to the Collective Subconscious
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:14.740
- This one, I say, is the most dangerous area.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:21.140
Now supposing, you were a very right-sided person and you are vulnerable to cancer -

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.320
first thing you'll catch will be cancer

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:33.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:38.460
because into the, into the Collective Subconscious all that is dead

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.000
since the time of our creation is there within us.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:50.460
[INTERPRETER]

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:57.100
This is all accepted now by the doctors that these cancer is caused by

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:04.060
Protein 52 and Protein 58 which are built within us

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:10.480
in an area about which they don't know - they are very honest - but into the area

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.340
which is within us since our creation - is an accepted fact.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.940
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:27.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.540
So, when you start experimenting like this,

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:36.560
even Freud and all this nonsense, when you start experimenting, you go to your left side.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:42.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:48.980
Say, as I said, on Vishuddhi chakra, if you go on taking the name of somebody's continuously

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:56.220
then somebody, who is dead with that name in the atmosphere, just enters into your body

00:40:56.740 --> 00:40:59.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:04.860
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.660
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.560
- and you can get completely possessed.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:22.040
Like, somebody who was, he used to take Christ's name and he started feeling he's become Christ.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:27.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:30.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.940
- and he came to Me he said, "I'm Christ."
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:41.620
- I said, 'Alright, then walk on the water.'
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:46.920
- 'If you can do that I will believe it.'
- [INTERPRETER]

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:54.500
So, this is what happens like Gauguin, now a great artist as you know him, died as a mad man and

00:41:55.020 --> 00:42:03.040
somebody who used to copy him and used to think of him all the time, read about him, suddenly he started painting like Gauguin.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:11.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:22.120
Nothing new but the same thing he was putting on the canvas and I saw this on a television

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.060
show that he was saying, "I am possessed by Gauguin."

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:29.560
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:35.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:42.780
Now many people think that, if they are born and they can tell about their past - it is their own past.

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:50.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:58.500
It is not necessary that it is your own past, it might be some possession is sitting on you and you are telling your past.

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:08.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:12.800
and it may be the past of that person who died.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:24.160
Now this possession business is so secretive and so dangerous that people have no idea about it.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:29.300
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:33.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.240
It is a special art, which is practiced in India and everywhere as witchcraft,

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:46.000
by which people get hold of these dead spirits and put them on others and try to capture them.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:52.500
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:57.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:03.360
- It may be called as black magic or anything.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:09.260
- Most of the gurus try this trick
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:13.000
- and they possess the people
- [INTERPRETER]

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.940
so much so, that people become absolutely mad, give away all their money,

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.260
give away everything they have and they don't see that this man is just exploiting them.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:30.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.820
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:41.460
Ultimately, there can be a complete suicide of all the people they can take to

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:47.300
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:52.760
or there may be people, individuals who might get into epilepsy.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:03.300
- Epilepsy is a sign of possession
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:11.260
- and such a man is not within himself.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:17.020
He might get such a terrible power within himself that even ten people cannot control.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:22.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:30.220
The other day, I saw a child of one year possessed and three people could not hold her and were perspiring.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:39.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:45.580
This is what happens when you get possessed by some sort of a devilish personality.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:51.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:58.220
Many people, who become mad or all them who become mad, are possessed.

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:04.400
- [INTERPRETER]
- Even Schizophrenia comes from the same.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.920
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:16.980
All disturbances of the mental level, so called mental, I mean the emotional level, are from this possession.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.840
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:27.680
Suddenly, a person starts screaming or shouting or behaving in a different manner

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.200
it doesn't explain - it is nothing but a possession.

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:40.640
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.080
Many people ask Me, why in America there is so much schizophrenia?

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.040
Because so many of these Indians were killed by Spanish.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:47:02.320
- [INTERPRETER]
- Maybe they are possessing.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:09.660
- [INTERPRETER]
- Specially the people who have been to Vietnam are possessed people, absolutely.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:14.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:18.520
They are very abnormal and

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.260
very sly and always running away from society.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:29.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:36.660
- Also some of the drugs take you to the left side.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:41.740
- Alcohol also takes you to the left side;
- [INTERPRETER]

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:46.400
Excessive alcohol drinking can really make you a mad man.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.520
So, all these things lead you to the left side and you suffer from

00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:00.960
not only mental troubles but also physical troubles.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:08.680
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:15.420
- Such a person always is very lethargic.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:23.320
He doesn't want to work, he wants to sleep all the time and he is not very neat or clean

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:30.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:36.240
and if you try to organize such a person, he gets very annoyed, can be extremely violent.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:43.340
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:51.800
Now you, one can go through chakras and chakras and see how on every chakra there is a possibility of your movement to the left side.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:58.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:04.400
For example, if you are suddenly frightened by someone or you have a very frightful experience

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:13.020
and you are absolutely lost, that time you can go to the left side and you can

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:17.220
catch it, the way, what we call, the possession.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:23.960
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:28.980
[INTERPRETER]

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:36.000
Say for example, you parents have been not kind to you or you had a very bad childhood

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.180
when in as childhood, when the child needed the attention of the mother and

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:45.700
father and love from them, he was ill-treated,

00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:51.600
then the child can become extremely left-sided or right-sided depending on his temperament

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.620
but when he's left-sided, he develops very funny symptoms.

00:49:55.860 --> 00:50:01.240
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:07.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:15.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:22.900
People achieve it also by giving you wrong type of food which is being done by with some sort of a black magic;

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.700
When you eat that food, you can go to the left side and you can get possessed.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.280
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:37.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:43.780
Some of the gurus give those ashes which actually come from the crematoriums.

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.320
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.140
Such people can suffer from terrible skin troubles.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:57.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:04.740
It is such a secretive knowledge that it is not easy for you to understand unless and until you get your realization.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:12.780
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:19.200
On the Swadhisthana Chakra, it could be a person who is a very, very dynamic person,

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:26.680
who is showing good results in art or in creativity, can be over-doing everything,

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:32.320
is exerting too much onto that or going into it's imagination, may be caught up or

00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:37.220
maybe, somehow or the other, cursed by someone, so he stops all his activity.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:44.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:51.540
[INTERPRETER]

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:59.020
So, when we start experimenting, we should know that with human awareness, either you'll go to the left or to the right.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:07.100
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.820
The best way people achieve mesmerism is through their eyes.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:19.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:25.500
They ask a person to look into his eyes and then somehow or other, try to possess that person.

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:30.320
or could be, that this Agnya Chakra they can turn it in such a way that

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:34.200
in the opposite direction, so that the person gets possessed.

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:40.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:46.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:52.780
The worst is the possession on the Mooladhara Chakra, which is the lowest chakra here, on your sex.

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:59.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:05.500
Many gurus or many people use this chakra to entice people and then it is

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.600
very difficult to get these people out of that.

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:16.580
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:23.140
We stand in great danger because we do not know what one will do to us and when we start

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.760
in darkness some sort of an experiment, it's a very, very dangerous sign.

00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:34.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:41.100
- [INTERPRETER]
- So it is very important, before you take to any such experiments,

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:47.000
you must first find out the disciples of such a guru or the people who are around such a guru,

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:54.620
how are they, how do they look like, are they knowledgeable? How, what is their lifestyle, what sort of people they are?

00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:03.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:08.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:15.840
But human-beings are dare-devils and they try to do things which can be very injurious.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:21.440
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:25.140
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:31.800
Like, I would say, we see a person coming out of a pub, who just falls off of over-drinking

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:35.420
and we try to, sort of, again go into the pub.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:39.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:44.600
[INTERPRETER]

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:53.020
All the chakras can be affected by Mooladhara, if you're caught up on Mooladhara, and then you develop all these diseases

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:58.260
like Parkinson, Mellitus, all these degenerating things.

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:05.800
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:12.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:17.160
So, any kind of extreme behavior can lead you to the left or to the right.

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:23.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:30.440
So, before starting any experiment, you must see the person who is started the experiment, where is he.

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:38.380
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.940
Now, say, for example Freud - he was epileptic, he had cancer

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:50.700
and he was a funny man as far as the mother was concerned, so still people followed him.

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.220
[INTERPRETER]

00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:00.360
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:05.460
And some people followed him to such an extent that they replaced him with Christ.

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:11.420
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:18.220
Even if somebody says that, "We are very religious people, we are very spiritual people," you must see what sort of life they lead.

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:25.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:31.340
- Are they normal people or are they abnormal?
- [INTERPRETER]

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.060
Now, to the right side now. The movement starts on the right side of our awareness.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:41.040
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:49.360
As I told you, is the action - on the right side we perform through our physical and mental activity - for our future also.

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:53.120
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:58.700
[INTERPRETER]

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:05.920
Now on the physical side, supposing, somebody starts over-doing something, then what happens to a person like that.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:11.640
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:17.260
- For example, take jogging.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:20.640
It's very common disease nowadays - everybody is running on the road.

00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:27.160
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:34.540
- Everybody is trying to become a cinema actor.
- [INTERPRETER]

00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:39.860
Now, what we have to understand that jogging is only physical exercise

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:44.860
and if you overdo it, you will develop physically but what about your emotional side?

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:50.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:00.380
You will seldom find a happy jogger - they're always miserable.

00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:06.480
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:11.400
There will be a fight between the wife, maybe a divorce after sometime.

00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.020
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:23.040
I met one dentist. He told Me, "Now, I've become absolutely a saint." I said, "How?" He said, "I've been jogging, jogging

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:30.900
now I don't feel anything. I didn't feel the death of my child, I didn't feel the death of my wife, nothing I feel - I've become a yogi."

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:39.000
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.520
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:50.080
[INTERPRETER]

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:55.800
- And he was thin like a bean stick, I tell you,
- [INTERPRETER]

00:58:56.220 --> 00:59:00.720
and still he was trying to jog because the habit he could not give up.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.460
His, I mean, his bones used to run on the streets - the skeleton.

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:13.200
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:19.740
He could not give up that habit despite that he'd lost all his weight.

00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:25.900
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:31.960
Same thing with any physical exercise if you do indiscriminately - for example, take Hatha yoga.

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:38.700
If you start doing Hatha yoga, every type of asana without understanding what is your problem, where the Kundalini is stopping,

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:44.420
you indiscriminately start doing Hatha yoga, you might develop terrible problems of the heart

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:53.060
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:59.620
[INTERPRETER]

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:04.520
and one becomes a very fiery person, extremely angry, hot-tempered

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:08.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.600
- and very dry.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.800
They have no love, they have no tolerance, they cannot bear anything.

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:26.880
I would say some French - you can meet them - because they eat lot of fungus, their liver goes out

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:30.700
and then they are all the time thinking, thinking, thinking.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:36.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:41.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:46.500
- They eat every kind of fungus.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:50.560
There are 200 type of cheese they have got which has got fungus in it.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:56.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.260
I mean, if you put a little fungus on your hand, all your life you cannot get rid of it - it's so horrid.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:11.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.520
So now, when we start thinking too much,

01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.740
on the mental side what happens to our body?

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.360
- We think of the future.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.920
Telescopic we become, we become very speedy.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:38.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:45.640
Like you see, if there's a train coming, such a person has to arrive at the station which is,

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.420
say at A point; He will reach at B point where the train doesn't stop.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:57.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:07.960
- They go on thinking, thinking like mad -
- [INTERPRETER]

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.100
- produce no results
- [INTERPRETER]
- and this is so maddening

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.660
that such a person can become extremely dry.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:21.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:29.800
- and this dryness can have effect on all the chakras.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:37.400
- Like, on the Mooladhara he becomes a constipated person;
- [INTERPRETER]

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:45.120
- He develops all the problems of constipation;
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then he has too much heat in the body;

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:51.320
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then at Swadhishthana he develops a very bad liver;

01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:59.660
- [INTERPRETER]
- Liver becomes absolutely dried up;
- [INTERPRETER]

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:06.140
Liver is the one that takes away all our poison and passes on to the water of the blood

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:13.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:20.880
but when there is not sufficient water, the heat remains there and liver starts troubling such a person and he develops horrible things like

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:25.680
like, biliousness and ultimately cirrhosis of the liver.

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:32.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:39.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:45.420
So, the liver starts spoiling, spoiling your attention and you cannot enjoy anything, you don't like anything.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:52.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:58.220
You cannot eat much, you feel giddy and if you sit in the Sun or anything,

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:02.140
you becomes really, absolutely burnt up.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:10.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:18.140
Now, this yellow line is called also Surya Nadi - means the uh.. channel of the Sun.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:25.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:32.500
- These right-sided people are very much fond of the Sun also
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:38.700
They go to the sea-shore and burn their skins in addition to what they have already burnts inside.

01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:46.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.840
- and develop cancer of the skin.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:57.560
It is another way of futuristic thinking gives you a very serious trouble of attack all heart attack.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:04.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:08.820
- which is, which has a spiritual significance.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:14.620
A person, who is extremely aggressive and extrovert, his attention is always outside

01:05:14.980 --> 01:05:18.820
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:25.740
- and not on his heart, not on his Spirit.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.800
As a result of that, Spirit sleeps off and he gets a massive heart attack.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:38.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:47.420
There's another thing, as I told you, that one can develop Diabetes and all those things because of too much of aggressiveness.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:54.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:05:54.220 --> 01:06:01.040
But the aggressiveness of the tongue gives you all kinds of problems of the Vishuddhi, here.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:08.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:15.620
If you shout too much and if you aggress people by your talking, try to put them down

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:23.840
by your talking, try to take their charge by your talking, sharpness, you develop all the problems of the right Vishuddhi.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:30.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.280
Now, if husband is a shouting person, the wife becomes deaf

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:44.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.960
but husband himself suffers from terrible coughing,

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.480
cold and all kinds of bronchial troubles

01:06:54.740 --> 01:07:01.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:09.120
- and then he becomes vulnerable to the cancer also.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:17.360
Somehow, if he's triggered by this Protein 52 or 58, then he gets the throat cancer.

01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:25.960
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:33.800
- [INTERPRETER]
- So he removes his gullet, he removes his nose, he removes his tongue - goes on removing one after another.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:41.960
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:47.060
This is what is up to Vishuddhi chakra but Agnya is the most dangerous.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:54.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.920
The masters of this black magic use their Agnya

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:05.780
- [INTERPRETER]
- through their eyes.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:09.940
These people when they use their Agnya chakra that way

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:16.280
before death, they have to go through Hell as far as their body is concerned.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:24.260
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:29.960
- They may develop all kinds of allergies
- [INTERPRETER]

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:34.220
or they may develop all kinds of

01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:39.380
heating problems like blisters - their body will blister out.

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:46.980
- [INTERPRETER]
- Their head may burst out with heat.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:53.940
- [INTERPRETER]
- They may have their brain damages, paralysis.

01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:05.580
- This is only the physical side that happens
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:10.520
but mentally also the people, who are right sided can become horrid.

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:16.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.620
- They become very aggressive.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:26.240
Like when they are possessed, you see, an idea can come into their heads that, "Let us become aggressive," you see,

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:31.940
fascist, they become fascist or they can become very right-sided people.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:37.300
We can say, as we have in London nowadays they, they have shaven their hair and all that,

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:42.900
they have no marriages, nothing but they find anybody of a black color - they just strangle that person.

01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:51.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:01.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:05.980
They aggress others, all the time they aggress by some sort of a funny doing.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:11.600
[INTERPRETER]

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:19.380
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:24.440
- Very embarrassing!
- [LAUGHTER]

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.120
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:35.800
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:42.280
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:49.300
- At the right moment things happen, you know.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:09.080
- We were getting rather serious, so we needed something like that.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:17.440
So, as we see now, all these things happen to us when we try to go to the right.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.500
As I said, when we aggress others, you see, now, when we start aggressing others, we destroy others.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:27.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.820
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:38.860
- But we are part and parcel of the whole.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:46.160
If you destroy anything in that Whole, that the Whole thing then, you are destroying yourself as well.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:51.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:56.520
So, we think that by aggressing others we are not harmed - you are very much harmed.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:03.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.700
Whatever you give to others, goes round that person and comes back to you.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:21.420
Now, a person who always says, "I hate you, I will kill you," all that,

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:26.100
may die with a very harsh hands himself.

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:31.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:34.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:41.260
- Such a man is always hated - no one likes him.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:45.100
But the, on the subtler level what happens to you

01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:50.200
is on this thing, that such people sometimes lose their voices completely - they can't talk

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:57.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:05.780
- and could be that they, they  can not ascend at all.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:14.120
In the brain, as you can cut the  brain you can see in the transverse section of the brain, it looks like many petals.

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:21.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:28.180
That is what is called as Sahastrara because there are 1000 nerves according to sahaja yog.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:34.680
Doctors will fight because they say that there are only 998 because they couldn't count two more.

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:41.360
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:48.860
[INTERPRETER]

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:55.900
Now, these nerves within us, these nerves within us, give us a brain

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.800
which is not being used; We have used very little part of our brain so far.

01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:09.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.580
There are so many deeper sides in our brain which we have never used.

01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:19.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:26.200
So, if we have to make an experiment, we must ascend and go to our Sahastrara, inside here

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:32.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:38.460
and you'll be surprised, that when people achieve this breaking of the Sahastrara,

01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:43.520
they become one with the All-Pervading Divine ether

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:52.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:57.560
and they develop a new awareness, a new dimension on their Central Nervous System

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.060
that they can feel others, they can feel themselves.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:10.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:16.320
- This is the minimum.
- [INTERPRETER]
- Then, when you raise the Kundalini of others, which you can do,

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:20.600
you put them in the center and solve all their problems of the sides.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:27.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:40.600
- Many mad people have been cured through sahaja yog - is a fact.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:46.440
People have dropped their habits, any kind of habits that they had, suddenly just like that overnight.

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:51.960
[INTERPRETER]

01:15:52.380 --> 01:16:00.380
You can't imagine how people have changed. If I tell you, it cannot be believe because it is impossible for you to believe

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:07.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:11.980
but when you see for yourself this is happening, you are amazed.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:19.980
How this Kundalini rising solves all our problems because we are neither on the right or on the left but we are above ourselves.

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:25.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:30.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:37.380
I'll give you an analogy to understand it because you all are fond of motor-cars - it will be easy to explain.

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:45.340
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.680
In every car we have got a accelerator, that is the right side

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:55.460
and the and the break on the left side which stops it - we need both.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:05.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:11.220
Now when we are practicing driving, we, what we do, is to practice the left and the right

01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:19.000
both of them and then when we learn it, we learn it. When do we learn - when we learn it.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:25.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:29.220
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:36.240
Alright. So, when we learn driving, what do we know? We know how to use the left and the right.

01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:43.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:49.440
So, you become a driver; We can say, you become a balanced personality - what we call it, dharmik.

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:56.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:00.740
But supposing, you use only the break, the car will not move

01:18:00.940 --> 01:18:06.360
or if you use only the accelerator - you'll know what will happen to you.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:15.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:23.160
- But still you are a driver
- [INTERPRETER]
- and the master is sitting at the back.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:30.580
- When you get your realization, you become the master.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:36.980
Then you start seeing the driver in you and the left in you and the right in you.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:47.760
and to achieve that we have the central path through which you ascend.

01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:58.820
This is the path which is established through our ascent

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:04.120
in our previous evolutionary process.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:12.020
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:18.520
For example, this red thing that you see here - Mooladhara - was Carbon when we were Carbon.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:23.260
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:27.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.060
- Now, the central path represents the Nitrogen,

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:36.700
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.740
left side the Hydrogen and the right side the Oxygen.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:46.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:50.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:55.220
Now, when the Carbon combine with the Nitrogen, it

01:19:55.420 --> 01:20:00.500
it became amino acids and we became alive and ascent started.

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:07.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:11.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:16.840
Now, if you consider this as the body of the whole and we are part and parcel of it

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:23.060
then you consider that the evolution has taken place from this to that stage one by one

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:29.000
where all those leaders, who were there, are represented on the centers.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:36.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:43.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:48.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:55.000
As human-beings are made in the image of the great Primordial being, you can see here, the center green

01:20:55.300 --> 01:21:00.580
is represents in the, what we call, as Bhavasagara - the Great Ocean.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:07.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:14.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:22.480
and this Great Ocean is the one where the fishes came up through amoeba stage

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:30.400
and then the fishes crossed over and then, gradually,  how all the animal kingdom came up. Like that, all these

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:37.200
deities, that we think of, are the leaders, are the leaders of the centers which they occupy.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.080
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:53.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:21:53.960 --> 01:22:01.000
- So, we can say, that Christ came at this point.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:08.620
He was an Incarnation which was made of, we can say, the,

01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:14.600
I get sometimes confused with the English language.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:21.260
uh.. we can say, with the All-Pervading Power, with the Onkara itself.

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:36.160
- There was no element of Earth in Him,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:41.400
so He could walk on the water and He could resurrect Himself through this center

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:48.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:51.840
and that's why it is said that He's the gate - through Him you have to pass.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:01.180
By doing that, it is, the optic chiasma,

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:05.620
in the center of that it is - it is controlling Pitutary and Pineal body.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:10.200
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:14.340
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:18.900
Now, when the Kundalini rises and She awakens Christ there, He sucks in

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:24.340
these two things which are created by left and right side - one is the ego on the,

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.560
on that yellow side and the superego on the left hand side.

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:33.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:37.460
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:44.740
So, these ego and superego form this kind of a shell for us and we become like a egg, we can say.

01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:52.560
[INTERPRETER]

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:57.140
Sometimes they overlap and then we become very hard shell

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:03.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:08.060
and we become, what we call, we develop our I-ness.

01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:12.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:18.160
When the Kundalini passes through this Agnya Chakra, then She sucks in, He sucks in

01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:24.440
Christ sucks in the left and the right - the conditioning and the karmas and the whole thing goes inside, like that

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:28.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:33.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:42.020
and over the limbic area, with the fontanel bone area, you find like a small child you develop a soft bone again.

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:48.820
[INTERPRETER]

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.020
- This is your re-birth.
- [INTERPRETER]
- In Sanskrit language

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:59.120
a bird is called as a dwijah - means born twice

01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:05.060
and a brahmin, the one who knows the Brahma - the All-Pervading Power, is also called as dwijaha.

01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:11.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:23.780
Brahmins, means the one who has known the Brahma - the one who's a realized soul - but nowadays we have all kinds of Brahmins in India.

01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:28.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:34.400
- [INTERPRETER]
- Mostly they are cooks

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:41.340
- [INTERPRETER]
- or they sit in the temple and sell ganja on things like that.

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:45.560
- [INTERPRETER]
- Horrid!

01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.880
Alright, so now, when, when the Kundalini sucks in and this opens out,

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:56.920
you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your fontanel bone area on top of your head

01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:04.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:10.100
because on top of your head is the place of the

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:14.520
God Almighty, as we call it, or you call Him Sadashiva or whatever name it may be

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:22.320
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:28.620
and His power is the Primordial Mother, Adishakti - the Holy Ghost

01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:35.200
[INTERPRETER]

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:40.540
- and Onkara is the Son 
- [INTERPRETER]
- is Their Power.

01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:47.620
- [INTERPRETER]
- Now, it is impossible to understand that you have a Father, Who is a God

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:55.140
you have a God as a Son and no Mother - missing - Holy Ghost, how can you have that?

01:26:55.740 --> 01:27:03.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:08.740
Have you seen such a situation? A father giving birth to a son - I have not seen so far.

01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:13.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:20.520
- So there has to be a Mother, the female.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:25.940
That's the Primordial Mother and She's represented within us as Kundalini

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.680
and God Almighty represented within us as the Spirit in our heart.

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:39.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:46.320
This knowledge is very vast. You have to enter into the ocean of this knowledge and you'll become that.

01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:54.300
[INTERPRETER]

01:27:54.540 --> 01:28:01.560
- You become the knowledge,
- [INTERPRETER]
- you become the joy,
- [INTERPRETER]

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:09.240
- you become the attention - 
- [INTERPRETER]
- that you have to become.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:28:10.260 --> 01:28:15.200
- That's what you are - you are fantastic.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:22.040
Only thing, this has to be connected to the mains and the same way, you have to be connected to the mains - that's all; You're all ready for it.

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:25.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:32.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:37.400
So, do not have any guilt about it. Know that you're human-beings, specially created.

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:44.620
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.620
Only thing you have to enter into the Kingdom of God - that's all -

01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:54.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:28:54.720 --> 01:29:00.640
and your Mother Kundalini, your individual Mother Kundalini is just waiting there to take you down.

01:29:00.820 --> 01:29:04.340
- [INTERPRETER]
- to take you up, I should say.

01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:08.860
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:09.060 --> 01:29:12.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:19.080
After all, He is God Almighty Who's your Father - He's a Divine Father

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.960
and how can He ask you to suffer?

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:32.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:39.720
He's the most loving Father, He's love personified - how can He make you suffer?

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:46.280
- [INTERPRETER]
- We suffer out of our ignorance - sorry.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:51.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:59.560
When the light comes in, you will see how gracious, kind and benevolent He is.

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:06.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:13.680
- Whether you believe in Him or not, He is.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:21.060
- You have to just enter into His Kingdom to see.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:30:21.380 --> 01:30:25.600
So, there is no need to deny Him or accept Him but see for yourself.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:30.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:34.220
- May God bless you!
- [INTERPRETER]

01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:49.140
Now, I would request, like yesterday some people were

01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:54.180
not wanting to have Self-realization, I would request them that they should leave us in peace.

01:30:54.940 --> 01:31:01.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:05.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:12.300
It will hardly take 10-15 minutes for you to get realization but please don't disturb us.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:16.640
If you want to go, you can go now and don't disturb others.

01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:21.380
Better be a kind and civil to people who want to have their realization.

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:29.180
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:33.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:40.800
The experience is very simple and you can really feel it, you don't have to do anything about it.

01:31:41.100 --> 01:31:44.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:49.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:09.640
Sahaja yogis should not disturb. If you're sahaja yogis, you be seated - doesn't matter. You need not get up and walk off

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:13.800
because no use disturbing people - it's not proper also.

01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:22.020
- Let the sahaja yogis be seated wherever they are
- [INTERPRETER]

01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:27.500
because these are new people and they easily, they get easily disturbed.

01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:31.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:38.820
- So, one must keep the silence, please.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:47.960
I had asked you to give Me questions and no questions have come through

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:54.560
but even now, if you have some questions, you may pass them over to our center and I would like to answer them.

01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:01.180
After this realization I have to make a very great respect,

01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:09.460
respectful request to you, that you must have respect for your realization.

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:16.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:22.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:28.160
You have to be profound and deep to understand everything but

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:32.960
it gives you depth, suddenly you become deeper personality, immediately.

01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:40.560
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:45.700
Nothing is wanted out of you. If you are a human-being, you'll get your realization.

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:52.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.820
Maybe, some may not get today because they might be

01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:01.980
not yet tuned or maybe but doesn't matter, you will always get it.

01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:10.160
[INTERPRETER]

01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:20.440
Now, as I've told you, you have to have your shoes taken out because we have to take the help of the Mother Earth.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:28.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.660
I think, you send him away - would be better - go off to sleep.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:59.720
That's better. Take him away because he will go off to sleep in no time - must be tired.

01:35:04.180 --> 01:35:09.060
All the children can go away now. Let it be. They are all realized souls. They should not be bothered much.

01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:13.380
They want to sit they can sit down but it's time for them - it's about 90'clock.

01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:24.680
Alright, so now, is very simple that I will tell you beforehand what is to be done -

01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:32.520
is to put left hand towards Me because is the desire that you have and the right hand you should use for action.

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:40.160
[INTERPRETER]

01:35:40.340 --> 01:35:45.940
[INTERPRETER]

01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:51.220
I will show you only and you can see for yourself also. First your heart you have to touch

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:58.700
- [INTERPRETER]
- where resides the Spirit.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:05.860
Then everything works on the left hand side. You have to put your right hand on the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:09.340
where there is the center of your mastery - is the Nabhi chakra.

01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:17.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:21.860
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:27.980
Then, you have to take your right hand and push it into the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:34.320
where is the center of Swadhishtana is, through which we work out the laws of the Divine.

01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.740
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:44.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:50.620
Then you have to raise your right hand again. At this point the Kundalini starts moving

01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:55.320
so you have to raise your hand again on the chakra

01:36:55.440 --> 01:37:01.080
which is the Nabhi chakra on the left hand side on the upper part of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:07.440
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:11.760
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:20.100
- Now, again you have to bring your hand on to the heart chakra.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:26.920
Now, here is the left Vishudhhi, which is caught up when we feel guilty - that's a very bad state.

01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:32.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:38.060
Put the hand across like this - not from the back, it's very bad. I tell you, it's the worst chakra today.

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:46.560
- [INTERPRETER]
- Yesterday... not to feel guilty at all. I request you not to feel guilty, not to feel guilty - please.

01:37:47.100 --> 01:37:53.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:59.000
- Be pleasantly placed towards you.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:03.200
You are the temple of God. Believe Me, you are the temple of God

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:07.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:14.520
- and turn your head to the right and hold it tight like that.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.400
Now, then you have to take your right hand put it on your forehead. Press it on both the sides.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:27.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:33.520
Now, you have to take your right hand. Put it back on your

01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:39.600
back Agnya, which is on the, we can say, on the optic lobe and push back your head like this.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:47.500
[INTERPRETER]

01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:52.380
- Now, you have to stretch your hand fully.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:59.340
Stretch fully. Now, put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area.

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.580
Press it very hard and move it seven times.

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:07.680
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.640
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:17.620
- [INTERPRETER]
- That's all.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:23.620
But before we start today, we better give us ourselves a balance a little bit.

01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:29.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:34.560
- Please put your left hand towards Me, like this for ...
- [INTERPRETER]

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:41.840
Now, what you have to do, your right side is too much working, so, we have to give a balance to ourselves.

01:39:42.220 --> 01:39:47.380
You put your right hand just like this and take it up on your head

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:51.220
and put it on the side like that and throw it away.

01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:59.380
[INTERPRETER]

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:02.920
- We'll do it three times to begin with. Let us start.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:10.640
On top of your head, on top of your head, nicely - push it down. Again,

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:14.980
throw it down. Again, take it on top of of your head, nicely.

01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:20.620
Throw it down. Again

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:29.960
- and throw it down. Now, it's a balance.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:37.360
Now, let us start with the left hand towards Me, like this - this is the desire, this is the action and close your eyes now.

01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:43.520
[INTERPRETER]

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:50.820
Please don't open your eyes till I tell you. Slowly, like that, not at a stretch - just like this, just like this. It's alright - anyway.

01:40:53.060 --> 01:41:00.920
You will stretch your hand too much, madam. Just put it like... very relaxed. You'll be tired - yes, just in a comfortable way.

01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:08.380
- Alright, yeah. Now, put your right hand on your heart, please.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:14.660
You may take out your spectacles because you have to keep your eyes shut all the time and it helps the eyesight also.

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:22.100
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:27.260
Alright, now, close your eyes, please. Don't open them till I tell you.

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:32.240
[INTERPRETER]

01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:39.140
Now, now on the heart you put your right hand and you have to say

01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:45.040
or you have to ask a question, a very fundamental question.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
You can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother - whatever suits you -

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:55.260
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask the question three times.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:02.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:11.040
- Three times, please.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:25.220
This fundamental question is followed by another because if you are the Spirit, you are your master too.

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:32.720
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:39.840
Now, so, you put your right hand now on the upper portion

01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:44.660
of your abdomen, without opening your eyes, on the left hand side.

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:51.800
[INTERPRETER]

01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:57.960
Now here, you have to ask the second question.

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:04.020
This is the center of mastery, so you have to ask a question, another question,

01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:09.140
"Mother, am I my own master?" ask this question three times.

01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:44.360
part of your abdomen on the left hand side and here is the center of true knowledge, of Pure Knowledge.

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:49.420
[INTERPRETER]

01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:54.280
[INTERPRETER]

01:43:54.740 --> 01:44:00.700
Here, we cannot force you to ask this question

01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:05.120
[INTERPRETER]

01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:12.420
so, you have to ask yourself in all your freedom, which I respect.

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:17.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:22.680
[Let it be, doesn't matter. Leave her alone.]

01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:28.540
You have to ask the question, here, by saying

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:37.240
or you have to ask or you have to ask  for My help by saying, "Mother, may I have the Pure Knowledge."

- Please don't open your eyes, please don't open your eyes.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:42.920
Alright, now here, as the Kundalini has started moving,

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:50.240
you have to open this chakra, by saying with full confidence

01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:58.060
because this is the master's chakra, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:05.000
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:08.260
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:36.120
Ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:40.140
[INTERPRETER]

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:58.500
Now, with full confidence, again you put your right hand on your heart,

01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:04.280
-  [INTERPRETER]
- on your heart.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:11.880
Here now, with full confidence, you have to say again,

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:16.640
"Mother, I am my own

01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:21.540
Spirit," or you can say, "Mother, I am the Spirit."

01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:29.260
[INTERPRETER]

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:36.880
- Please say it twelve times,
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:45.220
- with full confidence - this is the greatest Truth.
-  [INTERPRETER]

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.320
- Twelve times
- [INTERPRETER]

01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:07.900
Now, please raise your right hand on the left hand side of corner

between you neck and your shoulder and press it hard and move your neck to the right side.

01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:21.400
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:25.920
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:31.180
Now here, with full confidence, again you have to say,

01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:34.720
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:41.900
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:48.940
Even after saying that, you want to feel guilty, you better punish yourself by saying 108 times.

01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:53.480
[INTERPRETER]

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:58.540
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:06.740
- You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:13.000
- Alright, that's good!
- [INTERPRETER]

01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:24.240
Now, raise your right hand and put it to your forehead across.

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:28.160
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.320
- Now here you press it on both the sides
- [INTERPRETER]

01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:37.720
and here you have to say,

01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:45.120
from your heart, not how many times, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:49:46.440 --> 01:49:49.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:54.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:49:55.660 --> 01:50:01.580
Whether you forgive or not forgive, it's a myth but if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:06.780
So, just say, "Mother, I forgive everyone," from your heart.

01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:12.780
[INTERPRETER]

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:18.580
[INTERPRETER]

01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:24.380
Now, God or Divine is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:32.900
- [INTERPRETER]
- so, don't feel guilty
- [INTERPRETER]

01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:39.320
and please put your right hand now, on the back side of your head and hold it tight and push back your head.

01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:43.840
[INTERPRETER]

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:47.880
[INTERPRETER]

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:53.460
Now here again, without feeling guilty, you just say for your own satisfaction,

01:50:53.700 --> 01:50:58.940
"O Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me." - for your own satisfaction.

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:04.040
[INTERPRETER]

01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:10.660
[INTERPRETER]

01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:24.520
- Now, take out your hand and stretch it please.
- [INTERPRETER]

01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:30.180
Stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of your head and press it hard.

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:35.300
Now here, you have to move it seven times and you have to say -

01:51:35.940 --> 01:51:43.640
because I cannot force you - again here your freedom is respected. You have to say, "Mother, please give me my realization."

01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:51.340
"Mother, please, may I have my realization." Press it hard, press it hard the center part; Stretch your fingers.

01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:58.580
- [INTERPRETER]
- On your head, on your head
- [INTERPRETER]

01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:04.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:11.060
[INTERPRETER]

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:15.320
