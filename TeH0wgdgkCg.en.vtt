00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:11.126
But that is what we have to first of all

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:13.208
recondition ourselves,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.998
by attaching ourselves emotionally to Mother.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.359
I mean, you have an advantage

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.123
over many other yogis of the world who came, poor things,

00:00:28.204 --> 00:00:30.289
they had nothing to look forward.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.748
They knew of a Primordial Mother, they knew about this,

00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:36.247
but they had no Form.

00:00:36.748 --> 00:00:38.915
You have a Form.

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:42.623
You are very fortunate and lucky people; you have a Form.

00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:47.207
It's easy to adore a Form than to adore something abstract

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:48.539
in the air, do you see;

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.790
absolute consciousness,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.873
how do you adore it when you can't see it?

00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:58.456
But that attachment doesn't mean in any way

00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:01.581
that you have to give Me anything.

00:01:01.873 --> 00:01:02.873
What do you give Me?

00:01:02.873 --> 00:01:06.581
Nothing, but detachment from the cause.

00:01:10.207 --> 00:01:13.040
And this works out - you have seen it in your lifetime.

00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:16.579
You also say that "It works out, Mother, somehow it worked out."

00:01:16.957 --> 00:01:18.165
What is bandhan?

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:21.373
It's nothing but you are attaching yourself to your Mother,

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:23.581
you're just telephoning to Her.

00:01:24.748 --> 00:01:27.207
This is a telephone going to your Mother,

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.748
that's all.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.831
You know I also play with you, I also say,

00:01:31.982 --> 00:01:35.265
"All right, I am giving you a bandhan."

00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:37.831
I am giving bandhan to Myself!

00:01:38.082 --> 00:01:39.456
It's a telephone call,

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:41.331
just a telephone call.

00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:44.082
But the faith has developed now that yes,

00:01:44.082 --> 00:01:46.082
this is the real faith,

00:01:46.082 --> 00:01:50.706
where you get completely detached in your emotional things.

00:01:50.863 --> 00:01:54.361
It's just "My mother" - all right, just give her a bandhan, finished.

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:57.594
"My father" - give him a bandhan.
"My brother" - give him a bandhan,

00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.581
whatever it is.
Bandhan, whatever it is.

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:04.831
You are putting that ... in the bonds of your Mother.

00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:07.998
But you are not conscious that you are doing that.

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.545
You are just binding them with the love of your Mother

00:02:10.626 --> 00:02:12.474
which is flowing through your hands.

00:02:14.207 --> 00:02:17.207
What are these vibrations, is your Mother's love.

00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:22.873
You've got it, it is flowing through you.

00:02:22.954 --> 00:02:26.212
But what about your love for your Mother?

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.250
And that is what I find,

00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:33.123
that at the time when there is complete emergency

00:02:33.414 --> 00:02:39.790
that surrender comes in, and it works.

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:45.207
So there's no need to create any emergencies.

00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:49.665
You must slow and steadily work it out,

00:02:50.498 --> 00:02:54.539
and it will build up by itself within you.

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:57.289
You will have that power within you, I assure you.

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.207
But meditation is one way;

00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:02.289
another is the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:04.665
Not showing off, not telling others,

00:03:04.665 --> 00:03:07.539
but working it out in yourself - different chakras,

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:08.790
how they work out,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.414
on yourself, not on others.
