00:01.730 --> 00:13.110
symmetry what is sahaja yoga sahaja some

00:07.620 --> 00:17.190
is faith Germans born so it is born with

00:13.110 --> 00:21.869
you the right to become United which is

00:17.190 --> 00:24.240
the yoga with the divine and this this

00:21.869 --> 00:26.189
sahaja yoga is something that everybody

00:24.240 --> 00:32.210
can have is it is something everybody

00:26.189 --> 00:35.040
can practice of course and how does the

00:32.210 --> 00:38.160
this connection with the divine take

00:35.040 --> 00:40.710
place we have within ourselves this

00:38.160 --> 00:44.370
power in the triangular bone which is

00:40.710 --> 00:47.850
called a sacred meaning sacred which

00:44.370 --> 00:51.000
when awakened sprouts like a premium in

00:47.850 --> 00:58.190
a seed and Rises through six subtle

00:51.000 --> 01:02.129
centers opens out the last center and

00:58.190 --> 01:05.460
gets connected with the damar which is a

01:02.129 --> 01:09.510
subtle energy all around us which

01:05.460 --> 01:12.979
organizes us which nourishes us does all

01:09.510 --> 01:15.090
the living work above all it loves us

01:12.979 --> 01:20.310
does this mainstream mythology that

01:15.090 --> 01:22.770
people who have not had the ability to

01:20.310 --> 01:25.280
practice sahaja yoga are not connected

01:22.770 --> 01:27.780
with the divine most of them are not I

01:25.280 --> 01:33.150
need some of them are they don't know

01:27.780 --> 01:35.549
all about it so this is what a an extra

01:33.150 --> 01:37.320
force that is available to human beings

01:35.549 --> 01:39.630
to develop themselves in this way of

01:37.320 --> 01:42.270
course this is the last breakthrough of

01:39.630 --> 01:44.759
our evolution where you have to get

01:42.270 --> 01:46.470
connected with the divine you have to

01:44.759 --> 01:48.689
feel it on your central nervous system

01:46.470 --> 01:54.479
and that's how you get your

01:48.689 --> 01:57.930
self-realization do I perceive here that

01:54.479 --> 02:03.119
this is a way of balancing oneself of

01:57.930 --> 02:05.000
keeping in such a way of living one's

02:03.119 --> 02:07.079
life in such a way that one is not

02:05.000 --> 02:09.599
unbalanced in one's view of what is

02:07.079 --> 02:12.330
going on around us yes we have two sites

02:09.599 --> 02:13.150
in our system of autonomous nervous

02:12.330 --> 02:15.580
system

02:13.150 --> 02:17.920
turn right which he called as left and

02:15.580 --> 02:24.250
right sympathetic nervous system the

02:17.920 --> 02:27.819
left side caters for our emotions for

02:24.250 --> 02:32.170
our past our desires the right side

02:27.819 --> 02:35.560
caters for our actual physical and

02:32.170 --> 02:38.500
mental if you indulge into one too much

02:35.560 --> 02:42.190
and go too far with it you develop an

02:38.500 --> 02:44.440
imbalance within yourself in the center

02:42.190 --> 02:47.440
lies the third power which we call as

02:44.440 --> 02:49.359
parasympathetic nervous system this is

02:47.440 --> 02:52.269
the channel which is the central path of

02:49.359 --> 02:55.930
ascent when the kundalini rises through

02:52.269 --> 03:00.609
it it brings you in the balance because

02:55.930 --> 03:02.109
it rises in the center of the system so

03:00.609 --> 03:05.560
this is the minimum that happens that

03:02.109 --> 03:09.970
you developed your balance so how does

03:05.560 --> 03:14.440
one actually achieve this balance it

03:09.970 --> 03:15.810
just happens one tinniest in other words

03:14.440 --> 03:18.579
there's no there's no physical

03:15.810 --> 03:22.690
requirement on an individual not at all

03:18.579 --> 03:25.000
not at all it's a evolutionary step as I

03:22.690 --> 03:27.370
told you in our evolution we have

03:25.000 --> 03:30.700
developed a balance we can stand on our

03:27.370 --> 03:33.190
two legs animals cannot in the same way

03:30.700 --> 03:39.209
you develop this special balance between

03:33.190 --> 03:42.760
your emotions and your actions in a very

03:39.209 --> 03:45.970
proper way you speak as though this is

03:42.760 --> 03:49.090
some sort of evolutionary step yes it is

03:45.970 --> 03:51.669
it is the last breakthrough that you

03:49.090 --> 03:54.819
have to become the spirit now and this

03:51.669 --> 03:57.310
has to be achieved which can be achieved

03:54.819 --> 03:59.049
only through a living process because we

03:57.310 --> 04:01.870
have become human beings through a

03:59.049 --> 04:05.260
living process and that living process

04:01.870 --> 04:06.879
has to act within us the sounds as

04:05.260 --> 04:09.370
though it is rather a significant time

04:06.879 --> 04:12.519
than in the in the history of humanity

04:09.370 --> 04:15.370
very much in the history of humanity in

04:12.519 --> 04:18.280
the history of evolution in the history

04:15.370 --> 04:21.669
of spirituality is the most important

04:18.280 --> 04:24.150
time because here where you get what

04:21.669 --> 04:26.889
heaven has been promised to you so far

04:24.150 --> 04:29.620
so it's no accident

04:26.889 --> 04:32.289
that sahaja yoga has appeared in the

04:29.620 --> 04:34.389
world at this time no not at all not at

04:32.289 --> 04:37.029
all it's all predicted thousands of

04:34.389 --> 04:39.759
years back in India and later on by many

04:37.029 --> 04:44.080
Saints even William Blake has predicted

04:39.759 --> 04:46.509
it shri mataji you went to russia last

04:44.080 --> 04:53.169
year and I believe the reception you got

04:46.509 --> 04:55.539
was most surprising yes I was myself

04:53.169 --> 04:59.639
surprised because thousands of people

04:55.539 --> 05:01.870
came and very sensible well-educated

04:59.639 --> 05:04.840
people came and they all settle down

05:01.870 --> 05:07.289
thousands I didn't know how to cope with

05:04.840 --> 05:11.229
that number because there were so many

05:07.289 --> 05:15.580
and even the members of the Supreme

05:11.229 --> 05:20.979
Council the government they came that I

05:15.580 --> 05:24.719
could only say that in the so-called

05:20.979 --> 05:28.319
free societies we waste too much time

05:24.719 --> 05:31.210
experimenting with our freedom and

05:28.319 --> 05:32.770
indulge too much into the politics which

05:31.210 --> 05:35.889
is a waste thing I think there in

05:32.770 --> 05:37.629
economics all these things while the

05:35.889 --> 05:40.599
people there didn't have any such

05:37.629 --> 05:44.169
chances so they put their energies to

05:40.599 --> 05:45.610
something that was higher than that they

05:44.169 --> 05:47.430
diverted and they were very

05:45.610 --> 05:50.939
knowledgeable they knew a lot about

05:47.430 --> 05:53.529
seeking they knew a lot about Kundalini

05:50.939 --> 05:56.460
and as if they were just waiting for me

05:53.529 --> 05:58.899
it was very de mama

05:56.460 --> 06:02.500
mr. Gorbachev has said the Russians

05:58.899 --> 06:05.110
require a mental revolution do you see

06:02.500 --> 06:08.469
the acceptance of sahaja yoga as part of

06:05.110 --> 06:10.990
this revolution of course he himself is

06:08.469 --> 06:14.649
a saint and what he is meaning by mental

06:10.990 --> 06:16.930
then they should now understand that

06:14.649 --> 06:20.639
they have to develop that balance

06:16.930 --> 06:23.229
between communism and democracy our

06:20.639 --> 06:25.509
democracies are imbalanced they are

06:23.229 --> 06:28.599
one-sided they have no not the other

06:25.509 --> 06:32.819
side of collectivity but communism has

06:28.599 --> 06:38.259
collectivity it is power oriented our

06:32.819 --> 06:40.639
democracies are money-oriented what he

06:38.259 --> 06:45.560
is meaning is the maturity

06:40.639 --> 06:49.599
of all wisdom so yeah referring back to

06:45.560 --> 06:49.599
what we were talking about earlier is it

06:50.530 --> 06:57.949
okay as we were talking about earlier

06:56.300 --> 07:00.770
about bringing the human body into

06:57.949 --> 07:02.870
balance could we say then that mr.

07:00.770 --> 07:07.240
Gorbachev is bringing the whole Eastern

07:02.870 --> 07:12.949
Bloc into balance yes yes they had one

07:07.240 --> 07:18.590
too much on one side and he's trying to

07:12.949 --> 07:21.949
bring them in the center you mentioned

07:18.590 --> 07:24.889
that you went to an Eastern Bloc

07:21.949 --> 07:29.050
conference last year and I believe you

07:24.889 --> 07:31.400
gave many influential people realisation

07:29.050 --> 07:33.229
is it true that you believe that this

07:31.400 --> 07:35.990
was instrumental in helping the

07:33.229 --> 07:39.860
overthrow of oppressive communism it was

07:35.990 --> 07:43.099
a yoga yoga seminar and I expected all

07:39.860 --> 07:45.560
of them to be there and surprisingly I

07:43.099 --> 07:48.169
talked to them hardly for 30 to 35

07:45.560 --> 07:49.819
minutes and then I gave them realization

07:48.169 --> 07:51.589
and all of them got it they were

07:49.819 --> 07:55.099
representative from all these Eastern

07:51.589 --> 07:57.860
Bloc countries when they got it

07:55.099 --> 08:00.680
they're so surprised at it that they

07:57.860 --> 08:02.750
walked out with me out for the hall and

08:00.680 --> 08:04.819
nobody was left in the hall listen to

08:02.750 --> 08:07.190
other people they gave me their

08:04.819 --> 08:09.919
addresses and they said we want this

08:07.190 --> 08:11.629
only in our country and they wanted to

08:09.919 --> 08:16.099
search our centers and I am told they

08:11.629 --> 08:19.490
have already started centers the

08:16.099 --> 08:22.279
all-pervading power requires a medium to

08:19.490 --> 08:25.189
trigger something and when these people

08:22.279 --> 08:27.560
were created as realized Souls as they

08:25.189 --> 08:28.699
got connected with this all-pervading

08:27.560 --> 08:30.560
power

08:28.699 --> 08:35.990
I think they'd record it they had that

08:30.560 --> 08:37.399
confidence that courage in them because

08:35.990 --> 08:39.289
once we realized you become very

08:37.399 --> 08:42.760
courageous and you want to establish

08:39.289 --> 08:45.829
truth at any cost

08:42.760 --> 08:49.149
similarly the the West shall we call it

08:45.829 --> 08:53.290
the Western nations have had sahaja yoga

08:49.149 --> 08:55.630
available to them to to investigate to

08:53.290 --> 08:59.019
to see for themselves how it worked for

08:55.630 --> 09:02.139
20 years and yet it has been very slow

08:59.019 --> 09:07.750
to grow why is it happened this way do

09:02.139 --> 09:11.759
you think here people have so many

09:07.750 --> 09:15.550
diverse ideas about things they are very

09:11.759 --> 09:18.160
self opinionated also about things and

09:15.550 --> 09:21.190
the so-called man-made religions all

09:18.160 --> 09:23.319
over have also conditioned them too much

09:21.190 --> 09:27.430
they have other conditionings of

09:23.319 --> 09:31.560
different norms that they have as far as

09:27.430 --> 09:34.509
the social life is concerned and the

09:31.560 --> 09:38.139
physical appearances rather on a very

09:34.509 --> 09:41.259
superficial level so the people have not

09:38.139 --> 09:43.120
grown I think so much deeper of course I

09:41.259 --> 09:47.079
must say there are so many seekers in

09:43.120 --> 09:53.290
the West so many seekers and they were

09:47.079 --> 09:56.199
lost because as soon as people knew that

09:53.290 --> 09:58.870
there's a market for them the false

09:56.199 --> 10:02.199
gurus jumped out and they started

09:58.870 --> 10:04.350
preaching about false things just to

10:02.199 --> 10:07.510
earn money they were all money oriented

10:04.350 --> 10:10.120
now there's another psychology with the

10:07.510 --> 10:12.850
Western mind that you must buy

10:10.120 --> 10:15.819
everything if something is not for sale

10:12.850 --> 10:19.120
then it is useless and this psychology

10:15.819 --> 10:21.250
has really debted them to come to sahaja

10:19.120 --> 10:23.980
yoga very much because this is a living

10:21.250 --> 10:25.810
process and you cannot pay for it and

10:23.980 --> 10:29.110
they couldn't bear it I mean actually I

10:25.810 --> 10:31.949
must say one of the very important

10:29.110 --> 10:35.050
television gentlemen told me off that

10:31.949 --> 10:40.449
anglo-saxon brain cannot accept anything

10:35.050 --> 10:42.730
which cannot be sold I didn't know what

10:40.449 --> 10:45.490
to tell him I just said who has made

10:42.730 --> 10:49.060
this brain his God has made and why is

10:45.490 --> 10:52.779
it so so you have an expectation really

10:49.060 --> 10:53.439
that the syncro sahaja yoga will change

10:52.779 --> 10:56.290
the world

10:53.439 --> 10:58.990
of course it changes human beings and

10:56.290 --> 11:01.120
they manifest the change outside and we

10:58.990 --> 11:03.160
create a new race that's what they're

11:01.120 --> 11:05.949
talking about if you know they talk of

11:03.160 --> 11:06.730
new age of a new race but I don't know

11:05.949 --> 11:09.130
what is there

11:06.730 --> 11:10.990
Nation about it they talk about all this

11:09.130 --> 11:14.320
thing Aquarius and Aquarius is the

11:10.990 --> 11:17.380
Kundalini she is placed in the Aquarius

11:14.320 --> 11:19.360
and they talk about Aquarius and all

11:17.380 --> 11:22.300
kinds of things they're talking writing

11:19.360 --> 11:25.570
thinking about it but when it comes to

11:22.300 --> 11:28.649
actualization I think they think I am

11:25.570 --> 11:32.350
very too simple for them not complicated

11:28.649 --> 11:35.410
and sahaja Yoga is too simple it should

11:32.350 --> 11:37.660
be very complicated and all their own

11:35.410 --> 11:40.269
ideas about seeking that they must

11:37.660 --> 11:43.029
suffer they must go to Himalayas

11:40.269 --> 11:47.949
they must starve themselves and then

11:43.029 --> 11:51.130
only they can get realization Sri Hari

11:47.949 --> 11:55.870
is the evolution of the planet closely

11:51.130 --> 11:59.740
related to the evolution of humanity and

11:55.870 --> 12:02.260
he was related and the planet our planet

11:59.740 --> 12:04.329
is moving in a spiral way all the

12:02.260 --> 12:08.070
planets are moving in a spiral way and

12:04.329 --> 12:11.889
they are creating all possible things

12:08.070 --> 12:15.760
for the use of human beings so that they

12:11.889 --> 12:17.680
can save time save time for getting

12:15.760 --> 12:20.800
their ascent and for the meditative

12:17.680 --> 12:25.139
growth but people don't understand that

12:20.800 --> 12:28.029
part there are theories around now that

12:25.139 --> 12:30.310
the suggestions so we say that the

12:28.029 --> 12:34.569
planet could be a living organism a

12:30.310 --> 12:36.970
complete entity of course it is one of

12:34.569 --> 12:41.860
the examples of this one I can give you

12:36.970 --> 12:46.329
is that if you sleep under a coconut

12:41.860 --> 12:49.089
tree a coconut never falls on anything

12:46.329 --> 12:55.660
that is living whether it is a human

12:49.089 --> 12:57.910
being or a snake never falls that is so

12:55.660 --> 13:00.519
is it all around the world coconuts

12:57.910 --> 13:04.449
never fallen and living creatures so

13:00.519 --> 13:07.060
they understand we call it as Shri Paulo

13:04.449 --> 13:12.459
because because we think that it is like

13:07.060 --> 13:15.430
a brain which understands well if this

13:12.459 --> 13:17.319
world is a living organism what is the

13:15.430 --> 13:19.449
brain what drives this being this

13:17.319 --> 13:20.860
organism what has made it evolve the way

13:19.449 --> 13:23.600
it

13:20.860 --> 13:27.820
there is the subtle power which is

13:23.600 --> 13:31.460
all-pervading love God's love which

13:27.820 --> 13:36.890
manifests all the things like living

13:31.460 --> 13:38.030
work all nourishment all balancing it's

13:36.890 --> 13:41.690
so balanced

13:38.030 --> 13:46.550
if the Pacific was slightly deeper than

13:41.690 --> 13:53.000
this there would have been problems if

13:46.550 --> 13:54.680
Himalaya was safe one and a half times

13:53.000 --> 13:58.370
then what it is there would have been

13:54.680 --> 14:01.790
problems so everything is so balanced in

13:58.370 --> 14:04.730
nature hmm and the Almighty has created

14:01.790 --> 14:07.730
only one word only we human beings have

14:04.730 --> 14:11.720
divided and moved like criminals with

14:07.730 --> 14:14.440
our passports in our hands Shri Mata

14:11.720 --> 14:17.840
Hari what we have been talking about

14:14.440 --> 14:20.720
many people would regard as a belief or

14:17.840 --> 14:23.560
a theory how does one know that the

14:20.720 --> 14:26.300
difference between truth and a belief

14:23.560 --> 14:28.970
first of all anything for which you have

14:26.300 --> 14:31.730
to pay money is not the truth you can't

14:28.970 --> 14:36.380
pay for it if you cancel out that I

14:31.730 --> 14:41.630
think 99.9% all the falsehood will drop

14:36.380 --> 14:45.950
out but truth to be really actualized

14:41.630 --> 14:48.980
you have to have self realization then

14:45.950 --> 14:50.870
you feel on your fingertips vibratory

14:48.980 --> 14:53.420
awareness a new awareness a new

14:50.870 --> 14:55.990
dimension awareness by which you can

14:53.420 --> 14:59.840
make out what is true and what is false

14:55.990 --> 15:03.860
that's an absolute truth that you

14:59.840 --> 15:06.110
realize at that stage so one must have

15:03.860 --> 15:08.840
one's realization really to be able to

15:06.110 --> 15:12.860
tell the truth you want to follow anyone

15:08.840 --> 15:16.150
one must have realizes shri mataji thank

15:12.860 --> 15:16.150
you very much thank

15:17.350 --> 15:25.640
you know they are doing one thing doing

15:22.280 --> 15:26.930
one another I was reading an article

15:25.640 --> 15:30.050
just now where you were talking about

15:26.930 --> 15:32.660
inner peace and outer peace this seems

15:30.050 --> 15:34.670
to be something that attracts the

15:32.660 --> 15:43.720
attention of people in this present

15:34.670 --> 15:48.140
stressful age my realization what have

15:43.720 --> 15:50.230
you become a person and out with

15:48.140 --> 15:54.560
thoughtless awareness

15:50.230 --> 15:57.470
that means you see everything you

15:54.560 --> 16:02.890
witness everything and whenever you want

15:57.470 --> 16:07.630
to say or to think you can see about it

16:02.890 --> 16:20.090
but you don't react there's no reaction

16:07.630 --> 16:24.110
so you are empowered to see it in such a

16:20.090 --> 16:29.680
manner that there need not be any

16:24.110 --> 16:32.960
thought just the whole creation actually

16:29.680 --> 16:37.430
it's a very subtle thing is to be

16:32.960 --> 16:40.130
experienced and that is the point where

16:37.430 --> 16:43.370
we realize that we are the source of

16:40.130 --> 16:45.800
peace and that's how our inner peace is

16:43.370 --> 16:47.960
established now people have many

16:45.800 --> 16:50.240
foundations of peace I have known all of

16:47.960 --> 16:52.600
them they have no peace within

16:50.240 --> 16:55.190
themselves some people have got peace

16:52.600 --> 16:58.100
Awards there are horribly hot-tempered

16:55.190 --> 17:03.380
people but they have got to be some odds

16:58.100 --> 17:05.270
Nobel Prizes the peace has to be first

17:03.380 --> 17:11.360
of all found inside and then it

17:05.270 --> 17:14.090
manifests outside you know the another

17:11.360 --> 17:18.830
question we wanted to ask you is because

17:14.090 --> 17:20.959
of this rather useful way you use your

17:18.830 --> 17:23.870
hands to describe the movement of the

17:20.959 --> 17:26.209
chakra when they when they they part I

17:23.870 --> 17:28.820
wonder if you could just explain why

17:26.209 --> 17:29.390
when illness occurs it occurs because of

17:28.820 --> 17:31.340
the

17:29.390 --> 17:34.789
the movement away of one center from

17:31.340 --> 17:36.470
another alright what I try to show them

17:34.789 --> 17:38.840
that this is the left side this is the

17:36.470 --> 17:40.970
right side this is the left sympathetic

17:38.840 --> 17:43.519
nervous system say and this is the right

17:40.970 --> 17:46.610
sympathetic nervous system and really

17:43.519 --> 17:49.909
spinal cord looks like this and inside

17:46.610 --> 17:53.419
here is the spinal cord which has the

17:49.909 --> 17:56.299
centers in it the subtle centers now

17:53.419 --> 18:00.169
when you start using the energy of these

17:56.299 --> 18:03.590
centers say too much on the right and it

18:00.169 --> 18:06.080
starts moving more towards the right and

18:03.590 --> 18:08.980
there's a constriction and the power

18:06.080 --> 18:10.970
becomes less because you are exhausting

18:08.980 --> 18:13.909
going more towards the right side

18:10.970 --> 18:17.000
suddenly something happens and from the

18:13.909 --> 18:19.789
left if there's a jerk then the

18:17.000 --> 18:22.279
connection is completely broken this is

18:19.789 --> 18:25.340
on its own it starts working on its own

18:22.279 --> 18:28.279
that's what you say that this has become

18:25.340 --> 18:31.010
malignant I have no relationship with

18:28.279 --> 18:33.409
the whole to have the proportionate

18:31.010 --> 18:36.440
growth so if the nose starts developing

18:33.409 --> 18:38.990
it can cover your eyes and govern your

18:36.440 --> 18:41.840
mouth everything this is how a cancer is

18:38.990 --> 18:44.419
setting or any other disease there's so

18:41.840 --> 18:47.299
many psychosomatic diseases are nothing

18:44.419 --> 18:50.299
but somatic he is from the right side

18:47.299 --> 18:52.789
and when the psyche gives in then it

18:50.299 --> 18:55.340
becomes a psychosomatic disease there

18:52.789 --> 18:59.389
are so many diseases which are more

18:55.340 --> 19:02.210
psychosomatic than physical and these we

18:59.389 --> 19:05.720
call them as incurable can be easily

19:02.210 --> 19:08.299
cured by Kundalini awakening because

19:05.720 --> 19:10.669
when Kundalini passes through this she

19:08.299 --> 19:13.059
just integrates them for example she is

19:10.669 --> 19:17.389
going like this then she goes into this

19:13.059 --> 19:21.769
integrates them just like she strings

19:17.389 --> 19:24.620
them like pearls and so they are brought

19:21.769 --> 19:27.130
down and also she nourishes that Center

19:24.620 --> 19:29.330
that's what people get cured

19:27.130 --> 19:35.950
automatically by themselves by their own

19:29.330 --> 19:38.710
power Shri Mataji you ready

19:35.950 --> 19:41.500
she mythology do you want to speak to

19:38.710 --> 19:43.870
the IBC in Adelaide afternoon or would

19:41.500 --> 19:51.730
you rather that I rang them and said

19:43.870 --> 19:54.250
you're too busy abrupt yes I've been a

19:51.730 --> 19:58.120
lot of problems there abrupt and also

19:54.250 --> 19:59.560
very flippant I don't think they said

19:58.120 --> 20:03.970
they wanted to talk to you about false

19:59.560 --> 20:09.700
gurus and woke a few seconds what just

20:03.970 --> 20:10.990
do what all right they've been having a

20:09.700 --> 20:14.380
little trouble this morning you know we

20:10.990 --> 20:16.330
have banners to put up announcing your

20:14.380 --> 20:18.280
program tonight and they we had them on

20:16.330 --> 20:20.620
various bridges and I kept chasing them

20:18.280 --> 20:25.990
away but we finally found a place where

20:20.620 --> 20:30.220
they've allowed them to stay another

20:25.990 --> 20:32.740
piece that must be busy with big exits

20:30.220 --> 20:35.110
oh yes it's all very reserved places for

20:32.740 --> 20:36.640
addictions yes also if it was for the

20:35.110 --> 20:39.550
election it would be able to go up

20:36.640 --> 20:41.520
anywhere but if it's anything else

20:39.550 --> 20:46.200
they're not so happy

20:41.520 --> 20:46.200
that's was the attention enough
