00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.780
So, I thought today I could start just a little bit of background before going forward with

2
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.400
getting my self-realization in London.

3
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:31.800
I currently live in Florida, just an hour or so north of Alpina, who is in Miami.

4
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.880
I'm in a small town called Boynton Beach, very close to West Palm Beach.

5
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:46.760
And before that, I spent 25 years raising a family, three kids, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

6
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.760
And before that, was in California for many years.

7
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.560
And then there was a five-year stint in California in between as well.

8
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:09.000
So it was back in the 1980s, I was in graduate school.

9
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.840
And was, well, I had been a seeker like all of you my entire lifetime, lifetimes, and

10
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.780
had studied.

11
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.900
But I was very naive and very ignorant, especially when I first came to Sajyoga.

12
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.360
Yeah, I was often and only speechless in Shri Mataji's presence.

13
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.500
So unlike many of my brothers and sisters who were asking very deep and poignant questions,

14
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.360
I just sat there completely silent.

15
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:58.520
And I didn't have that kind of depth, you could say, although I was a very avid seeker

16
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:09.960
and had studied, you know, a lot of the ancient scriptures, a lot of the enlightened poets

17
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:20.440
and writers, a lot of the texts of the realized souls, and in that got very lost in a false

18
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.740
guru before coming to Sajyoga.

19
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:32.160
But fortunately, by Mother's grace, decided to leave the graduate program because I was

20
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.260
just miserable and found my way to England.

21
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.840
I left America with the attitude that there was nothing here for me, it hadn't satisfied

22
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.460
my seeking.

23
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.840
Although I didn't know what that seeking was for, or was about, just knew that it was something

24
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.340
that I didn't have.

25
00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:07.540
And so I dropped out of the PhD program, which was, yeah, it was a lot of work to get there.

26
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:16.900
So it was a lot also to give it up, but decided I was going to continue this journey and see

27
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.560
where it took me and found my way to England, where I was working as an au pair.

28
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:32.980
And two years before that, while I was exiting a class that I was co-teaching as the extracurricular

29
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.440
activity and new age consciousness, I met this young man who had a backpack, who was

30
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.900
backpacking across America.

31
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.020
And we became, we entered into a conversation.

32
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.320
He was the seeker, I was a seeker, he ended up staying and visiting for more than a week.

33
00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.360
And we developed a close friendship and became pen pals.

34
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.200
And we wrote for more than a year, year and a half, maybe almost two years, about our

35
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.920
journey seeking.

36
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.320
And I knew that he lived in the UK.

37
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.400
And when I was there, I rank him up and he mentioned that he had been speaking for a

38
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.560
few months about Shri Mataji and his postcards to me and invited me to a program at Caxton

39
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.520
Hall.

40
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.240
So I made my way there.

41
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.000
And this was in the summer of 1981.

42
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.960
I remember very little about what Shri Mataji said.

43
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:44.720
I only recall being amazed that I realized everything she said was true.

44
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:56.260
And I had always felt that with so many of the individuals in the field of spirituality

45
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:03.560
that I had come across in my seeking, that there was always something that left me wanting

46
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.120
a lot of truth, but a lot of untruth with it.

47
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:16.960
So when I met Shri Mataji on that first day, I was thrilled and very excited that here

48
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.900
was somebody who spoke the truth.

49
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.400
And throughout her lecture, I remember thinking, oh, that makes perfect sense.

50
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:33.360
Why didn't I realize that or I should have known that or why didn't I think of that?

51
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.920
So after the program, everybody left.

52
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.440
I was one of the last to leave.

53
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.240
I made my way down to the sidewalk outside of Caxton Hall.

54
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:51.840
And I saw this group of young people standing about, oh, maybe 30 meters away.

55
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.360
And I had this desire, this thought, wow, they seem like such cool people.

56
00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.000
I'd love to have friends like them.

57
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.920
So one of the yogis walked over and invited me for pizza with the group.

58
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.000
And from then on, it was no turning back.

59
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.560
I spent all of my free time at any one of the three ashrams at the time.

60
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.080
Of course, the first being Chelsea Road.

61
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:29.960
And there was, I think Malcolm was living there, Linda Williams, and quite a few others.

62
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.320
There was Earl's Court where my dear sister, Felicity, besistered me.

63
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.800
And I spent my weekends.

64
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.960
She had the tiniest little room.

65
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.160
It was about six by eight.

66
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.680
And I was on the floor and literally floorboards in Earl's Court ashram.

67
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.080
Chaya and Reggie lived there and other yogis.

68
00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:03.240
And then of course, where Mother lived at Bromham Court Gardens, I think it's called Brompton Court.

69
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:10.680
And Jamal, Mio, Rosie, and others lived there as well.

70
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:18.080
I don't think Ray lived there, but a number of other yogis as well.

71
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.840
And I spent all of my free time there.

72
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:36.080
So I will fast forward now to, well, there was a wedding with the 16 yogis in Chelsea Road.

73
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.800
And I had taken my camera to take some pictures of Mother.

74
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:46.760
And at that time, I'd only been in sahaja yoga for less than a month.

75
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.320
And I did not recognize Shri Mataji.

76
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.040
But I remember at one point going to snap a picture of her.

77
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:01.120
I believe it was after the marriages had concluded.

78
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.480
And she looked at me.

79
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.200
She lifted up her sari.

80
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:18.200
And she revealed to me her very beautiful burgundy and gold buckled pumps, her shoes.

81
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:25.200
And I took a picture of her showing me what appeared to be brand new shoes, having no

82
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.240
clue at all what she was doing in that moment.

83
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:37.080
So there's also another photograph of Olympia from that day sitting on Shri Mataji's lap

84
00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.000
that has circulated for many years.

85
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And there's this halo around both Olympia and Mother.

86
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.800
And in that picture, she looks a lot like the mother with child.

87
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.320
It's a very sweet photograph.

88
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.680
So that was a huge blessing.

89
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.600
We move forward about a month.

90
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.400
The yogis were trying to convince me to return with Shri Mataji on her trip to America.

91
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:15.320
And for me, my desire was to move forward to Europe and to continue to explore the world.

92
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.760
I didn't understand nor yet value the gift that I had been given.

93
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:30.560
But I was avidly trying to experience what I was hearing everyone talk about.

94
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.760
And I didn't feel vibrations.

95
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.680
I don't recall feeling thoughtless awareness.

96
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:44.200
But I did have one experience which I will communicate, even though it did not directly

97
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.640
involve speaking with Shri Mataji.

98
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:58.720
But it was instrumental for me in recognizing the reality that Self-realization bestows

99
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.400
upon us.

100
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.000
So I had been quite sick.

101
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.400
That evening, there was a meeting at the Quaker Friends Meeting House in Hampstead.

102
00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.680
And I made my way there.

103
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.800
I would walk about two kilometers to the train station.

104
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.360
I was living in the Twickenham, Richmond area.

105
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.840
And then get on the train and then take a bus to Hampstead.

106
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.920
So it was a bit of a journey.

107
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.320
I was feverish.

108
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.320
I was quite sick.

109
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.640
But I was determined to get there.

110
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.180
And while I was there, a yogi worked on me.

111
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.220
And he asked, are you foot soaking?

112
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.820
So I replied, no, what's foot soaking?

113
00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.940
And I went home that evening to foot soak.

114
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:51.760
And mind you, I had not felt the vibrations, nor the cool breeze.

115
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:59.700
So that evening, while I was foot soaking, at one point, I looked at mother's picture.

116
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:05.340
It was in the old days, they used to give a Xerox copy on like pink paper of the all

117
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.320
aspects photo or green copy paper.

118
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.840
And so I had put it in frame.

119
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.840
And I was looking at the photograph through the candle.

120
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.180
And Srimataji's photograph transformed into a mirror.

121
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.680
And I was looking at myself.

122
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.080
And I thought, oh, this is not real.

123
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.800
Am I having a delusion?

124
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.400
I had been feverish that evening.

125
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.880
So I'm looking one direction than the other.

126
00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.500
It's not changing.

127
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.980
It's a mirror.

128
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.580
And I'm looking at myself.

129
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:48.020
And at that moment, I had the thought, she is in me, and I am in her.

130
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:53.380
And at that moment, my Kundalini soared up.

131
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:58.980
And I felt these tremendous vibrations in the palm of my left hand.

132
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.740
And I could take with my right hand and move these vibrations

133
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:11.400
and everywhere I put my hand and moved my hand, these vibrations were flowing with my hand.

134
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.120
And that was the first moment for me.

135
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.560
It was a miracle experience.

136
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.520
And it empowered me to continue to pursue this.

137
00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:31.200
So then about a month later, Srimataji had called all the yogis together in London

138
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.620
to give them instructions while she was away on the tour of the US.

139
00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:42.020
I think it was about six-week-long tour, more than a month.

140
00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:47.900
And the yogis had been, Linda Williams had been trying to push me to go with her.

141
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:55.860
And I had been declining to even consider it.

142
00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:03.160
That evening, she spent a good number of hours, three or four hours, speaking to the collective.

143
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:08.120
I imagine there were about 40 or 50 yogis there.

144
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:18.800
And she was giving instructions how to do Havan for America, what gifts to purchase

145
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:26.420
for when she returned and took the Yogi's on Indian tour.

146
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:32.820
She met individually with yogis and was speaking and giving individual counsel.

147
00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:38.700
And at the very end of the evening, she asked for the American girl.

148
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.820
And I was sitting in the very back.

149
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.920
And I didn't realize that Srimataji was referring to me.

150
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.020
She asked a second time.

151
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.400
And at that moment, Felicity, who was sitting beside me, started elbowing me in the ribs

152
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.020
to say, Srimataji is asking for you.

153
00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:05.420
So I raised my hand and she said, I'm leaving in the morning for America.

154
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.880
Can you join me?

155
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:14.360
And at that moment, the first thought that came through my head was, I wonder if I've

156
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:17.060
saved up enough.

157
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:27.160
Before I could finish the thought, Srimataji said, I've already purchased your ticket.

158
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.260
So my mind raced ahead.

159
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:37.060
And I'm wondering, where am I going to stay?

160
00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:43.020
She's going to a number of cities where I don't know anyone.

161
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.180
Who am I going to?

162
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:51.140
And before I could finish the thought, once again, she said, you will be staying with

163
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.120
me throughout the tour.

164
00:14:54.120 --> 00:15:00.220
And I also had the thought, how am I going to travel?

165
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:09.840
To go from New York to Texas to, she was going to be in Philadelphia and California.

166
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:16.860
And before I could finish the thought, she said, all of your expenses will be covered,

167
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.520
are being covered.

168
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.800
And they're taken care of.

169
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:25.120
You don't have to worry about any of those expenses, as you will be traveling and staying

170
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.320
with me.

171
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:34.180
So that, you know, I had already said yes, Srimataji, once again, always in Mother's

172
00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.600
Presence, I was forever speechless, almost.

173
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:45.820
There were a few occasions where I did ask a question, but most of the time, I didn't.

174
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.580
I was always admiring my brothers and sisters who came up with these lofty questions to

175
00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:52.640
ask Mother about the world.

176
00:15:52.640 --> 00:16:01.380
And I was, I just didn't have that depth at that point.

177
00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:09.260
So she instructed a few of the brothers to take me back to the house where I was staying

178
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:15.940
and to bring me back to sleep on the floor of the meditation room where she was living

179
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.740
at Brompton Square.

180
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:29.620
And the next morning, I find myself at the airport with Srimataji and Sursi P. And maybe

181
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:36.600
about a half a dozen or so yogis, two of them sisters, Felicity and Rosie.

182
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.940
And I had made a copy of the photograph of Olympia sitting on Mother's lap for both of

183
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.780
those sisters as a gift.

184
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:57.020
And when I took them out to hand it to Felicity, the first, Srimataji was standing to my right,

185
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:04.000
and she saw the photograph and took it out of my hand and said, Oh, is this for me?

186
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.580
And then Sursi P. saw the photograph in Mother's hand and said, Oh, is this for me?

187
00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.480
So he took the photograph from Mother.

188
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.760
And then I gave the second copy that I had made for Rosie and Srimataji took, she saw

189
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:25.100
that in my hand and handed the one to Sursi P. And then I handed her the second one.

190
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.260
And the next thing were on the airplane to come to the States.

191
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.220
She was traveling in coach.

192
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:42.540
And I was sitting a ways back on that airplane was a contingent of musicians who were in

193
00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:49.780
an orchestra in the UK, and they were going to America to perform.

194
00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.660
And I had put the little photograph, a little black and white all aspects photo of Mother

195
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.120
on the back of the seat in front of me to meditate.

196
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.480
And this gentleman next to me, who was in the orchestra had asked about Srimataji, got

197
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.680
his realization and asked to meet her.

198
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:14.380
And Mother being as gracious as ever, I had gone up when she had woken up, well, Mother

199
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.740
never sleeps, but she had been with her eyes closed.

200
00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:28.180
And she was very gracious to meet him and to speak with him, to bless him.

201
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:33.660
And you could just see the tremendous joy on this gentleman's face.

202
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:39.260
So I won't forget that she was accessible always to everyone.

203
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:48.720
We arrived in New York, and we stayed at the Prince George Hotel, if I remember correctly.

204
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.760
There was a small group of yogis.

205
00:18:51.760 --> 00:19:02.720
I don't recall anybody else being on that flight except Nima, Nirmala, Nirmala Modi,

206
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:12.500
Rajesh's sister, who was attending to Srimataji, but there were others who also arrived.

207
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:17.520
One was Warren.

208
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:23.640
Further on in the tour, others came from Australia, but at that point, there were very few.

209
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.860
Marsha was there, Linda Taylor's sister.

210
00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:31.040
There were two rooms, one for the sisters and one for the brothers.

211
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:35.440
And I believe there were four of us in the one room of ladies.

212
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.200
I don't remember who else was there.

213
00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:44.540
I know Kay came on that tour from Australia, but I don't recall whether they were actually

214
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:49.780
in New York or came in Los Angeles.

215
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.780
And Diane from Australia was there as well.

216
00:19:53.780 --> 00:20:04.820
So we were at the hotel, and Srimataji did seven programs over seven nights.

217
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.960
The first of the programs were at a place called the East-West Center.

218
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:18.920
And then the very last program was at a huge church in uptown Manhattan.

219
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.160
That was a Baptist church.

220
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:29.520
And Srimataji had given realization to the, I think he's called the minister, and had

221
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.840
spoken to him.

222
00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:38.360
And she had said to him that now he could give realization to, he could give second

223
00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.880
birth to all of the congregation.

224
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.480
Let's see.

225
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:51.040
So there were a couple of experiences in the hotel.

226
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:59.960
The first day she had asked us to all go and reach out to anybody who we might know, relatives,

227
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:07.320
friends, colleagues, anybody, to let them know about the programs.

228
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:22.400
And I had been in a relationship with a young man before getting my realization.

229
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.560
And we had separated.

230
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:31.040
And for me, staying in London on my own was, it's the first time I was away on my own.

231
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:36.680
And it was, I just remember thinking to myself, put one foot in front of the other, and you're

232
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.720
going to be okay.

233
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.440
And that was just less than a week before getting my realization.

234
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:55.200
But I want to say that after realization, I began to see how the divine power, the deities,

235
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.500
the devas had been guiding me.

236
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.440
So we have this notion of free will.

237
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:19.200
And I was beginning to recognize, at least for myself, that every moment I was being

238
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:32.200
directed and guided by the divine power, by the deities, by the devas, the angels, and

239
00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:42.300
that they were guiding me each and every step of the way to find the Devi in this lifetime.

240
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.980
And I know we have this idea of free will.

241
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:52.280
I don't know if other yogis feel the same way about this, but I really felt at that

242
00:22:52.280 --> 00:23:01.400
time that I was completely under this divine direction.

243
00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:09.240
And I didn't feel, I mean, it wasn't a thinking thing or an emotional thing.

244
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:21.300
I didn't feel that I had this.

245
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:28.740
The divine was guiding me in an unconscious way and gave me experiences and thoughts and

246
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:34.700
ideas that dictated my choices and decisions.

247
00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:41.380
And I don't think without the divine having, I don't know what better word to use than

248
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.380
control.

249
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.380
It's not control.

250
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:50.720
But this idea of free will was absolutely not a part of the equation at that time and

251
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.900
to this day.

252
00:23:53.900 --> 00:24:02.200
So I don't feel without the divine having been so powerfully instrumental in guiding

253
00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.500
me at that time that I would be here today.

254
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:12.440
A little thing, like I was on my way to the very first program at Caxton Hall and I got

255
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.480
to the front doors.

256
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480
It seemed early.

257
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:17.740
Nobody was there.

258
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:23.740
And I turned, I thought to myself, I had no idea about who Shri Mataji was, but I had

259
00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:30.180
this thought, I should be bringing flowers and walked back to the subway station, the

260
00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:40.360
underground and bought a bouquet of flowers then to offer to the lady who was arranging

261
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:48.060
the flowers on the altar beside Shri Mataji's chair before she had arrived.

262
00:24:48.060 --> 00:25:00.380
It was always little things like that, that were not of my own volition or my own willpower

263
00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.740
or thought process.

264
00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:12.920
So that being said, I went to go notify this young man who I had been in the relationship

265
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:18.080
with that I was in the US, in New York.

266
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.080
I knocked on the door.

267
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.720
He answered, and what are you doing here?

268
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.560
So I explained, I invited him to meet Shri Mataji.

269
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.760
He agreed.

270
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.520
And he followed me back to the hotel that day.

271
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.920
We got back, mother had just finished lunch.

272
00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.360
We walked in the door.

273
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.420
I introduced her to him and him to her.

274
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.780
And she called him up.

275
00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.000
He slipped off his shoes.

276
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.860
He was wearing a dress shirt, a button down.

277
00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:52.300
He worked at the bank of the Fed, the Federal Reserve.

278
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:59.060
And he had just called in to say that he wouldn't be coming to work that day.

279
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:04.420
So he went down on his knees before Shri Mataji.

280
00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.740
And she slipped her feet out from under her sari.

281
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.680
And he bowed down and put his head on her feet.

282
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:19.060
And at that moment, mother pointed to the base of his spine.

283
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.740
And the room was silent.

284
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.520
You couldn't, you know, there wasn't a sound.

285
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:30.920
But as she pointed, we could see the Kundalini pulsating.

286
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:36.720
And it was pulsating and rising up to the Nabhi chakra where it stopped.

287
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.880
And it was pulsating.

288
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:44.240
And some of you may have heard this story before, how all of a sudden the spinal column,

289
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:52.040
which was in this shape, we heard a loud crack like lightning.

290
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.900
It was so powerfully loud.

291
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.960
And all of a sudden, we could see the spine go like that.

292
00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.220
And the Kundalini shot up.

293
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.320
And Shri Mataji mentioned that.

294
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:12.320
And he sits up and she says to him, I leave next week for Houston.

295
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.660
Will you chaperone me?

296
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:23.640
And I remember thinking, oh, dear, this can't be happening.

297
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.440
I panicked.

298
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.800
I thought to myself, we can't be together.

299
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:42.640
I had spent the last month and a half working on myself, the Mooladhara to reestablish my

300
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.860
chastity.

301
00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:51.260
And I was terrified that here we're going to be traveling with Mother together.

302
00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.840
This can't be.

303
00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:56.340
But he said yes.

304
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.020
He accepted her invitation.

305
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:04.240
She told him to go get his things and to move into the hotel room with the brothers.

306
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.100
There were three brothers staying in the room.

307
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:15.440
And she asked me to accompany him to help him show him and to bring him back.

308
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:23.020
So I'm going with him back in those days, we didn't have suitcases or luggage, we had

309
00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:25.220
backpacks.

310
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:39.360
And he put what he wanted in his backpack and left the job and left the flat.

311
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:44.360
And we went to go back to the hotel.

312
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:55.300
So we just heard a talk this past weekend during our weekly collective meeting here

313
00:28:55.300 --> 00:29:01.480
in South Florida, although it's Florida-wide, our evening Saturday collectivity is broadcasted

314
00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.160
statewide.

315
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:09.680
And there was a talk that we listened to, I believe it was 1980.

316
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:21.560
Let's see, what was the talk?

317
00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.840
In the talk, all I can say is in the talk.

318
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:32.280
So she talks about how the Divine has instilled within us the desire to get married, that

319
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.200
it is innate, that is an innate desire.

320
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:43.040
That was not something I had ever been interested in nor thought about.

321
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:50.680
And yet as we were returning back to the hotel, standing under a street lamp about to cross

322
00:29:50.680 --> 00:30:02.440
the busy intersection to the underground Metro, I felt this powerful energy rising within

323
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.640
me.

324
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.180
And I had this very strong desire to get married.

325
00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:15.120
And I turned to him and said to him, we should get married.

326
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:22.400
Which shocked me that those words were coming out of my mouth, but I was filled with joy.

327
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:30.200
And I did not realize that he had sent an engagement Sapphire in platinum for me that

328
00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:35.520
was currently or had been traveling across to England as I had been flying across to

329
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.240
America.

330
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.420
And it did come back.

331
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.620
So I still have it to this day.

332
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:49.200
We went back to the hotel room, he got settled and I returned to mother's room.

333
00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:55.060
I was also, she had asked for me.

334
00:30:55.060 --> 00:31:01.060
She went to retire to her bedroom for a nap.

335
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.260
And I sat to meditate.

336
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:10.420
And at that moment, while I was sitting there in that time, I felt my Kundalini rising very

337
00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.080
powerfully.

338
00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:17.960
And I had the thought, she Mataji is doing it.

339
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:23.420
And she wanted me to know that she was doing it.

340
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.500
And at that moment, she called for me, she called my name.

341
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.500
So I went in.

342
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.140
And she spoke a lot of times.

343
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:41.180
I don't have like Avdou did all of these, he shared photographs of experiences with

344
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:50.560
mother that pertain to collective growth, collective understanding, collective matters.

345
00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:57.620
With mother for myself, it was it was generally personal, for the most part, although there

346
00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:02.260
are, I will share many of them in spite of the fact that they're personal, because I

347
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:09.640
feel that they are really beneficial for, for a lot of us that she, she was helping

348
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:15.360
me to grow and transform.

349
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:22.100
And that the same lessons that she was teaching me can, can help others.

350
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:31.400
So I sat there as she was talking about the horrible banking system in America, as she

351
00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:39.880
was speaking about how harsh the hotel shampoo was and asked me to go get her a different

352
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.560
brand of shampoo.

353
00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.400
I don't think I fulfilled that one.

354
00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:52.320
I mean, what I picked was probably something equally as bad as the hotel.

355
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.800
She she at one point, she was wearing glasses, and she took her glasses off.

356
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.440
And she looked at them and said, glasses are good.

357
00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.440
They slow you down.

358
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:06.680
And I remember thinking, what does that even mean?

359
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.840
And it took me years until a sister said she was telling you to slow down.

360
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:17.000
So it's true, you know, she, Mataji never came out.

361
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.680
Well, that's not true.

362
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:22.060
She didn't often come out and correct us.

363
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.960
So directly, often it was indirectly as in that situation.

364
00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.760
And afterwards, I asked mother, I said, Mother, Michael and I would like your blessings to

365
00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.360
get married.

366
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:40.280
And she spoke with me about him and myself, and she gave her blessings.

367
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:48.240
And then later that week, she took us to the diamond district, the jewelry district in

368
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.180
New York City.

369
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:56.020
And she instructed him what to buy, you know, how to shop for a diamond.

370
00:33:56.020 --> 00:34:02.080
She wanted a specific diamond, it was to be 16 points, just good as it wasn't more because

371
00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.720
we had very little money in those days.

372
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.280
And yeah, I'll share this story.

373
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:14.520
I've told it before, even though it didn't directly involve Shri Mataji per se, she dropped

374
00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.420
us off in the diamond district.

375
00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:26.440
After instructing Michael, you know how to purchase the stone and to make the ring.

376
00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.080
And so we spent the afternoon looking and it was a Friday and it was getting late by

377
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:38.240
the time we found the diamond that Shri Mataji had very detailed explained the clarity, the

378
00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.360
color, the size, and so on.

379
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:49.440
So we went over to the big building that was the jewelry mart and it was empty, it was

380
00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440
dark.

381
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.560
It was still open.

382
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.840
It was around three o'clock.

383
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.000
Most of the jewelers were of the Jewish faith.

384
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.600
And so it being Sabbath, the place had closed and it was cavernous.

385
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.600
It was huge.

386
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.720
And there were all these blue booths with like flexible bulletproof glass, you know,

387
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:13.200
that lined the rows of the floor.

388
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:21.280
And we inquired, there was one jeweler who was still there, who agreed to set the stone.

389
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:25.440
And we were to come back in two hours, which we did.

390
00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.000
And Michael paid him.

391
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.560
He came over and he went to slip the ring on my finger.

392
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:39.120
And at that moment, my Kundalini came up so strongly that I lost consciousness and I fainted.

393
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:45.760
And he grabbed me so that I didn't hit my head on that marble floor.

394
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:52.120
And I remember just realizing at that moment that the marriage was done.

395
00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:56.720
It was solemnized by the divine.

396
00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:02.680
And I knew that at that moment, Mother had taken care of all of those worries and fears

397
00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:07.760
and it was a new chapter.

398
00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:13.840
So let's see, moving forward.

399
00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:20.960
That was the tour, the last night, the seventh night at the church in uptown Manhattan.

400
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.360
I don't remember the name of the church.

401
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.360
I'm sorry.

402
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.320
It was a Baptist and it was grand.

403
00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.320
It was huge.

404
00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:34.760
There was another large cathedral that Mother had spoken in many years later in the 90s.

405
00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:40.880
It was called St. John of the Divine at Columbia University.

406
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.060
So it was a big hall like that.

407
00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.720
Maybe not quite as big.

408
00:36:47.120 --> 00:37:04.920
That was the talk where Shri Mataji announced that she was the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit.

409
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:10.960
She started to walk off the stage but stopped and turned around and declared that I am the

410
00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.960
Holy Ghost.

411
00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.200
I am the Holy Spirit.

412
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.880
I was sitting there and I remember, yes, Kay was there.

413
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.680
I remember Kay being there as well.

414
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:30.300
And I was in awe.

415
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:34.680
There were no words and there were no thoughts.

416
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:46.200
I just was transfixed that this was the moment of a lifetime.

417
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.860
Mother had asked for...

418
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:58.960
Most of the tour, most of that tour was spent writing press releases and putting ads in

419
00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.620
the papers and securing speaking venues.

420
00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.640
Nothing had been done there.

421
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:15.840
There were no sahaja yogis except for Dr. Warlicker in Los Angeles and Steve Kirby and

422
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.680
Christine in Boston.

423
00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:23.760
My mother went there for one day.

424
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.320
And we did have a puja on Staten Island.

425
00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.360
It was a relative of Shri Mataji.

426
00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.680
Gregor was there.

427
00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.680
And we did...

428
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.680
It was Navaratri.

429
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:44.240
I believe it was October because this was the last maybe 10 days or so in September

430
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.880
that the tour was in New York.

431
00:38:48.880 --> 00:39:00.880
So there were maybe about 12 or so of us, maybe 15 at that puja, which I think might

432
00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:06.380
have been the very first puja in the United States.

433
00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:11.120
So it was a puja to the goddess, to Durga.

434
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:18.560
I remember just the vibrations were so strong, my subtle system couldn't tolerate it.

435
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.960
I had been so badly damaged in my seeking with the false gurus.

436
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:30.560
And I studied parapsychology and worked in that field as well at the Neuropsychiatric

437
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:36.800
Institute in Los Angeles and other places like acupuncture clinics and worked with healers.

438
00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.820
And I did Karelian photography.

439
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:44.700
So I had really been...

440
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:52.940
There was a lot of damage on the physical, mental and emotional level.

441
00:39:52.940 --> 00:40:03.420
I was standing with mother before I was blessed to be in her hotel room with her most of that

442
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:05.860
time in New York.

443
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:17.180
And I remember finding one of her hair on the plate of food that she had eaten that

444
00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.180
day.

445
00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:23.660
And so I saved that piece of hair.

446
00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:31.100
And when I was with her at one point, I asked mother if I could keep it.

447
00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:33.020
And she agreed.

448
00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:41.820
I knew that her hair was bestowed by Lord Yama, the god of death, and that it was a

449
00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.820
huge responsibility.

450
00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:57.820
She instructed me how to do puja to it every day by cleaning it with coconut oil.

451
00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:06.740
And I made a little pillow that I had threaded it onto a satin pillow in a glass box.

452
00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:13.380
And each day, cleaned mother's hair.

453
00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.260
And she said it was for my protection.

454
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:24.860
So there was a call in the 90s to return her hair.

455
00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.140
And at that point I did.

456
00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:31.420
I felt at that point that it wasn't necessary.

457
00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:36.140
We had collectivity all over the country by then.

458
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:45.260
But back in 1981, there was really just not even a handful of us.

459
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:46.880
Let's see.

460
00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.540
Anything else about New York?

461
00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.340
Yes.

462
00:41:52.340 --> 00:42:02.180
I was going to mention that we were leaving for a public program.

463
00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:07.740
And mother stopped in the doorway and she turned around.

464
00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.860
I was behind her that time.

465
00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.580
And she just looked at me and tilted her head.

466
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:20.780
And she was looking and she was asking me, who is the false guru that you went to?

467
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:23.980
She knew I had talked with her about that.

468
00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.100
But I had never mentioned who it was.

469
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:37.920
At that moment, I mentioned his name and her eyes grew enormous and full of wrath.

470
00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:44.340
And I felt like I could just shrivel up and just sink into the mother earth.

471
00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.300
She was furious.

472
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.140
And she said, how could you?

473
00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.500
He's a murderer.

474
00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:58.420
And of course, as a naive seeker, we were told that he had been imprisoned for murder

475
00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:06.500
because he, like so many other great realized souls, had been persecuted and tortured and

476
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:10.240
poisoned and crucified.

477
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:16.340
And he was placed by the disciples and his followers in that category.

478
00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:21.540
And I just didn't know any different.

479
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:26.360
So these were some of the interactions from that time.

480
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:38.560
She also, as we were getting that same time after she said that, she said, the time for

481
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.640
suffering is over.

482
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.340
Your suffering is over.

483
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:50.700
And I asked mother at that moment, why did I have to suffer so much as a child?

484
00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:55.620
I was quite unwell.

485
00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.620
I could go in.

486
00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:02.780
I mean, we all come from, you know, all different backgrounds, but mine was specifically I had

487
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:11.140
run away from home, got in trouble with the law, had done drugs, etc, etc, etc.

488
00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:18.960
Because, you know, my father was tremendously unwell, having nervous breakdown.

489
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:25.300
And as the oldest of five, that was the responsibility to hold it together because my mom wasn't

490
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:26.640
capable.

491
00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:36.760
So I just I asked mother at that same time, you know, why did I go through?

492
00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.780
Why did I have to suffer so much?

493
00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:49.460
And she said, so that you could recognize and appreciate the light is the way is the

494
00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:53.940
words that she spoke.

495
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.700
One time I was holding a bag of chana.

496
00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:01.640
She had always requested that we have a bag of chana before the public programs and we

497
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:08.420
know that mother ate the chana as she consumed the negativity, the the boots and the vadas

498
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.500
of the seekers in the audience.

499
00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:25.500
And I said, I was terribly misidentified growing up in a very Zionist Jewish upbringing.

500
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:31.540
I asked her, you know, the Jews are lost as mother, the Jews are just completely lost.

501
00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:37.220
Can you please save them as many as are in this bag of chana?

502
00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:43.820
And she just looked at me with a big smile and she said that could be difficult.

503
00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:51.740
She said it as if, hmm, there were a lot of chana in the bag.

504
00:45:51.740 --> 00:46:04.580
So she sent me ahead to California to plan the programs of which nothing had been prepared.

505
00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:11.720
There were no halls, no advertisements, nothing had been done for the time that she was going

506
00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:16.300
to be in Los Angeles or Santa Cruz.

507
00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:21.220
That's the tour where Gregoire had asked her to please go to Santa Cruz because it was

508
00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:29.140
a Mecca of seekers and it's a place that because of the weather and and a number of other things

509
00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:32.080
was inundated with false gurus.

510
00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:37.480
And so his concern for the false gurus led him to ask mother to go to Santa Cruz.

511
00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.920
And this was the tour where she went there.

512
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.360
She sent me ahead.

513
00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:48.640
She went to Houston and Michael went with her to Houston and I went on to Los Angeles.

514
00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:59.040
And she had given me the phone number and name of a woman who I reached out to, but

515
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.720
nothing came from the conversation.

516
00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:12.340
And then Dr. Werlecker, who was very busy and didn't have time to get together.

517
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:25.000
So my days were spent booking, researching and booking halls, putting ads in the newspapers,

518
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.560
getting the hotel room and reserving a car and things of that sort.

519
00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:35.520
And then picking shimatuchi up and I was staying with my parents and at that time they

520
00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:41.480
were very unhappy that I was no longer in that PhD program and that I was in this what

521
00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.760
they thought was a cult.

522
00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:54.480
So let's see.

523
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.460
There were more Australians that came at that point.

524
00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:01.660
We stayed at a hotel called the Shangri-La.

525
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.780
Mother had, there was a suite.

526
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:10.660
Mother had a room and some of us stayed in the other room and then there were rooms for

527
00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:15.500
the yoginis and for the yogis.

528
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:22.500
Mother did a series of programs at a school in the auditorium.

529
00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:32.820
And we were in the hotel room one day and she had asked for a hair dryer, which I had

530
00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.880
brought, which I brought from home.

531
00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:42.020
And she turned around to me and she said to me, you know, why is it that your parents

532
00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:45.380
are against the sahaja yoga?

533
00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.740
I didn't know how to answer the question.

534
00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:55.260
She pointed to her nose and said, can't they see I have a Jewish nose?

535
00:48:55.260 --> 00:49:07.220
So there was a lot of, you know, attention on me and drama and shimatuchi told me, forget

536
00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.020
them.

537
00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:17.240
She spoke those two words, which are seared in my memory, forget them.

538
00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:26.280
And I understood after years of grappling with how do I best do this, that she wanted

539
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:33.200
me to become completely detached, unemotionally involved, no emotion.

540
00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:42.200
However, to still maintain the dharma of a daughter, because without that I was inviting

541
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:51.120
just a way, what's the word, an enormous amount of negative attention.

542
00:49:51.120 --> 00:50:00.280
So I needed to learn how to walk a very fine line between being gracious and civil and

543
00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:08.520
responsible and I guess you could say dutiful and at the same time being completely detached

544
00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:14.880
and emotionally uninvolved.

545
00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:17.480
And that was a struggle.

546
00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:28.280
But I feel like that was a task that she had set out for me in this lifetime.

547
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:33.600
And I feel that it went pretty well.

548
00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.960
So what else about Los Angeles?

549
00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:44.720
I'll just, okay, now let's see.

550
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:50.000
After one of the programs, she had invited some of the seekers back to the hotel room

551
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:57.560
and the next day, she was dictating a press release to submit to the newspapers.

552
00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:02.040
And there was a young man that came who had attended the program.

553
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:09.380
And I remember he asked Shri Mataji about the big earthquake, when is it going to come?

554
00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:20.280
And she got very annoyed and she said to him, with a very stern and authoritative and strong

555
00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:24.680
voice, don't ask for it yet.

556
00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:28.920
We have too many that need to be saved.

557
00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:34.640
There are too many that need to be saved.

558
00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:46.560
To me, it stood out because he was asking what seemed rather innocently the question.

559
00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:53.800
And yet, we could tell from a comment like that, all the levels that she was working

560
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.800
on.

561
00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:06.160
Okay, I want to just say here, I owe a debt of gratitude to the Australians who came to

562
00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:14.000
California at that time, to Los Angeles, they brought with them 21 cassette tapes, which

563
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.560
was the first I ever received and they were a lifeline.

564
00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:24.280
They brought photographs of mother.

565
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:34.600
They I just know their generosity, their love, their attention that year and in subsequent

566
00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:40.000
years were everything.

567
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.760
Their support was incredible.

568
00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:57.680
So my love to the Australians for having come on that tour and helped in so many ways.

569
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:03.800
There's one last thing about Los Angeles that I'll mention, there was a public program one

570
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:12.120
evening and afterwards, there was a woman in the back who raised her hand, but when

571
00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:18.360
she called on her, or maybe it was Warren, she couldn't speak.

572
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:25.200
She was just, you know, there were tears and mother said to her, you can, you're smelling

573
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:33.040
my you're smelling the fragrance that yes, what you're smelling is me.

574
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:40.840
And shortly after that, another seeker in the audience asked mother about the Vietnam

575
00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:51.360
war and about the slaughter of the people in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge.

576
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:58.180
And I'll mention this because I mean, I don't know whether the Q&A for that public program

577
00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.880
if it was recorded.

578
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:06.300
But what mother said really made a big impression on me.

579
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.240
And she asked this woman, she said, why are you feeling guilty?

580
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.280
Did you?

581
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.860
Have you killed anyone?

582
00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:19.000
Have your parents or your was it your ancestors who who have done these atrocities?

583
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.760
Why are you feeling guilty?

584
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:27.780
She was really hammering on how in America, and I can say that I've seen this year after

585
00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:33.960
year that the majority of Americans the left is shooty is, is really one of the greatest

586
00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.920
problems obviously coming from Muldarrab.

587
00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:45.000
But nevertheless, this left is shooty, especially in the women is in transient to set the right

588
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
word.

589
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
It just often doesn't budge.

590
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:55.840
It's so like rooted into the subtle system and psyche of America understandably.

591
00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:03.200
And she she went on to say, you know, it's not your fault.

592
00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.800
You you don't bear any of the responsibility.

593
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:12.300
And then she stopped and paused.

594
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:19.800
And she then said, Well, in fact, yes.

595
00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:26.360
You do bear Americans do bear some of the responsibility.

596
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:31.140
You eat a lot of beef.

597
00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:37.460
A lot of the cows sacrifice their lives for you.

598
00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:46.420
And they are, I don't know if she used the word blessed, they evolve.

599
00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:53.100
And so they have to evolve as well.

600
00:55:53.100 --> 00:56:05.880
And she made us understand that we do not need to feel guilty for the death of these

601
00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:14.660
innocent or maybe not innocent souls, but it's through this means that at this time,

602
00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:18.320
the evolution is progressing faster.

603
00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:25.540
She said, they have to get their realization one day as well.

604
00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:35.400
So in other words, what I understood from that was that the slaughter of the souls in

605
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:46.960
this country was in some way sanctioned by the divine, so that these souls could evolve.

606
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:52.840
And at some point, also receive their self realization.

607
00:56:52.840 --> 00:57:01.520
Okay, so the tour ended in for me, in Santa Cruz, I think mother may have gone to Vancouver

608
00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:03.640
for one day.

609
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:11.040
I had during my time while she was in Houston, flown up to Santa Cruz to reserve the do the

610
00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:16.520
same thing, find a hall and place the ads in the newspapers, there were actually quite

611
00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:23.640
a lot of people that came back then a lot was around 50 or 60, maybe 100.

612
00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:32.760
We were all sitting on the floor in a hall, it was a like a yoga studio, how it was a

613
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:36.560
yeah, it was some kind of studio.

614
00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:43.240
And there was also a radio station broadcasting from the same facility in Santa Cruz.

615
00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.780
She did three programs there.

616
00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:52.580
And I don't have a lot of recollections about that time.

617
00:57:52.580 --> 00:57:54.880
It was very busy.

618
00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:06.360
We were all day postering, you know, reaching out and fliering.

619
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:12.200
So before we knew it, mother was leaving.

620
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:17.920
And she had asked Michael and I to remain in Santa Cruz to look after the seekers.

621
00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:25.240
We had agreed, she wanted to make sure that he would be able to get a job which ended

622
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:31.320
up not being so easy as we had assured her.

623
00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:39.400
And we were at the airport saying goodbye to mother, it was just Michael, myself and

624
00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.400
mother.

625
00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:43.400
I don't know why the other yogis weren't there.

626
00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:47.200
Some had already left.

627
00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:54.840
But it was the three of us and she at that point took off the bangles from her, her hand

628
00:58:54.840 --> 00:59:03.560
and put them on me on my arm and said these bangles are for your protection.

629
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:09.160
They will absorb the negativity and break so that you don't.

630
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:21.320
And so to this day, I am grateful that mother had I, I didn't wear them all till they broke.

631
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:25.200
There are still a few that are in the altar.

632
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:31.360
And I take all the new bangles and put them in salt water next to the bangles that mother

633
00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:40.560
gave and vibrate them and I feel that they have been a protection as well as the bandhan

634
00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.000
all these years.

635
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:51.480
So I feel like it's something she it's a gift of the Devi to the women, the bangles.

636
00:59:51.480 --> 01:00:00.080
So that's another aside.

637
01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.400
Mother came in 1983.

638
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.680
Again.

639
01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.880
Oh, I want to share.

640
01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.880
Do we still have time?

641
01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.720
Are we out of time?

642
01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.520
When we won't be out of time until you finish tracing.

643
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:21.440
Okay, I'd love to share.

644
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:31.240
Staying with mother in the hotel room in 1983 in San Diego.

645
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:42.680
So there were very few times that I actually spoke to mother without having first been

646
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.120
spoken to by her.

647
01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.200
But we had woke up in the morning.

648
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:58.640
And she asked me to retrieve a sari from her luggage.

649
01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:04.400
And I took it out of the suitcase, the one that she had asked for.

650
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.880
And it was all crumpled.

651
01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.900
It was badly wrinkled.

652
01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:16.200
And so I offered to iron it for Shrimataji.

653
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.680
And she said, No, that's okay.

654
01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.600
But still being incredibly ignorant.

655
01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:34.240
And couldn't bear the thought of mother wearing a wrinkled sari, obviously, little did I know,

656
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.800
offered again, and a third time, on the third time, she accepted the offer.

657
01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.240
And I took out the ironing board.

658
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:55.040
And having been a fairly decent person capable of ironing, proceeded to iron Shrimataji sari,

659
01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.360
except it wouldn't stay on the ironing board.

660
01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:03.880
It fell onto the floor, I picked it up, put it back on, started ironing again, and she

661
01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:08.000
sat on the bed just watching with a big smile.

662
01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:12.080
Again, went to iron and again, it slipped off.

663
01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.520
And I'm thinking, what the heck is going on?

664
01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:19.760
I lifted it up again, a third time, ironing.

665
01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.400
And once again, there it goes, slides right off.

666
01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:32.320
And at that moment, realized my folly and pulled my ears and humbly picked up the sari.

667
01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.680
And mother laughed and said, That's all right.

668
01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.120
I'll take it.

669
01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:43.120
And she went into the into the restroom.

670
01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:51.840
And when she came out, there wasn't a wrinkle or a spot it had been soiled as well.

671
01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:56.560
It looked completely brand new.

672
01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:03.120
And once again, I just pulled my ears.

673
01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:10.160
We were returning after the programs in San Diego to Los Angeles that year for a public

674
01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.560
program in Los Angeles.

675
01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:21.720
And so that I think it was the following day, perhaps, that we were getting ready to leave

676
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.200
the room and drive back up.

677
01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:31.320
And I had opened the door to let mother exit the room.

678
01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:34.640
And she stopped in the doorway.

679
01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.680
So I was holding the door.

680
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.120
And I turned around, and she wasn't moving.

681
01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.360
She just stood there.

682
01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.360
And I'm sure I have that.

683
01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:53.280
Well, maybe some of you have heard this because this was one of the most memorable moments

684
01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:57.680
of all of those times with Shri Mataji.

685
01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:11.200
And she said to me, Do not listen to anyone who tells you that you are too right sided.

686
01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:15.560
I need you to do my work.

687
01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:21.520
And then she said, I am depending on you.

688
01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:29.120
I cannot depend on and then she was talking about yogis who were left sided and, you know,

689
01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:35.400
drinking tea, and some other things which we don't need to allude to.

690
01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:40.060
But she said, you have to do my work.

691
01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:41.760
And then she made a promise.

692
01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:51.040
She said, if there is anything you want to do for Sahaja Yoga, I promise you will have

693
01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.440
everything you need.

694
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:59.200
I think she said all the resources you need to do it.

695
01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:04.480
And I have lived by that promise every day.

696
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:08.100
Well, at least I've tried.

697
01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:15.560
And there have been so many times where, so I'll just mention that since then, I've come

698
01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:24.760
to understand that my strong desires, which mostly evolve in meditation, are actually

699
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:32.320
her desires that she's bestowing upon me or giving to me.

700
01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:39.720
And sometimes it takes a while for them to sort of percolate matriculate up into my attention

701
01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.560
into my awareness.

702
01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:49.060
And it is a process of growth and evolution that these desires that have come up in me

703
01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:52.840
over the years.

704
01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:58.680
I know yogis say we should be desireless, or we shouldn't have an ego, but that's not

705
01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:03.200
been my experience.

706
01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.960
Sometimes these desires get so strong.

707
01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:13.520
There have been times where, I'll mention one example, it was the Culture of the Spirit

708
01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:16.780
tour in 2013.

709
01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:21.800
We were doing a summer family art camp.

710
01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:25.780
This was pre-Nirmal Arts Academy.

711
01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:31.920
But nevertheless, we had been inviting the artists like Sandesh and Guruji and Avanendra

712
01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:43.320
and Anandita and Kinga came to teach dance and there were many who came.

713
01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:51.960
And so I had this strong desire that these great artists should have an opportunity to

714
01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:57.240
perform on a world class stage, not just for giving realization.

715
01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:59.520
Yes, that's part of the equation.

716
01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:12.520
But it was my desire that they experience really the glory that they deserve, that they

717
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:22.600
have earned by the merits of their artistry.

718
01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:34.560
There were so many times on that tour where the desire was under attack or thwarted, where

719
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:39.480
we needed funding from the National Council and it was declined.

720
01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:45.480
And then a couple of Yuvas put together an Indiegogo campaign to raise money and the

721
01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.520
National Council said, no, they didn't want that to be done.

722
01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:54.920
I just remember once again, bowing down to Mother with tears saying, I know you want

723
01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.000
this to be done.

724
01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.400
So I've tried and I haven't been successful.

725
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.480
It's not happening, Mother.

726
01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.600
You have to do it.

727
01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:11.720
And just as every other time, she fulfilled her promise every time.

728
01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:19.280
And not only that, but I really had a strong desire to give compensation to the artists.

729
01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:28.520
I felt that it was incumbent upon us to not just reimburse them for their airfare, but

730
01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:36.920
they are giving weeks of their time and that we should compensate them financially.

731
01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:47.360
And once again, Mother came through and it was a real, you know, I was incredibly grateful

732
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.680
that she provided all the means to make those things happen.

733
01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:59.440
And I feel like they were her desires that were just the instrument by which, I mean,

734
01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:08.360
you could say she's desireless, her desire, but it's as if she knows what each of us is

735
01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.000
capable of, obviously.

736
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:22.160
And we each have our dharma to fulfill those capacities, to use them in whatever way we

737
01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.520
can for the spreading of sahaja yoga.

738
01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.360
In my life, it's been raising three children.

739
01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:42.560
Two of them are married in sahaja and providing opportunities for seekers and yuvas and brothers

740
01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:43.560
and sisters.

741
01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:52.040
It's just, I haven't, you know, we each will have different functions and roles to play.

742
01:09:52.040 --> 01:10:03.760
So the development of kenujahari was a big part of my life in sahaja and running children's

743
01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:11.520
camps and yuva seminars and puja seminars and health and wellness camps and the summer

744
01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:17.680
arts academy, which became the family summer arts academy before the Nirmal arts academy.

745
01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.200
It wasn't an academy.

746
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.960
It was a camp, the summer family art camp.

747
01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:28.240
And now it's minivashi, but back then it was the health and wellness seminar.

748
01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:41.880
So watching those evolve over the last 30, 40 years has really been a gift to me.

749
01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:54.280
And again, this notion that to be egoless has also never quite sat in the exact manner,

750
01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:05.800
but more that the faculties of our intellect to be enlightened and used by the spirit,

751
01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:13.740
not that we are controlled by it, but that it is at the bequest of the divine.

752
01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:18.920
So just slightly different perspective.

753
01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.800
Okay.

754
01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:28.440
I would like to share one other story, which was real.

755
01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:35.760
I'm sure you know, everyone here has witnessed miracles that mother has performed.

756
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.680
This one was quite profound and dramatic.

757
01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:41.080
It took place in Cincinnati.

758
01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.920
I don't remember the year it was in the nineties.

759
01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:53.560
She had a public program at an outdoor amphitheater called Eden park, which is just outside of

760
01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:57.280
the downtown Cincinnati area.

761
01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:03.920
And after the program, she welcomed the members of the audience to come up and to meet and

762
01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:13.400
greet and one by one, they came and I was sitting on one of the benches towards the

763
01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.400
front.

764
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:22.900
It was outdoor seating and just, I think I was caring for somebody's child while they

765
01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:26.480
were attending to mother.

766
01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:37.040
And at one point, this I'd say young man, he must've been in his twenties.

767
01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:47.160
He came up and he was grossly deformed, probably the most deformed human being I've ever seen

768
01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.920
in my life.

769
01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:51.440
He could not stand up straight.

770
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:58.540
He was completely bent over with the hands, pretty much touching the ground.

771
01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:05.000
And he had a very difficult time walking.

772
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:12.540
He was, you know, it was almost as if every bone in his body was broken or looked to be

773
01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:16.100
deformed.

774
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:22.780
And he went up to Srimataji and she worked on him and she had, I believe a few of the

775
01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:28.060
others work on him as well with candle, possibly.

776
01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:36.920
I don't remember how long this lasted, but as mother worked on him, the deformities began

777
01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:45.980
to give way until this young man was standing fully erect.

778
01:13:45.980 --> 01:14:02.600
And before our eyes, we watched this, you know, really badly affected human being stand

779
01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:12.460
up in his complete potential, you know, his complete, I would say glory.

780
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:19.260
And Srimataji instructed him to continue to come to the weekly meetings.

781
01:14:19.260 --> 01:14:29.320
She asked a few of the yogis to assist him, to give him information about the follow-up.

782
01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:41.920
And as he began to walk off the stage, which was probably about 20 meters, because it was

783
01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:57.860
a rather large stage, as he took step after step, he slowly returned into that deformed

784
01:14:57.860 --> 01:15:04.640
posture.

785
01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:15.960
And by the time he got to the end of the stage, he was back into the same position that he

786
01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:21.480
was when he climbed the stairs to go on the stage.

787
01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:34.300
And at that moment, mother had pointed to him and said, see, he is unable to forget.

788
01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.120
It's his memory.

789
01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.000
He cannot forget the past.

790
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:45.160
And she was quite strong about it.

791
01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:55.240
There might be others who remember a little more in detail, if she had said anything else.

792
01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:01.260
But that was the gist of it, that it's our memory, our conditionings that act through

793
01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:22.940
our memory that control us, that keep us from fully, from being capable of sustaining

794
01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:33.380
the advances, the heights, or the growth that we experience.

795
01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:42.020
So that was the lesson at Eden Park in Cincinnati.

796
01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:48.240
Okay, I'll just do one more.

797
01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:54.060
This was, let's see, my oldest son was around 15.

798
01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:57.240
So that would be around 98.

799
01:16:57.240 --> 01:17:05.060
Shrimantaji came to Washington, DC.

800
01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:11.640
And our oldest son Joshua had been fortunate to have a lot of opportunity to spend time

801
01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.400
with mother.

802
01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:23.100
He had, year after year, gone up onto the stage begging mother to make it possible for

803
01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.880
him to go to Dharamshala.

804
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:33.640
And this one year at the Center for Ethical, the Society for Ethical Studies or something

805
01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:40.360
in Central Park in New York, again, he went up on the stage begging her.

806
01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:47.160
And she said, you know, without your father's permission, that's another story for another

807
01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:55.560
day because Michael wasn't practicing, has not been practicing for many years.

808
01:17:55.560 --> 01:18:05.400
So she had said, it's just not possible without your father's permission, but maybe I'll,

809
01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.880
or I might have to write him a letter or something like that.

810
01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:15.520
So he was attending to her, helping carry the luggage.

811
01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:23.600
And I think we were on the tram, the trolley, out to the gate to see mother off.

812
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:29.440
So the CP was there and Joshua was carrying the briefcase.

813
01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:34.920
And we came to the gate back in those days, you could go all the way through.

814
01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:44.800
And there was a group, maybe 30 or 40 yogis that had accompanied mother to the airport.

815
01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:54.840
And I went to, she allowed each of us to, she spent time to say goodbye to each one

816
01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.160
of us.

817
01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:04.480
And I went with the three children and bowed down at mother's feet, the four of us together.

818
01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:13.160
And when I sat up, she looked at me and said, and she always called me Tracy, the children

819
01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.960
are very good.

820
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.520
They are connected.

821
01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:22.980
You are connected to me and they are connected to you.

822
01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:29.120
And I understand what she was, she knew how much I sort of grieved that they hadn't been

823
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:36.440
able to attend Sahaj schools, the Rome school or Boratyn or Darmshad.

824
01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:44.160
And that was always something that was a bit of a sadness within me for them.

825
01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:58.280
And I feel what she was saying is that when we do her work, she looks after all those

826
01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.000
whom we love.

827
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.400
So I really felt that she was sharing that message.

828
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:15.600
I felt it very strongly that, well, just that.

829
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:23.880
And I suppose we've come to a good place to stop.

830
01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:30.400
I wanted to mention that because I hope we can share that with a lot of people that are

831
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:37.120
coming to Sahaja Yoga nowadays.

832
01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:46.320
That if they can understand the value of being the instrument of the Divine, then the Divine

833
01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:54.040
will look after all of their concerns, all of their problems and all of their loved ones.

834
01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.160
Jai Shree Mataji.
