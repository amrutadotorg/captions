00:07.800 --> 00:17.300
Modi must have told you very clearly about
how to grow in Sahaja Yog because he’s one

00:17.300 --> 00:26.010
of them who has really taken very positive
step to see that he grows.

00:26.010 --> 00:33.050
Now one has to understand one simple point
about realisation is that, just mere awakening

00:33.050 --> 00:39.370
of the Kundalini is not sufficient, that’s
just the beginning.

00:39.370 --> 00:48.559
You get your realisation but you must become
the tree, you have to grow, you have to become.

00:48.559 --> 00:57.020
If you cannot grow then you have not achieved
what you wanted to be.

00:57.020 --> 01:09.070
And you grow very fast, very fast with meditation
and with understanding about meditation.

01:09.070 --> 01:17.820
Now one of the few hurdles that we have, that
I’ve seen it, that are innately built in

01:17.820 --> 01:20.420
Sahaja Yog itself.

01:20.420 --> 01:25.810
One of them is that you get it spontaneously
so easily that you take it for granted.

01:25.810 --> 01:28.640
This is in the pattern of it, only innately
built.

01:28.640 --> 01:35.000
You see what ever you get so easily you just
take it for granted.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.110
But the another side of it is like that, that
when you have your eyes you don’t know the

01:41.110 --> 01:43.690
value of your eyes, you take it for granted.

01:43.690 --> 01:47.930
But when you don’t have them then you know
the value of eyes, it’s like that.

01:47.930 --> 01:55.200
So when you lose vibrations and when you get
out of Sahaja Yog, then you start feeling

01:55.200 --> 02:03.469
much more lost and then you come back to Sahaja
Yoga again.

02:03.469 --> 02:10.489
Like a person becomes rich, he enjoys the
riches and then you make him poor then he

02:10.489 --> 02:12.870
feels it more.

02:12.870 --> 02:14.340
So this is the correcting point.

02:14.340 --> 02:22.980
But it is very true that Sahaja has this thing
innately built in its self that it all happens

02:22.980 --> 02:30.349
very spontaneously and you get it for doing
nothing at all.

02:30.349 --> 02:41.709
So, may be so many of you may lose it because
you might find that it is just you got it

02:41.709 --> 02:42.709
because of something.

02:42.709 --> 02:48.140
I’ve also known of people they get vibrations
and they say, “Now it’s all right I don’t

02:48.140 --> 02:49.940
need Sahaja Yoga, I am on my own."

02:49.940 --> 02:56.099
Again they’re back like bad pennies with
some troubles and some problems and then they

02:56.099 --> 02:57.099
go out.

02:57.099 --> 03:03.931
Now I would say that Modi is one of those
first twelve people who got realisation, after

03:03.931 --> 03:09.129
two years I’ve worked on them, while you
got realisation in such a short time.

03:09.129 --> 03:16.470
Two years I’ve worked on twenty five people
out of which twelve got realisation you can

03:16.470 --> 03:21.690
imagine, two years! As I’ve told you in
London I’ve worked on six people for four

03:21.690 --> 03:26.769
years to give them realisation.

03:26.769 --> 03:34.540
But once a certain number of people of particular
ideologies of permutations and combinations,

03:34.540 --> 03:41.459
once they get realisation I find the rate
of realisation increases very fast.

03:41.459 --> 03:47.240
Like formally we never use to have anybody
in the program who has been to any other Guru,

03:47.240 --> 03:48.730
just avoid them.

03:48.730 --> 03:55.180
Even up to the point that this Modi himself
used to tell people there’s no program today,

03:55.180 --> 03:56.480
no program.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.890
And they would ring Me up and find out that
there was a program and why they were not

03:59.890 --> 04:00.890
allowed.

04:00.890 --> 04:02.330
They said “Mother we get headaches you see.

04:02.330 --> 04:06.930
They break our necks and they just disturb
us and they are good for nothing."

04:06.930 --> 04:12.830
But now, it’s very different, once we have
built up our strength of collectivity we have

04:12.830 --> 04:17.160
so many channels, things are working out very
differently.

04:17.160 --> 04:24.630
So the value that Modi would attach to his
realisation is much more than you would attach

04:24.630 --> 04:26.350
normally.

04:26.350 --> 04:36.380
Because as you see, first even say to have
a ordinary oil lamp was a problem.

04:36.380 --> 04:39.530
So the oil lamp was very important for people.

04:39.530 --> 04:44.450
They would see to it that they would not use
out all the oil and they were so careful.

04:44.450 --> 04:48.670
But today we have no problem, we have got
electricity we take it for granted.

04:48.670 --> 04:53.460
Only when the electricity goes off we know
what is electricity is.

04:53.460 --> 05:03.190
In the same way your realisation also, when
it is lost you understand the value of it.

05:03.190 --> 05:09.720
But supposing you have just touched it and
then you lose it, then you do not understand.

05:09.720 --> 05:15.260
But if you’ve got it you’ve enjoyed it
then you lose it then you want it back again,

05:15.260 --> 05:21.280
so best thing is to be steadily moving towards
your evolution.

05:21.280 --> 05:27.850
Now after I go away that’s the fears people
have here that people start doubting.

05:27.850 --> 05:31.120
They said, “It happened with people they
started doubting."

05:31.120 --> 05:33.090
Doubting what?

05:33.090 --> 05:37.680
Your doubting yourself is the main point is.

05:37.680 --> 05:41.470
You cannot believe that you can get realisation.

05:41.470 --> 05:44.210
This is the basic.

05:44.210 --> 05:53.240
You see to Me, it seems that you feel that
how can you get realisation?

05:53.240 --> 06:00.240
Only those who are very highly realised souls
know that you are realised, they know that

06:00.240 --> 06:04.630
you have been given realisation, but they
also sometimes ask Me, “Why did you give

06:04.630 --> 06:05.630
them realisation.

06:05.630 --> 06:12.910
What have they done?” Because you also think,
I mean we still have to look forward to something

06:12.910 --> 06:14.230
else.

06:14.230 --> 06:16.340
How can we get realisation, this is the trouble

06:16.340 --> 06:19.330
You don’t believe in yourself.

06:19.330 --> 06:24.370
That’s what you have to have confidence
in yourself and then you’ll have confidence

06:24.370 --> 06:27.060
in Me also.

06:27.060 --> 06:31.960
Because there are so many ways, by which you
can verify.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.000
First of all

06:33.000 --> 06:44.470
you can ask questions to the photograph or
to Me in your heart, about Myself, My relationship

06:44.470 --> 06:50.810
what ever you think could be, what ever you
think, put your imagination and see that what

06:50.810 --> 06:52.740
you think I could have been.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.260
Ask that question.

06:54.260 --> 06:57.300
Your vibrations will answer.

06:57.300 --> 07:03.980
Put your, stretch your imagination to the
last, what could be the last word you could

07:03.980 --> 07:05.540
think of Me.

07:05.540 --> 07:11.820
You see, some people will put doubts saying
that, “Kundalini awakening is very difficult,

07:11.820 --> 07:13.880
it is not easy."

07:13.880 --> 07:19.820
Yes it’s true, it’s not easy, it’s a
very difficult things for human beings.

07:19.820 --> 07:23.070
You just can’t do it, is a fact.

07:23.070 --> 07:32.130
You have to work for days with some guru in
some jungle all alone, seeing nobody, working

07:32.130 --> 07:35.960
out your chakras by chakras, sometimes you
have to starve, sometimes you have to eat,

07:35.960 --> 07:39.700
sometimes you have to breathe, you have to
do all kinds of things.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.090
And then the guru can work out.

07:41.090 --> 07:51.780
But there could be someone who is somehow
the master, could be someone.

07:51.780 --> 07:58.240
Kundalini is the Holy Ghost within you.

07:58.240 --> 08:06.000
So there could be someone like that who can
do the job and that is what it is.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.550
These things put you into doubts, because
you can’t believe it.

08:13.550 --> 08:16.240
In relation to yourself you can’t believe
it.

08:16.240 --> 08:20.420
You can believe in God, you can believe in
Holy Ghost, you can believe in Christ but

08:20.420 --> 08:27.300
you cannot believe that it has any relationship
with you, that you could be that great, that

08:27.300 --> 08:30.230
you could get your realisation.

08:30.230 --> 08:32.140
So just feel it and enjoy it.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.430
First of all, don’t think, that’s why
I say, “Don’t think."

08:34.430 --> 08:36.871
Because as soon as you start thinking, Mr.

08:36.871 --> 08:43.159
Thomas in you will get up and say that “Hello,
this cannot be Self-realisation."

08:43.159 --> 08:44.159
Mr.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.180
Thomas was great, you see.

08:46.180 --> 08:52.830
Christ had all the disciples and I find all
those types around, permutations and combinations

08:52.830 --> 08:56.820
and some how Judas also, but they’re rarely
to be found.

08:56.820 --> 09:05.240
But there are, no doubt and some are Thomas’s,
and these Thomas’ are described as murmuring

09:05.240 --> 09:06.890
souls by Christ Himself.

09:06.890 --> 09:11.640
He said, “These are murmuring souls,”
and they murmur and one murmuring soul comes

09:11.640 --> 09:16.880
to you, another murmuring soul in you joins
hands and you start all murmuring together,

09:16.880 --> 09:17.880
start thinking.

09:17.880 --> 09:22.560
Now at that time what have you to do on rational
grounds is very simple.

09:22.560 --> 09:25.140
What have I done so far?

09:25.140 --> 09:31.970
I’ve done everything, did I get cool breeze?

09:31.970 --> 09:35.830
Did I get my self realisation?

09:35.830 --> 09:40.210
Did I feel my own powers?

09:40.210 --> 09:43.210
Have I been able to feel myself and others?

09:43.210 --> 09:49.900
Because you see your still not fully realised,
you may not be able to feel the vibrations

09:49.900 --> 09:54.680
of another person, neither you will be able
to feel your own vibrations.

09:54.680 --> 10:01.520
But there are so many people here who are
realised and they can feel yours, and they

10:01.520 --> 10:02.600
can verify.

10:02.600 --> 10:08.930
Supposing they ask you, “How is your father?”

10:08.930 --> 10:12.300
There was one gentleman in England he came
and told Me, “Why is everybody asking me

10:12.300 --> 10:13.300
about my father?”

10:13.300 --> 10:17.750
I said, “Because there’s one particular
centre that’s catching,” and I called

10:17.750 --> 10:22.030
a child I said now tell Me, “What is the
centre catching?” She pointed out this one

10:22.030 --> 10:23.900
and I said, “This is the centre."

10:23.900 --> 10:27.070
Everybody is catching on this centre, this
is the father centre so they’re asking you

10:27.070 --> 10:28.180
about your father.

10:28.180 --> 10:32.330
He said, “Yes he’s dead and he died of
cancer and he had this and that,” and we

10:32.330 --> 10:33.770
had to treat him.

10:33.770 --> 10:39.930
For example anorexia is a disease can be cured
by curing this centre.

10:39.930 --> 10:47.900
It’s such a deep knowledge and it is such
an all pervading knowledge.

10:47.900 --> 10:56.310
Because once you know in a tree the sap that
goes to all the leaves and all the ends of

10:56.310 --> 11:01.361
it and if you can move the sap, your attention
can move with the sap, you can know the whole

11:01.361 --> 11:03.850
of the tree.

11:03.850 --> 11:08.950
You cannot know leaves and then know the tree.

11:08.950 --> 11:10.990
How many leaves can you count?

11:10.990 --> 11:16.130
But to know the tree the best thing is to
get to the sap.

11:16.130 --> 11:20.550
To treat a tree is best is to get to its sap,
isn’t it?

11:20.550 --> 11:30.830
In the same way when you go from inside out
then you find that you know yourself and others

11:30.830 --> 11:31.830
very well.

11:31.830 --> 11:35.740
It’s very simple even small children can
do it.

11:35.740 --> 11:42.000
So the first doubt comes about yourself, “Oh
this is one of them” because there’s a

11:42.000 --> 11:43.490
guru shopping going on, you see.

11:43.490 --> 11:50.769
There’s a guru shopping, there’s a float,
you go to one guru to another, to ESPs and

11:50.769 --> 11:58.150
what you call them, all sorts of things, mediums,
and all sorts of things they do with the dead

11:58.150 --> 11:59.740
bodies or anything.

11:59.740 --> 12:03.700
All these things you have been to and you
will have found it.

12:03.700 --> 12:09.720
So now suddenly you have to come to a temple,
where you don’t pay anything and you just

12:09.720 --> 12:10.720
get the blessings.

12:10.720 --> 12:16.420
So can’t believe it, you just can’t believe
it, it’s too much to believe.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.120
This is what happens you get

12:18.120 --> 12:19.120
confused.

12:19.120 --> 12:25.220
You are all ready confused, but confusion
could be over by understanding that something

12:25.220 --> 12:29.890
is happening to you just wait and see, give
it a chance.

12:29.890 --> 12:37.760
There’s no way we can bind you to Sahaja
Yoga, because there’s no mesmerism here.

12:37.760 --> 12:41.350
This is another innately a problem with Sahaja
Yoga.

12:41.350 --> 12:47.490
Second problem I should say is that you’re
too free to do what you like, absolutely free,

12:47.490 --> 12:55.690
there’s no binding force except that you
feel the love of your Mother.

12:55.690 --> 12:59.690
Supposing you are not feeling the vibrations
in your hand, there’s no way of binding

12:59.690 --> 13:01.840
you down to Sahaja Yog, nothing.

13:01.840 --> 13:06.960
We just advise “Go ahead, it will work out,
let it work out."

13:06.960 --> 13:11.810
There is no fees, there’s no registration,
there’s no compulsion, nothing.

13:11.810 --> 13:14.200
It’s your own free will.

13:14.200 --> 13:19.740
If you want to stick on you can stick on,
if you want to go away you can go away.

13:19.740 --> 13:22.880
There’s no force on you of any kind.

13:22.880 --> 13:28.540
There’s no registration of your names with
some fees or anything, I mean you are not

13:28.540 --> 13:31.240
bound to pay anything.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.211
If you paid something then you feel, “All
right I’ve paid for it, so go through it

13:34.211 --> 13:35.800
what ever it is, good or bad..

13:35.800 --> 13:39.960
Supposing you go to see a play and it’s
a horrid play but still you say, “All right

13:39.960 --> 13:42.570
I’ve paid for it so let me go through it."

13:42.570 --> 13:48.290
But that you cannot do with Sahaja Yog because
you’ve not paid.

13:48.290 --> 13:52.920
There’s nobody will force you down, nobody
will go on telephoning to you, “Come along,

13:52.920 --> 13:54.630
please come along,” and all that.

13:54.630 --> 13:58.029
So the attitude has to be changed, it is I
who has to gain.

13:58.029 --> 14:01.920
Say there’s a beautiful spot somewhere.

14:01.920 --> 14:07.279
Now that beautiful spot doesn’t send an
invitation card to anyone, everybody goes

14:07.279 --> 14:08.279
there.

14:08.279 --> 14:12.190
But if you have not yet discovered the beauty
of Sahaja Yog in that way and have not enjoyed

14:12.190 --> 14:15.541
it fully, you’ll have to go again and again
and see for yourself.

14:15.541 --> 14:23.670
It is a deliberation on your side not on the
side of the Sahaja Yogis or Sahaja Yoga.

14:23.670 --> 14:26.500
It’s not going to fall at your feet.

14:26.500 --> 14:32.410
That please come to Sahaja Yoga, please donate
something, nothing of the kind.

14:32.410 --> 14:38.970
If you come you are welcome, if you don’t
come, welcome.

14:38.970 --> 14:44.500
On the contrary, you will be surprised there’s
more rejection than acceptance in Sahaja Yog.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.060
That’s also innately built.

14:46.060 --> 14:50.021
I’ve seen some people who are very insincere
type they just go out from Sahaja Yoga like

14:50.021 --> 14:51.650
a tangent.

14:51.650 --> 14:57.300
There was a gentleman who was very troublesome
to us in Bombay and we didn’t know what

14:57.300 --> 15:06.170
to do with him and he just got transferred
from there and we got rid of him.

15:06.170 --> 15:14.650
So you just go out of Sahaja Yoga like a tangent
and we are saved from the botheration.

15:14.650 --> 15:19.660
Because you must understand, if you have problems,
if you are not all right it’s a problem

15:19.660 --> 15:21.520
for Sahaja Yogis to correct you.

15:21.520 --> 15:27.910
It’s just the other way round, if you understand
this, then you will understand the thing,

15:27.910 --> 15:28.910
what works out.

15:28.910 --> 15:33.700
For example if I have to cure somebody it’s
a problem for Me and not the problem for the

15:33.700 --> 15:35.910
person who’s sick.

15:35.910 --> 15:43.290
Now if the tree has to grow is the problem
for the gardener not for the tree.

15:43.290 --> 15:52.110
So the tree must see to it that it co-operates
with the gardener and gets itself developed.

15:52.110 --> 15:58.170
If this understanding is developed, that it
is I who has to gain, it is I who has to go

15:58.170 --> 16:06.190
forward, Mother has not to gain from me anything,
She wants me to have all my powers manifested.

16:06.190 --> 16:13.740
She wants me to grow through it, if this attitude
is developed then you’ll work hard to grow

16:13.740 --> 16:15.980
and you’ll work it out.

16:15.980 --> 16:21.710
But on the contrary you see at the slightest
protest if you ego stands up and says, “Why,

16:21.710 --> 16:25.980
why should I do this?”

16:25.980 --> 16:31.810
To overcome this hurdle you see, we have to
build up certain stages.

16:31.810 --> 16:35.970
That’s what Modi was telling Me.

16:35.970 --> 16:40.110
That you first become thoughtlessly aware,
see that silence is established.

16:40.110 --> 16:47.020
There are certain things that you do much
later, everybody is not allowed in there,

16:47.020 --> 16:54.470
because truth can be only born by people who
are strong enough to bear it.

16:54.470 --> 17:03.900
That’s why I’m not going to tell you who
am I, till you reach a certain stage, because

17:03.900 --> 17:05.470
you cannot bear the light.

17:05.470 --> 17:08.100
That’s what happened with Christ.

17:08.100 --> 17:12.440
They crucified Him because they could not
bear Him.

17:12.440 --> 17:19.319
Human beings are like that, they can’t even
bear an incarnation of love.

17:19.319 --> 17:23.260
They can’t even bear love, it’s too much
for them.

17:23.260 --> 17:29.190
Even if you give them too much love they get
upset, they get disturbed, they just can’t

17:29.190 --> 17:30.190
bear it.

17:30.190 --> 17:34.781
So you have to build up yourself to come to
a certain stage of understanding of Sahaja

17:34.781 --> 17:35.781
Yoga.

17:35.781 --> 17:37.450
It’s a state, which you achieve.

17:37.450 --> 17:39.410
It’s a state.

17:39.410 --> 17:45.660
You are not to be certified by anyone on the...But
it’s a state where you will start giving

17:45.660 --> 17:52.179
realisation to others and the whole way you’ll
be talking you will be in a very different

17:52.179 --> 17:54.620
manner as if you are completely detached.

17:54.620 --> 17:58.280
You’ll say “It is going, it is coming."

17:58.280 --> 17:59.280
It happens.

17:59.280 --> 18:04.250
You will not say my mother must get, my father
must get, you will never say like that.

18:04.250 --> 18:11.630
Because you’ll understand that the problem
of Sahaja Yoga is that it cannot give to anyone.

18:11.630 --> 18:12.840
Like

18:12.840 --> 18:20.350
the sunshine can shine it is for the trees
to expose themselves to the sunshine and get

18:20.350 --> 18:22.850
the advantage of it.

18:22.850 --> 18:29.240
The sunshine is not going to run after you
all over to see that you get it.

18:29.240 --> 18:38.030
This is the point here, it will shine the
whole day and you take it.

18:38.030 --> 18:42.890
But it’s not that it will run after you
all the time requesting you, “Oh please

18:42.890 --> 18:47.990
get me, oh please get me, have it, have it,”
like that.

18:47.990 --> 18:57.470
And this is what one has to understand very
clearly, that it is you who has to ask for

18:57.470 --> 19:02.390
it, and not anybody is going to force on you
anything.

19:02.390 --> 19:09.360
On the contrary if anybody tries to say something
more your ego gets like that.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.830
So try to be careful.

19:11.830 --> 19:17.970
I am very happy to know that also, that in
all the ego orientated societies I’ve seen

19:17.970 --> 19:20.470
that Sahaja Yoga works like wonders.

19:20.470 --> 19:23.640
Because first thing they see is their colossal
ego.

19:23.640 --> 19:28.140
And that’s a very positive point about it,
because once you start seeing this horrible

19:28.140 --> 19:34.750
balloon in you, you just start watching yourself
and enjoying, “Oh Mr so and now get along

19:34.750 --> 19:35.750
with your ego."

19:35.750 --> 19:38.610
You see it’s a very interesting life you
start leading.

19:38.610 --> 19:44.990
If your ego you see, is a very good sign.

19:44.990 --> 19:48.250
If you cannot see your ego then there’s
danger.

19:48.250 --> 19:51.809
But some can even see their super ego if they’re
possessed.

19:51.809 --> 19:58.030
See people see how they get possessed suddenly
because the frequency of possession becomes

19:58.030 --> 20:06.360
very little so that there’s a big gaps you
see to see the time when you are normal and

20:06.360 --> 20:11.400
when you get abnormal also you can see clearly
that you are abnormal.

20:11.400 --> 20:18.020
By seeing that you start judging, “Oh God
I have again been caught up, I’m again lost,”

20:18.020 --> 20:19.910
and you come back to normal.

20:19.910 --> 20:29.400
The whole thing becomes a very beautiful understanding
of the reality about yourself and you laugh

20:29.400 --> 20:31.520
at yourself all the time.

20:31.520 --> 20:36.250
All the time you laugh at your self and you
laugh at everything and you find the whole

20:36.250 --> 20:41.650
joke going round how people are seriously
indulging into nonsensical things and how

20:41.650 --> 20:48.060
it’s such a big joke you’ve been yourself
worrying about things which have no meaning,

20:48.060 --> 20:50.150
which has no significance.

20:50.150 --> 20:55.600
Like I went first to Paris and people told
Me, “Mother they are not going to like you

20:55.600 --> 21:01.510
very much, because they believe a person who
is so happy is ignorant.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.950
You should not be a happy person.

21:02.950 --> 21:06.299
You should be a crying baby so they’ll believe
You."

21:06.299 --> 21:11.320
They’re all les miserable, very unhappy
people, extremely unhappy and if you tell

21:11.320 --> 21:16.020
them you are a happy person so they are going
to be shocked at such a thing.

21:16.020 --> 21:20.150
I said, “Really this Les Miserable, let
me (inaudible).

21:20.150 --> 21:25.840
Let Me do something about them and I made
them laugh so much at their miseries that

21:25.840 --> 21:30.179
they got all right and they understood that
the joy is just there.

21:30.179 --> 21:35.670
You have to just peep in your heart and you’ll
find the source of your joy and then the whole

21:35.670 --> 21:37.330
thing vanishes into thin air.

21:37.330 --> 21:40.820
But it has to work, it has to happen.

21:40.820 --> 21:48.890
There is no quick way of doing it in the sense
that I say, “All right you give me five

21:48.890 --> 21:52.480
rupees or five dollars, Australian dollars
and you get it."

21:52.480 --> 21:56.910
NO, no, no, no, you may give Me any amount
it won’t work out.

21:56.910 --> 22:00.370
It has not worked out with My own daughters
you’ll be surprised.

22:00.370 --> 22:02.970
I’ve never forced them or I’ve never asked
them.

22:02.970 --> 22:06.370
I’ve only two daughters they’re not realised
I’m not bothered.

22:06.370 --> 22:09.230
When they’ll ask for it they’ll get it.

22:09.230 --> 22:11.390
But My four grandchildren are born realised.

22:11.390 --> 22:17.090
And one of the eldest ones one day very seriously
said, “As it is you cannot commit mistakes

22:17.090 --> 22:24.830
I know but it would have been nice if you
have given them realisation when they were

22:24.830 --> 22:25.830
children."

22:25.830 --> 22:31.880
You see this is what it is that you cannot
force these things on anyone and you have

22:31.880 --> 22:34.720
to take a very detached view.

22:34.720 --> 22:40.140
You are a seeker, your mother and you are
there but they are not your responsibility,

22:40.140 --> 22:41.950
you can tell them about Sahaja Yog.

22:41.950 --> 22:45.929
But if they are opposing you better have,
let them be alone, they’ll come round.

22:45.929 --> 22:51.000
When they see the transformation in within
you, they’ll definitely come.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.730
So leave them alone.

22:52.730 --> 22:54.870
Don’t bother your heads.

22:54.870 --> 23:01.190
Just leave them alone and you will be amazed
that they will see you transforming so well

23:01.190 --> 23:07.390
and acting so well and they’ll change themselves
and they will come to you and ask you, “How

23:07.390 --> 23:14.820
are you so much changed and transformed?”
You see proof of the pudding is in seeing

23:14.820 --> 23:19.780
the pudding up there changing people.

23:19.780 --> 23:26.740
And this transformation you’ll be amazed
coming into you so suddenly that you will

23:26.740 --> 23:29.310
be amazed.

23:29.310 --> 23:36.440
But as I told you that on the left side is
the desire or you can say the super ego, the

23:36.440 --> 23:38.100
desire to do something.

23:38.100 --> 23:46.390
And the right side is the ego which we try
to sort of please and which feels happy and

23:46.390 --> 23:48.120
the one by which we have ambitions.

23:48.120 --> 23:52.309
But in the centre is the will power to do
this.

23:52.309 --> 23:58.100
And this will power has to be increased by
you, “I have to do it, I have to do it."

23:58.100 --> 23:59.500
First you’ll feel tired because

23:59.500 --> 24:03.190
your left heart is weak, then I will tell
you how to do it.

24:03.190 --> 24:06.610
‘Then know how to raise your left heart
if you’re tired.

24:06.610 --> 24:12.410
See most of the people these days are very
tired people.

24:12.410 --> 24:14.630
They talk, “Ah,” they sit down “Ah."

24:14.630 --> 24:18.940
They can’t, I mean they are very tired,
absolutely fagged out people.

24:18.940 --> 24:21.640
Morning till evening what have you been doing,
nothing.

24:21.640 --> 24:27.640
Just sitting in the sun you got tired, just
lazing out you got tired.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.790
Why, why did you get tired?

24:29.790 --> 24:34.850
Firstly because you’re not integrated you
are fighting with in yourself.

24:34.850 --> 24:39.850
You’re head is fighting your heart, your
heart is fighting your liver.

24:39.850 --> 24:44.010
Secondly, you are thinking and wasting your
energy.

24:44.010 --> 24:52.640
So you have to learn how to settle your heart,
what has to be done to raise your heart to

24:52.640 --> 24:58.120
make it peaceful and how to get the energy
from your spirit.

24:58.120 --> 25:02.560
Once you start doing that your tired feeling
will go away.

25:02.560 --> 25:08.640
Then your aggressiveness also will decrease
and you’ll be amazed that you will just

25:08.640 --> 25:09.919
watch the whole thing.

25:09.919 --> 25:16.590
Neither you’ll aggress nor you’ll take
aggression and the whole reaction will be

25:16.590 --> 25:18.010
very different.

25:18.010 --> 25:23.120
Then everything has a meaning, your feelings
have a meaning.

25:23.120 --> 25:28.780
Supposing you have a feeling today for Poland,
which is in trouble, all of you should ask

25:28.780 --> 25:31.700
just now, “Mother solve the problem of Poland."

25:31.700 --> 25:36.990
Because I have no desires you see, I am desire
less, you have to ask and it works, you’ll

25:36.990 --> 25:41.580
be amazed because your attention is enlightened
now, it just works.

25:41.580 --> 25:44.010
You have to desire for it and it works.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.010
You have to work for it and it works.

25:45.010 --> 25:51.840
And so many miraculous things people will
tell you just believe them that’s all true.

25:51.840 --> 25:59.400
Money problem solved, because of Lakshmi Tattwa
within, financial problems solved, social

25:59.400 --> 26:04.850
problem solved, family problems solved because
you are solved.

26:04.850 --> 26:07.860
See in relation to you all everything seems
problematic.

26:07.860 --> 26:12.179
When your problems are solved everything is
solved.

26:12.179 --> 26:14.620
It’s so simple as that.

26:14.620 --> 26:19.780
We have to solve ourselves and it is solved
through the awakening of the Kundalini.

26:19.780 --> 26:24.900
Now I would like to have some questions from
you and then I would like you to go into groups

26:24.900 --> 26:31.929
with the Sahaja Yogis and talk to them on
intimate level and also you must tell Me your

26:31.929 --> 26:32.929
problems.

26:32.929 --> 26:35.679
If you have any intimate problems, you can
talk to Me also.

26:35.679 --> 26:42.610
But best is to talk to each other.
I would like Warren to see to it that he organises

26:42.610 --> 26:44.549
all these groups properly.

26:44.549 --> 26:58.220
But I would love to have some questions from
you about Sahaja Yoga now.

26:58.220 --> 27:03.310
Question: How can one laugh at abortion.

27:03.310 --> 27:09.760
He's talking about abortion, you are taking
the view that it is bad?

27:09.760 --> 27:17.240
Shri Mataji: I’m not saying you have to,
I said you are not to laugh, means you laugh

27:17.240 --> 27:20.530
at silly stupid things I meant, you see.

27:20.530 --> 27:26.000
But at abortion as I can’t understand you
see.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.340
This is a very funny situation in this country.

27:28.340 --> 27:31.520
As it is the birth rate is minus and you are
having abortions.

27:31.520 --> 27:35.120
Question: Does it exist in India much abortion

27:35.120 --> 27:38.510
Shri Mataji: Not much, people don’t like
it at all, they hate it.

27:38.510 --> 27:41.650
And you know the trouble is like this.

27:41.650 --> 27:45.650
You people are having no children so we have
to have the load on us.

27:45.650 --> 27:47.900
You see what to do?

27:47.900 --> 27:52.260
Nobody to be born here, they don’t want
to be born here because there is no love in

27:52.260 --> 27:53.950
the heart.

27:53.950 --> 27:58.059
See when the other day when somebody told
Me about the doctors here some of them are

27:58.059 --> 28:00.710
butchers I couldn’t believe it.

28:00.710 --> 28:03.980
Because in India at least, doctors are not
butchers by any chance.

28:03.980 --> 28:08.730
I was surprised; this is because everything
has become a butchery here, because the heart

28:08.730 --> 28:10.760
is covered with ego.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.330
There’s no heart left.

28:13.330 --> 28:14.950
You have to raise the heart.

28:14.950 --> 28:21.130
That’s important, once you raise the heart,
you see you cannot stand all this nonsense,

28:21.130 --> 28:22.130
you know.

28:22.130 --> 28:24.160
Why do you want to have abortion I still can’t
understand?

28:24.160 --> 28:26.900
Question: Does it affect Swadisthan charka?

28:26.900 --> 28:31.210
Shri Mataji: Oh, it affects many chakras,
I mean.

28:31.210 --> 28:37.880
There was someone I knew who always used to
catch on right heart, I must tell you this,

28:37.880 --> 28:40.130
very nice person, always on right heart.

28:40.130 --> 28:47.400
His father was a good man everything was fine,
asked him, “How are you catching on right

28:47.400 --> 28:53.160
heart?” He was not married and when he came
very close to Me then he confessed to Me that,

28:53.160 --> 29:00.610
“I lived with a woman and she was going
to have a baby and she went in for an abortion

29:00.610 --> 29:04.910
and I conceded, and since then

29:04.910 --> 29:09.669
I have been feeling very sad about the whole
thing."

29:09.669 --> 29:16.679
But the whole view about life has to be changed
then only you can avoid these things.

29:16.679 --> 29:19.309
You see it is a symptom of a disease.

29:19.309 --> 29:25.419
It’s not the disease itself, abortion is
not the disease, is a symptom of a disease.

29:25.419 --> 29:32.560
Now what is the disease with in us is, is
that, that we have allowed our sex to be let

29:32.560 --> 29:36.120
loose completely, talking too much about sex
from childhood.

29:36.120 --> 29:39.710
What is the need to give education in sex,
I’ve been failed to understand?

29:39.710 --> 29:45.360
Openly, there’s no need to teach about,
you see, do the animals need any sex education,

29:45.360 --> 29:47.480
they still produce.

29:47.480 --> 29:55.320
Then they told Me, “They tell about sex
only because they think by telling about sex

29:55.320 --> 29:58.179
they can protect people from not going into
sex."

29:58.179 --> 30:02.110
I said, “No, they create too much of curiosity
in children."

30:02.110 --> 30:07.620
For example, in India we never talk about
sex to children, they do not know, they are

30:07.620 --> 30:08.620
so innocent.

30:08.620 --> 30:14.250
Even till the marriage takes place some of
the girls do not know what sex actually is,

30:14.250 --> 30:15.780
how it works out and all.

30:15.780 --> 30:21.370
But they are told this is something filthy
to do and all that and when the girl gets

30:21.370 --> 30:27.210
into puberty it is told and to the boys also,
somehow or other it is a very different society.

30:27.210 --> 30:30.940
This question doesn’t come, it never comes
into the head of the boys and girls.

30:30.940 --> 30:36.690
You see if you keep them pure, like it doesn’t
come in the head of a sister and a brother

30:36.690 --> 30:39.929
even today, thank God.

30:39.929 --> 30:44.440
Many sisters and brothers I should say despite
Freud’s all efforts to spoil your minds,

30:44.440 --> 30:46.900
but still there are brothers and sisters relations
today.

30:46.900 --> 30:53.480
In the same way it doesn’t come into their
heads at all.

30:53.480 --> 30:58.410
And when they get married they are to be told,
this is what it is.

30:58.410 --> 31:03.100
And that’s why they say these koarak and
all these places were built where they could

31:03.100 --> 31:07.650
take young brides and young people to see
that.

31:07.650 --> 31:14.090
This was called as Koomari Kar Temple, means
the married women when they were not virgins

31:14.090 --> 31:21.020
could go there and see those places to understand
what is sex is and they got so exhausted with

31:21.020 --> 31:25.450
this early sex life, I mean you go into all
kinds of tantrums then.

31:25.450 --> 31:28.540
Because you’re so exhausted then you go
into perversions.

31:28.540 --> 31:30.159
The basics are wrong.

31:30.159 --> 31:33.770
We are trying too hard to be sexologists.

31:33.770 --> 31:39.360
There’s no need to be sex points you are
that already.

31:39.360 --> 31:44.679
But you don’t want to be only sex points,
do you?

31:44.679 --> 31:55.321
I don’t know what makes you feel that that
is the end of every, every endeavor, everything

31:55.321 --> 31:56.500
should end up there.

31:56.500 --> 32:01.559
May be that advertisement and all this is
coming to you too much because they think

32:01.559 --> 32:04.150
that by exploiting these things they will
help you.

32:04.150 --> 32:18.580
But it’s such a perverted thing and

32:18.580 --> 32:33.600
Seeker interrupts and asks Shri Mataji about
people in India being given a gift like a

32:33.600 --> 32:35.360
transistor radio for sterilization.

32:35.360 --> 32:38.660
Does it have a purpose?

32:38.660 --> 32:47.830
It has a purpose to a point.....Oh I'm sorry
this has another point....

32:47.830 --> 32:52.610
He is talking about in India where they give
a transistor radio....

32:52.610 --> 33:00.299
Shri Mataji: That’s what they try, this
is also, you see western ideas coming to India.

33:00.299 --> 33:03.720
Oh, they did all sorts just to sterilise them.

33:03.720 --> 33:08.110
Oh! that’s how the lady lost her last election,
last election she has now pulled her ears

33:08.110 --> 33:09.110
for that.

33:09.110 --> 33:13.640
You see, they are all westernised people you
see, they try to try all these tricks in....

33:13.640 --> 33:15.340
People don’t like it you see.

33:15.340 --> 33:28.450
There’s a bridegroom who went for his wedding
and poor thing saw that there was a team of

33:28.450 --> 33:30.169
people standing there for sterilisation.

33:30.169 --> 33:38.270
He jumped out of the bus and he disappeared
forever, nobody knows where he is, disappeared.

33:38.270 --> 33:44.630
‘And they even sterilised people who were
very old and who were not even married you

33:44.630 --> 33:45.630
see.

33:45.630 --> 33:50.040
It’s so funny, so indiscriminate, I think
they were possessed by some bhoots I don’t

33:50.040 --> 33:51.400
know what to call them.

33:51.400 --> 33:59.810
You see population is a problem in India but
what to do now, you should solve the problem.

33:59.810 --> 34:03.650
And there is something working out in a very
funny way, I must tell you.

34:03.650 --> 34:08.950
I went to Colombia, I found lots of these
Norwegians carrying Colombian children with

34:08.950 --> 34:09.950
them.

34:09.950 --> 34:14.409
And they looked so different from Norwegian
children, Norwegian people and these Colombian

34:14.409 --> 34:15.409
children.

34:15.409 --> 34:18.669
I asked them, “Why do you acquire these
children where are you carrying them?

34:18.669 --> 34:23.889
They said “We have adopted them”.
I said, “Why don’t you produce your own?

34:23.889 --> 34:25.710
That would be better, to produce your own."

34:25.710 --> 34:32.540
"No we don’t want to go through the process
of it, it’s better to have ready made."

34:32.540 --> 34:38.960
So the supply has started in having all this
in developing countries to give you ready

34:38.960 --> 34:39.960
made children.

34:39.960 --> 34:45.289
Isn’t if funny, it’s funny things going
on, instant babies.

34:45.289 --> 34:55.869
Question: If a chakra is blocked and you clean
the chakras wouldn’t you being undoing the

34:55.869 --> 35:02.099
karmic cycle that a person has to go through?

35:02.099 --> 35:08.211
Shri Mataji: Very good idea, Because I think
you people...I know the question is this,

35:08.211 --> 35:13.729
that he is saying that if you try to clean
the chakras you will be undoing the karmic

35:13.729 --> 35:20.759
cycle and all that you see this is the typical
things that are being circulated in the west

35:20.759 --> 35:21.779
you see.

35:21.779 --> 35:26.890
That you have your own karmas you see and
we are the gurus so you have to go through

35:26.890 --> 35:30.930
your karmas, you must suffer for your karmas
you see like that is there.

35:30.930 --> 35:37.420
Now, this theory was all right before Christ
came in, not after His coming.

35:37.420 --> 35:39.749
And why are they here then?

35:39.749 --> 35:42.469
Why are we paying them, for what?

35:42.469 --> 35:44.299
You better pickle them out.

35:44.299 --> 35:49.200
They’re worth nothing because they just
take money from you, and we have to go through

35:49.200 --> 35:50.200
our karmas.

35:50.200 --> 35:53.200
They make you dance, jump go into all kinds
of things.

35:53.200 --> 35:56.279
Put spirits in us and say, “You are suffering
your karmas.

35:56.279 --> 36:02.640
Why should we suffer?” At least they should
suffer for our karma’s minimum of minimum.

36:02.640 --> 36:04.769
Now Christ has done that for you.

36:04.769 --> 36:09.170
He has taken all these karmas, your karmas
upon Himself.

36:09.170 --> 36:15.249
He has made way for us, that’s why you have
to pass through Him.

36:15.249 --> 36:22.890
Once you pass through Him, through Agnya chakra,
your karmas are sucked in by Him, that’s

36:22.890 --> 36:24.289
your ego.

36:24.289 --> 36:29.099
It’s the only ego that says you have done
this wrong, and that wrong.

36:29.099 --> 36:33.829
You see an animal doesn’t think that way.

36:33.829 --> 36:37.509
It thinks it’s it own sva bhavah the way
it has to be.

36:37.509 --> 36:42.130
But it’s only the human beings who think
I’ve done this wrong, I’ve done that wrong.

36:42.130 --> 36:45.250
I’ve done this good, that bad because we
have ego.

36:45.250 --> 36:55.190
But when your Kundalini passes through your
Agnya chakra your ego is sucked in, your superego

36:55.190 --> 36:56.190
is sucked in.

36:56.190 --> 37:00.849
Christ has done double job in one shot you
know, it’s great.

37:00.849 --> 37:08.170
That’s why He was crucified, it was to be.

37:08.170 --> 37:15.910
He took all your karmas upon Himself and put
it into hell.

37:15.910 --> 37:22.969
So what ever karmas you have done are all
sucked in.

37:22.969 --> 37:25.210
But the door must open fully.

37:25.210 --> 37:30.529
In the beginning it happens that only a thread
comes up, you see, and the ego is not fully

37:30.529 --> 37:34.640
sucked in so sometimes it still comes up and
all that.

37:34.640 --> 37:39.480
The best weapon to get rid of them is to forgive
others.

37:39.480 --> 37:46.299
Forgiveness is the greatest weapon Christ
has given us, which we have to use, forgive,

37:46.299 --> 37:48.220
forgive and forgive.

37:48.220 --> 37:57.319
That’s a very good way, Lords Prayer is
the solution for your Agnya charka, you’ll

37:57.319 --> 37:58.400
be amazed.

37:58.400 --> 38:03.960
You have to say Lords Prayer after realisation
to open your Agnya.

38:03.960 --> 38:06.170
Then you become thoughtlessly aware.

38:06.170 --> 38:10.630
After realisation again I say, not before
realisation, it has no meaning.

38:10.630 --> 38:14.619
Before realisation what ever you have said
has gone into karmas.

38:14.619 --> 38:21.869
Only after realisation you are baptized and
get an opening here and all your karmas pass

38:21.869 --> 38:25.289
through that.

38:25.289 --> 38:29.469
Also you will find when you get realisation
lot of heat comes out these are the karmas

38:29.469 --> 38:32.890
you see, that are coming out.

38:32.890 --> 38:36.730
Let the heat go out and all karmas are finished.

38:36.730 --> 38:38.430
It’s like that.

38:38.430 --> 38:41.529
This is what is Self-Realisation.

38:41.529 --> 38:51.190
Like an egg is in a egg shell is very different,
but when it becomes a little chick and the

38:51.190 --> 39:01.239
mother breaks the tip of the egg a new bird
comes out with out any karmas or the smell

39:01.239 --> 39:03.489
of the egg.

39:03.489 --> 39:08.710
So clean and nice, every thing converted into
something beautiful.

39:08.710 --> 39:14.930
It’s like that, this is the rebirth.

39:14.930 --> 39:19.950
This is how we become a new personality a
new being.

39:19.950 --> 39:22.993
So to forget about your karmas after your
realisation, all right.

39:22.993 --> 39:25.849
He has said it

39:25.849 --> 39:31.489
that, “He died for your sins."

39:31.489 --> 39:34.440
Didn’t He?

39:34.440 --> 39:37.569
And the wages of sin is fear.

39:37.569 --> 39:42.420
If you still have fear within you of your
karmas, you are still sinning.

39:42.420 --> 39:46.349
There should be no fear about it.

39:46.349 --> 39:52.039
Do not have any guilt, I’ve been telling
you not to have any guilt.

39:52.039 --> 39:55.010
What can you do?

39:55.010 --> 39:56.010
What sins can you commit?

39:56.010 --> 39:59.940
Do not have any fears.

39:59.940 --> 40:05.380
This is very common as I told you the other
day left Vishuddhi, I have to talk about it

40:05.380 --> 40:06.380
quite a lot.

40:06.380 --> 40:11.710
It’s so common, in Australia, in America
and in all the western countries, to feel

40:11.710 --> 40:12.710
guilty.

40:12.710 --> 40:17.200
Everything collapses there and nobody can
rise through the Agnya because it collapses

40:17.200 --> 40:20.420
down here onto left Vishuddhi where you feel
guilty.

40:20.420 --> 40:22.440
What are you feeling guilty about?

40:22.440 --> 40:24.430
And why did Christ come on this earth.

40:24.430 --> 40:26.960
You are just wasting His incarnation by feeling
guilty yourself.

40:26.960 --> 40:31.599
He has taken all your guilt upon Himself.

40:31.599 --> 40:34.869
What do you thing He was?

40:34.869 --> 40:42.589
He was Omkara, he was Pranava, He was the
word, He was that power.

40:42.589 --> 40:52.810
He’s not attached to anything but He can
take away everything that you think is sin,

40:52.810 --> 40:57.799
because He’s sinless, He so pure, immaculate.

40:57.799 --> 41:01.539
All right does that give you some hopes?

41:01.539 --> 41:06.190
Or still you are indulging into your own miseries?

41:06.190 --> 41:10.519
Question: Can You give us some guide about
diet.

41:10.519 --> 41:11.969
Shri Mataji: Diet?

41:11.969 --> 41:12.969
All right.

41:12.969 --> 41:17.349
This diet theory is also coming from some
horrible Brahmins you see.

41:17.349 --> 41:19.539
Don’t listen to them.

41:19.539 --> 41:24.009
They are the greatest rakshasas ever born
on this earth.

41:24.009 --> 41:26.859
Devils, rakshasas are monsters.

41:26.859 --> 41:32.391
They eat like hell, they eat such a lot and
they always tell you, “Don’t do this and

41:32.391 --> 41:36.789
don’t do that."

41:36.789 --> 41:43.440
You can eat anything you like except don’t
eat the meat of animals which are bigger than

41:43.440 --> 41:44.440
you.

41:44.440 --> 41:51.450
I mean other wise you will develop muscles
which will have funny contours and things.

41:51.450 --> 41:58.039
Eat animals which are smaller than you is
the point is.

41:58.039 --> 42:06.589
And if you eat those animals they do not also
have much sense of compassion and all that.

42:06.589 --> 42:11.170
It’s all right they are just like vegetables
sort of things, so it doesn’t matter.

42:11.170 --> 42:15.270
You don’t kill them, they are killed in
the machine and all that, you have to eat

42:15.270 --> 42:17.670
that, and you need it, you have to eat.

42:17.670 --> 42:21.630
But that doesn’t mean that if you are vegetarians
you should become non vegetarians.

42:21.630 --> 42:22.829
It doesn’t mean that.

42:22.829 --> 42:24.369
What ever you eat, you can eat.

42:24.369 --> 42:28.390
Eating is not going to change your spirit.

42:28.390 --> 42:41.049
Spirit doesn’t eat, it does not, makes no
difference to the spirit except that, to your

42:41.049 --> 42:44.839
body which is the lamp.

42:44.839 --> 42:48.959
So if you have to keep the wick all right,
you have to keep the lamp all right and for

42:48.959 --> 42:54.099
that don’t eat anything that is a very big
animal compared to yourself.

42:54.099 --> 42:58.410
Cows meat for example in India they don’t
eat, because, “Have you ever seen Indian

42:58.410 --> 43:00.690
cows they’re very gentle."

43:00.690 --> 43:06.049
And the cows are in the house, just like mother
they start giving milk to the children they

43:06.049 --> 43:07.049
see.

43:07.049 --> 43:10.930
Every day they are taking the milk of the
cows so they develop a feeling, you see.

43:10.930 --> 43:12.719
And that’s why they don’t drink, you see.

43:12.719 --> 43:17.400
But it doesn’t mean that if your Australian
cows are I don’t think are like that.

43:17.400 --> 43:24.279
Because what I’ve seen they look like buffalos
to Me sometimes.

43:24.279 --> 43:30.140
Like My granddaughter, she came to England
and she asked Me, “Mother, Grandmother,

43:30.140 --> 43:34.960
why the buffalos in England are white?”
Yes, so, it’s all right.

43:34.960 --> 43:37.440
But you’ll come down on diet.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.900
It will be different you see, you’ll see
gradually.

43:39.900 --> 43:41.579
But don’t worry about it.

43:41.579 --> 43:45.200
Gradually everything drops out into very little
things.

43:45.200 --> 43:47.070
But you allow yourself to develop.

43:47.070 --> 43:48.070
Question: Eggs?

43:48.070 --> 43:49.070
And things like that?

43:49.070 --> 43:51.190
Shri Mataji: Oh, eggs you better have, lots
of it.

43:51.190 --> 43:53.630
But if you have liver it’s not good to have
eggs.

43:53.630 --> 43:58.490
Eggs is very heating,, pork is otherwise good
but not good for the people who have liver

43:58.490 --> 43:59.490
problem.

43:59.490 --> 44:01.869
See you must understand that every person
is different.

44:01.869 --> 44:04.660
Now today I met a lady who is very left sided.

44:04.660 --> 44:07.019
So I had to tell her, “You eat pork, eggs
everything.

44:07.019 --> 44:09.529
You see it is how you are.

44:09.529 --> 44:11.119
Even the Indian Ayurveda is like that.

44:11.119 --> 44:16.359
They want to know the prakruti, the character
of a person how he is.

44:16.359 --> 44:19.459
We have evolved from different types of animals.

44:19.459 --> 44:21.200
I saw the nocturnal ones.

44:21.200 --> 44:26.640
You see the nocturnal ones must eat a lot
of meats, those who have evolved from nocturnal

44:26.640 --> 44:27.640
side, you see.

44:27.640 --> 44:33.289
Left-sided, the ones who are afraid and frightened
and who are not egoistical at all you see.

44:33.289 --> 44:38.450
Such types they should take more meats and
things but those who are too much aggressive

44:38.450 --> 44:40.799
better take to vegetables, is better.

44:40.799 --> 44:46.630
All right now, what’s the question?

44:46.630 --> 44:56.750
Question: Does forgiveness stop the rich getting
richer and the poor getting poorer?

44:56.750 --> 44:58.759
Shri Mataji: It does absolutely, absolutely.

44:58.759 --> 45:03.480
Sahaja Yoga is the thing that balances the
society.

45:03.480 --> 45:10.969
Those who are poor become richer and the rich
understand that they must share.

45:10.969 --> 45:16.890
Willingly they start sharing their money.

45:16.890 --> 45:20.940
But you become really rich in a very miraculous
manner.

45:20.940 --> 45:25.549
Now there’s a girl here and I would like
her to tell you what happened to her, it’s

45:25.549 --> 45:26.549
miraculous.

45:26.549 --> 45:29.829
But she’s an Australian and she doesn’t
tell lies you can see that very clearly and

45:29.829 --> 45:33.329
she’ll tell you what happened to her.

45:33.329 --> 45:38.779
Where is she gone?

45:38.779 --> 45:42.430
Sharon come along..is she here?

45:42.430 --> 45:51.200
No let her tell, is better, she’s Australian
they’ll believe her more.

45:51.200 --> 45:57.049
But never trust an Indian that’s even worse.

45:57.049 --> 46:04.059
You know some of the gurus have introduced
some Indian bhoots, Indian spirits into English

46:04.059 --> 46:10.160
people, and Americans and also European and
I find they behave just like Indians.

46:10.160 --> 46:14.260
They’ll cheat, they embezzle, they’ll
take away things, not the women, they’ll

46:14.260 --> 46:16.089
not touch the women you see.

46:16.089 --> 46:22.509
But they’ll touch the things they take away
the empty cans, is typical Indian you see.

46:22.509 --> 46:23.999
It’s rather

46:23.999 --> 46:29.569
surprising, yes there are some, I’ve seen
them like that.

46:29.569 --> 46:35.119
It’s surprising to see such things happening
to a western person who behaves just like

46:35.119 --> 46:41.289
an Indian must be some possession of bhoots
put by these gurus.

46:41.289 --> 46:48.329
So if you believe Me then I can tell you what
she’s told, it’s really miraculous, very

46:48.329 --> 46:50.089
miraculous, you see.

46:50.089 --> 46:56.190
Cheryl was telling Me that she wanted to come
to India and she had no money.

46:56.190 --> 47:06.789
So her daughter was very anxious to come to
India and they didn’t know what to do, they

47:06.789 --> 47:07.789
didn’t have sufficient money.

47:07.789 --> 47:15.789
So they just said, “Mother we want to come
to India can you arrange it for us, that’s

47:15.789 --> 47:16.789
all."

47:16.789 --> 47:20.930
And it so happened that this girl had taken
a trinket she had in the house, a bracelet

47:20.930 --> 47:24.670
to the school for a sale, whenever they have
the fetes all over.

47:24.670 --> 47:29.299
So she took that for the fete and the teacher
said, “I think this is gold."

47:29.299 --> 47:32.059
She couldn’t believe it.

47:32.059 --> 47:36.809
She brought it home and they got it valued
and they found that the price of the thing

47:36.809 --> 47:41.209
was equal to what they had to spend for both
of them travels.

47:41.209 --> 47:43.059
But this is nothing.

47:43.059 --> 47:46.569
And then she got some money from somewhere
in the house, somewhere I don’t know how

47:46.569 --> 47:49.539
she got some money and she didn’t sell even
the bracelet.

47:49.539 --> 47:51.700
And that’s still there she said, “For
the next trip."

47:51.700 --> 47:54.460
I said, “I hope so, you sell it."

47:54.460 --> 47:55.460
“May not."

47:55.460 --> 48:02.450
Like that you see, things work out, because
your Laxshmi Tattawa, your centre of well

48:02.450 --> 48:05.430
being gets enlightened and then you are looked
after.

48:05.430 --> 48:07.150
So many things happen.

48:07.150 --> 48:14.029
Like today they told Me so many things of
this kind happening to them and I too.

48:14.029 --> 48:19.499
You see when these people came in, I had told
them all right, you give Me so much money

48:19.499 --> 48:21.900
may be required for your stay there.

48:21.900 --> 48:27.289
Very little it was, very little for them to
be there in India after all, you see India

48:27.289 --> 48:30.109
is also now becoming very expensive.

48:30.109 --> 48:34.009
And when I went to India I had discovered
it had become very expensive, doesn’t matter

48:34.009 --> 48:35.289
I said, “I’ll put it in the bank.

48:35.289 --> 48:36.709
“Let it be there."

48:36.709 --> 48:42.910
And anybody ask Me, “Have it, you want it,
have it, now spend go,” and it was all right.

48:42.910 --> 48:48.459
I could manage, see that’s what he did,
and so many of them have done it.

48:48.459 --> 48:49.759
It’s looked after.

48:49.759 --> 48:55.710
You go to right places, you get right things,
don’t spend too much, you do not repent

48:55.710 --> 49:01.519
for spending and you feel happy for whatever
you have.

49:01.519 --> 49:06.339
You feel very joyous, not worried about counting
but if you make a budget you had it.

49:06.339 --> 49:13.190
You don’t worry your head about budgeting,
how much your going to spend, you’ll be

49:13.190 --> 49:14.190
surprised.

49:14.190 --> 49:16.170
You won’t go to things which are unnecessary,
useless but you’ll buy something that is

49:16.170 --> 49:23.410
very good and ultimately these things will
be very precious for you to sell.

49:23.410 --> 49:26.519
Many things have happened like that.

49:26.519 --> 49:30.769
Many things have happened.

49:30.769 --> 49:34.930
Question: Why is Australia important for the
future?

49:34.930 --> 49:37.160
Maybe about Shri Ganesha?

49:37.160 --> 49:42.459
Shri Mataji: Only thing I don’t want to
pamper the ego.

49:42.459 --> 49:46.400
Question: Is Australia blessed?

49:46.400 --> 49:49.660
Shri Mataji: Very much, very much blessed.

49:49.660 --> 49:58.809
It’s a very much blessed place, specially
created.

49:58.809 --> 50:08.309
Australia was the first continent to be created
and if I dare to answer this question, I hope

50:08.309 --> 50:13.849
you’ll believe Me and not get into ego trips.

50:13.849 --> 50:28.309
Australia is a place which is described in
the ancient Puranas that a great saint was

50:28.309 --> 50:36.130
sent to Australia and another heaven was created.

50:36.130 --> 50:46.029
And that saint is called as Thrishanku which
is your Southern Cross...what do you call

50:46.029 --> 50:47.959
that?

50:47.959 --> 50:52.119
That shows the Southern Cross and you can
only see Southern Cross from Australia.

50:52.119 --> 51:03.150
This is one of the Puranas, the Vedas have
also mentioned this and even before that Australia

51:03.150 --> 51:05.069
is the place which has the Ganesha.

51:05.069 --> 51:13.450
The first is the Mooladhara Chakra, the first
centre is in Australia.

51:13.450 --> 51:17.549
How much wise you should be.

51:17.549 --> 51:23.410
Did you hear Me?

51:23.410 --> 51:32.009
Question: She wanted your opinion about the
Australian aboriginals.

51:32.009 --> 51:39.599
Shri Mataji: Oh, they must have been good
people to begin with, I am sure of it.

51:39.599 --> 51:48.500
They must have been very good and holy people
and nice people but I think later on they

51:48.500 --> 51:56.999
deviated because of too much jungles and things
you know, they started feeling the fear of

51:56.999 --> 51:58.359
the nature too much.

51:58.359 --> 52:06.380
They must have worshiped things, which were
good to begin with and later on to some things

52:06.380 --> 52:09.160
like spirits and this.

52:09.160 --> 52:15.400
More over the dead bodies the way they disposed
of must have been something wrong.

52:15.400 --> 52:24.680
So maybe they might have gone into a left
sided action into primitive ways of exciting

52:24.680 --> 52:25.680
these bhoots

52:25.680 --> 52:29.390
and things, spirits and spiritualism and all
that.

52:29.390 --> 52:33.710
But in Australia must be the minimum, in Africa
is horrible.

52:33.710 --> 52:39.489
African countries have too much of it but
it should be the minimum of minimum because

52:39.489 --> 52:45.279
you see, Ganesha’s chakra is connected with
the left side, you see is more on the left

52:45.279 --> 52:46.779
side isn’t it?

52:46.779 --> 52:54.589
So also one can go drift more on to the left
side that is what it is.

52:54.589 --> 53:01.069
And even today I feel there’s kind of a
lurking inferiority complex that works in

53:01.069 --> 53:02.069
Australians.

53:02.069 --> 53:06.589
They try to copy the west, there’s nothing
to copy there, they’ve nothing sensible.

53:06.589 --> 53:08.779
They have to learn from you.

53:08.779 --> 53:12.769
You see this is a little inferiority complex
we have that all the best things are in the

53:12.769 --> 53:13.769
west.

53:13.769 --> 53:18.299
That’s wrong, you are much better of in
so many ways.

53:18.299 --> 53:20.950
At least you’ve not lost your moorings.

53:20.950 --> 53:27.690
So I would not pass a general remark about
a community as such but there is a possibility

53:27.690 --> 53:29.450
that they can come up very well too.

53:29.450 --> 53:31.930
I mean they can get out of all that left-sidedness.

53:31.930 --> 53:40.160
In India also we have big communities in the
south where people have lived with too much

53:40.160 --> 53:46.769
ritualism and all that and have taken to left-sided
behaviour of attracting you know spirits and

53:46.769 --> 53:49.249
this and that, and giving those [telesmart?]
and all that.

53:49.249 --> 53:54.529
They have done all that they are doing, like
witchcraft, witch doctors and all that.

53:54.529 --> 53:59.440
They must be doing it, but it can be cured
there’s no problem.

53:59.440 --> 54:05.220
As the west, people are over developed and
very ego orientated and right side.

54:05.220 --> 54:08.699
Both are extreme cases, but you can be correct.

54:08.699 --> 54:14.359
The people who are left side it’s easier
because they have to move forward but it’s

54:14.359 --> 54:16.940
difficult for ego orientated to move backwards.

54:16.940 --> 54:20.809
But if we can do that there why not here,
so nothing is lost.

54:20.809 --> 54:24.690
One should not worry too much about these
things.

54:24.690 --> 54:29.109
Human begins are just the same everybody has
Kundalini, finished.

54:29.109 --> 54:39.209
As long as you have Kundalini I have no problem.

54:39.209 --> 54:43.549
Question: Is there anything wrong with eating
chilies?

54:43.549 --> 54:47.309
Shri Mataji: No, it suits some people very
much.

54:47.309 --> 54:51.920
Some people should have, those who suffer
from colds will be a good idea, suffer from

54:51.920 --> 54:53.809
constipation is a good idea.

54:53.809 --> 54:55.940
But don’t eat too much of anything.

54:55.940 --> 55:01.099
But it’s good for some people, something
is good for some people, something is good

55:01.099 --> 55:02.779
for some people, you have to just find out.

55:02.779 --> 55:07.229
For people who get constipated it is better
to have a little of green chilies all the

55:07.229 --> 55:10.280
time, it is very rich in vitamin C.

55:10.280 --> 55:21.130
It is very rich in vitamin C is good for people
who catch colds very easily.

55:21.130 --> 55:27.779
Question: Do you know anything about the teaching
called Mahikari

55:27.779 --> 55:30.719
Shri Mataji: I know.

55:30.719 --> 55:40.390
You see Mahikari thing was, the person who
started Mahikari was a realised soul, though

55:40.390 --> 55:42.210
not so well equipped.

55:42.210 --> 55:50.209
I’ve met him before his realisation and
he got realisation I think through Me only,

55:50.209 --> 55:51.259
what ever it was.

55:51.259 --> 55:54.119
I do not want to claim anything like that.

55:54.119 --> 55:56.200
But only thing is he was not equipped, well
equipped.

55:56.200 --> 55:59.329
Like anybody here who gets realisation starts
doing something.

55:59.329 --> 56:03.809
And his daughter I think, mislead the people
because she’s not a realised soul.

56:03.809 --> 56:09.029
She became very money-orientated, she started
putting it, it’s happened with every one

56:09.029 --> 56:10.029
of them.

56:10.029 --> 56:15.890
But poor thing, this one was not, he just
got realisation he was not an incarnation

56:15.890 --> 56:17.890
also, you see.

56:17.890 --> 56:26.579
Even incarnations who came on this earth like
Christ you see, like Mohammad Sahab, like

56:26.579 --> 56:31.939
Rama, Krishna see such great incarnations
were purest of pure.

56:31.939 --> 56:38.749
Even those people have been mishandled and
people have raised organisations, which are

56:38.749 --> 56:41.199
just money making propositions.

56:41.199 --> 56:42.859
Everything some how man makes into money.

56:42.859 --> 56:47.939
I don’t know how, it’s something that
happens to human beings you see.

56:47.939 --> 56:53.349
Then they start giving [Telesmart?] then they
start giving this, that, cross, this I mean

56:53.349 --> 56:55.529
it’s a money-making proposition through
out.

56:55.529 --> 56:59.559
You see this is the trouble.

56:59.559 --> 57:04.720
Warren: She said you are right.

57:04.720 --> 57:12.499
Shri Mataji: And you may lose lots of your
powers, even ordinary, normal powers with

57:12.499 --> 57:22.029
this kind of a wrong attitude you see, or
misguidance, because it happens like that,

57:22.029 --> 57:24.630
you can make mistakes, you can do so many
things.

57:24.630 --> 57:32.380
You know I’ve seen people, one girl whom
I had given realisation she went to a lady

57:32.380 --> 57:33.769
who was a medium.

57:33.769 --> 57:37.019
She used to get “Ho, ho, ho, ho,” like
that, and this thing.

57:37.019 --> 57:38.019
And she

57:38.019 --> 57:41.499
gave her a talisman and she became actually
blind, actually blind.

57:41.499 --> 57:47.690
Now she’s blind, her eyes are open, I mean
I have to still cure her.

57:47.690 --> 57:51.439
This is the report I got about her.

57:51.439 --> 57:55.758
Question: Would you say the same of the Hari
Krishna Organisation?

57:55.758 --> 57:57.589
Shri Mataji: Oh, now you are pulling Me into
controversy.

57:57.589 --> 58:01.839
But I will tell you the other way round.

58:01.839 --> 58:07.749
You see if you go on calling say the name
of anybody, even your name would you like

58:07.749 --> 58:08.749
it?

58:08.749 --> 58:11.119
So then how can God like it?

58:11.119 --> 58:19.039
On the Oxford Street you stand up, you should
see the site, they even sell those things

58:19.039 --> 58:23.769
see like wigs, they sell them like wigs in
the market.

58:23.769 --> 58:27.739
They shave off and sometimes they wear wigs.

58:27.739 --> 58:33.170
See it’s not show, it is something that
has to happen within.

58:33.170 --> 58:38.599
It’s not the show that you put up is something
that has to happen.

58:38.599 --> 58:45.479
You see most of them end up with throat cancer
and very violent, very violent people.

58:45.479 --> 58:49.910
They are beggars’ absolute parasites.

58:49.910 --> 58:53.329
Warren: with expensive cars.

58:53.329 --> 58:59.999
Shri Mataji: You see this is very nice,
I met somebody in England and I told him,

58:59.999 --> 59:02.469
“What do you do here?” He said, “I deal
in opium."

59:02.469 --> 59:06.780
I got a fright.
I said, “Opium, how do you deal in opium?”

59:06.780 --> 59:10.369
“Other people’s money,”
I said, “That’s very good, other people’s

59:10.369 --> 59:11.369
money."

59:11.369 --> 59:12.519
You see you can float an enterprise.

59:12.519 --> 59:19.589
It’s very easy because you are such seekers
such great seekers of ages and you are so

59:19.589 --> 59:21.279
naïve, very good.

59:21.279 --> 59:28.819
You go anywhere they’ll take a square, sit
there with saffron cloths with some circles

59:28.819 --> 59:30.939
on, another fellow will be fanning.

59:30.939 --> 59:35.719
Oh this one is very great, coming direct from
Kashi.

59:35.719 --> 59:37.809
Then have nothing to do with horrible people.

59:37.809 --> 59:42.609
Kashi is one of the worst places now.

59:42.609 --> 59:46.999
So you all go and prostrate.

59:46.999 --> 59:48.319
This is what it is.

59:48.319 --> 59:53.650
I mean, why are you enamoured by these circuses,
aren’t you fed up with them?

59:53.650 --> 59:59.650
We had a lady from Norway, this one was very
interesting.

59:59.650 --> 01:00:04.190
She came to My house stayed with Me, very
badly caught up, and she told Me the story

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.789
of a lama who came to Norway.

01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:10.640
First he told all these Norwegians, “You
see, if I have to come to Norway you have

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:14.459
to make a place with the floor which has got
all marble."

01:00:14.459 --> 01:00:15.619
Look at that.

01:00:15.619 --> 01:00:17.949
They’re such parasites these Lamas are.

01:00:17.949 --> 01:00:23.390
First they have sucked the blood of these
poor Tibetans and now they were willing to

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:24.670
suck the blood of these Norwegians.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:29.640
Now these poor young people you see, I should
say the young people in the west are really

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:34.709
not rich because they’re parents do not
give them money the way we give our children

01:00:34.709 --> 01:00:35.709
you see.

01:00:35.709 --> 01:00:41.680
So they starve themselves, they ate only potatoes
and this and that and for one year they starved

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:46.279
themselves to create this floor for these
horrible people.

01:00:46.279 --> 01:00:49.640
And this fellow came you see, with his shaved
head and all that.

01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:57.819
He stayed there and this lady told Me that
she had to go and just bow to him one thousand

01:00:57.819 --> 01:00:59.380
times for three months.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.539
One thousand times.

01:01:00.539 --> 01:01:06.109
Imagine, just to go, as it is he’ll be finished,
even three times is sufficient to finish you

01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:07.759
off.

01:01:07.759 --> 01:01:09.599
And three months she did it.

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:13.920
And with Me she was arguing morning till evening.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.269
I said, “Look at that, her arguing with
Me, eating My head off and here your bowing

01:01:19.269 --> 01:01:20.269
to him."

01:01:20.269 --> 01:01:24.670
They would not allow anybody to go near the
lama, the great was sitting on the seventh

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:27.799
step somewhere hanging in the air.

01:01:27.799 --> 01:01:37.109
Is very common you know, the more you are
missing from the scene the more you are difficult

01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:38.969
to be seen you see.

01:01:38.969 --> 01:01:42.130
Is something great, “Oh, ho! I’ve seen
the glimpse of that

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:45.119
horrible thing,” that’s what people think.

01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:50.680
You see this is what they play upon you emotional,
what you call it emotional blackmail.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.839
That’s what it is.

01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:57.660
They will tell you first of all they’re,
we call them chumchars, we call them spoons.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.369
They’ll come and tell you, “Oh this is
very difficult, you know.

01:02:00.369 --> 01:02:09.619
He may not give you any interview, and you
have to at least you should shell out five

01:02:09.619 --> 01:02:14.529
hundred rupees, see it is not easy, it’s
very difficult.

01:02:14.529 --> 01:02:21.529
Only you should send your photograph with
five hundred,” all this nonsense.

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:27.930
If you are the river Ganges, what can malign
you, what can dirty you, what can make you

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:29.049
impure?

01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:33.420
If you are here for purification then nothing
can impure you.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:41.449
One two three four, now the one who has not
asked at all should ask

01:02:41.449 --> 01:02:43.679
Question: Over the years it seems we have
lost our power to believe in our self that

01:02:43.679 --> 01:03:10.000
we had in Egyptian times the power to believe
in ourselves but we went wrong..

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:18.529
Warren: the question is the loss of power
within ourselves, perhaps back in the days

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:25.160
of Egypt we had these powers, we seem to have
lost our power to believe in ourself.

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:30.750
Shri Mataji: I don’t know even if at that
time you had those powers very much.

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:36.859
But Egyptians indulged more on the ego side
you see, those who were rulers.

01:03:36.859 --> 01:03:42.390
And the slaves were on the left hand side
too much because they obeyed the rulers you

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:43.390
see.

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:47.660
So the sensitivity came to them from spirits,
not directly from themselves.

01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:54.259
And some of them were really, very realised
souls and you’ll be amazed if these extreme

01:03:54.259 --> 01:03:58.380
cases are there they understand an incarnation
better.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:05.999
Say if you are taking LSD too much, you will
see only lights coming out of Me, you won’t

01:04:05.999 --> 01:04:06.999
see Me.

01:04:06.999 --> 01:04:11.559
There are many who must have seen that, auras
and things, if you are on the right hand side

01:04:11.559 --> 01:04:12.650
too much.

01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:17.059
If you are on the left had side you’ll be
awed, you’ll be shaking before Me and you

01:04:17.059 --> 01:04:21.880
may see My previous births and you’ll be
quite frightened because you’ll know what

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:22.880
it is.

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:29.339
So they understood the incarnations better,
but evolutionary you are much higher than

01:04:29.339 --> 01:04:30.619
they are.

01:04:30.619 --> 01:04:38.749
Though there’s confusion because of so called
freedom you had which you misused.

01:04:38.749 --> 01:04:45.249
But as a whole I think this is the time for
blossom.

01:04:45.249 --> 01:04:52.140
Only thing you must know that you’re a seeker
and you are a seeker then you must get it

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:56.529
and if you get it why should you be surprised.

01:04:56.529 --> 01:05:01.650
But it’s like a seeking has become like
a fashion, seeking here, seeking there seeking

01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:03.479
there, seeking you stop no where you see.

01:05:03.479 --> 01:05:08.079
You see you go on fixing the bolts you see,
you’re just going with an inertia, even

01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:10.549
if you stop fixing you still go on like that.

01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:16.319
It’s like that, you see, it’s a style
you have developed going from this to that,

01:05:16.319 --> 01:05:21.309
that to that, that to that and you cannot
stop it.

01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:42.180
Question: I’d be interested in Your opinion
of philosophy for Rudolf Steiner and secondly

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:53.079
you concept of Papa tax sungar in India.

01:05:53.079 --> 01:05:58.920
All these are all people playing on bhoots
and things, that’s all I can say.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:07.109
(Shri Mother asks the seeker what does Steiner
say and he says million words.)

01:06:07.109 --> 01:06:14.890
Word, words, words and words, what does he
say?

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:29.369
This Steiner his vibrations are very good,
Might be a realised soul but what does he

01:06:29.369 --> 01:06:31.349
say?

01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:51.140
Seekers tries to tell Shri Mataji what he
writes about.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:58.650
He might be a realised soul like Khalil Gibran
is, you see his vibrations are good.

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:02.920
He might be, but still you have to become
realised souls you see.

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.349
Reading that even Zen is all that.

01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:08.799
Zen is everything is, nothing but his realisation.

01:07:08.799 --> 01:07:14.549
But you’ll be amazed that the head of Zen
himself reads all Zen without being realised,

01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:16.959
and he’s a hopeless fellow.

01:07:16.959 --> 01:07:19.489
I just talked to him and he said, “Oh, he
cannot get realisation."

01:07:19.489 --> 01:07:20.520
He’s confirmed on that point.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:26.490
Imagine the head of the Zen saying that, and
he said we had kashapas only twenty six kashapas

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:29.750
we had in six centuries can you believe it.

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:33.910
And he wouldn’t take his realisation and
he was so frightened.

01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:37.189
He accepted Me all right but he said, “I
am nowhere, Mother, compared to You."

01:07:37.189 --> 01:07:38.189
“What is this?

01:07:38.189 --> 01:07:39.739
But I am telling you can get."

01:07:39.739 --> 01:07:41.420
Warren: Steiner catches on Agnya and swadisthan.

01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:46.089
Shri Mataji: So it’s good to read somebody
who is a realised soul, but you better get

01:07:46.089 --> 01:07:47.089
it yourself.

01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:50.640
You become Steiner, all right.

01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:55.569
What I’m saying, you become a realised soul.

01:07:55.569 --> 01:08:01.039
And you can write about your own experiences.

01:08:01.039 --> 01:08:04.150
Yes, please.

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:13.009
Question: Seeker asks about opinion of Dadaji.

01:08:13.009 --> 01:08:15.910
Shri Mataji: Dadaji, he’s arrested.

01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:17.660
Warren: In Calcutta

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:21.150
Shri Mataji: He’s already in jail.

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:26.410
No, he was in Pune where he was arrested,
this Dadaji.

01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:30.270
This happened about I think, I don’t know,
but I heard about it.

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:33.150
I don’t know when it happened.

01:08:33.150 --> 01:08:38.490
No it was not because of any political thing.

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:44.260
But they found some income tax things and
all that and lots of, I don’t know, I didn’t

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:48.050
pay much attention but he’s arrested that
I know.

01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:58.470
There are these sorts of things but the best
part of the thing is that all that is untruth

01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:00.900
is exposed, gradually.

01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:05.190
Whatever things they may put out, whatever
story they may put out, whatever they may

01:09:05.190 --> 01:09:09.620
try, they may entice you, you may be interested
in them whatever it is.

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.740
But they themselves meet their end.

01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:20.500
Because all that is falsehood has an end and
truth is endless, it is anand, it is eternal.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.100
The truth is eternal.

01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:29.850
Question: What do you see as the future of
the United Nations?

01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:32.299
Shri Mataji: That’s a tricky question.

01:09:32.299 --> 01:09:35.190
My husband is one of the secretary generals.

01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:38.200
I better not speak all right.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.900
Let it be.

01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:46.400
We’ll see about it, work it out.

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.560
Some tricks we have to play.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.760
Question: Do you know of Krishnamurti?

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:58.980
Shri Mataji: Oh, very much, he’s another
one.

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.240
Krishnamurti is another blah, blah, blah.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.650
I’ll tell you about Krishnamurti very well.

01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:07.330
You see what Krishnamurti does?

01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:12.650
He says this part what I say that “There
are false gurus."

01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:15.980
But I don’t say there are not real ones.

01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.560
If there is falsehood, if there’s artificiality,
there has to be real.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:23.820
If there are artificial flowers there has
to be a real flower, too.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:29.001
So he negates you from the other side completely
and he puts up your ego by saying, “Oh you

01:10:29.001 --> 01:10:30.090
can find it,” so you are finished.

01:10:30.090 --> 01:10:34.400
He’s a blind leading others into blindness.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:45.360
(Delete-Yogi relates story of a seeker about
his meeting with Krishnamurti to Shri Mataji.

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:55.370
He saw him personally asks him “why do you
do what you do” and Krishnamurti said, “Does

01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:57.070
a rose ask why?”)

01:10:57.070 --> 01:11:03.110
Shri Mataji: I mean it has no awareness, simple
answer is as that.

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:05.670
A rose has no awareness.

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:09.260
By any chance he’s not a rose.

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.340
he’s just thorns that’s what I know.

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.671
Those who have come from him have had a very
bad time I must tell you.

01:11:14.671 --> 01:11:18.560
You see they are really so depressed and so
horrid.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.949
We had one architect; I mean his life was
finished.

01:11:21.949 --> 01:11:27.570
So many of them I’ve met, horrible they’re
very argumentative.

01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:32.340
The best example I’ll give you about this
because you’ve brought forth.

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:45.550
There was a fellow who came to see Me, he’s
the grandson of his guru.

01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:54.430
His guru was Yogananda, Yogananda, the Kriya
yogis, you see.

01:11:54.430 --> 01:12:04.410
He was the grandson of the Dadaji or something,
Babaji, called Dadaji then Babaji

01:12:04.410 --> 01:12:06.070
are there.

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:14.220
This Babaji, his grandson, you see, his Yogananda’s
guru was somebody else, and he was the son

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:20.640
of this fellow, but I mean the grandson of
his guru, so the great grandson of Babaji.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:27.260
So the whole family was Kriya and he did all
the Kriya Yoga and everything he did.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.430
He went there and he got so frightened.

01:12:30.430 --> 01:12:37.030
One day he happened to see this Krishnamurti
that there should be no he said, “No Kriya

01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:42.100
and all that, you see, that you are your own
guru,” and this and that."

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:46.240
So he said, “Oh God, what have I been doing?”
So he gave up Kriya Yoga and came to Mr.

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.960
Krishnamurti.
He said, “I became such an expert that I

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.610
spoke better than Krishnamurti did."

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:55.540
And everybody was surprised and said, “Second
Krishnamurti is coming and I ran away for

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.540
there.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:00.540
I said, “Now this is that thing is happening
to Me.

01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:04.710
And he came to Me, you’ll be amazed I’ve
not been able to give him realisation till

01:13:04.710 --> 01:13:05.710
today.

01:13:05.710 --> 01:13:08.220
I must tell you this, he comes to Me still
often.

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:09.870
Often, very often he comes to Me.

01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:11.850
I’ve not yet given him realisation.

01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:16.450
Imagine the grandson of this Babaji has to
bear I don’t know what things, poor things

01:13:16.450 --> 01:13:22.030
has been done to him, I ‘m very sorry for
him.

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:25.470
Question: Do you know Rajneesh?

01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:29.590
Shri Mataji: He’s another horrible one.

01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:37.230
Why do you need a guru for such a thing?

01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:40.380
You are masters, he’s a fool, he doesn’t
know compared to what you know.

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:46.480
But you see what you thought of, that inside
you are human beings, you feel guilty that

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:49.520
you talk of sex with animals, sex with this,
this, that.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:54.540
If there’s something lurking in you, there’s
something wrong in all this perversion and

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:56.190
homosexuality this that and all that.

01:13:56.190 --> 01:14:00.570
So you thought it better to have a guru at
least he’ll certify.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:05.230
But he is going to make you take two running
jumps to go to hell, I tell you.

01:14:05.230 --> 01:14:10.980
And he talks, just there and he talks, “That
you’ll go to bottomless pit,” in the bible

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:12.490
a bottomless pit is the hell.

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.940
You see he’s very honest in a way, he says
so.

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:19.230
He said, “You’ll go to bottomless pit."

01:14:19.230 --> 01:14:24.010
He has criticised Christ to such an extent
that he said that Christ had bad relations

01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:25.450
with his own Mother.

01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:30.870
Oh to that extent, he said about Mohammad
having bad relation with his daughter.

01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:35.650
All sorts of things he is talking and you
know people publish it.

01:14:35.650 --> 01:14:37.490
He’s getting such a publicity.

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:43.860
He pays money to people that they write against
Me and doing all kinds of things.

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:49.300
Indians don’t like him at all, at all, they
hate him, they want him to get out but he’s

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:52.040
so localised he cannot smell a flower and
he calls himself Bhagavan, means God.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:15:01.340
In the book you see, anywhere you read, any
Indian book where they have described God,

01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:06.940
the names of God, they’re thousand names
supposing, of Vishnu or of the Goddess, anything.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:11.120
At least fifteen or twenty of them are that
they are fond of flowers, they’re fond of

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.480
fragrance, they’re fragrant.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:17.910
That they’re fond of Kamalas, Champas they’re
fond this that all is there and this fellow

01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:22.900
cannot see, if you show a flower to him he’ll
run away.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:29.340
He cannot bear to have any incense being burnt
anywhere.

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:33.510
When you go there you they see and you can
only put phenyl to go and see him.

01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:36.440
I think he’s a bathroom cleaner, that’s
what he is.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.470
The way he’s so much afraid.

01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:44.400
I don’t know what he likes the bathroom
smell.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:48.820
And he does all dirty things, very dirty fellow,
is filthy I don’t want to tell you what

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:54.650
he does but I know what he does.

01:15:54.650 --> 01:16:05.440
Question: Could you explain the meaning of
satoori and samadhi.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.490
Shri Mataji:That’s Zen.

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:17.850
You see Zen satoori is the same as samadhi
but it’s a, you see the Zen were as I told

01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:24.210
you in six centuries were twenty-six and whatever
they wrote people never understood you see.

01:16:24.210 --> 01:16:29.160
Because they were realised souls, some of
them were born realised, some got realisation.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.880
Now even when you will talk people won’t
understand you, it’s a very surprise thing.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.750
But it happens like that because your language
changes.

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:40.690
Now they call it satoori is a samadhi but

01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:48.190
it’s not so clearly given, they could not
explain so clearly about it not properly to

01:16:48.190 --> 01:16:51.460
people, it’s not so clear cut.

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:57.610
Now in our Sahaja Yoga we have first of all
Nirvichara samadhi.

01:16:57.610 --> 01:17:02.050
Samadhi, dhi means awareness, and samadhi
means enlightened awareness.

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:03.720
Nirvichara means thoughtless.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.970
Thoughtless enlightened awareness is first
thing, is clear.

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:12.690
Sahaja Yoga is very clear cut practical, every
word of it.

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:16.060
You see it so clearly there’s no vagueness
about it.

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:20.410
Even you’ll understand Bible better, Zen
better, everything better if you know Sahaja

01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:23.960
Yoga because your eyes are open to it, all
right.

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:27.590
So the first thing is Nirvichara Samadhi.

01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:36.300
With Nirvichara Samadhi when it crosses your
Agnya chakra you get Nirvichara, means when

01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:37.960
your ego is pulled down.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.530
With that you get powers.

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:42.940
Like you see if you become a deputy governor
you get powers if you become a governor you

01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:43.940
get powers.

01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:47.250
The first powers you get is curative powers.

01:17:47.250 --> 01:17:50.770
You get cured and you can cure others.

01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:55.260
Many people whom I have cured are not Sahaja
yogis they’re useless people actually.

01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:59.400
I’ve given up curing people for the same
reason because they just come for cures they

01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.400
get cured and lost.

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:03.490
What’s the use of curing people who are
not going to give the light?

01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:07.720
You see you don’t repair lights which are
not going to work out.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:11.780
It’s a horrible stuff you see, curing people,
but you do cure.

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:17.040
You start curing people automatically with
raising [sounds like das?] not with spirit.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.170
There are another faith healers and all that
nonsense is not there.

01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:26.270
Also Kundalini can rise to a point with a
person like that.

01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:29.350
But one should not stay at that point must
go higher.

01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:35.710
Because the movement on right and left you
start getting either supra conscious or your

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:42.710
subconscious experiences which can be very
alluring and you can be quite lost in them.

01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:49.510
You start seeing lights, you start seeing
something different, you might see an aura

01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:50.510
around Me.

01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:55.940
I mean you see lots of things, you may see
something else in My past , that should not

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:56.940
be there.

01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.940
You should forget about it.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:02.290
You have to go to the airport to catch the
plane isn’t it, so don’t see all the things

01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:04.920
around, it’s all not wanted.

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:10.630
Many people get lost at that point when they
stop at Agnya, if you have concentrated here

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:15.030
this can happen more because this is broken
or if you have had this third eye business

01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:17.270
and all that you may go to the side.

01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:19.110
It can be quite dangerous.

01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:28.440
You see if you use these your samadhi for
some sort of a sensation.

01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:30.210
So you should not.

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:38.520
I mean all wise people should not use this
movement at all, as far as possible say, “No

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:39.540
we don’t want to see that.

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:42.950
We don’t want to have any supra conscious
sensation,” and all that.

01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:51.690
Then you rise higher and then you try to feel
your silence in the limbic area and you have

01:19:51.690 --> 01:19:53.970
to feel your vibrations coming out from your
head.

01:19:53.970 --> 01:20:00.130
It is the vibrations when they are flowing
that’s the best stage, when you have pierced

01:20:00.130 --> 01:20:01.630
through your Bramarundra.

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:06.510
So the second stage starts from Nirvikalpa
Samadhi growing into, which many of the Sahaja

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:14.750
Yogis have achieved in Australia, is called
as Nirvikalpa, where the is no doubts.

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:18.060
You have no doubts left about Sahaja Yoga,
you have no doubts left about yourself.

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:23.550
It’s a state, it’s not that by mentally
or rationally but it’s a state.

01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:28.220
Where you see it so clearly, white is white,
you don’t have to doubt that whether my

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:30.680
eyes are showing white or black, you see.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:35.640
That state is reached is called as Nirvikalpa
where the no vikalpa, you just go, move steadily

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:40.470
and that’s the best stage where you really
grow faster because you’re so steady and

01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:42.080
that stage must be achieved.

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:46.650
So try to achieve that stage through negating
things, “Nethi, nethi, vachinay nigamoor,”

01:20:46.650 --> 01:20:54.630
by saying, “Not this, not this, not this,”
and you reach that stage, is very clearly

01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:55.630
given.

01:20:55.630 --> 01:21:02.940
You see the trouble is, so many of these books
which are so great are never translated, people

01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:03.940
do not know about them.

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:09.270
Now after coming to Sahaja Yoga you will be
exposed to them and you will see what truths

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:22.130
there are and how Sahaja Yoga verifies it
and proves it.

01:21:22.130 --> 01:21:26.500
Question: What influence are you likely to
have on those around him or on people who

01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.540
live with You who are not realised.

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:36.790
What is the realised souls influence in that
type of environment?

01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:45.830
Shri Mataji:You see if you have stones and
if you have living trees, stones do not receive

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:51.840
anything from the sun but the leaves receive
something isn’t it, they are more sensitive,

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.190
that’s the difference.

01:21:53.190 --> 01:21:58.790
Then in Sahaja yoga there’s a possibility
that you can convert stones into living beings,

01:21:58.790 --> 01:22:00.630
can be done.

01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:10.550
Yes, because they see, you see they see you,
they understand the value that you are, gradually,

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:16.330
rationally they start understanding then they
reach certain conclusions, then they come

01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:20.540
to Sahaja Yog, then they get realised, it
works out that way.

01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:24.450
But with seekers it’s very different, seekers
just jump into it.

01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:26.980
They do not think about it they just get it.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:31.560
They get it so fast that they don’t think
about it, they just they get it.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:39.140
So they are so sensitive that’s the difference.

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:49.550
Question: Can we help our loved ones who do
not want to listen to anything particularly

01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:51.220
about Sahaja Yoga?

01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:56.960
Shri Mataji: You see there’s nobody else
that you help someone, they are all within

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:57.960
yourself.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:02.810
On the contrary, I would say better to have
them together who are Sahaja yogis because

01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:06.910
those who are not will trouble you, it will
be a problem, leave them alone, they’ll

01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:08.540
be all right, they’ll come round.

01:23:08.540 --> 01:23:13.650
Let them come on their own you cannot force
them, they’re loved ones, you’ll change

01:23:13.650 --> 01:23:18.940
now your priorities, you’ll understand that
those who are really loved ones are not really

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.100
your brothers and sisters.

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:28.500
As Christ has said, “Who are my brothers
and sisters?” Now we have to ask that question.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:32.380
Because you speak another language, you are
a different person, not that you give them

01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.360
up, but they exist.

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:37.870
But they haven’t got your awareness so is
a different thing all together.

01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:43.840
But you help them in a way, gradually they
see you but if you force them they’ll run

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:44.840
away.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:48.970
No use forcing or telling them anything about
it but you show your satisfaction and happiness

01:23:48.970 --> 01:23:54.640
and your growth and others get impressed by
it and they just come to you.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:59.970
Question: how can you..Do You help them?

01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:02.750
Shri Mataji: Yes, I do.

01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:06.290
But you should put them out of your minds
and say, “Mother, You help.

01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:20.560
If You try to help, then I’ll leave it to
You."

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:26.020
Question: He cannot understand why You say
that Christ died for us.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.320
Why did He die for us?

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:34.140
Shri Mataji: What else could He have done
with the stupid people?

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:37.210
They crucified Him, He didn’t say, “You
come and crucify Me,” did He, you see?

01:24:37.210 --> 01:24:40.070
They’re stupid, horrible people, donkeys.

01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:46.120
They didn’t understand Him, stones as they
were what to do?

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:49.230
They crucified Him, He didn’t ask.

01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:57.580
But when He was crucified the sins that they
committed in crucifying Him were to be forgiven.

01:24:57.580 --> 01:25:00.400
That’s what it is.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.880
He was, what did He do?

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:07.290
You see He died because of you because people
like you only crucified Him.

01:25:07.290 --> 01:25:08.410
You represent them.

01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:14.000
When you are realised then you are different
people, then you are resurrected.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.600
His message was resurrection not crucifixion
but that shows the stupidity of these people,

01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.600
isn’t it.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:41.270
I mean you may do that again I can’t say,
there are people.

01:25:41.270 --> 01:26:02.340
Question: Is it possible to exercise love
and acceptance when as she says You’re judging

01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:05.810
people as to whether they’re right or wrong.

01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:09.520
Warren: We are using vibrations

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:18.000
Shri Mataji: I am not judging, you are judging
because when you get your vibrations you start

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.500
judging yourself.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:26.080
You see I am not judging it’s only your
own judgment.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.170
It’s your own judgment.

01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:31.590
Are you getting your cool breeze in the hands?

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:34.040
No, then let it happen.

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:38.960
I’m not judging you it’s you are judging
it yourself.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.460
All right, then you will know yourself.

01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:46.640
Just now you are judging that you’re not
getting vibrations.

01:26:46.640 --> 01:27:01.380
Question: Is it true that Indira Gandi is
worshiped as a Goddess?

01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:22.240
Shri Mataji: oh don't, That's all political
stuff, you see Indian people are like that.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:34.650
Warren: that's useless

01:27:34.650 --> 01:27:50.090
Question: She’s confused about the fact
that You talked about love and acceptance

01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:55.880
at the beginning but then when peoples names
were brought up we often scoffed at them.

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:58.610
Shri Mataji: ah About the gurus?

01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:00.060
Ah, that’s it.

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.470
It’s a very important point.

01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:08.550
That’s very much with you people.

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:13.780
You see you have all of you, you see have
developed a philosophy where you say that

01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:17.340
nobody is evil, everything is fine.

01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:22.570
This is a very good philosophy to work with
because you also fit into the thing.

01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:24.590
That nothing is evil about you also, isn’t
it?

01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:26.100
It happens like that.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:32.720
You remember when Christ was criticising these
horrible people they asked Him, “How do

01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:34.400
You criticise them?

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.900
They do not criticise You."

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:45.170
Then He said, “Will the devil talk against
its own house?”

01:28:45.170 --> 01:28:54.220
There is a negative force working, very much
active and you have to not only scoff but

01:28:54.220 --> 01:29:02.200
get rid of these things because they are acting
as your destroying forces and they destroy

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.450
you, I see them very clearly and I have to
tell you.

01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:12.000
So love doesn’t mean that I love a snake,
will you go and love a snake, a snake must

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.429
understand first of all.

01:29:16.429 --> 01:29:20.500
In the same way we have to understand there
are evil people, that’s true.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:26.080
That is what is very much in the West, I see,
“Oh, you love everyone is all right.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.700
But you don’t love a snake, do you?

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.350
Go and have, ask snake, “I want to love
you."

01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:40.100
He’ll just finish you off.

01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:44.730
So many of you are harmed so much by these
people and I have to cure you.

01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:50.400
You don’t know what I have to go through,
such a lot of work to cure you when you are

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:51.500
affected by these people.

01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:55.260
You don’t know how much I’ve worked, morning
till evening.

01:29:55.260 --> 01:30:02.000
This morning I started six o’clock till
I came here just ten minutes I got to change

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.200
My sari and I was here.

01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:08.600
These are affected by other gurus and things
and I have to take it out.

01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:10.120
I know what harm they have done to you.

01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:16.110
You have no idea.

01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:25.050
Question: What are Your objections to chanting
and singing the holy scriptures?

01:30:25.050 --> 01:30:33.720
Shri Mataji: Not at all, who told you I am,
I’m not but you must understand that without

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:38.030
understanding what chanting is needed it’s
like a medicine.

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:40.510
Chanting is a mantra.

01:30:40.510 --> 01:30:52.550
Mantra means a thing that acts as a sound
to correct a particular thing within you,

01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:53.590
all right.

01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:57.220
It’s you can say sound therapy it is, all
right.

01:30:57.220 --> 01:31:03.260
Now you have to know what medicine is needed
for which charka, also you must know where

01:31:03.260 --> 01:31:07.710
is the problem with you, or with anybody else.

01:31:07.710 --> 01:31:13.380
I mean it would be chanting at random means
sometimes it would be sort of an indiscriminate

01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:16.150
drinking of all the medicines, you see.

01:31:16.150 --> 01:31:20.380
Taking all the medicines bottles into your
stomach emptying them without understanding.

01:31:20.380 --> 01:31:25.290
We do chant but we know where to chant, what.

01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:27.750
You see, not indiscriminate, just like that.

01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:33.350
And it’s very dangerous because when you
go on chanting say, Rama’s name or Krishna’s

01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:34.350
name.

01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:38.400
Now when you say Krishna’s name, Krishna
is here, if your Kundalini has not reached

01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:44.220
there up to this point if you take Krishna’s
name it’s very, very annoying for Krishna

01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:46.970
Himself and He recedes, sleeps off.

01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:53.260
He freezes sometimes and by that you develop
problems of the chakras and sometimes you

01:31:53.260 --> 01:31:57.630
develop throat cancer, it’s very serious.

01:31:57.630 --> 01:32:03.810
So first, you must know where is your Kundalini,
where it has gone, where it has stopped.

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:08.200
Then you should know what is the problem,
then you must know what exactly is the chanting

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:11.350
to be used, all right, and then cure that
part.

01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:17.800
You see so it’s a big science, which has
to be understood in Sahaja Yoga, it’s not

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:18.800
at random.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:24.570
You are suffering from whatever trouble you
are suffering from, you must know first of

01:32:24.570 --> 01:32:25.570
all.

01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:30.620
See many people who are Christians catch on
Agnya I told you, they do, because it’s

01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.620
unauthorised.

01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:39.790
Christ, we treat Him as if I don’t know
what, some passion fruit hanging in a tree.

01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:43.170
Do we know who He is?

01:32:43.170 --> 01:32:46.560
There is a protocol, great protocol.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.910
Even Brahma, Vishnu Mahesh could not reach
Him.

01:32:50.910 --> 01:32:57.910
So for us because we think we are born among
Christian families and because the church

01:32:57.910 --> 01:33:03.660
has given us a certificate so called do you
think we are authorised to chant His name

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:07.480
all the time and trouble Him?

01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:12.150
And what do we ask?

01:33:12.150 --> 01:33:13.820
Do we ask for our spirits?

01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:16.310
Do we ask to give our realisation?

01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:19.240
Do we ask that we have to be born again?

01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:26.440
No, what do we ask something nonsensical.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:34.260
Question: What is Your opinion about practicing
spiritualists.

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:40.200
Shri Mataji: Very dangerous, never go near
them.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:46.590
Never touch them even with a barge pole, horrible
things they are.

01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:54.260
You see it is very simple to understand that
if you get connected with any area what so

01:33:54.260 --> 01:34:00.030
ever, and somebody is connected to that area
you are exposed to that and there can be any

01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:03.230
indiscriminate aggression on you from that
area.

01:34:03.230 --> 01:34:05.110
You would not know who’s coming on you.

01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:06.610
So never go near them.

01:34:06.610 --> 01:34:13.510
May be you want to talk to your father say,
whose dead, you want to talk to him.

01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:14.510
Why?

01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:16.290
Release him, free him, why do you want to
talk to him?

01:34:16.290 --> 01:34:20.200
Now let him be alone, let him decide for himself
what he wants to do.

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:22.120
Why do you want him to hang around?

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:25.560
It’s too much, it’s too much of a load.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:31.740
Then you want to, when you use some medium
for that you do not know he might get somebody

01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:32.740
else.

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:36.130
It’s very dangerous for your children also,
so many children have died with this kind

01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:37.130
of a thing.

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:43.110
I mean you develop especially cancer, this
multiple scleroses or anything like that.

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:45.840
All these come from spiritualists.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:50.750
These are all spiritualists, these gurus are
spiritualists only.

01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:54.340
They’ll believe is spirits, they’ll handle
the spirits they’re working out, these are

01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:59.890
very dangerous things I may be able to tell
you some time how they work it out and how

01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:03.100
they master it.

01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:06.320
It’s very dangerous.

01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:10.250
They’re like vampires, what you call it,
vampires.

01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:15.090
More surprising is that there are so many
things in English language, which we don’t

01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:20.880
have, like witchcraft and the witches were
sort of punished, all sorts of things are

01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:21.880
there.

01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:27.760
In England, they talk of all these things
supernatural and all this but still I don’t

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:30.830
know how they go into it.

01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:35.970
Warren: somebody asked me a question on the
way up.

01:35:35.970 --> 01:35:36.970
Is it wrong to be a medium?

01:35:36.970 --> 01:35:41.200
This relates to the previous question, so
perhaps you could answer that Mother?

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:48.240
Shri Mataji: Oh God, I need not tell, it’s
very, very wrong to play into the hands of

01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.240
the spirits.

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:52.210
You are enslaved completely; you don’t know
what happens to you.

01:35:52.210 --> 01:35:56.840
Horrible, it creates problems absolutely you’re
an abnormal personality.

01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.660
Never do it.

01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:00.490
It’s sinful, sinful.

01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:13.920
If you accept My words really it’s horrible,
never do that.

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:19.601
Question: What is the difference between western
spirituality and eastern spirituality?

01:36:19.601 --> 01:36:23.830
Shri Mataji:Now this word spirituality means
by these spiritualists you mean?

01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:25.160
Warren: No.

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.160
Philosophy

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:29.680
Shri Mataji: Is just the same, spirit is just
the same.

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:35.920
Is universal, there is no difference at all,
I do not find any difference.

01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:42.850
Spirituality means the spirit that is the
Atma, you mean the spirit that is the Atma,

01:36:42.850 --> 01:36:43.850
the one....

01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:49.541
Question: I’m talking more about the quest
for the spirit.

01:36:49.541 --> 01:36:52.670
Shri Mataji: Search is just the same.

01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:59.990
But Indians you see now, modern Indians are
sort of developing you see, they have to go

01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:04.160
to that height to see where you have landed
yourself.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:09.672
See they can short circuit, they can short
circuit if they want but if they want they

01:37:09.672 --> 01:37:17.070
may have to go to various types of problems
you had with that affluence and they may come

01:37:17.070 --> 01:37:18.070
back.

01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:21.320
But it is better to short circuit it I tell
them.

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:31.830
While yours is a problem so easy because you
have discovered now that matter is not sufficient.

01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:36.730
Matter doesn’t give us joy, no use running
after matter.

01:37:36.730 --> 01:37:40.330
But still some of them are running after sex
you see and all that.

01:37:40.330 --> 01:37:45.190
They have to finish another circuit, once
they are over with that also then things will

01:37:45.190 --> 01:37:46.190
be better.

01:37:46.190 --> 01:37:50.340
But in all this kind of a quest you have lost
something indefinitely, no doubt.

01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:55.470
Going through the matter, going through the
sex and going through the power all these

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:59.480
trips you see you have lost something, which
requires correction.

01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:06.510
While Indians if they understand with their
wisdom they better short circuit this need

01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:09.650
not go into plastics and nylons.

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:15.130
You see I have to carry nylon saris from England
for Indians while they have their silks they

01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:16.140
want to wear nylon.

01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:22.790
So this is the difference in the basic development.

01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:27.810
But Indians if they take to Sahaja Yoga they’re
very good and easy, especially Indian villagers

01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:28.810
are excellent.

01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:32.390
They don’t understand all this they have
no mental problems you see.

01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:36.430
I don’t have to discuss with them all these
things, they have not gone into all this nonsense

01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:40.390
so they suddenly become beautiful fruits,
that’s all.

01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:47.100
So this is the difference of little degrees
I would say that you are gone to other extreme

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:53.110
and you still have to move to that extreme
or they may finish off and we can achieve

01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:54.110
results.

01:38:54.110 --> 01:38:58.460
But your quest is much ardent, very sincere
and truth.

01:38:58.460 --> 01:39:05.690
One more thing I always felt and today also
I feel that really some great souls are born

01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:12.900
in the west, that’s why is such a sincere
desire, very sincere in their desire.

01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:18.110
Indians first they come to Me for curing,
if not for curing for getting children if

01:39:18.110 --> 01:39:22.540
not for that for jobs or money all sorts of
thing they come up.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:27.140
Or they’ll say, “My mother is sick, my
father is sick, my brother is this,” all

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:28.230
this goes on.

01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:33.800
But I have met many, many seekers in the west
who just want realisation, very beautiful

01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.700
people no doubt.

01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:41.510
But you have lost something in your seeking,
no doubt, doesn’t matter.

01:39:41.510 --> 01:40:01.890
Kundalini is that ardent desire within you,
which works it out.

01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:12.010
Question: It seems as though the simpler the
life we lead the better we are, it is much

01:40:12.010 --> 01:40:13.010
easier for us.

01:40:13.010 --> 01:40:14.220
We get away from thinking and so on.

01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:22.170
Shri Mataji: I agree is a good idea of simplicity
but is a, you must understand that also very

01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:26.740
clearly because we had somebody who was a
hippy I should say.

01:40:26.740 --> 01:40:33.360
He was a real hippy, such big grown, he had
grown hair up to this much and all that.

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.110
He came to Me and scarcely wearing anything
in the horrible English cold you see.

01:40:38.110 --> 01:40:41.840
I said, “What are you doing to yourself
why don’t you clad your self properly into

01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:46.390
proper clothes and better cover yourself,”
and I was really didn’t understand him.

01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:50.530
I said, “You are not living in Africa why
are you dressed up like this, it’s like

01:40:50.530 --> 01:40:51.530
a primitive dress."

01:40:51.530 --> 01:40:53.200
He said, “I want to be primitive."

01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:55.750
I said, “You cannot by dressing up.

01:40:55.750 --> 01:41:01.150
Your brain is so over developed how can you
be primitive."

01:41:01.150 --> 01:41:03.380
You see by dressing up something do you become
that.

01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:08.950
I mean it’s just a drama you are playing
with yourself, you do not become primitive.

01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:14.681
This is the point is that and then the problem
is the brain is thinking the same way, that

01:41:14.681 --> 01:41:20.900
the same rate and everything the same, only
by changing is something that is not good

01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:22.600
because you should accept as you are.

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:25.650
Why to do something like that?

01:41:25.650 --> 01:41:31.600
But simpler life means this way, that’s
another extreme.

01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:43.940
But you see too much of formality like having
a tail coat or wearing morning dress, grey

01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:49.010
suit and then having a particular type of
a glass for a thing and all that nonsense

01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:50.370
you see you better finish off.

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:57.400
That’s bit too much going too far with it
and also caring for all these small, small

01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:03.280
things like matter that’s something that’s
grown in you.

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.610
Preservation of horrible things and useless
things and all that it’s [really?].

01:42:07.610 --> 01:42:11.370
And then to think, think, think, think about
everything, sit down and think how miserable

01:42:11.370 --> 01:42:15.440
I am and when there is no misery you just
sit down and make miseries by thinking.

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:18.850
I don’t find any thing miserable here, what
is there?

01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:24.220
You see in India these people where there
people are so happy, chirping just like birds

01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:25.220
enjoying themselves.

01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:28.950
They don’t have all the things that you
have.

01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:33.780
So you see to get out of materialism is a
better idea, to say that a simpler life means,

01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.580
but you must live beautifully.

01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:39.840
Beautiful doesn’t mean that you should have
ten types of things and all that.

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:44.500
Beautifully means you should not be as a morbid
stinking, you see.

01:42:44.500 --> 01:42:51.940
Clean and beautiful you can make beauty out
of the soil anything; with love, you can do

01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:52.940
anything.

01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:56.760
So you see it’s alright I mean what ever
way you dress up or anything makes no difference

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.550
that’s what I’m trying to say.

01:42:58.550 --> 01:43:01.190
That it is the inner thing that has to change
not the outer.

01:43:01.190 --> 01:43:03.020
Again the Sahaja Yoga is this.
