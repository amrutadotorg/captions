WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:03.200
… by the Divine.

00:04.280 --> 00:09.000
For example, if I know only my head,
that is not sufficient.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.680
If I know only my neck,
that is not sufficient.

00:12.880 --> 00:17.640
If I know only my legs,
that is not sufficient.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.120
But the more I know about myself,

00:21.320 --> 00:25.200
the more dynamic I become,

00:25.400 --> 00:30.600
the more expansive I become.

00:30.800 --> 00:40.040
And all the great that existed —

00:41.040 --> 00:44.760
or all the people
who were called as great —

00:44.960 --> 00:50.280
are great because they lived
in many human beings.

00:56.160 --> 01:00.880
I feel that warmth in the atmosphere,

01:01.080 --> 01:04.760
as you are feeling because you know
they are not foreigners,

01:04.960 --> 01:08.560
they are your brothers and sisters.

01:12.120 --> 01:18.120
There are so many stories
in Puranas like this, that…

01:20.120 --> 01:27.320
I will not name it, but once
two brothers met in a jungle.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.240
But they thought that they were enemies,

01:33.440 --> 01:36.600
and they wanted to fight with each other.

01:36.800 --> 01:41.520
And when they came to blows,
they couldn’t hit each other.

01:44.640 --> 01:48.640
Then they took out their arrows —
the arrows wouldn’t work.

01:48.840 --> 01:53.000
They were quite surprised at this,

01:53.200 --> 01:57.360
and when they asked each other,
“Who is your mother?”,

01:57.560 --> 02:01.280
they found out mother was the same.

02:01.760 --> 02:07.720
And then they realized that they were
not foreigners neither enemies

02:07.920 --> 02:12.640
but they were made of the same fibre.

02:16.720 --> 02:22.720
What sweetness, what beauty
that knowledge has given them!

02:27.640 --> 02:30.280
And what security of understanding

02:30.480 --> 02:34.400
that everywhere in the whole world
we have brothers and sisters,

02:34.600 --> 02:40.000
who are on their inner being,
on their divine,

02:40.200 --> 02:45.320
and how we are bound together
with that love!

02:47.840 --> 02:49.560
When I talk of love,

02:49.760 --> 02:54.640
people think that I am trying
to make you weak people —

02:54.840 --> 03:00.200
because people think
those who love are weak.

03:01.760 --> 03:08.320
But the most dynamic power
in this world is that of love.

03:10.520 --> 03:16.400
Is the most aggressive power —
is that of love.

03:17.440 --> 03:21.280
Even we, when we suffer in love,

03:21.480 --> 03:27.480
it is out of our strength that we suffer
and not out of our weakness.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.680
For example,
there was a teacher in China

03:35.880 --> 03:42.720
who used to teach the cocks
how to fight.

03:47.240 --> 03:52.000
And the king of that place
took his cocks to that teacher

03:52.200 --> 03:56.880
and told him that
“You please teach them how to fight.”

03:57.240 --> 04:03.360
After one month, when the king
went to take those cocks with him,

04:04.080 --> 04:09.120
he was surprised that the cocks
were just silent, doing nothing.

04:09.640 --> 04:12.240
And he told the teacher that
“What have you done to my cocks?

04:12.440 --> 04:15.040
They are not at all aggressive,
they are not doing anything!

04:15.240 --> 04:18.280
How are they going to fight it out?

04:18.480 --> 04:21.280
There’s going to be a race,

04:21.480 --> 04:24.360
there’s going to be an exhibition
of their strength,

04:24.560 --> 04:26.440
and what are we going to do about it?”

04:26.640 --> 04:29.360
He said, “You just take them.”

04:29.560 --> 04:35.360
He took those two cocks with him
and put them in the arena

04:35.560 --> 04:40.160
where there were other cocks
who had come to fight.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.760
These two cocks
were very nicely standing.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.520
All the other cocks
started coaxing and torturing.

04:49.720 --> 04:53.440
They were just standing
and looking at them.

04:54.440 --> 04:59.800
All the other cocks were surprised
at their behaviour

05:00.000 --> 05:02.600
and thought that they were very powerful.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.800
And they all fled away.

05:09.080 --> 05:14.400
The love that I’m talking about,
the divine love,

05:15.960 --> 05:21.760
makes you not only strong but dynamic.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
It is the greatest luminous power
that we can think of.

05:30.800 --> 05:38.680
Only when love is surrounded by gross
and is lost in the gross,

05:39.760 --> 05:45.720
it looks as if it is weak
and “under chains”.

05:45.920 --> 05:51.920
The time it is released,
the dynamic power of love

05:55.760 --> 06:01.120
can transcend
all the evil powers of the world.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.480
When people get their Realization,

06:09.680 --> 06:15.680
automatically the ego drops out —
to a great extent, I should say.

06:15.960 --> 06:20.160
Because you say
that the vibrations are passing;

06:20.360 --> 06:23.800
you don’t say that you are giving them.

06:28.720 --> 06:32.360
Because the dropping of the ego

06:32.560 --> 06:39.600
sometimes it happens that you feel

06:40.320 --> 06:43.600
that whatever you wanted to have
you have got it

06:43.800 --> 06:47.080
and you better not talk about it.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.000
When there is any opposition
from anywhere,

06:50.200 --> 06:55.240
you shun it and sit away from it.

06:55.680 --> 07:01.360
You don’t want to face the opposition —
of any negative opposition,

07:01.560 --> 07:07.440
whether it is by speech
or by… even by evil methods.

07:07.640 --> 07:13.040
We run away from that, thinking,
“Oh God! How are we going to face it?”

07:15.240 --> 07:20.560
On the contrary, a person
who is negative, who has got hatred,

07:20.760 --> 07:26.760
becomes… [Marathi word?] they call it,
means a person who talks big.

07:27.040 --> 07:31.960
Such a person talks… starts talking big.

07:32.480 --> 07:37.800
He thinks he is above everybody else,
he can befool all the world.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.720
He takes a responsibility on himself.

07:41.920 --> 07:47.920
He starts a big ashram or some big place
where he sits down with all his ignorance

07:48.880 --> 07:54.880
and starts spreading his knowledge —
the so-called — to people.

07:56.200 --> 08:02.200
By his methods people get impressed,
and they all go and fall at his feet.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.600
While the realized sits at home quietly,

08:06.800 --> 08:10.520
wondering what are these fools doing.

08:13.880 --> 08:19.680
But it is not now
for the realized to sit down

08:19.880 --> 08:23.760
and to wonder and laugh
at the foolishness of the people

08:23.960 --> 08:26.480
who are not yet realized.

08:26.680 --> 08:31.840
Not even to take pity on them
but to come out,

08:33.120 --> 08:37.360
come out with the sword of love
to win the whole world.

08:37.560 --> 08:41.120
It is very, very essential.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.360
If the creation has to be saved,

08:44.560 --> 08:48.840
then you are not to keep mum about it.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.760
All the wrong ideas about love,

08:57.960 --> 09:02.800
all the falsehood about love
has to be given up.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.880
One must know
that it is the dynamic power.

09:09.080 --> 09:14.600
And it won’t allow you
to sit comfortably with yourself,

09:14.800 --> 09:17.440
enjoying the peace and the bliss,

09:17.640 --> 09:22.040
when the rest of the world
is not enjoying that

09:22.240 --> 09:28.200
and is playing into the hands
of the evil geniuses

09:28.400 --> 09:32.560
who have come in this world to destroy

09:32.760 --> 09:40.240
and to bring the satanic realm

09:42.480 --> 09:45.200
on this earth.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.280
Now the days are gone
when the people had to suffer.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.160
Christ suffered for us.

09:50.360 --> 09:54.760
Of course, Christ never suffered,
because He never suffered.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.960
He never wept.

10:01.040 --> 10:06.440
He was like those cocks,
a very powerful personality.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.800
But today is the day

10:10.280 --> 10:13.360
to brighten up your understanding

10:13.560 --> 10:18.920
about your own strength
that is within you.

10:24.120 --> 10:30.120
Those who are gross
should worry about their insecurities,

10:30.400 --> 10:34.760
and their problems,
and their organizations —

10:34.960 --> 10:39.040
but not for the people who are realized.

10:39.240 --> 10:43.320
I have told you many a times —
and today he also remarked —

10:43.520 --> 10:47.080
that you should know you are never alone
when you are realized.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.920
There have been many people
who have been realized,

10:50.120 --> 10:52.640
before even you were born,

10:52.840 --> 10:55.800
who exist,

10:56.000 --> 11:01.200
who are anxious to help you
at every moment.

11:08.160 --> 11:12.400
In our shastras [scriptures] we call them
chiranjivas [eternal beings], you know them.

11:12.600 --> 11:16.640
They are people who are niranjanas
[pure, free from falsehood].

11:19.840 --> 11:25.840
As he said about Bhairava and Hanumana,
all these people exist,

11:26.240 --> 11:31.280
and they are waiting
just for a call from you.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.880
Once we went to the market,

11:44.600 --> 11:48.280
and there was a problem

11:50.760 --> 11:53.760
about something.

11:54.560 --> 11:59.360
And I had somebody with Me, a disciple…
who was also with Me.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.680
I just wanted to see
what will be his reaction.

12:02.880 --> 12:07.960
He tried to argue out with a person
to tell him about something.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.080
So he told Me, “Mataji, let us go now.”

12:11.280 --> 12:14.360
When we came out the shop, I said,
“What are you going to do about it?”

12:14.560 --> 12:18.520
He said, “I have already told Hanuman
to look after that part.”

12:18.720 --> 12:20.960
And the work was done.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.520
It is gross, but it happens.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.240
When they fail
[Shri Mataji could mean “you fail”],

12:29.440 --> 12:34.080
you can leave it to anyone of them,
and they will have to jolly well do it.

12:34.280 --> 12:38.000
Because it is you who are on the stage
and not they.

12:38.200 --> 12:41.360
They are the background people.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.600
They are the playbacks.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.760
But you must open your mouth;
otherwise, if they start thinking,

12:48.960 --> 12:50.960
what will people say?

12:51.160 --> 12:55.720
They are going to help you in every way,

12:55.920 --> 12:59.520
but how far are you standing
on your security?

12:59.720 --> 13:05.720
How far you are standing on your property,
on your understanding of yourself?

13:09.480 --> 13:12.000
It’s a great war going on.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.920
You are not aware of it?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.840
Some of you are.

13:16.040 --> 13:17.880
Some of you are definitely aware of it

13:18.080 --> 13:23.200
because they have had the experience
of fighting it out.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.640
It’s a big war on.

13:33.840 --> 13:39.840
Now specially, when ten rakshasas [demons]
have taken their avataras [incarnations].

13:43.560 --> 13:48.920
And for you to be so feeble…

13:52.440 --> 13:55.840
You are still small children, no doubt,

13:56.040 --> 13:59.360
because you got your Realization
only a few days back.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.800
But if you want, you can grow very fast.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.560
You can grow into big, big giants.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.320
All of you can grow.

14:07.520 --> 14:13.280
Only thing, you have to decide
that you have to grow within.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.200
There are so many things

14:18.400 --> 14:24.000
that you only have discovered,
by which a person grows.

14:26.760 --> 14:29.760
I can give you food,

14:30.800 --> 14:34.520
but you have to grow yourself.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.800
Wherever you see the negativity,
you have to stand up and say,

14:43.000 --> 14:46.760
“This is negativity and nothing else,
whether you like it or not.”

14:46.960 --> 14:50.880
In that, you love that person,
you don’t hate.

14:51.080 --> 14:55.600
Only talking sweetly
is not the idea of love.

14:55.800 --> 14:59.640
No, a mother sometimes
even scolds the child.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.160
Doesn’t mean that she doesn’t love him.

15:02.360 --> 15:06.240
If it is necessary, you have to tell
the person that it is negativity.

15:06.440 --> 15:10.240
Of course, if there’s a realized person,
he won’t mind any correction,

15:10.440 --> 15:14.120
because he wants the correction,
he knows that it has to be corrected.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.080
The instrument has to be corrected.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.600
But a person who doesn’t understand,

15:20.960 --> 15:23.760
you have to force your love
on that person.

15:23.960 --> 15:28.160
You can force that love,
you know that — sitting down here.

15:28.360 --> 15:33.200
Many people have tried putting love
around certain people

15:33.400 --> 15:35.440
who were trying to be mischievous —

15:35.640 --> 15:40.560
and they have been able to achieve
great results.

15:40.760 --> 15:44.080
Those people have turned back
and come back.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.920
Only by putting your hand
and putting your attention on that person

15:48.120 --> 15:49.760
and moving this hand like this,

15:49.960 --> 15:54.400
the love encircles,
and the person comes back.

15:56.040 --> 16:02.520
There is no doubt
that there is negativity and positivity,

16:02.720 --> 16:05.560
nothing in between these,
you must remember.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.920
There is no compromise between the two.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.920
Either it is light and darkness,

16:13.760 --> 16:17.280
or it is positive and negative —

16:17.480 --> 16:23.480
definitely there are two things
that are fighting.

16:28.880 --> 16:33.840
Only thing, your will —
that’s the trouble with the whole joke.

16:34.040 --> 16:39.320
That your will is respected,
your will is throughout respected.

16:39.520 --> 16:45.680
If you have the will
to be a giant that loves, you can be.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.760
The other day I met a psychiatrist,

16:50.000 --> 16:51.920
and he was catching
his superego very much.

16:52.120 --> 16:53.640
I said, “What’s wrong with you?”

16:53.840 --> 16:58.200
He said, “My childhood.
My childhood, I couldn’t get much love.”

16:58.400 --> 17:02.040
I said, “Now I am there.
You come in My lap. Take the love.”

17:02.240 --> 17:04.840
He said, “I want to flow my love, Mother.

17:05.040 --> 17:10.160
I want to open out myself,
completely, without any fear.”

17:10.360 --> 17:13.320
I said, “You just start it.

17:13.520 --> 17:17.760
Don’t worry what people
are going to misunderstand,

17:19.120 --> 17:20.320
what people are going to say.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.920
It’s nothing important
what people are going to say or anything.

17:24.120 --> 17:28.760
For love, the satisfaction is only love,
that you love another person.”

17:28.960 --> 17:32.960
“You just flow your love,” I said,
“and you will feel it will work out.

17:33.160 --> 17:37.280
Just decide that ‘I am going
to love people.’

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
And once you decide that,
the whole heaven,

17:43.200 --> 17:47.400
the whole power of the heaven
will fall at your feet.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.080
You believe Me in this.”

17:50.280 --> 17:54.920
If you see otherwise,
I am an ordinary housewife.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.880
Some people always say,
“Mataji, how can be like this?”

17:58.080 --> 18:00.520
Why not? I am just like you.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.960
I have the same problems as you have.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.960
But only thing I know,

18:06.160 --> 18:11.440
that I am nothing but embodiment
of that love that is divine,

18:11.640 --> 18:14.840
and I can’t exist without it.

18:15.040 --> 18:21.040
Every moment of My life
let the love flow, let the love flow.

18:21.280 --> 18:28.720
Every wave of My mind conveys the love.

18:33.040 --> 18:38.120
And that makes you completely powerful.

18:38.680 --> 18:42.160
If you read…
I was reading Devi Mahatmyam that…

18:42.360 --> 18:45.560
they talk about a rakshasa

18:45.760 --> 18:51.760
who faced Primordial Mother,
the Divine Mother,

18:52.320 --> 18:57.200
and he laughed at Her: “You woman!
What can you do to me, you are a woman!

18:57.400 --> 18:58.840
What can you do to me?”

18:59.040 --> 19:05.040
And She smiled at him and said,
“All right, come along, let us see.”

19:06.280 --> 19:10.440
And with one stroke, She cut his throat.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.080
Very clearly that shows

19:14.280 --> 19:17.640
that positivity can cut
the throat of negativity.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.680
There is no himsa [violence] in that.

19:19.880 --> 19:23.160
You must remember the difference
between the two.

19:23.360 --> 19:26.600
If negativity is cut
and positive brought out,

19:26.800 --> 19:30.600
that is the greatest ahimsa [non-violence]
you can do to someone.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.560
You have seen what negativity does to people;
you have now known what is negativity.

19:34.760 --> 19:39.240
You have seen how people suffer
with spirits on them.

19:41.400 --> 19:45.040
And here, they are also anxious
to be loved your way,

19:45.240 --> 19:49.480
you’ll be surprised to know that —
if you really love them.

19:49.680 --> 19:53.680
They themselves come to Me
and say, “Give me salvation, Mother.”

19:53.880 --> 19:56.480
They come to Me only for that —
sometimes with you —

19:56.680 --> 19:58.600
that I should give them salvation.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.320
And if I promise that,
they take the birth again.

20:01.520 --> 20:05.240
But there are rakshasas,
there are rakshasas.

20:05.440 --> 20:10.960
As I told you the other day,
the Kali Yuga has laid a beautiful stage,

20:11.160 --> 20:15.280
and a very wonderful drama
is to be played —

20:15.480 --> 20:23.680
in which the Ravana
has to love Sita as a mother,

20:24.960 --> 20:30.240
the Kansa has to fall
at the feet of Radha.

20:32.840 --> 20:38.840
Perhaps, you do not know
that Krishna wanted to kill Kansa.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.800
At that time, he was His uncle.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.320
So, you see, the feeling came in Him,
of His mother,

20:45.520 --> 20:48.560
that “After all, he is my brother.”
[Shri Mataji could mean “her brother”]

20:48.760 --> 20:50.960
So He asked Radha, and Radha killed him —

20:51.160 --> 20:54.840
the Radha, who loved
the whole world at that time.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.760
She is the embodiment of love,
and She killed Kansa —

20:58.960 --> 21:03.080
because it was to be.

21:03.960 --> 21:07.400
When you are playing
in the hands of God,

21:07.600 --> 21:13.600
then, if He wants to kill some body,
it has to be slain.

21:16.840 --> 21:21.840
But first of all you have to be
in the hands of God completely.

21:22.040 --> 21:28.040
It is His love only
which kills this body.

21:35.800 --> 21:48.680
And when the songs
of their strength and victory is sung —

21:48.880 --> 21:53.800
you have seen it, all My chakras,
how they start working and vibrating.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.440
Because the strength
of those victorious days

21:59.640 --> 22:04.800
is still lingering on,
and it is going to work through you.

22:05.520 --> 22:09.720
But what about your poor instrument,

22:12.160 --> 22:15.920
which is moving little slowly?

22:23.640 --> 22:29.760
The time when love has to rule,
the Satya Yuga,

22:29.960 --> 22:38.320
if it has to come, it is going to be
through your efforts, now.

22:39.600 --> 22:45.600
Before Sahaja Yoga, no efforts.
But now, all your efforts are divine.

22:45.880 --> 22:49.560
Whatever you do,
whatever sympathetic you activate,

22:49.760 --> 22:55.080
you are getting it through parasympathetic —
you don’t do anything at all.

22:58.680 --> 23:04.680
But you can see yourself
what stakes are involved.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.200
You are the chosen ones,
otherwise why is it

23:13.400 --> 23:16.280
that you are the only people
who got this Realization

23:16.480 --> 23:18.920
and so much you have come forward?

23:19.120 --> 23:23.480
Some of you got it only few days back
and have gone very far. Why?

23:23.680 --> 23:29.160
You are the chosen ones,
and you have to take it upon yourself

23:31.720 --> 23:37.680
to be the channels of that divine love,
that dynamic power,

23:37.880 --> 23:43.280
which is going to transform
the whole conception of hatred

23:43.480 --> 23:49.080
on which all these nations
and all these differences are created.

23:50.720 --> 23:55.120
It looks sometimes: how? how can it be?

24:02.400 --> 24:06.200
But now the days are gone, of Gokul
[city of Shri Krishna’s childhood].

24:06.400 --> 24:08.080
I was thinking of it.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.800
Of the time when Krishna
used to play His flute

24:11.000 --> 24:16.400
and He tried His Sahaja Yoga on the gopis
and the gopas [cowherd girls and boys].

24:18.400 --> 24:22.080
Oh, we tried and tried and tried,
in different lives!

24:22.280 --> 24:25.120
Nothing worked.

24:25.320 --> 24:31.320
And now it is going to click
like a spark.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.880
The chain reaction will start.

24:38.080 --> 24:41.480
But we have to have
strong machines to carry that.

24:41.680 --> 24:45.240
Otherwise the fuse will be off.

24:46.360 --> 24:50.600
Only the strength that is in you
is to be felt by your attention.

24:50.800 --> 24:54.200
That’s the only thing you have to do —
is to feel your attention

24:54.400 --> 24:57.360
and give up all that is falsehood.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.720
All that is falsehood
you see within yourself,

24:59.920 --> 25:02.080
and you will know what is falsehood
and just drop it.

25:02.280 --> 25:07.360
Accept only the truth,
and the truth will give you that power

25:07.560 --> 25:10.760
to be the real instrument,

25:10.960 --> 25:14.000
to carry this channel,

25:15.200 --> 25:18.280
that force of love.

25:29.680 --> 25:33.800
It should not mean
that you have to be egoistic —

25:34.000 --> 25:37.520
you cannot be even if you try to.

25:37.760 --> 25:41.400
You cannot harm anyone
even if you want to trouble.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.960
So many of you have expressed

25:43.160 --> 25:45.600
that “Mataji, You are giving it
to every Dick, Tom and Harry.”

25:45.800 --> 25:47.280
I can’t give it to Dick, Tom and Harry —

25:47.480 --> 25:49.880
it has to be a man
who has been searching,

25:50.080 --> 25:52.960
it has to be a woman who has been searching
in their previous lives.

25:53.160 --> 25:58.560
You should know that whatever you have got it,
you have got it in your own right.

25:59.120 --> 26:02.200
So, a person may look
like a Dick, Tom, Harry,

26:02.400 --> 26:05.000
but he is not, he’s a great saint.

26:05.200 --> 26:08.040
They are all saints sitting here.

26:08.240 --> 26:11.600
It’s a centre and nucleus of saintliness

26:11.800 --> 26:15.480
where the complete Divine is flowing.

26:15.680 --> 26:20.720
Only thing is, let it flow out from you.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.120
This power is that of God,

26:28.320 --> 26:30.800
and it is not your responsibility

26:31.000 --> 26:34.320
to worry as to whether it will do
good or bad.

26:34.520 --> 26:37.920
Even if you think
that it may do some bad things

26:38.120 --> 26:42.160
according to the moral sciences
of this world,

26:42.360 --> 26:46.280
ultimately it is going to be all right.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.560
Why that Jarasandha was to be killed?
Why that Kansa was to be killed?

26:50.760 --> 26:54.000
Why Ravana was to be killed?

26:55.240 --> 26:59.040
Of course, killing doesn’t help much —
that I have realized.

26:59.240 --> 27:04.160
Because all those who were killed
are back again in their saddles.

27:06.440 --> 27:11.400
But still, you don’t fight

27:13.120 --> 27:16.240
those horrible people.

27:16.440 --> 27:20.240
You just fight yourself out.

27:22.480 --> 27:25.680
You just watch yourself.

27:25.880 --> 27:29.440
Where are you? What are you doing?

27:29.640 --> 27:34.720
Are you on the divine or on the gross?

27:34.920 --> 27:38.840
Just think about it every moment,

27:39.040 --> 27:41.720
every moment you are in meditation.

27:41.920 --> 27:46.280
Just think of the moment
and the dynamism of that moment.

27:46.480 --> 27:52.080
The complete power that is filling
every moment just to go inside you.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.120
It will flow through your Sahastrara
inside your being,

27:55.320 --> 28:00.760
and completely revolve
around your whole being,

28:01.360 --> 28:05.440
and transform the inside
into a complete Chaitanya Shakti,

28:05.640 --> 28:08.800
a complete Divine Power.

28:09.680 --> 28:13.280
Allow it to come in, accept it.

28:13.480 --> 28:15.640
Accept it without any fear.

28:15.840 --> 28:18.840
Let it get in.

28:22.120 --> 28:26.520
Every moment, every moment keep awake.

28:26.720 --> 28:31.480
It’s a very precarious time
that we are up to.

28:31.680 --> 28:35.880
I have only two hands,
you can see that very clearly.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.680
And though Mr. ___ says
that I can do everything,

28:39.880 --> 28:45.880
I can do everything
but not to make you do something.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.880
Your will will be respected throughout.

28:55.880 --> 28:59.360
Every other thing can be looked after

28:59.560 --> 29:05.560
except for one —
that you should be a perfect machine,

29:06.160 --> 29:12.160
a perfect channel, a perfect flute

29:13.120 --> 29:18.720
for My Lord to play that tune of love.

29:19.000 --> 29:24.920
It is for you to clear out
all your seven holes.

29:29.320 --> 29:33.080
It is for you to clear out
your hollowness

29:33.280 --> 29:38.960
and to be complete within yourself —
and He knows His job.

29:40.840 --> 29:44.160
He is the artist.

29:44.360 --> 29:48.080
But you are the instruments.

29:49.160 --> 29:55.160
And the harmonious music
from so many souls

29:56.440 --> 30:00.440
can fill the ears of these evil people

30:00.640 --> 30:05.440
and can penetrate into their heart
and put love into them,

30:05.640 --> 30:12.520
and may be that they themselves
will give up their evil ways

30:12.720 --> 30:16.680
and fall at the feet of love.

30:21.920 --> 30:27.920
Krishna is to be born within you today.

30:33.040 --> 30:39.040
A five-year-old boy went to kill Kaliya
[monstrous serpent who lived in river Yamuna].

30:40.880 --> 30:45.480
That Krishna is to be born within you.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.280
Went and sat on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara

30:49.480 --> 30:52.360
and was pressing with His feet,

30:52.560 --> 30:58.560
and all the people were seeing
this great drama

30:59.040 --> 31:04.520
of Krishna’s dancing
on the Kaliya’s Sahastrara.

31:06.200 --> 31:11.600
Krishna is to be born within your being.

31:14.160 --> 31:18.520
When you are Krishna,
you are not going to see Him.

31:33.160 --> 31:40.080
Let us now go to the state

31:40.280 --> 31:43.160
which is beyond words,

31:43.360 --> 31:45.920
beyond thoughts,

31:46.120 --> 31:52.880
into the realm of thoughtless awareness,

31:54.200 --> 32:00.440
where the Divine
is pouring its blessings.

32:06.920 --> 32:12.920
These people have decided today
to have a puja,

32:14.160 --> 32:18.680
and you know what happens to Me
when you do My puja.

32:19.240 --> 32:24.560
So, with all those problems
that we’ll be facing later,

32:24.760 --> 32:29.520
I would like all of you
to be attentive about the puja

32:29.720 --> 32:36.080
and to take full advantage of that.

32:36.960 --> 32:42.240
With this puja you get
the Mother’s protection,to begin with.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.520
And My chakras, when they start moving,

32:45.720 --> 32:50.280
they give you special powers of love,

32:50.480 --> 32:55.400
and bless all your chakras,
and fill them up completely.

32:55.600 --> 32:58.600
So I would like you —

32:59.360 --> 33:01.720
though some two people
are coming to do this —

33:01.920 --> 33:04.880
all of you to feel
that you all are doing it —

33:05.080 --> 33:08.640
and you can feel it that way
with oneness.

33:08.840 --> 33:15.040
And the blessings of My being
will flow to you automatically.
