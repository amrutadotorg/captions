00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.280
In India we celebrate the changing of the
Sun’s orbit.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:19.820
So now he turns away from Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.380
Is it so, now?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:37.270
So, now the heat is going to come more in
this country.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:49.210
So to prepare for the heat and to prepare
people for that they give a little jaggery

00:00:49.210 --> 00:01:03.720
and sesame seeds or sugar and sesame seeds
and say that “We give you sweet so you also

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.070
speak sweetly”, because the heat makes people
rather bitter.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.579
And, if there’s heat inside you, then you
start talking very bitterly to each other.

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:22.909
So to pacify that heat they give the sugar
or the jaggery for your livers.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.130
But you can’t just give that, so with that
there is ‘teela’ (sesame) which is also

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.899
a soothing oil.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:30.899
Now.

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.210
It’s very symbolic, that’s all.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.749
It’s a symbolic thing.

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:48.499
And it is done every 14th of January in this
country.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:53.810
It is called as ‘Makar Sankranti’.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.279
It’s the change to ‘makar’ – means
Capricorn.

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:01.750
And it’s surprising!

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.009
Like in the ancient times Cancer was called
as ‘karka’ (कर्क) in India and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.459
you also call this thing as cancer since long.

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.290
Now, the disease cancer is also called ‘cancer’.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.799
Just see how it is related.

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.510
And in Indian language also it is called as
the disease of the Cancer, in the sense karka,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.360
they call it karka roga (कर्क रोग),
you see – two words.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:36.329
They also call it due to the ‘karka roga’
and that also called ‘karka roga’ means

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.400
– heat producing.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.159
It produces heat first of all.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:50.450
And secondly it had another meaning, that
in cancer, cancer stands for the Mother.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.020
So when you commit sins against the Mother
cancer is produced.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.440
Sin against the Mother.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.860
Cancer sign is the sign of the Mother only;
and when you try to commit sins against the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.829
Mother this starts.

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.159
And since my advent this disease has become
very prevalent because sin against the Mother

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.170
is the biggest sin in the modern times.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.790
So, one must know that the sin against the
Mother will lead, equal, to cancer.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.610
So it started from Ganesha tattwa.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.709
Many people who have this problem, Ganesha
problem, they may be very good in other things

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.859
but still, if there is the left Ganesha problem,
they should be very, very careful.

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.099
It’s like a hole in your being.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:55.010
And to overcome that problem you may cover
up with something else.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.609
Like such people may say, “Oh, I am so great.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.769
I will never feel like this."

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.409
That’s not a good thing.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.470
Just overcome your Ganesha problem with which
you are perverted.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:14.049
So all these perversions must be sucked in
just like a tortoise sucks in the four limbs

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.640
within themselves.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.930
That is how you must suck in those things.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:28.370
And do not try to overcome by Right Vishuddhi,
by saying that you are great or you are this

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.830
or you are that.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.720
Some people I have seen also try to show off
about it and try to say things which looks

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.950
quite big, but ultimately I find that they
have a Left Mooladhara.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.850
It’s a serious thing it is, very, very serious.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.009
So be careful.

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.569
Don’t deceive yourself.

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.139
Anyone of you.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:56.810
Those who have Left Mooladhara problem have
to be extremely careful not to be tempted

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.500
to any supraconscious behaviour or talking.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:15.259
Try to overcome it by complete surrendering,
say “I do not know anything Mother."

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:25.270
[That’s the] first mantra for them.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:34.550
“Mother, I do not know anything”.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.240
If you surrender.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.640
Because it’s a Mother.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.110
Like Shri Ganesha.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.550
He never shows off anything.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.500
He’s just surrendered, completely.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.430
He says, “I do not know!”

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.340
Like Adi Shankaracharya, “I do not know
Mother."

00:05:50.340 --> 00:06:00.560
The more you
try to sort of express yourself logically

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.710
or with your brains, then know that you are
deviating from that point because that’s

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.150
the only way you compensate.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.000
So be careful.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.700
I am telling all of you.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.570
It’s very common in the West, I have seen.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:33.020
Suddenly they become all Sahaja Yogi experts
and then they fall down hard!

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:49.970
So those who think they are great Sahaja Yogis
must know there is something seriously wrong

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:57.169
with them, first of all.

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:03.860
You all have to grow together, nobody should
try to show off.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:18.940
I know who is where.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.940
That’s very important.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:47.680
And you need not feel jealous of such people
or enamoured of such people.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:55.259
Know that you have to deal with Reality.

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:59.820
So Left Mooladhara is a very serious problem.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.980
Be careful of it.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.680
It can be infectious.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.810
It can be just catch over.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:14.400
Sahaja Yoga has only that very delicate point
among Western Sahaja Yogis.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.189
Only on this point – Left Mooladhara – so
be careful.

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:22.379
Try to keep your attention clear.

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.810
Perversions – keep it away.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:31.810
Try to keep yourself, your chakras alright.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:40.990
Better thing is to look after your chakras
than to discuss it.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.740
Who are coughing?

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:49.680
There’s something definitely wrong.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:56.000
All this, why are you coughing?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.690
You are not paying attention properly.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:06.329
(Coughing stops immediately) You have to look
after yourselves.

00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:10.260
You are disturbing me when I am talking – is
something wrong.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.540
You’d better look after of yourselves.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:21.510
You have to say, “Allah hu Akbar,” sixteen
times, morning, evening.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.399
Put yourself to test.

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:29.430
Try to avoid eating things which are not good
for your throat.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.480
You may gargle.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:42.060
You see, sometimes people feel proud of it
sometimes, the way they look at it.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.060
I am surprised.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.870
One should be ashamed.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:49.930
So, please, see that you look after your throats
and don’t disturb me.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:57.160
I have done much more travelling that you
have done.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.160
You know that.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.170
I have gone through too much.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:06.680
And apart from that you know that I sleep
very late, compared to you.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.950
If your throats are not alright, please, look
after them.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.990
There must be something wrong.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.990
What’s it?

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.990
Some bhoots are there.

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.990
It is that.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.990
How is it it’s not coming now?

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.990
Better do your dhuni and everything; everything
that you want to do.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.990
It’s nothing!

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.990
It’s important .

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.320
How can it be?

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.120
How are you getting this all the time, all
the time?

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.360
So, now, I give you dhunis, this, that – finished!

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:46.800
I have suffered much more, in the sense that
I have gone through a lot of sufferings in

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.490
the way that I am raising their Kundalini,
everything.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:50.490
You know that.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.410
But to say even that, “There was too much
dust,” and all that: you must get used to

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.410
it.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.410
It’s possible.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:08.610
On the contrary, the more you try to do it
(coughing), the better you feel.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:20.329
You feel are doing a contribution to my talk.

00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:23.150
You are saints.

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.340
Behave like saints.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.880
That’s important.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:36.910
But first, give them, those who have coughs,
put something in the mouth.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.790
And you should not cough.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:40.160
Give them something to eat.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.079
Look after yourselves.

00:11:43.079 --> 00:11:48.490
I should look after such big, big boys?

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.360
You better look after yourself.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:58.949
Do you find any one of the Indian Sahaja Yogis
coughing?

00:11:58.949 --> 00:12:00.310
No one!

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.360
You must look after yourselves!

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.680
Moving your hands too much also you do it.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:17.839
All the time you talk like this.

00:12:17.839 --> 00:12:20.480
Don’t do all that.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.709
Keep your hands steady.

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:28.019
Respect them!

00:12:28.019 --> 00:12:31.620
Try to steady your hands.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:44.940
All the time jerkiness, shifting your hands
too much also is not good.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:57.310
There’s something one must understand: we
have to get into Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:01.620
To work it out in a serious way.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.089
Work it out!

00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:12.440
No use carrying on with the nonsense.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:19.839
There’s no use getting angry with yourself.

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:37.790
No use also sort of saying that “I, I, I”
“I don’t know” “I am this thing”.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.959
It’s a nonsense.

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:51.519
“I am this,” “I am that,” “I can
feel it."

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:54.709
All this is nonsense!

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:59.050
It’s supraconscious nonsense going on.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.790
Be careful!

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:07.820
You should not try to impress others by your
nonsense at all.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:32.170
Then there’s another thing I will tell you
about.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:40.500
Rustom, did you say that you have to learn
Sanskrit to know Sahaja Yoga?

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.050
Not at all.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:45.600
It’s absolutely wrong.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.850
Please take it from me.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:54.160
Again mental activity [that] you started.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.480
Better stop it!

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:05.000
All these wrong ideas you should not get into
your head.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.190
Dhumal does not know a word of Sanskrit.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.910
Not a word of Sanskrit.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.740
What is there?

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:24.900
It is all borrowed feathers?

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:35.190
Even why borrow from Adi Shankaracharya?

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:47.190
What is all your depth, your feelings?

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:55.760
Why to borrow from others?

00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:18.050
Develop your own feelings, your depth, your
sources instead of borrowing from anyone.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:24.910
Why to learn Sanskrit?

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:30.060
There’s no need.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:49.209
You may know something about Shankaracharya
but not about Sahaja Yoga and not at all about

00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:50.319
me.

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:58.089
So don’t go into all these tricks.

00:16:58.089 --> 00:17:08.490
Now you stop making any names or anything!

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:13.130
Please stop it!

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:27.050
Otherwise you’ll get into supraconscious,
I am telling you.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:33.240
Just don’t do it.

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:53.380
All these mental activities you all must stop
because the main problem is your left side.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:18:08.520
And tomorrow is the day when you have to decide.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:28.320
Tomorrow is the day when we worship the Surya,
tomorrow is the day we worship the Saraswati,

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:38.160
so that the Saraswati should give you your
exhausted energy that has passed out and now

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.000
don’t exhaust Her more.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.840
Use your Left side.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:51.970
Surrender to your Mother, be good mothers,
be good daughters.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:52.970
Alright?

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.810
Surrendering is the way.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:19:01.060
And don’t think too much about Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:10.450
Talking, “chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck”
about Sahaja Yoga is not the way.

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:14.360
All such people rise nowhere.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.700
I know that.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:30.780
I know everyone, I know people who just think
too much of Sahaja Yoga; I know them very

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.780
well.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.250
They don’t know anything about me.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:42.040
On the feet I know.

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:48.280
On the vibrations I know.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:55.810
On their development I know.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:21.530
There’s no need at all to know Sanskrit,
it’s true, but it is the need to know your

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:39.550
Mother; through your love, through your pure
understanding.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:21:09.820
Because it will take you because you are used
to that kind of a thing.

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:20.840
You
want to know the whole of Sanskrit, the whole

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:22.560
of this and the whole of that.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.860
You’ll read the whole of Vedas.

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:30.481
I mean so many are like this here in this
country – useless for me, good for nothing.

00:21:30.481 --> 00:21:31.481
Just forget it!

00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:32.481
Don’t go into that trip of knowing through
your brains.

00:21:32.481 --> 00:21:33.481
Know through your heart.

00:21:33.481 --> 00:21:45.490
And that’s the reason [you do that] is because
it’s not available to you.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:53.050
That’s the base.

00:21:53.050 --> 00:22:11.320
The Left Mooladhara is harmed so you turn
to another thing!

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.910
That’s not available.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:20.460
That innocence is not available.

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.460
Try to go to that.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:32.790
Try to awaken that within you and then you
will be amazed [that] you will know me better.

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:37.170
And yesterday only I told you how these complications
have created a barrier.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:45.970
They just see me.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:56.720
And just see their faces.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.730
In the same way.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:17.270
Still you look so sometimes miserable, sometimes
look lost.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.570
No?

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:35.720
Because still you are using your brains.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:47.780
Using your brains is not the way to get to
Sahaja Yoga, please.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:48.780
Better now your throats?

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.110
You are not coughing?

00:23:52.110 --> 00:24:00.020
These were all bhoots.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:09.920
What has happened to you?

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:22.000
Now try to cough! (laughter but no coughing)

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:32.770
But if you want to know Sanskrit, you can
know.

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:44.920
But that’s not the end.

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:53.630
And that’s not the way.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:25:06.870
Of course, on your way you can know it, but
that’s not the way.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:26:33.910
I mean, I don’t want you to get to things
where you are diverted from your own surrendering

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:35.780
and ascent – that’s more important.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:39.340
What Shankaracharya has said ultimately is
already translated in English.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:28:16.120
If you see that he has just talked of surrender,
nothing [else].

00:28:16.120 --> 00:29:15.660
Has he talked of anything else Rustom?

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.960
That’s it.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:30:41.781
All these names, also, that you have given
me are just a part of it, Sahaja Yoga is also

00:30:41.781 --> 00:30:42.781
part of it.

00:30:42.781 --> 00:30:45.300
When I am with you, why should you care for
these things?

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.090
Try to establish that.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:31:00.200
Because of that you use your brains too much.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:12.230
Establish to your Left Mooladhara.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:17.040
Better now?

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:29.650
Be in Nirvichara.

00:31:29.650 --> 00:32:30.470
See, where is your coughing gone?

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:40.610
Finished!

00:32:40.610 --> 00:33:04.270
They have run away.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:14.300
In the same way you should control them.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.780
Tell them off.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:25.440
Also you speak too much, while travelling
be in a meditative mood.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.440
Don’t speak.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.440
There’s no need to speak.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.440
Be in meditative mood.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.180
You are with me, I am with you.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.170
Keep in meditative mood.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:41.140
It will help you; very much help you.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:34:12.889
It is here you should keep quiet – absolutely
– and feel it.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:36:00.350
No discussions, no talkings, not using your
brains.

00:36:00.350 --> 00:38:28.110
You have come here to gain something within
for your altering.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:39:21.849
Be responsible about it.

00:39:21.849 --> 00:39:25.200
Some people definitely, Mathias, improved
a lot.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200
Tremendous!

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.660
I was amazed!

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.290
He improved.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:47.190
But some are just the same.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:40:01.080
I asked them, “How are you?”

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:08.030
Still like that.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:19.610
I mean, what to do?

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:25.870
Try to pacify yourself.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.950
Be peaceful.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:34.020
Be peaceful.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:42.170
Tell yourself, “Be peaceful.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:46.240
Be careful.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.320
Be peaceful."

00:40:50.320 --> 00:41:15.230
And just imagine, before I started my lecture,
nobody was coughing and suddenly, as soon

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:21.490
as you sat down, one after another there was
a competition.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:31.460
Look at the bhoots how they are acting through
you.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:36.320
Even if the rakshasas want, they cannot cough
before me; know that.

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.150
Only because you are my children you can have
audacity to do that.

00:41:39.150 --> 00:41:40.150
Alright?

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:41.150
Now don’t try to disturb me.

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.810
So, before tomorrow’s puja we have to arrange
our baths properly, whatever it is.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.350
I am going to have the puja starting at ten
o’clock, not earlier.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:55.540
But you need not go out or anything; have
your bath and all that, and then I am going

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:57.400
to come down here.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.400
Clear cut?

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.400
Keep yourself aloof with others.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.400
Don’t get entangled with anybody else.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.400
Keep quiet.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.400
Don’t talk.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.400
Have the maximum now for this puja at least.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.400
And it’s going to be Saraswati puja for
the first time.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.400
Actually I wanted to do Ekadasha but to do
Ekadasha is not an easy thing.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.400
Then I thought, let it be.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.400
Not tomorrow.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.400
But one day we’ll have to do that, also,
but we have to prepare ourselves.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400
Now, don’t talk.

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.400
Keep quiet.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.400
Just keep quiet.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.400
And then sit down here for meditation.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.400
All of you come quietly.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.160
Actually you don’t have to do anything.

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.360
You don’t have to organise, or nothing.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.940
You don’t have to do that.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:21.970
Now those Indians who are organising are in
meditative mood!

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:22.970
It’s surprising!

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:27.080
Those who are organising, who are running
about, managing this, managing that.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:35.870
It’s not an easy thing, you know, to manage
for so many people’s food, morning, evening,

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.250
every time.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:44.120
They are in meditative mood.

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:54.040
So keep yourself in meditative mood tomorrow.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.040
Try.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:56.910
Tell yourself, “Be peaceful.

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.060
Be peaceful.

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:00.350
My mind, be peaceful.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.500
Be still.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.640
Be still."

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.520
Tell your mind to be still.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.520
Alright?

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.520
And you will be amazed [that] it’s all within
yourself.

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.520
Try to merge your stillness within you.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.520
If you don’t allow it you will get supraconscious
which is very dangerous.

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.520
Better now?

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.520
Just keep to your source of peace.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.810
Sit down, sit down for one minute.

00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:14.640
That’s the trouble!

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.440
Let her sit down, Linda.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.850
Can’t you make her sit for a while?

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:20.850
Sit down straight!

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:21.850
Make your children understand.

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:22.850
They will never sit.

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:23.850
Sit still within yourself.

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:24.850
Sit down still within yourself.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:25.850
Just sit still.

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:26.850
It’s all inside you.

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:33.560
You know, you don’t have to go anywhere,
create anything, it’s all within.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.140
Nothing is to be created.

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.210
It’s all within you.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:37.210
Better?

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:38.210
Sit still.

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:39.210
“Be still, my mind."

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:45.640
This stillness business, to establish, is
what I want you to establish within you.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.570
That’s an escape.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:54.830
All perversions are escapes.

00:43:54.830 --> 00:44:09.270
And I am quite happy with your progress, I
must say.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:17.670
This time, it was a very good collectivity,
which was good.

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:20.830
Everybody is coming up very well.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.510
Everybody, I must say, has progressed well.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.790
Every one of you has improved a lot.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:32.450
But try to know where is the problem.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.460
Everybody has individual problems.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:40.930
At a point you stop it.

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:44.230
Just stop it.

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:47.540
You can.

00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:52.490
It’s all bhoots.

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:53.490
You know.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:54.490
Perversions come through bhoots.

00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:55.490
I mean, there is nothing to be explained any
more.

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:56.490
Anything, any diversion, any, I should say,
bending away from Sahaja Yoga or from the

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:57.490
centre.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:58.490
Be in the centre.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:59.490
And don’t pay attention to others.

00:44:59.490 --> 00:45:01.830
Pay attention to yourself.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:06.560
Every one of you is great.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.960
Nobody is greater or less greater.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.410
So just don’t worry about anybody.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.120
Don’t talk too much about Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.120
In India you be peaceful.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.000
There’s a lot of time for you to discuss
it in your own countries.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.140
Just here be quiet.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.140
Take it.

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.140
Take it.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.140
Take it.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:25.930
There is a bird in India, it’s called as
‘chakwa’ and ‘chakwi’, and they are

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:30.440
the ones who just live on the rays of the
moon, and they go on sucking the rays slowly.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.910
They don’t need anything; that’s all.

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:32.910
Still your mind.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:36.400
Whatever mantra we say, if it is mechanical
it will have no effect.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:41.660
We say, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu shanti rupena
samsthita."

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:42.820
Say nicely.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:43.990
Still it.

00:45:43.990 --> 00:45:49.940
But you must do it with complete understanding,
full deliberation.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:56.470
We have come here to gain something, tremendous
depth.

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:07.200
And some of you are at the end of your trip.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.620
Better?

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.470
Yogini: (Unclear)

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:16.860
Shri Mataji: Got a Centre Heart [catch]?

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:23.660
Do not force it, the Kundalini is working
it out.

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.660
Just be still!

00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.660
You are futuristic.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:26.660
Still thinking about (??).

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:27.660
Don’t be futuristic.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.660
At this moment.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:29.660
Be there.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.660
I know what your mind is working on.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:31.660
Don’t be.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:32.660
Just don’t think I am sitting before you,
that’s all.

00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:33.660
Don’t think of time or anything.

00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.660
Just be still.

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.660
Just be still.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:36.660
Still thinking.

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:37.660
Keep your eyes open.

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.660
Don’t think.

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:39.660
You watch me!

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.660
As you are the foundations still your minds.

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.660
The cement is working it out but still it
should be.

00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:42.660
Just by stilling you can get over all your
diseases.

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:43.660
Just by stilling your mind.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.660
Seen that?

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.660
Better?

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.660
Just see in your head.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:47.660
Better!

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:48.660
Also, I think, another way to put your Mooladhara
alright is to see how long you can remain

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.660
without blinking.

00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:50.660
Better?

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:51.660
Put your hand.

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:52.660
Lift it.

00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:53.660
Again.

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:54.660
Try it.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.660
You practice it; again and again.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.660
Now just ask, “Mother, take us deep into
our stillness."

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:57.660
Don’t close your eyes.

00:46:57.660 --> 00:46:58.660
You need not say loudly, just say it in your
heart.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:59.660
At Sahasrara.

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:00.660
Still at Sahasrara.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.660
Can you imagine?

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:02.660
This talking leads you to nowhere else but
to your Sahasrara.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:03.660
Just see your Sahasrara.

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.660
How clear it is?

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:05.660
Can you feel it?

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:06.660
It’s like a stone.

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:07.660
Just see yours.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:08.660
I mean it is your own Sahasrara.

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:09.660
Don’t worry about others, worry just about
your own Sahasrara.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.660
See?

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:11.660
It’s like a stone.

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:12.660
Can you follow?

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.660
So, surrender.

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:14.660
Just in your heart, surrender.

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:15.660
Surrender.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.660
Put me down there – your Sahasrara will
open.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:17.660
The great journey.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.660
Forget about everything else.

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:19.660
Just do that.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:20.660
Better.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:21.660
Sahasrara better now?

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.660
Alright?

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:23.660
You are my children.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:24.660
You are my sons and daughters – alright?

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:25.660
Better now?

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:26.660
See on your Sahasrara.

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:27.660
Mother, You are God.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:28.660
“Make us like Shri Ganesh."

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:29.660
Hmm.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.660
Opening up.

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:31.660
Opening up.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.660
Something’s happening?

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:33.660
Come up.

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.660
Let it come up.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.660
Also some of you unnecessarily worry about
me.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.660
Better worry about yourself!

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.660
Also that’s another escape.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:38.660
So it’s like Himalayas, one has to [be].

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:39.660
Raise your Kundalini!

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.660
Just do it slowly, slowly.

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.660
Higher, put it higher, very much higher.

00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:42.660
Do it properly.

00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.660
With full attention.

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.660
Not in a small way.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.660
Push it back.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.660
The whole hand, up there.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:47.660
Again.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:48.660
With all your earnest attention.

00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:49.660
In a knot, three times.

00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:50.660
One, two…

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.660
Things should be done fully and properly,
not half way.

00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:52.660
I have seen the way people give bandhan, the
way people raise their Kundalini.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:53.660
It’s not the way!

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:54.660
Do it properly.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.660
You are saints!

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:56.660
You are archbishops of saints.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:57.660
You are the foundations of all the saints
that have to come.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:47:58.660
Have we all the powers of those prophets?

00:47:58.660 --> 00:47:59.660
Ask a question.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:00.660
Know you are not that.

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:11.540
Are we are really Realised Souls, Mother?

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:18.462
Are we the epitome of human civilisation?

00:48:18.462 --> 00:48:19.462
Are we the epitome of God’s creation?

00:48:19.462 --> 00:48:20.462
Alright?

00:48:20.462 --> 00:48:21.462
Good.

00:48:21.462 --> 00:48:22.462
Much better now.

00:48:22.462 --> 00:48:23.462
Also don’t turn your heads too much or turn
your eyes too much.

00:48:23.462 --> 00:48:24.462
Keep them still.

00:48:24.462 --> 00:48:25.462
Try to keep them still.

00:48:25.462 --> 00:48:26.462
Just be still, relaxed.

00:48:26.462 --> 00:48:27.462
Now, I would suggest that all of you should
ask each other to give a proper aarti to your

00:48:27.462 --> 00:48:28.462
Mahaganesha.

00:48:28.462 --> 00:48:29.462
Alright?

00:48:29.462 --> 00:48:30.462
So your Ganesha will be awakened.

00:48:30.462 --> 00:48:31.462
All of you should give a aarti.

00:48:31.462 --> 00:48:32.462
Every one of you should ask somebody else
to do it.

00:48:32.462 --> 00:48:33.462
And you will be amazed how nice you will feel.

00:48:33.462 --> 00:48:34.462
And that will relieve, relieve the thing – Mahaganesha.

00:48:34.462 --> 00:48:35.462
That’s the quality you have to achieve.

00:48:35.462 --> 00:48:36.462
It’s not easy, you must know.

00:48:36.462 --> 00:48:37.462
Whenever I touch the point I find a big, huge
mountain on the head.

00:48:37.462 --> 00:48:38.462
Gradually you must face it.

00:48:38.462 --> 00:48:39.462
Take it out.

00:48:39.462 --> 00:48:40.462
Clear it out.

00:48:40.462 --> 00:48:41.462
Slowly and steadily.

00:48:41.462 --> 00:48:42.462
Better now?

00:48:42.462 --> 00:48:43.462
Much better.

00:48:43.462 --> 00:48:44.462
This mountain has to be cleared out.

00:48:44.462 --> 00:48:45.462
Clear it out.

00:48:45.462 --> 00:48:46.462
I think you better give bandhan to yourselves.

00:48:46.462 --> 00:48:47.462
I am giving a bandhan to myself so that everybody
gets a bandhan.

00:48:47.462 --> 00:48:48.462
Alright.

00:48:48.462 --> 00:48:49.462
Done?

00:48:49.462 --> 00:48:50.462
Better?

00:48:50.462 --> 00:48:51.462
Cleansing?

00:48:51.462 --> 00:48:52.462
Got to learn all these mechanisms.

00:48:52.462 --> 00:48:53.462
Alright?

00:48:53.462 --> 00:48:54.462
How many times you give bandhan to yourself,
in a daytime?

00:48:54.462 --> 00:48:55.462
At least five times.

00:48:55.462 --> 00:48:56.462
Make five namazes.

00:48:56.462 --> 00:48:57.462
Seven times is the best way.

00:48:57.462 --> 00:48:58.462
See how much you are clearing out yourself?

00:48:58.462 --> 00:48:59.462
We have to give ourselves a bandhan as well
as we can give it to other.

00:48:59.462 --> 00:49:00.462
Let’s use it for ourselves sometimes, our
powers.

00:49:00.462 --> 00:49:01.462
Hmm?

00:49:01.462 --> 00:49:02.462
She has cleared it out, can you see that?

00:49:02.462 --> 00:49:03.462
All your sickness, all your illness.

00:49:03.462 --> 00:49:04.462
Better?

00:49:04.462 --> 00:49:05.462
Everyone, everyone.

00:49:05.462 --> 00:49:06.462
Let’s give bandhan.

00:49:06.462 --> 00:49:07.462
Phil, give your bandhan to yourself.

00:49:07.462 --> 00:49:08.462
Yourself.

00:49:08.462 --> 00:49:09.462
Now left Nabhi.

00:49:09.462 --> 00:49:10.462
Now you are clearing out, just see that.

00:49:10.462 --> 00:49:11.462
You would like to do it because you feel so
clear!

00:49:11.462 --> 00:49:12.462
Hmm!

00:49:12.462 --> 00:49:13.462
All this back side is opening.

00:49:13.462 --> 00:49:14.462
Alright?

00:49:14.462 --> 00:49:15.462
You’ve never tried like this?

00:49:15.462 --> 00:49:16.462
First time?

00:49:16.462 --> 00:49:17.462
A hundred and eight times it’s the best
way, sometimes.

00:49:17.462 --> 00:49:18.462
Haaa!

00:49:18.462 --> 00:49:19.462
See?

00:49:19.462 --> 00:49:20.462
Leave it, She’ll clear it out.

00:49:20.462 --> 00:49:21.462
Are you are feeling better?

00:49:21.462 --> 00:49:22.462
Aren’t you?

00:49:22.462 --> 00:49:23.462
I thought you have already tried this.

00:49:23.462 --> 00:49:24.462
Never?

00:49:24.462 --> 00:49:25.462
It’s like telling you how to eat!

00:49:25.462 --> 00:49:26.462
That’s the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:26.462 --> 00:49:27.462
Yogi: Really?

00:49:27.462 --> 00:49:33.160
Shri Mataji: Better?

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:48.210
You’ll remove all your heat.

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:57.250
Look at that!

00:49:57.250 --> 00:50:01.970
You all thought we should never take out our
own problems like this?

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:03.190
Heat from the left.

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:04.190
Good.

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:05.190
You may do it whenever you feel like.

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.190
It’s so enjoyable you’ll go on doing it.

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:07.190
You’ll like that! (laughing)

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:08.190
It’s so relieving, you know!

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.190
Instead of clearing others, better clear yourself!

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.190
Others are cleared automatically.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:11.190
Just try.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:12.190
Go on doing it.

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:13.190
Left Swadishthana.

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:17.830
In the samashti (समष्टि – collective)
you see.

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:18.830
Somebody has left Swadishthana?

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:19.830
Linda, why aren’t you doing it?

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:20.830
Do it properly, with proper care.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:21.830
Hmm.

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:22.830
The whole head is improving.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:23.830
Can you believe it?

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:24.830
That you never knew this.

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:25.830
This is protection from yourself to yourself.

00:50:25.830 --> 00:50:26.830
Good.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:27.830
Still Left Swadishthana.

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:28.830
Give it a bandhan to Left Swadishthana.

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:29.830
Right Vishuddhi now.

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:30.830
Right Vishuddhi.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:31.830
Right Vishuddhi.

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:32.830
Left Swadishthana, Right Vishuddhi.

00:50:32.830 --> 00:50:33.830
Baap re baap!

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:34.830
(Oh my God!).

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:35.830
Most dangerous combination.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:36.830
Aha!

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:37.830
Right Vishuddhi burning.

00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:38.830
Burning right Vishuddhi.

00:50:38.830 --> 00:50:39.830
Better.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:40.830
Alright?

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:41.830
Now, leave it to me.

00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:42.830
Everybody is enjoying now.

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:43.830
Do at every finger!

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:44.830
Good.

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:45.830
Much better.

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:46.830
Rub this finger.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:47.830
Right Vishuddhi.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:48.830
Talk too much.

00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:49.830
Right Vishuddhi!

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:50.830
English don’t talk much, I think.

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:51.830
It’s a good quality; good quality.

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:52.830
As long as they don’t sulk and blame themselves.

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:53.830
It’s a good quality.

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:54.830
Try to listen.

00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:55.830
Haaa! better?

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:56.830
Now the Right Side has started flowing.

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:57.830
Little tricks here and there!

00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:58.830
Good.

00:50:58.830 --> 00:50:59.830
Yogi: Mother, You’re like driving your chariot
and we are all your horses.

00:50:59.830 --> 00:51:00.830
Shri Mataji: You see, to drive My chariot
I must have at least horses which do not cough!

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:01.830
(laughter) Otherwise I’ll be getting all
the jerks.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:02.830
Already I have had enough of it!

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:03.830
We have to be smooth.

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:04.830
Very good.

00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:05.830
Better.

00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:06.830
Much better.

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:07.830
Ekadasha also.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:08.830
Little bit.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:09.830
Rub it off.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:10.830
Ekadasha.

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:11.830
Rub it hard.

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:12.830
It’s good.

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:13.830
Better?

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:14.830
Much better.

00:51:14.830 --> 00:51:15.830
So preparations for tomorrow’s [puja].

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:16.830
Always rub your hands!

00:51:16.830 --> 00:51:17.830
Conditioning goes out.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:18.830
Rub your left hand.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:19.830
Now, now Devi prasanna bhave.(Goddess is pleased)

00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:20.830
Alright?

00:51:20.830 --> 00:51:21.830
Good now.

00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:22.830
Alright?

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:23.830
So this is you have done your own puja and
tomorrow your Mother’s puja.

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:23.835
May God bless you all.
