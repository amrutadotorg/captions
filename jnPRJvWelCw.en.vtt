00:07:37.865 --> 00:07:53.094
Last night was a night of complete darkness,
that they call it as amavasya; and just now

00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:58.575
only the first phase of the moon has started.

00:07:58.575 --> 00:08:13.635
Today we are here to celebrate the day when
the Sahastrara was opened out.

00:08:13.635 --> 00:08:18.714
Also you have seen in the photograph.

00:08:18.714 --> 00:08:27.515
It was actually a photograph of my brain,
which showed how the Sahastrara was opened

00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:28.565
out.

00:08:28.565 --> 00:08:33.545
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:38.084
It’s something great these modern times
have done.

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:44.015
So the modern times have brought a lot of
things which can prove the existence of the

00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:46.005
Divine.

00:08:46.005 --> 00:08:53.565
Also it can prove about me.

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:59.165
It can convince you what I am.

00:08:59.165 --> 00:09:10.535
This is very important because, in the modern
times, this advent has to be recognised, has

00:09:10.535 --> 00:09:11.865
to be fully recognised.

00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:17.375
This is one of the conditions for all the
Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:27.425
Now let’s see what’s happening in the
modern times, in the brains of the people.

00:09:27.425 --> 00:09:37.535
In the brains of the people today, if you
see, there is an attack on the Sahastrara.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:45.175
There has been an attack since long but in
the modern times it’s the worst time.

00:09:45.175 --> 00:09:59.425
They are trying to make the limbic area very
insensitive.

00:09:59.425 --> 00:10:17.945
Very depressive novels, very depressive thoughts
and very depressive music, you can say, like

00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:20.055
Greek tragedy nonsense.

00:10:20.055 --> 00:10:39.094
All these things came from the medieval period
till, we should say, this new age has started.

00:10:39.094 --> 00:10:43.965
That one itself was no good for our limbic
area.

00:10:43.965 --> 00:10:47.234
That made us very depressive.

00:10:47.234 --> 00:11:00.525
We took to alcoholism to escape from the so-called
miseries.

00:11:00.525 --> 00:11:15.055
But then came this modern age in which people
became overactive – over-activity started.

00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:23.415
With that the brain also became overactive.

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:32.975
In addition to the dullness before, it’s
gone to the other extreme of over-activity.

00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:43.934
So to dull it again they took to drugs, they
took to very horrible music.

00:11:43.934 --> 00:11:51.995
That’s how they made this limbic area very,
very insensitive.

00:11:51.995 --> 00:12:04.585
So a drug which was just a stimulus to begin
with was to be taken in greater quantity and

00:12:04.585 --> 00:12:13.884
later on they had to take the drugs which
were of a much more severe nature.

00:12:13.884 --> 00:12:20.485
It went on like that and now we know that
this drug is the only way people think they

00:12:20.485 --> 00:12:23.645
can survive.

00:12:23.645 --> 00:12:26.384
Why?

00:12:26.384 --> 00:12:28.624
Because of the tension [that] they talk of.

00:12:28.624 --> 00:12:32.765
In the modern times we have something called
‘tensions’.

00:12:32.765 --> 00:12:34.335
It was never there before.

00:12:34.335 --> 00:12:36.615
People never talked of their tensions.

00:12:36.615 --> 00:12:39.655
Now every body says, “I’m in a tension!”

00:12:39.655 --> 00:12:41.855
“You give me a tension!”

00:12:41.855 --> 00:12:44.415
What is this tension?

00:12:44.415 --> 00:12:48.875
It’s because of my advent.

00:12:48.875 --> 00:12:57.414
The limbic area wants to know about me.

00:12:57.414 --> 00:13:06.896
And the Kundalini also, as Sahaja Yoga is
increasing, is trying to rise in people; because

00:13:06.896 --> 00:13:09.134
you become the channels.

00:13:09.134 --> 00:13:22.905
Wherever you go, you generate vibrations,
and these vibrations give a challenge to the

00:13:22.905 --> 00:13:29.914
Kundalini, or a message, and in various people
it rises.

00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:36.134
It may not rise up to the Sahastrara, or it
may even rise up to Sahastrara but it falls

00:13:36.134 --> 00:13:39.914
back, because there’s no recognition.

00:13:39.914 --> 00:13:46.884
So every time they do something, this Kundalini
comes up and gives them a pressure, because

00:13:46.884 --> 00:13:52.624
their Sahastrara is not open.

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.064
It’s a closed door.

00:13:54.064 --> 00:14:00.474
Because of the closed door this gives them
a kind of a pressure in the head, which they

00:14:00.474 --> 00:14:05.145
don’t understand, and they call it as ‘tension’.

00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:12.795
Actually the Kundalini is trying to push it
out, itself, but it cannot.

00:14:12.795 --> 00:14:21.434
And those also who get their Realisation,
if they do not make their Sahastrara alright,

00:14:21.434 --> 00:14:24.944
they go on getting into tensions.

00:14:24.944 --> 00:14:40.094
So, though Sahastrara has been opened out
so many years back, still we have some things

00:14:40.094 --> 00:14:45.925
to be done – is to clear out our Sahastrara,
first of all.

00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:57.515
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara,
then once it opened out, the brahmarandhra

00:14:57.515 --> 00:15:15.275
opened out, then we started feeling the grace,
and it moved onto our Ida and Pingala – the

00:15:15.275 --> 00:15:19.634
grace not the Kundalini.

00:15:19.634 --> 00:15:29.184
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round,
soothed down our Left and Right sides by which

00:15:29.184 --> 00:15:38.414
our chakras opened more, and more threads
of the Kundalini started piercing through.

00:15:38.414 --> 00:15:45.535
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s
important that you must meditate.

00:15:45.535 --> 00:15:52.594
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras
will be alright because, as you know, that

00:15:52.594 --> 00:16:00.355
the peethas, or the controlling centres of
all these chakras, are in the brain around

00:16:00.355 --> 00:16:03.275
the limbic area.

00:16:03.275 --> 00:16:13.195
So if your Sahastrara is clear everything
works out in a very different way.

00:16:13.195 --> 00:16:19.935
How to keep the Sahastrara alright, is the
big problem [which] always people ask me.

00:16:19.935 --> 00:16:22.485
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

00:16:22.485 --> 00:16:30.055
I have incarnated on the lotus of one thousand
petals.

00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:36.134
That’s why I could break it also.

00:16:36.134 --> 00:16:39.695
As I am today, as you see me.

00:16:39.695 --> 00:16:44.465
Of course they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya”
(सहस्त्रारे महामाया)

00:16:44.465 --> 00:16:54.584
So this is the illusion which is all the time
there for you, which is very elusive.

00:16:54.584 --> 00:17:02.074
It had to be that way because you could not
have faced me otherwise with all the lights

00:17:02.074 --> 00:17:13.655
coming out of me or the way you saw yesterday
Sahastrara – some sort of abstract colours

00:17:13.655 --> 00:17:16.825
thrown on all sides and the lights thrown
outside.

00:17:16.825 --> 00:17:21.995
Please don’t take photographs when I’m
speaking, alright?

00:17:21.995 --> 00:17:22.995
You can take later on.

00:17:22.995 --> 00:17:23.995
There’s no hurry about.

00:17:23.995 --> 00:17:26.465
Just pay attention to My lecture.

00:17:26.465 --> 00:17:28.865
Please, pay attention.

00:17:28.865 --> 00:17:30.465
It’s important.

00:17:30.465 --> 00:17:37.325
It is to be, this, told beforehand, that nobody
should take photographs during puja because

00:17:37.325 --> 00:17:41.935
it is a very intense thing [that] one has
to work it out.

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:44.035
Please, pay attention.

00:17:44.035 --> 00:17:48.215
Even if you don’t understand, it has effect
on you.

00:17:48.215 --> 00:17:57.995
So I would request you to pay full attention
to me when I am talking.

00:17:57.995 --> 00:18:00.195
It works better.

00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:08.084
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after
by you.

00:18:08.084 --> 00:18:13.555
It’s the temple of your Mother.

00:18:13.555 --> 00:18:18.315
When you say you put me in the heart, actually
you put me in the Sahastrara.

00:18:18.315 --> 00:18:23.644
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here
(Shri Mataji touches her brahmarandhra) is

00:18:23.644 --> 00:18:31.475
the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha,
the centre, which controls the heart, which

00:18:31.475 --> 00:18:41.625
is the seat of the Sadashiva or you can say
of Shiva.

00:18:41.625 --> 00:18:46.865
So when you put me in the heart actually you
put me there.

00:18:46.865 --> 00:18:54.584
So to raise it from heart to there, or to
bring it from there to the heart, is the problem

00:18:54.584 --> 00:19:01.975
of two types of people.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:10.834
Some people who are sensitive in their heart
– I would say in Europe we can say Italians

00:19:10.834 --> 00:19:14.536
are very sensitive on their heart – the
first thing they do as soon as they see me

00:19:14.536 --> 00:19:22.305
they put their hands to their heart.

00:19:22.305 --> 00:19:31.065
And that is what it is, that, if you try to
feel me in your heart, to begin with, it’s

00:19:31.065 --> 00:19:32.965
much easier.

00:19:32.965 --> 00:19:36.125
To feel me in your heart.

00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:47.824
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

00:19:47.824 --> 00:19:54.835
You have to love me as I love you.

00:19:54.835 --> 00:20:03.665
You have to love each one of yourselves, because
you are all within me.

00:20:03.665 --> 00:20:09.454
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

00:20:09.454 --> 00:20:10.824
Love is within.

00:20:10.824 --> 00:20:19.105
And love manifests if, just, you open your
heart.

00:20:19.105 --> 00:20:25.774
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

00:20:25.774 --> 00:20:28.965
Firstly, the conditioning.

00:20:28.965 --> 00:20:36.514
In the West to express your love is regarded
as sinful actually.

00:20:36.514 --> 00:20:42.355
It takes them time to say, “I love you,”
but “I hate you!” even a child could go

00:20:42.355 --> 00:20:44.225
on saying, “I hate you!

00:20:44.225 --> 00:20:45.345
I hate you!

00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:46.475
I hate you!”

00:20:46.475 --> 00:20:48.425
But to hate someone is sinful.

00:20:48.425 --> 00:20:53.634
To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

00:20:53.634 --> 00:20:54.634
So to say that, “I hate you!

00:20:54.634 --> 00:21:02.725
I hate you!” is a sinful act.

00:21:02.725 --> 00:21:14.334
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on
saying, “I love you."

00:21:14.334 --> 00:21:23.265
After all, you must love a person who is so
dear to you.

00:21:23.265 --> 00:21:32.625
Anyone who has done something good for you,
you love that person.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:39.905
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you
the rebirth, it should be the easiest thing

00:21:39.905 --> 00:21:44.975
to love.

00:21:44.975 --> 00:21:54.225
And if She says that, “They are all within
my body,” so it should be even easier to

00:21:54.225 --> 00:21:57.115
love each other.

00:21:57.115 --> 00:22:10.415
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is
done through this love, this love which is

00:22:10.415 --> 00:22:23.735
not conditioned, which is not inhibited, which
doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want

00:22:23.735 --> 00:22:28.045
any return – nirvaaj.

00:22:28.045 --> 00:22:33.444
But the conditionings are too much.

00:22:33.444 --> 00:22:41.764
First the problem of conditioning comes to
you when you think that, “This condition

00:22:41.764 --> 00:22:53.435
makes me hate someone,” or, “I cannot
love someone because this is the condition!”

00:22:53.435 --> 00:23:04.475
But actually the conditioning itself is so
absurd, if you see it one by one.

00:23:04.475 --> 00:23:15.925
To make it simple, I would like you to understand
the conditioning part where I read once an

00:23:15.925 --> 00:23:21.144
article, an interesting one, “Who killed
the romance?”

00:23:21.144 --> 00:23:23.865
So he said “the hairdressers”.

00:23:23.865 --> 00:23:30.274
I was wondering how is he connecting romance
with the hairdressers?

00:23:30.274 --> 00:23:38.855
Because people used to go to a hairdresser
and one hairdressing was liked by a person.

00:23:38.855 --> 00:23:42.925
So he would say that, “I love that hairdressing!”

00:23:42.925 --> 00:23:51.144
Now supposing his fiancée, or his wife wore
another type of hairdressing, because everyday

00:23:51.144 --> 00:23:59.445
new things are coming, then immediately the
husband would say, “Oh I hate you because

00:23:59.445 --> 00:24:03.645
of your hairdressing!”

00:24:03.645 --> 00:24:07.975
Because he loves one type of hair dress, that’s
why he loves.

00:24:07.975 --> 00:24:10.395
Otherwise if you have another hair dress you
hate it!

00:24:10.395 --> 00:24:13.225
“I don’t like it!”

00:24:13.225 --> 00:24:20.845
To say that “I don’t like it” and “I
like it”, itself, is a sign that the conditioning

00:24:20.845 --> 00:24:25.465
is too much.

00:24:25.465 --> 00:24:31.115
You make a proper hair dress and you dress
up properly and you come out and then suddenly

00:24:31.115 --> 00:24:35.965
people say, ”Oh I hate it!”

00:24:35.965 --> 00:24:37.225
Who are you?

00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:41.194
What right we have got to say that to anyone?

00:24:41.194 --> 00:24:48.535
You are not a judge appointed by any law courts.

00:24:48.535 --> 00:24:57.745
So why do we say, to hurt someone, to say
“I hate it”?

00:24:57.745 --> 00:25:03.725
On the contrary you must say that, “Alright,
I like this but you could do better."

00:25:03.725 --> 00:25:12.265
That’s the sign of love when you want a
person to be dressed up in a way that is appealing.

00:25:12.265 --> 00:25:21.585
But this is on a very, very baser level that
we see people.

00:25:21.585 --> 00:25:32.284
Then we go further to see a person: how intelligent
he is, how smart he is, how charismatic he

00:25:32.284 --> 00:25:41.255
is, how charming – that’s another word
which is very elusive.

00:25:41.255 --> 00:25:46.775
These are also kind of conditionings of the
mind that you think that a particular style

00:25:46.775 --> 00:25:56.924
of a person is a loveable person, that you
love that person.

00:25:56.924 --> 00:26:00.715
It’s so much outside.

00:26:00.715 --> 00:26:05.554
Or some people actually do not love but show
they love because somebody has more money.

00:26:05.554 --> 00:26:11.085
And the money, he’s not going to part with,
no doubt, but you love that person because

00:26:11.085 --> 00:26:20.135
he has more money, or he has a better car
or he’s better dressed, whatever it is.

00:26:20.135 --> 00:26:29.515
So this kind of an idea one has also is a
killer of love.

00:26:29.515 --> 00:26:36.174
If love is killed, the joy is lost, you cannot
have joy without love.

00:26:36.174 --> 00:26:44.895
I say, joy and love, both are just the same.

00:26:44.895 --> 00:26:49.304
Then it gets even subtler and subtler and
subtler.

00:26:49.304 --> 00:26:56.455
Then we start loving our own children, that’s
very common.

00:26:56.455 --> 00:27:02.674
I mean, of course, also some people don’t
even love their children, I mean there are

00:27:02.674 --> 00:27:05.894
all kinds, you see.

00:27:05.894 --> 00:27:10.635
But then they go on, “This is my child,
this is my child, this is my child!”

00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:21.885
That again is the death of love.

00:27:21.885 --> 00:27:28.304
As I told you before: the sap of the tree
rises, goes to every fruit, goes to every

00:27:28.304 --> 00:27:31.595
leaf, goes to every part and comes back.

00:27:31.595 --> 00:27:33.065
It’s not attached.

00:27:33.065 --> 00:27:42.285
If you are attached to one part or to one
flower because it is more beautiful then the

00:27:42.285 --> 00:27:47.105
tree will die and the flower will also die.

00:27:47.105 --> 00:27:52.424
So that’s the death of the love.

00:27:52.424 --> 00:28:00.325
So you have to have love which doesn’t get
entangled or attached.

00:28:00.325 --> 00:28:01.845
Every time I tell like this they say, “How
to do it?”

00:28:01.845 --> 00:28:09.404
The love of the Spirit is of that kind.

00:28:09.404 --> 00:28:16.154
Love of conditioned mind is different.

00:28:16.154 --> 00:28:25.485
A conditioned mind can love in a limited way
because it is conditioned.

00:28:25.485 --> 00:28:35.745
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within
us, which is like a balloon on top of our

00:28:35.745 --> 00:28:36.745
head.

00:28:36.745 --> 00:28:43.174
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

00:28:43.174 --> 00:28:50.985
The conditioning of course, like they see
a carpet.

00:28:50.985 --> 00:28:56.575
Now it is, according to their conditioning,
is not good.

00:28:56.575 --> 00:28:59.915
So they say, “Oh what a carpet it is!”

00:28:59.915 --> 00:29:00.915
Or something.

00:29:00.915 --> 00:29:06.585
This kind of conditioning of very low level.

00:29:06.585 --> 00:29:11.255
And the higher level at the most, is that
you love your own country, so “My country

00:29:11.255 --> 00:29:12.255
is the best!”

00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:19.534
Whether it is killing people, whether it is
destroying the world peace, it’s all right

00:29:19.534 --> 00:29:22.245
because “I belong to a particular country
which is the best!”

00:29:22.245 --> 00:29:26.825
We can never criticise our country and countrymen.

00:29:26.825 --> 00:29:31.325
It goes on subtler and subtler.

00:29:31.325 --> 00:29:35.885
But on the intelligence side it is even worse!

00:29:35.885 --> 00:29:43.435
Because intelligently if you have understood
that something is good then nobody can save

00:29:43.435 --> 00:29:46.345
you!

00:29:46.345 --> 00:29:49.115
Because through your brain you have understood.

00:29:49.115 --> 00:29:58.125
Actually it is very surprising: I was reading
the book written by Rabindranath Tagore and

00:29:58.125 --> 00:30:08.935
an Englishman had given a very beautiful preface
to that, an introduction, and he said that

00:30:08.935 --> 00:30:14.315
the creativity is killed in the West.

00:30:14.315 --> 00:30:20.495
So he asked a gentleman who was an Indian
critic.

00:30:20.495 --> 00:30:23.305
He said, “Don’t you criticise your poets?

00:30:23.305 --> 00:30:27.205
You don’t have people who are critics?”

00:30:27.205 --> 00:30:33.335
“Yes, yes we have, they criticise,” “So
what do they criticise?”

00:30:33.335 --> 00:30:41.544
“Oh, they can criticise that, this time
there was no rain so we had problems and things."

00:30:41.544 --> 00:30:44.554
He said: “No, no, no, no!

00:30:44.554 --> 00:30:49.955
We are thinking about the poet, do they criticise
the poet, do they criticise an artist?”

00:30:49.955 --> 00:30:55.155
So he says: “Is it meant for criticism?”

00:30:55.155 --> 00:31:01.625
“It is created, whatever he felt is created.

00:31:01.625 --> 00:31:08.005
But supposing he has put something very vulgar
then of course we don’t like it.

00:31:08.005 --> 00:31:12.105
But if it is created by a beautiful mind,
it has to be beautiful."

00:31:12.105 --> 00:31:14.345
“Then you don’t criticise?”

00:31:14.345 --> 00:31:18.404
He says, “No, because we cannot create like
that.

00:31:18.404 --> 00:31:26.975
So what business have you got to criticise?”

00:31:26.975 --> 00:31:32.615
This is how, ‘intelligently’, what we
have done: we have norms about everything,

00:31:32.615 --> 00:31:34.845
about art about every creation.

00:31:34.845 --> 00:31:36.615
We don’t like this carpet.

00:31:36.615 --> 00:31:37.615
Why?

00:31:37.615 --> 00:31:45.235
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual
understanding of the norms we have reached

00:31:45.235 --> 00:31:49.465
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we
don’t like it.

00:31:49.465 --> 00:31:56.535
Can you even create one inch of that?

00:31:56.535 --> 00:32:00.445
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

00:32:00.445 --> 00:32:05.485
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta (नधिकार
चेष्टा).

00:32:05.485 --> 00:32:06.485
Un-authorised.

00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:10.755
You have no authority to criticise.

00:32:10.755 --> 00:32:18.185
You can’t do anything, so why should you
criticise?

00:32:18.185 --> 00:32:24.105
Better [to] appreciate and see for yourself
that you are not in authority, you are not

00:32:24.105 --> 00:32:28.404
worthy of it, to criticise.

00:32:28.404 --> 00:32:34.225
If you are not worthy of it why should you
criticise anything?

00:32:34.225 --> 00:32:43.644
And, otherwise also, you must know [that]
you are a slave of your ego.

00:32:43.644 --> 00:32:49.565
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence,
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to

00:32:49.565 --> 00:32:51.424
a point, to have some norm.

00:32:51.424 --> 00:32:57.294
And then it becomes a collective ego of a
particular community, of a particular country,

00:32:57.294 --> 00:32:59.465
of a particular ideology.

00:32:59.465 --> 00:33:00.845
It’s collective.

00:33:00.845 --> 00:33:10.294
So then they say, “Oh we think this is no
art!”

00:33:10.294 --> 00:33:18.154
That is the reason we cannot have masters
any more in art.

00:33:18.154 --> 00:33:21.914
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

00:33:21.914 --> 00:33:25.985
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered
a lot.

00:33:25.985 --> 00:33:28.554
You know Gauguin suffered a lot.

00:33:28.554 --> 00:33:30.675
All these artists suffered a lot.

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:33.414
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

00:33:33.414 --> 00:33:40.005
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily,
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

00:33:40.005 --> 00:33:41.534
So I think people have given up.

00:33:41.534 --> 00:33:46.345
I met an artist who had done lots of art work
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

00:33:46.345 --> 00:33:48.605
He said, “No I don’t want to show you.

00:33:48.605 --> 00:33:49.605
It’s created for myself."

00:33:49.605 --> 00:33:52.195
I said, “I would like to see!”

00:33:52.195 --> 00:33:57.225
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I
said, “Why don’t you show?”

00:33:57.225 --> 00:33:58.705
He said, “No use.

00:33:58.705 --> 00:33:59.705
People will just criticise.

00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:01.955
I do it for my own pleasure.

00:34:01.955 --> 00:34:10.664
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

00:34:10.664 --> 00:34:16.385
So one of the basic things we should avoid
is to criticise others.

00:34:16.385 --> 00:34:21.235
Better to criticise yourself.

00:34:21.235 --> 00:34:27.524
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers
and sisters, criticise your country, criticise

00:34:27.524 --> 00:34:34.965
all the habits you have and laugh at yourself,
is the best way.

00:34:34.965 --> 00:34:43.545
If you know how to laugh at yourself then
you will not object or will not stand in the

00:34:43.545 --> 00:34:47.034
way of any creativity of another person.

00:34:47.034 --> 00:34:51.745
So with ego you become so unauthorised.

00:34:51.745 --> 00:34:53.554
You can criticise anything.

00:34:53.554 --> 00:34:58.745
You think you have a right.

00:34:58.745 --> 00:35:01.135
Who has given you this right to criticise?

00:35:01.135 --> 00:35:04.705
Is the question one should ask to oneself.

00:35:04.705 --> 00:35:12.225
How can we criticise anyone?

00:35:12.225 --> 00:35:21.465
As saints, as you are now, of course, you
can make out who is caught up, who has given

00:35:21.465 --> 00:35:25.335
bad vibrations, who has the problem.

00:35:25.335 --> 00:35:27.005
You know that.

00:35:27.005 --> 00:35:28.675
You know it.

00:35:28.675 --> 00:35:30.345
It’s not conditioning.

00:35:30.345 --> 00:35:36.825
It’s not just you are doing because there’s
some ego, but you are feeling it on you fingertips.

00:35:36.825 --> 00:35:40.794
It’s an actual feeling within you.

00:35:40.794 --> 00:35:44.445
It’s the bodha (बोध: knowledge), by
which you know.

00:35:44.445 --> 00:35:48.395
Then what should you do?

00:35:48.395 --> 00:35:53.185
In your love, you have to tell the person,
if possible, that, “This is wrong with you.

00:35:53.185 --> 00:35:54.534
Better be corrected!”

00:35:54.534 --> 00:35:57.804
But in a way that he does it.

00:35:57.804 --> 00:36:01.554
On the contrary, if you tell him in a way
that he becomes even worse than what it is,

00:36:01.554 --> 00:36:04.385
you have not loved that person at all.

00:36:04.385 --> 00:36:07.065
Allow everybody to grow.

00:36:07.065 --> 00:36:21.294
There are many people in Sahaja Yoga who are
very, very good, excellent, no doubt.

00:36:21.294 --> 00:36:25.804
But also there are some people whom we can
call as very difficult; very!

00:36:25.804 --> 00:36:33.445
There’s sort of a crack in their head or
something, that part is missing sometimes.

00:36:33.445 --> 00:36:36.054
Some screws are loose I think.

00:36:36.054 --> 00:36:38.105
Sometimes they behave like clowns.

00:36:38.105 --> 00:36:40.185
And we have known some people.

00:36:40.185 --> 00:36:43.154
We just can’t help them.

00:36:43.154 --> 00:36:49.654
They could be very intelligent otherwise,
they could be very sharp otherwise, but in

00:36:49.654 --> 00:37:01.585
Sahaja Yoga they cannot come down to that
level where you can say: now the growth is

00:37:01.585 --> 00:37:04.005
possible.

00:37:04.005 --> 00:37:08.894
Supposing the Mother Earth was very hot like
the Sun, there would have been no growth.

00:37:08.894 --> 00:37:15.145
Or [if] it was cold like Moon, there would
have been no growth.

00:37:15.145 --> 00:37:24.054
It had to come to the centre where it had
both the things in proper proportions to grow.

00:37:24.054 --> 00:37:35.294
In the same way, a human being has to work
out that you keep a moderation and a balance,

00:37:35.294 --> 00:37:43.485
and understand not to go to extremes of anything.

00:37:43.485 --> 00:37:50.215
That balance you learn when you love someone.

00:37:50.215 --> 00:37:57.005
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, we have to ask
some people to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:57.005 --> 00:38:07.554
This is out of love for them, because once
they go out, they improve, I have seen, they

00:38:07.554 --> 00:38:11.784
tremendously improve.

00:38:11.784 --> 00:38:19.885
But when they are inside the Sahaj Yog community
they become a nuisance, and they want to be

00:38:19.885 --> 00:38:24.495
more nuisance because their ego plays the
part, maybe the conditioning plays the part,

00:38:24.495 --> 00:38:27.164
whatever it is, they want to be a nuisance.

00:38:27.164 --> 00:38:31.804
So we have to ask them that, “Please now,
depart for a while."

00:38:31.804 --> 00:38:37.784
Now if that nuisance value is lost in a person
then he has to be straightforward.

00:38:37.784 --> 00:38:50.535
He cannot be any more a nuisance and logically
it can appeal to a person, if you tell that

00:38:50.535 --> 00:38:56.554
person, that this is the reason why we want
you to be out.

00:38:56.554 --> 00:39:02.395
But they can be very disgustingly troublesome,
I know that.

00:39:02.395 --> 00:39:10.705
But you have to show complete patience and
complete understanding and you must talk like

00:39:10.705 --> 00:39:13.304
a person who loves.

00:39:13.304 --> 00:39:25.595
Love has such a power that nobody wants to
do something that will suggest that they don’t

00:39:25.595 --> 00:39:29.215
love; very powerful thing it is.

00:39:29.215 --> 00:39:35.445
It binds people in such a beautiful manner
that one wants to do something: for example

00:39:35.445 --> 00:39:38.264
you want to give me flowers, because you know
I love flowers.

00:39:38.264 --> 00:39:43.405
So you want to give me flower to suggest that,
“Mother we love you,” Just to suggest.

00:39:43.405 --> 00:39:51.014
I know you love me but you just want to, sort
of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

00:39:51.014 --> 00:39:57.685
So you want to give me a flower to show your
love and expression of your inner feeling

00:39:57.685 --> 00:40:01.424
for me.

00:40:01.424 --> 00:40:06.264
So all these material things can be used to
express your love.

00:40:06.264 --> 00:40:13.735
They can be very easily expressed in such
a manner that another person knows what is

00:40:13.735 --> 00:40:14.735
love.

00:40:14.735 --> 00:40:19.225
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

00:40:19.225 --> 00:40:33.095
So, if you see that, this brain has to love;
brain has to love.

00:40:33.095 --> 00:40:41.585
After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga,
through your brain and intelligence, if you

00:40:41.585 --> 00:40:48.164
reach a point where you understand that: No,
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing

00:40:48.164 --> 00:40:49.875
all these things.

00:40:49.875 --> 00:40:51.255
It’s just love.

00:40:51.255 --> 00:40:53.095
It’s simple love.

00:40:53.095 --> 00:40:59.725
So the same Sahastrara which has been used
before, this brain, for analysing, for criticising,

00:40:59.725 --> 00:41:06.255
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
now wants to love and enjoy the love.

00:41:06.255 --> 00:41:12.784
And there is the culmination where the brain
just loves.

00:41:12.784 --> 00:41:16.125
That is the situation one has to reach.

00:41:16.125 --> 00:41:17.554
It just loves.

00:41:17.554 --> 00:41:20.664
It knows only love because it has seen the
power of love.

00:41:20.664 --> 00:41:26.245
You reach a certain logical conclusion, and
then you see the point.

00:41:26.245 --> 00:41:32.755
Like Adi Shankara wrote so many things like
Vivekachudamani, this, that, and all those

00:41:32.755 --> 00:41:35.625
treaties, and then he gives up, he said, “No,
nothing!”

00:41:35.625 --> 00:41:44.235
He just writes the praise of the Mother – finished!

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:49.965
So once you reach that point, we can say now
you are in nirvikalpa because there is no

00:41:49.965 --> 00:41:53.875
vikalpa, there is no doubt in your head; because
you love.

00:41:53.875 --> 00:41:55.425
In love you don’t doubt, no question.

00:41:55.425 --> 00:41:57.145
Only when you think you doubt.

00:41:57.145 --> 00:42:03.845
But when you love you don’t doubt, you just
love, because you enjoy love.

00:42:03.845 --> 00:42:08.555
And that’s why love is joy and joy is love.

00:42:08.555 --> 00:42:14.365
So after so many days the Sahastrara has been
opened out.

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:22.085
We have to open out our Sahastrara again:
through our meditative processes, through

00:42:22.085 --> 00:42:24.895
understanding ourselves and others.

00:42:24.895 --> 00:42:29.895
Maybe logically reaching that point: there’s
no way out now.

00:42:29.895 --> 00:42:32.645
We have reached to the end of it now.

00:42:32.645 --> 00:42:34.565
The whole logic has ended up now.

00:42:34.565 --> 00:42:38.675
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

00:42:38.675 --> 00:42:44.125
Once you jump into the ocean of love there’s
nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every

00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:53.515
wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of
it.

00:42:53.515 --> 00:43:05.745
That is what one has to learn by reasoning
that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.
