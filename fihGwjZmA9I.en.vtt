WEBVTT

03:38.425 --> 03:41.765
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

03:45.325 --> 03:48.385
Yesterday I told you what is the truth

03:49.685 --> 03:52.665
and that is what we are seeking today.

03:53.065 --> 03:56.065
In all our seeking

03:59.165 --> 04:05.905
we may run after the mirage of money,

04:06.925 --> 04:13.185
of power, of friendship, of

04:14.165 --> 04:21.745
carnal love but ultimately we have to know, that we are running after

04:22.605 --> 04:28.445
the truth that is the Spirit.

04:31.905 --> 04:39.685
Yesterday I explained to you how the truth manifests itself

04:40.625 --> 04:48.685
through your finger-tips and you can find out about any disease or any trouble

04:49.905 --> 04:57.185
that is within you and without. Only thing you have to know how to work it out.

05:02.505 --> 05:08.345
When the realization takes place, we have to know

05:10.105 --> 05:15.625
that a complete integration within take place.

05:17.565 --> 05:25.905
That is your physical, emotional, mental and spiritual being

05:27.045 --> 05:32.985
become completely integrated. For example,

05:35.245 --> 05:41.545
you think, you should start some sort of a work.

05:44.125 --> 05:48.785
That is what your mind tells you but

05:50.445 --> 05:55.105
your heart tells you, "No, no, no, we should not do it."

05:56.445 --> 06:01.025
Then physical being says, "No, no, no, you're very tired, how can you do it?"

06:03.425 --> 06:08.945
And the spiritual being can say that, "I just don't know what is to be done."

06:12.445 --> 06:15.845
But when you get your realization,

06:17.205 --> 06:22.685
you become very intense, very positive

06:23.625 --> 06:29.925
and concentrate your mind very clearly on what is to be done.

06:32.665 --> 06:38.585
Supposing, you have been doing something very wrong all your life

06:41.285 --> 06:45.365
and you had no courage to get out of it,

06:47.245 --> 06:54.205
after realization you become very powerful personality within yourself

06:55.965 --> 07:00.385
and then you do exactly what you have to do

07:01.285 --> 07:09.225
which is physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually absolutely integrated and is correct.

07:09.845 --> 07:16.045
So naturally, you become a very righteous person, very righteous person.

07:16.885 --> 07:22.645
The whole value system changes. Today the value system for people

07:23.285 --> 07:30.125
orients, maybe, from money, from power, from some sort of a

07:30.725 --> 07:38.345
human consideration. A person may think that, I should do

07:40.605 --> 07:47.105
this thing because by doing this I'll get lot of money - maybe it's little cheating, doesn't matter.

07:48.745 --> 07:53.725
Maybe, he would like to do something just to gain

07:57.485 --> 08:03.445
some sort of a power over other. He may dominate some people

08:04.285 --> 08:09.285
or he may bear some domination because he has to.

08:10.825 --> 08:17.765
But after realization you get that power of Absoluteness.

08:20.685 --> 08:27.545
For example, Christ, when He saw Marie Magdalene   being stoned,

08:28.445 --> 08:34.365
He stood before her. Now, Christ

08:34.725 --> 08:40.645
was an Incarnation of Truth and He had nothing to do with the prostitute,

08:41.825 --> 08:49.305
has no relationship with her, whatsoever. But He stood before her and asked the people,

08:49.545 --> 08:55.285
"Those who have not committed any sin, can throw stones at Me."

08:58.805 --> 09:05.825
Such courage and such understanding of righteous behavior

09:06.585 --> 09:10.725
just starts shining in your character.

09:12.245 --> 09:17.185
Then, you understand what is good in every religion.

09:18.705 --> 09:24.965
When you start reading Bible after realization, you understand

09:26.265 --> 09:29.985
where it has gone wrong.

09:32.025 --> 09:37.445
If you have read Khalil Gibran - he's a very great realized soul -

09:38.385 --> 09:42.865
and he says about Paul, very clearly,

09:43.605 --> 09:49.785
"This Paul is a very strange man. I don't know what he's about to say.

09:50.385 --> 09:56.225
He says something, believes in something, has no relationship with Christ."

09:57.985 --> 10:05.485
A person like Khalil Gibran could say that, otherwise to say something against Bible,

10:06.505 --> 10:11.785
was absolutely prohibited. He was thrown out of church, he didn't care.

10:12.605 --> 10:15.725
I say the same thing about Paul.

10:16.625 --> 10:21.425
Paul has no place in Bible. He should not have been there at all.

10:22.865 --> 10:26.745
He was the one, who killed so many people.

10:27.745 --> 10:33.905
There was a little boy of seventeen years whom he tortured and then he thought

10:34.245 --> 10:39.645
this is the best way to gain more power to become somebody great

10:41.485 --> 10:47.925
in the Christian community. So he took over and he started writing,

10:48.545 --> 10:54.225
organizing. He's in the Bible - he has never seen Christ.

10:56.145 --> 11:02.905
All his writings suggest that he was mad with

11:03.925 --> 11:09.865
ideas of his own and he put all these ideas on people.

11:11.685 --> 11:18.805
This Paul has created such problems today that Christians are having a big problem solving

11:19.565 --> 11:27.105
the contradictions made by him. You must be have heard about the Bishop of Durham,

11:27.625 --> 11:34.165
saying that Paul was correct and there was no Immaculate Conception.

11:34.685 --> 11:41.165
It takes courage to say that Christ's birth was an Immaculate Conception and it was,

11:41.865 --> 11:46.585
no doubt. Verily, He was the Son of God.

11:48.405 --> 11:52.725
But to say that, you have to have that courage.

11:53.785 --> 11:59.225
This Bishop of Durham, just to get some more power, maybe,

11:59.425 --> 12:04.065
or maybe to get some more Christians converted,

12:05.565 --> 12:10.145
he must have started this kind of a new ideas.

12:10.865 --> 12:17.345
So many have been condemning Christ by this kind of authorities.

12:18.145 --> 12:24.285
And then when he was very much anointed and

12:26.485 --> 12:31.765
given honor by Archbishop of Canterbury,

12:33.245 --> 12:39.205
that church was burnt. They couldn't explain

12:40.025 --> 12:45.245
why the church was burnt and people saw

12:46.865 --> 12:52.785
the lightning looming over that church for hours together -

12:53.805 --> 12:56.785
it was a miraculous thing that happened.

12:57.665 --> 13:05.085
But to people like Bishop of Durham or Archbishop, it was

13:05.605 --> 13:11.785
the Grace of God that the lower part, the floor was not burnt, of the church.

13:15.605 --> 13:19.685
Same way you find in Christianity,

13:20.605 --> 13:25.065
as you have in Hinduism, the same thing.

13:27.905 --> 13:33.745
They said that there was a big problem in the Parliament

13:34.685 --> 13:40.525
when the Shankaracharya stood up and said that it is

13:41.465 --> 13:48.525
a right of a every Hindu to be Brahmin or a non-Brahmin, is written in the Gita.

13:51.825 --> 13:56.105
And a Member of Parliament came  to Me and asked Me, "Mother, what's the answer to this?"

13:56.885 --> 14:02.945
I said Shankaracharya should know that Gita was written by Vyasa

14:03.245 --> 14:07.945
and Vyasa was a illegitimate child of a fisher-woman.

14:09.285 --> 14:13.325
How could he write that a Brahmin is born?

14:14.525 --> 14:21.985
The caste system, that is the curse of our country, has come from these so called priests, the brahmins.

14:22.445 --> 14:27.805
They are not Brahmins because those who are born again, those who know the Brahma,

14:28.125 --> 14:32.665
those who have felt the All-Pervading power of God, are the Brahma.

14:33.345 --> 14:40.165
Least said about the Islam, then the Sikhs, then all these religions you can find

14:40.505 --> 14:46.705
that there is so much of twisting of the words

14:46.965 --> 14:50.385
just to suit their own purses and their minds.

14:51.585 --> 14:59.525
You get over all that and you become powerful to say that it's all wrong - that's not where we have to be.

15:01.665 --> 15:05.345
Now, so many things are coming out of Vatican

15:05.645 --> 15:10.765
but the Catholics will close their ears - they would not like to listen to all that what is happening.

15:11.265 --> 15:15.925
Everybody will be exposed, who are doing falsehood.

15:16.125 --> 15:21.705
The time has come, the judgment time has come - all such people have to  be exposed.

15:23.385 --> 15:30.385
But the simple people, who love Christ, who love Krishna,

15:31.285 --> 15:36.185
who loved righteousness, will be saved.

15:39.145 --> 15:45.245
After realization people also get lots of dynamic

15:45.405 --> 15:49.265
forces within themselves which they never expected to get.

15:50.005 --> 15:56.525
First of all, their innocence is awake.

15:59.065 --> 16:04.785
Whatever innocence they have lost through the stupidity of the society

16:05.445 --> 16:11.585
or the ideas given by the uh, uh.. enterprising

16:13.445 --> 16:19.945
film industries or other, we can say, magazines and all kinds of publications -

16:20.945 --> 16:28.985
all those things drop out. All the conditionings of the mind drop out and he becomes innocent,

16:29.625 --> 16:36.985
a innocent personality. An innocent personality is a very, very powerful personality.

16:37.485 --> 16:41.565
As Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

16:41.845 --> 16:46.525
Such a person has a glint in the eye of innocence

16:46.885 --> 16:53.385
and such person can grow up to such a level that even a little glance of such a person

16:53.625 --> 16:56.825
can save people from calamities.

16:58.665 --> 17:03.165
The purity of mind, purity of character,

17:04.045 --> 17:08.025
all these starts shining in such a personality.

17:09.065 --> 17:14.245
And such a personality is an auspicious figure.

17:14.825 --> 17:18.145
Auspiciousness, we have forgotten about.

17:18.765 --> 17:23.145
If an auspicious person enters into the house -

17:23.685 --> 17:30.865
if somebody's sick that person gets all right, if there's quarrel in the house the quarrel subsides,

17:31.365 --> 17:38.005
if there's any problem that problem is solved. An auspicious person travelling by a train,

17:39.245 --> 17:42.525
if there's an accident, nobody dies.

17:43.525 --> 17:47.545
Auspicious person is the person who is

17:47.865 --> 17:53.385
constructive and is releasing constructive forces all around him

17:54.985 --> 18:00.925
of very soothing, peaceful and a very powerful character.

18:02.325 --> 18:08.705
Such an auspicious personality is to be found in so many realized souls.

18:10.205 --> 18:18.305
Now the other day, one lady was telling Me that there are many realized souls walking about on this earth - I haven't seen any.

18:20.725 --> 18:24.885
They might grow their beard, they might wear some sort of a wig,

18:25.145 --> 18:29.505
they might wear some sort of a dress - that doesn't mean they're realized souls.

18:29.985 --> 18:35.105
Actually, a realized soul doesn't need to publish or to uh..exhibit

18:35.305 --> 18:39.265
in any way artificial that he's a realized soul.

18:40.045 --> 18:47.245
He could be a very ordinary person on the street or he could be a king. He could be

18:47.485 --> 18:55.205
a, a person just cleaning the hall here and he could be a Prime Minister.

18:57.445 --> 19:04.265
For such a personality all these things do not matter, whether he lives in comfort,

19:05.125 --> 19:10.025
he doesn't feel the feeling of comfort, I should say.

19:10.825 --> 19:15.025
Whether he lives in complete poverty, he doesn't feel it.

19:15.865 --> 19:20.225
According to the pattern of his life, .

19:20.445 --> 19:24.565
according to the status of his life, he lives.

19:25.665 --> 19:30.185
Supposing he's born in a poor family, he lives like a poor man.

19:31.005 --> 19:34.525
If he's born in a rich family, he lives like a rich man.

19:34.925 --> 19:40.725
It is not necessary for a rich man to show off uh..that I'm a poor man

19:42.265 --> 19:45.625
because riches do not touch him.

19:46.925 --> 19:51.525
They have to be there because he has got it.

19:52.165 --> 19:55.225
But such a person is extremely generous.

19:55.485 --> 20:02.465
If he finds that somebody needs the money, he'll give but if he finds that somebody doesn't need the money, he will not give

20:02.685 --> 20:06.625
and sometimes people are surprised - they think he's miserly.

20:07.225 --> 20:11.865
Because the sense of discretion is tremendous in an innocent person.

20:13.925 --> 20:17.605
He develops that sense of discretion so spontaneously -

20:17.985 --> 20:24.545
as soon as he sees the person, he knows how far to go with that person and how to deal with that person.

20:25.765 --> 20:28.925
He doesn't have to ask any questions.

20:31.585 --> 20:38.705
One day some sahaja yogies came to Me in Poona and started telling Me

20:38.945 --> 20:43.565
about one person that, "Mother, he's a politician, you be very careful with him

20:43.765 --> 20:49.905
and You, when You're dealing with him, You have to be very much uh.. on Your guard."

20:50.125 --> 20:55.745
I said that's all you have come to tell Me all of you. They said, "That's all." I said now you sit down and I'll tell you.

20:56.125 --> 21:03.745
I said, I know, this man has eloped with somebody else's wife and this is an illegitimate child he has

21:03.925 --> 21:10.085
and he's this and he's that, he's that and they were all shocked how Mother came to know about it.

21:14.445 --> 21:18.685
So there is no need to put any guard - you are guarded all the time.

21:19.405 --> 21:25.645
The blessings of protection, are all the time with a person, who is a realized soul.

21:26.105 --> 21:32.465
That's why he's not bothered. He's least bothered about uh..insurances,

21:34.145 --> 21:41.345
he's least bothered about money, he's least bothered about getting elected -

21:45.965 --> 21:50.205
he lives in his own world of reality.

21:54.045 --> 21:58.965
Such a person may suddenly become dynamically artistic -

21:59.925 --> 22:03.385
he may not have known art at all.

22:05.005 --> 22:10.685
I met one gentleman who came to sahaja yoga, who had lost his job, he had no money, nothing with him,

22:11.005 --> 22:18.905
so he said, "Mother, I have no money, what am I to do?" I said don't you worry, you take your realization. He got his realization.

22:20.145 --> 22:28.145
I said why don't you try interior decoration. He said, "What, I don't know timber, I don't know the quality anything, [UNCLEAR- KNOW?] what to do it."

22:28.465 --> 22:35.145
I said you just see vibrations and work it out. And you'll be amazed, he's now a very good

22:35.685 --> 22:40.225
interior decorator - he's making good money out of it.

22:43.165 --> 22:48.685
So many things like that happen to that person. Suddenly, you get your realization,

22:50.345 --> 22:56.245
you start making poems, poetry - that can happen to anyone of you.

22:56.985 --> 23:02.185
But these are still, I would say, are temptations - you should not get lost with it.

23:02.765 --> 23:08.765
Some people can get lots of money, just after realization - it's a temptation.

23:10.145 --> 23:17.645
Suddenly from somewhere, you might get money but, I would say, it's a temptation - you have to go ahead with it.

23:18.985 --> 23:22.465
Some people might get a big position suddenly,

23:23.065 --> 23:30.865
they may land up as something very uh.. great leaders -

23:32.225 --> 23:39.585
that's also, I think, is a temptation and one should not forget that this is all the Grace of God.

23:42.265 --> 23:47.565
The people, who are suffering from diseases, get cured. You saw yesterday, how two persons,

23:47.785 --> 23:53.265
within five minutes, got cured of such horrible diseases - they would have been dead.

23:57.845 --> 24:03.365
But those who get realization, also get protection from diseases.

24:03.965 --> 24:08.745
Say, a person suffering from A.I.D.S., will get protection.

24:10.365 --> 24:13.345
He may not go to the second stage.

24:14.505 --> 24:18.725
He might live all his life with the first stage, maybe, he might get get cured completely.

24:20.345 --> 24:28.265
There can be lots of physical benefits he can have. His health will improve, he'll drop down, at least, 10 to 20 years

24:29.745 --> 24:34.945
and he can do lots of work without getting tired.

24:36.085 --> 24:43.305
Because you don't feel you're doing any work. Most of the headache is because we think we're doing the work.

24:44.285 --> 24:47.485
If we can stop thinking that we're doing any work,

24:49.405 --> 24:54.465
we are not tired. You just do the work, that's all, we don't think about it.

24:54.865 --> 25:00.945
In England, I find, everybody is [SHRI MATAJI EXHALES - HA]. 'What's the matter?' "I'm tired."

25:01.565 --> 25:06.285
'What have you done?' "Little cooking, that's all." Because you're thinking you're cooking -

25:06.465 --> 25:10.925
the cooking was spoilt because of that and now you're tired. [SHRI MATAJI EXHALES - HA]

25:14.185 --> 25:22.185
But the people who are realized souls, do not think about it. Now for example, there's a beautiful carpet here.

25:23.845 --> 25:29.945
This doesn't belong to Me - thank God - and I'm looking at it.

25:31.765 --> 25:39.005
When I look at it, I just see the beauty, the joy that is put in it

25:39.485 --> 25:44.905
by the artist - I don't think, I just look at it, I witness it.

25:45.665 --> 25:50.005
I just don't think and the joy that has created this

25:50.565 --> 25:56.265
completely starts pouring into Me, relieving Me completely.

25:58.985 --> 26:01.965
To possess something is a headache.

26:03.165 --> 26:08.665
You possess, say, this carpet, then you must insure it,

26:08.925 --> 26:12.385
would be worried - I hope it's not getting dirty or this and that.

26:15.205 --> 26:21.625
To possess some personality, somebody as a husband or a wife, is another, the greater headache

26:22.425 --> 26:27.445
because all the time you're trying to possess, other person is trying to run away.

26:29.465 --> 26:37.045
But you stand on your own legs - not to be possessed by anyone nor do you possess anyone.

26:38.745 --> 26:42.125
You stand in your own glory, enjoying yourself.

26:43.265 --> 26:49.345
You're not bothered as to who is your husband and that you should possess him.

26:49.545 --> 26:54.445
"All right, if it's my husband, all right, I can enjoy his company all right.

26:54.805 --> 27:01.705
But if he doesn't want to enjoy my company, I'm not going to fall at his feet. Let him go ahead.

27:05.905 --> 27:10.165
Makes no difference to me to my life."

27:10.405 --> 27:15.905
And you'll be surprised, all such people become very good husband and wives -

27:16.125 --> 27:19.085
not only that but very good parents.

27:19.405 --> 27:26.585
We have seen now, in sahaja yoga, so many people are married - they're very happily married people and they have beautiful children too.

27:27.085 --> 27:31.185
Then you become very good parents because you understand your children

27:31.405 --> 27:36.205
if they're born realized or not, if they have problems then how to correct the problems,

27:36.465 --> 27:40.545
how to treat them - you just don't go to doctors for every small little thing.

27:44.985 --> 27:51.685
This has been already prophecized long, long time back, thousands of years back, in India

27:52.545 --> 27:58.125
by a very uh.. old astrologer called Bhrigu.

27:59.265 --> 28:02.845
He's the one who has written Bhrigu samhita,

28:03.105 --> 28:08.865
which is actually, we should say, he's the one who started astrology.

28:11.085 --> 28:17.865
He has written that such and such time will come when the Kundalini will rise very easily

28:18.085 --> 28:22.085
and there will be no need to have any hospitals.

28:24.165 --> 28:31.165
Is already being described but we do not read anything but something sensational,

28:32.385 --> 28:35.365
something nonsensical.

28:36.125 --> 28:41.805
Now, people want to read something sensational, perhaps, we have become the matter.

28:42.245 --> 28:47.905
When we have become the matter, nothing can stir us but some sort of a shock.

28:48.525 --> 28:56.625
And that's why, we go about for this kind of literature which is shocking, which we call as sensational.

28:58.745 --> 29:03.785
A person who is a realized soul, his whole value system changes thoroughly.

29:04.285 --> 29:11.545
and his whole being becomes such a deep personality that he understands what is

29:12.145 --> 29:19.085
stupid, what is idiotic, what is wasteful and what is nourishing.

29:21.525 --> 29:27.345
As if in his brain a new light has come to judge what is good for him.

29:31.225 --> 29:36.005
Then such a person, suddenly develops, beautiful voice.

29:37.625 --> 29:41.125
He becomes very compassionate, kind.

29:42.305 --> 29:49.965
I've seen people who have been all the time abusing each other suddenly become very sweet to each other -

29:50.505 --> 29:57.125
they give up abusing. They use very gentle, beautiful words.

29:57.765 --> 30:04.585
They do things to please each other, they try to find out how to make others happy

30:07.045 --> 30:12.825
Their little, little ways are so sweet.

30:13.285 --> 30:16.265
I cannot relate all of them to you

30:18.705 --> 30:25.445
but their one incident I'll tell you that will make you understand

30:25.625 --> 30:30.465
how these people understand how to make you happy.

30:32.845 --> 30:39.745
Like we have between ourselves a custom called a rakhi

30:40.565 --> 30:47.305
in which a brother is to be chosen and you have to tie a, a little

30:47.525 --> 30:51.225
thread on the wrist of that person.

30:53.505 --> 30:59.045
We don't have this kind of a system in the West, Western societies.

31:00.465 --> 31:07.645
But when Alexander invaded our country, he was married to an Indian lady

31:09.305 --> 31:14.705
and as luck would have it, unfortunately, once he lost his battle

31:15.385 --> 31:20.505
and he was taken into prison and taken uh..

31:21.585 --> 31:28.505
into a dungeon, I should say, and made him stay there. This king called Puru

31:29.165 --> 31:35.425
wanted that somehow Alexander should not proceed any further in India to destroy it.

31:39.105 --> 31:44.305
Now, that was the day of this rakhi, full moon.

31:44.905 --> 31:47.905
His wife was a clever Indian lady

31:48.785 --> 31:55.265
so she sent a, that thread in one plate covered with a cloth - that's how we send it -

31:56.325 --> 32:02.765
to the king and the king asked, "All right, tie that to me."

32:03.305 --> 32:08.545
When they tied it, he said, "Who is my sister, who has sent for me?"

32:09.245 --> 32:12.345
They said, "It is Alexander's wife."

32:13.265 --> 32:19.945
"She has sent it to me, I've become her brother, Oh God!" He ran to the dungeon,

32:20.425 --> 32:28.085
he fell at the feet of Alexander, he said, "Sir, I'm sorry. Uh.. whatever I've done, please forgive me.

32:28.345 --> 32:34.305
You are welcome." He took him with him and he put him on his throne. He said, "Let me wash your feet,

32:34.605 --> 32:41.205
you are my sister's husband, I've done such a harm to you. God will never forgive me - you have to forgive me."

32:41.465 --> 32:49.425
This Alexander had no idea what had gone wrong with this king - he thought he's gone mad or what, what is he trying to do?

32:50.425 --> 32:58.385
So, then he gave lots of clothes and lots of ornaments for his sister and everything and he sent her back to his house.

33:00.945 --> 33:07.625
When he came home, his wife was smiling, he said, "What is this, this king has gone mad or what?

33:07.865 --> 33:13.805
He has left me alone and now if I conquer, I may win the whole of India."

33:14.605 --> 33:21.725
She said, "What did you do?" She said, "Nothing, I just sent a thread to him today." He said, "Thread,

33:22.325 --> 33:26.425
what was that thread?" She said, "Is a thread from a sister to a brother."

33:26.845 --> 33:33.665
"Oh God," he said, "For a thread he left me out, I'm such a dangerous person."

33:34.045 --> 33:39.265
He said, "These Indians with their symbols and their lives, I cannot manage them.

33:39.485 --> 33:45.425
Imagine, for a thread they leave out such an, such an enemy, like me." He said, "I'm not going to go further."

33:45.745 --> 33:49.385
And then he took a poet Chandravardai from

33:49.585 --> 33:54.285
Delhi and went back and he had tremendous respect for India.

33:56.445 --> 34:01.165
These small, small things, how beautiful they make you!

34:04.465 --> 34:08.965
A little gesture like that can give you such a great

34:09.205 --> 34:14.585
uh..honor and such a great personality.

34:18.725 --> 34:22.985
These things have happened many a times in many places

34:24.705 --> 34:30.485
but we do not see them because we have no eyes just now to see them.

34:32.225 --> 34:37.905
In the same way, in every family there are such sweet, sweet things that happen.

34:39.445 --> 34:46.165
between children, between husband and wife, between in-laws

34:46.725 --> 34:54.745
but we never see them. Because of that we cannot organize our family,

34:55.225 --> 35:01.665
our relationships with neighbors, with all the rest of the people, in a beautiful manner.

35:03.285 --> 35:09.665
Every human-being is very beautifully made - lot of beauty is hidden in him.

35:10.325 --> 35:17.345
Of course in the light of a realized soul, it manifests - people see that very clearly.

35:18.345 --> 35:25.165
All of our beauty is, somehow or the other, shut down because our heart is closed.

35:25.505 --> 35:32.265
We're frightened of another person, we're worried about another person, we cannot trust other persons

35:32.785 --> 35:38.565
but a realized person trusts, trusts everyone and everyone trusts him.

35:39.545 --> 35:46.305
This is a very big thing that can happen to all of you when you're realized - you'll be surprised

35:46.625 --> 35:51.565
how you will have that confidence within your self to trust everyone.

35:57.325 --> 36:03.805
Now, the other things that happen is, I told you, that your eyes become innocent.

36:05.885 --> 36:10.185
Our attention is all the time going from here to there.

36:10.385 --> 36:15.405
This thing you see, then that thing you see, that thing you see, going on seeing this to that, to that to that.

36:15.865 --> 36:23.845
Then you settle down - the attention settles down. Your attention, absolutely, is at peace

36:24.225 --> 36:31.225
and you see something and every small thing you see, you see it deeply.

36:34.045 --> 36:37.365
Many people ask Me, "Mother, how do you remember our names then.

36:37.565 --> 36:43.125
How do You know us and how do You remember our problems?" It's love!

36:45.025 --> 36:49.745
If you love someone, you know everything about that person - don't you?

36:53.405 --> 37:00.785
It's just love. You don't have to keep a diary, you don't have to keep a regular

37:00.985 --> 37:06.125
uh.. sort of reading of whom you know, whom you don't know - it's just love!

37:07.865 --> 37:15.745
Today somebody asked Me from the newspaper uh.. "How many uh.. sahaja yogies You have?" I said, 'I don't know.' Really, I don 't know.

37:17.105 --> 37:25.105
How many there are in this world, I don't know. "How many thousands?" I said, 'I don't know.' But I can make them out anywhere they are.

37:25.885 --> 37:31.605
Wherever they may be - supposing I'm in the vicinity, I meet them immediately - it just happens.

37:33.405 --> 37:37.365
It's very remarkable how a sahaja yogi recognizes another sahaja yogi.

37:37.845 --> 37:43.105
There was a lady who was working in Rome and she happened to go to Sicily.

37:43.765 --> 37:50.565
There's another one from England, she went to Sicily and both were feeling uh.. little lonely because

37:50.825 --> 37:58.565
you see, others were drinking, smoking and abusing and all sorts of things were going on. So the one who was from England

37:59.145 --> 38:04.985
just looked up and saw another one sitting and she said, "Oh God, she's a realized soul!"

38:06.085 --> 38:14.225
So she went to her, so the other one asked her, "Have you got realization from Shri Mataji?" And they just embraced each other.

38:16.245 --> 38:23.885
There's no lust, there's no greed - all these stupid ideas that have come to us

38:24.145 --> 38:29.425
of homosexuality, this and that, these are all, all is lost.

38:31.445 --> 38:34.925
You just love the other person only for love sake.

38:37.105 --> 38:42.685
Pure love that manifests.

38:43.585 --> 38:50.285
You see the whole world as a drama - you witness it; watching everything that's happening.

38:52.165 --> 38:57.265
You're not worried, you're not upset. I'm never upset about the

38:57.605 --> 39:01.885
uh.. airport or going to the aeroplane - nothing of the kind -

39:03.745 --> 39:11.305
because I know the aeroplane has to wait for Me and I reach there, the aeroplane is there.

39:12.845 --> 39:19.565
But I don't try to trouble others by going late but I never hurry anyone, never trouble anyone -

39:20.305 --> 39:26.265
just it's so simple. But people are in such a hurry to do something

39:29.065 --> 39:35.025
because when we're not realized, we're standing in the waves of thought.

39:35.485 --> 39:41.905
Like the water - one wave rises falls off, another wave rises falls off, another wave rises falls off.

39:42.165 --> 39:46.305
We're on the cusp, cusp of every wave of our thoughts.

39:47.885 --> 39:51.625
But there's a little, very little space in between.

39:52.325 --> 39:57.065
One thought comes from the future or from the past goes to the past or past to the future

39:57.865 --> 40:01.065
and we're just dancing on top of those thoughts.

40:02.065 --> 40:07.185
When the Kundalini rises, these thoughts elongate and the space increases,

40:08.905 --> 40:14.025
then you become thoughtlessly aware - you're aware but you're thoughtless.

40:17.985 --> 40:23.425
It's like, you're standing in the water, you're worried of the waves

40:24.865 --> 40:28.165
but supposing you're in the boat, you're enjoying the waves.

40:29.925 --> 40:34.445
You're not worried about the waves any more. You see them, clearly, you see them

40:34.665 --> 40:40.445
rising, falling - you enjoy the waves. You are in a strong boat sitting here to enjoy them.

40:42.105 --> 40:48.125
They know all these skirmishes and all these squabbles of life, do not disturb you.

40:49.425 --> 40:54.405
You're not bothered with these things because there's such a peace

40:55.725 --> 40:58.665
of beautiful existence within yourself.

41:01.665 --> 41:08.045
That is, what I call, thoughtlessly aware but beyond that is doubtlessly aware.

41:10.065 --> 41:17.485
When you practice sahaja yoga, gradually you start seeing so many miracles happening to you, surprisingly so many things happen.

41:19.985 --> 41:24.665
How could it be, how could it have happened!

41:27.925 --> 41:33.305
Even in money, power, anything. You suddenly

41:34.305 --> 41:41.225
faced with something which is unexpected blessings

41:43.565 --> 41:49.925
and you can't believe it - then you know, "Oh, I'm in the Kingdom of God

41:51.185 --> 41:56.065
and it's God who's showering blessings upon me."

41:57.545 --> 42:05.565
Then the doubts fall off and you rise to a higher consciousness as we call it as doubtless awareness.

42:11.085 --> 42:17.385
You have to of course meditate about five minutes in the morning, five minutes in the evening - not much time is needed.

42:18.765 --> 42:25.825
We have watches these days; I think My grandmother never knew what was a watch and My

42:26.265 --> 42:34.145
even Mother never used a watch, perhaps. She, we had a big grandfather's clock in the house, that was sufficient for all of us.

42:36.465 --> 42:43.265
But here everybody has a watch, everybody must save the time, must see the time - save the time for what?

42:45.325 --> 42:48.285
To waste it somewhere.

42:49.185 --> 42:56.185
Like somebody was hurrying up too much, I said, "What's such a hurry?" "Oh God, I must go, that pub will close now."

43:00.425 --> 43:08.485
Where are we spending our time? All this time saving is for meditation,

43:10.105 --> 43:16.525
for spending time in the presence of God, enjoying His blessings,

43:17.665 --> 43:24.225
swimming in the ocean of His Grace and Joy.

43:27.925 --> 43:35.905
We don't realize that all these ideas of saving time and all such things have come to us

43:37.465 --> 43:44.965
because this is the time where you have to really save time to be in the company of God.

43:48.745 --> 43:55.085
The other day a lady asked Me a question about donations, that we give donations

43:55.945 --> 43:59.945
to some people because they're realized souls and all that.

44:01.945 --> 44:06.885
There's no need for donations at all.

44:08.545 --> 44:15.245
So many people, the other day I met, some people belonging to some community,

44:15.765 --> 44:18.825
they're all the time travelling from places to places.

44:20.085 --> 44:25.045
I said, 'Why are you travelling?' "Because we belong to this community, we're realized souls."

44:25.325 --> 44:30.085
Self-certified realized souls going round all the places, enjoying life.

44:31.925 --> 44:37.825
I said, 'Realized souls, why do you certify yourself as realized souls,

44:38.825 --> 44:45.085
how are you realized souls?' If you're realized soul you must be able to give realization to another person -

44:45.325 --> 44:48.305
that's the minimum of minimum.

44:51.645 --> 44:58.625
That's the gift of realization - you should be able to cure others - that's also minimum of minimum.

44:59.605 --> 45:05.825
But you should be able to master all the

45:06.165 --> 45:12.025
sciences and all the Shastras, that is all the Scriptures.

45:17.445 --> 45:25.485
You should be able to answer every type of a person without losing patience.

45:29.245 --> 45:35.885
And that is what one has to be, then I would say, that in sahaja yoga you become a guru.

45:39.385 --> 45:47.005
But such a guru is extremely compassionate, kind, guiding, looking after him.

45:49.725 --> 45:56.425
Every little bit is looked after,

45:58.805 --> 46:04.285
then it's a guru. Mostly the gurus look after your purse

46:05.025 --> 46:12.225
or your wives, maybe, at the most. Is that the way they are gurus?

46:15.105 --> 46:21.305
Their lives are blackened by their ill deeds - they're evil people,

46:21.725 --> 46:28.705
they're devils, some of them, born again to test your intelligence and your understanding.

46:29.905 --> 46:35.125
They may come as priests, they might come as Jews, they might come uh.

46:35.345 --> 46:39.305
as.. Hindus, they may come as anything.

46:42.465 --> 46:46.245
But they're evil doers of the worst type -

46:46.545 --> 46:51.445
not that only they will go to Hell but all disciples of theirs will go to Hell.

46:56.905 --> 47:01.845
But how will you know, how will you know

47:02.785 --> 47:08.045
that such and such a person is bad or good - through your vibrations.

47:09.065 --> 47:12.785
How will you know Christ - through your vibrations.

47:14.305 --> 47:21.325
Everything you can know through your vibrations an absolute correct answers

47:22.765 --> 47:28.225
will be there. Even if you have ten children sitting, tie their eyes

47:28.465 --> 47:34.525
and ask them, "What's wrong with this gentleman?"  They will all raise the same finger, meaning he feels very guilty.

47:40.205 --> 47:44.345
Because you feel it on your Central Nervous System

47:48.305 --> 47:53.345
This is what has to happen to all of you.

47:54.605 --> 48:00.085
After realization, you have to grow. It's like a little sapling

48:01.085 --> 48:07.445
which is to be looked after, which is to be nourished, which is to be grown.

48:07.985 --> 48:16.065
And then you will understand, who are you - you are the Spirit.

48:18.485 --> 48:26.405
Your glory, your beauty, your righteousness, your virtues

48:27.105 --> 48:33.805
everything will manifest. Out of you great people like Abraham Lincoln, will come out.

48:36.785 --> 48:43.285
We have given up hopes of having those great people - they're all going to come out of you.

48:43.545 --> 48:46.565
May God bless you!

48:53.065 --> 48:58.745
Today, as I told you yesterday, there were too many questions.

48:59.785 --> 49:07.585
Some were sensible, some were rather aggressive and some were nonsensical - doesn't matter.

49:08.325 --> 49:15.165
We can give some time to ask few questions today. I think, I should give realization

49:15.545 --> 49:20.685
and establish yesterday's realization and also

49:22.105 --> 49:25.185
give to the new people.

49:47.865 --> 49:55.205
Please ask the questions. You're thoughtlessly aware, most of you - you don't know what to ask?

50:02.865 --> 50:10.265
[INAUDIBLE]

50:11.605 --> 50:16.245
- Where did You get Your knowledge?
- Again, they want to know about Me.

50:16.665 --> 50:21.325
I got it from My very childhood, I was born with it.

50:22.865 --> 50:31.105
Even if I say I got it yesterday, what difference will it make to you, sir? This question has no meaning.

50:57.645 --> 51:05.365
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Please, please stand up and say. Which is the one? All right.

51:05.865 --> 51:13.705
[INAUDIBLE]

51:13.925 --> 51:21.905
[INAUDIBLE]

51:22.125 --> 51:30.085
[INAUDIBLE]

51:30.405 --> 51:37.905
[INAUDIBLE]

51:38.185 --> 51:42.545
[INAUDIBLE]

51:42.725 --> 51:50.725
- The question is, what is the Self-realization and how do you know that you have got it? This is in short.
- Aw, it's too much.
- [INAUDIBLE]

51:51.225 --> 51:58.425
The whole lecture was about it, Sir. Yes, yesterday you were not there?

51:59.005 --> 52:05.965
I'm sorry, you can listen to My lecture, all right. You can take the tape - it explains what is Self-realization.

52:07.225 --> 52:10.965
All right, is very simple to understand.

52:13.345 --> 52:20.165
You'll get it just now, then you will know what it is. Please be seated, thank you.

52:33.005 --> 52:40.725
You must stand up otherwise we don't see you - anybody who has to ask the question. Yes, please.

52:41.885 --> 52:49.745
[INAUDIBLE]

52:49.925 --> 52:57.645
[INAUDIBLE]

52:57.965 --> 53:03.785
Question is, that she was not here yesterday and would it be possible for You to please

53:04.025 --> 53:08.465
explain something about the internal health and knowing that through the fingers?

53:09.185 --> 53:15.265
Ah, internal health, through the fingers? All right.

53:17.945 --> 53:24.945
Of course, tomorrow you're coming for a workshop and in the details they'll be telling you, that I told you this

53:25.165 --> 53:32.645
one, two, three, four, five, six and seven - these are seven centers and on this hand are seven centers.

53:34.285 --> 53:38.805
Now, these seven centers are represented here as you see them.

53:40.305 --> 53:45.365
So, this is the one, is the lowest, lowest one here

53:46.405 --> 53:50.605
then, this is the one which is the second one, yellow one.

53:51.225 --> 53:57.705
Then you have, this is the one which is here at the neck

53:58.085 --> 54:04.725
Vishudhdhi, as they call it. This is the one which is at the naval point.

54:05.105 --> 54:12.945
This is the one, which is on the left-hand side on the back but on the right-hand side in front, where there's the red mark.

54:13.805 --> 54:19.585
And this is the one is the heart. This is the one is the limbic area

54:20.485 --> 54:24.765
or we can say, the seventh chakra, this one.

54:30.085 --> 54:35.365
Now, they're all related physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

54:37.445 --> 54:43.125
Now if you want to see the physical side - now supposing, on your hands

54:44.045 --> 54:50.365
the whole thing cannot be explained in a short time but, I would say, now supposing, in your hand

54:50.585 --> 54:55.025
you are feeling something is burning here

54:55.925 --> 55:01.825
that means there's something wrong here in the throat on the right-hand side, on the physical side.

55:03.165 --> 55:11.265
But supposing this is burning, then it means that you are feeling guilty

55:12.145 --> 55:15.225
and you have developed a weakness here.

55:17.745 --> 55:24.725
It relates, the permutations and combinations are there which will know very easily

55:25.125 --> 55:32.845
and also there are little booklets in which you can read and find out and it's very simple to understand.

55:42.025 --> 55:45.005
Yes, please.

55:49.685 --> 55:54.525
- Your concept of, I'm sorry
- Concept?

55:55.405 --> 56:00.965
- The concept of good health?
- Hell
- Hell, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

56:01.365 --> 56:07.865
- Could You please tell us something about Your concept of Hell?
- Hell? [ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

56:10.085 --> 56:14.105
Ah.. Why should you talk of something  not so good?

56:18.425 --> 56:21.405
Hell has been described by so many people

56:24.485 --> 56:27.605
but you don't feel like talking about it.

56:29.365 --> 56:35.285
There are lectures, I have so many lectures on Hell also

56:35.745 --> 56:42.145
and you can take, you can come and listen to them but, I mean, just now before realization

56:42.365 --> 56:50.065
I don't want to talk of these things because when the mood spoils and then it's not good. So, will you excuse Me.

56:50.605 --> 56:57.005
You can go and listen to My, like I've got at least, I don't know how many thousand lectures I've given,

56:57.225 --> 57:02.585
out of them so many are about Hell - it's not a concept, it's a reality.

57:10.785 --> 57:15.785
Yes, please. Please get up, please. First you get up, then is easy to see you.

57:16.025 --> 57:20.645
Will you please get up, please, you please, yes? Yes, thank you.

57:21.485 --> 57:29.445
I was not here for Your lecture [UNCLEAR - YESTERNIGHT OR YESTERDAY?] but before I get certified

57:29.705 --> 57:37.565
Self-realized, what [UNCLEAR]

57:39.945 --> 57:46.965
The question is said that he was not here yesterday uh.. , "If I get Self-realization in this lifetime,

57:47.205 --> 57:52.165
- in My next lifetime will I have to start all over again?
- No, no, not at all.

57:53.165 --> 58:01.085
Not at all. You'll have free will to be born whenever you like. You'll know all about it,

58:02.025 --> 58:08.685
you'll come with a new fervor - this is never lost. That's something is eternal life.

58:09.085 --> 58:12.505
This is the Eternal life that is never lost.

58:19.745 --> 58:22.845
Is there anybody else, please?

58:27.745 --> 58:34.445
[UNCLEAR]

58:34.705 --> 58:42.145
[INAUDIBLE]

58:42.425 --> 58:48.765
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

58:48.985 --> 58:55.205
Question is said that, "The Self-realization that You intend to give us to-night

58:55.425 --> 59:02.325
which You have also mentioned is like a sapling that has to be nursed - Is there a higher level to be achieved after this?"

59:02.625 --> 59:10.005
Yes. You see Self-realization is, as I said, is a sapling.

59:10.945 --> 59:17.245
It is to be looked after, is to be stationed and then this

59:17.785 --> 59:24.005
when it is embedded properly into your being, it grows into a tree.

59:24.325 --> 59:30.785
Then you can give to others, others can come for support from you.

59:32.145 --> 59:39.205
So, you have to grow up to that point. In some people it doesn't even take one day -

59:39.525 --> 59:43.585
that very same day they are there - very surprising!

59:44.105 --> 59:49.485
But some people do take some time because the Kundalini being the Mother

59:50.225 --> 59:54.145
She gives you realization, the breakthrough all right

59:54.445 --> 59:59.545
but then again She goes back to the places where it requires attention.

01:00:00.025 --> 01:00:07.265
So all these things to be understood. About a month is more than sufficient, I think, for everybody to stand on their own legs.

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:23.025
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:23.285 --> 01:00:30.065
- What is the difference
- Annh?
- What is the difference between Self-realization and God realization.

01:00:30.445 --> 01:00:36.265
Quite a lot, hunh... Self-realization is the beginning of it

01:00:36.805 --> 01:00:40.745
and then the God realization is a stage

01:00:41.025 --> 01:00:46.485
where you develop capacity to control all the elements, everything.

01:00:47.125 --> 01:00:52.165
There's lot of difference, is can be achieved by sahaja yogies also.

01:00:57.165 --> 01:01:05.185
You see for some people, it's quite a long distance but for some people is not.

01:01:06.725 --> 01:01:10.265
It is, it depends on one's own capabilities.

01:01:16.985 --> 01:01:24.985
[UNCLEAR]

01:01:25.245 --> 01:01:33.105
[UNCLEAR]

01:01:33.385 --> 01:01:40.225
[UNCLEAR]

01:01:40.485 --> 01:01:47.645
- Kya?
- Umm, You mentioned that you have to save time, not to waste time

01:01:47.845 --> 01:01:55.625
- and use that time for meditation, so is that the way to spend all our time and is there any [UNCLEAR]
- No, no, no, I told you, you need only five minutes.

01:01:56.045 --> 01:02:01.765
But save time means, you must save time in the sense that

01:02:02.005 --> 01:02:07.065
you should not waste your time in useless things -
which you do not after realization.

01:02:08.765 --> 01:02:14.345
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yes. No I said five minutes morning and five minutes evening.

01:02:14.585 --> 01:02:22.005
Now the gentleman who is standing here, he is the chief executive of a very big factory

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:29.625
or we should say, a very big business in India, and he's the owner of that

01:02:30.065 --> 01:02:36.245
steel but he has found time to come down to see you all.

01:02:40.785 --> 01:02:48.685
- Yes, please.
- [INAUDIBLE]
- On Me
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:48.905 --> 01:02:51.445
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:02:51.645 --> 01:02:59.045
Do You have to understand the process, uh,  do You have to understand the process of Self-realization to actually get it?

01:02:59.345 --> 01:03:07.045
No, not at all. You'll get it without understanding it but you've been asking about it, so I'm telling.

01:03:07.685 --> 01:03:14.085
But later on, if you have to give realizations to others, better know it. It's very simple though

01:03:14.945 --> 01:03:18.205
but realization you can get just like that.

01:03:19.245 --> 01:03:25.245
You need not even know My language - you can get realization.

01:03:30.945 --> 01:03:38.405
I was wondering [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:38.605 --> 01:03:42.945
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:43.165 --> 01:03:46.545
The question is, "How do You awaken the Kundalini?"

01:03:46.885 --> 01:03:51.965
All right, that's something, the, it is a spontaneous thing,

01:03:52.765 --> 01:03:59.845
it just awakens in My presence. It's like the Mother Earth awakening a seed.

01:04:01.725 --> 01:04:09.065
I must be something of course, no doubt. And once you are realized, you can also awaken the Kundalini.

01:04:17.105 --> 01:04:20.425
But spontaneously it will be awakened.

01:04:24.545 --> 01:04:29.165
I, when I was born, I knew My mission, I knew what I had to do

01:04:30.385 --> 01:04:34.985
and that I had to find out a method, en-masse realization.

01:04:35.765 --> 01:04:41.325
And in My own meditative way, I studied human-beings, what are their problems,

01:04:41.825 --> 01:04:49.505
why can't they have enmasse realization. Because any discovery unless and un it is made public,

01:04:49.745 --> 01:04:52.785
available to everyone, has no meaning.

01:04:54.005 --> 01:04:59.825
So many people have been killed, given poisons and tortured

01:05:01.205 --> 01:05:07.865
and the time had come also for Me to do the job and somehow I've managed it.

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:14.865
But you can also give realization to people once you're realized.

01:05:23.505 --> 01:05:26.505
[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:26.885 --> 01:05:33.365
- Can you get up please, also? Ah..
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:33.645 --> 01:05:39.045
- Kya keh rahe?
- I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
- Couldn't hear, I'm sorry, sir.

01:05:42.885 --> 01:05:50.865
- That's better.
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:51.085 --> 01:05:59.005
[INAUDIBLE]

01:05:59.525 --> 01:06:05.005
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:05.285 --> 01:06:10.785
- Kya farma rahe?
- James [INAUDIBLE]
- Did you hear anything James?

01:06:11.025 --> 01:06:18.645
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:18.885 --> 01:06:26.745
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:27.105 --> 01:06:34.165
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:34.485 --> 01:06:41.945
- What time?
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Annh?
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:42.225 --> 01:06:49.165
All the elements, all the elements. These elements, the essence of this elements, you see,

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:54.025
make the chakras, all the elements.

01:06:55.445 --> 01:07:01.665
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Which are the useless ones?
- Umm?
- Which are the useless ones?

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:08.945
- All of them are useful. Hunh!
- Useless
- All the five elements. Yes.

01:07:09.685 --> 01:07:17.725
[INAUDIBLE]

01:07:18.525 --> 01:07:24.145
- What's he saying? Kuch sunai nahin de raha.
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:24.345 --> 01:07:30.305
- Which are the useless elements and which are the useful elements.
- There aren't any. All of them are very useful, sir.

01:07:30.745 --> 01:07:37.565
[UNCLEAR]

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:45.665
- What...
- [UNCLEAR]

01:07:45.965 --> 01:07:52.085
- What's it?
- [UNCLEAR]
- I think he's just making some poem
- Kya keh rahe hain?

01:07:52.285 --> 01:07:56.025
- Annh?
- Just making an observation
- Oh, I see.

01:07:56.245 --> 01:08:03.245
It's just an observation. [ALL CLAP N LAUGH] All right, please be seated. If you don't mind,

01:08:03.445 --> 01:08:11.025
please be seated. You'll find out how the elements are helping to build up our chakras

01:08:11.465 --> 01:08:18.385
and how ultimately the Kundalini passes through them and enlightens those elements within ourselves.

01:08:18.965 --> 01:08:23.605
There is a subtle of every element which makes the chakras,

01:08:23.825 --> 01:08:29.885
all right? These are all questions which will come to your mind, I know, because it's a scientific

01:08:30.085 --> 01:08:36.285
uh.. style is to understand that way. But to be very frank, you see,

01:08:36.465 --> 01:08:40.545
to get your realization you don't have to know all these things.

01:08:41.465 --> 01:08:47.265
First you get your realization. Like say, it is dark there's no light, then

01:08:48.025 --> 01:08:55.165
supposing, you ask Me, how to make out Mr. this from [UNCLEAR - THEM?], I'll say put on the light first.

01:08:56.565 --> 01:09:02.445
And to put on the light you have to just switch on - then you can find out.

01:09:03.465 --> 01:09:06.665
You must have patience with yourself, isn't it?

01:09:07.145 --> 01:09:12.425
All right, you be seated and then you get your realization and then know all about it.

01:09:13.345 --> 01:09:17.545
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What's it?

01:09:17.745 --> 01:09:23.105
- [INAUDIBLE]
- You be seated.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:28.305
You get your realization - it's like getting a light in your hand.

01:09:28.605 --> 01:09:35.445
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:38.445 --> 01:09:45.345
Please be seated. Yes. The enquiry is very good.

01:09:47.065 --> 01:09:50.205
At least people have given a thought to it.

01:09:52.225 --> 01:09:58.565
Once it works out, it would be even better for you to see yourself what it is.

01:09:59.465 --> 01:10:05.585
If doesn't work out, it will work out tomorrow, it will work out day after

01:10:06.065 --> 01:10:12.905
but it must work out first. First you must have entry into that part, that area

01:10:13.445 --> 01:10:17.485
to understand, with a light in your hand.

01:10:19.505 --> 01:10:25.365
You have not yet entered into that area. As I said , this is the knowledge of the roots

01:10:26.465 --> 01:10:30.125
and to go to the roots you have to be a subtler being.

01:10:30.945 --> 01:10:36.305
Once you become that subtler being, then you can move into your roots and find out yourself.

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:45.945
It's not like any knowledge of the tree that you can just see here for yourself.

01:10:46.885 --> 01:10:53.385
You have to become a subtler being and then you start seeing for yourself everything.

01:10:54.025 --> 01:11:00.885
But I'm happy that you have enquiry about it. Now this enquiry is going to help you very much

01:11:01.165 --> 01:11:08.285
to go deep down - is a sign of depth and sign of pure intelligence.

01:11:09.925 --> 01:11:13.045
May God bless you all!

01:11:23.625 --> 01:11:27.625
Now, very simple things are needed to be done

01:11:28.345 --> 01:11:34.145
to understand how to raise your own Kundalini, very simple thing.

01:11:35.725 --> 01:11:40.405
Firstly, as I said, we have to take help from the Mother Earth

01:11:42.145 --> 01:11:49.965
so, you have to take out your shoes because when you touch your Mother Earth with your shoes, She helps a lot

01:11:54.945 --> 01:12:01.445
and touch the Mother Earth with your feet. Now, the experiment is going to be on yourself

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:06.945
[UNCLEAR - WHILE?] you are going to do the experiment yourself.

01:12:08.645 --> 01:12:13.125
I'm just going to tell you the procedure which is extremely simple,

01:12:13.585 --> 01:12:19.025
which you should follow intensely and it will work out.

01:12:20.545 --> 01:12:28.145
The main object is to get Self-realization. All of you should get Self-realization, is the main object.

01:12:29.245 --> 01:12:35.725
Once you get it, then to go further, we'll have the light in our hand.

01:12:41.165 --> 01:12:47.605
You please have your both the hands towards Me, like this.

01:12:50.565 --> 01:12:55.745
This means that the left,

01:12:56.425 --> 01:13:01.325
which is the hand of desire, is towards Me.

01:13:02.365 --> 01:13:10.325
and this is the hand of your action. So we are going to use this hand for the action within.

01:13:10.745 --> 01:13:17.225
How the movement works out of the Kundalini, you yourself will notice, you yourself will certify

01:13:17.425 --> 01:13:21.525
you yourself will see. I'm not going to certify you.

01:13:24.485 --> 01:13:31.185
