00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.640
…on burnt bodies by Sir Archie&nbsp;
McIndoe and his dedicated team.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.360
But now we turn to the subject of inner healing,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.160
meditation and Self-realization.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.680
Just some of the benefits to be&nbsp;
obtained from some forms of yoga.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.120
And at this point, let me welcome&nbsp;
my final guest on the program,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.480
Mataji Nirmala Devi, known as the Holy&nbsp;
Mother of the Sahaja Yoga movement,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.200
and a lady who has a considerable&nbsp;
following of men and women,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.240
in many parts of the world, who believe&nbsp;
they have experienced her healing powers.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.240
Mataji, welcome to the program.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.720
Thank you.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.640
I hope I pronounced you name correctly.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.920
Yes, it was.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.240
Now, I believe that you were&nbsp;
born and brought up in India

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.280
and actually knew Mahatma Gandhi.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.780
Yes.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.120
Can you tell me a little of that?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.440
My father was a freedom fighter,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.920
and Mahatmaji came to live very&nbsp;
near our place where we were.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.160
And from the age of seven years,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.000
I came to know about him.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.520
And he was very fond of Me.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040
He called Me ‘Nepali’

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.920
because he thought my face&nbsp;
was more like a Nepali woman.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.040
Now, we are most of us&nbsp;
familiar with the idea of yoga,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.280
even if we don’t practice it ourselves.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520
It’s said to be a way of achieving peace of mind,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.280
a kind of inner calmness.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.920
But what’s special about your form of yoga?

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.800
Hum. The kind of yoga that&nbsp;
is practiced now in the West,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.480
is just a very wee bit of the real yoga.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.080
That was called as “Patanjali&nbsp;
Yoga”, once upon a time.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.880
And you had to do everything&nbsp;
just to achieve the real yoga,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.080
meaning the union with the Divine.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.400
But it came to be, in the West,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.840
that it is only physical acrobats.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.720
So, I should say that it was&nbsp;
not so good for the yoga people,

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.200
who want to have union with the Spirit.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.880
So you see yoga as affecting the&nbsp;
whole body, the whole person?

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.560
Complete personality of emotions,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.600
and your mind, and your intellect.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.680
Everything has to be integrated.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.600
Achieving a kind of balance.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.680
Complete balance and integration&nbsp;
and mastery over them.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.760
Now, how did you yourself&nbsp;
discover that you had this power?

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.080
I never discovered it. It was there.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.000
As we know we are human beings.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I knew I had those powers, from my very childhood.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.840
It must have been a little bit odd in a sense

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.080
because you were born of Christian parents,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.440
who were also pretty rich.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.920
You didn’t lack for anything as a child.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.320
Do you see your present beliefs and&nbsp;
practices as a rejection of that,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.440
or a reaction to it, or is it an extension to it?

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.480
No, you don’t reject or you&nbsp;
don’t run after anything.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.040
It is: you see, you witness the whole thing.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.640
You are in it and you just witness.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.040
You are absolutely detached.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.240
To Western minds,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.560
it often seems as though there’s&nbsp;
something very mysterious

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.600
about Eastern meditation and contemplation.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.640
Is it something that we in Western&nbsp;
civilizations lack completely?

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.600
I don’t think so,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.800
because Christ was one of the&nbsp;
greatest spiritual prophets

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.160
that could come on this earth,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.800
and you have known Him very well.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.480
But the only thing is we have not&nbsp;
followed Christ the way He was.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.640
There’s been a very mixed&nbsp;
reaction here in the West

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.240
to some Eastern cults.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.160
There was the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.920
who numbered the Beatles as disciples,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.360
and of course, there’s now the Moonies

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.600
who are coming in for all kinds of criticism,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.120
brainwashing and so on.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.600
Now, how do you react to this kind of criticism?

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.560
That’s very true, they are like that.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.400
But because you are naive,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.600
you don’t understand that&nbsp;
you can’t pay for God’s love.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.680
You cannot organize Him.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.040
And all this ignorance, all this ignorance

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.520
has given them a chance to&nbsp;
come here and make money.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.000
It’s only money-making proposition.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.960
You cannot relate God to money.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.680
Can you tell me then exactly&nbsp;
what the students of your yoga,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.640
Sahaja Yoga, can and should experience?

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.271
They should experience a living experience,

00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:05.440
it’s a work of the Spirit and it&nbsp;
is described in all the books.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.560
Even in the Bible,

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.680
it is written that it’s a&nbsp;
cool wind of the Holy Ghost.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.240
And it is also written in the Old Testament that,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.440
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames”.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.760
So, all these things should be experienced

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.240
if you have to feel that you have got the Spirit.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.600
It’s an experience,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.920
and not just believing into it and brainwashing.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.760
You’re talking about spiritual&nbsp;
experiences, but also physical facts,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.000
the feeling of a cool wind and so on.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.880
So physically, what should we&nbsp;
experience? How does it work?

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.160
Actually, it works like&nbsp;
this, that you have a Spirit,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.640
but it is not in your conscious mind, you see.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.440
It’s not in the central&nbsp;
nervous system, you feel it.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.360
But when you get Realized,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.960
then you feel your Spirit in your conscious mind.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.120
And that’s why you say it is physically felt,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.280
because you can feel it on&nbsp;
your central nervous system.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.200
How, in fact, does it work in the body then?

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.680
Can you alter the body’s functions?

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.600
Yes, you can, because the body gets upset,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.160
because there are imbalances within us.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.080
It gets upset because we exhaust&nbsp;
our energies on different centres.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.560
When this Kundalini, which is the residual force,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.600
when it rises,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.840
it enlightens all these exhausted centres

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.400
and again refills it with vital energy,

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.320
and the whole thing gets all right.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.800
The Kundalini that you talk&nbsp;
about, the living force,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.080
can we actually physically&nbsp;
feel that rising in our bodies?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.120
Yes, you do. You not only feel it,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.360
but others can see it&nbsp;
pulsating in the sacrum bone,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.880
which is a sacred bone.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.360
I don’t know how in the Greek, I think,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.160
word it is “sacrum”, meaning sacred.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.520
That means they discovered it long-term back.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.360
So what can you then offer in this&nbsp;
form of yoga to a modern world,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.920
a disbelieving world?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.520
They believe it or not, it exists.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.680
You see, for them to be a scientist,&nbsp;
they must keep an open eye.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.840
That’s why they must have an open mind to see,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.840
because I have nothing to take&nbsp;
from you, to be sceptical.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.720
I have to just give, and if it gives you benefit,

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.760
why not have it?

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.000
Keep an open eye, that’s what one should do.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.280
It’s a hypothesis.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.120
But if a hypothesis can be proved,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.520
it becomes a law in science, isn’t it?

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.640
It’s been said that you’ve influenced&nbsp;
thousands of people at once

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.840
at some of your meetings,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.560
but isn’t that just the same&nbsp;
kind of emotional uplift

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.960
that others can feel at&nbsp;
maybe an evangelical meeting

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.080
or even a concert?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.200
No, one can deduce that, because it looks that,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.080
how can it be ‘en masse’? But it has to be.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.560
Everything has to come to the mass level.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.120
You see, whatever is&nbsp;
discovered on individual level

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.800
has to come to the mass level.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.240
Otherwise, it has no utility,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.360
and the time has come by, say,&nbsp;
the Blossom Time has come,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.240
and many flowers have to become fruits.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.920
Now, what do you hope to achieve

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.040
during your lecture tour in Scotland just now?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.240
I have lots of hopes.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.480
I think that Scotland is especially blessed place,

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.720
and they do believe in God,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.880
and there are people who are seekers.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.920
Lots of seekers are here, a&nbsp;
little bit lost, no doubt.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.760
But I’m sure if there are seekers,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.720
they will get it, no doubt,&nbsp;
because they deserve it.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.760
Do you think perhaps as a result&nbsp;
of our religious traditions,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.840
we’ve got a bit more of a&nbsp;
religious awareness still

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.360
than other sectors of society?

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.000
Yes, very much so, but one&nbsp;
should not be fanatical about it.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.720
One should keep an open mind&nbsp;
about everything that they do.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.520
Does some people make better&nbsp;
subjects for yoga than others.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.280
Are they more open to it?

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.600
Yes, I think so. They are very&nbsp;
much open, and they are seekers.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.960
They are born seekers. You&nbsp;
cannot make somebody a seeker.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.320
They are seekers, and they are&nbsp;
seeking it, so they get it.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.800
You have to knock at the door, and you get it.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.520
Now, a lot of your work is&nbsp;
spent in face-to-face contact,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.240
and you’ve been face-to-face with&nbsp;
me now for about ten minutes,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.320
so tell me, is there any hope for me?

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.480
Of course, very much for you, no doubt.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.640
For you, it is very much.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.200
I spent some time yesterday&nbsp;
looking at a picture of you,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.560
which it was claimed could help me to&nbsp;
begin to experience these feelings,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.920
but I must admit, nothing happened.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.400
Now, should something be happening to me just now?

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.360
No, nothing. You should just feel&nbsp;
the cool breeze from me, that’s all.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.640
And you should… you are feeling it,

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.720
if you can just experience like this, like this,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.480
if you put just your hands towards me.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.836
I’m stretching out my hands towards you now.

00:08:17.836 --> 00:08:19.760
No, like this. If you press it, you may start…

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.560
Palms upwards.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.280
Yes.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.760
I hate to admit it,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.274
but there is a slight sensation of a&nbsp;
cool breeze wafting over the palms.

00:08:27.274 --> 00:08:29.600
It is there, it is there. You see, not only,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.960
but I observed last, this Sunday, a lady,

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.680
she came to Me, and first day&nbsp;
she got it, and I told her,

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.080
“Don’t publish just now, you&nbsp;
better establish yourself “.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.360
But she said, “No, I can’t help it,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.360
I have to tell the world that it is there “.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.720
Because there are so many&nbsp;
seekers today in the whole world,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.720
and they are to be guided rightly, isn’t it?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.840
They must get it.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.406
So that means that I’m open to&nbsp;
achieving this kind of Self-realization.

00:08:51.406 --> 00:08:52.240
Yes, you are, you are, very much, very much.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.400
We shall explore this further after the program,

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.280
but it’s kind of difficult on radio.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.840
Yes, very true, but you should go further with it.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.800
You have to go deeper.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.120
It’s a very deep thing that happens to you,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.600
and you have to master it completely.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.440
You can, without paying&nbsp;
anything for it, effortlessly,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.360
but you must learn what is this,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.600
because you can feel the centres on your fingers,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.240
you can feel the centres very clearly,

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:21.440
and then you can cure people&nbsp;
also of cancer, even of cancer.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.760
So, in fact, it can produce physical healing too?

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.560
Yes, physical, mental, emotional,&nbsp;
as I told you, and intellectual.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.800
Well, thanks indeed to our guest in the program,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.549
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:09:32.549 --> 00:09:33.120
Thank you. Thank you.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.240
Thanks for dropping in.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.080
And she lectures tonight at&nbsp;
Hillhead Library in Glasgow at 6.45,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.880
and tomorrow in Edinburgh, I&nbsp;
suppose, lecturing about feelings.
