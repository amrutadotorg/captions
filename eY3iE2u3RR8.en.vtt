WEBVTT

00:01.950 --> 00:07.857
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna as Yogeshwara.

00:11.508 --> 00:23.033
As it is, you know that Vishnu’s first incarnation as a human being

00:23.782 --> 00:25.460
was Vamana avatar.

00:27.745 --> 00:36.610
And then went till He came as Shri Ram.

00:38.420 --> 00:44.567
So, the past of Shri Krishna was Shri Ram.

00:44.805 --> 00:47.405
And when Shri Rama came on this earth,

00:48.436 --> 00:53.416
He went into lots of austerities, to go to jungle,

00:53.654 --> 00:57.325
His wife was lost, whom He had to find out.

00:58.019 --> 01:02.932
And to establish the benevolent king

01:04.381 --> 01:13.785
on this earth, He was made the king of Ayodhya.

01:17.594 --> 01:28.210
But all His life it was a struggle
and austerities which He followed.

01:29.282 --> 01:32.349
As a result, the people who followed Shri Ram

01:32.536 --> 01:34.976
became extremely austere.

01:36.008 --> 01:41.524
They used to sleep on the grass

01:42.655 --> 01:46.788
because Shri Ram had to sleep on the grass for so many years.

01:47.784 --> 01:51.831
They used to wear wooden slippers.

01:53.042 --> 01:59.391
They would just wear very little clothes or one dhoti,

01:59.590 --> 02:03.835
just like Shri Rama wore when His wife was out.

02:04.511 --> 02:12.304
All these austerities they did to show how a householder should be.

02:13.892 --> 02:20.955
He never enjoyed any other life as a man,

02:21.833 --> 02:29.308
but just lived like an ascetic when His wife was lost.

02:32.493 --> 02:38.654
All these things were to establish also a very

02:39.269 --> 02:46.412
ideal personality for a man to be attached to His wife.

02:47.940 --> 02:52.959
He was a person with Ekapatnivrata, means: one wife.

02:53.972 --> 02:58.859
Though She knew She was Mahalakshmi, She was a Goddess,

02:59.574 --> 03:10.109
but still He was forced to do things

03:10.387 --> 03:14.254
because He wanted to show how a benevolent king should be.

03:19.197 --> 03:24.554
In the second incarnation of His, when He came as Shri Krishna,

03:26.519 --> 03:32.868
then He had to neutralize
all these austerities He has put on people.

04:17.744 --> 04:22.645
– Ha. So, Shri Krishna came on this earth.

04:27.388 --> 04:32.741
In His childhood He had to also face lots of

04:32.999 --> 04:35.915
problems which He surpassed,

04:39.467 --> 04:46.808
and He went and killed His uncle, as you know very well,

04:47.610 --> 04:49.712
who was a rakshasa.

04:50.705 --> 04:57.761
After doing all this, then He went to Dwarika, which He built

04:58.198 --> 05:00.877
– now they have found out where is Dwarika

05:01.075 --> 05:03.475
– and He became the king of Dwarika.

05:09.806 --> 05:11.606
To understand Shri Krishna

05:13.675 --> 05:19.127
in Sahaja Yoga is much more subtler
than the stories that they tell.

05:19.247 --> 05:21.180
[aside] … move it – better. ?

05:21.608 --> 05:24.842
The stories are there,

05:25.239 --> 05:27.500
but behind these stories,

05:27.699 --> 05:31.499
as being Sahaja Yogis, you have to see the subtle things

05:31.886 --> 05:35.199
about His incarnation.

05:36.231 --> 05:41.145
So, the first one was, He was Leeladhara,

05:42.297 --> 05:45.163
means the One who said this is all a play.

05:47.059 --> 05:49.792
That means you have to become a witness.

05:50.709 --> 05:54.509
So, He said that your mind should become just a witness.

05:57.336 --> 06:01.500
At Virata stage He becomes Akbar.

06:02.215 --> 06:08.623
And at that stage He is the mind, the brain of

06:11.123 --> 06:12.990
the great primordial Being.

06:14.675 --> 06:21.976
So, first He thinks that we have to become witness,

06:23.415 --> 06:24.882
witness of the drama,

06:26.232 --> 06:33.803
and we should not get lost into the Maya.

06:35.192 --> 06:41.541
If you are a witness you can see the Maya, how it works.

06:42.672 --> 06:51.751
So the first, first subtle nature
of Shri Krishna was to create a Leela

06:52.109 --> 06:58.378
to neutralize all the austerities
created by the incarnation of Shri Rama.

06:59.529 --> 07:04.124
But the second great quality

07:05.295 --> 07:10.612
that He had is also to put the Maya on people.

07:13.132 --> 07:19.362
So, if He is the brain, our brain should become a sakshi,

07:20.295 --> 07:24.525
should become a witness, witness the play.

07:25.339 --> 07:31.469
You should not take anything as something extremely serious.

07:32.303 --> 07:36.172
When you look at things as sakshi swarupa, as

07:36.331 --> 07:39.064
something that you are watching a drama,

07:39.406 --> 07:44.882
you may for the time being feel that you are Napoleon,
you are the one who is acting.

07:45.061 --> 07:47.458
But after some time the play is over,

07:47.617 --> 07:52.974
you know it’s a play. So, to reach that state, you have to

07:54.165 --> 07:58.609
become thoughtlessly aware.

07:59.701 --> 08:02.359
Because we think from our brain,

08:03.213 --> 08:07.557
and this brain goes on thinking, thinking, creating a Maya,

08:08.371 --> 08:10.436
and playing into Maya.

08:11.126 --> 08:17.381
Now, here it is when you are a realized soul,
you should see through the Maya.

08:18.472 --> 08:24.325
Everything that I am doing or you are doing,

08:26.210 --> 08:33.816
should be understood very well if you are really

08:35.344 --> 08:39.252
the reflection of Shri Krishna’s brain.

08:40.761 --> 08:45.106
So, in your brain, there should be no worry,

08:45.562 --> 08:49.229
there should be no stress, there should be no problem,

08:51.396 --> 08:55.395
because you are just watching everything

08:55.713 --> 08:58.173
in thoughtless awareness.

08:58.868 --> 09:01.535
So, when you are thoughtless awareness,

09:02.102 --> 09:07.994
means when your brain is just in the state of witness,

09:09.245 --> 09:14.257
you understand everything that is Divine.

09:14.575 --> 09:17.775
I’ll give you an example, just now it happened.

09:17.928 --> 09:22.571
I got into the car and they didn’t know where to go,

09:23.286 --> 09:27.419
and we went onto wrong road, then I told him ” Go this way “.

09:28.226 --> 09:32.493
So he was wondering ” How Mother knows?” I said ” Vibrations! ”

09:34.878 --> 09:38.904
Through vibrations I could feel we are ther
– they are all there, sitting there,

09:39.162 --> 09:40.496
– and we came round.

09:43.468 --> 09:49.135
Unless and untill you are thoughtlessly aware,
you cannot grow, that is first thing.

09:49.520 --> 09:57.019
And secondly, unless and until you are thoughtlessly aware,
you do not know the absolute Truth.

09:58.369 --> 10:00.969
Through your brain only you will know.

10:01.997 --> 10:06.464
You don’t have to put your hands, you don’t have to ask questions.

10:06.791 --> 10:12.465
But it’s like a computer that works, it just gives you an answer.

10:13.597 --> 10:17.197
In that state you are completely one with the Divine,

10:17.406 --> 10:20.362
and it just gives you an answer,

10:20.819 --> 10:24.686
and you do that and you are amazed how it has worked out.

10:26.010 --> 10:29.943
Everything, every moment is computerized with Shri Krishna.

10:32.121 --> 10:35.553
But at the same time He tests you,

10:36.982 --> 10:41.089
He plays His Leela on you. That one must know,

10:41.744 --> 10:43.411
because He’s a diplomat.

10:44.621 --> 10:49.419
How He has played Leela on you is very interesting to see,

10:50.531 --> 10:51.797
His style of Leela.

10:53.943 --> 10:55.410
Like He’s told Arjuna

10:59.082 --> 11:00.882
that ” I will not fight “.

11:03.666 --> 11:07.157
Arjuna said: ” All right, what will you do? ”

11:07.316 --> 11:10.729
” I’ll be your charioteer,

11:11.049 --> 11:12.716
I’ll drive your chariot.

11:13.311 --> 11:17.404
” Now it would look funny to anybody: ”
What is this, such a great man

11:17.663 --> 11:19.956
who calls me as His guru,

11:20.214 --> 11:22.347
He says that He is the one who,

11:22.556 --> 11:25.750
I mean, He says that I am the best of His disciples,

11:25.889 --> 11:30.556
everything, and here He just offers
His services like a charioteer. ”

11:32.238 --> 11:40.444
In this, He is just trying a trick on Arjuna.

11:43.937 --> 11:47.270
As if He knows the future that’s going to happen.

11:48.560 --> 11:54.611
So, the whole Gita was created because He was just a charioteer,

11:55.705 --> 11:59.871
because Arjuna said ” I cannot fight my own people,

12:00.948 --> 12:08.300
I cannot fight my own grandparents,
and I cannot fight my relations. ”

12:10.086 --> 12:13.486
Now, if you say that Gita is for peace, it is not.

12:16.118 --> 12:17.518
It is not for peace.

12:19.530 --> 12:23.864
But He says that: ” They are already dead, whom are you killing?

12:25.582 --> 12:29.649
These dead people, if you are killing them what will happen?

12:30.450 --> 12:34.617
But if you now run away from the battlefield,

12:35.212 --> 12:38.426
people will call you a coward,

12:40.272 --> 12:44.139
and what will you get? But if you fight for the religion,

12:46.284 --> 12:52.657
then you will get your resurrection – moksha.”

12:53.947 --> 12:56.480
It’s a big trick in all these things.

12:57.299 --> 13:02.688
Same was said by Mohammed Sahib, and same by Christians later,

13:03.344 --> 13:10.168
same about the Hindus
– that they all feel they are fighting for Dharma.

13:13.582 --> 13:16.382
In Arjuna’s case, it was a clear-cut case

13:16.935 --> 13:21.351
that somebody was a rakshasa and horrible people,

13:21.490 --> 13:25.557
they were adharmis, so He was fighting them, it’s all right.

13:28.554 --> 13:34.287
But what about other people when they say that ” We are going to

13:34.665 --> 13:41.724
die for religion “? I met a Bosnia muslim
who had just somewhere escaped

13:42.220 --> 13:45.644
and I asked Him ” Why, why do you want to fight?

13:45.823 --> 13:53.938
Why do you want to fight for land
when you believe in the formless God? ”

13:54.335 --> 13:58.573
He said: ” It’s written in the Koran that if you fight for religion

13:58.871 --> 14:03.737
then you will get your moksha.
” Exactly the same Shri Krishna has said.

14:06.867 --> 14:08.600
But where is the mistake?

14:10.180 --> 14:13.731
The mistake is: what is the Dharma?

14:16.259 --> 14:22.260
Are you dharmic? Are you in – standing in Dharma?

14:24.053 --> 14:29.224
Then this fight was in those days, were with weapons.

14:29.879 --> 14:33.612
So, why did Shri Krishna not take a weapon in His hand?

14:35.434 --> 14:40.116
This is the second. Firstly, nobody has Dharma,

14:40.395 --> 14:43.866
they’re all adharmis
– they may call themselves hindus, muslims, christians

14:44.006 --> 14:46.857
– all are adharmis, they don’t follow the religion.

14:46.976 --> 14:51.301
And secondly, they are killing each other only,

14:51.440 --> 14:53.774
one adharmi killing other adharmi,

14:53.901 --> 14:57.095
or maybe in between themselves they are fighting: everybody

14:57.234 --> 15:01.568
is thinking ” I am right and whatever I am doing is the right. ”

15:02.332 --> 15:06.732
So, the first condition is put that for Dharma you have to fight.

15:06.892 --> 15:10.826
So first, one should find out: are we fighting for Dharma?

15:12.964 --> 15:15.106
But He was even subtler,

15:15.801 --> 15:19.134
He didn’t take any weapons in His hands, nothing.

15:19.841 --> 15:24.066
He was just holding the reins of the chariot.

15:25.753 --> 15:28.908
Because Shri Krishna is the mind,

15:29.325 --> 15:34.701
is the Virat, is the great Mind,
He doesn’t need any weapons or such.

15:35.952 --> 15:37.952
But what He did at that time,

15:38.214 --> 15:44.657
He used His mind for a very very profound knowledge,

15:45.927 --> 15:49.127
to explain to Arjuna. Imagine, in the warfield,

15:49.366 --> 15:53.167
He didn’t make Him sit down
” All right, you are my Shishya, you sit here,

15:53.286 --> 15:55.486
I am your guru, I’ll tell you. ”

15:56.084 --> 15:58.684
– nothing. In the battlefield you see,

15:59.755 --> 16:06.453
when everybody was there to fight
and they were about to start the war,

16:07.425 --> 16:16.095
He starts telling very patiently to Arjuna, at that time.

16:17.564 --> 16:22.725
Now, what is He doing there? He’s not using any weapons, nothing.

16:22.904 --> 16:31.277
He is being counselling, counselling to Arjuna, telling him.

16:33.103 --> 16:36.019
Now, see His subtle brain.

16:38.162 --> 16:41.773
He introduces in the first chapter only that

16:41.892 --> 16:44.892
” You have to go higher then what you are. ”

16:46.326 --> 16:48.421
And then He gives him

16:48.858 --> 16:54.391
the definition of a person who
is an enlightened person which is a Sthitha Pragya.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.088
I mean, normally, a businessman will start

17:00.187 --> 17:04.036
from one dollar, then hundred dollars,
you see, the other way round.

17:04.215 --> 17:06.925
But He told him first thing

17:07.481 --> 17:12.014
that ” You have to become a Sthitha Pragya, otherwise it’s no use.”

17:13.392 --> 17:17.992
Unless and until you become
Sthitha Pragya you cannot have Dharma,

17:18.155 --> 17:19.422
this is the point.

17:20.060 --> 17:23.316
To understand Shri Krishna, you have to really have a very

17:23.432 --> 17:25.836
subtle brain, otherwise you cannot understand.

17:27.464 --> 17:30.933
So, He tells that ” You should

17:32.004 --> 17:37.797
give up this kind of a morose that has developed in you,

17:37.897 --> 17:39.644
Kaivalya I will call it.

17:40.498 --> 17:44.803
And what you have to do, now take up the weapon in your hand

17:45.041 --> 17:46.469
and fight. ”

17:51.212 --> 17:56.782
So, then, He asked him about other things,

17:58.291 --> 18:01.921
” What about that: You are here telling me

18:02.139 --> 18:04.339
that you should become Nishkriya,

18:05.016 --> 18:09.701
that means “no work”. Your karmas become akarmas.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.586
Now, talking like this,

18:11.746 --> 18:15.946
and why do you want me to kill these people – that is akarma? ”

18:17.280 --> 18:21.042
Now, how you see, slowly removes from one point

18:21.319 --> 18:25.010
that you should fight for Dharma. Now, it’s a very subtle thing:

18:25.190 --> 18:28.457
are you in Dharma or not, first of all find out?

18:29.456 --> 18:34.971
You are not, so what Dharma you fight, first?

18:35.468 --> 18:38.225
Then, the second thing is karma.

18:39.910 --> 18:45.736
Again, see, He is a brainy fellow, the brains of God,

18:46.461 --> 18:48.266
extremely tricky.

18:49.202 --> 18:54.162
The second trick He plays on Him saying that

18:56.305 --> 19:05.566
” You are working, all right? But if you are a Sthitha Pragya,

19:07.392 --> 19:13.205
then you leave all the work at the lotus feet of God ” or Him.

19:14.277 --> 19:17.510
[Hindi phrase, UNCLEAR]

19:17.888 --> 19:20.209
“Give up all Dharmas and follow Me. ”

19:22.327 --> 19:23.927
Now what is his Dharma?

19:25.244 --> 19:27.997
That problem is that people don’t understand Him.

19:28.136 --> 19:31.608
It’s all concentrated on Shri Krishna, and

19:31.767 --> 19:36.727
His own manifestation.

19:37.224 --> 19:39.168
[aside]

19:43.335 --> 19:46.540
He says that ” Do your karmas.

19:47.315 --> 19:51.501
But you put them at the lotus feet of the Lord! ”

19:52.572 --> 19:56.639
– It’s not possible unless and until you are Sthitha Pragya,

19:56.858 --> 19:58.834
unless and until you are enlightened.

19:58.934 --> 20:03.064
Now, when you are enlightened,
when you have got your realization,

20:03.167 --> 20:07.524
when you raise your Kundalini or anybody’s Kundalini,

20:07.862 --> 20:13.477
you don’t say ” Mother, I am giving realization “.
You don’t say that, never.

20:14.390 --> 20:18.675
What you say: ” It is happening “, in third person you talk. ”

20:19.052 --> 20:23.519
It’s not coming, it’s not working or it’s just moving on the side.

20:23.636 --> 20:26.254
This chakra is catching, that chakra is catching.

20:26.414 --> 20:30.719
” You never say ” I am doing anything “, the ‘I’ is lost.

20:32.862 --> 20:40.887
When that ‘I’ is lost, than only
you will put everything at the lotus feet of God.

20:41.364 --> 20:43.964
So, first, it should be done in Dharma.

20:44.319 --> 20:47.752
Supposing, somebody murders somebody and say ” Oh, I have

20:47.931 --> 20:52.157
done it now, so it is my karmas
and I put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna. ”

20:52.534 --> 20:56.334
Now, people can, I mean, people have special brains also

20:57.058 --> 21:00.222
to interprete Shri Krishna and Gita.

21:01.353 --> 21:04.170
But what He said for Dharma you should do it.

21:04.745 --> 21:10.012
So, first of all, you should be
a Sthitha Pragya, means an enlightened person,

21:10.182 --> 21:12.177
and whatever you do

21:12.436 --> 21:16.436
automatically goes at the lotus feet of God, automatically,

21:16.702 --> 21:18.864
spontaneously, Sahaj.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.144
Now, the third thing He did:

21:25.819 --> 21:28.933
What about bhakti? People said ” What?

21:29.092 --> 21:34.292
We are doing bhakti to God, this,
that, then what is the reward for this? ”

21:34.450 --> 21:36.384
There again He plays tricks.

21:37.367 --> 21:40.767
On one word He has made everybody dance, you know?

21:42.307 --> 21:47.316
He says ” You do bhakti, but it should be Ananya, ”

21:47.490 --> 21:51.800
– this is the word, Ananya, – when there is not the other,

21:52.317 --> 21:56.225
means when you have become One with Me,

21:56.721 --> 22:00.921
means you are a Sthitha Pragya, means you are a realized soul.

22:03.606 --> 22:08.023
Just imagine, on this word if people pay attention,

22:08.261 --> 22:11.328
they will give up all this nonsense of bhakti

22:11.693 --> 22:17.546
and will first get their connection when they become Ananya

22:17.705 --> 22:19.305
and then do the bhakti.

22:21.178 --> 22:24.511
Because Shri Krishna knew human beings very well.

22:24.948 --> 22:29.115
I think, He knew them better than Christ
– definitely

22:30.317 --> 22:33.349
– because Christ was straightforward.

22:33.548 --> 22:36.445
He said: ” Take out your right eye, throw it away.

22:36.584 --> 22:39.004
Take out your left eye, throw it away.

22:39.124 --> 22:41.057
Cut your hand, throw it away.

22:41.386 --> 22:44.452
” Same with Mohammed Sahib. Who will do that?

22:45.969 --> 22:50.730
So, Shri Krishna was very clever, He said:

22:50.929 --> 22:53.729
straightforward they will not understand,

22:53.881 --> 22:58.563
so give them in such a way that they will go on doing and doing,

22:58.699 --> 23:02.591
we are doing so much bhakti, so many people come into it.
Even this Ram,

23:02.789 --> 23:06.598
Hari Ramas, they are developing now throat cancers.

23:06.877 --> 23:10.587
So, they are saying ” Mother, why these throat cancer to us,

23:10.726 --> 23:15.593
we are saying the name of Sri Krishna?”
” Because you are not connected.”

23:16.688 --> 23:21.799
Now supposing, I will even want to
meet the president of this country.

23:22.276 --> 23:26.878
I’ll have to go through such a protocol. I may not even meet.

23:29.815 --> 23:33.902
But this One is the God of Gods.

23:35.271 --> 23:38.138
He is the President of all the presidents.

23:39.991 --> 23:44.940
If you have to take His name, if you go and take name of Lincoln,

23:45.040 --> 23:50.506
of Clinton, and go on saying
” Clinton, Clinton Clinton “, they’ll all arrest Me.

23:51.468 --> 23:57.876
So, if you go on saying ” Rama, Rama, Rama,
Allah, Allah, Allah, Akbar, Akbar, Akbar “, you’ll be arrested.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.636
You have no connection.

24:02.183 --> 24:04.716
So, that Virata Shakti which we call,

24:06.563 --> 24:10.194
which is of course in Koran described as Akbar,

24:12.734 --> 24:16.940
this power also plays tricks.

24:23.766 --> 24:27.198
As a Mother, I have to warn you

24:29.145 --> 24:36.160
that nothing will work out
unless (and) until you are a realized soul.

24:36.974 --> 24:41.537
Nothing will work out. Now, for realization,

24:42.411 --> 24:44.878
He has said: ” You have to become “.

24:45.268 --> 24:48.601
But He didn’t say at that time

24:49.474 --> 24:54.025
how you will become, what will work it out.

24:55.790 --> 24:58.990
Because you see, sort of, if you go to college,

24:59.139 --> 25:02.205
all the knowledge is not given in first year.

25:02.358 --> 25:04.957
Something is given, then something in second year,

25:05.096 --> 25:09.763
then in third year. Now in the seventh year,
now Sahaja Yoga has come

25:09.958 --> 25:12.517
to tell you everything, totally.

25:14.204 --> 25:19.815
He is Totality, but He doesn’t give total knowledge.

25:20.847 --> 25:23.447
The whole knowledge of Gita is nothing

25:23.702 --> 25:27.969
but trick that He has played with human beings who were stupid,

25:28.147 --> 25:30.271
and would never have understood Him

25:30.470 --> 25:33.004
if He’d told them about Sahaja Yoga.

25:33.149 --> 25:36.149
Even today I meet many like that, of course,

25:36.700 --> 25:41.260
but so many He could not have got at that time.

25:42.015 --> 25:47.689
So, they didn’t talk about Kundalini this much, so far,

25:48.126 --> 25:49.752
and that’s all.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.736
Same with other people.

25:56.053 --> 26:00.906
The kind of disciples they had, the kind of people they had,

26:01.066 --> 26:06.911
they could not tell them everything about

26:07.328 --> 26:12.049
their ascent, because they were not ready,

26:12.288 --> 26:16.688
they were not of that level, their brains were not that developed.

26:16.971 --> 26:20.628
Now in this Kali Yuga, when I am starting this work,

26:20.867 --> 26:24.398
I find their brains are overdeveloped, over.

26:26.502 --> 26:30.807
And so much so that overdeveloped brains become stupid

26:30.998 --> 26:36.382
and that’s really. Overuse of anything makes you stupid,

26:37.613 --> 26:41.176
and they become absolutely stupid.

26:42.605 --> 26:46.168
Now, how can you tell them such a subtle knowledge

26:46.486 --> 26:51.069
who are stupid people? What is the way?

26:52.042 --> 26:55.097
If I talk like Shri Krishna

26:55.672 --> 26:59.176
it would have been just a waste of My energy

26:59.395 --> 27:03.261
and your energy. Half of you would have gone off to sleep.

27:03.522 --> 27:08.164
So I said, first of all, let Me connect them to Divinity.

27:08.720 --> 27:13.120
If I could connect them to Divinity – little bit even, little bit

27:13.323 --> 27:15.257
– then they will understand.

27:15.486 --> 27:19.086
Because that will enlighten their brain a little bit,

27:19.560 --> 27:23.282
and they will know that there’s something more than what we know.

27:23.719 --> 27:26.319
And that’s how it is going to work out.

27:26.814 --> 27:31.082
So the subtle system of trickery of Shri Krishna

27:31.280 --> 27:34.296
has helped a lot, no doubt, that people are realizing

27:34.515 --> 27:39.847
that there is something missing in it. Even of Islam

27:41.256 --> 27:47.565
– Islam means surrender – but surrender to whom? To mullahs

27:48.280 --> 27:56.813
– or to whom? The problem started when
[Hijak, a name – UNCLEAR] he started like that.

27:57.031 --> 27:59.602
There are mullahs and there are this.

27:59.781 --> 28:02.134
So, the surrender part became

28:02.254 --> 28:07.787
surrender to these stupid mullahs.
I’ve seen most of them are absolutely stupid.

28:08.463 --> 28:11.811
And they take a cane in their hands in the other, you see

28:11.974 --> 28:14.174
they beat, even women they beat.

28:14.331 --> 28:16.832
You are supposed to do Pujas five times

28:16.951 --> 28:20.780
and if you don’t do them, Pujas five times,
they call it silla [UNCLEAR],

28:20.939 --> 28:25.951
then they beat women. Every shop must be closed five times.

28:27.558 --> 28:32.201
I tell you, they are such hypocritical people naturally,

28:33.173 --> 28:37.107
because if you are asked to do five times meditation, say,

28:37.796 --> 28:40.930
you will never do it, but you will just do it out of fear.

28:41.098 --> 28:44.298
Out of fear if you do something, what’s the use?

28:46.122 --> 28:49.922
Now, whatever Muhammed Sahib has said or Christ has said,

28:50.686 --> 28:55.983
it is only for angels, I can tell you, not for normal people.

28:57.293 --> 29:03.146
And where are the angels? Very few there are:

29:03.661 --> 29:07.595
those are born-realized people who have come on this earth

29:07.756 --> 29:15.275
are angels. And they are told not to do something they will not do.

29:15.811 --> 29:19.474
Most of them know what is right and wrong.

29:19.677 --> 29:21.944
Where are those angels, very few?

29:23.165 --> 29:28.065
And those who are angels are treated just like, you can call it,

29:29.453 --> 29:33.929
like packed people or lunatic people, – nobody believes them.

29:34.426 --> 29:38.850
One here and one there and one in some other place.

29:39.545 --> 29:44.981
So this, what they preached was for the angels.

29:45.556 --> 29:47.823
Only the angels could understand.

29:48.041 --> 29:52.035
But Shri Krishna thought that these other people who are there,

29:52.169 --> 29:54.836
who are not angels, why not trick them?

29:56.395 --> 30:01.795
Many people come and tell me: ”
We take the name of Krishna every day like this,

30:01.932 --> 30:04.198
and we haven’t received anything.

30:04.967 --> 30:08.700
” But first He said, ” You have to be Sthitha Pragya. ”

30:09.014 --> 30:14.341
Sthitha Pragya: ‘Sthitha’ means established,

30:15.075 --> 30:17.952
‘Pragya’ means enlightened,

30:18.944 --> 30:25.868
– you should be enlightened personality, absolutely established.

30:26.556 --> 30:30.156
First thing, first thing you see, in a second chapter.

30:30.504 --> 30:35.325
First thing is it. After that He says all these things,

30:35.881 --> 30:41.357
and that’s why many people have misunderstood Gita.

30:41.953 --> 30:45.486
But His idea was: in one life they’ll misunderstand,

30:45.720 --> 30:48.053
second life they’ll misunderstand,

30:48.200 --> 30:52.230
third life they will start thinking ” After all, what is this?”

30:52.369 --> 30:56.853
First, He has said “You become a Sthitha Pragya”,
we have not become a Sthitha Pragya.

30:57.071 --> 30:58.938
So, what’s wrong with us? ”

30:59.829 --> 31:02.163
So, some introspection will start.

31:02.607 --> 31:05.860
That was His idea, idea I should say.

31:06.493 --> 31:12.981
But I have seen people
who can give lectures on Gita hours together,

31:13.299 --> 31:17.366
but their brains are closed completely.

31:19.569 --> 31:23.969
Now, to say that He didn’t say anything about Kundalini is there.

31:24.489 --> 31:30.393
That’s why Gyaneshwara in
the twelvth century took permission from his brother

31:30.870 --> 31:35.537
who was his guru that ”Allow me, at least, to say about Kundalini.”

31:36.465 --> 31:39.465
And that is how it was exposed a little bit.

31:40.381 --> 31:42.635
Of course, before that also,

31:43.031 --> 31:49.342
we have had people like Adi Shankaracharya, the sixth century,

31:49.838 --> 31:53.524
and before that also Markandeya.

31:54.395 --> 32:00.905
But they talked about the Kundalini,
that’s all, praised the Kundalini.

32:01.898 --> 32:06.898
But that She passes through six centers,
how will It raise and all that.

32:07.433 --> 32:11.233
And not about the future, that this will happen one day.

32:11.932 --> 32:14.132
So many have written, of course.

32:14.365 --> 32:19.699
But I would say that precisely the one who has written

32:20.310 --> 32:25.354
complete description of Sahaja Yogis even is by Gyaneshwara

32:25.612 --> 32:32.298
in the poetry called Pasaydan in which
he exactly said what will happen,

32:32.914 --> 32:36.941
how many people will get realization

32:37.358 --> 32:39.691
and he said that ” You the people,

32:40.681 --> 32:54.113
who are the forests of the trees,
boon-giving trees, Kalpakaruna, boon-giving trees,

32:54.669 --> 32:59.172
you rise and give it to others.

32:59.461 --> 33:06.679
” Then he says that ” You are the oceans who are

33:07.994 --> 33:11.084
giving ambrosia talks.”

33:11.958 --> 33:15.158
He has described you in such a beautiful manner

33:16.085 --> 33:19.351
that you should read the translation of Pasaydan

33:19.755 --> 33:22.222
and then you will know what you are,

33:22.493 --> 33:28.293
how you have been praised by him.
And he said that you will loose other relationship

33:28.524 --> 33:31.324
and the only relationships will be these.

33:31.976 --> 33:34.774
They will be your real relations.

33:35.290 --> 33:38.490
To say all these things, to have such a vision,

33:38.631 --> 33:42.234
he must be a great incarnation himself.

33:42.770 --> 33:52.997
So, this is how in Gyaneshwari, which is a commentary of Gita,

33:53.155 --> 33:57.289
he has put in the sixth chapter, now is a commentary on Gita,

33:57.462 --> 34:01.928
but in the sixth chapter he said how you can get your realization.

34:02.859 --> 34:05.459
About Kundalini, how it will work out.

34:05.716 --> 34:08.847
So, gradually it was all unfolded.

34:09.304 --> 34:12.240
And gradually people also developed

34:12.439 --> 34:14.839
their spiritual state to understand.

34:15.157 --> 34:19.290
Supposing, I had started Sahaja Yoga even hundred years back,

34:19.502 --> 34:23.969
I would not have even one single disciple, one single Sahaja Yogi.

34:24.205 --> 34:28.728
The reason was, the people were all right,
they were on value system, all right.

34:28.847 --> 34:32.726
Their life was very much satisfying, they were very peaceful.

34:32.846 --> 34:36.536
They were just interested in some horses or something like that.

34:36.675 --> 34:42.012
But now, you find people are so much disturbed,

34:42.191 --> 34:46.457
so much in trouble, so much in chaos this in Kali Yuga,

34:46.695 --> 34:50.703
it’s the height of Kali Yuga now. So much of immorality,

34:51.001 --> 34:54.988
so much of dissatisfaction in life

34:55.229 --> 34:59.455
that they have to now think where to go.

35:00.229 --> 35:04.078
Like a shock the future is waiting for them

35:04.265 --> 35:07.798
and now what should they achieve. So, the whole this

35:09.394 --> 35:17.501
Bhranti, illusion of life starts staring at them,

35:17.760 --> 35:21.509
and then they start thinking ” What is this, what am I doing,

35:21.707 --> 35:24.327
what have I done, why is it so?

35:24.625 --> 35:28.176
Why everything in a chaos, why is it happening? ”

35:28.752 --> 35:33.605
Then the seeking starts and with their seeking now,
you know what has happened,

35:33.743 --> 35:36.163
that you all have got your realization.

35:36.304 --> 35:41.085
Without the seeking it would not
have been even possible for Me to talk to you

35:41.263 --> 35:43.426
at all about Sahaja Yoga.

35:43.584 --> 35:46.263
It is because you are seekers I can talk to you.

35:46.402 --> 35:48.457
And it has worked out,

35:48.577 --> 35:51.911
I am very happy that it has worked out in America.

35:53.287 --> 35:58.386
Another quality, is a great quality of Shri Krishna, is that

35:58.664 --> 36:03.815
He is Gujara [HINDI ?], means

36:04.689 --> 36:08.637
His element is firmament, what we call Akash,

36:09.510 --> 36:12.645
and He penetrates into everything.

36:13.538 --> 36:20.686
He penetrates into everything. He penetrates into the

36:21.987 --> 36:28.464
– what do you call that – anu, renu, paramanu,

36:28.643 --> 36:38.305
three things – atoms. Into little atoms it goes and it shakes them.

36:38.901 --> 36:41.967
Now, if you ask any scientist, he’ll tell you

36:42.175 --> 36:48.753
that there is an asymetric, symetric vibrations even in atoms.

36:49.289 --> 36:53.696
Now, how can this energy be existing there?

36:53.915 --> 36:57.089
Because He can penetrate into anything

36:57.347 --> 37:01.315
and because of this, He’s so penetrating,

37:01.832 --> 37:05.998
that He encompasses everything:

37:06.435 --> 37:14.992
into matter, into animals, into human beings, into realized souls

37:15.476 --> 37:21.738
He penetrates. In the matter it is just a vibrations,

37:22.186 --> 37:25.142
in the animals it is just a guiding force,

37:25.298 --> 37:27.364
it’s tremendous guiding force.

37:33.131 --> 37:38.754
Like birds from Siberia flying down to Australia:

37:39.925 --> 37:42.525
who gives them the sense of direction?

37:43.179 --> 37:45.192
We never think about it.

37:48.129 --> 37:52.791
There are so many things animals are doing.

37:53.090 --> 37:56.482
They have such a sense of understanding.

37:56.760 --> 38:00.867
Like a tiger in the, say, in the forest:

38:01.304 --> 38:04.676
all the animals know that there is a tiger in the forest,

38:04.836 --> 38:07.702
they are all quiet, respecting their king.

38:08.277 --> 38:13.555
He kills, say one cow or could be some animal,

38:13.853 --> 38:19.487
they just respect him. The thing what he has killed is left

38:19.984 --> 38:22.840
for one day, nobody touches it.

38:23.535 --> 38:27.781
See the protocol: now when he comes back next day,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.436
he eats to his own satisfaction,

38:31.032 --> 38:34.165
then the tigress, then the children, they eat.

38:34.742 --> 38:40.734
Once they have finished with it,
then one by one, in the order of protocol,

38:41.211 --> 38:45.258
all the animals eat that animal,

38:45.754 --> 38:49.107
the last of all are crows

38:50.417 --> 38:54.849
which are perhaps vegetarians, I should say.

38:55.130 --> 39:01.357
But the protocol is maintained.

39:02.032 --> 39:07.805
If a lion is sitting,

39:08.302 --> 39:14.036
you can make it out there won’t be even a little sound anywhere.

39:16.677 --> 39:22.848
So, it guides the animals and animals keep their character.

39:23.818 --> 39:25.952
They are not like human beings.

39:26.112 --> 39:30.774
For example, a snake is a snake and a tiger is a tiger.

39:31.211 --> 39:34.782
But human beings can be snake, tiger, leopard

39:34.961 --> 39:36.568
– anything together.

39:37.759 --> 39:43.092
They might be dogs, they might be
small little worms, they could be anything.

39:44.009 --> 39:46.142
Combinations of so many things,

39:46.675 --> 39:50.734
because they have passed through
these Yonis, as they call them, these species.

39:51.350 --> 40:00.198
So, all these kinds of combinations, permutations,
combinations inside of the past is existing.

40:01.091 --> 40:05.824
And if somebody can take you to your subconscious,
I have seen this,

40:06.052 --> 40:08.252
people start barking like a dog,

40:08.949 --> 40:16.312
and sometimes they behave like tigers, this can happen.

40:17.007 --> 40:19.705
All this is within us, the past,

40:20.123 --> 40:23.971
with all these complicated personalities.

40:24.968 --> 40:32.535
Some are like owls, always very serious, you know, hawk-like,

40:32.932 --> 40:36.066
some are like chirping birds.

40:36.821 --> 40:40.421
But there are so many combinations they have in them,

40:41.265 --> 40:44.459
that it is very difficult, you know,

40:45.412 --> 40:49.525
to make them little straightforward.

40:51.252 --> 40:55.652
They are so much entangled. First to remove all the entanglement.

40:57.283 --> 40:59.973
And then to raise the Kundalini.

41:00.371 --> 41:03.904
The best part of the organization is, which is made,

41:05.331 --> 41:09.676
that consciousness is vertically placed.

41:10.152 --> 41:13.366
Subconscious and Supraconscious sort.

41:13.585 --> 41:16.118
Supraconscious righthandside of yours

41:16.303 --> 41:19.237
and the Subconscious lefthandside of yours.

41:21.075 --> 41:25.542
And in the central the path is left on. This is the Sushumna path.

41:26.353 --> 41:28.353
It is the Mahalakshmi’s path.

41:28.734 --> 41:34.242
It is the path, which leads you to the state of Virat,

41:34.464 --> 41:36.264
to the state of your brain.

41:39.838 --> 41:45.095
So now, the combination of three things work out.

41:45.810 --> 41:50.770
The brain is the Virat, heart is Shiva,

41:51.465 --> 41:56.639
and the liver is Brahmadeva.

41:57.057 --> 42:00.290
All these three powers are there.

42:05.092 --> 42:08.445
But at that time, when you are realized,

42:08.803 --> 42:13.227
then your brain surrenders to Shiva,

42:13.664 --> 42:17.673
to the principle of Shiva, that is the Spirit.

42:18.343 --> 42:23.844
Brain is surrendered, surrendered not by force or anything,

42:24.300 --> 42:29.471
but to absorb the power of the Spirit,

42:29.669 --> 42:34.332
the brain gets surrendered completely to the Spirit,

42:35.146 --> 42:37.879
so that the Spirit enlightens the brain.

42:39.372 --> 42:43.062
It is the enlightenment of the brain

42:43.816 --> 42:50.531
that gives you all this subtle understanding.

42:50.990 --> 42:54.955
It is to make your brain understand,

42:55.551 --> 43:00.729
there are so many blissful happenings, people are blessed:

43:01.067 --> 43:07.515
once, twice, thrice – then they are surprised,
the brain starts thinking.

43:07.971 --> 43:11.206
”How did I get this blessing, how did it happen to me,

43:11.385 --> 43:18.269
how could I get my transformation?” So slowly-slowly

43:18.548 --> 43:23.944
they start trusting their heart,
means they start trusting their Spirit,

43:24.143 --> 43:29.500
they start trusting their devotion.

43:31.246 --> 43:37.587
And this is how the bhakti is absolutely

43:38.123 --> 43:43.202
done without any desire, without any asking,

43:43.381 --> 43:46.932
without any obligation, just in oneness.

43:47.091 --> 43:53.420
Because the brain joins hands with the heart, we can say.

43:54.331 --> 44:00.878
Now, also the Brahmadeva becomes surrendered.

44:02.188 --> 44:08.390
As a result, what happens:
that your liver is surrendered to your brain.

44:11.901 --> 44:17.805
When this happens – when your liver is surrendered to your brain

44:18.045 --> 44:22.370
– whatever you do is all enlightened work.

44:23.322 --> 44:26.952
Whatever you do: whether you sing,

44:27.151 --> 44:30.344
whether you’re a government servant, whether anything

44:30.505 --> 44:33.837
– whatever you do with your brain, anything

44:33.976 --> 44:36.158
through the Swadishthana

44:36.337 --> 44:41.095
or through the Brahmadeva, it is an enlightened work.

44:41.241 --> 44:44.653
As it is the brain which is enlightened,

44:45.321 --> 44:48.654
which is connected with this All Pervading Power,

44:48.991 --> 44:55.122
whatever you are doing, whatever your ideas are,

44:55.559 --> 45:03.237
being absolutely enlightened means that you achieve them.

45:05.804 --> 45:09.653
Enlightened brain, whatever it thinks,

45:10.229 --> 45:14.669
it is thinking as well as achieving – both together.

45:16.577 --> 45:22.985
It’s a thing to be understood that an enlightened person

45:24.295 --> 45:28.955
has the power to achieve anything.

45:31.019 --> 45:35.573
But at the same time his desires would be Divine.

45:36.783 --> 45:41.346
Like the other day we had very few people say in Saritos,

45:42.002 --> 45:46.466
so all the Sahaja Yogis were extremely unhappy

45:47.081 --> 45:51.148
as if somebody has died in their family and worse than that.

45:52.379 --> 45:57.678
Why? Because this was their own work,

45:58.030 --> 46:05.237
which they could not understand why this enlightened mind of theirs

46:05.575 --> 46:08.975
could not produce the result, achieve the results.

46:10.833 --> 46:13.033
And they felt extremely unhappy.

46:13.492 --> 46:21.159
This shows what identification there is for the spiritual work,

46:21.675 --> 46:24.949
or Divine work and their own lives.

46:25.147 --> 46:27.547
To them this is the most important.

46:27.687 --> 46:30.425
And everybody is not like that, of course.

46:30.564 --> 46:33.699
For some people, something else is more important.

46:33.838 --> 46:38.798
They may use Sahaja Yoga for their own well-being or anything.

46:39.096 --> 46:41.763
But those who just think of Sahaja Yoga

46:43.121 --> 46:47.387
– that’s again the brain which is enlightened. They achieve it.

46:48.577 --> 46:52.110
But it should not have any selfish motive behind it.

46:52.506 --> 46:57.961
It should not have any hatred behind it or anything,

46:59.965 --> 47:03.658
or for some sort of a publicity or some.

47:04.928 --> 47:12.058
But if it is just the thinking about the Sahaja Yoga work,

47:12.199 --> 47:14.837
it will be achieved, it will be achieved.

47:14.996 --> 47:17.263
One should never feel frustrated.

47:17.655 --> 47:20.522
That’s what is said, that God is with you,

47:21.246 --> 47:23.091
He is your shepherd.

47:23.329 --> 47:27.774
And this is what happens when you become

47:28.389 --> 47:35.858
a surrendered lamb under the guide of this shepherd.

47:39.252 --> 47:46.096
Then as a result of this brain becoming enlightened,
you start having faith in yourself.

47:49.033 --> 47:51.833
Nirvikalpa, you become doubtlessly aware.

47:52.168 --> 47:56.101
As soon as you become, I mean the brain becomes doubtless.

47:56.228 --> 48:00.049
It’s the brain that thinks,
it’s the brain that doubts, it’s the brain

48:00.148 --> 48:04.082
that creates all conditionings, the brain that creates ego

48:04.950 --> 48:10.386
– one instrument doing all this nonsense. Hatred it will create,

48:10.525 --> 48:16.556
it will justify nonsense, it will criticize others,

48:16.894 --> 48:22.221
it will hate others, it will make fun of others.

48:23.749 --> 48:26.483
That is not the quality of Shri Krishna,

48:27.638 --> 48:30.574
because He is the collective.

48:34.166 --> 48:38.833
That’s why He never said: ” You are a sinner ”
or anything like that.

48:41.170 --> 48:44.103
He didn’t criticize anyone.

48:45.750 --> 48:50.531
After all, I have to criticize, He did not.

48:50.948 --> 48:54.682
Now, if there was Kamsa, all right, kill him, finished.

48:54.798 --> 48:56.598
There are Sanda, kill him.

48:57.119 --> 49:00.591
Any rakshasa, Narakasura, kill him,

49:01.008 --> 49:05.685
finished, no argument., nothing.
”I have no time for this nonsense. Finish him.”

49:06.499 --> 49:08.792
Straightforward.

49:09.566 --> 49:12.166
What is the use of criticizing anyone,

49:12.820 --> 49:18.752
just kill them. That was as straightforward.

49:19.209 --> 49:23.276
But by killing them, they again come back in this Kali Yuga.

49:26.114 --> 49:30.369
So the best thing is to detach people from him,

49:31.020 --> 49:34.556
from these rakshasas where they are lost.

49:34.874 --> 49:41.242
That’s the best way. Now,
one way could be that I put it in your brains

49:41.699 --> 49:48.108
that this is a rakshas. But they won’t believe Me, they won’t.

49:48.803 --> 49:51.960
So, what happens when you go to them,

49:52.218 --> 49:56.722
you get all the kinks in your head.

49:57.258 --> 50:00.925
You start getting pins and needles on your fingertips.

50:01.405 --> 50:05.868
This is all the activity of brain that it acts on your nerves,

50:06.146 --> 50:07.447
and you can feel it.

50:07.634 --> 50:12.706
You start shaking. The other day somebody came and sat before
Me for news just doing like this. ” What is this – Stop it! ”

50:12.864 --> 50:18.233
” So I can’t, I can’t, I can’t “, he was going on.
I wasn’t doing anything to him, it’s the brain.

50:19.802 --> 50:24.642
In My presence, the brain acts.

50:25.528 --> 50:28.994
Because as I told you, He penetrates into anything,

50:29.139 --> 50:31.205
if I put my glance at somebody.

50:32.809 --> 50:34.170
The other day,

50:34.349 --> 50:39.944
there was a boy, very naughty, beats people,
he bites them, these things like that, very crazy.

50:40.242 --> 50:42.309
As soon as he saw Me ran away.

50:43.298 --> 50:46.031
He attacks every person but he ran away.

50:46.491 --> 50:50.420
Then you have seen people who are possessed, what happens to them?

50:50.584 --> 50:53.584
Just like this, they come to Me, they shake,

50:53.764 --> 50:56.879
they – sometimes I only worry that they should not faint

50:57.040 --> 51:00.988
in My presence in the programme, otherwise it’s a headache.

51:02.278 --> 51:07.833
So, who acts in them, who acts on these people who are possessed,

51:08.050 --> 51:11.050
who makes all these gestures – is the brain.

51:12.158 --> 51:14.987
In the brain they have got

51:15.623 --> 51:18.890
these problems and Shri Krishna makes them shake.

51:21.077 --> 51:25.770
It’s the tremors that they feel,
the pins and needles that they feel,

51:25.910 --> 51:30.810
the heat that they feel – all this is central nervous system,

51:31.843 --> 51:33.310
run by brain.

51:34.263 --> 51:42.755
So, after enlightenment, what happens that the brain is at peace,

51:44.167 --> 51:47.003
absolutely at peace with itself.

51:47.617 --> 51:53.122
It doesn’t react as it used to react.

51:53.380 --> 51:58.729
Like I’ve seen people here so speedy, so nervous,

51:59.483 --> 52:03.035
so upset all the time, so jittery, irritable.

52:03.353 --> 52:06.400
I was reading the life of Mao and I was surprised:

52:06.579 --> 52:10.289
his physician, personal physician has said even.

52:10.507 --> 52:16.578
Absolutely like a tyrant and he
used to keep up the faces very well.

52:16.857 --> 52:22.729
But according to this doctor, he was a cruelest man he had known.

52:23.662 --> 52:25.051
This is Mao,

52:26.718 --> 52:33.051
who obviously looked to be a very great reformer,
he did so much for that country, this thing.

52:33.702 --> 52:37.849
But no, he was a hypocrite. How will you know

52:38.206 --> 52:42.035
somebody is a hypocrite or not – with your brain?

52:42.333 --> 52:44.200
Only if you are enlightened.

52:45.309 --> 52:49.714
So, if Shri Krishna penetrates into your brain,

52:49.992 --> 52:54.793
then you become an enlightened person, Sthitha Pragya,

52:55.012 --> 53:00.368
and you become knowledgeable, you know everything,

53:02.393 --> 53:04.388
whatever is necessary.

53:04.865 --> 53:10.499
You may not know who is number one Wimbledon, maybe.

53:11.512 --> 53:16.045
You may not know who is the actress, what is her life, you may not.

53:17.008 --> 53:21.741
You may not know who is the president
of such and such place, maybe.

53:23.535 --> 53:28.972
But you will know whatever is necessary for you to know.

53:29.646 --> 53:32.246
Otherwise people waste their energies.

53:32.485 --> 53:39.032
I know of somebody who knew the telephone numbers

53:39.747 --> 53:48.139
and the car numbers of two thousand people. What is the need?

53:50.858 --> 53:59.113
Something like that,
all these stupid things is a waste of mental energy.

53:59.723 --> 54:04.192
But a Sthitha Pragya does not, he is concentrated

54:04.590 --> 54:10.502
onto his own knowledge, onto the Divine understanding.

54:16.256 --> 54:26.794
He works really like a computer, and such an efficient computer.

54:30.049 --> 54:33.362
Today I just started talking about Kabira.

54:33.878 --> 54:36.812
Immediately they said ”Mother, vibrations!”

54:38.620 --> 54:41.687
Taking the name of Kabira you get vibrations.

54:44.226 --> 54:49.813
But to a normal person nothing, Kabira is nothing, another

54:50.032 --> 54:51.889
romantic fellow.

54:52.841 --> 54:57.308
If they don’t want to understand something, they can say anything.

54:59.627 --> 55:02.360
But only the people who are enlightened,

55:02.941 --> 55:07.027
their nervous system is so charged

55:08.576 --> 55:14.689
that they can feel what is wrong, what is right, they can feel

55:14.927 --> 55:17.943
the Divinity, they can make out

55:18.360 --> 55:22.407
who are incarnations and who were not.

55:24.848 --> 55:30.515
You don’t know what has happened to
your nervous system: a new dimension has come.

55:31.515 --> 55:36.178
Absolutely a new dimension in your nervous system has come,

55:36.377 --> 55:43.082
which is manifesting, and this is also
the blessings of Shri Krishna.

55:44.789 --> 55:48.856
Because He is collectiveness within us,

55:49.392 --> 55:54.551
in the form of collectivity He works.

55:56.813 --> 55:59.746
Unless and until this America is put right,

56:00.851 --> 56:07.140
Shri Krishna is not going to leave my throat, I tell you.

56:08.311 --> 56:18.053
So, as America, I say, is the
place of Shri Krishna’s auspiciousness.

56:22.330 --> 56:27.964
So, one has to understand what is Shri Krishna’s auspiciousness is.

56:29.017 --> 56:31.833
They said He had 16.000 wives,

56:33.123 --> 56:37.805
these were His powers, 16.000 powers He has.

56:39.056 --> 56:42.256
And to work out His incarnation He wanted them.

56:42.806 --> 56:49.330
So, they came on this earth as princesses
and was married by a horrible

56:49.469 --> 56:54.667
king who married them and kept them in the jail.

56:56.096 --> 57:00.896
So, He fought that king and got
them out of them and He married them.

57:03.041 --> 57:08.893
It’s the best part of it: He married them. Because, you see,

57:09.345 --> 57:12.345
with a man, whatever may be his age,

57:12.604 --> 57:16.135
if he has 16.000 women around him,

57:16.650 --> 57:20.519
people will never understand that he is Yogeshwara.

57:20.936 --> 57:24.856
Men have this problem. Not the women so much.

57:25.432 --> 57:31.432
Because women become mothers, you see,
I’m a Mother, nobody can challenge my character.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.880
Because I am a Mother. But the fatherhood can be challenged.

57:38.051 --> 57:39.384
So He married them.

57:39.877 --> 57:43.210
Then the essence of the five elements He married,

57:43.843 --> 57:45.489
as five wives.

57:48.248 --> 57:58.636
But His real sense of morality is seen in the case of Draupadi.

57:59.430 --> 58:01.764
You know the story of Mahabharata,

58:02.902 --> 58:08.061
when She was brought in the court of Duryodhana

58:08.696 --> 58:12.924
(who) asked Dushasana to take out Her saris.

58:15.524 --> 58:20.147
At that time Tulsidas’s written what happened.

58:20.564 --> 58:26.555
She was holding Her saree by Her teeth.

58:27.791 --> 58:31.191
She called ” Krishna “, She could only say ” Kri “,

58:31.317 --> 58:34.205
‘shna’ means full stop, goes wrong.

58:34.345 --> 58:38.279
She is holding on with only ‘Kri’, and wouldn’t say ‘shna’.

58:38.730 --> 58:43.940
But as soon as She said ” Krishna “, the saree fell down.

58:44.434 --> 58:46.033
Then He describes:

58:46.233 --> 58:49.764
“Dwarika yashoda jayo yashoda bhayo bari

58:49.923 --> 58:53.950
shankha chakra gada padma garuda laisi dhary.”

58:54.094 --> 58:56.034
[Unsure. In Shri Krishna Gitavali of Tulsidas ]

58:56.214 --> 58:57.495
What did He do?

58:57.773 --> 59:05.392
When She just said “Krishna”, there was a big sound in Dwarika,

59:05.610 --> 59:07.336
He was in Dwarika.

59:10.531 --> 59:12.388
Immediately,

59:12.884 --> 59:18.499
with “shanka, chakra, gada, padma” – these are His four weapons

59:19.313 --> 59:20.980
– He came on the Garuda.

59:22.943 --> 59:29.106
The way it is said is tremendous,
I mean, I feel really, it fulfils your heart with such

59:29.444 --> 59:35.356
understanding of Shri Krishna. For his own sister,

59:35.793 --> 59:40.951
He came all the way to save Her chastity.

59:41.646 --> 59:47.704
To Him the chastity of His sister was of the greatest importance.

59:47.823 --> 59:50.374
He could have said: ” No, no, no,

59:50.494 --> 59:56.027
I am a king, I have to look after this,
I have to do that, I have to ” – nothing.

59:56.215 --> 59:58.667
If Her chastity is in danger,

59:58.826 --> 01:00:03.111
He came flying on the Garuda and supplied that.

01:00:03.687 --> 01:00:05.822
And this fellow got tired

01:00:05.942 --> 01:00:08.839
pulling out Her saris. I think, he must have borrowed saris from Me

01:00:08.998 --> 01:00:12.410
because I have too many saris.

01:00:12.985 --> 01:00:15.785
One after the other, one after the other,

01:00:15.902 --> 01:00:18.702
he made a pile of saris and he got tired.

01:00:18.799 --> 01:00:20.666
He could not make Her nude.

01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:28.353
The chastity of Draupadi was of such a height.

01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:35.615
And how Shri Krishna tried to save it is remarkable.

01:00:39.564 --> 01:00:47.381
So, this Yogeshwara Shri Krishna is also a Dhanvantari,

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:52.051
means the doctor of doctors.

01:00:52.885 --> 01:00:56.952
He is the One who cures. You see, because it’s all the brain

01:00:58.163 --> 01:01:01.829
– and the vibrations which flow on the nervous system.

01:01:03.738 --> 01:01:10.603
So, He cures people through His brain.

01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:21.659
Now, how? Say now, supposing somebody is having a problem, say

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:29.457
on his heart. So as soon as he puts hands to My photograph,

01:01:32.017 --> 01:01:38.425
so immediately he gets problem on his left finger here.

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:41.024
The brain is working.

01:01:41.719 --> 01:01:48.715
So in your brain, My vibrations go of Shri Krishna

01:01:50.303 --> 01:01:55.739
and they start sending these messages.

01:01:56.533 --> 01:01:58.667
Because I am also Shri Krishna.

01:01:58.925 --> 01:02:01.901
So this computer acts and immediately

01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:06.355
you know what’s wrong with that person is, he is a heart patient.

01:02:08.807 --> 01:02:12.192
You don’t have to do any diagnosis, you don’t have to do anything.

01:02:12.501 --> 01:02:15.813
Immediately you know. And who does this, it’s the

01:02:15.954 --> 01:02:19.421
principle of Shri Krishna in the brain of the Virat.

01:02:20.921 --> 01:02:25.680
See this, also working for some people, I think.

01:02:25.918 --> 01:02:29.237
Now you are convinced about it, you know that it

01:02:29.358 --> 01:02:32.492
works, it acts like this, it happens like that,

01:02:34.664 --> 01:02:38.954
and how it communicates through you.

01:02:39.292 --> 01:02:45.059
So, this computer of Mine communicates.

01:02:45.308 --> 01:02:47.562
Now, in a computer if you go,

01:02:47.703 --> 01:02:50.634
you can just press the button, of course they are all man-made,

01:02:50.754 --> 01:02:53.687
but whatever it is you then get the result.

01:02:53.789 --> 01:03:02.818
Here it is not like that. It is the
brain automatically gives the result,

01:03:02.975 --> 01:03:06.725
immediately, through the other person.

01:03:09.763 --> 01:03:14.861
And also the same brain tells you what is to be done

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:18.040
to such and such person, how to work it out.

01:03:18.949 --> 01:03:22.302
The same brain is emitting vibrations,

01:03:23.275 --> 01:03:28.423
and those vibrations are flowing through this brain,

01:03:30.448 --> 01:03:36.340
and they are the ones who tell you what’s wrong with this person.

01:03:40.368 --> 01:03:47.607
So, all this work of penetration is done by Shri Krishna, no doubt.

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:54.737
He takes these vibrations, puts into another brain,

01:03:54.896 --> 01:03:58.884
and then that brain, that central nervous system starts working

01:03:59.024 --> 01:04:02.357
and then you get the result. But instantaneously,

01:04:03.447 --> 01:04:07.714
it’s not so much time it takes, another way I have described it,

01:04:07.879 --> 01:04:09.682
it just works immediately.

01:04:09.822 --> 01:04:13.488
As soon as they put their hands before Me, immediately!

01:04:17.555 --> 01:04:24.088
So how important it is for us to look after our brain,
for Sahaja Yogis.

01:04:26.737 --> 01:04:32.086
I don’t know in this America how far this brain is safe.

01:04:32.503 --> 01:04:36.570
Because if you open any television, wah wah wah,

01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:40.142
you look outside on the street,

01:04:40.638 --> 01:04:44.050
look out for the – some advertisements

01:04:44.428 --> 01:04:46.650
and you hear this music

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.134
– it breaks your brain completely.

01:04:52.423 --> 01:04:58.037
Whole atmosphere is anti-Shri Krishna.

01:05:01.709 --> 01:05:09.823
No purity of understanding, no sense of morality.

01:05:10.697 --> 01:05:16.129
The way they make pictures, things, horrible violence, horrible,

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.733
I should say, immoral scenes, all sorts of things

01:05:21.328 --> 01:05:25.336
– all created here in the land of Shri Krishna.

01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:36.803
The One who through His waves can completely purify,

01:05:36.997 --> 01:05:44.303
because He’s Yogeshwara, because He is detached,

01:05:45.574 --> 01:05:50.395
absolutely detached, He cannot get attached to anything.

01:05:52.037 --> 01:05:54.370
Only the brain makes you attached.

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:57.660
Now see, supposing this carpet is here.

01:05:58.691 --> 01:06:00.358
This is a saree, is here.

01:06:01.016 --> 01:06:04.616
I look at the saree, and what a nice is this one now.

01:06:05.152 --> 01:06:09.019
Now, if it is mine, I’m worried it should not get spoiled

01:06:10.847 --> 01:06:15.171
and where it will be kept, what will happen to it.

01:06:16.362 --> 01:06:25.501
Goes on worrying about things. Here is any

01:06:25.739 --> 01:06:31.139
more road you walk, there are
shops, shops, shops, shops, shops, shops, shops.

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:38.171
– Attention goes there, and in that attention

01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:41.842
this brain gets involved completely.

01:06:42.854 --> 01:06:51.346
It gets involved, it wants this, and wants that,
and wants that, and wants that -for what?

01:06:52.636 --> 01:06:56.520
So, the detachment from the matter is only possible

01:06:58.227 --> 01:06:59.827
if you know generosity.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.266
But many people are in Sahaja Yoga, but they are not.

01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:11.024
What is generosity now?

01:07:12.631 --> 01:07:16.365
Generosity is now if you like My saree, you’ll have it.

01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.818
That’s the real generosity.

01:07:22.568 --> 01:07:28.041
Whatever I am buying is for you, supposing. So you have it.

01:07:29.748 --> 01:07:34.092
If you have a generous detached temperament,

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:37.926
then you can never get involved with matter.

01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:42.663
And whatever you are involved, it is love.

01:07:43.338 --> 01:07:47.226
Say, I went to Russia,

01:07:48.794 --> 01:07:56.155
and there was nice fish eggs they call as caviar.

01:07:57.027 --> 01:08:00.561
There’s one doctor who likes it very much in London.

01:08:00.778 --> 01:08:03.311
I said: ” Please, let Me have some “.

01:08:03.476 --> 01:08:07.042
They said: ” Why do you want to take this one? ” ” I want to “.

01:08:07.201 --> 01:08:09.661
They thought of the doctor who needed it there

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:13.034
who likes it very much and I felt very happy about that.

01:08:13.153 --> 01:08:15.177
And the doctor also was very happy:

01:08:15.316 --> 01:08:19.049
” Mother, you remember even such small thing like this?

01:08:22.089 --> 01:08:28.220
So, the matter has a sense of giving
very great joy to another person.

01:08:30.276 --> 01:08:34.209
If you do it with love, again, I say: ” Do it with love “,

01:08:35.097 --> 01:08:41.744
not with attachment, but with love which is detached.

01:08:43.589 --> 01:08:51.855
He’s the One who is detached.

01:08:52.827 --> 01:09:00.783
So, what is the love that is detached, I’ve told many a times:

01:09:01.016 --> 01:09:06.821
Like the sap in the tree rises, goes to every part of the tree

01:09:08.508 --> 01:09:10.708
and is not attached to any part.

01:09:12.714 --> 01:09:15.511
And if it gets attached,

01:09:16.783 --> 01:09:21.516
then the tree will die, and that fruit,
whatever it is, will die also.

01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:25.987
So, what is it a detached love is?

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.827
Detached love is the most beautiful thing.

01:09:31.841 --> 01:09:37.339
Firstly, by detached love you know what to give to whom,

01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:44.284
what will make people happy, what will make them joyous,

01:09:44.701 --> 01:09:46.716
what do they like.

01:09:47.173 --> 01:09:50.705
– In love only you know these things, – what do they like,

01:09:50.863 --> 01:09:59.296
what is their colour, style, what they want. Little, little things.

01:10:01.122 --> 01:10:04.322
As I told you yesterday the story of Shri Rama,

01:10:05.725 --> 01:10:12.551
whatever is done with love, even a little thing that you know

01:10:13.405 --> 01:10:17.338
you would like, I would like to purchase, may look stupid.

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:20.590
But I know you like it, so I’ll buy that.

01:10:22.254 --> 01:10:24.588
In the same way, you also do that.

01:10:26.022 --> 01:10:29.825
All the time you think ” Mother, what will She like?”

01:10:29.945 --> 01:10:33.011
So, you look for little things here and there.

01:10:35.505 --> 01:10:40.060
But this detachment has to be full and complete.

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:45.979
Then only you really get people attached to you,
otherwise you cannot.

01:10:46.291 --> 01:10:50.224
If you are not detached, you cannot get

01:10:51.362 --> 01:10:54.358
that complete love for another person.

01:10:54.636 --> 01:10:58.675
Because if you are doing something, say, for money,

01:11:00.799 --> 01:11:03.465
or if you are doing something for lust,

01:11:04.549 --> 01:11:10.223
or for greed, or for some sort of a position, it has no meaning.

01:11:11.235 --> 01:11:16.168
People know
”Oh, I know why he is doing it, because I am such and such“.

01:11:18.092 --> 01:11:22.715
In Sahaja Yoga also many people come either to make money,

01:11:22.993 --> 01:11:25.793
either to get cured, all kinds of things.

01:11:27.914 --> 01:11:30.195
But if you are detached,

01:11:32.239 --> 01:11:35.632
then only Sahaja Yoga will spread.

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:43.285
As long as there are attachments,
you should know that you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

01:11:44.204 --> 01:11:50.604
I am not saying ”You take out your eye or cut your hands”
I didn’t say that, to that extent.

01:11:51.466 --> 01:11:55.216
What I’m saying: you should introspect and see:

01:11:55.672 --> 01:11:59.220
”How much am I attached to this or to that,

01:11:59.419 --> 01:12:04.935
and why am I so much attached, what does it matter?”

01:12:05.371 --> 01:12:07.637
Always, as a result of attachment

01:12:07.851 --> 01:12:10.184
you’ll always find disappointments.

01:12:10.352 --> 01:12:15.685
I’ve seen parents who have doted on
their child, loved their child, this, that.

01:12:16.066 --> 01:12:19.736
Children mostly go astray.

01:12:22.477 --> 01:12:25.677
But if you have a detached love for your child,

01:12:26.267 --> 01:12:30.306
you do nice things for the child.

01:12:30.482 --> 01:12:37.282
At the same time, you know when to say ‘no’,
when it is not good. ” This I don’t like, don’t do it “,

01:12:37.767 --> 01:12:39.882
you must say that.

01:12:43.433 --> 01:12:46.786
But detachment is even wider than that.

01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:52.540
Like some people are very fond of food.

01:12:54.378 --> 01:12:55.378
So,

01:12:57.493 --> 01:13:01.520
to say that you be detached from food is very difficult for them.

01:13:02.115 --> 01:13:06.631
Specially, at a certain age, I think, they are very fond of good

01:13:07.069 --> 01:13:11.901
food and all that. Gandhiji has talked about Aswad:

01:13:12.239 --> 01:13:14.306
you should not have any taste.

01:13:14.878 --> 01:13:19.945
But as you grow in Sahaja Yoga,
you’ll find automatically it will happen.

01:13:21.545 --> 01:13:24.678
All your fascination about food will drop out.

01:13:26.088 --> 01:13:30.488
That is another sign that you are absolutely detached about food.

01:13:30.903 --> 01:13:35.703
Now, today I had My lunch,
I don’t know whether it is dinner or lunch,

01:13:35.904 --> 01:13:38.026
’cause I had it at about five o’clock,

01:13:38.182 --> 01:13:41.116
so I don’t know wich part of the day it is.

01:13:41.261 --> 01:13:44.861
And if I don’t eat, it also makes no difference to Me,

01:13:46.261 --> 01:13:49.872
it doesn’t make Me weak or in any way unhappy.

01:13:52.586 --> 01:13:58.292
But thinking about food is just spoiling your brain.

01:13:59.248 --> 01:14:01.582
Many people just think about food.

01:14:01.764 --> 01:14:05.455
We went to their house: ” Oh, they had made such nice things.

01:14:05.555 --> 01:14:08.272
“We went to this house ” They’ve made such nice things.”

01:14:08.432 --> 01:14:12.280
What’s the use? You already have eaten, finished, now, done.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.933
Now, why are you thinking about that?

01:14:15.803 --> 01:14:20.536
Or: ” I went to somebody’s house,
they had given me a horrible food.

01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:24.374
” Why to think of food, I still don’t understand.

01:14:24.955 --> 01:14:27.355
Whatever has happened has happened.

01:14:27.518 --> 01:14:31.451
By thinking you cannot get back what you have been eating,

01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:33.630
or what you are going to eat.

01:14:33.753 --> 01:14:37.880
It’s there, whatever is there you have to eat, you see,
what can you do?

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:42.404
For example, today, they asked Me:
”Mother, will you have hot dog?"

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:46.882
In Hindi language it means real hot dog – means:

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:50.156
garam kupte – they call that.

01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:54.322
I said ” All right, I’ll have it “.

01:14:54.482 --> 01:14:59.882
They said ” All the Americans eat. ”
” All right, I am an american, give Me “.

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:06.150
But when you know something will not
do good for your teeth or something, you should not eat.

01:15:06.567 --> 01:15:10.119
For example, the beef is very bad for the teeth, very bad.

01:15:10.314 --> 01:15:13.084
That’s why you people loose your teeth very fast.

01:15:13.223 --> 01:15:18.532
Many people ask Me in the interview ”
Are your denture your own? ” I said: ” Of course, Mine “.

01:15:19.803 --> 01:15:21.803
They can’t believe it’s Mine.

01:15:22.898 --> 01:15:26.365
Because I know what not to eat for the teeth’s sake.

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:32.124
But one should not be attached to an idea,

01:15:32.639 --> 01:15:34.952
that’s even subtler attachments.

01:15:35.092 --> 01:15:38.655
That has really killed this world with so many problems of

01:15:38.775 --> 01:15:42.278
fanaticism, racialism, I don’t know what.

01:15:43.782 --> 01:15:46.916
Now, here, see the contradictions people have:

01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:51.133
they go to the sea to get darker, and they have racialism.

01:15:52.398 --> 01:15:54.521
Why do you go to the sea?

01:15:54.937 --> 01:15:57.545
If you go to become darker,

01:15:57.686 --> 01:16:00.686
then why do you hate the people who are dark?

01:16:02.051 --> 01:16:06.745
Such a contradiction because the brain is not in balance.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.335
And for that you have racialism,

01:16:12.479 --> 01:16:13.947
you become racist.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.483
If not that, you have another conditioning that

01:16:19.662 --> 01:16:24.995
there are different casts and according to the cast,
you should go, in India.

01:16:25.835 --> 01:16:30.768
How can there be any cast when everybody
has the Spirit in their heart.

01:16:31.842 --> 01:16:36.909
They won’t eat from another lower cast,
they are higher cast, this, that.

01:16:37.973 --> 01:16:42.695
This brain is the one which creates all kinds of conditionings,

01:16:42.984 --> 01:16:46.516
and all those great Saints who have lived on this earth,

01:16:46.616 --> 01:16:49.552
wether they were in India or abroad or anywhere,

01:16:49.751 --> 01:16:54.552
all of them have stood against this nonsense of discrimination.

01:16:55.107 --> 01:16:58.539
That comes from brain, you know, ask them

01:16:58.679 --> 01:17:02.905
” Why do you think like that, you are higher than others? ”

01:17:03.103 --> 01:17:05.961
Like the germans think they are the highest race.

01:17:06.108 --> 01:17:08.580
Now, who will believe that bull story, I don’t know?

01:17:08.699 --> 01:17:10.921
It is absolutely nonsensical story:

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:16.072
germans, the ones who have killed children in the gas chamber

01:17:16.212 --> 01:17:21.211
and enjoyed that, they must be the lowest race ever going!

01:17:23.394 --> 01:17:27.977
But they think they are the highest race! How can they be?

01:17:28.571 --> 01:17:31.658
Tomorrow, Rwanda people will say: ” We are the highest race,

01:17:31.779 --> 01:17:35.245
because we can kill each other nicely in the open. ”

01:17:38.466 --> 01:17:42.532
So, to think yourself to be higher than others,

01:17:42.692 --> 01:17:48.068
to think that you’re more beautiful than others, others are ugly

01:17:49.001 --> 01:17:55.046
– all this is the brain which takes you to ego,

01:17:56.654 --> 01:18:00.920
and the ego is the one who befools you completely all the time.

01:18:02.447 --> 01:18:04.514
That’s the job of Shri Krishna.

01:18:05.622 --> 01:18:08.489
The story you must have heard about Narada

01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:12.399
who never wanted to see, who thought he was a great man

01:18:12.515 --> 01:18:17.047
because he was never attracted to a woman,
and he was challenging even Shiva.

01:18:18.734 --> 01:18:23.067
Then Shri Krishna played a trick on him, He always plays tricks.

01:18:23.238 --> 01:18:28.873
He sent two Gandharvas to tease him.

01:18:29.427 --> 01:18:32.627
They went down and they asked Narada. They said

01:18:32.782 --> 01:18:36.164
” You are such a beautiful man, such a handsome person,

01:18:36.304 --> 01:18:39.894
there is a marriage going on of a lady [Rupoghadi, UNCLEAR]

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:42.291
she is very beautiful, she is a princess

01:18:42.411 --> 01:18:45.823
and why don’t you go there, she’ll definitely marry you.

01:18:45.962 --> 01:18:50.962
” And they pampered his ego, you see,
such a lot, he started floating in the air.

01:18:51.121 --> 01:18:55.525
And he said ”All right, I am going to go there, I am so handsome.”

01:18:55.744 --> 01:19:02.560
Ego. He went there, and this princess came out with a garland.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:06.845
She looked at him and she giggled first and then she laughed aloud

01:19:07.049 --> 01:19:08.649
and then she went away.

01:19:09.564 --> 01:19:12.401
He couldn’t understand, looked at these two persons,

01:19:12.659 --> 01:19:18.036
they said ”It’s all right, now, it doesn’t matter,
maybe somebody is better looking, then you.”

01:19:18.552 --> 01:19:22.857
So, Narada was very angry, he went to the lake.

01:19:23.317 --> 01:19:27.183
When he looked into the lake, his face was like a monkey.

01:19:29.537 --> 01:19:34.159
He’s become a monkey because this ego makes you a monkey.

01:19:35.286 --> 01:19:40.910
And you start thinking: ah, you are great,
you are very beautiful, you are this thing, that thing…

01:19:41.050 --> 01:19:42.116
But you are not.

01:19:43.431 --> 01:19:45.897
Because if you are, you won’t think.

01:19:47.456 --> 01:19:54.256
Whatever you are, you don’t think about it. You don’t think:
”I am a human being“, do you say that?

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:58.544
Or do you say ” I have no tails “, do you boast of that?

01:19:58.941 --> 01:20:02.465
Whatever you are not, then you boast: ” I am very beautiful,

01:20:02.664 --> 01:20:06.017
I am very good looking, others are ugly, this thing “.

01:20:06.136 --> 01:20:10.679
Then Shri Krishna plays a part through the Maya,

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:15.443
and He gives a big lesson to that person.

01:20:17.815 --> 01:20:18.815
It happens.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:23.469
So, never think that you are something great,

01:20:23.807 --> 01:20:27.873
or you have achieved this in life and achieved that in life,

01:20:29.819 --> 01:20:34.025
and that you are something a big Johnny.

01:20:34.679 --> 01:20:41.179
Nothing, it’s nothing but the ego that has moved on here

01:20:42.191 --> 01:20:44.991
and giving you these ideas, from the ego.

01:20:45.763 --> 01:20:48.163
And if you go even further with it,

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:54.988
then Hitler may enter into your ego and you might behave like him.

01:20:55.465 --> 01:21:01.122
Or if you are conditioned, impossible to tell you anything.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:06.142
Like this Hari Rama fellow I told you
”Why do you wear dhoti in this cold weather?”

01:21:06.281 --> 01:21:09.328
He said ” My guru has told me to wear dhoti “.

01:21:09.495 --> 01:21:11.590
”So what sort of a guru is it,

01:21:11.709 --> 01:21:14.031
that he makes you feel cold. I mean, I am a Mother,

01:21:14.215 --> 01:21:16.177
I don’t like all this nonsense.”

01:21:16.293 --> 01:21:18.773
He said ” No, but my guru has said “.

01:21:19.726 --> 01:21:23.356
What a conditioning! And conditioning

01:21:23.582 --> 01:21:28.534
for something which is absolutely absurd and ridiculous.

01:21:29.427 --> 01:21:34.347
Now see, Americans are most vulnerable to such a thing.

01:21:35.886 --> 01:21:38.079
You start any nonsense,

01:21:38.210 --> 01:21:41.657
immediately the Americans are the first to jump on it, immediately.

01:21:41.796 --> 01:21:47.768
Drugs you start, you start some sort of a,

01:21:48.615 --> 01:21:52.212
I can say, fancy dress.

01:21:52.927 --> 01:21:56.394
It will start in Paris but will be sold in America.

01:21:57.372 --> 01:22:01.172
Immediately. There are on the look-out of something new.

01:22:01.627 --> 01:22:04.894
It might be a monkey trick, but they will do it.

01:22:05.536 --> 01:22:11.805
I don’t know why Americans who are the residents of

01:22:11.965 --> 01:22:17.420
Shri Krishna’s land have no discretion at all,

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:20.833
what to accept, what not to accept.

01:22:21.825 --> 01:22:25.765
They are the worst, they are worse than children even,

01:22:25.882 --> 01:22:29.972
there is no maturity of any kind: ” What’s wrong? ”

01:22:33.742 --> 01:22:39.388
So, the discretion which is the center we have here of Hamsa

01:22:39.766 --> 01:22:47.801
which is ruled by Vishuddhi, is completely sometimes blocked.

01:22:49.071 --> 01:22:53.813
Like one lady who came to America told Me very boastfully: ”

01:22:55.326 --> 01:22:58.929
Have you been to the pubs in England? ” I said ” No.

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:05.080
Why? ” ” Oh, my God, what pubs you have here! You know,

01:23:05.298 --> 01:23:08.164
I went to the best ” I said ” Which one? ”

01:23:08.295 --> 01:23:11.866
“It’s known as Hermit’s pub ”

01:23:12.124 --> 01:23:17.104
” What is so special? ” Very high class lady, very high class

01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:20.645
– she says: ” You see, one man died,

01:23:20.824 --> 01:23:22.947
for one month nobody lifted the body,

01:23:23.066 --> 01:23:25.933
the whole thing was filled with the stink.

01:23:26.221 --> 01:23:27.954
So the stink is preserved

01:23:28.383 --> 01:23:31.558
and even the cowwebs are preserved as they are there.

01:23:31.777 --> 01:23:34.514
Such a great thing was this: in,

01:23:34.693 --> 01:23:39.693
when I went, and really I felt so spiritual there?

01:23:43.471 --> 01:23:46.987
” Then she started boasting ” You see, we are free people.

01:23:47.206 --> 01:23:52.007
I allow my children to drink. I give them drinks.

01:23:54.150 --> 01:23:58.617
” I said: ” Really? ” ” Yeah, I can give them any alcohol, anyone.

01:23:58.773 --> 01:24:02.344
I do not say ‘not this, not that’ – no, they can have “.

01:24:02.523 --> 01:24:06.657
The children who were hardly twelve and forteen years of age.

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:11.964
I said ” All right, if you have been doing that,

01:24:12.421 --> 01:24:14.954
what can I say? You are a great lady,

01:24:15.119 --> 01:24:20.919
I would not do to my children or to my grandchildren,
but you are great, namaskar “.

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:23.603
After three, four months, we heard

01:24:24.107 --> 01:24:27.361
that there was a birthday party of the younger boy

01:24:27.515 --> 01:24:32.103
and she had given all these alcohols to them for the friends.

01:24:33.666 --> 01:24:36.520
God knows what happened – they had candles and this and that

01:24:36.699 --> 01:24:43.822
– the whole house got burnt and all the children, her sons

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.445
and these two sleeping upstairs, all got burnt and died.

01:24:53.664 --> 01:24:56.084
Boasting about nonsense,

01:24:57.037 --> 01:25:01.689
like: ” I have had five hundred men with me “.

01:25:02.503 --> 01:25:05.437
Another will say: ” I have so many women. ”

01:25:05.658 --> 01:25:12.344
I mean, you are stupid fools because you are organizing

01:25:12.722 --> 01:25:17.166
nice way to go to hell, and you are all going to go to hell,

01:25:17.523 --> 01:25:22.483
this is what it is to be told to them. If you go on like this,

01:25:22.741 --> 01:25:24.408
what will happen to you?

01:25:24.815 --> 01:25:28.015
Accumulating everything that will destroy them,

01:25:28.645 --> 01:25:33.378
doing everything that will destroy.
” Oh that’s good!” I said ” Why? ”

01:25:33.664 --> 01:25:40.410
” You know, if you take that, then in two minutes you go off. ”

01:25:40.589 --> 01:25:43.322
I said: ” To where? To hell, or where? “.

01:25:45.093 --> 01:25:50.360
Anything that is destructive,
I don’t know why the Americans should accept it,

01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:54.031
when they have Shri Krisna as their Lord.

01:25:57.583 --> 01:26:00.583
It is to be understood by Sahaja Yogis also,

01:26:01.115 --> 01:26:05.460
that you have to really transform
you have to serve to such an extent

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:09.619
that what it is, whatever is destructive should be given up.

01:26:12.759 --> 01:26:14.258
First of all,

01:26:14.515 --> 01:26:18.382
I find some men and ladies with such long faces, you know.

01:26:20.437 --> 01:26:25.290
How can you be? You are living in the country of Leeladhara.

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:28.890
He is the One who made everybody dance,

01:26:29.576 --> 01:26:34.893
and He is the One who sprayed Ras, Ra is energy, Dha is with

01:26:35.767 --> 01:26:40.163
– Ra-Dha. Ra is energy, the One who sustains energy.

01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:47.544
The One who did the mental energy enlightened and to sustain it,

01:26:47.862 --> 01:26:52.395
how can you people take to adharma,

01:26:52.733 --> 01:26:56.666
to immorality, and to destruction, I just can’t understand.

01:26:59.736 --> 01:27:04.022
I don’t know what are His plans are, very well,

01:27:04.668 --> 01:27:09.668
but He has to really save people of America from

01:27:09.808 --> 01:27:13.453
all kinds of nonsense they do morning till evening.

01:27:15.279 --> 01:27:19.346
There’s nobody who is sensible in the politics,

01:27:20.061 --> 01:27:25.556
nobody who has a good character at a very high positions,

01:27:25.748 --> 01:27:29.604
what sort of things! You cannot get one man

01:27:29.815 --> 01:27:34.548
whom you can say he is all right
and he will do good to your nation.

01:27:36.788 --> 01:27:39.388
Criticizing others, they are very good.

01:27:39.585 --> 01:27:42.585
Like we had this plague, this thing not much

01:27:42.721 --> 01:27:47.958
– this little bit came out,
they have published it all over these media,

01:27:48.375 --> 01:27:53.355
they’ve stopped all our ships,
stopped all our aeroplanes, made such a fuss,

01:27:53.494 --> 01:27:56.765
put us into so much trouble – what about your AIDS,

01:27:56.904 --> 01:27:59.571
which you are giving Prasad everywhere.

01:28:02.658 --> 01:28:09.403
It’s very surprising that with your brain
enlightened by Shri Krishna,

01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:13.610
how could people accept even mentally

01:28:13.967 --> 01:28:18.068
– person like Freud. How could you accept Freud?

01:28:18.466 --> 01:28:20.132
I just can’t understand.

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:25.087
And now you are all ruined. So, now we are worried.

01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:28.048
They don’t what to do. Now they are breaking families,

01:28:28.168 --> 01:28:33.635
and all the logical conclusions
they reach is just the opposite of Shri Krishna.

01:28:33.873 --> 01:28:35.610
Like this Simpson killed his wife.

01:28:35.711 --> 01:28:38.587
All right, he killed, finished, this Simpson business.

01:28:38.775 --> 01:28:43.191
Now they are coming out big theories, see now: why psychologically

01:28:43.331 --> 01:28:46.131
he killed, because he was married to her.

01:28:46.485 --> 01:28:50.056
When you marry only you kill your wife or your husband.

01:28:50.236 --> 01:28:53.369
– So, you should not marry: what a conclusion!

01:28:54.084 --> 01:28:57.666
Tomorrow they’ll say that people are killing each other,

01:28:57.815 --> 01:29:00.624
so allow them to have weapons in their hand.

01:29:00.724 --> 01:29:04.324
Now, they want to allow them to have some drugs also.

01:29:05.505 --> 01:29:09.705
Allow them to have homosexuality, allow them to have all this.

01:29:10.585 --> 01:29:15.088
Because, I think, these people in charge of affairs

01:29:15.346 --> 01:29:19.084
do not want anybody to live,

01:29:20.214 --> 01:29:23.028
think that ” Let them fight among themselves, do what they like,

01:29:23.150 --> 01:29:25.075
we should have our own seats. ”

01:29:25.231 --> 01:29:28.853
The way they are not worried about the immorality

01:29:29.033 --> 01:29:35.679
and all the destructive forces
that are acting on American children,

01:29:36.255 --> 01:29:42.564
american youth and american people, not bothered about them.

01:29:44.977 --> 01:29:57.020
So, tonight we are praising Shri Krishna who is Yogeshwara.

01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:03.880
He eats but He does not eat. He sleeps but He does not sleep.

01:30:05.604 --> 01:30:14.703
He has wives but He has no wife. Like this is the Yogeshwara,

01:30:15.101 --> 01:30:18.834
and that is what you are Yogis, and He is your Ishwara,

01:30:18.970 --> 01:30:21.303
so, you have to try to be like Him.

01:30:21.674 --> 01:30:26.686
Let your brain be enlightened by His blessings.

01:30:26.845 --> 01:30:31.512
And you’ll become that great personality
that encompasses everything,

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.786
that sees everything, that gives you discretion,

01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:39.015
that makes you understand what’s wrong.

01:30:39.226 --> 01:30:45.281
And you feel enthousiastic about changing this America

01:30:45.638 --> 01:30:49.130
with all your efforts, with all the mind.

01:30:49.309 --> 01:30:52.066
That’s the most important thing you have to do.

01:30:52.281 --> 01:31:00.281
As it is, He is a Kubera, He is the Lord of Wealth

01:31:00.638 --> 01:31:03.051
and He has given you such a lot of

01:31:03.309 --> 01:31:06.176
wealth all around, you see, just very near

01:31:06.621 --> 01:31:10.021
New York, you should have such a beautiful places.

01:31:10.214 --> 01:31:14.102
In every way, you are blessed: you have money,

01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:16.735
you have everything, you have brains.

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:20.140
Everything is there. What is lacking is wisdom,

01:31:22.615 --> 01:31:24.872
with everything, with you. Supposing,

01:31:25.567 --> 01:31:28.483
you have a car.

01:31:29.893 --> 01:31:35.281
You’re having a car, you have got keys,
you have got engine, you have brake,

01:31:35.415 --> 01:31:40.618
everything, but you don’t know how to drive, so what will happen?

01:31:43.482 --> 01:31:44.815
This is what it is.

01:31:45.407 --> 01:31:53.045
So, as Sahaja Yogis from America,
you have a very, very, very special responsibility,

01:31:53.978 --> 01:31:55.978
very special responsibility.

01:31:56.399 --> 01:32:01.265
Today we’ll be saying His hundred
and eight names which are well-done,

01:32:02.507 --> 01:32:04.774
have come from Poona all the way.

01:32:05.582 --> 01:32:11.812
So that we’ll have it first and then a little Puja of the Devi.

01:32:12.963 --> 01:32:14.649
May God bless you!
