00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:18,994
Shri Mataji found this place called
Ganapatipule about 18 or 19 years ago

2
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:29,212
and there is a very Holy temple of Shri 
Ganesha, who is the main deity that's

3
00:00:29,212 --> 00:00:37,267
worshipped in Maharashtra and She said,
"Look, we'll all go over there." We were

4
00:00:37,267 --> 00:00:45,302
not many. I think, we were barely a couple
of hundred people and She told me,

5
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:53,299
"We'll go over here and, I think, you find that
everybody will go very deep," and that was true.

6
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:59,711
We came over here the very first time and
we had 6 or 7 days of programs, we were

7
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:07,059
at the nearby village and this is now
grown year after year wherein many more

8
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:12,452
people come; Now you have six, eight thousand
people and the idea is to bring people

9
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:18,480
together to meditate but most of all, for
people to have some proximity to Shri Mataji.
