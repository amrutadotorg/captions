WEBVTT

00:13.550 --> 00:24.260
we on earth understand God with our

00:18.869 --> 00:30.440
earthly understanding we understand him

00:24.260 --> 00:37.110
through our mind through our imagination

00:30.440 --> 00:45.150
through our books and other things where

00:37.110 --> 00:51.769
he's described as such answer there is a

00:45.150 --> 00:54.870
big big mystic God and His divine power

00:51.769 --> 01:00.150
it's a big mystery mystery for all the

00:54.870 --> 01:09.659
human beings and you cannot concede with

01:00.150 --> 01:14.570
your limited mind the working of God's

01:09.659 --> 01:22.220
divine power he is also very mysterious

01:14.570 --> 01:22.220
whatever we call mysterious means that

01:23.660 --> 01:32.900
it is beyond our mind we cannot conceive

01:27.840 --> 01:40.800
it in our life this power of love is

01:32.900 --> 01:44.970
variously what we think is love is not

01:40.800 --> 01:52.760
the way he grabs us or his power of

01:44.970 --> 01:52.760
compassion his power of forgiveness is

01:53.240 --> 01:59.700
extremely mysterious for us because we

01:55.590 --> 02:01.950
are so imperfect because of our

01:59.700 --> 02:07.159
imperfection it cannot understand the

02:01.950 --> 02:10.489
person who is absolute who is perfect

02:07.159 --> 02:14.700
when we seek Him we see through our

02:10.489 --> 02:17.519
imperfections and that's how we form our

02:14.700 --> 02:19.819
ideas according to our own imperfections

02:17.519 --> 02:19.819
about

02:22.680 --> 02:36.190
say for a small little ant if you have

02:28.810 --> 02:41.099
to convey the political issue that is

02:36.190 --> 02:41.099
facing Britain today is it possible

02:43.410 --> 02:50.830
because for the poor little act it is

02:47.890 --> 02:53.340
not even conceivable that we have a mind

02:50.830 --> 02:56.860
which thinks which has the imagination

02:53.340 --> 03:00.760
which projects like an octopus was all

02:56.860 --> 03:03.190
wrong that just these catches that it

03:00.760 --> 03:05.920
cannot even understand that we have a

03:03.190 --> 03:06.730
kind of a freedom by which we can do

03:05.920 --> 03:12.670
what we like

03:06.730 --> 03:16.780
the conception cannot be contained in

03:12.670 --> 03:24.340
that little mind of little head of that

03:16.780 --> 03:27.639
tiny creature but the difference between

03:24.340 --> 03:34.690
an ant and a human being is that ant has

03:27.639 --> 03:38.530
no ego now the probability human beings

03:34.690 --> 03:41.109
is that despite the same core

03:38.530 --> 03:45.880
relationship or we can say despite the

03:41.109 --> 03:52.690
same parallel as a human being and God

03:45.880 --> 03:57.880
an ant and man top the whole thing is

03:52.690 --> 04:03.819
the ego part which in a way makes us

03:57.880 --> 04:11.049
even lower than an act because our

04:03.819 --> 04:12.970
reception is so cool that we cannot see

04:11.049 --> 04:18.130
that there must be something mysterious

04:12.970 --> 04:24.729
about what God has to be a mystery for

04:18.130 --> 04:27.250
human beings I have to understand the

04:24.729 --> 04:32.590
mystery we have to enter into a new

04:27.250 --> 04:35.010
realm more than what we can really

04:32.590 --> 04:39.160
understand with his human awareness

04:35.010 --> 04:40.990
there has to be another plane from which

04:39.160 --> 04:45.490
we should try to see this mystery

04:40.990 --> 04:51.040
because we cannot understand anything

04:45.490 --> 04:53.470
about how he does it I didn't see now in

04:51.040 --> 04:58.210
chemistry if you see the periodical laws

04:53.470 --> 05:02.950
that exist it's fantastic absolutely fun

04:58.210 --> 05:05.950
that look at a little amoeba how it

05:02.950 --> 05:10.720
abscent look at small animals who live

05:05.950 --> 05:15.850
in the rivers and who live in the seas

05:10.720 --> 05:20.350
the number of creatures that are living

05:15.850 --> 05:22.960
harmoniously not like human beings but

05:20.350 --> 05:34.450
quite harmoniously accepting each

05:22.960 --> 05:39.670
other's demand even on the life so with

05:34.450 --> 05:46.480
his freedom and such a big mystery and a

05:39.670 --> 05:50.920
big ego in between is difficult for us

05:46.480 --> 05:56.320
to conceive his greatness his compassion

05:50.920 --> 06:01.240
his life that whatever he does is for

05:56.320 --> 06:03.220
the betterment for of our spirit even if

06:01.240 --> 06:08.920
he killed someone it is for the

06:03.220 --> 06:11.130
betterment of the Spirit even if he

06:08.920 --> 06:14.440
thrashes someone and throws him down

06:11.130 --> 06:18.490
many hills it is for the betterment of

06:14.440 --> 06:20.650
this way Mary puts you to problems and

06:18.490 --> 06:25.900
troubles it is for the betterment of

06:20.650 --> 06:29.350
your spirit anything that happens to you

06:25.900 --> 06:34.960
is a testing ground for the betterment

06:29.350 --> 06:40.780
of your spirit he is working day in and

06:34.960 --> 06:43.130
day out just to improve your awareness

06:40.780 --> 06:47.910
in your spirit

06:43.130 --> 06:50.820
to feel your spirit everything the

06:47.910 --> 06:54.169
nature the beauty everything is worth

06:50.820 --> 06:58.320
little so that you the human beings

06:54.169 --> 07:03.919
should feel his Beauty should know him

06:58.320 --> 07:03.919
in your own awareness should feel the

07:04.940 --> 07:14.130
vibrant love of God for ages it has been

07:11.039 --> 07:18.240
worked out imagine since this world was

07:14.130 --> 07:20.280
created till today with various

07:18.240 --> 07:24.750
incarnations who came on this earth to

07:20.280 --> 07:28.050
the present live to talk about him to

07:24.750 --> 07:38.190
work about him to improve our different

07:28.050 --> 07:41.009
centers within us and then suddenly when

07:38.190 --> 07:46.889
we were faced face to face we can't

07:41.009 --> 07:49.530
believe that it can happen within the

07:46.889 --> 07:53.250
mixture of fighting ego and super-ego

07:49.530 --> 07:57.030
but first of all we cannot believe

07:53.250 --> 08:05.159
ourselves that we are capable of getting

07:57.030 --> 08:09.590
realization and secondly I think that we

08:05.159 --> 08:15.449
are afraid to get realized

08:09.590 --> 08:21.840
thirdly we do not trust anyone who talks

08:15.449 --> 08:27.000
of realization the third world is a good

08:21.840 --> 08:30.389
idea not trusting but at least trust

08:27.000 --> 08:32.070
yourself you start from that point we

08:30.389 --> 08:33.539
first yourself that you should get your

08:32.070 --> 08:38.010
realization otherwise why do you call

08:33.539 --> 08:41.969
you are a seeker you have to get your

08:38.010 --> 08:46.610
realization or doubt about it but when

08:41.969 --> 08:46.610
it comes to trust whom do we trust

08:49.480 --> 08:54.650
say for example when Christ said that

08:52.100 --> 08:58.160
God is my father he has sent me

08:54.650 --> 09:00.200
specially to do this work we couldn't

08:58.160 --> 09:02.060
believe it this man is son of a

09:00.200 --> 09:11.080
carpenter problem like this better

09:02.060 --> 09:11.080
crucifying and our compassion went to a

09:11.110 --> 09:21.680
confirmed thief than to the adoration of

09:19.370 --> 09:24.070
the Son of God now when he died of

09:21.680 --> 09:27.830
course his son of God the Holy Ghost

09:24.070 --> 09:29.960
everything stops I mean any normal then

09:27.830 --> 09:31.760
people start believing I don't know why

09:29.960 --> 09:37.790
they even today believe that you know

09:31.760 --> 09:40.550
son of God why do they believe even the

09:37.790 --> 09:43.130
Holy Ghost I mean even the Bible why

09:40.550 --> 09:44.290
should we believe what is the authority

09:43.130 --> 09:47.720
of Bible

09:44.290 --> 09:49.400
how many slam can ask that question then

09:47.720 --> 09:50.780
ask a question what is the authority of

09:49.400 --> 09:52.520
Bible why do you believe in facts

09:50.780 --> 09:53.990
I mean if you take out the Bible they

09:52.520 --> 09:56.450
say what is the authority they may say

09:53.990 --> 10:04.190
Christ is the authority but tries them a

09:56.450 --> 10:09.890
road Babel so what if the authority is

10:04.190 --> 10:10.640
your own ego you want to believe in want

10:09.890 --> 10:13.840
to believe in it

10:10.640 --> 10:18.050
that's all you want to believe that

10:13.840 --> 10:20.540
helps to sort of many questions because

10:18.050 --> 10:26.450
anything happens you say alright it's

10:20.540 --> 10:29.000
God's wish because we can use him better

10:26.450 --> 10:31.160
when he was crucified before that he

10:29.000 --> 10:37.670
cannot use it because he was independent

10:31.160 --> 10:40.100
he was living there when he died is very

10:37.670 --> 10:44.149
handy so we accept him

10:40.100 --> 10:47.480
we do not question was that a mistake

10:44.149 --> 10:49.779
for him to say that he was the son of

10:47.480 --> 10:49.779
God

10:50.589 --> 10:57.410
knitting it was a mistake that Christ

10:52.910 --> 10:59.360
said that he was the son of God because

10:57.410 --> 11:02.569
of that he was crucified do you think it

10:59.360 --> 11:13.220
was a mistake that he said the truth

11:02.569 --> 11:16.100
about himself would you say that how how

11:13.220 --> 11:17.600
can you justify he saying see if he was

11:16.100 --> 11:19.490
crucified for that then he was

11:17.600 --> 11:20.209
indiscriminate one would say that to say

11:19.490 --> 11:22.130
such a thing

11:20.209 --> 11:23.990
there was no discrimination it was not

11:22.130 --> 11:26.930
wise to say after all you would have

11:23.990 --> 11:29.389
lived longer you know spend better time

11:26.930 --> 11:32.660
with his mother you could have built a

11:29.389 --> 11:34.790
house or something like that you know a

11:32.660 --> 11:41.089
mosque some money or some sort of a very

11:34.790 --> 11:46.639
important thing you would have done but

11:41.089 --> 11:50.569
there's the mystery that's the mystery

11:46.639 --> 11:52.670
we do not know because we want to see it

11:50.569 --> 11:54.980
from our angle and as a point he just

11:52.670 --> 11:57.079
give it and he don't justify then we do

11:54.980 --> 11:58.880
not rationalize it at a point we just

11:57.079 --> 12:03.769
give up oh it's all right

11:58.880 --> 12:05.300
he's got we need your point there you

12:03.769 --> 12:07.550
say all right he was on a lot with you

12:05.300 --> 12:10.630
whatever you wanted you did not already

12:07.550 --> 12:17.750
for proper how are we to judge but now

12:10.630 --> 12:19.370
not when you get I must say God eternity

12:17.750 --> 12:28.069
but human beings are great atmosphere

12:19.370 --> 12:30.430
and God to me at least I mean they know

12:28.069 --> 12:35.769
how far to go and how to switch off

12:30.430 --> 12:35.769
suddenly to something oh that's divine

12:37.569 --> 12:41.750
after your point they go on

12:39.889 --> 12:45.459
rationalizing intellectualizing

12:41.750 --> 12:45.459
and then this opacity:1 finished

12:48.060 --> 12:54.690
none of you have seen him walking on the

12:50.640 --> 12:58.650
water did you not he being resurrected

12:54.690 --> 13:01.890
none of you so why should we believe

12:58.650 --> 13:12.300
that he did that with the question we

13:01.890 --> 13:13.560
should ask ourselves what he did that he

13:12.300 --> 13:19.680
was the son of God

13:13.560 --> 13:22.680
but how are we to believe into it you

13:19.680 --> 13:28.020
have to become something more to know

13:22.680 --> 13:32.570
the mystery of his life why he purified

13:28.020 --> 13:35.490
himself why he accepted that life and

13:32.570 --> 13:37.170
why with all his powers that he is going

13:35.490 --> 13:39.870
to come to destroy the whole world now

13:37.170 --> 13:46.170
why did he not destroy these people who

13:39.870 --> 13:50.550
were trying to purify what was the road

13:46.170 --> 13:53.850
he had to play in his lifetime he cannot

13:50.550 --> 13:56.430
understand with this human awareness you

13:53.850 --> 13:59.100
have to become something more and that's

13:56.430 --> 14:04.020
why he again and again said you are to

13:59.100 --> 14:05.700
be born again how many of us think that

14:04.020 --> 14:08.070
we are to be born again are we born

14:05.700 --> 14:11.070
again we certify many people said if I

14:08.070 --> 14:15.000
am Barney I am a Christian meaning born

14:11.070 --> 14:16.460
again Musel mom is missing and brahman

14:15.000 --> 14:21.420
means the same those who are born again

14:16.460 --> 14:23.210
now how are you born again he is again I

14:21.420 --> 14:26.360
make belief that I'm born again

14:23.210 --> 14:29.340
self-certification walking around with a

14:26.360 --> 14:34.380
certificated human-beings giving the

14:29.340 --> 14:42.810
certificate to human beings so what is

14:34.380 --> 14:47.550
the truth but if you are ardently

14:42.810 --> 14:53.060
seeking the truth then the mysteries can

14:47.550 --> 14:56.180
be open to you but you have to seek the

14:53.060 --> 15:00.250
truth an truth alone

14:56.180 --> 15:02.830
nothing else if you want to live with

15:00.250 --> 15:11.390
your ego go ahead

15:02.830 --> 15:14.060
nobody can gee when you start seeing

15:11.390 --> 15:18.620
your evil you have to know that this is

15:14.060 --> 15:21.649
not yourself something beyond because

15:18.620 --> 15:24.890
true ego whatever you have known is all

15:21.649 --> 15:27.680
a chaos all that knowledge that you got

15:24.890 --> 15:32.570
to go is creating all the problems of

15:27.680 --> 15:35.290
the world all the fears you have

15:32.570 --> 15:42.860
gathered through your super-ego is

15:35.290 --> 15:47.750
another disaster for human beings there

15:42.860 --> 15:53.660
must be something that God must have put

15:47.750 --> 15:57.820
within us some light by which we can see

15:53.660 --> 16:02.470
something beyond our ego and super

15:57.820 --> 16:02.470
enlightened until that happens to you

16:04.600 --> 16:13.040
you cannot understand the mystery of God

16:08.470 --> 16:16.700
and His love you cannot understand human

16:13.040 --> 16:21.820
love has no depth to feel the depth of

16:16.700 --> 16:24.400
God's love and his heart he saw servant

16:21.820 --> 16:33.740
he so ego-oriented

16:24.400 --> 16:43.250
his heart has could melt open it has to

16:33.740 --> 16:49.310
melt completely and flow this frozen

16:43.250 --> 16:53.140
heart is like an iceberg has to be

16:49.310 --> 16:53.140
dissolved in the ocean of his life

16:53.290 --> 17:00.200
otherwise you can never get to the

16:56.000 --> 17:04.370
depths of the people write to me mother

17:00.200 --> 17:06.679
I am not in love with Samantha so how

17:04.370 --> 17:08.650
can I be happy with that person that

17:06.679 --> 17:13.600
person will be miserable now

17:08.650 --> 17:15.309
living with that person for years you

17:13.600 --> 17:17.170
are having children from that person you

17:15.309 --> 17:18.730
don't love you don't love anyone you

17:17.170 --> 17:27.880
cannot love you don't know what love is

17:18.730 --> 17:29.710
they fall into love's pollen and some

17:27.880 --> 17:31.540
sort of a thing for them is now I don't

17:29.710 --> 17:33.330
know what is love for human beings to be

17:31.540 --> 17:36.130
very frank I don't understand

17:33.330 --> 17:43.000
here they are fall in love and next day

17:36.130 --> 17:46.660
they are out to the courts and according

17:43.000 --> 17:48.610
to the falling in love is something you

17:46.660 --> 17:55.210
see out of the blue oh I have fallen in

17:48.610 --> 17:59.100
love yeah I have yet to come across a

17:55.210 --> 17:59.100
person who has really fallen in love

17:59.580 --> 18:08.290
because as soon as something comes up

18:02.110 --> 18:15.610
that companionship and that love that

18:08.290 --> 18:21.910
enjoyment of oneness vanish heart has to

18:15.610 --> 18:25.690
melt hearts must meet where they have no

18:21.910 --> 18:26.500
stones in between otherwise these Tony

18:25.690 --> 18:31.000
hardsuits

18:26.500 --> 18:34.270
attract each other even I think two

18:31.000 --> 18:36.160
stones try to meet each other loving

18:34.270 --> 18:40.059
each other and how can they love I can't

18:36.160 --> 18:41.760
understand it's a big mystery that human

18:40.059 --> 18:46.780
beings know how to live with

18:41.760 --> 18:51.730
artificiality and it falls believes they

18:46.780 --> 18:57.780
compromise but spirit does not

18:51.730 --> 19:01.540
compromise them it does it forgives

18:57.780 --> 19:06.990
because it does it just forgives goes on

19:01.540 --> 19:10.980
forgiving forgiving because it loves and

19:06.990 --> 19:15.570
then it punishes also because it was a

19:10.980 --> 19:15.570
nice tries also because

19:17.390 --> 19:24.810
that's the spirit has to shine through

19:22.230 --> 19:26.730
yourself realization talking being about

19:24.810 --> 19:28.590
self-realization and pay hundred rupees

19:26.730 --> 19:31.880
get your sunglasses on all these

19:28.590 --> 19:37.320
nonsense is at such a low event such a

19:31.880 --> 19:42.090
quality that the beauty of his mystery

19:37.320 --> 19:51.630
is just after me you are in the chamber

19:42.090 --> 19:56.330
of asset and believing here in the

19:51.630 --> 19:56.330
kingdom of God there is forgiveness

19:57.020 --> 20:09.950
there is love there is compassion there

20:02.400 --> 20:13.770
is understanding there is complete

20:09.950 --> 20:20.870
all-pervading assurance and the support

20:13.770 --> 20:33.150
and the hand that wants to raise an

20:20.870 --> 20:40.020
anxious father who wants to soothe to

20:33.150 --> 20:47.820
give you joy to give you eternal joy can

20:40.020 --> 20:54.800
you think of someone like that he has

20:47.820 --> 20:54.800
problems many problems he has problems

20:55.460 --> 21:01.890
but the greatest problem is that he

20:59.910 --> 21:06.630
cannot have a rapport with his own

21:01.890 --> 21:09.060
children that he cannot give what he

21:06.630 --> 21:16.050
wants to give to his children who have a

21:09.060 --> 21:20.390
heart which has no emptiness which

21:16.050 --> 21:20.390
cannot be filled like a cup with Islam

21:20.990 --> 21:25.850
Kundalini does that suction in our heart

21:26.240 --> 21:37.279
but first she enters

21:29.549 --> 21:42.450
into the brain into the limbic area and

21:37.279 --> 21:45.840
then it proceeds stores heart so this

21:42.450 --> 21:49.559
mystery is solved once we start

21:45.840 --> 21:55.139
engulfing our brain our carts our

21:49.559 --> 22:01.230
thinking completely drenched in the

21:55.139 --> 22:06.269
showers of His grace otherwise is

22:01.230 --> 22:09.899
pipeline mind can never receive those

22:06.269 --> 22:14.279
beautiful views of love which form these

22:09.899 --> 22:19.019
two drops you have to be a flower to

22:14.279 --> 22:26.869
receive many soft tender receptive

22:19.019 --> 22:35.659
person and then only the fruit appears

22:26.869 --> 22:35.659
when you mature a heart heart of a saint

22:35.929 --> 22:46.320
which is larger than all the oceans of

22:38.970 --> 22:55.859
the world such wisdom of enjoying one's

22:46.320 --> 23:00.169
own love just that love that flows this

22:55.859 --> 23:04.859
mystery I wish all of you could

23:00.169 --> 23:09.570
achieving is like give up your ideas of

23:04.859 --> 23:16.049
judging something on close levels you

23:09.570 --> 23:21.900
have to become subtler try to enjoy

23:16.049 --> 23:34.270
things do not be joyous

23:21.900 --> 23:44.130
and you will get the benefit of this in

23:34.270 --> 23:44.130
such in measurable quantities try to see

23:44.220 --> 23:49.720
receive more of the grease drenched

23:48.850 --> 23:55.480
yourself

23:49.720 --> 24:01.600
it's so soothing it is the energy that

23:55.480 --> 24:06.280
suit can you think of inner energy that

24:01.600 --> 24:09.940
suits your mind completely that gives

24:06.280 --> 24:16.270
you wisdom that coordinates the whole

24:09.940 --> 24:19.630
atmosphere to make you happy this divine

24:16.270 --> 24:21.420
energy is all pervading and to

24:19.630 --> 24:24.700
understand the mystery of that

24:21.420 --> 24:27.150
all-pervading power you have to become

24:24.700 --> 24:32.670
self-realized you have to be born again

24:27.150 --> 24:35.590
this is not the way out and to mature

24:32.670 --> 24:39.390
after this rebirth if you need to make

24:35.590 --> 24:46.030
fun of someone very but what did you get

24:39.390 --> 24:48.460
