00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:24.789
Then last night I talked to you about ego.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.264
That how ego manifests itself and how it is difficult to get out of the ego.

00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:40.781
It's easy to get out of the conditionings super egos, but very difficult to get out of ego

00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:44.682
because ego aggresses others, doesn't trouble you at all.

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:46.796
And you enjoy that aggression,

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:49.754
See now.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:53.909
Today I want to tell you about how ego has been

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.088
historically, traditionally torturing people around.

00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:03.442
So you'll see the manifestation of this ego, and then you will know that

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:07.790
if you are playing anything any role with your ego,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.134
you could be part and parcel of that destructive force.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.730
So to begin with we'll see now, when this ego started growing in man.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.478
First of all see, it started growing with the protection,

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:37.483
so

00:01:44.378 --> 00:01:55.062
the pituitary, which is within us, started growing when we raised our head, like this.

00:01:55.142 --> 00:01:57.697
When we were animals, our head were like this,

00:01:57.777 --> 00:02:03.946
at that time the pineal body as it is called, was very powerful.

00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:08.670
They say in human beings the pineal doesn’t work out, it is not true, it does.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.496
But they don't know how it works.

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:23.329
So this pineal body within us, was very active when we were animal state.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:28.582
But when we raised our head, you see a chemical change took place within ourselves

00:02:28.662 --> 00:02:32.817
in the sense that our brain started growing in a pyramid,

00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:37.590
which I've told you how with the parallelogram of forces and all that it has started growing

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.996
into a pyramid, and when it became like that, you see

00:02:43.076 --> 00:02:49.365
because first it was only the pineal body looking after the super ego,

00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:52.345
up to the animal kingdom, up to the kingdom where

00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:55.552
the animals sort of became more sort of humanized,

00:02:55.632 --> 00:02:58.746
then the ego started growing.

00:02:58.826 --> 00:03:01.543
It's the only animals who can use the matter.

00:03:01.623 --> 00:03:04.081
Human beings can use the matter, not the animals.

00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:06.969
Animals cannot use the matter for their own purpose.

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.084
When they started aggressing the matter, the ego started developing,

00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:15.997
and we developed this what you call “the pyramid of our brain”,

00:03:16.077 --> 00:03:20.828
we starting growing, more and more and more and more like this.

00:03:20.908 --> 00:03:28.291
But when it reached it's height, then we started using our ego more we didn't stop at that point.

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:30.911
We started moving on the other side

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:35.985
so this went down and covered it covered it, completely like that.

00:03:36.065 --> 00:03:39.339
That's why we say the pineal body in the human beings doesn't work,

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.437
it functions, no doubt, it functions.

00:03:41.517 --> 00:03:48.300
As a result of that, you see when we saw this ego was growing,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.215
as a result of that people felt extremely over-confident.

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:54.427
What's wrong?

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:58.226
business started long time back, since the time of Columbus, as I've said

00:03:58.306 --> 00:04:01.248
if Columbus had come to India, he would not have seen Me here,

00:04:01.328 --> 00:04:03.322
he would have finished all the Indians there.

00:04:03.402 --> 00:04:07.287
Not him, he was a very nice man, but those who followed him.

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:10.263
In the same way, this ego started destroying people,

00:04:10.343 --> 00:04:13.820
and they had an idea of a triumph, and killing people,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.466
occupying lands, occupying territories, accumulating wealth.

00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:22.001
Went on, and on, and on, and on, on this level.

00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:24.301
Then from there they started.

00:04:24.381 --> 00:04:27.325
When the marriage system started in a proper way,

00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:29.923
again the aggression started on the women

00:04:30.003 --> 00:04:34.678
and now the women are aggressing men, like that, it's all became so aggressive.

00:04:34.758 --> 00:04:37.801
But when you are aggress you don't see that you are aggressing,

00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:40.441
this is the problem of the egoistical person.

00:04:40.521 --> 00:04:46.362
Though he may be a seeker, though he may be a very genuine seeker, but

00:04:46.442 --> 00:04:51.807
if he is in the area of ego, he never feels his own catches,

00:04:51.887 --> 00:04:55.014
because the ego is in between, the reality means that.

00:04:55.094 --> 00:05:00.118
So he cannot see his own catches, he cannot see how he is aggressing others,

00:05:00.198 --> 00:05:05.583
and he doesn't see how he's hurting others, troubling others, torturing others,

00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:16.875
and such a person can be extremely arrogant, extremely what you call the “strangulating”.

00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:20.936
This is what happens when you get cancer also.

00:05:21.016 --> 00:05:24.942
When you get the cancer, what happens, it starts with the left side no doubt.

00:05:25.022 --> 00:05:31.438
But when it comes into the person, then he becomes

00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:45.387
a person who is vulnerable to a disease or a disease where the person is aggressive.

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:51.545
The cells of the body first develop the aggression; we call it “malignant”.

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:58.151
When this cell comes in contact with others that also becomes malignant.

00:05:58.231 --> 00:06:03.357
So that's how the malignancy spreads, and when it spreads what happens?

00:06:03.437 --> 00:06:07.438
That supposing in the nose there are some cells which become malignant.

00:06:07.518 --> 00:06:14.207
So they start obstructing other organs to grow, the only nose will grow like that.

00:06:14.287 --> 00:06:17.565
Not outside but inside.

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:22.429
So they aggress, you see, the aggression starts and

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:24.708
they lose complete control with the whole,

00:06:24.788 --> 00:06:28.170
because there is no co-ordination with the whole, they don't see that

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.359
the whole has to grow together, and not only the nose, and not only the eyes, isn't it?

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:38.627
and this breaking from the collectivity is the first sign

00:06:38.707 --> 00:06:43.017
when you find a Sahaja yogi behaves in a funny way,

00:06:43.097 --> 00:06:45.854
that if he is breaking from the collectivity,

00:06:45.934 --> 00:06:53.809
then he is nothing but a egoist, no doubt about it; by any argument, by anything.

00:06:53.889 --> 00:07:00.204
But a person who is a super ego fellow will stick onto the collectivity;

00:07:00.284 --> 00:07:05.114
will try to be very close to the ashram, he'll be very much close to us very much here,

00:07:05.194 --> 00:07:09.981
around it, even if we say “we don't want to”, it will be there, why?

00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:22.958
Because it realizes that it is aggressed and also it realizes that it can be sly.

00:07:23.038 --> 00:07:26.919
So when a left-sided person enters into an ashram,

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:32.679
that person will be very nice, quiet, sweet, everything.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:40.642
But the entities, the bhoots in him, will aggress the people slyly, they'll torture

00:07:43.388 --> 00:07:45.715
but those people can be cured very easily,

00:07:45.795 --> 00:07:48.507
because they are troubled and tortured themselves.

00:07:48.587 --> 00:07:54.196
But those who are egotistical will be very difficult for them to get out it.

00:07:54.276 --> 00:07:57.402
That's why I've been talking about ego yesterday and today.

00:07:57.482 --> 00:08:02.467
They can see all aggression, they manifest, what's wrong?

00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:05.576
Say now, I was talking about the chemicals.

00:08:05.656 --> 00:08:09.409
Now, how did you discover these chemicals?

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:13.651
It is through your ego, through your science.

00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:18.161
Now, if the science is not related to God or to the whole, then you go like that,

00:08:18.241 --> 00:08:22.346
and then you can produce hydrogen bombs, you can produce these horrible chemicals,

00:08:22.426 --> 00:08:26.603
like it's what you call “the fool-hardiness”. You enter into every area,

00:08:26.683 --> 00:08:33.576
every place and achieve the power over that,

00:08:33.656 --> 00:08:36.867
I think you don't know what that is capable of.

00:08:36.947 --> 00:08:40.827
Supposing now you make computers, supposing,

00:08:40.907 --> 00:08:45.087
tomorrow these computers will eat you off.

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:49.087
I must tell you now there's a new disease I have discovered in people

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:52.774
that their conscious mind overpowers them.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:59.243
There was a fellow who was like this, very egoistical, he didn't believe in God also.

00:08:59.323 --> 00:09:01.704
He's an Indian and he met with an accident.

00:09:01.784 --> 00:09:05.507
His wife is a doctor, she's a friend of Mine, she brought him to Me.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:09.511
In My presence, he got up and walked off nicely, everything.

00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:14.117
But on his own, whenever he wanted consciously to do it, he couldn’t even raise his leg.

00:09:14.197 --> 00:09:15.365
Can you imagine?

00:09:15.445 --> 00:09:19.980
So with these egoistical people now a new disease is coming

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.685
that consciously they cannot do anything.

00:09:25.127 --> 00:09:32.208
They cannot do anything, in this will come, I'm promising you now, or I'm warning you now.

00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:37.429
As I warned the people who were going left-sided that you will have a horrible disease

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:40.078
and this is the new disease for all the egoists

00:09:40.158 --> 00:09:43.314
that consciously they won't be able to move, they'll be mute,

00:09:43.394 --> 00:09:48.306
sitting there only, their ego will take over.

00:09:48.832 --> 00:09:53.893
It's a very dangerous era when you are born, you must know.

00:09:53.973 --> 00:09:56.389
This is the time we are precariously placed:

00:09:56.469 --> 00:10:01.107
either you get to God or you go to Hell, there is nothing is between.

00:10:01.187 --> 00:10:06.084
So a new disease will come very soon, there is no insanity in it,

00:10:06.164 --> 00:10:09.966
nothing, you will be quite alert, but you can't move your hands,

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:14.358
your whole nervous system refuses to work.

00:10:16.013 --> 00:10:21.236
That's going to come, very soon it will manifest.

00:10:21.966 --> 00:10:25.447
You have seen that egotistical people

00:10:25.527 --> 00:10:29.984
have been going on like Hitler and all that, and they have destroyed the world

00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:32.810
and they have done so much harm to our value system.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.803
In subtle way we say that all this manifestation of 25 years

00:10:37.883 --> 00:10:43.050
of all this horrible hell they have created for us is because of the wars,

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.507
because of the wars.

00:10:44.587 --> 00:10:53.367
But these wars and things even if you avoid by some chance you avoid it,

00:10:53.447 --> 00:10:58.437
still if ego is there it will manifest itself.

00:10:58.517 --> 00:11:04.783
If you avoid it outside it will manifest inside and then you will find that you can't just move.

00:11:04.863 --> 00:11:08.188
You can't blink, you can't sleep,

00:11:08.268 --> 00:11:14.737
you can't move your hands, even now people can't sleep, many.

00:11:14.817 --> 00:11:20.064
And I don't want Sahaja yogis to suffer from that horrible disease,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:27.487
and Western people are more liable to that kind of a thing.

00:11:27.567 --> 00:11:30.847
The Sahaja yogis who are trying to get out of the collectivity,

00:11:30.927 --> 00:11:34.686
who are asserting their ego under the name of bhoots or whatever it is,

00:11:34.766 --> 00:11:42.367
should understand that it is 99% it is ego within us.

00:11:44.607 --> 00:11:47.999
And that ego has to be faced.

00:11:48.079 --> 00:11:50.459
“Oh, I have a ego, I feel guilty”,

00:11:50.539 --> 00:11:56.279
then alright you put it back here, [unclear: on your ear], that's not the way.

00:11:58.127 --> 00:12:00.081
That's not the way you'll do it.

00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:03.140
Today you are very active, working very hard, doing this,

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.133
tomorrow fine you'll be just immobilized.

00:12:07.213 --> 00:12:12.163
You can't move and persons don't care in this country

00:12:12.243 --> 00:12:16.717
as it is even for people who are alright,

00:12:16.797 --> 00:12:20.008
but you'll become like old people who cannot move.

00:12:20.088 --> 00:12:26.327
Who see everything, know everything, who are conscious, at a very young age this will happen,

00:12:26.407 --> 00:12:31.263
the slightest accident, the slightest disturbance, will just trigger off to that area

00:12:31.343 --> 00:12:34.657
where you will be absolutely like a mute person sitting.

00:12:34.737 --> 00:12:38.767
You can't move your finger, you can't hold anything.

00:12:38.847 --> 00:12:40.857
You will not be in a coma.

00:12:40.937 --> 00:12:44.488
Coma happens to people who take pills and things to go to the left,

00:12:44.568 --> 00:12:47.227
like drugs and things which take you to the left.

00:12:47.307 --> 00:12:52.732
But those who are right-sided you will not be in coma, that’s one thing, is a curse.

00:12:52.812 --> 00:13:01.358
You’ll see everything, you'll be alert you know everything but can't even turn your head.

00:13:01.438 --> 00:13:04.126
Take it from Me.

00:13:04.206 --> 00:13:07.326
That's coming, very soon.

00:13:08.364 --> 00:13:10.717
You may be talking, you may not be talking,

00:13:10.797 --> 00:13:17.955
it can go to that level, slowly, slowly, you'll find your body will be immobilized.

00:13:18.035 --> 00:13:20.892
People don't understand what dangers ego can have.

00:13:20.972 --> 00:13:24.279
It is not now the aggression outside so much,

00:13:24.359 --> 00:13:37.277
because it goes into left Vishuddhi, and this left Vishuddhi will creates this horrible disease.

00:13:38.596 --> 00:13:42.662
Now, how do we control our ego is very important to understand.

00:13:42.742 --> 00:13:49.427
First of all you must write your names and beat yourselves with shoes for 108 times to begin with.

00:13:51.009 --> 00:13:56.057
Secondly discipline yourself, by disciplining, get up in the morning, do your meditation,

00:13:56.137 --> 00:13:59.750
with right hand towards the photograph, left hand this way.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.686
Not to use light at all, not to use sun don't go to the sun at all.

00:14:04.766 --> 00:14:07.673
Sun is to be avoided, keep to the moon,

00:14:07.753 --> 00:14:14.273
read the books which describes the Maha Kalis of the left-side Shaktis.

00:14:16.813 --> 00:14:18.987
Don't read the books like Avadhuta book.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:22.758
You should never read it because you think you are an Avadhuta, I see, he said

00:14:22.838 --> 00:14:26.723
“I'm omnipresent, I'm this thing”, the person start feeing “I am this”.

00:14:26.803 --> 00:14:29.825
I was reading the book of Avadhuta,

00:14:29.905 --> 00:14:36.456
I said this book, this show what's gone wrong with our incarnations.

00:14:36.536 --> 00:14:38.916
What's gone wrong with our incarnations is

00:14:38.996 --> 00:14:43.057
they never knew human beings at all, at what level they are.

00:14:43.137 --> 00:14:49.694
You come and tell them “I'm formless and form, I'm this and that”, so what?

00:14:53.456 --> 00:14:59.797
If you are that, alright, I'm Compassion, I'm Love, I'm Peace, I'm that ... so what?

00:14:59.877 --> 00:15:03.396
How do you fill-in these cups?

00:15:03.476 --> 00:15:07.788
You have to come down to a human level, that's what they did not try,

00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:10.877
and that's why it's all a waste, I think on the contrary

00:15:10.957 --> 00:15:18.233
everybody think I'm God, I'm Bramha, Shivo Ham. Finished!

00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:22.754
And then they quarrel among themselves.

00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:26.574
That growth, that maturity has not come.

00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:29.473
It is very shallow, the whole thing become very shallow,

00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:33.014
you become a shallow person, and you live with it.

00:15:33.094 --> 00:15:37.430
So the first thing practical thing I'm telling you: beat yourself with shoes

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.270
and “I'm NOT this”.

00:15:42.437 --> 00:15:45.657
Like that you have to start first of all, telling yourself,

00:15:45.737 --> 00:15:50.698
if you are a seeker, a truthful seeker, an honest seeker, then I advise you this way,

00:15:50.778 --> 00:15:54.514
that you watch yourself in the mirror, and tell yourself:

00:15:54.594 --> 00:16:03.043
“Now you Mr Ego XYZ, will you get out from here, I know what I am, you get out”.

00:16:04.936 --> 00:16:07.296
You have to get after all this I mean.

00:16:07.376 --> 00:16:11.968
Laugh at yourselves, smile at yourself, make fun of yourself.

00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:15.676
That's the best, and never feel hurt.

00:16:15.756 --> 00:16:22.510
If anybody says “you are egoistical”, and then you'll say “I know"

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:28.615
'I know”: if you know you are egotistical, then how do you go further?

00:16:31.213 --> 00:16:34.819
Now ego manifest in so many ways.

00:16:34.899 --> 00:16:40.160
Through your eyes, through your ears, through your mouth, through your nose.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:44.274
Everyway, because you go against God, that is you go against collectivity,

00:16:44.354 --> 00:16:48.988
because you go against Shri Krishna, against your Vishuddhi chakra.

00:16:49.068 --> 00:16:50.863
That's first thing it manifest.

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:54.327
Nowadays nobody beats people like this, you see, we have become

00:16:54.407 --> 00:17:00.197
subtler in our ego manifestation; we use this part, not hands.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:06.209
It can be that you show temper through your eyes or it can be you flirt with your eyes.

00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:10.208
You become adulterous. That is why Christ has said “don't become adulterous”.

00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:13.798
So now it is nice that the AIDS can work out through the tears.

00:17:13.878 --> 00:17:14.997
It's good.

00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:17.612
Used to kiss people, alright, now kiss.

00:17:17.692 --> 00:17:20.453
Nobody will kiss now.

00:17:20.533 --> 00:17:26.906
You used all your Vishuddhi chakra so far to express all filth.

00:17:26.986 --> 00:17:30.068
Now the filth is pouring out.

00:17:30.977 --> 00:17:35.519
So, in the second stage when we understand that it is through the Vishuddhi

00:17:35.599 --> 00:17:42.199
that is this America we express ourselves, our ego, so what should we do?

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:45.956
First of all, stop talking.

00:17:46.036 --> 00:17:49.506
Here the way the people talk, I mean you see, you have just

00:17:49.586 --> 00:17:54.679
start opening your mouth like this and like that, you go on and the other is talking,

00:17:54.759 --> 00:17:58.325
just you tell them something, they just come on with all the knowledge

00:17:58.405 --> 00:18:03.779
they have known everything, A to Z, and you don't know where you are.

00:18:03.859 --> 00:18:09.478
How do you stop talking?, I've told you a practical thing, I'll get you betel nuts,

00:18:09.558 --> 00:18:15.432
which I'll vibrate, put it in mouth, and you take it out when you have to talk.

00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:21.909
Otherwise keep it there, that's Shri Ganesha, don't take it out.

00:18:21.989 --> 00:18:24.549
Stop talking.

00:18:24.629 --> 00:18:28.775
If you stop talking, your hypocrisy will go away.

00:18:28.855 --> 00:18:35.082
It's through our face we are hypocritical, everything works out through Vishuddhi.

00:18:35.162 --> 00:18:41.760
Now see, a person who is extremely aggressive you see can also act to be very, very sweet

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.394
you see, if they have to exploit you or make money out of you.

00:18:46.474 --> 00:18:51.848
They can act, acting; the whole acting comes through this Vishuddhi.

00:18:51.928 --> 00:18:57.949
Then you act, “You are a very gentle person, you are very good”.

00:18:58.029 --> 00:19:01.839
But you are not, you are aggressive.

00:19:01.919 --> 00:19:09.237
So for that you have to know that talking less

00:19:09.317 --> 00:19:15.282
will reduce 50% of your hypocrisy and acting, 50%.
