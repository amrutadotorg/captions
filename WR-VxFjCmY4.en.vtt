00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:34.625
Please, be seated

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:53.580
[Hindi]...

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.060
Don't cross the limits of Shri Mataji's chair. You, there. All right.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.680
So with Shri Mataji's blessings, and thanks to the teaching of "Maushi" [aunt in Marathi],

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.220
we would like to present you with a "Bharood" [Marathi religious song] by Sant Eknath.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.640
It's a song that, in a style that

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.560
is designed to teach people

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.480
what will happen to them if they don't behave in a, in the correct way.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.660
In this particular song, Sant Eknath is talking about what happens to people

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.100
if they're not if they trick people badly.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.060
If they are, if they are rude to them if they cheat them.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.040
Sant Eknath gives example in particular

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200
of Duryodhana

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.980
who took Draupadi and humiliated her in his court

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.040
and it was eventually his brother,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.720
the brother of Duryodhana drag Draupadi into the cour to be humiliated.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.440
And was eventually punished by Bhishma,

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.100
Bhishma, Bhishma [Bema]

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.180
[Bema]

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.940
who was punished by Bhishma in a dual.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.080
In the same way, Ravana who kidnapped Shri Sita was duly punished by Shri Rama.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.560
And so on in many cases.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.240
In reality, there are only four people that Sant Eknath mentions

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.700
who are free from any kind of problem in his regard.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.960
For example, Bhishma and Hanumana,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.960
those two are examples.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.280
Sant Eknath concludes the song

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.800
inviting us to be

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.620
to be sweet with each other and not to abuse each other.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.420
Otherwise- cause if we do, then our fate is a very ugly one.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.700
Give me a microphone for tablas.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.580
Wonderful!

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.560
May God bless you

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.300
...For their very kind and very appreciate for their treatment

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.820
and everything that they did for me and my daughter

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.420
I have no words to give them my gratitude.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.020
And then I need not add

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.400
that my greatest thanks are to Shri Mataji

01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:12.160
Shri Mataji has suggested a new name for this raga

01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:17.540
Since this is a gift from the disciple to the guru

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.400
and guru is synonymous of "Purnima" that is the full Moon,

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:28.980
Shri Mataji says that this raga should be called "Chaitanya Purnima".

01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.980
That means-

01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.860
I think this is the biggest award a disciple can expect from a guru,

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:00.060
that She has blessed this raga with a very wonderful name.

01:17:00.060 --> 01:17:02.060
Jai Shri Mataji
