00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.667
And this is how the things go on accumulating

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.941
which has no value aesthetically or in any way.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.669
Actually you should buy something 
only to give it to someone.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.875
That's the best way of enjoying it 
to the maximum, you see.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:23.956
And anybody likes it - have it.

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.862
You see, that's the best way.
It's a great thing,

00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:30.752
I mean I tell you it's rather difficult 
for you people to understand,

00:00:30.832 --> 00:00:33.686
but I am one of them who does that very often,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:37.291
and my children and my husband 
are rather worried you know,

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.961
"God knows next time what She'll give away."

00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:43.042
But you'll be amazed I've so many things,

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:45.003
so many things, despite all this,

00:00:45.084 --> 00:00:47.917
I mean the whole time thinking 
what to give to whom,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.086
still it's so many things in the house, now 
that we have to take a bigger house.

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:54.753
I don't know what to do with so many things

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:58.917
and I try to thrust things on the people, 
"Baba you take this you have liked it."

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.044
But they say: "No no no how can you give me."

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:04.336
But really that gives me such a pleasure,

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:06.836
and one must learn how to do.

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:10.667
But I've have seen human beings are different.
For themselves they'll buy diamonds,

00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:14.126
and for others they'll buy artificial things.

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:16.000
It's very common you know.

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:18.048
They will buy for, they are wearing diamonds

00:01:18.129 --> 00:01:21.133
and when it is coming to giving to others 
they'll give artificial.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:23.546
At least don't wear at that time the diamond.

00:01:23.627 --> 00:01:25.627
At least that much decency should be there.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:29.878
So you see when it comes to giving, 
give it with your full heart.

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.166
You just feel that love of giving

00:01:32.247 --> 00:01:36.852
and you feel so happy, because 
you feel so big about yourself,

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.333
like an ocean that's giving so much of clouds

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:44.461
and again it is receiving these rivers into it, 
and again making it into clouds,

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:49.417
a sort of a circle of beautiful 
conversion into beauty

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:51.875
after beauty starts, it's so beautiful.

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:55.333
And that's what we should try to become,

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:58.792
a part of that circle, which is so beautiful

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:02.180
and which is so joy giving, to yourself also.

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:07.667
And this is what it is, and this hand is 
for ashraya, means for the protection.

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:13.167
You must protect the people 
who are your subordinates,

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.042
who are dependent on you, your children.

00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:20.643
Like, it's a very common thing to insult 
your children from their childhood.

00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:23.078
Why did you spoil that carpet?

00:02:23.332 --> 00:02:27.131
Why did you do that? You should not have
said this, why did you?

00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:29.583
This is a very wrong thing of discipline.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.687
Best discipline is to put dignity into children.

00:02:34.084 --> 00:02:37.836
You see, a good home in India we'll say,

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:41.627
is known by the way children 
are addressed in the family.

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:47.458
Like, in a good family we address the children like "Sa".

00:02:47.628 --> 00:02:50.424
Little bit like that, ap, means 'Sir'.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:53.753
We never address the children with indignity,

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:56.854
and we put them on a dignified level.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:00.195
And it's a very nice thing.

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:02.711
I'll tell you about my own granddaughter,

00:03:02.792 --> 00:03:09.834
that, somebody was telling her one day that, 
there's a very, this boy

00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:11.537
and why don't you marry him.

00:03:11.618 --> 00:03:13.896
She said: 'Why do you want 
to talk about marriage?

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:17.208
I'm not yet grown at all 
to think about marriage,

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.084
and we have to be dignified about things,

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:23.419
how can we think of marriage 
when we are not to think,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.084
and my grandmother will marry me 
and I want to live, a dignified person.'

00:03:28.084 --> 00:03:32.250
A little girl of seven years said this 
to this woman who was very,

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:35.417
sort of pseudo-intellectual type and she tried

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.291
to tease my granddaughter. 
She said: 'It's not dignified'.

00:03:39.792 --> 00:03:43.917
Just think of that. At the age of seven years 
they have their sense of dignity.

00:03:43.998 --> 00:03:48.009
If you tell them, you see they, you need 
not tell them don't spoil the carpet,

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.458
but give them dignity they will never spoil it.
