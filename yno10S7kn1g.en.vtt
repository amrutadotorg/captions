WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
i think your patiently waiting to meet mother

00:03.960 --> 00:08.960
I'd like, to say one very simple thing and that is to to reiterate what

00:11.560 --> 00:14.200
william da blow has just said that

00:14.920 --> 00:21.760
although sahaja yoga heals and it heals very very effectively because i've seen clinical cases where

00:22.000 --> 00:24.920
many many fantastic cures have been affected

00:25.560 --> 00:33.400
basically self-realization gives you your spiritual ascent and as a by-product as a by-product you get better

00:35.400 --> 00:38.880
sometimes it's instant cure sometimes it takes several weeks

00:39.680 --> 00:43.720
Depending upon the nature of the problem but we have to see things a little bit in reverse

00:44.240 --> 00:50.200
To the traditional thought in medicine and that is that first we have to fix the subtle body and

00:50.960 --> 00:53.480
Then the gross problems be they mental

00:54.480 --> 00:56.840
emotional or physical will get better

00:57.920 --> 01:00.520
So first we have to fix the subtle

01:01.640 --> 01:05.280
mechanism within each one of us and then in turn

01:05.960 --> 01:10.000
the gross problem which we call disease will get better

01:10.640 --> 01:12.640
So we have to change our priorities

01:13.520 --> 01:16.200
We have to first get, to the subtle and

01:17.240 --> 01:18.320
then

01:18.520 --> 01:20.520
The more common

01:20.920 --> 01:24.680
ideas we have on healing are automatically

01:25.640 --> 01:31.000
Put in their right perspective the other thing i'd like, to say is that by way of introduction to mother is that

01:33.320 --> 01:35.320
if sahaja yoga is a very

01:36.280 --> 01:40.240
rapid happening if it's something which occurs often as

01:40.920 --> 01:46.480
has been said by the saints of india about her in the twinkling of an eye or

01:47.400 --> 01:50.240
by a mere glance or by her attention

01:51.680 --> 01:55.920
how the kundalini can rise shoot up through this subtle body and

01:57.960 --> 02:05.000
give you your yoga give you your union with god you quite rightly will ask how can it be

02:06.920 --> 02:10.240
more you will ask how can it be so simple

02:11.840 --> 02:13.040
how can it

02:13.240 --> 02:13.960
in fact

02:14.160 --> 02:15.600
be granted on

02:15.800 --> 02:22.960
how can it be granted on mass how can it be granted to as many as say two or three hundred people here or

02:23.360 --> 02:26.240
To six thousand which i have witnessed

02:27.080 --> 02:34.520
In india these are very real questions which i'm sure many of you have in your mind how can it be so simple

02:35.400 --> 02:38.560
Perhaps even the question is why mataji

02:39.440 --> 02:41.440
what about the other gurus

02:42.080 --> 02:45.040
what about faith healing what about what about what about

02:46.640 --> 02:48.640
You, see because it happens simply

02:49.800 --> 02:52.360
this makes the whole process all the more remarkable

02:55.280 --> 02:57.320
So mataji has to be somebody very special

02:59.160 --> 03:03.600
She has, to be somebody very special that on mass the kundalini will rise

03:04.240 --> 03:10.120
In fact the saint who came down from the himalayas to visit one of shri mataji's programs in india

03:10.880 --> 03:17.720
himself was absolutely amazed and prostrated himself at her feet when he saw from his celestial vision

03:18.400 --> 03:20.200
The mass

03:20.400 --> 03:22.040
rising of kundalini

03:22.240 --> 03:27.880
in an audience of some seven or eight hundred people this was a fantastic happening and

03:28.400 --> 03:31.720
it's just as fantastic in each one of us tonight

03:32.320 --> 03:34.320
it happens spontaneously

03:34.680 --> 03:36.680
it's a real happening and

03:36.960 --> 03:39.520
it happens in her presence

03:40.200 --> 03:45.880
But it happens also in the presence of a realized soul who has been granted

03:46.880 --> 03:50.920
self-realization by the mother by the incarnation that she is

03:51.600 --> 03:52.680
and

03:52.880 --> 03:58.840
So we have to humble ourself a little bit, we have to keep a little bit of a mystery in the back of our mind?

03:59.360 --> 04:01.360
as, to who she is

04:02.480 --> 04:09.520
if it can happen so simply it must be something rather remarkable and indeed she must be a rather remarkable person

04:10.960 --> 04:12.600
so

04:12.800 --> 04:13.960
with this

04:14.160 --> 04:16.160
thought in mind i

04:16.640 --> 04:19.480
urge each one of you just to very simply on

04:20.040 --> 04:24.160
The one hand be a scientist and keep an open mind on the other hand?

04:24.720 --> 04:32.320
humble yourself down to that point where you think if the blessings of god are such that at this time of difficulty and

04:32.560 --> 04:33.880
confusion

04:34.080 --> 04:37.600
At this time when there's so much sickness both mental and physical

04:38.640 --> 04:46.560
at this time when people are being possessed i heard bill speaking about possession by all sorts of entities which can cause

04:47.280 --> 04:50.960
anything from mental disease to serious physical problems

04:52.320 --> 04:57.560
where these things are raging around us with hospitals overflowing throughout the world

04:58.320 --> 05:01.120
with doctors unable to control the situation

05:02.640 --> 05:07.000
We should give some thought to the fact that maybe at this time

05:08.120 --> 05:09.600
almighty god

05:09.800 --> 05:12.400
in his compassion has sent a

05:12.960 --> 05:20.240
Great incarnation to do the job, to do the job to awaken that which is within you that makes you

05:20.840 --> 05:22.680
your own master

05:22.880 --> 05:26.040
that liberates you from all this confusion

05:27.320 --> 05:30.440
all this disease all this tension and

05:31.560 --> 05:33.280
gives you the ultimate

05:33.480 --> 05:35.480
it happened with shri krishna

05:35.800 --> 05:42.160
it happened with the lord jesus christ it happened with muhammad it happened with the buddha it happened with so many of the

05:42.440 --> 05:46.200
incarnations who came on this earth they came at a time when

05:46.640 --> 05:51.520
The civilization was out of balance people had moved either to the left or to the right

05:52.000 --> 05:54.960
away from that sense of righteousness and

05:55.520 --> 05:58.840
sustainance which is the essential religion within us

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
So perhaps at this time

06:02.320 --> 06:04.320
We have to recognize

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
perhaps at this time we have to

06:07.520 --> 06:11.080
Say, to almighty god if i am a seeker

06:12.040 --> 06:17.440
please give me the ultimate experience that i've been seeking for all my births and

06:18.328 --> 06:22.945
So ladies and gentlemen again it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you

06:23.145 --> 06:26.843
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

06:45.440 --> 06:49.960
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

06:52.440 --> 06:57.560
May God give you wisdom and understanding

06:57.960 --> 07:03.960
about the truth and about Himself.

07:06.800 --> 07:11.360
Doctor Warren just now brought out a point

07:11.680 --> 07:17.560
that if somebody is doing this work

07:18.160 --> 07:22.320
in a split of a second, even

07:22.560 --> 07:27.200
on the television when it was only one minute, if it works out,

07:27.560 --> 07:31.560
then there has to be somebody special.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.960
All this kind of talk

07:36.200 --> 07:39.040
is not necessary in India,

07:39.280 --> 07:43.320
because Indians are well educated in spiritual matters.

07:43.640 --> 07:48.320
They know what is the Shakti is, what is Kundalini is.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.240
They know the chakras.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.280
They are very well equipped.

07:52.600 --> 07:57.680
They have got the names of the Shakti in which it is said so.

07:57.960 --> 08:03.520
So to them it is not to be told and requested.

08:03.920 --> 08:07.480
But in the West, though such great saints have been born,

08:07.680 --> 08:09.360
such seekers are born,

08:09.560 --> 08:12.080
they have forgotten the knowledge that they had,

08:12.320 --> 08:17.280
perhaps, of the power of God.

08:17.480 --> 08:21.200
And that's why I find the sensitivity of people

08:21.520 --> 08:23.920
is not towards understanding the reality,

08:24.200 --> 08:27.440
but more they take to artificial things.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.680
Perhaps the more we are in contact with machine,

08:30.920 --> 08:38.600
we become more akin or close to machine.

08:38.880 --> 08:43.800
We try to understand everything in a machine-like manner,

08:44.120 --> 08:49.520
but not in that sensitive way, that people had once upon a time.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.160
Even at the time of Christ,

08:52.360 --> 08:57.080
except for few Jews who didn't like Him

08:57.480 --> 09:02.520
because they wanted to have their own money-making propositions,

09:02.840 --> 09:05.600
they crucified Him.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.440
Even the judge who judged Him,

09:08.720 --> 09:13.760
his wife could understand that He was a saint.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.000
And the people around Him,

09:17.320 --> 09:19.040
who were simple people,

09:19.320 --> 09:24.400
all of them knew that He was something saintly.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.400
Even at the time of Shri Krishna and Shri Rama, it has happened.

09:28.640 --> 09:34.080
I agree that many saints have been crucified, have been tortured,

09:34.560 --> 09:38.640
but not by the general public, by general people.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.600
It has been done by people who were in power,

09:41.920 --> 09:44.440
or who were prophesying some sort of a religion,

09:44.760 --> 09:46.960
who thought that their religion is in danger

09:47.200 --> 09:49.840
because they were making money out of that religion.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.240
These are the people who did all these atrocities

09:53.520 --> 09:57.520
and they brought forth this kind of calamity

09:57.720 --> 10:01.040
or this kind of torture to the great saints who lived.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.240
But today is just the other way round.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.280
The public is not sensitive enough.

10:06.480 --> 10:11.480
That's a very hard thing to feel that the public itself

10:11.800 --> 10:17.000
is not understanding what is the truth and how to come to the truth.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.160
Yesterday in short I told you,

10:20.400 --> 10:22.560
first of all we have to be honest people

10:22.760 --> 10:25.280
if you want to find the truth.

10:25.640 --> 10:29.240
Is a simple proposition that we have to be honest about it,

10:29.480 --> 10:32.920
that we should know that we cannot purchase the truth.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.200
Secondly, the truth is what it is.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.160
Whatever are your own conceptions about truth is not the truth.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.720
Is your own idea, your mental projection.

10:42.960 --> 10:47.360
Truth is what it is. It will be for ever and ever.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.960
And truth cannot compromise for you.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.200
You have to compromise for the truth.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.480
It is the other way round thing,

10:55.960 --> 10:58.360
that you have to compromise for the truth.

10:58.600 --> 11:02.800
You have to understand that so far those concepts you had,

11:03.040 --> 11:05.280
relatively if they are not near the truth,

11:05.480 --> 11:06.960
then you have to give them out.

11:07.240 --> 11:08.720
It's a very strange thing

11:08.920 --> 11:12.720
that you great people who are seekers,

11:12.920 --> 11:15.360
are born in various countries,

11:15.600 --> 11:17.680
in so many countries, I find.

11:17.960 --> 11:22.400
And then at this juncture,

11:22.720 --> 11:25.840
when it is not because there is so much sickness and all that.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.960
But is a special time also.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.080
Is a time of resurrection.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.800
Is the time of your last judgment.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.400
At this great times,

11:35.600 --> 11:41.240
that people should lose their sensitivity to reality.

11:41.640 --> 11:46.480
It is amazing how people take to artificial things.

11:46.680 --> 11:50.080
So many things people have done just because

11:50.320 --> 11:51.760
they could not see through.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.600
That's why I requested you yesterday,

11:53.800 --> 11:56.640
you must come to some logical conclusion.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.200
You must use your brains and understand

11:59.440 --> 12:01.440
that reality, if it lies within you

12:01.680 --> 12:06.880
and if it is a living process of your evolution,

12:07.080 --> 12:09.560
then it has to be done

12:09.800 --> 12:14.640
in a way that is not done by human beings,

12:15.040 --> 12:19.520
because no living work is done by human beings. It cannot be done.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.600
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit,

12:22.840 --> 12:27.000
leave alone a human being into a spirit.

12:27.240 --> 12:31.800
So, it has to be done by the same process

12:32.000 --> 12:34.080
which has made us human beings,

12:34.320 --> 12:39.720
and the same process that is living force of God's love,

12:39.960 --> 12:43.880
of living God's love, should do the job.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.640
So it has to be spontaneous.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.040
You cannot achieve it through your efforts.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.240
Actually, those who tell you like that,

12:52.440 --> 12:54.120
that "You have to achieve it through your efforts,"

12:54.320 --> 12:55.320
or, "You have got your karmas.

12:55.520 --> 12:56.840
You have got to suffer," and all that,

12:57.040 --> 12:58.760
are just giving excuses.

12:58.960 --> 13:02.040
They don't know how to achieve it. They are just giving excuses.

13:02.280 --> 13:06.040
You must understand that if you have got that power within you,

13:06.280 --> 13:08.600
it has to manifest spontaneously.

13:08.880 --> 13:13.960
For example, some people may not get realization.

13:14.360 --> 13:18.400
May be little bit, very little bit percentage, I hope,

13:18.640 --> 13:19.520
may not get it.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.600
But that is nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.560
There must be something wrong within you,

13:23.800 --> 13:26.440
physically, mentally, emotionally.

13:26.720 --> 13:29.760
There must be something wrong. So we have to correct it

13:30.000 --> 13:34.360
and we have to see that you get your realization

13:34.600 --> 13:39.600
in a proper way and that it is achieved

13:40.000 --> 13:44.720
through your own understanding, in your own glory.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.320
That you should know that you have got your realization.

13:48.560 --> 13:49.920
This is the only difference

13:50.160 --> 13:54.200
between the evolutionary process so far from animal to this stage,

13:54.440 --> 13:58.480
that human beings will be aware of their realization.

13:59.040 --> 14:04.400
They will know all about it because now they have become masters,

14:04.680 --> 14:07.520
that they are not doing things automatically.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.880
They will know that this power is flowing through them

14:11.160 --> 14:13.480
and they will also know how to handle it,

14:13.760 --> 14:16.000
which can be decode through Sahaja Yoga.

14:16.280 --> 14:21.560
And you have to learn the technique of operating God's laws,

14:21.800 --> 14:26.240
which are tremendous and wonderful.

14:26.560 --> 14:30.040
You believe it or not: God exists.

14:30.320 --> 14:33.960
His loving power is all-pervading.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.680
We have never felt it before.

14:35.880 --> 14:38.360
I agree there, you have never felt that

14:38.560 --> 14:40.960
His all-pervading power is everywhere.

14:41.240 --> 14:43.000
You have felt the ether,

14:43.240 --> 14:47.280
through which we receive the television and other communications,

14:47.560 --> 14:50.080
but you have not felt that subtle power,

14:50.320 --> 14:52.560
which is all-pervading, not only but that,

14:52.800 --> 14:56.480
but is the subtle of all these gross that you see.

14:56.880 --> 14:59.080
But the time has come,

14:59.360 --> 15:02.640
very precious time, that you have to get it.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.040
So all your other identifications,

15:05.280 --> 15:07.240
I am sorry, you have to drop them.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.840
You have to just become yourself.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.640
Whatever you have gathered in life time,

15:10.840 --> 15:15.240
all kinds of concepts, and precepts and all that, forget it.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.800
Just think that you are a human being

15:18.000 --> 15:19.760
and you have to get your realization.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.600
That's the most important thing.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.640
All the rest of things are of no use.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.520
So I would request you first of all,

15:27.760 --> 15:31.920
in all honesty, try to be the spirit.

15:32.160 --> 15:33.680
And if you become the spirit,

15:33.920 --> 15:39.760
try to understand the path of progress in your spiritual ascent.

15:40.480 --> 15:44.960
Now to come to the point of this

15:45.320 --> 15:49.400
subtle instrument already created within us,

15:49.680 --> 15:52.960
to come to this point we have to understand,

15:53.240 --> 15:58.000
as I told you yesterday that this is the knowledge of the roots.

15:58.280 --> 16:02.360
Whatever you have so far, is the knowledge of the tree.

16:02.720 --> 16:06.280
But you don't have any knowledge of the roots.

16:06.520 --> 16:10.080
Many people have told me, "Mother, what Christianity has failed.

16:10.320 --> 16:13.320
That religion has failed. This religion has failed.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.800
How can it be? If there is God, how can it be?"

16:16.040 --> 16:17.320
I mean, there are communists also in this world

16:17.520 --> 16:19.680
who deny God completely.

16:19.960 --> 16:24.360
But is not that the religions have failed;

16:24.600 --> 16:26.440
not the prophets have failed;

16:26.680 --> 16:28.360
not the incarnations have failed.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.360
It's the people who represented them,

16:30.600 --> 16:33.080
wanted to make something of their own,

16:33.280 --> 16:35.080
of their own concept, of their ideas,

16:35.320 --> 16:38.520
and the whole thing has become such a market place,

16:38.800 --> 16:41.200
that I just don't understand.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.880
How can you sell God? How can you sell His ideas?

16:45.080 --> 16:48.800
There is no business about God.

16:49.040 --> 16:53.800
Now this one is the great instrument that you have within yourself.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.200
Yesterday I told you that you need not accept Me

16:57.440 --> 17:02.320
as a sort of a conditioning on your mind.

17:02.640 --> 17:06.600
But as a scientist, keep an open mind.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.680
And this is the hypothesis I put before you,

17:09.920 --> 17:14.800
and when it works out, you have to see if it is all right or not.

17:15.040 --> 17:19.600
Now some of you who might be doubting about it,

17:19.800 --> 17:23.440
or thinking that, "Oh, it's all another story," or things like that.

17:23.680 --> 17:25.080
They can go ahead with it

17:25.360 --> 17:28.200
because Divine is not interested in such people.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.480
Divine is only interested in people

17:30.720 --> 17:34.200
who are honestly seeking the truth.

17:34.600 --> 17:38.560
So this center that you see the first of all,

17:38.760 --> 17:41.360
is a very important center.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.680
I don't know what he has told you about it,

17:43.960 --> 17:46.360
but is called as the Mooladhara.

17:46.560 --> 17:50.040
It's the center of Mooladhara,

17:50.280 --> 17:52.760
center of Mooladhara.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.560
Mooladhara itself is that triangular bone,

17:56.800 --> 18:00.160
which is a very small triangle. You cannot see it clearly.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.000
We should have expanded it to show you,

18:03.320 --> 18:06.600
which contains in itself

18:06.880 --> 18:10.080
the power of Kundalini.

18:10.360 --> 18:14.800
Is the power of that energy, which I told you yesterday,

18:15.000 --> 18:19.080
is the pure desire to become one with God.

18:19.400 --> 18:23.440
All other desires are not satiable.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.360
That's why this is the only desire that has to manifest.

18:27.560 --> 18:31.360
Otherwise, you are not going to be satisfied with your life.

18:31.600 --> 18:37.480
Now, this pure desire exists in that triangular bone,

18:38.080 --> 18:43.320
and you could see it also when you raise the Kundalini,

18:43.600 --> 18:46.880
is pulsating there just like a heart.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.920
But not on every person. Not on every seeker.

18:51.160 --> 18:55.080
Only those who have a problem with the other two centers,

18:55.360 --> 19:00.800
you can see with your naked eye, the pulsation of the Kundalini.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.080
When there is such a pulsation of the Kundalini,

19:04.320 --> 19:06.800
we have to know that these two centers

19:07.000 --> 19:09.720
are in problem in human beings.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.200
And these two centers are,

19:13.200 --> 19:16.920
the higher one is called as the Nabhi Chakra,

19:17.160 --> 19:21.040
which means the center, the subtler center of the navel.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.240
And this center manifests outside,

19:24.440 --> 19:29.200
what we call the solar plexus.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.080
In the medical terminology is called as solar plexus.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.880
But that's the gross thing.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.440
This is the subtle center

19:35.640 --> 19:38.920
which is in the medulla oblongata in the spinal cord.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.560
Now this is a very, very important center within us again,

19:42.760 --> 19:46.920
which was created since long, when we were seeking.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.000
First, as animals we were seeking food.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.600
Then also we were seeking our evolution.

19:52.840 --> 19:59.280
Because animals also sought their ascent

19:59.560 --> 20:04.680
from a one-unicellular animal to a multi-cellular animal,

20:04.920 --> 20:07.920
like all the quadrupeds are or the mammals are.

20:08.200 --> 20:12.560
How they arrived it, is no one can say.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.080
because the power that worked for it,

20:15.320 --> 20:19.440
lies in the central path of this central Nadi

20:19.640 --> 20:23.800
called as Sushumna Nadi.

20:25.320 --> 20:29.520
So first we were seeking the food.

20:29.840 --> 20:34.320
Then we were seeking the shelter, as you go by in the history.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.920
Then as we evolved more and more,

20:37.160 --> 20:42.360
we started seeking our joy in, say, economics,

20:42.560 --> 20:47.400
in possessions, then in politics, in power.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.960
Then we evolved much more

20:50.240 --> 20:52.440
and we thought there is no joy in all these things.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.720
We have had enough of it.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.800
Specially the affluence helped you a lot.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.760
Because affluent people get fed-up of materialism,

20:58.960 --> 21:01.280
and the plastic mountains that they have created.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.800
And they just want to have something simple in life.

21:05.160 --> 21:10.560
At this stage then they start thinking of their spirit.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.760
They think, "How is it that we are not yet satisfied?

21:14.000 --> 21:17.040
How is it we are so restless? What are we seeking?"

21:17.360 --> 21:19.400
Some of them know what they are seeking.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.760
Some of them don't know what they are seeking,

21:21.960 --> 21:23.760
but even if they know what they are seeking,

21:23.960 --> 21:27.720
they don't know how it will happen, and what should we expect.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.480
That's a very important thing

21:29.720 --> 21:33.400
where I find Indian people are better equipped.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.600
But you have another great equipment,

21:35.880 --> 21:39.360
that your desire to seek is very strong,

21:39.560 --> 21:43.640
is extremely strong, and you go like a bull at it.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.960
I have seen people who got realization,

21:47.240 --> 21:50.480
and they were running so fast towards it

21:50.680 --> 21:52.600
that even after getting realization

21:52.800 --> 21:54.960
they would not accept that they have sought it.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.680
They would not stop, you see. Like a bull is running very fast,

21:57.880 --> 22:00.080
you see, even if you offer him something to eat

22:00.320 --> 22:01.760
he won't be able to stop at that point.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.680
He goes little ahead then he looks back, "Yes, that's it."

22:04.920 --> 22:05.920
So he comes back.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.160
It has happened with so many people

22:08.360 --> 22:11.680
who have done a kind of a guru-shopping,

22:11.880 --> 22:14.680
I would call it, it's a habit.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.760
They take a bag in the hand with little money,

22:17.960 --> 22:20.360
go round in the shop, "Now which guru is available?"

22:20.560 --> 22:24.360
So they go to one guru, "All right, no good, hopeless."

22:24.560 --> 22:27.560
Then he goes to another guru, third one.

22:27.840 --> 22:33.360
And Sahaja Yoga is a temple somewhere away from that market.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.600
So that habit is also formed in human beings of seeking

22:37.800 --> 22:43.360
that even being introduced to Sahaja Yoga

22:43.560 --> 22:45.800
and even after becoming the spirit

22:46.040 --> 22:47.800
feeling the all-pervading power,

22:48.040 --> 22:52.280
still they don't want to stop, because the inertia is too much.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.400
And it's still they are going on.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.560
But after some time, they reverse back.

22:56.760 --> 23:00.200
I've seen many things like that happening in Sahaja Yoga

23:00.440 --> 23:02.040
in every place I went to.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.320
Specially in England is very common

23:04.520 --> 23:07.240
that in first shot they just can't believe it,

23:07.440 --> 23:08.920
"How can it be? It's not so simple."

23:09.160 --> 23:11.280
Because then their ego is finished.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.160
They have found it, "How can it be? We can't do it by ourselves."

23:14.360 --> 23:17.240
So they forget about Sahaja Yoga for a while.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.440
Then the Kundalini comes and tickles them all over.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.600
Again She comes and clears them all over.

23:22.800 --> 23:24.760
Then they start thinking, "What's happening to me?"

23:24.960 --> 23:28.760
And then they come back to Me and say,  "Mother,

23:28.960 --> 23:30.680
I must say there was something that had happened.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.480
But I, just I was too fast. I was too speedy

23:33.720 --> 23:35.600
and I just didn't get the glimpse of it."

23:35.840 --> 23:37.600
All right, settle down now.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.800
So that's one thing is always common and it's all right.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.280
It's excusable; this doesn't matter.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.520
You take your own time. I am not in a hurry.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.440
But Divine is. Divine is in a very great hurry,

23:48.680 --> 23:52.080
and the work has to be done in a very great speed now.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.360
It is very important that we have to move

23:54.600 --> 23:56.920
in a very tremendous speed.

23:57.360 --> 24:01.960
So this seeking within us

24:02.200 --> 24:08.000
is surrounded by this ocean of illusion, within ourselves.

24:08.440 --> 24:13.960
This ocean of illusion comes to us because of our ignorance.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.960
We see things which do not exist.

24:18.280 --> 24:21.760
For example, there is a gentleman who comes to us.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.000
He is very sweet to talk to.

24:24.400 --> 24:28.240
And after sometime we find that we are missing our purse.

24:28.520 --> 24:32.240
It's gone. He was very nice, very well-dressed.

24:32.440 --> 24:33.560
Then how is it he's vanished?

24:33.800 --> 24:36.920
Most of the bank robbers are very well-dressed people.

24:37.160 --> 24:41.960
And the way they do it, it's surprising, how they befool.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.400
Very intelligent people also, by their dress,

24:45.600 --> 24:48.920
by their methods, and the way they perfect themselves.

24:49.160 --> 24:55.000
So what happens that you cannot make out reality,

24:55.240 --> 24:59.400
and this illusion is in everything we have,

24:59.760 --> 25:03.240
and in that illusion, all the time we are lost.

25:03.520 --> 25:07.040
We feel that, "This is the house I have made.

25:07.280 --> 25:10.000
What a nice thing I have done. Such a great thing!"

25:10.360 --> 25:15.040
But if you look at it, after all, this is all dead from to the dead.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.440
You make a chair; then you think, "Oh, I've made a big chair."

25:18.680 --> 25:20.560
Now this chair is all right,

25:20.800 --> 25:22.760
but tomorrow you won't be able to seat on the ground,

25:22.960 --> 25:24.640
if you are sitting on the chair.

25:24.880 --> 25:28.320
So like many illusions we have about things,

25:28.560 --> 25:32.800
material things also. Say now, if I have, say, a beautiful carpet,

25:33.080 --> 25:35.880
like this one. It's not mine, thank God.

25:36.240 --> 25:38.240
But supposing it, I possessed it,

25:38.480 --> 25:41.640
then I have to go to insurance company.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.320
I have to look after it.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.600
I should bother now, "Have you given it back to me or not?"

25:46.960 --> 25:49.280
But if it is somebody else's, I am enjoying it

25:49.480 --> 25:52.680
very well and without worrying about it.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.280
But the idea of possessions also come in.

25:55.520 --> 26:00.160
Then there is an idea of relationships also.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.520
All these are such great illusions.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.880
They just open out, absolutely open out,

26:06.080 --> 26:10.440
as soon as you find the light of spirit in your attention.

26:10.680 --> 26:14.240
Like in this room when you enter in, you find it's dark.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.920
You catch hold of a chair. You will say, "The chair is the room."

26:17.160 --> 26:20.280
Somebody will say, "This pillar is the room."

26:20.560 --> 26:22.640
Somebody will say something else.

26:22.960 --> 26:27.080
But supposing you just push a button, the light comes in.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.240
Then you understand what is this room,

26:29.480 --> 26:31.480
what is the relationship with each other.

26:31.680 --> 26:35.320
The whole integrated knowledge

26:35.520 --> 26:37.800
about this room comes to you, when there is light.

26:38.000 --> 26:41.800
And this is what one should understand out of enlightenment.

26:42.080 --> 26:44.160
But the illusion is, people think,

26:44.360 --> 26:47.400
that when they are deluded, they are rising.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.880
The other day somebody asked Me a very funny question

26:50.080 --> 26:54.800
that, "Is schizophrenia, is it a step to enlightenment?"

26:55.000 --> 26:56.520
Now can you imagine?

26:56.720 --> 26:59.240
But then I heard that there is a very big book written

26:59.440 --> 27:01.160
about this by some gentleman

27:01.360 --> 27:05.000
who says that, "You have to become mad to become

27:05.240 --> 27:06.960
a self or a spirit."

27:07.200 --> 27:09.560
Can you imagine such a stupid thing?

27:09.800 --> 27:12.520
It has not happened in any evolution of ours

27:12.720 --> 27:15.440
and why should it happen now that we are human beings,

27:15.640 --> 27:16.800
so beautifully created,

27:17.000 --> 27:20.040
that we have to become mad to become something higher?

27:20.320 --> 27:22.680
I have not heard of any mad person

27:22.920 --> 27:25.840
who becomes higher by becoming mad, so far.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.240
But this kind of a theory is going on.

27:28.440 --> 27:31.880
So you can imagine, how there are delusions

27:32.080 --> 27:33.760
and how there are illusions

27:33.960 --> 27:37.320
and there are sources of these negative forces

27:37.560 --> 27:40.680
which are giving you all the time

27:40.880 --> 27:44.560
the waves and waves of this illusion that you live in this illusion.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.760
So is doubly crowded, is doubly blackened,

27:48.960 --> 27:51.320
and that's how if people cannot find the truth,

27:51.520 --> 27:53.560
I am not surprised about it.

27:53.800 --> 27:57.720
Now this place is called as Bhavasagara

27:57.920 --> 28:01.960
- is the ocean of illusion in which we live.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.000
And we are seekers.

28:04.280 --> 28:09.520
So this one is bestowed upon by ten valencies that are within us,

28:09.840 --> 28:12.080
because we must keep our valencies all right.

28:12.320 --> 28:15.640
Even if you are in the, say, ocean,

28:15.880 --> 28:17.600
our ship should be seaworthy.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.840
Then any kind of illusion is not going to deter us

28:21.040 --> 28:22.600
if we are seaworthy.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.200
But seaworthy means, we must know if there is a fog,

28:26.480 --> 28:29.040
how to move in right direction.

28:29.320 --> 28:32.280
We should know how to overcome all the hazards

28:32.520 --> 28:35.240
of all kinds of storms and all knowledge

28:35.440 --> 28:38.920
should be built-in within us. And that built-in knowledge

28:39.160 --> 28:43.880
is, this Dharma as they call it, is a religion within you

28:44.080 --> 28:48.200
not without, but within you, which are ten valencies.

28:48.400 --> 28:53.800
As the carbon has four valencies, it has ten valencies.

28:55.040 --> 28:59.440
So we have within us already a built-in system

28:59.680 --> 29:01.680
which gives us this guideline.

29:02.080 --> 29:05.840
But the illusion is such that in that illusion

29:06.040 --> 29:08.840
we develop another problem,

29:09.120 --> 29:12.080
and that is we never listen to right people.

29:12.360 --> 29:16.960
The right people are the ten Primordial Masters

29:17.200 --> 29:18.480
who came on this earth.

29:18.680 --> 29:20.440
They have had many other masters also,

29:20.680 --> 29:22.200
not that they were not right.

29:22.440 --> 29:26.560
But major ten Primordial Masters came on this earth

29:26.800 --> 29:29.600
and they gave us complete knowledge

29:29.840 --> 29:31.760
as to how to balance ourselves

29:32.000 --> 29:34.520
and keep to ourselves as human beings.

29:34.720 --> 29:37.880
But then the question can be asked, "Why this balance? For what?

29:38.200 --> 29:40.320
Why should we have this balance?"

29:40.520 --> 29:43.800
First of all, to keep a good health.

29:44.160 --> 29:48.320
Secondly, to have a very good nature.

29:48.560 --> 29:52.560
Thirdly, to live like a human being with others

29:52.800 --> 29:57.680
and not like donkeys or like lions.

29:57.920 --> 30:02.800
It is a balancing thing which gives you a proper balance

30:03.000 --> 30:07.280
to have a proper society, a proper kind of life

30:07.480 --> 30:09.680
in which you lead a normal life.

30:09.920 --> 30:12.160
And you are not on your own,

30:12.400 --> 30:15.560
by which you are in relation with the whole.

30:15.800 --> 30:20.840
Now you see the relationship is from there to the whole.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.440
But last of all, this balance is important

30:25.680 --> 30:28.520
that you should achieve your ascent.

30:28.720 --> 30:32.800
Any airplane which has got only one wheel will not fly.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.680
Though it has to fly in the air but it has to have two wheels;

30:35.960 --> 30:37.440
it has to have a balance.

30:37.680 --> 30:39.920
An imbalanced thing cannot fly up.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.840
That's why we have to have the balance.

30:43.080 --> 30:46.320
And that is why these Prophets have taught us the methods

30:46.520 --> 30:49.200
of how to balance, balance ourselves,

30:49.440 --> 30:52.440
keep ourselves in balance and don't go to extremes.

30:52.760 --> 30:56.080
But whatever they might try, whatever they may say,

30:56.320 --> 31:01.240
we just go in the opposite direction of what they have told us.

31:01.440 --> 31:05.560
And we really go into an extreme condition of fanaticism

31:05.760 --> 31:08.040
or some sort of a torture to ourselves,

31:08.320 --> 31:12.200
or some sort of a great harm to our being.

31:12.440 --> 31:14.200
That's human nature.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.640
That I cannot explain. Why so?

31:16.880 --> 31:18.960
Why they are anxious to ruin themselves,

31:19.240 --> 31:20.840
this is beyond Me to understand,

31:21.080 --> 31:24.280
because God has tried His level best to make you happy.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.280
He has tried to give you everything,

31:26.480 --> 31:28.480
but if you are bent upon ruining yourself,

31:28.720 --> 31:31.360
what can you do? You see the sun is shining,

31:31.560 --> 31:33.640
and is giving the sunshine to everyone,

31:33.880 --> 31:37.160
but if some leaves want to get inside the mud,

31:37.360 --> 31:39.640
what can the sun do?

31:39.880 --> 31:43.000
I mean, it is like, "Come, bull, and hit me,"

31:43.240 --> 31:46.000
sort of a process people take to.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.600
I don't know why they take it.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.720
This you may be able to explain better, but to My simple mind,

31:50.920 --> 31:52.400
I just don't understand.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.760
So these things happen to us by which we try to ruin ourselves.

31:57.160 --> 32:00.560
Now the first of all, as they said about the curing part of it,

32:00.760 --> 32:02.240
which I must talk to you about,

32:02.440 --> 32:05.040
because it is not such an important thing in Sahaja Yoga,

32:05.280 --> 32:09.760
there is no,

32:10.400 --> 32:12.280
no accent on curing.

32:12.560 --> 32:16.160
I mean, we don't say that, "We cure this and cure that." I mean,

32:16.400 --> 32:21.000
it's not a hospital going on here, nothing of the kind.

32:21.280 --> 32:24.320
It's just that if you get your realization,

32:24.560 --> 32:27.360
as a by-product you get well. That's it is.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.360
But you see suddenly people ask you questions,

32:30.560 --> 32:34.160
"Can you cure this? Can you?" I don't say, "I cure it."

32:34.360 --> 32:37.600
You are going to cure yourself through your own ascent.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.640
It can work out through Sahaja Yoga.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.160
And then it becomes a headline for everyone,

32:42.360 --> 32:44.520
"She can cure this disease, She can…"

32:44.720 --> 32:47.200
It was surprising that even in the television

32:47.400 --> 32:50.400
they had put Me as a healer and I was amazed to look at Myself.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.800
What is this they have put it?

32:52.040 --> 32:55.160
So they make out of you whatever they like.

32:55.360 --> 33:00.280
In Sahaja Yoga, it is not the healing that is important,

33:00.480 --> 33:02.480
it is becoming is important.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.280
That you become the spirit is important.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.040
You have to become the spirit.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.080
Now, for example, I'll tell you one small thing here,

33:10.320 --> 33:13.240
how imbalance causes so many troubles to us.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.920
There is another center here down below, if you see,

33:16.200 --> 33:19.360
is called as the center of Swadisthana,

33:19.560 --> 33:23.920
which gives aortic plexus

33:24.160 --> 33:28.800
as the gross manifestation of itself.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.760
Now when this center goes into imbalance,

33:31.960 --> 33:35.080
it goes round and round this ocean.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.880
Also it can retract. It can go further.

33:39.360 --> 33:43.360
What happens? Now this is a center for our future

33:43.560 --> 33:45.920
and for our creativity when it comes to the right.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.880
And when it moves to the left because it has got a step,

33:49.080 --> 33:50.400
like a lotus it moves.

33:50.640 --> 33:56.320
And if it comes to the left, it acts for something what we call

33:56.600 --> 33:59.880
unauthorized, anti-god activity.

34:00.240 --> 34:02.760
So another one is also unauthorized,

34:02.960 --> 34:07.800
because when we say that, "I am doing that,"

34:08.080 --> 34:10.320
then it is ego, is created in you

34:10.520 --> 34:14.720
and which passes into that pouch there in the head like a balloon

34:14.960 --> 34:20.400
and you form a big institution of ego in your head.

34:20.640 --> 34:23.000
On the other side is this one,

34:23.280 --> 34:26.720
where it comes to the left or any conditioning that takes place,

34:26.960 --> 34:29.600
that people say, "Don't do that, and don't do that,"

34:29.800 --> 34:32.800
and all kinds of conditionings through any kind of teachings,

34:33.000 --> 34:38.800
that creates another institution is called as superego.

34:39.160 --> 34:43.840
Now when we go to the extremes of anything,

34:44.040 --> 34:46.960
how problems are caused, example of that

34:47.200 --> 34:49.800
I will try to give of one center,

34:50.000 --> 34:53.440
because there is no time for Me to cover all the centers.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.440
Take this Swadisthana Chakra.

34:56.640 --> 34:59.520
It has a very important work to do,

34:59.720 --> 35:04.080
is to transform the fat cells of the stomach

35:04.440 --> 35:07.520
for the use of the cells of the brain.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.520
Brain also is made of fat cells,

35:10.720 --> 35:13.040
and when a person thinks,

35:13.360 --> 35:17.800
this special Swadisthana Chakra

35:18.040 --> 35:22.920
converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.640
Now, when you think too much for the future,

35:25.880 --> 35:28.360
you think, think, think. I mean, people are mad with thinking.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.720
Some of them did tell Me,

35:29.920 --> 35:34.400
"Mother, you cut my throat, do what You like, but stop my thinking."

35:34.800 --> 35:36.560
It has become another inertia sort of thing.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.680
They just go on thinking.

35:37.880 --> 35:40.640
They just can't stop thinking, whatever they may try.

35:40.840 --> 35:44.160
So when this process starts of thinking,

35:44.360 --> 35:47.320
then what happens that this Swadisthana, poor thing,

35:47.520 --> 35:51.440
goes into a great speedy

35:51.760 --> 35:54.400
process of transforming the fat cells.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.000
Now it has some other work to be done.

35:56.240 --> 35:59.440
Now this is going to the extreme, to think about everything.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.800
Sitting down they will think that now they have become

36:03.080 --> 36:04.960
the Prime Minister of Australia,

36:05.200 --> 36:07.160
so what should they do to correct.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.880
I mean, there's nothing like an election.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.360
Nothing has happened, but they are already thinking

36:11.600 --> 36:13.040
for the Prime Minister.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.480
If they are driving on the street,

36:14.680 --> 36:17.360
they are thinking for all the Police Department.

36:17.720 --> 36:20.200
If they are building one house,

36:20.400 --> 36:22.040
they'll try to find faults with another house

36:22.280 --> 36:23.520
so that he should not have done,

36:23.720 --> 36:26.520
while the house they are going to make might collapse.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.840
But all the time the idea is to see

36:30.080 --> 36:33.760
and think about everything else that doesn't concern them.

36:33.960 --> 36:41.360
So this heavy load on your head makes it a big ego there.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.880
Apart from that, ego which is a horrid thing,

36:44.080 --> 36:45.960
which can make you absolutely stupid,

36:46.320 --> 36:48.320
but apart from that,

36:48.560 --> 36:51.880
it makes this poor Swadisthana Chakra work so hard

36:52.160 --> 36:56.040
that you neglect other important things in your body,

36:56.320 --> 37:01.400
the organs like your liver.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.440
Such people have very bad livers,

37:03.640 --> 37:06.360
those who think all the time, plan all the time.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.480
They will plan. Even the ladies will plan all the cooking.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.760
Imagine, ladies planning all the cooking.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.000
It's absurd! Because you go to the market,

37:15.240 --> 37:18.280
you have planned for the fish and there is no fish in the market,

37:18.520 --> 37:20.360
and you are upset because you can't cook fish.

37:20.560 --> 37:21.640
But why did you plan?

37:21.840 --> 37:23.760
Whatever you get, you bring it home and cook it.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.080
That's the best way.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.360
So this planning business also goes on too far.

37:28.560 --> 37:31.080
When we go to the extremes it so happens,

37:31.320 --> 37:37.080
that we make this work too hard and we get a liver trouble.

37:37.560 --> 37:41.360
Then we get also the pancreas out of gear,

37:41.560 --> 37:44.080
because pancreas has to work,

37:44.360 --> 37:47.040
has to be worked through this Swadisthana Chakra.

37:47.320 --> 37:50.080
When it is out of gear, the disease you get is diabetes.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.560
The simple thing as diabetes.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.280
Now in India if you go and see the villagers in India,

37:56.520 --> 37:58.600
they take at least five spoons of sugar;

37:58.800 --> 38:00.600
otherwise, they don't think it's a tea.

38:00.800 --> 38:03.560
For tea, they must have five spoons of sugar,

38:03.800 --> 38:06.600
and they never, never suffer from diabetes.

38:06.880 --> 38:11.400
But in the cities, where the people even just touch the sugar,

38:11.600 --> 38:13.240
they get it back in their urine.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.640
So something wrong with the city people.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.360
And what is wrong with them is,

38:17.560 --> 38:19.440
that they are using this Swadisthana Chakra

38:19.640 --> 38:23.640
all the time for thinking and thinking and thinking.

38:24.040 --> 38:26.480
Now another disease that one gets out of it,

38:26.720 --> 38:31.800
is the disease of the spleen, which is a very serious thing.

38:32.320 --> 38:37.600
Spleen produces red blood corpuscles

38:37.840 --> 38:40.920
according to the necessity of the person.

38:41.160 --> 38:46.920
Now, any emergency arises, it starts producing more RBCs.

38:47.320 --> 38:50.720
Our life is such that we are always in emergencies. Everyone is.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.480
Whether he is a shop keeper or he is a minister,

38:54.680 --> 38:57.200
everybody seems to be very busy.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.280
Now, in the morning first of all to read newspapers,

39:00.480 --> 39:01.600
is another curse.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.240
Because you read newspapers, you hear, "This is burned.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.160
That is finished. So many died.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.920
Somebody in the airplane finished off,"

39:08.160 --> 39:09.840
maybe our relations are there

39:10.040 --> 39:13.360
- so you get a real pain there in the stomach.

39:13.560 --> 39:19.280
That's done by this poor spleen. It goes into a big process,

39:19.520 --> 39:24.960
into a very big mechanical production

39:25.200 --> 39:27.800
of RBC starts.

39:28.040 --> 39:32.640
Now when that happens to you then you don't know

39:32.880 --> 39:37.400
that you better keep the spleen now at least

39:37.680 --> 39:39.200
little rested for other things.

39:39.440 --> 39:41.880
But just then you will ask for a breakfast.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.320
You will get into the car,

39:43.520 --> 39:45.520
with a breakfast in your hand eating that.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.400
And there is a jam in the way,

39:47.600 --> 39:50.200
and then you are screaming at, because you are late.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.360
All sorts of things happen to us like that

39:52.560 --> 39:57.560
and we go on creating emergencies for ourselves. For what?

39:57.800 --> 40:00.360
What are we going to gain out of it?

40:00.600 --> 40:03.600
With this hurry and scurry what have we achieved?

40:03.800 --> 40:06.360
So this spleen goes out of order.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.160
It does not understand the crazy person.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.080
It becomes crazy itself.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.720
And it starts producing red blood corpuscles,

40:13.920 --> 40:16.200
this thing, that thing. Now you become vulnerable

40:16.400 --> 40:20.160
to a horrible disease called as leukemia.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.440
Of course, it is triggered by something else,

40:22.640 --> 40:25.520
about which I may be able to tell you, today or tomorrow.

40:25.760 --> 40:29.000
But you are just vulnerable for a disease

40:29.240 --> 40:31.560
called leukemia where just doctors will say

40:31.800 --> 40:34.360
you may die within one month or two months.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.320
That's all they can say about leukemia.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.560
Now such a person doesn't realize that,

40:39.760 --> 40:44.160
"I have brought this disease upon myself by being like this."

40:44.480 --> 40:46.320
We are human beings.

40:46.560 --> 40:51.280
We cannot rattle like tins.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.480
We have to live like human beings.

40:53.720 --> 40:56.680
The way we rattle ourselves morning till evening

40:56.920 --> 40:59.560
is so dangerous for our being

40:59.800 --> 41:02.040
that we must have a balance in our lives.

41:02.280 --> 41:05.960
We must learn how to rest. And rest is also another problem.

41:06.240 --> 41:07.600
Then they will go to the sea,

41:07.800 --> 41:09.840
burn themselves up, completely extreme.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.040
I don't know why this fashion has started from where.

41:12.280 --> 41:14.640
Must be somebody must have put this into the ideas.

41:14.840 --> 41:15.920
You see, this is a very recent one.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.760
About twenty years back nobody bothered about sun-bathing.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.360
Nobody knew about it.

41:20.560 --> 41:23.000
When, you see, I just don't understand also

41:23.240 --> 41:26.600
the psychology of the West when they don't like black people

41:26.800 --> 41:27.840
- they are immigration problem -

41:28.040 --> 41:31.800
why do they want to become black themselves?

41:33.960 --> 41:36.240
They tan themselves. There are tanning companies,

41:36.440 --> 41:38.880
this, that, all kinds of things have started

41:39.080 --> 41:41.840
and that's how they, you know, you get the disease

41:42.080 --> 41:45.480
called cancer of the skin, which is a very serious disease.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.400
And this beauty fashion is also for whom?

41:48.600 --> 41:51.480
I mean, I just don't understand that in India people think that

41:51.680 --> 41:54.280
you are very good-looking people because you are fair,

41:54.520 --> 41:55.960
and here you think Indians are better

41:56.200 --> 41:57.800
because they have got darker skins.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.200
So whatever we have, we are not satisfied with it.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.600
But it's not so important that

42:01.800 --> 42:04.880
we should kill ourselves with this sun-tanning to that extreme.

42:05.160 --> 42:09.840
So that sort of an extreme you do it with this Swadisthana Chakra,

42:10.080 --> 42:13.600
and you have problems of this kind.

42:13.840 --> 42:17.600
But also your tension can rise if you use too much of

42:17.840 --> 42:19.160
this Swadisthana Chakra because

42:19.360 --> 42:21.640
your kidneys also become poor things.

42:21.880 --> 42:24.800
They don't know how to adjust to your madness.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.080
They way you lead your life,

42:26.320 --> 42:27.560
you don't think you are a human being.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.760
You think you are an supersonic airplane.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.720
Then poor kidneys don't know how to work you out.

42:31.920 --> 42:34.200
I mean, you are made by God, not by human beings

42:34.480 --> 42:37.000
who have made super-sonic aeroplanes, this, that.

42:37.280 --> 42:39.680
And the super-sonic airplane doesn't think.

42:39.920 --> 42:42.920
First of all it saves its energy because it doesn't think.

42:43.160 --> 42:44.920
First of all when you think,

42:45.160 --> 42:46.960
you are spending most of your energy,

42:47.200 --> 42:51.160
and actually the way you spend your energy with an extreme way,

42:51.360 --> 42:54.320
you develop all these horrible diseases.

42:54.560 --> 42:55.720
Now what happens actually

42:55.920 --> 42:58.320
when you start doing too much to the right or to the left?

42:58.560 --> 43:00.440
Now, the right side is a thing

43:00.640 --> 43:04.360
where people become extremely fanatic, very disciplined.

43:04.560 --> 43:07.560
All military people, you see, hot-tempered.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.760
You can't just go near them.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.600
If you go near them you will get nothing

43:11.800 --> 43:13.520
but heat coming out of them.

43:13.760 --> 43:16.880
They are very hot-tempered people, angry people.

43:17.080 --> 43:19.560
They lose their temper. You just can't talk to them

43:19.760 --> 43:22.040
because if you say a word, they will box your nose.

43:22.280 --> 43:25.400
This type of people are so many in this world, you can't imagine.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.160
So many of them are, I have seen.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.560
I am amazed how they exist with themselves.

43:29.800 --> 43:32.280
Why don't they box themselves sometimes? They might be.

43:32.560 --> 43:35.200
They are full of anger, frustration and

43:35.440 --> 43:39.880
all kinds of bad feelings about others and about themselves.

43:40.280 --> 43:42.440
All these people, all this kind of people,

43:42.680 --> 43:45.000
come up when you become very austere.

43:45.280 --> 43:47.160
You say, "Oh, I will have no indulgences.

43:47.400 --> 43:51.880
I am absolutely living on a shoe-string

43:52.160 --> 43:55.000
and eating just two leaves per day."

43:55.240 --> 43:59.240
Such people will thin out and they will look like mosquitoes.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.400
But I don't mind their looks,

44:02.600 --> 44:06.760
but the way they bite you, is the worst part.

44:08.960 --> 44:11.320
And they are sometimes regarded as the beauties.

44:11.520 --> 44:13.600
Then God save us from the beauties,

44:13.800 --> 44:18.360
because if they become the world beauties

44:18.560 --> 44:22.440
whatever beauty contest, you see, so, models, this, that,

44:22.640 --> 44:25.640
then they are lost people, absolutely lost to any senses.

44:25.840 --> 44:28.040
They become really stupid.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.720
Now this kind of extremity comes to the right side.

44:30.960 --> 44:35.600
The left side comes when you indulge into something like drugs.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.760
Now people might say, "What's wrong in drugs?"

44:37.960 --> 44:41.720
It does such a damage to you. It does.

44:41.960 --> 44:44.920
People may not believe it, but it does.

44:45.200 --> 44:49.040
It does finish you off on your left side.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.560
As the alcohol may finish off your liver,

44:52.800 --> 44:56.960
the left side is completely jammed by the drugs you take,

44:57.240 --> 45:00.320
because you move more towards the left.

45:00.600 --> 45:01.880
And the more you move,

45:02.080 --> 45:05.800
you go from your subconscious to the collective subconscious,

45:06.040 --> 45:09.080
and then you are attacked by negative forces,

45:09.320 --> 45:11.800
and that's why it attacks your brain also.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.760
Such people can just become gradually into

45:15.200 --> 45:17.560
into a state of just like cabbages

45:17.800 --> 45:20.360
and they would not even realize how it is happening.

45:20.600 --> 45:23.240
So all these things are harmful to us.

45:23.520 --> 45:27.240
Indulgences into anything can make you left-sided.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.760
Eating too much,

45:29.000 --> 45:32.360
there is one person eating two leaves, another is eating so much.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.360
See, all these extreme behaviors, as I said,

45:35.560 --> 45:37.160
create a very big problem.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.880
Now how cancer can be caused, we have to see.

45:40.160 --> 45:42.000
Then I will move to other things.

45:42.240 --> 45:45.320
That, supposing this is the center,

45:45.600 --> 45:48.720
and this center has got left side and right side.

45:49.000 --> 45:52.600
At every emergency, both the sympathetic nervous systems

45:52.800 --> 45:56.280
which are expressed by these two Nadis

45:56.560 --> 46:00.600
go into action, and when too much action starts,

46:00.800 --> 46:04.560
what happens, the relationship is broken.

46:04.880 --> 46:08.880
And the deities, who are controlling these, go off to sleep.

46:09.120 --> 46:12.800
And when the relationship with the whole is broken,

46:13.040 --> 46:16.400
when it is broken, then

46:16.640 --> 46:20.880
you have no control from the main,

46:21.080 --> 46:23.160
you can say, from the whole,

46:23.360 --> 46:26.080
and the cells become on their own.

46:26.320 --> 46:29.680
When they become on their own, so individualistic,

46:29.880 --> 46:32.200
they become malignant.

46:32.440 --> 46:34.560
For example, if it happens in the stomach,

46:34.800 --> 46:37.720
you will find the liver will become so big.

46:37.960 --> 46:40.200
Or if it happened in the mouth or nose,

46:40.440 --> 46:43.400
the nose will become so big. The rest of has no chance.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.160
It's a very ego-oriented stuff.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.800
It goes increasing, increasing.

46:48.040 --> 46:50.560
And also if you live with an ego-oriented man,

46:50.760 --> 46:52.080
you can become also ego-oriented.

46:52.320 --> 46:55.000
Hitler is one of the examples of that,

46:55.280 --> 46:58.280
how he made people ego-oriented and so stupid.

46:58.520 --> 47:04.200
Actually so horrible by his own great ego that he developed.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.880
So these cells also become like that

47:07.080 --> 47:09.520
and they make other cells also malignant

47:09.720 --> 47:11.960
and that's how the cancer is settled.

47:12.240 --> 47:14.680
Now to such a patient, what have we to do?

47:14.960 --> 47:17.440
You have to try to raise his Kundalini.

47:17.640 --> 47:23.080
By giving some power there at that point, you can pacify.

47:23.480 --> 47:26.000
You can give some additional, as you call the petrol,

47:26.240 --> 47:27.760
to the exhausted one.

47:27.960 --> 47:29.960
And gradually when it is done,

47:30.200 --> 47:32.320
it comes back to its normal ways.

47:32.520 --> 47:34.760
Then you put the Kundalini through it.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.600
So it makes an ascent and keeps it in place.

47:38.880 --> 47:42.160
It awakens the deity in that center

47:42.360 --> 47:45.720
and that center looks after the gross side of life.

47:45.920 --> 47:48.280
That is how cancer can be cured.

47:48.520 --> 47:51.400
It's true that Sahaja Yoga has cured cancer

47:51.640 --> 47:53.440
of so many people and some people in

47:53.640 --> 47:55.400
ten minutes have got rid of their cancer.

47:55.600 --> 47:57.840
Ten minutes, is a fact.

47:58.040 --> 48:01.600
But that doesn't mean that I am going to cure everybody's cancer,

48:01.800 --> 48:03.920
by any chance. It is not so.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.800
You see, the trouble with people is,

48:06.040 --> 48:09.800
they say, "Do you claim you can cure cancer?"

48:10.080 --> 48:13.560
I say, "I don't claim. But Sahaja Yoga can do it."

48:13.800 --> 48:15.640
"Then you must cure this cancer."

48:15.880 --> 48:19.040
I said, "Why? Why should I cure?

48:19.320 --> 48:21.480
Are you paying Me something?

48:21.680 --> 48:24.200
Have you called Me here? I have come My own.

48:24.440 --> 48:27.040
If I want I will; otherwise, I will not."

48:27.320 --> 48:31.160
You see, it is like a aggression of this kind on a person that,

48:31.360 --> 48:32.840
"You must show how you can cure."

48:33.040 --> 48:35.960
Why should I show? I don't want to show it.

48:36.240 --> 48:39.600
Like I had a very big lecture in the medical college,

48:39.840 --> 48:41.360
medical institute in India,

48:41.560 --> 48:43.880
and of course the Vice Chancellor was very much impressed.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.080
But some of the doctors they came and they said,

48:46.320 --> 48:48.640
"Mother, we will give you four patients of cancer

48:48.880 --> 48:49.760
and you cure them."

48:49.960 --> 48:53.560
I said, "I have no time. I am very busy.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.600
You better ask them to come to Sahaja Yoga,

48:55.800 --> 48:57.360
get their realization and cure themselves.

48:57.560 --> 49:00.800
I have no time for that. I am sorry. I am busy with other work."

49:01.040 --> 49:02.760
So, then they said, "All right.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.360
Do you have any file of the patients you've cured?"

49:05.560 --> 49:09.240
I said, "I have none. I have no time for filing."

49:09.520 --> 49:12.600
It just flows. It just works. What am I to write down everywhere?

49:12.880 --> 49:15.520
This is it. I have cured this x, y, z, for what?

49:15.800 --> 49:18.800
I have no clientele. I do not have to cash it.

49:19.000 --> 49:20.400
So why should I do it?

49:20.640 --> 49:22.400
It's just flowing. Those who want to have it,

49:22.600 --> 49:26.200
can have it and can work it out. But you cannot force Me

49:26.440 --> 49:29.000
that,  "You must write down and …", for what?

49:29.280 --> 49:32.880
What is the purpose? I am not running a hospital.

49:33.120 --> 49:37.200
I don't have to have a credibility on that, if I cure or not.

49:37.440 --> 49:40.160
For that doctors have to get their realization first.

49:40.400 --> 49:42.800
If they don't get their realization, I am not bothered.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.760
If they are really bothered about cancer,

49:44.960 --> 49:48.040
or any other disease, why don't they take their realization

49:48.280 --> 49:50.080
and help their patients? They can.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.480
But the patients who are not interested in God,

49:52.680 --> 49:54.840
God is also not interested in those patients.

49:55.080 --> 49:57.920
It's common sense. God has the greatest common sense.

49:58.160 --> 50:00.720
The lights which are never going to work out,

50:00.920 --> 50:02.280
which are absolutely useless,

50:02.520 --> 50:04.800
you are not going to repair them, will you?

50:05.160 --> 50:06.760
No human being is going to do that.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.160
What's the use of repairing a light

50:08.360 --> 50:09.600
which is never going to work out?

50:09.800 --> 50:13.520
So God is also like that. He has such a lot of common sense.

50:13.720 --> 50:15.720
He is not going to waste His energy for these things.

50:15.920 --> 50:20.320
The most important thing today is not to cure people

50:20.520 --> 50:22.440
but to give them realization;

50:22.640 --> 50:27.520
to redeem them, to evolve them, is the main part.

50:27.720 --> 50:31.000
You can be counseled, you can be told, everything explained,

50:31.240 --> 50:33.240
you can be brought to logically conclusion.

50:33.480 --> 50:36.320
But the aim is to get your realization

50:36.560 --> 50:38.640
and not to worry about your illness.

50:38.880 --> 50:40.680
Illness will disappear gradually.

50:40.920 --> 50:44.000
It has happened with so many people and it should happen with you.

50:44.240 --> 50:45.520
But it should not be a condition,

50:45.760 --> 50:48.240
that you come to Sahaja Yoga as an obligation on us

50:48.440 --> 50:50.640
that,  "We have come to Sahaja Yoga, you better now."

50:50.880 --> 50:54.760
That's not so, because, as you know, we have no organization.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.640
There is no organization that we have.

50:56.880 --> 50:59.800
You have to come humbly to it, and it works out.

51:00.080 --> 51:03.560
God is the ocean of compassion, ocean of love.

51:03.760 --> 51:05.520
He is the one who is so anxious

51:05.760 --> 51:07.680
that you all should enter into His kingdom

51:07.960 --> 51:10.560
to occupy your great seats as His children.

51:10.800 --> 51:13.160
He is the Father of the Fathers.

51:13.360 --> 51:16.240
He is the most loving Father you could think of.

51:16.480 --> 51:20.800
Then when we challenge Him like this, He doesn't like it.

51:21.080 --> 51:24.000
We have to enter into His kingdom in a humble way,

51:24.240 --> 51:27.280
and He will definitely bestow His blessings on all of you,

51:27.480 --> 51:29.440
because He is the one who is so anxious.

51:29.680 --> 51:33.040
I Myself amazed at the way He is blessing people.

51:33.320 --> 51:36.560
Imagine six thousand people before Me, they just get realization.

51:36.800 --> 51:38.560
Can you imagine such a thing happening?

51:38.760 --> 51:40.360
I have seen Myself. It's happening.

51:40.560 --> 51:42.800
So many things are happening today

51:43.000 --> 51:45.680
that is evident that God is very gracious,

51:45.920 --> 51:48.360
as well as He is wrathful.

51:48.600 --> 51:53.480
He is a wrathful God for people who do not take to Him.

51:53.680 --> 51:56.600
He is wrathful. And that's why one has to be careful.

51:56.800 --> 51:59.560
If you lead a life on your own - "What's wrong?"

51:59.840 --> 52:03.600
"What's wrong" is one of the philosophies people have

52:03.880 --> 52:08.000
- then you have to pay for it, this way or that way.

52:08.280 --> 52:11.560
So as a Mother I have to tell you that, "Why not?"

52:11.800 --> 52:13.360
When you have got everything.

52:13.680 --> 52:17.360
You have got the spirit within you. Is the power is within you.

52:17.640 --> 52:20.280
Everything is there. Why not get your realization?

52:20.520 --> 52:24.320
Why succumb to this useless ego which is not yourself?

52:24.600 --> 52:29.880
You are not your ego. You are your self. You are your spirit.

52:30.080 --> 52:32.600
And that spirit, when it comes to your attention,

52:32.800 --> 52:34.680
you become such a wonderful person.

52:34.920 --> 52:40.480
The whole thing is lost. Like a lotus rising out of the mud,

52:40.720 --> 52:43.520
it covers the whole of that pond

52:43.760 --> 52:46.880
and its fragrance fills the atmosphere with such beauty.

52:47.160 --> 52:50.600
That's what happens to you when you get it. So why not have that?

52:50.800 --> 52:54.720
This is your own, within your self, and the Divine is so anxious.

52:54.920 --> 52:57.240
I don't know what is the missing point.

52:57.480 --> 52:59.800
Today, I am sorry they have today called Me

53:00.160 --> 53:02.480
after this program for a radio, and I am going there.

53:02.760 --> 53:05.320
I don't know how many people are going to attack Me on the phone.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.360
You see, all kinds of things they say on the phone.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.400
But I told them I will not receive the phone.

53:09.600 --> 53:11.040
You better receive the phone and let Me know.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.040
Because all these things are subject to,

53:13.280 --> 53:17.440
I find that people use it for just call sometimes,

53:17.640 --> 53:19.400
for not expressing anything good

53:19.640 --> 53:21.840
but for expressing something that's

53:22.120 --> 53:26.400
inside them anti-God, absolutely anti-God thing.

53:26.600 --> 53:28.520
I hope today they will behave themselves

53:28.760 --> 53:31.760
and it will be a good time for them

53:32.000 --> 53:34.080
that they should enjoy the bliss of God.

53:34.320 --> 53:37.560
I must thank for people who rang Me up to say

53:37.760 --> 53:42.320
that they received their vibrations on the television.

53:42.560 --> 53:45.760
And that they telephoned to Me and they found out My phone number,

53:45.960 --> 53:48.400
because My phone number was not available.

53:48.640 --> 53:50.840
And it should happen to all of you today,

53:51.040 --> 53:52.360
that you should get your realization.

53:52.560 --> 53:55.280
So the first intense feeling should be

53:55.480 --> 53:58.920
that we should get our realization, somehow we get it,

53:59.160 --> 54:02.200
and then we will talk about the rest of the things.

54:02.480 --> 54:06.520
Yesterday I gave a lot of time for questions.

54:06.800 --> 54:12.400
And today I think we have very little time.

54:12.600 --> 54:15.080
But still I can allow you to ask two-three questions

54:15.320 --> 54:19.560
and then we should go ahead with the procedure of realization.

54:19.800 --> 54:22.080
But too many questions are not needed.

54:22.320 --> 54:23.960
What you need is your realization.

54:24.200 --> 54:25.760
Actually, if you ask too many questions,

54:25.960 --> 54:27.600
sometimes the realization doesn't work out.

54:27.840 --> 54:29.640
Not to frighten you but I tell you,

54:29.880 --> 54:31.200
because your mind starts working.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.680
You have to, you see, take it beyond your mind.

54:33.920 --> 54:37.200
Tomorrow I'll tell you about that great chakra of Agnya,

54:37.440 --> 54:40.000
which is bestowed upon the deity of Jesus Christ.

54:40.280 --> 54:42.560
That how, when the Kundalini rises through it,

54:42.760 --> 54:47.280
how He sucks in these two horrible things called ego and superego,

54:47.560 --> 54:51.280
and how you become thoughtlessly aware and you come in the present.

54:51.520 --> 54:55.880
And you become, when it comes out of your fontanel bone area,

54:56.080 --> 54:59.320
the real baptism takes place and you get connected.

54:59.640 --> 55:01.680
You get connected with the whole

55:01.920 --> 55:04.360
and you become collectively conscious. You become.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.760
Again I say, it is actualization.

55:05.960 --> 55:08.480
It is not just talking that, "We are all brothers and sisters,"

55:08.680 --> 55:11.560
but you just become it, comes in your awareness.

55:11.800 --> 55:16.360
And you start feeling the other person on your fingertips,

55:16.600 --> 55:19.760
yourself, on your fingertips. As Mohammed has said,

55:20.000 --> 55:23.480
"At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak."

55:23.680 --> 55:26.800
He has spoken more about this time than about the doomsday.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.160
But all the Muslims are talking about the doomsday only.

55:29.360 --> 55:31.880
I don't know why they are waiting for that before this.

55:32.080 --> 55:33.840
So first the resurrection time has to come

55:34.040 --> 55:37.560
because in all graciousness and kindness and compassion of God,

55:37.800 --> 55:40.600
He is going to give us a full chance to achieve ourselves,

55:40.840 --> 55:44.800
because this is His creation. He is anxious to do it.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.560
He doesn't want His creation to be destroyed.

55:47.760 --> 55:50.800
So, may God bless you.
