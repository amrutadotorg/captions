00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
i think your patiently waiting to meet mother

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.960
I'd like, to say one very simple thing and that is to to reiterate what

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.200
william da blow has just said that

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.760
although sahaja yoga heals and it heals very very effectively because i've seen clinical cases where

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.920
many many fantastic cures have been affected

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.400
basically self-realization gives you your spiritual ascent and as a by-product as a by-product you get better

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.880
sometimes it's instant cure sometimes it takes several weeks

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.720
Depending upon the nature of the problem but we have to see things a little bit in reverse

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.200
To the traditional thought in medicine and that is that first we have to fix the subtle body and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.480
Then the gross problems be they mental

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.840
emotional or physical will get better

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.520
So first we have to fix the subtle

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.280
mechanism within each one of us and then in turn

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.000
the gross problem which we call disease will get better

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.640
So we have to change our priorities

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.200
We have to first get, to the subtle and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.320
then

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520
The more common

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.680
ideas we have on healing are automatically

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.000
Put in their right perspective the other thing i'd like, to say is that by way of introduction to mother is that

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.320
if sahaja yoga is a very

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.240
rapid happening if it's something which occurs often as

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.480
has been said by the saints of india about her in the twinkling of an eye or

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.240
by a mere glance or by her attention

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.920
how the kundalini can rise shoot up through this subtle body and

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.000
give you your yoga give you your union with god you quite rightly will ask how can it be

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.240
more you will ask how can it be so simple

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.040
how can it

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.960
in fact

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.600
be granted on

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.960
how can it be granted on mass how can it be granted to as many as say two or three hundred people here or

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.240
To six thousand which i have witnessed

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.520
In india these are very real questions which i'm sure many of you have in your mind how can it be so simple

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.560
Perhaps even the question is why mataji

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.440
what about the other gurus

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.040
what about faith healing what about what about what about

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640
You, see because it happens simply

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.360
this makes the whole process all the more remarkable

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.320
So mataji has to be somebody very special

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.600
She has, to be somebody very special that on mass the kundalini will rise

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.120
In fact the saint who came down from the himalayas to visit one of shri mataji's programs in india

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.720
himself was absolutely amazed and prostrated himself at her feet when he saw from his celestial vision

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.200
The mass

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.040
rising of kundalini

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.880
in an audience of some seven or eight hundred people this was a fantastic happening and

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.720
it's just as fantastic in each one of us tonight

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.320
it happens spontaneously

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.680
it's a real happening and

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.520
it happens in her presence

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.880
But it happens also in the presence of a realized soul who has been granted

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.920
self-realization by the mother by the incarnation that she is

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.680
and

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.840
So we have to humble ourself a little bit, we have to keep a little bit of a mystery in the back of our mind?

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.360
as, to who she is

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.520
if it can happen so simply it must be something rather remarkable and indeed she must be a rather remarkable person

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.600
so

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.960
with this

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.160
thought in mind i

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.480
urge each one of you just to very simply on

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.160
The one hand be a scientist and keep an open mind on the other hand?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.320
humble yourself down to that point where you think if the blessings of god are such that at this time of difficulty and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.880
confusion

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.600
At this time when there's so much sickness both mental and physical

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:46.560
at this time when people are being possessed i heard bill speaking about possession by all sorts of entities which can cause

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.960
anything from mental disease to serious physical problems

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.560
where these things are raging around us with hospitals overflowing throughout the world

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.120
with doctors unable to control the situation

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.000
We should give some thought to the fact that maybe at this time

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.600
almighty god

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.400
in his compassion has sent a

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:20.240
Great incarnation to do the job, to do the job to awaken that which is within you that makes you

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.680
your own master

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.040
that liberates you from all this confusion

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.440
all this disease all this tension and

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.280
gives you the ultimate

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.480
it happened with shri krishna

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.160
it happened with the lord jesus christ it happened with muhammad it happened with the buddha it happened with so many of the

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.200
incarnations who came on this earth they came at a time when

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.520
The civilization was out of balance people had moved either to the left or to the right

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.960
away from that sense of righteousness and

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.840
sustainance which is the essential religion within us

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So perhaps at this time

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.320
We have to recognize

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
perhaps at this time we have to

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.080
Say, to almighty god if i am a seeker

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.440
please give me the ultimate experience that i've been seeking for all my births and

00:06:18.328 --> 00:06:22.945
So ladies and gentlemen again it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you

00:06:23.145 --> 00:06:26.843
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.960
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.560
May God give you wisdom and understanding

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.960
about the truth and about Himself.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.360
Doctor Warren just now brought out a point

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.560
that if somebody is doing this work

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.320
in a split of a second, even

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.200
on the television when it was only one minute, if it works out,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.560
then there has to be somebody special.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.960
All this kind of talk

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.040
is not necessary in India,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.320
because Indians are well educated in spiritual matters.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.320
They know what is the Shakti is, what is Kundalini is.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.240
They know the chakras.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.280
They are very well equipped.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.680
They have got the names of the Shakti in which it is said so.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:03.520
So to them it is not to be told and requested.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.480
But in the West, though such great saints have been born,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.360
such seekers are born,

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.080
they have forgotten the knowledge that they had,

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.280
perhaps, of the power of God.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:21.200
And that's why I find the sensitivity of people

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.920
is not towards understanding the reality,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.440
but more they take to artificial things.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.680
Perhaps the more we are in contact with machine,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:38.600
we become more akin or close to machine.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.800
We try to understand everything in a machine-like manner,

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.520
but not in that sensitive way, that people had once upon a time.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.160
Even at the time of Christ,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:57.080
except for few Jews who didn't like Him

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:02.520
because they wanted to have their own money-making propositions,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.600
they crucified Him.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.440
Even the judge who judged Him,

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.760
his wife could understand that He was a saint.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.000
And the people around Him,

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.040
who were simple people,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.400
all of them knew that He was something saintly.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.400
Even at the time of Shri Krishna and Shri Rama, it has happened.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.080
I agree that many saints have been crucified, have been tortured,

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.640
but not by the general public, by general people.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.600
It has been done by people who were in power,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.440
or who were prophesying some sort of a religion,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.960
who thought that their religion is in danger

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.840
because they were making money out of that religion.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.240
These are the people who did all these atrocities

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.520
and they brought forth this kind of calamity

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.040
or this kind of torture to the great saints who lived.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.240
But today is just the other way round.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.280
The public is not sensitive enough.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.480
That's a very hard thing to feel that the public itself

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.000
is not understanding what is the truth and how to come to the truth.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.160
Yesterday in short I told you,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.560
first of all we have to be honest people

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.280
if you want to find the truth.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:29.240
Is a simple proposition that we have to be honest about it,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.920
that we should know that we cannot purchase the truth.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:36.200
Secondly, the truth is what it is.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.160
Whatever are your own conceptions about truth is not the truth.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.720
Is your own idea, your mental projection.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.360
Truth is what it is. It will be for ever and ever.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.960
And truth cannot compromise for you.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.200
You have to compromise for the truth.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.480
It is the other way round thing,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.360
that you have to compromise for the truth.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.800
You have to understand that so far those concepts you had,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.280
relatively if they are not near the truth,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.960
then you have to give them out.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.720
It's a very strange thing

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.720
that you great people who are seekers,

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.360
are born in various countries,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.680
in so many countries, I find.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.400
And then at this juncture,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.840
when it is not because there is so much sickness and all that.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.960
But is a special time also.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.080
Is a time of resurrection.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.800
Is the time of your last judgment.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.400
At this great times,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.240
that people should lose their sensitivity to reality.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.480
It is amazing how people take to artificial things.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.080
So many things people have done just because

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.760
they could not see through.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.600
That's why I requested you yesterday,

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.640
you must come to some logical conclusion.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.200
You must use your brains and understand

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.440
that reality, if it lies within you

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.880
and if it is a living process of your evolution,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.560
then it has to be done

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.640
in a way that is not done by human beings,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.520
because no living work is done by human beings. It cannot be done.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.600
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit,

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.000
leave alone a human being into a spirit.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.800
So, it has to be done by the same process

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.080
which has made us human beings,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.720
and the same process that is living force of God's love,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.880
of living God's love, should do the job.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.640
So it has to be spontaneous.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.040
You cannot achieve it through your efforts.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.240
Actually, those who tell you like that,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.120
that "You have to achieve it through your efforts,"

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320
or, "You have got your karmas.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.840
You have got to suffer," and all that,

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.760
are just giving excuses.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.040
They don't know how to achieve it. They are just giving excuses.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.040
You must understand that if you have got that power within you,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.600
it has to manifest spontaneously.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.960
For example, some people may not get realization.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.400
May be little bit, very little bit percentage, I hope,

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.520
may not get it.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.600
But that is nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.560
There must be something wrong within you,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.440
physically, mentally, emotionally.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.760
There must be something wrong. So we have to correct it

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.360
and we have to see that you get your realization

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.600
in a proper way and that it is achieved

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.720
through your own understanding, in your own glory.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.320
That you should know that you have got your realization.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.920
This is the only difference

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.200
between the evolutionary process so far from animal to this stage,

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:58.480
that human beings will be aware of their realization.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.400
They will know all about it because now they have become masters,

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.520
that they are not doing things automatically.

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.880
They will know that this power is flowing through them

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.480
and they will also know how to handle it,

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.000
which can be decode through Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.560
And you have to learn the technique of operating God's laws,

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.240
which are tremendous and wonderful.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.040
You believe it or not: God exists.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.960
His loving power is all-pervading.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.680
We have never felt it before.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.360
I agree there, you have never felt that

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.960
His all-pervading power is everywhere.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.000
You have felt the ether,

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:47.280
through which we receive the television and other communications,

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.080
but you have not felt that subtle power,

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.560
which is all-pervading, not only but that,

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.480
but is the subtle of all these gross that you see.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.080
But the time has come,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.640
very precious time, that you have to get it.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:05.040
So all your other identifications,

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.240
I am sorry, you have to drop them.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.840
You have to just become yourself.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.640
Whatever you have gathered in life time,

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.240
all kinds of concepts, and precepts and all that, forget it.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.800
Just think that you are a human being

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.760
and you have to get your realization.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.600
That's the most important thing.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.640
All the rest of things are of no use.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.520
So I would request you first of all,

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.920
in all honesty, try to be the spirit.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.680
And if you become the spirit,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.760
try to understand the path of progress in your spiritual ascent.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:44.960
Now to come to the point of this

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.400
subtle instrument already created within us,

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.960
to come to this point we have to understand,

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.000
as I told you yesterday that this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.360
Whatever you have so far, is the knowledge of the tree.

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.280
But you don't have any knowledge of the roots.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.080
Many people have told me, "Mother, what Christianity has failed.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.320
That religion has failed. This religion has failed.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.800
How can it be? If there is God, how can it be?"

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.320
I mean, there are communists also in this world

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.680
who deny God completely.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.360
But is not that the religions have failed;

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.440
not the prophets have failed;

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.360
not the incarnations have failed.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.360
It's the people who represented them,

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.080
wanted to make something of their own,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.080
of their own concept, of their ideas,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.520
and the whole thing has become such a market place,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.200
that I just don't understand.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.880
How can you sell God? How can you sell His ideas?

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.800
There is no business about God.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.800
Now this one is the great instrument that you have within yourself.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.200
Yesterday I told you that you need not accept Me

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.320
as a sort of a conditioning on your mind.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:06.600
But as a scientist, keep an open mind.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.680
And this is the hypothesis I put before you,

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:14.800
and when it works out, you have to see if it is all right or not.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.600
Now some of you who might be doubting about it,

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.440
or thinking that, "Oh, it's all another story," or things like that.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.080
They can go ahead with it

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.200
because Divine is not interested in such people.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.480
Divine is only interested in people

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.200
who are honestly seeking the truth.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:38.560
So this center that you see the first of all,

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.360
is a very important center.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.680
I don't know what he has told you about it,

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:46.360
but is called as the Mooladhara.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.040
It's the center of Mooladhara,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.760
center of Mooladhara.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.560
Mooladhara itself is that triangular bone,

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.160
which is a very small triangle. You cannot see it clearly.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:03.000
We should have expanded it to show you,

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.600
which contains in itself

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:10.080
the power of Kundalini.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:14.800
Is the power of that energy, which I told you yesterday,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.080
is the pure desire to become one with God.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.440
All other desires are not satiable.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.360
That's why this is the only desire that has to manifest.

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.360
Otherwise, you are not going to be satisfied with your life.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.480
Now, this pure desire exists in that triangular bone,

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:43.320
and you could see it also when you raise the Kundalini,

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.880
is pulsating there just like a heart.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.920
But not on every person. Not on every seeker.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.080
Only those who have a problem with the other two centers,

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.800
you can see with your naked eye, the pulsation of the Kundalini.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.080
When there is such a pulsation of the Kundalini,

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.800
we have to know that these two centers

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.720
are in problem in human beings.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.200
And these two centers are,

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.920
the higher one is called as the Nabhi Chakra,

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.040
which means the center, the subtler center of the navel.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.240
And this center manifests outside,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.200
what we call the solar plexus.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.080
In the medical terminology is called as solar plexus.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.880
But that's the gross thing.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.440
This is the subtle center

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.920
which is in the medulla oblongata in the spinal cord.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.560
Now this is a very, very important center within us again,

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.920
which was created since long, when we were seeking.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.000
First, as animals we were seeking food.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.600
Then also we were seeking our evolution.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.280
Because animals also sought their ascent

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.680
from a one-unicellular animal to a multi-cellular animal,

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.920
like all the quadrupeds are or the mammals are.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.560
How they arrived it, is no one can say.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.080
because the power that worked for it,

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.440
lies in the central path of this central Nadi

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:23.800
called as Sushumna Nadi.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.520
So first we were seeking the food.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.320
Then we were seeking the shelter, as you go by in the history.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.920
Then as we evolved more and more,

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:42.360
we started seeking our joy in, say, economics,

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:47.400
in possessions, then in politics, in power.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.960
Then we evolved much more

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.440
and we thought there is no joy in all these things.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:53.720
We have had enough of it.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.800
Specially the affluence helped you a lot.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.760
Because affluent people get fed-up of materialism,

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.280
and the plastic mountains that they have created.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:04.800
And they just want to have something simple in life.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.560
At this stage then they start thinking of their spirit.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.760
They think, "How is it that we are not yet satisfied?

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.040
How is it we are so restless? What are we seeking?"

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.400
Some of them know what they are seeking.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.760
Some of them don't know what they are seeking,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.760
but even if they know what they are seeking,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.720
they don't know how it will happen, and what should we expect.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.480
That's a very important thing

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.400
where I find Indian people are better equipped.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.600
But you have another great equipment,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.360
that your desire to seek is very strong,

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.640
is extremely strong, and you go like a bull at it.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.960
I have seen people who got realization,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.480
and they were running so fast towards it

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.600
that even after getting realization

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.960
they would not accept that they have sought it.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.680
They would not stop, you see. Like a bull is running very fast,

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.080
you see, even if you offer him something to eat

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.760
he won't be able to stop at that point.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.680
He goes little ahead then he looks back, "Yes, that's it."

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.920
So he comes back.

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.160
It has happened with so many people

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.680
who have done a kind of a guru-shopping,

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.680
I would call it, it's a habit.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.760
They take a bag in the hand with little money,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.360
go round in the shop, "Now which guru is available?"

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.360
So they go to one guru, "All right, no good, hopeless."

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:27.560
Then he goes to another guru, third one.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:33.360
And Sahaja Yoga is a temple somewhere away from that market.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:37.600
So that habit is also formed in human beings of seeking

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:43.360
that even being introduced to Sahaja Yoga

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.800
and even after becoming the spirit

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.800
feeling the all-pervading power,

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:52.280
still they don't want to stop, because the inertia is too much.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.400
And it's still they are going on.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.560
But after some time, they reverse back.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:00.200
I've seen many things like that happening in Sahaja Yoga

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.040
in every place I went to.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.320
Specially in England is very common

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:07.240
that in first shot they just can't believe it,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.920
"How can it be? It's not so simple."

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.280
Because then their ego is finished.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.160
They have found it, "How can it be? We can't do it by ourselves."

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.240
So they forget about Sahaja Yoga for a while.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.440
Then the Kundalini comes and tickles them all over.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.600
Again She comes and clears them all over.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.760
Then they start thinking, "What's happening to me?"

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.760
And then they come back to Me and say,  "Mother,

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.680
I must say there was something that had happened.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.480
But I, just I was too fast. I was too speedy

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.600
and I just didn't get the glimpse of it."

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.600
All right, settle down now.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.800
So that's one thing is always common and it's all right.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.280
It's excusable; this doesn't matter.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.520
You take your own time. I am not in a hurry.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.440
But Divine is. Divine is in a very great hurry,

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.080
and the work has to be done in a very great speed now.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.360
It is very important that we have to move

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.920
in a very tremendous speed.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.960
So this seeking within us

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:08.000
is surrounded by this ocean of illusion, within ourselves.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:13.960
This ocean of illusion comes to us because of our ignorance.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.960
We see things which do not exist.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.760
For example, there is a gentleman who comes to us.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.000
He is very sweet to talk to.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.240
And after sometime we find that we are missing our purse.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.240
It's gone. He was very nice, very well-dressed.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.560
Then how is it he's vanished?

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.920
Most of the bank robbers are very well-dressed people.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.960
And the way they do it, it's surprising, how they befool.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.400
Very intelligent people also, by their dress,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.920
by their methods, and the way they perfect themselves.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:55.000
So what happens that you cannot make out reality,

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.400
and this illusion is in everything we have,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.240
and in that illusion, all the time we are lost.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.040
We feel that, "This is the house I have made.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.000
What a nice thing I have done. Such a great thing!"

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:15.040
But if you look at it, after all, this is all dead from to the dead.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:18.440
You make a chair; then you think, "Oh, I've made a big chair."

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.560
Now this chair is all right,

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.760
but tomorrow you won't be able to seat on the ground,

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.640
if you are sitting on the chair.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.320
So like many illusions we have about things,

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.800
material things also. Say now, if I have, say, a beautiful carpet,

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.880
like this one. It's not mine, thank God.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.240
But supposing it, I possessed it,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.640
then I have to go to insurance company.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.320
I have to look after it.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.600
I should bother now, "Have you given it back to me or not?"

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.280
But if it is somebody else's, I am enjoying it

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.680
very well and without worrying about it.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.280
But the idea of possessions also come in.

00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.160
Then there is an idea of relationships also.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.520
All these are such great illusions.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.880
They just open out, absolutely open out,

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.440
as soon as you find the light of spirit in your attention.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.240
Like in this room when you enter in, you find it's dark.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.920
You catch hold of a chair. You will say, "The chair is the room."

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.280
Somebody will say, "This pillar is the room."

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.640
Somebody will say something else.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.080
But supposing you just push a button, the light comes in.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.240
Then you understand what is this room,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:31.480
what is the relationship with each other.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.320
The whole integrated knowledge

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.800
about this room comes to you, when there is light.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.800
And this is what one should understand out of enlightenment.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.160
But the illusion is, people think,

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.400
that when they are deluded, they are rising.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.880
The other day somebody asked Me a very funny question

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.800
that, "Is schizophrenia, is it a step to enlightenment?"

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.520
Now can you imagine?

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.240
But then I heard that there is a very big book written

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.160
about this by some gentleman

00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.000
who says that, "You have to become mad to become

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.960
a self or a spirit."

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.560
Can you imagine such a stupid thing?

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.520
It has not happened in any evolution of ours

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.440
and why should it happen now that we are human beings,

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.800
so beautifully created,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.040
that we have to become mad to become something higher?

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.680
I have not heard of any mad person

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.840
who becomes higher by becoming mad, so far.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.240
But this kind of a theory is going on.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.880
So you can imagine, how there are delusions

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.760
and how there are illusions

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.320
and there are sources of these negative forces

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:40.680
which are giving you all the time

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.560
the waves and waves of this illusion that you live in this illusion.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.760
So is doubly crowded, is doubly blackened,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.320
and that's how if people cannot find the truth,

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.560
I am not surprised about it.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.720
Now this place is called as Bhavasagara

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.960
- is the ocean of illusion in which we live.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.000
And we are seekers.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:09.520
So this one is bestowed upon by ten valencies that are within us,

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.080
because we must keep our valencies all right.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.640
Even if you are in the, say, ocean,

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.600
our ship should be seaworthy.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.840
Then any kind of illusion is not going to deter us

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.600
if we are seaworthy.

00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:26.200
But seaworthy means, we must know if there is a fog,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.040
how to move in right direction.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.280
We should know how to overcome all the hazards

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.240
of all kinds of storms and all knowledge

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.920
should be built-in within us. And that built-in knowledge

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:43.880
is, this Dharma as they call it, is a religion within you

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.200
not without, but within you, which are ten valencies.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.800
As the carbon has four valencies, it has ten valencies.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.440
So we have within us already a built-in system

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.680
which gives us this guideline.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.840
But the illusion is such that in that illusion

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.840
we develop another problem,

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.080
and that is we never listen to right people.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.960
The right people are the ten Primordial Masters

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.480
who came on this earth.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.440
They have had many other masters also,

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.200
not that they were not right.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.560
But major ten Primordial Masters came on this earth

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.600
and they gave us complete knowledge

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.760
as to how to balance ourselves

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.520
and keep to ourselves as human beings.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.880
But then the question can be asked, "Why this balance? For what?

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.320
Why should we have this balance?"

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.800
First of all, to keep a good health.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.320
Secondly, to have a very good nature.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:52.560
Thirdly, to live like a human being with others

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.680
and not like donkeys or like lions.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:02.800
It is a balancing thing which gives you a proper balance

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.280
to have a proper society, a proper kind of life

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.680
in which you lead a normal life.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.160
And you are not on your own,

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.560
by which you are in relation with the whole.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:20.840
Now you see the relationship is from there to the whole.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.440
But last of all, this balance is important

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.520
that you should achieve your ascent.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.800
Any airplane which has got only one wheel will not fly.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.680
Though it has to fly in the air but it has to have two wheels;

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.440
it has to have a balance.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.920
An imbalanced thing cannot fly up.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.840
That's why we have to have the balance.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:46.320
And that is why these Prophets have taught us the methods

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.200
of how to balance, balance ourselves,

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.440
keep ourselves in balance and don't go to extremes.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.080
But whatever they might try, whatever they may say,

00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:01.240
we just go in the opposite direction of what they have told us.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.560
And we really go into an extreme condition of fanaticism

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.040
or some sort of a torture to ourselves,

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.200
or some sort of a great harm to our being.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.200
That's human nature.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.640
That I cannot explain. Why so?

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.960
Why they are anxious to ruin themselves,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.840
this is beyond Me to understand,

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.280
because God has tried His level best to make you happy.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.280
He has tried to give you everything,

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.480
but if you are bent upon ruining yourself,

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.360
what can you do? You see the sun is shining,

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.640
and is giving the sunshine to everyone,

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.160
but if some leaves want to get inside the mud,

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.640
what can the sun do?

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.000
I mean, it is like, "Come, bull, and hit me,"

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.000
sort of a process people take to.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.600
I don't know why they take it.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:50.720
This you may be able to explain better, but to My simple mind,

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.400
I just don't understand.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.760
So these things happen to us by which we try to ruin ourselves.

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.560
Now the first of all, as they said about the curing part of it,

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.240
which I must talk to you about,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.040
because it is not such an important thing in Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.760
there is no,

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.280
no accent on curing.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.160
I mean, we don't say that, "We cure this and cure that." I mean,

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:21.000
it's not a hospital going on here, nothing of the kind.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.320
It's just that if you get your realization,

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.360
as a by-product you get well. That's it is.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.360
But you see suddenly people ask you questions,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.160
"Can you cure this? Can you?" I don't say, "I cure it."

00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:37.600
You are going to cure yourself through your own ascent.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:39.640
It can work out through Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.160
And then it becomes a headline for everyone,

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.520
"She can cure this disease, She can…"

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.200
It was surprising that even in the television

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.400
they had put Me as a healer and I was amazed to look at Myself.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.800
What is this they have put it?

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.160
So they make out of you whatever they like.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.280
In Sahaja Yoga, it is not the healing that is important,

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:02.480
it is becoming is important.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.280
That you become the spirit is important.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.040
You have to become the spirit.

00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.080
Now, for example, I'll tell you one small thing here,

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.240
how imbalance causes so many troubles to us.

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.920
There is another center here down below, if you see,

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.360
is called as the center of Swadisthana,

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.920
which gives aortic plexus

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.800
as the gross manifestation of itself.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.760
Now when this center goes into imbalance,

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.080
it goes round and round this ocean.

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.880
Also it can retract. It can go further.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:43.360
What happens? Now this is a center for our future

00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.920
and for our creativity when it comes to the right.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.880
And when it moves to the left because it has got a step,

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.400
like a lotus it moves.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:56.320
And if it comes to the left, it acts for something what we call

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.880
unauthorized, anti-god activity.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.760
So another one is also unauthorized,

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.800
because when we say that, "I am doing that,"

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:10.320
then it is ego, is created in you

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.720
and which passes into that pouch there in the head like a balloon

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:20.400
and you form a big institution of ego in your head.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:23.000
On the other side is this one,

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.720
where it comes to the left or any conditioning that takes place,

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.600
that people say, "Don't do that, and don't do that,"

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.800
and all kinds of conditionings through any kind of teachings,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.800
that creates another institution is called as superego.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:43.840
Now when we go to the extremes of anything,

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.960
how problems are caused, example of that

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:49.800
I will try to give of one center,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.440
because there is no time for Me to cover all the centers.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.440
Take this Swadisthana Chakra.

00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.520
It has a very important work to do,

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.080
is to transform the fat cells of the stomach

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.520
for the use of the cells of the brain.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.520
Brain also is made of fat cells,

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.040
and when a person thinks,

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:17.800
this special Swadisthana Chakra

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:22.920
converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.640
Now, when you think too much for the future,

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.360
you think, think, think. I mean, people are mad with thinking.

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.720
Some of them did tell Me,

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:34.400
"Mother, you cut my throat, do what You like, but stop my thinking."

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.560
It has become another inertia sort of thing.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.680
They just go on thinking.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.640
They just can't stop thinking, whatever they may try.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.160
So when this process starts of thinking,

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.320
then what happens that this Swadisthana, poor thing,

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.440
goes into a great speedy

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.400
process of transforming the fat cells.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.000
Now it has some other work to be done.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.440
Now this is going to the extreme, to think about everything.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.800
Sitting down they will think that now they have become

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.960
the Prime Minister of Australia,

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.160
so what should they do to correct.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.880
I mean, there's nothing like an election.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.360
Nothing has happened, but they are already thinking

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.040
for the Prime Minister.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.480
If they are driving on the street,

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:17.360
they are thinking for all the Police Department.

00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.200
If they are building one house,

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.040
they'll try to find faults with another house

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.520
so that he should not have done,

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.520
while the house they are going to make might collapse.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.840
But all the time the idea is to see

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.760
and think about everything else that doesn't concern them.

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:41.360
So this heavy load on your head makes it a big ego there.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.880
Apart from that, ego which is a horrid thing,

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.960
which can make you absolutely stupid,

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.320
but apart from that,

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.880
it makes this poor Swadisthana Chakra work so hard

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.040
that you neglect other important things in your body,

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:01.400
the organs like your liver.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.440
Such people have very bad livers,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.360
those who think all the time, plan all the time.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.480
They will plan. Even the ladies will plan all the cooking.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.760
Imagine, ladies planning all the cooking.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.000
It's absurd! Because you go to the market,

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.280
you have planned for the fish and there is no fish in the market,

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.360
and you are upset because you can't cook fish.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.640
But why did you plan?

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.760
Whatever you get, you bring it home and cook it.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.080
That's the best way.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.360
So this planning business also goes on too far.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.080
When we go to the extremes it so happens,

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:37.080
that we make this work too hard and we get a liver trouble.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.360
Then we get also the pancreas out of gear,

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.080
because pancreas has to work,

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.040
has to be worked through this Swadisthana Chakra.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.080
When it is out of gear, the disease you get is diabetes.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.560
The simple thing as diabetes.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.280
Now in India if you go and see the villagers in India,

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.600
they take at least five spoons of sugar;

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.600
otherwise, they don't think it's a tea.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.560
For tea, they must have five spoons of sugar,

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.600
and they never, never suffer from diabetes.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:11.400
But in the cities, where the people even just touch the sugar,

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.240
they get it back in their urine.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.640
So something wrong with the city people.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.360
And what is wrong with them is,

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.440
that they are using this Swadisthana Chakra

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:23.640
all the time for thinking and thinking and thinking.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.480
Now another disease that one gets out of it,

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.800
is the disease of the spleen, which is a very serious thing.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:37.600
Spleen produces red blood corpuscles

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.920
according to the necessity of the person.

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:46.920
Now, any emergency arises, it starts producing more RBCs.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.720
Our life is such that we are always in emergencies. Everyone is.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:54.480
Whether he is a shop keeper or he is a minister,

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.200
everybody seems to be very busy.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.280
Now, in the morning first of all to read newspapers,

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.600
is another curse.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.240
Because you read newspapers, you hear, "This is burned.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.160
That is finished. So many died.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:07.920
Somebody in the airplane finished off,"

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.840
maybe our relations are there

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.360
- so you get a real pain there in the stomach.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:19.280
That's done by this poor spleen. It goes into a big process,

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:24.960
into a very big mechanical production

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.800
of RBC starts.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.640
Now when that happens to you then you don't know

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.400
that you better keep the spleen now at least

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.200
little rested for other things.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.880
But just then you will ask for a breakfast.

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:43.320
You will get into the car,

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:45.520
with a breakfast in your hand eating that.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.400
And there is a jam in the way,

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.200
and then you are screaming at, because you are late.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.360
All sorts of things happen to us like that

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:57.560
and we go on creating emergencies for ourselves. For what?

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.360
What are we going to gain out of it?

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.600
With this hurry and scurry what have we achieved?

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.360
So this spleen goes out of order.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:09.160
It does not understand the crazy person.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.080
It becomes crazy itself.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.720
And it starts producing red blood corpuscles,

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.200
this thing, that thing. Now you become vulnerable

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:20.160
to a horrible disease called as leukemia.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.440
Of course, it is triggered by something else,

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.520
about which I may be able to tell you, today or tomorrow.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.000
But you are just vulnerable for a disease

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.560
called leukemia where just doctors will say

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.360
you may die within one month or two months.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.320
That's all they can say about leukemia.

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:39.560
Now such a person doesn't realize that,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.160
"I have brought this disease upon myself by being like this."

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.320
We are human beings.

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:51.280
We cannot rattle like tins.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.480
We have to live like human beings.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.680
The way we rattle ourselves morning till evening

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.560
is so dangerous for our being

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.040
that we must have a balance in our lives.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.960
We must learn how to rest. And rest is also another problem.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.600
Then they will go to the sea,

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.840
burn themselves up, completely extreme.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.040
I don't know why this fashion has started from where.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.640
Must be somebody must have put this into the ideas.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.920
You see, this is a very recent one.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.760
About twenty years back nobody bothered about sun-bathing.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.360
Nobody knew about it.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.000
When, you see, I just don't understand also

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.600
the psychology of the West when they don't like black people

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.840
- they are immigration problem -

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.800
why do they want to become black themselves?

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.240
They tan themselves. There are tanning companies,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.880
this, that, all kinds of things have started

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.840
and that's how they, you know, you get the disease

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.480
called cancer of the skin, which is a very serious disease.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.400
And this beauty fashion is also for whom?

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.480
I mean, I just don't understand that in India people think that

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.280
you are very good-looking people because you are fair,

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.960
and here you think Indians are better

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.800
because they have got darker skins.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.200
So whatever we have, we are not satisfied with it.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.600
But it's not so important that

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.880
we should kill ourselves with this sun-tanning to that extreme.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:09.840
So that sort of an extreme you do it with this Swadisthana Chakra,

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:13.600
and you have problems of this kind.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.600
But also your tension can rise if you use too much of

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.160
this Swadisthana Chakra because

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.640
your kidneys also become poor things.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.800
They don't know how to adjust to your madness.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.080
They way you lead your life,

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.560
you don't think you are a human being.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.760
You think you are an supersonic airplane.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.720
Then poor kidneys don't know how to work you out.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.200
I mean, you are made by God, not by human beings

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.000
who have made super-sonic aeroplanes, this, that.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.680
And the super-sonic airplane doesn't think.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.920
First of all it saves its energy because it doesn't think.

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.920
First of all when you think,

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.960
you are spending most of your energy,

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:51.160
and actually the way you spend your energy with an extreme way,

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.320
you develop all these horrible diseases.

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:55.720
Now what happens actually

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.320
when you start doing too much to the right or to the left?

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.440
Now, the right side is a thing

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.360
where people become extremely fanatic, very disciplined.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.560
All military people, you see, hot-tempered.

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.760
You can't just go near them.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.600
If you go near them you will get nothing

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.520
but heat coming out of them.

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.880
They are very hot-tempered people, angry people.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.560
They lose their temper. You just can't talk to them

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.040
because if you say a word, they will box your nose.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.400
This type of people are so many in this world, you can't imagine.

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.160
So many of them are, I have seen.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.560
I am amazed how they exist with themselves.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.280
Why don't they box themselves sometimes? They might be.

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.200
They are full of anger, frustration and

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:39.880
all kinds of bad feelings about others and about themselves.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.440
All these people, all this kind of people,

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.000
come up when you become very austere.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:47.160
You say, "Oh, I will have no indulgences.

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:51.880
I am absolutely living on a shoe-string

00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:55.000
and eating just two leaves per day."

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.240
Such people will thin out and they will look like mosquitoes.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.400
But I don't mind their looks,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.760
but the way they bite you, is the worst part.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.320
And they are sometimes regarded as the beauties.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.600
Then God save us from the beauties,

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.360
because if they become the world beauties

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.440
whatever beauty contest, you see, so, models, this, that,

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.640
then they are lost people, absolutely lost to any senses.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:28.040
They become really stupid.

00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.720
Now this kind of extremity comes to the right side.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.600
The left side comes when you indulge into something like drugs.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:37.760
Now people might say, "What's wrong in drugs?"

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.720
It does such a damage to you. It does.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.920
People may not believe it, but it does.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.040
It does finish you off on your left side.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.560
As the alcohol may finish off your liver,

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:56.960
the left side is completely jammed by the drugs you take,

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.320
because you move more towards the left.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:01.880
And the more you move,

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:05.800
you go from your subconscious to the collective subconscious,

00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:09.080
and then you are attacked by negative forces,

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.800
and that's why it attacks your brain also.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:14.760
Such people can just become gradually into

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.560
into a state of just like cabbages

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:20.360
and they would not even realize how it is happening.

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.240
So all these things are harmful to us.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.240
Indulgences into anything can make you left-sided.

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.760
Eating too much,

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.360
there is one person eating two leaves, another is eating so much.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.360
See, all these extreme behaviors, as I said,

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.160
create a very big problem.

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.880
Now how cancer can be caused, we have to see.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:42.000
Then I will move to other things.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.320
That, supposing this is the center,

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.720
and this center has got left side and right side.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.600
At every emergency, both the sympathetic nervous systems

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.280
which are expressed by these two Nadis

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.600
go into action, and when too much action starts,

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.560
what happens, the relationship is broken.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.880
And the deities, who are controlling these, go off to sleep.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:12.800
And when the relationship with the whole is broken,

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:16.400
when it is broken, then

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:20.880
you have no control from the main,

00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.160
you can say, from the whole,

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.080
and the cells become on their own.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.680
When they become on their own, so individualistic,

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.200
they become malignant.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:34.560
For example, if it happens in the stomach,

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.720
you will find the liver will become so big.

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.200
Or if it happened in the mouth or nose,

00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:43.400
the nose will become so big. The rest of has no chance.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.160
It's a very ego-oriented stuff.

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.800
It goes increasing, increasing.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.560
And also if you live with an ego-oriented man,

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.080
you can become also ego-oriented.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:55.000
Hitler is one of the examples of that,

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.280
how he made people ego-oriented and so stupid.

00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:04.200
Actually so horrible by his own great ego that he developed.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.880
So these cells also become like that

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.520
and they make other cells also malignant

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.960
and that's how the cancer is settled.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.680
Now to such a patient, what have we to do?

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.440
You have to try to raise his Kundalini.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:23.080
By giving some power there at that point, you can pacify.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.000
You can give some additional, as you call the petrol,

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.760
to the exhausted one.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.960
And gradually when it is done,

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:32.320
it comes back to its normal ways.

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.760
Then you put the Kundalini through it.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.600
So it makes an ascent and keeps it in place.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.160
It awakens the deity in that center

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.720
and that center looks after the gross side of life.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.280
That is how cancer can be cured.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:51.400
It's true that Sahaja Yoga has cured cancer

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.440
of so many people and some people in

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.400
ten minutes have got rid of their cancer.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.840
Ten minutes, is a fact.

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.600
But that doesn't mean that I am going to cure everybody's cancer,

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.920
by any chance. It is not so.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.800
You see, the trouble with people is,

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.800
they say, "Do you claim you can cure cancer?"

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:13.560
I say, "I don't claim. But Sahaja Yoga can do it."

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.640
"Then you must cure this cancer."

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:19.040
I said, "Why? Why should I cure?

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.480
Are you paying Me something?

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.200
Have you called Me here? I have come My own.

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.040
If I want I will; otherwise, I will not."

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:31.160
You see, it is like a aggression of this kind on a person that,

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:32.840
"You must show how you can cure."

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.960
Why should I show? I don't want to show it.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.600
Like I had a very big lecture in the medical college,

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.360
medical institute in India,

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.880
and of course the Vice Chancellor was very much impressed.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.080
But some of the doctors they came and they said,

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:48.640
"Mother, we will give you four patients of cancer

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:49.760
and you cure them."

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:53.560
I said, "I have no time. I am very busy.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:55.600
You better ask them to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.360
get their realization and cure themselves.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.800
I have no time for that. I am sorry. I am busy with other work."

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:02.760
So, then they said, "All right.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.360
Do you have any file of the patients you've cured?"

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:09.240
I said, "I have none. I have no time for filing."

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.600
It just flows. It just works. What am I to write down everywhere?

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.520
This is it. I have cured this x, y, z, for what?

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.800
I have no clientele. I do not have to cash it.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.400
So why should I do it?

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.400
It's just flowing. Those who want to have it,

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:26.200
can have it and can work it out. But you cannot force Me

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.000
that,  "You must write down and …", for what?

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.880
What is the purpose? I am not running a hospital.

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:37.200
I don't have to have a credibility on that, if I cure or not.

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:40.160
For that doctors have to get their realization first.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.800
If they don't get their realization, I am not bothered.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.760
If they are really bothered about cancer,

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.040
or any other disease, why don't they take their realization

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.080
and help their patients? They can.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.480
But the patients who are not interested in God,

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.840
God is also not interested in those patients.

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:57.920
It's common sense. God has the greatest common sense.

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.720
The lights which are never going to work out,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.280
which are absolutely useless,

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:04.800
you are not going to repair them, will you?

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:06.760
No human being is going to do that.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.160
What's the use of repairing a light

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.600
which is never going to work out?

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.520
So God is also like that. He has such a lot of common sense.

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.720
He is not going to waste His energy for these things.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.320
The most important thing today is not to cure people

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.440
but to give them realization;

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:27.520
to redeem them, to evolve them, is the main part.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:31.000
You can be counseled, you can be told, everything explained,

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.240
you can be brought to logically conclusion.

00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:36.320
But the aim is to get your realization

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.640
and not to worry about your illness.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.680
Illness will disappear gradually.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:44.000
It has happened with so many people and it should happen with you.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.520
But it should not be a condition,

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.240
that you come to Sahaja Yoga as an obligation on us

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.640
that,  "We have come to Sahaja Yoga, you better now."

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.760
That's not so, because, as you know, we have no organization.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.640
There is no organization that we have.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.800
You have to come humbly to it, and it works out.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:03.560
God is the ocean of compassion, ocean of love.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.520
He is the one who is so anxious

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.680
that you all should enter into His kingdom

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.560
to occupy your great seats as His children.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.160
He is the Father of the Fathers.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.240
He is the most loving Father you could think of.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.800
Then when we challenge Him like this, He doesn't like it.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.000
We have to enter into His kingdom in a humble way,

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.280
and He will definitely bestow His blessings on all of you,

00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:29.440
because He is the one who is so anxious.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.040
I Myself amazed at the way He is blessing people.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:36.560
Imagine six thousand people before Me, they just get realization.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.560
Can you imagine such a thing happening?

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.360
I have seen Myself. It's happening.

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.800
So many things are happening today

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.680
that is evident that God is very gracious,

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.360
as well as He is wrathful.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.480
He is a wrathful God for people who do not take to Him.

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:56.600
He is wrathful. And that's why one has to be careful.

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:59.560
If you lead a life on your own - "What's wrong?"

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.600
"What's wrong" is one of the philosophies people have

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:08.000
- then you have to pay for it, this way or that way.

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:11.560
So as a Mother I have to tell you that, "Why not?"

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.360
When you have got everything.

00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.360
You have got the spirit within you. Is the power is within you.

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:20.280
Everything is there. Why not get your realization?

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:24.320
Why succumb to this useless ego which is not yourself?

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.880
You are not your ego. You are your self. You are your spirit.

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.600
And that spirit, when it comes to your attention,

00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.680
you become such a wonderful person.

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:40.480
The whole thing is lost. Like a lotus rising out of the mud,

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.520
it covers the whole of that pond

00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:46.880
and its fragrance fills the atmosphere with such beauty.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:50.600
That's what happens to you when you get it. So why not have that?

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:54.720
This is your own, within your self, and the Divine is so anxious.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:57.240
I don't know what is the missing point.

00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.800
Today, I am sorry they have today called Me

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.480
after this program for a radio, and I am going there.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:05.320
I don't know how many people are going to attack Me on the phone.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.360
You see, all kinds of things they say on the phone.

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.400
But I told them I will not receive the phone.

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.040
You better receive the phone and let Me know.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.040
Because all these things are subject to,

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.440
I find that people use it for just call sometimes,

00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.400
for not expressing anything good

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.840
but for expressing something that's

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:26.400
inside them anti-God, absolutely anti-God thing.

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:28.520
I hope today they will behave themselves

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.760
and it will be a good time for them

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.080
that they should enjoy the bliss of God.

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.560
I must thank for people who rang Me up to say

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:42.320
that they received their vibrations on the television.

00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.760
And that they telephoned to Me and they found out My phone number,

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:48.400
because My phone number was not available.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:50.840
And it should happen to all of you today,

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.360
that you should get your realization.

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.280
So the first intense feeling should be

00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.920
that we should get our realization, somehow we get it,

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.200
and then we will talk about the rest of the things.

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:06.520
Yesterday I gave a lot of time for questions.

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:12.400
And today I think we have very little time.

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.080
But still I can allow you to ask two-three questions

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:19.560
and then we should go ahead with the procedure of realization.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.080
But too many questions are not needed.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.960
What you need is your realization.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:25.760
Actually, if you ask too many questions,

00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.600
sometimes the realization doesn't work out.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.640
Not to frighten you but I tell you,

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.200
because your mind starts working.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.680
You have to, you see, take it beyond your mind.

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.200
Tomorrow I'll tell you about that great chakra of Agnya,

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.000
which is bestowed upon the deity of Jesus Christ.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.560
That how, when the Kundalini rises through it,

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:47.280
how He sucks in these two horrible things called ego and superego,

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:51.280
and how you become thoughtlessly aware and you come in the present.

00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.880
And you become, when it comes out of your fontanel bone area,

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.320
the real baptism takes place and you get connected.

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.680
You get connected with the whole

00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.360
and you become collectively conscious. You become.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.760
Again I say, it is actualization.

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.480
It is not just talking that, "We are all brothers and sisters,"

00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.560
but you just become it, comes in your awareness.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:16.360
And you start feeling the other person on your fingertips,

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.760
yourself, on your fingertips. As Mohammed has said,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.480
"At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak."

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:26.800
He has spoken more about this time than about the doomsday.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.160
But all the Muslims are talking about the doomsday only.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.880
I don't know why they are waiting for that before this.

00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.840
So first the resurrection time has to come

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:37.560
because in all graciousness and kindness and compassion of God,

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.600
He is going to give us a full chance to achieve ourselves,

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.800
because this is His creation. He is anxious to do it.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.560
He doesn't want His creation to be destroyed.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.800
So, may God bless you.
