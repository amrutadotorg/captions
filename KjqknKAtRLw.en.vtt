00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.100
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.180
At the very outset we'll have to know one thing that truth is what it is.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.480
We cannot organize it, we cannot conceptualize it

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.240
moreover unfortunately, we cannot know it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.600
at human awareness.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.220
I'm very thankful to you Sir for inviting Me to speak to young academic people here

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.100
about, as you wrote to Me that you would like to know about every type of religion.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.560
At the very outset I have to say that all religions

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.740
were created by Incarnations, prophets -

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.260
were like flowers on one tree of life. When people plucked it,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:31.100
took away the dead flowers with them, then they started calling this is mine, this is mine, this is mine.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.680
And that's why you do not see how they are integrated

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.120
and how they are absolutely from the one tree of Spirituality.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.000
But one thing is common to all of them, is said that

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.520
you have to know yourself, "Know thyself." Also it is called

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.880
as in the Buddhist tradition or say the Christian tradition that you are to be born again - even Hindu tradition.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.600
'You are to be born again.' Specially in India,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.100
the word used for a person who is a realized soul,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.780
who knows this All-Pervading power, is called as Dwijah, means twice born

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.620
and also a bird is called as dwijah, means it, it is first in the form of an egg

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.580
and then it becomes a bird in it's one lifetime. In the same way, a dwijah

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.080
the one who is a Self-realized person, is first born as a closed personality

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.340
later on becomes a personality which is one with the All-Pervading Divine Power.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.000
Now whatever I'm telling you here -

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.540
you are after all students and teachers and professors, academic people -

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.420
you have to take it as a scientist would look at it, with an open mind and if it proves

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.960
alright, then you have to accept it as honest people

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:34.620
because you're very important people, I should say, you are cream of the nation and if you understand this

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.240
as a hypothesis and later on find out whether it is true or not, then it is going to help

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.660
in a much wider way than anything else.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.860
Now the principle of getting realization

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.300
or getting the second birth is not yet very well described

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:17.640
into full texts in these scriptures because, I think, the people were not ready.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.400
But in the Indian scriptures in Sanskrit language there are 108 Upnishadas

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:32.900
which have talked about the Brahma Vidya meaning the knowledge of the All-Pervading power.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.560
Of course everywhere it is said that there is an All-Pervading power of Divine love

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:48.000
but nobody has even described that and also they have talked of the Holy Ghost but nobody has described that either.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.480
Now, how we proceed with

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.080
this research is this way that first of all

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.740
whatever I'm telling you, you have to see if it works in you or not.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:15.760
'Sahaja' means spontaneous. 'Saha' means with, 'Ja' means born, 'Yoga' means the union with the Divine power.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.920
This is a spontaneous happening because it is the last breakthrough of our evolution.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.380
We have become human-beings and there is still a little

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:39.040
journey we have to do for this last breakthrough, where we get Absolute knowledge and Absolute truth.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.800
Because we are in darkness and in ignorance about it

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:54.280
that's why there are so many problems, that's why we are suffering, that's why we do not know how to relate to each other

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:00.320
in a truthful manner. First of all we have to discover the truth

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.960
and the truth is that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, this mind

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.060
this ego, this conditionings - no - you're the pure Spirit.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.620
You have to achieve that state. You have to achieve - again I say, actualization, is the becoming, is not just certificate that, "I'm the Spirit," -

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.840
it's not that, you have to become.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.460
So that is the one great fundamental truth about us

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.380
that we are all are the pure Spirit which we have to become

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.940
and the second one is that there is this All-Pervading power around us

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.160
which does all living work including our evolution.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.540
For example, if you see these flowers here, beautiful flowers

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:06.740
and when you see them you never even think that they have come out of one seed

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.200
which was just sprouted by the Mother Earth - you take them for granted.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.420
All living work you take for granted. You take your body for granted, your eyes which are wonderful

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.200
cameras, I think your mind is wonderful computer, all you take it for granted

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:30.640
but how it was made, who made it - you never go into the inquiry of it because it's a living process.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:38.200
In the same way, we did not know how, with what force we became human beings.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:46.180
Now, within us lies this force which will take us to this last journey, to this last breakthrough

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.400
and that is here shown in the triangular bone

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.600
which is called Sacrum. It's interesting to know that the Greeks knew that it was a sacred bone

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.580
that's why they called it a Sacrum and they called the

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:12.240
fontanel bone as fontanne, means there's a fountain - that means they knew about the realization.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:17.860
Also Athena word -'Ath' in Sanskrit means also in their language means Primordial

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:25.220
So She's the Primordial Mother - they accept that there was a Primordial Mother

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:31.940
but in some religions they have avoided the talk of the Primordial Mother. They said the Father,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.260
the Son and no talk of the Mother. Might be because of some reasons but

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:45.060
how can you have a Father and a Son and not the Mother? So the feminine energy

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.600
which is reflected within us, is this Kundalini -

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:58.100
is called Kundalini because it is coiled up - Kundal means a coil. I'm sorry you all can't see it -

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:07.100
no? Can you bring it? Somebody should hold it that's all.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:15.120
Here you can keep it, it be better. Now? Better.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:29.340
This is the one coiled up in three and a half coils. That's a mathematical thing

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.620
which you will know later on but it is here

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.500
and now there are seven centers, as you see, one, two, three, four, five, six and seven centers

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:46.280
altogether, one below the Sacrum and the rest of them are above the Sacrum.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:54.280
This one is in the brain on the optic chiasma and this one is the limbic area - actually this one is here

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:58.820
and this is the limbic area with the last seventh center.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:08.260
These are subtle centers and they look after our plexuses on the physical side but they also

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:15.620
are responsible for our mental, physical, emotional and spiritual being,

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.060
so what happens that when we start using these centers

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:27.100
on the left and the right - now the left one, this one, the left one is the

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:35.600
energy of your desire, which Freud has called as psyche or things but is much more than that -

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:43.120
this is the power of your desire and all your subconscious mind is placed on this.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.140
And this is the power of action which

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:58.800
is looking after your all actions and this is also nourishing

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:04.920
your physical and mental being. This looks after your emotional being.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:12.120
So all your futuristic ideas are on that side or you can say the Supra-conscious and the Collective Subconscious on that side.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:20.660
Hume got his realization, no doubt and he said that when you get your realization, you have to have

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:26.960
Collective Consciousness - a new awareness - that really happens in sahaja yoga because he got it also.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:34.380
But, I think, he made a mistake when he placed the Subconscious

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.560
and the Unconscious and all that in horizontal lines

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.320
because, after all, the Creator is a very great planner also.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:52.140
You have seen the periodic laws in the Chemistry how beautifully He has planned out everything -

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:58.420
there has to be some brain behind it, so how will He place it one after another like this horizontal?

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:05.740
If you have to ascend, what He has done, is to put them vertically, both of these - is the future on that side

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.720
and the past on this side and the present here.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:17.560
In the medical uh..  terminology, we can say, that this looks after the Right Sympathetic, this looks after the Left Sympathetic

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:23.160
and this is the Parasympathetic Nervous system. That is when we

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:29.340
uh.. put in some effort for some emergency. Supposing, you have to run

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.420
then you use your Sympathetic Nervous system on this side

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:43.120
or if you are crying and you're feeling very depressed and all that, then you are using the Left Sympathetic. [UNCLEAR - YOU CAN USE IT?]

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.720
but when you're running, the heart pulsates very fast

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.840
but how does it come to normal, is only through the Parasympathetic activity which brings it to normal.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.800
Doctors have not reached upto Parasympathetic - they are very honest about it.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:06.400
These are the centers which are formed, like this, left and right - see

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.280
this is how the centers were, left and right - so two centers make one center

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:18.040
Now supposing, you start using this center too much, then it starts getting exhausted and smaller and smaller

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:24.880
but sometimes something can happen, it will just break and when it breaks then what happens

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:32.000
you develop diseases of a Psychosomatic nature which are incurable but this Kundalini when She rises

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.940
she pierces through all of them and binds them together,

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:42.200
nourishes them and ultimately connects you

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:48.720
to the All-Pervading power - as this is connected to the mains, that's why we can use it otherwise it is useless.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.720
So we all have to be connected to the mains then you will understand the

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.540
integration of all the religions, of all the Incarnations.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:08.160
All these days we had political problems, of course we have economic also but

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:15.320
I think, we are threatened with one big problem, is fundamentalism or fanaticism.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.380
This comes because of our ignorance and that is why

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.200
you have to have a complete realization of yourself

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:35.740
and in the light of your Spirit you can see very clearly that all these religions are -

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:39.940
these are the milestones of our evolution

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:46.440
and all these great people appeared on these centers - they created these centers

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:56.380
to propound a religion. At the beginning every religion was just the same.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:03.300
Like in Christian religion Thomas, who was travelling from, from uh..

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.800
Egypt to India, has left some treatise written in a jar

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.340
which were discovered about 48-50 years back and have been now decoded

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.460
and it's all they're talking about this experience of sahaja yoga

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.500
and about vibrations and all - there's a very nice book on that called as Gnostics.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.260
Now they were called as Gnostics, the people who were realized souls, so 'Gn'. 'Gn' word comes from Sanskrit 'Gn', "Gn' means the knowledge.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:39.540
Now the idea of knowledge we think is mental, is a mental feat - it is not. If knowledge

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:45.660
was mental, then there would have been no problem. Because everybody thinks differently

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:53.160
everyone thinks, they're so self-opiniated, everyone thinks our religion is the best. I mean, you ask anyone, you ask a Jew, he'll say,

00:15:53.500 --> 00:16:00.480
"All others are not chosen ones, we are going to go  Heaven," everybody believes like that. You ask Muslims they'll say the same, Hindus will say the same,

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.920
Christians will say the same. But all of them are quite capable of committing any sin they want to.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:13.620
We should face the reality as it is. Why if they profess a religion, why should they not

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.400
be practising it compulsorily? But because they're professing it from your mind,

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:26.520
it's not working out in their being. To work it out in their being, they have to have

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:32.720
connection with this All-Pervading power which gives them the pure knowledge and

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.260
a personality which we can call as universal personality

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:46.000
because Spirit is the Universal being within us in our heart - is the reflection of the God Almighty.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.940
And this Spirit when it comes into our attention, it becomes

00:16:53.460 --> 00:17:01.260
such a light within us, that the light of the attention itself acts.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:10.560
For example, any such person who has evolved to that state, can just put attention to something and can work out wonders.

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.520
Even a glance of such a person can be very purifying

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:24.460
but that you have to develop after you have established your relations with this All-Pervading power.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.360
It is remarkable how after coming to sahajayoga

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:39.080
the first time I met seven hippies in England. They were all professors like you

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.060
and, and they were, [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:50.960
uh.., uh.. lawyers and doctors, very capable people, all of them, seven of them -

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:58.660
two were French, two French ladies and I asked them,

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:05.600
"Why are you taking all these things?" He said, "No, no we, this is all in seeking we're doing." They were quite convinced about their own achievements

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.400
but once they got their realization, overnight they gave up all their drugs about which they were

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:19.340
on My head that drug is very important - overnight they wouldn't take it. Now what happened actually

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:28.020
that - I give a simile always which is very simple to understand - that if you have a snake in your hand

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.940
and it's all darkness, you cannot see it and you're very obstinate, somebody tells you, "It's a snake," [UNCLEAR] "No, it's a rope

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.300
and it's not a snake," till the snake bites you you're not going to leave it. So

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.320
when the light comes in, even a little bit, you see the snake, you just drop it.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.760
In the same way it has happened with these people

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:57.060
and as I know I always say that they're very hard nuts to crack - these English are - but once they're cracked,

00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.440
they are tremendous people.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:07.960
Then they went into all their scholarships, found everything about the Kundalini everything and today they are one the foundations of sahaja yoga.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:15.920
So, I have to tell you that this power is your own,

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:23.800
She's actually your mother, individual mother and She has got everything recorded about you within Herself

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:30.560
and She is your own energy. She has to just rise and

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:36.740
get you connected with this All-pervading power, then you realize how great you are!

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:45.680
Just now we feel so frustrated about ourselves. We don't know what is the purpose of our life, why are we here -

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:53.520
I mean, I meet young people who are really very frustrated and they do all kinds of things out of frustration but there is nothing to frustrate

00:19:54.080 --> 00:20:00.940
because once you get this realization, gradually you start feeling

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:07.180
your Divinity within yourself, your greatness within yourself but the

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:15.820
immediate effect is that, you start feeling the cool breeze in, on your fingertips, start feeling cool breeze

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.780
blowing out of your head and when you want to use

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:29.560
this power, you are amazed to find out

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:37.260
how tremendously powerful person you are! You can give realizations to people,

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.760
you can raise their Kundalini - no saints, so far, did that, I must tell you.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:48.380
Nobody could do because the time was not such. Today the time is very special

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:55.580
when this All-Pervading power has become extremely dynamic. We call it, now Kaliyuga is

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:01.640
in parallel growing with Kritayuga - means where it is working out,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:13.060
where it is working out and when it starts working, this

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:20.520
Kritayuga is so effective and so dynamic

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:27.800
that I've seen thousands get realization. First time when I went to Russia -

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:37.000
they had never seen Me, they don't know anything about Me, nothing - they just saw My photograph. I must say, there's one thing about Russians

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:44.640
they're very introspective people, extremely introspective. Anything they want to do, even if they have to do a hair-do

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:52.440
they'll think, "Why should I do, what is the need?" Anything they do it, they introspect it, "What is the need to do this?"

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:58.500
Even if they fall in love, they first of all see and then fall whether she should, they should fall or not?

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:06.460
So they're extremely introspective by nature and their style of life you can see from the way Tolstoy has written and

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:14.560
other books like 'Crime and Punishment' - throughout - they're extremely introspective. Even the, even the hero and heroines of theirs

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:20.100
pictures, if you see the films, they too are extremely introspective, is a

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:28.380
different type of uh.. uh...category, I think, of their uh.. personality that they always introspect.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.380
But they saw My photograph, just with My photograph and not even photograph, it's a

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:39.100
posters, you won't believe, we have 16000 people

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:46.100
thrice and we had to arrange stadiums for them and they all got realization.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:54.100
And forty doctor, I'm sorry four hundred doctors are practising sahaja yoga there

00:22:54.640 --> 00:23:02.140
out of which forty are in Moscow itself and there are two hundred scientist who are practising sahaja yoga.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:09.740
The Ministry of Education has written beautiful letter to Me and Ministry of Agriculture wants

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:16.980
us to show the experiments with sahaja yoga. I thought they're so open-minded also, they're not conditioned at all by anything.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.620
They're such simple people and such clean people -

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:30.900
their administration might have been bad, their government might have been bad, whatever it is but I think they had lot of time

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:37.980
and they could think about all those things which are inside us

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:45.440
or perhaps, like in India we have very good climate all the time so people didn't have to fight the nature so much

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:49.840
so they went to the jungles and forests and meditated and tried to find out

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.020
what is the way out, out of this human bondage.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:02.760
This is very much seen there in Russia where there is no talk of God, no talk of religion,

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:10.200
no talk of Spirit. But to Me they did not challenge it and the best part of it

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.020
the way the love is expressed in sahaja yoga was best seen

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:21.480
when about twenty German sahaja yogis rushed to Russia to give them realization

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:27.520
and they were so gentle, so kind you can't believe they come from the same [UNCLEAR] -

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:33.240
nothing, extremely gentle, so soft-spoken

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:41.900
they gave them realization, they worked there, they stayed there, they worked very hard and they told Me that, "Mother, it was very necessary

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.940
for us to come here for what our forefathers have done."

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:53.920
Such love, such understanding, I've never seen anybody

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:58.600
going into discussions, arguments even if they are five thousand together

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.080
I've never seen them discuss, discussing something. Like in India we have a seminar

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:10.400
where there are people - this time were from fifty-five countries. Of course we have centers in forty-five

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:18.260
but there were people from from all Eastern Bloc and everywhere and such understanding and love

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:23.800
and pure love. There's no problem of this woman running with that man - nothing of the kind.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:32.700
They're so innocent and so pure, I never had such problems in sahaja yoga. If somebody carried on with this thing he just

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.060
goes out of sahaja yoga very easily - no problems.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.340
So, I would say that this new race of people, sort of, are created.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:48.800
They respect every religion. You'll be surprised we have got Jews, many Jews in sahaja yoga -even in Israel we have a center.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.540
They all respect Christ as even Christians would not respect.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:03.660
We have Muslims, we have some Muslims here also. They all respect Shri Krishna as much as they would respect

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:10.340
Mohammad Sahab and there are many Hindus here who got angry with [UNCLEAR]

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.680
this fellow who published things against Mohammad Sahab.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:24.540
[UNCLEAR - SALMARASHTI?]  so angry with him, they couldn't bear it because we all know he was

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.720
one of the Incarnations of the Primordial master.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:35.240
He has said that, "At the time of resurrection  your hands will speak," and this is exactly what is happening in sahaja yoga.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:43.740
The another thing that happens to you, apart from that you know the Absolute knowledge and Absolute

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:52.000
love within yourself. Still, there's one more thing happens to you, that you don't feel you're doing anything

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:59.860
you just feel, it's done. You talk in third person - it's done, it's going. It's in a third person you start talking.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.720
People ask Me how's it I travel every third day at this age of Mine;

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:11.260
I don't feel tired because I don't travel, I don't know, I'm just sitting there, I'm just, never feel that way, I never think about it.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:18.640
Because you reach a state, in the beginning only which we call as thoughtless awareness, Nirvichar samadhi

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.120
where you become thoughtless, means there is no future, there's no past but you stand in the present

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:33.960
and in that state you start growing. When you're thoughtless, you just feel the abstract joy of everything.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:41.280
You do not think about it, don't waste energies on thinking but you get inspirations of very highest quality,

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:47.160
you get so dynamic, [ASIDE - IT'S ALL RIGHT], very dynamic with your creativity.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:54.880
There are now musicians who have come here uh... to Australia just to express their

00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:03.060
feeling of gratitude because they got their realization and they became very great musicians. There are many great musicians today in India -

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:09.460
one of them had been here Jalota, who got his realization now - he's a very great musician, very well known,

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:17.000
Amjad Ali, so many of them are there. They may be Muslims, Hindus, anything - they all get the blessings of their own Self

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:23.480
and they become great musician. Then we have students who were very dull students

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:30.100
they were brought to us - now they're earning all the scholarships, bagging all of them and some students

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:37.700
have, who got realization have got through very difficult examinations, in India, in record time

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.020
because when the Kundalini comes into your head

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:49.280
you start using much more part of your brain than you normally use and you really become extremely intelligent

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.420
but this intelligence has a capacity to cheat itself - it does not.

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:59.960
It doesn't like to cheat; It becomes a righteous intelligence, becomes

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:05.620
an intelligence which tells you what is benevolent for you and benevolent for other.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:10.620
So the sahaja yoga is now the

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:16.400
stage where human-beings have to reach. This transformation is going

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:22.960
to solve the problems because if you see basically all our problems come because of human-beings

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:30.580
but if you're transformed all your problems will be solved. Ecological problem comes because we have no balance.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:38.980
With this you develop a balance. Because of balance you know how far to go with any production,

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:44.780
with any consumption and the whole economic laws settle down into a beautiful balance.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:53.180
All problems that you face today are only because of the ego of human-beings or their conditionings.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:30:00.200
If you can get rid of it, then you become a pure personality, you become part and parcel of the whole

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:06.760
and you become a global personality and that's how you can solve global problems.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:15.080
See, in this time I would like because you're academics who're here, academicians, you to ask Me some questions - would be good idea.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:21.460
I, I think in this little time I cannot elaborately tell you all about it but I've got

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:29.480
I think, three thousand or four thousand tapes of Mine, only in English language, which you can see later on and find out about it

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:37.720
but just now, I think, I have told you whatever was possible in this short time. I would like you

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:44.660
to ask Me some questions which are relevant with it because I'm not a politician. I'm not a politician,

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:50.860
I'm not here to take any money from you, nothing of the kind - I'm just telling you the key.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:59.160
Whatever was not so far told in the Scriptures, I'm going to tell you and this will prove that all the scriptures are correct,

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:06.660
all these Incarnations were correct and also prove that there is God Almighty Who is looking after us.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:14.860
It is said that there is some moment [UNCLEAR] about your future and and your past.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:22.160
and [UNCLEAR] You said nothing

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.580
[UNCLEAR]

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.840
[UNCLEAR]

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:38.680
He says, "If at this moment of realization we cut off ourselves from the past and the future are we then nothing?"

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:45.580
Ha, ha, that's what you think. Actually, you do not, you cannot cut off. Try - you cannot, can you?

00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:54.720
- [UNCLEAR]
- No. What happens actually, when this happening takes place then you rise

00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:03.520
like, I would say, like this, your attention starts rising like this and it pulls out, your attention is pulled out from the sides

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:10.220
and you go in the center. Now [UNCLEAR -AS OR IF?] you know, past doesn't exist and -

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:16.920
because it finished now and future also doesn't exist.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:22.200
What exists is the present and we always miss the present which is existing

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:28.260
- Show at the moment present exists.
- Every moment, every moment, every moment.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.400
Now see, now I've seen you today, alright. Listen to Me, listen to Me,

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:41.820
listen Me. As human-beings only, I'm a human-being too, I'll, I'm - just listen to Me, one minute, one minute, one. minute -

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:50.100
You see, I'm looking at you, alright now. Now I've seen you once. Once I've seen you at this moment

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:58.540
- listen Me - I've seen you. Anytime, this moment, I can again

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:05.460
picturize completely - how you were sitting, what dress you're wearing - it's like a picture

00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:14.540
when you know how to live in the present. You take a photograph - can you take a photograph of the past or the future? You cannot

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:21.580
of the present only - so the whole thing become completely known to you. Your memory becomes tremendous.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.980
You don't live in the past, you don't live but you know - it's the whole library in your head

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:35.880
that anything that you have seen, anything you have known, is just recorded there - you don't forget anything.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:42.000
- [UNCLEAR]
- Beg your pardon?
- What you said before, when You said that [UNCLEAR]

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:49.840
You didn't hear Me properly. I think, you are thinking about yourself that might be the reason. I didn't say that, I said you stand in the present

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.980
I say that, I never say cut off, I said you stand in the present.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:34:00.720
Now try to open your head little bit and try to understand what I'm trying to say because this is going to help you very much.

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:18.440
From the time we're born to the time that we're now [UNCLEAR] must realize that

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:27.100
we could see and get a lot of people and [UNCLEAR]

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:33.080
that I don't think in the decorative

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.960
in it's quicker way [UNCLEAR] Can You explain that more?

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:43.920
Yes it looks quite fantastic, I know but supposing you are in the water, deep waters

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:51.140
and you are seeing the waves coming on you, then you are afraid of the waves but supposing by some chance

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:57.220
you're taken up in a boat, then you see at that little time

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:05.760
you see the waves alright but you're not afraid of them but supposing you learn how to swim, then you can jump back

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:12.740
and can save other people. It's like that, is your human

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:21.720
personality expands in that manner so that you become a witness of the whole thing

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:27.820
and then you can solve the problem much better. You can say, as a wheel is moving

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:36.120
but the axis of the wheel is absolutely silent. If you are in the wheel, then you are worried and upset and hurt

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:41.060
but if you are at the point, at the axis, then

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.900
you see the wheel moving but you are at standstill.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:52.480
It's a state in which you have to go. I understand at human level as it is from birth to death

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:59.400
we do not see this say, we get hurt and people hurt you, we also hurt others without knowing

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:06.260
that we are hurting others but when you are at the axis, you never hurt others

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:12.420
nor others can hurt you because you never get the hurt - you're beyond them.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.400
Now I have to answer you, now what is it?

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:23.940
[UNCLEAR]

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.680
audiences [UNCLEAR]

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.100
and I want to ask You, You are saying the same message?

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:39.760
No, no, no, no, not at all, not at all. We had five people affected by her yesterday and we had a very bad time - nothing of the kind.

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:45.180
Firstly, there should be no chanting in sahaja yoga, nothing of the kind, nothing to be done like that

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:53.100
because you're not yet connected - why are you chanting? If your telephone is not connected, how can you

00:36:53.740 --> 00:37:01.140
chant so first connection is to be established. Is all wrong, is all money making proposition - you cannot make money.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:08.060
This is one thing you please understand all of you. If you are going to run after people who are making money, you are in for trouble,

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:15.780
no doubt. Yesterday we had five people who were affected by this lady, she has taken from them lot of money.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:21.600
Last year this time she said it was bargain for others - imagine! It's a shopping going on.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:27.480
How can you pay for the living thing? I mean, how much do you pay to the Mother Earth?

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:40.640
- Yes, just a minute, yes.
- [UNCLEAR]

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:47.540
- [UNCLEAR]
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] What is it?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:55.420
How is it possible if you attain communal consciousness, how can you still have a personality of your own?

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:58.900
Oh, you have a larger personality, that's all.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:07.760
See now, a man who is living in his hut all the time he is even afraid of seeing another person.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:13.240
Then he comes out of that in the village, then he changes his personality.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:21.140
Then a person who travels a lot, his personality is changed - your personality expands

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:26.140
when you become a universal being, you expand.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:38.660
- Now, what is it?
- Can You tell me have You as a person, Mother
- I knew you're going to ask this question only

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:43.980
- [ALL LAUGH] yeah, but I'm not going to tell anything about Myself.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.640
The reason is this. Christ said that,

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:56.100
He was the Son of God, which He was, no doubt. He was the Son of God - you can prove it

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:03.520
but when he said that they crucified Him. People are so stupid, they cannot bear any truth, you see.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:12.460
What was the need to crucify Him? If He said He was the Son of God, what, what mistake did He commit? But for that He was crucified.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:20.480
So when you're dealing with stupid people you have to be careful.[PEOPLE LAUGH] That's what I have learnt a lesson. You see, people are very stupid.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:27.220
They cannot stand the truth and that's why is not proper to tell anything about Yourself, to claim anything -

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:33.180
just to keep quiet. When you get your realization you will know. It's written down through

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:38.880
realization only you can understand the Spirit - there's no other way out.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:45.520
Because, like you have to have a microscope to see through for the cells, in the same way

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:52.740
you have to have your realization otherwise you cannot understand. Anybody who comes in, wears a

00:39:53.020 --> 00:40:00.900
uh.. saffron dress, people start prostrating before that person without understanding whether is it real or not.

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:07.160
So first, My request is, you get your realization. If you get your realization - which is also not a guarantee -

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:12.200
if you get your realization then you can start understanding who am I.

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:18.560
I'm not going to claim anything whatsoever, I've become very clever and I have to do My work - I don't want to get crucified.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:25.700
[ALL LAUGH AND CLAP]

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:29.180
[ALL LAUGH AND CLAP]

00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:37.380
[UNCLEAR]

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:43.200
- What is it?
- What is the importance of faith?
- Annh?
- What is the importance of faith? Do we

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:49.820
- determine our own destiny or does God determine our destiny?
- What is the importance of faith
- Yeah

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:57.000
- we determine our destiny
- or does God determine?
- Yeah. What is God - this is also the in the same question?

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:03.520
No. The faith is that

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:10.700
it could be blind faith, it could be intuitive faith and it could be

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:17.020
- a real faith. Faith can be
- He said fate
- Annh?
- Fate, fate
- What?

00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:21.140
He said Fate, fate, 'f-i-t-e'

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:28.800
- Fight faith?
- Destiny
- Destiny,  fate
- To fight? I didn't [UNCLEAR], what did you say?

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:35.900
- He said fate, I'm sorry to know.  He said fate not faith
- Faith?
- Fate, f-a--t-e
- Fate, fate, annh

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:42.220
That's what I was wondering how does it go with faith and destiny, all these questions together. Alright.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:51.300
Now, our destiny is only one and that is that, we become the Spirit - that's our destiny

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.980
for which you don't have to fight, don't have to do anything.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:00.100
After you become a realized soul you enter into the Kingdom of God

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:05.240
and then you will realize that you are the most fortunate person.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:17.040
I'm sorry I, I, that's what I was wondering how can faith and destiny, are two things you are talking.

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.800
- Yes
- [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.340
- Faith?
- Yeah
- Faith also?
- Yeah

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:31.500
So the faith, you see, some people have just blind faith into [UNCLEAR - THING?]

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:39.060
and some people have a faith, as I told you, of another kind which is intuitive.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.240
Some people are very intuitive and their faith is absolutely alright and some people have

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:52.340
a faith which our realized souls have, a real faith in the real thing because they see clearly.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.860
The blind faith could be uh... coming from some conditionings,

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:03.000
like I'm born in a particular religion, so I must have faith in that religion.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.920
I might have been born in some other religion in last life but because I'm born in one religion

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:14.040
I think, this is my faith, this is my religion. That's one but

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:22.260
every human-being should use logic and see that, "Alright, my faith in this religion is alright

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:29.080
but are the people who are following this religion, are they practising it or not?

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:34.820
Am I able to practise it or not?" That's why I said, introspection is very important.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:41.920
If you introspect, then you can find out that your faith is not justified

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.740
because you're having faith in people. Say if I have faith in a temple,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:52.040
I go and see in the temple that the priest is not a man of honesty

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:59.220
or he's a money-maker or he has all other problems then I should not go to such a temple where such a priest is sitting - isn't it?

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:06.040
This is what happened to Martin Luther, is happened to Mohammad Sahab, to so many people that they challenged

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:12.980
all these wrong things that were going on. Even Christ, He challenged, you see. So

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:20.900
this is one thing one has to see, through introspection, that whatever faith I'm following, I'm just doing it because my father has told you

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:28.160
or my mother has told me or am I just following it with proper understanding and logic behind it.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:35.900
But the intuitive is, some people are born intuitively, I think they're born realized perhaps, that they just shun these things.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:43.240
I would say, one of the examples is Khalil Gibran. Khalil Gibran, if you read him, he's absolutely you can make out he's a realized soul.

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:51.960
Then, C.S. Lewis is another one, then we have William Blake, so many people, Mozart - so many of them were born realized.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:59.880
Intuitively they knew, even Einstein, Newton - intuitively they knew what was right -

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:06.760
in their lifestyle - Abraham Lincoln, Gorbachev is another one. So these people are

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:14.580
intuitively having a faith though uh..[UNCLEAR] they do not know that they are born realized people.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:20.720
But intuitively they good and they always do good to others, they always look for good,

00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:28.860
they're very righteous in their own character, in their behaviour and you cannot find faults with them. Or we can say saints, you see.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.920
We in India such people are called as saints whether they are householders or not - they're called as saints

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.240
and such saints we have had luckily, quite a lot of people.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.400
They have no respect for people who just have some position or power

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:52.440
like we had one in Nizamuddin in, we had one great saint called Hazrat Nizamuddin, in Delhi,

00:45:52.700 --> 00:46:00.220
and a horrible king, Muslim king was ruling and he was a very uh.. cruel person.

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:08.660
He asked this Nizamuddin that, "You come and salute to me." He said, "I will not, I will not salute. You are not the one whom I regard

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:16.760
as something higher than me - I will not salute to you." And he was very angry and then he told him that, "If you do not come and salute to me

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:24.920
and by such and such date, I will cut your neck," and you'll be amazed, one day before that the neck of this king was cut

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:31.160
by someone. It's very surprising. This, this is a true story I'm telling you.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.100
Like, you see, many of the saints have suffered because they wouldn't give up.

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:41.860
They wouldn't give up their truth so these are, I would call, intuitive but they are born realized people

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:47.380
of past lives, great people. These days there are many children who are born like that

00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:53.420
and they are of that quality and you can see them in a group like this, you see, these people are sitting

00:46:53.600 --> 00:47:01.080
the way they ask questions, the way know, you can see their alertness about it. They never ask stupid questions, never, they're

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:08.740
so much there that you understand how uh.. they are just in tune with the reality.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:16.560
So there are people like that. Then there are people who get realization. Once they get realization, then they start feeling these vibrations and all that

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:23.720
and on that they judge the truth. You get ten children, tie their eyes up and ask them to

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:30.800
ask the questions like ask them uh.., "What's wrong with this gentleman who's sitting before you?"

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:38.320
Now they can't see the man but they immediately tell you, they'll raise one eye, finger. This finger means something wrong with the throat.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:45.980
You ask the gentleman, "Is something wrong with your throat?" He said, "Yes, but how do you know?" I said, "The children are telling Me.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:53.980
"When?" "They showed Me the finger." So it is a knowledge, just like I would say, you become a Divine

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.500
uh.. computer, you become a Divine per.... So these possibilities are within you

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:07.020
but there are other categories, the fourth category which Blake has described very well, "The men of God, will seek God

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:14.840
and they will be able, they will get to their point and they will be able to make others Godly," he has said it

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:20.060
but that category are real seekers and these seekers today are getting their realization

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:25.320
very fast with, with very great uh.., I would say,

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:36.720
understanding, very great understanding and they're, they're, they are enjoying themselves. You must see them and you'll be happy to meet them

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:41.700
and they have become so knowledgeable - it's a very subtle knowledge, this Brahma Vidya is a subtle knowledge

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:49.180
but they have become experts in it, just experts. They are giving realizations, they are curing people and they're such lovable, good people.

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:57.960
- Yes.
- Uh.. why are we uh..in ignorance, why are we not realized [UNCLEAR]

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:04.880
You see, you have to pass through this journey - first you have to become human-beings and then you are given

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:10.620
the chance to choose between Hell and Heaven.

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:18.180
You have been given this chance to be in the Heaven or in the Hell

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:25.800
and those who want to be in the Heaven can go to Heaven or can go to Hell

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:31.480
because this freedom had to be given. For example, when you were school you were told 2+2 but in the college you're given

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:38.720
chance to research out yourself, in the same way, you have to research out yourself - full freedom is given to you, research it out

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.620
and once you have researched it out, it becomes uh.. easier

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:52.380
for you to get your realization and to bear your freedom later on, which is a complete freedom from everything.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.440
Alright?

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:06.060
Now please put down your  hand. I'm not going to answer any more, there's no sense in your questions. Please put down your hand and don't raise it any more, please. Now

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.340
He's, he's using a tape-recorder or something here, I don't know. Now please ask.

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:33.380
- What is it?
- Actually [UNCLEAR]
- If we become our own masters - I think I've got your question.

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:38.480
If we become our own masters and are capable of controlling ourselves

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.120
how do other people - You, You mentioned that we can feel others - how do other people affect us?

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:48.760
You see, that's what you have to know and that all knowledge is free to you - alright?

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:56.580
How to heal them is you have to just come to see and how we can give protection to them, how to heal them, is a little more knowledge you have to know

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.960
for which if you come to our centers you can always know it.

00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:07.300
- [UNCLEAR]
- What is it?

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:11.680
- Yes, our centers not those centers.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:20.520
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] You remind Me of a very nice sahaja yogi we have

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:28.000
uh... in Greece, you see, so I was just wondering how is he here but [UNCLEAR - HE'S?] not the same. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:34.240
But he also, poor thing you see, is so separated because now they have sent him to

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:40.720
Cyprus and he's writing to Me, "Mother, please come here so I have more sahaja yogis - I'm all alone."

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:47.240
So just wondering, he has come or what here. Yes. Huh Yes

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:54.840
Is there such a thing as a national karma and national karma?

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:58.220
[NATIONAL KARMA?] [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:05.800
[UNCLEAR]

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:08.900
- I agree with you.
- [UNCLEAR]

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:16.620
Yes, but you're saying, I said the same thing that all problems come from human-beings whether it is collective or individual - isn't it?

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:24.500
Is true, but  this thing what happens is this the, you see the yellow thing that is up there is the ego, that balloon

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:32.060
that you see on the right side is the ego and this ego is the one which uh... which carries all our karmas

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:40.280
and the another side are the conditionings, that is the superego so when the Kundalini passes through, as you have seen, She pushes them down.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.900
When this center opens out, the one that is at the cross point, when that one opens out

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:54.040
then both these institutions are sucked in and that's how it works.

00:52:55.160 --> 00:53:01.120
I think he was also asking Shri Mataji , "Is there such a thing as a national karma?" Is there a karma of Australia?

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:08.560
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Of course there must be, you see we have collective karmas also,

00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:11.820
no doubt.

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:23.940
You see, there are so many things we have done in the past which are inhuman

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:29.140
even on national level, I agree with you - every country has done

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.940
and unless and until they realize that it was wrong and they really openly say that

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:42.820
it is not easy to neutralize it but they can ask for forgiveness because

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:48.440
this Divine Power is the ocean of forgiveness and it can be easily forgiven

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:53.500
but they have to accept it but in their ego they'll never say that they have done this mistake or that mistake.

00:53:53.820 --> 00:54:00.000
Like the uh.. Germans, you see, they came and they said, "What mistakes our forefathers have committed."

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.800
So one has to be very gentle about it.

00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:14.120
[INAUDIBLE N UNCLEAR]

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:22.140
- during unbearable pain.
- [UNCLEAR]

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.620
Is it possible, is it possible to receive

00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:33.020
Divinity without asking for it under the circumstances of unbearable pain.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:38.000
Yeah of course. You see, the Divinity is there all the time

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:42.600
and only you can bear that pain when you have felt your Divinity.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.480
Like Christ you see, when He was crucified at that time He

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:53.680
has asked for forgiveness for those who have crucified Him - that's an example.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:55:02.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:12.740
If you are happy and content in a general way, how does that differ from being enlightened?

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:20.220
- How does that differ from?
- Being enlightened.
- Because you are not a universal being as yet.

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:27.260
you are just satisfied with something uh... superficial, not with something deep

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:34.320
and once something will come before you of that kind you'll be shocked, you won't be able to bear it.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:41.060
It's like that. Supposing, you have a house made of uh.. things,

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:48.840
thin paper and you're quite satisfied sitting under the thin paper thing thinking, "Oh, I'm alright. It's looking after me,"

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:52.040
but when it will rain then what will you do?

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:58.980
So you have to develop yourself into a personality that nothing can disturb you.

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:08.580
Moreover, what is the use of self-contented life which is self-opinionated and self-centered - will never be happy.

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:17.240
See, even uh... Roosevelt said that, "Poverty anywhere is threat to

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:26.060
uh.. prosperity everywhere." So anywhere you feel anybody, like Buddha was such a uh..

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:33.440
great king's son, everything and he saw a person suffering uh..as a sick man

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:40.320
and somebody dying and all his comfort and all his uh..

00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:48.220
complacenses just disappeared and then he started thinking, "What's this, where am I?" -

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:51.720
you see. So that satisfaction

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:57.200
is not going to be uh.. of eternal nature but of a very temporary nature.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:07.120
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What's it, what did she say?
- Can anger ever be Divine?

00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:13.260
- Divide?
- Divine. Can anger ever be Divine?
- Divine?

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:16.700
Yes, there is Divine anger very much.

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:24.720
See, you must have heard about the God who is very wrathful, is no doubt and I'm quite frightened of that

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:30.300
because I don't want anybody to be hurt but sometimes people do such horrible things that

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:34.340
I get worried that I don't know what's going to happen to this person.

00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:47.500
Is realization the same as enlightenment [UNCLEAR]

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:54.960
[UNCLEAR]

00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:04.320
- Hunh?
- Is enlightenment the same thing as Self-realization or getting the Holy Spirit and does this come from

00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:12.200
- letting oneself go in meditation?
- Self?
- Self-realization, is it the same as enlightenment?

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:19.980
Of course is the same. Enlightenment is the beginning of your Nirvana, I'll say, is what Buddha - Buddha means to know.

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:27.880
Know, is to know on your Central Nervous System - Buddha is to know, the 'gna', 'gna' - Gnostics is the same.

00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:34.500
Then we have also another word 'Veda' from the word 'Vid'. 'Vid' means also to know on your Central Nervous System

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:40.920
not uh... mental - so is the same, is the same thing as enlightenment.

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:51.560
- Does it come through meditation?
- Does it come through meditation?
- No.

00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:59.200
Meditation is actually before realization is introspection.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.640
Meditation is simple introspection because your mind is all the time working, is not stops,

00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:10.140
so that time when you meditate before realization, you should introspect

00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:15.380
and after realization you are in meditation.

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:21.260
You don't do it, you are in meditation - that you enter into the area of present

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:31.220
so you are in meditation. So to do meditation is out of question - is better is meditation is introspection

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.880
and later on to be in meditation so that you grow.

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:53.660
Mother [UNCLEAR]

00:59:53.880 --> 01:00:00.480
[UNCLEAR]

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.720
[UNCLEAR]

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:13.220
If actors allow the [UNCLEAR] if actors allow their part to take them over, is this a dangerous thing?

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:18.540
- When they become completely the part otherwise they become possessed.
 - Yeah, could be,

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:26.120
could be with some people, could be but is better that after realization you should take it because it won't happen to you that way

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:31.560
because you are your own, you become your own so it won't happen but could be

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:35.300
possible - they can just get lost into it, it's quite possible.

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:47.860
- I [UNCLEAR] give them realization now?
- I think you should because [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.920
- Should I ask?
- Ask them.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:05.160
Now those who want to have realization should be here. Those who do not want I cannot force on them.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:12.480
Please I have to say that lot of people thinking that their classes they are to move

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:18.700
that so many people like to stay here [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] this auditorium can stay.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:26.060
- Now you are in different [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]
- If anybody who should stay, cannot go

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.900
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.880
You're all in a different area now  [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:39.100
Within these two three days can you imagine where have you reached?

01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:45.500
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] This is another one  [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:48.800
Just you laugh all the time, isn't it?

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.400
It's very interesting how you change so fast.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.940
- Would you like to come closely?
- It better, hmm
- We come closer

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.720
It's all right we can...

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.700
[UNCLEAR] and [UNCLEAR]

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:18.420
I went to Your lecture few months ago, there was a talk about [UNCLEAR]

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:24.480
- About Matreya?
- [UNCLEAR]

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:33.720
- formation of sine energy [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah
- Do You know Matreya?

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:38.280
Yes, Matreya is the three Mothers together, is Matreya.

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:45.440
When you'll come to the center they'll tell you what it actually means - Matreya, is the three Mothers together.

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.520
[UNCLEAR]

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:03.840
Oh, they're all - they're somebody calling themselves Jesus, somebody calling themself Shri Krishna, Bhagwan - everything is there,

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:11.300
I mean it's nothing new. You see, anybody says that you should ask them uh...

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.120
Like somebody said, "I'm Christ." I said, " Al... walk on the water."

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:21.520
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]  then he fizzled out

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.200
[ALL LAUGH]

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:33.060
You see, it's very easy to call yourself by some name but what they do is the point.

01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:50.920
Seems sometimes that looking at [UNCLEAR] do You think that

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:56.540
enough people will become actualized in enough time to save them

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:03.520
- Now I have lots of
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah, yeah now I've lots of hopes. Absolutely I'm sure of it now.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:11.800
It's going to work out. Most surprising is that the people who are at the helm of affairs

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:17.740
are trying to come to sahaja yoga - that's how it will work.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:38.520
So now, to get your realization uh.. one thing I've to request you to take out your shoes - takes about ten minutes only.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:13.200
It is a collective happening so, even if you get realization, you must know that you must come to the collective

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:20.120
and the collective gives you strength and you get very much corrected and

01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:26.420
it's like this - a nail which is cut out is not looked after by the body

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:31.040
in the same way if you do not come to the collective

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:38.820
you won't be able to achieve any heights

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:44.400
so you have to be in the collective and enjoy the collective - that's very important.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:51.780
It's no more an individual practice, it is a collective practice and spreading of sahaja yoga

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:57.660
so that you develop your depth. As a tree when it spreads it goes down also.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.860
So it's a very beautiful collective happening and sharing with each other.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.980
Now request you to

01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:16.940
know about two conditions we have to fulfill.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:28.400
The first condition is that

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:37.580
you have to know that

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:46.000
whatever you have done in the past, maybe your mistakes or whatever it is, are

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:53.600
dissolved by this power of forgiveness which is All-Pervading

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.240
so you should not feel guilty at all for anything.

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:05.860
At this moment you should not feel guilty at all, as I said, forget the past at this moment - not to feel guilty

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:12.900
because if you feel guilty, then you develop the problem on this center on the left-hand side

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:20.300
and also you develop with that a possibility of getting spondylitis

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.080
or getting, what you call,

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:33.500
angina or also problems of the lethargic uh.. organs within you.

01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:41.300
So it's a very dangerous thing to feel guilty, so and the Kundalini won't rise if you have a problem

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:46.760
of your guilt, so at this moment please forget completely

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:53.900
that you're guilty, that you have done any mistakes, you have done anything wrong - just forget about it at this moment.

01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:03.920
You'll feel much lighter. Anybody who might have told you that you're this, you're that - forget it.

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:10.040
Nobody has right to judge anyone. Now you have to put your left hand towards Me.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.920
Now, the another condition is that

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:27.900
another condition is that, you have to forgive

01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:33.980
everyone without thinking about an individual.

01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:42.940
You might say it is very difficult to forgive but what do you do? Logically, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything

01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:50.360
but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands so you forgive yourself as well as you forgive

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:57.040
everyone in the sense don't even think of them because

01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:03.580
they are torturing you through you. They are not tortured, you are torturing yourself

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:11.680
and it's a myth because you're not doing anything. Just you say, once for all, "I forgive

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:18.800
everyone in general," just say from your heart.

01:09:19.620 --> 01:09:27.680
Now there's a center which, I said, is the optic chiasma here which is like this absolutely closed but when you forgive, it opens out

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:34.900
and then only Kundalini rises. In these few programs everywhere

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:41.920
in Australia I found they do not forgive and I have to sit for hours together clearing their center.

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:48.560
So best is that if you can really forgive from your heart. Just say that, "I forgive everyone," just throw it away.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:56.480
You'll feel the load off your head, I tell you, just the load off your head, if you can really forgive.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:03.360
Now, these are the two conditions - left hand towards Me, right hand on your heart.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.200
In the heart resides the Spirit.

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:12.440
Both the feet have to be away from each other because these are two powers.

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:21.280
Here resides the Spirit but the seat of the Spirit is here on the fontanel bone area.

01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:29.460
Now, put down your hand [ASIDE - COME HERE THIS SIDE, IS BETTER, HELLO. COME THIS SIDE EVERYBODY CAN'T SEE. HAAN]

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:38.080
Right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side - we'll be working only on left-hand side.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:45.700
Upper portion of your abdomen. Please put your hand upper portion of your abdomen, here.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.120
Please put the left hand like this, here. Now

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:56.640
then you have to put your left hand into the lower portion of your abdomen.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:03.820
The upper portion of your abdomen is a very important center of your mastery

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:11.000
and the lower portion of your abdomen is another very important center of pure knowledge.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.900
I'm just now showing you then we'll close our eyes and work it out.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:20.440
Now raise your right hand again onto the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:25.440
Now, raise it higher on to your heart

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:38.220
Now, then raise it in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:45.340
which is, I told you, is a center when it is spoilt, you get due to guilt

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:50.600
you get all kinds of diseases. Now turn your head left to right fully.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:00.020
Now, put your right hand on your forehead across,

01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:04.780
put down your head as far as possible.

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:11.860
Here you have to forgive everyone, in general.

01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:20.840
Take back your right hand now on the back side of your head. Push back your head fully, as far as possible.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.220
Here, without counting your mistakes,

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:36.040
without feeling guilty, you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading power.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:45.840
Now, you have to stretch your palm fully

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:56.460
Put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:09.920
Now, put down your head and press it hard,

01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.140
push back your fingers so you can press it very hard.

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:27.120
Now, move your scalp slowly, seven times, clockwise.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:02.320
Hmm

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:10.140
That's all we have to do.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:20.460
Now, again remember to put your feet on the ground straight, both of them apart from each other.

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:26.400
Put the left hand towards Me, sit straight, not within strain but straight.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:32.880
Now, not like this bent or forward bent but sit straight.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:37.100
Please now, close your eyes.

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:43.020
You can take out your spectacles because you're not to open your eyes till I tell you.

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:50.760
Now, take your right hand on your heart.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:06.180
Now, here you have to ask

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:12.220
a very fundamental question to Me - you may call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:20.780
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" - ask this question three times.

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:26.680
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" - ask this question three times.

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:41.200
If you are the Spirit, you become your own master.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:52.060
So now, take down your hand, right hand upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:58.020
and here ask another fundamental question, three times, in your heart,

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:01.820
"Mother, am I my own master."

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:07.720
Again ask this question, "Mother, am I my own master,"

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:18.580
three times. I've already told you that I respect your freedom

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:26.180
and that I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:34.820
This pure knowledge manifests on your Central Nervous System and gives you all the powers of a realized soul

01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:39.920
so you have to ask for this pure knowledge.

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:47.580
Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard.

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:57.000
Here you have to say with

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:06.540
humility of course, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:15.660
Say it six times because this center has got six petals, six petals

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:21.600
so please say it six times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:46.140
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising so you have to

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:53.300
expand your upper centers with your full self-confidence.

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:59.500
So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:09.340
and here you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:13.900
"Mother, I am my own master."

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:20.340
Please say ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:45.600
I have already told you that you're not this body, you're not this mind,

01:18:45.880 --> 01:18:52.840
you're not this ego, you're not these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:05.480
So now raise your right hand on to your heart and again with full confidence in yourself

01:19:07.720 --> 01:19:14.560
please say twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:21.700
Please say it twelve times, "Mother, I am your pure Spirit."

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:48.220
This Divine power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:57.060
compassion, love and bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:04.140
and you cannot commit any mistake which cannot be dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:12.440
So please now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:18.240
and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times,

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:24.240
with full self-confidence sixteen times,

01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:30.740
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say it sixteen times.

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:42.020
Unless and until you say this from your heart sixteen times, this center won't open.

01:20:52.660 --> 01:21:00.120
Also I've told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you do not

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:06.580
do anything, it's a myth but if you do not forgive then you play

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.340
into wrong hands and you torture yourself

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:17.360
while those you have tortured you or troubled you are not at all in any way troubled

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.320
so please, get rid of this myth.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.780
Now raise your right hand on to your forehead across

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.160
and put down your head, as far as possible, resting on the hand.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.700
This is a very important thing to do, so please

01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:46.420
say, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:55.240
Just say from your heart, not how many times but from your heart,

01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:00.060
say it, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:29.780
Now take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible.

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:37.760
Here without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to say

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:45.500
"O Divine power, if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly,

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:53.060
please forgive me." "O divine power, if I have done anything wrong

01:22:53.520 --> 01:23:00.200
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me." Push back your head as far as possible.

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:22.320
Now, stretch your palm fully, push back your fingers,

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.680
put your center of your palm on top of your head

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:37.060
where it is a soft bone called as fontanel bone area - put the center there, push back your fingers.

01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:43.400
Now put down your head, put a good pressure. Here again I cannot

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:51.580
cross over your freedom, which I respect very much, so you have to ask for your Self-realization,

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:58.280
I cannot force it on you. So please put down your head, give a good pressure on the scalp,

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:01.680
move your scalp seven times clockwise

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:08.200
saying seven times, "Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:17.080
