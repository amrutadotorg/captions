00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:13.125
You know, I just said few words about

00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:23.085
sorry for this, but that is for our life itself and

00:05:26.965 --> 00:05:30.245
we are all, I mean,

00:05:30.245 --> 00:05:34.245
I mean, [Unclear], you know.

00:05:37.245 --> 00:05:41.245
It came very late, I don't know why or what happened but

00:05:41.245 --> 00:05:45.245
it was very late. I think we had our lunch and we were resting and

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:49.245
I hope you have rested well. Have you or not?

00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:51.245
Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:05:51.245 --> 00:05:56.245
And we have some public program also because we are coming to a room

00:05:56.245 --> 00:06:01.245
and give you all the dates and all that and you can also join them because

00:06:01.245 --> 00:06:06.245
it's so [unclear] to you and enjoy the music a little bit.

00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:12.245
Now the thing is, tomorrow morning, do you like the place where you are now?

00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:13.245
Yogis: Yes.

00:06:13.245 --> 00:06:18.245
All right, there is also the tents have been pitched now for you and

00:06:18.245 --> 00:06:23.245
the probably people have sent shawls for you here as presents

00:06:23.245 --> 00:06:27.245
which you have to pick them up, they'll be brought here, they'll check for you

00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:31.245
after this program you can take them.

00:06:33.245 --> 00:06:37.245
And the food is nice, [unclear], everything fine?

00:06:37.245 --> 00:06:44.055
So tomorrow morning then we will all have to come to Puja about then o clock. 

00:06:44.245 --> 00:06:51.245
If you could finish the food up at twelve, you could have your lunch and you can also see them

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:58.245
this Sadashtini's temple, I think which is a must for everyone in Sahaja Yogi, God said.

00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:06.245
And then, from there you have to go to Sanghamaya which takes about, they said, you can take

00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:07.245
Two hours.

00:07:07.245 --> 00:07:13.245
Two hours, which is there at seven o'clock, working program is there at seven o'clock, in any case I will teach there

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:19.245
and I hope you will make it also and then you are going to stay in Sanghamaya

00:07:19.245 --> 00:07:27.245
for one night again. One month is not sufficient for all these 12 places I have to go.

00:07:27.245 --> 00:07:33.245
Actually the strength of me also to have [unclear]

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:36.245
Then we will be going to Pune.

00:07:37.245 --> 00:07:45.245
So in Sanghamaya we have nine program and one time I think we are all leaving for Pune, that they will tell our organization.

00:07:45.245 --> 00:07:50.245
But anything is missing or anything you find critical, you should let me know.

00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:52.245
If there is any problem. 

00:07:52.215 --> 00:07:59.015
I know there was somebody who had a [unclear] and he was standing with us. Who is the gentleman?

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:02.215
from [unclear]

00:08:02.245 --> 00:08:03.245
Yes.

00:08:08.245 --> 00:08:10.245
Are you all right now?

00:08:10.245 --> 00:08:17.245
I don't know if you should travel with us because it's dangerous.

00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:22.245
You are coming from what country?

00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:25.483
Yogi: Vancouver, Canada

00:08:27.245 --> 00:08:28.245
Vancouver.

00:08:30.245 --> 00:08:33.245
I don't know. You stayed [unclear] country?

00:08:34.275 --> 00:08:37.245
But she has no epilepsy now?

00:08:37.245 --> 00:08:39.245
Yogi: Seems fine to me.

00:08:39.245 --> 00:08:41.245
So that makes all the

00:08:42.245 --> 00:08:46.245
sometimes the problems are connected with you.

00:08:49.245 --> 00:08:52.245
All right, at least you people should clear him out tomorrow.

00:08:52.245 --> 00:08:57.245
When he's there you all can work it out, clear him out, otherwise you will become sick and auspicious.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:09:03.245
That's why maybe [unclear] problem but his negativity is very wrong on the negativity and

00:09:03.245 --> 00:09:07.245
things work out that way. Nothing wrong with him, he's a Sahaja Yogi in any case.

00:09:07.245 --> 00:09:13.245
He should cleanse him and tomorrow I will cleanse him before we leave because he doesn't know that he's sick.

00:09:13.245 --> 00:09:17.245
That's why he can't go to the hospital. He will cleanse him and then he will be able to do something.

00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:21.245
Otherwise there is no problem to be diagnosed. All right?

00:09:21.245 --> 00:09:23.245
Who will take charge?

00:09:23.245 --> 00:09:24.245
James?

00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:26.245
Yogi: James is between 10th Shri Mataji.

00:09:26.245 --> 00:09:27.245
Shri Mataji: uhh? 

00:09:27.245 --> 00:09:29.245
Yogi: James is within 10th.

00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:30.245
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:37.245
Somebody has to take the charge of that.

00:09:37.245 --> 00:09:40.245
You may not be able to do it.

00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:42.245
Somebody who has

00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:46.245
David can. David?

00:09:46.245 --> 00:09:48.245
Please take it over there. All right?

00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:52.245
See that he's cleared out on the left side and then he comes over.

00:09:52.245 --> 00:09:53.245
Thank you very much.

00:09:53.245 --> 00:10:01.245
Now let's have the music and I hope it will be all right for you sometime and then you can go back and sleep.

00:10:02.245 --> 00:10:05.245
Did you sleep in the daytime?

00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:11.245
I inquired if they have slept around. They said yes, they were all sleeping under the tree.

00:10:14.245 --> 00:10:18.245
It's nice. Sometimes to be like that.
