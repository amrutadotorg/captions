00:00:07.012 --> 00:00:17.498
Today we are here to celebrate the day when
the Sahastrara was opened out.

00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:21.367
Also you have seen in the photograph.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:31.331
It was actually a photograph of my brain, which
showed how the Sahastrara was opened out.

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:36.311
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:40.850
It’s something great these modern times
have done.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.781
So the modern times have brought a lot of
things which can prove the existence of the

00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:48.771
Divine.

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:56.331
Also it can prove about me.

00:00:56.331 --> 00:01:01.931
It can convince you what I am.

00:01:01.931 --> 00:01:13.301
This is very important because, in the modern
times, this advent has to be recognised, has

00:01:13.301 --> 00:01:14.631
to be fully recognised.

00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:21.801
This is one of the conditions for all the
Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:33.612
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara,
then once it opened out, the brahmarandhra

00:01:33.612 --> 00:01:51.372
opened out, then we started feeling the grace,
and it moved onto our Ida and Pingala – the

00:01:51.372 --> 00:01:55.731
grace not the Kundalini.

00:01:55.731 --> 00:02:05.281
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round,
soothed down our Left and Right sides by which

00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:14.511
our chakras opened more, and more threads
of the Kundalini started piercing through.

00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:21.632
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s
important that you must meditate.

00:02:21.632 --> 00:02:28.691
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras
will be alright because, as you know, that

00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:36.452
the peethas, or the controlling centres of
all these chakras, are in the brain around

00:02:36.452 --> 00:02:39.372
the limbic area.

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:49.292
So if your Sahastrara is clear everything
works out in a very different way.

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:56.032
How to keep the Sahastrara alright, is the
big problem [which] always people ask me.

00:02:56.032 --> 00:02:58.582
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

00:02:58.582 --> 00:03:06.152
I have incarnated on the lotus of one thousand
petals.

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:12.231
That’s why I could break it also.

00:03:12.231 --> 00:03:15.792
As I am today, as you see me.

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:20.562
Of course they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya”
(सहस्त्रारे महामाया)

00:03:20.562 --> 00:03:30.681
So this is the illusion which is all the time
there for you, which is very elusive.

00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:38.171
It had to be that way because you could not
have faced me otherwise with all the lights

00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:49.752
coming out of me or the way you saw yesterday
Sahastrara – some sort of abstract colours

00:03:49.752 --> 00:03:52.637
thrown on all sides and the lights thrown
outside.

00:03:52.769 --> 00:04:00.658
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after
by you.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.210
It’s the temple of your Mother.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.970
When you say you put me in the heart, actually
you put me in the Sahastrara.

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.299
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here
(Shri Mataji touches her brahmarandhra) is

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:24.130
the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha,
the centre, which controls the heart, which

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.083
is the seat of the Sadashiva or you can say
of Shiva.

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:35.323
So when you put me in the heart actually you
put me there.

00:04:35.323 --> 00:04:43.042
So to raise it from heart to there, or to
bring it from there to the heart, is the problem

00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:50.433
of two types of people.

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:59.292
Some people who are sensitive in their heart
– I would say in Europe we can say Italians

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:02.994
are very sensitive on their heart – the
first thing they do as soon as they see me

00:05:02.994 --> 00:05:10.763
they put their hands to their heart.

00:05:10.763 --> 00:05:19.523
And that is what it is, that, if you try to
feel me in your heart, to begin with, it’s

00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:21.423
much easier.

00:05:21.423 --> 00:05:24.583
To feel me in your heart.

00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:36.282
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

00:05:36.282 --> 00:05:43.293
You have to love me as I love you.

00:05:43.293 --> 00:05:52.123
You have to love each one of yourselves, because
you are all within me.

00:05:52.123 --> 00:05:57.912
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

00:05:57.912 --> 00:05:59.282
Love is within.

00:05:59.282 --> 00:06:07.563
And love manifests if, just, you open your
heart.

00:06:07.563 --> 00:06:14.232
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

00:06:14.232 --> 00:06:17.423
Firstly, the conditioning.

00:06:17.423 --> 00:06:24.972
In the West to express your love is regarded
as sinful actually.

00:06:24.972 --> 00:06:30.813
It takes them time to say, “I love you,”
but “I hate you!” even a child could go

00:06:30.813 --> 00:06:32.683
on saying, “I hate you!

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:33.803
I hate you!

00:06:33.803 --> 00:06:34.933
I hate you!”

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:36.883
But to hate someone is sinful.

00:06:36.883 --> 00:06:42.092
To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

00:06:42.092 --> 00:06:43.092
So to say that, “I hate you!

00:06:43.092 --> 00:06:51.183
I hate you!” is a sinful act.

00:06:51.183 --> 00:07:02.792
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on
saying, “I love you."

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:11.723
After all, you must love a person who is so
dear to you.

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:21.083
Anyone who has done something good for you,
you love that person.

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:28.363
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you
the rebirth, it should be the easiest thing

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:33.433
to love.

00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:42.683
And if She says that, “They are all within
my body,” so it should be even easier to

00:07:42.683 --> 00:07:45.573
love each other.

00:07:45.573 --> 00:07:58.873
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is
done through this love, this love which is

00:07:58.873 --> 00:08:12.193
not conditioned, which is not inhibited, which
doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want

00:08:12.193 --> 00:08:16.503
any return – nirvaaj.

00:08:16.503 --> 00:08:21.902
But the conditionings are too much.

00:08:21.902 --> 00:08:30.222
First the problem of conditioning comes to
you when you think that, “This condition

00:08:30.222 --> 00:08:41.893
makes me hate someone,” or, “I cannot
love someone because this is the condition!”

00:08:41.893 --> 00:08:52.306
But actually the conditioning itself is so
absurd, if you see it one by one.

00:08:52.413 --> 00:09:01.744
A conditioned mind can love in a limited way
because it is conditioned.

00:09:01.744 --> 00:09:12.303
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within
us, which is like a balloon on top of our head.

00:09:12.304 --> 00:09:16.897
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

00:09:17.084 --> 00:09:21.640
We have norms about everything,
about art about every creation.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.410
We don’t like this carpet.
Why?

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:31.690
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual
understanding of the norms we have reached

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:36.001
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we
don’t like it.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:42.388
Can you even create one inch of that?

00:09:42.815 --> 00:09:46.725
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

00:09:46.725 --> 00:09:51.765
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta (नधिकार
चेष्टा).

00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:52.765
Un-authorised.

00:09:52.765 --> 00:09:57.035
You have no authority to criticise.

00:09:57.035 --> 00:10:04.465
You can’t do anything, so why should you
criticise?

00:10:04.465 --> 00:10:10.385
Better [to] appreciate and see for yourself
that you are not in authority, you are not

00:10:10.385 --> 00:10:14.684
worthy of it, to criticise.

00:10:14.684 --> 00:10:20.505
If you are not worthy of it why should you
criticise anything?

00:10:20.505 --> 00:10:29.924
And, otherwise also, you must know [that]
you are a slave of your ego.

00:10:29.924 --> 00:10:35.845
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence,
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to

00:10:35.845 --> 00:10:37.704
a point, to have some norm.

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:43.574
And then it becomes a collective ego of a
particular community, of a particular country,

00:10:43.574 --> 00:10:45.745
of a particular ideology.

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:47.125
It’s collective.

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:56.574
So then they say, “Oh we think this is no
art!”

00:10:56.574 --> 00:11:04.434
That is the reason we cannot have masters
any more in art.

00:11:04.434 --> 00:11:08.194
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

00:11:08.194 --> 00:11:12.265
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered
a lot.

00:11:12.265 --> 00:11:14.834
You know Gauguin suffered a lot.

00:11:14.834 --> 00:11:16.955
All these artists suffered a lot.

00:11:16.955 --> 00:11:19.694
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

00:11:19.694 --> 00:11:26.285
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily,
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:27.814
So I think people have given up.

00:11:27.814 --> 00:11:32.625
I met an artist who had done lots of art work
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

00:11:32.625 --> 00:11:34.885
He said, “No I don’t want to show you.

00:11:34.885 --> 00:11:35.885
It’s created for myself."

00:11:35.885 --> 00:11:38.475
I said, “I would like to see!”

00:11:38.475 --> 00:11:43.505
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I
said, “Why don’t you show?”

00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:45.985
He said, “No use.
People will just criticise.

00:11:45.985 --> 00:11:48.235
I do it for my own pleasure.

00:11:48.235 --> 00:11:56.944
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

00:11:56.944 --> 00:12:02.665
So one of the basic things we should avoid
is to criticise others.

00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:07.251
Better to criticise yourself.

00:12:07.332 --> 00:12:13.621
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers
and sisters, criticise your country, criticise

00:12:13.702 --> 00:12:21.143
all the habits you have and laugh at yourself,
is the best way.

00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:29.825
If you know how to laugh at yourself then
you will not object or will not stand in the

00:12:29.825 --> 00:12:33.492
way of any creativity of another person.

00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:42.468
But you have to show complete patience and
complete understanding and you must talk like

00:12:42.468 --> 00:12:45.067
a person who loves.

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:57.358
Love has such a power that nobody wants to
do something that will suggest that they don’t

00:12:57.358 --> 00:13:00.978
love; very powerful thing it is.

00:13:00.978 --> 00:13:07.208
It binds people in such a beautiful manner
that one wants to do something: for example

00:13:07.208 --> 00:13:10.027
you want to give me flowers, because you know
I love flowers.

00:13:10.027 --> 00:13:15.168
So you want to give me flower to suggest that,
“Mother we love you,” Just to suggest.

00:13:15.168 --> 00:13:22.777
I know you love me but you just want to, sort
of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

00:13:22.777 --> 00:13:29.448
So you want to give me a flower to show your
love and expression of your inner feeling

00:13:29.448 --> 00:13:33.187
for me.

00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:38.027
So all these material things can be used to
express your love.

00:13:38.027 --> 00:13:45.498
They can be very easily expressed in such
a manner that another person knows what is

00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:46.498
love.

00:13:46.498 --> 00:13:50.988
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

00:13:50.988 --> 00:14:04.858
So, if you see that, this brain has to love;
brain has to love.

00:14:04.858 --> 00:14:13.348
After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga,
through your brain and intelligence, if you

00:14:13.348 --> 00:14:19.927
reach a point where you understand that: No,
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing

00:14:19.927 --> 00:14:21.638
all these things.

00:14:21.638 --> 00:14:23.018
It’s just love.

00:14:23.018 --> 00:14:24.858
It’s simple love.

00:15:46.128 --> 00:15:53.848
We have to open out our Sahastrara again:
through our meditative processes, through

00:15:53.848 --> 00:15:56.658
understanding ourselves and others.

00:15:56.658 --> 00:16:01.658
Maybe logically reaching that point: there’s
no way out now.

00:16:01.658 --> 00:16:04.408
We have reached to the end of it now.

00:16:04.408 --> 00:16:06.328
The whole logic has ended up now.

00:16:06.328 --> 00:16:10.438
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:15.888
Once you jump into the ocean of love there’s
nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every

00:16:15.888 --> 00:16:25.278
wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of
it.

00:16:25.278 --> 00:16:39.049
That is what one has to learn by reasoning
that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.

00:16:39.128 --> 00:16:41.128
May God bless you all.
