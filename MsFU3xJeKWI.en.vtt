00:02.760 --> 00:06.884
Shri Mataji: Have the Americans come, those
who have done the Puja, have they come?

00:07.139 --> 00:09.658
Sahaja yogi: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji:
Are they here? Man: Yes.

00:09.859 --> 00:13.403
Shri Mataji: Oh, they are here.
Then it’s all right.

00:15.551 --> 00:21.781
And, in these new centers,

00:21.982 --> 00:24.916
have you started with Puja anywhere?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.

00:25.117 --> 00:27.963
Shri Mataji: No, yours is all right,
I’m asking about England.

00:28.164 --> 00:29.726
Warren: Any centres in Britain? Where
there are new people.

00:29.927 --> 00:32.744
Shri Mataji: Cheltenham, for example.
Where is Alan? Ask him.

00:32.945 --> 00:35.746
Warren: He’s just gone out for a moment.
Any centers in Britain,

00:35.947 --> 00:39.018
any new people here, right now?

00:39.219 --> 00:42.369
Shri Mataji: If do you have introduced
them to puja I don’t mind,

00:42.570 --> 00:47.876
but if they have never been introduced
to puja, then you have to be careful.

00:49.273 --> 00:52.384
From their good point of view.

00:54.231 --> 00:57.370
I’m sorry I had to say this,

00:57.571 --> 01:00.132
because yesterday the load was too much,
you know I couldn’t speak even,

01:00.333 --> 01:07.625
and lifting the Kundalini was like raising
hundred donkeys on your head,

01:07.826 --> 01:10.522
it was too much.

01:10.752 --> 01:17.694
And all these half-baked people are such
that they are like dog-in-the-manger,

01:17.895 --> 01:20.664
they won’t have it and they won’t allow
others to have it.

01:20.865 --> 01:24.696
They’ll argue before the program,
before the meeting starts,

01:24.897 --> 01:28.635
before the puja starts, specially.

01:28.836 --> 01:32.450
Because they don’t want you to enjoy
the fruits of the puja;

01:32.651 --> 01:35.723
they’ll spoil your attention,

01:37.453 --> 01:41.490
they’ll argue, discuss.
[Aside: “Please sit down.”]

01:46.482 --> 01:49.282
What is there to argue in Sahaj Yoga?
You have to take, that’s the point is,

01:49.483 --> 01:53.007
you have to take, there’s nothing
to argue.

01:53.370 --> 01:56.594
How much you take is the point.

02:01.126 --> 02:09.130
And the worst part is that they don’t want
to grow and they want to pull you down.

02:09.331 --> 02:14.008
So, unless and until they are introduced
to the idea of puja beforehand -

02:14.209 --> 02:16.804
then they start understanding the worth
of puja, otherwise they do not,

02:17.005 --> 02:20.571
how will they understand? You see,
it’s beyond them.

02:22.115 --> 02:29.206
So, you should not make them attend
any puja, minimum,

02:29.407 --> 02:34.105
and also seminars I would say. Because
seminars are meant for people

02:34.306 --> 02:39.829
who are intensively in Sahaj Yoga,
to intensify their awareness.

02:40.030 --> 02:42.574
Not for people who are half-baked,
who are Doubting Thomases,

02:42.775 --> 02:45.347
all this kind of people are absolutely
useless,

02:45.548 --> 02:48.488
you should never bring them
to a seminar.

02:48.689 --> 02:52.021
Whether it’s your son, father, brother,
mother, sister, husband, wife,

02:52.222 --> 02:59.200
nothing doing. You shouldn’t bring
anybody who is not

03:02.094 --> 03:06.982
fully awakened Sahaja Yogi,

03:07.191 --> 03:12.639
because seminars are meant for very
intensive work-out.

03:14.751 --> 03:17.546
And what I find, always these people
will argue with Me,

03:17.747 --> 03:20.729
they are the first to question, they have
something to say

03:20.930 --> 03:24.763
they are the ones. Sahaja Yogis are keeping
quiet and receiving it.

03:24.964 --> 03:30.615
I don’t mind even that, but what happens
in the seminar, you have to receive more.

03:32.594 --> 03:38.009
And they do not receive, their attention
is outside, they are disturbing everyone.

03:38.210 --> 03:43.979
So, seminars are even, in a way, more
important than an ashram,

03:44.180 --> 03:49.493
because in ashram there’s no other problem
but to fight them out.

03:49.694 --> 03:54.694
But here, in a new place we go, we have
to fight out all surroundings,

03:54.895 --> 03:59.064
the place itself has to be cleansed,
everything has to be done.

03:59.265 --> 04:01.928
On top of that you have these horrible
people around you,

04:02.129 --> 04:04.559
whom you have to convince. If they are
not convinced, why are they here?

04:04.760 --> 04:07.651
Why did they spend so much money
to come down?

04:07.852 --> 04:13.526
Be sure, they have come here to disturb us.
I’m sorry we had to do that way.

04:13.727 --> 04:18.330
I wish people could be simple,
straightforward,

04:18.531 --> 04:25.809
uncomplicated, and sensitive, but
they are not.

04:27.480 --> 04:32.641
They are not sensitive people. They don’t
understand what are they up to.

04:32.951 --> 04:37.079
By that they destroy themselves, no doubt,
but they destroy part of you also,

04:37.279 --> 04:41.158
and also trouble Me. Yesterday it was
too heavy, you know that.

04:41.360 --> 04:44.858
Such a deep subject and it was too heavy
for Me.

04:45.058 --> 04:49.921
If they say they feel bad, all right, tell
them: “We are sorry, we can’t help you.”

04:52.934 --> 05:02.026
See, there are certain points where we have
to have our freedom

05:02.923 --> 05:10.236
to allow those who can come in. That’s
the point where we close the door.

05:11.606 --> 05:19.961
And there’s nothing wrong in it, because
you have to equip more to pull them out.

05:22.055 --> 05:26.123
It has been always our practice, since
long, there’s nothing new about it,

05:26.324 --> 05:31.576
everyone knows, not only in England,
or any other place, even in India:

05:31.782 --> 05:37.263
we never allowed anybody to come for
the Puja who was not a realized soul,

05:38.734 --> 05:41.370
and who was not a Sahaja Yogi, from
the very beginning.

05:41.571 --> 05:46.067
Wherever we tried that, we found it was
very difficult.

05:47.564 --> 05:50.032
So I hope there’s nobody sitting here
with a doubting mind.

05:50.233 --> 05:55.749
If somebody’s there he should with all
sincerity leave the hall

05:55.950 --> 05:59.875
and leave us alone, for the ascent.

06:02.251 --> 06:10.195
Anybody who has doubts should be kind
and generous about it.

06:10.977 --> 06:15.612
It’s a very serious work we are doing.
It’s not of making money

06:15.813 --> 06:21.066
or of throwing an enterprise or building
a house or something like that.

06:21.267 --> 06:26.875
It’s not even just making creations
of worlds,

06:27.076 --> 06:31.343
it’s much more than that, it’s a very
serious work we are doing

06:31.500 --> 06:36.851
and we don’t want anybody to cut
our attention.

06:37.483 --> 06:40.593
Even some of the Sahaja Yogis I know,
are half-baked.

06:40.794 --> 06:43.817
They must be corrected, all right, doesn’t
matter, but they have been exposed to pujas,

06:44.018 --> 06:46.352
so it will do them good, not bad.

06:46.553 --> 06:52.151
But some people are just anti-God, and they
have allergies for God.

06:52.352 --> 06:58.781
Any work you’d start doing in the name
of God, they are so allergic, they react.

07:01.381 --> 07:06.884
These are anti-God allergies,

07:07.968 --> 07:10.983
and they express themselves by different,
funny methods.

07:11.184 --> 07:18.122
Now, all the Sahaja Yogis must know this,
then you will not go too far with them.

07:18.323 --> 07:22.263
You will - you should discover this
in anyone this allergy existing.

07:22.443 --> 07:26.316
You should say: “Sorry, we have nothing
to do with you”.

07:33.404 --> 07:40.377
So that is for the people who have to have
the privilege of this worship.

07:40.578 --> 07:44.350
Today is specially a great privilege

07:45.893 --> 07:50.864
because it was not so planned,

07:51.065 --> 07:57.690
but it worked out, just worked out.

07:59.773 --> 08:07.097
Yesterday we did lots of cleansing. Now,
today tell your mind to rest for a while.

08:08.538 --> 08:14.436
Tell your thoughts to stop for a while,
and receive, receive more of it.

08:14.637 --> 08:19.874
Everybody has benefited by this reception
but you have to receive more.

08:20.075 --> 08:23.726
There’s a capacity within you to receive.

08:29.177 --> 08:35.730
Puja, as I have told you many-a-times,
is not for My benefit, by any chance,

08:35.931 --> 08:40.641
take it from Me. I’m much better off
without it.

08:40.856 --> 08:45.394
Because when the enthusiastic deities start
emitting vibrations

08:45.595 --> 08:51.272
with your asking - because you are saints,
you see, just they are over-enthusiastic.

08:51.473 --> 08:54.836
And they are sitting there, busy-bodies,
you know,

08:55.037 --> 08:58.481
they are sitting quietly waiting for
a chance, you see, to emit vibrations,

08:58.682 --> 09:02.783
to save you, you see they want to just
rush.

09:03.117 --> 09:08.278
They emit so much that they lose –
“Just wait, just wait”.

09:08.479 --> 09:14.606
They want to save you, they want to give
you, they’re so anxious,

09:14.932 --> 09:20.915
in their anxiety you see - I like it,
to see the way they are anxious.

09:22.053 --> 09:26.713
But you don’t suck it, and I have a problem
there.

09:27.769 --> 09:30.914
Once they have given they don’t want
to take it back.

09:31.115 --> 09:35.533
You don’t suck it, so it has to go to the
atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere.

09:35.734 --> 09:38.989
Is directed towards you and you don’t take
it; so where does it go?

09:39.190 --> 09:44.280
It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.

09:44.534 --> 09:48.546
So, sucking should be more. Sucking
should be more.

09:48.747 --> 09:53.501
And just before the Puja you should say:
“Mother, make me such

09:53.702 --> 09:58.363
that I suck more of the Divine”.

09:58.564 --> 10:04.658
Just pray that, with sincerity from your
heart, just say that.

10:14.939 --> 10:18.865
There’s another beautiful gesture I have
seen, in Uzbekistan, it’s very good.

10:19.066 --> 10:23.669
They put both the hands on their heart
like this, and just press it,

10:23.857 --> 10:28.922
bending their head, asking. See, it creates
a vacuum.

10:29.123 --> 10:32.005
That’s how they bow.

10:39.359 --> 10:41.737
It’s beautiful!

10:53.183 --> 10:55.627
That’s very nice today.
