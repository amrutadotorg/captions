00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.884
Shri Mataji: Have the Americans come, those
who have done the Puja, have they come?

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:09.658
Sahaja yogi: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji:
Are they here? Man: Yes.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.403
Shri Mataji: Oh, they are here.
Then it’s all right.

00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:21.781
And, in these new centers,

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:24.916
have you started with Puja anywhere?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.

00:00:25.117 --> 00:00:27.963
Shri Mataji: No, yours is all right,
I’m asking about England.

00:00:28.164 --> 00:00:29.726
Warren: Any centres in Britain? Where
there are new people.

00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:32.744
Shri Mataji: Cheltenham, for example.
Where is Alan? Ask him.

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:35.746
Warren: He’s just gone out for a moment.
Any centers in Britain,

00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:39.018
any new people here, right now?

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.369
Shri Mataji: If do you have introduced
them to puja I don’t mind,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.876
but if they have never been introduced
to puja, then you have to be careful.

00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:52.384
From their good point of view.

00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:57.370
I’m sorry I had to say this,

00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.132
because yesterday the load was too much,
you know I couldn’t speak even,

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:07.625
and lifting the Kundalini was like raising
hundred donkeys on your head,

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:10.522
it was too much.

00:01:10.752 --> 00:01:17.694
And all these half-baked people are such
that they are like dog-in-the-manger,

00:01:17.895 --> 00:01:20.664
they won’t have it and they won’t allow
others to have it.

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:24.696
They’ll argue before the program,
before the meeting starts,

00:01:24.897 --> 00:01:28.635
before the puja starts, specially.

00:01:28.836 --> 00:01:32.450
Because they don’t want you to enjoy
the fruits of the puja;

00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:35.723
they’ll spoil your attention,

00:01:37.453 --> 00:01:41.490
they’ll argue, discuss.
[Aside: “Please sit down.”]

00:01:46.482 --> 00:01:49.282
What is there to argue in Sahaj Yoga?
You have to take, that’s the point is,

00:01:49.483 --> 00:01:53.007
you have to take, there’s nothing
to argue.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.594
How much you take is the point.

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:09.130
And the worst part is that they don’t want
to grow and they want to pull you down.

00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:14.008
So, unless and until they are introduced
to the idea of puja beforehand -

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.804
then they start understanding the worth
of puja, otherwise they do not,

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:20.571
how will they understand? You see,
it’s beyond them.

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:29.206
So, you should not make them attend
any puja, minimum,

00:02:29.407 --> 00:02:34.105
and also seminars I would say. Because
seminars are meant for people

00:02:34.306 --> 00:02:39.829
who are intensively in Sahaj Yoga,
to intensify their awareness.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.574
Not for people who are half-baked,
who are Doubting Thomases,

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:45.347
all this kind of people are absolutely
useless,

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:48.488
you should never bring them
to a seminar.

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.021
Whether it’s your son, father, brother,
mother, sister, husband, wife,

00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:59.200
nothing doing. You shouldn’t bring
anybody who is not

00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:06.982
fully awakened Sahaja Yogi,

00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:12.639
because seminars are meant for very
intensive work-out.

00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:17.546
And what I find, always these people
will argue with Me,

00:03:17.747 --> 00:03:20.729
they are the first to question, they have
something to say

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.763
they are the ones. Sahaja Yogis are keeping
quiet and receiving it.

00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:30.615
I don’t mind even that, but what happens
in the seminar, you have to receive more.

00:03:32.594 --> 00:03:38.009
And they do not receive, their attention
is outside, they are disturbing everyone.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.979
So, seminars are even, in a way, more
important than an ashram,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.493
because in ashram there’s no other problem
but to fight them out.

00:03:49.694 --> 00:03:54.694
But here, in a new place we go, we have
to fight out all surroundings,

00:03:54.895 --> 00:03:59.064
the place itself has to be cleansed,
everything has to be done.

00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:01.928
On top of that you have these horrible
people around you,

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.559
whom you have to convince. If they are
not convinced, why are they here?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.651
Why did they spend so much money
to come down?

00:04:07.852 --> 00:04:13.526
Be sure, they have come here to disturb us.
I’m sorry we had to do that way.

00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:18.330
I wish people could be simple,
straightforward,

00:04:18.531 --> 00:04:25.809
uncomplicated, and sensitive, but
they are not.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.641
They are not sensitive people. They don’t
understand what are they up to.

00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:37.079
By that they destroy themselves, no doubt,
but they destroy part of you also,

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.158
and also trouble Me. Yesterday it was
too heavy, you know that.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.858
Such a deep subject and it was too heavy
for Me.

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:49.921
If they say they feel bad, all right, tell
them: “We are sorry, we can’t help you.”

00:04:52.934 --> 00:05:02.026
See, there are certain points where we have
to have our freedom

00:05:02.923 --> 00:05:10.236
to allow those who can come in. That’s
the point where we close the door.

00:05:11.606 --> 00:05:19.961
And there’s nothing wrong in it, because
you have to equip more to pull them out.

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:26.123
It has been always our practice, since
long, there’s nothing new about it,

00:05:26.324 --> 00:05:31.576
everyone knows, not only in England,
or any other place, even in India:

00:05:31.782 --> 00:05:37.263
we never allowed anybody to come for
the Puja who was not a realized soul,

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:41.370
and who was not a Sahaja Yogi, from
the very beginning.

00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:46.067
Wherever we tried that, we found it was
very difficult.

00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:50.032
So I hope there’s nobody sitting here
with a doubting mind.

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:55.749
If somebody’s there he should with all
sincerity leave the hall

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.875
and leave us alone, for the ascent.

00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:10.195
Anybody who has doubts should be kind
and generous about it.

00:06:10.977 --> 00:06:15.612
It’s a very serious work we are doing.
It’s not of making money

00:06:15.813 --> 00:06:21.066
or of throwing an enterprise or building
a house or something like that.

00:06:21.267 --> 00:06:26.875
It’s not even just making creations
of worlds,

00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:31.343
it’s much more than that, it’s a very
serious work we are doing

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.851
and we don’t want anybody to cut
our attention.

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:40.593
Even some of the Sahaja Yogis I know,
are half-baked.

00:06:40.794 --> 00:06:43.817
They must be corrected, all right, doesn’t
matter, but they have been exposed to pujas,

00:06:44.018 --> 00:06:46.352
so it will do them good, not bad.

00:06:46.553 --> 00:06:52.151
But some people are just anti-God, and they
have allergies for God.

00:06:52.352 --> 00:06:58.781
Any work you’d start doing in the name
of God, they are so allergic, they react.

00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:06.884
These are anti-God allergies,

00:07:07.968 --> 00:07:10.983
and they express themselves by different,
funny methods.

00:07:11.184 --> 00:07:18.122
Now, all the Sahaja Yogis must know this,
then you will not go too far with them.

00:07:18.323 --> 00:07:22.263
You will - you should discover this
in anyone this allergy existing.

00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:26.316
You should say: “Sorry, we have nothing
to do with you”.

00:07:33.404 --> 00:07:40.377
So that is for the people who have to have
the privilege of this worship.

00:07:40.578 --> 00:07:44.350
Today is specially a great privilege

00:07:45.893 --> 00:07:50.864
because it was not so planned,

00:07:51.065 --> 00:07:57.690
but it worked out, just worked out.

00:07:59.773 --> 00:08:07.097
Yesterday we did lots of cleansing. Now,
today tell your mind to rest for a while.

00:08:08.538 --> 00:08:14.436
Tell your thoughts to stop for a while,
and receive, receive more of it.

00:08:14.637 --> 00:08:19.874
Everybody has benefited by this reception
but you have to receive more.

00:08:20.075 --> 00:08:23.726
There’s a capacity within you to receive.

00:08:29.177 --> 00:08:35.730
Puja, as I have told you many-a-times,
is not for My benefit, by any chance,

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:40.641
take it from Me. I’m much better off
without it.

00:08:40.856 --> 00:08:45.394
Because when the enthusiastic deities start
emitting vibrations

00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:51.272
with your asking - because you are saints,
you see, just they are over-enthusiastic.

00:08:51.473 --> 00:08:54.836
And they are sitting there, busy-bodies,
you know,

00:08:55.037 --> 00:08:58.481
they are sitting quietly waiting for
a chance, you see, to emit vibrations,

00:08:58.682 --> 00:09:02.783
to save you, you see they want to just
rush.

00:09:03.117 --> 00:09:08.278
They emit so much that they lose –
“Just wait, just wait”.

00:09:08.479 --> 00:09:14.606
They want to save you, they want to give
you, they’re so anxious,

00:09:14.932 --> 00:09:20.915
in their anxiety you see - I like it,
to see the way they are anxious.

00:09:22.053 --> 00:09:26.713
But you don’t suck it, and I have a problem
there.

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:30.914
Once they have given they don’t want
to take it back.

00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:35.533
You don’t suck it, so it has to go to the
atmosphere, it has to disappear somewhere.

00:09:35.734 --> 00:09:38.989
Is directed towards you and you don’t take
it; so where does it go?

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:44.280
It hangs into My tissues, it pains Me.

00:09:44.534 --> 00:09:48.546
So, sucking should be more. Sucking
should be more.

00:09:48.747 --> 00:09:53.501
And just before the Puja you should say:
“Mother, make me such

00:09:53.702 --> 00:09:58.363
that I suck more of the Divine”.

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:04.658
Just pray that, with sincerity from your
heart, just say that.

00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:18.865
There’s another beautiful gesture I have
seen, in Uzbekistan, it’s very good.

00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:23.669
They put both the hands on their heart
like this, and just press it,

00:10:23.857 --> 00:10:28.922
bending their head, asking. See, it creates
a vacuum.

00:10:29.123 --> 00:10:32.005
That’s how they bow.

00:10:39.359 --> 00:10:41.737
It’s beautiful!

00:10:53.183 --> 00:10:55.627
That’s very nice today.
