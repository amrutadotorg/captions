GUIDED MEDITATION
1979-1118 London (UK)

2
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:22,051
Now first before meditating,
in your heart,

3
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:28,749
or, you should see in your heart,

4
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:42,059
and there try to put your Guru
in the core of it.

5
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,390
After establishing in the heart,

6
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:54,676
you must bow to that

7
00:00:58,461 --> 00:01:02,609
with full devotion and dedication.

8
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,417
Now, whatever you do with your mind,
after Realisation,

9
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:13,676
is not imagination because now
your mind,

10
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:19,098
your imagination, is itself
enlightened.

11
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:27,929
So project yourself in such a way
that you humble down

12
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,557
at the feet of your Guru

13
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:51,453
and now ask for the necessary
temperament

14
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:59,906
needed for meditation, or atmosphere
needed for meditation.

15
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:08,278
Meditation is when you are one 
with the Divine.

16
00:02:10,507 --> 00:02:14,546
Now if there are thoughts
coming in,

17
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,997
first you have to say the first mantra,
of course,

18
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:22,667
and then watch inside.

19
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:30,545
Also you must say mantra of Ganesha,
will help some people.

20
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:34,704
And then you should watch
inside

21
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,692
and see for yourself which is
the biggest hurdle.

22
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:49,974
First the thought.

23
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,505
Now, for the thought, you have to say
the mantra of Nirvichara,

24
00:02:58,706 --> 00:03:05,498
“Twameva sakshat
Nirvichar sakshat

25
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:10,568
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.”
Should say it thrice.

26
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:15,865
Yogis: OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI NIRVICHARA SAKSHAT

27
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:22,443
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

28
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:28,460
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI NIRVICHARA SAKSHAT

29
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:35,139
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

30
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:41,259
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI NIRVICHARA SAKSHAT

31
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:48,282
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

32
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:50,701
Shri Mataji: Now we come to the hurdle
of your ego

33
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:53,703
because, you see, the thought has stopped
now, no doubt,

34
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:56,545
but there’s still a pressure
on the head.

35
00:03:56,746 --> 00:04:00,798
So, if it is ego, you have to say,

36
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,721
“Twameva sakshat Mahat-
Ahamkara…” -

37
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:08,386
Mahat means ‘the great’, Ahamkara
means ‘the ego’ –

38
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:17,111
“…sakshat Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.” Say it thrice.

39
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:23,551
Yogis: OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI MAHAT-AHAMKARA SAKSHAT

40
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:31,936
SHRI ADI SHAKTI SAKSHAT
SHRI NIRMALA DEVI NAMOH NAMAHA

41
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:38,330
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI MAHAT-AHAMKARA SAKSHAT

42
00:04:38,546 --> 00:04:46,029
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA. Shri Mataji: Again.

43
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:52,299
Yogis: OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI MAHAT-AHAMKARA SAKSHAT

44
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:58,197
SHRI MATAJI SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

45
00:04:58,408 --> 00:05:03,353
Shri Mataji: Now, even now, if you find
that ego is still there,

46
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:08,922
then you have to raise your left side
to push it back

47
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:15,511
to the right hand side, with your hand;
one hand towards the photograph.

48
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:22,318
Push the left side higher and right
side lower

49
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,975
so the ego and super-ego
get the balance.

50
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:37,709
Do it seven times.

51
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,364
Try to feel it, how you are feeling 
nside, you see.

52
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:03,753
Now you raise your Kundalini up
on the head and tie it up.

53
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:13,585
Again raise your Kundalini up
on the head and tie it up.

54
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,066
Again raise your Kundalini
and tie it up.

55
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:25,631
Hmm.

56
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:36,010
Now at the Sahastrara you should say
the mantra of Sahastrara, thrice.

57
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:42,207
Yogis: OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI KALKI SAKSHAT

58
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:47,990
SHRI SAHASTRARA SWAMINI
MOKSHA PRADAYINI MATAJI

59
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,359
SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

60
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,580
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI KALKI SAKSHAT

61
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:05,573
SHRI SAHASTRARA SWAMINI
MOKSHA PRADAYINI MATAJI

62
00:07:05,774 --> 00:07:11,199
SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

63
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,663
OM TWAMEVA SAKSHAT
SHRI KALKI SAKSHAT

64
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:23,616
SHRI SAHASTRARA SWAMINI
MOKSHA PRADAYINI MATAJI

65
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:30,314
SHRI NIRMALA DEVI
NAMOH NAMAHA

66
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:33,327
Shri Mataji: Now it’s opened out
if you see.

67
00:07:33,528 --> 00:07:36,703
Now you can open again your
Sahastrara like this.

68
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:40,520
Just take it down again and see
that you are stationed there.

69
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,945
Once this has been done then
you go into meditation.

70
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:50,360
This is like cleansing, you see,
called as nyasa.

71
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:54,592
Now.

72
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,999
Now, if you find any other obstruction,
you can also say,

73
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,511
like, if you have got, say,
Mahakali’s problem,

74
00:08:13,712 --> 00:08:21,413
you can say that mantra, clear it
and then you sit down for meditation.

75
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:33,020
Any individual thing, you can
take it out.

76
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,138
Like, if you have the ego problem,
if you think,

77
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:37,525
then you should start with
Mahat-Ahamkara.

78
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,119
It is what you have to find out:
What is your problem?

79
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,736
Where is the Kundalini stopping?
You can feel it within yourself.

80
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,124
Some of you may not feel.

81
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:17,819
If you do not feel it, feel it
on your fingers.

82
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:24,345
If you are not feeling within yourself then
feel it on your fingers, you can feel it.

83
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,565
Ah, Better.

84
00:09:30,827 --> 00:09:35,624
(Missing audio: “Reduce your
breathing, will be better.

85
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:40,819
Reduce your breathing as if stopping,
but no exertion about it.”)

86
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:48,252
How is it now? Better? Where is
the problem?

87
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:55,411
Hmm?
Yogi: Central heart.

88
00:09:55,612 --> 00:10:01,639
Shri Mataji: Central heart? Alright,
hold your breath.

89
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:05,833
Not with great force, just
ordinarily. Alright?

90
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:19,164
AHAM SAKSHAT JAGADAMBA
(x 10)

91
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:24,963
Alright? Leave it.

92
00:10:31,788 --> 00:10:38,607
Better now? Once again? Alright,
hold your breath.

93
00:10:38,808 --> 00:10:46,878
AHAM SAKSHAT JAGADAMBA
(x 7)

94
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:50,529
Haa. Leave it.

95
00:10:55,782 --> 00:11:01,629
Better. Keep your eyes open.
Again. Hold it.

96
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:13,558
AHAM SAKSHAT JAGADAMBA
(x 9)

97
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:20,909
Leave it. Better now?

98
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:28,051
Much relief. Alright?

99
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:32,594
I mean, now left side.

100
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:37,468
Put your left hand towards Me,
right hand up there.

101
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:41,411
Left hand towards Me,
right hand like that…

102
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:47,912
Hmm.

103
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,162
Hmm.

104
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:10,737
Like this. Douglas (Fry),
like this.

105
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:19,276
Better? See, liver.

106
00:12:22,127 --> 00:12:28,873
Over-thinking gives you
liver also. Better?

107
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:38,119
Much better.

108
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:42,737
It’s coming down.

109
00:13:02,099 --> 00:13:07,000
Hmm. Better now?

110
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:10,435
What is it?

111
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:15,333
Where do you feel? Vishuddhi?
