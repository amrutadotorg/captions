WEBVTT

00:02.905 --> 00:09.108
We have had Bhairava Puja in Belgium

00:09.309 --> 00:15.236
and now I thought today let us have Mahakali Puja

00:15.436 --> 00:22.379
because yesterday's experience, last night's experience,

00:22.580 --> 00:26.564
was the work of Mahakali.

00:26.765 --> 00:34.448
She has a double role all the time, she's at two extremes.

00:34.648 --> 00:45.301
On one side she is full of joy, giver of joy,

00:46.536 --> 00:51.670
she's very happy when she sees her disciple are joyous.

00:51.871 --> 00:55.355
Joy is her own quality, is her energy,

00:55.556 --> 00:59.061
and yesterday you must have been amazed to see

00:59.262 --> 01:06.709
so many middle-aged ladies of France smiling and laughing.

01:06.909 --> 01:09.080
I'd never seen them smiling;

01:11.229 --> 01:14.411
it's very surprising how they were so joyous

01:14.612 --> 01:20.072
and so very happy and this is the energy of Mahakali

01:20.273 --> 01:24.056
that gives you all that joy after Realization

01:24.257 --> 01:27.244
and the joy you enjoy among yourselves,

01:27.445 --> 01:31.127
all these are the qualities of Mahakali

01:31.328 --> 01:35.518
and when they will read out the names of Mahakali

01:35.719 --> 01:45.479
you will know how her powers manifest in Sahaja Yoga

01:45.680 --> 01:48.307
and how it has helped you all

01:48.508 --> 01:52.305
to get drenched into the Ocean of Joy.

01:56.947 --> 02:08.410
To begin with I have to tell you one thing that

02:08.611 --> 02:11.832
Mahakali Puja, when you are doing,

02:12.033 --> 02:16.892
you have to feel a joy within yourself,

02:18.510 --> 02:22.471
and joy from other Sahaja Yogis.

02:22.672 --> 02:27.672
If you, if you cannot feel that, that means you are not yet grown

02:29.109 --> 02:33.415
and there's some problem, maybe with your parents,

02:33.616 --> 02:36.157
maybe with your children, maybe it's family, with your country,

02:36.358 --> 02:39.588
whatever it is but there's some sort of a conditioning

02:39.789 --> 02:43.322
which is working out that doesn't give you that joy.

02:47.069 --> 02:53.888
And to grow into Sahaja Yoga is very important,

02:54.089 --> 02:55.909
which I think people don't understand,

02:56.110 --> 03:00.497
even if they live in ashrams, they don't understand one thing,

03:00.698 --> 03:03.331
that you have to be collective.

03:04.604 --> 03:09.973
If you are not collective then you are thrown out, gradually.

03:11.052 --> 03:18.079
Now this Mahakali power has got seven strings you can say this,

03:19.970 --> 03:22.337
and these strings are there to throw you out

03:22.538 --> 03:25.376
into collective subconscious (next couple of words inaudible).

03:26.793 --> 03:29.655
Like as in the sitar you have seen for the resonance,

03:29.856 --> 03:32.214
there are other strings also.

03:33.895 --> 03:36.548
So once you start getting out of the collectivity

03:36.749 --> 03:44.415
it is the Mahakali Herself, picks you out and starts throwing you out,

03:44.616 --> 03:48.424
slowly slowly to the subconscious area

03:48.625 --> 03:52.101
and where you just disappear.

03:53.039 --> 03:56.085
And all kinds of problems start,

03:57.508 --> 04:00.717
I have seen this happening in every country,

04:00.918 --> 04:06.349
that people who do not attend the collective meditation.

04:06.550 --> 04:10.628
For France I have the same report

04:11.206 --> 04:17.909
and I think the people who do not grow will be thrown out.

04:19.745 --> 04:23.515
Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has a double action,

04:23.716 --> 04:26.543
as the Mahakali has a double action.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.145
She's extremely loving, full of joy,

04:29.346 --> 04:33.989
full of happiness and She's the one who's extremely cruel, wrathful,

04:34.190 --> 04:38.098
She's the one who's the slayer of all the demons and the evil,

04:38.299 --> 04:42.755
and those people who try to do evil.

04:42.956 --> 04:45.855
So once you are thrown out into the left side

04:46.074 --> 04:48.246
then you can imagine, you can develop any kind

04:48.447 --> 04:50.364
of left-side diseases to begin with,

04:50.565 --> 04:53.151
Mooladhara diseases are the worst,

04:53.352 --> 04:58.228
you develop diseases like mellitus, this, er, er,

04:58.429 --> 05:01.442
you must have heard of the disabilities caused

05:01.643 --> 05:05.056
by the muscles getting degenerated.

05:05.257 --> 05:09.257
All muscular degeneration comes from this problem.

05:11.648 --> 05:14.398
So at any cost that must be avoided.

05:17.344 --> 05:21.440
But if you are not in the collective, if you do not understand the collective,

05:21.641 --> 05:24.770
and if you are out of the collective

05:24.986 --> 05:29.423
you'll be surprised that negative forces will join together

05:29.624 --> 05:32.373
and they'll pull you out.

05:32.573 --> 05:35.933
So this is one of the things that happens,

05:37.379 --> 05:43.774
so be very careful that don't avoid the collective programmes.

05:46.986 --> 05:52.338
The, another problem about Mahakali is that,

05:52.539 --> 05:56.267
that She's the one who gives you the feeling

05:56.468 --> 06:01.699
for your wife, for your husband,

06:01.900 --> 06:05.496
She is the one.

06:06.929 --> 06:11.405
Now there also, the same problem.

06:11.606 --> 06:19.295
If both of them are alright, She's alright

06:19.496 --> 06:24.154
but if She finds any one of them going astray

06:24.355 --> 06:27.527
She'll throw that person out and out and out

06:27.727 --> 06:29.939
and the, another person, if that person is attached

06:30.140 --> 06:34.986
to that person also will be thrown out. So this business of falling in love,

06:35.187 --> 06:37.736
this nonsense that we have here, that you fall in love,

06:37.937 --> 06:40.993
but the word is all right because you fall really in love.

06:41.194 --> 06:43.334
It's a real falling happens.

06:44.686 --> 06:47.445
So what happens when you start falling in love,

06:47.646 --> 06:50.758
there's a kind of a maya of this Mahakali

06:50.959 --> 06:54.279
and you just get infatuated, your ego gets pampered,

06:54.480 --> 06:57.779
or something like that, or you have certain ideas of a wife

06:57.980 --> 07:01.581
or something and then you think 'Oh, that's the one for me.'

07:03.308 --> 07:06.663
So in these cases only two things can happen;

07:06.864 --> 07:09.812
either you can be lost completely because of

07:10.013 --> 07:14.079
your wife or your husband whom you adore and admire

07:14.280 --> 07:17.669
and you, you've finished, I mean your personality is finished.

07:17.943 --> 07:23.573
Or else, the another thing which is even more serious is that,

07:23.774 --> 07:26.774
that you'll completely break forever and hate each other.

07:26.876 --> 07:31.076
That's why they say that there's a love and hate relationship.

07:31.277 --> 07:33.878
How can love be hate?

07:35.058 --> 07:40.849
But it becomes, because of the, this quality of the Goddess

07:41.050 --> 07:44.747
that She is on one side extremely loving,

07:44.948 --> 07:48.916
extremely kind, extremely soft,

07:49.116 --> 07:51.585
she goes up to a point.

07:52.460 --> 07:55.290
And then She throws you on the other side,

07:55.491 --> 07:59.774
and that is why in these countries where people always fall in love, you see,

07:59.975 --> 08:04.747
they don't marry otherwise, unless and until they have fallen in love.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.900
In that they cross all the maryadas also.

08:08.837 --> 08:11.105
In falling in love they will marry somebody

08:11.306 --> 08:15.488
who is already married or who is, they'll carry on with somebody

08:15.689 --> 08:20.141
who is not yet divorced

08:20.342 --> 08:25.098
or also they will have marriages, er, among themselves

08:25.298 --> 08:27.908
in the same household or something.

08:28.109 --> 08:30.007
All kinds of things they do and the old woman

08:30.208 --> 08:33.543
marries a young man or a young, er,

08:33.754 --> 08:35.645
old man marries a young girl, like that,

08:35.864 --> 08:38.821
all nonsensical things, without any maryadas.

08:39.022 --> 08:42.274
And they do not stick together, they have no maryadas.

08:42.634 --> 08:48.657
To marry is to create a maryada, maryada of your behaviour

08:48.858 --> 08:51.442
and this is the maryada which, if you do not keep,

08:51.701 --> 08:55.718
er, keep, then this Mahakali gets into it.

08:55.919 --> 08:59.226
So first of all one has to be collective,

08:59.474 --> 09:00.763
the ones who are not collective,

09:00.982 --> 09:04.593
who do not attend every time a collective programme.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.312
You might give suggestions,

09:06.513 --> 09:09.020
that you would like to come for such and such thing.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.854
For example, I have already explained,

09:12.055 --> 09:14.822
that you shouldn't talk, put my,

09:15.023 --> 09:18.080
there are so many tapes which they have not, never heard.

09:18.281 --> 09:21.510
List...let them listen to my tape then go into meditation

09:21.711 --> 09:24.236
and then do the aarti and finish it off.

09:24.437 --> 09:27.454
Because these tapes are to be heard again and again.

09:27.655 --> 09:32.180
Now those who get any questions out of those tapes

09:32.381 --> 09:36.344
can, next time, discuss it before starting the tapes.

09:36.545 --> 09:41.014
That's a very good thing and that works. In India nobody speaks,

09:41.215 --> 09:45.037
they just put my tapes on or show my video,

09:45.238 --> 09:51.258
after that they just have meditation and aarti. Finished.

09:51.459 --> 09:54.493
After that nobody talks. But before starting it,

09:54.694 --> 09:59.688
they do it is to talk to each other and discuss the problems

09:59.889 --> 10:06.583
or discuss anything that they felt about the previous programme.

10:06.784 --> 10:09.317
Because you have not come here to marry someone

10:09.518 --> 10:12.143
or to fall in love into something.

10:13.541 --> 10:15.880
You have not come here to get after some woman

10:16.081 --> 10:19.660
because she's your wife or some man because he's your husband.

10:19.861 --> 10:23.861
You have had so many husbands and wives in previous lives.

10:24.986 --> 10:28.009
But you have come here for your ascent;

10:30.658 --> 10:32.249
and if you have come here for your ascent

10:32.450 --> 10:36.244
you have to keep a watch. How is your mind working?

10:37.236 --> 10:39.933
Supposing I say that you should have good married life,

10:40.134 --> 10:43.895
of course, I do say, you should have good married life.

10:44.096 --> 10:47.549
But not at the cost of losing your ascent.

10:49.656 --> 10:54.869
It has happened with people, we have lost a complete,

10:55.070 --> 10:57.455
I should say, a city like that.

10:57.656 --> 11:00.804
Such stupidity came, comes up over people.

11:02.153 --> 11:04.655
So be careful not to get lost,

11:04.856 --> 11:08.600
you have not come here to have only a happy married life

11:08.801 --> 11:12.756
but happy married life is just one step.

11:12.957 --> 11:15.483
But if that step is taking you away

11:15.684 --> 11:20.371
from the real path of your ascent is better to be careful.

11:24.668 --> 11:29.514
Also we must understand the innocence means purity,

11:29.715 --> 11:31.969
purity of thought. As I explained yesterday

11:32.170 --> 11:35.165
I hope you understood the meaning of purity.

11:35.366 --> 11:40.224
Purity is to be understood much more by Europeans.

11:40.425 --> 11:45.425
Very important. Specially French.

11:48.182 --> 11:50.986
Because the whole society is suffering.

11:52.113 --> 11:58.404
Society can only be pure if the family life is pure.

11:58.605 --> 12:04.521
Not only that but your relations with each other are pure.

12:04.722 --> 12:08.722
Like I was told that somebody fell in love in Ganapatipule.

12:08.933 --> 12:11.432
I mean you go for a pilgrimage.

12:12.378 --> 12:15.456
It's like you have to go to buy a sari and you

12:15.657 --> 12:20.258
end up with a shaving stick.

12:20.459 --> 12:22.094
It's that stupid.

12:22.295 --> 12:27.511
You are coming to Ganapatipule for a, for what?

12:28.175 --> 12:39.579
You are coming there for your ascent, it's a pilgrimage.

12:39.780 --> 12:41.873
But in the pilgrimage I've never heard anybody

12:42.086 --> 12:46.681
falls in love with each other and goes to marriage.

12:46.882 --> 12:51.298
So this bhoot of falling in love must be given up in Sahaja Yoga,

12:51.499 --> 12:53.284
that is one of the biggest loads.

12:53.485 --> 12:57.797
And, and must understand that purity means chastity.

13:01.562 --> 13:04.720
Innocence means chastity,

13:04.921 --> 13:08.351
not only physical also mental chastity.

13:10.835 --> 13:13.433
You have to have mental chastity,

13:13.634 --> 13:18.548
if you don't have mental chastity you cannot ascend.

13:19.369 --> 13:26.588
Actually in the West it is more mental that physical, is a fact.

13:29.635 --> 13:33.174
And that's why their brains (inaudible?) have gone off.

13:33.375 --> 13:37.008
And they are becoming just like, I think, potatoes now, I think.

13:37.649 --> 13:40.541
Because if you go on mentally imagining

13:40.742 --> 13:43.679
and playing around and working it out this way,

13:43.880 --> 13:46.085
it's going to be absolutely dangerous

13:46.286 --> 13:49.546
because it's all imagination, it has nothing to do with reality.

13:49.747 --> 13:52.289
The more you get into this kind of a nonsense

13:52.490 --> 13:55.466
the more you become away from reality.

13:56.076 --> 13:58.187
That never means you should be dry,

13:58.388 --> 14:02.537
it never means you should be, er,

14:02.738 --> 14:05.483
negligent of your responsibility, does not mean.

14:05.684 --> 14:09.135
As I said, the sap...

14:22.485 --> 14:30.703
As I've said that the sap in the tree rises, all right?

14:30.904 --> 14:35.867
Then it purifies, it nourishes

14:36.068 --> 14:40.485
every part of the plant separately in a different way.

14:40.686 --> 14:45.055
Like it's a mother, so mother, father, is a father,

14:45.256 --> 14:50.615
sister, is a sister, brother, is a sister, brother is a brother.

14:50.816 --> 14:53.654
The brother-sister relations

14:53.855 --> 14:59.987
cannot become husband-wife relations. How can it be?

15:07.831 --> 15:12.747
Now what happens really is that such a confusion in the mind

15:12.948 --> 15:18.462
and it has created tremendous problems for us.

15:21.306 --> 15:26.550
Then the sap nourishes all these things and comes back.

15:28.074 --> 15:30.709
It doesn't get attached to something:

15:30.910 --> 15:34.537
'Oh, she's my wife so the first priority is my wife.'

15:34.738 --> 15:37.693
Because I've said, of course, family life has to be all right,

15:37.894 --> 15:40.175
you must look after your family life.

15:41.043 --> 15:44.225
But that doesn't mean that you make everything suffer,

15:44.426 --> 15:47.285
that doesn't mean that your ascent should be finished.

15:47.496 --> 15:49.621
Cannot be that.

15:50.653 --> 15:53.311
You are not like ordinary people, you are saints

15:53.512 --> 15:56.855
and for the saints the main thing is their ascent,

15:57.066 --> 16:02.490
not their family life, not their material possessions, nothing.

16:02.691 --> 16:06.041
Nor their children, but their ascent, once they ascend

16:06.242 --> 16:10.355
everything will ascend with it.

16:16.315 --> 16:23.307
Now the understanding of chastity should be there.

16:23.567 --> 16:26.468
It can come to you very easily if you ascend,

16:26.669 --> 16:29.677
it's such a vicious circle.

16:29.878 --> 16:32.534
It is such a vicious circle.

16:32.735 --> 16:36.735
Now first of all you get your Realization, all right.

16:38.774 --> 16:44.980
Now you must know that Kundalini itself is the Mahakali shakti

16:45.481 --> 16:47.610
because she's the primordial.

16:47.811 --> 16:51.811
Mahakali shakti is the primordial shakti within us.

16:52.108 --> 16:55.108
And is the Kundalini is the Mahakali shakti.

16:56.920 --> 17:01.217
And she remains as a virgin within you.

17:01.418 --> 17:04.792
Means She's purity, She has a power to purify.

17:06.808 --> 17:14.288
All that happens when you get your Realization.

17:14.570 --> 17:20.327
She starts manifesting Her all beautiful aspects on you.

17:22.938 --> 17:26.938
Now the one who's sitting there is Shri Ganesh.

17:29.383 --> 17:32.515
Now people don't understand what is innocence is.

17:34.224 --> 17:36.059
Shri Ganesha is sitting there

17:36.293 --> 17:45.351
and He is the one who resides on mooladhara,

17:45.552 --> 17:48.906
even over his Mother because He's like a guard,

17:49.107 --> 17:54.054
and He's the one who tells whether She can ascend or not.

17:54.255 --> 18:00.044
Unless and until He gives permission She cannot ascend.

18:01.021 --> 18:08.461
So Shri Ganesha gives the ascending sort of, er,

18:09.368 --> 18:15.221
OK, alright, you can rise.

18:15.422 --> 18:22.218
And he stops all his work.

18:22.418 --> 18:26.128
You have seen th... Me, sitting for hours together.

18:26.356 --> 18:27.918
I don't have to go even to the bathroom

18:28.113 --> 18:31.646
or anywhere because Shri Ganesha stops all his work.

18:33.240 --> 18:36.414
He's only worried now about the ascent

18:36.615 --> 18:41.721
and on every chakra he checks your purity,

18:42.823 --> 18:46.870
and then accordingly the Kundalini tries to purify.

18:49.206 --> 18:53.803
But when it reaches the mental level,

18:54.004 --> 18:56.967
mental level has all these funny ideas of romance,

18:57.168 --> 18:59.862
this nonsense, that nonsense.

19:00.063 --> 19:02.958
I was surprised the other day,

19:03.159 --> 19:06.425
there was a girl who was having a trouble with her husband

19:06.626 --> 19:09.807
of expressing her love to her husband after marriage;

19:10.008 --> 19:12.609
before marriage she was all right.

19:13.578 --> 19:17.378
So I told her: 'Read some book where they have described

19:17.673 --> 19:21.672
the romance between husband and wife'.

19:22.806 --> 19:24.823
So she said, 'There is no book I have known.'

19:25.024 --> 19:26.667
Then I asked one professor to find out,

19:26.868 --> 19:28.801
he said there's no such book.

19:32.686 --> 19:36.530
In Sahaja Yoga the romance starts after the marriage.

19:37.765 --> 19:42.203
But also with maryadas, not at the cost of Sahaja Yoga,

19:42.404 --> 19:45.265
not at the cost, cost of your ascent.

19:48.647 --> 19:50.989
So all these ideas people have in the West,

19:51.185 --> 19:53.403
I know you are so much conditioned about it.

19:53.576 --> 19:55.443
So, you say now let us see,

19:55.631 --> 19:57.187
this is some (? inaudible word) after all,

19:57.388 --> 20:00.365
we have to give all the benefit to them.

20:02.099 --> 20:05.499
Now we select people, we do everything.

20:07.187 --> 20:09.658
Is all the work of Mahakali

20:09.859 --> 20:12.541
because you have to work on the vibrations,

20:12.742 --> 20:14.861
it's all the work of Mahakali.

20:15.062 --> 20:18.938
And after marriages also some marriages do fail.

20:19.431 --> 20:20.972
The reason being they do not know

20:21.173 --> 20:23.993
what is the purpose of their marriages.

20:31.838 --> 20:34.611
So the first and foremost thing of Mahakali is that

20:34.752 --> 20:39.767
She is purity. Absolute purity.

20:40.752 --> 20:45.964
And that purity if we cannot imbibe within us,

20:46.165 --> 20:49.165
we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

20:50.047 --> 20:54.424
Now this mind is so much conditioned, I know.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.750
Our children will be much better off than ourselves.

20:57.591 --> 21:01.591
Then they won't have these conditionings as we have had.

21:03.185 --> 21:06.060
And so many problems can be just avoided

21:06.261 --> 21:08.773
if you really become pure people.

21:09.930 --> 21:12.648
I see in the other society in which I move,

21:12.849 --> 21:14.111
nobody seems to be safe,

21:14.312 --> 21:16.921
somebody's wife is running with somebody's husband,

21:17.117 --> 21:19.624
somebody's daughter is running with somebody's father,

21:19.812 --> 21:23.679
somebody's running, a boy running with somebody's mother.

21:24.338 --> 21:28.212
Next day you find somebody else standing there husband and wife.

21:28.424 --> 21:32.043
Or sometimes it's so biz...funny that you can't believe it,

21:32.246 --> 21:36.582
how can it be? And everybody's in danger.

21:37.832 --> 21:39.158
A man goes to the house,

21:39.359 --> 21:43.135
he finds his wife run away with another man.

21:43.377 --> 21:47.938
Or a man goes for his work, he's run away with another woman.

21:48.139 --> 21:53.693
So the, She, She's the one, She gives you stithi, the state.

21:53.912 --> 21:57.302
Stithi means consolidation.

21:58.844 --> 22:04.836
Without your proper consolidation into your purity,

22:05.102 --> 22:10.681
not into your romantic life, you cannot rise.

22:13.455 --> 22:15.494
Like when we make the aeroplane,

22:15.697 --> 22:18.301
first we have to consolidate it.

22:18.502 --> 22:20.387
Fix it up properly, work it out,

22:20.588 --> 22:23.004
so that when it goes in the air

22:23.205 --> 22:27.986
all its parts do not fly away with the passengers.

22:29.932 --> 22:38.490
In the same way when we are ascending Shri Ganesha does that,

22:38.691 --> 22:43.502
he just stops the action of excretion completely

22:43.704 --> 22:47.827
and the ascent starts.

22:48.398 --> 22:50.429
They are doing their work all right,

22:50.629 --> 22:52.717
despite the fact they have been insulted,

22:52.918 --> 22:55.881
they have been neglected, we have misbehaved,

22:56.082 --> 22:58.131
whatever we might have done,

22:58.332 --> 23:00.519
they are doing their jobs alright.

23:00.738 --> 23:04.084
We can see it, so many people getting their Realization.

23:04.285 --> 23:06.874
But what are we doing about it?

23:08.851 --> 23:12.327
We cannot be even collective,

23:14.437 --> 23:17.905
we cannot attend collective things.

23:18.645 --> 23:20.757
And look at them how generous they are,

23:20.958 --> 23:25.306
they are extremely collective, they are extremely collective,

23:25.507 --> 23:32.147
to such an extent to somebody supposing worships Shri Krishna.

23:33.483 --> 23:35.686
His heart will catch.

23:37.563 --> 23:41.672
Why? Because you must also worship Shiva.

23:45.844 --> 23:49.444
They are so collective and so much connected with Me.

23:51.720 --> 23:53.441
So they are all collective, in the same way

23:53.642 --> 23:57.342
you are also devas, you also should be collective.

24:00.157 --> 24:01.676
As soon as you become collective

24:01.877 --> 24:04.877
all these nonsensical things will drop out.

24:05.667 --> 24:09.292
All these ideas will drop out. You do not become collective

24:09.493 --> 24:12.985
because you have not dropped out all these things,

24:13.185 --> 24:16.963
or else you are afraid of dropping them out.

24:18.847 --> 24:20.661
So let us know what is our purpose (is?),

24:20.862 --> 24:23.510
our purpose is to ascend.

24:24.925 --> 24:28.125
And what is the Mahakali power is doing for us.

24:29.204 --> 24:33.094
She is giving you your ascent through Kundalini.

24:33.321 --> 24:40.914
She is purify; She's giving you all the powers.

24:41.290 --> 24:48.454
She is protecting you all the time, She is giving you joy.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.576
But what are we doing for Her?

24:51.777 --> 25:04.138
Her only, only desire is that my children should be saintly,

25:04.339 --> 25:07.939
that they should have beautiful qualities of a saint.

25:08.535 --> 25:12.268
That he doesn't fall at every woman, fall at every man.

25:12.637 --> 25:15.121
It's not so cheap, you see.

25:18.395 --> 25:20.355
And mentally specially,

25:22.387 --> 25:24.848
I mean if the Sahasrara is spoilt

25:25.049 --> 25:27.275
how can Sahaja Yoga work out?

25:28.916 --> 25:31.916
The whole play is of the Sahasrara.

25:34.853 --> 25:39.424
And that purity should manifest.

25:39.625 --> 25:43.492
Through you we are going to change the world.

25:44.086 --> 25:45.690
Through no-one else.

25:45.891 --> 25:49.291
The Sahaja Yogis who are going to change the world.

25:49.602 --> 25:53.402
Now look at the generosity, when my body is so generous.

25:55.399 --> 25:58.851
Yesterday one lady came, I think she,

25:59.052 --> 26:02.914
she had a very bad liver. She came downstairs and I,

26:03.115 --> 26:07.115
my liver started pumping vibrations, terrible.

26:08.669 --> 26:11.545
She had a very bad liver though; she had taken drugs,

26:11.746 --> 26:13.725
I mean she had taken drugs and all that suffering

26:13.926 --> 26:18.425
was done to me, by this liver of mine.

26:18.785 --> 26:23.712
It didn't think that 'Oh Mother, she's come all the way out suffering'

26:23.913 --> 26:28.790
so started just pumping for that woman.

26:30.517 --> 26:35.500
So generous it is. And they are so generous themselves

26:35.701 --> 26:37.831
the way they bestow blessings (all over?).

26:38.032 --> 26:41.947
How they are hard working, how they are running about.

26:43.033 --> 26:45.025
What are we giving them?

26:50.205 --> 26:52.900
They give us joy, they look after us,

26:53.101 --> 26:56.634
they look after our children, they look after everything,

26:56.835 --> 27:00.502
they manage everything. Now what are we doing for them?

27:01.775 --> 27:03.689
Also I've heard that people don't help

27:03.890 --> 27:05.660
when they have to do postering, they have to do,

27:05.861 --> 27:09.720
very few people come up.

27:09.921 --> 27:15.735
This is being ungrateful,
very ungrateful to those.

27:15.936 --> 27:18.098
All the deities are present

27:18.298 --> 27:21.430
when you are having those collective programmes.

27:24.079 --> 27:25.901
And surprisingly the old Sahaja Yogis

27:26.102 --> 27:29.715
are more difficult than the new ones.

27:29.916 --> 27:32.303
I mean this I just, surprising.

27:32.504 --> 27:36.777
I mean are they becoming now out of date or something?

27:37.832 --> 27:40.928
Christ has said 'First will be the last'.

27:41.129 --> 27:44.349
I hope that's not going to happen.

27:44.550 --> 27:46.059
Sort of a confidence they develop,

27:46.260 --> 27:47.888
'Oh, we are old Sahaja Yogis.'

27:48.089 --> 27:52.089
We have had a horrible results in London

27:52.777 --> 27:54.568
of this consciousness that 'We are old,

27:54.769 --> 27:56.318
we'll do whatever we like.

27:56.519 --> 28:00.581
We may attend the collective or not.' A kind of a ego.

28:02.910 --> 28:05.988
Please be careful.

28:06.189 --> 28:09.872
Christ has clearly said 'First will be the last.'

28:10.072 --> 28:14.278
And I've seen so many of them, just getting out like that,

28:14.479 --> 28:17.807
even I don't know how they get out.

28:21.034 --> 28:26.268
In such stupid ways that unimaginable for anyone.

28:26.469 --> 28:32.026
Like one gentleman in Italy was an old Sahaja Yogi

28:32.227 --> 28:36.372
just got up and said: 'I am Maha Mataji.'

28:37.271 --> 28:41.406
Everyone started looking at him. 'What do you mean?'

28:41.607 --> 28:48.075
'I am Maha Mataji and I'm going to do all this myself.'

28:49.545 --> 28:53.022
So they said, 'Alright, so we are going out of ashram.'

28:53.225 --> 28:56.664
'No, no, no, I can't manage the ashram, I'm getting out.'

28:56.865 --> 28:59.509
And he went and stayed with someone, that lady,

28:59.713 --> 29:05.447
who heard against me and got cancer and died.

29:12.312 --> 29:15.174
In the collectivity supposing you have one problem,

29:15.375 --> 29:20.171
another one has some problem. It just works out, balances.

29:23.406 --> 29:29.293
As one finger is cut out, it is useless

29:29.494 --> 29:36.025
or a nail which is taken out is useless. It dies.

29:36.892 --> 29:40.020
So that is how we are organizing

29:40.221 --> 29:43.916
our spiritual death and ultimately I don't know what else.

29:44.117 --> 29:45.622
And then they come back that

29:45.823 --> 29:48.010
'Mother I have got now these troubles so I have come back,

29:48.211 --> 29:51.750
I was out of Sahaja Yoga for three years.'

29:51.951 --> 29:53.531
I say: 'What do you mean, out of Sahaja Yoga?'

29:53.732 --> 29:57.115
'I didn't attend any collective programme.'

30:00.795 --> 30:04.075
I am thinking of the collectivity of the whole world,

30:04.552 --> 30:09.765
that's my vision, and if Sahaja Yogis cannot be collective

30:09.966 --> 30:13.710
who is going to be collective?

30:13.911 --> 30:17.317
Who is going to fulfill my vision?

30:22.272 --> 30:26.637
So all of you, those who call themselves Sahaja Yogis,

30:26.838 --> 30:29.494
must attend the programme.

30:31.158 --> 30:33.355
And the second thing is that

30:33.556 --> 30:41.556
there was a little problem of generosity of people.

30:42.345 --> 30:45.878
Of course that's also is a character of Mahalaxshmi,

30:46.098 --> 30:48.652
She's very generous.

30:48.989 --> 30:55.059
And when you are generous in giving vibrations

30:55.778 --> 31:00.209
and looking after people, this and that,

31:00.410 --> 31:03.558
then Mahalaxshmi's principle works out.

31:03.759 --> 31:06.011
But Mahalaxshmi doesn't give money to people

31:06.212 --> 31:09.298
who are miserly, will never give.

31:10.486 --> 31:16.107
They may have money in the bank but they can never enjoy.

31:19.029 --> 31:24.211
So if there is need people have to give money to Sahaja Yoga.

31:24.412 --> 31:28.771
I have been supplying lot of money, as you know, from the very beginning.

31:29.076 --> 31:30.578
Those who are early Sahaja Yogis will know

31:30.779 --> 31:32.979
how much I have been able to pay.

31:33.162 --> 31:36.542
But now we are growing and everybody should know

31:36.743 --> 31:43.133
that we have to pay. After all this is our responsibility.

31:43.337 --> 31:46.943
Where are we going to spend our money, in what?

31:47.144 --> 31:49.487
I mean my family feels that, that what,

31:49.730 --> 31:53.167
whatever money I'm spending for Sahaja Yoga is the best.

31:53.363 --> 31:56.635
They get punyas, is the best for them.

31:56.836 --> 32:04.836
Only with punyas you get more wealth, health and prosperity.

32:05.117 --> 32:08.117
If you do not have punyas you cannot get it.

32:09.038 --> 32:13.295
It will come and go away.

32:13.496 --> 32:17.808
It will disappear, into thin air.

32:21.034 --> 32:24.971
So I was surprised that people are not generous.

32:28.424 --> 32:34.407
We have to know that we are so much better off people

32:34.608 --> 32:37.608
than many others.

32:38.678 --> 32:41.586
Like the Eastern Bloc people are not so good

32:41.787 --> 32:43.646
in money matters just now.

32:44.170 --> 32:48.157
I'm not saying that we have to help them but we have to think.

32:48.365 --> 32:50.786
Have we sent something for them as presents?

32:51.389 --> 32:53.389
Can we do something for them?

32:53.991 --> 32:58.584
The matter has the value which is again Mahakali's power.

32:58.785 --> 33:02.738
Is the power of Mahakali,

33:03.082 --> 33:09.194
that the matter carries the love.

33:09.395 --> 33:11.897
Expresses.

33:15.124 --> 33:19.867
So many times I have seen how, very sweetly,

33:20.068 --> 33:21.750
they gave me something.

33:21.951 --> 33:26.208
I really don't take anything and I don't need anything

33:26.409 --> 33:29.096
but certain things which show so such concern,

33:29.297 --> 33:34.485
such understanding, such love.

33:35.352 --> 33:38.047
How will you express your love?

33:39.399 --> 33:42.672
To those people who're so far away.

33:45.930 --> 33:53.096
You just try, try to give, try to give for Sahaja Yoga also

33:53.297 --> 33:58.906
and you'll be amazed how it will work out.

33:59.953 --> 34:04.645
For collectivity we have to know that Shri Bhairavanath

34:04.846 --> 34:09.541
and Shri Hanumana and Shri Ganesha,

34:09.742 --> 34:14.587
these three principles that work within

34:14.788 --> 34:18.227
us, all of them have parallel work to do, parallel work,

34:18.428 --> 34:22.516
they do not interfere for each other. But if it comes to help

34:22.717 --> 34:28.879
they go all out, there's no quarrel.

34:29.079 --> 34:31.785
No quarrel between the two, no.

34:32.043 --> 34:34.504
If Hanuman needs Bhairava, he is there,

34:34.715 --> 34:38.855
if Bhairava needs Hanumana he is there, all out.

34:39.960 --> 34:46.918
So this collectivity comes only by understanding one thing

34:47.119 --> 34:49.861
what a great work we are doing today,

34:50.126 --> 34:54.477
people are not conscious of that, they take it just by the way.

34:54.915 --> 34:58.355
In the war you have seen how people fight,

34:58.556 --> 35:02.907
even if they have the fear of dying.

35:03.202 --> 35:06.702
Formerly nobody was paid also in the military.

35:08.366 --> 35:11.547
But they went and fought, maybe for their country,

35:11.748 --> 35:15.547
for anything. And they used to join together to fight,

35:15.748 --> 35:19.391
they allowed themselves to be killed, they helped each other,

35:19.592 --> 35:22.860
they did this, all these qualities are there

35:23.061 --> 35:26.040
when we want to hate someone.

35:26.241 --> 35:28.905
But when we want to love someone why shouldn't we help,

35:29.117 --> 35:32.170
those qualities emerging out of us.

35:36.471 --> 35:40.934
These are the qualities of Mahakali

35:41.135 --> 35:45.289
because She is the expert of war affairs.

35:46.555 --> 35:49.274
She's the One who makes people work

35:50.337 --> 35:55.630
and She's the One who makes them fight because is the desire.

35:55.831 --> 36:02.073
They have nothing there, just the desire to do something

36:02.274 --> 36:09.237
and then they join together and then the Mahasaraswati helps them to act

36:09.438 --> 36:13.745
but first the desire is so strong.

36:13.945 --> 36:16.562
Now the desire has to be very very strong within us

36:16.763 --> 36:20.434
that we have to be for the emancipation of the whole world,

36:20.638 --> 36:22.989
we are the people, we are the special people,

36:23.169 --> 36:24.122
we are in the (foundation?).

36:24.404 --> 36:31.548
Nothing else is more important than our own personality

36:31.749 --> 36:36.282
being completely dedicated for Sahaja Yoga.

36:37.951 --> 36:43.425
This desire has to be extremely strong and very pure.

36:44.836 --> 36:50.282
Those actually desire it, actually,

36:50.634 --> 36:52.790
they get their Realization like that,

36:52.993 --> 36:54.836
they reach their depth like that

36:55.037 --> 36:57.243
and they enjoy doing work of Sah...

36:57.444 --> 37:01.178
they all the time they enjoy it, for them nothing is more important.

37:06.655 --> 37:08.634
As we say in, there's a saying that

37:08.835 --> 37:12.413
when you get the re...water of Ganges to drink,

37:12.614 --> 37:17.903
why should you take water from dirty, er, rivers?

37:20.316 --> 37:22.970
So the whole attention is that side,

37:23.447 --> 37:27.183
the all the joy you get out of this romance and this love,

37:27.358 --> 37:32.584
and this and that, becomes zero before it because it's Nirananda.

37:32.844 --> 37:35.687
Only joy.

37:35.888 --> 37:39.005
In the marriage you see wife says like this, says that,

37:39.206 --> 37:45.789
er, all this is so conditioning. Any, any joy.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.214
You have different joys on different centers,

37:49.415 --> 37:51.542
they are all given by Mahakali,

37:51.743 --> 37:54.985
but the greatest of all you have got after Realization

37:55.274 --> 38:00.633
is the Nirananda, that state you must reach, to Nirananda state.

38:02.525 --> 38:05.337
If you are in that state of Nirananda,

38:06.090 --> 38:10.863
You are absolutely purified.

38:11.242 --> 38:15.341
But how to bring the purity.

38:16.137 --> 38:19.433
Just by developing thoughtless awareness

38:19.634 --> 38:23.962
and looking at things without thinking.

38:27.195 --> 38:31.673
For that you have to be collective. If you are collective,

38:31.874 --> 38:34.163
I am there, wherever you are collective,

38:34.452 --> 38:38.431
wherever you gather, I am there

38:38.632 --> 38:40.778
and nothing gives me greater pleasure

38:41.011 --> 38:45.230
to hear that all of you are attending this programme.

38:46.310 --> 38:49.150
You'll be amazed that in Australia we have so many

38:49.351 --> 38:59.460
centers in every, every city but they all attend

38:59.661 --> 39:05.207
the programmes of collectivity

39:05.408 --> 39:12.824
because they know collectivity is the ocean of nourishment.

39:15.290 --> 39:20.893
This is the simplest thing we have to do,

39:21.094 --> 39:25.098
but the bhoots are much more collective.

39:25.299 --> 39:30.650
Much more collective. Bhoots can go

39:30.851 --> 39:35.037
to such a length of fraternity

39:35.238 --> 39:39.144
that you'll be amazed.

39:43.015 --> 39:45.837
There was a lady in France only.

39:46.038 --> 39:50.174
She was an old lady and her daughter was in Sahaja Yoga.

39:50.374 --> 39:54.165
She had become absolutely mad so she put her in the,

39:54.366 --> 39:55.620
I mean absolutely bhootish,

39:55.820 --> 39:58.806
and so she put her in a elderly home.

39:59.007 --> 40:03.626
And in the elderly home she only knew how to go to church on Sundays,

40:03.827 --> 40:05.531
she would dress up and go to church,

40:05.731 --> 40:08.653
that's only sensible thing she used to do.

40:10.366 --> 40:15.670
So she put her in the thing and there was a church,

40:15.879 --> 40:20.045
and she told me this, her daughter told me that it is very amazing

40:20.246 --> 40:23.192
that all of them get up in the morning,

40:23.392 --> 40:25.995
dress up well and go to church

40:26.196 --> 40:29.318
and in the, inside the church there are graves of people

40:29.519 --> 40:33.998
who have died, out of those, I mean,

40:34.198 --> 40:38.497
half-mad or full-mad elderly people.

40:38.698 --> 40:42.032
Otherwise they did not know even how to wear their dresses,

40:42.233 --> 40:46.025
they didn't know how to eat their food, they didn't know anything

40:46.226 --> 40:48.541
but when it came to going

40:48.742 --> 40:52.130
to church to that bhootish place where all the bhoots were there,

40:52.373 --> 40:55.560
they all would get up in the morning, dress up properly

40:55.755 --> 40:59.836
and go to the church, sit down, sing hymns and come back.

41:00.037 --> 41:03.131
As if like possessions.

41:03.332 --> 41:06.453
Such a fraternity of bhoots there is.

41:06.654 --> 41:08.710
As soon as one bhoot comes in,

41:08.911 --> 41:11.919
one bhoot came now recently from Australia.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.906
Now he is gathering all the bhoots round here.

41:15.107 --> 41:20.377
Even to Pune there he gathered, all the bhoots, immediately.

41:20.589 --> 41:24.411
Then he came here, now he's gathering those bhoots.

41:24.612 --> 41:26.263
People are getting friendly with him.

41:26.464 --> 41:29.573
Exactly who are bhoots you can make it out

41:29.774 --> 41:31.292
by just seeing a bhoot sitting there

41:31.493 --> 41:34.109
and who is sitting next to that person.

41:34.305 --> 41:37.471
They are so attracted like a magnet,

41:37.672 --> 41:40.945
well the magnet is the quality of Mahakali.

41:45.719 --> 41:50.072
Bhoots know me better than anybody else can know

41:50.273 --> 41:54.202
because they know my past, they are in the past.

41:54.468 --> 41:57.666
And they know who has got bhoots

41:57.867 --> 41:59.976
and how they attract each other,

42:00.281 --> 42:04.272
and how they act on a bhootish person.

42:08.484 --> 42:12.383
That is why the positive collectivity has to be there.

42:13.790 --> 42:18.149
But when it comes to positivity they do not get collective.

42:19.251 --> 42:21.798
All those who do not get collective will gradually

42:21.999 --> 42:27.071
go into the fraternity of bhoots

42:27.272 --> 42:30.272
because today we are dealing about Mahakali.

42:30.510 --> 42:33.913
She is the One who knows everything about these bhootish things,

42:34.114 --> 42:36.700
she's in charge, I mean.

42:36.900 --> 42:40.276
She's the Lord of all these bhoots and She knows

42:40.477 --> 42:43.676
and She looks after then and She manages them.

42:43.958 --> 42:47.512
But where's, (inaudible word?) want to go into that realm,

42:47.778 --> 42:51.832
what has She to do?

42:52.033 --> 42:54.633
She has locked them up on one side

42:54.834 --> 42:56.958
but Sahaja Yogis want to go there,

42:57.162 --> 43:00.857
just enter through back doors into that area,

43:01.058 --> 43:04.597
what can you do?

43:05.990 --> 43:09.363
Of course She protects, She doesn't want anyone to go there,

43:09.564 --> 43:12.201
She's just kept them out and told the bhoots

43:12.402 --> 43:17.396
not to come this side, but Sahaja Yogis only go there.

43:17.597 --> 43:21.090
That's been reported.

43:23.965 --> 43:29.318
Under these circumstances, Sahaja Yoga has gone very far,

43:29.519 --> 43:32.662
very much in so many other countries.

43:32.863 --> 43:35.175
In France you have seen yesterday

43:35.376 --> 43:41.506
how this ananda shakti of the Mother acted on people. '

43:41.706 --> 43:45.277
It was wonderful to see that, everybody came to me

43:45.478 --> 43:48.363
and they were full of smiles, I have never seen

43:48.564 --> 43:52.160
any French woman of that age smiling, never, no question,

43:52.361 --> 43:55.321
even if you tickled them, even if you certify that

43:55.533 --> 43:59.261
this is a joke they'll not smile like that.

43:59.462 --> 44:01.470
I've never seen their teeth.

44:01.837 --> 44:05.898
Yesterday the whole face was lit up, so many of them,

44:06.099 --> 44:08.798
something so miraculous it was.

44:08.999 --> 44:16.368
This anandini shakti of Mahakali was acting so beautifully yesterday

44:16.569 --> 44:19.642
and you are the people who will now

44:19.842 --> 44:21.779
guide or misguide them.

44:22.859 --> 44:26.303
If you become, all of you become,

44:26.504 --> 44:28.563
higher personalities,

44:28.764 --> 44:31.372
if you become collective all of you,

44:31.572 --> 44:33.706
and if you become generous,

44:33.914 --> 44:37.786
and if you become absolutely pure, they will say

44:37.987 --> 44:42.364
'Now look at these people, how beautiful they look.'

44:42.575 --> 44:45.679
You already look very beautiful, your faces shine,

44:45.880 --> 44:49.880
but it will all disappear.

44:52.017 --> 45:00.830
And the effects of disappearance are not very simple.

45:01.030 --> 45:05.828
So be careful, I of course bless you,

45:06.029 --> 45:14.029
with all the qualities of Bhairava,

45:14.623 --> 45:18.887
as He is the greatest disciple of Mahakali

45:19.088 --> 45:21.293
and He is the One who is running up and down,

45:21.494 --> 45:24.025
morning till evening every time, specially in the night

45:24.291 --> 45:27.949
He is working so very hard killing these horrible rakshasas,

45:28.150 --> 45:31.978
this, that,

45:34.308 --> 45:39.120
and achieving such results.

45:39.320 --> 45:44.644
We have to join Him, all of us, and work it out.

45:44.895 --> 45:49.068
May God Bless You.
