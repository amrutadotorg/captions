00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:12.090
Today I am feeling rather sad [that] had to
say something, hard things yesterday and you

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.580
know [a] mother is like that (Mother is referring
to a lecture in Marathi the previous day).

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.869
You have to correct your children, you have
to tell them something, but you don’t like

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.060
it and you have to really put up yourself
to that point, that you can say something

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.780
to your children.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.519
And the effect was good they said, but I didn’t
want them to cry or weep.

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.719
I want them to be corrected, to understand
the responsibility that they have.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:58.280
We have to understand that we have a responsibility
towards Sahaja Yoga; and that is, if you understand

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.390
the first responsibility, is that you have
to be very good Sahaja Yogis to begin with;

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.580
that’s the greatest.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.080
I have seen some very little girls also are
very show-offs: they’ll be the first to

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.430
sit further, they’ll be attracting my attention,
doing these things.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.370
So they have to be told to behave themselves.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.630
There are so many things like that which are
to be told to your children also.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.610
Like today so many leaders came and they also
told me what is happening in India now, specially

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:45.450
in Maharashtra – but I think it is all over
– that they are taking to Western life,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.430
sitting before the mirror, all the time dressing
up, thinking about their beauty, this, that.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.300
I mean, it was never done before.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.940
And the mothers allow them to do because they
don’t want to face them.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.350
And then they see bad pictures and bad films
and things like that, and then they have a

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.501
bad effect of these bad films and they try
to follow: at the age of sixteen years they

00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:13.290
want to fall in love or something like that.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.370
All this nonsense is coming, I know that this
filmmaking is a very dangerous thing these

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.370
days.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.540
They are making all kinds of films to show
that a sixteen year old girl and an eighteen

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.150
year old boy run away from the house because
they are ‘in love’.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.099
And what do they understand of it?

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.129
No maturity of any kind to have a good married
life.

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.329
But for a born-realised children it is different.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.849
They are very different.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.959
Because I have seen the reaction of my own
grandchildren, how they react.

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:57.951
So, like one of them said to me, “Can you
imagine grandma that in our gardens, one young

00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:02.870
man running, another young woman running after
him, dancing in the garden and kissing.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.310
Is it possible?

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.180
The stupid things they do in the films!”

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.060
They make fun of all these things.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:17.760
The youngest one, he came once to Cabella
and there was some film made, of one actress,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.010
‘Mandakini’ or something.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.939
She’s a Muslim lady, but she calls herself
‘Mandakini’.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.950
“Never see her films!” he says, “very
bad, very bad!”

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.150
I said, “What happened?”

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.950
“Do you know what she did?

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.370
She went into the River Ganges with very thin
clothes and she came out and she insulted

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.370
all of us.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.370
We don’t see her film."

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.579
I said, “Really?

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.420
But must be, I said, the director."

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.840
“Yes, that horrible Raj Kapoor, he’s the
worst.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.590
Thank God he’s dead now."

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.590
Imagine!

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.790
Even when they were young their reactions
were like this.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.670
Even I have seen my elder one.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.719
She was engaged.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.090
She was thinking she’ll select her own.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.919
She wanted to marry somebody and she only
stuck onto one fellow to see him, but to the

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.489
end she was saying, “I don’t want to get
engaged till I see this man thoroughly.

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.340
I have not seen him."

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.349
I mean she never gave in fully.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.470
So I was we are never bothered about it.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.640
Whenever they are they behave in such a manner.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.030
Like another one in Delhi I asked her, “Why
do you wear these khadi clothes all the time?

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.500
Can’t you wear something better?

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.880
What will people think, that we don’t give
you any money?”

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.260
She said, “No, it’s better.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.440
Nobody looks at you.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.840
It’s a very good idea."

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.130
So this is a sign of a really born-realised.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.370
I have studied all of them, my grandson and
three children.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.060
There’s no question.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.420
They are so moral, so moral!

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.670
And we never told them these things.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.970
We never told them that, “This is good,”
or, “that good,” or, “you should not

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.970
do this."

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.690
They, themselves [understand].

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:07.780
Then my sister’s grandson the other day
we met, he’s only a five year old boy, born-realised.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:15.460
So in Sahaja Yoga we don’t eat paan, so
my sister, another sister, he calls as all

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.250
of us as ‘grandmas’, she ate the paan.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.110
He just started fighting, “Why do you eat
paan?

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.110
Dirty thing.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.110
Throw away!

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.110
I will have nothing to do.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.110
I am kutti with you!”

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.110
Means I am now finished with it.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.460
Five year old!

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.460
He protested.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.650
And then he suddenly started crying.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.310
I said, “Why are you crying now?”

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.740
“All of them are eating paan.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.810
They are all bad people.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.860
I don’t want to have them here!”

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.540
I mean in the marriage, they were eating paan!

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.560
So, he said he made everybody throw away their
paan!

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.230
So I told him, “There are people who don’t
eat paan, don’t take cigarettes and don’t

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.440
drink and they are with us.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.550
They are called Sahaja Yogis."

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.710
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!” he said.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.250
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.840
Well, why do you tolerate, grandma, all these
people?

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.160
Tell them off!

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.810
They have no business to eat paan."

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.370
I was surprised [at] a five year old child.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.170
Maybe, you might say, it’s my relationship
or my blood in them or whatever it is.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.870
They are really remarkably moral people, remarkably,
for their age.

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.490
Also they are moral not only for themselves,
but also their friends and everyone, extremely

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.910
moral.

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.130
They don’t like people sitting before the
mirror for hours together, never.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.910
They said, “They must be bhoots."

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.640
“We had a lady who was working in our house."

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.060
She said, “She doesn’t clean my bathroom,
she’s just looking at the mirror and looking

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.060
at herself!”

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.770
I said, “Isn’t she frightened of herself?”

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.530
All kinds of things!

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.560
They make such fun of all the films, such
films you see.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:58.030
They have seen once there was one film which
my daughters had seen five times, making fun

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.190
of the whole thing.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:00.570
You know, they really make fun of all that.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.440
So once my husband had to see that film with
other relations in Calcutta.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.440
He came back.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.170
He said, “Never see that film again!

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:09.970
Never send those children to that film!”

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.340
They had already seen it five times!

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.240
But such a reaction, you know.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:24.500
They never take to modern ideas [like] answering
back to parents and, “I’ll do what I like!”

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.500
Why?

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.850
Why don’t they do it?

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.550
And to me they are absolutely subservient.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.470
If I am having the bath, they’ll put on
the radio.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.860
If I come out, they are sitting there with
a towel and powder for my feet.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:45.550
All the time they are worried about me, why?

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:51.080
Not about their parents, so much as they are
worried about me.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.240
This is because they are born realised and
the children who are not, these are half-way

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.450
children, they are like that: they get impressed
by this Western thing and all that.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.220
So the parents should see and tell them, “What
is this nonsense?”

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.100
So many things I can tell you about them.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.960
I have been studying them and I was worried
that if these children were not born in my

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.770
family, what would have happened to them?

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:19.230
They don’t like to hear any funny songs
– nothing.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.840
Once, early in the morning, my daughter was
playing some ghazals.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:28.230
so she got up and came in the room.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.230
She said, “What’s this going on, early
in the morning, crying, crying?

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.230
What is this?”

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.230
So I said, “This is ghazal."

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:36.940
“What a puzzle, early in the morning, to
make everyone weep!”

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.830
You see, these Lucknow people and all those
are very ghazalias: only in the mind.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:48.640
They never love their wives, never do anything
for them, but they are romantic type.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.950
And these girls know about it.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:53.990
“And we Lucknowas.

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.070
We don’t want to marry these!

00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:01.910
They’re just romancing in their heads and
they don’t love their wives and the wives

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.110
also don’t love."

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.110
So this is what it is.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.680
I mean, they are so mature.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:16.210
These two were studying in Patna and they
had only one chappal (sandal) left with them,

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.520
which was half broken.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.800
So I told, “All right, come along with me
to Delhi.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.660
I’ll buy good chappals for you."

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.960
I took them there.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.550
They wouldn’t buy another one.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.820
“One chappal is only.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.680
One chappal and one chappal."

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.980
I said, “Why you have come all the way just
to buy only one chappal?”

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.220
“Yes, when this will break we will buy another
one."

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.220
And the clothes?

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.220
Nothing!

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.540
I forced on them their clothes.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:40.540
They wouldn’t take it.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.540
They said, “No, no, no, no!

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.540
There’s no need to spend.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.630
Why do you want to spend?

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.940
Already we have got so much loan on our head,
of our parents.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:54.529
And why do you want to spend more money?”

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:55.529
Even grandson.

00:09:55.529 --> 00:09:57.840
He said, “My school is so bad!

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.240
All the girls want to talk to me."

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.010
And now he’s head of the class, school also.

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:05.060
They’re so wise, so sensible.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:12.110
And it’s an example, before you to see that
your children don’t take to stupid things

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.140
of so called romance and all that.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.500
They don’t believe in all that.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:27.110
Today I have to tell you because I have got
reports of some girls who have been misbehaving,

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.310
sitting before the [mirror].

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.310
Why?

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.310
Why so much?

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:37.570
And I don’t know, I can’t face mirror
for more than for two minutes at the most.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.420
Not because I think I have something wrong
with me, but the vibrations start hitting

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:46.730
me!

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.700
I don’t know how I look or what.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.200
Why should you worry so much?

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.580
We should be confident, have self-respect.

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:03.680
All is accepted, dirty, filthy, from the West.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.130
And in Sanskrit, as you know I have told you,
they were called as mlecchas.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.860
Mleccha: mala-iccha.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:15.050
They want all dirt and filth, that’s what.

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.730
Iccha is the desire; and they take to it.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:22.070
Even in the Muslim culture that is there,
that’s why in Lucknow and all that, I used

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.070
to get suffocated the way people were romantic.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.070
No sense of proportion.

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.310
But, thank God now, Lucknow has changed so
much.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:35.589
I am really amazed how these people just looking
at women: every woman they must see, turn

00:11:35.589 --> 00:11:36.589
their head at every woman.

00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:41.630
I mean, their necks might break one day.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.090
But in the West, I have seen, all women look
at the men!

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:49.280
First I didn’t understand what is going
on.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.920
All the time like this, like this, like this.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.670
And then they end up in a lunatic asylum.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.220
What will happen otherwise also?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.260
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.770
We have our own traditions.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.370
We are people of very high families.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:06.870
Why should we take to these dirty things?

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:12.170
So I would request you to tell your children
not to be impressed by this dirty, horrible

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.370
culture that has evolved.

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:15.240
It was not so bad in the West.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.450
I tell you, it was not.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:26.920
It is now ruined; the whole place They have
no idea as to how filthy it has become.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:37.370
If you are real Sahaja Yogis, you will be
very quiet, unassuming, dignified, mature,

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.839
as well as you will be very moral.

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:43.120
You have to be very [moral].

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:49.520
And you should only like people who are moral.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:13:00.160
This is not to be taught, but to be shown
to the children, how you yourself live.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:09.490
If the mother is all the time busy with her
beauty and this and that, the child also takes

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.490
it.

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:25.180
All this filth and dirt should not settle
down, at least in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:30.210
This is what today I wanted to tell you: [about]
these people, really I got worried.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.300
They have no sense of music.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.740
They don’t understand music.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.570
They have no sense of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:42.070
They are supposed to be your children!

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:49.100
Tomorrow the same children will definitely
cleanse the whole world, but what is your

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.100
attention is?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.402
You are giving money to them to do what they
like.

00:13:53.402 --> 00:13:57.750
You are not putting your any attention.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.920
Parents are there to correct their children.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.550
They have to.

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.700
And if they argue, give them two tight slaps
and they will be all right.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.920
In the West, also, the children are horrible,
absolutely horrible children.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:13.709
They’ll go on asking you questions, “Why?

00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:14.709
Why?”

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:17.110
Once I was travelling with a child like that
and the mother said, “What to do with this

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.110
child?”

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.720
I said, “You ask him: ‘Yesterday what
I answered, do you remember that?

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.220
Tell me what I answered you!’

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.800
” Since that day he stopped [asking] ‘why’.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.350
Children shouldn’t talk so much.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:31.620
They have no understanding of anything, still
little babies.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.029
How are they to talk, as if they are wisdom
personified?

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:38.080
This is all Western new method of educating
their children.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.160
“Let them be what they want, they are free.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160
So what?”

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:48.089
With this method, no artist has been produced,
no musician has been produced, no composer

00:14:48.089 --> 00:14:49.140
has been produced.

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.240
The whole quality has gone down.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:58.820
First you need some discipline in life to
become something.

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:04.030
But also it’s very money-oriented in the
West, that if the boy has to clean the car,

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.650
you pay him £2.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.589
No Sahaja Yogi should do that.

00:15:10.589 --> 00:15:12.630
He has to do that.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.220
He sits in the car, so why shouldn’t he
clean it?

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.029
He should feel, “This is my responsibility."

00:15:19.029 --> 00:15:26.180
And a very big problem you will face if your
children turn out to be such horrible ones.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.950
Of course, I am trying to make a school here
for the Sahaj children, but the parents should

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.209
not spoil them.

00:15:33.209 --> 00:15:35.110
Same with the western people.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.690
Now they have got their children, they are
so attached to their children.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.480
They think it is their own property, they
can do what they like with them.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.640
We made the school.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.100
We paid for the school.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.510
We collected everything, did all that.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.900
They are very nicely coming here to take away
their children to their own countries.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:57.250
They cannot think even that they are Sahaja
Yogis [and] they have to be in Ganapatipule

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.250
[even] if you are not.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:05.220
They are not going to be like you that, for
some time, take all advantage of Sahaja Yoga

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:13.320
and then just become the same stupid fools.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.300
So they decided to take away their children,
this, that.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.751
I told Yogi, “Why are you sending the children
[home]?”

00:16:18.751 --> 00:16:20.130
He said, “The parents are…”

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:24.100
Who are the parents?

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:28.070
Who are the parents?

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.550
So this idea should not be there.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.269
Children are to be involved in the main stream.

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:34.990
They should be in the main stream.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:36.360
They should be here.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.861
Otherwise, we have nothing to do with you
and your children.

00:16:38.861 --> 00:16:39.861
Get out!

00:16:39.861 --> 00:16:43.670
Now, I have to take a strong view of the whole
thing.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.190
I find, specially in Australia, they are becoming
extremely secluded people.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:53.500
Some of them are having, in the ashram, their
own rooms, their own television, their own

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.010
this thing, their own cooking.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:56.590
This own business has to go away.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.710
Throw away all such people from the ashrams.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.310
I am surprised at Australians!

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:12.630
They got out of the jail and again want to
go into the same jail.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:19.650
Next time all the children have to come to
Ganapatipule; next time, and nobody has to

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:20.980
[say], “We have booked their seats.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.100
We have done that."

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.100
I told them, “Put them into trouble.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.100
Tell them we can’t send the children.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.670
Let them pay for that then they will understand."

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:38.690
Now the last, and not the least, is the way
still we are attached to money.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.660
Sahaja Yoga is free, agreed.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.370
Your Realisation is free.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:54.110
But this time, can you believe, [on] the sixteenth
of November, I telephoned from Russia to find

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:58.890
out how much money was collected and there
was very little money there.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:04.030
And such a big programme, such a difficult
programme and such an expensive programme

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.429
we had done.

00:18:05.429 --> 00:18:08.299
At the right time they let me down!

00:18:08.299 --> 00:18:10.540
So I had to borrow money to have this programme.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:11.540
Can you believe it?

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:20.480
They don’t feel responsible that they’re
troubling Mother like this!

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.890
I was not sure how many are coming, how many
are not coming.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.680
First they said only two hundred coming, then
three hundred are coming, then I heard there

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.580
were six hundred!

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:43.470
Have you got a big bank account here that
you can just do what you like?

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.280
So they are not responsible.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:57.600
Next time if you do not pay money till the
end of October, you are out of the tour!

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.679
Anywhere!

00:18:59.679 --> 00:19:06.460
I cannot go on borrowing money like this every
time.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.890
And then I have to return that money to my
husband.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:15.170
It’s a fact!

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.690
Everybody knows.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:28.770
[In] money matters, also, we have not yet
been able to be real Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:35.240
Now, this Shyamji, has bought these saris
on a little concession and he thought that

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.620
he will sell those and whatever concession
he gets it, he will give to Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.800
He’s a very honest man.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:48.890
But because some saris were a little less
in price they were not [sold by] Sahaj Yogis,

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:53.700
nothing, and they were artificial saris, people
went and bought saris from him.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.090
And none of them bought saris from Shyamji.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:02.230
They are very vain type.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.860
Whatever is the little profit that he will
have, he gives it to me.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.179
We have so much extra expenses.

00:20:09.179 --> 00:20:15.280
You have no idea!

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.290
Same about presents.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.840
The money, you people, you gave me about the
presents, also, is so delayed.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:29.840
Just now we have taken thirty-five thousand
pounds, extra, for the musicians, which is

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.250
not yet paid back.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:36.600
Here are [the] people, you can ask them, they
are dealing in the bank.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.860
I have paid for this Chindwada house, four
lakhs of rupees already, not a single pie

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.929
(1/192 rupee) has been given so far, paid
for.

00:20:43.929 --> 00:20:48.010
We have to do so many things.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.900
But so many Sahaja Yogis there are.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.570
I tell them all, “Don’t give me any presents.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:54.270
I don’t want any presents from you."

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.270
But you must pay for all these expenses which
are incurred.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:02.920
Today is the first day I am talking about
it, because this time you really put me out

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.280
completely.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.390
Absolutely, I was.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:12.760
I didn’t know what will I do.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.929
I never borrow money.

00:21:14.929 --> 00:21:23.900
Partly I got from Italy and partly I borrowed:
Partly, quite a lot.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.860
After all, everything needs money, you must
understand.

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:33.340
So, you see, next time if you do all these
things I’ll cancel the tours.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:41.640
Please, by the end of October, remember all
your money should be there.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:49.230
It’s not proper to say all these things
to you, I know, but you should also know what

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.330
trouble I am going through.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.330
For doing what?

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.760
For your Realisation, for your tours, for
your everything.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:02.040
I don’t need Sahaja Yoga do I?

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:16.100
Also, the last thing is this, as I have said,
money is needed just now, but maybe, might

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:22.169
be, something might [be] worked out when you
won’t need so much money; may.

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:32.620
It will only work out if you people are sincere.

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.160
So many things are to be done here, also.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.049
Of course, I have given a lot of money here.

00:22:37.049 --> 00:22:42.299
In these four years, I have been able to save
a lot of money, I must say; compared to previous

00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:46.170
years when you people were managing the money.

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.170
Since then I have saved.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:50.200
Because money doesn’t have legs to walk
out!

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.800
If you don’t spend, it is there!

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.540
“My children, my wife, my house, my everything."

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:06.980
What about “my Sahaj Yoga”?

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:18.380
It’s your responsibility now: you need it,
your family needs it, your country needs it.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.660
Everybody needs it.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.799
So it is your responsibility.

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:29.010
Please understand that you have got Sahaja
Yoga because you are special people.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:33.880
But the speciality is that you are responsible
for the whole world.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.740
Spreading Sahaja Yoga is all right, but to
be responsible.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:49.730
On the whole, of course, it has been really
a very good working out, I agree, but still

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:58.870
these are things that are missing which must
be somehow or other corrected: by the leaders,

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:03.360
by the world leaders, and coordinated.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.580
It should be done.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.049
After all, you know my age now.

00:24:08.049 --> 00:24:10.900
You don’t want to trouble me.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:18.059
This is the only kindness I need: not to go
on postponing things, not to go on being irresponsible,

00:24:18.059 --> 00:24:19.570
that’s all!

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:24.049
I have been telling you for the last fifteen
years [that] I don’t want any presents!

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:27.470
For presents, for saris, everybody’s anxious.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:32.960
Now this time every country wanted to give
me [a] sari.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.179
Just imagine!

00:24:34.179 --> 00:24:36.620
I don’t need that.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:42.110
I don’t know what I will do with it.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:49.190
But full attention to yourself and to the
collective work and to the global work.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:56.580
If I stop this work, it’s very easy, but
you don’t want that.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.390
Even few are coming, whatever it is.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.930
Definitely you tell me [that] so many are
coming – finished!

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:06.910
It’s hardly two, three years more, at the
most it will continue.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.299
It cannot go on forever.

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:17.100
We’ll have to think of something else.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:26.020
And my own style is that, whatever you give
for my pujas, I keep it for Sahaja Yoga only:

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:31.440
for the buying of silver, this, that.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.580
So much of silver I have given, so much gold
that is here is my own.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.850
Everything, most of the ornaments are my own.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.470
Now what else I should do?

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:49.370
Not that I want anything from you, but you
should be responsible and understand.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:51.210
All of you should, please.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:56.020
If you can really think that this is so important.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:01.220
Twelve disciples of Christ worked out Christianity
– only twelve.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:07.760
And they were fishermen: how they did it!

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:16.000
All right, so everybody is telling me that,
“Mother you must talk to them and tell them

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
about it."

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.460
So I have told you.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.289
I have done my job.

00:26:20.289 --> 00:26:26.480
Now it is for you to think what is good and
what should be done.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:32.740
Sahaja Yoga is your own: is for your children,
is for your family, is for the country, not

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:34.930
only [that, but] for the whole world, where
you live.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.450
You are such a great people who are realised-souls.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:43.470
Where are the realised-souls here?

00:26:43.470 --> 00:28:52.250
So have self-esteem, then you will feel responsible,
you know, “I am responsible."

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:59.919
Thank you very much.

00:28:59.919 --> 00:29:10.779
May God bless you.
