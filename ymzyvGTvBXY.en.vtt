00:03.759 --> 00:12.090
Today I am feeling rather sad [that] had to
say something, hard things yesterday and you

00:12.090 --> 00:19.580
know [a] mother is like that (Mother is referring
to a lecture in Marathi the previous day).

00:19.580 --> 00:24.869
You have to correct your children, you have
to tell them something, but you don’t like

00:24.869 --> 00:31.060
it and you have to really put up yourself
to that point, that you can say something

00:31.060 --> 00:33.780
to your children.

00:33.780 --> 00:42.519
And the effect was good they said, but I didn’t
want them to cry or weep.

00:42.519 --> 00:47.719
I want them to be corrected, to understand
the responsibility that they have.

00:47.719 --> 00:58.280
We have to understand that we have a responsibility
towards Sahaja Yoga; and that is, if you understand

00:58.280 --> 01:04.390
the first responsibility, is that you have
to be very good Sahaja Yogis to begin with;

01:04.390 --> 01:06.580
that’s the greatest.

01:06.580 --> 01:11.080
I have seen some very little girls also are
very show-offs: they’ll be the first to

01:11.080 --> 01:17.430
sit further, they’ll be attracting my attention,
doing these things.

01:17.430 --> 01:21.370
So they have to be told to behave themselves.

01:21.370 --> 01:28.630
There are so many things like that which are
to be told to your children also.

01:28.630 --> 01:35.610
Like today so many leaders came and they also
told me what is happening in India now, specially

01:35.610 --> 01:45.450
in Maharashtra – but I think it is all over
– that they are taking to Western life,

01:45.450 --> 01:51.430
sitting before the mirror, all the time dressing
up, thinking about their beauty, this, that.

01:51.430 --> 01:55.300
I mean, it was never done before.

01:55.300 --> 01:59.940
And the mothers allow them to do because they
don’t want to face them.

01:59.940 --> 02:05.350
And then they see bad pictures and bad films
and things like that, and then they have a

02:05.350 --> 02:09.501
bad effect of these bad films and they try
to follow: at the age of sixteen years they

02:09.501 --> 02:13.290
want to fall in love or something like that.

02:13.290 --> 02:18.370
All this nonsense is coming, I know that this
filmmaking is a very dangerous thing these

02:18.370 --> 02:19.370
days.

02:19.370 --> 02:24.540
They are making all kinds of films to show
that a sixteen year old girl and an eighteen

02:24.540 --> 02:27.150
year old boy run away from the house because
they are ‘in love’.

02:27.150 --> 02:31.099
And what do they understand of it?

02:31.099 --> 02:36.129
No maturity of any kind to have a good married
life.

02:36.129 --> 02:39.329
But for a born-realised children it is different.

02:39.329 --> 02:41.849
They are very different.

02:41.849 --> 02:46.959
Because I have seen the reaction of my own
grandchildren, how they react.

02:46.959 --> 02:57.951
So, like one of them said to me, “Can you
imagine grandma that in our gardens, one young

02:57.951 --> 03:02.870
man running, another young woman running after
him, dancing in the garden and kissing.

03:02.870 --> 03:04.310
Is it possible?

03:04.310 --> 03:07.180
The stupid things they do in the films!”

03:07.180 --> 03:09.060
They make fun of all these things.

03:09.060 --> 03:17.760
The youngest one, he came once to Cabella
and there was some film made, of one actress,

03:17.760 --> 03:19.010
‘Mandakini’ or something.

03:19.010 --> 03:21.939
She’s a Muslim lady, but she calls herself
‘Mandakini’.

03:21.939 --> 03:24.950
“Never see her films!” he says, “very
bad, very bad!”

03:24.950 --> 03:26.150
I said, “What happened?”

03:26.150 --> 03:27.950
“Do you know what she did?

03:27.950 --> 03:32.370
She went into the River Ganges with very thin
clothes and she came out and she insulted

03:32.370 --> 03:33.370
all of us.

03:33.370 --> 03:34.370
We don’t see her film."

03:34.370 --> 03:35.579
I said, “Really?

03:35.579 --> 03:38.420
But must be, I said, the director."

03:38.420 --> 03:41.840
“Yes, that horrible Raj Kapoor, he’s the
worst.

03:41.840 --> 03:46.590
Thank God he’s dead now."

03:46.590 --> 03:47.590
Imagine!

03:47.590 --> 03:52.790
Even when they were young their reactions
were like this.

03:52.790 --> 03:56.670
Even I have seen my elder one.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.719
She was engaged.

03:58.719 --> 04:01.090
She was thinking she’ll select her own.

04:01.090 --> 04:05.919
She wanted to marry somebody and she only
stuck onto one fellow to see him, but to the

04:05.919 --> 04:09.489
end she was saying, “I don’t want to get
engaged till I see this man thoroughly.

04:09.489 --> 04:11.340
I have not seen him."

04:11.340 --> 04:14.349
I mean she never gave in fully.

04:14.349 --> 04:17.470
So I was we are never bothered about it.

04:17.470 --> 04:20.640
Whenever they are they behave in such a manner.

04:20.640 --> 04:25.030
Like another one in Delhi I asked her, “Why
do you wear these khadi clothes all the time?

04:25.030 --> 04:26.500
Can’t you wear something better?

04:26.500 --> 04:29.880
What will people think, that we don’t give
you any money?”

04:29.880 --> 04:31.260
She said, “No, it’s better.

04:31.260 --> 04:32.440
Nobody looks at you.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.840
It’s a very good idea."

04:35.840 --> 04:38.130
So this is a sign of a really born-realised.

04:38.130 --> 04:42.370
I have studied all of them, my grandson and
three children.

04:42.370 --> 04:44.060
There’s no question.

04:44.060 --> 04:47.420
They are so moral, so moral!

04:47.420 --> 04:52.670
And we never told them these things.

04:52.670 --> 04:56.970
We never told them that, “This is good,”
or, “that good,” or, “you should not

04:56.970 --> 04:57.970
do this."

04:57.970 --> 04:59.690
They, themselves [understand].

04:59.690 --> 05:07.780
Then my sister’s grandson the other day
we met, he’s only a five year old boy, born-realised.

05:07.780 --> 05:15.460
So in Sahaja Yoga we don’t eat paan, so
my sister, another sister, he calls as all

05:15.460 --> 05:18.250
of us as ‘grandmas’, she ate the paan.

05:18.250 --> 05:21.110
He just started fighting, “Why do you eat
paan?

05:21.110 --> 05:22.110
Dirty thing.

05:22.110 --> 05:23.110
Throw away!

05:23.110 --> 05:24.110
I will have nothing to do.

05:24.110 --> 05:25.110
I am kutti with you!”

05:25.110 --> 05:26.110
Means I am now finished with it.

05:26.110 --> 05:27.460
Five year old!

05:27.460 --> 05:28.460
He protested.

05:28.460 --> 05:29.650
And then he suddenly started crying.

05:29.650 --> 05:31.310
I said, “Why are you crying now?”

05:31.310 --> 05:32.740
“All of them are eating paan.

05:32.740 --> 05:33.810
They are all bad people.

05:33.810 --> 05:35.860
I don’t want to have them here!”

05:35.860 --> 05:38.540
I mean in the marriage, they were eating paan!

05:38.540 --> 05:42.560
So, he said he made everybody throw away their
paan!

05:42.560 --> 05:48.230
So I told him, “There are people who don’t
eat paan, don’t take cigarettes and don’t

05:48.230 --> 05:50.440
drink and they are with us.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.550
They are called Sahaja Yogis."

05:51.550 --> 05:53.710
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!” he said.

05:53.710 --> 05:55.250
“I am a Sahaja Yogi!

05:55.250 --> 05:57.840
Well, why do you tolerate, grandma, all these
people?

05:57.840 --> 05:59.160
Tell them off!

05:59.160 --> 06:00.810
They have no business to eat paan."

06:00.810 --> 06:04.370
I was surprised [at] a five year old child.

06:04.370 --> 06:10.170
Maybe, you might say, it’s my relationship
or my blood in them or whatever it is.

06:10.170 --> 06:15.870
They are really remarkably moral people, remarkably,
for their age.

06:15.870 --> 06:22.490
Also they are moral not only for themselves,
but also their friends and everyone, extremely

06:22.490 --> 06:27.910
moral.

06:27.910 --> 06:32.130
They don’t like people sitting before the
mirror for hours together, never.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.910
They said, “They must be bhoots."

06:33.910 --> 06:37.640
“We had a lady who was working in our house."

06:37.640 --> 06:42.060
She said, “She doesn’t clean my bathroom,
she’s just looking at the mirror and looking

06:42.060 --> 06:43.060
at herself!”

06:43.060 --> 06:45.770
I said, “Isn’t she frightened of herself?”

06:45.770 --> 06:47.530
All kinds of things!

06:47.530 --> 06:51.560
They make such fun of all the films, such
films you see.

06:51.560 --> 06:58.030
They have seen once there was one film which
my daughters had seen five times, making fun

06:58.030 --> 06:59.190
of the whole thing.

06:59.190 --> 07:00.570
You know, they really make fun of all that.

07:00.570 --> 07:05.440
So once my husband had to see that film with
other relations in Calcutta.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.440
He came back.

07:06.440 --> 07:08.170
He said, “Never see that film again!

07:08.170 --> 07:09.970
Never send those children to that film!”

07:09.970 --> 07:13.340
They had already seen it five times!

07:13.340 --> 07:16.240
But such a reaction, you know.

07:16.240 --> 07:24.500
They never take to modern ideas [like] answering
back to parents and, “I’ll do what I like!”

07:24.500 --> 07:25.500
Why?

07:25.500 --> 07:28.850
Why don’t they do it?

07:28.850 --> 07:32.550
And to me they are absolutely subservient.

07:32.550 --> 07:34.470
If I am having the bath, they’ll put on
the radio.

07:34.470 --> 07:40.860
If I come out, they are sitting there with
a towel and powder for my feet.

07:40.860 --> 07:45.550
All the time they are worried about me, why?

07:45.550 --> 07:51.080
Not about their parents, so much as they are
worried about me.

07:51.080 --> 07:55.240
This is because they are born realised and
the children who are not, these are half-way

07:55.240 --> 07:59.450
children, they are like that: they get impressed
by this Western thing and all that.

07:59.450 --> 08:04.220
So the parents should see and tell them, “What
is this nonsense?”

08:04.220 --> 08:06.100
So many things I can tell you about them.

08:06.100 --> 08:11.960
I have been studying them and I was worried
that if these children were not born in my

08:11.960 --> 08:13.770
family, what would have happened to them?

08:13.770 --> 08:19.230
They don’t like to hear any funny songs
– nothing.

08:19.230 --> 08:23.840
Once, early in the morning, my daughter was
playing some ghazals.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.230
so she got up and came in the room.

08:28.230 --> 08:29.230
She said, “What’s this going on, early
in the morning, crying, crying?

08:29.230 --> 08:30.230
What is this?”

08:30.230 --> 08:31.230
So I said, “This is ghazal."

08:31.230 --> 08:36.940
“What a puzzle, early in the morning, to
make everyone weep!”

08:36.940 --> 08:41.830
You see, these Lucknow people and all those
are very ghazalias: only in the mind.

08:41.830 --> 08:48.640
They never love their wives, never do anything
for them, but they are romantic type.

08:48.640 --> 08:52.950
And these girls know about it.

08:52.950 --> 08:53.990
“And we Lucknowas.

08:53.990 --> 08:56.070
We don’t want to marry these!

08:56.070 --> 09:01.910
They’re just romancing in their heads and
they don’t love their wives and the wives

09:01.910 --> 09:04.110
also don’t love."

09:04.110 --> 09:05.110
So this is what it is.

09:05.110 --> 09:08.680
I mean, they are so mature.

09:08.680 --> 09:16.210
These two were studying in Patna and they
had only one chappal (sandal) left with them,

09:16.210 --> 09:17.520
which was half broken.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.800
So I told, “All right, come along with me
to Delhi.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.660
I’ll buy good chappals for you."

09:22.660 --> 09:23.960
I took them there.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.550
They wouldn’t buy another one.

09:26.550 --> 09:27.820
“One chappal is only.

09:27.820 --> 09:29.680
One chappal and one chappal."

09:29.680 --> 09:32.980
I said, “Why you have come all the way just
to buy only one chappal?”

09:32.980 --> 09:36.220
“Yes, when this will break we will buy another
one."

09:36.220 --> 09:37.220
And the clothes?

09:37.220 --> 09:38.220
Nothing!

09:38.220 --> 09:39.540
I forced on them their clothes.

09:39.540 --> 09:40.540
They wouldn’t take it.

09:40.540 --> 09:41.540
They said, “No, no, no, no!

09:41.540 --> 09:42.540
There’s no need to spend.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.630
Why do you want to spend?

09:44.630 --> 09:47.940
Already we have got so much loan on our head,
of our parents.

09:47.940 --> 09:54.529
And why do you want to spend more money?”

09:54.529 --> 09:55.529
Even grandson.

09:55.529 --> 09:57.840
He said, “My school is so bad!

09:57.840 --> 09:59.240
All the girls want to talk to me."

09:59.240 --> 10:02.010
And now he’s head of the class, school also.

10:02.010 --> 10:05.060
They’re so wise, so sensible.

10:05.060 --> 10:12.110
And it’s an example, before you to see that
your children don’t take to stupid things

10:12.110 --> 10:15.140
of so called romance and all that.

10:15.140 --> 10:20.500
They don’t believe in all that.

10:20.500 --> 10:27.110
Today I have to tell you because I have got
reports of some girls who have been misbehaving,

10:27.110 --> 10:28.310
sitting before the [mirror].

10:28.310 --> 10:29.310
Why?

10:29.310 --> 10:30.310
Why so much?

10:30.310 --> 10:37.570
And I don’t know, I can’t face mirror
for more than for two minutes at the most.

10:37.570 --> 10:42.420
Not because I think I have something wrong
with me, but the vibrations start hitting

10:42.420 --> 10:46.730
me!

10:46.730 --> 10:50.700
I don’t know how I look or what.

10:50.700 --> 10:54.200
Why should you worry so much?

10:54.200 --> 10:58.580
We should be confident, have self-respect.

10:58.580 --> 11:03.680
All is accepted, dirty, filthy, from the West.

11:03.680 --> 11:08.130
And in Sanskrit, as you know I have told you,
they were called as mlecchas.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.860
Mleccha: mala-iccha.

11:09.860 --> 11:15.050
They want all dirt and filth, that’s what.

11:15.050 --> 11:18.730
Iccha is the desire; and they take to it.

11:18.730 --> 11:22.070
Even in the Muslim culture that is there,
that’s why in Lucknow and all that, I used

11:22.070 --> 11:26.070
to get suffocated the way people were romantic.

11:26.070 --> 11:27.070
No sense of proportion.

11:27.070 --> 11:30.310
But, thank God now, Lucknow has changed so
much.

11:30.310 --> 11:35.589
I am really amazed how these people just looking
at women: every woman they must see, turn

11:35.589 --> 11:36.589
their head at every woman.

11:36.589 --> 11:41.630
I mean, their necks might break one day.

11:41.630 --> 11:44.090
But in the West, I have seen, all women look
at the men!

11:44.090 --> 11:49.280
First I didn’t understand what is going
on.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.920
All the time like this, like this, like this.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.670
And then they end up in a lunatic asylum.

11:54.670 --> 11:56.220
What will happen otherwise also?

11:56.220 --> 11:58.260
We are Sahaja Yogis.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.770
We have our own traditions.

12:00.770 --> 12:03.370
We are people of very high families.

12:03.370 --> 12:06.870
Why should we take to these dirty things?

12:06.870 --> 12:12.170
So I would request you to tell your children
not to be impressed by this dirty, horrible

12:12.170 --> 12:13.370
culture that has evolved.

12:13.370 --> 12:15.240
It was not so bad in the West.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.450
I tell you, it was not.

12:16.450 --> 12:26.920
It is now ruined; the whole place They have
no idea as to how filthy it has become.

12:26.920 --> 12:37.370
If you are real Sahaja Yogis, you will be
very quiet, unassuming, dignified, mature,

12:37.370 --> 12:41.839
as well as you will be very moral.

12:41.839 --> 12:43.120
You have to be very [moral].

12:43.120 --> 12:49.520
And you should only like people who are moral.

12:49.520 --> 13:00.160
This is not to be taught, but to be shown
to the children, how you yourself live.

13:00.160 --> 13:09.490
If the mother is all the time busy with her
beauty and this and that, the child also takes

13:09.490 --> 13:10.490
it.

13:10.490 --> 13:25.180
All this filth and dirt should not settle
down, at least in Sahaja Yoga.

13:25.180 --> 13:30.210
This is what today I wanted to tell you: [about]
these people, really I got worried.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.300
They have no sense of music.

13:31.300 --> 13:32.740
They don’t understand music.

13:32.740 --> 13:35.570
They have no sense of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

13:35.570 --> 13:42.070
They are supposed to be your children!

13:42.070 --> 13:49.100
Tomorrow the same children will definitely
cleanse the whole world, but what is your

13:49.100 --> 13:50.100
attention is?

13:50.100 --> 13:53.402
You are giving money to them to do what they
like.

13:53.402 --> 13:57.750
You are not putting your any attention.

13:57.750 --> 14:00.920
Parents are there to correct their children.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.550
They have to.

14:02.550 --> 14:06.700
And if they argue, give them two tight slaps
and they will be all right.

14:06.700 --> 14:09.920
In the West, also, the children are horrible,
absolutely horrible children.

14:09.920 --> 14:13.709
They’ll go on asking you questions, “Why?

14:13.709 --> 14:14.709
Why?”

14:14.709 --> 14:17.110
Once I was travelling with a child like that
and the mother said, “What to do with this

14:17.110 --> 14:18.110
child?”

14:18.110 --> 14:20.720
I said, “You ask him: ‘Yesterday what
I answered, do you remember that?

14:20.720 --> 14:23.220
Tell me what I answered you!’

14:23.220 --> 14:25.800
” Since that day he stopped [asking] ‘why’.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.350
Children shouldn’t talk so much.

14:27.350 --> 14:31.620
They have no understanding of anything, still
little babies.

14:31.620 --> 14:35.029
How are they to talk, as if they are wisdom
personified?

14:35.029 --> 14:38.080
This is all Western new method of educating
their children.

14:38.080 --> 14:40.160
“Let them be what they want, they are free.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.160
So what?”

14:41.160 --> 14:48.089
With this method, no artist has been produced,
no musician has been produced, no composer

14:48.089 --> 14:49.140
has been produced.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.240
The whole quality has gone down.

14:51.240 --> 14:58.820
First you need some discipline in life to
become something.

14:58.820 --> 15:04.030
But also it’s very money-oriented in the
West, that if the boy has to clean the car,

15:04.030 --> 15:06.650
you pay him £2.

15:06.650 --> 15:10.589
No Sahaja Yogi should do that.

15:10.589 --> 15:12.630
He has to do that.

15:12.630 --> 15:15.220
He sits in the car, so why shouldn’t he
clean it?

15:15.220 --> 15:19.029
He should feel, “This is my responsibility."

15:19.029 --> 15:26.180
And a very big problem you will face if your
children turn out to be such horrible ones.

15:26.180 --> 15:31.950
Of course, I am trying to make a school here
for the Sahaj children, but the parents should

15:31.950 --> 15:33.209
not spoil them.

15:33.209 --> 15:35.110
Same with the western people.

15:35.110 --> 15:38.690
Now they have got their children, they are
so attached to their children.

15:38.690 --> 15:42.480
They think it is their own property, they
can do what they like with them.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.640
We made the school.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.100
We paid for the school.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.510
We collected everything, did all that.

15:47.510 --> 15:51.900
They are very nicely coming here to take away
their children to their own countries.

15:51.900 --> 15:57.250
They cannot think even that they are Sahaja
Yogis [and] they have to be in Ganapatipule

15:57.250 --> 15:58.250
[even] if you are not.

15:58.250 --> 16:05.220
They are not going to be like you that, for
some time, take all advantage of Sahaja Yoga

16:05.220 --> 16:13.320
and then just become the same stupid fools.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.300
So they decided to take away their children,
this, that.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.751
I told Yogi, “Why are you sending the children
[home]?”

16:18.751 --> 16:20.130
He said, “The parents are…”

16:20.130 --> 16:24.100
Who are the parents?

16:24.100 --> 16:28.070
Who are the parents?

16:28.070 --> 16:30.550
So this idea should not be there.

16:30.550 --> 16:33.269
Children are to be involved in the main stream.

16:33.269 --> 16:34.990
They should be in the main stream.

16:34.990 --> 16:36.360
They should be here.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.861
Otherwise, we have nothing to do with you
and your children.

16:38.861 --> 16:39.861
Get out!

16:39.861 --> 16:43.670
Now, I have to take a strong view of the whole
thing.

16:43.670 --> 16:48.190
I find, specially in Australia, they are becoming
extremely secluded people.

16:48.190 --> 16:53.500
Some of them are having, in the ashram, their
own rooms, their own television, their own

16:53.500 --> 16:55.010
this thing, their own cooking.

16:55.010 --> 16:56.590
This own business has to go away.

16:56.590 --> 17:00.710
Throw away all such people from the ashrams.

17:00.710 --> 17:03.310
I am surprised at Australians!

17:03.310 --> 17:12.630
They got out of the jail and again want to
go into the same jail.

17:12.630 --> 17:19.650
Next time all the children have to come to
Ganapatipule; next time, and nobody has to

17:19.650 --> 17:20.980
[say], “We have booked their seats.

17:20.980 --> 17:22.100
We have done that."

17:22.100 --> 17:23.100
I told them, “Put them into trouble.

17:23.100 --> 17:24.100
Tell them we can’t send the children.

17:24.100 --> 17:27.670
Let them pay for that then they will understand."

17:27.670 --> 17:38.690
Now the last, and not the least, is the way
still we are attached to money.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.660
Sahaja Yoga is free, agreed.

17:41.660 --> 17:43.370
Your Realisation is free.

17:43.370 --> 17:54.110
But this time, can you believe, [on] the sixteenth
of November, I telephoned from Russia to find

17:54.110 --> 17:58.890
out how much money was collected and there
was very little money there.

17:58.890 --> 18:04.030
And such a big programme, such a difficult
programme and such an expensive programme

18:04.030 --> 18:05.429
we had done.

18:05.429 --> 18:08.299
At the right time they let me down!

18:08.299 --> 18:10.540
So I had to borrow money to have this programme.

18:10.540 --> 18:11.540
Can you believe it?

18:11.540 --> 18:20.480
They don’t feel responsible that they’re
troubling Mother like this!

18:20.480 --> 18:23.890
I was not sure how many are coming, how many
are not coming.

18:23.890 --> 18:28.680
First they said only two hundred coming, then
three hundred are coming, then I heard there

18:28.680 --> 18:30.580
were six hundred!

18:30.580 --> 18:43.470
Have you got a big bank account here that
you can just do what you like?

18:43.470 --> 18:46.280
So they are not responsible.

18:46.280 --> 18:57.600
Next time if you do not pay money till the
end of October, you are out of the tour!

18:57.600 --> 18:59.679
Anywhere!

18:59.679 --> 19:06.460
I cannot go on borrowing money like this every
time.

19:06.460 --> 19:09.890
And then I have to return that money to my
husband.

19:09.890 --> 19:15.170
It’s a fact!

19:15.170 --> 19:18.690
Everybody knows.

19:18.690 --> 19:28.770
[In] money matters, also, we have not yet
been able to be real Sahaja Yogis.

19:28.770 --> 19:35.240
Now, this Shyamji, has bought these saris
on a little concession and he thought that

19:35.240 --> 19:38.620
he will sell those and whatever concession
he gets it, he will give to Sahaja Yoga.

19:38.620 --> 19:42.800
He’s a very honest man.

19:42.800 --> 19:48.890
But because some saris were a little less
in price they were not [sold by] Sahaj Yogis,

19:48.890 --> 19:53.700
nothing, and they were artificial saris, people
went and bought saris from him.

19:53.700 --> 19:56.090
And none of them bought saris from Shyamji.

19:56.090 --> 20:02.230
They are very vain type.

20:02.230 --> 20:06.860
Whatever is the little profit that he will
have, he gives it to me.

20:06.860 --> 20:09.179
We have so much extra expenses.

20:09.179 --> 20:15.280
You have no idea!

20:15.280 --> 20:16.290
Same about presents.

20:16.290 --> 20:20.840
The money, you people, you gave me about the
presents, also, is so delayed.

20:20.840 --> 20:29.840
Just now we have taken thirty-five thousand
pounds, extra, for the musicians, which is

20:29.840 --> 20:31.250
not yet paid back.

20:31.250 --> 20:36.600
Here are [the] people, you can ask them, they
are dealing in the bank.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.860
I have paid for this Chindwada house, four
lakhs of rupees already, not a single pie

20:40.860 --> 20:43.929
(1/192 rupee) has been given so far, paid
for.

20:43.929 --> 20:48.010
We have to do so many things.

20:48.010 --> 20:49.900
But so many Sahaja Yogis there are.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.570
I tell them all, “Don’t give me any presents.

20:51.570 --> 20:54.270
I don’t want any presents from you."

20:54.270 --> 20:57.270
But you must pay for all these expenses which
are incurred.

20:57.270 --> 21:02.920
Today is the first day I am talking about
it, because this time you really put me out

21:02.920 --> 21:04.280
completely.

21:04.280 --> 21:08.390
Absolutely, I was.

21:08.390 --> 21:12.760
I didn’t know what will I do.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.929
I never borrow money.

21:14.929 --> 21:23.900
Partly I got from Italy and partly I borrowed:
Partly, quite a lot.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.860
After all, everything needs money, you must
understand.

21:26.860 --> 21:33.340
So, you see, next time if you do all these
things I’ll cancel the tours.

21:33.340 --> 21:41.640
Please, by the end of October, remember all
your money should be there.

21:41.640 --> 21:49.230
It’s not proper to say all these things
to you, I know, but you should also know what

21:49.230 --> 21:51.330
trouble I am going through.

21:51.330 --> 21:52.330
For doing what?

21:52.330 --> 21:55.760
For your Realisation, for your tours, for
your everything.

21:55.760 --> 22:02.040
I don’t need Sahaja Yoga do I?

22:02.040 --> 22:16.100
Also, the last thing is this, as I have said,
money is needed just now, but maybe, might

22:16.100 --> 22:22.169
be, something might [be] worked out when you
won’t need so much money; may.

22:22.169 --> 22:32.620
It will only work out if you people are sincere.

22:32.620 --> 22:34.160
So many things are to be done here, also.

22:34.160 --> 22:37.049
Of course, I have given a lot of money here.

22:37.049 --> 22:42.299
In these four years, I have been able to save
a lot of money, I must say; compared to previous

22:42.299 --> 22:46.170
years when you people were managing the money.

22:46.170 --> 22:47.170
Since then I have saved.

22:47.170 --> 22:50.200
Because money doesn’t have legs to walk
out!

22:50.200 --> 22:55.800
If you don’t spend, it is there!

22:55.800 --> 22:59.540
“My children, my wife, my house, my everything."

22:59.540 --> 23:06.980
What about “my Sahaj Yoga”?

23:06.980 --> 23:18.380
It’s your responsibility now: you need it,
your family needs it, your country needs it.

23:18.380 --> 23:19.660
Everybody needs it.

23:19.660 --> 23:22.799
So it is your responsibility.

23:22.799 --> 23:29.010
Please understand that you have got Sahaja
Yoga because you are special people.

23:29.010 --> 23:33.880
But the speciality is that you are responsible
for the whole world.

23:33.880 --> 23:38.740
Spreading Sahaja Yoga is all right, but to
be responsible.

23:38.740 --> 23:49.730
On the whole, of course, it has been really
a very good working out, I agree, but still

23:49.730 --> 23:58.870
these are things that are missing which must
be somehow or other corrected: by the leaders,

23:58.870 --> 24:03.360
by the world leaders, and coordinated.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.580
It should be done.

24:05.580 --> 24:08.049
After all, you know my age now.

24:08.049 --> 24:10.900
You don’t want to trouble me.

24:10.900 --> 24:18.059
This is the only kindness I need: not to go
on postponing things, not to go on being irresponsible,

24:18.059 --> 24:19.570
that’s all!

24:19.570 --> 24:24.049
I have been telling you for the last fifteen
years [that] I don’t want any presents!

24:24.049 --> 24:27.470
For presents, for saris, everybody’s anxious.

24:27.470 --> 24:32.960
Now this time every country wanted to give
me [a] sari.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.179
Just imagine!

24:34.179 --> 24:36.620
I don’t need that.

24:36.620 --> 24:42.110
I don’t know what I will do with it.

24:42.110 --> 24:49.190
But full attention to yourself and to the
collective work and to the global work.

24:49.190 --> 24:56.580
If I stop this work, it’s very easy, but
you don’t want that.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.390
Even few are coming, whatever it is.

24:59.390 --> 25:01.930
Definitely you tell me [that] so many are
coming – finished!

25:01.930 --> 25:06.910
It’s hardly two, three years more, at the
most it will continue.

25:06.910 --> 25:10.299
It cannot go on forever.

25:10.299 --> 25:17.100
We’ll have to think of something else.

25:17.100 --> 25:26.020
And my own style is that, whatever you give
for my pujas, I keep it for Sahaja Yoga only:

25:26.020 --> 25:31.440
for the buying of silver, this, that.

25:31.440 --> 25:35.580
So much of silver I have given, so much gold
that is here is my own.

25:35.580 --> 25:37.850
Everything, most of the ornaments are my own.

25:37.850 --> 25:42.470
Now what else I should do?

25:42.470 --> 25:49.370
Not that I want anything from you, but you
should be responsible and understand.

25:49.370 --> 25:51.210
All of you should, please.

25:51.210 --> 25:56.020
If you can really think that this is so important.

25:56.020 --> 26:01.220
Twelve disciples of Christ worked out Christianity
– only twelve.

26:01.220 --> 26:07.760
And they were fishermen: how they did it!

26:07.760 --> 26:16.000
All right, so everybody is telling me that,
“Mother you must talk to them and tell them

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
about it."

26:17.000 --> 26:18.460
So I have told you.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.289
I have done my job.

26:20.289 --> 26:26.480
Now it is for you to think what is good and
what should be done.

26:26.480 --> 26:32.740
Sahaja Yoga is your own: is for your children,
is for your family, is for the country, not

26:32.740 --> 26:34.930
only [that, but] for the whole world, where
you live.

26:34.930 --> 26:37.450
You are such a great people who are realised-souls.

26:37.450 --> 26:43.470
Where are the realised-souls here?

26:43.470 --> 28:52.250
So have self-esteem, then you will feel responsible,
you know, “I am responsible."

28:52.250 --> 28:59.919
Thank you very much.

28:59.919 --> 29:10.779
May God bless you.
