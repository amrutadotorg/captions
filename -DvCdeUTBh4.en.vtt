00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:09.554
So you, once you are in thoughtless awareness what happens

00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:11.874
that no thoughts bombard your mind.

00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:16.834
Wherever you may be, you may be
in America, you may be in any place.

00:00:16.914 --> 00:00:21.074
You are not bombarded by thoughts.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:28.674
So, what does that mean? Into very simple language we can say,

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:32.434
it means that you do not reflect.

00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:35.834
You do not have a reflecting mind.

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:42.554
Now this is the basic problem of Sahaja Yogis of today,

00:00:42.634 --> 00:00:45.674
which one should try to conquer.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:50.394
That you do not reflect.

00:00:50.474 --> 00:00:54.234
That's the only way you can achieve your steadiness.

00:00:54.314 --> 00:00:58.034
For example I have seen people,

00:00:58.114 --> 00:01:01.594
for nothing at all they'll just start laughing,

00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:04.834
nothing at all.

00:01:04.914 --> 00:01:08.994
They see somebody, immediately they react

00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:13.154
"This was nice but not so good."

00:01:13.234 --> 00:01:17.954
They start giving their opinions,
especially in the West, about everything.

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:20.194
Everybody seems to be very knowledgeable

00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:26.074
and start telling what is best

00:01:26.154 --> 00:01:29.954
and what is not the best, what is not good.

00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:34.554
And once they start saying something like that,

00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:37.554
mind becomes reflective.

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:41.594
If the mind is not reflective, then
you are thoughtless awareness.

00:01:41.674 --> 00:01:44.314
Watch anything, just you watch.

00:01:44.394 --> 00:01:47.754
Just witness. You should not reflect.

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:54.914
If you are using your mental power, then this power subsides.

00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:58.954
This is a very common defect with people because,

00:01:59.034 --> 00:02:01.274
I think, you people

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:04.875
are more intelligent, you think. Maybe

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:08.950
I think, you are well educated, might
be. I don't know, whatever you think.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.034
But this reflecting mind

00:02:11.114 --> 00:02:14.474
is a very dangerous thing for spirituality.

00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:19.074
You'll never grow. And then with the reflecting mind,

00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:25.314
you have different emotions with
something you reflect on somebody.

00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:31.994
Now if it's your son or daughter
or something, you get identified.

00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:36.154
Identification with some is artificial.

00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:38.274
It's not in reality.

00:02:38.354 --> 00:02:43.074
But because this mind reflects, it identifies.

00:02:43.154 --> 00:02:45.754
Now many identifications you have dropped out.

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:48.674
For example your bias about religion,

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:51.394
about races,

00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:54.914
about maybe nationalities, you have dropped out.

00:02:54.994 --> 00:02:59.514
But still I would say, the reflecting mind still acts

00:02:59.594 --> 00:03:05.074
and this is the greatest hurdle for
the progress of Sahaja Yogis of today.

00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:09.034
I've been thinking "Why is it the reflecting mind

00:03:09.114 --> 00:03:15.154
is so active in Sahaja Yogis of today?"

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:17.514
If you could stop reflecting,

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:21.354
immediately you establish yourself

00:03:21.434 --> 00:03:25.154
in the ocean of peace.

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:30.114
You watch something, just watch.

00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:33.914
There's no ripple of thought in your mind.

00:03:33.994 --> 00:03:37.194
Then you become extremely creative.

00:03:37.274 --> 00:03:39.874
You become extremely dynamic,

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:42.434
you become extremely compassionate.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.314
You have no fear.

00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:46.994
Some people think, "If you are compassionate

00:03:47.074 --> 00:03:50.794
you see this man might lynch me". You have no fear.

00:03:50.874 --> 00:03:54.194
All virtues that you have to enjoy

00:03:54.274 --> 00:03:55.914
you can only enjoy

00:03:55.994 --> 00:03:59.434
when you do not reflect.

00:03:59.514 --> 00:04:04.314
That means that you leave everything to the Divine.

00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:06.994
You are not in charge.

00:04:07.074 --> 00:04:13.994
You don't see that you have to be reflecting on something.

00:04:14.074 --> 00:04:19.474
This is the greatest power you have got, is not to reflect,

00:04:19.554 --> 00:04:23.394
not to look at somebody with that kind of thing.

00:04:23.474 --> 00:04:26.554
I have seen this is still there lingering.

00:04:26.634 --> 00:04:29.994
Perhaps I never told you about it, maybe one of the reasons.

00:04:30.074 --> 00:04:36.314
I don't say that it's only your fault but maybe Mine,

00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:40.834
because I couldn't find what was exactly wrong,

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:47.994
that is the reflection that you have about others.

00:04:48.074 --> 00:04:52.554
Now I told you, have introspection.

00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:57.954
For introspection also it can be reflection,

00:04:58.034 --> 00:05:02.074
but that at least gives you idea as to where you are.

00:05:02.154 --> 00:05:07.394
But with that psychologically you can become extremely depressed.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:10.074
You can condemn yourself.

00:05:10.154 --> 00:05:12.594
Then you may not understand yourself

00:05:12.674 --> 00:05:16.354
as a personality that you are

00:05:16.434 --> 00:05:20.394
and you'll go on, sort of,

00:05:20.474 --> 00:05:23.754
losing your vibrations, losing your power.

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:28.634
Because you are not control of yourself.

00:05:28.714 --> 00:05:32.874
So introspection, also, if it brings

00:05:32.954 --> 00:05:36.994
about depression and demeaning of your personality,

00:05:37.074 --> 00:05:39.394
best is not to introspect also.

00:05:39.474 --> 00:05:44.314
Because all these mental activities,
I have seen, create problems.

00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:51.074
But in a state where you are thoughtlessly aware,

00:05:51.154 --> 00:05:54.554
introspection comes to you automatically.

00:05:54.634 --> 00:05:56.794
You see it automatically.

00:05:56.874 --> 00:06:02.914
You understand it automatically. You do not think about it,

00:06:02.994 --> 00:06:09.994
it just comes to you. The whole picture comes to you

00:06:10.074 --> 00:06:13.274
and you are at peace with yourself.

00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:15.754
You are never in turmoil,

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:17.554
never in trouble.

00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:19.554
Then you don't get angry.

00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:21.354
Then you do not argue,

00:06:21.434 --> 00:06:23.074
then you do not discuss,

00:06:23.154 --> 00:06:31.234
but you become as if dropped in to the ocean of awareness

00:06:31.314 --> 00:06:36.194
and you don't have to worry

00:06:36.274 --> 00:06:38.914
as to solve something.

00:06:38.994 --> 00:06:42.514
When you are reflecting,

00:06:42.594 --> 00:06:45.554
then you find that this power works.

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:50.914
Now it becomes very contradictory to say that you have to project

00:06:50.994 --> 00:06:54.354
and you don't have to reflect.

00:06:54.434 --> 00:06:59.234
Now when we reflect we absorb.

00:06:59.314 --> 00:07:03.514
When we reflect on something, we absorb that thing.

00:07:03.594 --> 00:07:06.874
And mostly our attention goes to the defects of others,

00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:09.794
"This person is no good, that is not good, this is,

00:07:09.874 --> 00:07:13.154
her hair is not all right, the sari's not all right."

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:16.554
This, that and all nonsense.

00:07:16.634 --> 00:07:21.594
So what are we doing, we are absorbing all the bad things also.

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:27.194
Now when you start admiration of something.

00:07:27.274 --> 00:07:32.754
Then what happens that you may not get the bad things

00:07:32.834 --> 00:07:35.994
but at least you are on a better line.

00:07:36.074 --> 00:07:40.714
But still, the admiration in thoughtless awareness

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.554
is really very deep.

00:07:42.634 --> 00:07:46.754
I saw this in the eyes of this great scientist.

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:50.554
Absolutely he was just one with Me,

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:57.034
and his eyes were like an ocean of peace.

00:07:57.114 --> 00:08:00.754
He was just looking at Me,

00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:06.394
and for quite some time and then he came to his thoughts

00:08:06.474 --> 00:08:10.914
and he told Me that "This is what
we can do with Your photograph."

00:08:10.994 --> 00:08:16.754
So the depth in you will only come when you do not reflect.

00:08:16.834 --> 00:08:20.154
But it's very common with human beings, specially in the West,

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:23.314
"this carpet is no good, that is no good,

00:08:23.394 --> 00:08:25.634
this smell is coming, that is there,"

00:08:25.714 --> 00:08:30.394
always trying to judge others,

00:08:30.474 --> 00:08:32.594
judge other things.

00:08:32.674 --> 00:08:36.154
This is important? What is so important?

00:08:36.234 --> 00:08:39.354
If you are sitting in the garden of heavens

00:08:39.434 --> 00:08:45.434
what does it matter where you are sitting, what you are doing?

00:08:45.514 --> 00:08:53.234
This sets in, this reflection, sets
in waves of thoughts in our mind.

00:08:53.314 --> 00:08:57.154
I have already, once, described it by drawing.

00:08:57.234 --> 00:09:02.634
How the energy that falls on the right side

00:09:02.714 --> 00:09:04.154
goes to the left side

00:09:04.234 --> 00:09:06.994
and the falls on the left goes to the right.

00:09:07.074 --> 00:09:14.674
Crosses over because of two types of cells we have.

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.474
Then out of this energy that goes to the right,

00:09:17.554 --> 00:09:20.474
the energy that goes to the left

00:09:20.554 --> 00:09:24.394
it is sucked in partly into the sympathetic.

00:09:24.474 --> 00:09:30.554
Now whatever is left out is the one that reflects.

00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:33.914
That is the way it goes on reflecting.

00:09:33.994 --> 00:09:38.674
Now if you can suck in all that
energy and put it on our sympathetic,

00:09:38.754 --> 00:09:43.849
then all our energies will be thousand fold much more.

00:09:43.929 --> 00:09:52.704
We’ll not be tired, we’ll not be unhappy,
we’ll be able to stand lots of nonsense.

00:09:52.784 --> 00:10:00.741
But we’ll not call it a nonsense, we’ll not
think it’s a bad thing, so it has no effect on us.

00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:03.892
This quality we have to develop.

00:10:03.972 --> 00:10:11.623
I would say with this, today’s special celebration of Navaratri.

00:10:11.703 --> 00:10:18.712
Like yesterday you saw the Durga’s nine forms also.

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:23.485
In that is one is Kushmanda as this was told,

00:10:23.565 --> 00:10:28.697
that you absorb all the filth within yourself, in your stomach.

00:10:28.777 --> 00:10:32.523
But Devi does that, not you.

00:10:32.603 --> 00:10:35.311
What a Devi can do, you should not do.

00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:40.822
That’s Her job, that She’s supposed to do these things, not you.

00:10:40.902 --> 00:10:47.583
What you have to do is to only be in silence

00:10:47.663 --> 00:10:52.413
so that you absorb whatever will increase that silence,

00:10:52.493 --> 00:10:55.161
will increase your depth.

00:10:55.241 --> 00:10:58.406
Devi will look after all the other, rest of the things.

00:10:58.486 --> 00:11:05.795
She will look after the, all the
filth, all the anger, all the temper,

00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:08.743
all the everything that’s going on in this world.

00:11:08.823 --> 00:11:18.176
She will absorb all that, but what you have
to do is to just enjoy everything that is pure.

00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:22.917
Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond your mind.

00:11:22.997 --> 00:11:26.927
With your mind you can never enjoy, it’s like a big load.

00:11:27.007 --> 00:11:29.461
It will not act, it will not help.

00:11:29.541 --> 00:11:38.278
Enjoyment comes when you are in
complete silence, in a rippleless lake.

00:11:38.358 --> 00:11:44.064
The reflection of all the joy that is
created on the shores of that lake

00:11:44.144 --> 00:11:47.608
are completely reflected, they are not deflected.

00:11:47.688 --> 00:11:52.315
If there were ripples it would have
been a different image altogether

00:11:52.395 --> 00:11:59.567
and would have been something nowhere near the image of reality.

00:11:59.647 --> 00:12:08.098
So one must have a mind which is kept lower than reality.

00:12:08.178 --> 00:12:14.868
In the reality actually it is nothing but peace and joy.

00:12:14.948 --> 00:12:21.412
Now a mother’s desire is always that
children should have nothing but peace and joy,

00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:27.898
no sufferings, no starvation, no ordeals, nothing.

00:12:27.978 --> 00:12:31.238
They must just enjoy.

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:34.316
Now those days are gone.

00:12:34.396 --> 00:12:42.367
But even to enjoy this, even to
live in that complete peaceful state

00:12:42.447 --> 00:12:45.447
you have to be non-reflecting.

00:12:45.527 --> 00:12:58.109
Now you watch yourself, you’ll be
amazed how much reflecting you are.
