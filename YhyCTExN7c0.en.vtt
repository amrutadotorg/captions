00:05.117 --> 00:11.027
“TIME HAS COME TO BECOME THE SPIRIT”

00:15.128 --> 00:28.753
We are here to inform you about a power
which is within us

00:28.954 --> 00:36.031
and the power that can give you what is
promised by all the saints,

00:36.232 --> 00:41.365
scriptures and all the incarnations.

00:42.458 --> 00:49.797
Today when you see the young people
in every country - especially in the west –

00:51.692 --> 00:56.941
you’ll find they are not satisfied

00:57.225 --> 01:03.464
with their own atmosphere, their lives

01:06.692 --> 01:10.850
and they think there is something missing

01:14.392 --> 01:18.746
and they are extremely confused.

01:23.065 --> 01:30.610
Now when they are confused they are seeking
for something beyond,

01:30.811 --> 01:34.351
something unknown to them.

01:36.638 --> 01:44.099
In that seeking, they may take to anything
extreme,

01:47.100 --> 01:49.219
drugs,

01:52.542 --> 01:55.266
could be alcoholism,

02:01.163 --> 02:08.979
or some other perversions which cause
horrible diseases, incurable diseases.

02:22.683 --> 02:26.676
Instead of condemning them

02:26.868 --> 02:34.530
we have to see why they are doing all these
things, what is the purpose.

02:41.059 --> 02:46.761
Also, some of them went to some gurus

02:49.389 --> 02:52.259
which are in the market.

03:02.470 --> 03:07.076
Especially when they see the religious
people and the religions,

03:07.277 --> 03:15.639
they cannot believe that religion can give
such horrid experiences

03:22.119 --> 03:30.306
and some of them are anti-God,
anti-religion also.

03:39.518 --> 03:44.661
But if you deal with the problems
sympathetically, you cannot blame them,

03:44.862 --> 03:50.719
because they are intelligent, aware people.

04:01.711 --> 04:04.844
So now we have two category of people,

04:05.045 --> 04:11.359
one: the ones who are not seeking at all,

04:17.732 --> 04:28.714
and another are the ones who want to find
out solutions of the problems.

04:38.088 --> 04:45.245
In every generation we had people who
revolutionised

04:45.446 --> 04:48.436
because they did not like a particular
system,

04:48.637 --> 04:54.744
or did not like a particular style of life,
whatever it was.

04:56.545 --> 05:01.378
But now the revolution has to come from
within.

05:02.024 --> 05:06.492
We have to evolve from within,

05:18.801 --> 05:23.695
because the destruction is also coming from
within.

05:23.896 --> 05:28.316
We are destroying ourselves more from
within.

05:28.517 --> 05:34.145
Because we are so unhappy, so confused,

05:34.460 --> 05:41.127
absolutely “quite a percentage” is
schizophrenic.

05:42.183 --> 05:49.510
So then we start seeking the solution

05:50.249 --> 05:55.204
and in that seeking we make mistakes.

06:03.243 --> 06:10.912
And we make mistakes because we do not
know what to seek

06:16.497 --> 06:19.760
and how to find,

06:23.300 --> 06:27.890
also how to evolve to that state.

06:36.489 --> 06:43.575
So logically we have to reach some
conclusions, logically;

06:43.776 --> 06:49.712
that it has to be some evolutionary
happening.

06:49.913 --> 06:57.570
This is logical, to transform ourselves,
there has to be some evolution.

06:57.960 --> 07:05.455
So, like Jung has said, that you have
to become collectively conscious.

07:05.656 --> 07:10.211
You have to become, it’s an actualization,
it is not just a certificate.

07:10.412 --> 07:15.763
It has to become from within, it’s
an honest thing, it’s an innate thing.

07:15.964 --> 07:17.985
It is not just a preaching

07:18.186 --> 07:24.296
or sort of a giving a certificate - it is
not - or taking a name.

07:24.601 --> 07:29.381
It is actualization within yourself,

07:30.545 --> 07:36.759
so that something has to happen to us.

07:38.865 --> 07:46.877
Now as we have evolved from monkey stage
to this stage, for example,

07:47.078 --> 07:52.420
we’ve done nothing, it is a living process

07:57.986 --> 08:02.204
which has taken place spontaneously.

08:14.730 --> 08:27.949
There’s a big resistance to any oriental
ideas being accepted in the West,

08:28.150 --> 08:30.114
big resistance.

08:30.315 --> 08:36.522
I find there’s a very big resistance
for any oriental ideas

08:40.443 --> 08:43.494
coming to the West.

08:51.279 --> 08:56.686
Now these oriental ideas which are coming

08:57.680 --> 09:02.870
are to be seen with a scientific open mind

09:11.300 --> 09:20.192
because the Western life has grown like
a tree outside,

09:20.393 --> 09:24.659
but the roots may be in the East,

09:28.128 --> 09:35.278
maybe we can keep ourselves open to see
where are the roots.

09:46.458 --> 09:51.094
Now if the roots are in the East,
supposing, it’s an hypothesis,

09:51.295 --> 09:58.247
so let us have a look at it, if there is
any solution in those.

09:59.087 --> 10:03.228
So you go to oriental ideas.

10:03.751 --> 10:09.565
But there also is very dangerous, because
you are going in the unknown,

10:09.766 --> 10:16.217
you might go to false gurus, you might go
to wrong people

10:18.490 --> 10:21.804
and get completely destroyed.

10:22.049 --> 10:30.645
So, what do we do? First thing we should
know, we cannot pay for our evolution,

10:30.846 --> 10:35.127
we cannot pay, money is not there.

10:46.522 --> 10:53.840
Nor can we pay for any living process.
Any living process we cannot pay.

10:55.643 --> 11:00.079
Like, if the seed has to sprout, the Mother
Earth will sprout it,

11:00.280 --> 11:03.701
we don’t pay the Mother Earth.

11:04.437 --> 11:12.511
Alright. So first thing they should have
known that anybody who asks for money

11:12.712 --> 11:18.747
is not a truthful person. No money should
be involved.

11:20.352 --> 11:25.020
Then the second point comes in, that we got

11:25.221 --> 11:31.645
to this stage of human awareness
spontaneously,

11:33.422 --> 11:37.314
without any effort, effortlessly.

11:41.290 --> 11:45.232
In the same way it should happen.

11:52.207 --> 11:58.852
But first of all in every evolution there
has been one leader.

12:08.717 --> 12:11.895
We can call them as archetypes as they say,
or whatever you may say -

12:12.096 --> 12:19.414
want to say, though Jung was not very clear
on that point.

12:21.608 --> 12:29.131
So now such a person can decode
the information

12:29.332 --> 12:34.813
of symbols and everything and can help
others,

12:35.022 --> 12:43.100
without taking any money, without taking
any gratification; can do it.

12:43.301 --> 12:50.762
And here it is that people fumble
in the West,

12:50.963 --> 12:56.538
they don’t mind a pope, they don’t mind
an archbishop of Canterbury,

12:56.739 --> 13:03.986
but they do mind a person who is doing
everything free, just out of love.

13:09.552 --> 13:12.063
You’ll be amazed in England,

13:12.264 --> 13:15.561
the television people told me, that we
cannot accept anything

13:15.762 --> 13:24.183
which does not take money! Can you believe
it, it’s a fact!

13:24.397 --> 13:29.563
In - I think, in Boston or somewhere, they
asked me a question:

13:29.764 --> 13:33.753
“How many Rolls Royces you have got?”

13:34.088 --> 13:37.300
This is journalism, I’m just telling you.

13:37.985 --> 13:44.738
Then the most important thing which is not
realized by modern mind -

13:45.084 --> 13:54.071
that they believe anything new is to be
tried, is a very dangerous thing.

14:07.971 --> 14:16.859
If we are dealing with the living process
of evolution, we have to know

14:17.523 --> 14:23.876
that in spiritual life whatever is going
to happen

14:24.077 --> 14:31.286
must relate to scriptures, to all
the scriptures, must relate to them.

14:46.931 --> 14:55.829
Not to one scripture, say, for Holy Bible
or Holy Koran, or any, but to all of them.

14:58.292 --> 15:02.985
Because it is like a seed that sprouts,

15:03.186 --> 15:11.778
then it becomes the stem, then
the branches, then the leaves,

15:11.979 --> 15:16.668
then the flower and then the fruit; living
process,

15:16.869 --> 15:22.082
it is based on something, evolves through
something.

15:22.283 --> 15:24.711
But whatever is dead - like we can create
a fruit,

15:24.912 --> 15:28.684
plastic fruit from nowhere just like that,
you see,

15:28.885 --> 15:32.592
so which has no basis,

15:37.534 --> 15:40.606
has no meaning.

15:40.807 --> 15:47.078
It must have a basis from where it has
come, its origin must be seen.

16:02.045 --> 16:07.278
As in the growth of the tree all that is
useless drops out,

16:07.479 --> 16:11.574
in the same way in evolution also, all that
is useless drops out,

16:11.775 --> 16:14.976
even useless tradition drop out, everything
drops out,

16:15.177 --> 16:22.594
but ultimately you reach to the epitome
where you become the fruit.

16:25.684 --> 16:33.659
So the time has come for human beings
to become the Spirit.

16:34.048 --> 16:39.156
So every seed has “cambry”, alright?
Yogi: Keimling.

16:39.357 --> 16:46.810
Shri Mataji: And in the same way within us
is our “camry” is the Kundalini.

17:00.462 --> 17:05.321
And this is to be actually awakened,
actually awakened.

17:05.920 --> 17:11.503
Now in Sahaja Yoga we have thousands
of people all over the world.

17:11.704 --> 17:15.733
There are people who are – we can call them
the highest in the society,

17:15.934 --> 17:21.241
there are people who are the lowest
in the so-called society.

17:21.442 --> 17:27.235
All of them are at par with each and every
person,

17:27.436 --> 17:33.553
there is no higher / lower feeling

17:33.754 --> 17:37.894
everyone belongs to that society -
(to somebody: It’s alright) -

17:38.095 --> 17:42.042
it belongs to that society.

17:45.130 --> 17:49.358
Moreover when this happens -

17:49.559 --> 17:57.025
because we understand what these
incarnations were,

17:57.226 --> 18:01.521
the conflict of all religions drops out
like that.

18:01.722 --> 18:06.154
We understand it on central nervous system.
The conflict drops out.

18:06.355 --> 18:10.837
There is no question of not worshipping
Christ -

18:11.038 --> 18:18.573
Muslims, Jews, Hindus all worship Christ,
they all worship Mohammed Sahib

18:18.806 --> 18:22.959
and they all worship Rama, Krishna,
all these people.

18:23.160 --> 18:27.259
Because actually they see that

18:27.460 --> 18:31.689
when the Kundalini rises, she passes
through certain centers,

18:31.890 --> 18:38.345
and there you have to take the name
of those great incarnations.

18:38.546 --> 18:41.662
So this is the knowledge of the roots

18:41.863 --> 18:45.560
and one must know that you have to become
a subtler being

18:45.761 --> 18:48.332
to understand that knowledge.

18:48.533 --> 18:54.019
As a result of Kundalini awakening we can
claim many things.

18:54.220 --> 18:59.660
But that can be seen that cancer can be
cured,

18:59.861 --> 19:03.534
so many incurable physical diseases can be
cured,

19:03.735 --> 19:10.436
mental diseases can be cured, drug
addiction can be cured,

19:10.644 --> 19:18.700
the problems created by these gurus can be
cured.

19:20.696 --> 19:24.905
All these things can be done when you
become the Spirit,

19:25.106 --> 19:31.206
but this should be just at a level
of a hypothesis,

19:31.407 --> 19:35.819
when we do it, and it’s proved, then you
should accept; not blindly.

19:36.020 --> 19:40.004
There is no blind faith in Sahaja Yoga.

19:41.477 --> 19:47.141
We have no priesthoods, nobody is paid.

19:47.856 --> 19:51.174
It’s a free society,

20:00.387 --> 20:04.960
and everyone becomes very knowledgeable.
