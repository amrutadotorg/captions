“TIME HAS COME TO BECOME THE SPIRIT”

00:00:15.128 --> 00:00:28.753
We are here to inform you about a power
which is within us

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:36.031
and the power that can give you what is
promised by all the saints,

00:00:36.232 --> 00:00:41.365
scriptures and all the incarnations.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:49.797
Today when you see the young people
in every country - especially in the west –

00:00:51.692 --> 00:00:56.941
you’ll find they are not satisfied

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:03.464
with their own atmosphere, their lives

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:10.850
and they think there is something missing

00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:18.746
and they are extremely confused.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:30.610
Now when they are confused they are seeking
for something beyond,

00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.351
something unknown to them.

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:44.099
In that seeking, they may take to anything
extreme,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.219
drugs,

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:55.266
could be alcoholism,

00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:08.979
or some other perversions which cause
horrible diseases, incurable diseases.

00:02:22.683 --> 00:02:26.676
Instead of condemning them

00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:34.530
we have to see why they are doing all these
things, what is the purpose.

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:46.761
Also, some of them went to some gurus

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.259
which are in the market.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.076
Especially when they see the religious
people and the religions,

00:03:07.277 --> 00:03:15.639
they cannot believe that religion can give
such horrid experiences

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:30.306
and some of them are anti-God,
anti-religion also.

00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:44.661
But if you deal with the problems
sympathetically, you cannot blame them,

00:03:44.862 --> 00:03:50.719
because they are intelligent, aware people.

00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:04.844
So now we have two category of people,

00:04:05.045 --> 00:04:11.359
one: the ones who are not seeking at all,

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:28.714
and another are the ones who want to find
out solutions of the problems.

00:04:38.088 --> 00:04:45.245
In every generation we had people who
revolutionised

00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:48.436
because they did not like a particular
system,

00:04:48.637 --> 00:04:54.744
or did not like a particular style of life,
whatever it was.

00:04:56.545 --> 00:05:01.378
But now the revolution has to come from
within.

00:05:02.024 --> 00:05:06.492
We have to evolve from within,

00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:23.695
because the destruction is also coming from
within.

00:05:23.896 --> 00:05:28.316
We are destroying ourselves more from
within.

00:05:28.517 --> 00:05:34.145
Because we are so unhappy, so confused,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.127
absolutely “quite a percentage” is
schizophrenic.

00:05:42.183 --> 00:05:49.510
So then we start seeking the solution

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:55.204
and in that seeking we make mistakes.

00:06:03.243 --> 00:06:10.912
And we make mistakes because we do not
know what to seek

00:06:16.497 --> 00:06:19.760
and how to find,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.890
also how to evolve to that state.

00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:43.575
So logically we have to reach some
conclusions, logically;

00:06:43.776 --> 00:06:49.712
that it has to be some evolutionary
happening.

00:06:49.913 --> 00:06:57.570
This is logical, to transform ourselves,
there has to be some evolution.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:05.455
So, like Jung has said, that you have
to become collectively conscious.

00:07:05.656 --> 00:07:10.211
You have to become, it’s an actualization,
it is not just a certificate.

00:07:10.412 --> 00:07:15.763
It has to become from within, it’s
an honest thing, it’s an innate thing.

00:07:15.964 --> 00:07:17.985
It is not just a preaching

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:24.296
or sort of a giving a certificate - it is
not - or taking a name.

00:07:24.601 --> 00:07:29.381
It is actualization within yourself,

00:07:30.545 --> 00:07:36.759
so that something has to happen to us.

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:46.877
Now as we have evolved from monkey stage
to this stage, for example,

00:07:47.078 --> 00:07:52.420
we’ve done nothing, it is a living process

00:07:57.986 --> 00:08:02.204
which has taken place spontaneously.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:27.949
There’s a big resistance to any oriental
ideas being accepted in the West,

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.114
big resistance.

00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:36.522
I find there’s a very big resistance
for any oriental ideas

00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:43.494
coming to the West.

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:56.686
Now these oriental ideas which are coming

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.870
are to be seen with a scientific open mind

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:20.192
because the Western life has grown like
a tree outside,

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:24.659
but the roots may be in the East,

00:09:28.128 --> 00:09:35.278
maybe we can keep ourselves open to see
where are the roots.

00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:51.094
Now if the roots are in the East,
supposing, it’s an hypothesis,

00:09:51.295 --> 00:09:58.247
so let us have a look at it, if there is
any solution in those.

00:09:59.087 --> 00:10:03.228
So you go to oriental ideas.

00:10:03.751 --> 00:10:09.565
But there also is very dangerous, because
you are going in the unknown,

00:10:09.766 --> 00:10:16.217
you might go to false gurus, you might go
to wrong people

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.804
and get completely destroyed.

00:10:22.049 --> 00:10:30.645
So, what do we do? First thing we should
know, we cannot pay for our evolution,

00:10:30.846 --> 00:10:35.127
we cannot pay, money is not there.

00:10:46.522 --> 00:10:53.840
Nor can we pay for any living process.
Any living process we cannot pay.

00:10:55.643 --> 00:11:00.079
Like, if the seed has to sprout, the Mother
Earth will sprout it,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.701
we don’t pay the Mother Earth.

00:11:04.437 --> 00:11:12.511
Alright. So first thing they should have
known that anybody who asks for money

00:11:12.712 --> 00:11:18.747
is not a truthful person. No money should
be involved.

00:11:20.352 --> 00:11:25.020
Then the second point comes in, that we got

00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:31.645
to this stage of human awareness
spontaneously,

00:11:33.422 --> 00:11:37.314
without any effort, effortlessly.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.232
In the same way it should happen.

00:11:52.207 --> 00:11:58.852
But first of all in every evolution there
has been one leader.

00:12:08.717 --> 00:12:11.895
We can call them as archetypes as they say,
or whatever you may say -

00:12:12.096 --> 00:12:19.414
want to say, though Jung was not very clear
on that point.

00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:29.131
So now such a person can decode
the information

00:12:29.332 --> 00:12:34.813
of symbols and everything and can help
others,

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:43.100
without taking any money, without taking
any gratification; can do it.

00:12:43.301 --> 00:12:50.762
And here it is that people fumble
in the West,

00:12:50.963 --> 00:12:56.538
they don’t mind a pope, they don’t mind
an archbishop of Canterbury,

00:12:56.739 --> 00:13:03.986
but they do mind a person who is doing
everything free, just out of love.

00:13:09.552 --> 00:13:12.063
You’ll be amazed in England,

00:13:12.264 --> 00:13:15.561
the television people told me, that we
cannot accept anything

00:13:15.762 --> 00:13:24.183
which does not take money! Can you believe
it, it’s a fact!

00:13:24.397 --> 00:13:29.563
In - I think, in Boston or somewhere, they
asked me a question:

00:13:29.764 --> 00:13:33.753
“How many Rolls Royces you have got?”

00:13:34.088 --> 00:13:37.300
This is journalism, I’m just telling you.

00:13:37.985 --> 00:13:44.738
Then the most important thing which is not
realized by modern mind -

00:13:45.084 --> 00:13:54.071
that they believe anything new is to be
tried, is a very dangerous thing.

00:14:07.971 --> 00:14:16.859
If we are dealing with the living process
of evolution, we have to know

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:23.876
that in spiritual life whatever is going
to happen

00:14:24.077 --> 00:14:31.286
must relate to scriptures, to all
the scriptures, must relate to them.

00:14:46.931 --> 00:14:55.829
Not to one scripture, say, for Holy Bible
or Holy Koran, or any, but to all of them.

00:14:58.292 --> 00:15:02.985
Because it is like a seed that sprouts,

00:15:03.186 --> 00:15:11.778
then it becomes the stem, then
the branches, then the leaves,

00:15:11.979 --> 00:15:16.668
then the flower and then the fruit; living
process,

00:15:16.869 --> 00:15:22.082
it is based on something, evolves through
something.

00:15:22.283 --> 00:15:24.711
But whatever is dead - like we can create
a fruit,

00:15:24.912 --> 00:15:28.684
plastic fruit from nowhere just like that,
you see,

00:15:28.885 --> 00:15:32.592
so which has no basis,

00:15:37.534 --> 00:15:40.606
has no meaning.

00:15:40.807 --> 00:15:47.078
It must have a basis from where it has
come, its origin must be seen.

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:07.278
As in the growth of the tree all that is
useless drops out,

00:16:07.479 --> 00:16:11.574
in the same way in evolution also, all that
is useless drops out,

00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:14.976
even useless tradition drop out, everything
drops out,

00:16:15.177 --> 00:16:22.594
but ultimately you reach to the epitome
where you become the fruit.

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:33.659
So the time has come for human beings
to become the Spirit.

00:16:34.048 --> 00:16:39.156
So every seed has “cambry”, alright?
Yogi: Keimling.

00:16:39.357 --> 00:16:46.810
Shri Mataji: And in the same way within us
is our “camry” is the Kundalini.

00:17:00.462 --> 00:17:05.321
And this is to be actually awakened,
actually awakened.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:11.503
Now in Sahaja Yoga we have thousands
of people all over the world.

00:17:11.704 --> 00:17:15.733
There are people who are – we can call them
the highest in the society,

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:21.241
there are people who are the lowest
in the so-called society.

00:17:21.442 --> 00:17:27.235
All of them are at par with each and every
person,

00:17:27.436 --> 00:17:33.553
there is no higher / lower feeling

00:17:33.754 --> 00:17:37.894
everyone belongs to that society -
(to somebody: It’s alright) -

00:17:38.095 --> 00:17:42.042
it belongs to that society.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.358
Moreover when this happens -

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:57.025
because we understand what these
incarnations were,

00:17:57.226 --> 00:18:01.521
the conflict of all religions drops out
like that.

00:18:01.722 --> 00:18:06.154
We understand it on central nervous system.
The conflict drops out.

00:18:06.355 --> 00:18:10.837
There is no question of not worshipping
Christ -

00:18:11.038 --> 00:18:18.573
Muslims, Jews, Hindus all worship Christ,
they all worship Mohammed Sahib

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:22.959
and they all worship Rama, Krishna,
all these people.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.259
Because actually they see that

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.689
when the Kundalini rises, she passes
through certain centers,

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:38.345
and there you have to take the name
of those great incarnations.

00:18:38.546 --> 00:18:41.662
So this is the knowledge of the roots

00:18:41.863 --> 00:18:45.560
and one must know that you have to become
a subtler being

00:18:45.761 --> 00:18:48.332
to understand that knowledge.

00:18:48.533 --> 00:18:54.019
As a result of Kundalini awakening we can
claim many things.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:59.660
But that can be seen that cancer can be
cured,

00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:03.534
so many incurable physical diseases can be
cured,

00:19:03.735 --> 00:19:10.436
mental diseases can be cured, drug
addiction can be cured,

00:19:10.644 --> 00:19:18.700
the problems created by these gurus can be
cured.

00:19:20.696 --> 00:19:24.905
All these things can be done when you
become the Spirit,

00:19:25.106 --> 00:19:31.206
but this should be just at a level
of a hypothesis,

00:19:31.407 --> 00:19:35.819
when we do it, and it’s proved, then you
should accept; not blindly.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:40.004
There is no blind faith in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:41.477 --> 00:19:47.141
We have no priesthoods, nobody is paid.

00:19:47.856 --> 00:19:51.174
 It’s a free society,

00:20:00.387 --> 00:20:04.960
and everyone becomes very knowledgeable.
