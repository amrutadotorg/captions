00:45:03.088 --> 00:45:09.402
It was really very enjoyable today,
to see all of you,

00:45:09.603 --> 00:45:13.461
in such a happy mood.

00:45:13.629 --> 00:45:18.936
What happiness what joy Sahaja Yoga
has brought to all of you.

00:45:19.137 --> 00:45:23.139
It’s really, I could never have imagined,

00:45:23.316 --> 00:45:28.929
that people could be that joyous and

00:45:30.535 --> 00:45:37.559
that relaxed, as you were this evening.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:43.613
Also it shows, how much you have
understood,

00:45:45.026 --> 00:45:50.447
the stupidity of this hypocrisy going on
in the Name of God.

00:45:50.648 --> 00:45:53.792
Not only that, that you have understood,

00:45:53.993 --> 00:46:00.361
but the way you have depicted it,
showed also

00:46:00.562 --> 00:46:06.685
your great art of acting,

00:46:06.886 --> 00:46:13.813
art of bringing out the salient points
of all this hypocrisy.

00:46:14.045 --> 00:46:20.032
There are many people who can see
this point, not that only we see,

00:46:20.233 --> 00:46:24.482
many people must be knowing about it also,

00:46:24.683 --> 00:46:36.336
but you have the power now to accept it,
understand it,

00:46:36.537 --> 00:46:46.891
and realize it, as the truth, that they are
really hypocrites.

00:46:47.092 --> 00:46:55.494
We have human beings, who of course,
do not want to accept,

00:46:55.695 --> 00:46:59.609
do not want to see. They have closed
their eyes, blind faith

00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:04.146
in all those hypocritical people, somehow
or other,

00:47:04.347 --> 00:47:08.672
they lack reasoning, understanding, logic.

00:47:08.873 --> 00:47:19.363
But there are some who understand,
who have this full image

00:47:19.564 --> 00:47:27.157
of these people in different countries,
in different religions

00:47:27.358 --> 00:47:31.966
and all these guru people. They
understand it.

00:47:32.167 --> 00:47:42.999
But still, they cannot go against it,
they dare not say anything against it,

00:47:43.492 --> 00:47:51.573
and even if they say, it will be in a very
hush-hush manner,

00:47:51.885 --> 00:47:56.015
not so openly as we did it today.

00:47:56.216 --> 00:48:04.021
Though it was very hilarious, and very
enjoyable,

00:48:04.222 --> 00:48:10.163
but behind all this comedy I felt
the tragedy,

00:48:10.497 --> 00:48:20.292
because there are so many who
are suffering,

00:48:21.017 --> 00:48:29.658
who are being looted, who are being
cheated, who are being used,

00:48:30.754 --> 00:48:35.582
morally who have been crushed.

00:48:42.767 --> 00:48:47.877
And I don’t know how many cruel things
are going

00:48:48.078 --> 00:48:52.178
behind the scene in the Name of God.

00:48:52.379 --> 00:49:00.448
Such a tragedy that is still going on
in these modern times.

00:49:00.649 --> 00:49:04.101
But you are all very lucky and fortunate
people,

00:49:04.302 --> 00:49:10.618
that you have dropped all this nonsense,
all the shackles of blind faith

00:49:10.819 --> 00:49:17.870
and now, you are all enjoying the freedom
of your Spirit.

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:24.649
It’s something I enjoyed the most.

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:32.156
We have to understand that we are now
in the Kingdom of God,

00:49:32.357 --> 00:49:37.128
so we can see the reality very clearly,

00:49:37.329 --> 00:49:44.812
and in the Kingdom of the God we are looked
after all the time by the Divine Power.

00:49:45.013 --> 00:49:54.277
How it works out, how it looks after us,
is extremely remarkable.

00:49:54.779 --> 00:49:58.228
As you saw one drama,

00:50:00.731 --> 00:50:05.840
one after all these actors coming
on the stage,

00:50:06.041 --> 00:50:12.731
we actually saw ourselves a drama in India,

00:50:12.932 --> 00:50:18.651
without organizing, very spontaneous,
just like it was today,

00:50:18.852 --> 00:50:24.435
but without any organization, a beautiful
drama we saw which I must tell you,

00:50:24.636 --> 00:50:32.745
so that you will understand how much
this Divine Power is working it out.

00:50:32.913 --> 00:50:39.475
You remember we had a very bad time
in Angapur when these people threw stones

00:50:39.676 --> 00:50:46.792
and so many were hurt, if you remember
that night, and we were in trouble.

00:50:46.993 --> 00:50:54.008
And we had filed a case, but the case was
not somehow or other starting,

00:50:54.209 --> 00:51:01.500
and it was the date, something, where
I could not be there,

00:51:01.653 --> 00:51:06.336
but still the case was there and we didn’t
know what was happening.

00:51:06.537 --> 00:51:11.042
There was one man who had come when
we were having this program.

00:51:11.243 --> 00:51:20.367
His name was Anant Beransbe and he
told Me that he’s from the television

00:51:20.568 --> 00:51:25.444
and he wants to have his Realization. So
I said: ‘I cannot just now I have to speak,

00:51:25.645 --> 00:51:28.327
so you can go on the back side and sit down

00:51:28.528 --> 00:51:34.713
and we’ll see if we can manage
your Realization.’

00:51:34.914 --> 00:51:42.740
When these people, you heard the story,
that it was they who had arranged

00:51:42.941 --> 00:51:45.632
this man from television to come,

00:51:45.833 --> 00:51:52.727
those who had been throwing stones at us,
these Andhashraddha Nirmulan people.

00:51:53.085 --> 00:51:58.424
And we didn’t know what to do. So,

00:52:00.514 --> 00:52:06.652
a son-in-law of our Home Minister,
came to My house in Pradisthan

00:52:06.853 --> 00:52:10.303
and asked for Realization.

00:52:10.504 --> 00:52:16.182
I was quite surprised this man coming
down for Realization.

00:52:16.383 --> 00:52:19.199
And then I told him what is happening
to us.

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.884
He said: ‘No, no, you can go and see
this Home Minister.‘

00:52:23.085 --> 00:52:28.151
Now this Home Minister is a great disciple
of asatya Baba, imagine.

00:52:28.352 --> 00:52:33.665
I said: ‘It’s really; I don’t know how
it will work out this stupid fellow,

00:52:33.866 --> 00:52:39.115
this disciple of satya Sai Baba [She
corrects Herself] - asatya Sai Baba.

00:52:39.316 --> 00:52:45.330
So just see the drama. We were quite
hesitant,

00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:51.830
and with Me Rajesh Shah, Yogi Mahajan
and one Nalgirkar,

00:52:52.031 --> 00:52:59.404
who is from the same area as this Minister
who had arranged this meeting.

00:52:59.605 --> 00:53:05.988
So we went there. So the private secretary
had a great respect for Me,

00:53:06.189 --> 00:53:09.104
so he called the car inside, we couldn’t
understand.

00:53:09.305 --> 00:53:12.949
Then he came and touched My Feet.
I was quite surprised.

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:17.809
Then I went and sat with this Home
Minister,

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:22.840
and his wife came in and she touched
My Feet. I was quite surprised,

00:53:23.041 --> 00:53:27.756
and she said: ‘You don’t remember me?’
I said: ‘I think I’ve seen you somewhere.’

00:53:27.957 --> 00:53:30.888
She said: ‘You’ve forgotten we had gone
together to London.’

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:37.238
There was a offer from Air India for people

00:53:37.439 --> 00:53:41.999
who have been doing social work,
as a sort of a reward,

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.860
that we could go to England and come back.

00:53:45.061 --> 00:53:51.963
So there were quite a lot of ladies who went
and the Chief Minister’s wife also came -

00:53:52.164 --> 00:53:57.715
she was, actually he’s Chief Minister
at that time and she’s his wife.

00:53:57.916 --> 00:53:59.669
They were very well known to My family.

00:53:59.870 --> 00:54:02.983
Actually their marriage was arranged
by My father also.

00:54:03.193 --> 00:54:11.167
So they were, all sort of, they were new
this western culture,

00:54:11.368 --> 00:54:17.775
very old-fashioned ladies, all old ladies
you see, traveling with Me to London.

00:54:17.976 --> 00:54:21.702
There you see they were so shocked
at the dance they saw and everything,

00:54:21.903 --> 00:54:24.166
they said: ‘What are these dirty people
doing here?

00:54:24.367 --> 00:54:26.541
Why are they showing us these dirty things,

00:54:26.742 --> 00:54:29.918
and we are not dirty women.’ And like that
you see they were.

00:54:30.119 --> 00:54:32.441
I had to tell them: ‘All right, they have
this kind of dances only.

00:54:32.642 --> 00:54:34.387
If you don’t want to see, we can go out.’

00:54:34.588 --> 00:54:37.755
Went out and all of them started vomiting
there.

00:54:37.956 --> 00:54:41.840
So it was such a bad condition with them.
So they stuck on to Me in London,

00:54:42.041 --> 00:54:48.100
all of them, and one of them was the wife
of this gentleman, and she said

00:54:48.301 --> 00:54:52.633
that: ‘If You remember we all stuck on
to You.’ They were all older than Me,

00:54:52.834 --> 00:54:55.969
because they couldn’t understand what’s
happening in these countries

00:54:56.170 --> 00:55:01.879
because they had never seen such dances,
such women, such men.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.924
She said: ‘But why are these Air India
people troubling us like this?

00:55:06.125 --> 00:55:09.123
Why do they want to shock us?’ I said:
‘It’s all right.

00:55:09.324 --> 00:55:12.241
That is their entertainment style, doesn’t
matter and all that.’

00:55:12.401 --> 00:55:16.217
But inside I was laughing: ‘I said from
where these old-fashioned

00:55:16.418 --> 00:55:20.643
women have come here and they can’t stand
all this nonsense”.

00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:24.586
But this lady said that: ‘See how You
supported us, how You helped us,

00:55:24.787 --> 00:55:29.607
otherwise we were all collapsing you see
there.’ So this lady was very sweet

00:55:29.808 --> 00:55:32.698
and then she started telling her husband:
‘You know She was quite young

00:55:32.899 --> 00:55:35.988
but She was very wise and She looked
after us,

00:55:36.189 --> 00:55:39.237
and She did this and She was the youngest
and all (that).’

00:55:39.438 --> 00:55:43.994
Then suddenly one girl, now one by one on
the stage, first of all the wife came in.

00:55:44.195 --> 00:55:49.120
Then they announced: ‘There’s a lady called
Nirmala Deshbande who wants to meet her.

00:55:49.321 --> 00:55:54.703
So they said that: ‘No no just now I’m
talking to Shri Mataji. I’ll see her later.’

00:55:54.904 --> 00:55:57.882
‘No,’ I said: ‘You call her, she knows
Me very well.’

00:55:58.083 --> 00:56:02.379
So this Nirmala Deshbande was with Me
in 1942 Movement. Imagine the drama.

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:05.296
She should come that day only,
in the morning time.

00:56:05.497 --> 00:56:13.615
Actually the whole, I mean, our interview
was fixed

00:56:13.816 --> 00:56:16.842
for the previous evening but it was
postponed for next morning

00:56:17.043 --> 00:56:21.701
and next morning one by one how these
people are coming on the stage.

00:56:21.902 --> 00:56:27.764
First his wife, and we had already given
a nice ulta bandhan, the other way round,

00:56:27.965 --> 00:56:32.563
to this two photographs of Mr Narakasura,

00:56:32.764 --> 00:56:39.321
lest he starts pouring some vibhooties
from his photograph.

00:56:39.522 --> 00:56:42.714
Then this lady, this Nirmala Deshbande
she came in.

00:56:42.929 --> 00:56:47.320
As soon as she saw Me she just fell
at My Feet, she started hugging Me.

00:56:47.521 --> 00:56:50.732
She said: ‘How long we have… are meeting
now this that.’

00:56:50.933 --> 00:56:55.283
She even forgot the Home Minister was
sitting there, nothing of the kind,

00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:00.057
and they all started looking at her. ‘Oh
you don’t know her? She was our Leader,

00:57:00.258 --> 00:57:04.771
you see She was like a real Shakti how She
faced the Britishers you have no idea.

00:57:04.972 --> 00:57:09.433
You people have become Ministers but this
is the Lady who fought for the freedom.’

00:57:09.634 --> 00:57:15.960
And all she gave a big lecture to the Home
Minister; and Home Minister – like this.

00:57:24.387 --> 00:57:27.882
But this is not the end [of it].

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:32.792
Then, then she wouldn’t talk to him.

00:57:32.993 --> 00:57:36.541
She was just talking to Me and she said:
‘Oh, You have been doing great work.

00:57:36.742 --> 00:57:39.983
I have heard about You. I’ve been longing
to meet You, but just imagine,

00:57:40.184 --> 00:57:43.033
today I’ve come and You are here after
such a long time.

00:57:43.234 --> 00:57:46.679
Oh you don’t know what a loving Lady
She is. She was so sweet to us.

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:50.905
She was much younger to me in age and we
were so many girls, you see, boys,

00:57:51.106 --> 00:57:56.365
all of them She organized and She was
so young and still She was so brave.’

00:57:56.566 --> 00:58:00.868
And she was describing everything.
I was quite embarrassed.

00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:05.918
So the Minister didn’t know why she had
come there. Then, then I said:

00:58:06.119 --> 00:58:09.866
‘All right now I’m going. I told him
the whole story, gave him all the papers

00:58:10.067 --> 00:58:14.396
and he couldn’t help it, he had to sign
all right: ‘Please do something about it”,

00:58:14.597 --> 00:58:19.484
or something, he wrote to the main man
in Maharashtra.

00:58:19.685 --> 00:58:22.773
I told him about all this and how Rajneesh
has planned this,

00:58:22.974 --> 00:58:28.410
and all this was done by Rajneesh people,
because we have a proof of that.

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:33.329
Then we came out. We came out and there
was one lady

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:38.407
who again touched My Feet, in the verandah.
I couldn’t recognize her very well.

00:58:38.608 --> 00:58:44.436
She said: ‘Have You forgotten?
I’m the Maharani of Satara’,

00:58:44.644 --> 00:58:48.680
where this incident had taken – you know
Angapur is close to Satara.

00:58:48.881 --> 00:58:54.810
‘Ah I remember.’ ‘You came in 1972.
We had a nice meeting in our palace

00:58:55.011 --> 00:59:01.185
and my mother-in-law the Rajmata invited
You, she washed Your Feet.’

00:59:01.386 --> 00:59:05.722
I said: ‘Yes yes I remember.’ ‘But You
forgot us. You never met us after that.

00:59:05.923 --> 00:59:10.218
Now You have to come to the wedding of my
son. I’ve come to invite the Home Minister.

00:59:10.419 --> 00:59:15.103
You have to come to the wedding of my son.’
I said: ‘I’m going away tomorrow to Rome.’

00:59:15.304 --> 00:59:19.307
She said: ‘No no no I’ll take You.
I’ll do this. So all right,

00:59:19.508 --> 00:59:24.941
at least You must ask this Home
Minister to come.

00:59:25.142 --> 00:59:29.303
He’ll listen to You, I’m sure he’ll listen
to You.’ I just kept quiet.

00:59:29.504 --> 00:59:37.324
So, then you see there was a gentleman
standing with her. So she went inside.

00:59:37.524 --> 00:59:42.600
He said: ‘Shri Mataji,’ he touched My Feet,
‘I’ve met You before,

00:59:42.801 --> 00:59:46.478
and You have given me Realization.’
I said: ‘What’s your name?’

00:59:46.679 --> 00:59:51.984
He said: ‘My name is Anant Beransbe.’
I said: ‘What?’

00:59:52.145 --> 00:59:57.099
‘I met You in Angapur. I’m Anant Beransbe.
I was there. You remember?’

00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:01.201
I said: ‘Yes of course. But why did you
come to Angapur?’

01:00:01.402 --> 01:00:04.060
He said: ‘Only a sahaja yogi brought
me there.’

01:00:04.261 --> 01:00:07.008
‘But you were not brought by
the andhashraddhas?’ He said: ‘No never,

01:00:07.209 --> 01:00:10.487
why will I come with these horrible
people?’ ‘So what happened?’

01:00:10.688 --> 01:00:14.969
He said: ‘Only four days back I was
in Satara and the case started

01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:19.021
and they had taken me there. So I told
them that,

01:00:19.222 --> 01:00:23.739
‘I saw seven people being hit by these
andhashraddha people.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:32.810
And they were all bleeding. And I was
so upset with it that I couldn’t bear it.

01:00:33.011 --> 01:00:37.000
I ran away from there. But one thing I must
say: ‘Mataji was telling everybody:

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:40.528
‘Keep quiet, doesn’t matter, doesn’t
matter. Some stones are coming.

01:00:40.729 --> 01:00:44.080
Just keep quiet. Don’t throw any stones.
Don’t do anything.’

01:00:44.281 --> 01:00:48.392
He told there in the Court. Can you imagine
this fellow, in our absence?

01:00:48.593 --> 01:00:51.683
And after one year I met him and then
they started saying:

01:00:51.884 --> 01:00:56.290
‘Oh Mataji must have given him lakhs of
rupees, that’s why he’s talking like this.’

01:00:56.491 --> 01:01:02.587
They thought he was their witness, just
imagine. I said: ‘Really?’

01:01:02.788 --> 01:01:10.185
Immediately I told that private secretary:
‘Bring our petition.’

01:01:10.386 --> 01:01:14.351
And we cut out all that was written
against this Anant Beransbe,

01:01:14.552 --> 01:01:20.688
otherwise he would have been in trouble.
Imagine. And then said: ‘Really?’

01:01:20.889 --> 01:01:24.501
Then this lady came out she said: ‘Why
don’t You come in and tell the Home Minister

01:01:24.702 --> 01:01:28.163
to come to attend my son’s wedding?
At least he should do, Mother.’

01:01:28.364 --> 01:01:31.501
So I went with her and this fellow also
came Anant Beransbe

01:01:31.702 --> 01:01:34.540
and I said: ‘This is that same fellow
Anant Beransbe,

01:01:34.741 --> 01:01:37.957
but he’s telling something else’. And then
he started telling them,

01:01:38.158 --> 01:01:43.553
how they hit and how they were this thing.
He said this Dr Dabholkar he’s a devil.

01:01:43.753 --> 01:01:48.361
And all that; and we had written against
him in that, imagine.

01:01:48.562 --> 01:01:53.691
Can you imagine such a story? This fellow,
this Anant Beransbe,

01:01:53.892 --> 01:01:57.140
who was mentioned in that petition of ours,

01:01:57.341 --> 01:02:02.494
should be there on that morning there
standing, waiting for Me.

01:02:02.695 --> 01:02:07.070
And then he asked him two-three questions,
the Home Minister:

01:02:07.271 --> 01:02:10.463
‘What are they doing?’ ‘Nothing. They were
hitting one after another

01:02:10.664 --> 01:02:15.259
seven people I saw and I got such a fright
I ran away with my camera, couldn’t bear it

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:20.313
and Mataji was telling them: ‘Don’t hit,
don’t hit’. She was so quiet.’

01:02:20.514 --> 01:02:24.036
So, the Home Minister was quite surprised
at this.

01:02:24.236 --> 01:02:29.730
So when we came out, despite that he was
a disciple of asatya Sai Baba and all that,

01:02:29.931 --> 01:02:34.244
how things worked out that first his wife
should know Me,

01:02:34.445 --> 01:02:39.186
then Nirmala Deshbande comes in, then
this Maharani comes in,

01:02:39.387 --> 01:02:42.991
and then after that, and the Maharani
herself praising Me a lot,

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:48.473
that I cured her mother-in-law and
all that. And then comes in Mr,

01:02:48.711 --> 01:02:52.465
this Anant Beransbe, and he told them
the whole story,

01:02:52.666 --> 01:02:54.914
and this Home Minister didn’t know
where to look.

01:02:55.115 --> 01:02:58.496
“Satya” Sai Baba and whole thing was
finished into nowhere.

01:02:58.697 --> 01:03:05.059
So see how the drama worked, and we were
so amazed at the whole thing.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:11.277
When we came out Rajesh said: ‘Mother,
it was Mahasahaja Yoga.’

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:29.249
So in Sahaja Yoga everything works out.
You must know that it all works out.

01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:35.615
But you must also know that you must
have faith in Paramchaitanya.

01:03:35.816 --> 01:03:40.540
Also faith in yourself that you are
in the Kingdom of God.

01:03:40.741 --> 01:03:44.828
I was very happy today the way you enjoyed
all that and understood it

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:51.699
but, one thing is there, that you all
should,

01:03:52.122 --> 01:03:58.443
not that only enjoy this, but feel it
as a responsibility.

01:03:58.644 --> 01:04:05.317
We have to point it out to the whole world,
how hypocritical they are,

01:04:05.518 --> 01:04:16.601
how they are using the name of God, and
how they are ruining people by their tricks.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:23.679
So today I don’t want to tell you lots
of things.

01:04:23.887 --> 01:04:27.698
Today is a day still the Christ has not
risen as they say but -

01:04:27.899 --> 01:04:31.169
I don’t know at this time,

01:04:33.257 --> 01:04:40.259
He must have come out of His grave
already, as it is, because

01:04:40.687 --> 01:04:44.035
He came out and He was standing outside

01:04:44.236 --> 01:04:49.659
when His Mother came and asked Him:
‘Who are You?’

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:52.908
She couldn’t even Recognize Him.
She couldn’t even believe

01:04:53.109 --> 01:05:00.201
that Christ has raised. In the same way
we also forget that we have risen

01:05:00.402 --> 01:05:07.375
and that we are completely transformed,
and we are free, absolutely free people.

01:05:07.576 --> 01:05:12.714
Nothing can dominate us, none
of our conditionings,

01:05:12.915 --> 01:05:20.344
none of our ego, nothing can dominate us,
none of our habits.

01:05:20.545 --> 01:05:28.068
Everything has died out and we are free
birds to fly and to enjoy our flights.

01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:31.774
This is what we have to realize.

01:05:31.975 --> 01:05:34.951
May God bless you all.

01:05:37.198 --> 01:05:40.847
I’ve been telling you that you shouldn’t
give Me any prizes, nothing.

01:05:41.048 --> 01:05:45.305
It’s too much. It is too much
of presentations.

01:05:45.506 --> 01:05:49.735
I mean, I don’t know why you are giving Me
all these things all the time,

01:05:49.936 --> 01:05:57.073
but you think that, that’s only your
privilege that you have to do it.

01:05:57.486 --> 01:06:00.744
So I too have certain privileges, I can
also give you presents.

01:06:00.945 --> 01:06:07.895
So I have bought some very small ones
for all of you, those who are here in Rome.

01:06:08.096 --> 01:06:11.894
For Cabella people I brought, bought
last time,

01:06:12.095 --> 01:06:14.703
but I’ll also do it when they come there.

01:06:14.904 --> 01:06:18.410
And for other countries also I’ll be giving
them whenever I’ll go there

01:06:18.611 --> 01:06:24.177
but just now it is for the people of Rome
and the leaders.

01:06:24.378 --> 01:06:26.989
Leaders, I must, I’m also afraid of them,

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:29.540
because sometimes you see, if they get
angry

01:06:29.756 --> 01:06:33.647
they can form a union against
Me, you know.

01:06:33.848 --> 01:06:37.969
So One has to be careful with them.

01:06:38.359 --> 01:06:46.861
So there’s little presents for all of them
and I hope they’ll accept it and so…
