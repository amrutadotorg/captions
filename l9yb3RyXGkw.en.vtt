00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.320
So we are in Holland,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.360
which is the Holy land of Europe

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.360
and the Holy Land of Europe has got lots of water in it, flowing.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.240
It’s at a lower level than the Mother Earth

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.160
and the sea flows through it,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.360
so it’s a good combination of the sea and the earth here.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.160
So sea cleanses

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.120
and the Mother Earth blesses the people of Holland ,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.320
but if they have lost their moorings

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.160
and they are flying in the wrong direction,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.560
then the same Holy Land can become a hell land.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.240
So we have to be very careful

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.240
to see that we create more and more Sahaja yogis in this place.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200
In My reading of the character of the western people

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.280
I find they are extremely aggressive by nature

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.200
and very egoistical on the whole.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.120
One should not feel that I am saying about you,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.240
but I’m saying you are Sahaja yogis you belong to the Kingdom of God

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.160
but I’m telling about in general now.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.040
While I’m talking keep your eyes open. I don’t know

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.240
why people close the eyes, I can’t understand.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.040
Now when we are in the Holy land

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.480
we find that the Mother Earth has allowed the sea to flow in

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.560
and it is a very good place for Me to say something to you .

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.120
Here the sea has taken refuge in the Mother.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.080
The guru has bound itself with the Motherly qualities.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520
A person feels more safe on the ground

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.280
than on the sea or in the air.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.160
So today is the best opportunity for me to say

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.200
that after the guru puja we have to understand that to be Holy means

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.680
you must allow the guru tattwa to circulate

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.160
in the Mother principle or the guru tattwa is to be controlled

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.280
and guided and beautified by the Mother principle.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.040
It’s only the Mother Earth that is beautiful

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.520
because it can create so many varieties so many dramas, so many place

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.600
any other element, if you see, has nothing in it.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.400
So it is She who can create.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.320
So we should take to the Motherly quality more

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.520
and try to bind our guru principle

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.520
through that Motherly,  beautiful, creative power

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.480
so that we make our presence very agreeable,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.600
very congenial, very beautiful,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.360
full of interest and varieties; every time new flowers,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.400
everytime new fruits, every time a new, new design.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.600
As Kundalini is made of Mother Earth,

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.120
we are quite capable of doing that.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.200
There are gurus and gurus and gurus

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.120
but no one so far is such a master as you are of the Kundalini.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.600
If they were they would have given realization to thousands.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:44.240
Why, because your Mother has penetrated into your guru principle

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.440
and has risen your Kundalini, has given you powers to raise Kundalini

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.400
breaking your 7th chakra, so clearly.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.080
That never happened with anyone,

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.280
even incarnations could not do that to the masses as you are doing.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.360
The Kundalini is flowing from your hands;

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.160
the Ganesha is active in you,

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.240
but it should never give you the ego

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.520
or the sternness or the heaviness of the sea

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.200
but it should give you the beauty of the Mother Earth.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.520
Mother Earth is always bigger than the sea

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.320
because She has to contain the sea.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.520
Sea can never be bigger than the Mother Earth.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.160
Sometimes it looks, sea, bigger

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.440
but sea is contained in the Mother Earth.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.680
It cannot go beyond.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.000
So the Mother Earth is always greater,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.480
bigger, wider than the sea.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.600
So one has to understand that when Kundalini has risen,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.640
you have become all of the seven chakras

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.360
and not only the guru chakra

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.120
and when you have become the guru chakra

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.440
it is also bounded on all sides by the Mother Earth.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.080
Under these circumstances, when we are so capable,

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.160
we are giving realization to so many people

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.000
when we are achieving so many things.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:33.560
If we could just become humble, congenial, beautiful,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.520
we can master the whole world

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.080
but I find in the style of Sahaja yogis, especially in the west

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.440
and westernized Indians, there is so much of ego

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.160
still expressed in their talks, in their behavior.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.280
They are not capable of it, to see I think sometimes;

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.520
but better see it. First you may have to act as sweetly,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.520
maybe, but you must learn that way.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.080
If you do not understand that all your leadership,

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.000
all your guru tattwa depends entirely

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.120
on the loving capacity of your Mother, Her patience.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.520
I get angry but perhaps once in a ten years or twelve years,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.040
something like that, seldom.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.120
That’s better, then the anger has some meaning

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.080
but all the time if you are in a temper

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.360
or you try to show off or if you have so much of ego

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.280
that you go on asserting on wrong things,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.360
then you cannot be effective.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.120
Another thing I’ve seen that ego has no discretion ,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.320
ego has no discretion of any kind.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.400
If you are egoistical first thing you lose is discretion,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.560
then what’s the use of having this nonsense of a ego

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.160
which doesn’t give you discretion?

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.560
And people who have greater ego always then assert

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.560
and you have to agree to that.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.440
You are more impressed by the people who have greater ego

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.320
than yours and you like the people who are

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.600
without any ego so you can oppress on them,

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.320
but the discretion part is very poor. That you can see,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.640
the other day one guru had, or the one gentleman, had come

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.240
and he was given some mantra by his guru,

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:43.480
but he can’t hear anything against his guru. Why?

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.680
Because his ego has chosen that guru;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.040
because the ego has chosen how can the ego be wrong?

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.200
And ego is always wrong, invariably wrong.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.360
Everything is upside down with the ego-orientation.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:05.400
Gradually you will learn that in the west people lack common sense

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.560
completely, they lack common sense in everything.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.480
I mean if they had common sense

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.560
there would have been much less problems,

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.160
but common sense is lacking

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.080
and also I find the same thing in Sahaja yogis.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.240
They lack common sense.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:26.280
You have to become so wise that common sense should be your nature

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.360
but common sense we lack.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:34.080
Like today, today I was discussing

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.520
about say, the labor problems,  which is a very general problem,

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.520
which is a very general problem. You have a labor problem.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.120
For example you have unemployment. some

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.120
Now the whole system that is built in here

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.360
and we too have adopted of it but not to that extent,you

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.040
of working hours, is very absurd.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.080
For example, supposing you get up at four.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.480
I mean that’s very big supposition, of course, but

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.200
supposing we get up at four and we take our bath.what

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.680
Morning time is very peaceful, we can meditate, we can do we like.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.600
Then we finish all the other work we have to do,

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.160
get yourself ready, have yourself ready,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.200
have your breakfast or tea or whatever you want to have.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.040
Then by eight o’clock you are ready for work.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.360
Supposing you go at eight o’clock for your work.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:54.200
So you can work from eight up to one o’clock very easily,

00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.520
very easily, no problem. Then one o’clock you come back home,

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.360
have your lunch and have a siesta.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.520
If you can have siesta for about two hours

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:16.560
’til three, four o’clock , by five o’clock you again go to work.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.600
Then you can work from five to eleven without feeling tired at all,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.040
after eleven you might be. So you put in much more work,

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.280
much less sleep and you keep fresh and young

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.320
but it is, requires, common sense.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.280
Now the, how unemployment can be solved;

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.400
some people can work in the morning, some can work in the evening.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.560
Now those who are working in the morning,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.240
the ladies could be in the house, men could be outside.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.440
Then the men come out in the evening they can do the household work.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.240
Ladies can do in their house or when they are in the house,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.360
men can do creative work

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.440
like making statutes, hand work, hand-made things.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.400
So everybody gets employment;

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.560
they became more creative, much happier people

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.320
and so easy to solve the problem.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.320
But there is unemployment;

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.240
because of unemployment there are so many problems.

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.240
Very easy to solve the problem of unemployment,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.320
you don’t give any social security or anything.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.360
You give them their pay and let them work for shorter time.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.400
If you make them create things and sell them,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.520
they’ll have more money or they can have nice things around them.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.040
Otherwise you can have horrid things like that.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.520
So you can have lots of things which are hand-made,

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.440
plus machine-made things, whatever you want to have.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.160
There should be a balance.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.440
With common sense we should know how far to go,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.200
how far to have balance.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.520
Like machine goes on like mad, we cannot control machines

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.400
because we think we get money, we do not.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.360
After some time machines have to stop.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.400
So you have to go up to, this, I’m trying to put the

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.360
guru tattwa into the Mother tatwa,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.040
that’s practical.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:00.040
So common sense should be applied

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.040
and that can only come when there is no ego.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.320
It’s ego that cannot be common sense “Because I like it, I do it”.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.240
But this “I” is the ego who is blind, who is indiscreet,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.480
who is stupid. So ultimately we do stupid things.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.640
There should be common sense,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.320
which one can learn by getting rid of this ego.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.520
Now people say “Mother, how to get rid of ego?

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.280
” It’s very simple, you have to move left to the right 108 times

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.480
in Sahaja yoga.

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.280
You have to forgive people, in Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.240
And you can watch yourself. First of all see,

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:51.440
do you watch others or you watch yourself?  First of all.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.240
Like there was a lady traveling with Me, very old lady

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.360
and she said “This man is handsome,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.640
this man is not handsome, this woman is good looking,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.120
she is pretty” that way. I was just looking at her.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.120
I said “This mad woman,

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.480
she will go really crazy by the time we get down.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.680
She goes on looking into every person, judging everyone,

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.600
who is handsome, who is not.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.200
” And everybody whom she called handsome I found him ugly.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.200
So I gave up. I said “You better decide,

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.280
I never tried these things”.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:38.680
Then “That man is not good, he is very hot tempered,

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.520
he is this thing, he is that,

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.560
he talks like that, he walks like that,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.320
he shouldn’t do, look, like that”, worried about other people.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.600
You tell them anything,  they’ll go on shaking their neck like that,

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.080
“Oh, how could you do it?” But you do it yourselves.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.480
If you have to say yes then you do it ten times yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.120
If you have to say no, they’ll go on say no, no, no, no.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.520
There is no common sense.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.480
Why to move your neck so many times.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.320
If somebody is saying that you need not react all the time.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.600
So this is another thing, internal reaction.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.440
First is external, seeing everyone, judging everyone,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.000
“Oh, I don’t like this station; this is too much dusty,

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.000
this bathroom is not good, that room is not good,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.320
that thing is not good”, like that,

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.440
as if you are the Queen of England.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.520
Even that could be even more than that

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.040
because she is not even allowed to choose her dress;

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.560
Parliament has to decide.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:04.160
Poor thing cannot have any ego at all, poor thing.

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.440
She has to choose what dress she has to wear for a particular occasion

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:13.200
if the Parliament says yes, she wears. If she says no, no,

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:21.360
big problem, for them. But for us, who are free people,

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.680
we must have common sense to understand what to do,

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:28.360
where to do, what to talk, how to talk,

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.160
but when there is ego, you cannot have common sense.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.640
And this is the reason I think

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.040
the western people have become so stupid in so many things.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.000
Whatever I see, I see it upside down.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.000
Indians, we may be poor people, in the villages,

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.680
they are not so educated. You are all very well educated people,

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.600
everything is there  but all has come out of ego,

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.440
so the common sense is lacking.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.440
So those who deal with the Mother Earth, like farmers are,  have

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.520
tremendous common sense.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.040
Now in Holland I used to think people

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:12.080
will have a lot of common sense because they are farmers you see.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.320
When I had come in ’65, they are better off, much better,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.600
not so nonsensical.  They were well dressed,

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.360
nice, sensible, solid people.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.120
Of course I met quite elderly people also, I should say,

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.040
but I was surprised that in the market

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.320
you could not get a transistor made in Holland ,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.120
could not get anything made in Holland .

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.080
So I said “How is it you don’t make anything, machines?”

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.480
You said “Why should we?

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.360
For our twenty five bulbs of tulips, in those days,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.160
we get one transistor from Japan ,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.040
so why should we make a transistor?” Common sense.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.680
“We sent from here 25 bulbs”

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.200
and they had fields and fields of all kinds of tulips,

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.560
all over, I mean when I came here.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.000
So they said “For 25 bulbs we get one transistor so why should we.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.240
We export our bulbs to them and get their transistors.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.120
Why should we make transistors?”

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.240
Then they said “We export our cheese to a particular country,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.040
our eggs to Italy , our chicken to this country

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.200
and we get all that we need.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:31.280
” I was amazed you see, they are so, so proud of their agriculture

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.320
and so much doing like that way,

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.600
which was a very sensible thing and because

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.480
they were dealing with the land I thought I’ll find

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.040
Holland people to be the best

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.080
but then I got reports that people are absolutely gone off

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.360
their heads. They have become like bullocks now,

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.240
working with the land they have become like bullocks

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.320
who plough the land, you see.

00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.280
I was surprised “How have they become like bulls?

00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:09.600
” They were very sensible people, very sensible,

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.400
farmers sensibly dealing with things

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:22.280
and working out things in such a beautiful manner;

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.360
very innocent and simple people and naive,

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.600
up to a point of sweetness, very sweet.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.440
When we came here they wanted to please us so they

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.200
wanted to put a flag for us, of our country

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.240
and they put Pakistan flag in front of us.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.400
So I was very happy to see that,

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.080
and they were talking vegetarianism,

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.040
but when we came my daughter had suddenly become vegetarian

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.440
because she had developed a funny nausea in the,

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.320
in the ship, you see. So she was not eating any meat or anything.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.360
So she said “I am vegetarian”.

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.320
So they said “Alright, then will you have chicken?”

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.200
They were that simple you know, very simple

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.240
and now they are talking about vegetarianism.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.440
I am surprised. Since ’65 and ’85 only, these twenty years,

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.240
how much they have changed. Very nice and

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:35.320
they were, not busy doing all these exercises

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.160
and reducing weight or increasing weight and jogging on the road.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:43.280
Just now, yesterday, I was walking, everybody was jogging like mad,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:48.680
very sensible, but they have lost their common sense

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.240
because perhaps they do not come in contact with Mother Earth,

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.120
they are using machines too much. Maybe that is one of the reasons

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.360
and must be the air from other outside countries coming

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.040
and they think “They are rustic”, so they must accept

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.240
that is all that is modern, sophisticated, perhaps.

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.120
There is a story about a farmer

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:20.000
who was traveling by train and there were some naughty boys

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.000
who came from the city so they wanted to pull the legs of the farmer.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.480
So one of the boys asked him that

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.440
“If the eggs are selling here

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:36.680
in this station for 20 p.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.240
and in the next station the chicken is selling

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.400
for one pound, what is my age?” Just to tease him.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.480
So immediately the fellow says “You must be 22.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.560
” He said “How do you know exactly I am 22?”

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.360
He said “Because my brother, my brother who is full mad, is 44.”

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.240
You see, they are so practical,  so brass

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.040
you see, as they call it in America , as “brass tacks”,

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:26.240
you see they know what is it. He looked at him and said “22”;

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.120
“How? Why?” “My brother, who is 44, is full mad”.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.160
And these boys didn’t know where to look you see,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.120
because they wanted to tease him.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.360
And the farmers have great sense.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.320
Like we had one minister

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.200
who had developed a bad neck, you see, right vishuddhi.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.560
He was Chief Minister.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.280
He used to go on like this, his head used to go like this.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.320
So some farmers came to see,

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.680
saw him, and they looked at him.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.280
They said “He’s saying no already, what the use of telling him anything?”

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.520
We have lots of stories of farmers in India which

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.320
shows how much they understand life.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.120
I had a very nice gardener, he was from a village.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:27.120
So there was one fellow, old fellow, another gardener.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.200
He said “No use talking to this old fellow”. I said “Why?”

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.440
He said “If he is a Hindu,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:38.320
then an old man is a gone case.” I said “Why?”

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.600
“Because in young age they live like

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.080
ascetics and in old age they become like bhoots,

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.240
but if he is a Muslim, they don’t live like ascetics in young age.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.160
They enjoy life and in old age they are satisfied souls.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.320
So you better talk to a Muslim old man than to an Hindu old man.”

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.480
I mean the reading is so correct about things, you know.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:08.040
Everything that he said was so practical and so sensible.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.560
I was really surprised how he could say these things

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.400
with such sweetness and with such goodness

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.440
and how he understood so many things so well.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.520
And he was a very young fellow; about I would say

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.560
thirty to thirty two years of age.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.440
So he came to Bombay to see us.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.040
He didn’t know our full address, he only knew Marine Drive

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.080
so he told the fellow his taxi fellow “You drive me at Marine Drive “.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.200
He said ” Marine Drive is a big place”.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.320
He said “You drive me anywhere in Marine Drive “, so he drove.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.240
So he went and asked “Is there a very tall

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.280
gentleman staying in Marine Drive somewhere?

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.240
And you see, my husband is one of the tallest in Indians, you see.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.320
So he went to the servants, asked

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.240
“Have you seen any tall sahib anywhere?”

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.600
He said “Just one tall is staying there, you see”.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.040
So that’s how he came to our house. And he showed them  his shoes,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:06.040
This shoe is given to me by my sahib, he is also very tall, you see.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.320
So he said “This shoe he has given me and he wears the same style of shoes”.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.640
So servants notice all these things, they are very practical people.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.600
So another gardener who met him, he said “Yes there’s a tall fellow

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.240
and he wears the same type of shoes”. And so he came to our house.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.040
How they are sharp and how their eyes are so

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.080
penetrating, how they know everything about everything.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.480
It is remarkable, very remarkable

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.000
and that is what we have to be.

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.040
We have tobe gurus with the Mother’s  influence on us,

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.160
all the time the Mother controlling us, the Mother guiding us,

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.240
the Mother making our [UNCLEAR], the Mother making our maryadas.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.160
So the Motherliness is your blessing.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.400
Today you are raising your Kundalini because your guru is a Mother;

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.040
otherwise you could never have done

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.280
and that is why Motherliness is so important.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.120
One of the reasons, perhaps, why the Sahaja yogis run away

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.080
from the leaders

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.400
and sometimes from the people who want to have follow-on, maybe,

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.560
that we do not know that they are just entering in, just opening out.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.480
So try to be kind, just hatching,

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.320
the little chicks, you see, will die very fast.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.440
You have to handle them very, very carefully.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:36.040
I am saying this after so many years of not saying this

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:41.520
and I'm requesting all of you, try to develop. Sit before the mirror

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:45.120
and try to act like a Mother. Better see,

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:50.440
practice it, try to be nice, kindly, gentle, patient.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.080
If you want to spread Sahaja Yoga in the west we have to do that,

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.400
not in Maharashtra, Maharashtra ‘s Mothers are quite strict

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.200
and they are straightforward and children are used to it.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.160
You might find that I will say “My Mother was a very strict lady but

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.080
I think I like her very much because she taught me so many things;

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.080
all my sisters are expert cooks; we are very good in the life;

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.040
we are doing so well in life; we don’t trouble anyone”.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.560
All these things have come from our Mother. She was a strict lady

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.280
as she would not tolerate any nonsense.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.360
She would never tell a lie herself and if you tell her “Alright,

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.280
if this gentleman is coming, you tell that I am not in the house”,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.080
“Don’t tell me to tell lies; I’ll tell him

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.680
that you told me to tell the lie”.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.480
That’s how she was and that’s how she treated us

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.200
and we lived with that but we didn’t mind it because

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:48.200
what she did was for our good.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.440
We knew that she was doing it for our good. Not in this country,

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.320
people don’t understand this fact. They have ego,

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.120
they never understand that this is for your good.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.480
They will always understand this is aggressiveness

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.480
because they themselves are aggressed or they are aggressive.

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.160
If they are aggressed, they are even worse.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.120
So try to understand what is the situation in this country.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.160
I have adjusted Myself; you also should adjust yourself here

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.360
to the way it is and that’s how I should not hear any more

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.680
any complaints about, now, again the guru tattwa has to go inside

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.120
the Mother tattwa.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.160
So next time I will not have

00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:36.640
any complaints but they should all say “Oh, Mother,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.000
what a nice man,  he’s so kind,

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.160
so gentle, so very sweet”.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.080
It doesn’t take at all, anything, to be that.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.400
Now in this good atmosphere when the nature is so abundant

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:55.640
and the sun also is hiding its own sharpness,

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.200
where everything is so beautiful, we should decide that

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.640
we will behave in a manner that will behoove our Mother

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.680
and not fight, not quarrel, not say things.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.080
Like somebody in the train now, supposing going,

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.000
will go and quarrel with the ticket collector.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.240
“This is my seat, that is mine”.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.280
Sahaja yogi does not do that.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.000
Sahaj, “Alright you want, alright, I’ll sit here.  Alright,

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.560
whatever is legal, I’ll do that, whatever is proper, I’ll do.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.040
You want, alright, doesn’t matter, you don’t allow, alright”.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.000
Immediatelythe person melts away.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.160
But if you “No, this is my seat. I have booked it, this, that”.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.680
And then your Mother plays tricks there, on top of that.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.040
So ultimately you find that the seat was not yours

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.080
and you are looking very upset about it,

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.560
how a Sahaja yogi is insulted.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:15.560
So that is how it is going to work out in this beautiful manner

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.040
if we understand the beauty of sweetness

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.160
and beauty of your Mother Earth,

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.240
how She beautifully creates everything

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.440
and even She is so sweet, I tell you

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.160
that if you are sleeping under a coconut tree.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.520
Can you imagine now?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.480
A coconut is so big, if it falls on anybody’s head, finished;

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.640
stomache, also, terrible.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:48.000
It can break your bones

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:52.680
but it will never fall on any human being or any animals.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.240
Can you believe it? It’s a fact.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.360
That is the [unclear: pritumbhara??].

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:00.160
That is the qualityof the Mother Earth.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.480
It never falls on any human being or animal.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.320
How does She manage that?

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.080
And you have seen how the flowers also form, [UNCLEAR]

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.240
you’ll never see the flowers growing, how the Mother does that;

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.240
otherwise we’ll have problems, you see. Suddenly you’ll see a flower

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:32.120
So She, slowly, She does it and suddenly, oh!

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.320
She makes the leaves so beautifully arranged

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.200
that they all get the sun.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.640
How She manages! Then She creates

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:52.320
a beautiful shade for you, the color scheme, everything so beautifuL

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:59.480
and then how She nourishes that because all the leaves drop down

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.320
and they give nitrogen again to the Mother Earth

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:05.200
and then She again nourishes them.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.320
But the leaves have to fall down if the Sun has to come to the Mother Earth.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.520
It is all Her doing

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.280
but She does it so beautifully that we are

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.440
not even aware of what She is doing to us.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.160
We don’t know. If you notice it, the one thing

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:26.120
about the Mother Earth, beauty that She creates

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.160
and how sweetly She does it,

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:34.200
you would say that even one billionth of that, if we have,

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:39.320
we could be somewhere, already,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.120
ruling, in the Kingdom of heaven, is what it is.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.400
So as you have got your Kundalini,

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.080
you must develop that sweetness within you,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.200
in such a manner that people see you and think

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.240
that you are great Mothers,

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.440
but as you know in the west the mothers are so horrible,

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.680
the women are so dominating

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.280
that people do not have a proper image of a mother also.

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.320
Women are extremely dominating.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.240
Women must learn to dominate, it’s so easy,

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.560
a bull can dominate anyone but can they be like Mother Earth

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:31.360
which can bear up all kinds of,

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.120
troubles, all kinds of problems,

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.440
can we do that way?

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:47.000
Especially that’s why I request women of this country

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:51.120
to develop those beautiful qualities  and not of domination.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:57.320
Domination, it doesn’t behoove a woman, it doesn’t look nice on her.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.680
It’s like a bull, she is wearing as a

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.600
diamond piece around her neck,

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.280
it’s not beautifying. So we must give up that idea

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.440
of dominating or trying to oppress the husband.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.560
He says something, we say “no” to children, we say “no”,

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.320
to everyone we try to dominate.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.480
That’s not our character.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.200
Even, I think Roosevelt once said that,

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.600
of course he must have met real Indian women,

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.160
that an Indian woman she is like

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.520
a magnolia in an Indian forest.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:41.120
Of course, here the magnolias are useless but in Indian forest,

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:46.560
even one flower in the forest, it is hidden, you can’t see it,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.400
but you can smell it.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.520
The whole forest is fragrant,

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.480
you can’t see it anywhere, it is one flower,

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.480
you can know this magnolia

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.040
and this is the greatest quality

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:07.040
because love is the most attractive thing in the world.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.320
Why do you hang around Me?

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.520
Just the ask yourself.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.440
Because My vibrations, My photograph has got.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:29.600
No. You feel that you are loved, that I love you.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.600
It’s a very great quality

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.600
but I have that innate within Me, I don’t have to have it from anywhere

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.120
and you, too, have it. Just expose it and manifest it.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.520
MAY GOD BLESS YOU Thank you
