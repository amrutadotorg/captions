00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:31.228
So here we are in Finland and

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:40.081
hell, competing with itself a little bit

00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:43.801
because is the end of land, you see, so

00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:48.001
all the problems come and settle in the end, you see?

00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:54.021
And that’s how we see here that there are lots of negative forces

00:01:54.221 --> 00:02:00.501
that have been working very nicely,

00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:05.501
and also there are so many seekers.

00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:10.781
So, it’s more of an attraction for them to come here and attack the seekers.

00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:16.301
So now when you take to Sahaja yoga, you have to know that

00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:23.641
Sahaja yoga is like the light coming in your life.

00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:26.861
And the light which comes

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:30.461
gradually shows you everything that you have.

00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:33.761
For example, you are carrying the snake in your hand.

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.841
Somebody says, "Throw away the snake!" you see.

00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:40.061
You are in the darkness, you think it's a rope.

00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:43.201
So you don't want to throw away the snake.

00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:46.561
But the light comes in, you see the snake in your hand,

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:50.421
you get afraid, you throw it away. You get afraid.

00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:54.041
And somebody might just run away, thinking that the snake has come

00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.201
from Sahaja yoga.

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:02.601
So the people who come to Sahaja yoga also

00:03:02.781 --> 00:03:06.221
will be like that. They'll come to Sahaja yoga,

00:03:06.381 --> 00:03:09.341
and they will be upset about themselves,

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.561
“Oh, God, this is my condition,”

00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:16.601
And they will not like to face the reality, will run away.

00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:20.201
So, you have to be very patient with them and careful.

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:23.381
A little complication piece.

00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:28.401
So if somebody is coming to Sahaja yoga, say,

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:33.721
he is coming from complete darkness, from complete ignorance,

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:37.461
you see. Maybe he's already half mad.

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:41.201
You will not know, what his mental condition is.

00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:45.521
Maybe he is suffering from some sort of a horrible disease,

00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:48.701
could be cancer, could be anything. Because

00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:53.301
he would have been to gurus, this, that, there could be anything.

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:57.721
And maybe they are not suffering yet from that.

00:03:57.901 --> 00:04:00.901
Or they are suffering so well that they can't heal it.

00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:06.041
So it's very complicated. So one should not - first of all -

00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.581
Know, first principle of Sahaja yoga: "Never get disappointed!"

00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:12.301
Never get disappointed!

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:15.461
Sometimes you have to work hard.
I've worked on people

00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:18.741
for twenty-four hours and I found they are good for nothing.

00:04:18.921 --> 00:04:21.641
Just like stones. If I worked on stones, at least

00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:26.181
I would have created the Ganesha out of them.

00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:31.221
You find there is nothing, nothing has come out of that, all that

00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:36.101
work of puja. So there is nothing to feel frustrated in Sahaja yoga.

00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:39.281
It's our... whatever we have to do, we have to do,

00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:42.381
we shouldn't worry about the fruits of it.

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:47.261
One of the main principles of Gita is: Karmanye vadhikaraste

00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:51.701
Though the karma is there, but not to be thought. [INDIAN LANGUAGE]

00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:55.381
Phaleshu ma kadachan (we should not worry about the fruits). And that's what it is.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.601
So that will keep you on the right track.

00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:01.761
Otherwise you may get frustrated. And I have known people,

00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:04.921
how they have been breaking heads and... So one day I said,

00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:10.181
"Why are you so much worried?" See, it happened in Boston. They said

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:14.381
"Mother, do You mean to say, 'All of them are going to go to hell'?"

00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:17.941
I said, "I don't say that. But that's hope. [THAT'S GATE?]"

00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:21.381
But I would say that at least you should not give up hopes.

00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:24.361
Till the end we should try to save them.

00:05:24.541 --> 00:05:27.881
And things would work out. And it has started working out there.

00:05:28.021 --> 00:05:31.201
In the same way, we have to know that in the beginnig

00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:34.341
you never get many sahaja yogis. Never, whatever you may try.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.581
Even in India I started with one sahaja yogi.

00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:41.561
Because we have to have a foundation, proper foundation, you have to

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.541
have proper. Also, Divine doesn't want us to have too many people.

00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:48.721
Because there would be just useless people joining us.

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:52.661
So we have to know that first of all, we have to have solid, good

00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:56.201
sahaja yogis. And those who call themselves Sahaja yogis have to build

00:05:56.381 --> 00:06:01.921
up themselves in such a manner that they are very good sahaja yogis

00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:06.501
and there are no catches, nothing. And their attention is good.

00:06:06.661 --> 00:06:09.101
First, once they are established,

00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:11.641
then we can build up the whole thing above them.

00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:15.561
But otherwise it so happens that if the foundation is weak,

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:18.401
the whole building can go down.

00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:23.201
So we have to have few sahaja yogis. We can't afford to have many.

00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:27.941
Though you will see when I go - like deflected,

00:06:28.141 --> 00:06:31.161
then thousands they will be there.

00:06:31.361 --> 00:06:34.681
Everywhere. I mean it's not... Italy I went, Milano...

00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:37.861
They have never seen my face, they have never known who I was.

00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:41.521
But the all hall was full. I don't know how many thousands people.

00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:44.441
And you had to just wade through it.

00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:48.881
Everybody was so enthusiastic. I could see the future also.

00:06:49.081 --> 00:06:52.341
So we got about ten people out of all that.

00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:57.821
Then ten people more, ten more. That's how it started gathering.

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:01.601
Because since Sahaja yoga, you have to become [UNCLEAR].

00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:05.281
Becoming is the problem. If you don't become something,

00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:08.501
you are no good in the Sahaja yoga.

00:07:08.681 --> 00:07:12.261
So, this is a very very big problem, should never get frustrated,

00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:16.181
never get upset about it. If anybody says anything to you, after all

00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:20.621
he is blind, so doesn't matter. Have pity on him and don't get angry

00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:23.761
at him at all. There are maybe some fanatics, somethings, you see,

00:07:23.941 --> 00:07:26.901
they are against Sahaja yoga naturally.

00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:31.041
Because they are fanatics, they are not wanting reality.

00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:34.801
So all such things will happen. You will have to show your patience

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:38.721
and a complete forbearance. That is very important.

00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:41.881
Never to get frustrated. Remember what we have.

00:07:42.061 --> 00:07:45.061
we should try to perfect it. The more you'll perfect it,

00:07:45.221 --> 00:07:48.201
the better it will be for our basic things,

00:07:48.341 --> 00:07:51.221
our foundation, which has to be very strong.

00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:55.301
And once the foundation is strong, then you can go ahead with it.

00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:58.561
But just now to begin with, you should not talk about Me much.

00:07:58.741 --> 00:08:01.721
You just say, that, "She is the ordinary human being,

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:04.701
like person the most." If you don't want to tell lies, you can just

00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:07.741
say that, "All right, She is all right, we shouldn't discuss that,

00:08:07.921 --> 00:08:10.941
let us discuss something else. Let us know about science.

00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:15.161
That's better. Then you see, then we know Her", like that, you see.

00:08:15.341 --> 00:08:18.921
Just keep it for the further discovery.

00:08:19.141 --> 00:08:23.401
If you go on making them understand that it is for their benevolence

00:08:23.581 --> 00:08:26.681
or their own energy and their own maneuvering,

00:08:26.861 --> 00:08:30.481
they should keep it to themselves, they will be happy.

00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:33.621
And not to tell them about Me much.

00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:37.081
And the miraculous things of Sahaja yoga should not be described

00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:40.661
or talked. Like Heidrich talked to them about the photographs

00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:43.601
with these two persons, but they have been doing Sahaja yoga.

00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:46.981
But normally, never show them any miraculous photographs.

00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:50.661
Because they will always say, "You have managed it and

00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:55.241
you try to be with it sort of a... kind of a... maneuvering."

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:59.101
For that I would say that...

00:09:01.181 --> 00:09:04.801
[ASIDE:] Smoke is not all right.

00:09:05.681 --> 00:09:08.861
So, you should

00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:17.821
limit yourself to some things. Like

00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:21.961
telling about Sahaja yoga, about Kundalini, about all these things.

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:25.301
But about Me or about miraculous photographs

00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:30.121
and all miraculous things you should not talk.

00:09:35.321 --> 00:09:38.381
Keep it in a general way.

00:09:38.561 --> 00:09:43.661
And also you shouldn't say, "It's a puja," and things like that.

00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:47.521
Because very few people can come to puja, you know that.

00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:51.821
So everybody need not know about puja, need not know about things.

00:09:52.001 --> 00:09:55.401
But what you can tell them is that there are chakras,

00:09:55.561 --> 00:10:00.241
they are to be cleaned out and they are to be kept in balance.

00:10:00.421 --> 00:10:03.561
And we have to rise the Kundalini, how to rise the Kundalini,

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:06.941
also get advanced. And you say that, "Just now let's use Mother's

00:10:07.121 --> 00:10:10.261
photograph for the time being. But later on, we are becoming, we are

00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:13.721
free independent guru-beings first, then you don't have to use

00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:18.381
Mother´s photographs." Then they'll never give up.

00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:29.021
Isn't it? So, all they'll fight for it!

00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:35.621
And thirdly, they are afraid of collectivity.

00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:40.021
So you have to say that, "Because we are not collective, that's why

00:10:40.201 --> 00:10:43.661
we are frightened, and if good people all collect together,

00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:47.361
if righteous people..." Like that if you talk, they won't be afraid of.

00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:50.581
You see, now, only the thugs combine with,

00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:54.921
only the thieves combine. The good people don't combine.

00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:59.381
So we have to combine good people. So then they will understand

00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:02.601
that part, and they won't be angry. Otherwise,

00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:06.681
if you say, "We have to have collectivity", they must be thinking,

00:11:06.821 --> 00:11:10.661
"They are up to something." That will be the suspicion. It is always!

00:11:10.821 --> 00:11:15.261
Because you'll, you only see that nobody combines for love. If they

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:20.501
combine together, they only combine for what you call, is the fight.

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:25.301
Or the hatred, or could be some sort of a sinister stuff, you see.

00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:29.101
Otherwise they never combine. If you say, "We are for love,"

00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:34.321
they’ll go away, “Oh, we know this kind. The story we know, this love.”

00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:38.561
So if you have to really bring them round through discussion

00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:42.621
and argument, you must, first of all, be very good to Sahaja yoga.

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:45.901
That means that, of course the knowledge of Sahaja yoga is too vast,

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:50.361
but you should be in such a mood and such a state and such

00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:53.941
a personality, that they should see that there is something special

00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:58.721
about this person. And then they will accept you much better.

00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:02.561
All right? That's what we have to do and not to get frustrated.

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:07.441
It's a fun! It's just fun. That's all!

00:12:07.621 --> 00:12:11.461
We don't get this, all right, we have other one. Doesn't matter!

00:12:11.641 --> 00:12:14.561
And now I've been going to countries and countries and countries,

00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:18.261
now I would say that first venue I went to, Italy,

00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:22.221
- which is today is a great Sahaja yogi nation -

00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:25.361
I stayed in a hotel, like this.

00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:28.781
And Mr. Gavin had arranged to stay in a hotel and there was going to

00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:33.521
be a press conference. And there a very huge meeting for which also

00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:38.141
I paid for a big hall. Literally.

00:12:38.361 --> 00:12:43.841
So where we were there, with me was Gregoire's first wife. Venda.

00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:47.701
And they gave us the, of course, room and all that was nice,

00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:51.561
and I stayed there. But when in the evening we went down,

00:12:51.741 --> 00:12:57.201
not a single soul from the press and not a single cockroach even

00:12:57.381 --> 00:13:02.781
for the meeting! And before that we got,

00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:07.901
I for the things went out to do the postering!

00:13:11.961 --> 00:13:16.061
And she was so worried that, "If catch us and something

00:13:16.261 --> 00:13:19.341
will happen." I said,  “Nobody’s going to catch you. Take it from Me.

00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:22.601
Just like we will do." I went and did all the postering, because

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:26.201
we were the only people there.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:32.881
So this is how it is. Despite that, not a single soul, who came in.

00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:36.921
Not a single soul. It's all right. This was fun, you see.

00:13:37.121 --> 00:13:42.501
It happened that time, so I could tell you today to you to laugh.

00:13:43.161 --> 00:13:46.341
So that is how. They'll real..., they'll realize it

00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:49.421
later on in Sahaja yoga. Gradually they [THEY WILL BE KNOW]

00:13:49.581 --> 00:13:52.901
[THAT FOR] they have been doing, how they were stupid. How they were.

00:13:53.061 --> 00:13:57.181
And they'll enjoy it to themselves. So all humans are important

00:13:57.341 --> 00:14:00.821
in Sahaja yoga. Very important. Because that gives a variety

00:14:01.001 --> 00:14:03.801
and an interesting theme.

00:14:03.981 --> 00:14:07.101
So everything has to be taken as fun.

00:14:07.281 --> 00:14:12.101
I wish everybody could completely understand this,

00:14:12.281 --> 00:14:16.001
and relax completely on this point. Never get frustrated.

00:14:16.181 --> 00:14:20.241
If somebody is not all right, doesn't get vibrations,

00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:25.361
you should just smile a little bit, "All right, next that will be."

00:14:25.581 --> 00:14:29.121
All right? So may God bless you!
