WEBVTT

00:01.170 --> 00:09.990
So today we have gathered here to worship
Buddha.

00:09.990 --> 00:24.039
Lord Buddha, as you know, was Gautama, the
one who

00:24.039 --> 00:45.140
was born in a royal family, and then, He became
an ascetic, because He was very much hurt

00:45.140 --> 00:56.149
to see three types of problems from which
human beings suffer.

00:56.149 --> 01:08.920
And He came to conclusion [that] all these
three types of problems are because we have desires.

01:08.920 --> 01:22.990
So He said that, “If you become desireless,
then there will be no problem for you."

01:22.990 --> 01:27.920
So He studied Vedas, He studied Upanishadas,
He studies all kinds of things.

01:27.920 --> 01:36.020
He went to many saints and many people and
He could not get His Realisation.

01:36.020 --> 01:40.289
Actually He was an Incarnation.

01:40.289 --> 01:50.630
The incarnation also has to reach a point
of Realisation in a different way: like the

01:50.630 --> 01:54.070
whole potential has to open out.

01:54.070 --> 02:14.510
But the incarnation has tremendous potential,
and that expresses itself once the door is opened outward.

02:14.510 --> 02:21.940
Buddha realised the greatest problem of human
beings is his ego.

02:21.940 --> 02:36.970
In his ego he goes to the extremes: from one
end to another.

02:36.970 --> 02:57.840
And so He worked throughout on the Pingala
Nadi for us, and stationed Himself on our ego, to control it.

02:57.840 --> 03:06.640
If you see on the Agnya Chakra, if in the
centre is Christ, you have on the left Buddha,

03:06.640 --> 03:09.610
and on the right is Mahavira.

03:09.610 --> 03:23.140
All of them are called as Lords, because They’re
rulers of these three areas.

03:23.140 --> 03:33.120
Now this area of Agnya is the area of Tapas,
is of penance.

03:33.120 --> 03:38.159
Because they have done penance for us, we
don’t have to do any penance: means they

03:38.159 --> 03:40.580
have done for us everything that is possible.

03:40.580 --> 03:45.579
That’s how the Sahaja Yogis don’t have
to do any penance, they are in a beautiful

03:45.579 --> 03:48.069
place having a nice vibrations.

03:48.069 --> 03:55.140
They don’t have to go in the jungles, run
away from the society and hide themselves

03:55.140 --> 04:07.950
in a place where there could be scorpions,
could be snakes, could be tigers, could be any danger to life.

04:07.950 --> 04:16.890
So the penance part is over and also Buddha
in His lifetime – when He was alive, all

04:16.890 --> 04:22.570
the time He said, “There is no need to have
any austerities.

04:22.570 --> 04:28.160
There’s no need to have any austerities
at all."

04:28.160 --> 04:38.610
If you read Buddha, His early teachings, then
you’ll be surprised that He said there should be no austerities.

04:38.610 --> 04:41.470
He Himself went through austerities.

04:41.470 --> 04:50.540
But that was the time, samayachar, was the
time, where they needed people who would go

04:50.540 --> 05:03.940
all out to do the propagation of His ideas,
so most of them took to a kind of a life but

05:03.940 --> 05:06.530
He never believed in any austerities.

05:06.530 --> 05:10.890
Moreover, He was not a vegetarian.

05:10.890 --> 05:18.921
He died because once He went to a village
and He was hungry and He asked one of the

05:18.921 --> 05:26.720
hunters, we call them as kiratas, that, “I
would like to eat now and I have to go for My work."

05:26.720 --> 05:33.880
He said that, “This morning I have killed
a wild boar but it must take some time otherwise

05:33.880 --> 05:36.090
it’s very hot blood."

05:36.090 --> 05:39.940
He said, “Doesn’t matter."

05:39.940 --> 05:54.350
[It’s] very significant – right side – to
take the red meat of a wild boar without getting it cooled down.

05:54.350 --> 06:01.210
He ate it and He died with that.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.850
Everything that they do has a meaning.

06:03.850 --> 06:13.410
As we find meaning in the life of Christ,
we find in the meaning of Buddha also.

06:13.410 --> 06:23.160
That is the reason why the buddhists became
vegetarians.

06:23.160 --> 06:33.870
Because Buddha died eating that hot meat they
became vegetarians.

06:33.870 --> 06:41.660
But that doesn’t mean that everybody has
to become vegetarian.

06:41.660 --> 06:46.750
Those who have ego, it’s better they are
vegetarians.

06:46.750 --> 06:55.520
Right side people are better with the vegetarian
food, more and the left side more with the

06:55.520 --> 07:03.780
protein, that we know very well.

07:03.780 --> 07:14.410
So He tried to control the people who were
with Him in a way which was very loving and affectionate.

07:14.410 --> 07:24.000
But what was the accent in His message is
to be understood.

07:24.000 --> 07:35.080
There was one boy who came to Him and asked
Him that, “Sir, will you initiate me into buddhism?”

07:35.080 --> 07:37.210
It was not ‘ism’ that time.

07:37.210 --> 07:41.620
“Will you initiate me?”

07:41.620 --> 07:49.710
He said, “My child, only the brahmins can
be initiated,” meaning the Realised souls.

07:49.710 --> 07:52.110
“What is your birth?”

07:52.110 --> 08:03.350
He said, “Sir, I don’t know my birth,”
so went back to his mother and asked, “What is my birth, mother?

08:03.350 --> 08:06.490
Who was my father?”

08:06.490 --> 08:14.170
She said, “My child, I was a very poor woman
and I didn’t know how to exist, so I had

08:14.170 --> 08:21.970
many lords, I lived and I don’t know who
is your father."

08:21.970 --> 08:27.440
“You don’t know my father?” she said,
“No."

08:27.440 --> 08:42.130
So he went to Lord Buddha and asked him, “Now,
who is your father, and what is your caste?”

08:42.130 --> 08:50.449
He said, “Sir, I have no caste, because
my mother told me that she had many lords

08:50.449 --> 09:01.470
and she doesn’t know from where I am born,
so I don’t know my father."

09:01.470 --> 09:13.300
So Buddha embraced him, He said, “You are
the brahmin, because you have told the truth."

09:13.300 --> 09:17.259
So the essence of his life is truth.

09:17.259 --> 09:25.949
First, we have to be honest to ourselves.

09:25.949 --> 09:32.420
And I find some people find it very difficult
to be honest to themselves.

09:32.420 --> 09:35.220
They know how to escape the truth.

09:35.220 --> 09:39.269
They know how to manage.

09:39.269 --> 09:47.670
To get out of it, they’ll give some argument,
or they’ll give some explanations.

09:47.670 --> 09:55.699
Whom are you giving explanation – to yourself
only!

09:55.699 --> 10:05.689
Your Spirit is residing within you, which
is enlightened in your attention and now [to]

10:05.689 --> 10:07.629
whom are you explaining?

10:07.629 --> 10:16.209
To your own Spirit?

10:16.209 --> 10:26.620
So the message of Christ may be that we have
to resurrect ourselves.

10:26.620 --> 10:34.720
But what about resurrection?

10:34.720 --> 10:42.230
That you have to be very honest to yourself,
first thing.

10:42.230 --> 10:50.510
First and foremost thing to know that your
caste is a brahmin, that you know the Brahma,

10:50.510 --> 10:53.821
you know the All-pervading Power, you have
felt it.

10:53.821 --> 11:06.100
You are the real brahmins, and as real brahmins,
you have to be spartan.

11:06.100 --> 11:14.569
I mean, in India say, we have a brahmin, they
may not be real brahmins, but born in a brahmin

11:14.569 --> 11:20.149
family, there may have been forefathers, might
have been brahmins or something like that,

11:20.149 --> 11:23.170
they call themselves brahmins, all right.

11:23.170 --> 11:26.150
So what is their specialty?

11:26.150 --> 11:30.029
At four o’clock in the morning they’ll
get up, all the brahmins.

11:30.029 --> 11:32.520
That’s how you can make out a brahmin.

11:32.520 --> 11:37.550
I am also a brahmin that way.

11:37.550 --> 11:45.589
Then they’ll have their bath, clean themselves
completely and sit down for prayers or pujas,

11:45.589 --> 11:47.079
or maybe meditation.

11:47.079 --> 11:55.529
That’s how you make out a brahmin, though
they are not brahmins, but the tradition.

11:55.529 --> 12:11.890
While say a shudra in India, will get up at
nine o’clock, in tradition: wear dirty clothes,

12:11.890 --> 12:22.240
put his hands in his mouth, will be a lousy
fellow, surrounded by rubbish.

12:22.240 --> 12:30.410
He cannot even feel the smell of the filth,
because they have been doing that kind of work, traditionally.

12:30.410 --> 12:39.010
They are not, there are many brahmins, we
have found out, now, who are really born in

12:39.010 --> 12:42.110
a shudras families.

12:42.110 --> 12:48.629
So actually in the shudras families, as such,
it’s not by birth, but by their aptitude,

12:48.629 --> 12:52.029
by their jati, they are brahmins.

12:52.029 --> 12:55.160
But traditionally it’s accepted in their
society.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.550
Their hair will be dishevelled.

12:57.550 --> 13:04.170
You can immediately make out, no oil in the
hair, first point.

13:04.170 --> 13:09.139
No oil in the hair, hair are all dishevelled.

13:09.139 --> 13:25.559
Secondly, they are not bothered about sex
life, and amounting to the rakshasas, it’s

13:25.559 --> 13:31.180
only the rakshasas who get interested in women,
look at women and all that, actually, according

13:31.180 --> 13:38.720
to Puranas, I am sorry to say, is a quality
of rakshasas.

13:38.720 --> 13:43.889
Because when there was the churning (of the
ocean), the [samudra] manthana took place,

13:43.889 --> 13:54.619
and amruta came out of, the ambrosia came
out of the sea, then Shri Vishnu knew the

13:54.619 --> 14:02.910
weakness of the rakshasas.

14:02.910 --> 14:13.569
They had taken the kumba, the pitcher of the
Ambrosia, by force, the rakshasas, because

14:13.569 --> 14:22.670
they were more powerful, more egotistical,
they could [be] cunning, so they managed with

14:22.670 --> 14:33.660
the Devas and took away, and they were about
to drink it.

14:33.660 --> 14:44.559
So Shri Vishnu knew the weakness of rakshasas,
so he dressed up like a lady, Mohini, called himself Mohini.

14:44.559 --> 14:57.410
Mohini means the one which attracts you by
your dress, figure, all this kind of nonsense.

14:57.410 --> 15:04.610
And immediately all the rakshasas fell for
her, for Him, I mean!

15:04.610 --> 15:14.850
Immediately, I mean you could make out between
the Devas and the rakshasas.

15:14.850 --> 15:23.990
But say in Greece, they have made Devas into
rakshasas, solved the problem!

15:23.990 --> 15:34.420
And as soon as he discovered
that one of them had taken something, it said

15:34.420 --> 15:43.199
so in mythology, he went and giggled and being
a rakshasa, he liked the lady giggling, no

15:43.199 --> 15:56.420
giggled at him and then tried to tickle, rakshasa
way, proudly, “Beautiful woman coming and tickling me, ohhh."

15:56.420 --> 16:05.809
(Laughter) As stupid as he was, he felt so
tickled that he vomited out.

16:05.809 --> 16:16.149
And they say that garlic was born out of that
ambrosia, it’s said so, I mean, mythologically.

16:16.149 --> 16:30.480
So when I see people in Sahaja Yoga, not being
honest to themselves, the first thing they

16:30.480 --> 16:49.050
must know – ego is a very, very cunning
stuff, but also it makes you a slave of another ego.

16:49.050 --> 17:00.980
See now, for example, a lady would go to these
beauty shops, dress up herself, wear these,

17:00.980 --> 17:09.020
do all like that, I don’t know what they
do, but they come out of it after three, four

17:09.020 --> 17:21.620
hours and look the same to Me, (Laughter)
I don’t know how much money they empty out.

17:21.620 --> 17:31.130
But it’s something surprising that the hair
is cut this time in a different way.

17:31.130 --> 17:34.640
So you ask, “Why did you cut it this way
now?”

17:34.640 --> 17:38.270
“That’s the fa-shion."

17:38.270 --> 17:40.990
That means you don’t have your own ideas.

17:40.990 --> 17:43.520
You don’t have your own concept.

17:43.520 --> 17:49.400
Whatever is the fashion, you just do it.

17:49.400 --> 17:54.370
You don’t understand also that this is good
for you or not.

17:54.370 --> 17:56.120
So the ego gets dominated.

17:56.120 --> 18:04.120
Supposing there is an entrepreneur, say, very
clever and cunning, more than anybody else, supposing.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.510
There are many like that, of course.

18:06.510 --> 18:15.950
Now he says that, “You can put a jam tin
on your head and tie up your hair like this

18:15.950 --> 18:26.200
and you’ll look very fine”, and he puts
up lots of advertisement – all his jam tins can be sold!

18:26.200 --> 18:31.530
Without thinking they will use jam tins.

18:31.530 --> 18:34.980
Means you have no personality of your own.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.370
What’s the ego?

18:36.370 --> 18:40.030
Ego should give you a personality, a character,
a temperament.

18:40.030 --> 18:48.490
And when you see them you can’t make them
out – like sikh people, you know, as you

18:48.490 --> 18:53.870
cannot make out one sikh from another, because
they all wear beard and moustaches.

18:53.870 --> 18:58.170
You can’t make out ladies from one to another,
because everybody has the same hair style,

18:58.170 --> 19:04.840
the same style of clothes, everything’s
the same, because it’s a fa-shion.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.730
Who has started the fashion?

19:06.730 --> 19:14.120
Some very cunning fellow [who] wants to make
money!

19:14.120 --> 19:25.550
In India, we get a kind of a…we call it
tokni, is a kind of a basket, small little

19:25.550 --> 19:29.330
basket; and suddenly it disappeared from the
market.

19:29.330 --> 19:35.810
We didn’t know where it has gone, I mean
it’s impossible!

19:35.810 --> 19:37.100
What can you do with it?

19:37.100 --> 19:39.540
It’s a very simple thing.

19:39.540 --> 19:41.550
It was all in America.

19:41.550 --> 19:45.550
“Why?”, “The women are using them for
their hair."

19:45.550 --> 19:46.620
I said, “How?

19:46.620 --> 19:49.120
What do they do with their hair?”

19:49.120 --> 19:50.560
“No, no, no, no.

19:50.560 --> 19:56.860
See nowadays, they don’t put any oil in
their head, so they have all become bald."

19:56.860 --> 20:00.920
You will become bald, no doubt, if you don’t
put oil.

20:00.920 --> 20:04.640
I am telling you now, you’ll become bald.

20:04.640 --> 20:07.400
So we are austere people, we can’t put oil,
you know.

20:07.400 --> 20:14.110
But then we become bald automatically, you
can join any buddhist organisation, nicely,

20:14.110 --> 20:20.000
you don’t have to shave!

20:20.000 --> 20:28.800
So they say that, “We have become bald now,
so we have to have something."

20:28.800 --> 20:37.380
So they put those baskets and on top of that
they put, what you call them, wigs.

20:37.380 --> 20:38.380
Wonderful!

20:38.380 --> 20:41.650
“But why, why don’t you put it on your
head?”

20:41.650 --> 20:45.790
“No, you must have a nice fluffy hair, you
see!”

20:45.790 --> 20:46.790
“For what?”

20:46.790 --> 20:52.940
“But that’s the fashion."

20:52.940 --> 21:01.460
One day, one lady talking to Me, her basket
fell down and came down also the wig, (Shri

21:01.460 --> 21:08.280
Mataji laughing) and that’s how I discovered.

21:08.280 --> 21:12.110
(Laughter)

21:12.110 --> 21:18.650
So what is – this is to understand that
if you have your ego really in the real way

21:18.650 --> 21:31.550
you should have your own personality, your
character, your understanding, your speciality,

21:31.550 --> 21:34.570
your temperament.

21:34.570 --> 21:39.100
That’s not there.

21:39.100 --> 21:44.420
What did Buddha do?

21:44.420 --> 21:51.040
He said: get rid of everything, your hair,
even your eyelashes, anything that can be

21:51.040 --> 21:58.270
shaved off, hands, feet, everything, shaved
off.

21:58.270 --> 22:03.280
Imagine if you are following buddhism, what
would have happened to us.

22:03.280 --> 22:10.120
(Shri Mataji laughing) And He said, “All
right just wear a Kashaya."

22:10.120 --> 22:12.500
Means saffron clothes.

22:12.500 --> 22:18.510
“Come with the saffron clothes, with everything
shaved,” and the ladies could wear only

22:18.510 --> 22:23.570
two dresses, one on the blouse and one a sari,
that’s all, no petticoats, nothing.

22:23.570 --> 22:32.280
Whether you are a queen, or whether you are
a sweepstress.

22:32.280 --> 22:40.380
All of them should look alike – so no fashion
anymore.

22:40.380 --> 22:45.070
But buddhists are the greatest fashionable
people you could ever think of.

22:45.070 --> 22:54.182
If you go to Japan, you will go mad, if you
see their fashions, because they’re so artificial.

22:54.182 --> 23:08.290
I don’t know where is buddhism gone, where
Buddha always praised people who were natural.

23:08.290 --> 23:28.400
All buddhism is lost like this, into a kind
of a wilderness.

23:28.400 --> 23:36.190
Another thing the right sided people have
a problem, because if you become too right

23:36.190 --> 23:42.190
sided you neglect the left side, neglect your
Mooladhara because, you see, “What’s wrong, what’s wrong?”

23:42.190 --> 23:46.170
Till you get AIDS, nothing was wrong, now
something is wrong.

23:46.170 --> 23:50.040
Till you get cancer, “What’s wrong in
smoking, what’s wrong?”

23:50.040 --> 23:59.270
I mean they advertise, even in India, that
you look really great if you have a cigar

23:59.270 --> 24:05.690
in your hand or a cigarette in your hand;
you look like a chimney, but alright.

24:05.690 --> 24:12.810
(Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) So they
pamper your ego by telling you all these things

24:12.810 --> 24:32.450
and you start doing it, and in that doing,
you just forget that you are a stupid fool!

24:32.450 --> 24:42.070
We are going to lose all our beauty if we
listen to these cunning people who are entrepreneurs, take it from Me.

24:42.070 --> 24:48.900
We had Mona Lisa, these days you don’t find
her, anywhere, nowhere.

24:48.900 --> 24:51.640
You have mosquitoes, horrible!

24:51.640 --> 24:58.810
They think they are very beautiful, [but]
they don’t emit any vibrations.

24:58.810 --> 25:07.450
From any angle of aesthetics, they are not
beautiful.

25:07.450 --> 25:11.680
And by the time they are forty years, they
look at least eighty

25:11.680 --> 25:27.710
So, what has happened is that we are playing
into the hands of our ego and our Mooladhara is lost.

25:27.710 --> 25:34.960
Mooladhara is the brakes, is like a brake.

25:34.960 --> 25:38.521
The right side is the accelerator and the
left is the Mooladhara which is the brake

25:38.521 --> 25:43.860
– but “What’s wrong?”

25:43.860 --> 26:00.130
That’s why Buddha preached Brahmacharya,
celibacy, because if you go too much to the

26:00.130 --> 26:06.710
right side, now there are many complications.

26:06.710 --> 26:19.780
I can hear them for many people that those
who are overactive can’t produce children.

26:19.780 --> 26:25.490
First, “What’s wrong?”

26:25.490 --> 26:37.600
Then, complete dryness – they cannot have
children.

26:37.600 --> 26:44.590
And if they have children by chance, may turn
out to be rakshasas only.

26:44.590 --> 26:48.010
So too much asceticism can take you too much
to the right.

26:48.010 --> 26:54.019
That’s why Buddha said, “No asceticism
is needed."

26:54.019 --> 27:03.040
He said it, though He had people around Him,
whom He looked after, saw to it that they

27:03.040 --> 27:11.470
were celibate people and He is the one who
gave them balance and managed them.

27:11.470 --> 27:20.080
So once you start going on the right side,
you end up automatically like a cabbage, automatically.

27:20.080 --> 27:25.700
You cannot produce children, you cannot live
long.

27:25.700 --> 27:31.240
Like taking cocaine, you can say.

27:31.240 --> 27:37.290
You speed up very much, you become very speedy.

27:37.290 --> 27:44.150
And you have to really…to live with them
is so difficult, very difficult.

27:44.150 --> 27:49.260
Because they move with the speed of a jet
and I move with the speed of an elephant.

27:49.260 --> 27:52.040
I just look at them going, coming, going,
coming.

27:52.040 --> 28:01.010
(Laughter) I don’t know how to relate.

28:01.010 --> 28:12.000
So to curb this ego we have to worship Buddha,
we have to worship Buddha.

28:12.000 --> 28:24.720
But the first principle is to respect your
chastity.

28:24.720 --> 28:28.972
To respect Buddha means to respect your chastity.

28:28.972 --> 28:39.040
You don’t have to give up your wife as you
have given: unless and until they are horrid.

28:39.040 --> 28:43.540
Don’t have to give up your husbands.

28:43.540 --> 28:46.410
All of them were without wives.

28:46.410 --> 28:54.740
Buddha had a wife, He gave her up, Mahavira
had no wife, Christ was never married.

28:54.740 --> 29:04.730
But in Sahaja Yoga you do marry, you have
children, no doubt.

29:04.730 --> 29:19.680
And, as we were saying, that, with ego, we
become, in a way, very much involved into ourselves.

29:19.680 --> 29:23.360
So we can say there are three types of people
in this world.

29:23.360 --> 29:32.240
One who are not bothered about others.

29:32.240 --> 29:41.900
So the first message of Buddha is honesty
to yourself.

29:41.900 --> 29:52.600
And the first area where one has to see the
honesty is in your chastity.

29:52.600 --> 30:06.660
You can marry, you can have a wife, you can
have a husband, you can have children.

30:06.660 --> 30:20.400
So this ego, which was first there, creates
one type of a person, the person who is just

30:20.400 --> 30:35.870
involved into himself: his ambition, his projects,
his jobs, his wife, at the most; or his children,

30:35.870 --> 30:44.680
his house, his car, maybe his horse, maybe
his dog (Laughter) at the most!

30:44.680 --> 30:49.110
If he could extend.

30:49.110 --> 30:55.650
Otherwise, if you tell such a person, “I
am rather” – say – “worried about

30:55.650 --> 31:04.790
someone,” that person will tell Me, “See,
you have done your duty.

31:04.790 --> 31:09.850
Now if that person doesn’t want to do it,
why should you worry, you should be happy."

31:09.850 --> 31:12.850
“But how can I be happy?

31:12.850 --> 31:16.610
I am not your type."

31:16.610 --> 31:34.080
And such a person also will say that, “This
is my house

31:34.080 --> 31:39.310
so why should I worry about anybody else who
has no house?

31:39.310 --> 31:41.740
This is my room.

31:41.740 --> 31:44.730
This is my carpet."

31:44.730 --> 31:52.030
Anybody comes in ‘my’ house “Oh sit
there, put that there!’”

31:52.030 --> 31:57.990
Such a horribly harsh person.

31:57.990 --> 32:05.820
“My and mine, my and mine” – goes on
working.

32:05.820 --> 32:13.180
And this ego then spreads, more and more and
more and more, and then – “I believe in

32:13.180 --> 32:18.580
an ideology!” like Hitler did it.

32:18.580 --> 32:25.480
He must have been hurt by some Jews, might
have been.

32:25.480 --> 32:38.800
So [with] that hurt he was completely built
into a big horrible prison by his ego and

32:38.800 --> 32:49.340
he wanted to kill every Jew!

32:49.340 --> 33:00.890
So this kind of a person that is, is so involved
into himself, “I, me, mine” and “I am the best."

33:00.890 --> 33:05.560
“Everybody’s a stupid fool, I am the most
intelligent.

33:05.560 --> 33:10.970
I’m the cleverest, I know everything."

33:10.970 --> 33:29.670
Like a saying: “I was coming by the road
and I saw a dacoit, so I ran up to the tree and hid myself.

33:29.670 --> 33:32.420
What a great person I am.

33:32.420 --> 33:41.150
Then the dacoit came and he threatened me,
so I gave away everything to him.

33:41.150 --> 33:44.300
What a great person I am.

33:44.300 --> 33:47.610
Then the dacoit came and he took away my wife.

33:47.610 --> 33:51.780
What a great person I am."

33:51.780 --> 33:55.180
Self-certificate!

33:55.180 --> 33:58.420
And he’s very happy.

33:58.420 --> 34:09.380
Everybody is tired of such a person, everybody’s
unhappy of such a person, no one likes [such a person].

34:09.380 --> 34:17.599
If such a person is coming from this side,
most of them will run away from the, “Oh, that’s coming!”

34:17.599 --> 34:24.879
We have in India some people of that kind,
in every city, well known, well known, everybody knows them.

34:24.879 --> 34:30.109
So now, in the morning, people go out for
a walk in a garden and they see such a person coming from that side.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.109
“Oh!

34:31.109 --> 34:32.480
God today we will not have our food."

34:32.480 --> 34:34.099
I said, “Why?”

34:34.099 --> 34:40.970
“Most inauspicious person we met today was
this one, this one, this one."

34:40.970 --> 34:49.429
But he’s very… he’s walking like this,
“What’s wrong?”

34:49.429 --> 34:52.470
No one likes such a person.

34:52.470 --> 35:03.099
You may think no end of yourself [but] no
one likes you.

35:03.099 --> 35:11.440
Countries after countries there have been
[such] people, such a collective nonsense it is.

35:11.440 --> 35:23.070
Sometimes, when you see how so many people
were killed in America by the same Spanish

35:23.070 --> 35:33.910
people who are today Sahaja Yogis, I can’t
believe that you are the children of the same

35:33.910 --> 35:37.890
Spanish, I mean you are so different!

35:37.890 --> 35:41.880
So beautiful.

35:41.880 --> 35:47.480
So what was it that made them so cruel?

35:47.480 --> 35:54.499
That ego, that ego that built up in them,
that they could not see that, “These are

35:54.499 --> 35:57.480
human beings we are killing."

35:57.480 --> 36:06.420
“We have aggressed their country, we are
here, we’re killing them, we have no right to be there."

36:06.420 --> 36:13.660
Same with the Portuguese: they all disappeared
into Brazil while they belong to Portugal

36:13.660 --> 36:17.550
and Portugal there are only 5% people left.

36:17.550 --> 36:24.470
They’re not bothered about Portugal which
is very, very poor.

36:24.470 --> 36:30.000
Same thing with the Spanish, those who went
to America, “So what?

36:30.000 --> 36:32.289
We’ve earned our own America.

36:32.289 --> 36:37.270
We are here, we have done this, we have done
that, we have killed so many people.

36:37.270 --> 36:47.329
The Spanish have not killed anyone, so why
look after the Spanish?”

36:47.329 --> 36:55.859
And this is how their ego brought forth such
a destruction.

36:55.859 --> 37:02.800
When I went to Colombia first time, I don’t
know, one gentleman knew about Me.

37:02.800 --> 37:09.369
He asked Me, “Mother, are You the one who
is known to be a spiritual leader?”

37:09.369 --> 37:10.900
I said, “Yes, I am, so what?”

37:10.900 --> 37:13.079
He met Me in a party.

37:13.079 --> 37:15.390
I was surprised he called Me ‘Mother’.

37:15.390 --> 37:27.880
So he said, “Can You bless our country with
something that we can outwit these Americans.

37:27.880 --> 37:33.930
Let there be something from the nature.

37:33.930 --> 37:40.299
We have got wheat, we produce wheat here and
these people want to buy it at such a low

37:40.299 --> 37:43.650
price that we can’t even maintain our families.

37:43.650 --> 37:48.011
It is so low price that we cannot really economically
do it.

37:48.011 --> 37:54.140
We starve ourselves and sell these wheat to
them."

37:54.140 --> 38:05.930
So now, in Colombia, that shanty town of Colombia,
Bogotá, now has become the most developed one.

38:05.930 --> 38:18.940
They all travel by first-class, and Americans
are taking cocaine and washing their feet.

38:18.940 --> 38:28.769
This is the reward of the ego.

38:28.769 --> 38:41.680
You have to pay the dividend, you have to
pay for your ego, and very severely.

38:41.680 --> 38:49.210
Try any tricks with your ego, it boomerangs
back to you.

38:49.210 --> 39:03.910
Of course in Sahaja Yoga it’s the worst,
is the worst, I am frightened to see somebody riding a horse.

39:03.910 --> 39:11.859
I must also mention another type of people
that there are, who are left-sided.

39:11.859 --> 39:18.309
They are always complaining, “I have got
a headache, I have got a pain here, I have

39:18.309 --> 39:20.609
got a pain there, I’ve got this."

39:20.609 --> 39:23.200
All kinds of diseases they will have.

39:23.200 --> 39:39.530
Like I read a book of Jerome, that one fellow
read…I hope you people are not in a hurry.

39:39.530 --> 39:57.680
(laughter) So he had described that – one
fellow went to doctor, to a doctor, and he

39:57.680 --> 40:03.160
said, “Sir, I have all the diseases that
are described in Materia Medica except for

40:03.160 --> 40:07.400
one that is the housewife’s knee."

40:07.400 --> 40:11.069
(Laughter) He said, “How is it that you
don’t have that?”

40:11.069 --> 40:16.569
He said, “Because I am not a housewife."

40:16.569 --> 40:23.010
So he said, “How did you get all these diseases
and how do you know?”

40:23.010 --> 40:29.571
He said, “Because I read Materia Medica
and I found all these diseases are with me."

40:29.571 --> 40:32.750
So he said, “Alright, I’ll give you a
medicine but just now you don’t take it,

40:32.750 --> 40:39.249
you have to go out from here about five miles
and there you can take it."

40:39.249 --> 40:45.190
So he took the medicine, one, in a piece of
paper.

40:45.190 --> 40:57.539
He went there and he opened it one after another
and he found no medicine, but the last paper

40:57.539 --> 41:04.170
was there, on that it was written, “You
stupid fool, don’t read Materia Medica!

41:04.170 --> 41:08.150
Nothing is wrong with you!”

41:11.619 --> 41:18.740
So the complaining people are another one,
and they are really bhootish, sometimes they

41:18.740 --> 41:21.880
are very troublesome, I don’t know.

41:21.880 --> 41:29.989
If you just say, “How do you do?” if I,
by mistake, say – then there’s a list of things.

41:29.989 --> 41:37.029
(Laughter) “Oh God, why did I say such a
thing to this person?”

41:37.029 --> 41:39.250
This list of things, you know, one after another.

41:39.250 --> 41:44.119
“This happened, this morning, this happened,
evening this happened, that happened."

41:44.119 --> 41:46.500
Everything happens to them.

41:46.500 --> 41:50.790
“And the food was so bad, and they treated
me so badly, and the Sahaja Yogis were so

41:50.790 --> 41:56.829
bad, and they didn’t take me there, and
they troubled me so much, and I was left alone,

41:56.829 --> 42:01.049
nobody bothered about me.

42:01.049 --> 42:04.400
And they are very cruel to me, and this leader
is very harsh to me.

42:04.400 --> 42:10.210
He doesn’t treat me well and, this, please
remove this leader and he did this and he did…”

42:10.210 --> 42:11.210
“What did he do?”

42:11.210 --> 42:12.589
“He didn’t allow me to take water."

42:12.589 --> 42:13.589
“Eh?

42:13.589 --> 42:16.900
Why will he not allow you to take water?”

42:16.900 --> 42:21.190
Something stupid like that they’ll tell
you.

42:21.190 --> 42:26.450
Sometimes I feel – where are those great
saints lost?

42:26.450 --> 42:34.970
Who were the third type of people who didn’t
care for themselves, and who had not involved

42:34.970 --> 42:41.720
in them, but they were involved in others,
who were bothered about others, what’s the

42:41.720 --> 42:44.869
trouble of another person.

42:44.869 --> 42:52.890
“What is the trouble our leader is having?

42:52.890 --> 42:58.430
How am I behaving towards the leader?

42:58.430 --> 43:00.489
What am I doing to him?

43:00.489 --> 43:02.900
Am I of any help to him?

43:02.900 --> 43:06.049
Have I given Realisation to anyone?

43:06.049 --> 43:08.269
Have I given any money properly to him?

43:08.269 --> 43:17.900
Am I sensible, or I trouble him all the time
and then I go on complaining to Mother?”

43:17.900 --> 43:21.079
These people can never be satisfied.

43:21.079 --> 43:29.970
One is over satisfied, the another one is
never satisfied.

43:29.970 --> 43:35.359
And the one who is in the centre is least
bothered to find out whether he is satisfied

43:35.359 --> 43:46.390
or not satisfied, he just wants to see the
satisfaction of others.

43:46.390 --> 44:00.089
And that is what is to be seen in Buddha’s
life, how He was and how He respected.

44:00.089 --> 44:09.269
So the people who today are worshipping Buddha
should know that His message of Truth, which

44:09.269 --> 44:20.009
we know through our right side, through our
attention, must be applied to ourselves, first of all.

44:20.009 --> 44:28.299
People will tell Me, “Mother, his vibrations
are not alright, this house has no good vibrations,

44:28.299 --> 44:35.220
that has no good vibrations”, and the fellow
himself is shaking before Me, you know – like this.

44:35.220 --> 44:37.369
And I said, “What about your vibrations?”

44:37.369 --> 44:39.690
“Oh, I am getting too much."

44:39.690 --> 44:44.780
But I am also getting too much, so please!

44:44.780 --> 44:51.829
The problem with Sahaja Yogis sometimes is
that they don’t know the importance of what

44:51.829 --> 44:55.369
they are, they are not aware.

44:55.369 --> 45:09.690
If their ego was correct, in that ahamkara,
ego, the essence of it is aham-bhava, is that,

45:09.690 --> 45:16.172
“I am a Sahaja Yogi."

45:16.172 --> 45:18.920
Now keep the point of honesty with it.

45:18.920 --> 45:24.720
“Honestly, I’m a Sahaja Yogi and I’m
a follower of a religion, which is a universal

45:24.720 --> 45:26.790
religion, which is innately built myself.

45:26.790 --> 45:32.150
There’s no hanky panky about it.

45:32.150 --> 45:42.049
Is my experience, and I believe in it fully,
and is innately within myself."

45:42.049 --> 45:43.210
This is the ahambhava.

45:43.210 --> 45:52.630
I don’t know what is it in the English language,
is could be ‘I-ness’, ‘I-ness’.

45:52.630 --> 46:00.579
Then, “I am on this earth now, this life
is for the work of God.

46:00.579 --> 46:09.810
And for that I have to be a pure person, because
I belong to Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

46:09.810 --> 46:18.920
I have to be pure, I have to achieve my purity
through meditation through every way watching myself.

46:18.920 --> 46:23.329
I have to be a pure person.

46:23.329 --> 46:29.440
And if I am a Sahaja Yogi, if I am united
with that All-pervading Power of Love, I should

46:29.440 --> 46:33.059
be the medium to give that love to others,
and compassion.

46:33.059 --> 46:37.869
I have no time for other things.

46:37.869 --> 46:41.900
Other things are of no value.

46:41.900 --> 46:44.859
My attention has to be pure.

46:44.859 --> 46:46.319
My life has to be pure."

46:46.319 --> 46:49.989
“I say one thing, do another thing.

46:49.989 --> 46:57.279
I cheat myself morning till evening, then
I have no ‘I-ness’, I have no self respect."

46:57.279 --> 47:03.589
“If it is possible, why not manage something
free?

47:03.589 --> 47:08.810
Say, If Mother has a house, let’s go and
have some nice time there.

47:08.810 --> 47:12.950
After all it’s Nirmala House, so we can
have something free."

47:12.950 --> 47:15.670
No self respect.

47:15.670 --> 47:27.430
“I mean, let us save some money, if possible
here and there."

47:27.430 --> 47:31.299
No self respect.

47:31.299 --> 47:37.019
There are people I know of that kind.

47:37.019 --> 47:43.269
Supposing we come for two days to Ganapatipule,
“Mother, will you charge us for one day?”

47:43.269 --> 47:48.450
[this is] very common.

47:48.450 --> 47:54.930
Who is going to pay?

47:54.930 --> 48:01.759
“I have to pay at least for my food, for
my stay.

48:01.759 --> 48:04.410
I have to pay."

48:04.410 --> 48:16.190
It’s not like Buddha’s time when they
had to give up their whole kingdom.

48:16.190 --> 48:18.519
Everything to dhamma.

48:18.519 --> 48:27.380
Every pai, everything that they had, even
their hair, I think.

48:27.380 --> 48:29.849
Everything to dhamma.

48:29.849 --> 48:33.190
And just come absolutely bare.

48:33.190 --> 48:44.890
No children, no wife, no father, nothing!

48:44.890 --> 48:49.160
That was buddhism, that was Buddha’s style.

48:49.160 --> 48:56.440
He had His disciples like this and they used
to walk miles together, to preach from one

48:56.440 --> 49:01.519
place to another in thousands.

49:01.519 --> 49:10.720
What an impression it must be on people when
they see all this.

49:10.720 --> 49:22.450
Today’s Puja is very important, because
I feel western countries have gone off with

49:22.450 --> 49:28.460
their ego, and they need Buddha very much,
and they like also this so-called buddhism

49:28.460 --> 49:34.720
very much, because you see, they can then
just hide behind that camouflage.

49:34.720 --> 49:38.289
“We are buddhist, you see."

49:38.289 --> 49:43.109
They’ll worry about Afghanistan and they’ll
worry about Llama.

49:43.109 --> 49:49.029
They’ll worry about all other people, because,
“You see, we are buddhist."

49:49.029 --> 49:53.430
But there’s no Truth in it, no Truth.

49:53.430 --> 49:59.920
Sahaja Yogis have to establish that truth,
that dedication.

49:59.920 --> 50:02.029
So Buddha has said,

50:02.029 --> 50:03.770
“Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

50:03.770 --> 50:09.070
I bow to all those who are Realised souls.

50:09.070 --> 50:16.160
“Dhammam Sharanam Gachami."

50:16.160 --> 50:22.200
I bow myself, to my Dharma.

50:22.200 --> 50:27.170
That is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

50:27.170 --> 50:29.119
And then lastly is,

50:29.119 --> 50:32.079
“Sangham Sharanam Gachami."

50:32.079 --> 50:36.490
I bow to collectivity.

50:36.490 --> 50:45.320
In these three things He has solved the problems
of all three types of people, if you see that.

50:45.320 --> 50:50.599
First is the Buddham, the one who is a Realised
soul.

50:50.599 --> 50:57.979
All the Realised souls are to be respected,
to be surrendered to.

50:57.979 --> 51:08.779
I find one Sahaja Yogi talking about another
Sahaja Yogi in a very funny manner, for nothing at all.

51:08.779 --> 51:10.859
No respect!

51:10.859 --> 51:13.450
Buddham Sharanam Gachami.

51:13.450 --> 51:15.930
I surrender myself to all the Buddhas.

51:15.930 --> 51:27.160
Now there are eight I counted, but we have
so many – all Buddhas sitting here!

51:27.160 --> 51:38.890
Those who have known, those who are gnostics,
who are vidas, vidvahanas, are sitting before Me.

51:38.890 --> 51:45.150
So I surrender myself to them, as he says,
“Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

51:45.150 --> 51:53.359
You must respect every Sahaja Yogi whether
he is from the black race or a white race

51:53.359 --> 52:01.079
or a blue race, whether he is from Spain or
from Italy or from India, or from any other

52:01.079 --> 52:11.290
place, whether he is from Jew religion or
from Islamic religion, or any religion whatsoever,

52:11.290 --> 52:16.210
whether he’s a legitimate child or illegitimate.

52:16.210 --> 52:23.569
Whether he comes from aristocratic or a rich
or royal family, or from the poorest of poor.

52:23.569 --> 52:33.259
Whether he has money or no money.

52:33.259 --> 52:51.119
Whether he’s unwell or he’s all right,
whether he had a very bad past.

52:51.119 --> 52:54.950
Everything has to be forgotten, the past.

52:54.950 --> 53:02.559
They are all buddhas and all the buddhas must
be respected and surrendered to, to their wishes.

53:02.559 --> 53:11.619
I mean, I surrender to your wishes, all the
time, I have become now so desireless that

53:11.619 --> 53:18.779
I have to tell you that you better desire,
otherwise I am useless, I have no desires.

53:18.779 --> 53:25.359
As if My power of desire has gone into your
heads and I have nothing left.

53:25.359 --> 53:30.170
So you have to desire.

53:30.170 --> 53:35.470
Then the “Dhammam Sharanam Gachami” is
very important.

53:35.470 --> 53:41.339
What have you done for Vishwa Nirmala Dharma?

53:41.339 --> 53:54.999
Whatever [is] needed for the work of Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma, whether it is money, whether

53:54.999 --> 54:13.549
it is your house, any possession, whether
it is labour, any kind of labour.

54:13.549 --> 54:27.009
I see some people will do every sort of work,
and some people will never do it, whatever it is.

54:27.009 --> 54:30.479
So we should really have a roster.

54:30.479 --> 54:38.829
For example, one day all the leaders must
sweep.

54:38.829 --> 54:50.759
Second day all the ladies must sweep or do
something, so that when you have full idea

54:50.759 --> 54:54.430
as to how to respect each other.

54:54.430 --> 55:05.880
Also when you start doing something then you
really have respect.

55:05.880 --> 55:10.500
Very easy to criticise, very easy to criticise
others.

55:10.500 --> 55:16.650
I have seen people who can’t write two lines,
can criticise Shakespeare, can criticise Tukarama,

55:16.650 --> 55:17.969
can criticise Gyaneshwara.

55:17.969 --> 55:22.180
Two lines of poetry you can’t write, what
are you criticising?

55:22.180 --> 55:31.809
They can’t paint even with one colour are
criticising this, criticising that.

55:31.809 --> 55:34.670
I mean, how can you criticise anybody?

55:34.670 --> 55:44.670
The one who has given no Realisation to anyone,
done nothing, is criticising the leaders,

55:44.670 --> 55:49.930
arey baba (hindi: ‘oh Mr’), they have
given Realisation to so many people.

55:49.930 --> 55:51.799
How many people you have given Realisation?

55:51.799 --> 56:02.210
Please do little bit like of this like that
person then you can criticise.

56:02.210 --> 56:06.609
Everything is done through criticism.

56:06.609 --> 56:16.890
I think that is the worst thing that we can
do to ourselves because criticism, only, is

56:16.890 --> 56:25.349
the very depraved ego which takes to.

56:25.349 --> 56:30.729
There is no ahambhava, there is no “I-ness."

56:30.729 --> 56:31.729
All right.

56:31.729 --> 56:34.140
He has written such beautiful poetry.

56:34.140 --> 56:36.599
I’ll also write.

56:36.599 --> 56:37.599
No!

56:37.599 --> 56:43.910
“He’s written, but there is something,
this is not correct."

56:43.910 --> 56:47.009
Baba you write first two sentences like that!

56:47.009 --> 56:54.430
“Mother, his English is all right, but still”,
but what about your English?

56:54.430 --> 56:57.219
Or your Spanish?

56:57.219 --> 57:01.130
Do you know Spanish language, no?

57:01.130 --> 57:02.130
Then?

57:02.130 --> 57:08.109
If he doesn’t know English why should you
criticise?

57:08.109 --> 57:13.190
So the criticism part has killed all art,
as I’ve told you, killed everything, killed

57:13.190 --> 57:18.069
all our creativity, killed our personality,
we are all the time shaking.

57:18.069 --> 57:25.660
Nobody’s going to be there like Rembrandt,
or like Michelangelo, or Barbini, nobody.

57:25.660 --> 57:28.079
Because you make anything – criticism!

57:28.079 --> 57:35.259
In Australia, they made a very beautiful,
I must say, one of very sweet things they

57:35.259 --> 57:55.829
made, like you can call the ship, with sails,
a building there, for their opera.

57:55.829 --> 58:01.549
Even till today they are criticising it, and
whenever they have to give any picture of

58:01.549 --> 58:04.759
Australia, they give that picture!

58:04.759 --> 58:12.750
Is like they killed Marie Antoinette, and
if you have to go and see anything beautiful

58:12.750 --> 58:21.599
[in France] you have to go and see her palace!

58:21.599 --> 58:25.549
Criticism is all right if you are an expert
and a master.

58:25.549 --> 58:28.630
Alright, A master has a right, of course.

58:28.630 --> 58:40.300
But you, you haven’t got even the slightest
of that art, how can you criticise?

58:40.300 --> 58:50.150
So this depravity of the ego, you can see
in the life of Buddha, who was light, who

58:50.150 --> 58:57.170
was enlightenment, who was compassion, who
was knowledge, who was joy.

58:57.170 --> 59:06.130
In His life, you see, He never criticised
anyone.

59:06.130 --> 59:22.200
He left it to Me, this horrible job of criticising
all the bhoots and rakshasas and devils.

59:22.200 --> 59:26.650
He just took a easier course.

59:26.650 --> 59:29.349
Why to fight the wall?

59:29.349 --> 59:30.789
Leave it alone.

59:30.789 --> 59:34.249
I wish I could do that but could not.

59:34.249 --> 59:35.249
I have tried.

59:35.249 --> 59:41.780
First three years I tried, but you just can’t
help it, you just have to fight it out.

59:41.780 --> 59:44.279
But you don’t criticise each other.

59:44.279 --> 59:53.900
I feel very hurt, Myself, as if My one hand
is criticising another.

59:53.900 --> 01:00:03.019
I can go on talking about Buddha for days
together.

01:00:03.019 --> 01:00:06.920
There’s no end to it.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:22.059
He’s the one who has taught us so many beautiful
things by His own life, and if you have to

01:00:22.059 --> 01:00:44.130
really imbibe His Spirit within ourselves,
we have to have that detachment from within.

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:50.859
As every religion is ruined by the followers,
Buddha, who said: don’t worship – even

01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:52.140
don’t talk of God.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:55.569
He said don’t talk of God, just talk of
Self-realisation.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:01:01.119
First let them have Self-Realisation and don’t
worship anything.

01:01:01.119 --> 01:01:08.160
He said, “Just don’t worship,” because
He knew there was nothing to be worshipable.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:14.859
But they have got stupas and they worship
this and they worship that and worship this.

01:01:14.859 --> 01:01:19.130
There’s no end to it.

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:20.930
They said, “These are the teeth of Buddha."

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:23.489
I mean, how can you have teeth of Buddha?

01:01:23.489 --> 01:01:27.989
When Buddha died, you mean He took out his
teeth or what?

01:01:27.989 --> 01:01:30.450
And this is Buddha’s teeth they are worshiping.

01:01:30.450 --> 01:01:34.479
There’s no vibrations, I saw it, it was
nothing.

01:01:34.479 --> 01:01:42.580
I can understand hair, or nails, but His teeth
are everywhere being worshipped!

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.670
I know My Sahaja Yogis cannot spoil much of
Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:51.109
If they do, they will lose their vibrations.

01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:53.450
So be careful on that!

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:57.690
But with ego, I’ve seen people even they
lose their vibrations [will say], “No I’m

01:01:57.690 --> 01:02:06.589
alright, oh, I’m getting all the vibrations,
I’m alright!” and here is such a big…befooling

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:18.950
yourself is the job of ego, so be careful,
“I am alright, nothing wrong with me."

01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:27.230
On today’s great occasion, let us think
of the hazardous time He had and the way He

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:31.640
has created for us this Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:42.589
That we are bathing in the light of their
compassion, their hard work, their dedication,

01:02:42.589 --> 01:02:48.499
their sacrifices, all that.

01:02:48.499 --> 01:02:53.059
The Truth is going to make us beautiful.

01:02:53.059 --> 01:02:57.869
May God Bless You!

01:02:57.869 --> 01:03:04.490
Are you feeling very hot?

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.289
Alright?

01:03:06.289 --> 01:03:12.769
You can put your hands towards Me, it’s
air conditioner working.

01:03:12.769 --> 01:03:17.509
(Laughter) I am feeling frozen here, actually.

01:03:17.509 --> 01:03:23.089
I am just thinking all these beautiful things
you have given Me.

01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:26.049
Buddha never had them.

01:03:26.049 --> 01:03:32.150
He never had any comforts.

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:35.229
So now we have to show that we are worthy.

01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:41.680
That’s the word he used, arihant, arahant,
the worthy.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:48.369
Are you worthy, worthy of Sahaja Yoga?

01:03:48.369 --> 01:03:52.240
We have to be worthy of Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.260
Arahant is the word.

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:59.640
Puja ka shru karana?

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.549
Should we have the Puja now?

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:10.349
Talking about Buddha has cooled Me down completely.

01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:11.799
Ekdam baraf!

01:04:11.799 --> 01:04:12.799
Ice!

01:04:12.799 --> 01:04:21.440
Put your hands like this, all of you, while
doing the puja.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:35.239
And you don’t have to close your eyes during
puja, it’s very important.

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:41.809
And also not to put down your heads, because
you are all Sahaja Yogis.

01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:49.069
Feeling really very cold, I don’t know,
what about you people?

01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:50.900
Feeling hot?

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.729
Yogi: No.

01:04:52.729 --> 01:04:56.380
Shri Mataji: It’s good.

01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:00.039
I tried to change.

01:05:00.039 --> 01:05:05.519
Sometimes I overdo it, I think.

01:05:05.519 --> 01:05:10.089
I did it 21 times.

01:05:10.089 --> 01:05:11.089
Alright.

01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:16.990
So the Puja should start with the Spanish
people.

01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:21.890
Jose, come along, but you have no wife, but
it’s all right, doesn’t matter.
