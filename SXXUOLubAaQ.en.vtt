EXCERPTS ON SHRI MATAJI'S PHOTOGRAPH

00:17.672 --> 00:22.637
Any other question please? Yes, please –
little loudly…

00:22.847 --> 00:25.179
Seeker: Why is Your picture sitting
on the table next to You?

00:25.380 --> 00:26.720
Can you say loudly, please?

00:26.921 --> 00:29.285
Seeker: Why is Your picture sitting
on the table next to You?

00:29.486 --> 00:33.875
Shri Mataji: What's it…? yogi: Why is Your
picture sitting on the table next to You?

00:34.076 --> 00:37.052
Why, you don’t like it?

00:41.904 --> 00:45.749
It’s something, it’s a question really
something I can’t understand.

00:45.950 --> 00:51.601
You see, if I am something, if this
picture is my true picture,

00:52.209 --> 00:57.028
then why not have it? With this picture,
you’ll be surprised,

00:57.229 --> 01:00.328
the person who first got realization got
through this picture.

01:00.576 --> 01:04.775
In this picture there are vibrations. When
you will get realized, you will know

01:04.976 --> 01:08.136
that only this picture has such vibrations
because the real thing it is –

01:08.337 --> 01:10.953
thank God the science has given us
the real thing.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.055
If there were cameras before, we would
have had pictures

01:14.256 --> 01:17.423
of all those great people. Because there
were no photographs

01:17.624 --> 01:19.516
they said, “Better not have any pictures.”

01:19.717 --> 01:22.322
Because all the pictures were imaginary,
done by people

01:22.523 --> 01:25.014
who wanted to have some money.

01:25.754 --> 01:31.346
With this picture, many people have been
cured. All right?

01:31.568 --> 01:35.078
It’s a very good thing that has happened
that we can take pictures now

01:35.279 --> 01:38.408
because I think, I cannot meet everyone
in this world,

01:38.609 --> 01:40.766
but they can at least see my picture.

01:41.620 --> 01:47.279
Question: Can we just clarify that do you
claim that you can heal or cure?

01:47.587 --> 01:50.794
Shri Mataji: I do not claim; I do it.

01:50.995 --> 01:54.846
No question of claiming, you see. I do it.
I’ve done it.

01:55.047 --> 01:59.000
You can do it also. Everyone can do it.

01:59.201 --> 02:02.940
This Doctor Warren has done. He’s cured
so many people.

02:03.141 --> 02:05.651
Question: And you said it can be done
through the photograph.

02:05.852 --> 02:08.594
Would you explain that? Shri Mataji: Yes,
it is surprising, you know.

02:08.795 --> 02:13.182
Myself I was surprised, as you are, that
my photograph has also got vibrations

02:13.383 --> 02:15.680
and people get cured with photographs.

02:15.881 --> 02:20.540
In your country only when I came,
the press was very kind to me.

02:20.741 --> 02:24.196
The reason was there was a lady who
was sick with coma.

02:24.397 --> 02:29.399
And they said she had what … Yogi: Cerebral
aneurism. Shri Mataji: Aneurism.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.491
And one another disciple of mine

02:33.692 --> 02:36.101
took my photograph, put it under her head.

02:36.302 --> 02:42.305
And she started getting all right in the
sense that she started opening her eyes.

02:42.506 --> 02:45.803
So the doctors got frightened. They said,
“Even if she gets all right,

02:46.004 --> 02:48.996
she will be damaged. She won’t be able
to walk.”

02:49.197 --> 02:51.632
But today she’s perfectly all right.
Not only that,

02:51.833 --> 02:56.055
but she is very hard-working sahaja
yogini so she is all right.

02:56.256 --> 03:00.177
Question: How does it work? Shri Mataji:
It was in … Yogi: How does it work?

03:00.378 --> 03:04.119
How does it work from the photograph?
Shri Mataji: From the photograph?

03:04.882 --> 03:08.664
The photograph is a real image of myself,
you see,

03:08.865 --> 03:13.463
and this, my body, has got a coefficients
which emits vibrations.

03:13.664 --> 03:19.821
Same happens with the photograph.
That too has the same coefficients.

03:20.022 --> 03:22.781
Of course, it hasn’t got the other
dimension,

03:22.982 --> 03:29.482
but it also emits the vibrations because
of the coefficients being the same.

03:29.683 --> 03:32.014
Say, even if you take Christ’s photograph,
it’s not real

03:32.215 --> 03:34.821
because it has come out of the unconscious,
all right,

03:35.022 --> 03:36.914
but that’s a lot of imagination put in.

03:37.115 --> 03:40.866
Any photograph, if you take of any person
it is like that.

03:41.067 --> 03:46.234
But there are so many things I’ve seen
which have come out of the Mother Earth,

03:46.435 --> 03:52.432
they emit vibrations. Like Stonehenge
in England has vibrations.

03:52.648 --> 03:55.761
So many places like that have vibrations,
but not so strong as mine,

03:55.962 --> 03:58.125
because I’m a living person.

03:59.106 --> 04:05.531
There was one fellow in Russia,

04:05.732 --> 04:08.207
supposed to be very intelligent,

04:08.408 --> 04:11.148
he said that: “Alright, if we keep Mother’s
photograph

04:11.349 --> 04:15.772
and also the icons, we can get the same
type of vibrations.”

04:15.973 --> 04:20.758
You cannot, because icons are made

04:20.959 --> 04:23.791
by some artist’s imaginary.

04:23.993 --> 04:28.540
These are not representing actually even
Maria or Christ or anyone,

04:28.741 --> 04:31.372
they are all, all imaginary.

04:31.573 --> 04:37.231
If Italian ones makes Christ, He is Italian
style,

04:37.432 --> 04:42.947
if some French one makes, He is thin
like French man,

04:43.155 --> 04:50.822
if you get somebody say from Holland,
He will have a forehead like that.

04:52.177 --> 04:58.399
So you can see Christ if He’s Japanese,
He’ll have chinky eyes,

05:00.474 --> 05:04.136
if He’s Chinese, He’ll have no nose,

05:05.540 --> 05:11.918
if it’s Indian, He’ll be dark. So all kinds
of Christs I have seen

05:12.119 --> 05:18.018
and I feel that, "How can they emit
vibrations?" Tell me.

05:19.719 --> 05:22.496
While with my photograph, how can you
compare?

05:22.697 --> 05:26.047
Also, cameras were to be developed
at this time:

05:26.248 --> 05:28.490
do you notice that point?

05:28.691 --> 05:33.699
Cameras were developed at this time,
not before that.

05:33.969 --> 05:38.225
This loudspeaker was not developed before
this.

05:38.710 --> 05:41.728
So all these things are – even video,

05:41.929 --> 05:45.403
even the way you are seeing my image there,

05:45.604 --> 05:48.625
was that available before? No.

05:51.363 --> 05:58.131
So this is a very special time, where
science has also supported

05:58.390 --> 06:01.546
seekers to find the Truth – science has
supported.

06:01.867 --> 06:06.767
So first, just like a scientist, to try
to accept one by… there is nothing

06:06.968 --> 06:09.856
has to be done, I mean, you do not have
to pay me anything of course, that goes...

06:10.057 --> 06:13.307
You don't have to do any acrobatics
or anything.

06:13.508 --> 06:15.385
But for example a small thing like
my photograph,

06:15.586 --> 06:17.448
you see, many people say, “Why Your
photographs?”

06:17.649 --> 06:20.535
So “Use your photograph” I say, if that
works out, you see.

06:20.736 --> 06:21.935
It's something surprising:

06:22.136 --> 06:23.980
that’s how people are challenging me:
“Why Your photograph?”.

06:24.181 --> 06:26.525
“Why don’t you use yours? I will be very
happy, use anybody’s”…

06:26.726 --> 06:30.307
… but doesn’t work out, what to do now?
Is my photograph that works out,

06:30.508 --> 06:34.907
but even if you don't like it, you have
to use it – what can I do?

06:36.030 --> 06:40.129
Is as simple like that, you see; but
in that I don't gain anything from you,

06:40.330 --> 06:45.247
I don't want anything from you, nothing
material that you can give me.

06:45.448 --> 06:48.949
But you'll enjoy, you will enjoy my love,
you'll enjoy.

06:49.407 --> 06:55.880
But Sahaja Yoga is becoming, is awakening
and Realisation.

06:56.131 --> 06:59.455
How is it going to work out? It was a very
big problem for me.

06:59.656 --> 07:02.307
It’s not that I can just give you a book
and just sit

07:02.481 --> 07:06.616
and read it and say that, “Yes, I have
got it, I have become.”

07:06.817 --> 07:12.252
It’s real becoming, ripening, maturing,
living process.

07:12.453 --> 07:14.911
Now how am I to do it?

07:16.005 --> 07:19.980
And here is the answer – is a photograph.

07:21.020 --> 07:27.192
So this is what it is, that all your medias
can be used

07:28.378 --> 07:32.399
through my photograph. What a blessing
it is!

07:32.682 --> 07:36.943
And the photograph, if you think,
is representing me,

07:37.144 --> 07:40.755
I think you are not expressing it fully.

07:42.310 --> 07:46.473
I was amazed that my photographs are
much more powerful

07:46.737 --> 07:51.517
than any statues put together – even
produced by Mother Earth!

07:54.892 --> 08:00.103
Because photograph has got so many
elements in it.

08:00.304 --> 08:06.486
For example, you see, it has got light
element,

08:06.687 --> 08:12.232
it has got water element, it has got earth
element,

08:14.039 --> 08:17.180
it has got also air element.

08:18.356 --> 08:22.344
If the air is not all right, you cannot get
a photograph.

08:25.105 --> 08:29.719
And also it has got the ether element.

08:34.103 --> 08:39.452
With all these five elements, you cannot
produce a statue.

08:44.003 --> 08:48.275
Ether element it has got because if you
have a photograph here,

08:48.476 --> 08:51.555
you can transcend it to any other place
you can –

08:51.756 --> 08:55.981
what do you call that? – transmit it
to any place.

08:56.214 --> 08:57.574
Photograph can be transmitted.

08:57.775 --> 09:01.100
But you cannot transmit the statue as it is
anywhere,

09:01.308 --> 09:04.640
only the photograph of a statue you can.

09:06.788 --> 09:09.752
So it has also got ether element.

09:11.868 --> 09:18.244
So photograph is much more powerful than
any other statue.

09:20.051 --> 09:24.043
Moreover, it is a reproduction, no doubt,

09:25.344 --> 09:30.548
but reproduction of reality, with five
elements.

09:33.722 --> 09:35.946
So I shouldn’t call it just
a representative,

09:36.147 --> 09:41.447
it’s quite me. Because my attention is
there.

09:41.693 --> 09:45.361
So the protocol of these photographs
also is important

09:45.592 --> 09:49.429
to start developing that faith.

09:49.630 --> 09:57.994
You should keep one photograph with you
all the time in your pocket. Respect it.

09:59.869 --> 10:03.450
As many as possible, respect them.
