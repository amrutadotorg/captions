00:08.831 --> 00:17.880
We have within ourselves seven centers, placed
in our medulla oblongata and in the brain.

00:18.248 --> 00:24.602
The first one lies below the triangular
bone, which is called as sacrum,

00:24.960 --> 00:32.940
and it’s called as the Mooladhara center,
which means "the support of the roots".

00:33.480 --> 00:36.367
It is the support of the roots.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.440
And this center embodies our innocence.

00:43.320 --> 00:50.605
The second one … and of course it manifests
outside in the gross, the pelvic plexus.

00:51.720 --> 00:56.817
Now, the second one is the one
that emerges from the third one,

00:56.880 --> 01:01.253
which is called as the
Nabhi Chakra, the third one;

01:02.640 --> 01:10.486
and the one that emerges from that is the
second one, called as the Swadishthana.

01:11.340 --> 01:15.840
Now, the Swadishthana Chakra in the gross
— because these are subtle centers, in the

01:15.840 --> 01:25.620
medulla oblongata — but outside, in the gross,
it manifests what we call the aortic plexus.

01:25.620 --> 01:29.770
If there are doctors here, they’ll
understand what I’m talking about.

01:30.000 --> 01:38.472
Now, if you go further, the Nabhi Chakra manifests
outside what we call as the solar plexus.

01:38.760 --> 01:45.960
Above that is the center that we call
as the Heart center, Anahata Chakra,

01:45.960 --> 01:54.000
cardiac center, which manifests
outside the cardiac plexus.

01:54.180 --> 01:57.717
And it has got, again, the left and right side.

01:58.260 --> 02:03.791
Then we have the center at the root of our neck,

02:04.140 --> 02:13.839
which is called as the Vishuddhi Chakra and
which manifests outside the cervical plexus.

02:14.460 --> 02:21.180
Above that, here where you see the red mark on My
head — this is just the window of that center —

02:21.180 --> 02:27.812
between the pituitary and the pineal body, where
the optic chiasma cross each other in the center,

02:27.960 --> 02:35.940
is a very important center called as Agnya
Chakra, which looks after our ego and our

02:35.940 --> 02:42.000
superego, which you can see there passing
through that, crossing over like that.

02:42.120 --> 02:48.288
And on the top of that is the last
seventh center, called as the Sahasrara,

02:48.960 --> 02:52.398
meaning "one thousand petals center".

02:52.500 --> 02:56.365
And that’s the center … is just

02:56.520 --> 03:03.531
in the limbic area, and when you pierce
through that in the fontanelle area,

03:04.020 --> 03:11.471
you feel the cool breeze of the Kundalini,
or the Holy Ghost, coming out of your head.

03:12.900 --> 03:15.885
This has to happen.

03:17.760 --> 03:20.100
You cannot give false certificates.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.393
You have to feel the cool
breeze coming out of your head.

03:24.540 --> 03:30.060
You have to feel the cool breeze in your
hands; that means you have to feel the

03:30.060 --> 03:39.647
all-pervading Power of God, of Love, which is
called as Brahma Shakti in Sanskrit language

03:39.780 --> 03:45.150
and in the Bible is called as the
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

03:45.660 --> 03:54.000
For the first time you have to feel it in
your hands, in your central nervous system.

03:54.360 --> 04:03.517
Because the seat of your Spirit is here,
but the Spirit resides in the heart.

04:03.780 --> 04:10.440
Once the seat is touched by the awakened Kundalini
— which is in the triangular bone, if you see —

04:10.440 --> 04:14.940
then you start feeling the first the cool breeze

04:15.480 --> 04:21.180
and then in the hand, you start feeling
the cool breeze flowing from you.

04:21.180 --> 04:25.799
Thus you manifest the power of your Spirit.

04:27.420 --> 04:30.460
It’s a happening that has to take place.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.178
It’s a living happening.
