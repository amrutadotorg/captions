00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:17.880
We have within ourselves seven centers, placed&nbsp;
in our medulla oblongata and in the brain.

00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:24.602
The first one lies below the triangular&nbsp;
bone, which is called as sacrum,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.940
and it’s called as the Mooladhara center,&nbsp;
which means "the support of the roots".

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.367
It is the support of the roots.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.440
And this center embodies our innocence.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.605
The second one … and of course it manifests&nbsp;
outside in the gross, the pelvic plexus.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.817
Now, the second one is the one&nbsp;
that emerges from the third one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.253
which is called as the&nbsp;
Nabhi Chakra, the third one;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.486
and the one that emerges from that is the&nbsp;
second one, called as the Swadishthana.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.840
Now, the Swadishthana Chakra in the gross&nbsp;
— because these are subtle centers, in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:25.620
medulla oblongata — but outside, in the gross,&nbsp;
it manifests what we call the aortic plexus.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.770
If there are doctors here, they’ll&nbsp;
understand what I’m talking about.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.472
Now, if you go further, the Nabhi Chakra manifests&nbsp;
outside what we call as the solar plexus.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.960
Above that is the center that we call&nbsp;
as the Heart center, Anahata Chakra,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:54.000
cardiac center, which manifests&nbsp;
outside the cardiac plexus.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.717
And it has got, again, the left and right side.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.791
Then we have the center at the root of our neck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:13.839
which is called as the Vishuddhi Chakra and&nbsp;
which manifests outside the cervical plexus.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.180
Above that, here where you see the red mark on My&nbsp;
head — this is just the window of that center —&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.812
between the pituitary and the pineal body, where&nbsp;
the optic chiasma cross each other in the center,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.940
is a very important center called as Agnya&nbsp;
Chakra, which looks after our ego and our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.000
superego, which you can see there passing&nbsp;
through that, crossing over like that.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.288
And on the top of that is the last&nbsp;
seventh center, called as the Sahasrara,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.398
meaning "one thousand petals center".

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.365
And that’s the center … is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.531
in the limbic area, and when you pierce&nbsp;
through that in the fontanelle area,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.471
you feel the cool breeze of the Kundalini,&nbsp;
or the Holy Ghost, coming out of your head.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.885
This has to happen.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.100
You cannot give false certificates.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.393
You have to feel the cool&nbsp;
breeze coming out of your head.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.060
You have to feel the cool breeze in your&nbsp;
hands; that means you have to feel the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:39.647
all-pervading Power of God, of Love, which is&nbsp;
called as Brahma Shakti in Sanskrit language&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.150
and in the Bible is called as the&nbsp;
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:54.000
For the first time you have to feel it in&nbsp;
your hands, in your central nervous system.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:03.517
Because the seat of your Spirit is here,&nbsp;
but the Spirit resides in the heart.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.440
Once the seat is touched by the awakened Kundalini&nbsp;
— which is in the triangular bone, if you see —&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.940
then you start feeling the first the cool breeze&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.180
and then in the hand, you start feeling&nbsp;
the cool breeze flowing from you.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.799
Thus you manifest the power of your Spirit.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.460
It’s a happening that has to take place.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.178
It’s a living happening.
