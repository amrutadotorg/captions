1
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,480
I thank all the Sahaja Yogis

2
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,680
from Derbyshire and Birmingham

3
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,120
for giving Me this opportunity to talk to the seekers of this place.

4
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,880
We have seekers in the modern times,

5
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,400
is something very unique.

6
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,680
We never had seekers before,

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,760
at least not so many.

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,400
There used to be people

9
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,560
who would seek money, as there are many who are seeking these days,

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,160
who would seek countries after countries, the power.

11
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,440
There were (not) many who were seeking these

12
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:20,800
few pearls of bliss of God, very few.

13
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,720
The reason was the awareness,

14
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,480
the collective awareness of human beings

15
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,960
did not think themselves perhaps capable

16
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,880
or perhaps needing some seeking.

17
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,720
But today it's such a beautiful combination

18
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,720
that there are seekers of very high quality born on this earth.

19
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,800
Those who are seeking are in masses.

20
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,480
They are not one or two here and there

21
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,480
sitting on top of a mountain,

22
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,240
cave or something and trying to meditate,

23
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,640
but there are so many who are seeking,

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,040
who feel dissatisfied with themselves, with whatever they have.

25
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,320
They think there must be something beyond.

26
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,440
Those who feel that they have not yet found their meaning,

27
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,200
those who feel they have to find the purpose of their life,

28
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,280
those who feel

29
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,960
that there has to be something higher

30
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,680
than what they are into,

31
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:49,840
all such people are seekers, not of today but of thousands of years.

32
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,360
At the time of Christ there were none, I should say,

33
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,640
because even the ones Christ took as His disciples,

34
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,840
they were actually forced into it;

35
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,840
and He had to go and seek them and find them out

36
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,960
and tell them about it.

37
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,360
So we have to say that these are very important times

38
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
in the history of creation,

39
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,200
where there are so many seekers.

40
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,080
But the problem with the seekers today is this

41
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,920
that they don't know what they are seeking.

42
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,240
They have no idea as to what to seek,

43
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,600
how to seek, what to expect.

44
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,320
It's an unknown area they are entering into.

45
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,040
It's very unknown to them.

46
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,760
And this unknown area which they are seeking

47
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,600
is now represented by so many people.

48
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,400
Everyone says, "I'm the one who will deliver the goods."

49
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,120
Another one says, "I'm the one who can do it."

50
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,520
Naturally confusion is created,

51
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,400
as it is, modern times are the times of confusion, great confusion.

52
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,000
And when there such a confusion comes in, then only we find out

53
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,200
a great solution also, a permanent solution

54
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,840
to solve the problem once for all.

55
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,520
There has been never such confusion in the minds of human beings

56
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,120
as it is today as to the right or wrong. Never so much.

57
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,880
Whatever was said, "This was not good," they would do,

58
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,400
knowingly that they are doing wrong.

59
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,280
If they were good people, they would say,

60
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,440
"All right, this is good, we'll do the good."

61
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,560
But everybody knew that this was wrong or right. They may do it.

62
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,080
But today no one knows what is wrong and what is right.

63
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,480
Apart from wrong and right, it's much beyond that,

64
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,640
you have to know yourself.

65
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,840
Because this awareness is within us that we do not know ourselves,

66
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,120
we do not know the absolute. We live in a relative world.

67
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,840
Of this everybody seems to be conscious,

68
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,240
maybe in the subconscious or maybe in the unconscious,

69
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
but definitely there's a feeling in every one of us

70
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,960
that "We do not know."

71
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,720
And it's a very honest feeling,

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,240
it's a very sublime feeling

73
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,000
that we have to know something more.

74
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,680
Now when we say the word "know," we think as if I would say,

75
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,280
"I don't know about Derbyshire, I have never been there."

76
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,880
Now this means what?

77
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,840
I don't know about Derbyshire.

78
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,920
What don't I know about Derbyshire?

79
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
I can read it in the books, I can find out.

80
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,560
I can know all the history of Derbyshire.

81
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,960
I can find out who were the people who,

82
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,080
who were making beautiful porcelain here,

83
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,920
I can find out all about their history,

84
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,520
everything I can read about it.

85
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,080
Still, why should I say I don't know anything about Derbyshire?

86
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,880
Because I have not been to Derbyshire before.

87
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,960
I have not been to Derby, I have not been to this area,

88
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,920
I have not seen this place, I have not visited it,

89
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,360
I have had no experience of this place, so I don't know about it.

90
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,280
This is exactly what is the situation.

91
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,280
The situation is that we do not know about the Divine.

92
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,480
We have read about it, we have heard about it.

93
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,440
So many people have written about it.

94
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,080
Once they know there's an enquiry about it,

95
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,600
they come out with books. Books after books,

96
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,880
thousands of books they have written.

97
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,200
How many of them are true and how many of them are untrue?

98
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,360
It is impossible to find out,

99
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,120
because we do not actually know.

100
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,880
Supposing somebody says

101
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,560
that Duke of Bedford was born in Derbyshire.

102
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,880
Alright, how will I know?

103
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
I would not know till I meet somebody

104
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,280
who is really belonging to that place, who knows about it.

105
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,920
In the same way, the knowledge that we have

106
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,920
also about Divine is very confusing.

107
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,200
But this is not knowledge, this is never the knowledge.

108
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,440
The idea of knowledge comes to us

109
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:14,280
as if it is a kind of an answer to our enquiries

110
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,520
which is rational, which we can understand intelligently

111
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,560
through our intelligence.

112
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,760
But now this area is beyond intelligence, beyond rationality,

113
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:30,560
beyond all that is limited - is the unlimited area.

114
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,840
All such unlimited areas can be only known

115
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,720
by experience of your awareness.

116
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,200
Now this one should understand is a very delicate thing,

117
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,960
how to know something, an experience of our awareness.

118
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,240
Not an experience, they suddenly see a light, so it's an experience.

119
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,200
I mean, you can always see a light!

120
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,920
So great the people feel about it that they have seen some light

121
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,400
suddenly sparking before them. Nothing so great.

122
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,680
There could be some area from there a sparking can come,

123
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,280
and maybe it is of no use to you,

124
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,960
but just you might feel that you have experienced.

125
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,160
So one must know that seeing is not experiencing.

126
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,600
For example, a dog sees this instrument,

127
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,080
but what does he know about it? He sees it.

128
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,080
Awareness, the human awareness

129
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,080
has so many great things about itself,

130
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,960
compared to the animal awareness.

131
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,760
For example, we can say the awareness of beauty - animals don't have,

132
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,880
awareness of cleanliness - animals don't have.

133
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,320
Human beings have these

134
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,480
built within themselves, they can feel it.

135
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,800
They can feel it on their central nervous system.

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,920
So whatever is your awareness,

137
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,840
is to be felt on your central nervous system.

138
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,120
It's not just an imaginary thing

139
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,520
or an intellectual discussion,

140
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,320
"Ah, yes, yes, I know, I know" - not that way.

141
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,400
The knowledge should come to you through your feelings,

142
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,640
like I can feel this is hot or cold,

143
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,400
but a stone will not feel anything.

144
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,680
In the same way, the feeling has to come

145
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,360
through your central nervous system.

146
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,480
That means your awareness itself is to be going, has to be charged.

147
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,760
It has to get a new dimension;

148
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,320
your awareness itself has to get a new dimension.

149
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,880
All other experiences

150
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,240
have no meaning whatsoever in evolution, if you see.

151
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:49,320
In evolutionary process it is the awareness that improves,

152
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,360
receives better and better dimensions.

153
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,240
And these dimensions have reached its maximum

154
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,840
at the time when you become a human being,

155
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,880
where your awareness is just ready to receive

156
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,720
the awareness of the Universal Being, of the Collective Being,

157
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,720
so that you become the collective being.

158
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,080
Now I would like to tell you about this within ourselves,

159
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,760
how we are placed.

160
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,720
For every practical purposes

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,400
you should not take Me for granted,

162
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,480
but you should not also deny what I tell you.

163
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,880
It's like entering into a new university:

164
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,840
We listen to the professor and we try to follow him.

165
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,520
Supposing he propounded,

166
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,960
he propounds a hypothesis before you,

167
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:50,600
then you just start judging it, work it out.

168
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:58,040
If it is true, then you call it a law.

169
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:04,680
In the same way, we should enter into this new understanding

170
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,440
by first seeing it, not denying it.

171
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,120
then if it is true, then we have to believe it.

172
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,240
There should be no blind faith about Sahaja Yoga.

173
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,880
Blind faith does not help at all.

174
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,960
Neither there should be a denial.

175
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,320
And with that cheerful attitude

176
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,960
if you just listen to Me as a hypothesis whatever I'm telling you,

177
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,880
you need not accept it as truth just now.

178
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,080
But then the time has come for Me to prove the truth to you!

179
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,360
And the truth can be proved to you.

180
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,640
Time has come to prove the existence of God;

181
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,880
to prove, not prove that I give you a big lecture

182
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,560
or take you to courts or some sort of a thing like that,

183
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,720
but how am I going to prove it? On your awareness.

184
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,480
It is going to be absolute experience of your awareness

185
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:07,800
that you are going to feel God Almighty!

186
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,640
Time has come to prove the scriptures, all the scriptures.

187
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,840
The time has come to prove your own connection with God,

188
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,320
your own relationship with Him,

189
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,840
your own relationship with that Primordial Being,

190
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,920
whether you call it "God" or anything,

191
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,640
it makes no difference to God Himself.

192
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,800
Whether you call Him by any name, there is God,

193
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,280
and that God is not the way you conceive God,

194
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,920
it's not the way you understand God or you know God,

195
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,240
but is the God as He is.

196
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,880
Unless and until you yourself feel Him,

197
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,960
you are not going to believe in Him.

198
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,880
Even if you believe under certain circumstances,

199
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,040
it's a belief that is blind.

200
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,640
It has no meaning for any intelligent person,

201
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,600
and the day will come that such a person

202
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,200
is going to denounce that kind of a blind faith.

203
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,680
So now within ourselves, as I said,

204
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,680
is a built-in system which has come to us

205
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,920
through our ascent in our awareness at different stages,

206
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,640
which is like a history written within ourselves

207
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,160
how we become human beings.

208
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,880
Into different stages we were divided.

209
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,240
First of all the stage of the carbon,

210
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,480
where we became alive,

211
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,880
the dead became the life.

212
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,240
That is placed at that point.

213
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,080
It is below that great power within us

214
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,600
which lies in the triangular bone, which we call as Kundalini.

215
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,280
This power is the power also described in the Bible

216
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,400
as the 'Tree of Life',

217
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,960
'I'll appear before you like tongues of flames',

218
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,080
but Bible being a very microscopic thing,

219
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,960
it cannot be explained, the symbolism of that,

220
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,040
unless and until you get your new awareness

221
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,160
or the vibratory awareness, it cannot be explained.

222
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,400
Now this power is the power of desire,

223
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,560
of the ultimate desire, the only desire, the real desire

224
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
that we have within ourselves.

225
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,720
All other desires become useless.

226
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,960
See in the affluent countries now

227
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,760
people have achieved affluence; they are rich, well-to-do;

228
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,960
but they are not happy.

229
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,720
People who are extremely affluent like in Sweden

230
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,600
and in Switzerland, they're competing among themselves,

231
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,080
how many youths are going to commit suicide!

232
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,120
Recently I learnt that Swiss people are "better off"-

233
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,280
many more Swiss people are committing suicide

234
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,600
than the people who were young people in Sweden.

235
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,520
This is the state where we should realise that affluence,

236
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,560
if it was our desire, is not the real desire;

237
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,840
because when we got the affluence

238
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,680
we should have been very happy and joyous people.

239
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,560
But we are not.

240
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,680
And the basics of economics is that

241
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,960
wants in particular may be satiable,

242
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,840
but in general they are never satiable,

243
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,360
means, matter cannot satisfy your wants.

244
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,600
So what is the want, what is the seeking one has?

245
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,280
Is hidden in this power,

246
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,760
and that is the seeking to become one with God,

247
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,840
the yoga, the union with God,

248
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,160
what we call the baptism.

249
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,240
In the Koran it's called as the pir.

250
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,800
You have to become the pir, the "twice born."

251
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,920
It is described in various languages,

252
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,960
but the same thing that they have described

253
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,640
is the same in every scripture.

254
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,240
If you try to follow what it means,

255
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,800
you'll be amazed that they all said the same things.

256
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,080
Now somebody might say, 'There might be some other methods, Mother,

257
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,160
it can be something else that can work it out.'

258
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,040
There's no other method,

259
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,480
because this has been worked out for thousands and thousands of years

260
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,160
within yourselves since you became carbon.

261
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,720
And it's all arranged within you by nature.

262
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,760
Like somebody can say that a seed has to sprout

263
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,600
by some other method - there is no other method for a seed.

264
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,520
The seed has got a primule and the primule has to be awakened,

265
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,960
is the only way it works out.

266
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,920
In the same way it is going to work out in all of you.

267
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,760
This power is to be shaken within you,

268
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
it is to be awakened within you.

269
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,960
If it is awakened within you, it rises.

270
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,360
But what is this power?

271
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,320
This power is to become one with the Spirit.

272
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,120
So this power knows that it has to become

273
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,800
one with the Divine.

274
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,600
Now we have so many other desires,

275
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,480
so we should say, how is it related to that?

276
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,720
It's like this, that we have to say,

277
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,360
'Come to Derbyshire and meet you all, people.'

278
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Now we come all the way, we come up to Guildhall,

279
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,440
come up here, and don't meet you.

280
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,240
Then all My coming,

281
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,720
all My travelling is useless because I've not met you.

282
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,720
It has no meaning whatsoever.

283
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:01,120
In the same way all other desires

284
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,840
are just to accomplish this desire, the ultimate desire,

285
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,280
the desire to become one with the Divine.

286
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,000
Lots of things can be said about Kundalini.

287
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,480
I must have spoken hundreds of times about Kundalini,

288
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,240
and to know more about it

289
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
you will have to get to Sahaja Yoga and know more about it.

290
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,320
But just now I have told you in brief what is this Kundalini,

291
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,760
and how it is placed there.

292
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,880
Now the, above that is the second -

293
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,760
actually the second one we treat as the third one, it looks here -

294
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,600
is the power of,

295
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:51,480
I would say,  (inaudible) this is the centre of our seeking.

296
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,800
This centre is called as the Nabhi Chakra,

297
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,400
which gives us our seeking.

298
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,960
When we are in the state of animal,

299
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,200
then we seek food through our stomach.

300
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,960
And you will be amazed then when we become human beings

301
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,680
also we seek our money through our stomach.

302
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,280
We may get little diverted here and there,

303
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,840
but ultimately we even seek our God through our stomach.

304
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:33,960
Surrounding this stomach is the area where one has to cross.

305
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:40,880
And this area is actually the area of the Masters.

306
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,440
All the Primordial Masters were born in this area,

307
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,560
like Moses, Socrates.

308
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,840
There are main basic ten primordial beings,

309
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,720
who came on this earth,

310
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,760
who came to give us an idea as to our seeking, what we have to do.

311
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,400
Basically they came here to teach us how to balance ourselves,

312
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,200
how to balance, so we can ascend.

313
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,000
Now all these great prophets or primordial beings,

314
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,680
we should say they were the ones who were the masters,

315
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,280
they came to inform us

316
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,240
that if you cross too much onto the left side

317
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,360
or too much on the right side,

318
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,360
then you will be falling in your sustenance,

319
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,360
in your quality as a human being.

320
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,280
As a human being you have to have a sustenance,

321
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,800
and this is the centre that gradually unfolds

322
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,720
the sustenance from animal to higher animals

323
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,760
and to human stage, where a person starts realising

324
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,760
that these sustenance’s exist within us.

325
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,440
That's how all our laws have come.

326
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,040
The Ten Commandments of the Bible

327
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,880
are the ten sustenances that are within us.

328
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,280
These are the ten Gurus who came on this earth

329
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,560
to save human beings from getting out of the middle path,

330
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,800
going more to the left and more to the right.

331
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,880
Now the left side, as you see here,

332
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,880
is the side which is the emotional side within us,

333
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,840
is also the power of desire.

334
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,880
Is the emotional side which gives us our subconscious,

335
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,080
and beyond that is our collective subconscious.

336
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,560
On the right-hand side we have another power of action,

337
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,160
that our desire we try to put in the action,

338
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:50,960
and this power of action gives us our future

339
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,320
and sustains our physical and mental activities.

340
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,280
As a result of that we develop an institution

341
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,840
in our head called 'ego'.

342
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,840
Everyone has it, there's nothing to be frightened of.

343
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,520
When we do something, we feel we have done it

344
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,680
and that is a myth, but still we carry on with the myth

345
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,160
because we have not yet seen the reality.

346
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:27,600
The another one is the left-side power within us,

347
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,680
by which we receive the aggression of others,

348
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,360
by which we have our past,

349
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,600
gives us an institution as a by-product of our activity,

350
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,840
emotional activity,

351
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,200
an institution like a balloon you will see there,

352
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,800
called as 'super-ego'.

353
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,440
These two things meet in the head just like this

354
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,720
as you grow,

355
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,120
and the calcification takes place

356
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,960
on top of your head near the fontanel bone area,

357
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,800
and this soft area which is pulsating in childhood

358
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,560
becomes completely covered.

359
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,800
Thus you developed your I-ness, you become Mr. X, Y, Z and all that.

360
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,080
You develop your own freedom.

361
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,000
This is the freedom that you have achieved

362
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,320
to be Mr. X, Mr. Y, Mr. Z.

363
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,480
After achieving this you start using the second centre,

364
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,280
which is the centre of your creativity,

365
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,760
the centre of your action.

366
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,960
Animals do not have any ego.

367
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,080
Of course, if they live with human beings they may develop,

368
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,040
but otherwise they have no ego at all.

369
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,280
And if you do something wrong,

370
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,280
you feel hurt, you feel guilty. Animals never feel guilty

371
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,880
because it is in their nature to kill another animal,

372
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,080
it is in their nature to eat, so they never feel guilty.

373
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,040
It's only human beings who'll say, 'Oh, I should not have said this.

374
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,600
I should have not done this.'

375
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,880
This is only human quality that we feel guilty,

376
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,560
it is only human quality that we aggress others.

377
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,680
So the second centre comes into play by which you think,

378
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,880
and you think about the future, you plan.

379
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,920
Your physical -
I think it's too much now, can you stop it?

380
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,560
Can't you stop it? Better stop the light, it's too much.

381
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,320
I've been having this all throughout, it's too much)

382
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:50,840
- and you think; for that thinking you require energy,

383
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,720
and this energy you get from the cells of fats

384
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,920
that are in the stomach, which are converted for the use of brain.

385
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,800
And when this conversion takes place,

386
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,680
this poor centre has to work very hard.

387
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,960
When you think, this centre goes into action.

388
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,320
It has to work very, very hard for one work only,

389
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,880
and that is to look after the supply of fat cells.

390
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,880
-It's too many lights they have there. Can you put off these lights?

391
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,040
No, no, no, these three here ...

392
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,360
Thank you ... Still these are very much,

393
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,280
these if they can put off, it would be better.

394
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,760
No, no, these three. These three are too much.

395
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,680
There's no need at all, there's three, what is there?

396
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
I mean, they can’t see Me otherwise?

397
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:04,600
Can you not see Me? It's like, you feel like
shooting!

398
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,600
So this, this centre

399
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,000
that is what we call the Swadisthana centre

400
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,960
is the centre that gives you your future energy

401
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,400
to think of your future, your planning;

402
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,440
which gives you energy to bring forth

403
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,800
the manifestation of the physical labor,

404
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,120
of physical exercise or physical work.

405
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,440
This poor centre has to work for one work:

406
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,320
to convert the fat for the use of the brain.

407
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:47,880
Now, if one centre which has to do many other things

408
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,680
starts doing only one work, all other things are
neglected. 

409
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,120
As a result of that you develop problems,

410
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,280
because it has to cater to your liver, to your pancreas,

411
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,040
to your kidneys, to your spleen,

412
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,640
and once

413
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,280
it goes into action for one channelized

414
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,080
work it gets programmed for it,

415
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,880
and then it cannot take care of these things.

416
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,720
That's how you develop a bad liver,

417
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:28,000
you develop a diabetes,

418
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,960
kidney trouble, blood pressures.

419
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,680
Also you develop a very serious disease called blood cancer.

420
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,720
Now, Sahaja Yoga can cure all these troubles.

421
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,880
It's only physical, but it can cure even physical troubles,

422
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,680
because if this centre is brought to its normal behaviour,

423
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,160
if it is made to behave in a very normal way,

424
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,080
you can easily cure all such diseases

425
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,320
which come out of your over activity,

426
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,280
over-thinking, over-imaginativeness.

427
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,200
It's a very dangerous thing to always think about the future.

428
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,680
For example, now we are here sitting down,

429
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,880
we should be comfortably sitting down and talking to each other.

430
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,880
Instead of that we are now, we are thinking

431
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,360
'What am I going to do tomorrow?'

432
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,720
or 'What am I going to do when I go home?',

433
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,040
'How I'm going to cook?', 'What am I going to eat?',

434
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,480
or 'How I am going to take my train?',

435
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,480
all these futuristic behaviours lead you to a

436
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,880
very funny personality.

437
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,080
You become so futuristic that you forget the past.

438
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,720
I met a gentleman who forgot even his own name.

439
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,120
He forgot the name of his father,

440
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,680
he forgot the name of his mother and also,

441
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
to the dismay of his wife, her name.

442
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,040
And she started crying.

443
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,040
She said, "Now what to do? He's forgotten everything."

444
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,160
Now he is in a futuristic area. He just knows the future.

445
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,840
Then he was to be pushed back again into the centre;

446
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,440
then gradually he started remembering.

447
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,960
Then he told Me that he's chairman of one of the councils

448
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,440
of a big district place in India,

449
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,440
and he said, he was - he said, "No, I am."

450
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,280
I said, "That's good. That's better.

451
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,800
Now you are in that state where you say "I am."

452
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,400
So this is what happens,

453
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,800
and this is what's going to happen to our societies here,

454
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,280
which is very futuristic.

455
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,320
So to cut it down one can try anything,

456
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,880
you may try anything; for example

457
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,960
you may show pictures of the past and things like that,

458
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,280
but that is not going to bring back the horse.

459
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,320
it's running very fast.

460
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,560
The only thing that can work it out

461
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,600
is the awakening of the Kundalini.

462
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,600
When the Kundalini awakens itself,

463
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,000
She makes the centre enlightened

464
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,160
and the centre itself resumes its normal shape,

465
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,760
its normal behaviour and its normal condition.

466
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,160
Apart from that it has got a dynamic

467
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,320
power or manifestation that this one,

468
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,320
this centre which looks after our attention becomes enlightened,

469
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,120
and our attention becomes enlightened,

470
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,800
and the attention which is enlightened becomes dynamic

471
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,840
in the sense now, sitting down here you can pay attention to anyone

472
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,360
- just pay attention, you don't have to do anything,

473
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,280
just pay attention to that person,

474
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,360
and you can find out on your fingertips

475
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,080
what's the matter with the person.

476
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,440
Thousands of miles he may be!

477
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,520
When Nixon was having trouble, suddenly I don't know,

478
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,800
I said, "Find out about Nixon, how is he?"

479
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,960
And they said, "Ma, he is in a terrible mess."

480
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,600
Christ has said, 'Your hands will speak'. That's the time has come.

481
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,440
These hands which looks so simple;

482
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,320
but they are so intricate,

483
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,000
and so intricately built that the nerve endings

484
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:24,280
are so microscopic that we cannot understand

485
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,800
how much they can tell us, how far they can go.

486
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,720
When the awakening takes place

487
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,920
you start feeling the vibrations around you,

488
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,840
the all-pervading Power which you have never felt before,

489
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,080
through these fingertips. These fingertips which we neglect,

490
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,000
we misuse them, we use them for wrong things,

491
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,240
these fingertips themselves get enlightened,

492
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,400
and you start feeling them! That's what I said,

493
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,760
that you have to get your awareness which is enlightened.

494
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,960
It's the awareness which has to manifest.

495
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,520
And that's how you start feeling them on your fingers:

496
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,800
It's wrong here, there's wrong there,

497
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,320
you can see where is the problem.

498
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,240
Now all these are related to your centres.

499
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,320
These are five, six and seven;

500
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,520
seven on the left and seven on the right.

501
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,440
So this is about your emotional side, and this is about your right,

502
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,160
about your physical and your rational, or you could say mental side.

503
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,480
So you can make out a person how he is

504
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,920
by just knowing whether you are getting heat from that person,

505
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,480
whether you are getting burning from that person,

506
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,720
whether they are getting numb, whether they are becoming heavy.

507
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,840
And a rapport is established

508
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,480
with the all-pervading Power which informs you, get the messages.

509
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,680
And the messages are so correct

510
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,080
that even if you have ten children who are realised souls

511
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,080
- there are many children these days are born as realised souls.

512
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,200
We don't understand children these days,

513
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,280
but these days there are great children,

514
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,040
and they are born today because the time has come.

515
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,200
This is the time of judgment time, this is the time of resurrection,

516
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:12,520
this is the time about which people have described

517
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,080
in all the scriptures.

518
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,600
So great people are taking birth.

519
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,960
And these children, if you tie them up their eyes,

520
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:29,440
and ask them about a person who is sitting facing them,

521
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,360
'What's the problem with this person?',

522
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,360
they will all raise the same finger.

523
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,920
All of them will raise the same finger, even if their eyes are tied,

524
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,920
even if their backs are towards the person,

525
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,280
they can just push back their hands and say.

526
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,400
They are so good, children are so good.

527
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,720
You see, when they put their fingers in the mouth

528
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,080
we sometimes think -

529
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,600
I don't know, Freud, whom I'd call a very half-baked person,

530
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,080
he didn't know much about God and life and nothing at all,

531
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,600
he was very, little bit he knew

532
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
- he says that this has something towards sex.

533
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,920
He was nothing but a sex point and he wants everybody

534
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,400
to be a sex point, not a human being.

535
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,240
So this fellow, whatever he may say,

536
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,120
but the truth is that it has nothing to do with sex.

537
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,520
It is that they feel the heat on their fingers,

538
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,320
they actually feel it, and that's how they put it in the mouth.

539
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,080
There are little, little children, I've seen; we have one here

540
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,400
who has come from England,

541
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,120
from London, and there's another one who is from here somewhere,

542
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,560
and she - all of these if you ask them

543
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,360
they will immediately tell you where is the catch,

544
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,840
which chakra is catching.

545
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,120
Now, children you cannot befool them.

546
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,760
They all tell you the same thing, that this is what is happening.

547
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,320
So your awareness is enlightened and your hands,

548
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,600
which have got the sympathetic endings here, tell you.

549
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,520
We can say that now in our central nervous system

550
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,920
we can feel about others and about ourselves.

551
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,480
Now, supposing you are sitting here and

552
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,400
I ask you, "What's the problem with you?"

553
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,920
You would say, "I don't know what's the problem with me is,

554
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,840
I don't know."

555
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,240
But I may be able to tell you what the problem is.

556
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,080
If you go and see the doctor, you will see, that's the problem.

557
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,160
How do you know? You don't have to go to any examination,

558
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,720
for all pathological examination where all your teeth are taken out,

559
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,760
eyes are taken out, and by the time you end up they tell you

560
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,040
you are the healthiest man!

561
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,560
You don't have to go to all these horrible things,

562
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,320
you don't have to waste any money and

563
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,440
try all these frustrating things.

564
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,600
Just putting your hands, you will know about yourself.

565
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,760
And the people who are sahaja yogis will tell you

566
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,440
that this is what is wrong with you, and this is how you cure.

567
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,880
Now the time has come - this is such a fantastic time!

568
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,280
With Sahaja Yoga we have cured so many cancer patients,

569
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,240
so many blood cancer patients.

570
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,240
Recently a girl who is a Sahaja yogini

571
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,880
in New York has cured a blood cancer patient.

572
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,200
This boy was about to die, they had declared that he is going to die.

573
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,800
That's declaration they had given about,

574
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,800
for about fifteen days, they said, he may live,

575
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,960
and then he is going to die.

576
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,720
I mean, that's the only thing they could do.

577
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,840
With all the things poor fellow had gone through:

578
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,480
the boy had come from India, all the money was spent,

579
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,120
and this was the certificate he got,

580
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,680
that he is going to die within fifteen days.

581
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,000
Now somehow these people contacted Me,

582
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,560
and I told them to contact a Sahaja yogini in New York.

583
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,160
And they told that such and such boy is there, his name is Rahul,

584
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:48,200
he is hardly about sixteen years of age, he had blood cancer.

585
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,480
The boy not only got cured,

586
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:54,320
he came down to London to see Me, and he's back in his home.

587
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,960
It sounds very fantastic that how can a person who is not a doctor,

588
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,600
who has nothing to do with medicine, can cure?

589
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,480
Beyond all these medicines, beyond all these things

590
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,760
is the subtle Power, the divine Power

591
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,360
from where everything has come out.

592
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:15,400
If you somehow or other become the owner of that,

593
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,120
or the person who knows how to handle it,

594
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,800
you can cure anyone you want to.

595
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,440
It's not that I'm curing these days, My disciples are curing.

596
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,320
I don't know how many people this Dr. Warren, who was a doctor,

597
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:35,760
has cured through Sahaja Yoga, which is not a medical science.

598
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,760
How many patients he himself has cured,

599
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,280
he won't be able to count them.

600
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,880
So the whole system is going to change.

601
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,360
Now you are going to become the master of yourself,

602
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,880
of your powers, and all these powers

603
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,480
are going to be released from you.

604
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,760
Now when we say that there were gurus who could cure,

605
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,080
there were gurus who could stop

606
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,560
a growth of a horrible disease and things like that,

607
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,680
we think it's not possible. We think it is an impossible thing.

608
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,680
How can it be? How can we believe it? It's a cock and bull story.

609
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,560
But you yourself when you see manifesting it, you'll be amazed.

610
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,560
Once I was travelling by a ship,

611
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,280
and the captain of the ship, I gave him Realization.

612
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,160
And it so happened that one of the ship's staff

613
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
got into the freezer,

614
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,520
and he got choked up and he got pneumonia.

615
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,400
Of course, you see, I was in a position, I was travelling because

616
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:43,200
My husband was the chairman of that company.

617
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,880
So he would not ask Me to go down,

618
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,640
he thought it was too much to ask Me.

619
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,760
I said, "All right, if you don't allow Me to go down,

620
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,040
you'd better go down to the spot where he is.

621
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,360
Don't send any SOS to call a doctor or anything,

622
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,560
you just go and put your hand on his chest for about five minutes."

623
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,560
His pneumonia got cured completely

624
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,840
and this captain, he could not believe it.

625
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,320
He said, "How could it be?"

626
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,160
I said, "It is! That has happened to you.

627
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,880
Now you have become that - accept it!"

628
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,880
You must assume that power, whatever has been given to you,

629
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,120
as in Sanskrit language we say "viraj."

630
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,520
Assume it.

631
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,760
You see, even if you - I have given a throne, if you don't know

632
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,680
how to assume the power of the throne, to believe into it,

633
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,680
then like a beggar boy, if you put him on the throne

634
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,840
he still sees people coming down, he puts his hand before,

635
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,440
"Give me five rupees. Give me five rupees."

636
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,840
Unless and until you assume these powers

637
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,200
you are still uncertain, but you have got them.

638
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,160
And this is the point which is very difficult

639
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,880
with the western mind specially,

640
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,920
because they cannot believe that they can have these powers.

641
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,480
They just can't believe it!

642
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,440
You tell them but they say, "How can that be?" But it is so.

643
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,240
Now for example, this instrument.

644
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,080
If you take it to a village and tell them

645
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,480
that this will carry your voices around,

646
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,320
or if you take a, say, a television set

647
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,480
and tell them that you can see all kinds of cinemas,

648
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,880
or we can say, a drama and play or music out of this -

649
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,520
he is not going to believe it. He'll say, "This box?

650
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,600
This looks like an ordinary wooden box."

651
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,040
But when you plug in, it shows its power.

652
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,040
In the same way, what you look at human beings

653
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:36,560
as something very, very ordinary, mundane thing -

654
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,280
for us we take it for granted, ourselves,

655
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,960
we don't know how glorified we are, how great we are,

656
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,960
how God has created us with such difficulty,

657
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,280
with such care, with such love;

658
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,440
for a very special purpose,

659
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,880
that He wants to bestow all His powers upon you.

660
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,960
He wants you to enter into the Kingdom of God

661
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,440
and to enjoy His blessings, His love.

662
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,640
It is something that we cannot believe;

663
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,680
we are so frustrated, we are so disgusted with ourselves,

664
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,080
with our societies, with everything.

665
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,240
But it's not so, it's not so.

666
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,720
It just has to happen.

667
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,840
You are just to be plugged in to the mains and it works,

668
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,800
and it works. It has worked.

669
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,760
It has worked with thousands, and it should work with you.

670
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,760
But the absurd ideas people have,

671
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,920
which is the conception they have that you can pay for it.

672
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,080
I mean, how can you pay for anything that is living?

673
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,400
Have you ever paid anything for that is living?

674
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,840
Like, have you paid anything for getting

675
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,560
a fruit out of a flower? Can you pay to the flower?

676
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,400
"All right, I'll give you one pound, give me a fruit!"

677
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,040
Will it work out?

678
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,120
It's that absurd, that you cannot pay for the living God,

679
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,840
you cannot pay for the living experience

680
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,840
and you cannot pay for the evolutionary process.

681
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,360
It is spontaneous, it is within ourselves, it works out.

682
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,600
But we understand money so much

683
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,520
that we can't understand that is free,

684
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,960
though we have got so many things free.

685
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,320
So many things we have got free,

686
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,920
still we don't understand the importance of free things,

687
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,640
because we think whatever is free cannot be great.

688
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:21,200
Actually all great things have to be free, otherwise we won't exist,

689
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,960
we won't live.

690
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,840
If we didn't get air to breathe freely, we'll not exist.

691
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,120
If it happens sometimes in the airplane or some place,

692
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,160
you should see, then people realise

693
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:38,440
the importance of those free things which we take it for granted.

694
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,880
So one has to understand the conception

695
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,720
that we have about God, about achieving Him,

696
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,480
about getting into ourselves, is also faulty.

697
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,080
We think that supposing we stand on our heads, we'll get it.

698
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:57,080
I mean, standing on our heads if we can get God, then

699
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,280
in all evolutionary process they should have stood on their heads!

700
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,520
Or we think that by running these races we'll get it,

701
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,360
or by eating this kind of food or that kind of food,

702
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,800
or by doing this or that we'll get it - is wrong.

703
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,760
But then you may ask that why all these people in religions said

704
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,560
"Thou shall not commit this, thou shall not do that"?

705
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,960
They said it because these are the things

706
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,040
which are required for our sustenance,

707
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,480
for our balancing as a human being.

708
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,680
We lose our balance if we do not do these things.

709
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,800
We have to have the balance; that's why it was said, "Don't do it."

710
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,320
Human beings have a capacity to go to extremes.

711
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,760
I mean, you tell them something - I have known people,

712
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,040
you just tell them that to cure this particular centre

713
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,080
you have to do this asana or you have to do this kind of a thing.

714
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,480
They will do it hundred times, thousand times in one day.

715
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,480
I mean, I never asked them, I said just once in a while you do it,

716
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,120
or once a week - they'll do it hundred times.

717
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,120
We go to extremes.

718
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,680
And that's why, to strike the balance, these people told us,

719
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,960
"Don't do this, don't do that, don't do that."

720
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,800
But then in our ego we say, "Why not? What's wrong?"

721
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,160
All right, go ahead.

722
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,960
When we tell children, "Don't smoke"

723
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,280
"Why not? All my friends are smoking, I'll smoke."

724
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,200
All right, go ahead - smoke, get cancer,

725
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,160
then you'll have a hole here, breathe through that.

726
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,200
After sometime this will go away, the nose will go away,

727
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,440
and you'll be moving like a machine looking at everyone:

728
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,480
you can't talk, you cannot live like a normal person.

729
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,720
Then you, one realises that, "Oh God, I wish I had not smoked."

730
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,440
But in Sahaja Yoga we don't say, "Don't smoke",

731
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,080
because half of the people will walk off.

732
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,040
We never say "Don't drink," never say anything "don't."

733
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,760
We say, "All right, you are doing it, it's all right."

734
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,000
Let this happen. As soon as this happens you just give up yourself,

735
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,280
because when you have found the highest,

736
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,240
then you don't care for all these small things.

737
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,840
All your habits drop out automatically,

738
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,600
I don't have to force you for that.

739
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,600
You have everything within you, that power, like you get lifted up.

740
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,400
Like a lotus that rises out of the mire by its own force,

741
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,680
you come up and your fragrance fills that mire,

742
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,840
and you are amazed at it yourself.

743
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,840
First you are identified with that mire,

744
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:39,000
and you think that this is what it is - but it's not so.

745
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,360
When it comes up, that lotus, it spreads its beautiful petals,

746
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:49,760
and the fragrance gives us that personality which spreads all over.

747
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,960
And that's what is going to happen to you.

748
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,400
All of you are going to be that lotus which looks hidden,

749
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:03,400
which is absolutely invisible within you,

750
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,920
which is going to open out,

751
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,960
and the fragrance of your divinity is going to spread.

752
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,720
Now today I cannot cover all the centres,

753
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,480
because if I start covering all the centres

754
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,480
it will be a very lengthy thing.

755
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:19,040
I have covered three centres as you have seen:

756
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,920
the Mooladhara Chakra, the Swadisthana and the Nabhi Chakra,

757
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,600
and others I'll cover later on tomorrow.

758
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,960
But I must talk about the Spirit,

759
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,320
about which we are talking for ages now

760
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,640
that we have to become the Spirit.

761
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:43,040
Now English language, as you know, "spirit" can be anything.

762
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:50,080
It's a very ambiguous word:

763
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,360
even to alcohols we call it spirits,

764
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,720
even to the dead souls we call them spirits,

765
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,960
and even to the Spirit that is we are,

766
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,840
the pure being which is called as "atma" in Sanskrit language,

767
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,720
we call the word "spirit."

768
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,840
Here I am saying, talking about that Spirit

769
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,200
which is the pure being within you,

770
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,280
which is a detached being within you,

771
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,600
which is the witness within you,

772
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,400
which sees you all the time, which watches you,

773
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,440
which resides within you as joy and happiness in the heart.

774
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,640
It resides in the heart.

775
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,040
This Spirit is not in our conscious mind,

776
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,120
is not in our central nervous system,

777
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,880
is not under our control.

778
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,520
To give it an analogy, I say that

779
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,800
the left side within us is like the brake

780
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,040
and the right side is like an accelerator in a car.

781
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:53,520
Now in the car we are learning driving, sitting in the front seat,

782
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,160
and there is the master watching at the back

783
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,480
and seeing the whole play.

784
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,720
Now what you do is to go to the left

785
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,040
- means sometimes you put the brake,

786
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,880
sometimes you put the accelerator,

787
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:11,760
make mistakes, and then you learn how to drive.

788
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,120
That learning how to drive is the wisdom part of it,

789
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,480
which comes to us through balancing our lives.

790
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,680
Balance is the most important thing to begin with.

791
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,680
But even if you don't have balance -

792
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,960
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga very imbalanced people

793
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,600
get into the balance.

794
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,720
Now this balancing left and right,

795
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,440
or say, of the brake and the accelerator,

796
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,600
gives you a position where you can say

797
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,240
now you have mastered the driving.

798
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,880
But still there is the master sitting at the back.

799
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,280
Then you become the master.

800
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,160
The master is the Spirit within you.

801
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:58,720
You become the Spirit, and you start watching yourself as a driver.

802
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,280
The whole thing becomes like a play, like a drama;

803
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,080
that you separate yourself and start seeing

804
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,680
everything happening before your eyes,

805
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,320
everything happening just like a drama outside you,

806
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,840
and you are not the part and parcel of it.

807
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,800
So you enter into the area of your axis,

808
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,640
and the periphery loses its impact on you.

809
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:27,040
You become a person who is silent, blissful, quiet,

810
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,840
and sees the periphery, the movement of the periphery,

811
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,800
but you are not in it.

812
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,560
That's how you become the master,

813
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,560
that's how you become the prophet.

814
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,560
But Sahaja Yoga today has a power

815
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,560
to make the prophets out of the men of God,

816
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,480
and these prophets will have power to make others prophet -

817
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,280
so says William Blake, the great poet of this country.

818
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,880
And that's exactly what Sahaja Yoga is.

819
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,720
He predicted it hundred years back.

820
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,960
And today if you come to Sahaja Yoga, you'll be amazed what you are.

821
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,320
Whatever he has predicted about England

822
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:10,320
being the Jerusalem of tomorrow, that tomorrow is today.

823
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,760
This country of yours, England

824
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,280
- which is so far, I don't know if people understand

825
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,000
are aware of what this country is,

826
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,680
which is the heart of the universe,

827
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,160
which is the most important part of the universe

828
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,400
- has to become the Jerusalem.

829
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,360
For that, the Englishmen have to come out of their inertia

830
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,720
to see what are their potentials,

831
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:39,720
to rise up to that point, and that's going to work out.

832
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,880
It's already is working very well in London.

833
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,960
Of course, we can't have too many people

834
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:52,760
because plastics can be produced in the machines in thousands,

835
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,680
but if you have to have something living it takes time.

836
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,160
But once it takes time, once it comes to its maturity,

837
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,600
I'm sure this great country is going to assume

838
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,680
that status of becoming Jerusalem,

839
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,880
the place of worship

840
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:13,800
where people have to come to worship.

841
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,320
It's very surprising, things are happening with Sahaja Yoga,

842
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,920
the flower daisy which never had any fragrance,

843
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,840
if you go and see, now is having fragrance.

844
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,400
Most of the English flowers had no fragrance,

845
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,200
they were known by that.

846
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,280
Most of the flowers are now having tremendous fragrance.

847
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,080
You can see for yourself.

848
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,400
All these things are working by nature, are worked out,

849
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,160
they are coming- but what about human beings?

850
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,120
Where are they? What are they doing? Where are they lost?

851
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,520
This is a very sad thing.

852
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,120
I came to London just by chance, I should say,

853
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,680
or maybe that is pre-arranged.

854
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,640
My husband got elected to this job and he had to come.

855
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,240
And this agency of the UN is only placed here.

856
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,840
It's in England. It's nowhere else.

857
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,920
You have only one agency of the UN, that is in England

858
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,720
for which My husband got elected, and so I am here.

859
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,960
Otherwise, I don't think I could have come here like a Guru,

860
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,560
because I don't have any other interest but this.

861
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,600
And I could not have come here otherwise,

862
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:30,040
because uninvited I would not come to a country,

863
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,560
but I came here as invited person.

864
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,240
It's all working out.

865
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,640
Only you people have to work it out yourself,

866
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,480
and understand not only the dynamism,

867
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,840
the vitality, but the greatest importance is that

868
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,920
at this point you are standing

869
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,640
on the verge of destruction or construction.

870
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,680
And the English people have a special place.

871
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,440
They have to rise up to it,

872
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,040
because they are the cells of the heart.

873
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,080
I'll have this lecture tomorrow again.

874
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,760
I'll hope you'll come and make it comfortable.

875
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,880
Sorry for My throat,

876
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,880
I have been speaking day in and day out, every day.

877
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,000
Thank you very much.

878
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,520
If you have any questions, I would like to answer them.

879
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:06,120
Can I have (answers) , questions from you and then I’ll answer.

880
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,840
You said You could cure after Self-Realization.

881
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:40,960
His problem is that his mother is deaf.

882
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:49,040
Can You fix that hearing problem?

883
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,480
You see this question is such

884
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,960
that it makes you feel that I am a person who have to cure everyone.

885
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,560
You are sadly mistaken.

886
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,880
It's a by-product of awakening of the Kundalini, you get cured.

887
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,320
I'm sorry for that, that you have this understanding

888
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,560
that I'm here to cure all the people.

889
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,200
I should settle down in a hospital.

890
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,840
But main thing is Kundalini has to be awakened

891
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,880
to get you cured. All right?

892
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,880
If your mother was here we could work it out.

893
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,160
But the main thing you must understand,

894
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,280
that God has lot of common sense as we have,

895
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,280
and He is only interested in such lights

896
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:45,120
as we are, which will work out His work.

897
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:51,400
Those who are, say, very sick people, extremely sick,

898
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:54,240
can get cured in a second.

899
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,400
You'll be amazed I'll tell you,

900
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:03,160
our President of India, he went to America for his treatment

901
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:09,560
and it failed. And he was going back to India.

902
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,440
And I went to see him as Mrs. So and So.

903
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,880
But the High Commissioner told him that

904
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,360
I'm So and So and he had heard My name in India.

905
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,360
His wife said, "Why don't you cure my husband?"

906
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,680
And he was just on his last ...

907
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,320
they had prepared everything for his last rites in India.

908
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:35,120
I just put My hand on his back for ten minutes, you won't believe,

909
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,840
he had not slept for days together with pain,

910
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,240
he said, "My pain is relieved, I want to sleep",

911
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,520
and he got up, he was perfectly all right.

912
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,360
He walked down, people had brought stretchers and things.

913
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,320
He just walked down. They couldn't believe their eyes.

914
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:52,640
But this has happened because

915
00:57:52,840 --> 00:58:00,560
he is going to be used for the work of God.

916
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:04,280
In our house if you have lights

917
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,600
which are never going to give light, we don't bother about them.

918
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,560
We sell them in the junk.

919
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:20,160
In the same way, the Divine doesn't cure people, all of them.

920
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,200
It does many thousands

921
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,560
but some of the people who are very sick,

922
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,760
He says, "All right. You go through the second cycle.

923
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,800
All right? Come back purified,

924
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,240
rested and then it works out."

925
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:42,560
So not necessarily that everybody will be cured, not necessarily.

926
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:48,480
But so many have got cured and it has worked.

927
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:53,320
But that's not our main job, is to give cures to people. No.

928
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,080
It is to give realisation to people and as a by-product as you said,

929
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:03,280
of course if she gets realisation, her deafness will go away.

930
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,240
Many people have cured their deafness.

931
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:10,040
Not only deafness but even bald headed people have got hair.

932
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,960
He had no hair on his head when he came to Me, but I don't say;

933
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,920
that after realisation and before realisation, so tremendous

934
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,320
that it's better to take photographs before realisation

935
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,240
and see yourself - dump sometimes!

936
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,360
After realisation people,

937
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,560
see, they have got their photographs before realisation,

938
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:33,680
they have thrown them away.

939
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,920
It is different.

940
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,400
But the main thing is not curing, it's the Self-realization.

941
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,400
That's the main thing! And age has no problem.

942
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,800
Yesterday I think in Birmingham, we gave realisation to somebody

943
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,920
who was a very, very old man. So age has no consideration,

944
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,840
health has no consideration, nothing of the kind.

945
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,920
Everyone can get it and should try to get it.

946
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,920
All right? So if you can get her, we'll work it out.

947
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,840
But I don't promise anything. All right?

948
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,800
May God bless you.

949
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:13,600
Of course, Self-realization I promise! That I promise.

950
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,440
If you have patience with yourself as I have with you.

951
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,800
You have to have patience.

952
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,200
Any other question please?

953
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,440
He has had chest problems for last four or five years.

954
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,960
Is there any way You can help him?

955
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:38,880
Of course, that can be helped.

956
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,160
Yes, chest problem like breathing trouble or what?

957
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,560
Breathing trouble? Is he an Indian?

958
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,680
Asthma. Are you an Indian?

959
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,840
Ahh, Indians you know.

960
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,920
They take so much bath. They still think they are in India.

961
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,360
Everyday take bath in the morning and then go out.

962
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,400
Isn't it? That should not be done. This is England.

963
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,840
We should take bath in the night. We should live like English people.

964
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,840
They are great bathers. Indians are great bathers, you see,

965
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,200
they must have bath every day

966
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,920
whether it is zero degrees or minus twelve degrees.

967
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:16,920
They must have bath, you see, it's a habit formation they have got.

968
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,160
They don't feel all right without a bath

969
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,680
and that's how they develop, but in any case we'll cure your asthma.

970
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,200
All right? It's not so difficult.

971
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:29,680
But one should not take too much bath in England.

972
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,680
I would suggest that if you want to take bath, take it in the night

973
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,720
as the English people do, because it's a very treacherous climate.

974
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,400
And if you take your bath and get out of your bath,

975
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:45,240
you are definite to catch these troubles in the chest.

976
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,200
Not only that but arthritis and all these things come out of this.

977
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:51,720
This is very indiscriminating in this country.

978
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,560
The climate is such you have to be careful.

979
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,960
I mean, one should not postpone bathing forever.

980
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,880
Because, you see, when I say something

981
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,400
I must give the other extreme also.

982
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,880
But we are great bathers, no doubt you see.

983
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,600
Personal cleanliness is too much with Indians, too much.

984
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,880
But general cleanliness or you can say the collective cleanliness

985
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:22,840
is more here, you see. Like mowing the lawn and

986
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,560
looking after the cleanliness of the roads and all much better.

987
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,440
I mean, we have to combine these things. It's important.

988
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,000
That can work out. All right? Asthma is not such a problem.

989
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,440
What else?

990
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:40,880
In what way does it work out?

991
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,280
We have a centre within us which is the centre of Shri Rama

992
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,840
on the right hand side, we call it the right heart.

993
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,080
And, if we can cure that centre of yours,

994
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,880
you'll be all right. All right?

995
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:58,960
We'll work it out. We'll tell you how to do it.

996
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:12,160
How many thousands of years

997
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:16,960
does the yoga date back from?, she said.

998
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,720
Which yoga you mean?

999
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,640
Yoga as being the spontaneous Yoga has been there throughout.

1000
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,720
You see, what is spontaneous is living.

1001
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,520
And the living process has been there throughout.

1002
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:35,400
So we cannot say when it started.

1003
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,880
We can say when it got separated.

1004
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,880
When God and His Power separated

1005
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,760
and God started watching the whole thing as a witness,

1006
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,040
the God Almighty, and His Power started working it out,

1007
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,800
it created all the universes,

1008
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,360
it created our universe out of which it created now human beings.

1009
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,760
And now, it has to become one again.

1010
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:04,240
That creation has to know its Creator.

1011
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:12,080
One, two, three, four - there have been always few people

1012
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,840
getting this connection,

1013
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,200
but today is the time for en masse evolution.

1014
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,200
So, for a growth of life you cannot give any time.

1015
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,680
You can't say when it started,

1016
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,720
how many years back it has been on.

1017
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,960
But today is the blossom time

1018
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,760
when many have to get the blessings of yoga.

1019
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,840
All right? Thank you.

1020
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,200
What is it?

1021
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,320
You spoke about Kundalini.

1022
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:58,960
For the ordinary person, it's very difficult to awaken.

1023
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:03,360
Ah, who's told you that? It's not so.

1024
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,200
You see it is these abnormal people

1025
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:07,800
when they talk about Kundalini they call it abnormal

1026
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,520
because they don't know how to do it. It's the easiest thing to do.

1027
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,240
It's the easiest thing to do if you are an awakened person.

1028
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:17,840
Even a child can do it.

1029
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,440
It's those people who say that Kundalini is very difficult

1030
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,120
are the people who have no idea of Kundalini at all.

1031
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:32,120
They are not masters. For a master what is difficult?

1032
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:35,200
And even an ordinary can become a master,

1033
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,400
then what is difficult?

1034
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,160
These are not masters. These are people absolutely naive,

1035
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:46,880
money makers, useless people.

1036
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,840
They write books without knowing anything about
Kundalini. 

1037
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,120
They are the misguiding people.

1038
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,120
It's the easiest thing to do.

1039
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:58,520
Just under your hand it will move, you will see it moving up

1040
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,400
and you will see it pulsating on the head.

1041
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,840
It's not at all difficult.

1042
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,880
I told you it's the most vital thing that has to happen

1043
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:12,440
and all that is vital has to be free and easy - sahaja.

1044
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,920
Why? In India we had Nanaka who said,

1045
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:19,800
"Sahaja samaadhi laago. Sahaja samaadhi laago."

1046
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,120
Nobody said it is difficult. Kabira never said it. He said,

1047
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,200
"Paacho pachiso pakar bulau ek hi dor bandhahu."

1048
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,840
I'll get twenty-five people together and put them onto one thread.

1049
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,360
Those who had the authority always talked like that.

1050
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,080
Nobody said it is difficult.

1051
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:44,600
It's only these people who do not know the job,

1052
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:48,560
who have no authority, talk like that.

1053
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:51,040
Don't believe them.

1054
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,840
It's the easiest thing to do. You will see yourself.

1055
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,840
But supposing it is easiest, then why should we deny it?

1056
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,800
Supposing I've got the diamond for you free,

1057
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,240
won't you see it, won't you have it?

1058
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:09,920
Or are we going to feel, "Oh it's very difficult. How can we do?"

1059
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,960
When I am saying it is easy. You don't have to pay for it.

1060
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,960
All right?

1061
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,160
What's it?

1062
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:31,120
No, that's correct. Sit down, sit down.

1063
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,880
All right, all right. Please sit down. I'll tell you.

1064
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,280
That's the method people tried. It doesn't work out that way.

1065
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:45,240
Say, your car, is something wrong with your car, all right?

1066
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:51,320
Now, can you clean it from sitting inside it?

1067
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,200
Can you put it right? You have to get out of it.

1068
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,600
So first the Kundalini rising has to be done.

1069
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:01,800
You see, people have confused everything.

1070
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,480
Even in Hatha Yoga where there are ashtangas,

1071
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:12,400
first thing is Ishwar Pranidhana. First is the establishment of God!

1072
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,200
First you have to be connected with God.

1073
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,440
Even in Christianity you have to be baptized first.

1074
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:19,400
Of course, it's an artificial one, forget it,

1075
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,480
but you have to be baptised.

1076
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,520
Even as a Hindu you have to be christened in a way

1077
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:28,240
what you call a Yagnopavita, is done at the age of eight years.

1078
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:33,200
That's what realisation is.

1079
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,840
Or Mohammed Sahib and all these people use Sumta (no thoughts),

1080
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:39,440
that's the same thing.

1081
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:41,840
So the first thing is to get your realisation.

1082
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,440
It doesn't mean that you become a master.

1083
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:45,960
But awakening of the Kundalini

1084
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,280
and then with the growth of the Kundalini you become a master.

1085
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:53,240
This was the real process but they have put it upside down now.

1086
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,040
How can you cleanse yourself

1087
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,680
unless and until you get out of it?

1088
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,840
Supposing My sari is spoilt,

1089
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,640
I have to take out My sari and clean it. Isn't it?

1090
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:09,520
And that's why it is difficult.

1091
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,880
That is it. It's a confusion they have created.

1092
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,160
And don't believe in all these stories.

1093
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,560
If you try to suppress your ego, it will sit on your head.

1094
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,160
Never it will run away.

1095
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:25,640
If you try to suppress your super-ego, it will never help you.

1096
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,720
But here automatically it happens,

1097
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:29,600
and how it happens I'll tell you tomorrow.

1098
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:32,200
By awakening these deities within yourself

1099
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,000
these things are sucked in. Kundalini awakens and does it.

1100
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,600
And last of all, if you want Me to confess,

1101
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:41,720
there is something special about Me that I can do it.

1102
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,640
Must be something.

1103
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:51,040
If you don't crucify Me, I'll say that much, not more.

1104
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:52,360
You better find out.

1105
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,880
Otherwise the first thing you will do is to crucify Me.

1106
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:00,600
I don't want it anymore.

1107
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,160
All right? May God bless you.

1108
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:10,440
Yes, My child?

1109
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,720
It's not any surgery needed for that.

1110
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,120
In Sahaja Yoga, we have techniques,

1111
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:34,400
divine techniques by which we open our heart.

1112
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,360
The confusion is on another line also,

1113
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,320
and this confusion has led us into problem.

1114
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,960
You see, the confusion is about how our relationships

1115
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:51,200
should be to ourselves, to others and to the society.

1116
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,440
There's a big confusion that started long time back.

1117
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,160
When the Smritis were written,

1118
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,320
or we can say when the religion was practiced

1119
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:02,440
it was just the other way round. We started doing everything

1120
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:07,920
and that's how we have lost that capacity.

1121
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,960
The attitude towards ourselves should be

1122
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,920
that we should try to perfect ourselves.

1123
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:17,120
It's absolutely tyrannical I tell you.

1124
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:21,840
When I tried to perfect Sahaja Yoga, I am tyrannical towards Myself.

1125
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,320
The amount of work I take out of this body

1126
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:28,640
and the amount of exertions I can put in out of this body,

1127
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,960
the stretching of My complete patience to a great extent

1128
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:33,920
- I work it out.

1129
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,760
I mean, normally you know, people get just clenched up,

1130
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,640
"Oh Mother, this is too much. We can't bear."

1131
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,160
You have seen it yourself.

1132
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,880
But you have to be really tyrannical to perfect yourself.

1133
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,720
That should be the way we should work it out

1134
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,120
towards ourselves.

1135
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:54,240
And towards others it should be an ideal relationship.

1136
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:57,240
Like now you have a brother, he is your brother

1137
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:58,960
- should be ideal brother.

1138
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:03,040
If he is your father, he should be an ideal. But such a confusion!

1139
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,440
The more enlightened, so-called, you become,

1140
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,560
the more elevated you become,

1141
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,400
the confusion is: who is your sister, who is your mother,

1142
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,960
who is your father?

1143
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,880
Then the relationship between the Sahaja yogis also becomes confused.

1144
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,880
You are Sahaja Yogis, you are all prophets,

1145
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:21,240
you must respect each other.

1146
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,760
You are all prophets, you speak the same language.

1147
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,560
You have to love each other.

1148
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,640
It's not rational, it has to happen to you

1149
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,840
because the relationship has to be established,

1150
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,400
that relationship, that ideal relationship.

1151
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:37,520
So many people now you have known that get angry with Me,

1152
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:40,040
"Mother, You are too patient with the Sahaja yogis."

1153
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:45,520
But they are My children. I have to perfect Myself,

1154
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,400
and My relationship with them should be ideal.

1155
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,480
I have to go to a great extent forgiving them

1156
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:54,160
so that they come up.

1157
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,880
So relationship with others should be ideal.

1158
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:59,840
Are you an ideal father? Are you an ideal mother?

1159
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,800
Are you an ideal sister and a brother?

1160
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,520
Are you an ideal citizen towards others?

1161
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,840
But the society has to be pragmatic.

1162
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:15,160
The society has to work it out pragmatically,

1163
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,520
and the pragmatic working out comes by changing.

1164
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:21,920
Supposing today I would say that for India

1165
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,440
we don't need vegetarianism.

1166
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,720
For England we need vegetarianism.

1167
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:32,680
It's all pragmatic. The society has to be pragmatic.

1168
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,160
Here, we are pragmatic about ourselves,

1169
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:39,680
not about the society, we are pragmatic about ourselves.

1170
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,640
Everything works out. "What's wrong?"

1171
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,480
A woman who has children will run away with another man.

1172
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,600
"What's wrong?"

1173
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,720
Or a woman who has children can sell

1174
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:56,240
the country for the sake of her children. "What's wrong?"

1175
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,280
So this confusion within us creates this problem,

1176
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,560
and that's how we do not know how to open out ourselves.

1177
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,520
If we could get rid of our confusions, it could be all right.

1178
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,960
It can be done through Sahaja Yoga.

1179
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,920
All these confusions have been created by half-baked people

1180
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,320
I would say.

1181
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:19,280
Like there's nothing wrong with the incarnations, with the prophets,

1182
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:23,600
nothing wrong with them, they are perfect people.

1183
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,240
What is wrong with us is our attitude.

1184
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,720
And if we can discriminately use our attitude

1185
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,120
towards ourselves, towards others and towards the society,

1186
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,440
everything will work out. It's going to be beautiful.

1187
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,800
Because of this confusion our heart is closed.

1188
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,240
We are frightened of others. What is there to be frightened?

1189
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:53,600
Relationship is ideal. What can we do?

1190
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,800
Your relationship as far as they are concerned,

1191
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,480
your relationship, your heart is ideal.

1192
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:00,960
Whatever they do is not the point.

1193
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,480
Whatever I do for them has to be ideal.

1194
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,480
I have to go on loving them.

1195
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,840
I have to go on admiring them, encouraging them, sustaining them

1196
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,800
and giving them what I have to do as My relationship has to.

1197
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:24,640
Say for example, a source of water that is under the Mother Earth -

1198
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:28,400
does it think what kind of a tree it is,

1199
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,400
what sort of things it is doing?

1200
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,800
It just gives its source, its water.

1201
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:38,760
In the same way, because you are the source,

1202
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,600
so the relationship has to be ideal.

1203
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,720
These confusions have worked out

1204
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,640
and rationally we have accepted all these confusions.

1205
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,200
And this has led us into this kind of a trap

1206
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:53,720
that our hearts are closed.

1207
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,280
All right?
