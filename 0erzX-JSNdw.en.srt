1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,980
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,720
One has to realize that Truth is what it is.

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,020
You cannot conceptualize it.

4
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,740
You cannot organize it.

5
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,980
And you cannot maneuver it.

6
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,520
It is self-supporting.

7
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:24,700
Now before you I have to put the theory, you can call it,

8
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,160
or a hypothesis about what is within ourselves.

9
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,520
In a subtle form, what we have inside and outside.

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,680
We see everything - like these flowers,

11
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,180
all that is living - and we take it for granted.

12
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,940
But who does this miraculous work, this living work?

13
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,220
Now you have to have an open mind of a scientist

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,520
to see if this hypothesis is working or not.

15
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,320
And if it works, then you have to accept it in your honesty.

16
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,060
There is an all-pervading power, a subtle power, all over,

17
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,700
that does all these miraculous living things.

18
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,080
We have come from ameba to human stage.

19
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,500
From ameba to human stage we have come.

20
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,940
But still we have not reached the absolute Truth.

21
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,280
We live in a relative world.

22
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:02,080
So there are difference of opinions and difference of believes.

23
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,540
But there is within us a power,

24
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,560
which can connect us to this all-pervading power.

25
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,600
And this union is a real yoga.

26
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,220
Otherwise, all kinds of yogas are there, but they are unjust

27
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,920
or physical or maybe little mental projections.

28
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,620
Now as everything is living work,

29
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,380
our evolution is also a living work.

30
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,100
And at a human level now, with our human awareness,

31
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,300
there is a little breakthrough needed.

32
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,040
This breakthrough will give us

33
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,120
a new awareness, a new dimension.

34
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,080
This power, which is within us, is called as Kundalini

35
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,240
in Sanskrit language.

36
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,840
Now in the West you have the knowledge of the trivial.

37
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,000
But this is the knowledge of the roots.

38
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,800
And if you do not have the knowledge of the roots,

39
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,160
we can destroy ourselves completely.

40
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,100
So this knowledge has to be understood.

41
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:55,080
This power rests in a triangular bone called as Sacrum.

42
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,620
Sacrum means "sacred". That means Greeks knew

43
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,020
that there is a sacred power inside this triangular bone.

44
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,540
So this power has to rise within us

45
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,800
and has to break through our fontanel bone area,

46
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,560
which was a soft bone in our childhood.

47
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,580
Like this instrument, if it is not connected to the means,

48
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,440
it is of no use, it has no meaning.

49
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,260
In the same way, unless and until we are connected to the means,

50
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,620
we too do not know the meaning of our life.

51
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:32,520
When this power rises, just like a seed is sprouting,

52
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,700
it is your mother power.

53
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,920
It is the power of pure desire.

54
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,940
All other desires are in general not satiable.

55
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,080
Not satiable. Not generally satiable.

56
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:13,580
Because you want to have today supposing you want to have food,

57
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,760
tomorrow you want to have a house, the day after tomorrow a car,

58
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,840
I don't know, then a helicopter, still you are not satisfied.

59
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,540
And ultimately, I found, where there is too much money,

60
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,840
then they commit suicide.

61
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:53,320
So there must be something, which is a pure desire within us.

62
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,780
We may not be aware of that power,

63
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,280
but it exist within us.

64
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,400
And that desire is to be one with this all-pervading power.

65
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,660
It's subtle power.

66
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,320
What human beings can do is, that if there is a dead tree,

67
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,520
we can make a furniture. From death to death.

68
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,840
But we cannot create even the wood ourselves.

69
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,280
[Sahaja yogi: Sorry Mother, we cannot...?]

70
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,500
We cannot even create the wood ourselves.

71
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,580
[Sahaja yogi: The wood?]
Wood, I mean the tree or anything ourselves,

72
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
not even the clay.

73
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,580
But we feel we are great, because we've done

74
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,240
some atom bombs and nitrogen bombs.

75
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,260
That's only for our destruction.

76
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,880
So we go into imbalances. Anything we want to have,

77
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,020
we go into imbalances.

78
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,500
Like, they wanted to have science; with science, it's atom bomb.

79
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,380
Now they are having ecological problems, this problem,

80
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,460
problems, problems, problems.

81
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,180
The problems have increased much more

82
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,260
than they were about hundred years back.

83
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,000
Now we have machines and then we want to have run the machines

84
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,380
and we run machines to such extend that we don't know what to do

85
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,980
with them. Because you have to go on producing!

86
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,180
Now in America, they have produced so much of plastic,

87
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,600
they don't know what to do with it.

88
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,420
So machines are for us, we are not for the machines.

89
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,060
So we have lost ourselves somewhere.

90
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,000
Because we haven't got the Truth with us.

91
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,000
And it is very easy

92
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,560
to get Self-realization.

93
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,680
To get Self-knowledge.

94
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,860
Because it's a living process. It is so vital.

95
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,880
It works so spontaneously.

96
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,100
And all of you can become

97
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,600
those super human beings, who know the Absolute.

98
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,960
When you are connected with the Divine power,

99
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:56,460
it starts flowing through you like cool breeze, from your hands.

100
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,440
And you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

101
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,700
Yourself you feel it.

102
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,020
It is a fantastic thing that is a human being.

103
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,960
You are at the epitome of evolution. Epitome of evolution!

104
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,620
Only you are still to be connected to the means.

105
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,060
The first thing that happens to you, when this Kundalini rises

106
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,320
within you, that you get back your innocence.

107
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,040
You get your purity of your innocence.

108
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:38,300
Then, second thing that's so easy to happen is that

109
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,880
suddenly you become very creative.

110
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,140
It is very surprising, I have seen,

111
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,080
people who could not even sing have become great musicians.

112
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,780
There are very great artists, who have come out of Sahaja Yoga.

113
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:17,300
Also your brain opens out and you become extremely dynamic.

114
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,140
At the same time, you are very compassionate.

115
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,660
And you are completely at peace with yourself.

116
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,280
As a result of this happening, the first thing that happens to you

117
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:57,060
really, is that you get cure of your elements, physical.

118
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,760
And you know how to cure yourself and cure others.

119
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,580
In a medical terminology we can see that

120
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,940
we become in charge of the parasympathetic nervous system.

121
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:40,820
And all so-called incurable diseases are being cured.

122
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,620
We have got some doctors in India, who have got MD on Sahaja Yoga

123
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,440
[Doctor of Medicine, ed.] for curing diseases.

124
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,240
Mentally you become so strong that

125
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,500
all your bad habits drop out automatically.

126
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,600
Supposing you are holding onto a snake

127
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,860
and somebody says, "You have a snake in your hand."

128
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,480
But in darkness you say, "No, I think it's a rope."

129
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,200
[Shri Mataji repeating for the translator:] It's a rope.

130
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,360
In the darkness, you see, if you are holding a snake.

131
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,580
Snake. And somebody says it's a...

132
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,380
But if the light comes in, he drops the snake.

133
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,520
All right. And snakes run away.

134
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,160
So, whatever we agree in our ignorance,

135
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,600
just runs away from us

136
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,340
and we become really free people.

137
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,620
Many people, who has schizophrenia, say, also lunatics,

138
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,840
have been cured with Sahaja Yoga.

139
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,300
And also the absurd habits people have developed

140
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,620
in their own ego, they get all right.

141
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,220
I have seen many children, many students,

142
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,940
who could'n get through in their exams, have got

143
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,200
first class and are doing very well in India.

144
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,920
Emotionally you become so balanced,

145
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,620
that you have very happy married life.

146
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,720
And you have beautiful children.

147
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,120
All these things happen because of your transformation.

148
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,220
Because the Spirit, which is in your heart,

149
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,140
comes into your attention now.

150
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,500
And then your attention becomes very powerful.

151
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,280
When you pay your attention to someone, you immediately know,

152
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,880
what's wrong with that person.

153
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,680
And once you are established fully, properly,

154
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,120
then even a glance can do the work.

155
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,540
But, highest of all, you become

156
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,620
extremely peaceful and very joyous.

157
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,800
You enjoy the comfort of the Spirit, you don't bother about

158
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,980
other comforts.

159
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,980
All this looks very fantastic, again, I would say.

160
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,360
But say for a television, if you take it to a remote village

161
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,980
in India to who have never seen it, and if you tell them that,

162
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,520
"In this box you can see everything from different places,"

163
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,300
they'll say, "No, how can it be? It's just a box."

164
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,860
But once you put to the mains, you see the dynamism

165
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,380
and the beauty of that television.

166
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,360
That is how we are.

167
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,280
We are great,

168
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,820
we are glorious.

169
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,740
But we have to be connected with the mains.

170
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,740
That is our right, as human beings, to have it.

171
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,300
I would, of course, like you to ask me few questions,

172
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,220
but there are so many people.

173
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,000
You can ask me some questions and if you have some more,

174
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,140
you can write them down, I'll answer them tomorrow.

175
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,120
But there should not be any aggression, because I have not come here

176
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,760
to take anything from you.

177
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,120
These are your own powers.

178
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,440
And you will be endowed with powers to give others Realization.

179
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,420
To...

180
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,300
So I would request you to ask me questions, few questions,

181
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,440
and then if you want, we can have the session of meditation,

182
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,260
in which you can feel your all-pervading power.

183
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:28,060
But should be questions,

184
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,580
which are related to the subject.

185
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,740
[Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, there is a question. Is there any effect of:

186
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,520
If you feel the diseased person and you take the disease on you

187
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,320
and then you, being the healthy man,

188
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,000
can you transfer this health onto him?]

189
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,140
Now, you don't take any diseases.
[Sahaja yogi: Sorry?]

190
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,140
You don't take any diseases. You are an instrument,

191
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,340
you just note it down.

192
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,080
[Shri Mataji is speaking about Her drink:]

193
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,960
This s very sour, she is not understanding.

194
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,120
First get [UNCLEAR] water. This is too sour.

195
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,620
This is very sour for the throat.

196
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,280
[Sahaja yogi: So shall we continue? Or shall I translate the question,

197
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,780
the another question?]
Read it, the question.

198
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,680
[Sahaja yogi: Mother, second question is: How to get rid of insomnia,

199
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,420
lack of sleep? And the other question is: How to get the energy,

200
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,020
if you do not have the sufficient quantity of it for you?]

201
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,740
I'll answer the second first.

202
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,100
That, you don't have to decide.

203
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,620
Your Kundalini knows everything, she is like a tape recorder,

204
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,040
she knows you very well, she is your individual Mother.

205
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,340
What is the first question was?

206
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,540
[Sahaja yogi: There was a question of: How to get rid of insomnia?

207
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,740
And the second question was: If you don't have the sufficient

208
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,080
quantity of energy, where to get?]
That I have said. So,

209
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,880
the first question was "insomnia". Is curable by Sahaja Yoga.

210
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:47,000
Now, we'll be having a center here in Leningrad,

211
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:51,740
where you will come and we'll solve the problem for you.

212
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,800
But in any case - maybe today - you might get your Realization

213
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,300
maybe.

214
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,800
You may get rid of your problems.

215
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,880
Now, will you please write it down? It's better, systematic.

216
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,940
What is the gentleman saying?

217
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:50,140
Yes. Please. You have to be kind and civil.

218
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,000
I am not here to get anything.

219
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,940
[Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, there is a question:

220
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,520
If Kali shakti is the same as Kundalini.

221
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,780
The question is: If Kali shakti, Mahakali shakti

222
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,980
is the same as Kundalini shakti, and can I address this...]

223
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,080
No. I'll tell you tomorrow all about the chakras and the shaktis.

224
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,940
All right? Tomorrow, in a complete lecture.

225
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,020
I'll tell you everything.

226
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,740
But this knowledge is Love.

227
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,220
And even if you know everything about it by your brain, mentally,

228
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,580
is not going to work out.

229
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,320
It has to work out, is the point.

230
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,460
The problem is the actualization.

231
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,920
So by arguments and all these things

232
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,720
you are in the web of words.

233
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,480
[Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, the question is: Who is your teacher?]

234
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,940
I am myself my own teacher.

235
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,960
And I'll make you your own teacher too.

236
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,400
Once you have your Spirit, once have your enlightenment,

237
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,680
you don't need a teacher at all.

238
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,320
And you have to know that this is a living process,

239
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,240
and anybody who takes money from you

240
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,560
is a false master.

241
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,220
And you cannot pay for it.

242
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,040
Or it is also not outside, like you go on chanting

243
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,300
or saying something.

244
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,800
It's a happening within.

245
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,380
[Sahaja yogi: Mataji, there is a question.

246
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,040
The question is: Our attitude towards

247
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,720
Sri Aurobindo and his teaching.]

248
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:22,100
Now... You see, teachings are teachings, has no meaning to me.

249
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,240
They must act.

250
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,140
All mental.

251
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,400
[Sahaja yogi: Mataji, there is few questions.]

252
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,820
We'll answer you tomorrow, don't you worry.

253
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,520
All right?

254
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,680
Is all mental activity again.

255
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,520
But I wanted you to ask me questions to know

256
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,100
that your mind should not suddenly start

257
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,760
bothering you too much.

258
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,940
Because this mind is like a monkey, you know.

259
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,960
It just makes you dance all the time.

260
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,640
It's a joyless pursuit.

261
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,820
Tomorrow I'll explain to you all these chakras

262
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
and all the left and right side,

263
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,520
sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic.

264
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:36,180
And everything that you want to know about it.

265
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,000
Now, see, there are so many lights here.

266
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,340
And you have to, if put them on,

267
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,440
you have to just switch on one switch.

268
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,500
But supposing I have to give you a lecture about the

269
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,680
electricity, how it was discovered and brought

270
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,720
here to Leningrad and what is the source and all.

271
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,200
It will be just a headache to you.

272
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,200
Better to have the light!

273
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,200
Because it is already built-in.

274
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,760
In the same way it's all built-in within you.

275
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,280
So why not have your own powers?

276
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,640
As simple as that.

277
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,120
All right?

278
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,340
[Aside:] You could get somebody to stand here to show.

279
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,400
You can get somebody to show that how to do it. To raise

280
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,860
the Kundalini, all right? If you can get somebody, as to show.

281
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,080
Just one of the Sahaja yogis.

282
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,140
Someone. Some man.

283
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,860
All right. Anyone up. You can come.

284
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,640
Now, you can show.

285
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,240
Is here.

286
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,340
Now, one simple thing we have to know.

287
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,340
That

288
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,700
there are two conditions

289
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,780
for your Realization.

290
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,580
First condition is that you have to forget the past

291
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,640
and you are not to feel guilty for anything.

292
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,580
Because after all, we are human beings and if you make mistakes,

293
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,660
there is nothing to feel guilty.

294
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,480
And this all-pervading power, which I am talking about,

295
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,800
is the ocean of forgiveness.

296
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,580
Now, whatever

297
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,840
you think you have done wrong

298
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,760
can be easily dissolved by this powerful ocean.

299
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,560
So first you have to forgive yourself

300
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,320
and forget your past completely.

301
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:48,100
The past is finished and the future doesn't exist,

302
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,660
so present is reality.

303
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,080
Now the second condition is that

304
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,560
you have to forgive everyone.

305
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:19,740
Some of you may think that it's difficult to forgive.

306
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,200
But it is just a mental activity.

307
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:36,980
If you forgive or you don't forgive, what do you do?

308
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,940
You just play into wrong hands.

309
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,600
So you have to forgive.

310
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,800
Forgive everyone. Forget the wars.

311
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,980
Forgive the Germans.

312
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,360
Because they are dead and gone now. Finished.

313
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,080
[Repeating for the translator:] Germans are... they are dead.

314
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:30,420
Now, if you meet the new Germans who are Sahaja yogis,

315
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:36,140
they are so gentle, so kind, so beautiful.

316
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,980
And I asked them, "How is it that the British are still very arrogant

317
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,020
and you people are so gentle?"

318
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,660
And they said that their forefathers never lost any war

319
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,240
and God we lost the war, so we are in our senses.

320
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,660
Look at the wisdom now.

321
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:48,400
So forget the past and forgive everyone.

322
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,420
That's all you have to do.

323
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,460
It's very important. Otherwise I cannot give you Realization.

324
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,600
I am sorry.

325
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,440
From your heart, please, do it.

326
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,020
All right. Now we have to take out your shoes,

327
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,680
because you have to take the help of the Mother Earth.

328
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,860
[To a Sahaja yogi:] Floran, Floran, you get all the [UNCLEAR].

329
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,560
So now we have to know,

330
00:45:55,780 --> 00:46:00,580
that we have to be very pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

331
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,440
To be...

332
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:17,320
actually to love yourself and to respect.

333
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:27,960
Only after Realization you will know how great you are,

334
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:32,960
and how great are other people who have got Realization.

335
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:43,760
The most beautiful things in this world to be enjoyed,

336
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,780
more than flowers, are human beings.

337
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,580
So now we have

338
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,560
a simple nourishment

339
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,260
of our centers, which I will show you before,

340
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,480
and then you can close your eyes.

341
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,540
Later on.

342
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,060
It takes about ten to fifteen minutes. That's all.

343
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,220
Now, you have to put both your feet apart from each other,

344
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,780
because these are two powers, left and right.

345
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,240
You have to be comfortably seated, not

346
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,300
too much slouching or too much straight like that, but

347
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,820
in a comfortable state of body.

348
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:14,980
In a very pleasant mood.

349
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,500
Now, you have to put your left hand towards me, like this.

350
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,180
Very comfortably.

351
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,780
And this symbolizes

352
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,840
your desire to have Self-realization.

353
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,860
Now, I cannot force it on you.

354
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,320
You have to ask for it.

355
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:06,520
I respect your freedom, because

356
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,060
ultimately you have to get the complete freedom.

357
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:13,680
So I cannot force on you.

358
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,780
Now, the right hand is to be used for nourishing

359
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:30,260
your centers on the left-hand side.

360
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,580
So first we put our right hand on our heart.

361
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,720
If you have anything in the pocket, please take out.

362
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,980
Will be better, it is good for you.

363
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,160
Those, who don't want to do it, should go away.

364
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,640
Should not disturb others by...

365
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,280
Everyone of you have to do it.

366
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,780
Otherwise you can leave the hall. If you don't want to do it,

367
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,100
I cannot force on you.

368
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,660
And it will not be civil to watch others.

369
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:40,560
[For the translator:] It's not civil.

370
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,440
So now, put left hand towards me

371
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,640
and right hand on your heart, please.

372
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:04,540
Now, in the heart resides the Spirit.

373
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:15,420
In the heart resides the Spirit.

374
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,260
And if you are the Spirit, you become your master.

375
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,500
So now you put your hand on the left-hand side of your abdomen,

376
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,740
in the upper part.

377
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,560
This is the center of your mastery.

378
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,600
Now you have to put your hand on the lower part of your abdomen,

379
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,040
on the left-hand side. And press it hard.

380
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:13,060
Now, this is the center of your...

381
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:16,480
the knowledge of the purity,

382
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,560
or you can say the pure knowledge.

383
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,940
Which manifests on your fingertips.

384
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,740
As if you become a spiritual computer.

385
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:41,740
Now, raise your hand again on the upper portion

386
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,560
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

387
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,640
Then raise it again to your heart.

388
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,100
Then raise it in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

389
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:07,820
as far as possible, and turn your head to your right.

390
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,060
Put it here, nicely.

391
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:30,740
Now, this center catches, when we are guilty.

392
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:42,040
As a result of that, you get diseases, very dangerous diseases like

393
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,640
angina, spondylitis.

394
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,380
Now, you put your right hand on top of your forehead across,

395
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:02,580
and put down your head.

396
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,780
And press it on both the sides.

397
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:19,520
This is the center for forgiveness.

398
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,320
Now, you have to take back your hand on the back side of your head.

399
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,560
Back side of your head. And push back your head

400
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,940
as far as possible backward.

401
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,660
This is the center for asking forgiveness

402
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,620
of this all-pervading power.

403
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:59,020
But you are not to feel guilty, or to count your mistakes.

404
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,960
Now, you have to stretch your hand fully like this,

405
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:15,220
and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area,

406
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,540
where it was soft bone.

407
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,100
Now, you have to press it hard.

408
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:35,800
And move it, seven times your scalp, slowly.

409
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:39,520
You can push back your fingers.

410
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,420
Put down your head and push back your fingers.

411
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,120
Seven times.

412
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,380
That's what we have to do.

413
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,480
You have to press it hard.

414
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,080
With the fingers outward.

415
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:20,060
Now, you will have to close your eyes.

416
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:28,680
You can take out your spectacles. Until I tell you, please,

417
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,480
don't open your eyes.

418
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,300
Put your both the hands, feet, on the sides

419
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:48,000
and one hand towards me like this, and close your eyes.

420
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:03,360
Now, take the right hand on your heart.

421
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,080
Now, here you ask a question to me, three times,

422
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,080
which is very important. In your heart.

423
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:18,960
You can call me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like.

424
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,120
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

425
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:27,540
Ask this question three times, as you would ask a computer.

426
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,040
Now, if you are the Spirit,

427
00:57:54,220 --> 00:58:00,120
you are your guide, your own master.

428
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:10,680
So please, take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen

429
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,860
and press it hard. On the left-hand side.

430
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,360
So now, here you ask me another question three times.

431
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:41,800
Mother, am I my own master?

432
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:13,760
As I've told you, that I cannot force the pure knowledge on you.

433
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,040
You have ask for it.

434
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,460
So now, please, put your right hand in the

435
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:31,040
lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

436
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:42,000
Now, here you ask six times.

437
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:47,980
"Mother, please, give me pure knowledge."

438
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:52,620
Because this center has got six petals.

439
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,840
As soon as you ask this question, this residual power

440
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,240
of Kundalini starts rising.

441
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:33,000
So you have to open the upper centers

442
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,700
by your self-confidence.

443
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,900
So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

444
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,080
on the left-hand side.

445
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:00,520
Here now, with full confidence

446
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,020
we have to say ten times:

447
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:11,540
"Mother, I am my own master."

448
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,300
Now, one has to know that you are not this body,

449
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:32,620
you are not this mind, you are not this intellect.

450
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:46,660
You are not your conditioning or your ego

451
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,480
nor your intellect.

452
01:01:54,720 --> 01:02:00,000
Because you say, "my emotions, my body."

453
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:03,300
You don't say, "I body."

454
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:13,300
So you are the pure Spirit.

455
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:23,780
Now, raise our hand to your heart on the left-hand side

456
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:29,620
and here again with full confidence,

457
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:37,180
please, say twelve times: "Mother, I am the Spirit."

458
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:53,240
Now, again I have to tell you

459
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,280
that this great all-pervading power

460
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:08,000
is the ocean of love and compassion.

461
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:13,740
It is the ocean of bliss and joy.

462
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:21,580
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

463
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,380
So please, know that

464
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:34,600
whatever mistakes you have committed, can be easily dissolved

465
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:40,980
by this great ocean of forgiveness.

466
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,780
So now, raise your hand in the corner of your neck

467
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,360
and your shoulder and turn your head to the right.

468
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:06,100
Turn your head to the right.

469
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:11,020
And you have to say with full confidence again

470
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,660
sixteen times:

471
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:19,020
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

472
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:26,680
Sixteen times.

473
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,860
I have already told you

474
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:42,680
that it's a mental activity,

475
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:46,540
when we say we cannot forgive someone.

476
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:56,240
And whether we forgive, or we don't forgive, we don't do anything.

477
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:05,040
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

478
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:12,400
Mentally, mentally you suffer.

479
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:17,900
So now, just take your hand

480
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,840
on your forehead across and put down your head

481
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:25,540
as much as your can on that hand.

482
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:34,500
And press it, press it on both the sides.

483
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:40,600
Press it on both the sides and here...

484
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,340
and here you have to say:

485
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:53,840
"Mother, I forgive all the people, everyone."

486
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:03,300
Do not count whom you have to forgive.

487
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:14,800
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head

488
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:20,000
and push back your head upward.

489
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:34,060
Here you have to say, without counting your mistakes,

490
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:37,400
without counting your guilt,

491
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,900
just you have to say for your own satisfaction,

492
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:52,720
from your heart, not how many times,

493
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,820
your have to say that, "Oh, all-pervading power,

494
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,580
if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me."

495
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,260
Now,

496
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:24,160
stretch your hand

497
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,540
and take your hand on top

498
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:37,960
of the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone.

499
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:42,820
Push back your fingers, put down your head.

500
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:51,380
And - put down your head.

501
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:57,420
Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for...

502
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:06,640
You have to ask for your Self-realization.

503
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:16,080
So move your scalp so many times, slowly, saying:

504
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,640
"Mother, please, give me Self-realization."

505
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,660
Now, please, take down your both the hands

506
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:20,820
and slowly open your eyes.

507
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:30,700
Put both of your hands towards me like this.

508
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,320
Watch me without thinking, you can do it now.

509
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:50,380
Now, bend your head and see for yourself with your left hand,

510
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,060
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

511
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:56,700
There might be some hot, doesn't matter.

512
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,160
Now, put your left hand towards me, put down your right hand

513
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:27,280
and see for yourselves.

514
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:41,500
Again once more, please, put down your head and see for yourself,

515
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:45,280
if there is a cool breeze.

516
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,880
Now,

517
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:07,220
you take both your hands up like that, push back your head.

518
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:13,740
And ask me a question:

519
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:20,920
"Is this the cool breeze of the all-pervading power of Love?"

520
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,040
Please, ask this question three times.

521
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:46,060
Now, take down your hands please.

522
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,140
All those, who have felt cool breeze

523
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:58,500
out of their heads or in their hands,

524
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:04,240
or even hot breeze coming out, please raise your both the hands.

525
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,720
Both the hands. [My God!]

526
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,620
Both the hands.

527
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:24,060
The whole of Russia has got Realization!

528
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:42,160
Now, just put your hands like this and ask the question:

529
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,600
"Mother, is Russia going to be the greatest spiritual country?"

530
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:58,100
It is true. It is true, I know that.

531
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:01,220
And best - if it's true, the vibrations will increase,

532
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,660
the cool breeze is here.

533
01:13:03,860 --> 01:13:07,000
Ask this question three times.

534
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,540
All right?

535
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:28,240
It's true.

536
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:33,620
May all of you be blessed.

537
01:13:33,780 --> 01:13:39,460
And I'll come again tomorrow to explain to you.

538
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:48,640
But now, now you should go in peace and silence

539
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:51,140
and don't discuss it, don't think about it.

540
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,340
Otherwise you'll loose it.

541
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:11,880
Those who haven't got it will get it tomorrow,

542
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:17,380
and those who have got it, their connections will be fixed.

543
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:28,140
Thank you very much.

544
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:48,960
And now you all know yourself and enjoy!

545
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,900
This is our religion: To know ourselves and to enjoy.
