00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.640
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:08.480
At the very outset you have to know that truth is what it is.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:12.480
We cannot change it.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.760
We cannot transform it

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.160
and we cannot conceptualize it.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:25.640
Also unfortunately at this human awareness

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:31.440
we cannot feel the truth,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.080
so something has to be done,

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:47.360
something has to work out in our human awareness

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.520
in the evolutionary process.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:57.080
We have become human beings from amoeba.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.960
How did we become?

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.520
And if we are human beings

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:11.840
have we reached the Absolute State? We have not.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.040
If we had reached the absolute state

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.720
then there would have been no problems

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.960
because everybody would have seen the same thing,

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.040
would have understood the same thing

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.760
and felt the same thing

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.680
but because we are living in a relative world

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:32.400
we have all these problems.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.880
As it is, most of the problems are created

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:40.760
by human beings.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.240
If you see ecological problems,

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.040
if you see economic problems, political problems,

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.960
physical problems,

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:57.640
mental problems, family problems,

00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:03.280
all of them are related to human beings.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:10.360
So we have gone wrong somewhere,

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:12.720
there's something that's a missing point

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.600
which we have not realized.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:22.280
The advancements we have made in our civilization,

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:24.200
say in science,

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.880
has reached such a stage that we had to create atom bomb,

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.960
hydrogen bomb.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:37.600
So all these mental efforts we have put in also boomerang on us

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:41.480
and create our destruction.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.360
In every way we get frustrated,

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.080
and we start seeking what's the matter?

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.240
Then we turn to religion

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.640
and we find in religion also

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.600
it just works worse and worse.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.440
Whatever is written in the Bible,

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.240
same about written in Koran if you read it, or Dhammapada

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.560
or Gita everywhere is about just the same,

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.720
there's not much of a change.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:17.360
But still we may follow any religion,

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.560
so-called following I would say.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:26.880
Still a human being belonging to any religion can commit any sin,

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.760
any sin.

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.840
There's no binding force on him of that religion.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.080
Why is it all these great religions,

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:40.640
which were created by great incarnations

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.080
and great prophets

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:51.160
have taken such a deviated path,

00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.720
and why we have not been able to achieve

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.480
whatever they have promised to us?

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:04.280
What is the reason why we could not achieve that?

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.760
What has gone wrong?

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.480
If you read Koran you will be amazed,

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:19.120
the description of what was the vision of Mohammad Sahib

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:22.440
is far away from the Muslims as they are.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.000
Same about Christians you can say.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:31.440
When Christ has said "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:36.760
Difficult to find Christians who don't have.

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.800
In this way we have to realize on one side

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.240
whatever mental efforts we are putting,

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.480
or on the other side whatever

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.760
physical or emotional efforts we are putting,

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.880
have come back to us,

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.880
destroying us.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:10.280
We can see the result very clearly

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.800
why all these problems are there.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:19.360
Still we adhere to something which is not reality.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.720
We go on clinging to it

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.720
because perhaps we are born like that.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.080
Perhaps we think that that's we have done now all our lives

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.840
so why give up.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.880
And the forefathers have done the same,

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:34.840
you are doing the same.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.480
But now a new category of very honest people are there

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:42.960
in this world who are seeking beyond.

00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:46.880
William Blake has called them men of God,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.080
those who will seek the truth

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:56.000
and they will make other people also godly.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.840
That's the time has come, this resurrection time has come we should say

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.440
or this is the Last Judgment.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.560
This Last Judgment is going to be done

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.920
by this Kundalini, the power within you.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:12.360
This is your own power

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.920
which has to be awakened

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.440
and once it is awakened it passes through these centers as told to you

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.160
and lets you know that these are your problems.

00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.200
These are the problems of your chakras.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.880
They may be physical, may be emotional,

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.960
they may be, could be also spiritual.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:36.840
And once you know these problems

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.120
and if you know how to solve these problems

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:47.880
you can be a very normal, sensible, balanced personality.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.360
That's not the only thing that happens

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:53.920
when you get your self realization.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.800
Firstly what happens to you is that

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.360
when the Kundalini passes through your Agyna chakra

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.720
then you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:13.560
If you see all the sciences they have created about religion,

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:18.480
talks and the whole thing, it's just mental.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:25.360
It's not inside, it's not innate, built within.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.400
So one thought rises, another thought falls.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:31.560
Another thought rises and falls down,

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.440
some come from the future, some come from the past,

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:40.200
and we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:44.120
But if you say now, this is the present,

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.240
stop your mind at the stop point

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.040
which is the present, you can't,

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.160
you just can't do it.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.360
Between these thoughts there is a gap.

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.920
This gap is the present, but it's so small, it's so small

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.520
that you cannot find it.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:08.080
But when the Kundalini passes through,

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.320
then this center, then these two institutions as you see them,

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.280
the conditioning and the ego are just sucked in.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.120
As a result you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.960
Means there is no thought.

00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:25.080
But you are absolutely aware, very much more aware.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.440
For example if you look at this beautiful hall

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:33.360
with the thoughtless awareness,

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.920
then the whole picture becomes clear

00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:40.560
like a photo in your mind,

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:47.440
whole thing is stored up into every detail so clearly

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.960
because present is the truth,

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:53.640
past is finished and future doesn't exist.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.920
So to come to the present you have to have

00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:01.200
this new awareness called as thoughtless awareness.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.840
But when She crosses over

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.800
and pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:12.440
which is the actualization of your baptism.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.360
Just people talk of baptism, "Come along I'll baptize you".

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.960
It's not possible that way.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.480
It's just an artificial ritual.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.480
Try to understand, this is not going to render

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.040
that actual happening within you

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.040
which is going to make you grow spiritually.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.720
So the actualization of baptism takes place

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.520
and you can feel also from your fontanel bone area

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:41.920
a kind of a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming in.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.600
You feel extremely relaxed.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.960
Secondly that you jump into another higher awareness

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.880
which we call, as collective consciousness.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.840
This means that

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.600
not only that you can you feel your own centers on your fingertips,

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:06.680
because these cool vibrations you can call

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:09.240
them start flowing through your own hands,

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.600
you can feel them.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.640
But also you get information about others

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:19.760
as well as about yourself on these fingertips.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:27.320
Automatically you become like a person who is a computer.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.200
It starts working in such a wonderful manner

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.600
that you can find out about any disease,

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.120
any trouble without going through all the diagnosis or anything,

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:42.040
and if you know how to cure these troubles, physically, mentally,

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:46.080
you can definitely cure yourself and also others

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.920
if you have reached that state

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:52.800
and have permanently achieved it.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.640
This is what has to happen to us.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:01.080
All of us have to achieve that state

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.520
which is your right to achieve it.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.280
Sahaja means with you is born.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.560
This yoga means the union.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:16.800
The union with this All Pervading Power of God's love.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.760
It exists or not, we have never bothered to find out.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.680
We see these beautiful flowers,

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.720
very beautiful flowers and everything around.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.240
When I came from Sydney I saw the beauty,

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:35.880
the nature had just spread for the pleasure of human beings,

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.360
we never even think how it has happened,

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.960
what has worked it out, all these living things.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.280
We don't even think how this eye of ours

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:50.480
is such a beautiful camera, how it has been made,

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:54.480
how is it this brain which is such a great computer,

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:59.240
how is it made. Who has made it?

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.760
They may say it is autonomous but who is this auto?

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.440
We have never tried to find out.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.880
That there is this All Pervading Power of God's love

00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.240
which has done all this living work

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.400
and now for us it is to feel that,

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:17.240
that is the yoga is, the union with that Divine.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.920
It's not physical, it's not mental,

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.200
but it is spiritual where

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:26.680
you start first time feeling this All Pervading Power.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:30.720
Then only you have to know how to use this power

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.600
which flows through you.

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:38.320
But it moves very slowly and people,

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.680
you see this is not a plastic work

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.600
that you can go on producing many

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.040
and we don't have any organization as such,

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:47.080
we do not organize people

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.760
and we do not take any money at all, you cannot.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.920
How much can you pay for this Divine Work?

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:57.120
How much do we pay to Mother Earth for what she gives us

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.200
all these beautiful flowers?

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.680
She doesn't understand money, so you cannot pay for it.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.840
But there are many, many organizations afloat,

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.480
which are taking money, which are giving you mental heat

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.120
and people run after them,

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:14.680
they like to go on working out that yarn

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.480
that they have spun for you.

00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.400
One has to go beyond this mind to feel the spirituality.

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:28.160
With this mind, that is human mind, you cannot understand it,

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.360
you have to have Divine mind.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:32.480
But once you get your realization

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.080
your mind also gets enlightened,

00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.560
and when your mind is enlightened, you can perceive,

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.360
penetrate into every situation

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:49.840
in such a deeper manner and the way you can improve it.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.200
I can tell you a simple analogy to understand.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:51:01.160
Supposing you are standing in the sea and the sea is rough,

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.440
you are afraid of the waves, very much afraid.

00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:08.080
But supposing somebody puts you on the boat,

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:12.200
and then you can see those waves and enjoy them.

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.680
But supposing you learn how to swim

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:17.480
then you can jump in and save them.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.760
It is not any brainwashing

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:24.240
or any sort of a bombardment of words,

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.160
but it is something that happens to you.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.760
You become something as you have become human beings,

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.040
you become realized souls

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:39.040
as a result of this last breakthrough of your evolution.

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.960
This is happening everywhere no doubt

00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.840
and it's working out very well in,

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.240
I think they told me, 62 countries

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.680
but at least I know of definitely of 52 countries

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.280
where there We have got very strong centers

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.160
where it is working out.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.320
Now whatever we are telling you here

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.800
you need not accept blindfolded.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:04.800
Blind faith is of no use.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.080
First of all you must experience.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.800
Just like a hypothesis I am putting this before you,

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:15.080
but you should have an open mind of a scientist.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:18.800
Just open your mind and see for yourself it works.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.680
If it works then you have to accept.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.880
If you are honest you have to accept.

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.640
If it doesn't work. If it works with many,

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.160
why not try and work it out.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.480
Most of the people do get their realization. I have seen it.

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.440
It's a wonderful thing that is happening

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.600
that masses of people can get realization.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:41.880
Depends on also certain places like Russia I was amazed.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.760
Where they have not heard the name of God

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:45.320
they have never heard the name of Christ.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.360
They were not allowed to read Bible or any book,

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.200
they had no religion at all.

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.080
They believed in no religion.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.720
Where thousands and thousands come to My program

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.600
and they all get their realization.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.240
In a small place called Togliati

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:07.040
there are 22 thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.960
Can you imagine it? I was so amazed.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:15.400
Same about Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.720
I was amazed how these people, Czechoslovakia,

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:21.560
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so fast,

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:25.080
just like fish to water,

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.800
how they realized it, and nobody else,

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.720
all these false people, could not go there,

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.560
nothing could work out.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.000
Only thing that has really worked out there

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:39.600
is something that is genuine. That is Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.760
One has to realize that as we are not in the Absolute State,

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.480
we have to reach to the Absolute State.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.840
That desire should be there.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.240
If that desire is there it works out

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.240
without any difficulty.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.720
It is your own power which manifests

00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:00.800
and gradually you can manifest them in such a way

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:05.880
that you can do so many things like giving realization to others,

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:12.600
curing others and also enjoying it,

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:18.720
because when the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:23.000
it fills you up with complete joy,

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:28.000
and joy has not two sides like happiness and unhappiness.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:33.600
It's singular, it's absolute and you are then,

00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:41.160
they say they are swimming in the ocean of joy.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.000
So beautiful it is.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:50.680
This new race, we can call it.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.120
The new society, is already formed.

00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:58.040
It's there, they're angel-like people, beautiful.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.120
I never tell them, don't drink, don't smoke,

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.600
don't take drugs, nothing of the kind. I don't tell them,

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.160
it just automatically drops out

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.240
because in the light they see the ignorance that they had.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.840
They see the darkness and they just drop it.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.680
We don't have to tell them anything,

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:21.320
not to brainwash them or anything; it just works automatically.

00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:23.920
You don't have to follow any kind

00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:27.160
of a fundamental groups or things, nothing of the kind.

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:32.280
You just know this is fundamental because you have got

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.280
the light within you, then they see the goodness,

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:37.840
then they see the oneness of all the religions.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.440
So if you know the oneness of all the religions,

00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.520
why will you be fundamentalist?

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:46.720
If you belong to one organization or to another church

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.600
or to another religion then you fight.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:53.200
When you get into compartments like this, then only you fight.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.160
Everybody thinks we are the chosen ones,

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.640
that's how we have this fundamentalism now,

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.600
knocking at our doors. So to get rid of it

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.600
the best thing is. First of all

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.080
you have to become a universal being,

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:11.120
and this Spirit is the Universal Being.

00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.080
Once you become the Universal Being

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.120
then you will be surprised to see it,

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:19.520
that all these differences you saw because of complete ignorance.

00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.160
For example there is light you can see each other here,

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.960
but supposing there is complete pitch darkness,

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.760
you don't know who's sitting here, who is right, who is left..

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.080
You don't know how to walk.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.360
You may trample over people, you may just get frightened,

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.880
you may run helter skelter.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.920
But if there is light you see things so clearly.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:43.080
In the same way Sahaja Yoga works first.

00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:46.160
Some people get not all the light I should say,

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.840
but they do get a little light, a glimmer of light,

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.360
and then it starts expanding. And when it expands

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.280
you will be amazed how things work out.

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.360
Also I have seen people after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.040
they become extremely intelligent, absorbent,

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.560
and a kind of a very dynamic personality comes in them.

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.960
Now you have seen these Australians singing Sanskrit songs.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.240
I mean imagine, Sanskrit,

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:15.320
even these English lived in India for 300 years,

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.040
they couldn't learn one sentence of Hindi language,

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:22.360
leave alone Sanskrit, but the way they are singing with such

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:25.240
clarity, even the Indians are surprised

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.680
at how they are singing our songs in Sanskrit language.

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:30.280
It is an impossibility,

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.920
you cannot think of a Western person singing like this

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.320
with all the rhythm and the melody and all that

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.920
and in no time they pick it up.

00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:44.360
There are artists and artists who have now got world fame in India

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.840
after coming to Sahaja Yoga. We have got here also

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.880
some artists who were painters and have become very,

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.000
have got a good name for themselves. Everything changes.

00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.840
You become on top of the world but you don't become competitive,

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.200
you start enjoying each other.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.240
Such a brotherhood, such love, such friendship,

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:13.520
that you become one drop becoming an ocean,

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:16.640
microcosm becoming the macrocosm.

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.840
We talk about these things but we have never achieved it.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.480
Now the time has come for us to achieve all this.

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:28.680
In this one lecture I know I can't talk much.

00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.200
Last year also I was here

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:34.680
and Lord Mayor was here also to grace the occasion.

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.640
I found him to be a remarkable person,

00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.200
the way he got his realization.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:42.520
You are especially blessed people I think,

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:46.400
Newcastle with this beautiful lake here

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:50.880
and beautiful surroundings, and I hope that

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:53.480
Sahaja Yoga will work out here very well.

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.960
Gradually it will take its roots,

00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:01.160
and you can have a real good center in Newcastle.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.320
May God bless you all.
