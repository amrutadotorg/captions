00:56.260 --> 01:03.280
to know this knowledge of the roots

01:00.809 --> 01:05.770
unless and until you know the knowledge

01:03.280 --> 01:08.410
of the roots how will you know about the

01:05.770 --> 01:10.960
treat you cannot treat the treatment on

01:08.410 --> 01:13.869
its leaves or branches you have to do

01:10.960 --> 01:17.950
the roots first you find out the roots

01:13.869 --> 01:20.050
in Buddhism is so superficial now that

01:17.950 --> 01:25.810
have myself amazed and Radames living

01:20.050 --> 01:28.479
for God from where death he says buddham

01:25.810 --> 01:30.869
sharanam gachami what is it this is an

01:28.479 --> 01:30.869
enlightened

01:31.950 --> 01:38.760
the dumbest work with analyzer some

01:36.240 --> 01:42.240
gumption cachaca means to the collective

01:38.760 --> 01:45.690
in tandem is facilitating the monster

01:42.240 --> 01:47.820
the mummy is the balancing how many

01:45.690 --> 01:49.580
booties know about they don't know even

01:47.820 --> 01:53.280
where Buddha is sitting on their head

01:49.580 --> 01:55.640
and what I find most of the booties but

01:53.280 --> 02:00.720
their center of Buddha is finished so

01:55.640 --> 02:05.399
thighs disappeared from their husband

02:00.720 --> 02:07.860
and he set me down here on the head on

02:05.399 --> 02:09.860
the left hand we can prove it on

02:07.860 --> 02:12.830
Kundalini

02:09.860 --> 02:14.790
supposing somebody is following Goethe

02:12.830 --> 02:19.980
immediately people will know that you

02:14.790 --> 02:21.510
are because it's a catchy and then some

02:19.980 --> 02:30.030
methods are there to awaken him

02:21.510 --> 02:37.739
if you all right so you must know the

02:30.030 --> 02:42.890
knowledge of routine we should not just

02:37.739 --> 02:42.890
depend on to these lambs or any ism

02:47.900 --> 03:15.890
yeah see we have to have complete

02:51.019 --> 03:17.930
integrated knowledge no no there is no

03:15.890 --> 03:21.950
system about it there's no system no

03:17.930 --> 03:24.970
practice no person actually it is for

03:21.950 --> 03:28.819
take I am talking about few revolutions

03:24.970 --> 03:32.000
your evolution comes through a living

03:28.819 --> 03:36.560
force of the Living God you cannot have

03:32.000 --> 03:38.930
a course in that can you not how do you

03:36.560 --> 03:40.940
sprout the season you have to just put

03:38.930 --> 03:43.220
it in the mother earth it sprouts myself

03:40.940 --> 03:51.769
is building in the same way within you

03:43.220 --> 03:54.530
it is building and it stops maybe you

03:51.769 --> 03:57.519
may not get you today use it some seed

03:54.530 --> 03:57.519
sprouts faster

04:05.890 --> 04:08.700
is going out

04:09.680 --> 04:14.580
nunim which is you're sadly mistaken

04:12.330 --> 04:16.109
about Buddhism the trouble is with the

04:14.580 --> 04:18.269
Western people they are so fed up with

04:16.109 --> 04:19.650
Christianity that they think the visa

04:18.269 --> 04:24.630
meals are going to solve the problem

04:19.650 --> 04:28.290
that just like any other all these Lama

04:24.630 --> 04:31.380
should be hanged by the neck here these

04:28.290 --> 04:33.600
people they're horrible either vibration

04:31.380 --> 04:36.060
you miss Dalai Lama Monday sitting next

04:33.600 --> 04:38.340

04:55.500 --> 04:59.789
understand even a given child who the

04:58.020 --> 05:02.910
realized soul will understand but you

04:59.789 --> 05:05.310
won't because you are not difference

05:02.910 --> 05:07.139

years of age when my daughter and the

05:09.680 --> 05:14.760
son-in-law went to LA it's an

05:12.389 --> 05:16.620
interesting story and there was a llama

05:20.160 --> 05:25.740
made it anymore when the father went and

05:23.039 --> 05:27.660
touched his food she just stood back and

05:25.740 --> 05:29.639

05:42.660 --> 05:47.160
won't understand even a little child

05:45.419 --> 05:50.310

05:47.160 --> 05:52.870
realized soul is a person

05:50.310 --> 05:55.420
this is what could I say does not read

05:52.870 --> 05:57.850
east on things yes said first of all see

05:55.420 --> 05:59.800
yourself would that did he talk about

05:57.850 --> 06:01.480
God why because he thought if you talk

05:59.800 --> 06:01.990
about God again another religion in

06:01.480 --> 06:04.120
stock

06:01.990 --> 06:06.160
he just said first of all as I said

06:04.120 --> 06:11.500
first of all teach yourself get yourself

06:06.160 --> 06:15.460
knowledge nothing else but get your

06:11.500 --> 06:18.640
realization or exactly so whether having

06:15.460 --> 06:21.670
it better have it you seem to have good

06:18.640 --> 06:25.240
reason there's nothing like that these

06:21.670 --> 06:27.550
people are meant to have it means to get

06:25.240 --> 06:29.650
realization what tradition are the

06:27.550 --> 06:33.640
college carrying that ring like names

06:29.650 --> 06:37.660
like that Matthew please that was

06:33.640 --> 06:39.460
pathetic he thought his realization fit

06:37.660 --> 06:42.220
into all these nonsensical things with

06:39.460 --> 06:43.720
llamas and they even beat people and who

06:42.220 --> 06:46.330
all kinds of seemed horrible twelve

06:43.720 --> 06:49.210
people have got their out of that NASA

06:46.330 --> 06:50.950
you should see the pivotal now they are

06:49.210 --> 06:52.900
sitting on our head like parasites in

06:50.950 --> 06:55.000
England and we had a parliament question

06:52.900 --> 06:57.430
on them you see they look very

06:55.000 --> 06:59.980
attractive because you have fed up with

06:57.430 --> 07:01.480
your this charity that's what don't

06:59.980 --> 07:02.920
believe in all this please whether they

07:01.480 --> 07:08.980
induce Christians who scream all are

07:02.920 --> 07:11.580
doing nothing you become the realized

07:08.980 --> 07:11.580
version

07:12.520 --> 07:16.630
you have beat it all right that's what

07:16.060 --> 07:19.110
I'm saying

07:16.630 --> 07:19.110
as a mother

07:19.870 --> 07:24.040
and then if they started another one

07:21.550 --> 07:26.770
Shambhala business this is another new

07:24.040 --> 07:30.010
thing taking everybody to go be there

07:26.770 --> 07:31.419
and to get somebody walking that Kobe

07:30.010 --> 07:37.450
does not even one mile you will get a

07:31.419 --> 07:39.490
Samadhi permanently lots of water there

07:55.630 --> 07:59.530
going to happen to them think of the

07:56.979 --> 08:03.520
Gobi Desert is one of the worst deserts

07:59.530 --> 08:07.270
of the world can you imagine going to a

08:03.520 --> 08:10.290
desert how will you reach God you have

08:07.270 --> 08:10.290
to seek in the English

08:17.610 --> 08:27.500
is there any other question of put

08:22.259 --> 08:27.500
attention to that that is important

08:33.279 --> 08:39.009
but one thing more when you follow them

08:36.370 --> 08:39.939
you never ask questions I had one lady

08:39.009 --> 08:43.050
from a llama

08:39.939 --> 08:46.689
she came down from Norway she was

09:11.230 --> 09:16.269
can't live in an ordinary house you have

09:13.360 --> 09:18.610

09:16.269 --> 09:20.470
ourselves within one year we collected

09:18.610 --> 09:22.540
money made a Marvel show for the fellows

09:20.470 --> 09:25.420
we came and was sitting on the seventh

09:22.540 --> 09:29.740
step and we were first one year we had

09:25.420 --> 09:32.470

09:29.740 --> 09:36.999
time then he might in every day and I

09:32.470 --> 09:44.110
have done that course but I said in

09:36.999 --> 09:45.819
charge why any one of course I like that

09:44.110 --> 09:49.600
you are because that shows you a free

09:45.819 --> 09:51.390
world I am NOT mesmerised but must see

09:49.600 --> 09:54.450
the sense

09:51.390 --> 09:55.130
Oh how do we accept the good huh let's

09:54.450 --> 09:58.730

09:55.130 --> 09:58.730
have you seen Buddha

10:01.160 --> 10:08.450
I will met him have you met anybody who

10:05.900 --> 10:14.180
is a Buddhist who says he can give

10:08.450 --> 10:19.040
realization but then why are we the

10:14.180 --> 10:21.320
preachers of Buddha whom they have never

10:19.040 --> 10:22.040
seen on the way we don't know anything

10:21.320 --> 10:25.640
about him

10:22.040 --> 10:27.410
why because I am living he's not when he

10:25.640 --> 10:31.580
was living there are people who were

10:27.410 --> 10:32.390
asking about other people better be in

10:31.580 --> 10:37.270
the present

10:32.390 --> 10:37.270
