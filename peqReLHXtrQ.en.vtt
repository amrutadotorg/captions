00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.600
These are the songs sung in Himalayas, and to be sung here

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.520
is something really remarkable, isn’t it?

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.540
They brought it all the way here to be sung here.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.580
Now I think I have already given you a very,

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.520
very long lecture and the speech as you call it,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.740
but some reactions were very good and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.580
some could absorb it very well,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.640
but some they said were sleeping.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.630
Now these things happen because of negativity.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.600
You have to fight your negativity because negativity

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.640
is the thing that ask questions,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.520
because when I am talking I am telling the Truth,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.590
absolute Truth, but it asks questions and it reflects.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.710
When it starts reflecting, nothing goes in the head because

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.730
you are left with the past sentence and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.590
the present you are not with it, so the whole thing

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.730
boils down to something like an escape and then

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.640
you escape to sleep off.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.720
When I tried My level best today to put you on to your

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.550
conscious mind.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.570
You have to be conscious, you have to be alert,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.710
and that’s the point is: that unless and until you are

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.600
conscious, you cannot ascend.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.630
Any abnormal person cannot ascend.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.680
You have to normalize yourself.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.550
So many of you had lots of abnormalities

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.640
which were brought out and thrown away,

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.640
and many have been cleansed,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.540
but now if there are some still lingering with it,

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.520
they must work it out.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.670
They cannot just go on justifying it.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.620
Normally negative persons attract a negative personality.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.520
So if you have such a negativity of any kind within you,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.620
you should never sit next to a negative person,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.730
never go near such a person, keep away but stick on

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.650
with the positive person, like I said stick on

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.700
and support your leaders without question,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.710
without questioning, but this is the trouble that

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.720
you start fighting your own leader.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560
If the leader say something to you,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.740
you quarrel with the leader, and you argue with the leader,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.680
so it’s finished.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.530
I speak through the leaders,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.730
so you don’t question it.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.610
If you question it, then there will be a problem,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.740
you have to stick on with your leaders

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.700
who are positive people.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.520
And if you start questioning them,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.650
then you will be nowhere, no link between you and Me.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.710
And this is everywhere, I was told in Switzerland

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.710
it is like this, in France now it is better,

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.520
it’s used to be like that, everywhere, except for Italy,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.740
I think Italy has the best results.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.600
Don’t fight with your leaders; don’t argue with them.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.680
Do not reflect about Sahaja Yoga, what can you say?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.710
What do you know? How can you reflect?

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.720
What is your knowledge?

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.620
Do you question your chemistry teacher when he says

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.570
hydrogen, has got two atoms or one atom?  Do you?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.590
And when you start doing this with your ego,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:51.660
you are thrown out of the realm of evolution.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.680
So do not reflect, just listen, and try to take it inside.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.640
These are all mantras; take them inside.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.610
Instead of that you start questioning,

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.580
arguing with your leaders, giving them advices,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.590
please don’t do it, stop it now.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.510
This is no politics where everybody can advice,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.500
everybody has to say something.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.740
Mostly the bhoots are such;

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:19.720
only the bhootish people go on advising,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.530
and having their own say.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.590
And they go against the leaders throughout.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.580
Now specially for the elderly people,

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.700
I would say because you are more grown up sometimes

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.570
than the leader are.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.590
Then you think you have the right to correct the leaders,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.520
it’s not so.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.540
In Sahaja Yoga, it is not how much you are old,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.620
but it is how much you are evolved.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.700
So when you start questioning your leaders and

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.730
reflecting on their behavior or anything like that,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.520
and answering them back or also giving your ideas,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.560
you are gone.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.720
It’s like a link.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.680
Say there’s a link

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.570
between the chakras and the cells, say it like that.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:16.680
Now if you deny the chakras, how one has to work it out,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.650
because I am connected with them

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.550
and through them you are connected.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.720
But when you deny them, then you fall out.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.560
I know what to do with the leaders, I choose them,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.660
I arrange them, I organize them, I change them;

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.550
I know what to do.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.720
Now you people do not challenge them,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.560
is nothing but your ego.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.650
In India it doesn’t happen at all, doesn’t happen.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.710
Once Mother is appointed somebody this is accept,

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.500
because for them this is the Truth

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.600
that they have been seeking.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.510
The all other are nonsenses, it's all complications,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.730
and because you are so complicated

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.650
that they have been look nice,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.510
you think you are surrendering your personalities.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.570
Not at all. It’s developing, surrendering yourself

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.570
to the sap of life, to the vitality,

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.550
to the vital force of life, surrender, accept more,

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.590
accept more.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.730
This ego can never allow your to take inside anything.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.700
Be careful on that.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.740
This will never allow you to sleep;

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.540
this will never give you peace.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.500
It will never allow you to grow;

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.560
it will never take you to your own goal,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.590
so surrender that your ego of yours.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.720
So one thing I have to tell you: don’t fight, don’t quarrel,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.550
don’t question, don’t reflect about your leaders

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.630
to begin with,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.550
otherwise you will be cut off.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:50.510
Keep in his good book.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.700
Try to support him, ask him what does he want,

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.640
what help he needs.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.630
The more you get attached to him,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:03.710
the more you get closer to him, the more you will get.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.500
But see people are very wasteful.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.740
They have wasted their lives in drugs, this, that,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.550
all nonsense; and women have another bad habit,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.600
is to gossip.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.520
They want to gossip,

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.730
gossip about this person, criticize that person.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.720
It’s a very bad habit in women to gossip.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.550
I never pay heed to anyone who gossips and

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.580
I don’t like a person who gossips,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.710
so don’t gossip about things, cheaply, frivolously talking

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.640
about others.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.640
It’s not necessary you should be educated,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.660
it’s not necessary that you should come from a

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.720
very well-bred family, nothing is necessary as long as you

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.620
are a Sahaja Yogi. You can be a diamond,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:59.520
but allow yourself to be cut into the diamond. Allow!

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.720
So the reaction from some person was very good,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.630
they absorbed what I said, they took everything inside,

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.740
but some of them went off to sleep.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.630
Now, if those who were struggling at that time

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.740
may not have understood it - it’s a very difficult subject -

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.630
I told you it’s a very subtle subject, doesn’t matter.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.630
But those who have been like that,

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:26.570
should look after themselves, should find out.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:28.650
I found one thing with left-sided people:

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.560
if they can put a candle near their left Swadisthana,

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.640
little far, and put one candle before the photograph and

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.710
put left hand towards the photograph and right hand

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:44.510
on the Mother Earth, it works.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.710
And the candle at the back should be kept a little far away

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.540
because it makes sounds, it goes this way, that way, burns.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.600
Those who have been taking drugs, not LSD but other drugs,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.740
who are drowsy people, who feel sleepy,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.660
whose brains are destroyed by drug, all those people

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.690
can benefit a lot by this. Do it everyday.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.560
Going into drug, you never felt your surrender to drugs,

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.640
never felt that

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.710
it was something that was going to kill you completely.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.530
You know so many people are killed, so many are dying,

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:24.690
but you wanted to do that, I don’t know because

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.590
your ego said, “All right, go ahead, try this.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.520
You are the one, nothing will happen to you.”

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.540
That is the ego suggests. So you did it.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.580
All right doesn’t matter,

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.720
whatever has happened has happened, let us clear it out,

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.500
because we are seekers.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.600
So those who have really felt one in the lecture,

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.660
without any questioning,

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.740
should know that they are doing well.

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.600
Those who were questioning, reflecting, should know

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.520
they have ego, and those who were dozing out should know

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.530
that they are left-sided.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.550
Left side is worst than the right side

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.600
because right side can be easily corrected, it shows.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.640
It shows outside, people don’t like it.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.690
Such a person is criticized, everybody says:

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:22.540
"He is egoistical", he is this, that.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.580
Everybody knows that such a person goes out like Hitler.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:28.700
But the left-sided person, you see, is very

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.500
pitiable and you have very great pity for such a person,

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.610
you sympathize and you get lost with that person.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.730
They are more dangerous and difficult to be cured,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.520
very difficult.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.550
So, it’s not an easy task, we have to work it out.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.640
I am trying My level best; you should also help Me.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.680
I was thinking that if you can start using little oil

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.570
for your head will be a good idea in the night.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.510
As Sahaja yogis, you should. I think the hairstyle

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.630
should be changed for Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.570
This modern, fashionable style won’t suit us.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.590
Because this will, we will all have bald heads one day,

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.680
I can tell you, and you will see the Sahashrara

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:16.500
with a big dimple here. Better use some nice coconut oil,

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.690
rub in your head nicely, and in the night and

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:22.540
in the morning.

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:24.560
After all, it doesn’t show much.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.560
And comb your hair in a proper way because also I think

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.530
if your dresses are like bhoots,

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.690
your hair are like bhoots and the bhoots will take over

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.700
thinking, “Oh, this is a bhoot sitting down here;

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.730
I better take hold of that bhoot.”

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.690
So dress up in a way, shouldn’t have hair on your forehead

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.650
at all, keep it straight, make it nice and have it

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:45.610
absolutely clean foreheads.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.560
We are Sahaja yogis. We have to change our dresses;

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.720
we have to change ours styles.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.590
You cannot be fashionable like these stupid punks.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.680
So we are a type, by our hairstyles people should know that

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.690
these are Sahaja yogis.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.620
So before you start getting bald, better try putting

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.600
some oil in your head.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:09.610
That is some very important thing

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:10.720
that Sahaja Yogis have to do.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.650
You can take vibrated oil if you like and I think olive oil

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.620
is good, but better than olive oil, I find,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.680
it is coconut oil is better for the growth of the hair.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.580
But sometimes you can also put almond oil, is also good,

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.630
almond oil for you because if you have any problem

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:36.740
that you feel exhausted or your nerves need attention,

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.560
you are nervous type of person,

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.700
then almond oil is good for you.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.540
And for people who have teeth which are troubling them

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.690
they must look after them.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.530
No use going to the dentists,

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.630
because dentists create problems.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.570
Simple thing is to use olive oil and some salt and rub it

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.610
on your gums nicely everyday before sleeping.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.550
That will keep your teeth all right. You’ll be amazed,

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.590
till today I have not been to any dentists.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.500
Never been to a dentist

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.600
and I hope I wouldn't go to a dentist.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.620
So, but one thing is that I have certain bad habits,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.560
one of them is that I brush my teeth quite often.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.660
But, don’t use electrical brushes and all that,

00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:29.740
but use brushes or use your fingers is the best way is to

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:36.570
rub with the salt and the oil, is a very good for you,

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.600
and then allow the whole thing to come out and then wash it.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:44.570
Then the third thing I find in Europe

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:47.620
that you people do not clear your throats,

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.550
and your tongues,

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.670
which is another thing very much against Vishuddhi.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.500
And that must be one of the reasons why

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.640
your Vishuddhis are bad.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.500
So though it is not in fashionable here, in the West,

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.680
but very important thing is to put your

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:07.710
two fingers in the mouth and rub your fingers, not the thing,

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.680
fingers and clean your tongue in such a way that

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.640
everything comes out in the morning,

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.580
is important because that accumulates and then it rots.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.570
So this has to be done and may be that you might think that

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.720
this is really making noise and all that, doesn’t matter,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.640
you have to clear out your throat,

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:30.560
that’s how you’ll keep your Vishuddhis very clear.

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.730
This is one of the things and another thing is that

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.650
you must always use water, as much as possible,

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.720
for washing when you go for your morning ...

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.670
water must be used, paper is a very dirty and

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.570
unhygienic habit, very dirty and unhygienic habit.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.690
But, even if you use paper, you must use water after that.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.610
Is very important that all the time the water

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.590
should be used as much as possible.

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:03.550
For Sahaja yogis, it is a very, very important thing.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:08.610
Now, for some people who will find that they are

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:17.600
on a subtler level, quite on the verge of collapse

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.570
in the way that they still have those problems that they

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.650
want to sleep with other women and they want to do

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.690
all these things, they should give up Sahaja yoga.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.510
Best is to leave us alone.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.540
We can’t have such useless people with us.

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.520
So they should give up Sahaja yoga and don’t trouble us

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:34.720
because we can get thousands and thousands in India,

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.690
we have no problem, for them it is not difficult,

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.680
they are already there. So, those who are still like that,

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:46.660
who are trying to have relations with other women and

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.700
having their eyes on other women;

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.610
and or the women like that, you see, all this kind of

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.690
maniacs, I call them maniacs only,

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.530
should give up Sahaja yoga and should spare us.

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.690
This is for definite.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.540
Now, we have always been saying that those who are

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.620
very negative people will have to leave Sahaja yoga

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.670
and the day will come, so for all of you

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.680
it is very necessary that you should try to clean yourself

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:16.710
and never sit with a person who is negative.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.640
Never make friendship with a person who is negative.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:24.690
Try to be more helpful to a person who is positive.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.610
Clear out yourself.  Clean out yourself;

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.540
look after yourself; respect yourself; love yourself.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:33.730
Live with your dignity.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.700
Cheapish thing, frivolous thing,

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.720
useless thing should not be done,

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.640
and make your ego be challenged.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:45.550
Let somebody insult you and see that

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.630
that you do not answer back.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.650
Just see it, not to get into temper.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:56.500
Try that your ego doesn’t react.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:03.530
That can be achieved very easily if you try in the mirror,

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.590
look at yourself and laugh at yourself,

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:07.730
make fun of yourself.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:09.700
You think of yourself.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.590
Who are you?  What do you have?  Nothing.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:20.580
Now today’s lecture was really, was not only,

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.550
was a great lecture, but also it was like mantras.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.580
All good for the brain, and I would say that this lecture

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.720
must be listened to again and again, and to be taken in -

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.510
not to be questioned, not to be questioned, to be taken in,

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.540
to be absorbed.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.620
I hope you understand this.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.660
Now after this Sahashrara Puja I hope you people

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.730
try to maintain the position you have reached.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:18:01.700
I would expect all of you to support, to glorify your leaders

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:05.510
and not in any way debate them, argue with them,

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:07.530
give them ideas.

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.610
Even the wives I have said are not to argue

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.550
with the leaders.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.690
It’s like pulling each other, like they said there

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.560
were some scorpions sent for investigation

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.500
from different places.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.680
And they saw one jar was open, and they said,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.710
“What is this? This, from this jar all the scorpions

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.500
will jump out.”

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.520
They said, “They cannot, because as one comes up,

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.610
another pulls him down.”

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.590
In the same way we behave. So if there’s a leader,

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.640
this is ego that makes you jealous, and this is ego

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.680
that says that you know better,

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.540
you better give a solution.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.510
Not that you cannot suggest people,

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.680
tell Me also things, but if it doesn’t accept,

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.580
well and good.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.670
That’s a challenge to your ego.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:01.550
It’s better that he says “no” to you

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.610
so that you see for yourself,

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.720
“Is it my ego still insisting on that position?”

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.640
Now, on the second thing that I have said that

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.580
we should not be drawn by convention.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:20.680
Like the convention was that, say, this time the English

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:24.740
felt, the English leaders felt, which was a big mistake,

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:30.710
that Italians would be inconvenienced if they stay over.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.550
Italians are very large-hearted people, like Indians are,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.570
they will be overjoyed if they stay over.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.580
But it is the English mind.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.670
It’s the English who cannot tolerate one person staying

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:42.700
for two days.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:44.570
They’ll ask you immediately as you go,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.710
“What time are you leaving?”

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.710
So, it is their mind that worked out that way that

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:55.500
it will be inconvenient, because they’ll be inconvenienced.

00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.710
Though they were told, “You could stay here till Monday,

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.630
there’s no problem, you’ll have to pay just ten pounds,”

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.530
but I thought like that. This is an English image

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.700
of being good to others.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.640
Because to them, anybody staying in their house, finished,

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.710
they won’t allow anybody to come inside the house.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.540
Let there be snow or anything outside,

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.520
they’ll just see and talk to them and say.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.710
I’ve een it Myself.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.680
One day we had, I had gone out it was snowing,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.620
and I saw a lady standing out in the doorsteps

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:38.620
with a pram and there was a little baby and the other lady

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:41.650
was an old lady talking from inside,

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:47.500
just from the chink, in a way that the door was not

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.560
completely opened out.

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.550
And when I came back after an hour and so,

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.540
still that lady was standing outside and talking.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.690
This lady didn’t have sense to say that “You come in.”

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.540
But this another lady also did not mind it also because

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.670
she must be doing the same.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.580
So the large-heartedness of anything they cannot understand.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.550
Moreover, there was no problem,

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.520
it was suggested that you can stay here and you can be here.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.600
Now today we had to hurry up a lot.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.670
The whole thing was quite inconvenienced and

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:28.620
we had to do it because of a slight mistake.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.500
They should have asked Me and I thought you all

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.650
were staying on Monday because this is logical;

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.690
it is sensible.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.510
But because of the conception that we should not

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.510
inconvenience.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.540
It's not only with English, it's possible with anyone of you.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:49.600
When you start thinking, “I thought,” you are gone.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.630
So this concepts that you have, about things,

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.710
are actually very dangerous things.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.710
I’ve been having experiences of experiences of this stupid

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:06.640
conventions people have:  “I thought.”

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.690
They try to be good but ultimately try to be nasty.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.540
They are nasty.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.510
So that means there's something definitely wrong

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.670
with the convention they have about things and

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.660
that’s why people, if they were right when they

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:32.560
were thinking, world would have been a different thing.

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.670
But they are thinking at a level where it's just

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.610
everything is sloping down, and you are going downward.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.680
As soon as you start thinking, you go downward.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.600
Such is the defect of your thinking because it is bound

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.720
by the tanks of your conventions.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.700
Whenever you think, you see, you are bound by your

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.650
conventions and you go down.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.600
I didn’t touch many points today which I could have touched,

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.610
like art. I was saying, I was amazed and exuberant,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.640
like this the flower like this makes me so very happy

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.570
to see a garden.

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.530
But to a sophisticated mind, is more rock or

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:13.740
something nonsensical.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.720
To them, one flower somewhere because rest of the area

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.600
should be their space for their ego.

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.730
So they cannot see the beauty, it’s too much, too much,

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:37.530
even Sahaja Yoga is too much for us.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.600
What are you a little baby or what?

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.680
What is too much?

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.710
You see, as we like a baby we give a bottle,

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.710
so much of milk, so much of milk,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.710
so Sahaja Yoga is too much for you.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.690
You are draws or what?

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.540
There is no substance in such kind of a nonsense.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.510
That’s why, “This is sophisticated, this is nice,”

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.580
criticize everyone.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.580
People are so frightened even to decorate their houses,

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.610
because it will be criticized.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:12.500
Better keep it plain, white, just white.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.540
Even the nose they don’t like.

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.550
They want to cut out the nose, eyes, everything,

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.520
just have plain.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.670
And imagine, it's the play of the ego

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.650
which wants an individuality.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:32.580
How they are in just a position with what they

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.640
wanted to see this clearly?

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.690
If you go in a garden, they'll have one, you see, tree

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.660
somewhere hanging in there.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.710
This is supposed to be garden. You say,

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.640
“Where is the garden”? They say, “This is garden.”

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.720
Microscope.  “Where is the garden?”

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.670
“Oh no, we put only one tree at a point you see

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:58.720
so it becomes important.”

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.720
So this is only a tree here and then you move up,

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:05.620
then will be another little bush and another.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.680
Everything is too much. Why?

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.570
Because the ego is too much in their heads.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.660
That’s why everything is too much for them.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.540
This stupidity has to go now.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.510
You have to take whatever is good;

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.650
too much you must take and give up

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.660
whatever is too much in you.

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:30.700
That has to be understood.

00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.540
All these stupid ideas, all kinds of stupid ideas,

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:39.580
like you want to buy a house, so it’s all right,

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.540
you go and buy a house.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.700
I went round, most of the houses are about

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.680
seven and a half feet height, but they like it.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.710
I said, “Why?”

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.530
“It’s very old.”

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:54.710
I said, “So what?”

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.540
They said, “But it’s an old house, it is this and that

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:58.650
and that old house.”

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.500
I said, “But why do you like it?”

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.510
New houses are eight feet, at the most.

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.710
So there is no choice.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.600
But why do you want to have a house which is an old house?

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.680
Victorian houses they don’t like. Why?

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.680
Because they are not so conventional,

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.680
they are not so fashionable.

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.700
You must have a house where you should break your neck,

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.700
walk into the bathroom in an awkward way.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:30.540
You can’t even sit or stand, half way hang in the air.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.670
That’s a very house of the character.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:37.620
And the character is that which makes you awkward and

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.530
feel funny, that person has character, I mean the person,

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.730
if he is absurd, he is queer, weird, he is strange,

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:48.580
he is a man of character.

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.720
This is the situation today.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.610
He is a man of character and he is weird,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.650
absolutely a strange personality. How is it?

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.550
“You know he came on a bicycle with a half pant.”

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.510
I said, “Really?” The a man of character.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:07.730
“Yeah, he’s getting arthritis with it.”

00:27:08.550 --> 00:27:12.570
Doing queer, funny stupid things is regarded as

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.560
something of a personality.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.580
Now, as Sahaja yogis, you have to realize that

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.620
you are not that stupid.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:25.560
You are crowned with your Self.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:29.580
Now you are not going to behave like these stupid people,

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.640
and their fashions, to give it up.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.740
They laugh at you, you laugh at them.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.520
In a lunatic asylum, if you go, all the lunatics will say,

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:47.550
“Oh, so you have also come here to join us.” Isn’t it?

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.550
They all think they are the wisest and you get lost with them

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.690
You start thinking, “Am I lunatic myself?”

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:58.510
So you all when you see such a person

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.740
you should just laugh at him.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.700
Like a lady, she is thought out to be very fashionable,

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:11.500
came with a dress, you see, very open her body with

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.520
all her bones showing, and this and that.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:18.730
And we happen to go and see that house Myself and My husband.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.580
So as soon as he saw her, he came back and vomited.

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:25.620
I said, “What’s the matter?’”

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:29.520
“I saw her; I vomited.”

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.650
And we got into the car, we didn’t enter and we came away.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:36.600
And she thought she was a very fashionable lady,

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.690
showing her bones, all her body, horrible.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:43.630
Imagine, like a dead body standing before you.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.670
But a dead body is regarded as fashionable.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.620
Everybody wants to behave like a dead body.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.500
Now, you should see the sense in it.

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.680
Otherwise you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.520
You must see the nonsense that is going on and

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.710
you are not a nonsensical personality.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.560
All these things now if you see from a new angle,

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.620
as I told you now, that you are higher personalities,

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.710
that you have achieved a new awareness of your chakras,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.530
you’ll be amazed your reactions will be very,

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.540
very different. If you see something like this...

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:28.560
“Ahh!, you say, “Beautiful!”

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.670
But till you have those horrible conventions with you,

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.570
you cannot.

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.680
A house which is dilapidated absolutely going to fall

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.680
on your head is, “What a character!”

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:45.570
The whole character will fall on your head!

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:49.670
Absurd ideas people have.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:52.730
Or then they want something modern which is absolutely

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.570
weird and nonsensical.

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.740
You see, there was a lady, she built a house, modern,

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.610
and we had to climb up the steps,

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.640
and every steps she had divided into smaller,

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:07.580
smaller pieces, we were so much worried

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:08.740
that we’ll all fall off.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.620
You see, every step was made of small, small pieces,

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.730
like a step, you see every step was made into steps.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.740
So when you put your foot there and you don’t know

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.520
where you are putting your foot, you see.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.570
She must have spent a lot of money making that

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.700
kind of a nonsensical thing, but to her,

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.680
she would show everyone, “Now, come along, see this.”

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.590
I refused to go up, I said, “I have nothing to do.”

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:35.710
I went back. Yes, it doesn’t matter.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.710
As they show resentment, you must show resentment.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:41.670
Stupid,

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.540
it doesn’t appeal to Me,

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.740
it doesn’t appeal to Me these things.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.730
I have seen. I don’t like it these things,

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:55.540
the way there's one flower hanging somewhere,

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.700
and anything if I see, I see I don’t like it.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.700
I don’t enjoy it at all Myself.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.650
And if I am the criteria,

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.670
if I am the one who can judge things,

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:06.600
then I would tell you I don’t like all these nonsense.

00:31:06.670 --> 00:31:09.540
The way people dress up these days, they look like clowns

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:11.700
to Me, lunatics, like I can say brats,

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.720
or you can call them, what do you call them tramps.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:16.720
You cannot make out one from another.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.630
Lousy pants, you see,

00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.680
some grandfather’s pant they are wearing,

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:23.710
and grandmother’s blouse on top,

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.510
and the ladies walking on the street, see,

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.610
you feel some funny, queer people walking across,

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.670
and they think it is fashionable.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.630
I think from India we should get all old clothes here

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.710
and sell them off for a higher price.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.510
It's very queer, you just look at it, see from this angle,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.510
standing on the hilltop, just look at these mad people,

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.720
see how lunatic they are, stupid they are,

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.660
how they are behaving, what is their fashion.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:08.610
If you see the olden times, people used to dress up well

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.530
with all kinds of frills, all kinds of things,

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:15.740
but this is what they don’t like.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:22.690
Whatever God has given us should be decorated and respected.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.730
I mean yesterday, the way you did the hall,

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.730
I mean today the way you did the whole of the hall and

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.710
all that, so very beautiful it look, so nice it look.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.650
But somebody would say, “Oh, let us have

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:40.720
an absolutely plain thing for Mother.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:45.640
Some dilapidated wall behind which is about to fall down.

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.690
"That would be real character.”

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.500
How can these ideas be acceptable to Sahaja Yogis!

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.560
This I just don’t understand.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.650
And they pay for it.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.590
They pay for these conventions and they pay for all

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.700
these kind of odd things, they do pay for it.

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:11.690
Supposing there is a fashion today to have your haircut

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.550
like this on top, they will pay for it.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.730
Then you cut them another way, they pay for it.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.580
You have to pay for all these misdoings also.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.680
The fashion is: supposing somebody invite somebody

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.670
to your house, you must have a different type of a glass,

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.570
cup and a glass for this, otherwise you are not all right.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:39.570
And then what find?

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:42.610
There’s another group of these hippies and those have come.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:44.540
They’ll give you the dirtiest possible mugs

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.600
that you cannot drink anything.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:52.540
So either you accept this nonsense or that nonsense.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.640
It’s absolutely absurd.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.510
And you know I have seen Indians when they are in England,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.690
they just don’t understand, they just cancel them all right,

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:07.570
cancel them. They are mad people.

00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:18.600
The quality of personality is very, very low, very low.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:24.530
Take it from Me, very low. You might have ego,

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:29.510
might exist with that ego, but it is very low here.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:37.520
Accept it. Innocence is missing, auspiciousness is missing,

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:38.720
cleanliness is missing.

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:48.580
The attraction of simplicity is missing, so artificial.

00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.620
Even the ideas of simplicity is artificial.

00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.680
With artificiality how can you have a quality of human life?

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:05.640
How can you? You become artificial people.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:09.620
So give up all these conventions.

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:14.590
I am not here to propagate Indian culture as such,

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.610
but I must say if there is any culture it is in India,

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:21.670
because this is no culture. All becoming.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.570
If you walk about, I mean you look like when I see

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:31.570
the people around, they look like host of mad people walking.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.590
You see them on the streets, not one person is normal.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:36.730
America is even worse.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.740
They must do like this, or this like this.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.680
Not one person has a proper face.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:51.550
It’s a fact I tell you.

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.560
With Sahaja Yoga, your quality has come up, it has come up,

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:02.640
you’ve become that now, so great.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.600
That’s why you do not feel here there is Lakshmi.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.560
They have money but no Lakshmi.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.630
There’s no beauty of that.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:23.680
It’s so desolate, like a barren land.

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:32.590
Your ego has blown off everything that was beautiful.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.580
You could not tolerate anybody’s art,

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:40.730
so you would not have any artistic things in the house.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.710
You need not have many things at all, so you have plastics.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:52.660
Beauty has run away from your lives.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.560
When you talk also it’s fashionable to be arrogant.

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:02.660
Imagine: to be arrogant, to be very dry,

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:12.710
there’s no beauty in it. It’s all put up show;

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:21.630
there’s no bravery in it, nothing sublime.

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.520
On the subtle form you have lost it;

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.600
that’s why on the gross form you don’t see it.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:35.540
Whatever you have lost inside, it's shown outside -

00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:39.520
bankruptcy, complete bankruptcy.

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:42.740
So when you see that with others, when I am saying you,

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.570
I am meaning in the others, those who are not yet

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.520
Sahaja yogis in the West.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.500
Try to understand that they are at a much lower level

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:53.570
than you are, and don’t take to their ideas,

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.620
and their ways and methods.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.640
Just keep yourself alert.

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.680
And then you’ll see they’ll run after you.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.700
Ego is like a donkey.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.560
If somebody is ahead of them, they know somebody is ahead

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.570
of them, then they bend their head to that.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:14.530
And if they see somebody is behind them, then they kick.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.580
So you have your dignity, you have your special style,

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.690
you live with a special style.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:29.730
Don’t be one of them. Dress up properly, in a proper way.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:34.560
You may have only two shirts; you may have only three shirts;

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:40.680
you need not have many, but have something sensible,

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:51.560
normal, comfortable and also which is not charring to others.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.530
We are the ones who are going to encourage our art,

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.650
we are the ones who are going to bring back all

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.580
that is lost.

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.640
We can’t have Rembrandt anymore; we cannot have

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:09.520
Leonardo da Vinci; we cannot have Michelangelo again.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.500
Finished them all completely.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:14.570
Here everyone thinks that they are Michelangelo.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:22.660
We can’t even have, say, Gorky;

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:33.560
we can’t have William Blake, can we? Of that courage?

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:39.610
We cannot have Abraham Lincoln, can we have?

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:47.560
All dwarfs, useless people.

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:48.640
You scratch them and you find

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:50.690
they are good for nothing, useless.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:55.740
Out of you only all these great people have to come out now.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.640
And their specialty about them,

00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.740
they had their own personality.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.650
They would not give way to any fashions or anything.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.620
They wouldn’t give way to any cheap popularity.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:13.740
Out of you people all these great personalities

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.740
are to be born.

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:21.710
So for you and for your progeny you have to think,

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.520
"What are we doing?” in such a great work as it is,

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:28.540
it’s not only for your enjoyment that we have a seminar,

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:33.590
nice music, nice food, nice place, we come and enjoy, no!

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:39.630
Enjoyment is just an advertising department.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:54.630
You have to really work hard inside, not outside.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:01.670
No arguments of any kind. Useless,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:09.670
simple thing if I say I have to carry, say, this box,

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:11.660
somebody will come out and say,

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.730
“All right, then I think we should get a van.”

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.530
“No, but van is too much.” “Then what should we do?”

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:20.560
They’ll go on arguing till that the box is gone,

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:22.540
everything is done and I come back and I say,

00:41:22.630 --> 00:41:23.570
“Now, what are you doing?”

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:25.730
“We are discussing “We are discussing how to take the box."

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.720
It’s already gone.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:35.500
Such wasteful habits we should give up.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.570
We have to have new wisdom within us.

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.550
All this old wisdom, you just throw it away.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.730
Unless and until you don’t do that, your ego won’t go away.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.500
It won’t leave unless and until you decide to throw away

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:03.520
all those ideas which to you appear to be there.

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.590
You have to be like children.

00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.710
Try to learn something new all the time;

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:14.700
we are to be open to learn something new all the time.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:16.530
You have to learn.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:17.680
You have lost it.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.680
You had something that you have lost it so many.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.650
Instead of going ahead, you have lost it.

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:26.570
You would have been all right if you had remained

00:42:26.650 --> 00:42:30.570
on the right path, you would have achieved because,

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:34.580
after all, some countries are traditionally very old.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.720
They also got lost - like Greece, you can say, is lost.

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:43.700
Horrible Greek tragedies, I mean, sit down and cry

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:44.740
for nothing at all.

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:46.690
Nothing has happened, everything is perfect,

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.580
people just go and sit down and cry.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.660
It’s like you make somebody say that “This one is dead.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.550
Let us now feel that he is dead.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:43:01.680
Sit down, all of us should cry.”  Stupid as that.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.600
It's all artificially-created problems and

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.740
artificially-created gloom because you have no real gloom;

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:10.630
you have no real problem;

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.580
they’ve got food to eat; got everything,

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.670
that’s why you are creating problems for yourself.

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:20.680
That’s why you need psychiatrist, you need drugs,

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.530
you need this, you need that. Because you have no problems,

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.500
you want to have some problems, as simple as that.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.540
Those who have problems have to fight with it.

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:34.590
They have no time for all these nonsensical things.

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:35.710
You have too much time.

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:37.720
All your problems are solved, as far as the material things

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:42.570
are concerned, but still you are very much involved into it.

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:47.740
So now face it, face it clearly,

00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.520
that we are not that anymore.

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:55.590
We are different people.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:44:00.600
We are no more worms in the mud but we are lotuses,

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.710
we have fragrance, we have powers,

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:10.730
we are specially blessed. We have a special sense of joy;

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:15.710
let’s enjoy that and give it to others and

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:23.550
and be glorified with it, feel the dignity of it.

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:30.600
I am sure that it is going to work out this time,

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:33.690
that I have done My level best, I think,

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.540
and this lecture should really go through you all.

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:43.600
All right, any questions?

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.620
Can I have some water?

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:49.600
Any questions you have?

00:44:56.730 --> 00:45:00.520
They might be think I'll drink from here.

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.620
Modern idea that may be I'll drink from here.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:07.730
There's no need to have glass

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.510
Mother may like to drink from there.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:21.660
All right, any questions?

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:42.720
In thoughtless awareness.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.570
Now keep it up, keep it up in thoughtless awareness,

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:54.520
absolutely you're blasted, keep it up. Keep yourself blasted.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:55.730
That is this ego business.

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.500
Little bit still there rudimentary, keep it out.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:06.600
This is meditation. Where there's no ego any more.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.630
You are in thoughtless awareness, absolutely stuanned.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.540
Can't think.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.700
But I have done, is not good. You should do it.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:23.560
That is the point I am coming to again.

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:26.710
Have your own personality.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:29.510
If punks could behave like that,

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:32.660
why can’t you behave sensibly?

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:58.670
And also I have to say few words about how we behave

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:03.660
in our day-to-day live because the Mother has to see that

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.550
they are, children are not to be ill-bred.

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.700
People should not say that SahajaYogis are ill bred.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:17.570
First sign of an ill-bred child is that he leaves his bed

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:25.530
in a mess. He leaves all his things in a mess.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:29.540
While coming I saw all the beds.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.570
What are we doing here? Nothing.

00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:41.540
So put yourself into a discipline of leading a neat life.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.660
As a Mother I have to tell you this.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:48.610
It takes hardly ten to fifteen minutes,

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:50.640
but just tell yourself, "This is meditation",

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:52.740
do in meditative way.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.680
We in India think that the Western people

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:58.520
are extremely neat and tidy.

00:48:00.730 --> 00:48:02.730
Really, they can’t believe it.

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:04.590
They think you are in top of the world.

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:07.600
You must be the neatest people ever lived.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:11.540
They said ten times “thank you.”

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:16.510
But even once you will not keep your bed all right.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.560
Your things should be neat.

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:26.510
You must keep yourself neat, appear neat.

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:31.510
Then second thing I've seen, noticed this

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:34.530
which is told by many people which I have also noticed

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.600
that you go to somebody’s house,

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.700
then an ill-bred person will start using the phone

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.690
without asking.

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:47.530
Certain things are important to understand.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:50.630
Like entering into the kitchen eating everything.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:54.690
It’s a very common thing people are noticing this,

00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:00.590
that you get the food like paupers, like beggars

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.660
they come in the house.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:08.670
At least twenty-one bottles of honey

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:11.600
which people had given Me as present,

00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:14.700
when My son-in-law came there was not even

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:18.500
one bottle to give him honey.

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:19.690
So who ate?

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.740
All the Sahaja yogis who came and ate the honey.

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:28.530
I mean, it’s all right but you must ask.

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:31.570
You polish off everything in the house.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:34.670
All right, you have come, there is food cooked for you,

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.540
just have your food.

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:46.530
If you go in the larder or you go anywhere to find,

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.710
everything is missing.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:53.620
You buy from the whole mart you find everything polished off.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:00.510
So an ill-bred person can be made out like that.

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:04.520
But you will be surprised, a good breeding person,

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:08.670
even if this much is left of another person,

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:10.640
that person will keep it and keep it,

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:13.700
till it is passed over.

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.550
I’ll tell you about My own husband who is,

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:18.710
who need not worry about this but if he knows

00:50:19.570 --> 00:50:21.520
we have something of another person,

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:24.640
he’ll  put it lock and key and see every time it is there

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.670
till he returns it to him.

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:37.520
And same I can say about My children or

00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:42.570
anybody I know of, but this is beggarish

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:44.690
that you take somebody’s things, miss use it,

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.620
throw away where you feel like and break everything.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:52.600
But I've seen with My own things,

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:55.600
when the leaders have been complaining to Me that

00:50:55.730 --> 00:50:58.640
come to our houses, they polish off everything

00:50:58.730 --> 00:51:02.510
from our fridges and all that, I was not surprised.

00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:07.520
The Sahaja Yoga has become like a resort

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:10.690
for the all the beggars and the paupers of the world

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:13.600
because it is free.

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:17.580
All the poor people come down to Sahaja Yoga and

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.600
you have to nourish them and look after them.

00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.600
It should not be such.

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:27.660
You may be poor but you must have dignity.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.540
Even the servants are in India are better.

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:38.570
They wouldn’t touch your things without asking.

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:42.570
They have much more breeding.

00:51:48.690 --> 00:51:52.570
And ill-bred person is a person who is a rude person,

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.650
arrogant person.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.630
You can say the same thing in a proper manner.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:01.510
As a Mother to give Me a real glory is that,

00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:03.630
that people should say that

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.510
you are very well brought up children.

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:25.610
A kind of system must exist.

00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:29.520
A spartan system, it's a spartans system.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.710
It is not all a sort of a lousy system.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.610
It's a spartan system.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:41.710
We are yogis, should be neat, tidy, all the time clean

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:44.530
with few things.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:47.740
Like in India, people are quite shocked.

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:53.500
You carry such big, big bags and it carries all the,

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:56.600
for ladies, specially all the paints and this and that.

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:59.550
Where are you going to use before the villagers there

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.520
these paints, they don’t understand.

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:09.540
All these things we have to see for ourselves.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.650
We have to be dignified.

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:20.700
We have to be people with a kind of a personality.

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.560
Supposing somebody is a saint.

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.680
He might be a poor man

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:30.640
but you can make him out by his dignity.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.710
There was a saint called Tukhaarama

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:36.570
whom which you have heard about him this

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.610
"Amhi Bi Ghadalo" comes from his music.

00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.660
He was poor and very generous also.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.710
He used to give away everything and he always left

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.690
with very little.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:57.560
So Shivaji Maharaj, the great Shivaji came down to his place,

00:53:58.690 --> 00:54:02.510
brought  lots of ornaments and things and presentations

00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:05.630
and gave it to his wife and children. He was out.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:08.680
She was very happy to wear all these things because he gave.

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:12.520
Of course in the beginning she also said,

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:13.650
“That is  not all right.” But he said,

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:16.680
“No I am only trying to sort of pay my respect to you -

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:20.590
this, that - and give. And she wore it.

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:24.540
He came and he said, “No, I am a saint.

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:31.620
You take these. You are a king; you have to live like a king.

00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:35.520
All right as a king, you can have it.

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:41.630
But not as a saint. I don’t need all these.

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.600
My wife doesn’t need all these things.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:45.660
Because you are living like a king,

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.660
maybe you are realized soul also but you are a king,

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.500
so live like a king.”

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:02.560
But one has to realize that in Sahaja Yoga you are not

00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:05.550
to move like a barren personality also.

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:09.580
You have to be properly dressed, properly appearing.

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.560
You should not look like beggars,

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:16.730
but you should look like dignified people of the society.

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:22.550
Now for example, as you know I am the Goddess,

00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:26.520
and the Goddess has to wear, I don't know how many ornaments

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:30.560
just to adorn Her chakras.

00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:34.500
I mean I have lots of ornaments Myself of My own.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.520
But only for puja I wear otherwise I don’t wear.

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:41.640
I am supposed to wear lots of things.

00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:47.700
Why? Because it may not be that all right,

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.620
may be dignified but may not be that all right to wear

00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:54.590
all those things all the time.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.700
But I am supposed to wear.

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.530
Like I am supposed to wear many more things on the hands

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:04.590
here, rings on the feet, everything all the time you have

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:11.500
wear gold in the, what do you call the, you don’t have that

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:15.690
ornament here which we tie up like a belt.

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.640
But I don’t do it.

00:56:21.550 --> 00:56:24.600
I keep it to a marginal point

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:28.580
only in puja I wear some things out of it.

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:33.610
So you must have that discretion what to wear,

00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:38.590
how to wear, how far to go, how to look dignified,

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:41.590
how to be well bred so that you glorify

00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.550
the breeding of your Mother.

00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.520
This time I hope when you all come to India

00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:58.720
you'll notice all these things among Indians.

00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.500
You will never see them eating;

00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.580
you never see them having their baths;

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.560
you never see them sleeping.

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:10.720
You don’t know how they live, where they live,

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.630
how they work out,

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.530
everything they are just there on the spot

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.640
whenever you are there.

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:20.580
Isn’t it true?

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:23.530
They take their baths, they finish everything early

00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:24.710
in the morning about 4 o’clock or 5 o’clock.

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:31.740
They are out, spartan and always clean whether a villager,

00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:37.690
whether he is a Shedule caste or Brahmin or anything.

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:42.720
They all neatly dressed; you cannot make them out.

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:45.620
Clean, white clothes they'll wear.

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:49.600
Clean white cap they will have.

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.600
They never have dirty clothes.

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:05.580
So this is another side, which is not so sublime,

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:11.500
gross side and not so subtle but is very important

00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:16.630
because whatever is in the subtle expresses outside.

00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:26.740
In all your behavior this will shine,

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:33.670
like thousands facets of a diamond because

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:38.500
you have attended now the Sahasrara Day.  Let’s see.

00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:43.570
What you have thousand facets we show.

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:50.550
Love each other; respect each other;

00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:55.710
respect yourself and all the time say one mantra

00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:00.550
within yourself “I am a Sahaja Yogi.”

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:04.580
It says everything about your responsibilities,

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:10.660
what are your aspirations, what you are.

00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:19.650
You are a Sahaja Yogi. Being reborn by Adi Shakti Herself.

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:31.620
Any personal problems you have you should write to Me and

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:33.510
I’ll try to answer.

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:37.520
If I do not answer, then think that answer I've managed.

00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:40.570
If I do not answer then think that I've managed to answer,

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:42.570
but if there is anything to be suggested

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:45.590
I will definitely inform you.

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:48.540
Any other problem.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.590
But like a lady today came,

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:52.720
she was crying about her husband.

00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:54.660
She did before also again today she is crying.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:56.640
She'll go mad.

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.740
A Sahaja Yogi should not cry.

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:02.710
Overcome your problems;

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:06.560
try to handle your husband; try to handle everything.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.520
I do not like very much the divorce part of it,

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:11.550
but if somebody is a gone case is all right.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:13.560
I would say is a gone case, you divorce.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:19.670
But unnecessarily, just because it's not yet a proper

01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:22.610
understanding one should not cry, weep

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:24.520
and do all these things.

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:27.610
On the contrary one should try to overcome

01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:31.610
your own personal problems because you have powers.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.680
And You can write to Me, not very long letters.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.710
I get lost.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.620
Yes, really I get lost.

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:04.570
In the morning there are so many letters for Me to read,

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:06.670
one better than the other,

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.690
and My husband also get a big post.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.620
But he says, “Nobody writes me love letters,

01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:17.570
they all write about their bills to be paid.”

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:23.520
I said, “It’s just the same.”

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:41.560
You may translate this Gregoire.

01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:55.720
Full of problems.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:25.730
I said that, “I have to pay for their love.”

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:30.660
That's what it is.

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:37.710
But children write very sweet letters.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:40.620
They just made some painting or something,

01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:44.570
or some flowers and few things there, that’s all.

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:48.590
They'll make a heart and put Me there or something like that.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:54.590
Very sweet, sweet things they do and just the joy

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:58.740
and the happiness you see they express.

01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:00.710
Never they've no problems. They have no problems.

01:03:01.530 --> 01:03:03.600
Children don’t have problems. They are not complicated.

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:05.680
You catch hold of the problems, that's the trouble is.

01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:08.640
They have no problems of any kind.

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:15.630
So you have not told me, anyone of you,

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.720
anything that you want to be done.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.610
Now only thing at the last I would like you

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:23.510
you to listen to Warren who will read it out

01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:26.580
to you the programs, we are going to have

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.660
in this summer time.

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:20.610
After sometime it may happened that

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:23.570
I settle down in one place and you all have to come there,

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:25.590
because I wouldn’t be able to travel so much,

01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:30.560
I can tell you this much ... All right. For the time being.

01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:33.570
You must also understand that now

01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:35.500
the Mohamad has gone to the mountains

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:39.530
now the mountains have to come to Mohamed.

01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:43.520
All right. So thank you very much.

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:45.590
You haven't told Me any of your problems

01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:48.700
So, I think, there are no problems?

01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:14.730
Tomorrow morning I may not be able to meet you.

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:19.610
So may God bless you all.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.650
Give yourself a bandhan now, all of you.

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:29.620
Properly, with full attention, with full dignity,

01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:30.740
with full movement.

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:33.640
See, full.

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.690
Nothing should be done cheaply.

01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:11.580
I don't need anything but lets doing it with yours...

01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:38.540
In India they asked the question that,

01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.680
"If She is the Goddess

01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:42.640
why does She say "Namaskar" to everyone?"

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.540
They can't understand the Goddess saying, "namaskar".
