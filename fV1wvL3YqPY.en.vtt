00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:29.480
I

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:46.610
have to
tell

00:00:46.610 --> 00:01:34.539
you thank you very much for this celebration,
for all these beautiful balloons; but, looking

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:51.719
at these balloons, we have to
also see some of them who have lost their

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:53.600
air completely.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.890
This is another problem we face in the West
because to have ego itself, according to the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.640
Western culture, is a very great achievement.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:14.300
And when we start living with our ego I know
how one looks like.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.310
He really looks like a stupid fellow.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.440
When he talks, when he describes himself,
you don't know where to look because just

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.220
feel like laughing at his stupidity.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.500
Ego is the outcome of stupidity.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:48.280
I don't know what to say; how to give a simile
to ego, because it's just bloated and makes

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.971
you float in the air, and when it bursts you
are down on the earth.

00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:02.520
But you are not down on the earth the way
Sahaja Yogis should be down to earth; but

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.840
you are completely finished.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.920
All your arrogance goes to waste.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.950
You can never understand Sahaja Yoga if you
have this ego in your head.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.210
I have known people who have this ego.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.250
They have come to Sahaja Yoga and still they
want to think that they know more than anybody

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.320
else.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:37.180
To know about yourself you have to go deep
down, and to go deep down you have to give

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.140
up all this idea which makes you float in
the air.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.950
Imagine if you have a big balloon attached
to you.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.940
How can you go deep down into the sea?

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.540
You cannot.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:07.950
That kind of a air which makes you float in
the air, absolutely in an area of stupidity,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.180
what else -I mean English you will think there
are no words- stupidity means everything.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.880
Then you may think no end of yourself.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.370
You may think whatever you like, you can behave
the way you like and all that but what do

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.130
you achieve?

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.420
You achieve nothing out of it.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.639
Whatever you achieve people are jealous of
you.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.640
They want to harm you.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.690
You have no friends.

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.979
Nobody cares for you, and in Sahaja Yoga people
know who has got this problem.

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:55.449
So, I've seen people when they start talking
they say, “Ah!

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.969
We know, we know him.”

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:05.400
Once I had an experience, long, long time
back in Pune where the people who were owning

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:14.419
that wada said that we cannot have Shri Mataji's
program because She is not a Brahmin.

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.770
So the Sahaja Yogis said, all right we'll
give it in the newspaper because She is not

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.880
a Brahmin we cannot have a program.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:31.009
So, these people came to My program and the
owner of that was sitting on the gallery on

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.009
top.

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.039
He couldn't even walk.

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.759
He was suffering from some sort of a funny
disease.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.160
So these people suddenly start.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160
I didn't know.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160
They didn't tell Me anything.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.039
They didn't tell Me that these people have
protested or whatever it is.

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:53.340
So they all started shaking like this, like
this, like this.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.199
I said, “What is this?”

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.490
So I said, “What is it?”

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.990
They said “Mother, stop it.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.430
We know You are Shakti but stop it.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.110
It's too much, too much.”

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.789
“But what did you do?”

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.800
They said, “We didn't do anything.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.800
We just said this is a Brahmin's thing and
a Brahmin's wada, and this area is mostly

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:24.439
resided by Brahmins, so we thought that You
cannot have your program.”

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:26.720
I said, “Really, that's all ?”

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.250
“Yes, yes, that's all.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.560
But it's, you see on the other side, you see
those people?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.160
They are also shaking with Your power.”

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.210
So I asked them, “Who are you?

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.439
Are you also Brahmins ?”

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:41.680
They said, "No, no.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.879
We are certified mad people from Thana.”

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:48.720
“And how are you here?”

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.400
They said, “There was one fellow who was
mad was cured by You.”

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.400
“Really?”

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.370
“So our superintendent is here.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:59.680
He has brought us here.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.330
We are certified mad.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.330
Certified.”

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.779
My goodness, these people looked at Me.

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:08.860
I said, “See now, you tally.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.860
You are shaking and they are shaking.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.080
Now you tally.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.910
Where are you?”

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.910
And they all became Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:25.259
Not only that but the gentleman sitting upstairs
I told him, "You get up and come down."

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:27.710
He came
and since that day he has surrendered his

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.120
life and did a lot of work in Pune.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:37.970
So what I'm saying that anybody who talks
like that; that “This is wrong, in Sahaja

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:44.979
Yoga, this should not happen, we should not
have paid so much, or this leader is not good”;

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:53.830
should take a paper, thin paper, on his hand,
and put it before the photograph.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.699
If you can stop the shaking then you are all
right.

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:07.210
All of you can try this.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:08.210
Then try on the right hand.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.210
Very practical.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:18.350
If the paper is shaking that means Mr. Ego
is shaking, and you know how to treat your

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.780
ego in Sahaja Yoga, thanks to Mohammed Sahib.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:26.849
He has told us how to treat it.

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:30.599
Now these two problems are within us.

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:38.909
One of them is our conditioning and another
is this ego business, and we make our mind

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:46.279
out of that and we are playing under the governance
of these two things which we have used to

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:48.750
make this mind.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.990
Now you have to be careful.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.139
You find out with left hand.

00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:53.139
Now let's see.

00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:56.610
If the left hand is shaking then you are conditioned.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.600
If the right hand is shaking then you are
egoistical.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.410
So now you treat it.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.660
You treat these two things.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.790
Before Me you'll get vibrations all right
because you see I am your Mother.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.950
All right.

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:13.880
But that doesn't mean you are all right.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.850
You try on My photograph; that's much more
sharp.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.890
So being Mother you know I play around.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:27.060
I think, I don't know what I should say, but
maybe you may not feel that way.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:33.149
But before the photograph you put on the left
hand side a newspaper or a little paper or

00:09:33.149 --> 00:09:34.259
a thin paper.

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:37.120
On the right hand side another paper.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.130
One by one you try and judge yourself, what
are you?

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:48.670
After all you have not come here in Sahaja
Yoga to emancipate Me.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:55.910
You have come here to evolve yourself and
because of that you have to face yourself

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:03.730
and see for yourself what is within you which
is very strong, which is troublesome, which

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.470
is dragging you down, which is killing.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:16.050
Sahaja Yoga is nothing but Ocean of Joy.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:23.509
I thought that in My absence you'll be all
enjoying it all right; you do.

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:29.690
Airport I have seen sometimes I am late because
of the plane, about four hours, five hours,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.769
and everybody is so fresh, and so nice early
in the morning.

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:34.769
I said, “What's happened ?”

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:37.759
“The whole night we have been enjoying Mother.”

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:44.569
So what you enjoy in that is collectivity:
Sangat That collectivity you should enjoy

00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:51.260
only by getting rid of your nonsensical boundaries
that you have built, and then you see the

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.260
joy.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:59.949
All the time you'll be floating in joy.

00:10:59.949 --> 00:11:06.860
There is a sense which people have which you
may not have before realization.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:14.440
Some of the people, I was amazed how deep
they are, how they took to Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.440
Supposed to be very great men.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:25.000
Supposed to be people of very great principles
but very hot-tempered, intolerant about people,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:34.050
and they take to Sahaja Yoga just like this
because inside there's a big depth, so that

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.319
everything is absorbed without any problem.

00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:44.819
Everybody can achieve but one has to be careful
as to the two wheels of our mind.

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:50.270
One is the ego, another is the conditioning.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.930
All kinds of conditionings are there, especially
in India.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:57.759
In the West it is all kinds of egos you know,
different, different types.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:06.254
I have seen so many types and varieties of
egos, I was surprised; to face that.

00:12:06.254 --> 00:12:07.959
I didn't know what to say.

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:15.339
It's a very, very subtle thing which people
have carved out of their minds.

00:12:15.339 --> 00:12:24.200
So for you today it is to be decided that
you are only still small children, and like

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:35.819
small children you must have a very clean
heart to accept, to absorb the beauty of peace

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:42.930
that is within you; and also the beauty of
purity.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:46.360
Without purity you cannot enjoy anything.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:57.399
So in Sahaja Yoga though we have so many people
I must say the purity of these few saints,

00:12:57.399 --> 00:13:04.420
who lived earlier, we have to yet achieve.

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.480
For example, yesterday they were singing about
Ali.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.930
I was so very happy because He was an Incarnation.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.670
And His purity people are singing now; not
at that time.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.410
He was killed at that time, He was tortured.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.260
That always they do.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.740
Then we have many others.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.820
We have here Dam Dam Sahib.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.620
See what a great thing to come to.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:33.140
We have here Nizamuddin Auliya.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:40.930
We have so many people in our country itself
that nobody, no other country can claim.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:45.660
They have one, say in England they have William
Blake or this and that.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.839
We had so many people.

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:48.839
Why?

00:13:48.839 --> 00:13:56.379
Not because we were very good people, but
because we were to be improved.

00:13:56.379 --> 00:13:59.199
Things had to be done.

00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:00.199
So they were born.

00:14:00.199 --> 00:14:08.459
Though this is a Yoga Bhoomi anywhere you
go in India, I was surprised, in Haryana so

00:14:08.459 --> 00:14:14.620
many great saints lived there.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.910
But they were all tortured, troubled, never
understood.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:27.029
It was so painful and hurts you how this stupid,
ignorant, blind people tortured them.

00:14:27.029 --> 00:14:34.480
So now it is our duty of Sahaja Yogis to,
first of all, find out who is a saint.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.040
Even among Sahaja Yogis, as I described in
Hindi language, there are people who try to

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.790
trouble, trouble others.

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:54.120
If you have no recognition and understanding
of what is the truth, what is love, what is

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:58.209
pure compassion, then you are not a Sahaja
Yogi.

00:14:58.209 --> 00:15:03.120
It's like an obtuse angle you see, you have.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:10.870
You look at a person with an obtuse angle
you don't see anything, one-sided.

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:20.470
Now, at this juncture when I am so very old
now; I have to request that you turn your

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.940
eyes to yourself.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:23.940
Introspect.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:31.230
Because among you there are some people who
will try to divert your attention, will try

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.889
to say things.

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:38.360
Very easy to say, “He is very dishonest,
he is very immoral”; very easy to say.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.990
What are you?

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:50.970
We have to now understand that Sahaja Yoga
is to be consolidated through synthesis.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.480
We are believers of synthesis.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:58.089
Any divisive thing that comes into your mind
you should just throw it away.

00:15:58.089 --> 00:16:04.460
This is a request on this day I make you - that
you please introspect.

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:09.140
Unless and until you introspect you cannot
even respect yourself.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.690
You cannot even love yourself.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:15.779
If you love yourself you will introspect and
find out what's wrong.

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:25.240
Supposing I love this sari, then if I find
any doubt about it or see any dot somewhere

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.769
or something I'll get it cleaned.

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:32.319
I'll not be proud of it, wear it and go round
saying, “Ah!

00:16:32.319 --> 00:16:36.249
See I've got so many spots.”

00:16:36.249 --> 00:16:46.540
In the same way, you should be not proud of
whatever asahaj temperaments you have within

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:47.610
yourself.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.899
And don't talk like that.

00:16:49.899 --> 00:16:52.949
Christ has called them 'murmuring souls'.

00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:57.660
He said, “Beware of the murmuring souls”.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.360
I would say: "Throw away all the murmuring
souls".

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.920
That's the only way.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:10.780
In Hindi as they say 'bakwas’; their name
is bakwas; means the ones who just chatter,

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.480
chatter, chatter; talk all nonsense about
others.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.079
He doesn't know what he is.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:24.699
It is much more in India, I must confess.

00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:27.789
I'm sorry, though I'm an Indian.

00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:32.960
It is a habit of talking ill of others, sitting
down just chit-chatting.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.429
They will not talk of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:40.450
How many people know Sahaja Yoga in the proper
way?

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.980
I mean if I have to give degrees, what degrees
I should give to you?

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.080
Tell Me.

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.020
You don't know even about your vibrations.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:56.940
Of course you are Sahaja Yogis because you
have fallen into this trap of achieving evolution.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:01.419
But how many are really grown up into it?

00:18:01.419 --> 00:18:02.610
You can.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:08.870
So I have to again and again tell you, to
make Me happy, you have to give up all these

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:17.740
nonsensical, cheapish talks; but try to understand
from each other what we know of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:30.130
Discuss it and contribute to this knowledge
by describing your experiences of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:31.570
There are many who do it.

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.429
I am not saying they don't do.

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:39.360
But even there's one bad fellow he can spoil
all of them; like one bad apple can spoil

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.820
all the apples.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.370
So what do we do -throw away the apple out
of the basket.

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:58.580
It is important see, even I feel all this,
standing like a witness to you, silent witness.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:12.950
When I see big, big mountains, and I think
they are like great saints who are watching,

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:22.500
and they are trying to record what is happening
in this world because they also understand.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.710
They also know.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:34.890
I have to again, and again, tell you that
today is the day to see your own self, your

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:40.070
own chakras, your own - I should say - defects.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:48.440
That will give you permanently the joy that
is promised.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.830
You will get thoughtless awareness.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.220
Also you'll get doubtless awareness.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:05.020
But never get into the trap of your conditioning
and of your ego.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:11.549
This is what I have to tell you today, on
this day where you are celebrating, that you

00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:13.710
celebrate your own birthday.

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.570
Celebrate it.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:20.600
See for yourself what you have achieved and
what you are going to achieve.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.279
It's time for you to celebrate than to celebrate
My birthday.

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:24.900
I'll be very happy to celebrate your birthday
than to celebrate Mine.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.900
So may God bless you.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.900
Today, I was thinking, that we had given a
nice chance to children to come up.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.900
But all the leaders are also My children.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:28.900
So they should come here on the stage and
can say Atharva Sheersha.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.900
Not the children which are really children,
in the real sense of the word, but those who

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:30.900
have become child-like.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.900
All such people should come up and say Arthava
Sheersha, We all should say Atharva Sheersha.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:32.900
It’s going to be a very small puja because
you are worshipping Me as I am.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:32.904
It’s not like anything.
