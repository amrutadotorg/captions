00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
There were other people,

2
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.040
I need to get that off now,

3
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.200
there were other people who have lived in

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.960
Church and Road before us.

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.800
Actually, Grezna last time explained that

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.760
her wedding was there, and there was

7
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.960
Linda Williams who lived there with her

8
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.200
little son at the time when we visited

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.040
from Switzerland,

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.800
much long before we actually

11
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.680
started to live in Church and Road.

12
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.880
And this was not planned at all actually,

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.560
it was one of this lila or shrimataji.

14
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.320
We were living in South London

15
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.560
and I was actually nine months pregnant

16
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.560
with my twins.

17
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.160
And we were about to buy a little house

18
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.000
in North London

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.800
and then it fell through when it just

20
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.320
didn't happen.

21
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.480
And people in in Sajja Yoga

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.160
were really desperate to to fill

23
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.120
the ashram of Church and Road because

24
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.080
Linda didn't get any rent and this house

25
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.200
actually

26
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.160
was not looked after.

27
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.560
And that was, as you know, it's a

28
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.880
milestone of Sajja Yoga

29
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.000
in England, but Shrimataji gave it

30
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.680
a lot of importance. She put the

31
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.280
foundation stone herself in the

32
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.480
garden at the entrance of the house.

33
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.600
So it was an important building.

34
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.040
However, the state of Church and Road

35
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.640
when we moved in was

36
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.080
less than comfortable. It was

37
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.160
actually, how can I describe it?

38
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.320
Well, I'll give you a little description.

39
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.440
The wallpaper was peeling off the walls

40
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.440
in many rooms.

41
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.040
The carpets were torn apart and under

42
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.920
the carpet

43
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.200
to kind of not have humidity. They had

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.680
put some old newspaper

45
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.200
and you can imagine as a Swiss woman

46
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.600
arriving there, I was horrified.

47
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.240
Although I knew it was an important place

48
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.720
and

49
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.920
I must say to be fair, the

50
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.760
meditation room was always magical

51
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.160
and it was a place out of the world, I

52
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.080
would say. It was like, it could have been

53
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.280
in India,

54
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.480
it could have been in Italy, anywhere.

55
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.360
It was a special place. The

56
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.040
meditation room was

57
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.640
very special. Actually, Shrimataji had

58
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.120
been there a lot of time

59
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.280
before. Of course,

60
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.840
it was smaller than it is now because

61
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.440
Chris Marlow has done

62
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.520
extensive reparation to this house, thank

63
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.040
God, actually.

64
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.800
So, yes, for me, I can,

65
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.840
I felt a bit, yes, I am part of the dusty

66
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.040
foundation

67
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.240
and I have to be kind of

68
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.680
holding the building and with me

69
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.880
was this lovely Janet, Janet

70
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.480
Dredier,

71
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.360
who is a nurse, actually. She's a matron

72
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.920
now,

73
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.640
actually, and we were holding the fort

74
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.520
together,

75
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.760
of course, with our families. Our

76
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.680
husbands were also living there,

77
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.960
but I must say that the ones who were

78
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.760
really

79
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.320
working hard in the ashram were the

80
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.600
ladies

81
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.880
and it was really Krita Yuga, I must say.

82
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.760
In two years time, where we stayed there,

83
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.880
there was not

84
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.080
one minute where we were not doing

85
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.800
something.

86
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.200
It was relentless, either

87
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.640
with the children

88
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.080
or with a puja. I will explain a bit more.

89
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.880
So,

90
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.000
yes, with the uncomfort, I need to

91
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.480
also say one or two things because I

92
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.240
think it was a little bit of a test for

93
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.360
me because I

94
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.480
came from a very comfortable country.

95
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.640
For instance,

96
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.000
one winter, there was actually the

97
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.480
babies were really babies still.

98
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.280
They were like

99
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.760
six or seven months old and

100
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.920
there was no heating

101
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.920
in the bathroom, anyway, so I had to

102
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.120
organize

103
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.520
a little bath in our bedroom for the

104
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.800
babies, you know, well,

105
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.040
the three of them because you

106
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.920
couldn't bath

107
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.480
babies in a cold bathroom in winter. That

108
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.160
was not possible.

109
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.360
So, but one winter after they were

110
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.480
born, which was,

111
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.520
you know, in 1989,

112
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.640
there has been a big freeze and

113
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.520
at that point, the heating completely

114
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.360
collapsed

115
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.520
and so we had icicle on the window, which

116
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.280
was not double glazed.

117
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.400
We had icicle and it was

118
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.960
really freezing cold. I was a bit scared

119
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.520
that

120
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.880
about hypothermia for the children

121
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.920
and I phoned Hesta and I said, Hesta, can

122
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.040
we have some help

123
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.680
because we have absolutely no heating, no

124
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.920
radiators, nothing.

125
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.960
And she actually pulled around a lot of

126
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.080
people,

127
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.080
but nobody from London came over

128
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.360
and it was amazing because Bogdan

129
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.240
Šekovic

130
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.360
at that time was at Shudekam and he

131
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.360
was working as a doctor there in

132
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.400
Cambridge

133
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.160
and he came after his work at 11 o'clock

134
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.200
at night

135
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.640
with two big gas heater

136
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.840
for us, you know, to kind of

137
00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.880
be able to survive

138
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.920
basically. So that was a story I do

139
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.720
remember.

140
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.400
It was just incredible, this story.

141
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.520
And then Pat, Greszna's husband, came, I

142
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.280
think, after two days to

143
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.240
properly repair this heating system

144
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.440
which was

145
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.000
really quite vétheust, you know, quite old.

146
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.400
So this is for the

147
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.040
kind of comfort of the place with

148
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.440
a whole, with our families, you know, we

149
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.520
were there with our little children.

150
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.240
So I think it was a tapasaya to

151
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.400
actually make things work

152
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.680
because there was no place

153
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.600
at that time where there would be

154
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.280
pujas or

155
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.160
meditation. I mean there might have been

156
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.120
a place

157
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.360
in Saint Martin's Lane where there

158
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.440
were meditation, etc.

159
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.520
But not a regular place like there is

160
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.000
now so many in England.

161
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.360
So we had

162
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.120
pujas every Sunday and we would cook a

163
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.440
soup for all the people who would come

164
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.200
to the pujas and we had bhajans

165
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.000
every Wednesday night and I was cooking

166
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.400
pasta for all the people who came,

167
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.680
which was around 30 people at least,

168
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.720
after I had put the babies to bed, so you

169
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.000
can imagine.

170
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.360
And Janet, bless her, was doing nights at

171
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.000
the time

172
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.760
on a Wednesday night, so I had also

173
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.240
put her little, I looked after her little

174
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.280
son as well

175
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.120
and she would come back in the morning.

176
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.840
So I was, you know, I was kind of in

177
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.480
charge of

178
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.640
of this bhajan session.

179
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.640
I let them do the washing up though, I

180
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.600
didn't do that.

181
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.040
So yes, it was just very, very,

182
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.480
very busy, very dynamic and

183
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.600
I think it was very good for

184
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.840
Saja Yuga Srimataji, he was very pleased

185
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.680
that we were there.

186
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.360
Sometimes it was quite challenging,

187
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.480
I must say,

188
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.840
and I told the story that I will

189
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.720
spell again because not many people were

190
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.400
there the last time.

191
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.600
I just tell the story where there was

192
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.680
little problems, I don't even remember

193
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.640
what it was in the ashram and Srimataji

194
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.240
called, she knows everything,

195
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.320
she called and she said, Antoinette, I would

196
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.760
like to see you.

197
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.560
So I said, oh my god, I haven't, I'm not

198
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.760
expecting that.

199
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.200
So I was really trying to look nice and

200
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.760
matching my tights to my skirt

201
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.600
and kind of running towards the tube

202
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.000
to get at Victoria.

203
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.040
They were living

204
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.720
at Victoria in an apartment at the time.

205
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.320
So I really hurried up there to arrive

206
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.280
at the time which was required to

207
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.560
come.

208
00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.000
And a servant opened the door and

209
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.160
there I was introduced in the living

210
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.760
room of Srimataji

211
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:06.240
and I sat on the floor like I always

212
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.960
did. I used to love sitting at her feet

213
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.360
and she arrived in the room, I bowed down

214
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.720
to her

215
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.400
and I felt really so thirsty because I

216
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.080
had really run to be there.

217
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.440
And so the servant brought some tea

218
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.480
and the cup was there full of tea and

219
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.040
said, oh my goodness, I would love to drink

220
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.800
this tea now.

221
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.440
And of course I didn't

222
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.280
say anything and I was waiting for

223
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.440
Srimataji to have her tea.

224
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.360
And she read in my thoughts and she said,

225
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.360
have it, have your tea, you know. And I

226
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.680
said, thank you, Srimataji.

227
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.880
My throat was dry because I was

228
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.080
so thirsty.

229
00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.960
So I had my cup of tea and then she

230
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.120
smiled at me and she said, Antoinette, you

231
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.320
don't need to

232
00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.440
match your tights to your skirt.

233
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.000
And we laughed together, we really laughed

234
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.160
because I knew she knew everything and

235
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.600
she was going to

236
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.240
to sort out everything. And she did, she

237
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.480
said this beautiful sentence that I

238
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.120
remember

239
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.000
always and I think I said it to many

240
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.400
people because it's so helpful to know.

241
00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.520
She said,

242
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.400
when there is a problem somewhere or a

243
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.720
difficult situation,

244
00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.760
I let it develop and grow

245
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.120
until it reaches a climax

246
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.400
and like the wave of the ocean,

247
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.440
I come down, crash on the floor onto the

248
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.240
shore.

249
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:40.400
I come forcefully with my vibrations.

250
00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.040
So I have always this image which is so

251
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.560
beautiful of

252
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:48.240
this kind of big wave that is there

253
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.120
and with Srimataji's attention kind of

254
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.600
when there is a difficult situation

255
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.440
and she comes forcefully with her

256
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.120
vibrations.

257
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.760
And for me, I kept that, you know,

258
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.080
throughout the whole time in Churcham

259
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.800
Road and

260
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.840
also afterwards in my life. I mean I had

261
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.240
so

262
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.760
many different instances also.

263
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.160
Also Srimataji reading our thoughts, I

264
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.760
mean I don't want to

265
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.120
to go too much outside Churcham Road but

266
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.600
I had several instances where she

267
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.480
was reading my thoughts.

268
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.800
Just a small example in Switzerland, I

269
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.800
was driving her in a car to a

270
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.160
program

271
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.120
and there were people

272
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.080
who were, there were bells ringing in the

273
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.560
church

274
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.120
and the people getting into the church

275
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.120
and I thought into in myself, I said oh

276
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.560
that's really funny.

277
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.120
They all go to church because they think

278
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.600
God is in the church and actually

279
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.640
God is sitting next to me. At that point

280
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.600
Srimataji turned her head towards me

281
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.560
and smiled and just

282
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.800
kind of a kissed, you know, with her

283
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.000
she just

284
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.760
read my thoughts, you know. It was so nice

285
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.720
yeah.

286
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.400
So yes,

287
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.360
what else? No, this, then it was creative

288
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.520
times as well.

289
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.920
Just a little parentage again, a

290
00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.520
little bracket.

291
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.160
I had a little treat when I was there

292
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.600
after a while.

293
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.680
My friend Bridgette

294
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.680
was in Colombia at the time,

295
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.880
Yzik Nico who is also here

296
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.000
and she was organizing programs for

297
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.200
Srimataji to come into in Colombia.

298
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.560
So as a treat I was sent there to help

299
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.960
with the preparation etc.

300
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.640
And bless Janet Ridley, her mom was a

301
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.840
nurse, look kind of looking, knowing how

302
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.160
to look after small babies.

303
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.680
And she, they took them, the three of them

304
00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.480
to her place somewhere in England, I

305
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.600
think it was

306
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.400
in Derbyshire, and they looked after these

307
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.080
babies for over a week

308
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.200
for me so that I could have a break. Can

309
00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.000
you imagine?

310
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.960
So it was just wonderful, I mean it was

311
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.240
really nice.

312
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.440
It was like a little treat.

313
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.680
There was a lot, apart from the puja and

314
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.760
the bhaja, there was also quite a lot of

315
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.960
creativity

316
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.160
in in Shellsham Road. We had quite a few

317
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.480
meetings, we were receiving people in the

318
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.280
kitchen

319
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.680
because all the rooms were busy, we

320
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.440
didn't have a living room apart from a

321
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.360
meditation room.

322
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.960
But apart from having,

323
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.200
like now I think there's always a lot of

324
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.480
people coming and

325
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.840
chatting in the kitchen etc. But we also

326
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.800
did something,

327
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.360
Janet and I, we had started the year

328
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.320
before

329
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.880
doing a little play for Sri Mataji with

330
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.760
children.

331
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.640
That's how the plays have started. We

332
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.240
have started the play

333
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.800
for Sri Mataji with little children

334
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.680
first.

335
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.480
And the first was the River Thames,

336
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.240
you know, kind of

337
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.240
which was presented at Shudi Thames

338
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.240
actually with all the children

339
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.640
dancing with nursery rhymes. We changed

340
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.520
the words

341
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.560
of the nursery rhymes. And the second play

342
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.400
was about Sri Hanuman.

343
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.280
That was for a puja in Moghit.

344
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.800
And we did the whole kind of play with a...

345
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.880
And it was very nice because other yogi

346
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.200
helped with beautiful costume for

347
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.320
Hanuman,

348
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.480
for the little girls dancing, and we

349
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.600
choreographed

350
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.080
the dance for the girls. We did songs

351
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.880
etc.

352
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.520
And I must say Sri Mataji was very

353
00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.840
delighted by that. I remember

354
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.320
watching her from the stage when we were

355
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.560
organizing the children and she had

356
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.200
really a smile. She was very

357
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.400
pleased.

358
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.960
So yes, we had these kind of creative

359
00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.960
things.

360
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.200
And then, yeah, then I have not much more

361
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.080
to say.

362
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.080
Obviously from there we went to

363
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.640
Shudi Thames to present the babies to

364
00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.160
Sri Mataji.

365
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:14.000
And Sri Mataji named them,

366
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.040
gave them their names at Shudi camps

367
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.600
when we were at Chelcham Road. So she

368
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.280
named the twins because the other one

369
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.800
already Mahadevi

370
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.440
had already got her name before, one year

371
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.400
before.

372
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.200
But she named them Bhakti and Shakti. So

373
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:29.840
she

374
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.480
held them, I remember, very well. We were

375
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.680
in Shudi camps.

376
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.000
I don't remember which puja, but it was

377
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.440
in the summer.

378
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.680
And she held them both in her arms, one

379
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.360
after the other.

380
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.960
And asked them for their

381
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.080
name and she gave small names so that we

382
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:48.640
could

383
00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.040
actually call them together. Bhakti, Shakti,

384
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.920
you know, it's

385
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.680
easy to call these little children.

386
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:58.720
And Marilyn actually remembers that

387
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.280
very well as well. It was lovely.

388
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.640
One child after another in her arms and

389
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.160
naming them.

390
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.440
And they are really, one is really Shakti

391
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.680
and the other one is really Bhakti. They

392
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.120
have the qualities.

393
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.680
One has the quality of Shakti,

394
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:16.640
Shakti power.

395
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.120
The other one is really Bhakti, these

396
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.000
qualities.

397
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.440
It's very nice. So that's what I have

398
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.480
to say about

399
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.840
about Chelcham Road. I think that's what

400
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.960
I remember.

401
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.920
I didn't, actually these stories are just

402
00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.160
in my memory. I didn't have time to write

403
00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.440
them in my diary

404
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.760
because you can imagine I didn't have

405
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.680
time to write diaries at

406
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.200
that time. It was really Krita Yuga,

407
00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.320
very, very busy work. And nevertheless you

408
00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:47.280
remember them

409
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.080
very vividly and it's lovely to hear

410
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.440
these stories.

411
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.240
Yeah. I really don't envy you going into

412
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.720
Chelcham Road with all the wallpaper

413
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.120
falling off. No, no, but what, oh that's

414
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.560
nice that you remind me,

415
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.280
Maureen. I have to say, no, no, no, I have to

416
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:03.920
say that

417
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.200
Chris Marlowe did a wonderful job before

418
00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.360
we arrived.

419
00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:12.000
We bought some wallpaper and we bought

420
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.160
new woolen carpets for the, all the

421
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.640
upstairs and all the rooms

422
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.240
were re-wallpapered and it was actually,

423
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.400
and I made some curtains also because

424
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.200
there was no,

425
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.040
I mean there was hardly anything. So I

426
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.280
made some curtains for all our bedrooms

427
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.160
etc.

428
00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.920
Very nice, thank you for remembering,

429
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.080
reminding me that.

430
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.560
So Chris Marlowe was doing that

431
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.840
completely with benevolence, completely

432
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.560
willingly.

433
00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.520
He didn't ask for any money and, and then

434
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.880
he's the one

435
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.240
that Shri Mataji asked to buy the house,

436
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.040
you know.

437
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.760
And now of course the Chelcham Road

438
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.280
belongs to him

439
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.760
and it's now a Yuva Shakti Ashram and

440
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.640
and he's doing really well. He also

441
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.840
extended the place very much. He extended

442
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.560
the

443
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.000
the, the meditation room, he repaired the

444
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.880
kitchen,

445
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.920
he did two more bathrooms at the top

446
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.880
floor one

447
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.080
and he extended also the roof to make a

448
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.000
beautiful

449
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.880
bedroom at the top. So he did a lot of

450
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.280
work there and consolidated the roof,

451
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.480
did you know.

452
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.800
So it's a livable place and

453
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:23.440
actually

454
00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.880
one Yuva Shakti said once to me, said

455
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.120
you know Antoinette, I know you were

456
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.440
there at another time and sometime when

457
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.120
I found difficult to climb all the

458
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.640
stairs with my little boy,

459
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.120
I remember if Antoinette could do it with

460
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.040
three babies I can do it with one.

461
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.880
Super and those babies were in mother's

462
00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.120
arms at Shudi camps and given their

463
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.560
names which is

464
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.040
very, very sweet and of course leads us

465
00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.000
on to

466
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.280
hearing from Greschner about Shudi camps

467
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.240
and her experience is there. So

468
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.320
thank you very much Antoinette, it's

469
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.800
always lovely to hear all your stories

470
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.440
and

471
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.120
no doubt there are plenty more for

472
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.400
another time.

473
00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.080
Very welcome Maureen, yes thank you. Very sweet.

474
00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.120
So Greschner can you take over from

475
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.000
there?

476
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.200
Shudi camp, when were you there,

477
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.080
what did you do, what happened? Well

478
00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.120
I prepared a little presentation

479
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.560
really. So

480
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.640
the first part of presentation is the

481
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.800
history of Shudi camps

482
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.680
until it was bought by Shimetaji.

483
00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.800
The second part is a short video

484
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.320
it's inauguration of Shudi camps.

485
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.440
This is very important video,

486
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.800
it's 10 minutes only when Shimetaji is

487
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.560
actually

488
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.320
expressing her joy

489
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.840
and she's so pleased. It's just a

490
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.440
wonderful video, she talks about

491
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.600
Shudi camps and the history a little bit

492
00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.560
as well.

493
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.040
And the second part is I'm going to say

494
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.160
about our stay in Shudi camps and then

495
00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.800
there will be photographs and then

496
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.520
Derek can comment on the photographs

497
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.080
and he can take over

498
00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.240
everything. So I try to be very short so

499
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.160
he has plenty of time.

500
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.240
We still have one hour.

501
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.800
So Shruti have you got the information?

502
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.880
I was just, yeah I'm ready.

503
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.320
Greschner would you like me to

504
00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.160
start the photo and you speak

505
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.080
simultaneously? That's how

506
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.640
would you like it like that?

507
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.360
Yes because first I will talk about

508
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.280
Shudi camps,

509
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.640
the history and when I

510
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.360
say video then if you can put the video

511
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.880
on.

512
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.000
They are only from the minute

513
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.520
second, minute two to the minute

514
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.640
12. And when Shimetaji

515
00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.120
finishes speaking about, I mean the

516
00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.800
whole video is about Shudi camps but

517
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.720
the most important things are in the

518
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.680
beginning.

519
00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.600
Okay so I will start now.

520
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.520
Yeah just a minute so before we get

521
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.120
started thank you

522
00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.760
Greschner. Greschner was kind enough to

523
00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.240
share

524
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.040
almost 90 pictures so I apologize

525
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.000
because we were downloading all of them.

526
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.120
The sequence

527
00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.840
Greschner might change a bit but as you

528
00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.000
see it you will know what to say

529
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.160
and maybe one or two pictures might

530
00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.760
come two times because

531
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.760
we just downloaded like we were going

532
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.400
crazy downloading all the photos.

533
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.960
So let me start sharing and I think we

534
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.160
can

535
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.400
just let me know if you see it okay. Is

536
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.320
that fine? That's where we start?

537
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.640
Yes okay. Yes but not to share now

538
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.760
to share later. Okay okay.

539
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.400
Because when I first we have the video

540
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.280
then I have

541
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.360
I have to say something about my stay in

542
00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.360
Shudi camps how it all

543
00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.800
about the August staying there and

544
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.120
everything and then at the end we share

545
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.240
the videos and then

546
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.320
Derek can comment on them. We share the

547
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.520
photos and then we

548
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.400
Derek can comment on them if that's okay.

549
00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:11.200
So I will just start now about the

550
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.200
history of Shudi camps

551
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.320
because it's an old building.

552
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.200
Shudi camp it's called Shudi camps park

553
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.120
house actually the house

554
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.480
and it's a great two-listed building

555
00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.640
and it was fundamentally

556
00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.120
from 17th century later on

557
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:38.240
later on in 18th and 19th century

558
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.960
as some as there were some additions to

559
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.320
to the building

560
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.480
and it was built by

561
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.960
Malmadzic I don't know how to pronounce

562
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.440
Direl in about 1700

563
00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.400
and remained with the family for three

564
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.120
generations so it's quite a long time

565
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.200
and it was it was sold in

566
00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:08.640
1898. It was sold

567
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.200
to a person called

568
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.320
Arthur Gee who

569
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.360
later on he in in four years later he

570
00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.560
died

571
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.320
and then the house was sold to

572
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.360
a vicar of Shudi camps

573
00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.160
and a vicar who was also a

574
00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:32.320
emeritus vicar of early cathedral

575
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.840
and in 1949

576
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.280
on his death it was requisitioned by

577
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.480
British army

578
00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.120
and the house was occupied by the royal

579
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.640
air force

580
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.880
so until Shimataji bought the house

581
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.040
and he and each in the summer

582
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.640
in 1986 and

583
00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.680
the house was the house

584
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.120
belonged to Shimataji

585
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:07.520
for about six years

586
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.160
and it was later on it was sold it was

587
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.120
beautifully

588
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.520
renovated that you have no when you see

589
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.200
the photographs you will see

590
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.560
what a difference and what a

591
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.840
what a difference it made. Yogi's

592
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.920
welcome the house and how beautifully

593
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.120
it looked after the renovation

594
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.760
because it was really in a in a quite

595
00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.400
dilapidated state.

596
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:36.000
Later on it was later on it was both.

597
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.680
One question Breschner.

598
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.960
In 19

599
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:49.520
Breschner can I just ask one question?

600
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.360
Caroline you want to say something?

601
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.160
Yeah you said uh six years it was

602
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.920
bought in 86.

603
00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.040
I went to a puja there in 1996 so that

604
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.680
must be 10 years isn't it?

605
00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.720
19, 1992.

606
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:09.200
Well I went to a puja there in 1996.

607
00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.760
Yeah yeah.

608
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.880
Oh if you did maybe so maybe it was

609
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.880
longer I don't know because I looked at

610
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:20.240
the records

611
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.560
and when it was actually there were

612
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.080
talks from Shubhi Kamsin

613
00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:26.560
and then no we came back to England in

614
00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.520
1996 we went to a puja there.

615
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.840
I don't quite know when it was bought

616
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:32.800
but I know

617
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.240
it was bought it was sold but later on

618
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.040
after Shimataji bought Kabela.

619
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.520
So Shimataji bought Kabela in 1990.

620
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.920
So okay so it was not six years which

621
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.000
is good I was trying to find out and I

622
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.240
couldn't really find out when it was

623
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.520
actually sold and I contacted David

624
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.800
Plal but he didn't have the records.

625
00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:02.000
So the main building

626
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.880
belonged to Sahachi August

627
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.680
and there was the

628
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.360
adjustment building belonged to

629
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.480
a man called Mr Peace and this Mr Peace

630
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.440
became Mr War

631
00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.560
because he was driven mad by the

632
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.440
building were

633
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.120
going on right into the night

634
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.480
and then also in the early hours of the

635
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.960
morning some visiting yogis who were

636
00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.840
actually

637
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.200
not aware that we didn't have the whole

638
00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.200
property to ourselves

639
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.320
were shoe beating on his doorstep

640
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.320
at four o'clock in the morning so

641
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.440
so but somehow he still survived you

642
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.080
know

643
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.520
all this year something must

644
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.760
help him wanting to stay there

645
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.840
because so he was

646
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.720
maybe he was a little bit mad after the

647
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.880
work was finished and there was not so

648
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.080
much banging

649
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:13.440
and shoe beating done.

650
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.600
Okay so if you can have the video now

651
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.760
it's a it just brings everything back

652
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.880
to us I think Shimetaji talking about it

653
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.440
because it was it is in Shuddhi camps and

654
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.400
it is an

655
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:34.640
inauguration of of Shuddhi camps.

656
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.640
Okay.

657
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.640
Okay.

658
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.640
Okay.

659
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.760
All right.

660
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.160
It's so very joyous to see you all here

661
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.760
assembled together.

662
00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.080
I have to thank you very much

663
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.440
for getting such a nice place as this

664
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.600
Shuddhi camp. I have given it a new name

665
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.480
Shuddhi camp meaning cleansing camp

666
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:48.000
which is such an ancient building

667
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.320
it has gone through various stages of

668
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.800
history

669
00:29:54.880 --> 00:30:00.640
and has kept the mark of all these times

670
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.360
and now you have to build up the future

671
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:09.040
on this land

672
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.960
on this spot

673
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.800
in this building.

674
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.280
Also I'm thankful to you for buying such

675
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.760
a nice comfortable car for Me.

676
00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.160
I thought I was supposed to buy but

677
00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.680
everybody said no we are supposed to

678
00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.120
buy it for you Mother.

679
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.320
This is the first house that is in My name.

680
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.600
First house I owned

681
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.600
and this is the first car I have owned in My name.

682
00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.680
I'm so proud that My children have bought it for Me.

683
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.680
They have with their love and affection

684
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.680
have bought this huge big place

685
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.680
as well as the car

686
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.680
for My dwelling as well as for My comfort.

687
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:25.680
As well as for My comfort.

688
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.480
When we come on this earth

689
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.680
when the incarnations descend

690
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:49.280
they don't need a dwelling at all.

691
00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:56.000
They have a dwelling that's roof is the sky

692
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.440
and the clouds are the curtains

693
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.640
and grass is their bed and all the directions are the walls.

694
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.480
But when they reside in the heart of their children

695
00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.160
in the heart of their bhaktas

696
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.160
the heart of their devotees

697
00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.200
then these beautiful hearts create

698
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.120
something so artistic

699
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:38.240
reflecting the joy

700
00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.640
of their own creation

701
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.160
like an artist who sees

702
00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.880
beautiful creation of God Almighty

703
00:32:52.880 --> 00:33:00.640
and feels the joy of that creation within himself

704
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.680
and then recreates it

705
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.200
according to his own

706
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.200
expression of love.

707
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.200
This is what you have done

708
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:27.200
by buying this house and by buying this car for Me.

709
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.200
I don't need any conveyance you know that.

710
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.200
But in the modern times

711
00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.200
the conveyance has changed.

712
00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.200
It started with a little mouse.

713
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.200
Changing into a car

714
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.200
maybe an aeroplane.

715
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.200
But actually

716
00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:23.200
what is my conveyance is?

717
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.200
My conveyance

718
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.200
is your heart.

719
00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.200
Only through your heart

720
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.200
I can be carried.

721
00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:47.200
There's no other way out.

722
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.200
Your sincerity, your devotion

723
00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.200
your love

724
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.200
that can only carry your Mother.

725
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.200
And this is a symbol of that.

726
00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:19.200
Matter has only one facility that you can express your heart

727
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.200
through these material things.

728
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:27.200
Your nobility

729
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.200
your graciousness

730
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.200
your generosity

731
00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.200
is expressed through matter.

732
00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.200
I do that myself

733
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.200
and now you have done it this time.

734
00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.200
I am thankful to you.

735
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.200
As you know very well

736
00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.200
you are not a

737
00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:04.200
that I cannot be contained into anything.

738
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.200
Neither in this house, neither in England

739
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.200
nor in India, nor in the whole universe.

740
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.200
I am rather too large.

741
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.200
But of course in your heart I can be.

742
00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.200
And that is how your heart should be.

743
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.200
For me a comfortable place like a lotus

744
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.200
to relax

745
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.200
to realize my own

746
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.200
love.

747
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.200
When all these things happen

748
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.200
so much adoration

749
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.200
is poured on your Mother

750
00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:18.200
you just get

751
00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.200
boundless.

752
00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.200
You spread out.

753
00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.200
You reach

754
00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.200
such spots

755
00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.200
in the whole of humanity

756
00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.200
everywhere

757
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.200
I can feel the worship.

758
00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.200
The enjoyment of millions

759
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:02.200
of millions who died before

760
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.200
who are there and who will be there.

761
00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:10.200
All this

762
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.200
expands you

763
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.200
into a very subtle

764
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:26.200
sensibility

765
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:34.200
of feeling

766
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.200
every suffering soul

767
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.200
every tortured person

768
00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.200
every unhappy being

769
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.200
Rejna that's

770
00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.200
what you want to see or should I play some more?

771
00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.200
That's how it's

772
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.200
because it's just such an amazing video. It makes me feel

773
00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:12.200
it makes me cry really.

774
00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.200
So you see the Mother was very very

775
00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.200
pleased. It was the first house as she said

776
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.200
that she actually owned herself. She was very pleased with the car that the yogis

777
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.200
bought as well and that was the white Mercedes

778
00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.200
that she had. It was really very nice.

779
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.200
So I just want to

780
00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.200
say about our coming to Shuddhi camps how

781
00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.200
it all happened. After she met a

782
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:48.200
jibotit in the summer

783
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.200
we went there to

784
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.200
actually we didn't know how

785
00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:00.200
long we were going to stay there. We just assumed

786
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:04.200
we were going to live there for as long as required

787
00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.200
really. So Pat went there to do some

788
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.200
plumbing but so many things needed fixing

789
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.200
that actually as you will see from the photos

790
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:20.200
a lot of work went into fixing things

791
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.200
because the place was really just like

792
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:28.200
a church and brow.

793
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.200
In the very beginning you probably remember

794
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.200
it was even different

795
00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.200
to what you see after you

796
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.200
went to live there. So it was like that.

797
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.200
Luckily we had the kitchen

798
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.200
and the kitchen was functional. There was only one

799
00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.200
bathroom. Imagine in this huge place one

800
00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:00.200
bathroom that was there and it was propped

801
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.200
up with very little support just like hanging in the

802
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.200
mid air.

803
00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.200
So we left our London house

804
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:16.200
believing that we were just going to be

805
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.200
living there. When we arrived

806
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.200
we wished that we went there before we actually

807
00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.200
moved because there was nowhere for us to be as family.

808
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:32.200
The men went to one room.

809
00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.200
The ladies went to another room.

810
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.200
We had to leave our little son with

811
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.200
my stepson in our house in London.

812
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.200
Yogi is also living there so they were looking after him.

813
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.200
My stepson was doing A-levels at the time.

814
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:56.200
It was very normal

815
00:41:56.200 --> 00:42:00.200
for Sahaja Yogi suddenly

816
00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.200
to start to move somewhere and go

817
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.200
and do something else to what they were doing.

818
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.200
My husband was working for a

819
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.200
plumbing company so he left his job in the company

820
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.200
and went to do plumbing

821
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:24.200
in Shudi camps. We were so happy

822
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:28.200
to do this. We were regarded as the greatest

823
00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.200
privilege we could have.

824
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:36.200
Of course the whole Shudi family

825
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.200
experience was very highly charged

826
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.200
with the feeling of building the foundations

827
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.200
of Sahaja Yoga in the heart of the universe.

828
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.200
It was just an amazing thing. We were

829
00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.200
very keen to be good Yogis.

830
00:42:56.200 --> 00:43:00.200
We used to get up at four o'clock every day, meditate

831
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.200
and

832
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:08.200
work. Actually

833
00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.200
quite often 12 hours a day,

834
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:16.200
seven days a week, no weekends.

835
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.200
We had some short breaks for

836
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.200
food and it just showed

837
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:28.200
siesta because the men getting up at four o'clock in the morning

838
00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.200
they were a little bit tired. But mind you we were all very young.

839
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.200
I mean comparatively young. So it was not a big deal

840
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.200
for us to do all these things. The men

841
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:44.200
work very hard physically. Now I remember

842
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.200
I just written some names down. I can read them

843
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.200
to you. There was I remember John Watson

844
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.200
son, Ferdi, Arnaldo from Italy, this huge

845
00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:00.200
man. He was like a strong giant and he used to carry everything

846
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:04.200
that was heavy. And you will see him

847
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.200
in the photograph. He's really huge.

848
00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:12.200
And there was Barry Humphrey, there was Erwin from Spain

849
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:16.200
whom I used to call a little Tim. There was

850
00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.200
Lorang who was

851
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.200
at the time

852
00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.200
he was doing carpentry. There was

853
00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.200
Harry Bamra who now is living in Austria.

854
00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:36.200
And he just got his realization

855
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.200
and he came to work and he still had very long hair.

856
00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.200
And you know those days we didn't like the long hair.

857
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.200
But he had long hair because he was

858
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.200
sick and he gave up his turban. But he

859
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.200
was wondering whether to cut his hair

860
00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:00.200
because his mom didn't want his hair to be cut.

861
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:04.200
It was very complicated. Anyway he was

862
00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.200
very enthusiastic. He was very young. He was very good at his

863
00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:12.200
hair. So he was amazing.

864
00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:16.200
And then there were

865
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:20.200
many people coming and going. There were yogis from overseas

866
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.200
especially from France, Italy,

867
00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:28.200
Australia. As far as

868
00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.200
Australia, yogis came to help.

869
00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.200
So actually it was an international project, not only

870
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.200
English project. Also Barry West was coming very often

871
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:44.200
from Cambridge to do electrics.

872
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.200
And there were English yogis coming for the weekends and sometimes

873
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.200
there were so many people staying overnight and coming

874
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.200
to work. There were very few ladies

875
00:45:56.200 --> 00:46:00.200
cooking. So you can quite imagine it was quite a challenge to provide

876
00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.200
all the meals and feed everyone. And

877
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.200
also the Italians came to stay and work.

878
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:12.200
And you see

879
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.200
Shrimataji put in charge an Indian girl called Nita,

880
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.200
young Indian girl. She was in charge of the kitchen because

881
00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:24.200
we were supposed to eat only Indian food.

882
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:28.200
So you can imagine the Italians

883
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:32.200
getting poha, which is the Indian breakfast

884
00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:36.200
full of chilies for breakfast.

885
00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.200
And I mean they were saying

886
00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:44.200
thank you very much. We are not hungry. But

887
00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:48.200
they had to get used to all the Indian food.

888
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:52.200
But the thing is we found out later on that they were

889
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.200
actually having midnight siestas

890
00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.200
with pasta.

891
00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.200
So that's how probably they were not hungry in the morning,

892
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:08.200
obviously, for breakfast. So it was

893
00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.200
quite funny sometimes. So it was so

894
00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:16.200
wonderful to have such an international collective

895
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.200
coming to earth. And at one point

896
00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.200
we brought our son Anand back from London

897
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.200
because Kevin was doing his studies and

898
00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.200
we didn't expect the yogis to look after him for such a long time.

899
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.200
So he came to stay with us

900
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.200
from London. He was sleeping in the dormitory with the ladies.

901
00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.200
But it was very challenging because he was

902
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.200
But it was very challenging because I was in the kitchen all day.

903
00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.200
There was a lake at the back of the house.

904
00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:56.200
You probably remember the lake with no fence.

905
00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.200
I mean, then there was

906
00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:04.200
a work on the roof and the things were falling down

907
00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:08.200
all the time, off the roof. And at one point

908
00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.200
when a huge wheelbarrow of rubble

909
00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:16.200
fell next to him,

910
00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:20.200
we decided, everybody decided

911
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:24.200
there was time for him to find another place.

912
00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:28.200
And Shrimadaji sent him to the school in Rome.

913
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.200
So I was very glad because

914
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:36.200
I was always worried about him.

915
00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.200
So now I would like to say something

916
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.200
about the roof. The biggest job, if you can see

917
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:48.200
behind me, you can see the roof.

918
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:52.200
It's huge. The roof is

919
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:56.200
huge. And the roof was

920
00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:00.200
actually so bad. The roof was very, very bad.

921
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.200
So the first job that we had to do

922
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:08.200
during the summer and the beginning of autumn was

923
00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:12.200
to do something about the roof. The roof had to be changed.

924
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:16.200
And I just want to read to you an extract from

925
00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:20.200
Pat's book, because Pat is not here to

926
00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:24.200
share anything, but I can share something that he

927
00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:28.200
has written

928
00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.200
in his book about the working on the roof

929
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:36.200
fly. To be involved in Sahaja Yoga

930
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:40.200
was to go through a process of change in outward collective

931
00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.200
activity as well as inward experience.

932
00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:48.200
One day Shrimadaji told us that the time had come for us to establish

933
00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:52.200
permanent centres in Ashrams and the first of a series

934
00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.200
of major collective Sahaj-built buildings project kicked

935
00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.200
off when we bought a large house in Cambridgeshire.

936
00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:04.200
Those who could afford contributed money

937
00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.200
and those who could not volunteer work

938
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.200
and some of course contributed both.

939
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.200
So he says, I spent a great deal of time

940
00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.200
there and while we work hard we had

941
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.200
a lot of fun as well. It was the first time I had been

942
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:28.200
out of the countryside for quite a while and I really enjoyed it.

943
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.200
We had not been there long when we discovered that

944
00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:36.200
the roof and the top floor were riddled with wood rot

945
00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:40.200
and that the weight of the roof was starting to push

946
00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:44.200
out the big wooden beams lining the top of the outside walls

947
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.200
on which it rested. You can imagine.

948
00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.200
We needed to dismantle the entire roof,

949
00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.200
the large structure with two wings and numerous dormer windows

950
00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.200
and rebuild it from scratch.

951
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:04.200
We attacked it without a second thought.

952
00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.200
We had two or three carpenters but it was going to take a lot more

953
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:12.200
than that to get the job done and a couple

954
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:16.200
of experienced builders were discovered among

955
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.200
Sahaj Yogis in Australia and flown over to take charge

956
00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:24.200
of a large number of king apprentices.

957
00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:28.200
Standard practices were

958
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:32.200
to construct a huge scaffold roof like a bath

959
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:36.200
while the work went on but we could not afford this

960
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.200
and she told us that she would hold back the rain

961
00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:44.200
as long as we worked as fast as we could.

962
00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:48.200
We worked flat out seven days a week for about six weeks

963
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.200
and towards the end even the village postman was asking us to

964
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:56.200
hurry up because the logs were too big and we were not able to

965
00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:00.200
get the job done.

966
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.200
He was asking us to hurry up because the local gardens needed some rain.

967
00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:08.200
No, really, I mean he really believed it. He was saying

968
00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.200
I can't believe it, it's not even the drop of rain, it was

969
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.200
autumn. It was a brilliant experience.

970
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.200
We had large sections of the top of the building

971
00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.200
off at various points and standing on the top floor

972
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:28.200
of the building, we were surrounded by miles of beautiful countryside.

973
00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:32.200
I love to lie on the roof at night

974
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:36.200
and look at the Milky Way which was wonderfully clear

975
00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:40.200
away from the light pollution of London.

976
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.200
So this is what Pat is saying. I have just a few words to say

977
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:48.200
how it all ended. So in December

978
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.200
we still were working away and I was thinking

979
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.200
because it was quite cold there really, the heating was not

980
00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.200
working. We were just like Antoinette can imagine.

981
00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:04.200
But I mean it was morbid, this was an open

982
00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:08.200
countryside. So it was getting really cold

983
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:12.200
and I was thinking how am I to survive

984
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:16.200
the winter. But Shimataji invited

985
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:20.200
us to

986
00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:24.200
the India tour. I went on the India tour and

987
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.200
I attended my step-sons' cabin wedding as well

988
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:32.200
during the tour. So it was just perfect, it worked out, everything

989
00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:36.200
was done beautifully. So he got married

990
00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.200
actually during the tour.

991
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.200
I went back to Shudi camps afterwards and stayed until

992
00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:48.200
March 1997

993
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:52.200
by which time Pat found himself going to

994
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.200
another project, the ground house of Pratistan

995
00:53:56.200 --> 00:54:00.200
was going to be built. So

996
00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.200
the work on the house continued, many yogis

997
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.200
contributed, there were so many yogis coming and going and living there

998
00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:12.200
and many new people got established as well

999
00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:16.200
because it was a collective place like this big collective ashram

1000
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.200
like Kabela. And of course

1001
00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:24.200
we had children's camps in Shudi

1002
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:28.200
camps and I must tell you Antoinette, the first camp

1003
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.200
was for one week and we did a play.

1004
00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:36.200
It actually started

1005
00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:40.200
with the play written by yoginis and

1006
00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:44.200
the children as well and they rehearsed

1007
00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:48.200
for the whole week.

1008
00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.200
They built the props themselves, they made the costumes themselves

1009
00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:56.200
we had puja, we had havens, we had lots of things

1010
00:54:56.200 --> 00:55:00.200
during that first

1011
00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:04.200
children's camp and there were many more to follow.

1012
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.200
We also had in Shudi camps we had the first Yuva Shakti

1013
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.200
seminar. So I have some photos

1014
00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:16.200
but I'm not going to share them this time.

1015
00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:20.200
Sadly the clinic that Shimadaji wanted to establish

1016
00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:24.200
never really took off properly

1017
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.200
and in the end Shudi

1018
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.200
camps towards the end was not much used.

1019
00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.200
So Shimadaji's husband retired

1020
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.200
and so there was no need for him to be

1021
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.200
in the UK, really to live in the UK and Shimadaji

1022
00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:48.200
decided that the warm climate of Italy

1023
00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.200
would be more agreeable for the family to

1024
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:56.200
to live there, to come there and

1025
00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:00.200
for her work to continue in Europe from Italy.

1026
00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.200
So Shimadaji bought Cabela in 1990.

1027
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:08.200
So now photos and

1028
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:12.200
over to Derek.

1029
00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:24.200
I can't see Derek at the minute Gresina, so could you comment on the photos for now as well?

1030
00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:34.200
Sorry I'm not in the photo, the photo is there, the photo is displayed there.

1031
00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:40.200
So this is what was the first one and then I'll just go as they got downloaded.

1032
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:44.200
Gresina will be speaking.

1033
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:54.200
Derek can say things if you want.

1034
00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:58.200
So the first one was just the front of the house from the

1035
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:02.200
small, the land which we had in the UK

1036
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:06.200
and the small, the land which we had in front of the house.

1037
00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:10.200
Later on the person who bought the house bought more land.

1038
00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.200
The staircase there, the second photo

1039
00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:18.200
was the staircase going up to

1040
00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:22.200
the first floor landing but all that was ripped out

1041
00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:26.200
and a concrete one was put in

1042
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:30.200
which you'll see the photos of later.

1043
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:34.200
That's in the front area

1044
00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:38.200
as you go in on the left through the front doors.

1045
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:42.200
That's outside.

1046
00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:04.200
We replastered all the walls and ceilings there.

1047
00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:08.200
I remember the first delivery was 300 plaster boards

1048
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:12.200
and we had a team of people.

1049
00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:16.200
We had, this is Gazebo which was put up in the

1050
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:20.200
garden for one of the poojas there.

1051
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:24.200
And then we had the

1052
00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:28.200
the second one, the second one, the second one, the third one.

1053
00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:32.200
With Baba Mama's group

1054
00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:36.200
came over.

1055
00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:40.200
That was all work was going on.

1056
00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:44.200
Everyone mucking in the front of the house.

1057
00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:52.200
We had 50 Austrians come

1058
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:56.200
over to help out.

1059
00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:00.200
That's the peacocks

1060
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:04.200
which used to go and peck

1061
00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:08.200
the car hubs when they saw themselves.

1062
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.200
They're reflections.

1063
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:16.200
They're inside as well.

1064
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:20.200
When older people

1065
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:24.200
come over,

1066
00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:28.200
when all the roof was stripped off,

1067
00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:32.200
all the wood was placed outside and someone came along

1068
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.200
and said, I can take it away for you. We said, we'll let you know.

1069
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:40.200
We discovered it was hundreds of years old oak so we sold

1070
00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:44.200
that wood which helped pay for the roof.

1071
00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:48.200
It was very valuable.

1072
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.200
The previous owners who bought it, there was a big fire

1073
00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:56.200
and they covered all the bad fire up with sheets of plasterboard

1074
00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:00.200
so it wasn't revealed until we

1075
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:04.200
had a quick look.

1076
01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:12.200
Also, Shumash's bedroom,

1077
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.200
the whole actual room was covered

1078
01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.200
and the whole attic was lowered down

1079
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:24.200
to accommodate more room.

1080
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.200
We remodelled the main columns in the

1081
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.200
main room. That's the main room before it was done up.

1082
01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.200
We had lots of ladies who were doing, like you see, the stripping of the paint,

1083
01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.200
helping with putting up all the cornice work.

1084
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.200
John Walkinson was making it in the shed outside.

1085
01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.200
That's Finbar. He came along and helped out a lot.

1086
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.200
Now,

1087
01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:22.200
Nalda and Garrah from Derby.

1088
01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.200
Before and after photos. This is coming up from the first floor landing.

1089
01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:36.200
That's just outside Shumash's bedroom on the right at the end of the

1090
01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.200
room.

1091
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.200
We had a lot of people coming in from the first floor.

1092
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.200
Some of the doors we took and we

1093
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.200
soaked them, had them dipped.

1094
01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.200
Myself and our Nalda worked together.

1095
01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.200
He helped me with the plastering.

1096
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.200
Very good decorator as well.

1097
01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:18.200
That's the kitchen extension, which was there when we arrived.

1098
01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.200
All new doors and windows.

1099
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.200
There's Paddy.

1100
01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:36.200
That's Dawn. The other one was Marilyn.

1101
01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.200
There's Marilyn again. Dr Bogdan

1102
01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.200
and his wife.

1103
01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:48.200
It's Harry.

1104
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:52.200
This is the, I think we've got somebody to

1105
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.200
do the metal work for the concrete floor.

1106
01:02:56.200 --> 01:03:00.200
A few days before Shumash's arrival, there was no staircase.

1107
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.200
We'd ripped it out and then they poured the concrete

1108
01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:08.200
and then the day before,

1109
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:12.200
some sahaja yogis turned up from Italy and we said, do you do tiling?

1110
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:16.200
They said yes. We said that's your job. They started laying down the tiles.

1111
01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.200
Before there was nothing there. It was just a space. They laid down the

1112
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.200
tiles on the concrete staircase

1113
01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.200
and it was all touch and go.

1114
01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:32.200
That was the landing coming up. That's the finished staircase.

1115
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.200
On the left, going up the staircase,

1116
01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.200
after they put the tiles, I had to mix up plaster of

1117
01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:44.200
Paris and go up the staircase while they were doing the arty outside.

1118
01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.200
When I finished, somebody was coming up behind me with a paintbrush.

1119
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:52.200
You can see there, a little bit of a white, a little bit of a white.

1120
01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.200
I was just going to put a little bit of paint on the top of the staircase.

1121
01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.200
I was going to put a little bit of paint on the brush. You can see there the gaps in the wall

1122
01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.200
and the people doing the tiling.

1123
01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:08.200
Sahaja Yogi on the right, he was an Austrian policeman

1124
01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.200
and he didn't feel vibrations, but when we went to Kabbalah

1125
01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:16.200
afterwards, he got worked on and then he could feel them.

1126
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.200
In Shri Kamsa, he couldn't feel anything. Somebody may know his name.

1127
01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.200
So, that's it.

1128
01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:28.200
Thank you.

1129
01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:32.200
That's fantastic.

1130
01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:36.200
Derek, did you also have a particular anecdote that you wanted to tell?

1131
01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:40.200
Yes. When I was, I was asked to come to

1132
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.200
Shri Kamsa to work and I asked her,

1133
01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.200
do you want me to move in? And she said yes.

1134
01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:52.200
So, I was living in Birmingham, so I assumed it was going to be a big job.

1135
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:56.200
She said, I have some work for you. So, I came down and moved into Shri Kamsa

1136
01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.200
and then there were people there already,

1137
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.200
already started, but I knew that she wanted me to do plastering and

1138
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.200
every wall and ceiling had to be done. So, I was thinking, it's quite a big job

1139
01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:12.200
and I won't be able to manage it on my own if it wants it to be done quickly.

1140
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:16.200
So, one day I was thinking of that and I was thinking,

1141
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.200
I need some help. And all of a sudden, we didn't have more phones in those days.

1142
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:24.200
There was a phone call from Antonio saying, Shreemashti is on her way.

1143
01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:28.200
She's going to be there within the hour. So, I was thinking, oh no, Shreemashti has read my mind.

1144
01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:32.200
So, we were all there.

1145
01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.200
I ran around telling everyone, Shreemashti is going to be here soon.

1146
01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.200
So, then at the time, it was a gravel driveway

1147
01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:44.200
and there was a whole load of rubble from the top of the road.

1148
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:48.200
A whole load of rubble from the top first floor window out.

1149
01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:52.200
There was that much rubble there. We didn't get skips

1150
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.200
at the time. And then Shreemashti's car arrived

1151
01:05:56.200 --> 01:06:00.200
and there was quite a few people

1152
01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.200
working there. She came out. They did the RT

1153
01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.200
and then I heard her say, where's Fergie?

1154
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:12.200
So, I walked over and she said, what's happening

1155
01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:16.200
with the work? And everyone was looking at me and thinking, don't say

1156
01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:20.200
nothing. And I said, I can't not say anything.

1157
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:24.200
So, she said to me, what do you need? I said, well, we need two more

1158
01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.200
plasterers. We need a carpenter for the windows.

1159
01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.200
We need a plumber. There's Pat. Even though he could do

1160
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.200
plumbing, he didn't know how to heat engineering. How to

1161
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.200
provide the heating in all the rooms in the house. So, she said

1162
01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.200
to me, well, just get them. And I was

1163
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.200
saying that

1164
01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:52.200
at the time, I think it was a Saturday, so

1165
01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:56.200
the next day was a Sunday, she said, just put an advert in the paper. And she asked me

1166
01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:00.200
if I knew any other plasterers. And I said, I'd left London and I don't

1167
01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.200
really know anybody. So, she said, put an advert in the paper. So, I said,

1168
01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.200
okay. And at the time, somebody said to me, oh, do you really

1169
01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:12.200
need these people? I was like, I said, I had to say yes.

1170
01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.200
Actually, I recorded the conversation, so I can upload that

1171
01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.200
at some time, just for proof.

1172
01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.200
And so, after Shemashi

1173
01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.200
asked what we needed, we got what we needed. We didn't

1174
01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:32.200
even have tools. So, I had to have a whip round of the whole collective and say, look,

1175
01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:36.200
if you've got any tools that

1176
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:40.200
you've got spare, because they said the money is only for Shemashi's work,

1177
01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.200
but we needed hammers, we needed lots of tools. So, lots of Sajogi's donated

1178
01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.200
tools. I remember Gresham was saying that the place

1179
01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:52.200
was freezing. So, I remember that

1180
01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:56.200
the

1181
01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:00.200
local leader, Jim, he went and bought some

1182
01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.200
Calogast heaters, which saved the day.

1183
01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.200
When you breathe, you can feel the cold breathing out. So, that

1184
01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.200
was fine. So, we just, that six weeks, we

1185
01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:16.200
worked constantly. And then two weeks before

1186
01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.200
the inauguration, we had a 24-hour shift.

1187
01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.200
So, as you went to sleep, someone else would take your space.

1188
01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:28.200
So, we were just working around the clock. And the story with Mr. Peace

1189
01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:32.200
was that we, I remember

1190
01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:36.200
he called the police a few times, and luckily I was there when the police arrived.

1191
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.200
And they said, oh, we've had a few

1192
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:44.200
complaints about some noise. So, I said, really?

1193
01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.200
So, when the police knocked on the door, I had to say, oh,

1194
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.200
everyone be quiet now, you know. So, I said, look, don't worry, I'll sort it out.

1195
01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:56.200
So, we managed to sort it

1196
01:08:56.200 --> 01:09:00.200
out. So, we kept going. But one time Mr. Peace came in

1197
01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.200
into the kitchen, and I had to sort of pacify him and said, look,

1198
01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.200
you know, we're trying to finish it quickly and everything like that.

1199
01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.200
And, you know, he was all right. So, in the end, everything worked

1200
01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:16.200
out. And that was fine. So, coming up to,

1201
01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:20.200
there's a video which somebody's posted before where it shows

1202
01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:24.200
Sharmatazhi arriving. And on that arrival,

1203
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.200
I remember it was just last minute.

1204
01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:32.200
And they'd just put, the Italian sardiogies had just

1205
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.200
put the towels on the staircase. I had to go up the staircase

1206
01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:40.200
filling it in. And as Sharmatazhi was coming in,

1207
01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:44.200
she walked up the staircase. I remember rushing off,

1208
01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.200
taking off my overalls, throwing them down and just holding my hands out.

1209
01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.200
But unfortunately, the sardiogies who were doing the plumbing on

1210
01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:56.200
CP's shower weren't so lucky. So,

1211
01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.200
they were there around the corner trying to fix things.

1212
01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.200
And it was just, they were trying to do it while

1213
01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:08.200
water was pouring out, while

1214
01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:12.200
the facilities weren't

1215
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.200
connected. So, that was quite funny. But before that,

1216
01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.200
when Sharmatazhi did arrive, she did tell, I don't know if

1217
01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:24.200
people know, but she did say to me that she actually wanted shooting camps

1218
01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:28.200
to be in Scotland. She said, Lord Shiva's in Scotland

1219
01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.200
and if we had had shooting camps in Scotland,

1220
01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.200
the vibrations would be coming down to England from Scotland.

1221
01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.200
But she said a few people didn't want to go north

1222
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:44.200
of England. So, she like

1223
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:48.200
said, okay, Cambridge is a little way, I don't know, it's about 50 miles

1224
01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:52.200
outside London. So, at least that

1225
01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.200
was like helping the country. But she wanted to go further because when

1226
01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.200
Linda was up in Scotland, that was sending vibrations down

1227
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.200
to the country. So, she did stay there for a while

1228
01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.200
and one time. And after

1229
01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:12.200
I actually stayed in Cambridge

1230
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.200
till 1999 because I thought there's always going to be

1231
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:20.200
maintenance. So, I used to go back there to work on the

1232
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.200
house now and again. And then when it was sold, the owner

1233
01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:28.200
asked me to do some work. I had to do some work

1234
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:32.200
on the house to get it ready, even though we'd sold it.

1235
01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:36.200
So, I remember going there and doing work.

1236
01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.200
And we, everybody, it was

1237
01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.200
like Sharmatazhi had it as an excuse for us to get on. So, different

1238
01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.200
nationalities came and we had different, obviously different poojas

1239
01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:52.200
and there's lots of photos. But the main thing was for us to

1240
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.200
get together and share things

1241
01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:00.200
between us. Because after that, Sharmatazhi asked me, like Pat, to go to

1242
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:04.200
Pratishthana, I went there. And then after that, Kibela.

1243
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.200
And so, all the time, I know

1244
01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.200
Antoinette mentioned Shelstrom Road. I moved into Shelstrom Road

1245
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.200
in 1981 and stayed there for months and months while the work,

1246
01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:20.200
Sharmatazhi had work going on. And then afterwards, we had,

1247
01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:24.200
there was a hotel called Brahman Gardens. We moved into

1248
01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.200
there while the house was, her house was being dubbed. So, she used to travel

1249
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.200
from Brahman Gardens to

1250
01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.200
to, back and forward. She used to

1251
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.200
she used to go from the hotel to Brahman Gardens. So,

1252
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.200
that was, so there was lots of different houses. But it was just

1253
01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.200
an excuse for us to spread vibrations with ourselves and

1254
01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.200
just enjoy each other's company. And the story

1255
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:56.200
about what was happening was that a lot of people

1256
01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.200
could not come to England for poojas. So, having

1257
01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.200
the poojas in Italy was a good reason

1258
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.200
because lots of people from Russia, lots of Eastern European countries, they couldn't just

1259
01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:12.200
England's an island and they don't necessarily like lots of people coming here

1260
01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.200
unless you've got a good visa. When you're in Europe, you can just drive around.

1261
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.200
So, Sharmatazhi going to Italy would then enable

1262
01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:24.200
us to, more collective people

1263
01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:28.200
to meet up because she also mentioned, we had one pooja

1264
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.200
where we hired a plane amongst ourselves and 180 of us

1265
01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:36.200
travelled to Italy. And there was a talk where she

1266
01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:40.200
explains that the spirit had to

1267
01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:44.200
go to the soul. Most people know that talk. So, there's lots of connections

1268
01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:48.200
there. So, that's it.

1269
01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.200
Wow.

1270
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.200
Golly, what an evening we've had.

1271
01:13:56.200 --> 01:14:00.200
What an evening we've had.
