1
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,756
Who’s going to translate Me?

2
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,090
Why don’t you take one of these, Gregoire?

3
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,382
Mother, that is the public address microphone

4
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:06,810
– they won’t be able to hear You.

5
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:08,730
This is for the recording on the tape.

6
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,507
Then how will they hear this? …

7
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:17,673
Yes. Then – how will you translate?

8
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:19,507
In French

9
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:21,631
But loudly.

10
00:09:23,424 --> 00:09:25,458
I think, why don’t you stand up and see there

11
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:27,459
– you can stand up there.

12
00:09:27,659 --> 00:09:31,909
Yes, there. And you can talk loudly, that’s a better way.

13
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:35,413
Be careful about those ….

14
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:04,673
May God bless you. Hello – yes, yes!

15
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:09,670
Thank you, thank you. Aradhana has come.

16
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:15,630
Go and see them. There, there!

17
00:10:29,756 --> 00:10:38,673
In the most auspicious time that is called as Krita Yuga,

18
00:10:41,135 --> 00:10:44,819
we all have assembled here

19
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:53,249
to understand the ways and methods

20
00:10:54,424 --> 00:11:02,173
of establishing our Principle of a Master.

21
00:11:06,854 --> 00:11:10,188
Krita Yuga.

22
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,669
“Krita Yuga” means the time

23
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:41,105
when you have to do something –

24
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,771
“krita: when it was done.”

25
00:11:56,596 --> 00:12:00,554
So you are the channels of that doing,

26
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:10,464
doing the work of God.

27
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:18,490
You are the channels of God Almighty and His Power.

28
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:35,441
On one side you have to carry the dignity,

29
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,911
the glory, and the assumption that you are a guru.

30
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:58,465
On the other side you have to be completely surrendered

31
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:01,829
to your God Almighty.

32
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:14,969
All your dignity, your authority comes from Him.

33
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:24,062
And the third thing is

34
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,649
that the way He has created this universe and you,

35
00:13:30,403 --> 00:13:31,466
in a mood of play,

36
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,881
you have to see His play.

37
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:55,560
So a kind of mood that is cheerfulness

38
00:13:55,866 --> 00:14:00,191
should be really bubbling through you.

39
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,029
So far the idea of guru was

40
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:16,098
that such a person never laughs, never smiles,

41
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:18,956
always in a temper.

42
00:14:24,424 --> 00:14:26,340
That was all right for gurus

43
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:30,054
who did not have to have any contact with the public,

44
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:32,116
but hanged themselves with a string

45
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:34,782
somewhere in the Himalayas.

46
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,798
But here we are, facing

47
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:53,503
the entire universe that has to receive

48
00:14:53,843 --> 00:14:56,801
the bubbling streams of your love.

49
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:10,432
But that does not mean that you have to be frivolous,

50
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:12,608
because you cannot be.

51
00:15:18,923 --> 00:15:21,715
The divine play is not frivolous,

52
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,178
it is joyful,

53
00:15:27,631 --> 00:15:30,589
and the joy does not have that duality.

54
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:43,298
So to get to the establishment of your Guru Principle,

55
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:47,340
first we should know how it is destroyed.

56
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:03,946
As it is, anything that is not looked after

57
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:07,340
or maintained gets destroyed.

58
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,046
If we do not pay attention,

59
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:25,549
say, to these beautiful plants here, they will be destroyed.

60
00:16:33,888 --> 00:16:38,264
Even matter which is not attended to gets destroyed.

61
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:48,710
So first of all, we have to know that we must be attentive

62
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:57,590
and alert that if we do not maintain ourselves,

63
00:16:57,848 --> 00:16:59,376
we’ll be destroyed.

64
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,863
Because maintenance is not for maintenance sake,

65
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:22,101
it is for stopping the destruction of your Guru Principle.

66
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:33,347
When we are negligent or lazy about it,

67
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:37,597
we are responsible for destroying our Guru Principle.

68
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,424
So the attention that we have

69
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:54,851
is to be given to the maintenance of this Guru Principle.

70
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:12,215
The gurus have the capacity to maintain themselves

71
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,590
and maintain others.

72
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:29,710
In the beginning, when the gurus tried to establish

73
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:34,968
this maintenance principle,

74
00:18:35,627 --> 00:18:40,294
they put very, very strong rules and regulations.

75
00:18:54,303 --> 00:19:01,555
If you read Bible in the Levi chapter,

76
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:05,291
you will find all the shariats that are described,

77
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:08,515
which they are following now in Riyadh

78
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,798
or in the Arabic countries.

79
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:32,798
To maintain that principle within yourself,

80
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,677
it’s written in such strong languages,

81
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:38,409
like “Such a person who does not do this

82
00:19:38,628 --> 00:19:41,045
should be killed to death.

83
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:53,868
Such a person does anything wrong of this kind

84
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:56,840
should be killed by stoning.”

85
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,923
That was at the very beginning, so the people now

86
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:12,601
at that stage of evolution required that kind of a fear.

87
00:20:19,048 --> 00:20:23,715
This was not meant to in any way to insult or to harm,

88
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:27,453
or to take away the freedom of human beings.

89
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:39,777
But it was meant for people

90
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:44,272
to give a great idea of the importance

91
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:47,507
of the Principle of Guru within themselves.

92
00:20:55,653 --> 00:21:00,862
At that stage they used the frightening methods,

93
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:06,810
I should say – horribly dangerous times.

94
00:21:12,752 --> 00:21:15,835
And that time people obeyed also.

95
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:26,170
Then another evolutionary state took place

96
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,435
where a stage started,

97
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:36,014
people thought they must become austere,

98
00:21:36,387 --> 00:21:40,715
and start maintaining themselves by tremendous austerity.

99
00:21:40,938 --> 00:21:42,792
So it was self-projected;

100
00:21:42,992 --> 00:21:44,963
it was not projected towards others,

101
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:47,419
but projected towards themselves.

102
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:02,788
We can say that the first wave started when the Guru,

103
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:08,286
the Primordial Guru said that if you don’t do this,

104
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,224
then you will be killed.

105
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:15,962
The second stage was where the disciples accepted this

106
00:22:16,254 --> 00:22:19,651
within themselves, and started telling themselves

107
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:23,226
that if we do not do it we’ll kill ourselves.

108
00:22:41,257 --> 00:22:45,945
Austerity started on the basis of wisdom,

109
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:48,184
and not on obstinacy.

110
00:22:54,881 --> 00:22:58,706
But then it became even fanaticism,

111
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,928
so it went to one extreme.

112
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:14,845
It started with the idea of maintenance.

113
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:17,657
It started with the idea of maintenance.

114
00:23:23,563 --> 00:23:28,696
But maintenance itself became impossible,

115
00:23:28,896 --> 00:23:31,242
or perhaps they thought that they are not being

116
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,870
able to maintain, they got confused,

117
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,033
and to them rules and regulations became more important

118
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,224
than maintenance itself.

119
00:23:51,268 --> 00:23:54,683
Thus you find they destroyed themselves.

120
00:23:58,684 --> 00:24:04,268
The wisdom or the essence of Guru Tattwa is a balance.

121
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:14,179
Like when you maintain a plant,

122
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:17,240
if you do not give it water, it will die.

123
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:19,934
If you give it too much water, it will die.

124
00:24:24,673 --> 00:24:28,507
So the wisdom lies in understanding

125
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:33,663
how much water should be given to the plant,

126
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:36,983
so that it comes up at its best.

127
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,169
Now this wisdom has to be achieved

128
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:51,411
through your vibratory awareness.

129
00:24:56,382 --> 00:25:03,105
You are placed under the most fortunate circumstances,

130
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:05,762
that you are realized souls

131
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:10,295
before your Guru Tattwa is fully established.

132
00:25:22,112 --> 00:25:26,615
You have all the powers that any guru can aspire,

133
00:25:26,851 --> 00:25:31,036
without having the establishment of Guru Tattwa.

134
00:25:38,772 --> 00:25:42,913
Specially you are under the complete

135
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:48,202
blanket of the clouds of your Mother’s love.

136
00:25:57,168 --> 00:26:02,049
But in no way Mother’s love is going to allow you

137
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:04,659
to destroy your Guru Principle.

138
00:26:11,191 --> 00:26:17,191
As I told you that Guru Principle is a very sensitive thing,

139
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:22,686
and is destroyed if you yourself do not try to maintain it.

140
00:26:33,733 --> 00:26:37,685
First of all, the destruction starts

141
00:26:37,885 --> 00:26:39,081
from the very source

142
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:47,060
of our being.

143
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:09,538
I mean to say that our being is created by five elements,

144
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,590
and the five elements have a capacity

145
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,861
all the time to get destroyed.

146
00:27:23,396 --> 00:27:27,146
Any one of these elements if they are not looked after,

147
00:27:27,715 --> 00:27:29,359
they get destroyed.

148
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:37,039
That is the built-in capacity of the elements

149
00:27:37,294 --> 00:27:40,002
or of the matter, as you can say.

150
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:47,412
So to maintain them is important.

151
00:27:50,642 --> 00:27:54,435
Some people have an idea that once you become a guru

152
00:27:54,665 --> 00:27:57,707
you need not maintain everything, it is maintained by itself.

153
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:09,890
It is not.

154
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:19,507
Agreed that the spirit definitely enhances the beauty

155
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:22,849
and the health of these elements;

156
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:35,917
but at the human level there is always a greater force

157
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:37,988
that is trying to destroy it.

158
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:48,984
So till we have completely become the spirit,

159
00:28:49,184 --> 00:28:54,133
there is always a chance of this destruction working it out.

160
00:29:05,675 --> 00:29:08,551
One may say, why this balance needed?

161
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:12,937
And this is an important question which we

162
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:17,671
should be able to answer all the people who ask us.

163
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:27,965
Without the balance you cannot ascend.

164
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,938
If you cannot ascend,

165
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:39,139
what’s the use of our becoming human beings?

166
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,065
For example, everything is God,

167
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:53,377
but nobody is aware.

168
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:56,828
At the human level you become aware:

169
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:03,631
means everything exists, everything is there,

170
00:30:03,855 --> 00:30:06,514
but it is not aware.

171
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:17,932
Say, there is a stone, that is also God,

172
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:21,540
but it is not yet aware.

173
00:30:26,132 --> 00:30:31,129
Like say, this area is completely dark and we are blind.

174
00:30:36,465 --> 00:30:38,844
There is nothing to be seen,

175
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:42,915
to be felt or experienced when you are in that condition.

176
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:53,048
Actually one thinks that darkness is the truth,

177
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:58,538
that ignorance is the truth.

178
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:05,132
But when the sun comes up and the light comes in

179
00:31:05,465 --> 00:31:08,631
and your eyes open, you start seeing everything.

180
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:17,370
You start becoming aware.

181
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:24,579
So at human level you are aware at the highest point.

182
00:31:29,475 --> 00:31:31,888
Now this awareness has to become

183
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:35,081
the awareness of the spirit.

184
00:31:42,086 --> 00:31:44,735
That has happened to you

185
00:31:46,881 --> 00:31:48,627
– you have felt the spirit.

186
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,077
But the balance is not there as yet.

187
00:31:55,507 --> 00:32:01,098
Your Mother has pulled you out and made you that,

188
00:32:01,298 --> 00:32:04,163
but still there is imbalance inside.

189
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,901
If you go slightly to the left you can be destroyed;

190
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,934
you go to the right, you’ll be destroyed.

191
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:28,449
So you have to try both the things

192
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:33,446
as I have told you the methods, which I’ll explain.

193
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,133
First of all you have to be austere with yourself.

194
00:32:44,082 --> 00:32:47,416
Just separate yourself from yourself.

195
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:53,251
Separate yourself as a spirit,

196
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:56,404
and look at your ego and superego.

197
00:33:03,498 --> 00:33:05,522
Now you start watching,

198
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:10,225
you start watching the ego and superego.

199
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:13,978
Do not maintain it

200
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,798
– they are the destroying forces.

201
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:29,964
Now when you see the play as a witness

202
00:33:30,369 --> 00:33:32,363
of these destroying forces,

203
00:33:32,563 --> 00:33:37,772
you will know how to also maintain yourself better.

204
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:52,369
To separate yourself is easier when you take to austerity.

205
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,879
The worst thing that elements have done to you

206
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:09,715
is that you have formed habits,

207
00:34:14,124 --> 00:34:16,819
all kinds of hangs-up.

208
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:22,238
Some people are fond of bathing,

209
00:34:22,468 --> 00:34:26,087
some people are fond of not bathing.

210
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:35,900
Some people are fond of getting early in the morning,

211
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:38,715
four o’clock, and singing songs and waking up everyone,

212
00:34:38,933 --> 00:34:43,465
and some are good at sleeping till ten o’clock.

213
00:34:53,401 --> 00:34:56,666
Some like very light-colored dresses,

214
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:59,381
some like very loud-colored dresses.

215
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:07,220
If you are English, then you want to have

216
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,943
English-style everything, horrible insipid food!

217
00:35:23,166 --> 00:35:26,428
If you are French, you want to have wine, little bit.

218
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:36,093
If you are Italian you want to have carbohydrates, too much.

219
00:35:42,063 --> 00:35:45,461
If you are Spanish, you
want to have too much fats.

220
00:35:47,996 --> 00:35:51,922
If you are Indians, you want to have too much of spices.

221
00:35:55,336 --> 00:35:58,867
So to change this habit,

222
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:03,084
you have to give first of all the extremes that you like.

223
00:36:09,756 --> 00:36:19,326
Now if you say that “I like bland food” – bland food

224
00:36:22,715 --> 00:36:26,590
– then you should say “I must eat a lot of chillies.”

225
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:33,088
If you say “I like pale colors,”

226
00:36:33,288 --> 00:36:35,947
then you wear very loud ones.

227
00:36:41,707 --> 00:36:45,131
Go from one extreme to another extreme, to begin with.

228
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,772
But I’ve seen people, when they go from one extreme

229
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,289
they get stuck up on the other side also.

230
00:37:02,104 --> 00:37:06,055
So we have to be in the center, not to the extremes.

231
00:37:10,132 --> 00:37:15,715
A man who is an avadhuta, the one who is a great master,

232
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:22,025
can never be hanged up by any hangs-up.

233
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:34,848
He cannot be ruled by any ideas that “I like this.”

234
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,711
He sees beauty in the lush greenery,

235
00:37:43,911 --> 00:37:46,548
and he sees beauty in the trees

236
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,488
which are devoid of any leaves.

237
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:03,221
Now the trend of getting to austerity

238
00:38:03,436 --> 00:38:06,957
in a very funny way has started in the West.

239
00:38:12,585 --> 00:38:17,393
Like if you comb your hair, then you are no good;

240
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:26,526
if you do not smell in the body, then you are no good;

241
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:33,873
if you don’t look like a pig, you are no good.

242
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,816
All kinds of funny sort of ideas have crawled into the mind,

243
00:38:43,026 --> 00:38:47,003
because they are going to the other extreme.

244
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,779
But we have to learn from the nature.

245
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:58,708
Nature dresses up itself when it has to greet the spring,

246
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:00,889
and when it is the winter

247
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:05,671
it just gets completely undressed, I should say,

248
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:08,996
because the leaves have to go to the Mother Earth,

249
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:13,695
and that the sun has to reach the Mother Earth.

250
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:25,847
It is not attached to anything.

251
00:39:29,424 --> 00:39:33,965
Surprisingly it is much more elemental than we are;

252
00:39:37,385 --> 00:39:42,870
while we who are spiritual should have no attachment.

253
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:50,798
But this idea is also a mental idea,

254
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:53,801
which is the worst attachment.

255
00:40:01,246 --> 00:40:05,422
It’s a very funny attachment which makes Me laugh,

256
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:07,890
that’s the biggest joker I’ve seen,

257
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,023
that people get attached to mental ideas.

258
00:40:23,484 --> 00:40:27,521
It is like believing that whatever you think mentally

259
00:40:27,721 --> 00:40:29,616
will just happen to you.

260
00:40:36,043 --> 00:40:38,791
Say, for a mental person he has to go to picnic,

261
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:42,547
he will mentally put in his mind he’s going to take

262
00:40:42,751 --> 00:40:45,143
this that, that and that.

263
00:40:51,465 --> 00:40:54,570
He may even open a file and write it down that

264
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,770
“I am going to take this and this and this with me.”

265
00:41:03,374 --> 00:41:06,496
And when he goes to the picnic he finds he’s high and dry,

266
00:41:06,696 --> 00:41:08,416
because he has not taken anything with him,

267
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:11,417
it’s all in the file!

268
00:41:20,624 --> 00:41:24,416
Your Mother is good at speaking and She speaks to you,

269
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:28,912
but it should not be your mental attachment.

270
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:42,560
Like “Yes, Mother says so,”

271
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,544
and everybody discusses with such great enthusiasm,

272
00:41:46,744 --> 00:41:48,536
this is that; but it’s not become

273
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,675
part and parcel of your being.

274
00:42:01,098 --> 00:42:04,515
But is a very common attachment nowadays,

275
00:42:04,715 --> 00:42:07,298
with all the people knowing about everything

276
00:42:07,498 --> 00:42:09,501
and having nothing.

277
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:20,715
This mental attachment is to be really attacked.

278
00:42:30,396 --> 00:42:35,939
Becoming is seeing, becoming is experiencing;

279
00:42:37,245 --> 00:42:41,661
becoming is seeing, it is experiencing.

280
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:48,359
Like if I have to come to this place,

281
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,767
I must come and see it.

282
00:42:55,169 --> 00:42:58,544
If only I have thoughts about it and mental idea,

283
00:42:58,761 --> 00:43:02,719
mental picture, it is no good, I can – it’s not mine,

284
00:43:03,218 --> 00:43:04,885
it’s not the truth.

285
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:15,162
So when you become aware, actually what happens that it,

286
00:43:15,362 --> 00:43:19,612
you see it yourselves – so let us see.

287
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:31,241
Get out of that mental conception

288
00:43:31,524 --> 00:43:34,505
that you know already about it.

289
00:43:43,673 --> 00:43:46,265
You do not know,

290
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:49,042
because what you know is just mental.

291
00:43:50,957 --> 00:43:54,592
That should be a part and parcel of your being.

292
00:44:00,225 --> 00:44:03,225
Now how to do it?

293
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:06,923
Some will say that

294
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:11,151
“We’ll just go on being austere about it.”

295
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:18,079
Then that will become again another obsession.

296
00:44:20,469 --> 00:44:21,593
Some will say, “All right,

297
00:44:21,795 --> 00:44:26,003
Mother has said we should enjoy, so we’ll just enjoy.”

298
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,258
How to strike the balance

299
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:40,537
is the big problem,

300
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:43,707
but should not be with people

301
00:44:43,939 --> 00:44:46,374
who have vibratory awareness.

302
00:44:50,507 --> 00:44:54,957
In that also you can be obsessed.

303
00:44:57,507 --> 00:45:00,291
I have seen people talking as if they are all

304
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:02,723
great Sahaja yogis and there were no vibrations,

305
00:45:02,923 --> 00:45:05,025
and saying they are getting vibrations.

306
00:45:14,356 --> 00:45:17,605
It is so deceptive.

307
00:45:20,314 --> 00:45:23,522
So one has to think that we have to grow further

308
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:28,067
and see more and more, and know about it.

309
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,999
But if you then ask the French “How are you?”

310
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,615
then under the influence of this, they’ll say like this:

311
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:46,967
that means they’re always in imbalance.

312
00:45:56,915 --> 00:45:59,949
You ask an Englishman, he’ll say, “Don’t know.”

313
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:08,741
Or they say “I know” – there’s nothing in between.

314
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:13,481
Now we have to understand that

315
00:46:13,681 --> 00:46:17,056
we are carrying the light in our hand,

316
00:46:20,268 --> 00:46:22,814
and the light should not shake.

317
00:46:24,673 --> 00:46:26,895
We have to hold the light tight,

318
00:46:28,756 --> 00:46:31,652
and we should have a concentrated attention

319
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,879
towards the maintenance of the light.

320
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:44,238
And then to tell yourself that we have to see,

321
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:47,598
not to just understand mentally.

322
00:46:54,174 --> 00:46:56,618
It’s to be actually aware;

323
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,865
because you are complete otherwise,

324
00:47:04,242 --> 00:47:06,651
you are the part and parcel of the whole

325
00:47:08,305 --> 00:47:10,426
– you are.

326
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:15,988
But only thing, that you have not yet seen that.

327
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,636
You have mentally accepted,

328
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:24,127
but you have not become that.

329
00:47:27,715 --> 00:47:30,493
Because mental projection comes from thought;

330
00:47:33,021 --> 00:47:35,612
that means you are at the level of the thought.

331
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:40,312
You have to become thoughtless.

332
00:47:43,007 --> 00:47:45,693
But if you live on the basis of thought

333
00:47:45,893 --> 00:47:49,312
then you are still below the Agnya Chakra.

334
00:47:53,215 --> 00:47:56,139
So all the thought waves must be stopped to begin with,

335
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:59,391
and should say that “All right, let us see now.”

336
00:48:07,492 --> 00:48:10,378
So from the Nabhi Chakra you come up

337
00:48:10,578 --> 00:48:12,723
to the Agnya Chakra.

338
00:48:16,862 --> 00:48:21,544
Then above that comes the third problem of destruction,

339
00:48:21,801 --> 00:48:24,254
is emotional.

340
00:48:37,673 --> 00:48:43,048
The emotional is a very subtle one.

341
00:48:46,954 --> 00:48:49,121
Like some people, Sahaja yogis,

342
00:48:49,344 --> 00:48:51,345
will sit down with a guitar

343
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:57,757
and will start singing as if they are all lovebirds, you see!

344
00:49:10,953 --> 00:49:14,293
What is it? What is it?

345
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:18,807
Come along. Come, come...

346
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:21,882
What has happened?

347
00:49:22,957 --> 00:49:24,836
Why, why do you cry?

348
00:49:25,071 --> 00:49:28,154
Come to Me, come to Me. All right.

349
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:35,802
Just take her away. She’s caught up.

350
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:43,477
So the most delicate one is the emotional.

351
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:55,112
This emotional one is a collectivity in a camouflage.

352
00:50:01,075 --> 00:50:03,413
For example, when the Sahaja yogis will meet,

353
00:50:03,613 --> 00:50:06,718
they’ll hug themselves, kiss each other,

354
00:50:06,918 --> 00:50:11,126
and will be very, very nice to each other, you see,

355
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:14,700
and sit down and sing songs like hippies.

356
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:34,190
Take the guitar in the hand and swing on the tune of love.

357
00:50:40,128 --> 00:50:44,258
This is actually Vishuddhi at the collectivity point,

358
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:51,707
and that of course is very difficult to get rid of,

359
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:59,797
because it gives you a very comfortable feeling.

360
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:10,393
And people get confused with emotions,

361
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,933
they think it is joy.

362
00:51:18,405 --> 00:51:23,488
Joy only can be achieved through complete detachment,

363
00:51:28,715 --> 00:51:34,050
the detachment which is ego-less and superego-less.

364
00:51:37,979 --> 00:51:43,687
But now, the problem that human beings start facing

365
00:51:44,299 --> 00:51:50,837
is the assumption that they are gurus.

366
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:04,920
They start speaking about Sahaja Yoga,

367
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,765
talking about Sahaja Yoga,

368
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:09,760
and they start thinking that

369
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:13,247
they have become already Shri Krishna.

370
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:28,132
They have even a greater ego than

371
00:52:28,654 --> 00:52:32,446
the person who is

372
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:40,211
actually ignorant about Sahaja Yoga.

373
00:52:50,737 --> 00:52:53,487
They start talking with such tremendous ego

374
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:56,375
that I am Myself frightened of them:

375
00:52:56,654 --> 00:52:58,580
how much they know about Sahaja Yoga,

376
00:52:58,798 --> 00:53:01,756
I sometimes think?

377
00:53:13,703 --> 00:53:18,455
And they start asserting it so much that it’s frightening.

378
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:28,460
All this can be also said, that

379
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:31,264
they feel that protocol is not all right

380
00:53:31,464 --> 00:53:33,042
and there should be proper protocol,

381
00:53:33,242 --> 00:53:34,723
so we are looking after protocol,

382
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:36,617
we are the guards of the protocol,

383
00:53:36,817 --> 00:53:38,784
and all these things there.

384
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:48,540
Now those who are on the emotional side

385
00:53:48,805 --> 00:53:52,193
see the ego of others, while those who are on the ego side

386
00:53:52,393 --> 00:53:54,928
see the emotions of others.

387
00:54:03,299 --> 00:54:05,881
So one criticizes another,

388
00:54:08,048 --> 00:54:13,408
but they don’t see themselves that they are falling a trap

389
00:54:13,608 --> 00:54:15,636
into one of the extremes.

390
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:25,465
So unless and until you are detached, you cannot see it.

391
00:54:33,824 --> 00:54:35,836
I will not say I did, committed a mistake,

392
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:38,700
but it happened to be a mistake.

393
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,033
For the first three years of Sahaja Yoga

394
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:47,500
never talked of a bhoot.

395
00:54:51,642 --> 00:54:54,716
I thought I’ll be able to manage without that.

396
00:54:58,706 --> 00:55:02,453
But a lady came in Sahaja Yoga who was possessed

397
00:55:02,653 --> 00:55:05,844
and who tried all kinds of tantric tricks,
so I had to tell them.

398
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:17,927
Now every Sahaja yogi is a bundle of bhoots!

399
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:24,795
You ask any Sahaja yogi,

400
00:55:25,058 --> 00:55:28,197
“Why did you do it?” – “Must be a bhoot.”

401
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:40,276
If you say that “How is it that you have done such a thing?”

402
00:55:40,476 --> 00:55:42,114
then they will say that

403
00:55:42,314 --> 00:55:45,906
“I do not know, it’s the bhoot who has done.”

404
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:55,974
They are never there – all the bhoots are there.

405
00:56:01,075 --> 00:56:04,408
Now I don’t understand how to deal even as a Guru,

406
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:07,775
because if My disciples are there I can tell them,

407
00:56:08,053 --> 00:56:11,253
but if they are bhoots, what am I to tell them?

408
00:56:18,189 --> 00:56:20,496
I can talk to Sahaja yogis but not to bhoots,

409
00:56:20,696 --> 00:56:22,529
they won’t listen to Me.

410
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:29,091
So this is the greatest escape

411
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:31,157
that Sahaja yogis have found now,

412
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,889
which is the worst, which was never before.

413
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:42,540
So sometimes I feel it was a mistake

414
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,499
I introduced this word “bhoot.”

415
00:56:53,113 --> 00:56:55,674
They excuse themselves by just saying,

416
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:58,237
“Mother, it is some negativity.”

417
00:57:05,749 --> 00:57:09,498
Unless and until there is something in you

418
00:57:09,699 --> 00:57:14,195
that contains the negativity, how can there be negativity?

419
00:57:20,424 --> 00:57:23,178
If you are detached, if like stone,

420
00:57:23,378 --> 00:57:27,614
then you cannot contain this negative water in itself, in it.

421
00:57:35,002 --> 00:57:36,871
You don’t become more negativity,

422
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,490
you become more a guru.

423
00:57:45,828 --> 00:57:49,328
Now, when I say that you should not be negative

424
00:57:49,536 --> 00:57:51,394
– supposing under such circumstances

425
00:57:51,631 --> 00:57:53,715
you should not be a bhoot, you should be yourself

426
00:57:53,931 --> 00:57:56,298
– then they start feeling guilty.

427
00:58:04,707 --> 00:58:09,195
So all kinds of anti-guru tricks are working out.

428
00:58:13,405 --> 00:58:16,821
I am your Guru, and it is anti your Guru

429
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:19,711
to play these tricks upon yourself.

430
00:58:24,532 --> 00:58:28,600
Now you will play these tricks with Me, what’s the use?

431
00:58:33,726 --> 00:58:35,704
You have to gain something,

432
00:58:35,904 --> 00:58:38,191
and you are playing trick against yourself

433
00:58:38,392 --> 00:58:40,628
if you are playing them against Me.

434
00:58:51,275 --> 00:58:53,764
You have to be more aware.

435
00:58:56,002 --> 00:58:59,127
You are not to be destroyed.

436
00:58:59,715 --> 00:59:03,033
Apart from that you have to save others.

437
00:59:06,899 --> 00:59:10,659
How will you do it, in case if you do not accept

438
00:59:10,859 --> 00:59:14,603
that it is your privilege,

439
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:17,279
that it is your fortune,

440
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:19,616
that you have been chosen

441
00:59:19,893 --> 00:59:24,167
to be the medium of God’s work?

442
00:59:38,396 --> 00:59:40,769
Sometimes I feel all the bhoots have come to Me

443
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:42,803
for realization, and I am now going to become

444
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:44,596
a bhoot Myself!

445
00:59:58,211 --> 01:00:02,698
“Bhoot” also means “Bhootnath”– is the name of

446
01:00:03,418 --> 01:00:05,855
Shri Shankara, Shri Shiva,

447
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:14,058
because He gets after the bhoots all the time.

448
01:00:18,426 --> 01:00:20,899
But you have to be the present and not the bhoot

449
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:22,573
– “bhoot” means the past.

450
01:00:26,424 --> 01:00:31,090
Then what is there to be known? You become.
Then you are in the present,

451
01:00:33,972 --> 01:00:35,721
you just start becoming,

452
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:37,942
evolving,

453
01:00:39,446 --> 01:00:40,675
blossoming.

454
01:00:42,613 --> 01:00:45,387
Try to be in the present.

455
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:51,372
Do not escape the present, face it.

456
01:00:52,596 --> 01:00:55,555
Don’t feel guilty nor blame the bhoot;

457
01:00:55,898 --> 01:00:58,849
both things are going to take you away from the present.

458
01:01:06,132 --> 01:01:11,465
Now just see the whole nature, the whole divine Power,

459
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:17,625
your ardent desire of ages

460
01:01:18,612 --> 01:01:21,612
– everything is on your side.

461
01:01:32,509 --> 01:01:34,219
The time has come.

462
01:01:35,939 --> 01:01:37,667
You are just there.

463
01:01:40,424 --> 01:01:42,573
What have we to do?

464
01:01:44,916 --> 01:01:47,605
Just stand in the center,

465
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:51,301
at the axis.

466
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,927
Try to keep yourself at the axis,

467
01:01:57,931 --> 01:02:01,743
and then you just see the periphery moving, you don’t mind.

468
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:09,973
When you see yourself misbehaving in any way,

469
01:02:10,231 --> 01:02:12,083
punish yourself.

470
01:02:14,975 --> 01:02:18,465
It is better that you punish than the Divine punishes you,

471
01:02:18,665 --> 01:02:20,741
because that’s a severe punishment.

472
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,291
But do not feel guilty because

473
01:02:28,491 --> 01:02:29,704
you have not done anything wrong,

474
01:02:29,904 --> 01:02:32,113
it’s the bhoot which has done!

475
01:02:45,646 --> 01:02:49,146
So we come to the point that we should realize

476
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,973
that we are gurus and we cannot be bhoots.

477
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:09,075
We have to change our outside also, to become good gurus.

478
01:03:19,384 --> 01:03:23,509
For example, we have to learn good manners.

479
01:03:27,502 --> 01:03:30,696
Then these manners become your nature.

480
01:03:35,556 --> 01:03:38,011
Sometimes, people who are very fond of food,

481
01:03:38,211 --> 01:03:41,336
I always tell them they should fast.

482
01:03:46,385 --> 01:03:49,284
Whatever you are fond of, try to give up.

483
01:03:56,543 --> 01:04:01,877
Try to overcome your sicknesses of attachments,

484
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:09,424
your habits.

485
01:04:09,854 --> 01:04:13,188
Once your Guru Tattwa is established,

486
01:04:13,828 --> 01:04:17,495
you’ll be accepted as a guru.

487
01:04:23,688 --> 01:04:26,521
There will not be any need for you to say

488
01:04:26,753 --> 01:04:29,216
that you are a guru, people will know that you are.

489
01:04:36,135 --> 01:04:38,551
We don’t have to then write on our foreheads

490
01:04:38,874 --> 01:04:40,588
that we are gurus, people will know that

491
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:45,036
this is a guru walking; you can see the divinity walking,

492
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:49,783
you can see the dignity walking, the glory coming up.

493
01:05:02,775 --> 01:05:05,628
You have to change from within,

494
01:05:07,673 --> 01:05:11,923
and the light of that within enlightenment

495
01:05:12,207 --> 01:05:14,850
will be shown outside.

496
01:05:21,972 --> 01:05:26,859
But it should not be a mental idea or an emotional idea,

497
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:30,077
but should be the happening,

498
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:33,909
the becoming, the awareness.

499
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:47,424
You have to experience,

500
01:05:47,673 --> 01:05:52,153
through your own experimentation upon yourself.

501
01:05:58,842 --> 01:06:00,991
Even I do that.

502
01:06:02,545 --> 01:06:05,088
When I cannot reach you from one end

503
01:06:05,393 --> 01:06:08,726
because you are a bhoot, I reach you from the other.

504
01:06:14,059 --> 01:06:16,604
If somebody says he’s a bhoot,

505
01:06:16,908 --> 01:06:21,325
then I see that he suffers a little

506
01:06:21,981 --> 01:06:25,319
and faces it, the bhoot in him.

507
01:06:31,242 --> 01:06:34,894
For example somebody, I tell someone that

508
01:06:35,198 --> 01:06:38,531
“Please do this” and he forgets completely about it,

509
01:06:38,792 --> 01:06:41,843
and he says it is a bhoot that has done.

510
01:06:48,498 --> 01:06:51,264
So then he loses his purse and then I say,

511
01:06:51,464 --> 01:06:54,286
“The bhoot must have taken away the purse!”

512
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:03,513
But I experiment with Myself.

513
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:09,977
I first see how I should approach you.

514
01:07:10,246 --> 01:07:13,759
If it doesn’t work out I try something else

515
01:07:16,596 --> 01:07:18,685
within Myself,

516
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:22,443
because it’s a very tricky time we are with.

517
01:07:26,939 --> 01:07:30,062
If we had gone according to the shariat

518
01:07:30,278 --> 01:07:32,570
of the chapter of Levi,

519
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:36,294
all the bhoots would not have been here.

520
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:46,102
Maybe no Sahaja yogis might have been left also.

521
01:07:50,622 --> 01:07:53,460
And this mental projection is such a common thing

522
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:56,343
that it’s difficult to detach people,

523
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:59,596
but only way I can play tricks with you

524
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,947
is by experimenting Myself on you.

525
01:08:12,173 --> 01:08:14,996
In the same way you must play with yourself,

526
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:23,783
and try to put yourself in an experimental box.

527
01:08:39,663 --> 01:08:44,046
Today is the day of the Guru Puja,

528
01:08:44,305 --> 01:08:48,173
the day when you have to worship your Guru.

529
01:08:53,961 --> 01:09:00,086
You are really fortunate to have a Guru which is a Mother.

530
01:09:05,451 --> 01:09:10,824
And My mother and guru is this Mother Earth,

531
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:15,195
which teaches Me how to deal with human beings.

532
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:30,655
And she’s the one who also in every stage of difficulties

533
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:34,631
helps Me to correct

534
01:09:34,831 --> 01:09:43,159
My own methods of nirmala vidya.

535
01:09:53,079 --> 01:09:59,853
She has been such a kind mother and a kind guru to Me.

536
01:10:06,323 --> 01:10:09,788
And she’s such a soothing personality.

537
01:10:12,883 --> 01:10:17,926
This, all this green, though is given to her by sun as they say,

538
01:10:18,151 --> 01:10:22,109
is just to soothe us all.

539
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,193
She wears the green upon herself,

540
01:10:32,364 --> 01:10:35,609
and the green is the Guru Principle.

541
01:10:39,961 --> 01:10:42,533
She’s the detached personality.

542
01:10:45,019 --> 01:10:46,663
She’s the magnetism,

543
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:50,527
she attracts.

544
01:10:52,597 --> 01:10:58,726
When people are walking on her, she is looking after them.

545
01:11:03,393 --> 01:11:07,374
She creates out of her swayambus,

546
01:11:07,574 --> 01:11:09,887
the self

547
01:11:12,585 --> 01:11:15,211
– what should we say to swayambhu?

548
01:11:15,727 --> 01:11:18,647
– ah, yes, self-manifested stones.

549
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:29,113
See, her attraction and her concern

550
01:11:29,337 --> 01:11:33,915
is so great that without her we would be hanging in the air.

551
01:11:40,885 --> 01:11:44,521
And she keeps Me to the brass tacks, as they say

552
01:11:44,723 --> 01:11:46,271
– to the reality.

553
01:11:51,105 --> 01:11:54,391
If I wanted I could be just the Spirit,

554
01:11:54,598 --> 01:11:57,573
and not bother about anybody else.

555
01:12:03,553 --> 01:12:06,109
The way she bears our sins,

556
01:12:06,309 --> 01:12:12,515
the way she always looks after us and nourishes us,

557
01:12:12,715 --> 01:12:15,951
despite our so many defects:

558
01:12:16,151 --> 01:12:19,024
in the same way a guru should do.

559
01:12:32,105 --> 01:12:34,753
She is extremely forgiving;

560
01:12:37,268 --> 01:12:38,977
but she explodes

561
01:12:42,404 --> 01:12:44,419
as an earthquake,

562
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:52,305
and sometimes hot calcium

563
01:12:52,673 --> 01:12:55,092
and hot potassium can come out of her.

564
01:13:01,912 --> 01:13:05,638
She produces sulphur for you, for your cure.

565
01:13:08,813 --> 01:13:13,656
If England’s soil becomes vibrated,

566
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:17,856
then this soil can be used for medicine.

567
01:13:24,438 --> 01:13:27,943
In India people use clay for medicine,

568
01:13:28,143 --> 01:13:30,142
for every kind of treatment.

569
01:13:36,517 --> 01:13:40,541
The understanding about Guru Tattwa

570
01:13:40,741 --> 01:13:43,314
one can have from the Mother Earth,

571
01:13:43,514 --> 01:13:48,097
so let us touch the Mother Earth and bow to her.

572
01:14:04,227 --> 01:14:07,227
May God bless you.

573
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:23,082
She’s subtle!

574
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:46,708
In the Kundalini Shastra, Mother Earth is the Kundalini.

575
01:14:57,727 --> 01:15:02,061
Mooladhara is the, is the Mother Earth.

576
01:15:06,563 --> 01:15:11,672
So for us kundalini is the most important thing.

577
01:15:14,281 --> 01:15:20,373
We don’t have to worry about what they have talked about

578
01:15:20,573 --> 01:15:25,856
in the Levi, that you must not steal, you must not tell lies;

579
01:15:26,056 --> 01:15:30,931
what we have to worry that keep your kundalini up.

580
01:15:41,256 --> 01:15:48,129
So the guru has to be a person who is absolutely practical.

581
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:55,985
He must have common sense and absolutely practical,

582
01:15:56,256 --> 01:15:58,168
he cannot be impractical person.

583
01:16:01,484 --> 01:16:05,393
A person who’s impractical is not a guru.

584
01:16:08,232 --> 01:16:12,943
But practical in the common way is understood as a man

585
01:16:13,143 --> 01:16:16,389
who is cunning, who know how to deviate from right path

586
01:16:16,589 --> 01:16:20,881
and all that – that’s the most unpractical thing to do.

587
01:16:29,815 --> 01:16:33,137
Something absurd, something out of the blue

588
01:16:33,368 --> 01:16:36,743
is not the way a guru has to move.

589
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:45,592
There is all common sense which should

590
01:16:45,831 --> 01:16:49,831
guide a guru how to deal with a person,

591
01:16:57,502 --> 01:17:01,343
and common sense is a thing which is not

592
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:05,547
cunningness by any chance.

593
01:17:10,775 --> 01:17:13,911
The source of common sense is the spirit.

594
01:17:18,281 --> 01:17:24,364
The expression of a guru is very, very

595
01:17:26,711 --> 01:17:30,422
paradoxical – paradoxical.

596
01:17:34,656 --> 01:17:38,580
For example, a guru will be extremely practical,

597
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:41,336
supposing he has to build his own house,

598
01:17:41,536 --> 01:17:45,781
or a house or ashram or anything – be extremely practical.

599
01:17:50,521 --> 01:17:53,298
He will be very economical,

600
01:17:53,498 --> 01:17:56,511
he will create something out of the blue;

601
01:17:56,711 --> 01:17:59,572
people will be amazed how he’s done it so practical.

602
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:05,493
But he’ll be so detached

603
01:18:05,693 --> 01:18:09,295
that if this ashram is to be donated to somebody,

604
01:18:09,495 --> 01:18:11,373
in one second he’ll donate.

605
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:23,870
For acquiring – say, for example, for acquiring a lamp,

606
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:26,103
the guru will be very practical,

607
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:31,382
he’ll get the best and the cheapest and the most beautiful.

608
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:42,138
And he’ll be very intense about it.

609
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:46,095
But when it will come to giving,

610
01:18:46,295 --> 01:18:48,283
he’ll be more intense about it;

611
01:18:53,408 --> 01:18:56,597
that when he will give, he’ll give with that same intensity.

612
01:18:58,313 --> 01:19:00,967
He’ll find out all practical methods how to donate,

613
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:03,694
also to give away.

614
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:12,724
So his acquiring is actually giving.

615
01:19:17,715 --> 01:19:19,860
He acquires to give,

616
01:19:21,499 --> 01:19:24,498
that’s how he is the most practical.

617
01:19:27,586 --> 01:19:32,336
You know that we cannot take anything with us.

618
01:19:39,173 --> 01:19:43,074
Only the guru can take with him something,

619
01:19:46,606 --> 01:19:48,428
nobody else can take.

620
01:19:51,413 --> 01:19:56,785
Only the guru has all the disciples and disciples,

621
01:19:56,985 --> 01:20:01,219
and disciples and disciples for ages,

622
01:20:01,419 --> 01:20:03,744
who sing the praise.

623
01:20:13,242 --> 01:20:17,303
No other relationship is that eternal.

624
01:20:20,722 --> 01:20:24,806
It goes on reflecting for ages and ages and ages.

625
01:20:28,695 --> 01:20:32,737
It’s one wave that falls and then disappears;

626
01:20:33,012 --> 01:20:37,276
in anything that you do every wave has disappears,

627
01:20:37,476 --> 01:20:41,768
but not the wave of knowledge from a guru.

628
01:20:47,503 --> 01:20:54,921
It’s even higher than the Divine Principle,

629
01:20:59,223 --> 01:21:02,440
because it explains.

630
01:21:08,139 --> 01:21:10,633
The Divine Principle cannot explain

631
01:21:13,169 --> 01:21:15,545
– it’s the guru who explains it.

632
01:21:18,862 --> 01:21:22,195
Not that it manifests, but it’s explains and it works out,

633
01:21:22,416 --> 01:21:26,957
so he’s the master of the Divine Power.

634
01:21:33,047 --> 01:21:38,594
So in a way, Divine Power is like the meaning of the guru.

635
01:21:43,781 --> 01:21:46,537
Like the word has the meaning,

636
01:21:46,737 --> 01:21:50,880
and the word – I’m sorry, the word has the meaning,

637
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:54,245
and the word serves the meaning.

638
01:21:59,254 --> 01:22:05,918
But in a Guru Principle, the Divine serves the guru.

639
01:22:13,748 --> 01:22:17,332
Everything is at your disposal.

640
01:22:18,483 --> 01:22:20,653
Everything is at your disposal.

641
01:22:23,463 --> 01:22:25,110
When you are a guru,

642
01:22:26,111 --> 01:22:27,663
all your chakras

643
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:31,017
are at your disposal.

644
01:22:32,424 --> 01:22:34,780
All the universe is at your disposal,

645
01:22:36,007 --> 01:22:37,344
because you are the guru.

646
01:22:38,243 --> 01:22:40,881
It’s like the director of the show

647
01:22:45,569 --> 01:22:47,616
– the stage man,

648
01:22:47,824 --> 01:22:49,752
the gentleman who is in charge of the lights,

649
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:52,173
the gentleman who is in charge of the loud-speaker,

650
01:22:52,373 --> 01:22:55,225
everybody has to serve the director,

651
01:23:03,741 --> 01:23:06,847
because he is training the actors.

652
01:23:09,601 --> 01:23:16,851
But the Guru Principle has to be so much unchallenged.

653
01:23:17,177 --> 01:23:18,985
It should be of such a capacity

654
01:23:19,185 --> 01:23:21,273
that nobody can challenge that,

655
01:23:21,481 --> 01:23:25,057
it should be such a capable personality

656
01:23:25,278 --> 01:23:28,782
that nobody should be able to challenge the guru.

657
01:23:28,987 --> 01:23:31,506
Then only it will work out.

658
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:46,163
So you have to work it out in such a way

659
01:23:46,363 --> 01:23:49,826
that you are absolutely unchallengeable.

660
01:23:53,337 --> 01:23:57,348
And you are specially fortunate

661
01:23:57,548 --> 01:24:01,215
that you can see yourself and correct yourself,

662
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:05,230
which nobody could do before – you are your own guru.

663
01:24:13,355 --> 01:24:17,098
This situation never, never happened.

664
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:23,044
You are your own guru

665
01:24:24,944 --> 01:24:27,987
– and let Me be your Mother.

666
01:24:30,174 --> 01:24:34,341
That would be the best for Me.

667
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:43,410
So today is the day when one has to determine

668
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:51,356
how far you are a guru, first point.

669
01:24:52,424 --> 01:24:56,174
You have to take a pledge

670
01:24:56,587 --> 01:25:00,337
that you will establish your Guru Principle,

671
01:25:01,801 --> 01:25:04,134
second point.

672
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:08,377
Thirdly, you have to pledge that

673
01:25:09,051 --> 01:25:14,225
you will establish Guru Principles in others.

674
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:43,487
Fourthly, you have to know that there is a little snag,

675
01:25:44,192 --> 01:25:47,441
that your Guru is a Mother.

676
01:25:51,082 --> 01:25:53,677
She’s too kind to be a guru,

677
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:58,186
too mild to be a guru,

678
01:25:59,908 --> 01:26:02,072
and extremely tolerant.

679
01:26:04,395 --> 01:26:07,502
So it is better that you take up this strictness

680
01:26:07,702 --> 01:26:11,063
towards yourself, and look after yourself.

681
01:26:15,662 --> 01:26:19,062
May God bless you.

682
01:26:23,203 --> 01:26:26,098
So you become your own guru.

683
01:26:39,707 --> 01:26:44,041
On every Guru day I have a problem,

684
01:26:45,132 --> 01:26:49,506
and one of the problems is – you may translate, Gregoire,

685
01:26:49,786 --> 01:26:53,078
still a little more, if you don’t mind

686
01:26:58,694 --> 01:27:01,861
– on every Guru Puja day I think I should become

687
01:27:02,064 --> 01:27:05,730
a complete Guru, and at least on one day

688
01:27:05,953 --> 01:27:08,828
I should not be a Mother.

689
01:27:16,368 --> 01:27:21,430
But every time I try these tricks it works against Me!

690
01:27:29,772 --> 01:27:32,605
Last year in India I told them that

691
01:27:32,836 --> 01:27:34,514
“This time I am going to be just Guru,

692
01:27:34,714 --> 01:27:37,193
and you have to only give Me a shawl

693
01:27:37,438 --> 01:27:41,830
and I will not take any sari, and nothing like a Mother.”

694
01:27:49,643 --> 01:27:52,087
And I was very stern with them, and I said,

695
01:27:52,287 --> 01:27:55,904
“At any cost I am not going to take a sari, whatever you may do.”

696
01:28:00,238 --> 01:28:02,738
And they were very unhappy because they had bought

697
01:28:03,018 --> 01:28:04,954
a sari for Me, and they said,

698
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:07,070
“We have also stitched a blouse and a petticoat,

699
01:28:07,331 --> 01:28:10,813
and Mother, You must accept. You are our Mother also.”

700
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:25,363
So I said, “I am going to be very hard like a guru,

701
01:28:25,608 --> 01:28:29,430
and nothing doing, today nothing is going to convince Me.”

702
01:28:38,272 --> 01:28:39,915
Because again you become the Mother,

703
01:28:40,115 --> 01:28:44,157
then the whole thing becomes again that soft business!

704
01:28:49,649 --> 01:28:52,993
[Yogi: Mother, I can’t translate that!]

705
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:55,612
You’d better tell them!

706
01:29:03,867 --> 01:29:10,242
So I went to open the, you see, a tap

707
01:29:10,476 --> 01:29:13,212
– because in India we don’t believe in wash-basins,

708
01:29:13,412 --> 01:29:15,428
you see – to wash My hands.

709
01:29:28,665 --> 01:29:30,871
And Indian taps as they are, you see,

710
01:29:31,071 --> 01:29:35,447
it gave in and I got completely drenched.

711
01:29:41,733 --> 01:29:43,349
And I came out and I said,

712
01:29:43,549 --> 01:29:47,158
“Please give Me the sari to wear!”

713
01:30:01,206 --> 01:30:03,796
Today I had decided to be a real guru,

714
01:30:03,996 --> 01:30:06,913
and a very hard one.

715
01:30:16,754 --> 01:30:18,454
Then Warren came to say that

716
01:30:18,654 --> 01:30:20,681
“Mother, somebody has bought a sari,

717
01:30:20,881 --> 01:30:23,001
and this is that and that is that.”

718
01:30:23,222 --> 01:30:25,830
He gave lots of arguments.

719
01:30:33,562 --> 01:30:37,724
And Rustom and Warren were trying to, you see,

720
01:30:37,924 --> 01:30:40,955
put Me down in My place.

721
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:54,681
But then they used the greatest argument to outwit Me.

722
01:31:00,579 --> 01:31:03,038
First they said, “The sari is beautiful,” this, that

723
01:31:03,257 --> 01:31:05,544
– I was all right then.

724
01:31:08,837 --> 01:31:11,307
But then they said, “The vibrations are too good.

725
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:15,016
Even before opening the sari, the vibrations were there.”

726
01:31:21,961 --> 01:31:25,420
So all My efforts fizzled out!

727
01:31:29,916 --> 01:31:34,916
This is the play of the sweetness of Divine,

728
01:31:41,236 --> 01:31:44,242
what is called as madhurya.

729
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:51,558
“Madhurya” means the sweetness, the sweetness.

730
01:31:52,111 --> 01:31:56,132
And this is the one

731
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:01,749
that’s such a hide-and-seek of joy in life,

732
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,356
and that is what I have accepted.

733
01:32:10,556 --> 01:32:14,440
So first we’ll have the Mother’s Puja.

734
01:33:16,267 --> 01:33:19,965
First is Shri Ganesha and then Gauri Puja today;

735
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:23,795
because of the Guru Puja we’ll have Gauri Puja.

736
01:34:47,988 --> 01:34:50,404
Sahaja Yogi: All those who have never yet washed

737
01:34:50,669 --> 01:34:56,002
the feet of Shri Mataji and who would like to take,

738
01:34:56,453 --> 01:34:57,956
to have this great privilege,

739
01:34:58,212 --> 01:35:02,128
should come forward to do the puja.

740
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:06,875
You’d better like it!

741
01:35:09,099 --> 01:35:12,515
Don’t leave it to their freedom, better like it!

742
01:35:13,135 --> 01:35:16,302
If you leave it to their freedom …

743
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:20,541
And somebody must tell Me their names, you see;

744
01:35:20,833 --> 01:35:22,208
I would like to know their names,

745
01:35:22,499 --> 01:35:25,478
all those who are washing My feet, that would be good.

746
01:39:40,031 --> 01:39:43,795
If you are on the sides, it would be better like this …

747
01:39:57,126 --> 01:39:58,889
It’s all right. Twenty-one names.

748
01:39:59,126 --> 01:40:00,508
Alll right, if you finish that,

749
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:02,634
then they will come down.

750
01:40:05,672 --> 01:40:06,897
You guide them.

751
01:43:41,084 --> 01:43:42,368
Loudly.

752
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:45,708
All right.

753
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,792
Now, let the – you guide the coming here, one by one.

754
01:43:51,084 --> 01:43:52,750
Two of them can come.

755
01:43:53,042 --> 01:43:54,501
From the same country would be better

756
01:43:54,808 --> 01:43:57,451
so they can tell Me their ….

757
01:44:13,536 --> 01:44:14,736
What is your name?

758
01:44:44,033 --> 01:44:45,375
Rub it hard.

759
01:45:21,172 --> 01:45:22,807
All the chakras

760
01:46:23,278 --> 01:46:24,798
Warm water.

761
01:46:36,851 --> 01:46:38,692
be careful about that

762
01:46:40,867 --> 01:46:41,867
be caredul

763
01:46:42,894 --> 01:46:45,610
Just put it that side a little bit, carefully.

764
01:46:47,387 --> 01:46:48,520
Tell me your name

765
01:47:01,464 --> 01:47:02,464

Ask them to rub their hands like this before comming here. all of them.

776
01:50:09,905 --> 01:50:11,172
See the vibrations.

777
01:50:14,067 --> 01:50:15,067
All right?

778
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:34,855
Now, tell me your names.

779
01:50:36,854 --> 01:50:38,021
Loudly

780
01:50:44,351 --> 01:50:45,766
From which country?

781
01:50:52,153 --> 01:50:54,553
Rub it hard. Rub it hard.

782
01:50:56,377 --> 01:50:58,534

806
01:58:20,203 --> 01:58:21,454

Hard. Very hard.

01:58:42,891 --> 01:58:44,091

815
02:01:28,801 --> 02:01:32,468
Hah! All right, that’s it.

816
02:02:11,505 --> 02:02:14,414
May God bless you.

02:02:32,779 --> 02:02:34,530
How many there are still more.

818
02:02:34,730 --> 02:02:36,997
Let's have four and four together.

819
02:02:40,225 --> 02:02:41,863

820
02:02:58,751 --> 02:02:59,757

Hah! Good. All right. Rub My feet.

Rub My feet.

826
02:14:05,192 --> 02:14:07,984
All these names have to do with various qualities

827
02:14:08,275 --> 02:14:09,692
with which He rules the ganas.

828
02:14:10,026 --> 02:14:14,068
The ganas are the soldiers of the left side,

829
02:14:14,442 --> 02:14:16,026
who are the protectors of Lord Shiva

830
02:14:16,317 --> 02:14:18,761
and of the blessed Gauri.

831
02:14:18,961 --> 02:14:20,536
Who get after your bhoots!

832
02:14:20,736 --> 02:14:22,536
Who get after the bhoot!

833
02:14:23,233 --> 02:14:25,633
People should take special interest.

834
02:14:30,609 --> 02:14:33,567
Come along. Come forward, yes. Come forward please.

835
02:14:33,859 --> 02:14:35,784
Now, tell Me the names.

836
02:14:42,484 --> 02:14:46,192
Margaret. Yes, what’s yours?

837
02:14:48,275 --> 02:14:52,550
You’re from? From where? …

838
02:15:00,526 --> 02:15:03,234
Very hard. Rub them very hard, all right?

839
02:15:03,969 --> 02:15:07,163
Rub them hard. Hard, very hard.

840
02:16:03,752 --> 02:16:06,831
Forgive, forgive, forgive

841
02:16:47,702 --> 02:16:48,702
Hah! Now!

842
02:16:53,563 --> 02:16:55,163
Still there.

843
02:16:56,194 --> 02:16:58,936
Now there’ll be no problem.

844
02:17:20,936 --> 02:17:24,519
Now tell Me the names.

845
02:17:28,431 --> 02:17:29,973
Catherine.

846
02:17:30,009 --> 02:17:32,262
From what country?

847
02:18:09,985 --> 02:18:13,235
Now come along, rub My feet.

848
02:18:37,973 --> 02:18:40,831
Rub it hard. Harder, hard.

849
02:19:21,749 --> 02:19:22,958
All right?

850
02:19:38,627 --> 02:19:44,378
Good? May God bless you.

851
02:20:04,714 --> 02:20:06,173
Hah! Better?

852
02:20:36,222 --> 02:20:39,763
… Tell Me your names.

853
02:20:42,109 --> 02:20:46,317
Now, what’s the country you come from?

854
02:20:51,359 --> 02:20:54,317
All right, now you rub My feet.

855
02:20:54,692 --> 02:20:57,651
Both the hands.

856
02:20:58,014 --> 02:21:02,317
Hard; really hard, very hard.

857
02:21:05,026 --> 02:21:06,442
Hard, very hard. Harder. Good.

858
02:21:43,818 --> 02:21:47,109
Aha! May God bless you. Good.

859
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:51,651
See yourself. See your hands.

860
02:21:57,899 --> 02:22:02,524
All right. What about you?

861
02:22:05,728 --> 02:22:09,811
All right. May God bless you.

862
02:22:26,931 --> 02:22:28,639
Maria?

863
02:22:28,503 --> 02:22:30,545
From what country?

864
02:22:32,622 --> 02:22:33,456
France.

865
02:22:38,484 --> 02:22:40,484
You have to tell Me very clearly,

866
02:22:40,818 --> 02:22:42,943
because you are telling the deities, all right?

867
02:22:43,275 --> 02:22:45,901
Now, rub My feet.

868
02:22:46,567 --> 02:22:48,859
Rub My feet hard.

869
02:22:49,192 --> 02:22:53,109
Hard. Very hard.

870
02:23:34,108 --> 02:23:35,400
Tremendous!

871
02:23:45,275 --> 02:23:46,359
Hah! Good. Let Me see.

872
02:23:58,567 --> 02:23:59,776
All right?

873
02:24:46,167 --> 02:24:48,959
Now tell Me your names.

874
02:24:51,609 --> 02:24:54,442
From where?

875
02:24:59,317 --> 02:25:01,400
France.

876
02:25:02,234 --> 02:25:07,901
Again? Again? From France.

877
02:25:08,442 --> 02:25:11,109
You have to tell Me, because My ears have to hear,

878
02:25:11,526 --> 02:25:14,526
so the deities must hear, all right?

879
02:25:14,859 --> 02:25:17,526
Now, please rub My feet.

880
02:25:19,109 --> 02:25:21,859
Hard, hard, hard.

881
02:25:24,237 --> 02:25:25,403
Very hard.

882
02:25:26,859 --> 02:25:30,234
Yes, that’s it. Hard, hard …

883
02:26:18,901 --> 02:26:22,234
Put your hands towards Me.

884
02:26:40,108 --> 02:26:45,026
All right? May God bless you.

885
02:27:03,359 --> 02:27:06,670
Hello, how are you? May God bless you.

886
02:27:06,943 --> 02:27:10,818
How are you now, better? How is the baby?

887
02:27:12,068 --> 02:27:16,192
Now good. Tell Me your names very clearly, loudly.

888
02:27:18,317 --> 02:27:22,901
Sally, from Australia. Say like this.

889
02:27:26,984 --> 02:27:31,234
All right. You’re also from England, originally?

890
02:27:31,609 --> 02:27:34,943
All right, then say that …

891
02:27:44,192 --> 02:27:51,943
All right, rub My feet. Rub My feet hard. Very hard.

892
02:29:30,526 --> 02:29:34,943
Did you go to some false guru?

893
02:29:48,689 --> 02:29:50,109
Hah! Better?

894
02:30:30,901 --> 02:30:32,484
Now you have to tell your names

895
02:30:32,860 --> 02:30:34,985
and the country’s names, all right?

896
02:30:35,192 --> 02:30:39,484
Now, tell your, your name?

897
02:30:44,086 --> 02:30:46,961
From where?

898
02:30:47,514 --> 02:30:49,182
From?

899
02:30:50,234 --> 02:30:51,192
All right.

900
02:30:52,584 --> 02:30:54,292
Come along.

901
02:30:56,244 --> 02:31:00,041
Rub hard, very hard.

902
02:31:41,533 --> 02:31:44,091
See your hands now.

903
02:31:52,359 --> 02:31:56,859
All right? May God bless you.

904
02:32:15,526 --> 02:32:17,234
You have to tell them your name,

905
02:32:17,609 --> 02:32:20,776
and your country’s name.

906
02:32:23,984 --> 02:32:26,442
From Africa?

907
02:32:26,776 --> 02:32:29,692
From India, sorry!

908
02:32:36,275 --> 02:32:39,234
Hard, very hard. Harder.

909
02:32:39,567 --> 02:32:41,984
Very hard. As much as you can.

910
02:32:42,192 --> 02:32:46,651
Harder. Very hard.

911
02:32:46,984 --> 02:32:50,901
Hard, very hard.

912
02:32:52,691 --> 02:32:55,635
Very hard.Very hard.Very hard.

913
02:33:11,150 --> 02:33:15,234
As much as you can.

914
02:34:29,442 --> 02:34:34,609
Come along, how are you?

915
02:34:34,984 --> 02:34:36,984
Wash My feet.

916
02:34:37,317 --> 02:34:40,317
This one here, wash it.

917
02:34:40,651 --> 02:34:43,442
Hello, how are you? … How are you?

918
02:34:53,692 --> 02:34:58,068
I must see you. How long are you going to be here?

919
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:00,859
All right, come along.

920
02:35:01,108 --> 02:35:03,192
Take plenty of time, all right?

921
02:35:05,901 --> 02:35:07,692
Good, good, good.

922
02:35:07,917 --> 02:35:10,460
Now see, just see the vibrations.

923
02:35:30,026 --> 02:35:33,073
See how are your hands.

924
02:35:47,859 --> 02:35:50,526
Ah, all right?

925
02:35:51,109 --> 02:35:54,150
Good. Sister has got it.

926
02:35:54,526 --> 02:35:58,984
Now, she has got it. He has got it.

927
02:36:03,859 --> 02:36:05,400
May God bless you all.

928
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:09,068
May God bless you.

929
02:36:09,484 --> 02:36:12,484
May God bless you.

930
02:36:26,901 --> 02:36:30,943
That’s good. Now, you tell Me your name,

931
02:36:31,192 --> 02:36:34,609
and also the country you are from. Tell Me.

932
02:36:38,317 --> 02:36:39,651
All right.

933
02:36:39,943 --> 02:36:44,109
Rub it hard, very hard.

934
02:36:44,442 --> 02:36:47,026
Very hard.

935
02:37:37,859 --> 02:37:39,192
All right?

936
02:37:39,458 --> 02:37:41,416
Good.

937
02:37:57,068 --> 02:37:59,859
Now put your hands towards Me.

938
02:38:09,275 --> 02:38:11,442
All right?

939
02:38:17,943 --> 02:38:20,567
Great! May God bless you.

940
02:38:43,438 --> 02:38:46,639
Tell your name and where you are coming from.

941
02:38:46,814 --> 02:38:47,814
Loudly.

942
02:39:00,656 --> 02:39:03,300
Rub it hard, very hard.

943
02:39:22,661 --> 02:39:24,342
Let him play.

944
02:39:51,016 --> 02:39:52,471
It is good.

945
02:42:39,363 --> 02:42:40,630
May God bless you.

946
02:42:41,006 --> 02:42:42,456
Now you have become gurus, all right?

947
02:42:42,826 --> 02:42:45,293
You have become gurus, remember that!

948
02:42:45,515 --> 02:42:46,515
Come along.

949
02:42:46,778 --> 02:42:51,288
If anyone has a newly born child, who has not yet met Mataji,

950
02:42:51,428 --> 02:42:56,275
Shri Mataji would ... her at the end of the feet washing.

951
02:42:57,822 --> 02:43:00,202
All have been to me

952
02:43:18,383 --> 02:43:20,841
You have to tell the deities.

953
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:24,016
I know you, the deities must know you too.

954
02:43:24,720 --> 02:43:25,720
All right

955
02:43:27,133 --> 02:43:29,133
I am happy if you rub it hard. Hard. Hard. Hard.

956
02:46:55,643 --> 02:46:57,184
Come along. They have washed My feet,

957
02:46:57,518 --> 02:46:58,809
but I’ll have to bless the child.

958
02:46:59,142 --> 02:47:02,518
Ah, so what’s the name?

959
02:47:05,768 --> 02:47:08,601
Ah, look at the eyes, ah? That’s the sign.

960
02:47:08,912 --> 02:47:12,037
That’s Me, you see, the eyes are Me, can’t you see?

961
02:47:12,351 --> 02:47:14,601
Can I have a little water?

962
02:47:15,184 --> 02:47:17,518
So what’s the name?

963
02:47:18,351 --> 02:47:19,809
James, eh?

964
02:47:20,100 --> 02:47:23,351
Will You give him another name?

965
02:48:05,808 --> 02:48:14,768
You could call him Ewan. Ewan, for English, all right?

966
02:48:15,184 --> 02:48:18,559
And for the Indian name …

967
02:48:39,309 --> 02:48:40,392
Gyanadev.

968
02:48:45,267 --> 02:48:48,226
He smiled, he smiled!

969
02:48:50,267 --> 02:48:54,768
You are smiling, Gyanadeva – Gyaneshwara.

970
02:49:00,726 --> 02:49:02,518
May God bless you.

971
02:49:03,850 --> 02:49:07,184
He’s smiling, see – so very happy!

972
02:49:15,850 --> 02:49:20,226
All right. Can you wipe My feet?

973
02:54:24,267 --> 02:54:27,392
Now, you give it all there, give it all.

974
02:54:33,142 --> 02:54:35,809
That’s all. You don’t use milk.

975
02:54:36,434 --> 02:54:39,559
You can add it later, milk.

976
02:54:45,518 --> 02:54:50,601
Sadkara. Sadkara. Sadkara.

977
02:57:50,434 --> 02:57:54,097
Now say the mantra of “Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu …” three times.

978
02:59:19,934 --> 02:59:23,434
Give Me the towel.

979
02:59:36,184 --> 02:59:38,059
Very slowly, you should let down the air

980
02:59:38,434 --> 02:59:39,892
very slowly, all right?

981
02:59:40,184 --> 02:59:43,267
Now can it be put down, so that they can do it.

982
02:59:43,601 --> 02:59:47,017
Danielle, come. Take this down. Come along.

983
02:59:50,142 --> 02:59:51,850
Danielle is going to help you.

984
02:59:52,184 --> 02:59:55,184
You put the mark in, all right?

985
03:01:11,476 --> 03:01:12,768
Thank you very much.

986
03:01:13,017 --> 03:01:14,559
You all have to put something there.

987
03:01:14,892 --> 03:01:18,809
Come along! Thank you. Come down, come down.
