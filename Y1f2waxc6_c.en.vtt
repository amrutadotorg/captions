00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.657
Tonight we have
gathered here

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:10.906
to do the Puja to
the Devi,

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.782
that is Mahakali
- we can call Her

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:18.490
or Durga.

00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:23.324
So many types of
forms She has taken,

00:00:23.616 --> 00:00:25.782
to kill

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.824
the negative forces that
are trying to trouble

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.657
or to obstruct,

00:00:34.906 --> 00:00:38.824
or even to grow

00:00:39.032 --> 00:00:43.699
the people who were

00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:48.365
gentle and good.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.741
Her forms are of
different types

00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:57.824
that we know about,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.407
that She destroyed
so many rakshasas,

00:01:02.657 --> 00:01:06.073
She destroyed so
many evildoers.

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:08.657
Also we do not know

00:01:08.906 --> 00:01:12.532
that, in the World
Wars that we had,

00:01:12.782 --> 00:01:18.324
She was there to protect
the right type of people.

00:01:18.574 --> 00:01:21.866
And that’s how
they all survived

00:01:22.032 --> 00:01:25.906
the ill-blood plan,

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:30.157
ill-gotten plan
of very cruel

00:01:30.407 --> 00:01:33.449
and evil people.

00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:38.741
The evil people have
a capacity to hate.

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:44.741
And to express their hate in
every way that is possible.

00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:52.948
They are really born evil and
there are also who ‘become’ evil.

00:01:53.574 --> 00:01:57.490
When they are

00:01:58.532 --> 00:02:03.324
born evil, you can
make them out.

00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:07.616
That their whole style
is so aggressive,

00:02:07.866 --> 00:02:12.198
and so vindictive

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.157
about things.

00:02:14.407 --> 00:02:18.240
But hatred has no limit,

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.365
no limits at all.
Because, if they hate,

00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:26.990
if they hate someone,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.824
then, just to justify that hatred,
they’ll say all kinds of things.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.407
Just to justify. But sometimes
they don’t even want to justify.

00:02:39.657 --> 00:02:41.741
They just feel that
they ‘hate’

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:45.741
and it’s a fundamental right
they have got to hate.

00:02:45.948 --> 00:02:51.365
But these forces join
together sometimes to form

00:02:51.574 --> 00:02:56.824
to form a joint
personality of evil,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:02.240
which tries to torture the
human beings and trouble them.

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:07.699
They might take any name. They
might call them by anything,

00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:13.324
but they are absolutely
hundred per cent evil.

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:15.741
and for such persons

00:03:15.906 --> 00:03:24.157
there’s no pity or compassion
from the God Almighty.

00:03:24.407 --> 00:03:26.782
These are to be
destroyed.

00:03:26.948 --> 00:03:29.490
And that is the job
of the Goddess

00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:35.907
to destroy them, who is a Mother,
full of compassion and love.

00:03:36.574 --> 00:03:41.115
It’s a very contradictory
work the Goddess has to do

00:03:41.365 --> 00:03:46.741
to kill these people, because, in
the larger interest, it is important

00:03:46.948 --> 00:03:54.407
that all such evil people
should be destroyed, completely.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.365
But they do not.

00:03:57.657 --> 00:04:01.449
They, like they go to jail for
some time. Like that, they

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.782
go to hell for some
time, suffer

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.699
and, again, they come
back much more strong

00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:12.490
and then again try to trouble
good saintly people.

00:04:12.741 --> 00:04:15.616
It’s a common style

00:04:15.824 --> 00:04:22.073
they are all over the world.
They can come in the form

00:04:22.365 --> 00:04:24.532
of a very good man,

00:04:24.741 --> 00:04:29.407
of a very gentle man, or of a
man who “knows a lot about God”

00:04:29.616 --> 00:04:33.741
or they can also say
that they can

00:04:34.032 --> 00:04:36.532
give you Realisation.

00:04:36.906 --> 00:04:40.365
All kinds of lies
they are capable of,

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:46.157
because they have that power
evil, power of doing evil.

00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:49.449
So they take to all
kinds of falsehood

00:04:49.657 --> 00:04:53.407
and they proclaim that:
“We are this and we are that,”

00:04:53.657 --> 00:04:58.115
and “ We can give
you this or that.”

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:03.115
Actually, they have come on
this Earth to ruin people.

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:06.532
We’ve had many of
these false people

00:05:06.782 --> 00:05:10.032
and many stupid
people followed them.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.324
They never talked
against each other.

00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:17.574
Christ has said that,

00:05:18.032 --> 00:05:21.574
“The devil won’t talk
against its own house.”

00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:26.073
As if they are in ‘one’ house.
And in ‘one’ house they live

00:05:26.324 --> 00:05:28.157
and they cannot talk,

00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:34.324
they cannot talk
of something

00:05:34.574 --> 00:05:38.782
that may disturb their
collectivity or their fraternity.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.574
The fraternity is so
great that,

00:05:42.782 --> 00:05:45.699
wherever they are,
they ‘know’

00:05:45.948 --> 00:05:50.741
that they are together.
Just imagine.

00:05:50.948 --> 00:05:53.906
all the evil people
should join together

00:05:54.115 --> 00:05:58.324
and behave in this manner
is very surprising.

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.699
That way, they are
very collective.

00:06:00.907 --> 00:06:06.490
Supposing one has taken a
particular part of the land,

00:06:06.782 --> 00:06:10.157
then he dominates there. Another
takes up in another way.

00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:13.532
Third one takes. There’s
no competition as such.

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:17.365
Ultimate effort is, somehow
or other,

00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:21.824
to destroy all the
creation of God,

00:06:22.032 --> 00:06:24.073
all the good people
of the world,

00:06:24.282 --> 00:06:29.948
who will ultimately get
their Self-Realisation

00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:36.032
and who will have the
Knowledge about Reality.

00:06:36.907 --> 00:06:43.157
This kind of atmosphere is
the worst during Kali Yuga

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:46.741
and there are so many
stupid, stupid people,

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.948
who may be simple, who
may be good-natured,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.198
but they get drawn by the
evil doing of these people,

00:06:55.574 --> 00:06:59.616
while the good people
also sometimes

00:06:59.866 --> 00:07:04.157
follow suite. They also try to
follow them. It’s very surprising.

00:07:04.407 --> 00:07:08.907
Why should good people not under-
stand what is good and what is bad?

00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:12.407
But, that discrimination,
many good people also lack

00:07:12.657 --> 00:07:15.532
and that’s why they
take to wrong things.

00:07:15.782 --> 00:07:18.741
And then they go on
justifying all the time

00:07:18.907 --> 00:07:21.449
whatever they are doing
is the right thing,

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:25.990
is the best thing, they
have the proof of it.

00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:31.990
Now, as you know, there has
been many of them in Kali Yuga

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.782
and so many of them have now
disappeared from this Earth

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:43.657
and now they cannot trouble us.
But there are still some more,

00:07:43.948 --> 00:07:45.948
who are exposed.

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:50.157
People have exposed
them so much

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:53.407
that nobody can expose

00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:57.824
anybody without any proof.

00:07:58.032 --> 00:08:00.073
But they have such courage

00:08:00.282 --> 00:08:04.282
and they are so
full of confidence

00:08:04.532 --> 00:08:07.824
that they can do
what they like,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.490
and anybody tries
to expose them,

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:14.574
they will definitely
ruin that person.

00:08:14.906 --> 00:08:17.032
A few things they
are doing.

00:08:17.282 --> 00:08:21.741
First of all, they put wrong
ideas into your head.

00:08:22.032 --> 00:08:25.032
They say that:
"We are very

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.574
great people we are this, we
are that. God has sent us."

00:08:28.782 --> 00:08:30.574
All sorts of things they will talk.

00:08:30.824 --> 00:08:33.365
But there is no proof
about it.

00:08:33.574 --> 00:08:36.699
And human beings never
ask for the proof,

00:08:36.906 --> 00:08:39.365
as to: “How do you say?

00:08:39.574 --> 00:08:41.574
What is the proof? ”

00:08:41.866 --> 00:08:44.907
So the solution is
the Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:45.198 --> 00:08:50.198
In Sahaja Yoga, you have
the experience. You have the proof.

00:08:50.449 --> 00:08:53.365
Then you grow into it.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:57.616
Immediately you cannot be a great
Sahaja Yogi, that’s a fact.

00:08:57.866 --> 00:08:59.948
You have to mature.

00:09:00.198 --> 00:09:02.365
It takes some time
for some people.

00:09:02.574 --> 00:09:05.824
It takes some more time for
other people. It doesn’t matter.

00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:07.990
But you do mature.

00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:11.782
In the meanwhile, if you try
to go to these wrong people,

00:09:11.948 --> 00:09:14.365
then there is
no possibility,

00:09:14.657 --> 00:09:18.157
there’s no way of
again bringing you up.

00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:21.866
Especially those people who rise
high in Sahaja Yoga, I think.

00:09:22.032 --> 00:09:25.824
If they fall,
they fall so low.

00:09:26.073 --> 00:09:28.907
Then even an ordinary
Sahaja Yogi

00:09:29.115 --> 00:09:32.407
could say: “ Mother, look at him!
Where has he gone?”

00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:36.699
So, with all these
things happening,

00:09:37.907 --> 00:09:42.073
what is our job

00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:45.866
is to worship
Mahakali within us.

00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:50.782
Because, what does She do?
Perhaps we are not very aware of.

00:09:51.157 --> 00:09:56.115
First and foremost thing
She does is to protect us.

00:09:56.365 --> 00:10:00.574
Wherever you may be,
whatever you may be doing,

00:10:00.782 --> 00:10:03.782
in whatever peril you
may be,

00:10:04.032 --> 00:10:08.157
howsoever dangerously you
may be placed in life,

00:10:08.407 --> 00:10:12.407
She protects you. First
thing, She protects you.

00:10:12.657 --> 00:10:16.073
All the people who write to
Me, how they were protected,

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:19.616
how they were cured,
how they were helped.

00:10:19.866 --> 00:10:22.449
It’s this thing: that
they should know

00:10:22.657 --> 00:10:28.157
that all this has happened because
of Mahakali power within you.

00:10:28.532 --> 00:10:30.782
She exists within you.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.906
When you are
worshipping Mahakali,

00:10:33.073 --> 00:10:35.490
you are worshipping the
Mahakali ‘within you’.

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:37.699
With due respect,
you must know

00:10:37.906 --> 00:10:41.324
that this Mahakali is a
very sensitive personality.

00:10:41.616 --> 00:10:43.906
She is very sensitive.

00:10:44.157 --> 00:10:48.741
If you try to do any
wrong to anyone,

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:52.782
She’ll guide you. She’ll tell
you by many ways

00:10:52.948 --> 00:10:54.324
that: "This is wrong what
you are doing.

00:10:54.532 --> 00:10:57.324
Why are you doing wrong
to some person?”

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.699
But if you do not repent

00:10:59.906 --> 00:11:04.282
and come back onto the normal
position, She gives you up.

00:11:04.866 --> 00:11:09.365
Once Mahakali gives you
up, you are now exposed

00:11:09.616 --> 00:11:13.741
and become prone to all
kinds of evil things.

00:11:13.948 --> 00:11:16.407
I would say…

00:11:19.574 --> 00:11:22.699
“What’s the matter
with the baby?”

00:11:44.532 --> 00:11:47.115
So, when you worship
Her, what do you want?

00:11:47.324 --> 00:11:52.616
You want Her to protect you.
In your discrimination,

00:11:52.906 --> 00:11:57.324
in your mistake, you might
do something wrong.

00:11:57.574 --> 00:12:01.699
May do something that
is not good for you,

00:12:01.907 --> 00:12:04.782
could be very dangerous
for you.

00:12:05.032 --> 00:12:08.115
But She is the person
who guides

00:12:08.324 --> 00:12:10.490
how to avoid all
the dangers.

00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:15.407
Now, She protects
your life,

00:12:15.657 --> 00:12:17.657
She protects your body,

00:12:17.906 --> 00:12:20.906
She protects all organs
of your body,

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:26.157
She is the One who gives you
all the security of life.

00:12:27.157 --> 00:12:32.532
In Her realm, you feel
completely secure.

00:12:32.824 --> 00:12:35.574
You are never afraid
of anything.

00:12:35.824 --> 00:12:39.532
Because you have left Her
realm, you have come out of it,

00:12:39.741 --> 00:12:42.824
that is why, that is the
reason you are afraid.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:47.824
But if you are under
Her beautiful

00:12:48.032 --> 00:12:50.866
guidance and Her
blessings,

00:12:51.073 --> 00:12:54.324
you will never feel
afraid to do anything.

00:12:54.741 --> 00:12:57.073
You will never do
anything wrong also.

00:12:57.282 --> 00:13:01.115
As soon as you’ll try to do
wrong, She will hold your hand.

00:13:01.407 --> 00:13:03.907
She is really the
guiding person.

00:13:04.157 --> 00:13:08.157
She is the One who actually
gives us our existence.

00:13:08.449 --> 00:13:13.032
Without Her, we
cannot exist, because

00:13:13.449 --> 00:13:20.866
She is the One who is
the Power of Shri Shiva.

00:13:23.157 --> 00:13:27.282
She gives us so many things.
For example,

00:13:27.532 --> 00:13:33.824
She gives us the
relaxation, the sleep.

00:13:34.157 --> 00:13:36.449
She gives you the Truth.

00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:39.532
She tells you what is the
Truth and what is not.

00:13:39.782 --> 00:13:41.157
Sometimes people

00:13:41.407 --> 00:13:44.782
so much in their ego
always try to believe that:

00:13:44.948 --> 00:13:46.657
“What I think is
the truth.”

00:13:46.866 --> 00:13:52.948
Then She is the One who points
it out by creating a ‘Maya’,

00:13:53.198 --> 00:13:57.198
a kind of a confusion,

00:13:57.532 --> 00:14:00.906
that you start thinking:
“What is this?”

00:14:01.115 --> 00:14:06.532
So She is called also the One who
gives us ‘Bhranti,’ means illusions.

00:14:06.782 --> 00:14:09.990
She puts you to illusions
also. She tells you

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.782
puts you to illusions
and She

00:14:12.948 --> 00:14:16.532
then ultimately takes you
out of the illusions.

00:14:17.198 --> 00:14:19.365
She is the One who
relaxes you,

00:14:19.616 --> 00:14:22.948
because She takes over all
your responsibilities.

00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:25.407
She takes over all
your problems.

00:14:25.657 --> 00:14:27.866
She is the One who
solves all the problems.

00:14:28.032 --> 00:14:32.407
It is we who forget to leave
all the problems to Her.

00:14:32.657 --> 00:14:37.616
If you just leave problems to Her,
all your problems are solved.

00:14:37.866 --> 00:14:41.616
Not only that, but you
really feel blessed.

00:14:41.906 --> 00:14:46.073
It’s not only physical,
also it is mental

00:14:46.324 --> 00:14:50.741
that She makes your mind
absolutely free of worries.

00:14:50.948 --> 00:14:55.490
She doesn’t worry and She
doesn’t want you to worry.

00:14:55.741 --> 00:14:58.574
If you worry, then
She tries to show that,

00:14:58.782 --> 00:15:01.990
by your worry,
you are denying Her.

00:15:02.324 --> 00:15:04.616
You are not accepting Her.

00:15:04.906 --> 00:15:07.032
Worrying is something
very common

00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:08.948
and people take great
pride in saying:

00:15:09.198 --> 00:15:10.449
“Oh, I was worried.”

00:15:10.657 --> 00:15:15.449
How can you be worried when your
Mother is “Sakshat Mahakali”.

00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:19.407
She can kill all the demons.
She can finish all of them.

00:15:19.657 --> 00:15:21.365
She knows how
to manage things.

00:15:21.616 --> 00:15:24.657
And when you are like
a child before Her,

00:15:24.906 --> 00:15:27.240
how can you worry
about anything?

00:15:27.449 --> 00:15:30.032
So your worries
are finished.

00:15:30.324 --> 00:15:33.324
She worries about you, you
shouldn’t worry about yourself.

00:15:33.574 --> 00:15:38.240
That’s the point of it. Her
security is so great,

00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:41.616
She is so secure
Herself, that

00:15:41.824 --> 00:15:45.866
She gives you all the
security that you need.

00:15:46.115 --> 00:15:48.699
You can hold on
to Her feet.

00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:53.157
You can hold on to Her
image or to anything.

00:15:53.449 --> 00:15:55.324
You can even pray to Her.

00:15:55.532 --> 00:15:59.616
Many people are being cured
only by praying to Her.

00:15:59.866 --> 00:16:01.824
Because She cures you.

00:16:02.073 --> 00:16:03.990
She can cure your
diseases,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.906
which are very complicated
diseases. She can cure.

00:16:08.282 --> 00:16:13.157
Now what She likes ?
Mahakali likes the light.

00:16:13.699 --> 00:16:17.866
She is worshipped in the night,
because then we can put on the light.

00:16:18.365 --> 00:16:21.198
She likes enlightened
persons.

00:16:21.407 --> 00:16:25.906
Also She likes the light.
She likes the Sun. She likes,

00:16:26.073 --> 00:16:31.574
something that will be completely
enlightened and brightened.

00:16:32.532 --> 00:16:36.948
You must have heard about people
who are called… I don’t know what,

00:16:37.198 --> 00:16:41.407
but especially in the
West they use them.

00:16:41.657 --> 00:16:46.157
They have big teeth
and they

00:16:46.782 --> 00:16:48.948
somebody from the audience
shouts: “vampires.”

00:16:49.198 --> 00:16:52.906
And they are the people,
they just imagine,

00:16:53.073 --> 00:16:57.073
they cannot exist
before the Sun.

00:16:57.282 --> 00:17:03.073
As soon as there is a sunrise,
they just want to go off and sleep.

00:17:03.324 --> 00:17:08.365
Yes, they cannot see the Sun,
because, the light, they can’t bear.

00:17:08.657 --> 00:17:13.032
Now, what has happened here,
that Mahalakshmi, has departed.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:16.407
Mahakali has departed
from them.

00:17:16.741 --> 00:17:21.616
And when Mahakali has departed,
then they are afraid.

00:17:21.866 --> 00:17:26.115
And such people are
attacked by these people

00:17:26.407 --> 00:17:29.032
who know they are afraid.

00:17:29.324 --> 00:17:33.574
The Sun itself is
very important,

00:17:33.824 --> 00:17:36.490
to work out this
Mahakali thing.

00:17:36.741 --> 00:17:40.324
But, as it is, in the
West especially,

00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:44.115
we are very hard-working

00:17:44.365 --> 00:17:48.990
and very much Sun-oriented
and we worship the Sun.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.574
All this we do,
worship the Sun

00:17:53.824 --> 00:17:56.948
and also go right-sided
very much.

00:17:57.198 --> 00:17:59.782
Then it is She who
gives us the balance.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:03.365
She is the One who
gives us the balance,

00:18:03.616 --> 00:18:08.282
by relaxing us completely
and protecting us.

00:18:08.532 --> 00:18:13.906
Sometimes we are competitive
and we are really worried

00:18:14.073 --> 00:18:18.574
and we want to do something
which we cannot do.

00:18:18.948 --> 00:18:22.407
Then we get upset

00:18:22.616 --> 00:18:24.574
and we don’t know
what to do.

00:18:24.824 --> 00:18:29.616
Then it is She who
brings sleep to us.

00:18:29.824 --> 00:18:34.616
So, when we sleep, She looks
after us, She soothes us

00:18:34.866 --> 00:18:37.657
and She takes away
our problems.

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:39.866
So many things
She is doing.

00:18:40.032 --> 00:18:43.616
But what are we doing for Her?
That we should see.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.198
Main thing is,

00:18:46.574 --> 00:18:52.574
that we are ourselves
worshipping Her.

00:18:53.741 --> 00:18:58.824
She likes it that Her
children should worship Her,

00:18:59.157 --> 00:19:02.699
that, on that level, She
can be One with them.

00:19:02.906 --> 00:19:07.906
She can give them Her
compassion, love and protection

00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:10.449
from all the evil.

00:19:10.657 --> 00:19:14.948
But it has to be
understood, those who are

00:19:15.198 --> 00:19:20.115
not yet settled, those
who are not absolutelly

00:19:20.365 --> 00:19:26.616
belonging to that land
of security of Mahakali,

00:19:26.906 --> 00:19:28.824
can be attacked.

00:19:29.032 --> 00:19:35.574
And they… once they leave that
area, they can be very badly

00:19:36.449 --> 00:19:40.324
injured, killed, whatever
way can happen.

00:19:40.532 --> 00:19:42.782
So, we are living in
this Kali Yuga

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:48.741
in very dangerous times.

00:19:48.907 --> 00:19:51.073
Whence anything
can happen.

00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:54.115
So we have to be
very careful.

00:19:54.365 --> 00:19:58.657
We have to watch our mind,
to see how it works.

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:02.365
What does it teach you?
What does it tell you?

00:20:02.616 --> 00:20:04.198
Try to understand

00:20:04.449 --> 00:20:10.449
what is the plan of
this evil person,

00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:13.907
that you are playing
into his hands?

00:20:14.157 --> 00:20:16.407
How can you play
into his hands

00:20:16.616 --> 00:20:20.866
and how can you do whatever
wrong he wants you to do?

00:20:21.198 --> 00:20:24.616
Secondly, against
Her is the ego.

00:20:24.866 --> 00:20:28.365
The biggest problem
is the ego today.

00:20:28.741 --> 00:20:31.699
Ego will show:
“No, no, I can do this.”

00:20:31.906 --> 00:20:35.365
Ego says:
“I will work it out.”

00:20:35.824 --> 00:20:38.574
Ego says:
“It will be done.”

00:20:38.824 --> 00:20:43.324
But the human beings –
see – yield to ego.

00:20:43.574 --> 00:20:48.407
It’s of a great satisfaction to
them that their ego is so strong.

00:20:48.657 --> 00:20:54.073
and they don’t want to listen
to the Mahakali forces.

00:20:56.032 --> 00:20:59.240
Take the boy (Anant)
outside.

00:21:03.032 --> 00:21:06.073
He wants Me, you see.
Children are like that.

00:21:06.282 --> 00:21:09.906
They can’t leave
you for even…

00:21:15.115 --> 00:21:19.282
You have to be like children.
Really, that’s the very best way,

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:23.906
is to be innocent like children.
She loves innocent people.

00:21:24.157 --> 00:21:27.948
She is Innocence Herself.
She loves innocent people

00:21:28.157 --> 00:21:30.616
and She looks after
you much more

00:21:30.824 --> 00:21:33.240
because you are innocent.
You are not cunning.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.198
You are not very much...

00:21:38.449 --> 00:21:43.198
trying to play your
ego on others.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.490
If you are innocent,
She’ll help you.

00:21:46.741 --> 00:21:48.906
She definitely will
help you.

00:21:49.115 --> 00:21:52.657
But this ego has to be
brought under control,

00:21:52.906 --> 00:21:56.741
because he is
the worst enemy

00:21:56.948 --> 00:21:59.990
She has. She doesn’t
like your ego.

00:22:00.198 --> 00:22:03.365
She wants you to be
ego-less, to be innocent.

00:22:03.574 --> 00:22:09.990
As you know that it is, first She
came and She created Shri Ganesha

00:22:10.365 --> 00:22:13.741
That’s why we worship
Shri Ganesha.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.906
We have to be innocent.

00:22:16.115 --> 00:22:20.407
Means: we are not
planning to do something

00:22:20.657 --> 00:22:25.490
bad or good or anything, but
we are without any intentions.

00:22:25.699 --> 00:22:33.574
We are just…It’s
a timeless activity.

00:22:33.782 --> 00:22:36.782
You just don’t bother about
what you are going to do,

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:39.699
what you are not going to do,
what you should do.

00:22:39.906 --> 00:22:41.282
Nothing of the kind!

00:22:41.532 --> 00:22:46.073
You are just existing
in your complete innocence

00:22:46.324 --> 00:22:49.948
and enjoying yourself and
making others enjoy.

00:22:50.157 --> 00:22:54.407
If there’s one child in the house,
he can make hundred people dance.

00:22:54.657 --> 00:23:00.490
It’s like that. Because these
children have the power of innocence.

00:23:00.741 --> 00:23:06.157
and that is what She respects.
We sometimes feel that,

00:23:07.032 --> 00:23:09.866
how people are cheats.
How they cheat us!

00:23:10.032 --> 00:23:14.365
How they make
all kinds of,

00:23:15.115 --> 00:23:20.198
I should say - aggressiveness!
Sometimes, how they try to

00:23:20.449 --> 00:23:22.282
also tell lies!

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.115
All kinds of things
they will do

00:23:25.365 --> 00:23:28.115
and they expect so
much from you also.

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:33.198
But all this is
happening… is happening.

00:23:33.449 --> 00:23:35.282
You shouldn’t bother
about these things.

00:23:35.532 --> 00:23:37.490
You should keep
to your innocence

00:23:37.699 --> 00:23:42.073
and, you’ll be surprised,
you’ll be completely protected.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:47.948
How? Because Mahakali
will stand around you.

00:23:48.157 --> 00:23:52.157
She will look after you,
if you are innocent.

00:23:52.449 --> 00:23:56.990
Innocent person doesn’t get angry.
What is there to get angry?

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:02.240
Innocence has its
own, I should say,

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:07.282
strength, power. It’s
extremely powerful.

00:24:07.532 --> 00:24:10.906
Even a cruel man,
if he sees a child,

00:24:11.115 --> 00:24:14.699
he becomes a little bit aware
of it: “There’s a child.”

00:24:14.906 --> 00:24:18.574
The whole world is aware
that children should not be

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:21.407
any way tortured
or troubled. Why?

00:24:21.699 --> 00:24:27.449
Because children are so innocent.
So the quality of innocence

00:24:27.699 --> 00:24:30.657
is going to really
help you very much,

00:24:30.906 --> 00:24:36.574
because She appreciates
your quality of innocence.

00:24:37.407 --> 00:24:41.866
Then another thing She loves
in you is your compassion.

00:24:42.115 --> 00:24:45.906
Compassion for each other.
Love for each other.

00:24:46.115 --> 00:24:51.282
Also caring for others. That
is something She loves.

00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:54.616
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if
you are a Realised Soul,

00:24:54.906 --> 00:24:56.157
She is always with you.

00:24:56.407 --> 00:25:01.324
But She says: “What are you
doing with your compassion?

00:25:01.574 --> 00:25:03.906
How many people you are
giving Realisation?

00:25:04.115 --> 00:25:08.073
How many people
you are curing?

00:25:08.365 --> 00:25:10.282
How many people
you are helping?

00:25:10.574 --> 00:25:13.824
She is quite aware of
whatever you are doing.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:18.490
I should say, it’s such a
tremendous power of Mahakali

00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:21.824
that She knows
everything about you.

00:25:22.032 --> 00:25:24.449
Everything! She knows
your mind.

00:25:24.699 --> 00:25:26.407
She knows about
your heart.

00:25:26.699 --> 00:25:28.490
She knows about
your health.

00:25:28.741 --> 00:25:32.906
Everything  She knows.
Actually, She is the Mother,

00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:37.866
in every way, who cares
for the little child.

00:25:38.115 --> 00:25:41.782
In that way, She knows that
this child doesn’t do anything.

00:25:42.032 --> 00:25:43.240
He’s very innocent.

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.906
So, like, when you are very small,
your mother looks after you.

00:25:48.073 --> 00:25:51.906
In the same way, this
Mahakali looks after you.

00:25:52.157 --> 00:25:56.866
Then the Mahasaraswati
power comes in and She

00:25:57.282 --> 00:26:00.198
educates you.
She gives you

00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:04.948
other ideas of knowledge…
this, that.

00:26:05.198 --> 00:26:08.866
But, looking after
the child in you,

00:26:09.032 --> 00:26:13.490
looking after your innocence
and your compassion,

00:26:13.741 --> 00:26:16.365
is all done by this
Mahakali power.

00:26:16.574 --> 00:26:20.948
So, She is extremely sensitive
about Her children.

00:26:21.365 --> 00:26:23.699
Nobody dare touch
Her children!

00:26:23.906 --> 00:26:27.157
For Her, everybody
is like a child.

00:26:27.407 --> 00:26:31.365
Those who are Realised Souls
especially, She thinks are children

00:26:31.616 --> 00:26:34.073
and in no way they
should be hurt.

00:26:34.282 --> 00:26:37.866
Nothing should happen to them.
She is always following them.

00:26:38.032 --> 00:26:41.407
One can say: “If She is a ‘person’,
how does She follow them?”

00:26:41.657 --> 00:26:46.324
Because She is
‘omnipresent’.

00:26:46.657 --> 00:26:49.115
She is present
everywhere.

00:26:49.365 --> 00:26:52.824
Everywhere in your
life She is there.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.699
Especially with Sahaja Yogis,
She follows them up and down.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.240
Everywhere,

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.032
whatever you are doing.
You are in an accident

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.198
She is there to save you.

00:27:03.407 --> 00:27:08.198
She is like an angel behind you
and nothing can happen to you,

00:27:08.407 --> 00:27:11.948
if you really worship Her
from your full heart.

00:27:12.198 --> 00:27:16.948
Not for any gain, not
for any achievement,

00:27:17.157 --> 00:27:20.657
but for Her blessings.

00:27:20.948 --> 00:27:22.906
Her blessings are
very great

00:27:23.115 --> 00:27:27.699
and they really have
enriched human beings.

00:27:27.906 --> 00:27:31.907
They have enriched this Earth.
They have enriched everything,

00:27:32.157 --> 00:27:36.157
because of the
blessings of Mahakali.

00:27:36.866 --> 00:27:39.240
Of course, then, there
comes the Mahalakshmi.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.824
Her thing is that,

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:46.407
in Mahalakshmi principle, you
become ‘sort of detached’.

00:27:46.699 --> 00:27:51.240
You start finding that:
“What is this world after all?”

00:27:51.490 --> 00:27:53.906
and a kind of a feeling

00:27:54.115 --> 00:27:59.240
of detachment comes into you
and you start thinking

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.824
that there must be something better,
there must be truth beyond.

00:28:04.073 --> 00:28:07.490
Especially people who have
been tortured by bad people

00:28:07.741 --> 00:28:08.990
always think like that.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.741
That: “There must be someone
who will raise us from this.”

00:28:13.948 --> 00:28:17.157
Here comes the Mahalakshmi
principle in you

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:20.449
which is the principle
of the Goddess

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:25.115
of ‘Ascent’.

00:28:25.365 --> 00:28:30.198
She puts the ideas in your
head that: “What is next?

00:28:30.407 --> 00:28:35.490
What do we have to do? After all,
is this the end of our life?

00:28:35.741 --> 00:28:39.574
What is the purpose of our life?
Why have we come on this Earth?

00:28:39.824 --> 00:28:43.948
What is so special that we
should live on this Earth?”

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.115
All such fundamental
questions start rising

00:28:47.365 --> 00:28:51.741
and then he just takes
to the seeking.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.449
In that also, you
have to understand

00:28:54.657 --> 00:28:57.907
the Mahalakshmi principle
is very, very,

00:28:58.157 --> 00:29:01.866
very different from what
people understand.

00:29:02.741 --> 00:29:04.532
They think -if
they are seeking,

00:29:04.782 --> 00:29:06.407
it should be intelligible,

00:29:06.616 --> 00:29:08.574
it should be through
their mindsall this…

00:29:08.782 --> 00:29:10.990
or could be rational

00:29:11.198 --> 00:29:13.365
or scientific.

00:29:13.574 --> 00:29:17.657
That’s how they move,
seeking the truth.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:20.324
It’s not possible!

00:29:20.741 --> 00:29:23.073
Mahalakshmi’s principle
is like this:

00:29:23.282 --> 00:29:25.866
that you should have earnest

00:29:26.032 --> 00:29:30.532
desire to know the Truth and Truth
and Truth – and nothing else.

00:29:31.115 --> 00:29:32.906
When you think like that,

00:29:33.115 --> 00:29:35.324
then you will not take
to other things.

00:29:35.532 --> 00:29:37.532
So many people took to drugs,

00:29:37.782 --> 00:29:41.906
thinking that, by doing that, they
will achieve their Self-Realisation.

00:29:42.073 --> 00:29:43.490
It’s a wrong idea.

00:29:43.741 --> 00:29:48.699
How can you get away from your awareness?
Can achieve that?

00:29:48.907 --> 00:29:53.157
Awareness is the most
important thing.

00:29:53.407 --> 00:29:56.115
If you can go

00:29:56.741 --> 00:30:00.365
into the realm
of awareness,

00:30:00.616 --> 00:30:05.115
then you have to understand that the
basic awareness is not to be lost.

00:30:05.365 --> 00:30:07.324
If your basic awareness
is lost,

00:30:07.616 --> 00:30:11.906
through drinking or through drugs
or all these things that people do.

00:30:12.073 --> 00:30:15.157
They think that they are seeking,
that’s why they are doing.

00:30:15.365 --> 00:30:21.574
So sometimes they take excuse of
‘seeking’ to do wrong things.

00:30:22.115 --> 00:30:25.657
It’s like a revenge on
your Self, I think,

00:30:25.866 --> 00:30:27.616
that you want
to revenge yourself

00:30:27.824 --> 00:30:32.449
by thinking that you
are now ‘seeking’.

00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:34.741
It’s not the real seeking.

00:30:34.907 --> 00:30:39.906
In a real seeking, a person
has to just meditate

00:30:40.115 --> 00:30:43.407
and should find out
what is the right way.

00:30:43.657 --> 00:30:46.240
But, that too, not by
reading some books

00:30:46.449 --> 00:30:48.990
or listening to
some false gurus.

00:30:49.198 --> 00:30:53.490
Actually, Kundalini
awakening is the only way

00:30:53.741 --> 00:30:57.198
one can know the Reality.
There’s no other way out.

00:30:57.449 --> 00:31:01.490
But nobody tells them that
it is Kundalini awakening.

00:31:01.782 --> 00:31:03.616
They’ll tell you:
“We’ll go to this place,

00:31:03.866 --> 00:31:06.115
then to that place,
then more to that place.

00:31:06.365 --> 00:31:07.616
Then this has
to be done…

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:11.032
And, ultimately, where do
you come? Where you started!

00:31:11.532 --> 00:31:15.657
Just like that: moving
from places to places.

00:31:15.906 --> 00:31:19.115
Moving from false

00:31:19.365 --> 00:31:23.324
to another false, to another
false,… to falsehood.

00:31:23.824 --> 00:31:26.948
Ultimately so many
seekers have been lost.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.699
So many have been
lost, because

00:31:31.157 --> 00:31:37.282
they thought that certain
type of… is very precious,

00:31:37.699 --> 00:31:39.240
seeking is very ‘precious’,

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:42.824
because you can pay lots
of money to the guru.

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:44.948
I mean, you can
‘purchase’ the guru.

00:31:45.198 --> 00:31:48.741
And so: “All the rich people
can become enlightened.”

00:31:48.906 --> 00:31:50.073
That means that.

00:31:50.282 --> 00:31:55.490
But I don’t think that the percent-
age of good people are only rich.

00:31:55.741 --> 00:31:57.906
The people who are

00:31:58.115 --> 00:32:02.407
good are good. Whether they are
rich or not is not the point.

00:32:02.699 --> 00:32:06.324
But such people try to
gather round a person,

00:32:06.532 --> 00:32:10.449
because, I think, there’s a
subtle ego of their money,

00:32:10.699 --> 00:32:14.073
that: “We can afford to
buy this, buy that.”

00:32:14.574 --> 00:32:19.032
Once I was in America and there
was one lady who came to see Me

00:32:19.282 --> 00:32:23.490
and she didn’t know that I
was… a spiritual person.

00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:28.157
So she said: “Now there’s a very
good guru who has come to America.”

00:32:28.449 --> 00:32:29.990
I said: “Really?
What does he do?

00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:33.824
She said: “There’s a sale
on.” I said: “Really?”

00:32:34.115 --> 00:32:37.407
“You can pay him
half the amount:

00:32:37.699 --> 00:32:40.907
he can give you his blessings.
Alright?”

00:32:41.157 --> 00:32:45.616
Then next week, she said: “Now
the sale has come to one fourth.

00:32:45.906 --> 00:32:48.115
If you pay the one
fourth amount,

00:32:48.324 --> 00:32:50.782
then he will give you
the ‘full’ knowledge.”

00:32:50.948 --> 00:32:53.574
I said: “How can
it be reciprocal?

00:32:53.782 --> 00:32:55.948
It’s not proportionate!”
I said:

00:32:56.198 --> 00:32:59.324
“You were giving half,
he was giving you half,

00:32:59.532 --> 00:33:01.574
and when you are giving
one-fourth, he is giving you full.”

00:33:01.824 --> 00:33:03.449
“That’s the thing”
she said,

00:33:03.657 --> 00:33:07.824
“he’s very magnanimous, you see.
That’s the point.”

00:33:08.324 --> 00:33:13.324
I said: “For all such people who
think they can purchase Truth,

00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:17.906
they cannot achieve it.
You cannot purchase it.

00:33:18.699 --> 00:33:22.990
You cannot pay for your
Kundalini awakening. No!

00:33:23.324 --> 00:33:26.157
Nor you should take any
payment for that.

00:33:26.407 --> 00:33:32.073
Self-Realisation is
absolutely the Divine Grace.

00:33:32.365 --> 00:33:36.282
And you cannot take
money for that.

00:33:37.073 --> 00:33:41.115
You cannot sell it. It’s not
so ‘cheap’ to be sold.

00:33:41.407 --> 00:33:46.741
If you understand that, then
the Mahalakshmi power works.

00:33:47.073 --> 00:33:48.948
And Mahalakshmi power is

00:33:49.198 --> 00:33:52.449
really meant for people who
are really genuine seekers,

00:33:52.741 --> 00:33:57.824
who are really seeking genuinely.
It acts and works so well,

00:33:58.073 --> 00:34:03.198
that they achieve a
kind of a very, very

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.616
spontaneous Realisation.

00:34:07.073 --> 00:34:11.073
This spontaneous Realisation,
you all have got it.

00:34:11.365 --> 00:34:15.407
You don’t have to go to Himalayas. You
don’t have to do anything like that.

00:34:15.616 --> 00:34:19.906
All those things are over.
You have done it.

00:34:20.157 --> 00:34:22.699
In your previous lives,
you must have done it.

00:34:22.906 --> 00:34:24.449
Now you don’t have
to do anything.

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:28.782
You can get it, you are getting
it just sitting down here.

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:32.282
Wherever you are in the
whole world, you can get it

00:34:32.532 --> 00:34:34.407
and it is spreading
very fast.

00:34:34.616 --> 00:34:40.948
Now, it’s also the duty of Sahaja
Yogis to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:41.948 --> 00:34:45.906
Now, this one is

00:34:46.115 --> 00:34:50.240
to be understood: that
Mahalakshmi and Mahakali

00:34:50.574 --> 00:34:54.324
both go hand in hand.

00:34:54.574 --> 00:34:58.824
When, you see,
Mahakali blesses you

00:34:59.032 --> 00:35:02.574
and She is with you and
you are in Her realm,

00:35:02.782 --> 00:35:04.699
the Mahalakshmi comes
forward

00:35:04.906 --> 00:35:08.616
and She definitely helps you
to achieve your Realisation

00:35:08.866 --> 00:35:13.157
and also to improve
your problems,

00:35:13.365 --> 00:35:17.324
to help you. I mean - the financial
side of it, you can call it,

00:35:17.574 --> 00:35:19.282
or in any way other

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:23.616
problems also She solves. The
greatest problem She solves

00:35:23.824 --> 00:35:29.532
that your greatest desire to achieve
Self-Realisation, is granted.

00:35:29.948 --> 00:35:33.032
So, there is no competition
between Them.

00:35:33.324 --> 00:35:36.866
All these three powers
work together,

00:35:37.073 --> 00:35:40.906
and, whatever is needed,
they work it out.

00:35:41.157 --> 00:35:46.782
But it is the Mahakali who
guides where what help has to go

00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:52.282
and that’s why the power of
Mahakali is very much respected.

00:35:52.532 --> 00:35:58.948
As it is, She has killed so many
devils and so many rakshasas

00:35:59.198 --> 00:36:02.906
and there are still more –
some of them are existing

00:36:03.073 --> 00:36:05.198
but I am sure they
will be all finished.

00:36:05.407 --> 00:36:11.073
There will be none of these
horrible ones ever existing.

00:36:11.324 --> 00:36:15.824
But still we have to be
very careful and alert

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.490
and try to find out what’s
wrong with these people.

00:36:19.699 --> 00:36:24.782
What are they doing and what
they trying to propagate?

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:28.906
You must mature in
such a manner that

00:36:29.115 --> 00:36:34.240
you should know everything
of all these evil doers.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.324
You must find out what these
false people are doing.

00:36:38.532 --> 00:36:42.449
See, it’s really easy, because
you are enlightened.

00:36:42.699 --> 00:36:46.782
And with your enlightened attention,
you can definitely find out

00:36:46.948 --> 00:36:51.490
what’s wrong with
what organisation,

00:36:51.741 --> 00:36:55.782
with each evil man,
evildoer.

00:36:55.948 --> 00:36:59.365
It will be… the best
way is to meditate.

00:36:59.574 --> 00:37:01.532
Not to be aggressive
in any way.

00:37:01.741 --> 00:37:06.449
But just to meditate and
ask Mahakali: “Destroy!

00:37:06.741 --> 00:37:10.990
Destroy him, for he is destroying
the world. You please destroy him!”

00:37:11.198 --> 00:37:13.449
That’s Her job and
She’d love to do it,

00:37:13.657 --> 00:37:16.449
but somebody has to
tell Her and ask Her.

00:37:16.699 --> 00:37:19.824
It’s very good, because
there are so many,

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.365
that unless and until
you point it out,

00:37:22.616 --> 00:37:25.824
She may not be able to put Her
attention to that - possibly.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:30.490
So it’s best is always
ask Her to help you.

00:37:30.699 --> 00:37:34.282
On individual basis.
On a national basis.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:39.240
Maybe on a collective basis
or maybe on a global basis.

00:37:39.449 --> 00:37:44.532
That’s what. She exists everywhere.
She is globally available.

00:37:44.782 --> 00:37:46.782
Anywhere: you may
be having

00:37:46.948 --> 00:37:51.699
any colour, any race,
any nation - anything.

00:37:51.906 --> 00:37:55.574
but She exists within
you all the time.

00:37:55.782 --> 00:37:59.282
And to worship Her
and to awaken Her,

00:37:59.532 --> 00:38:03.365
is only ‘your’ due,
that ‘you’ have to do.

00:38:03.574 --> 00:38:06.907
If She is awakened within you,
you’ll be a humble person.

00:38:07.115 --> 00:38:09.741
You will see what mistakes
you have been committing

00:38:09.948 --> 00:38:13.449
and you’ll feel bad about it.
You will not feel ‘guilty’,

00:38:13.699 --> 00:38:14.657
but you will feel ‘bad’,

00:38:14.906 --> 00:38:17.866
that: I will never do such a thing.
I have done very great wrong.

00:38:18.032 --> 00:38:20.324
And then you will
try to correct it.

00:38:20.574 --> 00:38:22.990
All this works out

00:38:23.198 --> 00:38:26.907
very well when you are
pure in your heart.

00:38:27.157 --> 00:38:31.324
Your heart should be pure.
If your heart is not pure,

00:38:31.532 --> 00:38:38.782
if you are doing Sahaja Yoga to
have some competition with others

00:38:38.948 --> 00:38:43.990
or with some sort of material
achievements, it will not work out.

00:38:44.365 --> 00:38:49.782
You have to do it in a way
that is an innocent act,

00:38:50.115 --> 00:38:53.574
that you are worshipping your
Mother like a little child

00:38:53.782 --> 00:38:55.616
worships and loves
his mother.

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:59.699
It’s a very simple relationship,
which all of us have felt,

00:38:59.907 --> 00:39:02.616
how we should love
our Mother and

00:39:02.866 --> 00:39:08.240
how we should be under Her
guidance and under Her protection.

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:12.115
That is something very simple you
have known in your childhood

00:39:12.365 --> 00:39:15.240
and that childhood has
to come back in you

00:39:15.449 --> 00:39:18.282
if you really
worship the Mother.

00:39:18.574 --> 00:39:21.741
May God Bless you.
