00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.010
The guru has to be like a full moon

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.860
means completely grown

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.590
completely matured

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.680
There are sixteen

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.220
kalas or the phases of the Moon and when the complete

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.040
purnima comes in the full moon day all the sixteen kalas are completed.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.000
You also know that in the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.480
there are sixteen sub plexuses.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.420
When

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.690
Krishna

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.150
Is described at Virata. He is called as Sampurna - the complete incarnation of Vishnu's aspect,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.460
because he has got the sexteen

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.110
phases completely done.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.420
so today's number is 16. 6 + 1= 7

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410
Now we have to understand the importance of Guru.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.630
Why should we have a Guru when we have God?

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.510
We have got Shakti then why should we have a Guru? What is the need to have a Guru?

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.930
Guru means the weight.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.180
We get our weight

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.640
from the magnetic forces of the Gravity of the Mother Earth.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.480
So Guru means Gravity - a Gravity in a  person.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.940
Why do we need a Guru?

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900
because to know God

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.690
Is easy, especially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.930
As soon as you get your self-realization in Sahaja Yoga - the modern Sahaja Yoga - immediately you become

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.790
entitled to give realizations to other.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.440
It was said that guru is the person who makes you meet the divine.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:04.440
But it is not true because any self-realised person in the Sahaja Yoga

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.360
can raise the Kundalini and can give self-realization to others immediately after

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.470
they have touched the Sahasrara - opened the Sahasrara.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.060
But normally a realized soul cannot do it.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.630
Any born realized soul cannot do it on its own. It has to have authority of Me, and I am today.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.600
That's why it was said that Guru is a person who makes you meet God. He raises the Kundalini and

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.360
makes you one with God.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.310
Because in those days

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.770
when the Gurus were self-realized

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.470
when the Gurus were self-realised

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.790
they had the authority and power

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.920
of raising the Kundalini only after they have reached a very great

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.840
state of evolution: complete purification, complete detachment...

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.470
So it was not possible for people to give realization when they just touched

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.850
realised thinking.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.170
Most of the gurus in the olden days started by first cleansing the people.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.930
First cleanse them one by one, raise the Kundalini, brought it to every Chakras,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:53.510
and then gave them realization. It was a different technique altogether.  You can say it was a bullock cart technique.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.290
That's why one Mantra was given for a particular Chakra where was the problem where the Kundalini was stopping.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.870
For about, some people used to get it even for ten years they would work out on one chakra.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.030
I have known people who have been working on Agnya for ten years, twenty years.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.560
But you know in Sahaja Yoga we clear it out just like that.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.670
That has something to do with your particular ?? and ??.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.930
So the first conception that a person who makes you meet God is the

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.410
guru has to be a little bit advanced.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.490
Because for you now it’s the child’s play to raise the Kundalini and

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.170
make them one with the Divine.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.920
But still you don’t become guru in the Sahaja Yoga terminology.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.050
Even if you have vikalpas, you have doubts, about Sahaja Yoga still you can do it if you raise your hand.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:10.440
Even when your chitta, attention, is not clear cut still you can do it. You can still do it.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.400
How? How it has worked out that way,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.620
so beautifully?

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:36.810
It has worked out, I would say, at this stage only. Maybe later on I will tell you. But its pure

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:48.180
Divine, which is not contaminated by whatever state you may be in, its flowing:

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.080
absolutely pure Divine.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.320
With others it was different, they had to cleanse it, clear it out.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.730
As an instrument you are perfect,

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.230
but as a guru you are not.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.750
Whatever may be your defects

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.910
or whatever you maybe lacking, you raise your hand and the Kundalini will rise,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.370
On your fingers it is going to move.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.060
You get tremendous power.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.810
You can ask anyone,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.140
they’ll tell you they are surprised. They are jealous of you.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.680
They can’t understand that how, by raising your fingers, that you are perfect instruments.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.990
Because you are created by somebody really perfect.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.600
But you are not perfect gurus:

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:59.110
that one has to understand. And that is why you need a guru to tell you all that, what is the perfection.

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.570
Now as I have told you, that guru means gravity.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.630
You cannot say

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.150
where is the axis of

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.290
Mother Earth is? You cannot see it. I mean you cannot see it, you cannot feel it.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.690
But they say there is an axis on which the Mother Earth rotates.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.780
There is an energy

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.080
It's an energy on which this Mother Earth rotates.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.260
In the same way you have an axis,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.740
which is your Sushumna,

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.230
which gives you the gravity.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.110
The first

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:08.390
important thing

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.430
for a guru is

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.440
that your gravity point is one.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.910
Everything centres on gravity.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.810
Unless and until

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:36.250
Your attention is completely

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:39.560
fixed on to that gravity point within you

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.570
— which is called as dhrugva,is a fixed point —

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.640
ou cannot become a guru.

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:07.090
So the gravity in you comes to you

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.070
by clearing your attention, by looking at your attention where does it go?

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.600
How do you reach your gravity point?

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.990
or anything

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:31.010
that has a gravity point? How do we discover it? We go on balancing it,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.770
and when the balance is complete, that time we say this is the gravity point.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.560
In the same way your attention should hold your gravity point in complete balance.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.180
So the first thing is that you should be a balanced person.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.820
But a balanced person

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.440
is not a fixed person,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.250
he is not rigid. But

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.620
But an imbalanced person is a person who runs here, there,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:21.150
there, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga: running after this, running after that, running after that. Such a person

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.500
cannot achieve much.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.590
Fix your gravity points, the balancing point, with Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.430
That is much [more] important

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.200
than knowing anything else. First of all fix your gravity point

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.530
then you will be amazed that,

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.140
whatever you see apart from Sahaj Yoga,

00:11:53.780 --> 00:12:01.300
in the light of Sahaja Yoga, you will realise that, how it relates to Sahaja Yog

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.150
as it relates to you gravity point.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.100
Say it is against it, still you will see where it is against.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.960
If it is for it, you will see where it is for. For example you will read books:

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.670
immediately you will know what is the truth, what is not the truth.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:25.000
But if you do not have that point fixed or

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.410
attained,

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:34.430
then you will be slipping down this side or that side. Anything else can attract you, you can slip down from Truth.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:42.200
So that point has to be fixed first of all within yourselves:

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.920
dhruvapada as they call it;

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:49.070
the position of the fixed point

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.670
from which we understand that everything radiates from it,

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:03.520
everything is controlled from here. The light within us by which we see what is darkness and what is

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.560
reality

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.350
But do all this,

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.690
even if you glorify and say all the names and chant everything, it has no meaning

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.780
unless and until you develop discipline about it.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:39.280
Discipline is the sthai bhav or you can say the

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:44.260
emotion of permanence

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.760
for a guru state, guru seva, or for becoming a guru.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.300
You must discipline your body, discipline your mind, discipline yourself.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:06.610
Sahaja Yoga is such a simple thing to have: I mean you are just connected with me.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:16.300
But you are not a guru. So how do you discipline yourself? Some people have awkward way in their bodies,

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:24.790
then they should get to it, that they have a proper way in their body.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:34.370
Mould your body. It is not to torture your body but to master your body.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:43.510
For example, I would not say that you go and sit in the cold ice water. Its wrong,

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:53.320
to freeze yourself and make your bones horrible. But you must do all that is required to give you a supple body

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.400
and a body that can live under any circumstances.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.710
A little bit of course you have to exert also,

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:10.300
that you should be able to sit on the ground properly,

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:14.030
that you should be able to sleep on the ground properly.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.530
There should be no problem about these things. You have to discipline.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:27.220
Sahaja Yoga is a real blessing, but can be sometimes a blessing in disguise.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.610
If you take it for granted

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:34.250
you will drift out, you wont go very further.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:42.340
So the body should be such that it should be able to take lot of load upon itself,

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.600
should be able to do a lot of work.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.250
This is for you to decide about your own body.

00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.090
Now you see your gurus body how it is:

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:05.010
I take lot of work out of my body. I can work for hours together.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.390
I can keep awake for hours together.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:12.930
I’ll never

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
even once

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.830
ay that my body is no good.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.740
It’s such a nice friend I have.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.610
But there is a very great tapasya state, penance we have to have,

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:34.390
tremendous penance.

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.850
Because this is a human body

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:44.500
which had to work out lots of things. You know at the time of Rama, He had to walk bare feet all the way.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:49.720
He was a King and He had to live in a hut.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.350
So do not be dominated by luxuries and comforts.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.610
I do not mean to say that you unnecessarily

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.180
torture your body, that’s not the point at all. Because I must bring the balancing point, always.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:14.150
But do not pamper your body that it becomes a hurdle for your penance.

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.690
Keep your body clean,

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:23.660
respect your body,

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:30.430
and it will be very happy when it will know that you have used it for the Divine purpose.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.040
There’s an Indian word for which we call it: a ‘bhaitak’ here.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:47.740
I don’t know, there is no English equal to that. But bhaitak means the power to sit:

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.900
that’s the gravity within you.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.620
How long can you sit in one posture,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.630
what is your bhaitak. Like any studies or anything they’ll ask, “What is your bhaitak?”

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:07.800
“Have you got the bhaitak?” Is the power to be seated on one point:

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.560
how long you can sit

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.990
continuously.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:24.270
That is how you judge your gravity. Unless and until you have a bhaitak you cannot be a guru.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:31.510
So the body is to be brought round properly.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:41.520
It has to be disciplined. It’s no question of becoming thin or fat, but the body should be such that you should be able to

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.640
use it for your purpose as a guru.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.950
Sometimes, you will find you can’t sleep on the ground:

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.490
then you [should] sleep on the ground for three, four days, then the body will be very happy.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.660
It will pain [for] one or two days.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.880
But do not insult your body.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.900
This is the other side of the discipline:

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.190
we don’t take our bath, we don’t keep ourselves all right.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.590
Then you are insulting your body. Look after it.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.790
You may have to

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.800
look after its softness,

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.070
the gentleness of the body. Treat it with respect.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.670
By becoming barbaric you are insulting your body.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.470
so the body

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.230
is very important, this is made of five elements,

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.340
and all these five elements within us, as gurus,

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.020
has to be sparkling.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:00.180
I can go on like this but now you think about it: in future, what have you to do with your body.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.480
How you are going to use the five elements

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:11.840
within your body, to cleanse them, make then beautiful so that your light sparkles.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:22.620
The gravity comes to you in your body this way:

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.100
that

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:31.220
you start generating your power or your principle of gurutva,

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:37.860
principle of your mastery, through this point of your gravity.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:46.920
The second point is your attention should have that gravity.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.880
Your attention is very important.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.160
A person who is easily disturbed

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:58.330
is not a deep person.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.310
Or easily taken to something, like say emotions.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:15.760
Or easily to some other, say, intellectual pursuit.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:21.110
As gurus there will be temptations for you

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:33.690
People will be challenging your state. A person comes out with a very big intellectual ‘truth’ or something,

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:40.250
then immediately you feel challenged about it and you will say, “All right let me handle the situation.”

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.460
Handle it at the Sahaja Yoga point, on your gravity.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.970
Just sit down on your gravity and see for yourself.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:53.930
Immediately you will know how to handle the situation. You need not talk to that person, you’ll handle the situation all right:

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.910
not on [the] intellectual level but on your gravity.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:07.560
If the attention has the gravity, it pulls down the ego and the superego of other people.

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.980
Then you will not be frustrated or frantic.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.550
also, if you can

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.300
start from the outside it may work out with human beings;

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.990
like

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:33.790
Like study your behaviour how you behave towards others.

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:37.660
Or study your attention how it behaves towards

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.730
outside:

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.990
what attracts your attention,

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:52.480
what attracts your attention. Study your attention.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:23:01.580
By that study you will be able to fix your attention

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.360
in its maryada, in its boundaries.

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.210
Once you put the boundaries to

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.180
the attention then the depth starts developing.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.640
The person who has no boundaries can never have depth, he will be spreading just like that, always;

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.050
no depth at all.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:25.190
So you have to put boundaries by understanding your attention,

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:30.920
that, “No not more than that.” “All right not more than that.”

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.200
Like some people in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, they get interested in a patient,

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.700
then for them that patient becomes important.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:47.630
Or get interested in some person that he must get Realisation: “my mother,” “my father,” “my, my” .

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:53.780
And all the time they are talking about it: “my jobs,”

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.080
“my clothes,” some sort of a ‘my’.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:08.020
And they don’t know how to draw the line. You must know where to draw the line, is maryadas.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:17.750
Otherwise the whole thing will fritter away. You will become a frivolous person. There won’t be any gravity in you.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.140
So you must know how far to go with a person when you are dealing as a guru,

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.830
then you are a master.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:40.360
But if you do not know where to draw the line, you may be crossing the line and getting into his clutches.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:54.700
So the best way to handle the situation is to get into thoughtless awareness,

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:02.020
again and again and again and again, and you establish that clearly.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.830
Now, some of them complain to me that it’s not an easy thing to do.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:14.090
It’s the easiest thing to do, if you give up all other

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.630
useless things that you are doing.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:29.910
And then gravity will give you the wisdom to do the right thing at the right time.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:38.670
Ashram is a place where one has to learn to be a guru. But I find it is not always a good experiment for people.

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:45.780
Once they have an ashram they take it for granted. They think, “This is the place for us to nicely come and live and

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.110
and some people will work, some will be enjoying.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.190
Some will pay some will not pay.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:07.310
It’s most surprising. You must immediately find out the person who really has the spiritual authority

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:10.770
and try to follow that person.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:17.220
And instead of that we try to meet up with people who are of lower spiritual authority.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:28.180
And [if] he sleeps till nine o’clock, everybody sleeps! In an ashram nobody should sleep after six o’clock: is an absolute thing.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.060
Absurd!

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:36.790
You must sleep early and get up early. Otherwise you can stay outside.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.070
You all must get up at six o’clock. Do you know what time your Mother gets up?

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:58.840
And what I find: nobody is up here.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.500
In India they all get up very early. But I find nobody is up here and my attention is all wasted.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.990
And you don’t realise

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.960
how important all these things are. This is the training time for you.

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:27.780
For this you are born, you have been seeking this for ages now. You have got it now, you must discipline yourself.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:33.500
But I have seen in ashramas where people pay a big amount, they get up at six o’clock, 4  o’clock, 3  o’clock.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:46.670
Because in Sahaja Yoga everything has to come from you. This is the style it is.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.100
At the most I can ask people who are not all right, to go out for a while,

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.970
and then the join ashram. That helps some people.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.490
But not more than that; because I am also a Mother though I am a Guru.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.970
It is you who should mature yourself. You’ll mature much faster than [if] I force things on you.

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.690
Finding faults with others but not with yourself.

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.010
You must have

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:26.810
a discipline, a time in the morning to get up, do little a puja or something. At least spend half an hour, all of you together.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.660
You should be ready by 6 or 6.30, sit down,

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:43.040
do meditation. I have to lay down rules for you now, because you do not want to lay it down.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:49.640
I am also amazed that many people do not know even my aarti, after so many years, by heart.

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.940
That is what Sahaja Yoga is, because it’s a Mahamaya.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.770
So you have to learn it yourself.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.530
You have to do it yourself.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:14.260
It’s easy to talk about Sahaja Yoga, very simple: stand up and talk. Because you have heard from your Mother, your talk.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.100
But it will have no impression on another person!

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.980
It will fritter away.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.920
Because it must come from your centre of gravity.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.610
This is the greatest thing you can do to yourself:

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.780
is to discipline yourself fully

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:52.430
And compete in disciplining yourself; and make your body all right, your attention correct

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:04.000
Attention is corrected by many ways. As I said: watch your attention, where does it go.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.520
Now

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:13.670
what else are we going to talk but Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:19.360
Is there anything more beautiful or more interesting,

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.340
more manifesting than Sahaja Yoga is?

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.040
And what is the job of a guru?

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:33.550
Is nothing but to expose the Parabrahma Itself, the whole working of the Divine; that is the job of a guru.

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.890
To expose the complete working of the

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.130
Parabrahma

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.850
is the job of a guru in the modern times, not only raising the Kundalini.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:54.080
But after raising the Kundalini you should be able to tell all about the Divine powers and everything.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.170
For that you have to learn, you have to read, you have to understand.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:05.150
Do you understand now the difference between the old gurus and modern gurus?

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:14.780
Because they were brought with such tremendous discipline and hardly one or two used to be great gurus.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.800
They went through such

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.870
studies and such interrogations and examination and tests

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.360
that by the time they were 75 or so they became gurus.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:35.090
But we have to do it quick and the best way is to do it yourself.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:47.090
Perhaps the tradition of the Western countries do not give you much

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.670
impetus for disciplining. That’s called cutting out yourself perhaps.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.690
But a disciplined person

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:04.420
is the only one who can be a Sahaj Yogi.

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.990
Spontaneity

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.570
works best in a disciplined person.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.430
A disciplined person is the one who knows the technique,

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:26.490
and the energy is the spontaneity. But a person who is frittered away what will spontaneity do with it?

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.670
It cannot work it out;

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.250
the instrument is so horrible.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:38.210
So you discipline yourselves so that others would be disciplined by your behaviour.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:49.700
Once you have disciplined yourself, when you become a guru, you have certain privileges as a master.

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.190
And

00:32:55.190 --> 00:33:00.270
It was used as a weapon by many masters before, you need do that.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.450
I am just telling you as a side issue — is the temper.

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.230
All the gurus had tremendous temper.

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.070
It was expected of the guru.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.870
Like I would tell you about Allauddin Khan Sahib

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.010
who was a great musician, was the master of Ravi Shankar and all these people.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.150
And my father was the political advisor to this

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:33.840
Maharaja of Maihar. And we went down there, I was there also.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:40.350
That time Ravi Shankar was an artist was playing a little bit here and there.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.630
I mean he was quite a good artist still.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:50.910
So his guru had a great respect for my father. He used to treat my father very great reverence.

00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:53.830
So he was playing something,

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:57.720
he was very good at Mridangam.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:06.120
So he played the Mridangam for

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:14.650
my father. So in that day the tune or the lehara is there, the tune one has to play, the simple tune; just to play the mridangam, to be played on that (as an accompaniment).

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.200
So my father asked Ravi Shankar to play [missing text see transcript]

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.820
and at the slightest [mistake] they will take up this and hit you, you see.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:25.610
So people used to be very careful.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.440
If they were sitting near the stone.

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:31.130
The people would stay away from them

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:35.360
They would throw stones. They’ll keep a chimta, big chimta like this.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:40.970
Anybody coming near them they would hit them.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:46.400
At the slightest thing they gave a chimta to a disciple.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:51.440
It was a long thing, you know, made out of iron and a chimta is a double pronged thing. And they would hit the person, “Tham!” like this.

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:54.860
It was the situation

00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:02.240
before I came in here as your guru. It is difficult to be a guru and a Mother, I cannot do both things together!

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.100
But that was the situation, even those great artist today

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:13.850
who are playing great things like you’ll hear now Vilayat Khan Sahib: you go and ask him about his guru, how much time he was beaten up,

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.760
absolutely beaten up

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:22.310
any swara they did wrong was: absolute chastity, absolute discipline.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:30.350
If the guru said, “Five o’clock tomorrow,” even if guru comes or not, five o’clock you have to be there.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.030
For any art

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.310
in the Indian style was like that,

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.000
complete discipline

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.310
Without discipline not even education was imparted:

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.540
terrible taskmasters.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.420
And that’s what they used which you need not here in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.590
There is no need to use temper in Sahaja Yoga

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:07.950
because I have not given you, imparted, any knowledge to you with temper.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:13.520
Perhaps there could be hardly anyone who has seen me in a temper.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:22.780
So that is not the way we Sahaja Yogis are going to impart knowledge to others.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.470
We have to be very mild and sweet,

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.410
because in the pattern of your own Guru,

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:31.550
because She’s sweet,

00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:33.050
She’s very mild

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:34.980
and She’s very persuasive

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.250
and kind. In the same way you have to be,

00:36:38.330 --> 00:36:40.310
because that pattern you haven’t learned.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:45.340
That’s why don’t take to that kind of a pattern where people are in a big temper and they come out with a big temper.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.840
It doesn’t behove a Sahaj Yogi

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:56.620
to be like that.I mean, they had such tremendous powers also that they could just make somebody into ashes;

00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.690
with such a temper they lived. And they had one guru

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:06.550
somewhere like

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:11.280
a Rock of Gibraltar,

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.610
that you face him and you hit your head. At least one or twice

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:19.390
you must have a big hitting from him, otherwise he’s not your guru.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:27.890
That was the system.Now we have a great artist sitting here. You must be also remembering his guru, who must have really

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.110
beaten him nicely

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.110
before he imparted knowledge.

00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.040
They said, “Without you hit and

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.270
chisel, you cannot make a good

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.740
disciple.” And this time we are going to

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.400
challenge that

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:53.180
and to prove that our Mother was extremely kind and still

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:55.900
we are chiseled out beautifully,

00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:03.110
by your own chisel. That’s why I request you to do it yourself because I cannot do it as a Mother.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.820
And that’s why it is

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:10.300
your responsibility

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.560
to do it that way.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.350
Today is the day where we all have to decide that

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:20.360
we are going to be gurus now.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.450
I am going to retire as a guru.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:24.450
It’s all right to be a Mother to you people.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:26.080
now

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.760
you have to be gurus of other people,

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:33.210
and for that you must know what you should achieve.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.060
You have all the powers within you, you can manifest them also.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.390
But you cannot have a following unless and until you become a guru.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.670
This is the only difference [there] is

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:57.150
If you want to have a following then you must chisel out yourself in that fashion that, as soon as people see you, they  should say,

00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.920
“Here is [somebody] with that gravity.”

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.410
I think that should be sufficient for today’s Guru puja.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.200
Only thing, the last, most important thing is,

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:18.550
that you cannot make a drama out of it. It has to be a reality.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:27.180
By standing like a big, imposing person, you do not become that. On the contrary people will think you are mad.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:38.830
It should be from within that you should develop that dignity within yourself, that poise, that balance,

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.100
that understanding, within yourself.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.070
A kindly poise,

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:52.600
a beautiful personality,

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:56.090
benevolent.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:01.150
But standing above everyone else by it’s gravity,

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:05.440
depth, gentlemanliness,

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.870
generosity,

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.260
proper bearing, neatness, cleanliness

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:28.580
above all, love: a heart like an ocean, most forgiving.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:45.410
I am sure next year we’ll have some gurus here who have already got some disciples around them.

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:02.290
May God bless you.
