Shakti Puja, Togliatti (Russia), 3 August 1993.

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:33.166
Today it is such a great day for our Being,

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:39.581
to be with you all again this year.

00:01:49.126 --> 00:02:01.137
It’s so very joyous and full of fragrance.

00:02:10.703 --> 00:02:18.289
Today we have decided to have a Puja of Shakti that is the power,

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.637
that is the Devi.

00:02:38.452 --> 00:02:45.002
You know within us there are many powers

00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:53.125
of Maha Kali, Maha Saraswati, Maha Lakshmi, Kundalini.

00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:11.659
All these powers are there for us to ascent.

00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:49.948
If these powers are properly used and understood,

00:03:50.148 --> 00:03:57.008
then your ascent can be permanent.

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:09.124
Once you achieve your ascent

00:04:09.324 --> 00:04:12.897
and enter into the kingdom of God,

00:04:13.097 --> 00:04:17.730
all these powers get enlightened.

00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:33.168
And these powers which are enlightened

00:04:33.368 --> 00:04:41.532
are absolutely filled with Love.

00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:56.158
Enlightenment, we have to understand that

00:04:56.358 --> 00:05:01.522
we get completely enlightened by Love.

00:05:08.842 --> 00:05:12.821
So after enlightenment, after realisation,

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:19.115
we use only one power which is of Love.

00:05:27.574 --> 00:05:34.308
Shri Rama had two sons: one was Lav and one was Kush.

00:05:38.527 --> 00:05:44.178
One of them, Lav, came to Russia.

00:05:46.287 --> 00:05:51.701
That’s why you are called as Slavs, means ‘with love’.

00:05:56.077 --> 00:06:07.677
So Russian people are already quite full of their heart with love.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:18.694
But once you get your enlightenment

00:06:18.894 --> 00:06:23.866
you realise that your love becomes

00:06:24.066 --> 00:06:30.995
a beautiful ocean of joy for yourself.

00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:48.836
This love is not the same which you had before enlightenment.

00:06:52.682 --> 00:07:03.822
It’s transformed into a new dimension, into a new form.

00:07:06.143 --> 00:07:11.076
Before enlightenment you are attached to yourself,

00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:15.201
first of all, very much: to your body, to your mind,

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:21.513
to your conditionings, to your intellect, to your ego.

00:07:31.057 --> 00:07:34.193
And that is how you develop

00:07:34.393 --> 00:07:42.414
darkness of many horrible things within yourself.

00:07:47.593 --> 00:07:49.949
If you are too much attached to your body,

00:07:50.149 --> 00:07:53.196
then you may eat too much or you may not eat at all

00:07:53.396 --> 00:07:56.335
or you may exercise too much

00:07:56.536 --> 00:08:04.349
or you may work it out for a particular form of your figure.

00:08:15.432 --> 00:08:20.068
And you will use your body for absolutely wrong things

00:08:20.268 --> 00:08:24.471
or sinful things also.

00:08:29.074 --> 00:08:32.468
But then you become enlightened

00:08:32.668 --> 00:08:38.737
and you understand that your body is the temple of God.

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:51.878
Then you keep your body clean and also you try to avoid

00:08:52.078 --> 00:08:57.328
all that is destructive for your body.

00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:10.450
The another attachment we have is very limited,

00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:14.951
say for your own family, for your children, for your wife,

00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:19.797
for your husband, something like that.

00:09:28.172 --> 00:09:32.937
Despite that a human being can be extremely selfish

00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:35.730
and could only bother about himself

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:41.195
and first of all him and then the rest.

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:54.999
Also he may spoil his children or spoil her husband

00:09:55.199 --> 00:10:04.350
or his wife in any way just to pamper their ego.

00:10:16.293 --> 00:10:21.327
Some people might indulge into alcoholism

00:10:21.527 --> 00:10:25.776
or drugs or all kinds of things.

00:10:30.058 --> 00:10:38.877
Also to help their families they may draw other people,

00:10:45.828 --> 00:10:52.148
because they are very self-centered and their vision is very narrow.

00:10:56.224 --> 00:11:00.866
Sometimes they discover that for those people for whom

00:11:01.067 --> 00:11:08.254
they are doing wrong things, are not actually bother about them.

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:21.654
Then there’s enlightenment and they see for themselves

00:11:21.854 --> 00:11:24.888
that whatever I’m doing is neither good for me

00:11:25.088 --> 00:11:29.636
nor for my family, nor my relations.

00:11:39.563 --> 00:11:44.610
After enlightenment you think collectively.

00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:51.245
Also when you think about your wife and your children,

00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:57.125
your family, you think what is the right thing for them to do.

00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:10.327
Immediately you become attentive to their problems

00:12:10.527 --> 00:12:14.613
and to their destructiveness.

00:12:23.262 --> 00:12:29.238
Then this power of love changes the whole atmosphere.

00:12:32.133 --> 00:12:37.089
In the family people see how sacrificing you are

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:41.413
and how noble you are.

00:12:48.913 --> 00:12:55.520
This nobility is seen very clearly among Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:05.142
In that noble understanding of life

00:13:05.342 --> 00:13:14.105
they try to be extremely patient, sweet in the family

00:13:14.305 --> 00:13:19.656
and try to bring them to the right path.

00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:36.794
At the same time when they are helping their families

00:13:36.995 --> 00:13:42.795
and try to improve their understanding,

00:13:42.996 --> 00:13:49.140
they can be also very particular as to see that

00:13:49.364 --> 00:13:59.091
they do not allow over indulgence into their family.

00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:12.827
Because of the enlightenment, there’s detachment.

00:14:17.296 --> 00:14:22.200
And the power of detached love is the greatest.

00:14:24.966 --> 00:14:29.638
It’s like the sap in the trees which rises from the Mother Earth,

00:14:29.838 --> 00:14:34.865
goes up into the smallest of leaves

00:14:35.065 --> 00:14:41.708
and then it is either evaporated or goes back to the Mother Earth.

00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:55.620
It doesn’t stay in one flower

00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:03.206
because it likes it or in one leaf because it likes it.

00:15:09.894 --> 00:15:14.022
It nourishes every part of the tree, whatever is need,

00:15:14.222 --> 00:15:18.543
and is not attached.

00:15:23.405 --> 00:15:30.432
But supposing it gets entangled or involved in one flower

00:15:30.632 --> 00:15:34.120
or in one leaf, the tree will die

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.148
and that leaf and that flower will also die.

00:15:47.109 --> 00:15:54.937
So detached love only gives, doesn’t expect anything back.

00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:04.820
If it expects anything is complete prosperity

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:12.309
and the goodness of the tree.

00:16:17.254 --> 00:16:21.921
In the same way a saintly person, who is a Sahaja Yogi,

00:16:22.121 --> 00:16:25.820
behaves towards his family, towards his friends,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.050
towards everything.

00:16:37.099 --> 00:16:42.568
We have used only the power of hatred so far.

00:16:45.677 --> 00:16:49.094
In the politics, especially, one country believes that

00:16:49.294 --> 00:16:54.349
they must hate another country, they are born for that.

00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:02.269
Because hundred years back

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.108
some quarrel took place or a war took place,

00:17:06.308 --> 00:17:11.029
so the children are still fighting among themselves.

00:17:17.185 --> 00:17:21.072
You’ll be amazed that when I first came to Russia,

00:17:21.272 --> 00:17:28.287
25 German Sahaja Yogis rushed to help Me here.

00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:40.341
Instead of bearing that malice in their hearts,

00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:44.091
as their forefathers had killed so many of Russians,

00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:50.049
they felt it was their greatest wishes to go

00:17:50.249 --> 00:17:55.221
and do some service for the Russians.

00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:13.863
So all the hatred changes into this powerful Love.

00:18:19.426 --> 00:18:25.479
This power of Love is the greatest power and after Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:30.858
we have to use only our power of Love.

00:18:36.278 --> 00:18:44.357
It’s the most powerful, effective weapon that we have.

00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:52.552
Because this is Divine Love.

00:18:54.906 --> 00:18:57.284
We are getting the source of Divine Love

00:18:57.484 --> 00:19:02.937
from the all pervading power of God’s Love.

00:19:08.342 --> 00:19:12.350
They say that God is Almighty.

00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:19.422
Then who can be more powerful than God?

00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:25.313
And if we are connected with God Almighty,

00:19:25.513 --> 00:19:29.740
who could be mightier than us?

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:40.947
In His Love He protects us, He gives us whatever we want,

00:19:41.147 --> 00:19:47.188
He blesses us and He makes us enjoy ourselves.

00:19:54.922 --> 00:20:02.187
His government is the most efficient
one and is very quick and very fast.

00:20:05.833 --> 00:20:10.375
Today only when I was coming, one
of the Sahaja Yogis came and said,

00:20:10.575 --> 00:20:15.286
“Mother it is very cloudy, it may rain.”

00:20:21.648 --> 00:20:24.248
And when I came out after five minutes

00:20:24.449 --> 00:20:28.561
I found the whole sky is cleared out.

00:20:32.288 --> 00:20:40.812
So all these five elements also are at
the disposal of the children of God.

00:20:45.257 --> 00:20:48.973
Even the cruellest of the cruel person melts down

00:20:49.173 --> 00:20:58.335
and comes to the humble understanding of this power.

00:21:04.101 --> 00:21:08.251
No one can harm you.

00:21:09.048 --> 00:21:14.540
And anybody who tries to harm you becomes melted away.

00:21:19.197 --> 00:21:22.674
It is so many miracles that in this short speech

00:21:22.882 --> 00:21:25.168
I won’t be able to tell you all of them.

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:30.535
But you’ll find it in your life itself, how this power of Love,

00:21:30.735 --> 00:21:36.279
that you have within your heart, has protected you.

00:21:45.441 --> 00:21:48.084
I have seen people who are very hot tempered,

00:21:48.284 --> 00:21:53.354
who are angry type, who are all the
time making other’s life miserable,

00:21:53.555 --> 00:21:58.772
become extremely beautiful, nice people.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:14.840
With this Light of Love, you love yourself in the right way

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:21.201
and give up all that is wrong, all that is immoral.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:34.458
This Love is eternal, is very powerful

00:22:34.658 --> 00:22:42.282
and gives you a confidence in the collectivity of human beings.

00:22:47.101 --> 00:22:55.249
Because it’s the Spirit which enlightens all your power.

00:22:58.651 --> 00:23:06.331
And the Spirit is the source of collectivity and love

00:23:06.531 --> 00:23:10.625
for every human being in the world.

00:23:15.675 --> 00:23:19.538
Then your attention goes to all the people who are in trouble,

00:23:19.738 --> 00:23:25.389
who are suffering, who need help.

00:23:31.141 --> 00:23:34.269
And with this attention, which is so enlightened,

00:23:34.469 --> 00:23:39.736
you can solve their problems sitting down here.

00:23:45.936 --> 00:23:51.298
With such people there’s no need to have any wars,

00:23:51.498 --> 00:23:58.132
no need to have any weapons, no need to have any boundaries.

00:24:04.936 --> 00:24:10.155
If Russians go to India, they feel India as their country,

00:24:10.356 --> 00:24:16.284
if Indians come to Russia they think Russia their own country.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.587
So who will fight?

00:24:27.787 --> 00:24:32.189
There’s no one to whom you can really say: “He is my enemy” ,

00:24:32.389 --> 00:24:37.988
because everybody is part and parcel of your being.

00:24:47.132 --> 00:24:53.037
These are the special times, I call them the Blossom time

00:24:53.237 --> 00:24:59.675
when too many flowers are there who are seeking the Truth.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.390
And their fragrance is their Love.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.972
And they have all to become fruits now.

00:25:25.082 --> 00:25:28.060
And this is what is going to happen

00:25:28.261 --> 00:25:33.116
as these times are very, very important.

00:25:37.819 --> 00:25:42.194
In all the religions they are described.

00:25:44.235 --> 00:25:48.457
We don’t hate anyone because we believe in one religion

00:25:48.657 --> 00:25:55.504
or another religion. On the contrary,
we believe in all the religions.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.159
This is the power by which a drop becomes the ocean

00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:12.633
and individual becomes the collective.

00:26:19.527 --> 00:26:23.027
So all your powers that are there are enlightened

00:26:23.227 --> 00:26:27.360
by the all pervading power.

00:26:32.493 --> 00:26:40.717
It transforms you and it has such a beautiful, delicate way

00:26:40.917 --> 00:26:45.175
of handling everything.

00:26:52.518 --> 00:26:58.962
The only thing that is needed is faith in this power,

00:27:02.002 --> 00:27:06.685
that only by having Love for others,

00:27:06.885 --> 00:27:10.841
and this enlightened Love

00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:16.782
is going to give you whatever you want.

00:27:24.605 --> 00:27:29.511
And there is such a power, All-pervading power.

00:27:35.884 --> 00:27:40.099
There is no doubt about it.

00:27:40.299 --> 00:27:44.554
And we have to just accept it with our open heart

00:27:44.754 --> 00:27:50.418
that it fills it and makes us a great personality.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.535
So there’s no competition, there’s no ambition,

00:28:00.735 --> 00:28:06.675
there’s no jealousy, nothing of the kind.

00:28:12.616 --> 00:28:17.744
The only desire then left is that "I am enjoying myself,

00:28:17.944 --> 00:28:21.975
let others also enjoy."

00:28:28.554 --> 00:28:34.108
People go out of the way to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:37.647 --> 00:28:43.668
They work very hard, travel with very little money,

00:28:43.868 --> 00:28:47.043
they try to convince people,

00:28:47.243 --> 00:28:53.035
do all kinds of things for no material gain.

00:29:00.933 --> 00:29:03.972
But the greatest joy is when you see that

00:29:04.172 --> 00:29:07.347
you have raised the Kundalini of another person

00:29:07.547 --> 00:29:12.227
and given him self-realisation.

00:29:19.099 --> 00:29:24.288
That lits up your faces I have seen many times.

00:29:29.892 --> 00:29:35.330
Let this Love grow more and more.

00:29:38.578 --> 00:29:43.992
They asked me, why of all places I came to Togliatti.

00:29:47.562 --> 00:29:55.944
Not for Volga, not for these beautiful houses you have

00:29:56.144 --> 00:30:00.725
but for My children who are here.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.886
May God bless you.
