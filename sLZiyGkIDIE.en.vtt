00:06.509 --> 00:09.416
Shakti Puja, Togliatti (Russia), 3 August 1993.

01:27.053 --> 01:33.166
Today it is such a great day for our Being,

01:33.366 --> 01:39.581
to be with you all again this year.

01:49.126 --> 02:01.137
It’s so very joyous and full of fragrance.

02:10.703 --> 02:18.289
Today we have decided to have a Puja of Shakti that is the power,

02:18.489 --> 02:22.637
that is the Devi.

02:38.452 --> 02:45.002
You know within us there are many powers

02:45.211 --> 02:53.125
of Maha Kali, Maha Saraswati, Maha Lakshmi, Kundalini.

03:04.008 --> 03:11.659
All these powers are there for us to ascent.

03:40.551 --> 03:49.948
If these powers are properly used and understood,

03:50.148 --> 03:57.008
then your ascent can be permanent.

04:05.179 --> 04:09.124
Once you achieve your ascent

04:09.324 --> 04:12.897
and enter into the kingdom of God,

04:13.097 --> 04:17.730
all these powers get enlightened.

04:24.446 --> 04:33.168
And these powers which are enlightened

04:33.368 --> 04:41.532
are absolutely filled with Love.

04:51.618 --> 04:56.158
Enlightenment, we have to understand that

04:56.358 --> 05:01.522
we get completely enlightened by Love.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.821
So after enlightenment, after realisation,

05:13.021 --> 05:19.115
we use only one power which is of Love.

05:27.574 --> 05:34.308
Shri Rama had two sons: one was Lav and one was Kush.

05:38.527 --> 05:44.178
One of them, Lav, came to Russia.

05:46.287 --> 05:51.701
That’s why you are called as Slavs, means ‘with love’.

05:56.077 --> 06:07.677
So Russian people are already quite full of their heart with love.

06:13.081 --> 06:18.694
But once you get your enlightenment

06:18.894 --> 06:23.866
you realise that your love becomes

06:24.066 --> 06:30.995
a beautiful ocean of joy for yourself.

06:41.231 --> 06:48.836
This love is not the same which you had before enlightenment.

06:52.682 --> 07:03.822
It’s transformed into a new dimension, into a new form.

07:06.143 --> 07:11.076
Before enlightenment you are attached to yourself,

07:11.276 --> 07:15.201
first of all, very much: to your body, to your mind,

07:15.401 --> 07:21.513
to your conditionings, to your intellect, to your ego.

07:31.057 --> 07:34.193
And that is how you develop

07:34.393 --> 07:42.414
darkness of many horrible things within yourself.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.949
If you are too much attached to your body,

07:50.149 --> 07:53.196
then you may eat too much or you may not eat at all

07:53.396 --> 07:56.335
or you may exercise too much

07:56.536 --> 08:04.349
or you may work it out for a particular form of your figure.

08:15.432 --> 08:20.068
And you will use your body for absolutely wrong things

08:20.268 --> 08:24.471
or sinful things also.

08:29.074 --> 08:32.468
But then you become enlightened

08:32.668 --> 08:38.737
and you understand that your body is the temple of God.

08:44.479 --> 08:51.878
Then you keep your body clean and also you try to avoid

08:52.078 --> 08:57.328
all that is destructive for your body.

09:05.691 --> 09:10.450
The another attachment we have is very limited,

09:10.651 --> 09:14.951
say for your own family, for your children, for your wife,

09:15.151 --> 09:19.797
for your husband, something like that.

09:28.172 --> 09:32.937
Despite that a human being can be extremely selfish

09:33.138 --> 09:35.730
and could only bother about himself

09:35.930 --> 09:41.195
and first of all him and then the rest.

09:50.430 --> 09:54.999
Also he may spoil his children or spoil her husband

09:55.199 --> 10:04.350
or his wife in any way just to pamper their ego.

10:16.293 --> 10:21.327
Some people might indulge into alcoholism

10:21.527 --> 10:25.776
or drugs or all kinds of things.

10:30.058 --> 10:38.877
Also to help their families they may draw other people,

10:45.828 --> 10:52.148
because they are very self-centered and their vision is very narrow.

10:56.224 --> 11:00.866
Sometimes they discover that for those people for whom

11:01.067 --> 11:08.254
they are doing wrong things, are not actually bother about them.

11:16.776 --> 11:21.654
Then there’s enlightenment and they see for themselves

11:21.854 --> 11:24.888
that whatever I’m doing is neither good for me

11:25.088 --> 11:29.636
nor for my family, nor my relations.

11:39.563 --> 11:44.610
After enlightenment you think collectively.

11:47.281 --> 11:51.245
Also when you think about your wife and your children,

11:51.445 --> 11:57.125
your family, you think what is the right thing for them to do.

12:05.893 --> 12:10.327
Immediately you become attentive to their problems

12:10.527 --> 12:14.613
and to their destructiveness.

12:23.262 --> 12:29.238
Then this power of love changes the whole atmosphere.

12:32.133 --> 12:37.089
In the family people see how sacrificing you are

12:37.289 --> 12:41.413
and how noble you are.

12:48.913 --> 12:55.520
This nobility is seen very clearly among Sahaja Yogis.

13:00.270 --> 13:05.142
In that noble understanding of life

13:05.342 --> 13:14.105
they try to be extremely patient, sweet in the family

13:14.305 --> 13:19.656
and try to bring them to the right path.

13:29.761 --> 13:36.794
At the same time when they are helping their families

13:36.995 --> 13:42.795
and try to improve their understanding,

13:42.996 --> 13:49.140
they can be also very particular as to see that

13:49.364 --> 13:59.091
they do not allow over indulgence into their family.

14:08.491 --> 14:12.827
Because of the enlightenment, there’s detachment.

14:17.296 --> 14:22.200
And the power of detached love is the greatest.

14:24.966 --> 14:29.638
It’s like the sap in the trees which rises from the Mother Earth,

14:29.838 --> 14:34.865
goes up into the smallest of leaves

14:35.065 --> 14:41.708
and then it is either evaporated or goes back to the Mother Earth.

14:52.429 --> 14:55.620
It doesn’t stay in one flower

14:55.820 --> 15:03.206
because it likes it or in one leaf because it likes it.

15:09.894 --> 15:14.022
It nourishes every part of the tree, whatever is need,

15:14.222 --> 15:18.543
and is not attached.

15:23.405 --> 15:30.432
But supposing it gets entangled or involved in one flower

15:30.632 --> 15:34.120
or in one leaf, the tree will die

15:34.320 --> 15:39.148
and that leaf and that flower will also die.

15:47.109 --> 15:54.937
So detached love only gives, doesn’t expect anything back.

15:59.593 --> 16:04.820
If it expects anything is complete prosperity

16:05.020 --> 16:12.309
and the goodness of the tree.

16:17.254 --> 16:21.921
In the same way a saintly person, who is a Sahaja Yogi,

16:22.121 --> 16:25.820
behaves towards his family, towards his friends,

16:26.020 --> 16:30.050
towards everything.

16:37.099 --> 16:42.568
We have used only the power of hatred so far.

16:45.677 --> 16:49.094
In the politics, especially, one country believes that

16:49.294 --> 16:54.349
they must hate another country, they are born for that.

17:00.042 --> 17:02.269
Because hundred years back

17:02.470 --> 17:06.108
some quarrel took place or a war took place,

17:06.308 --> 17:11.029
so the children are still fighting among themselves.

17:17.185 --> 17:21.072
You’ll be amazed that when I first came to Russia,

17:21.272 --> 17:28.287
25 German Sahaja Yogis rushed to help Me here.

17:36.725 --> 17:40.341
Instead of bearing that malice in their hearts,

17:40.541 --> 17:44.091
as their forefathers had killed so many of Russians,

17:44.291 --> 17:50.049
they felt it was their greatest wishes to go

17:50.249 --> 17:55.221
and do some service for the Russians.

18:07.299 --> 18:13.863
So all the hatred changes into this powerful Love.

18:19.426 --> 18:25.479
This power of Love is the greatest power and after Sahaja Yoga,

18:25.679 --> 18:30.858
we have to use only our power of Love.

18:36.278 --> 18:44.357
It’s the most powerful, effective weapon that we have.

18:48.271 --> 18:52.552
Because this is Divine Love.

18:54.906 --> 18:57.284
We are getting the source of Divine Love

18:57.484 --> 19:02.937
from the all pervading power of God’s Love.

19:08.342 --> 19:12.350
They say that God is Almighty.

19:14.805 --> 19:19.422
Then who can be more powerful than God?

19:22.039 --> 19:25.313
And if we are connected with God Almighty,

19:25.513 --> 19:29.740
who could be mightier than us?

19:34.310 --> 19:40.947
In His Love He protects us, He gives us whatever we want,

19:41.147 --> 19:47.188
He blesses us and He makes us enjoy ourselves.

19:54.922 --> 20:02.187
His government is the most efficient
one and is very quick and very fast.

20:05.833 --> 20:10.375
Today only when I was coming, one
of the Sahaja Yogis came and said,

20:10.575 --> 20:15.286
“Mother it is very cloudy, it may rain.”

20:21.648 --> 20:24.248
And when I came out after five minutes

20:24.449 --> 20:28.561
I found the whole sky is cleared out.

20:32.288 --> 20:40.812
So all these five elements also are at
the disposal of the children of God.

20:45.257 --> 20:48.973
Even the cruellest of the cruel person melts down

20:49.173 --> 20:58.335
and comes to the humble understanding of this power.

21:04.101 --> 21:08.251
No one can harm you.

21:09.048 --> 21:14.540
And anybody who tries to harm you becomes melted away.

21:19.197 --> 21:22.674
It is so many miracles that in this short speech

21:22.882 --> 21:25.168
I won’t be able to tell you all of them.

21:25.368 --> 21:30.535
But you’ll find it in your life itself, how this power of Love,

21:30.735 --> 21:36.279
that you have within your heart, has protected you.

21:45.441 --> 21:48.084
I have seen people who are very hot tempered,

21:48.284 --> 21:53.354
who are angry type, who are all the
time making other’s life miserable,

21:53.555 --> 21:58.772
become extremely beautiful, nice people.

22:09.360 --> 22:14.840
With this Light of Love, you love yourself in the right way

22:15.040 --> 22:21.201
and give up all that is wrong, all that is immoral.

22:29.690 --> 22:34.458
This Love is eternal, is very powerful

22:34.658 --> 22:42.282
and gives you a confidence in the collectivity of human beings.

22:47.101 --> 22:55.249
Because it’s the Spirit which enlightens all your power.

22:58.651 --> 23:06.331
And the Spirit is the source of collectivity and love

23:06.531 --> 23:10.625
for every human being in the world.

23:15.675 --> 23:19.538
Then your attention goes to all the people who are in trouble,

23:19.738 --> 23:25.389
who are suffering, who need help.

23:31.141 --> 23:34.269
And with this attention, which is so enlightened,

23:34.469 --> 23:39.736
you can solve their problems sitting down here.

23:45.936 --> 23:51.298
With such people there’s no need to have any wars,

23:51.498 --> 23:58.132
no need to have any weapons, no need to have any boundaries.

24:04.936 --> 24:10.155
If Russians go to India, they feel India as their country,

24:10.356 --> 24:16.284
if Indians come to Russia they think Russia their own country.

24:23.570 --> 24:27.587
So who will fight?

24:27.787 --> 24:32.189
There’s no one to whom you can really say: “He is my enemy” ,

24:32.389 --> 24:37.988
because everybody is part and parcel of your being.

24:47.132 --> 24:53.037
These are the special times, I call them the Blossom time

24:53.237 --> 24:59.675
when too many flowers are there who are seeking the Truth.

25:09.920 --> 25:15.390
And their fragrance is their Love.

25:18.750 --> 25:22.972
And they have all to become fruits now.

25:25.082 --> 25:28.060
And this is what is going to happen

25:28.261 --> 25:33.116
as these times are very, very important.

25:37.819 --> 25:42.194
In all the religions they are described.

25:44.235 --> 25:48.457
We don’t hate anyone because we believe in one religion

25:48.657 --> 25:55.504
or another religion. On the contrary,
we believe in all the religions.

26:04.320 --> 26:08.159
This is the power by which a drop becomes the ocean

26:08.359 --> 26:12.633
and individual becomes the collective.

26:19.527 --> 26:23.027
So all your powers that are there are enlightened

26:23.227 --> 26:27.360
by the all pervading power.

26:32.493 --> 26:40.717
It transforms you and it has such a beautiful, delicate way

26:40.917 --> 26:45.175
of handling everything.

26:52.518 --> 26:58.962
The only thing that is needed is faith in this power,

27:02.002 --> 27:06.685
that only by having Love for others,

27:06.885 --> 27:10.841
and this enlightened Love

27:11.041 --> 27:16.782
is going to give you whatever you want.

27:24.605 --> 27:29.511
And there is such a power, All-pervading power.

27:35.884 --> 27:40.099
There is no doubt about it.

27:40.299 --> 27:44.554
And we have to just accept it with our open heart

27:44.754 --> 27:50.418
that it fills it and makes us a great personality.

27:56.680 --> 28:00.535
So there’s no competition, there’s no ambition,

28:00.735 --> 28:06.675
there’s no jealousy, nothing of the kind.

28:12.616 --> 28:17.744
The only desire then left is that "I am enjoying myself,

28:17.944 --> 28:21.975
let others also enjoy."

28:28.554 --> 28:34.108
People go out of the way to spread Sahaja Yoga.

28:37.647 --> 28:43.668
They work very hard, travel with very little money,

28:43.868 --> 28:47.043
they try to convince people,

28:47.243 --> 28:53.035
do all kinds of things for no material gain.

29:00.933 --> 29:03.972
But the greatest joy is when you see that

29:04.172 --> 29:07.347
you have raised the Kundalini of another person

29:07.547 --> 29:12.227
and given him self-realisation.

29:19.099 --> 29:24.288
That lits up your faces I have seen many times.

29:29.892 --> 29:35.330
Let this Love grow more and more.

29:38.578 --> 29:43.992
They asked me, why of all places I came to Togliatti.

29:47.562 --> 29:55.944
Not for Volga, not for these beautiful houses you have

29:56.144 --> 30:00.725
but for My children who are here.

30:07.490 --> 30:11.886
May God bless you.
