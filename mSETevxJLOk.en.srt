1
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:05,366
All these years

2
00:08:09,776 --> 00:08:15,285
I have been waiting for this day.

3
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:28,566
We have now, on the twenty-first
Sahasrara,

4
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:40,199
so is a very important turning point

5
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:54,118
as you know that every twenty-first day
we change our calendars

6
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,608
as far as the horoscope is concerned.

7
00:09:02,303 --> 00:09:07,729
And so now is a new change has to come

8
00:09:09,093 --> 00:09:13,067
and you can see the announcement.

9
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:31,435
A new understanding and awareness
of a very new dimension.

10
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:40,850
We have been so far dealing with collective
consciousness.

11
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:45,999
We are collectively conscious.

12
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:57,820
We have the idea that we are collectively
conscious.

13
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:06,354
Also we know we are part and parcel
of the whole

14
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:15,124
and that we all are sahaja yogis.

15
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:26,162
We know about our chakras and our nadis
very clearly,

16
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,526
but perhaps we do not know about our
powers,

17
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:39,295
how many powers have developed in those
twenty-one years within yourself.

18
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:58,052
Last two months Italy was burning with
fire, it was so very hot.

19
00:10:58,253 --> 00:11:02,060
And I read reports that they are worried
about a drought

20
00:11:02,337 --> 00:11:08,533
and they want rain to come in and now
they think the time has passed away.

21
00:11:12,457 --> 00:11:22,414
But how it works, you see, because the
All-pervading Power knows everything

22
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,044
and the whole nature works for your
benefit, for your programmes.

23
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:33,050
At the right time things happen, as you
have seen before.

24
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:39,179
They are completely coordinated with
our programmes.

25
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,571
All the time they are helping you.

26
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:45,640
Whatever they have in themselves as powers,

27
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:49,931
they are using them at the right time.

28
00:11:50,132 --> 00:11:58,734
 Now be confident that you have powers.

29
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:10,746
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

30
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:15,674
So far only you knew that you could feel
the vibrations,

31
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:21,569
that you could cure people, you could
help to cure -

32
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:31,089
I mean, still not so confident that you
could feel the Paramchaitanya.

33
00:12:33,163 --> 00:12:38,786
But you did not know what dynamic Forces
are working in you now

34
00:12:38,987 --> 00:12:43,385
and this is the new change that is going
to come.

35
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:48,279
With this new change, you have to assume
a new character,

36
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,952
and the new character is announcement.

37
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:59,452
So far I had told you not to talk about
Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

38
00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:05,419
but now the time has come. We waited
long for these days.

39
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:08,938
Now you have to all start talking about it,

40
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,703
announcing about it and telling about it
to everyone.

41
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:18,822
Otherwise, the world would say that,
“We never knew about it!”

42
00:13:19,426 --> 00:13:26,526
All other false gurus are so well known
all over because their disciples

43
00:13:26,717 --> 00:13:30,552
are talking about them [in] all the places,
wherever they can.

44
00:13:30,753 --> 00:13:35,758
To all the big offices they go, to big
people they go.

45
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:41,054
They go to all the important people. [They]
just go and tell them what they have.

46
00:13:41,245 --> 00:13:45,010
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

47
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:49,140
because I wanted you, first of all,
to develop

48
00:13:49,341 --> 00:13:55,852
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis,
so that from your life,

49
00:13:56,053 --> 00:14:02,268
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour,
from your understanding,

50
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:09,129
from your thoughts, people will realise
that these people are very unique

51
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:14,623
and very different type of people.

52
00:14:15,425 --> 00:14:21,892
Now that assumption has to be there.

53
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:29,541
You have to understand that all these
powers are bubbling in you

54
00:14:29,722 --> 00:14:35,176
and just out of formality or maybe out
of shyness

55
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:41,390
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding
them.

56
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:44,982
The other day there was a sahaja yogi
who came to my house

57
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:52,313
and he saw some flowers which were
fading away.

58
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:56,787
I said, “They are not fading. You can give
them life.” He said, “How?”

59
00:14:56,988 --> 00:15:03,550
I said, “You cut the bottom of all of them
and put your hand underneath.”

60
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:08,817
[Aside to someone: Take these children
away. Just what book he has got?]

61
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:23,338
And he just put his hands under the base
of the stem

62
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:25,633
and he said, “Mother, they are still
drooping.” I said, “All right,

63
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:28,731
now leave them in the water.”

64
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,127
His attention was here and there,

65
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:34,310
within fifteen days (minutes?) they all
stood up all right,

66
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:37,940
started growing, they became bigger
flowers,

67
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:42,531
and lasted for five days more after that.

68
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:46,062
Then he was convinced.

69
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:55,760
You can do so many things to convince
yourself that you have these powers.

70
00:15:55,961 --> 00:16:00,154
I have seen people who have certain
problems.

71
00:16:00,355 --> 00:16:04,008
They have a headache, they have this, that.
They come to me,

72
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:09,307
write big letters, “Mother, I get my
headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

73
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:13,764
Now those days are gone when Mother has
to cure your headache,

74
00:16:13,965 --> 00:16:19,740
look after your wife, look after your
children. Is all finished now.

75
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:24,919
Now you are responsible, not only
for yourself,

76
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:32,526
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

77
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,474
for your countries and for the whole world.

78
00:16:37,982 --> 00:16:41,101
Now, assume your powers.

79
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:47,208
Like yesterday he sang, or he played,
‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

80
00:16:47,438 --> 00:16:52,090
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up
your responsibilities!

81
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:58,688
Everybody has to feel responsible.
And assume what you are.

82
00:16:58,912 --> 00:17:04,049
Know your powers, what you can do.
Sit down.

83
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,460
Now, the days are gone when you had
to sit down and count your blessings.

84
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:11,624
Now you have to count your powers:

85
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:17,256
“How many powers I have and what I can
use and how I can use.”

86
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:21,155
No use counting your miracles. You have
had enough miracles to prove

87
00:17:21,346 --> 00:17:26,543
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are
helped by the Paramchaitanya.

88
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:29,446
But now know how much of that
Paramachaitanya

89
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:33,491
you are going to use yourself, how you
are going to manoeuvre it

90
00:17:33,692 --> 00:17:37,211
and how you are going to work out.

91
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:44,996
This is the New Era we are starting
from today.

92
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:50,590
And this is the day I was waiting for all
of you to realise

93
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,878
that you are not sahaja yogis for only
your selfish ends,

94
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:00,110
nor for your families, nor for your
communities,

95
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:03,341
nor for your country, but for the whole
world.

96
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:07,512
Expand yourself. You must have that vision
before you,

97
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,158
that I have put many a times before
you people,

98
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,205
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

99
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:17,001
Now don’t have diffidence.

100
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:21,876
First of all, you should not think that,
“We are very ordinary people.

101
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:26,286
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got
something special about it.”

102
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:28,835
This work is not going to be done
by special people

103
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:32,786
because they are suffering from ego.

104
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,551
It is going to be done by people who don’t
have that ego

105
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:43,465
of great success or of great achievements
or riches or anything.

106
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,787
If they are rid of this, then only they can
work it out.

107
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:52,393
And that’s why it is for you to understand
what Christ has said

108
00:18:52,594 --> 00:19:03,952
that a camel can pass through the hole
of a needle, but not a rich man.

109
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:07,720
Because the ego is too big, bigger than
a camel, bigger than an elephant,

110
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:11,498
any animal you could think of.

111
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:16,372
That’s why now as we are entering into
new awareness,

112
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:23,515
let us not worry about our negative
thinking.

113
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:30,459
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be?
I am not all right.

114
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,751
I was like this. I was doing like this.
I had done like this.”

115
00:19:35,973 --> 00:19:38,704
So many letters of confessions come to me,

116
00:19:38,905 --> 00:19:42,818
pages after pages, which I throw away
or burn them off.

117
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,322
There is no need to confess any more.
There’s only one confession,

118
00:19:46,523 --> 00:19:50,573
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after
twenty-first of Sahasrara,

119
00:19:50,774 --> 00:19:53,935
I am a Maha Yogi.”

120
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,882
This is the confession you have to make.

121
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:02,139
And no more of all these out-of-date things
that people tell me

122
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,098
about your family’s life and all mundane,
nonsensical things.

123
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:09,682
We have given them up and we have come
to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

124
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:14,821
We have achieved our ascent and now
for what? For what?

125
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:20,297
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate
human beings,

126
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:27,501
to help them out of the mire of ignorance,
of darkness.

127
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:37,443
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

128
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:40,730
So we have to openly say to these
fundamentalists

129
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:42,956
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know
the truth.

130
00:20:43,157 --> 00:20:46,742
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

131
00:20:46,943 --> 00:20:49,019
You don’t know that there is a power
that is working.”

132
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,837
You have to tell them very clearly,
“You are all stupid people

133
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,903
running after something that is a mirage

134
00:20:56,104 --> 00:21:00,225
and all of you will end up into hell
as described by all the scriptures.”

135
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,134
We have to openly say it, this thing.

136
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:05,019
Whichever way you like, you may write
books.

137
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,809
You may publish it. You may tell people
about it.

138
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,795
But now the new announcement has to come
to say

139
00:21:10,996 --> 00:21:16,792
that running after falsehood is not going
to take you to God.

140
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:22,371
And, in that, they have used the power
of hatred.

141
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,284
So you have to say that, “We believe
in the power of love

142
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:28,529
and not in the power of hatred that you
believe in.”

143
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,476
For us, everybody is capable of finding
the Truth

144
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:43,485
and is capable of getting to the heaven
of that paradise,

145
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:46,794
which is promised to us, the Kingdom
of God.

146
00:21:46,995 --> 00:21:51,496
So, for us, everybody, whether they belong
to this community, that community,

147
00:21:51,697 --> 00:21:56,008
this race or that race, whatever it is,
we believe –

148
00:21:56,209 --> 00:22:01,844
not that – but we are sure, that we all
are quite capable

149
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:07,001
and blessed by God, that we should enter
into His Kingdom.

150
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:13,192
If you take this kind of a positive
attitude, your negativity will go away.

151
00:22:13,393 --> 00:22:16,284
Negative forces, as you know, you have
been pulled down

152
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:22,258
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

153
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:25,244
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached
to any families or anything.

154
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:29,987
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

155
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:34,944
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve
everybody’s family problems.

156
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,500
Now we have marriages and even after
marriages I find

157
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:41,475
[that] still people don’t understand what
is a Sahaja Yoga marriage.

158
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:45,856
And there are still some problems —
very few, but there are.

159
00:22:46,057 --> 00:22:51,566
So this nonsensical problem of “my family,
my wife, my children,

160
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:57,835
my house, my property, my money,” all this
“my” should be finished first of all.

161
00:22:58,036 --> 00:23:03,673
You have to belong to the world. Any person
who is a king,

162
00:23:03,874 --> 00:23:08,429
[who] does not belong to his kingdom
is a failure, is useless.

163
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:14,585
If he thinks about himself, about his own
comfort, about his own fame,

164
00:23:14,786 --> 00:23:19,054
about his own achievements, then
he is a failure.

165
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:24,356
He has to think about the country on which
he is ruling.

166
00:23:24,557 --> 00:23:28,856
In the same way, you have to also turn
your mind away

167
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:32,276
from all these petty things that you have
been dealing with.

168
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,495
I have been struggling with you, trying
to help you

169
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:37,149
for every small little nonsensical things.

170
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,367
And many people said that, “Mother,
why should You worry?

171
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:41,590
You are a saint. Why should You worry
about these things?”

172
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:45,139
I said, “Unless and until these
entanglements are taken away,

173
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,710
they are not going to come out.”

174
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:52,287
But now, now you do feel that freedom,
complete freedom.

175
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:55,563
You are an individual. You are absolutely
free

176
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:58,649
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

177
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,932
You are not entangled with anyone.

178
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,943
You are not any way attached to anyone.

179
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:07,890
In that detachment, you are going
to nourish everyone,

180
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:11,314
inclusive of so-called your family, your
people,

181
00:24:11,515 --> 00:24:14,288
your country and ultimately the world.

182
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:22,636
So, to get rid of negativity, first
important thing is to learn detachment.

183
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:25,981
Detachment comes through thoughtless
awareness.

184
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:29,316
When you look at anyone or start thinking
about anyone –

185
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:32,236
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

186
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:37,865
Immediately you’ll feel detached and you’ll
know the solution of the whole problem.

187
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:43,388
Now the greatest power you have is in your
brain, that you are knowledgeable.

188
00:24:43,589 --> 00:24:45,884
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

189
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,055
that, “what is the chakra, what is
the centre” — not that.

190
00:24:49,256 --> 00:24:51,557
But there is all knowledge within you.

191
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:56,020
Just you have to get into thoughtless
awareness

192
00:24:56,221 --> 00:24:59,153
and the whole library of knowledge can
open to you.

193
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:03,104
You know, so many of you have never been
speaking on the stage,

194
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:07,475
they had stage fear, and you have become
great speakers.

195
00:25:07,676 --> 00:25:11,949
So many of you were possessed people
who couldn’t even stand before me,

196
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:17,014
have now become leaders and are doing
good job.

197
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:21,268
In every field you will find that you have
advanced so much.

198
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:24,829
So many people who never knew how
to sing have started singing,

199
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,286
did not know how to paint have started
painting.

200
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:31,288
But these are very, very mundane things

201
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:34,739
which may give us little pleasures here
and there,

202
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,446
but the main thing is how many people
we give Realisation to.

203
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:41,912
Whether you are a woman, whether you
are man,

204
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:44,468
whether you are a father, whether you are
a mother,

205
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,940
whether you are a child or a grown up.

206
00:25:48,141 --> 00:25:52,155
Everybody has to see how many people
we can give Realisation to,

207
00:25:52,356 --> 00:25:57,068
how much we can announce about Sahaja
Yoga. That’s the main thing.

208
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:00,147
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it
happens.

209
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:03,063
Like, when I went to Australia, I was
surprised

210
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:06,722
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime
thing for them,

211
00:26:06,923 --> 00:26:11,650
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja
Yoga is a commitment,

212
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:14,991
is a commitment and complete involvement.

213
00:26:15,192 --> 00:26:18,670
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely useless.

214
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:21,552
It’s better to have few people who are
committed

215
00:26:21,753 --> 00:26:25,058
than to have thousands who are just
useless.

216
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:29,028
So let us see what you have decided
for yourself

217
00:26:29,229 --> 00:26:32,137
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

218
00:26:32,338 --> 00:26:34,631
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

219
00:26:34,832 --> 00:26:38,931
then just know that this is the main thing
which you have to do.

220
00:26:39,135 --> 00:26:42,290
The whole attention should be on that.

221
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:47,115
As I told this morning, a very good poem
written by Namadeva

222
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:52,119
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

223
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,963
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and
the kite is flying in the air.

224
00:26:56,164 --> 00:27:01,034
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention
is on the kite.

225
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:04,340
There’s a lady who is doing all
the household work.

226
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:08,200
She is doing all the cleaning, but
the child is on her,

227
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:13,809
on her back or on her waist. All her
attention is on the child.

228
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,805
Then there are ladies who are taking
water home.

229
00:27:17,006 --> 00:27:21,739
There’s a water pitcher on their heads,
sometimes two, sometimes three.

230
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,389
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re
talking to each other, laughing,

231
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,586
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

232
00:27:27,787 --> 00:27:32,292
In the same way, your attention should be
all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

233
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:35,777
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga?
Where are we? Where are we going?

234
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:40,592
Where is Mother? What part She is?
What is She doing?”

235
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:49,586
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

236
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:53,734
because attention which was involved
into negative things

237
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:59,231
will get absolutely detached and you’ll
start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

238
00:27:59,432 --> 00:28:03,656
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have
to make it a Mahayoga.

239
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:06,827
And unless and until that level is achieved
by you,

240
00:28:07,028 --> 00:28:09,407
then we should think that you are still
backdated

241
00:28:09,608 --> 00:28:16,545
and I don’t know, in the turning of the
wheel, how many will be left there.

242
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:21,118
So this is a very big turning point and
today is a very great day for us

243
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:28,141
because Sahasrara, today, has completed
its twenty-one years

244
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:33,087
and, like that, it has twenty-one aspects.

245
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:38,423
Seven, the chakras. Seven into three
of your nadis.

246
00:28:38,624 --> 00:28:46,154
So it’s twenty-one aspects you have been
able to achieve and the twenty-one powers.

247
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:48,921
You just experiment and see for yourself.

248
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:51,773
Don’t doubt yourself! Just experiment.

249
00:28:51,974 --> 00:28:54,832
First, you used to even doubt if there is
cool breeze or not,

250
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,439
used to think it’s an air conditioner
working in London!

251
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,634
Even [in] London, they used to think there
must be an air conditioner in their head!

252
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:05,919
Now those days are gone!

253
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,918
Now don’t doubt yourself and just go
full ahead

254
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,617
with all the maryadas of Sahaja Yoga.
So the maryada has to be there.

255
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:28,143
Except that the moral maryadas and also
of behavioural maryadas,

256
00:29:28,344 --> 00:29:31,154
there are not many maryadas in Sahaja Yoga.

257
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:34,467
You can do what you like. You can live
the way you like.

258
00:29:34,668 --> 00:29:37,011
You can eat the way you want to eat.

259
00:29:37,212 --> 00:29:42,239
But the main maryada is that you have to be
very moral people, honest, moral people.

260
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:51,310
And, also, you have to be, in a way,
in appearance, in behaviour,

261
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:55,170
such a person that you do not become
obnoxious,

262
00:29:55,371 --> 00:30:00,107
or people don’t think you are queer,
strange people.

263
00:30:00,308 --> 00:30:03,585
To overcome that, we have to dress up
in a way

264
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:08,281
that is rather more appealing to
the general public

265
00:30:08,482 --> 00:30:14,723
and people see us as normal human being
and as not abnormal human beings.

266
00:30:14,924 --> 00:30:18,353
There’s not much to be done outside.
It is the inside

267
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:22,501
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves
fully, to accept ourselves,

268
00:30:22,702 --> 00:30:26,982
to tell ourselves every day that we are
now Maha Yogis

269
00:30:27,183 --> 00:30:29,433
and we have to work it out that way.

270
00:30:29,634 --> 00:30:32,417
Today we have here people from all over
the world

271
00:30:32,618 --> 00:30:35,738
and you go and tell this message to all
the rest of the people,

272
00:30:35,939 --> 00:30:39,876
whom I have not met, that “Mother has
already announced,

273
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:45,157
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all
have become now Maha Yogis.”

274
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:52,859
And try to express that, manifest that
with full confidence in yourself

275
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:57,099
and with this power of love, I am sure
you will all win over.

276
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,278
May God bless you all.

277
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:15,636
There has been nothing written about
Sahasrara before.

278
00:31:15,837 --> 00:31:18,282
In none of the scriptures Sahasrara is
described.

279
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:20,900
Nobody knew anything about Sahasrara.

280
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:24,406
They just left it as the seventh chakra —
finished.

281
00:31:24,607 --> 00:31:29,697
They could only go up to Agnya and nothing
has been written about Sahasrara so far.

282
00:31:29,898 --> 00:31:34,076
And there is no mantras written about
Sahasrara,

283
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:38,537
so we have to now write Sahasrara mantra.

284
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:44,321
It is very surprising that even
the photographs of Sahasraras

285
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:49,721
have appeared now for you to see that
your Sahasraras are opening.

286
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:57,249
And that is something [that] never happened
before in the whole spiritual history

287
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:03,766
and nobody could write about it because
they never saw this Sahasrara.

288
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:10,255
Now, for you, it is important to see that
you have something so unique with you.

289
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,076
But only thing what you need is a courage

290
00:32:15,277 --> 00:32:21,198
and a complete commitment to go forward

291
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:28,634
with this propagation of Sahaja Yoga,
announcement of Sahaja Yoga.
