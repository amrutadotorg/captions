1
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:11,301
In the beginning of course, the meditation takes some time.

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,661
But once you will know what is meditation is,

3
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:18,141
how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me,

4
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:21,981
how we can have a rapport with each other.

5
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:25,821
There’s no need to have anything else in between,

6
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,392
like writing letters or maybe some sort

7
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:32,901
of a special connection, nothing of the kind!

8
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:37,221
Only thing that is needed is the meditation.

9
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:40,661
In meditation you grow.

10
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:43,901
In that spiritually you become higher.

11
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:49,821
And when that happens, you start,

12
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:52,461
in a way, I would say

13
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:58,141
that when you reach a state of

14
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:05,061
that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga,

15
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:08,061
then you don’t want to give up your meditation.

16
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:12,261
Because that time, you are absolutely one with Me.

17
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:16,221
That doesn’t mean for three hours, four hours you should do meditation

18
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:21,301
but it is how much intensely you are with Me is important;

19
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:26,901
now it is not how much time you are with Me.

20
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:29,221
Then I’m responsible for you,

21
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,061
for your children, for everyone.

22
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:35,981
I am responsible for your ascent, for your protection,

23
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:40,741
to save you from all your negativity.

24
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:44,021
So it’s not like a father

25
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,141
who will directly punish you,

26
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:49,141
it’s not that, but it’s just

27
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:54,901
“All right, you are not My relation, I am out.”

28
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:57,661
That’s the only thing that can happen.

29
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:00,061
If you are not meditating, all right,

30
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:03,661
I cannot force you, I have nothing to do with you.

31
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:07,141
You may have other relationship, outside, outward.

32
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:11,661
But this inner relationship, by which you get your benevolence,

33
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:15,981
you cannot have without meditation.

34
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,740
I’ve been telling all of you, please meditate,

35
00:02:18,821 --> 00:02:20,901
please meditate every day.

36
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:24,741
But I think people are also not understanding

37
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:27,301
the importance of what I am saying,

38
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,493
because they tell Me, “Mother, we don’t meditate.”

39
00:02:31,574 --> 00:02:32,741
“Why?”

40
00:02:32,822 --> 00:02:37,062
“Now we are realized soul, so why should we meditate?”

41
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:40,061
Now this instrument is fully made,

42
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:42,901
but if it is not all the time connected for the mains,

43
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:47,581
what’s the use of having it.

44
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:51,741
In that meditation, you will feel the Love,

45
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:54,741
the divine Love, the beauty of that divine Love,

46
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:59,301
a complete panorama changes.

47
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:02,901
A meditative person has a very different attitude,

48
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:05,061
a very different temperament,

49
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:08,581
a very different life and he lives always

50
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:12,710
in complete satisfaction with himself.

51
00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:19,629
You should not just get satisfied with one, or can say,

52
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:24,029
one last drama, or one this thing, one that

53
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,429
But you should have a full oneness

54
00:03:29,589 --> 00:03:31,869
with the Divine, full oneness.

55
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:35,429
And that is possible only if you really meditate,

56
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,309
which is quite a easy thing to do, to meditate is.

57
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:43,589
Some people say, Mother, we cannot get over time,

58
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,189
we cannot think … we are all the time thinking something,

59
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:53,029
or that time we want to see the watch.

60
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:56,189
In the beginning we may have a little problem,

61
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,749
I’m not saying, you may not have, you may have,

62
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:00,749
but that’s only in the beginning.

63
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,029
But gradually you will be all right.

64
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:08,589
Gradually you will master it.

65
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,829
Gradually you will know it so well

66
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:15,189
that you would not like to have anything else

67
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:18,829
of a cheaper type, you wouldn’t care for such a thing.

68
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,669
You see, so to get to your beauty,

69
00:04:23,829 --> 00:04:28,189
to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality

70
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:30,829
which is now exposed,

71
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:34,269
only thing you have to do really religiously

72
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,476
is to meditate.
