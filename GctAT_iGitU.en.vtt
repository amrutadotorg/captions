SY: ...know that we understand our meaning.

00:00:16.734 --> 00:00:18.759
Is a tremendous seeking all over the world,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.096
especially here in North America, so strong.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.342
And of course lots of people are taking advantage of that,

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.680
and exploited it for making money.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.120
The one thing that's obvious is that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.040
none of the previous stages of our evolution

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.999
we had to do any effort or pay any money.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.273
It's just nature working out its process.

00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:46.193
SM: Is it all right this way?

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.446
They can hear Me better like this?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.321
All right?

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.308
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.947
The Truth that we are seeking

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.416
has to manifest in our consciousness.

00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:44.888
It is not a mental projection.

00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:48.585
It's not our imagination.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.666
It has to express itself actually

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:58.107
on our central nervous system.

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:01.239
That is what the Truth is.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.039
For example, you come to this room

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.879
and you see these things,

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.030
and you see them with your own eyes.

00:02:11.608 --> 00:02:14.189
Through your central nervous system

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.945
you know what it is.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.719
If you feel this is aluminium here,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.582
you can feel it whether it is cold or hot.

00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:31.359
On your central nervous system,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.983
on your nerves, you have to feel the Truth.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.829
But we live with mental projections.

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:45.120
All are mental projections I find.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:50.492
We have conceptions about everything

00:02:50.693 --> 00:02:53.959
which can be completely mythical,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.483
absolutely wrong.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.393
We have been building them up one by one;

00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:04.422
like that we have built up,

00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:08.606
so many different varieties of conceptions

00:03:08.807 --> 00:03:13.487
and the people who represent one God and one Truth

00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:18.115
are now fighting on the battlefront.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.113
It's rather surprising for people to see how they talk of God,

00:03:25.314 --> 00:03:30.560
they talk of love, they talk of all that is universal.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.449
Then why do they fight?

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.659
It's a big question today for your young people.

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:42.661
And that is the reason why they suddenly become

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.000
extremely against God, against His existence.

00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:55.239
They cannot believe that there could be a God

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.879
manufactured by our mental projections

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.597
that has led them to this kind of warfare.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.031
That is where we have gone wrong to understand

00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:14.917
that mental projection is not the way to know God.

00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:19.781
For example,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.543
if I start thinking that, "All right, now I am in Houston."

00:04:27.744 --> 00:04:30.759
I am facing people and I'm talking to them.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.738
Do I do that?

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.853
I may not be able to even envisage or understand,

00:04:39.054 --> 00:04:41.919
visualize the hall in which I am,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.929
leave alone the people.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.200
But in My own imagination if I start feeling,

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.439
"This is the Truth, this is the Truth",

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.960
then even the falsehood can become the Truth.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.960
And that is what has happened

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:57.583
to all those people who talked about God.

00:04:59.114 --> 00:05:01.077
It's all their mental projection

00:05:01.278 --> 00:05:04.076
which has led them to these problems.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.840
Once Mahatma Gandhi was asked by some Christians -

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.840
it can be asked about any religion,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.960
it's not only the Christians who are doing that,

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.614
everyone is doing the same stuff  -

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:20.096
that, "Why don't you join? Why don't you become a Christian?"

00:05:20.297 --> 00:05:23.735
He said, "All right, but tell me which church?"

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.359
And if you then

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.553
think about the people who want to unite the churches also,

00:05:29.754 --> 00:05:33.641
what they are uniting is nothing but these mental projections.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.241
And then where do you lie with that mental projection?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.948
So, we have to understand

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:48.280
that in every scripture it has been said

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.839
that you are to be born again.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.240
Now, when you say that you are to be born again -

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.038
in 1970 I came to your great country

00:05:58.665 --> 00:06:01.559
and when I told them about this,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:08.643
then they started a very big campaign, "We are born-again".

00:06:08.844 --> 00:06:11.276
This is all self-certification.

00:06:11.477 --> 00:06:14.840
What is the difference between a person who is born-again

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.325
and who has, who is not born-again?

00:06:18.526 --> 00:06:22.280
You cannot, just by changing your dress or by changing your name

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.452
you can become a born-again.

00:06:24.653 --> 00:06:26.719
Or even a pattern of life

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.200
which is based upon only a mental projection if you change

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.827
you are not a born-again person.

00:06:33.028 --> 00:06:35.536
Born-again means -

00:06:35.737 --> 00:06:39.799
in Sanskrit language a bird is called as "dvijaha",

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.467
meaning the twice-born.

00:06:42.681 --> 00:06:45.159
Bird is called as "dvijaha"

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.325
and a realized soul is also called as "dvijaha",

00:06:49.526 --> 00:06:51.341
means born-again.

00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:55.840
So, a person who is reborn

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.168
has to be a completely a transformed personality -

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:06.003
like an egg becoming the bird.

00:07:06.752 --> 00:07:11.416
What is the similarity between the egg and a bird? Nothing.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.239
That kind of an actual transformation

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.599
is the Truth which one must ask for,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.603
and should not go in for some sort of a plastic transformation,

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.516
which is very easy to do -

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:37.400
you wear one plate around your neck and this, and this.

00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:40.799
Do you become that?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.519
If you say, "I am a Christian", do you become a Christian?

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.422
If you go to a church - why I am, say, telling about Christianity?

00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:50.587
Because that's the main religion here,

00:07:50.788 --> 00:07:53.040
but same thing you can about Hindus;

00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:57.117
you can say about every religion just the same.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.759
So, somebody comes and puts water on your head

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.040
and says, "Now, I have given you the baptism."

00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:08.160
But is that the real baptism?

00:08:08.993 --> 00:08:12.560
What is the living process that has taken place

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.604
in a person who is baptized?

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.707
We must face it

00:08:19.908 --> 00:08:21.559
and that facing is difficult

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.720
because we have built those mental projections

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.280
and we want to live with the mental projections,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.106
and our ego does not allow us to see the point at all.

00:08:32.307 --> 00:08:34.080
But who is the loser?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.801
Not God. It's you.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.372
You are the loser who want to live and satisfy yourself

00:08:42.573 --> 00:08:45.197
with those mental projections.

00:08:48.595 --> 00:08:52.848
Now, one has to go beyond the mental projection.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.479
And how do you do?

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.718
How are you triggered out into that space

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:02.199
where you are beyond thoughts

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.879
and you are completely aware?

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.640
Something has to happen within ourselves,

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.026
a living thing, just like a ...

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.644
an egg becoming the bird.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.584
In the many rituals that we do

00:09:23.785 --> 00:09:26.728
there's the hand of the Unconscious that guides us.

00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:31.919
For example, on an Easter Day we give an egg.

00:09:32.124 --> 00:09:36.328
I think many people don't know why we give an Easter egg.

00:09:36.529 --> 00:09:38.999
The reason is, that is suggestive,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.400
that you are an egg and you have to become the bird,

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.479
because Christ, by His ascent has proved

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:52.503
that you can transform into that subtler dimension.

00:09:53.816 --> 00:09:57.577
But it is an actualization of the whole happening.

00:09:57.778 --> 00:10:01.999
It is not just some sort of a false understanding,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.039
and this is what people don't want to get out of it.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.759
The reason is it's very comfortable to belong to one clan.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.120
Only thing, either it is a Friday for Muslims

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.320
or for Christian the Sunday,

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.680
or for Hindus the Tuesday,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.479
one day at the most you have to get ready,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.109
go to the church, temple or mosque as their case may be,

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.432
and then it is finished.

00:10:27.633 --> 00:10:30.800
You have done all your duty towards your Creator

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.154
and that you have listened to some sort of a boring lecture,

00:10:35.355 --> 00:10:37.880
and it's done. That's what it is.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.329
That's what it amounts to be,

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:42.451
but it is not so.

00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:45.239
Something has to happen within us

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.377
when they said that you have to be reborn.

00:10:51.544 --> 00:10:55.051
How much human beings can live with myth?

00:10:55.252 --> 00:10:57.079
Is the limit!

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.159
I mean, the way they live with mythical things and falsehood

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.453
is really, cannot be explained.

00:11:05.654 --> 00:11:09.400
The way they go on with it, for ages now,

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.239
one generation, two generation, ten generations, twenty generations.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.240
They are going on like this with that mythical idea,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.625
and they are becoming worse and worse and worse,

00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:24.623
full of fanaticism which is a disease.

00:11:24.824 --> 00:11:28.213
So now, if you cannot hold your fork properly

00:11:28.414 --> 00:11:30.120
and your knife properly,

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.319
you are out of the club.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.278
It's like that, is that superficial.

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:38.376
The whole stuff is so superficial.

00:11:38.577 --> 00:11:42.400
So, one has to come to a point to understand

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.328
that all this is not God at all.

00:11:45.529 --> 00:11:48.583
It's just talk, talk, talk and talk.

00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:50.960
People will have conferences,

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.639
they'll have big-big seminars,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.034
and what will come out of it will be

00:11:56.235 --> 00:11:59.822
what are we going to spend for the building fund.

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:04.461
Supposed to be for God's sake.

00:12:04.828 --> 00:12:06.624
Like yesterday I told you

00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:10.520
that when bishop of Canterbury,

00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:14.520
archbishop of Canterbury, was asked - on a TV it was happening -

00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:16.640
that, "What is Holy Ghost?"

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.239
He said, "I am very agnostic about it".

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.731
That means he doesn't believe in God, just imagine.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.308
So, the interviewer asked, "Then how are you there?"

00:12:27.864 --> 00:12:30.685
So he said, "I'm doing my job".

00:12:30.886 --> 00:12:32.786
Then what job is he doing there?

00:12:32.987 --> 00:12:35.855
I saw it with My own eyes, I would not have believed it.

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:38.159
But what is your job then?

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.640
If you do not believe and you cannot explain what is the Holy Ghost,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.199
then how do you bless people?

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.179
That, "In the name of the Holy Ghost I want to bless."

00:12:50.513 --> 00:12:53.968
But we accept it, closed-minded we accept it.

00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:58.238
Because they say, "It's, it's, it's a mystery."

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.960
"It's a mystery". But it is not.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.797
Use your logic a little bit.

00:13:02.998 --> 00:13:06.030
It cannot be a mystery. Use your logic.

00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:08.134
That's how you have missed the point

00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:10.280
that you have not used your logic

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.400
but you have used your rationality

00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:16.869
to build up all these yarns and get entangled into it.

00:13:17.694 --> 00:13:20.719
Now, what is the Holy Ghost? Let's see that.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.119
You have the Father

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.982
and you have the Son.

00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:29.120
And you have the Holy Ghost, but not the Mother.

00:13:29.321 --> 00:13:34.055
Now, can you tell Me of a father getting a son without a mother?

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.192
Simple common sense.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.879
Absolutely a simple common sense.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:45.520
My father who was a very learned man

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.438
and I should say in a way he was My guru

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:52.120
because he told Me about human beings, how absurd they are

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.919
and he explained to Me why they behave like this,

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:03.322
he told Me that they try to avoid the name of the Mother

00:14:03.523 --> 00:14:08.926
because the Muslims may feel hesitant to join Christianity.

00:14:09.744 --> 00:14:13.651
But Martin Luther himself was a realized soul

00:14:13.852 --> 00:14:17.440
but poor thing, he must have been pressed by everyone,

00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:20.128
"Oh, baba, don't say like this".

00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:26.520
He could not think that it will go on forever.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.016
He thought once Christianity is established,

00:14:29.217 --> 00:14:32.696
people will be able to say about the Mother.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.999
And this is what I am here to tell you

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.072
that it was the manifestation of the Father,

00:14:43.273 --> 00:14:47.732
then of the Son, and then of the Holy Ghost - the Mother.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.354
Surprisingly, only in India people accept that.

00:14:52.555 --> 00:14:57.358
For them Holy Ghost is nobody else but they call Her as Adi Shakti.

00:14:59.855 --> 00:15:02.280
And any incarnation they talk of,

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:08.759
first they take the name of the Shakti, the power, the Mother.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.315
They will not take the name of the Father.

00:15:11.516 --> 00:15:14.658
First the Mother, and then the Father.

00:15:15.589 --> 00:15:18.555
Now, when we talk of the motherhood

00:15:18.756 --> 00:15:22.784
we have to know that it is this motherhood

00:15:22.985 --> 00:15:25.680
which is going to nourish.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.839
It is this motherhood

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.263
which is going to soothe.

00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:34.282
And this is the motherhood about which Christ has said,

00:15:34.483 --> 00:15:36.273
"I will send you the Holy Ghost".

00:15:36.474 --> 00:15:38.960
He didn't say, "I have finished, nobody is going to come."

00:15:39.161 --> 00:15:42.255
He clearly said, "I will send you the Holy Ghost,

00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:45.209
the Counselor, the Redeemer".

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.996
All these things, He has said it clearly.

00:15:50.197 --> 00:15:53.578
But we do not want to see that.

00:15:53.779 --> 00:15:56.500
We prefer Christ, because He's no more.

00:15:56.701 --> 00:16:01.532
Because when He was there, we preferred Moses.

00:16:04.924 --> 00:16:08.032
And when Moses came, we preferred Abraham

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:11.080
because it's very easy to handle the situation.

00:16:11.408 --> 00:16:12.590
They are in your pocket.

00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:15.338
Whenever you want you can take it, "Oh, that is Christ!"

00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:17.685
All right, so it's selling in the market very well.

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:20.382
It's the market issue.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.159
So, when Christ said

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.599
that, "I will send you the Holy Ghost,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.959
and that Holy Ghost is going to comfort you,

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.400
redeem you, and council you",

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.920
what about looking forward to that?

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.280
Nobody bothered about it

00:16:42.481 --> 00:16:44.840
because it was too much beyond the ego of people.

00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:47.919
They just don't want to see that point.

00:16:49.793 --> 00:16:51.759
Now, this motherhood

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:57.635
is represented here as the Kundalini, in the triangular bone,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.679
which is the Mother.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.159
It's called as the Kundalini because "kundala" means

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.679
the coils, it is coiled up.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:13.452
And this is the Mother within you.

00:17:13.653 --> 00:17:18.199
This is the Mother that is existing within you,

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.364
is there all the time, and She is the one

00:17:21.565 --> 00:17:23.839
who is going to give you the re-birth.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:29.199
She is the reflection of the primordial Holy Ghost.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.673
And She is the one who is going to give you

00:17:32.874 --> 00:17:37.814
this second birth which is expected.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.935
So far it has been as I told you,

00:17:42.136 --> 00:17:45.920
the manifestation of the Father and of the Son.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:49.027
And the tree of life

00:17:49.228 --> 00:17:51.963
has grown outside too much.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.641
The development, the science,

00:17:55.842 --> 00:17:59.800
all these has created what? The monsters of bombs.

00:18:00.368 --> 00:18:02.920
Nobody could stop it.

00:18:04.503 --> 00:18:05.799
Why not?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.040
Because they could only move on one side - outside.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.600
They were moving outside

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.247
and they found the big tree grown

00:18:16.448 --> 00:18:18.439
without growing to the source.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:21.880
And now the time has come for you to go to the source

00:18:22.088 --> 00:18:26.157
and that source is this one, is the Kundalini.

00:18:29.625 --> 00:18:32.439
She is the subtle energy within us

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.383
which manifests outside

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:39.083
the motherly qualities in you.

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.839
Now, you may say that the man is the one

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.879
and the women are now having a feminist movement.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.724
That's one of the expressions.

00:18:49.925 --> 00:18:51.959
But the feminist movement

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.040
is not what I am talking about.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:59.280
Is very mislead, is another kind of a religious, mental projection.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.360
The feminist movement is

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.239
like a pendulum movement of your consciousness.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.120
Like, a woman wants to become a man,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.960
man has to become like a woman,

00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:12.279
and the fight going on.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.839
I'm not talking about a rebellion at all.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.839
I'm talking of a revolution.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.999
And the revolution has to take place where

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:26.399
you move spirally higher than what you are,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.239
not in a pendulum from one to another end.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.719
So this new consciousness of motherhood

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.359
has to manifest.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:38.160
And when this new consciousness will manifest

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.800
you will see a man will be changed

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.680
into a compassionate, kind,

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.919
soothing and nourishing personality.

00:19:49.135 --> 00:19:51.760
It is for woman as well as for man.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:57.319
The whole, entire idea of competition, of domination,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.254
of occupying others territory,

00:20:00.455 --> 00:20:04.800
all these has gone too far of the manly qualities.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.436
They have crossed all the limits.

00:20:06.637 --> 00:20:10.360
Imagine, to come to some country, occupy it,

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:13.640
throw away all the people, kill them nicely,

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.710
is it a sign of a good person?

00:20:19.287 --> 00:20:22.119
Is it good to do these things to anyone?

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.240
Somebody, somebody comes into your house

00:20:24.441 --> 00:20:27.280
who is a very mighty person with a gun

00:20:27.481 --> 00:20:30.559
and throws you out of your house, and settles down nicely.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.807
What will you call him? A very nice person?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.162
All these things have been  so far.

00:20:37.363 --> 00:20:39.119
We have had enough of this.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.699
Now, what do we want?

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.599
People, who are compassionate.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.160
Really compassionate,

00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:49.123
not just talking of love and making money out of it.

00:20:50.391 --> 00:20:55.399
But the one who can emit compassion, like Christ did.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.760
What was Christ?

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.204
Did He compete with anyone?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.692
He was nothing but compassion. It used to just flow from His being.

00:21:03.893 --> 00:21:07.169
A lady touched Him and she got cured.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.508
Such people we have to create who will emit compassion.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.000
So all these centers as he said - is the Vishuddhi chakra

00:21:16.201 --> 00:21:17.960
which is very important as he said

00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:23.521
is a center represented in the universe -

00:21:23.722 --> 00:21:26.520
your country, America, represents that.

00:21:26.721 --> 00:21:28.960
Is a very important center,

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.239
is a completion, where the human beings raised their heads up,

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.009
is a very, very important center.

00:21:37.247 --> 00:21:39.399
But where are they?

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.106
I don't think they find that responsibility within themselves.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.079
Now, what is the responsibility?

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:51.592
Is that at that center you feel

00:21:53.320 --> 00:22:01.210
that there is nobody who is the other.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.440
That means you feel the collective consciousness. You actualize it.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.519
It's not just a lecture, "You are all brothers and sisters."

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.174
It's again mental projection.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.479
We say brothers and sisters. Even husband and wife,

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.359
any relationship,

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.720
it just breaks like that because it is mental projection.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.637
But it becomes actualization within you

00:22:25.764 --> 00:22:30.635
when you become collectively conscious. You become that.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.742
That means you start feeling others within yourself.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:43.640
You don't have to think that, "I am trying to do good work

00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:45.640
or missionary work

00:22:45.841 --> 00:22:49.017
and I am going to sort of  build some churches

00:22:49.218 --> 00:22:53.959
or some sort of a place for the poor to come and live."

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.401
Who is the other?

00:22:58.375 --> 00:23:00.719
You are doing for yourself.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.584
It's just for yourself you are doing.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.319
If I help this finger of Mine

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:09.602
am I doing any good to this finger

00:23:09.737 --> 00:23:11.291
or am I obliging this finger?

00:23:11.492 --> 00:23:14.239
Is there any obligation on this finger?

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.359
It's paining, I have to sooth it,

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.093
because it's part and parcel of Me.

00:23:20.202 --> 00:23:22.479
Because it is part and parcel of Me,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:26.815
how can it thank Me or how can I feel that I have obliged it?

00:23:27.032 --> 00:23:30.127
How can I have ego about it?

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.680
Because it is just My part and parcel.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.600
So what you have to become

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.386
is to become part and parcel of the whole.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:45.399
As they say, "The microcosm has to become the macrocosm."

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.879
A drop has to become the ocean.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.400
Has to become, again, I say, the becoming is the important part.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.352
It's not the lecture. This you must have heard from many people,

00:23:55.553 --> 00:23:58.689
"We all must become saintly". How?

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.879
Ask them. How do we become saintly?

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.959
By putting one red mark here can I become saintly?

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.720
Or by wearing some sort of a dress

00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:12.128
which can be colored in three dollars,

00:24:12.311 --> 00:24:14.422
can I become saintly?

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.199
Let's face it up.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.840
There must be something happening within us

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.840
that makes us saintly despite ourselves.

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.919
We just become.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.520
So that happening is the thing here

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.479
which is called as

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.479
the awakening within us.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.120
Now this power is the power

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.599
of your pure desire,

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.634
true desire, pure desire.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.359
All other desires are impure,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.039
because they don't give you satisfaction,

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:55.879
they don't give you the ultimate.

00:24:56.087 --> 00:24:58.359
Take any desire. Say, you want to have a house.

00:24:58.534 --> 00:24:59.999
All right, have it.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.366
Then you want to have a car.

00:25:02.676 --> 00:25:03.618
All right, have it.

00:25:03.819 --> 00:25:06.719
Then you want to have an airplane, I don't know how it goes on.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.840
That's why in economics it is said

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.106
that wants in general are not satiable.

00:25:11.307 --> 00:25:13.416
They are very honest, is... that's fact.

00:25:13.617 --> 00:25:17.839
But there's one want within us which is satiable,

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.258
and that's the true want.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.920
To become one with the Divine,

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:28.971
to become one with God,

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.160
to enter into the Kingdom of God

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:38.120
is the only true desire within us

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.679
and is sleeping in that triangular bone called as sacrum.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.120
I would like to point out, the word sacrum means sacred,

00:25:46.321 --> 00:25:48.079
that means Greek knew about it.

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.595
This is the Greek word and they called it sacrum.

00:25:50.796 --> 00:25:54.039
Why don't we think why did they call it a sacrum?

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.120
They could have called it by any other name.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:02.919
That means it is a sacred power of pure desire

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.560
that resides in it.

00:26:04.761 --> 00:26:06.119
And this is what,

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.960
that is the reason in Sanskrit language it is called as Mooladhara.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.560
Mooladhara means

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:16.679
is the support of the root. This is the root.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.160
And this is the support of the root.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.359
The center that is below this

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.559
is the center which manifests it,

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.039
is the center of our innocence.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.080
When we were material beings

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.079
or when till we reached the carbon stage

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.584
we were having only this center within us.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:46.228
And this center is the center of our innocence.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.066
And the deity that rules the center

00:26:49.267 --> 00:26:53.880
is the one who embodies innocence within us.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.542
You can see it very clearly that the center of innocence

00:26:59.743 --> 00:27:02.507
is below the Kundalini.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.999
It is below the Kundalini.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.476
That means the Kundalini doesn't pierce through this.

00:27:11.677 --> 00:27:15.159
That means this center supports the Kundalini,

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.640
but the Kundalini rises above this center,

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.125
that means sex has nothing to do with your ascent.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.009
That means you cannot achieve your ascent through sex.

00:27:28.627 --> 00:27:32.864
This kind of a myth has been on and on in the West,

00:27:33.065 --> 00:27:36.199
but in India nobody is going to believe such stories.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.319
Because they are not so naive.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.896
Here Mr. Freud - I don't know what to call him,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.880
you may call him whatever name you like -

00:27:47.081 --> 00:27:49.560
he is responsible for giving you AIDS.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.415
Please, send him some letters of thanks.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.759
He is the one who has given you.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.868
And the way you accepted him, you denied Christ.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:06.799
Christ had said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes".

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.840
Not only the adulterous behaviour

00:28:10.041 --> 00:28:14.720
but even the eyes should be innocent if you are a Christian.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.425
Which church has achieved that, I would like to know.

00:28:21.057 --> 00:28:23.255
That is what He asked for

00:28:23.456 --> 00:28:26.719
that, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes".

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.399
That's only possible when the Kundalini

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.320
passes through that center of Christ and awakens Him,

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.200
your innocence is awakened in your eyes,

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:39.199
and you really have innocent eyes.

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.157
This is what has to happen.

00:28:43.358 --> 00:28:47.959
But actually whatever has happened you know how far we have gone

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.400
with our ideas of licentiousness and permissiveness,

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.960
and our perversion,

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.320
thanks to mister Freud

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.283
who was the real guru of the western people to begin with.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.759
There was only one person who was Jung,

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.999
who was a sensible man.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.680
He talked of sensible things because he got his Realization,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.239
but nobody has accepted them much.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.306
In the whole of England we have only 12 Jungians.

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.159
And the other day I happened to meet about hundred of them

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.559
in New York.

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.477
And I was amazed at their quality of mind,

00:29:28.678 --> 00:29:32.160
the way they understood the whole subject of Kundalini awakening,

00:29:32.361 --> 00:29:34.000
and that the time has come

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.600
for this nourishment to work out within us.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.694
I was amazed at their brilliance.

00:29:39.895 --> 00:29:44.159
You have to have basically some intelligence to understand,

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:48.559
and not your ego which just repels you back all the time,

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.200
takes you away from the Truth.

00:29:50.401 --> 00:29:51.960
But have your intelligence,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.280
your pure intelligence to understand

00:29:54.481 --> 00:29:57.200
that you have not achieved anything so far

00:29:57.401 --> 00:30:00.985
so there has been some mistake, let's see what it is.

00:30:03.112 --> 00:30:07.280
And they did, and they all got realized, you'll be amazed.

00:30:07.481 --> 00:30:11.359
And the president of the organization who was the...

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:16.340
who was 82 years old, and who is a Jew, got up,

00:30:16.541 --> 00:30:19.560
With such humility he said that, "Mother,

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:23.619
You know our language of psychology, which is a child science.

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.447
Now we have to learn Your language

00:30:27.648 --> 00:30:30.520
which is the greatest of all."

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.543
Just imagine, for him to get up and say that.

00:30:33.744 --> 00:30:36.635
But hardly you find people of that quality.

00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:40.959
I thank Jung that he created at least hundred people in this country

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.135
who could understand what I am talking about.

00:30:46.981 --> 00:30:52.355
Now, so we have within ourselves this center

00:30:52.556 --> 00:30:55.519
which is responsible for our innocence,

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.960
and when we play about with it too much

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.959
we fall into traps of diseases.

00:31:01.185 --> 00:31:04.491
It is very easy to understand for us

00:31:04.699 --> 00:31:10.368
by our own natural instinct what is wrong and what is right.

00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:13.148
But even if you avoid all your naturalness

00:31:13.349 --> 00:31:17.759
with your all your artificiality and try all artificial methods

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.923
still you'll be amazed

00:31:20.124 --> 00:31:24.238
that those people who lead this kind of life, have always suffered.

00:31:24.439 --> 00:31:29.520
At every port, if you travel, there is a free clinic

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.759
for people who suffer from these dirty diseases.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.607
It has been there since long, for all the sailors.

00:31:36.808 --> 00:31:38.800
But the sailors don't understand

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.280
that we must be doing something very wrong

00:31:41.481 --> 00:31:43.432
to get this kind of a disease.

00:31:43.633 --> 00:31:47.836
Why do we suffer from such a disease? So that

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.239
we have done something wrong

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.040
or something we have gone against the nature.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:58.919
When you go against the nature, you get diseases.

00:31:59.127 --> 00:32:02.118
That's a simple thing, is to go against the nature

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:03.960
is the way you get diseases.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.600
And you must understand your own nature,

00:32:06.801 --> 00:32:09.306
and integrate with the nature outside -

00:32:09.507 --> 00:32:11.759
you will never get a disease.

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.314
And when you get a disease,

00:32:13.515 --> 00:32:17.933
understand that nature is punishing you and teaching you.

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:28.999
Secondly, this is the biggest achievement in Sahaja Yoga

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:35.484
that people who have suffered on account of their misdeeds

00:32:35.685 --> 00:32:38.239
very much, in every way

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:39.999
have been cured.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.560
Once the Kundalini rises, they get cured completely

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.999
of all these horrible diseases

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.960
which are hidden, which are always kept as secrets.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:55.839
They can be easily cured if your Kundalini could be awakened.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:00.839
But those who have problems in this center are the most difficult

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:07.841
because this center is the one which communicates

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.599
everything that happens within us.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.479
The left-side line that you see here, the blue line,

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:18.239
is the one that collects all the information,

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.771
called as the Ida Nadi, which manifest outside

00:33:22.972 --> 00:33:25.799
the left sympathetic nervous system.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.320
And it passes all that information to this center

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.079
and this center passes all the information

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:40.482
to the Kundalini which is like a tape in a tape recorder

00:33:40.683 --> 00:33:43.079
and tapes all that you have done.

00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.440
All the wrong and the good, the imbalances,

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.816
and all the nonsense you have done is recorded in this Kundalini.

00:33:52.764 --> 00:33:56.159
Some people think no end of themselves, I've seen them.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:00.239
But when I look at their Kundalini, I feel like crying.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.917
The poor Kundalini is like a dead personality,

00:34:04.118 --> 00:34:08.559
is like a dead snake trying to rise, trying to raise its head.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.646
It's impossible for the poor Kundalini to rise

00:34:11.847 --> 00:34:16.960
because you have neglected all that is noble, all that is kindness,

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:21.520
all that is righteous and auspicious.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.999
We have forgotten the word sacred at all, completely.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.800
We have forgotten the word sacred,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.559
we have forgotten the word that is chastity,

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:35.468
as if it was something foolish to talk about these things.

00:34:35.706 --> 00:34:39.919
Now, when people start suffering, you start reflecting back.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.960
Now the new organizations have started I have seen

00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:44.679
with a result of that,

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.200
that they think now you should lead a very chaste life,

00:34:47.401 --> 00:34:48.995
one man, one woman and all that.

00:34:49.196 --> 00:34:51.760
We have in India the same thing - one man, one woman

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.359
but have we solved the problem? We have not.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.516
That's just a temporary thing

00:34:56.717 --> 00:34:59.879
by which you cannot solve... At the most you may solve one center

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.359
but what about the other six centers?

00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.159
What about them? They still exist to be solved.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:12.160
And these six centers are very difficult in certain places

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.328
according to the way and style of life you have.

00:35:16.844 --> 00:35:19.759
Now the second center that we have, actually,

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.760
is the center that comes out of the third center,

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.759
so you can change it, the number, doesn't matter.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.715
This center is the center of our creativity

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.969
by which we go into action.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.679
The activity.

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:36.439
The colour is that of the bile.

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.079
You see the bile colour existing.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.839
When you are very active the bile starts acting,

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.759
and your liver becomes overactive.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.960
When the liver is overactive you start feeling like vomiting,

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.199
and you always feel very bad,

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.440
and you feel there's something wrong here,

00:35:55.641 --> 00:35:59.959
and all your attention is all the time in a very unhappy state.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.199
This is because of your overactivity.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.913
That's not the only thing that happens to you

00:36:06.114 --> 00:36:08.240
with the overactivity of this center

00:36:08.441 --> 00:36:13.199
because this subtle center does some more than that.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:20.079
It has to look after other, other activities also,

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:26.559
that is of the spleen, and the pancreas, and the kidneys,

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:30.440
and the part of the intestines,

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:37.756
also you can say part of the uterus.

00:36:38.665 --> 00:36:42.534
Now, when you start using this center too much

00:36:42.735 --> 00:36:49.760
what happens to you that you start neglecting these centers.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.294
Where do we use this center maximum?

00:36:53.495 --> 00:36:55.960
When we think too much,

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:01.423
the Grey cells in the brain have to be replaced.

00:37:01.624 --> 00:37:04.119
And who replaces them?

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.089
The centers from your stomach

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:13.547
which is this center which manifests the aortic plexus

00:37:13.748 --> 00:37:18.320
converts or transforms the fat cells from the stomach

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.672
for the use of the grey cells.

00:37:20.873 --> 00:37:22.927
And when you start thinking too much,

00:37:23.128 --> 00:37:26.359
when you are futuristic, you are planning too much,

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:31.439
then the whole extreme behaviour puts you out of gear.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.840
And that's how you start developing all these problems.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.000
So, with the liver, you develop an active liver -

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:42.519
you cannot sleep, you feel like vomiting, you can't eat,

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.870
you grow very thin,

00:37:45.071 --> 00:37:46.720
you can be very hot-tempered.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.987
Such people can be very irritable. At the slightest thing -

00:37:50.188 --> 00:37:52.760
and I see that in the car when they are moving -

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.879
slightest thing and they start honking.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.800
They are very irritable,

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.080
they have no patience for anything,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.245
they are very angry people,

00:38:01.446 --> 00:38:04.014
hot-tempered, aggressive.

00:38:06.257 --> 00:38:10.599
All other these things suffer, so you get diabetes.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.608
If you are not very hot-tempered

00:38:12.809 --> 00:38:14.694
if you don't know how to give vent to it

00:38:14.895 --> 00:38:16.479
then you get diabetes,

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.486
you develop diabetic temperament with this right-sidedness.

00:38:20.687 --> 00:38:24.489
Those who are overactive people mostly get diabetes.

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:26.862
The reason is they cannot show their temper.

00:38:27.063 --> 00:38:30.080
If they are in the business, they have to be very sweet with everyone

00:38:30.281 --> 00:38:32.319
and there's a temper burning inside.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.999
They have to be extremely, say,

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.470
good and very gentlemanly, otherwise they'll lose the money.

00:38:40.458 --> 00:38:43.839
So the temper is inside, all boiling up.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.360
Here you have to be very nice.

00:38:45.561 --> 00:38:48.006
At the back you may say all kinds of abuses.

00:38:48.207 --> 00:38:51.336
But outside you have to be extremely sweet.

00:38:51.537 --> 00:38:55.718
And that time, what to do? You get this horrible diabetes

00:38:55.919 --> 00:39:00.890
because your pancreas gets out of order.

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.720
Then the third thing that happens which is a very,
very serious thing,

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.599
which is very serious, very common in your country

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.559
is leukemia.

00:39:11.742 --> 00:39:13.759
And that takes place as a result

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.239
of a very hectic spleen.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.930
Spleen in you is the speedometer.

00:39:22.285 --> 00:39:26.123
And when a person - say, for example, our modern life is such:

00:39:26.324 --> 00:39:30.760
we sleep, I mean we drink first of all, nicely spoil our liver,

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.599
see to it that it is completely spoiled.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.199
Then we take some drugs to sleep.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.519
Then we cannot get up in the morning

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:41.079
because there are hangovers, naturally.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:46.081
So we get up about the time when the birds are about to retire;

00:39:46.454 --> 00:39:48.919
say about nine o'clock or so.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:53.087
Then we somehow get into our clothes if possible

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.032
and rush to the car,

00:39:57.233 --> 00:39:59.406
start driving, the wife brings the food,

00:39:59.607 --> 00:40:03.188
one, somethings like a sandwich or whatever it is,

00:40:03.389 --> 00:40:05.519
putting that in the mouth you are driving.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.159
There's a jam on the road, so we are cursing everyone.

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:11.973
And here we are eating food, we are cursing people,

00:40:12.174 --> 00:40:13.680
we are thinking about the office,

00:40:13.881 --> 00:40:16.199
all kinds of emergencies at the same time.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.560
At one emergency only

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.011
this poor spleen has to work so hard

00:40:21.212 --> 00:40:23.905
to produce the blood cells.

00:40:24.559 --> 00:40:27.799
And when you put so many emergencies on that

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.510
you can imagine, the poor spleen, what can happen to it.

00:40:31.711 --> 00:40:35.720
It just goes... It doesn't know what to do, it becomes crazy.

00:40:36.488 --> 00:40:39.328
You are crazy and the spleen is crazy.

00:40:39.529 --> 00:40:41.400
And the parents who are like that

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.414
give their trouble to their children,

00:40:44.615 --> 00:40:47.120
because they make their children very funny too:

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:49.446
"You must sit here, you must eat like this."

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:51.879
"This is carpet is spoiled. Now, better clean it".

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.319
The carpet is more important than the child.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.046
If the carpet is not cleaned out then the parents

00:40:57.247 --> 00:40:59.174
will beat the child, do all kinds of things,

00:40:59.375 --> 00:41:02.629
always make the child so tensed

00:41:03.612 --> 00:41:07.252
that the child feels all the time edged up.

00:41:07.453 --> 00:41:10.015
He doesn't know what to do, you see, all the time

00:41:10.216 --> 00:41:12.485
the poor spleen of a child is this thing.

00:41:12.686 --> 00:41:15.520
Even when the child is not born,

00:41:15.721 --> 00:41:17.599
the pregnant mother -

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.040
mothers are so upset all the time.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.119
With what are you upset?

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.720
"Oh, you know, this,

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.880
the milkman came, and this happened, and that happened,

00:41:28.081 --> 00:41:30.360
the telephone came at the same time and

00:41:30.561 --> 00:41:34.263
here it is, I had to receive somebody and there's a bill..."

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.680
All these modern things just make the women crazy,

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.439
worse than the men sometimes

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.519
because they can't bear it.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:45.320
And then, at that time, the child gets the problem

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:48.756
and that's how they are born with leukemia.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.796
Just imagine,

00:41:51.995 --> 00:41:56.423
it is such a simple thing to lead a life of simplicity.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.799
You need not be that complicated.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.999
What is the need to be that complicated, I don't understand.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.333
All these complications we human beings have made, isn't it?

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.079
Like, now I'm wearing a sari

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:16.006
then I must have a matching blouse, I must have a matching shoe,

00:42:16.207 --> 00:42:19.591
I must have a matching purse, I must have My matching hair,

00:42:19.792 --> 00:42:21.739
matching eyebrows, matching everything

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.149
If it is not matching, then I'm nervous.

00:42:28.582 --> 00:42:31.880
All these stupid norms we have created,

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.203
just to make ourselves miserable for nothing at all.

00:42:35.404 --> 00:42:38.003
So the young people decided, "Oh, get out of it,

00:42:38.204 --> 00:42:42.559
this is all nonsense, so let's have anti-culture."

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.199
That's another extreme.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.477
Take drugs. Imagine,

00:42:46.678 --> 00:42:50.496
to compensate for this madness, take to another madness.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.159
Like one boy came to see Me

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.109
and he was all smelling, you see,

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.159
had all lices in the head,

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.852
with hair like that,

00:42:59.053 --> 00:43:02.359
son of a very rich man, I knew about.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.665
Horrible, you see, could not make him sit in the drawing room,

00:43:05.866 --> 00:43:08.879
[as he was] smelling like a dirty pig, I tell you.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.680
And I asked him, "My child",

00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:13.080
- because I knew the father very well, a very well-off man,

00:43:13.281 --> 00:43:15.376
he's a managing director of a very big shipping company.

00:43:15.577 --> 00:43:18.039
I said, "Why are you like this? What is the matter with you?

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.080
Why can't you be normal?"

00:43:20.281 --> 00:43:23.639
He said, "I am trying to become primitive".

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.199
I said, "Why?"

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:27.199
"Because they are simple people".

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.079
But I said, "Your brain is not simple.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.894
It is a modern brain. By growing hair like that

00:43:33.095 --> 00:43:36.319
and putting lices in your head, you don't become primitive.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.999
It is absolutely outside.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:42.800
This is not the way you are going to be a simple person

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.560
by - you see, he was wearing pants with cuts in that and all that.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.000
I said, "By this, how are you going to cut your brain

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.706
which is so modern, which is so complicated,

00:43:53.907 --> 00:43:56.119
which is thinking all the time about the future.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.248
This is all outside, don't you see this?

00:43:58.449 --> 00:43:59.960
And you have become so horrid

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:03.501
that you cannot meet normal people at all".

00:44:03.702 --> 00:44:05.903
So I made him going to the bathroom, have a bath,

00:44:06.104 --> 00:44:08.202
I gave him a change and made him a proper person,

00:44:08.403 --> 00:44:10.000
and then I gave him Realization.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.840
Now he is a normal person,

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.760
given up all his drugs, everything.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.960
He is a normal man, behaving all right.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.978
But sometimes they come in a coma.

00:44:19.194 --> 00:44:22.369
And still with that mental projection that they have become primitive

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:26.186
they said, "We are very happy. Let us die like this."

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:31.240
They are waiting for their doomsday. Most of them tell us,

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.189
"Oh, the doom has to come in any case.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.960
That will solve all our problems."

00:44:37.161 --> 00:44:40.320
Look at this. From this to that madness. I cannot understand.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:44.640
Is a very common thing these days that, "The doomsday has to come

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.520
and we are all going to be solved."

00:44:46.721 --> 00:44:48.840
You see, they are all going to be taken up like this

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.469
and put in the God's Kingdom because they have become primitive.

00:44:53.683 --> 00:44:54.879
This is the idea.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.920
There are some who believe that if they are preaching,

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.399
if they are talking big about God, they will be there.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.719
Christ has said very clearly,

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.883
"You will be calling Me, 'Christ, Christ!' and I will not know you".

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.999
Do we think about it? Why did He say so?

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.080
So, don't live in a mythical world.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.759
Come to reality and face it,

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.159
that you are to be born again,

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.720
that Kundalini has to be awakened,

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.280
and that you have to feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.560
out of your head and out of your hands.

00:45:30.617 --> 00:45:33.205
This is the first time you feel the All-Pervading Power

00:45:33.406 --> 00:45:35.679
as I told you yesterday.

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.759
Now I met all kinds.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:42.282
So, there is one fellow very ego-oriented, came to Me.

00:45:42.483 --> 00:45:44.440
He got Realization luckily somehow,

00:45:44.641 --> 00:45:47.120
his ego, the balloon, went down and he got Realization.

00:45:47.321 --> 00:45:49.620
I was amazed. How?

00:45:49.821 --> 00:45:52.200
The Divine is so anxious to give Realization

00:45:52.401 --> 00:45:54.538
that this fellow came with such a big balloon

00:45:54.739 --> 00:45:57.803
and how it has reduced. It reduced really I must say.

00:45:58.004 --> 00:46:01.236
He got Realization. But then it came back again.

00:46:01.437 --> 00:46:04.759
Because it was just there for a while, again it came back.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.788
So he says, "Mother, why You are the one who has to do it?"

00:46:07.989 --> 00:46:11.280
I said, "My son, you do it. I'll be very happy.

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.378
Should I change My seat with you?

00:46:13.579 --> 00:46:16.179
I'll be very happy if you come and do it yourself.

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.471
That's the best thing that you can do to Me is to do the job.

00:46:19.672 --> 00:46:21.826
But only thing, you will have to awaken

00:46:22.027 --> 00:46:25.280
the Kundalini of thousands of people at a time

00:46:25.481 --> 00:46:28.319
which is like a mountain being lifted with a finger.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.239
That's one only thing you have to do.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.080
Secondly, you have to know all about it

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.280
and you have to tell people what it is,

00:46:35.481 --> 00:46:38.159
all the complications, all the decoding and everything

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.800
and you have to have tremendous patience

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:45.119
with people who have this big balloon on their heads."

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.996
So then he sat down, he wouldn't accept it.

00:46:48.197 --> 00:46:50.799
I said, "What I get out of it?

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.880
Why do you feel so hurt if it is Me?

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.241
I don't know, really, even to handle a camera,

00:46:56.442 --> 00:46:58.357
I don't know so many things that you know.

00:46:58.558 --> 00:47:00.759
I don't  know how to drive. I never feel hurt.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.599
I know only one little thing is how to raise Kundalini.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.083
Why should you be so much hurt about it?"

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.239
This is the thing that crucified Christ.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.199
The ego.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.960
They crucified, not only crucified Him,

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:18.698
they gave poisons and they tortured.

00:47:18.899 --> 00:47:21.878
Anybody who came with the Truth had to be tortured

00:47:22.079 --> 00:47:25.998
because everybody had such an ego and a collective ego.

00:47:27.573 --> 00:47:30.280
Why blame the Romans and why Romans blamed them?

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:34.039
Even today I find so many sitting like that before Me.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:38.172
The same style of people who have crucified Christ.

00:47:39.144 --> 00:47:42.555
So, this is the kind of people who are very ego-oriented,

00:47:42.756 --> 00:47:44.880
and when this center works fast

00:47:45.081 --> 00:47:48.929
the ego starts rising like a by-product as you see in the head,

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:52.194
that yellow stuff which is horrid.

00:47:53.872 --> 00:47:56.879
But when you start seeing it, you see the joke

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.479
that "This is the one which makes us stupid,

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:04.239
this is the thing which has really made us idiotic,

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.599
otherwise we will be normal people".

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.453
And then you want to ran away.

00:48:08.654 --> 00:48:11.799
Like one gentleman came to Me, said, "Mother,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
I just want to know one thing, but if it is true, don't tell me."

00:48:15.201 --> 00:48:17.366
I said, "What is it?"

00:48:18.171 --> 00:48:19.573
I said, "What's the problem?"

00:48:19.774 --> 00:48:22.960
He said, "Please, tell me if I was Napoleon in last life".

00:48:23.177 --> 00:48:26.399
"If I was, don't tell me, because I'll really collapse".

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.879
He is, he is a Frenchman.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.319
So, I said: "Why, what makes you think that you were Napoleon?"

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:34.445
"Because I am so ego-oriented,

00:48:34.646 --> 00:48:38.159
and I can draw very well which he used to do.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.240
So, was I Napoleon?"

00:48:40.441 --> 00:48:43.959
I said, "Should I tell you? You were not". "Thank God", he said.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.439
"Because I was thinking if I was Napoleon

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:50.079
what will I do in Sahaja Yoga? I just cannot become spontaneous

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.600
because this ego will be coming like Napoleon's ego every time".

00:48:53.801 --> 00:48:55.800
And it's - nowadays once upon a time

00:48:56.001 --> 00:48:58.080
Napoleon who was supposed to be a hero

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.920
today is regarded as a curse on people.

00:49:01.121 --> 00:49:04.155
If you call somebody Napoleon, never call a Frenchman

00:49:04.356 --> 00:49:06.859
because you'll have a black eye, I can tell you this much.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.119
Napoleon is the worst word for them. They don't like it.

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:13.831
So this is what has come out of all this ego-behaviour

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.293
that people don't like it.

00:49:15.494 --> 00:49:18.054
What about Hitler? You talk about Hitler to a German,

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:21.319
he says, "Don't talk, that was a big mistake on our part."

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:25.008
What did Hitler do? The same thing, he pampered the ego of people,

00:49:25.209 --> 00:49:28.319
he said, "You are a special race with a special nose."

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:30.441
So, God is going to measure your nose

00:49:30.642 --> 00:49:32.559
and put you on a higher pedestal.

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.199
Just imagine.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.759
Then why did God create all the rest of them?

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.190
This kind of mental projection

00:49:40.391 --> 00:49:42.439
makes you feel higher,

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:44.399
sometimes lower,

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.160
all kinds of these mythical things are there.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:51.331
God has created you in sweet beautiful varieties

00:49:51.532 --> 00:49:54.159
because without variety there is no beauty.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.800
Imagine all of you

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.823
looking like military bowls sitting down here. How will it look?

00:50:01.024 --> 00:50:03.311
You have to be people of variety,

00:50:03.512 --> 00:50:06.079
so God has created a beautiful variety.

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.559
Enjoy that!

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.959
Enjoy the integration of that variety.

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:12.680
That is what one has to really enjoy,

00:50:12.881 --> 00:50:15.800
but I think it's only possible when you get your Realization.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.529
Before that it's just talk, talk and talk.

00:50:20.513 --> 00:50:22.479
So now we come to the third center -

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:26.152
I won't be able to cover all of them today, I'm sorry -

00:50:27.195 --> 00:50:31.895
which is very important because it is the center of your seeking.

00:50:32.628 --> 00:50:35.439
First, we seek as animals our food.

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:38.093
Even now, we behave like animals, no doubt.

00:50:38.294 --> 00:50:40.800
So, we seek food, the attention is only on food.

00:50:41.009 --> 00:50:43.039
Anybody talks of food,

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.479
we want to turn our face to that.

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:49.199
So, the food is the first seeking we had.

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.760
The second seeking we had of shelter,

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.519
to have a proper shelter,

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.900
and that has gone beyond any human understanding.

00:50:59.101 --> 00:51:02.164
I have seen people building houses

00:51:02.418 --> 00:51:05.491
which look like nothing on earth, you know.

00:51:05.692 --> 00:51:07.341
We just can't say this is a house,

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:11.326
I mean, it's some sort of a funny thing that they make -

00:51:11.533 --> 00:51:14.360
call it a house - where you feel you are in a nightmare, you see,

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.880
the way it is built upside down, going like that and...

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.996
You don't know what sort of a place it is and where you are living.

00:51:21.197 --> 00:51:24.120
And that has gone to such a limit, specially in America I find

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.931
that you have to enter into any bathroom

00:51:26.132 --> 00:51:28.532
first enquire how to open,

00:51:29.725 --> 00:51:32.357
otherwise you'll have a problem. Such varieties.

00:51:32.558 --> 00:51:34.960
Like into one bathroom who was a very reach man's

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:38.372
I placed My foot and I was drenched in water. I said, "What's that?

00:51:38.573 --> 00:51:40.028
From where is it coming?"

00:51:40.229 --> 00:51:45.080
So, this kind of an unnecessary mental exercise

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.680
to select even the handle of the car.

00:51:47.881 --> 00:51:50.269
If the handle of the car you don't know, better don't get in

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:52.340
because something happens you can't get out

00:51:52.541 --> 00:51:54.959
because you don't know how to open the car.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.398
It's such a madness to go on worrying

00:51:58.599 --> 00:52:01.440
about the varieties of little, little, little, little things.

00:52:01.641 --> 00:52:04.853
You know what kind of a thing - like today I went for shopping

00:52:05.054 --> 00:52:07.759
and there were some ladies who were trying to decide

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.760
what kind of a ladle they should have.

00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.599
Hours they took to decide for a ladle.

00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:16.040
Can you imagine? What difference does it make

00:52:16.241 --> 00:52:18.400
of one ladle or the other ladle?

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:23.320
And tomorrow if they see somebody else having a more modern stuff,

00:52:23.521 --> 00:52:25.325
they'll again be back and to find out

00:52:25.524 --> 00:52:27.639
that more modern stuff to do it.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:32.494
I mean to amount of decision taking we have gone is maddening.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.960
Specially on a table, if you go,

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.920
I have seen people - because I have to attend so many parties -

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.320
I just can't understand,

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:44.050
half an hour they discuss what they are going to have today.

00:52:44.504 --> 00:52:46.479
I mean everybody must have what they want

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.266
and very particular on that point.

00:52:48.467 --> 00:52:51.479
When the food comes they see they have got the same thing or not.

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.534
What is so important? The whole joy of eating,

00:52:54.735 --> 00:52:56.301
the whole joy of meeting,

00:52:56.525 --> 00:52:59.399
everything is lost in that nonsense of decision.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.993
What does it matter whether you eat a pizza

00:53:02.194 --> 00:53:04.120
or you eat that, I don't understand.

00:53:04.321 --> 00:53:07.418
At the most you can have one thing for all of you and just enjoy it.

00:53:07.619 --> 00:53:12.240
But on the contrary, so much time we waste on nonsensical things,

00:53:12.475 --> 00:53:17.400
and when we do that we develop funny diseases within ourselves,

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.920
because we put our nerves to too much tension.

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.640
It is too much of a tension for us.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:26.879
We build up our own tensions for everything.

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:28.960
I have ordered for this, you have got this.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.839
I wanted this kind of a handle, I got this one.

00:53:31.959 --> 00:53:35.599
That's how we go on building up tensions in our stomachs,

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.600
and then we talk of our tensions. We have tensions,

00:53:38.807 --> 00:53:42.482
and we have this tension and that tension, and what is to be done?

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:48.137
And then we get people coming out in the market.

00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:53.168
They want six thousand pounds to reduce your stomach tension.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.959
How can they reduce? They cannot.

00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:00.280
And you believe it, because they advertise very well.

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:03.181
They put up a big show, "We'll remove your tensions

00:54:03.382 --> 00:54:05.840
and we are here for your tensions, and this and that."

00:54:06.041 --> 00:54:08.760
And you just go there and attend to them,

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.079
and you think, "Oh, now we have removed our tension".

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:15.534
Mentally you feel like that but the tension is all there.

00:54:16.371 --> 00:54:21.342
That's how we build up our stomach in a very funny way.

00:54:21.626 --> 00:54:25.737
Our real seeking should not be in politics,

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.291
should not be in any social behaviour,

00:54:30.492 --> 00:54:34.649
but it should be only towards our ascent,

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:37.439
towards our Spirit.

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.680
That should be our seeking,

00:54:39.881 --> 00:54:41.960
and when that stage comes in

00:54:42.161 --> 00:54:45.304
then they are the people of a special category

00:54:45.505 --> 00:54:47.522
which William Blake has described

00:54:47.723 --> 00:54:49.808
that the men of God,

00:54:50.009 --> 00:54:53.680
means the people of this special category, will become prophets,

00:54:53.881 --> 00:54:56.280
and they will have power to make others prophets.

00:54:56.481 --> 00:54:58.800
And that's the time, today we are here

00:54:59.001 --> 00:55:03.890
that those who are men of God will become prophets

00:55:04.091 --> 00:55:07.119
and they will have powers to make others prophets.

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:11.236
That is the sign, that if you can make others prophet as you are

00:55:11.437 --> 00:55:13.210
then you have achieved your goal

00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:15.639
and that should be the real seeking.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.319
Politics is a mad world, you know that.

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:22.399
It's a mad world. And is a mythical thing

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.239
because when we talk

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.759
of capitalism,

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.215
what is your capital?

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:35.239
These worldly things, these stones, these plastics?

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:38.298
What are your possessions?

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.710
You have one possession which you do not know - that is your Spirit.

00:55:43.911 --> 00:55:47.737
The one who has known that possession is a real capitalist.

00:55:48.594 --> 00:55:53.317
And once he becomes that capitalist he spreads it, automatically.

00:55:53.518 --> 00:55:57.120
For example, Me, I am a very happily married woman,

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.137
extremely happily married woman

00:55:59.338 --> 00:56:03.039
with a very good husband, very well-placed in life

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:05.999
with very good children, grandchildren,

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:08.400
very good family life, everything there,

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:10.759
but I can't enjoy it,

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.199
because I have to give this.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:17.239
So, I become a communist in that way, in the real sense of the word.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:20.079
I am a real capitalist and a real communist.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.759
I spend My own money,

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.239
go and meet people, talk to them, make them understand

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.280
and ask them to be their Spirits,

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.025
to be themselves, to be their own power.

00:56:33.226 --> 00:56:35.040
For what? People don't understand.

00:56:35.241 --> 00:56:37.479
The people who are with My husband,

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.520
their wives say, "What are you doing?"

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.639
"Oh, why are you wasting your time?"

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:45.760
They can't understand, "What is She up to?"

00:56:45.961 --> 00:56:48.322
because they are busy with other things,

00:56:48.523 --> 00:56:50.630
joyless pursuits.

00:56:51.178 --> 00:56:53.805
But I am here, working for you,

00:56:54.006 --> 00:56:56.039
working for everyone,

00:56:56.240 --> 00:57:00.395
just that you also enjoy what I am enjoying.

00:57:00.596 --> 00:57:02.056
So politics is all nonsense,

00:57:02.257 --> 00:57:04.612
it has no meaning at all, you can see that clearly.

00:57:04.813 --> 00:57:07.960
That's why no politics has been successful.

00:57:08.161 --> 00:57:11.920
I've been to Russia, it's another gone case; I've been to America.

00:57:12.121 --> 00:57:15.559
We do not know how to bear our freedom.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.338
We don't know.

00:57:17.539 --> 00:57:19.919
We don't know, we want to have freedom of

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:24.969
Abraham Lincoln said that, because he was a realized soul,

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:27.559
but he didn't know that all the others are not.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:32.159
Once you have your freedom, you go to abandonment, violence,

00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:34.362
you don't know how to be free.

00:57:34.563 --> 00:57:36.080
That glory is not within us,

00:57:36.281 --> 00:57:40.199
to be free you have to be a king, to be a free personality.

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.079
If you are not that than you go hither, thither, do this, do that.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.342
All the time what you do is self-destruction.

00:57:47.543 --> 00:57:51.039
Morning till evening you are thinking how to destroy yourself.

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.330
Ultimately, all those who are affluent

00:57:55.531 --> 00:57:57.759
democratic countries

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.719
if you meet their young people, if you ask them

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:02.519
you'll be amazed

00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:06.199
that they are doing nothing but planning about their suicide,

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:09.759
which is the most sophisticated way of committing suicide.

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:12.839
Can you believe it? That's a fact.

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:15.600
We had three girls from Sweden, very young girls -

00:58:15.801 --> 00:58:18.319
in Cambridge they came to see Me -

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.840
and when they came to see Me and I felt their vibrations

00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:22.934
I was shocked, I said, "Oh God,

00:58:23.135 --> 00:58:25.360
they have vibrations just like a dead man is.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:29.182
Is numb, complete numb." I said, "What are you doing?"

00:58:29.838 --> 00:58:33.040
They said, "You know, we think we are worth nothing. It's useless".

00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:36.199
I said, "Why? You are rich people, you have so much money,

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.559
you are very well off, you have a very organized country,

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.650
and everything is fine.

00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:43.711
What, what's the matter with you?"

00:58:43.912 --> 00:58:48.592
They said: "Actually, we are all planning how to commit suicide".

00:58:49.697 --> 00:58:52.359
This is where you go with your affluence,

00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.079
with your so-called achievements,

00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.693
that either you try to destroy yourself,

00:58:57.894 --> 00:58:59.310
or try to commit suicide,

00:58:59.511 --> 00:59:02.640
or can have a collective destruction

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:07.225
by your great achievements of science.

00:59:08.201 --> 00:59:11.617
Because we do not know what freedom is.

00:59:11.818 --> 00:59:15.059
We do not know how much God has worked out

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.519
to create these beautiful human beings,

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:21.141
how beautiful, fantastic we are within ourselves.

00:59:21.342 --> 00:59:23.800
Because we have no idea as to what we are,

00:59:24.001 --> 00:59:26.518
that's why we accept all these things,

00:59:26.719 --> 00:59:29.575
go on living with it and destroy ourselves.

00:59:29.909 --> 00:59:34.650
So the main seeking within us is the seeking for God,

00:59:34.851 --> 00:59:37.119
seeking for our evolution,

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:43.359
seeking for our higher dimension of collective consciousness.

00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:45.523
And that is what we have to achieve.

00:59:45.724 --> 00:59:50.622
Without that this world cannot be saved, cannot be emancipated.

00:59:50.823 --> 00:59:55.316
There's no other way out but the transformation of human beings.

00:59:55.517 --> 00:59:59.079
It's only the transformation that is going to work it out,

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.079
nothing else.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.409
The time is short, one has to get transformed.

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:08.039
Only those who will be transformed will be saved,

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:12.199
all the rest will be sorted out at the end of the era,

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.828
when you will find

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.472
someone

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:23.879
extremely powerful, destructive will come on this earth

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:28.053
and will destroy everything else.

01:00:28.254 --> 01:00:33.767
Because that is what according to that personality

01:00:33.968 --> 01:00:36.419
would be the end,

01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:41.110
that would be a deserving punishment.

01:00:42.082 --> 01:00:44.239
So one has to get transformation.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.931
That is the time that is given to us -

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:51.596
is called as Krita Yuga in Sanskrit language -

01:00:51.797 --> 01:00:54.739
means this is the time when the All-Pervading Power,

01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:57.284
the Brahma Shakti, is working it out.

01:00:57.485 --> 01:00:58.919
Better get it out.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.719
This is the Blossom time,

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.839
better get it transformation within yourself,

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:08.563
establish yourself as transformed human beings.

01:01:08.764 --> 01:01:10.759
Don't get to your egos.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.799
Don't mislead others, don't mislead yourself.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.759
I tell you, intelligence itself is such a funny thing;

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:23.079
it has a capacity to cheat itself.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.846
This is the worst thing of intelligence is

01:01:26.045 --> 01:01:28.216
that it can cheat itself.

01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:31.575
So, this living process has to work out within us

01:01:31.776 --> 01:01:37.035
so that we achieve our seeking, our fulfillment, our absolute.

01:01:37.499 --> 01:01:41.276
And that is something that cannot be discussed,

01:01:41.477 --> 01:01:43.182
talked about. It has to happen.

01:01:43.383 --> 01:01:46.479
Supposing, you want to know it on your mental level,

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.960
I can only take you up to a point

01:01:49.161 --> 01:01:55.389
and find for you some sort of a logical conclusion.

01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:58.546
But ascending is your own.

01:01:58.747 --> 01:02:00.514
I cannot guarantee that.

01:02:00.768 --> 01:02:02.519
If it works out, well and good;

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.239
if it does not, I cannot say that I can do it,

01:02:06.479 --> 01:02:08.189
nor can I say you can do it.

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:10.280
But once it happens, of course,

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.199
you can give it to others, and to others, and to others.

01:02:14.347 --> 01:02:17.167
You can work it out also, the same way,

01:02:17.368 --> 01:02:21.280
as one light which is enlightened can enlighten another light,

01:02:21.481 --> 01:02:23.876
and you can go on enlightening others.

01:02:24.077 --> 01:02:28.365
A gentleman in India, who was not a very educated man, a farmer,

01:02:28.566 --> 01:02:32.427
has given Realization to more than ten thousand people.

01:02:32.628 --> 01:02:36.478
So you can imagine how one can be powerful.

01:02:36.679 --> 01:02:40.487
I wish he had come to America but he had to go back to India.

01:02:40.688 --> 01:02:42.599
He came all the way to England

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.889
then he went round with Me to Europe where

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:51.153
he explained to people things in such a way,

01:02:51.354 --> 01:02:54.919
that they were surprised, an uneducated man

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.000
talking like such a great saint.

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.278
They could not understand how can he talk like that.

01:03:00.479 --> 01:03:02.119
I asked him, "How are you?"

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.159
"Are you all right, are you comfortable?"

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:07.505
He says one Marathi words he says,

01:03:07.706 --> 01:03:10.119
[Marathi].

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.244
"Whatever is the Eternal, wherever it keeps you

01:03:13.445 --> 01:03:15.051
let the Eternal look after me."

01:03:15.252 --> 01:03:17.624
Means when you are worried about the eternal,

01:03:17.825 --> 01:03:19.243
when you are in the eternal,

01:03:19.444 --> 01:03:21.676
why are you worried about these transitory things?

01:03:21.877 --> 01:03:24.372
And I was so happy to hear these words from him.

01:03:24.573 --> 01:03:27.662
But there's one thing I must say that

01:03:27.863 --> 01:03:31.040
he was a fortunate man

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.310
to be born in a country where they know about it;

01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:40.246
and more fortunate to be born in Maharashtra

01:03:40.447 --> 01:03:42.032
which is a country of saints

01:03:42.233 --> 01:03:45.140
who have written beautiful things

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.917
and that country which is not so materialistic.

01:03:49.118 --> 01:03:52.950
For them materialistic achievements is not the success.

01:03:53.151 --> 01:03:55.459
That's why people don't understand. They always ask,

01:03:55.684 --> 01:03:57.719
"Then why people in India are poor?"

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.599
I said, "Not at hearts".

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.611
They are smiling, laughing, festive people.

01:04:02.812 --> 01:04:05.486
If you go to even a poor man's house,

01:04:05.687 --> 01:04:10.193
they will offer you a cup of milk. They have a large heart.

01:04:10.394 --> 01:04:11.709
Why they are poor?

01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:16.145
The reasons are we were slaves for three hundred years.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.122
Can you think of slavery of three hundred years?

01:04:20.328 --> 01:04:22.651
Who is responsible for that?

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.839
Who made us poor?

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:28.253
We would have been much richer than anyone of these countries.

01:04:28.454 --> 01:04:30.146
We were, once upon a time,

01:04:30.347 --> 01:04:33.012
the richest people in the whole world.

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:38.119
There is a rich site called the richest site of the world in Iran,

01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.360
is a hall four times bigger than this,

01:04:40.561 --> 01:04:45.559
and the every, the door that opens into it is six feet wide.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.079
And when you go inside, what do you find?

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.840
A gentleman called Muhammad Ghazni who invaded India,

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.719
only about six hundred years back

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:59.393
and carried all the gold and wealth of one temple.

01:05:00.385 --> 01:05:02.920
And the whole place is filled with diamonds

01:05:03.121 --> 01:05:06.039
as if like the peanuts are kept in baskets.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:10.159
And a complete huge big globe is made out of gold

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.789
with all these diamonds and pearls and emeralds

01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:16.359
and such big, big emeralds you see there,

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:18.697
all brought from our country.

01:05:18.898 --> 01:05:21.800
How can we be rich when we were so docile people?

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:24.737
Everybody came and lynched us like this?

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:28.421
And then they ask us, "Why are you poor?" Very nice.

01:05:28.622 --> 01:05:30.157
You enter into somebody's house,

01:05:30.358 --> 01:05:32.769
take away all his money, take away everything,

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:35.640
nicely rule him, don't allow him to grow at all

01:05:35.841 --> 01:05:39.195
and then you come and ask him, "Why are you so poor?"

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:41.536
Wonderful people.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:43.879
That's what it is.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:46.920
So that country has survived despite all these

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.459
because of their faith in God,

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:52.200
in the faith that one day they will ascend.

01:05:52.401 --> 01:05:55.149
In India - I'm not talking of the westernized Indians.

01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.598
They are hopeless people, they are absolutely uprooted.

01:05:57.799 --> 01:06:00.308
Don't think of them, they are absolutely useless.

01:06:00.509 --> 01:06:02.479
They are not the ones who represent India.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.369
But the Indians, the real Indians,

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:08.199
who live in the villages, who are simple people,

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:13.160
for them one thing is the most important is Atma Sakshatkar -

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.339
means "to get your Realization".

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:18.810
That's the highest for them.

01:06:19.488 --> 01:06:22.079
Nothing more higher than that.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:25.199
Their attention is not materialistic.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:29.486
Even if a woman is dying, she'll not sell her chastity.

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.112
That is the great country,

01:06:33.313 --> 01:06:36.680
which people have not realized, have not understood.

01:06:36.881 --> 01:06:39.400
They have exploited us, completely exploited us.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.483
You have no idea to what extend they exploited us.

01:06:42.684 --> 01:06:45.440
And today they are asking, "Why are you poor

01:06:45.641 --> 01:06:47.815
despite the fact you believe in God?"

01:06:48.016 --> 01:06:50.703
I mean we are existing because of that.

01:06:50.904 --> 01:06:52.960
Just because of that we are existing,

01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.800
otherwise we would have finished for long time back,

01:06:56.001 --> 01:06:58.320
the way we are invaded on and on and on.

01:06:58.521 --> 01:07:00.880
While it is surprising in the history of India

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.999
we have never invaded another country.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.459
Never. Can you imagine?

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:09.760
This is what it is.

01:07:09.978 --> 01:07:14.792
So, some people say, "Why should we learn from Indians?"

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:16.757
Very wonderful.

01:07:16.958 --> 01:07:19.928
We have learned all your science, all your things from you,

01:07:20.129 --> 01:07:21.960
we should go on learning everything from you,

01:07:22.161 --> 01:07:24.685
even your dominating nature, everything we learn.

01:07:24.886 --> 01:07:29.094
And you don't want to learn even about God from us. Why?

01:07:29.295 --> 01:07:31.799
Was Christ born in England?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.679
Where was He born?

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.079
He also came to India.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.479
So one should not develop such ideas

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.336
that, "We are the one highest in religion,

01:07:41.537 --> 01:07:44.239
highest in science, highest in everything."

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.400
It is the East and the West has to combine.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.519
As I said the tree has grown too big.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.407
There has been movement also downward,

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.159
and that downward movement was in India.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.989
Of course, now you have many thugs coming from India,

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:03.999
because you like them.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.299
For the last sixty years all the thugs also came out of jail

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.439
are nicely have add in the market.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.201
And you like them very much.

01:08:12.402 --> 01:08:14.479
You see, let one of the thugs come here

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:17.920
you won't be able to see even the chairs.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.137
They'll be all crowding here if they are thugs.

01:08:22.815 --> 01:08:25.360
For a real person you don't have here anyone.

01:08:25.561 --> 01:08:28.703
When I came in 1970, they told Me very clearly,

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:31.199
"Mother, You cannot impress these people.

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:34.959
You must know how to pamper their ego by taking their money.

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:38.119
If You don't take their money, they are not going to look at You."

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:40.074
And I went away.

01:08:40.275 --> 01:08:43.919
They've advised Me that, "These people will not understand You

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.335
unless and until You take money."

01:08:47.573 --> 01:08:50.039
These are the Christian nations.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.459
How much did you pay to Christ?

01:08:54.432 --> 01:08:58.347
And He was sold for 30 rupees.

01:08:59.498 --> 01:09:00.999
This is what it is.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:05.319
A day will come when you'll be asked about many things.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.359
Only thing is that if you become the Spirit

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.839
then you are in the Kingdom of God.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.373
You are there.

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.599
Everybody can enter into it.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.120
It doesn't matter whatever country you come from.

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:22.006
Whatever is your past just forget it now and have it.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.819
You, please, have your Realization,

01:09:25.020 --> 01:09:26.676
enter into the Kingdom of God.

01:09:26.877 --> 01:09:28.679
But you have to be humble,

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.679
you have to be humble about it.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.039
You cannot purchase Me,

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.921
you cannot organize Me.

01:09:35.122 --> 01:09:38.879
It is you who has to organize yourself.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:42.084
And I hope it will work out.

01:09:42.285 --> 01:09:45.442
Definitely it has to work out in this country, very important,

01:09:45.643 --> 01:09:48.359
because as I told you this is the Vishuddhi chakra

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:52.519
which is a very important center of the whole world.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.960
And if America cannot do it

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.199
I don't  know what's going to happen.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:01.003
May God bless you all.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.639
Now if you have any questions, need not be aggressive with Me,

01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.039
you can ask Me some questions.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:11.280
Oh, you don't know, in one of the places I went

01:10:11.481 --> 01:10:13.720
a lady came with a big Bible to hit Me.

01:10:13.921 --> 01:10:16.120
And she was about to beat Me with the Bible.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:17.800
And they, they photographed that.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:19.880
I was just laughing. I didn't know what to do.

01:10:20.081 --> 01:10:22.000
You see, I just was roaring with laughter.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:24.840
And everybody got upset. Of course, she didn't hit Me, thank God.

01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:27.949
But if she could have hit Me, she could have hit Me, what can I do?

01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:31.257
She was in such a big temper. I don't know what made her so upset.

01:10:31.458 --> 01:10:34.182
And then I asked, "What are you?" She said, "I am twice born".

01:10:34.383 --> 01:10:36.415
I said: "Must be".

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.320
So now relax.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.840
I would like to have some questions, sensible questions.

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.759
We shouldn't waste others' time.

01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.520
Lady: Could You tell me which...

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.919
well, which would be the best way to wake up the Kundalini?

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.839
SM: That I will do now. That part is Mine.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.439
The reason is, you see, when the light is not enlightened

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.800
the one that is enlightened can enlighten the light, all right?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.759
That's a simple thing like that, absolutely simple.

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.839
Or you can understand the seed -

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.520
if you have to sprout the seed what do you do?

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.519
You just put it in the Mother Earth,

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.079
and the Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout it.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.199
It's as simple as that.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.320
So that I'll work out and then you will work out for others.

01:11:34.521 --> 01:11:38.906
All right? That's very simple. That's a very good question.

01:11:39.272 --> 01:11:40.643
Shows the earnestness.

01:11:40.844 --> 01:11:44.454
Man: When the seed sprouts then you continue your spiritual growth

01:11:44.655 --> 01:11:47.360
into higher realm of spirituality?

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.170
SM: I beg your pardon.
SY: He's asking

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:53.199
if once the seed has sprouted does the growth continue?

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.440
SM: Yes, yes, that's true.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.280
First the sprouting takes place, awakening takes place,

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.120
you become first thoughtlessly aware -

01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.320
I'll tell you all these status you go into -

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.600
and then you become doubtlessly aware.

01:12:05.801 --> 01:12:09.199
And with those you start manifesting your powers of love,

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.960
and you grow into it very much

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:14.360
till you become a tree, you become your own guru,

01:12:14.561 --> 01:12:18.599
and others call you a guru then, a real guru.

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:22.615
It's true.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.652
M: Mother, interacting with other people,

01:12:37.853 --> 01:12:41.242
there are along the path, of the spiritual path

01:12:41.443 --> 01:12:45.358
and, in any type of environment...

01:12:45.716 --> 01:12:49.150
SM: What is he saying? Just... Gavin you have to...

01:12:49.349 --> 01:12:53.956
M: Ok. Interacting with other people in any type of environment,

01:12:54.184 --> 01:12:59.466
such as work or such as [unclear], whatever,

01:13:00.701 --> 01:13:05.161
and they are not born Spirit yet,

01:13:05.362 --> 01:13:07.888
your discussion with them

01:13:08.118 --> 01:13:10.701
got, you want to reveal something to them.

01:13:10.902 --> 01:13:12.999
How would you go about doing that?

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.248
SM: What's he's saying?

01:13:14.449 --> 01:13:17.760
SY: How can you awaken the seeking in others who are not seeking?

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.639
SM: No, no, no, that I can't do.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.800
If you are not seeking really I don't want to make you seek.

01:13:23.001 --> 01:13:25.880
This is impossible. That's an impossible situation.

01:13:26.081 --> 01:13:28.960
If you are a seeker then I can help you.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.758
If you are not a seeker then, please, save Me.

01:13:31.959 --> 01:13:36.503
I cannot make, you see, a stone into a tree, can I?

01:13:36.710 --> 01:13:38.359
That's it.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.984
So that's not possible.

01:13:40.185 --> 01:13:43.339
If you are a seeker, if you are seeking something,

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:45.074
then only it can work out.

01:13:45.275 --> 01:13:48.359
Otherwise, I have seen the frozen Kundalini of many people.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:51.520
Now supposing if Hitler says, "You give me Realization".

01:13:51.721 --> 01:13:54.145
Can I give him Realization?

01:13:54.771 --> 01:13:55.840
That's it.

01:13:56.041 --> 01:14:00.222
But you are a seeker, out and out. Don't worry about yourself.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.840
L: Don't You think there are a lot of people who are seeking

01:14:05.042 --> 01:14:07.039
but they don't know what they're seeking?

01:14:07.255 --> 01:14:08.715
SM: Very much true.

01:14:08.916 --> 01:14:11.560
L: [How can we address them or how can You...]

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.919
SM: I mean, you see, today we advertised in the newspaper.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.919
We spent lot of money on other things,

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.760
and we had television in Los Angeles,

01:14:21.961 --> 01:14:23.525
and they were very much impressed

01:14:23.726 --> 01:14:27.782
because the lady who interviewed Me felt the vibrations.

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:30.291
So now they want to have a nationwide thing,

01:14:30.497 --> 01:14:32.240
something might work out with that.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.680
But what... we have everything with us;

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.120
even My photograph works out, you will be surprised.

01:14:37.321 --> 01:14:40.319
Even if you have My photograph, you can work out with My photograph.

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:43.599
But the trouble is how to get them here.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:46.280
L: Tricky.
SM: Very tricky, you know.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.559
You have to have horns

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.808
and a band in front of you.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.639
You know, you have seen your election campaigns, I have seen them,

01:14:58.847 --> 01:15:01.080
and I've said, "Ah, how can you do that?"

01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:03.168
But one has to do all those things, you see,

01:15:03.369 --> 01:15:06.252
people are used to this kind of a circus.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.713
Yes.

01:15:10.914 --> 01:15:14.599
M: Yes. Is tomorrow's programme is something different from today's?

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.040
SM: Yes, tomorrow I'll be speaking about other centers

01:15:18.241 --> 01:15:20.240
and how one can cure,

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.000
and then day after tomorrow

01:15:22.201 --> 01:15:25.678
I'll tell you after Realization what is to be done.

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:30.000
Yesterday I talked about the general things,

01:15:30.201 --> 01:15:33.081
about the three, three nadis that we have got,

01:15:33.282 --> 01:15:36.239
left and right and the center one.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.560
And today I'm talking about the centers

01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:42.119
and tomorrow about the rest of the centers,

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:44.680
and after that I'll be telling you

01:15:44.881 --> 01:15:47.799
after Realization what is to be done.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.594
That's how I put it for Houston

01:15:50.795 --> 01:15:54.296
but in another places I'm speaking in a different way.

01:15:54.497 --> 01:15:57.418
That's how we decided for four days.

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.295
First, let us see,

01:16:00.496 --> 01:16:04.043
I mean is talking is different and getting is different.

01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:09.640
Like talking about food you don't eat it, isn't it?

01:16:09.841 --> 01:16:12.057
So, better have it.

01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:15.668
Now, it's a very simple thing,

01:16:15.869 --> 01:16:18.759
is first of all I have to request you to

01:16:18.934 --> 01:16:22.241
little bit take out your shoes,

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.604
because shoes - nothing wrong with it but they little bit stand

01:16:28.805 --> 01:16:31.751
between you and the Mother Earth.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:38.083
As it is, there are nylons here and nylons there. Doesn't matter.

01:16:57.081 --> 01:17:01.639
Now the first block you have, I must tell you,

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:03.999
is that here,

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.920
is the first one - here,

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:09.119
and that comes from feeling guilty.

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.920
If I have said anything that makes you feel guilty,

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.036
please, forgive Me.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.520
You are not to feel guilty at all to begin with,

01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:21.809
that is the first condition - not to feel guilty.

01:17:23.838 --> 01:17:26.960
Now tell yourself that you are not guilty at all.

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.877
At this time, you are sitting here.

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.259
This present time, you don't have to think about the past.

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:43.511
Just tell yourself that "I'm not guilty at all, not at all guilty.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:50.120
Whatever I've said, it doesn't mean it implies to this moment.

01:17:50.321 --> 01:17:53.038
It is for the past.

01:17:57.585 --> 01:18:00.093
Still there.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.427
In the beginning it was too much.

01:18:04.628 --> 01:18:07.415
I also could not speak with that because you are all within Me

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.824
and this was all caught up. I didn't know what to say

01:18:10.025 --> 01:18:11.744
but thank God it's released a little bit.

01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:16.011
Don't feel guilty about anything, first of all.

01:18:25.924 --> 01:18:27.993
Now, you have to put your hands like this.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.514
As I told you yesterday

01:18:29.715 --> 01:18:32.920
that these are the five centers of the sympathetic left side,

01:18:33.121 --> 01:18:36.410
and six and seven centers. So these are the seven centers,

01:18:36.601 --> 01:18:39.659
and there are seven centers on this. This is the right side,

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:43.626
means the mental and the emotional, mental and the physical side,

01:18:43.827 --> 01:18:45.449
and this is the emotional side.

01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:47.680
So now, these are the centers,

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:50.319
and you have to place your hands just like this.

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:55.259
Now, the left side is the power of your desire.

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.879
So, put this left side towards Me.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:01.287
Not of pure desire,

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.919
but of your desires.

01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.879
So, put the left hand towards Me like this,

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.804
and the right hand also like this,

01:19:09.005 --> 01:19:12.040
and I will tell you how to use the right side;

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.564
because the right side is the power of your action.

01:19:15.765 --> 01:19:17.319
Please, sit down, all of you

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.359
with your both the feet on the Mother Earth, properly,

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:26.572
with a little humble attitude towards it.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.187
Now,

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.925
you have to close your eyes,

01:19:45.126 --> 01:19:47.040
and don't open your eyes till I tell you.

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:50.119
You should not open your eyes at any cost.

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:53.520
If you open your eyes, then the Kundalini won't rise

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.880
because something has to happen within,

01:19:56.081 --> 01:19:57.999
so keep your eyes shut.

01:19:58.200 --> 01:20:01.950
Comfortably, just keep your eyes shut.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.960
Now, please, do the things I tell you,

01:20:10.161 --> 01:20:12.599
just put your left hand towards Me,

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:17.479
and the right hand is now to be lifted to your heart.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:20.239
On the left-hand side is your heart.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.542
Put your right hand on your heart.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.639
You have to sit straight

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:38.762
with your neck straight, not bending forward or backward.

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:48.601
With a cheerful mood you have to sit down,

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:50.720
and not with a laughing or a smiling one

01:20:50.921 --> 01:20:52.839
but a cheerfulness inside.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.965
Not with unhappy mood either.

01:20:58.511 --> 01:21:03.607
Because this is you are going to achieve which

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:09.599
has been your longing for ages now, and you are going to get it.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.499
So, look forward to that.

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:16.159
On your heart now you ask a question

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.039
because in the heart resides the Spirit.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.777
So you can address Me as Shri Mataji

01:21:21.944 --> 01:21:25.648
or as Mother, "Mother,

01:21:26.608 --> 01:21:30.471
am I the Spirit?" Ask thrice.

01:21:31.523 --> 01:21:34.400
Without feeling guilty, with full confidence.

01:21:34.601 --> 01:21:38.640
Put the left hand on your lap, parallel to the ground, yes.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:41.482
Now, ask a question.

01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:47.749
Left hand parallel does not mean upside down, but open hand,

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:49.999
open hand, the palm is upward.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.729
Put the palm upward.

01:21:54.752 --> 01:21:58.905
Now, ask a question, with full confidence.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.960
Now to know that you are the Spirit

01:22:29.161 --> 01:22:30.926
you have to know one more thing,

01:22:31.127 --> 01:22:33.577
that the Spirit is your Master.

01:22:33.778 --> 01:22:35.640
And once you become the Spirit

01:22:35.841 --> 01:22:38.679
you become your own Master.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:43.319
So put your right hand on the left-hand side of your stomach,

01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:47.679
left-hand side of your stomach, in the center, and press it hard

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:53.690
because that is the place resides the power of your mastery.

01:22:54.192 --> 01:22:56.816
Now, ask a question:

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:03.800
"Mother, am I my own Master?", "Am I my own Guru?".

01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:05.785
This you have to ask ten times

01:23:05.986 --> 01:23:11.485
because there are ten guru principles within us.

01:24:07.664 --> 01:24:11.942
Now again put the right hand on your heart.

01:24:13.064 --> 01:24:15.479
Now, here, assert yourself

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:19.400
and say, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:23.960
Say it twelve times, with full assertion and assumption:

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.334
"Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:46.759
Now, put this right hand on your shoulder

01:25:46.946 --> 01:25:50.119
near your neck, on the left-hand side,

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.840
on your shoulder, near neck.

01:25:53.041 --> 01:25:55.043
This is the place, where I showed you,

01:25:55.244 --> 01:25:57.759
that people, when they feel guilty, there's a catch.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:01.247
Press it hard. You'll find it's quite a hard place.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.418
Here you have to say: "Mother, I am not guilty".

01:26:07.667 --> 01:26:10.239
Say it with full confidence sixteen times.

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:14.179
And if you have that habit, better say thirty two times.

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:23.305
Sixteen times, please say, "Mother, I am not guilty".

01:26:23.506 --> 01:26:26.445
You have to forgive yourself.

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.959
You have to forgive yourself

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:44.880
by saying, "Mother I am not guilty at all, I'm not guilty".

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:47.960
Put it next to your neck.

01:26:55.832 --> 01:26:58.919
Now, put the right hand

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.502
on the forehead.

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.039
And at this point - across, put it across -

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.532
and now say,

01:27:11.656 --> 01:27:15.109
"Mother, I forgive everyone".

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.039
After forgiving yourself,

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.370
you have to say, "I forgive everyone".

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:31.749
Across, put your hand across.

01:27:33.703 --> 01:27:37.313
Across, not with your finger but across.

01:27:41.705 --> 01:27:45.359
From your heart you have to say that, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.969
You'll feel very much relieved, you just try it.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:53.331
Half of your tension will drop away.

01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.600
Now, put this hand at the back of your head and hold it tight.

01:27:59.415 --> 01:28:01.399
Hold it tight.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.537
Now without feeling guilty, without thinking about the past

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:08.176
in a general way, you have to say

01:28:08.359 --> 01:28:11.152
that, "Oh Lord, oh God,

01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:15.505
if I have done any mistake, please, forgive me".

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.599
Without feeling guilty, that's very important.

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:24.576
On the back of your head, on the back of your head.

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.815
At the back of your head,

01:28:34.016 --> 01:28:37.029
not on the neck but on the back,

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.732
over the optic lobe, we can say.

01:28:54.407 --> 01:28:57.067
Now put your hand on top of your head,

01:28:57.266 --> 01:28:58.679
in the center of it,

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.680
and press it with your palm,

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.880
and try to move it clockwise.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.667
Move it clockwise.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.520
At this point as I said I cannot cross your freedom.

01:29:22.726 --> 01:29:24.991
Keep it in a comfortable way.

01:29:25.599 --> 01:29:27.648
Comfortable way. From the front if you put it,

01:29:27.815 --> 01:29:29.599
it will be comfortable.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:31.719
And move it a little bit.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:35.589
And now, at this point, as I cannot cross your freedom

01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:40.283
you have to say: "Mother, please give me my Realization".

01:29:42.236 --> 01:29:44.800
Because I cannot do it without your permission.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.199
"I want my Realization. Please, give me Realization".

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:50.870
Just ask for it.

01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:58.255
Seven times.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.879
Now put your hand down

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.679
and with your left hand,

01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:30.519
feel if there's a cool breeze coming,

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.362
on top of your head.

01:30:43.735 --> 01:30:45.742
Raise it higher to see

01:30:45.943 --> 01:30:49.699
not very high, but at a higher point. Because close to your head

01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:52.719
you might feel the heat coming out of your head.

01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:56.605
So little higher, not much, about six inches.

01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:04.236
See now, if there's cool breeze coming.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:13.253
Don't think about it. If you think about it, it will stop.

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.346
Now change your hand if you want.

01:31:16.547 --> 01:31:18.439
Again see with your right hand.

01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:22.000
Just see, if there is a cool breeze coming here.

01:31:51.944 --> 01:31:55.071
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.280
Now I'll teach you how to raise your own Kundalini.

01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:05.858
You can open your eyes.

01:32:06.059 --> 01:32:09.200
Now do it without thinking, try to see Me without thinking.

01:32:09.401 --> 01:32:11.360
You have to do it. Don't think about it.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.680
It's just an action of your hand because it is awakened now.

01:32:14.881 --> 01:32:16.299
So we have to establish it.

01:32:16.339 --> 01:32:19.399
Just put this left hand in front - by sitting only -

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:23.117
in front of your Kundalini, like this.

01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:25.618
Like this.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.439
Can you see? Just like this, while you're sitting. Left hand.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:32.160
Now, with the right hand you have to move it like this,

01:32:32.361 --> 01:32:34.635
forward, downward, backward, upward.

01:32:34.836 --> 01:32:36.360
Like that, you see? Like this.

01:32:36.561 --> 01:32:40.159
Now, let us start. We have to go up.

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:49.159
Take it up, through your head up and

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.325
twist it now and give it a knot.

01:32:53.547 --> 01:32:55.380
Again, let's try.

01:32:55.581 --> 01:32:57.360
Once more.
