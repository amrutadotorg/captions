00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,720
Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Workshop for beginners Burwood Ashram, Sydney (Australia)

5
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,440
The question is: People even before Realization

6
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,080
having a certain level of awareness which was.

7
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,040
Are they close to realization and what if they don't even meet you,

8
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,160
What is their position?

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:27,280
You have to know that you all have been seekers before

10
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,880
this is not the first time you have been seeking.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,520
So already you have reached a certain state

12
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,640
where you feel and you are aware that something more

13
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,760
has to happen to you, you are already ready for that,

14
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,000
some of you have really taken birth in this time just for this.

15
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,200
So, because I’m not going to talk of your past,

16
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,160
past is over now, we have to think of the present.

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,000
One has to know that all of you, get Realization,

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,600
some people have certain problems,

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,120
on their different centers as I told you,

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,960
different types of problems people have.

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,000
Because of these problems, the Kundalini goes back

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,320
to its attention because Kundalini has to look after your problems.

23
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,000
She’s your mother so she goes there, attends to that problem

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,200
and again she rises. But only thing you have to learn,

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,840
how to make her rise, how to cooperate with her,

26
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,720
how to understand your own problem and give additional help

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,400
to solve the problem.

28
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,000
Now you will be amazed that you just get rid of your

29
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
false identifications with yourself.

30
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,080
You become absolutely detached from that,

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,320
because you start talking in the language of chakras and centers.

32
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,880
You start saying that this center is bad, that center is bad,

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,360
this is not alright Mother, that’s wrong with me,

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,560
that is wrong with me, that’s all. You don’t say I’ve cancer,

35
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,440
you don’t say I’m mad, you don’t say I’m egoistical.

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,840
You just say : “Mother this center is not alright,

37
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,080
that center is not alright.”

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,240
Depending on the quality of your centers, the chakras,

39
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,720
as -they are, the ones who really are the channels

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,800
for the energy of God to flow in.

41
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,520
Regarding them, you have to be careful, how your chakras are.

42
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,920
Are you clean or not?

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,320
Some of you will find cool breeze flowing alright in the hand,

44
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,200
but may be, one chakra is catching.

45
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,440
On one chakra you will feel the heat, or you may feel the numbness,

46
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,800
you might feel also a kind of a

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,000
– we can say a kind of a tingling on certain fingers.

48
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,600
Now wherever there is tingling,

49
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,800
you must know there is a kind of a struggle going on

50
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,320
between those chakras and the Kundalini.

51
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,360
So you should just try to help your chakras, to awaken them

52
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,720
and also must know that every one of you

53
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,280
are part and parcel of the whole. You are awakened,

54
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,640
you are awakened to that part and so you have to be more careful.

55
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,080
Because if you suffer from some chakra, I can feel it.

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,400
But if others, those who are not Realized,

57
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,480
I don’t feel it at all, I’m not bothered,

58
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,000
There can be any number of devils or anything,

59
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,440
doesn’t matter to me.

60
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,880
But if you people, who are Realized souls,

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,920
have a slight problem immediately I know

62
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,480
that you have this problem, my attention is diverted to that.

63
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,920
So you must understand that the attention is all the time there

64
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,520
to look after you, to give you a better guidance,

65
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,200
your Spirit is all the time working.

66
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,320
But you must learn how to take the guidance from your Spirit

67
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,760
that’s the main point; so nobody is lower or higher as he said.

68
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,080
I’ve seen some people who were declared as

69
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,280
drunkards, this, that, overnight, there are finished

70
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,040
[with that], they are perfect people, not only, but very good Sahaja Yogis.

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,720
So, you see, all these clouds have come on the sky of your being

72
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,920
in this life time, doesn’t matter, makes no difference,

73
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,000
but your past is great, that shows.

74
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,200
So you don’t have to worry as to how far you are where you are,

75
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,480
there’s no degree or anything to measure it.

76
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,880
They must be all aware already, otherwise you would not come to me,

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,480
first of all. And to get Realization itself, is very big.

78
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,000
Now there’s a very good seeker I know of, who came to me,

79
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,760
and he got his Realization but he did not feel it on his hand,

80
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,040
because he has a very bad Vishuddhi.

81
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,200
And with a bad Vishuddhi chakra,

82
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,560
you may not feel it in your hand, doesn’t matter,

83
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,120
but you’ll feel peaceful, you’ll feel joyful.

84
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,520
And you can feel it on top of your head, or others can feel it.

85
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Gradually your fingers will start improving

86
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,840
and they will give you better results.

87
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,480
For example, people who do hard work with their hands,

88
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,560
also their fingers can be numbed,

89
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,680
so we have to use certain methods, like looking after our hands.

90
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,840
This body now is a temple of God

91
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,000
so we have to look after it in a way, respectfully,

92
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,280
not for the way the – you see, the prostitutes,

93
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,680
when they want to sell their body they look after their body.

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
No, but respect, with respect to our body.

95
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,040
We have to look after ourselves in a way

96
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,640
that we should keep good health.

97
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,640
And to keep good health in Sahaja Yoga,

98
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,960
there are thousand and one things, which you have to know,

99
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,280
which is very easy to understand,

100
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,160
and which will be told to you for no price at all, nothing.

101
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,200
It is the Divine that is anxious that you should get it,

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,960
that you should settle down, that you should enjoy.

103
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,320
So you don’t have to be so anxious about it.

104
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,520
These anxieties must be given up, just try to understand your centers.

105
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,240
Now many of you who did feel the cool breeze.

106
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,200
But maybe, after some time, you may lose it, doesn’t matter.

107
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,480
You’ll go up and down, like that, doesn’t matter.

108
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,400
It does not mean that you’ve lost it, not at all.

109
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,320
Now supposing you try a method, a simple method,

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
that you first put your left hand towards my photograph

111
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,840
– just now you can try –

112
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,040
and right hand on the Mother Earth, let’s see.

113
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,400
Right hand on the Mother Earth,

114
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,160
that’s why I wanted to have it in the open,

115
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,400
but doesn’t matter now, this rain is good for you for the farmers,

116
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,240
let’s have it.

117
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,840
So now put your left hand like this,

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,120
and right hand – those who are sitting can put up like that

119
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,800
Like this. Back. Right hand like this, right. Not left, right.

120
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,680
[Yogi] …the ground. No like this.

121
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,600
Back. Yes, right hand.

122
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,320
Now what we are doing, the left hand side power,

123
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,480
is the emotional power.

124
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
Now if you have an emotional problem

125
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,040
– say, somebody has been taking drugs,

126
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,680
he’s a left sided person.

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,000
Some drugs are, LSD and all that right-sided,

128
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,360
but most of the drugs take you to the left side.

129
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,000
Gurus are left sided part.

130
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,240
Most of these problems are mental problems, are left sided problems.

131
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:33,880
But the problem of the intellectuals is right sided,

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,400
futuristic people is right sided.

133
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,080
People who are running the rat race are right sided,

134
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,800
you see, that kind of over activity, that kind of things.

135
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,080
On the contrary, those who have taken to drugs are left sided.

136
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,920
So first try with the left, let’s see.

137
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,240
Now put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

138
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,520
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

139
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,040
Now, put your left hand towards me.

140
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Gradually, you’ll find it will start flowing in you left hand.

141
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,200
Is it flowing?

142
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,800
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth,

143
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,720
because the Mother Earth takes away ;

144
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,880
you see, you are just earthing it, put it on it,

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
touching it, touch, touch it, you see, you are earthing yourself,

146
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,480
is a very simple thing.

147
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,840
Now left sided problems easily go to Mother Earth,

148
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,040
it’s true, but the best is to have a light.

149
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:26,800
Now, say, if you have a candle,

150
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,400
candle is the best, for left sided problems,

151
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,360
candle is the best thing to take it.

152
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,920
Because left sided problems, we can say, are cold problems,

153
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,720
or problems which arise from coldness.

154
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,080
You see, a person who becomes inactive.

155
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,880
Now see.

156
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,520
You just put your left hand towards me like this

157
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,280
and right hand towards a candle.

158
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,120
You ‘ll be amazed, sometimes,

159
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,840
the candle starts burning “tac”and drop like that

160
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,560
and sometimes it creates such black smoke that,

161
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,000
if it is next to a wall, you might find the all wall becoming black.

162
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,880
It’s very interesting to see how the candle reacts,

163
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,360
but you must have a photograph in front.

164
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,880
And there should be a candle in front of the photograph

165
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,200
and one candle like this to take it out.

166
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,920
Right, now, see better?

167
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Alright?

168
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,840
You’ll feel it’s going down. You’ll feel from your head, you’ll feel,

169
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,160
you see, the pressure is going down.

170
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,000
Better now? Like this. Put the hand like that, back side,

171
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,120
not towards me, like that yes, yes. Now. Hum.

172
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,400
Now put left hand, if you ‘re sitting on the ground,

173
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,960
it’s better to put towards me, left hand.

174
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,520
It’s coming, it’s going, it’s working.

175
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,400
It’s like the energy, you see, that is coming through the photograph,

176
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,240
it’s pushing it down towards the light,

177
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,920
and the light burns it off : light gets awakened, by you.

178
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,720
It’s surprising but it does.

179
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,960
It’s better now? See. We work out, we feel it.

180
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,600
You will feel it yourself, there is nothing to certify.

181
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,120
You will feel yourself. Put your left hand towards me,

182
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,040
left hand towards me like this, yes.

183
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,880
You all will feel it yourself.

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,080
Now people who have been to gurus,

185
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,680
who have sort of schizophrenic attitude,

186
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,800
who are moody people, frantic, fits, they get all sorts of these,

187
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,000
to extreme to the least you see, who are emotional,

188
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
some women who cry too much, hysterics, all those things

189
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,240
can be controlled by this simple method

190
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
of putting left hand towards the photograph

191
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,600
and right hand towards a candle.

192
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,920
See, it’s working out?

193
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,520
You’ll feel the movement in your head you’ll feel. [Yogi] Yes.

194
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,920
Feeling it now. No?

195
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,920
[Yogi] So, it’s not there.

196
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,480
Now with the right hand up,

197
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,480
those who are running the rat race,

198
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,920
you see big people who think they must earn money and all,

199
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,440
they are running in the politics and

200
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,320
all that kind of a – another madness they have. You see,

201
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,320
that’s also a kind of madness, you see. [Shri Mataji laughs]

202
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,160
So for such people who are having a high blood pressure because of that,

203
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,440
they will have diabetes, they’ll have liver trouble.

204
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,440
Now even for any organ, you see, any organ you take, say heart,

205
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,280
in Sahaja Yoga we have for every organ, two types of nature.

206
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,880
One is the one that is lethargic and another that is overactive.

207
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So supposing you are an overactive person,

208
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,040
then if you are an overactive person,

209
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,520
you are studying very hard

210
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,000
or thinking about the future or planning something,

211
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,840
then, you have a heart which is overactive.

212
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,200
Or you have an intestine which is overactive.

213
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,040
The liver is overactive, the whole system is overactive,

214
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,840
you’ll have high blood pressure

215
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,720
and all the problems of high blood pressure, constipation,

216
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,680
all these things go hand in hand in one personality.

217
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,960
Then, another personality could be a lethargic.

218
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,160
A person who has a lethargic heart,

219
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,000
may get a- has to get a bypass or something like that,

220
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,720
because the heart doesn’t pump.

221
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,600
You may have a lethargic intestine, such a person might

222
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,000
– whatever he eats you see, just goes to the bathroom,

223
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,520
sort of a thing or may be a lethargic liver.

224
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,840
When you have a lethargic liver then you might get allergies.

225
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,400
Allergies are caused by lethargic liver.

226
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,480
But, if you are an overactive person, if you are overactive,

227
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,560
then the same liver which was giving you these allergies,

228
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,480
will give you nausea, a feeling of a sickness,

229
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,040
migraine, and vomiting, emesis.

230
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,800
So there are two types of livers also.

231
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,520
We have two types of kidneys,

232
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,560
two types of, everything is two types.

233
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,800
So if you are a lethargic person, if you have a lethargic problem,

234
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,200
then what you have to do is to use the light.

235
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,440
For all the lethargic troubles, best is the light,

236
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,960
to use the light for lethargic troubles, this is left side.

237
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,600
And for the right sidedness, you can use the Mother Earth.

238
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,080
Mother Earth is the best or water and salt.

239
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,920
So water and salt is very good for people who are suffering

240
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,960
from an over-activity. Now how do you do it?

241
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,400
It’s good for both, but specially for them.

242
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,680
Like you have to put both the hands, first towards the photograph

243
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,240
both the feet in the water, with little salt.

244
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,040
Now if you are feeling the vibrations coming in both the hands,

245
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,000
equally the same, it’s alright, you don’t have to worry.

246
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,360
But supposing, one hand is more and one hand is less.

247
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,720
The hand that is less has to go before the photograph, always.

248
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,960
The hand that is less has to go towards the photograph

249
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,280
and another one has to go out.

250
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,600
And you’ll be amazed, the movement of the thing,

251
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,760
you will feel within yourself these balloons will be moving like that.

252
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,160
And you can feel it, that something is moving in your head,

253
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,160
you are getting relaxed. And gradually, you’ll become a master,

254
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,560
you will know how to handle this body,

255
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,600
absolutely, you‘ll become a master. And when you become master

256
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,200
– people have become masters in eight days, in eight days.

257
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,080
Once you become a master, then you can handle other bodies also

258
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,160
and help other people. It’s as simple as that.

259
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,000
So forget about the past, now the present,

260
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,640
we have to be in the present.

261
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,640
Is there any other question now?

262
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,960
[Yogi] … about mantras…

263
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,120
Mantras, yes. Now, we have got different centers,

264
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,440
and all these centers have got different deities.

265
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,920
As I told you, Lord Jesus Christ is here.,

266
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,560
Moses is here, Krishna is here. We have a chart of that.

267
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,440
We have books which will be given to you.

268
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,440
Now, we have to make, you see-

269
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,000
[Yogi] Excuse me. [Sahaja Yogi brings a big chart]

270
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,680
Yes this is the chart, you see, it’s beautifully done,

271
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,160
this one is very clear cut.

272
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,800
Now on different chakras, we have different deities

273
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,920
– come forward, you come forward and see, alright?

274
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,640
Alright, just let him see. You can pass it on.

275
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,440
[Yogi] May be there’s another chart.

276
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,800
Another chart, alright.

277
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,080
We have books, you see, why not give them books?

278
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,520
[Yogi] …They can have the other books

279
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Open the books, you have got the chart in the books. Can you see?

280
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,080
Now gradually you see, we are trying to get a bigger place for you,

281
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,960
and we should really meet in a hall again. When are you going to –

282
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,320
Sahaja Yogi :… they can meet here first until we get a hall

283
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,240
Yes if you want, we might not be able to get but you can meet here.

284
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,120
You can always come and find out. Now, what is it?

285
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,840
There are books. Now, I’ll show.

286
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,560
These are small books just meant for the beginner, you see.

287
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,560
Now here, this is all given in short.

288
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,640
Now this is the chart you have to follow

289
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,680
– you can pass it on…

290
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,640
Give this to that gentleman also he wanted. Ah, you’ve got.

291
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,120
Gentleman : I got it here.

292
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Oh I see. You also take.

293
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,680
Now. So the mantras are according to the chakra that is in problem.

294
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Supposing your Nabhi chakra is not alright. Alright?

295
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,040
And if you start saying the mantra of this one is no use.

296
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,880
So you must know what center is catching, from your fingers.

297
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,480
Now you can make out here, in this chart if you see

298
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,320
on this side, we have got written the numbers according to the centers.

299
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,720
On this side, if you see it clearly?

300
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,720
Now these are the numbers of the centers, alright?

301
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,200
So then, and also here it is written in this chart,

302
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,520
what are the different deities.

303
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,760
Now, all these deities should be first understood,

304
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,560
where are they, and when you have to say the mantras,

305
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:02,560
what you have to do is coil it into a proper Sahaja Yoga mantra

306
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,080
– so have you given that?

307
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,680
[Yogi] It’s not in these books..

308
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,000
But they will tell you.

309
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,480
The pattern has to be like this, which says,

310
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,480
whatever is the thing is, is woven into the complete

311
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,720
- I mean you are to be recommended, isn’t it? Somebody has to say.

312
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,000
So you have to say that

313
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,800
I am the one who has given you this knowledge.

314
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,440
So just you have to use that particular thing

315
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,280
which they will give you, the pattern, which is very simple.

316
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:38,800
And you have to use these names of these deities, different deities

317
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,880
according, and gradually you’ll be amazed it will work out.

318
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,160
But when you come here, they will tell you, it’s very simple,

319
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,880
it’s very simple. But you must know where the chakras are.

320
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,400
First of all, you must become sensitive.

321
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,320
So I would suggest that you must start using olive oil

322
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,800
for your fingers and for your toes, you see,

323
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,120
rub it nicely, make your fingers sensitive.

324
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,280
Because of various things, our hands have become gross, you see.

325
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,000
To feel it better, use some nice olive oil, massage it nicely.

326
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,480
And sometimes, if you wear the gloves in the night,

327
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,440
they can soften it also. You must soften, soft hands are better.

328
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,440
And the nails should not be very long, not very badly cut,

329
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,080
sort of things you see, and they are to be properly done.

330
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,320
So that when you use on others, they should not feel hurt

331
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,040
with your nails. But for yourself also,

332
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
you should not have very –right hand specially –

333
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,040
because you’ll have to use it like this here,

334
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,800
say, you have a Vishudhi chakra,

335
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,480
then you’ll have to use your Nabhi chakra like that

336
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,920
So what, actually, is the matter with you,

337
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,200
is to be first heard. So first you have to understand yourself,

338
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,120
what is your problem, what you are suffering from,

339
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,200
and then, how to correct.

340
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,080
If you could find out how to correct it and what is your problem,

341
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,480
then it is the easiest thing, is to coil a mantra to improve yourself.

342
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,560
Alright? It’s very simple.

343
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,840
Now you have met me only a day back, I should say,

344
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,800
but you’ll be amazed the knowledge

345
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,880
that you will have now about yourself, will be tremendous.

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,280
So first is SelfRealization, means you know yourself.

347
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,240
Once you know yourself, you start knowing others,

348
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,840
because we are all collectively conscious.

349
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,360
Those who are Realized souls become aware of others.

350
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,560
So first of all, if you want to see your own vibrations,

351
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,280
you have to put yourself into bandhan like this,

352
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,040
as I told you, like this.

353
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,720
Now, let’s do it.

354
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,640
Put your left hand towards me.

355
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,560
[Yogi] Like this towards Shri Mataji…

356
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,000
Now, these are your vibrations, whatever it is, now check,

357
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,320
see now. Which finger is burning? See, carefully.

358
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,600
Now this is left Nabbhi. Now which one is burning, be careful.

359
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,440
Pay attention.

360
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,320
Which one?

361
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,040
[Newcomer] [Inaudible]….

362
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Which one?

363
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,320
May be he is constipated, is he? Does he get constipation?

364
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:55,280
Yes, it’s the liver, sign of liver, you see and also constipated.

365
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,520
So he is more a right sided person,

366
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,280
because right side is this thing.

367
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,600
So he has to put left to the right, like this. Alright?

368
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,800
[Newcomer] I’m just warm [?] and [?]..what could that mean?

369
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,280
You have a heart [problem]

370
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,760
[Newcomer] It’s allergy [?]

371
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:13,480
You put your right hand on your heart.

372
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,480
New Sahaja Yogini : [Inaudible]…. Rather warm.

373
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,320
Warm? Alright, doesn’t matter, and the other one?

374
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,080
Nothing. Alright. So put your left to the right. Left to the right.

375
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,360
[Yogi] You take it- when She says left to the right,

376
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,080
what you’re doing is not just this one,

377
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
put you are actually lifting the left side

378
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,720
And taking the grace from the right.

379
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,520
[Yogi] … because you’re balancing

380
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,240
And taking the grace, you see, on the right side,

381
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,520
because right side is showing nothing.

382
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,200
If the right side is showing nothing,

383
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,400
then what you are doing, you are lifting your left

384
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,920
which is slightly showing and you take up and bring it down,

385
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,160
with your right hand. Left to the right.

386
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,280
[Yogi] If you got problems on the right side,

387
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,840
you take from the left side, and over the top

388
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,640
and bring down the grace into the right side….

389
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,200
Then it’s the opposite, it’s as simple as that.

390
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,240
If she’s not- if you are not feeling at all on right hand,

391
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,800
then you have right hand problem.

392
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,320
You’re not feeling any vibrations, hum?

393
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,200
And left hand, you are feeling what?

394
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,360
[Yogi] Slightly warm on the left side….

395
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,160
So she has to go from right to left.

396
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,280
Just do it yourself now, get into balance

397
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,080
that’s the object of what Shri Mataji is saying.

398
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,720
[Yogini] Can we change hands?

399
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,360
Yes you can, you change hands.

400
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,760
[Yogi] Just to repeat it again, if you have abnormal sensations,

401
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400
heat or something in your right hand, that means there is a damage

402
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,600
on that side, so you lift the left side

403
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,360
and you bring down the grace inti the right side.

404
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,400
Just do that if you got that problem.

405
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,960
Right to the left.

406
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,600
You take your right hand and put it like that.

407
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,080
[Yogi] If you got it in the other direction, you change hand as She said,

408
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,680
and you go the other way. It’s as simple as that.

409
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,880
Until it balances, until it works ou t. Keep doing until it works out.

410
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,480
Did you come to my program before?

411
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,000
No

412
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,200
That’s why. Just it has started, you see,

413
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,600
you have to get your Realization first of all, alright?

414
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,240
You come here. We’ll have to work it out, first of all,

415
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,760
as your Realization has not worked out, that’s why. It just started.

416
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,600
Hum? Let it work out. If the Realization works out,

417
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,280
then only you can feel it properly. That’s why.

418
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,040
Right side, not at all, so I was wondering why. Are you feeling ?

419
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,560
Good. Left hand what are you feeling?

420
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,840
Cool breeze, in the left hand and not on the right. Alright.

421
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,160
So what you do is to take left to the right

422
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,640
No, with the right hand.

423
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,240
[New Yogini] Oh, yes.

424
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,560
Gradually when you practice you will know. Better now? Good?

425
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,360
Good! He’s alright.

426
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,320
Are you alright? How are you feeling?

427
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,760
[Yogi] She’s asking you get heat on the left side or the left hand?

428
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,720
You can get it on left hand or left side, anywhere. Where are you getting?

429
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,080
Yes, you can get it on both the sides. Are you getting on right?

430
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,880
Then you put your left to the right.

431
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,640
No, no, no, left hand towards Me, and right hand like this,

432
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,360
Just raise it and bring it down like this. Don’t go back.

433
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,920
Both the hands cool?

434
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,920
Look at Me. Left hand to Me, like this

435
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,640
and right hand you pick it up, come here and push it down.

436
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,240
She’s alright. You're alright.

437
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,200
What about you? Feeling cool breeze in both the hands?

438
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,800
The balance, yes. You start feeling the balance. That’s the best way.

439
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,480
You have a Vishuddhi that way. Doesn’t matter.

440
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,920
You put your left hand at the back of your chakra, here.

441
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,320
And put your right hand towards Me. Right hand.

442
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,760
What about you? Are you feeling?

443
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,640
Nothing? You never felt any cool breeze? Surprising.

444
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,920
You come from which state? UP!

445
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,320
[Hindi conversation]

446
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,320
New Sahaja Yogini : How long does that type of things ..?

447
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,480
Split of a second.

448
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,640
New Sahaja Yogini : How long will it last, balancing yourself?

449
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,040
[Yogi] How long will the balancing last you?

450
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,440
Last? I mean there is no timing for it.

451
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,400
It can last you for ever, but if you are a very wobbly type,

452
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,080
it may a little bit drop on, but you have to know how to do it, you see?

453
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,520
Now, we can say we are driving a car.

454
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,400
Now, how long will it last there?

455
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,760
As long as you keep it.

456
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,160
You are driving this car, alright?

457
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,760
Now, what is it? Are you feeling the balance now?

458
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,800
[New Yogini] I? Yes.

459
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,040
Good, then it’s good.

460
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,560
[Yogi] When it becomes imbalanced, that’s when you correct it.

461
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,040
[New Yogini] So, just trough the day, you just have to

462
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,600
No, no, no, no, no, no. Now, if you’re in balance,

463
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,480
there is nothing wrong, it’s alright, perfectly alright.

464
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,840
[Yogi] Can you get it when you haven’t had the Realization. You mean the balancing?

465
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Have you got your Realization?

466
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,400
That is the first, that’s the first thing.

467
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,960
Otherwise you have not entered into the kingdom of God, isn’t it?

468
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,840
First thing is to have your Realization and then, now,

469
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,280
put your hands towards me.

470
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,560
[Yogi] Everybody should do that because

471
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,600
the more you put your hands to Mother,

472
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,480
the stronger the vibrations will flow.

473
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,000
Take this chance because it has to develop.

474
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,800
It might be a little uncomfortable, but just keep your hands to Mother.

475
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,920
You got the cool breeze in your hands, are you feeling?

476
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,680
Start, close your eyes.

477
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,920
What about you? No.

478
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,840
[Yogi] Those who haven’t their Realization, put their hands up please.

479
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,160
You come forward. I think best is

480
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,400
- and the rest of the people and Sahaja Yogis can see. Come along.

481
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,360
Now these people can be taught by Sahaja Yogis how to give Realization,

482
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:53,200
you are alright, three of you, go ahead. [People move]

483
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:04,320
And the Sahaja Yogis can meet them and talk to them.

484
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,240
Sit down, sit down.

485
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,480
Just like this. Put your hand.

486
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:57,960
Are you feeling? Do like that with your eyes, do a little bit.

487
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:04,320
Just press them, press your eyes hard, very hard- thrice.

488
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,200
Hard, press them hard, thrice.

489
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,960
Alright?

490
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:20,040
Not yet? It will come. It will work out.

491
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,400
Watch me, watch me here.

492
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:35,000
[Shri Mataji still holds a candle in front of Her face,

493
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,560
then in front of her right hand

494
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,280
and the new people are sent to another room

495
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,480
where Sahaja Yogis will work on them.]

496
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Please take the baby out a little bit, because everybody tries to meditate.

497
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,280
Alright, just for a minute

498
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,360
Don’t feel guilty, none of you should feel guilty.

499
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,680
Everybody has certain problems still. You just go and say:

500
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,880
Mother I am not guilty. Close your eyes, just close your eyes.

501
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,880
There is nothing to feel guilty about anything whatsoever.

502
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,520
Whatever you have done is finished now.

503
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:33,320
You are entering into new awareness now. Into the kingdom of God.

504
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,320
Now you have become the spirit, and spirit cannot be guilty.

505
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,960
Forget about the people who have not come today with you. Anyone.

506
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,280
Just forget them. Just start to be yourself.

507
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,360
They can come later on and you can give them the full advantage.

508
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,240
Those who have got liver problem should take sugar

509
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,440
and they’ll tell you what is to be done.

510
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:06,640
If you have diabetes you can take salt.

511
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,600
And for other people who have arthritis and all that also,

512
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,920
I’ll ask you to bring some petrol or kerosene on,

513
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,680
if not you can come back again and take it from these.

514
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,400
Thank you very much. Enjoy your life.

515
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,000
May God bless you!
