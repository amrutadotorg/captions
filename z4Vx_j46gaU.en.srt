00:00:00,016 --> 00:00:01,962
﻿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,734
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,445
I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

4
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:18,479
then I realised that today is a very good

5
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:21,483
time according to the calendar;

6
00:00:21,684 --> 00:00:26,526
but it is not in the morning,

7
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:31,503
so it had to be the third day of the moon.

8
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:36,838
And as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

9
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,852
we had to wait till it started.

10
00:00:39,103 --> 00:00:41,705
I think, all these things have happened,

11
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:46,618
of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

12
00:00:46,982 --> 00:00:51,331
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

13
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:54,881
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

14
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:57,947
and we don't have to worry about the timing;

15
00:00:58,148 --> 00:01:00,832
Only when it's a formal function or something,

16
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:05,519
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,056
So we have to be present there at right time,

18
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:13,035
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

19
00:01:13,236 --> 00:01:17,196
and we should do in our own way.

20
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:27,006
Now for our travel

21
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:31,386
 and this tour, we have to realise

22
00:01:32,286 --> 00:01:39,036
that we are here to achieve

23
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:44,934
a certain amount of height in our detachment.

24
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:49,942
We have to rise into the realm

25
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:55,878
 of our state,

26
00:01:57,442 --> 00:02:00,641
while the circumstances around us,

27
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:07,922
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

28
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:14,391
or biased, or we should not react to them,

29
00:02:14,837 --> 00:02:20,814
On the contrary we should try to rise above that

30
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:27,302
if there are no events of mishaps.

31
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:32,592
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

32
00:02:34,695 --> 00:02:40,594
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

33
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:43,762
we have to see the obstructions.

34
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,514
For example,

35
00:02:46,715 --> 00:02:51,723
if there is the flow of the water going on

36
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:55,603
and it is smoothly moving,

37
00:02:55,804 --> 00:03:00,854
there's no happening as you call the ghatana,

38
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:05,799
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

39
00:03:06,347 --> 00:03:08,799
then the water splashes against it,

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,244
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

41
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:20,886
this is the sign of Divine

42
00:03:21,174 --> 00:03:27,679
surmounting all the difficulties that are supposed to be there.

43
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,713
Now we are proceeding to Puna

44
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:36,431
and where we will be having a proper session

45
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:39,093
also for marriages and all that.

46
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:42,477
We will have to take a firm decision.

47
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:46,889
I must speak about it today,

48
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:52,459
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

49
00:03:52,674 --> 00:03:57,168
If you have certain concepts

50
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:03,582
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

51
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:07,566
because that's not found in Indian character,

52
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:11,499
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

53
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:15,449
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

54
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,726
it's a trick of the mind

55
00:04:17,927 --> 00:04:21,466
that wants to play tricks with others

56
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:25,428
and enjoys, it is a sign of ego.

57
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:28,155
Absolutely a sign of ego

58
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:32,159
and then you start playing games,

59
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,092
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no".

60
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,478
You go on enjoying those games

61
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,137
and later on you play into it so much

62
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:45,217
that your marriages can never be happy or successful.

63
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,739
That means you are not yet matured for marriage.

64
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,408
For marriage you are to be matured.

65
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:54,562
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

66
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:58,193
that you have had no training at all,

67
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:01,608
parents have never told you how to behave

68
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:04,811
towards your husband, towards your wife,

69
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:07,450
how to make a marriage successful.

70
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:10,771
That is a very important event

71
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,562
and that we should try

72
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:17,390
to establish ourselves in the marriage system.

73
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:24,708
Instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

74
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:28,864
we miss the point, who is the loser?

75
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:32,851
If you go on playing tricks like this

76
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:35,975
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

77
00:05:36,176 --> 00:05:40,957
whatever you may do, whatever type of marriages you'll have,

78
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:43,718
you can never be happy.

79
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,735
Now in the west, as you know, I lead another life also

80
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,572
 and every person I have met,

81
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,493
every person whatever country they may come,

82
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:58,012
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

83
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,875
It seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

84
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:05,633
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

85
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:09,126
and they have funny miserable faces.

86
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:14,333
They don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

87
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:17,161
or something has really gone wrong with them.

88
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:20,742
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

89
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:24,008
because they have missed the point.

90
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:27,915
Marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

91
00:06:28,116 --> 00:06:33,727
Supposing one gives you ambrosia.

92
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:37,821
Amrut, amrut as they call it

93
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:41,980
and then you start playing trick with it.

94
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,688
Who is the loser?

95
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:51,406
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

96
00:06:53,054 --> 00:06:54,967
and enjoy that love.

97
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:57,788
Basically if something is very wrong,

98
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:03,590
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

99
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:07,686
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up.

100
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:11,921
You can change your wife, change your husband, no problem,

101
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:14,457
but there must be some reason behind it,

102
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:20,474
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

103
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,875
I'll try my level best to tell you

104
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:26,319
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

105
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,155
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

106
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:33,525
when it comes to the ego part.

107
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:37,314
They themselves cannot enjoy, dog in the manger policy.

108
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:40,714
Dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

109
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:44,879
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this.

110
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,993
Neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy.

111
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:53,686
And when such stupid couples are there,

112
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,683
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

113
00:07:56,884 --> 00:07:58,684
talking to them, asking them.

114
00:07:58,885 --> 00:08:03,245
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

115
00:08:03,446 --> 00:08:06,019
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

116
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,823
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

117
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:12,093
Actually what have I to gain out of it?

118
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:14,064
This nobody tries to understand.

119
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,454
What I am trying is to make you happy,

120
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:18,724
to get you good husbands and good wives,

121
00:08:18,941 --> 00:08:21,655
that you should have good relationships,

122
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:25,150
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

123
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:28,021
that we should have a society

124
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:32,188
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies,

125
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:37,233
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

126
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:41,371
among ourselves of purity and of holiness.

127
00:08:41,572 --> 00:08:44,741
Instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

128
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:48,788
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

129
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:52,910
Of course one has to try.

130
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:56,555
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

131
00:08:56,756 --> 00:09:01,359
how can I go on clipping them back?

132
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:07,348
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

133
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:09,555
you have the enjoyment of it.

134
00:09:09,756 --> 00:09:17,851
 Now if it's a, say, a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example,

135
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:23,051
but then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

136
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:29,211
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

137
00:09:29,412 --> 00:09:33,238
and all sorts of nonsense that going on.

138
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:37,843
So I again say that, now we are going to Puna

139
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,876
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed.

140
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:44,913
If you go on like this there's no end to it,

141
00:09:45,113 --> 00:09:50,097
also those people who come for marriages and deny it twice,

142
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,701
third time I don't ask them,

143
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:57,116
because it's a joke going on.

144
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:03,745
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

145
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:07,507
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

146
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,711
Yesterday you saw that.

147
00:10:09,912 --> 00:10:12,799
You have different conditionings,

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,005
different styles, different everything,

149
00:10:16,206 --> 00:10:19,556
heights different, ages different, faces different,

150
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:22,775
aptitudes different.

151
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:28,060
So combine all these things, so very difficult.

152
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:31,426
Sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

153
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:34,077
them better to give you a simple woman,

154
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:37,111
so that your little pressure is reduced,

155
00:10:37,325 --> 00:10:41,819
you can share with her but if you are equally educated people,

156
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,358
then both the heads may be...

157
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:56,635
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

158
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:59,434
but somehow or other you can defy

159
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:02,434
and you try to defy it, alright doesn't matter,

160
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:06,180
but who is the loser is the point.

161
00:11:06,386 --> 00:11:08,693
Today I had to speak to you about this,

162
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:13,653
 because in Sahaj we have to take the way it comes as it comes.

163
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:17,683
Whatever comes in our way we should take it.

164
00:11:17,974 --> 00:11:20,749
We should not sort of say: I've fallen in love.

165
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,660
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

166
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:38,022
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

167
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:43,625
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

168
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:45,555
or something absurd.

169
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:47,167
So many people have told me:

170
00:11:47,368 --> 00:11:49,468
 "Mother, I have not fallen in love with her."

171
00:11:49,669 --> 00:11:55,312
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch, or you may fall,

172
00:11:55,837 --> 00:11:59,770
fall into some river of something like that.

173
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:05,016
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

174
00:12:10,297 --> 00:12:16,086
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

175
00:12:17,995 --> 00:12:23,344
if it means that you have felt the love,

176
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:30,600
or if it means you have the sensitivity of feeling the love

177
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:33,619
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

178
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,089
but this falling in love business

179
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,311
has been going on and on and on.

180
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:39,904
Now I would request you

181
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:45,262
that in Sahaja Yoga we cancel this terminology.

182
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:54,017
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga.

183
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:58,260
You have chance for one month to decide for yourself

184
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:00,535
and to find out for yourself.

185
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,782
 Little bit adjustments and understanding

186
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:08,819
can create such a beautiful world for you.

187
00:13:09,391 --> 00:13:14,832
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

188
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:17,630
suddenly you're alright I find,

189
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,941
at the spur of the moment I find suddenly: "No",

190
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:22,188
 I say: "What's this?"

191
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,914
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

192
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:26,163
it has turned round?

193
00:13:26,364 --> 00:13:28,939
One can understand a horse,

194
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:32,388
but I can't understand human beings.

195
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:37,564
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

196
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:43,291
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

197
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:47,389
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

198
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,416
from all over the country,

199
00:13:49,617 --> 00:13:53,240
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

200
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:54,682
that has gone rotten,

201
00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:56,351
while I'm boasting to everyone

202
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:58,393
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

203
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:01,307
I know it's not true,

204
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:06,430
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

205
00:14:06,631 --> 00:14:11,349
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

206
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:15,708
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

207
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:19,863
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

208
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:23,914
to bring about these events.

209
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:28,301
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

210
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:33,148
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

211
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,787
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

212
00:14:36,988 --> 00:14:38,516
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga,

213
00:14:38,717 --> 00:14:43,518
after that, we are enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

214
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:47,592
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost.

215
00:14:47,793 --> 00:14:51,311
That also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

216
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:55,457
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

217
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:58,403
its such a headache.

218
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:05,438
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

219
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,812
because I think there's no problem at all.

220
00:15:09,013 --> 00:15:12,980
Only thing you have decided not to enjoy the game.

221
00:15:14,712 --> 00:15:17,597
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food

222
00:15:17,798 --> 00:15:20,286
you can put some quinine on your tongue

223
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,998
and then say I don't like the food,

224
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,296
something like that. It's absurd.

225
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,799
So try to help me in this,

226
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,348
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

227
00:15:32,548 --> 00:15:34,880
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

228
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:40,360
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

229
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:46,824
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

230
00:15:47,157 --> 00:15:50,836
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

231
00:15:51,898 --> 00:15:54,171
What are you?

232
00:15:54,441 --> 00:15:57,802
What is your education? What is your intellect?

233
00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,788
What do you expect from another person?

234
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:02,419
How much money you have got?

235
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,180
How much money the other person has got?

236
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:08,559
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself, to begin with,

237
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,320
then compare.

238
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,697
But the greatest thing you have to think about,

239
00:16:13,898 --> 00:16:18,265
how many vibrations you have?

240
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,153
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

241
00:16:23,354 --> 00:16:25,847
You are married for your ascent.

242
00:16:26,048 --> 00:16:32,717
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

243
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:38,685
then your should not unnecessarily boast of nonsensical gross things.

244
00:16:38,886 --> 00:16:43,484
The person is much subtler, make yourself that.

245
00:16:44,357 --> 00:16:48,417
Whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

246
00:16:48,937 --> 00:16:52,147
but I just say that see for yourself: where are you?

247
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:55,789
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

248
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,412
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

249
00:16:58,613 --> 00:17:02,220
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

250
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:06,524
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

251
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:10,281
we have to work, we have to save that person,

252
00:17:10,482 --> 00:17:15,606
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

253
00:17:15,884 --> 00:17:21,103
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

254
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:25,075
I think you will understand the seriousness,

255
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,656
this is the most important work

256
00:17:27,857 --> 00:17:32,505
that ever happened on this Earth so far.

257
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,418
Your marriages are very important

258
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,392
and you have seen the photographs

259
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:40,946
with the Gods themselves have blessed you.

260
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:44,413
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

261
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,788
they all were present in your marriage

262
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:50,537
and how they were giving you tributes

263
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:55,287
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

264
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:59,509
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

265
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,061
But if you are not a seeker

266
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:04,553
and if you are not seeking your higher ascent,

267
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:08,249
then you go into nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

268
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,967
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

269
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,272
don't think too much of yourself.

270
00:18:14,473 --> 00:18:16,947
Another note of caution,

271
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:22,301
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

272
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:25,012
so don't get mad.

273
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,711
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

274
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:32,239
It's done in India to create better relationships,

275
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,267
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

276
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:41,068
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

277
00:18:41,385 --> 00:18:43,254
so better be careful.

278
00:18:43,472 --> 00:18:46,298
It's a custom here to look after the son-in-law,

279
00:18:46,499 --> 00:18:49,904
to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

280
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:53,084
Now it is ingrained from ages,

281
00:18:53,285 --> 00:18:55,676
 it doesn't mean that you are God,

282
00:18:55,877 --> 00:18:59,714
or you are in some superlative condition.

283
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:04,695
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

284
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:07,163
they look after the daughter-in-law,

285
00:19:07,364 --> 00:19:10,736
or the son-in-law, normally.

286
00:19:11,077 --> 00:19:14,951
And you should not carry away ideas,

287
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:18,013
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

288
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:19,563
I have seen, they don't care.

289
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:23,143
Once that they are married, they are finished, it's not so,

290
00:19:23,344 --> 00:19:24,642
so please be careful.

291
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:26,212
When you are marrying Indians,

292
00:19:26,413 --> 00:19:30,666
you will find the parents will quite pamper you, look after you,

293
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:34,351
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

294
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:38,993
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

295
00:19:39,517 --> 00:19:45,048
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

296
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:47,173
and should not get pampered,

297
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:49,879
on the contrary should feel blissful about it.

298
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,685
But when it is done I have seen suddenly they go off

299
00:19:53,886 --> 00:19:55,796
and they think no end of themselves,

300
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:58,895
their value system goes off.

301
00:19:59,096 --> 00:20:02,789
It's because, so far we have had no education,

302
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,545
no training about marriages.

303
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:10,001
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

304
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:13,729
But indians also you see, expect you to understand

305
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:15,598
their customs sometimes too much.

306
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:18,361
For example yesterday the garlands were given

307
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:20,489
at the time when the garlands were given,

308
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,970
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

309
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:27,131
but some of you took the garland put it you,

310
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:31,034
they regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

311
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,798
but it is so.

312
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:37,160
So when we are in India we have to understand Indians,

313
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:40,839
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

314
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,556
For example in the west you just go on saying,

315
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:47,152
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry.

316
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,903
It is so confusing sometimes.

317
00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:53,193
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

318
00:20:53,394 --> 00:20:57,237
I mean, I sometimes shake with nine hundred people at a time,

319
00:20:57,484 --> 00:21:01,071
and while they are going back again nine hundred people.

320
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:03,991
I think namaste is a better idea.

321
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:07,151
See to shake hands with every sort of a person,

322
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:10,966
you'll catch from every one, but is a custom,

323
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:14,170
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

324
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:18,975
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

325
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:23,731
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

326
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:26,585
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

327
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:30,404
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

328
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:33,832
and the ladies don't take garlands on their,

329
00:21:34,033 --> 00:21:36,816
you see, because any man cannot garland a lady,

330
00:21:37,017 --> 00:21:39,516
because is only husband has the right,

331
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:42,115
See, so anyone won't garland.

332
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:45,254
or a son can garland the mother,

333
00:21:45,552 --> 00:21:48,531
but any man cannot garland any lady

334
00:21:48,732 --> 00:21:50,635
who is of a younger age,

335
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:54,456
or who is not yet married and even if married,

336
00:21:54,657 --> 00:21:58,204
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright.

337
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:02,417
So these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

338
00:22:02,618 --> 00:22:06,726
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street,

339
00:22:07,307 --> 00:22:11,821
even if the leaders here are garlanded

340
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:15,025
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

341
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:19,577
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out.

342
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:24,947
So these are few customs which must be understood

343
00:22:25,148 --> 00:22:27,744
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic.

344
00:22:27,945 --> 00:22:30,899
Whatever is illogical we can give up,

345
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,785
whatever is logical we have to lake it and understand it.

346
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:37,670
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

347
00:22:37,878 --> 00:22:39,821
children also started laughing, because they thought

348
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:42,473
they are garlanding themselves.

349
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:47,339
it's like doing Aarti to yourself, you know,

350
00:22:47,868 --> 00:22:50,024
amounts to that.

351
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:53,494
So you can understand why they were laughing.

352
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:58,594
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

353
00:22:59,414 --> 00:23:03,284
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

354
00:23:03,498 --> 00:23:07,112
yesterday was, Left Vishuddhi was too much.

355
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:10,363
Perhaps maybe in the morning I said you were allready late

356
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:13,840
for the formal programme, I don't know,

357
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:17,727
whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

358
00:23:17,928 --> 00:23:20,355
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

359
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:22,235
in any formal programme.

360
00:23:22,436 --> 00:23:27,076
But it seems such a Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

361
00:23:27,277 --> 00:23:29,339
and I just knew what it was.

362
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:31,942
So Mother says to you things

363
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:34,193
which should not hurt you in any way

364
00:23:34,394 --> 00:23:36,524
and you should not take it that seriously

365
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:39,349
 but should understand that next time we should not do so,

366
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,009
otherwise you are all wonderful people. You are beautiful people,

367
00:23:43,303 --> 00:23:45,225
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

368
00:23:45,401 --> 00:23:47,244
but I am very proud of you.

369
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:49,185
I'm extremely proud of you,

370
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,569
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

371
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:55,589
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

372
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,182
I don't know what should I do.

373
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,983
So not to take things that seriously.

374
00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:07,199
There's nothing so much wrong.

375
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:10,564
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

376
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:13,256
it's for our good, for our enjoyment.

377
00:24:13,457 --> 00:24:16,082
Everything to increase your enjoyment.

378
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,390
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

379
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:25,145
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

380
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,286
all this is done.

381
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:33,257
