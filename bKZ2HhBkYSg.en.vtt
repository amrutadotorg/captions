79
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.590
Hey Adima,

it's a good song.

87
00:09:14.349 --> 00:09:17.950
Somebody in uh Bombay wrote this Jitend Ravisheki.

88
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.739
Have you heard Jitend Rahihey?

89
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:20.619
He wrote.

90
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:23.479
No,

91
00:09:23.559 --> 00:09:25.309
Damle wrote the last stanza.

92
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.719
Damle wrote the last stanza.

93
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:31.559
Mother played this song very well on the harmonium,

94
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:32.820
so when she comes down,

95
00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:33.380
maybe

96
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:37.320
are likely to come down.

97
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:37.969
When she comes,

98
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.010
we'll ask her to play,

99
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.929
and we can all sing.

100
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:41.409
Yeah.

101
00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:46.130
We can sing,

102
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.729

suburb.

115
00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:29.989

119
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:34.940
yeah.

120
00:10:38.599 --> 00:10:38.989
Correct.

121
00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:41.440
No,

122
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.710
we can do that.

123
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:19.940
I'm sorry.

124
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:22.599
There is a break,

125
00:11:22.609 --> 00:11:23.760

126
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:25.690
No tea break?

127
00:11:28.109 --> 00:11:28.849
Shit for something.

128
00:11:29.219 --> 00:11:29.869
Shit.

129
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.669
What is this?

130
00:11:32.929 --> 00:11:34.869
Mommy's there and Martha is there.

131
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.880
And what about you?

132
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.070
He's here.

133
00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:38.659
Everyone is here,

134
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.380
all right?

135
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:39.719
Uh,

136
00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:40.320
good.

137
00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:41.479
I didn't tell you that.

138
00:11:41.489 --> 00:11:41.500
Yes,

139
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:41.539
you have that,

140
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:47.270
huh,

141
00:11:47.599 --> 00:11:49.159
so you all have been enjoying a lot,

142
00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:49.440
huh.

143
00:11:50.869 --> 00:11:51.380
That's good.

144
00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:53.340
Have

145
00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:57.039
Now today's meeting was very successful,

146
00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:58.169
I should say.

147
00:11:58.559 --> 00:12:00.289
The lawyer got his realisation.

148
00:12:00.909 --> 00:12:01.890
Everything has worked out.

149
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.119
I,

150
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.400
today's lecture was good,

151
00:12:07.409 --> 00:12:07.859
I think,

152
00:12:07.989 --> 00:12:09.059
about our culture.

153
00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.059
In general I told you what is to be done.

154
00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.280
And how to achieve it.

155
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:18.669
Am I?

156
00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:19.690
Yes,

157
00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:20.270
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:23.049 --> 00:12:23.059
it.

159
00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:26.369
All right.

160
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:29.750
Now

161
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:33.659
I've been

162
00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:36.869
Trying to find out why in the west.

163
00:12:38.289 --> 00:12:41.270
Sir Jui after realisation catch from others.

164
00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:45.219
Not in it.

165
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:49.929
Now the

166
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.909
difference is like this,

167
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.390
we don't know what

168
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:54.700
sketch means.

169
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:57.549
Supposing

170
00:12:57.979 --> 00:13:01.190
you get pain from somebody else or you feel

171
00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:02.780
pain on one finger,

172
00:13:02.869 --> 00:13:04.250
I feel it quite a lot.

173
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.299
If you feel the pain in your head,

174
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.969
you feel the pain in the stomach,

175
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.659
or you feel the pain on your fingertips.

176
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.419
Then of course it's a serious matter.

177
00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:20.659
But even if you feel the heat and the cold.

178
00:13:21.739 --> 00:13:21.750
Also

179
00:13:23.489 --> 00:13:24.679
Well I should think about it.

180
00:13:25.729 --> 00:13:26.789
If you feel the

181
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:29.130
Tingly

182
00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.510
Still,

183
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.619
you're not catchy.

184
00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:36.809
You're like a barometer.

185
00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:38.359
You're just

186
00:13:38.599 --> 00:13:39.830
feeling what is

187
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.119
wrong with the other person.

188
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.409
So if it is heat.

189
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.070
That my

190
00:13:48.549 --> 00:13:49.179
miss.

191
00:13:49.869 --> 00:13:51.690
It is a right-sided problem,

192
00:13:51.859 --> 00:13:52.900
a physical problem.

193
00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.679
If you feel the cold,

194
00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.330
it means the left sided or the tingling.

195
00:14:00.489 --> 00:14:02.000
Means a left-sided problem.

196
00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.960
But could be on the right or left,

197
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:05.890
could be anywhere.

198
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.119
Could be a combination,

199
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.010
but now you are feeling it.

200
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.049
But you reach a stage here very easily,

201
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.520
I've seen.

202
00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:19.619
That you don't feel anything that you have gotten,

203
00:14:19.869 --> 00:14:20.789
you don't feel anything.

204
00:14:22.849 --> 00:14:25.219
But what happens actually is that.

205
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.760
You accept

206
00:14:36.169 --> 00:14:37.909
The suggestions that come.

207
00:14:39.049 --> 00:14:40.580
From the catches

208
00:14:40.849 --> 00:14:42.049
and you become them.

209
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080
That's a real catch.

210
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.909
But a person doesn't feel anything.

211
00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.440
He cannot feel his ego,

212
00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:50.950
Can feel his super ego,

213
00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:53.229
Can feel his chakras.

214
00:14:53.469 --> 00:14:54.880
Then a person is really caught.

215
00:14:58.169 --> 00:15:00.640
Such a person may feel the catches of others,

216
00:15:01.169 --> 00:15:02.369
but not not of it.

217
00:15:03.469 --> 00:15:06.710
Then you are caught up because the ideas of catches.

218
00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:12.299
are working through it

219
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.969
And this is a very common phenomenon.

220
00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:21.549
You ask the French,

221
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.030
I said,

222
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:23.020
like this.

223
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:24.859
How are you?

224
00:15:27.059 --> 00:15:28.570
Understand anything you like.

225
00:15:32.169 --> 00:15:36.030
You ask anyone according to the nationality and the style,

226
00:15:36.239 --> 00:15:37.799
they all say they are wobblies.

227
00:15:40.469 --> 00:15:41.369
That's truthful.

228
00:15:41.469 --> 00:15:42.219
That's honest.

229
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.080
But it's not good.

230
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.909
Everything truthful need not be good.

231
00:15:57.349 --> 00:15:59.289
So I was wondering what's the matter?

232
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.320
Uh today Doctor Bolier gave me a very good point.

233
00:16:04.109 --> 00:16:06.679
He told me they are not steady people to begin with.

234
00:16:06.789 --> 00:16:08.169
It's in the west

235
00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:09.679
people are not steady.

236
00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.500
The roots

237
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:14.679
Are very light

238
00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.780
And also the people who come from India,

239
00:16:17.859 --> 00:16:19.140
many become like.

240
00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:23.010
So they're unsteady people like

241
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.489
the trees with or we can see the plants with very small roots.

242
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.119
So the wind comes,

243
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.929
they go to the left or to the right.

244
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.840
The roots are taken

245
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.609
So there is no depth.

246
00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.340
That's why it happened.

247
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.179
It can be any way.

248
00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.030
It can work out any way.

249
00:16:51.109 --> 00:16:52.820
Say it goes to the ego,

250
00:16:53.109 --> 00:16:54.349
you start cheating yourself.

251
00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.619
At the

252
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.000
Or you start shouting,

253
00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:00.409
start saying things.

254
00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:03.090
In a way that you should not say.

255
00:17:07.208 --> 00:17:08.318
Is Michael here?

256
00:17:09.979 --> 00:17:10.189
No,

257
00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:10.589
yeah.

258
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:11.300
All right,

259
00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:12.219
come and sit here.

260
00:17:14.189 --> 00:17:14.650
Sudar

261
00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.390
And then a person

262
00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.949
is he never wants to get out of it.

263
00:17:22.618 --> 00:17:24.118
He doesn't want to get out of it,

264
00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:25.489
especially if it's an ego.

265
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.689
He will shout,

266
00:17:27.848 --> 00:17:28.540
he'll scream.

267
00:17:28.689 --> 00:17:29.959
He'll intimidate others.

268
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.689
He'll be

269
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.500
jumping on the person.

270
00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.410
Doing all kinds of things,

271
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.800
but he will not try to get out of it.

272
00:17:40.239 --> 00:17:41.640
That's one thing about ego.

273
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:45.250
The biggest problem is he never tries to get out of it.

274
00:17:45.479 --> 00:17:46.430
At worst

275
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:47.520
he will

276
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.550
try to cheat himself or she will try to cheat herself

277
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.680
very nicely.

278
00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:53.739
Always try

279
00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:55.099
To tell,

280
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.459
oh,

281
00:17:55.489 --> 00:17:56.280
I'm happy.

282
00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.250
I'm all right.

283
00:17:58.569 --> 00:17:59.319
You are all right,

284
00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:00.410
but others are not.

285
00:18:02.489 --> 00:18:02.500
Because

286
00:18:03.199 --> 00:18:05.000
ego aggresses others.

287
00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:09.930
So a person who is aggressive doesn't feel the burn.

288
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.250
Or the heart

289
00:18:15.459 --> 00:18:16.800
It goes on like that.

290
00:18:17.819 --> 00:18:18.229
Actually,

291
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.930
such a person has to

292
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:24.050
get into a very big turmoil or a very big problem

293
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.069
or a very big hit

294
00:18:26.349 --> 00:18:27.229
to get out of it.

295
00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:28.109
It's not easy.

296
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:31.709
After,

297
00:18:31.719 --> 00:18:32.630
after all,

298
00:18:32.959 --> 00:18:34.270
after realisation,

299
00:18:34.869 --> 00:18:37.229
you should start seeing your ego clearly.

300
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.670
If you are still shouting one thing,

301
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.339
if you are particular about time.

302
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.400
That's a sure and certain sign of a very big ego.

303
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.489
Throw away your watches.

304
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.739
Just throw away your watches.

305
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:56.319
That's one of the ways I've seen people assert

306
00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.280
their ego.

307
00:18:57.489 --> 00:18:58.430
Start now,

308
00:18:58.530 --> 00:18:58.930
this,

309
00:18:58.939 --> 00:18:59.420
that.

310
00:19:00.469 --> 00:19:01.069
So what?

311
00:19:14.369 --> 00:19:15.790
The speediness,

312
00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:16.420
the

313
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.180
exactness,

314
00:19:18.589 --> 00:19:20.150
you must do this by this time.

315
00:19:20.229 --> 00:19:21.630
It must finish at this time.

316
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.800
We had one horrible fellow who came with me to America first time.

317
00:19:26.839 --> 00:19:28.189
I had a bad time with him.

318
00:19:28.819 --> 00:19:30.280
But then we sent him by another ship.

319
00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:32.520
He was an ambassador and this and that.

320
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.300
I'm very particular about finishing the

321
00:19:38.109 --> 00:19:39.030
programme at 9,

322
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.660
but I would start it at 9 just to tease it.

323
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:43.050
Uh,

324
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.930
I finish at one o'clock.

325
00:19:45.989 --> 00:19:47.099
And then we threw him out.

326
00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.069
Absolutely he was such a useless fellow.

327
00:19:49.339 --> 00:19:50.270
We got fed up with him.

328
00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.380
I said you are a liability to good for nothing.

329
00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:53.189
Get out of such.

330
00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:56.640
And then,

331
00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:57.449
you know what happened,

332
00:19:57.489 --> 00:19:58.739
he was such a frightened man.

333
00:19:59.369 --> 00:20:00.849
I don't know what happened to him.

334
00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:04.270
He was telephoned to me.

335
00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:07.640
That the customs came to him.

336
00:20:07.719 --> 00:20:09.829
I don't know why customs went to I

337
00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:12.109
I never knew what was happening.

338
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.229
Customs people came to him and asked him if he had smuggled some things.

339
00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:20.900
And I was shocked,

340
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:21.140
you know.

341
00:20:21.209 --> 00:20:21.599
I said,

342
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:21.880
no.

343
00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:22.849
How is it?

344
00:20:22.969 --> 00:20:23.209
he said,

345
00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.969
You better come to the police and tell them

346
00:20:24.969 --> 00:20:27.089
at the customs that I never smuggled anything.

347
00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:27.969
But I said,

348
00:20:28.079 --> 00:20:28.160
Sir,

349
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.479
you never smuggled.

350
00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:30.239
No question,

351
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:31.449
but you never travelled with me,

352
00:20:31.569 --> 00:20:32.020
came by.

353
00:20:32.489 --> 00:20:32.810
But still,

354
00:20:32.849 --> 00:20:33.449
you better come,

355
00:20:33.459 --> 00:20:33.709
please.

356
00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:34.520
I beg of you,

357
00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.199
please come and tell the customs.

358
00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:36.930
But I said,

359
00:20:37.089 --> 00:20:39.410
how are they asking such a stupid question like that?

360
00:20:40.579 --> 00:20:42.290
That you have smuggled something.

361
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.010
So I said,

362
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.410
all right,

363
00:20:47.569 --> 00:20:47.770
I mean,

364
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.209
he was so humble down,

365
00:20:49.449 --> 00:20:52.609
so humble down because all his reputation was at stake.

366
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400
So

367
00:20:59.060 --> 00:20:59.900
I went with him.

368
00:21:01.599 --> 00:21:02.739
And I asked him,

369
00:21:03.449 --> 00:21:04.579
what is the problem?

370
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:05.069
They said,

371
00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:05.229
No,

372
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.709
you just don't come into this.

373
00:21:07.819 --> 00:21:10.619
This man has smuggled diamonds you know for.

374
00:21:12.359 --> 00:21:12.619
Myself,

375
00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.439
can you say such a thing to such a man.

376
00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:16.750
He was my husband's boss once upon a time,

377
00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.880
such a big man like you.

378
00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:21.829
He also contested election for presidentship in India,

379
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:23.180
you can imagine.

380
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:27.500
And he wanted me to certify that he never smoked.

381
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.689
So I said,

382
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.170
what makes you think that way?

383
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:30.680
He said,

384
00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:33.119
we have got reports from Hong Kong Bank.

385
00:21:33.369 --> 00:21:35.589
We've got reports from Los Angeles,

386
00:21:35.969 --> 00:21:36.199
uh,

387
00:21:36.209 --> 00:21:38.530
that he purchased diamonds in Hong Kong.

388
00:21:38.689 --> 00:21:41.119
He took them to Los Angeles and he gave.

389
00:21:42.959 --> 00:21:44.319
Actually came by another ship,

390
00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:45.390
so I did not know.

391
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.540
Then I discovered that on the other ship when he was travelling,

392
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.310
he was very egoistical fellow troubling everybody,

393
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.030
uh,

394
00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:54.319
getting after the cooks,

395
00:21:54.439 --> 00:21:55.829
getting after this person,

396
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.920
I must have food at this time and that time.

397
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:04.849
So then I discovered that all the crew had decided to throw him overboard.

398
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:07.810
And

399
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.849
they planned it very well

400
00:22:10.229 --> 00:22:12.380
to say that he got drunk and fell off,

401
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.030
that they can do very easily,

402
00:22:14.189 --> 00:22:14.790
all of them.

403
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:17.260
But then

404
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.400
I think they saw my photograph in his room and all that,

405
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.349
so they stopped it,

406
00:22:21.439 --> 00:22:22.040
they did not.

407
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:23.880
When they came back,

408
00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.380
they did all this mischief to inform the customs about.

409
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.739
But actually he was harassed for months together and then

410
00:22:34.739 --> 00:22:37.150
I discovered it and I saved him out of that.

411
00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.390
He was harassed.

412
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.069
And they gave exact date when he arrived,

413
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:43.949
when he came,

414
00:22:44.209 --> 00:22:45.599
when he went to Hong Kong,

415
00:22:46.189 --> 00:22:47.910
everything into such details.

416
00:22:50.239 --> 00:22:51.050
That I didn't know,

417
00:22:51.069 --> 00:22:53.859
and they joined hands with the ship by which we had gone.

418
00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:01.780
Because he troubled everyone with his time with his 8 o'clock means 8 o'clock.

419
00:23:01.829 --> 00:23:03.079
I want to have food at 8 o'clock.

420
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:08.760
And the ship people got angry because this was a ship which was,

421
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:09.979
uh,

422
00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:10.920
what do you call?

423
00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:12.790
A

424
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:18.079
merchant ship and we were allowed to go as travellers because we,

425
00:23:18.849 --> 00:23:20.729
my husband being the chairman,

426
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:23.760
was we got the owner's cables in that he travelled,

427
00:23:24.369 --> 00:23:27.410
but he tried to show off so much that he said that I

428
00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.680
must give him my room and he should stay in my room.

429
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.410
Captain said that we can't do because this is the

430
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.800
owner's wife because of her grace you are here.

431
00:23:35.709 --> 00:23:38.140
But he fought so much as it better you but Captain Woo.

432
00:23:40.209 --> 00:23:43.920
And I did not know even our ship had decided to throw him overboard.

433
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:48.670
So now,

434
00:23:49.209 --> 00:23:49.709
but

435
00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:56.329
it was impossible for me to take him out of his ego because he would not realise it.

436
00:23:57.199 --> 00:23:58.609
Very hot tempered man

437
00:23:58.839 --> 00:24:02.030
is to intimidate people and to shout at everyone,

438
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.050
and

439
00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:03.630
first,

440
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:03.959
of course,

441
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:04.920
people got frightened,

442
00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:05.400
but you know,

443
00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.469
people are very different types.

444
00:24:08.209 --> 00:24:10.739
And whenever he passed through this to behind him,

445
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:11.680
say like this.

446
00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.089
I would say as a person are you doing?

447
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.790
All of them,

448
00:24:18.949 --> 00:24:22.609
nobody had any respect for him because he had no respect for him.

449
00:24:25.119 --> 00:24:27.739
And then this captain came and he told me that

450
00:24:28.030 --> 00:24:30.469
we hated that man from the bottom of our heart.

451
00:24:31.449 --> 00:24:31.770
He was,

452
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.920
he had showed no respect to you also.

453
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.319
I said no,

454
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:34.510
no,

455
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.400
he was respectful to.

456
00:24:36.489 --> 00:24:38.589
But he showed no respect to us.

457
00:24:38.959 --> 00:24:39.989
You were so kind.

458
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.319
You were so compassionate.

459
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.750
You were so respectful.

460
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.150
You were so nice,

461
00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:46.709
and this fellow was trying to show off so much

462
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.400
that we all hated him because he had no respect.

463
00:24:50.969 --> 00:24:52.540
He has travelled all over the world.

464
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:53.750
He was an ambassador,

465
00:24:53.829 --> 00:24:54.410
this thing,

466
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.300
that thing,

467
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.030
and this ego comes up on such people.

468
00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.579
All right.

469
00:25:00.709 --> 00:25:02.229
Forgive them for that,

470
00:25:02.589 --> 00:25:04.000
but they cannot come in surgery.

471
00:25:04.949 --> 00:25:06.579
Such people are prohibited

472
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:07.469
to come in surgery.

473
00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.229
So we have to understand first of all,

474
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.209
we have got.

475
00:25:18.189 --> 00:25:19.680
In ourselves

476
00:25:20.089 --> 00:25:21.520
a tremendous

477
00:25:22.619 --> 00:25:25.500
Type of ego which keeps us away from reality.

478
00:25:25.579 --> 00:25:26.420
There's a big gap.

479
00:25:27.439 --> 00:25:28.589
Here is reality.

480
00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.829
It is sir here.

481
00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.060
You cannot be combined with the reality,

482
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.310
but in between lies this horrible stuff,

483
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.729
colleague.

484
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:39.449
Which intimidates everyone

485
00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:41.380
makes everyone miserable.

486
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.020
Cannot get out of it because it doesn't make you miserable at all.

487
00:25:46.229 --> 00:25:46.969
I feel happy also.

488
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.489
Egoistical person is always very happy because he can dominate every person.

489
00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:56.040
He dominate his wife or dominate her husband,

490
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.050
do all kinds of things to dominate and enjoy and satisfy them.

491
00:26:03.479 --> 00:26:05.540
This is what the whole of the West did.

492
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.310
Once upon a time they went round up to China,

493
00:26:09.459 --> 00:26:09.869
I imagine.

494
00:26:11.329 --> 00:26:12.839
They were rounded up to.

495
00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.939
All the places that was possible

496
00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.170
tried to dominate.

497
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:17.969
Thank God,

498
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.410
Columbus missed.

499
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.270
Coming to India,

500
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.060
otherwise you would not have seen me here.

501
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.250
He would have killed all of us

502
00:26:27.599 --> 00:26:29.109
and put all the Spanish,

503
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.910
and then on top of that all the Portuguese

504
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.400
and all kinds of few people would have been there

505
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.479
in India and we would be somewhere dead permanently.

506
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.750
As I finished the races here,

507
00:26:43.199 --> 00:26:44.069
do you know?

508
00:26:45.369 --> 00:26:48.910
We are enjoying on the graves of these people with the ego.

509
00:26:51.719 --> 00:26:53.829
How can God forgive Americans for that?

510
00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:57.680
What have we done?

511
00:26:58.199 --> 00:26:59.030
Do we deserve?

512
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:01.030
To enjoy all these things,

513
00:27:01.109 --> 00:27:03.310
we are plunderers actually if you think so

514
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.260
real plunderers

515
00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.540
coming to somebody's land occupying it nicely,

516
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:09.510
sitting there

517
00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:11.140
in a cult of power.

518
00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.050
Thinking ignorant of yourself,

519
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.650
stupid as we are.

520
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:19.630
We are thieves.

521
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.119
We are thugs.

522
00:27:24.619 --> 00:27:27.630
Taken advantage of the simplicity of history,

523
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.979
but God doesn't forgive such aggressors.

524
00:27:34.229 --> 00:27:35.619
That's one big problem.

525
00:27:36.729 --> 00:27:38.319
With that thing in you.

526
00:27:39.219 --> 00:27:40.660
You cannot be deep.

527
00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:42.930
As soon as you'll go deep,

528
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.910
you'll see this.

529
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.229
You don't want to go deep because you don't want to face your ego.

530
00:27:50.369 --> 00:27:51.489
As soon as you go deep,

531
00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:52.319
you see your ego,

532
00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:54.930
and you're going to left to show thee finished.

533
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.910
But after realisation.

534
00:28:02.699 --> 00:28:03.780
You can go.

535
00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.479
With complete confidence

536
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.050
that we are going

537
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.609
to see our ego nicely

538
00:28:11.219 --> 00:28:12.770
of our forefathers,

539
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.859
we are the only ones who can save the souls

540
00:28:15.859 --> 00:28:18.959
of these horrible people who came on this earth,

541
00:28:19.219 --> 00:28:20.770
on this side of the earth,

542
00:28:20.939 --> 00:28:23.060
and killed so many Indians.

543
00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:25.910
You're the ones

544
00:28:27.319 --> 00:28:27.479
I

545
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:33.420
Otherwise,

546
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:34.890
all these souls

547
00:28:35.449 --> 00:28:37.650
will become worms or something in the hell,

548
00:28:37.689 --> 00:28:39.479
I think I don't know what they can become.

549
00:28:46.079 --> 00:28:47.380
The big responsibility.

550
00:28:49.209 --> 00:28:50.949
And in that responsibility,

551
00:28:51.079 --> 00:28:52.920
you should become deeper.

552
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:59.560
I've seen ego is such even in Sergioga

553
00:29:00.589 --> 00:29:03.859
we have had people who made money out of Sergioga with their ego.

554
00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:04.819
What's wrong?

555
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640
OK

556
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.449
They can't forgive themselves all the time.

557
00:29:11.609 --> 00:29:12.479
There's no problem.

558
00:29:14.359 --> 00:29:16.109
But they can't forgive other people.

559
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.829
And I tell you it is easier.

560
00:29:22.349 --> 00:29:25.060
To cure a person who suffers from left side

561
00:29:25.229 --> 00:29:27.589
than to cure a person who suffers from right

562
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.910
because the left sided person feels the pangs.

563
00:29:31.589 --> 00:29:33.689
He gets the aches very badly,

564
00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:35.910
he behaves like a mad person,

565
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:37.319
he gets muddled up.

566
00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.250
He gets cheated.

567
00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:43.390
Everybody dominates him.

568
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.989
He becomes miserable,

569
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.599
so the left-sided person.

570
00:29:48.189 --> 00:29:49.239
Can be easily,

571
00:29:50.089 --> 00:29:53.709
but always a right sided person will say I'm left sided,

572
00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:54.520
it's not.

573
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.329
And that is why

574
00:30:04.579 --> 00:30:08.290
one should understand that evil is to be faced

575
00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.300
openly,

576
00:30:09.469 --> 00:30:11.579
clearly is bravery.

577
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.219
And see to it that the single person.

578
00:30:19.949 --> 00:30:22.089
But people have never talked about it

579
00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.719
in the West about ego.

580
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.560
It's a recent talk.

581
00:30:26.189 --> 00:30:28.369
Nobody talks because if I read Saturn,

582
00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.369
who was a recent philosopher,

583
00:30:30.459 --> 00:30:33.599
if I read this horrible fellow Steiner,

584
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.290
he's a recent fellow.

585
00:30:36.619 --> 00:30:37.160
Uh,

586
00:30:37.329 --> 00:30:38.890
even in the advertisement they say,

587
00:30:38.979 --> 00:30:39.239
oh,

588
00:30:39.449 --> 00:30:41.560
what a great thing it is to smoke.

589
00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:46.339
So nobody recognised it for a long time,

590
00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.609
but in India it was recognised long,

591
00:30:49.739 --> 00:30:50.300
long time back.

592
00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:50.819
So they said,

593
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.300
oh God,

594
00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.449
give me everything,

595
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.969
but not the stupid ego

596
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:54.930
from.

597
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.640
Very childhood that taught ego.

598
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.729
We cannot say many things which you easily say like I hate you.

599
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:08.219
I cannot see

600
00:31:10.229 --> 00:31:11.130
What do you think of yourself?

601
00:31:11.979 --> 00:31:12.910
What are you to hate?

602
00:31:13.099 --> 00:31:14.719
Hatred is a disease,

603
00:31:14.979 --> 00:31:16.530
and how can you have that disease?

604
00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:19.599
Keep your eyes open.

605
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:23.900
Hatred is

606
00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:26.430
A dirty things.

607
00:31:28.479 --> 00:31:28.949
Like

608
00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:30.000
eating filth.

609
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.560
How can I say I am eating filth do it.

610
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.900
That's how we've learned not to

611
00:31:40.119 --> 00:31:40.380
say,

612
00:31:40.439 --> 00:31:41.229
not to think.

613
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.560
If you hate someone.

614
00:31:43.479 --> 00:31:45.410
If you go and tell your mother I hate such a person,

615
00:31:45.489 --> 00:31:47.209
she'll give you two tight slaps on the face.

616
00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:47.890
No argument,

617
00:31:47.959 --> 00:31:48.250
nothing.

618
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.060
That is how

619
00:31:56.589 --> 00:31:58.739
in India people are very deep people.

620
00:31:59.069 --> 00:32:00.300
They may not be so afraid.

621
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.709
They may not be so sophisticated.

622
00:32:03.189 --> 00:32:04.400
They may not be so

623
00:32:04.619 --> 00:32:05.339
clever,

624
00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.439
maybe everything,

625
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:07.050
but

626
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.260
in evolution part they are much higher

627
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.420
because they have very,

628
00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.609
very deep roots.

629
00:32:12.709 --> 00:32:13.880
Once they find

630
00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:15.189
Sajoga.

631
00:32:16.119 --> 00:32:16.979
Once they come to it,

632
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.400
if they are not westernised,

633
00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:19.839
that's a very big if.

634
00:32:23.469 --> 00:32:26.800
They take to Sayga so easily they never catch.

635
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:28.670
I've never heard of anybody by catching.

636
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.380
Like

637
00:32:32.839 --> 00:32:35.030
Means they catch in the sense that they

638
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:35.839
are like bar

639
00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.359
barometers or they give barometric reading.

640
00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:44.719
But they never catch in the sense you today you find a lady,

641
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.869
uh,

642
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.250
extremely sweet and nice go to her house,

643
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:49.650
she gives you food next day she

644
00:32:50.229 --> 00:32:51.280
she looks at you like it.

645
00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:52.910
Uh

646
00:32:54.319 --> 00:32:55.119
Digress

647
00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.780
That's not possible.

648
00:32:58.739 --> 00:32:59.979
There's consistency there

649
00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.400
Now today supposing we have Doctor Blier here see me

650
00:33:06.069 --> 00:33:08.430
tomorrow you won't find him shouting at you.

651
00:33:09.689 --> 00:33:10.280
That's not.

652
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:17.670
Or today you find somebody very honest in the West is very common.

653
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.060
I see,

654
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:19.109
very,

655
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:20.040
very common.

656
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.180
You trust somebody who is an honest man,

657
00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:23.819
make him a,

658
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:24.609
say,

659
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:25.780
an accountant.

660
00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:29.349
Next time you find you're decamped with money.

661
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:32.530
If somebody's honest in India,

662
00:33:32.609 --> 00:33:34.209
then he's honest all his life.

663
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.219
If he's honourable,

664
00:33:35.329 --> 00:33:36.839
he's honourable all his life.

665
00:33:36.969 --> 00:33:38.719
Then he doesn't change like this.

666
00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.109
What is the reason?

667
00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:46.069
There is no debt

668
00:33:47.099 --> 00:33:48.739
So when you get realisation,

669
00:33:48.910 --> 00:33:51.989
you just don't touch your depth to live superficial.

670
00:33:53.869 --> 00:33:53.880
So

671
00:33:54.439 --> 00:33:56.689
now we have to forget from where we have come.

672
00:33:56.939 --> 00:33:58.739
We have to know where we have reached.

673
00:33:59.869 --> 00:34:01.219
We have become the spirit now.

674
00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:02.310
Forget your past,

675
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.699
forget the style you have let,

676
00:34:04.229 --> 00:34:05.180
forget everything.

677
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:06.180
Humble down.

678
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.228
Humbling down is important.

679
00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:10.139
Humble down in your hearts.

680
00:34:15.819 --> 00:34:16.728
If we have to grow,

681
00:34:16.779 --> 00:34:17.509
we have to go deep.

682
00:34:21.879 --> 00:34:23.469
Only through humility

683
00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:24.958
through the weight.

684
00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:27.620
Through the weight of humility.

685
00:34:30.399 --> 00:34:31.679
Not condemning yourself.

686
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.000
Not saying that you are wrong,

687
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.750
your forefathers were wrong nothing,

688
00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:37.040
just stumbled off.

689
00:34:39.148 --> 00:34:40.898
And grow inward.

690
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:43.260
We

691
00:34:43.438 --> 00:34:45.500
must know our weaknesses.

692
00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.949
This is the biggest problem in the West.

693
00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.840
We never want to see our own weakness.

694
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.370
And the other weakness is

695
00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:57.449
in the best is,

696
00:34:57.459 --> 00:34:59.899
it's now it's very complicated society.

697
00:35:00.969 --> 00:35:02.179
Like supposing

698
00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.340
I want to say

699
00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:09.979
that see your son is like this.

700
00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:15.850
Then they don't mind taking the blame of the son's misbehaviour upon themselves,

701
00:35:15.969 --> 00:35:17.770
though it may be I have done it.

702
00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.560
So that it never reaches the site.

703
00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:25.139
But if I say you have done something,

704
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:26.429
they'll say no,

705
00:35:26.669 --> 00:35:29.939
perhaps maybe my mother because she treated me

706
00:35:30.189 --> 00:35:31.070
psychologically,

707
00:35:31.189 --> 00:35:32.429
something happening to me,

708
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.110
so it has happened.

709
00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:39.340
Because I was born in a family which was very strict,

710
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:40.870
I had a broken home.

711
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.739
That's why it does happen

712
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:48.120
A thing of the

713
00:35:49.159 --> 00:35:50.090
You are a spirit.

714
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:53.679
All these explanations

715
00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:54.600
are

716
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:55.949
against you,

717
00:35:55.959 --> 00:35:57.120
are going against us.

718
00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.699
You are cheating yourself.

719
00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.840
Because I come from such and such place,

720
00:36:05.929 --> 00:36:06.969
it has happened now.

721
00:36:08.889 --> 00:36:11.719
I'll give you an example of you imagine who you know very well.

722
00:36:13.239 --> 00:36:13.979
You know,

723
00:36:14.459 --> 00:36:15.449
when he came,

724
00:36:15.669 --> 00:36:16.379
actually

725
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:17.750
when Indians come here,

726
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:20.709
they also develop some sometimes this ego part.

727
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:23.729
He came to France for my.

728
00:36:25.989 --> 00:36:26.629
I,

729
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.199
to,

730
00:36:27.429 --> 00:36:28.629
to so many people,

731
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:30.689
Yogi is like a sort of a guru.

732
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:34.620
He has a beard and he has a moustache like that.

733
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:35.139
It's.

734
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.750
And sometimes he has a big ego,

735
00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.010
but more than him,

736
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.139
his disciples have a greater eotic.

737
00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.840
And those people who work here with him also get into such big big ego trips that we

738
00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:49.840
are having

739
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:51.260
a horrible time.

740
00:36:51.939 --> 00:36:53.790
I sent one of them to a

741
00:36:54.889 --> 00:36:55.399
To

742
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:56.219
Australia.

743
00:36:57.189 --> 00:36:58.459
Had to take up a job.

744
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:01.379
So he would not take up any job.

745
00:37:01.939 --> 00:37:02.100
People said,

746
00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:02.790
what is it?

747
00:37:02.909 --> 00:37:04.780
I was chief executive

748
00:37:05.229 --> 00:37:05.780
of

749
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.659
Margins Export

750
00:37:09.189 --> 00:37:09.800
Company.

751
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.350
What was he exporting?

752
00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:13.709
Those

753
00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:14.919
lay backs.

754
00:37:16.159 --> 00:37:16.649
Vomiting.

755
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:18.939
He was the chief executive.

756
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.090
And now he can't take up any other job but the chief executive.

757
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:28.560
And nobody is exporting clay packs from Australia,

758
00:37:29.239 --> 00:37:30.489
so he's without a job.

759
00:37:32.699 --> 00:37:32.709
Yeah.

760
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:37.939
So he's without a job.

761
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:39.010
I told him,

762
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.610
you better dig some.

763
00:37:43.219 --> 00:37:43.229
Yeah.

764
00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:45.959
And we'll export it.

765
00:37:46.129 --> 00:37:46.340
First,

766
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:47.120
do the digging.

767
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:50.030
Then we'll export it to me.

768
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.489
So all.

769
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.100
This kind of a nonsense comes.

770
00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:03.020
Indians,

771
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.290
though,

772
00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:03.629
I mean,

773
00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:06.139
MSSCP is occupying such a big position.

774
00:38:06.189 --> 00:38:06.379
I mean,

775
00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:08.179
if you see him where he is,

776
00:38:08.229 --> 00:38:08.540
but

777
00:38:09.149 --> 00:38:09.820
whatever it is,

778
00:38:09.909 --> 00:38:10.370
but

779
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:11.260
he's

780
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.760
much more humble

781
00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:14.790
than many of the surgeons.

782
00:38:15.899 --> 00:38:18.419
Though sometimes he also goes off because you see

783
00:38:18.419 --> 00:38:21.209
in this country you pump up the people so much

784
00:38:21.419 --> 00:38:22.189
that maybe.

785
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:24.370
Sometimes,

786
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:27.659
but he sees it now,

787
00:38:27.669 --> 00:38:27.729
now

788
00:38:27.909 --> 00:38:31.739
he sees it and he was telling me it's the best way to get out of it.

789
00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.409
is to see

790
00:38:34.429 --> 00:38:35.530
He sees it

791
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:37.909
and every time he does something he always

792
00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:39.469
asks for forgiveness,

793
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.629
as always.

794
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.830
You asked for for for forgiveness from me.

795
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.530
But he told me this country so that where you get blown up.

796
00:38:52.399 --> 00:38:54.189
People would pumper you so much.

797
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:56.729
Because you have a position.

798
00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:57.820
Yes,

799
00:38:57.909 --> 00:38:58.070
sir,

800
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.500
sir,

801
00:38:58.830 --> 00:38:59.129
sir,

802
00:38:59.389 --> 00:38:59.669
sir,

803
00:38:59.969 --> 00:39:00.270
sir,

804
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.750
sir.

805
00:39:03.649 --> 00:39:06.840
But even those who are garbage cleaners have the same issue.

806
00:39:07.969 --> 00:39:08.989
Even worse than C,

807
00:39:09.189 --> 00:39:09.800
much worse.

808
00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:17.250
So what is the reason?

809
00:39:18.629 --> 00:39:19.989
Why this bumptiousness,

810
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.229
why this wrong ideas about yourself?

811
00:39:23.879 --> 00:39:25.429
It is because

812
00:39:26.179 --> 00:39:28.489
we are not one with reality,

813
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.250
and we have no joy.

814
00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:32.739
We cannot grow artificial.

815
00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:41.959
So if you can some or others see that horrible thing called ego.

816
00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:45.860
And watch it nicely.

817
00:39:48.189 --> 00:39:49.510
First thing that should happen,

818
00:39:49.629 --> 00:39:51.750
I would say an example of that if you don't mind,

819
00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:52.629
I'll say more.

820
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:57.000
He had a tremendous.

821
00:39:59.719 --> 00:40:01.090
Evo is to power 100.

822
00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:02.830
108

823
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.300
When he first came to be.

824
00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:13.149
But I knew one thing about this man that he loves truth.

825
00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.929
This is the part there where I found his debt.

826
00:40:21.959 --> 00:40:22.699
Lee love

827
00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:25.479
There were up to hit him.

828
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:30.080
I see now today what a product.

829
00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.870
What have you achieved in Sergio?

830
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:38.340
I mean,

831
00:40:38.379 --> 00:40:39.699
he met me only 4 years back.

832
00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.540
Can you believe it?

833
00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:47.570
The first time when he came.

834
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.810
He was

835
00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.649
roaring like a liar.

836
00:40:54.489 --> 00:40:55.300
I mean

837
00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.600
everything was there.

838
00:40:58.629 --> 00:41:00.709
Everything fizzled out gradually.

839
00:41:04.159 --> 00:41:05.780
He was so angry with me,

840
00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.270
shouting at the top of his voice,

841
00:41:09.209 --> 00:41:11.290
doing all sorts of nonsensical things.

842
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.090
Can you believe Warren was shouting at me?

843
00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:15.909
Can you believe?

844
00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:21.139
But I could see that in him that he loved.

845
00:41:22.629 --> 00:41:24.399
I go up to a point.

846
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:27.449
If I don't see you coming out of that ego,

847
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:29.899
you will have to get out of.

848
00:41:33.739 --> 00:41:36.459
All that you have enjoyed in Sir Joga you'll have to give up.

849
00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.929
I tell you that today.

850
00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.229
You'd better learn this lesson.

851
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:52.739
When you come to India.

852
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.179
Came through,

853
00:41:55.229 --> 00:41:55.750
no doubt.

854
00:41:56.919 --> 00:41:58.540
Then we'll be having ashrams

855
00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.340
where you can come and stay and see for yourself,

856
00:42:01.439 --> 00:42:02.260
double up your time.

857
00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.409
But we cannot have burdensome people.

858
00:42:07.409 --> 00:42:10.399
Who pulled down other erogiserogins

859
00:42:11.209 --> 00:42:13.600
tried to bring problem for collectivity.

860
00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.250
We cannot afford it.

861
00:42:18.389 --> 00:42:19.469
Like a boat

862
00:42:21.169 --> 00:42:22.879
We have to cross over.

863
00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:24.560
All of us are in the boat,

864
00:42:24.639 --> 00:42:26.590
and some are Jonahs.

865
00:42:26.709 --> 00:42:28.020
They should be thrown out.

866
00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:32.810
Should we make the boat sink for them?

867
00:42:36.179 --> 00:42:38.850
So no liabilities will be accepted in surgery,

868
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.090
I promise you.

869
00:42:43.229 --> 00:42:45.469
Since I've come here I've been sick.

870
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:52.689
Humble

871
00:42:57.719 --> 00:42:58.149
Humble

872
00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:02.100
In humility.

873
00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:04.909
In righteousness

874
00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:08.469
You will find your own glory,

875
00:43:08.879 --> 00:43:09.879
the light of you.

876
00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:12.739
Not in.

877
00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:14.840
In ego you're blind.

878
00:43:14.969 --> 00:43:15.879
You can't see it.

879
00:43:17.919 --> 00:43:19.320
Only in humility.

880
00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.540
In that silence of humility

881
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:25.979
you'll find your own glory,

882
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:27.820
your own dignity,

883
00:43:28.429 --> 00:43:30.550
everything you'll find in humility.

884
00:43:32.439 --> 00:43:34.250
But not by condemning yourself.

885
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.280
But in humility.

886
00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:46.229
That's the time really you help yourself and love yourself when you are humble.

887
00:43:55.399 --> 00:43:56.649
So it is said,

888
00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.570
humble down in your heart.

889
00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:02.620
Said that

890
00:44:03.439 --> 00:44:06.649
I've got the picture of my mother in my heart.

891
00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.780
I have to just bend my head and I see it there.

892
00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.500
Just to bend my head

893
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:18.679
and I see my mother's picture.

894
00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:30.909
What

895
00:44:32.429 --> 00:44:33.370
But keep it up

896
00:44:33.969 --> 00:44:34.639
The thing is,

897
00:44:34.679 --> 00:44:37.239
you cannot keep this tempo of humility.

898
00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:40.959
You have to keep it up.

899
00:44:41.129 --> 00:44:42.360
I come here all right.

900
00:44:42.409 --> 00:44:43.320
Everything is fine,

901
00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:43.620
good.

902
00:44:44.719 --> 00:44:46.139
Again I come back.

903
00:44:46.469 --> 00:44:49.580
I must be prepared to suffer for 2 or 3 days again.

904
00:44:49.709 --> 00:44:50.780
Then you're all right,

905
00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:53.909
but this is only working through me.

906
00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:56.510
To my efforts.

907
00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.429
What about you

908
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.090
yourself Aita?

909
00:45:06.419 --> 00:45:07.370
I tell you

910
00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.600
You don't have to exert at all.

911
00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:12.169
To be helped.

912
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:18.239
But there's one way you can do it.

913
00:45:18.389 --> 00:45:19.350
Always tell yourself.

914
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:20.300
So for example,

915
00:45:20.469 --> 00:45:20.790
now.

916
00:45:22.729 --> 00:45:23.909
We have Michael here.

917
00:45:26.159 --> 00:45:27.330
And say

918
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:29.510
He said from

919
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:30.459
America.

920
00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:31.580
I said,

921
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:31.879
you,

922
00:45:31.909 --> 00:45:32.300
Mr.

923
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:32.879
American.

924
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.149
Will you behave yourself?

925
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:36.030
Address yourself.

926
00:45:38.379 --> 00:45:39.989
You Michael American,

927
00:45:40.229 --> 00:45:42.030
will you behave yourself.

928
00:45:44.439 --> 00:45:46.979
And come down to reality now.

929
00:45:48.899 --> 00:45:49.719
Do you know

930
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.020
you are the spirit.

931
00:45:51.679 --> 00:45:52.500
Address yourself.

932
00:45:58.409 --> 00:46:00.320
Address yourself like that,

933
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.479
stand before the mirror.

934
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:03.699
Separate yourself,

935
00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.540
say that is your ego,

936
00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:06.590
and you are the spirit.

937
00:46:07.399 --> 00:46:08.110
I talked to.

938
00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.000
You don't exist.

939
00:46:13.649 --> 00:46:14.820
Do you know what you are?

940
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:17.189
You're not.

941
00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.179
If there is light

942
00:46:21.989 --> 00:46:23.139
In front of me

943
00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:26.699
there will be no reflection us.

944
00:46:28.689 --> 00:46:29.840
You are like my shadow.

945
00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:35.919
Go

946
00:46:40.590 --> 00:46:42.570
Because I'm standing before a mirror,

947
00:46:42.709 --> 00:46:44.459
you exist otherwise don't exist

948
00:46:45.179 --> 00:46:45.189
anymore.

949
00:46:52.389 --> 00:46:55.250
And I can create infinite number like you.

950
00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:56.429
How,

951
00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:58.340
put another mirror behind.

952
00:47:01.889 --> 00:47:03.989
And there will be infinite.

953
00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.449
Images these artificial ones I can create in 1 2nd.

954
00:47:10.709 --> 00:47:12.149
But you can't create me.

955
00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:14.879
You cannot influence me.

956
00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:17.929
You cannot bring me down.

957
00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:18.820
I'm the spirit.

958
00:47:29.209 --> 00:47:31.949
Has to be taken up otherwise I tell you.

959
00:47:33.159 --> 00:47:35.969
Some of you will start looking like orange z or.

960
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:39.399
Genghis Khan.

961
00:47:40.459 --> 00:47:41.379
For Hitler.

962
00:47:44.379 --> 00:47:45.639
Or something like that,

963
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:45.969
see,

964
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.409
all these,

965
00:47:46.969 --> 00:47:48.070
you suddenly I find among suchies

966
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.199
some Hitler standing with the moustache

967
00:47:53.649 --> 00:47:54.959
and the hair like that,

968
00:47:55.649 --> 00:47:56.840
the nose like that.

969
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:00.620
But suddenly I find someone like that.

970
00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:02.379
It's quite possible.

971
00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:03.979
I mean

972
00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.379
what I have seen of Sergio guy in the west,

973
00:48:06.709 --> 00:48:08.020
I'm surprised to see.

974
00:48:09.209 --> 00:48:11.300
You leave somebody as a little sparrow,

975
00:48:11.409 --> 00:48:12.250
and when you come back,

976
00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.290
you find a hawk.

977
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.939
That the same person.

978
00:48:17.159 --> 00:48:17.600
Yes,

979
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.010
now she's become aha.

980
00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.129
Only possible

981
00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:25.290
in the west,

982
00:48:25.459 --> 00:48:26.260
I can tell you.

983
00:48:27.159 --> 00:48:28.639
If you tell somebody in India,

984
00:48:28.719 --> 00:48:29.639
they will not believe.

985
00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:34.050
Like Mister Jekyll and Mister Hyde,

986
00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:35.199
only possible

987
00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:36.439
in the West.

988
00:48:36.729 --> 00:48:37.729
When I read this story,

989
00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:38.090
I said,

990
00:48:38.169 --> 00:48:39.280
how can it be possible.

991
00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.189
Doctor Jekyll and Mr.

992
00:48:43.199 --> 00:48:43.489
Hyde,

993
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:43.770
I said,

994
00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:44.879
how can it be possible?

995
00:48:46.229 --> 00:48:47.159
But I've seen it.

996
00:48:47.979 --> 00:48:49.020
It happens here

997
00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:50.949
They,

998
00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:52.090
when they are good,

999
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:52.800
they're very,

1000
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:53.600
very good,

1001
00:48:54.209 --> 00:48:55.560
and when they're bad,

1002
00:48:55.689 --> 00:48:56.540
they're horrid.

1003
00:48:59.379 --> 00:49:00.739
But that's only in the West.

1004
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:02.330
You don't find this

1005
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:03.489
in India.

1006
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.030
Why?

1007
00:49:04.739 --> 00:49:06.469
The reason is we are deep.

1008
00:49:07.489 --> 00:49:09.290
Into ourselves really deep.

1009
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:11.590
All right,

1010
00:49:11.669 --> 00:49:13.110
you have not missed anything now.

1011
00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.389
Because you got your realisation as they've got it,

1012
00:49:16.399 --> 00:49:18.600
you've got the knowledge of surgery as they've got it.

1013
00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:21.050
But test it upon yourself.

1014
00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.399
And humble down yourself.

1015
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:26.520
Go down into yourself

1016
00:49:26.889 --> 00:49:28.530
facing yourself.

1017
00:49:29.129 --> 00:49:29.580
Just

1018
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:30.649
telling yourself,

1019
00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:30.959
no,

1020
00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:33.409
I have to agree deeper and deeper.

1021
00:49:33.449 --> 00:49:35.449
I'm not going to listen to anything.

1022
00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:37.669
Ego and all that nonsense.

1023
00:49:37.729 --> 00:49:38.560
I'm not going to listen.

1024
00:49:38.649 --> 00:49:39.959
I'm going to go deeper into.

1025
00:49:40.929 --> 00:49:42.830
And move into yourself,

1026
00:49:43.679 --> 00:49:44.790
ed yourself

1027
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.120
into reality.

1028
00:49:47.159 --> 00:49:50.919
Piercing through all these ego or nonsensical ideas that come.

1029
00:49:52.679 --> 00:49:53.939
Then only you can correct it,

1030
00:49:53.949 --> 00:49:54.760
otherwise you can.

1031
00:49:57.899 --> 00:50:01.300
The best way in meditation I've seen to improve your ego

1032
00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:03.060
is to meditate on my feet.

1033
00:50:12.919 --> 00:50:13.750
My feet

1034
00:50:14.629 --> 00:50:15.909
Have that magic.

1035
00:50:17.949 --> 00:50:19.659
Have you got photographs of my feet?

1036
00:50:21.149 --> 00:50:22.719
I don't find anything here.

1037
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:26.020
Yeah,

1038
00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:27.790
we just bring one,

1039
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:28.719
just bring one.

1040
00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:35.580
All right,

1041
00:50:36.229 --> 00:50:36.629
watch that.

1042
00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.290
They're very small one this one this is this is not this kind,

1043
00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:01.080
one.

1044
00:51:04.219 --> 00:51:04.929
Ah,

1045
00:51:05.379 --> 00:51:05.810
see.

1046
00:51:18.149 --> 00:51:18.419
A place.

1047
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:21.350
So

1048
00:51:27.179 --> 00:51:27.919
Ah,

1049
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:28.860
that's it.

1050
00:51:32.709 --> 00:51:34.760
They are reflecting too much though the light,

1051
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:35.050
huh.

1052
00:51:35.979 --> 00:51:37.179
Can we take out this?

1053
00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:55.300
Yet lots of these small kinds they have.

1054
00:51:57.850 --> 00:51:58.290
Change

1055
00:52:06.739 --> 00:52:07.389
Later

1056
00:52:27.959 --> 00:52:27.969
Mm.

1057
00:52:29.939 --> 00:52:31.570
Now the 2nd group can come in.

1058
00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:34.040
Are you all right now?

1059
00:52:34.129 --> 00:52:34.530
Better.

1060
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.010
Still there.

1061
00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:39.120
Beat yourself with shoes.

1062
00:52:39.199 --> 00:52:40.040
I tell you,

1063
00:52:40.479 --> 00:52:41.959
beat yourself with shoes.

1064
00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.000
That's the best way,

1065
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:44.590
go and beat yourself with shoes,

1066
00:52:45.159 --> 00:52:45.870
all of you.

1067
00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:46.790
Now those

1068
00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:47.459
come and

1069
00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:48.629
just.

1070
00:52:51.850 --> 00:52:51.860
P

1071
00:52:54.909 --> 00:52:56.149
Very simple feat.

1072
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.989
All the people at the back come right in.

1073
00:53:21.439 --> 00:53:23.120
Get some Puja ones also,

1074
00:53:25.879 --> 00:53:25.889
yeah.

1075
00:54:39.689 --> 00:54:40.889
No need to rub my feet.

1076
00:54:40.929 --> 00:54:42.209
You can just wash them.

1077
00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:50.370
Mm.

1078
00:54:53.959 --> 00:54:55.159
Can you feel the vibration?

1079
00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:56.570
Right

1080
00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:07.699
Well,

1081
00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.219
let's have the 2nd group coming down.

1082
00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:25.139
Please move out

1083
00:55:27.709 --> 00:55:28.840
Have you got kumkum here?

1084
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:30.399
Bring it.

1085
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:33.709
Those who have not rubbed my feet can rub with the kumum with who died.

1086
00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.520
Those who have not rubbed my feet

1087
00:55:37.889 --> 00:55:39.199
so far should wait,

1088
00:55:39.810 --> 00:55:40.120
and,

1089
00:55:40.129 --> 00:55:40.639
uh,

1090
00:55:40.850 --> 00:55:44.860
others can meditate a little bit on the feet.

1091
00:55:55.989 --> 00:55:56.800
God bless her.

1092
00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:31.379
You.

1093
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:44.689
Ah,

1094
00:56:44.699 --> 00:56:44.719
but he.

1095
00:56:55.479 --> 00:56:57.479
Can you feel the vibrations now the cool breeze.

1096
00:57:04.739 --> 00:57:05.760
Put it in a

1097
00:57:07.219 --> 00:57:07.250
a or something.

1098
00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:08.080
Put it in a mixer.

1099
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:09.590
hm,

1100
00:57:09.649 --> 00:57:10.149
now,

1101
00:57:10.629 --> 00:57:11.320
all right,

1102
00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:12.570
good.

1103
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.189
Chris,

1104
00:57:15.389 --> 00:57:16.000
how are you?

1105
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.879
Better

1106
00:57:21.669 --> 00:57:23.370
Now those who want to come further,

1107
00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:23.989
come up.

1108
00:57:25.479 --> 00:57:26.800
Allow some others to come for.

1109
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:46.260
It's.

1110
00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:55.949
or just what.

1111
00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:18.050
Are you better now.

1112
00:58:20.649 --> 00:58:21.080
that.

1113
00:58:26.469 --> 00:58:26.479
So.

1114
00:58:27.639 --> 00:58:27.810
No,

1115
00:58:27.929 --> 00:58:28.449
just try,

1116
00:58:28.889 --> 00:58:29.379
just

1117
00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:30.060
try,

1118
00:58:30.159 --> 00:58:30.360
yeah.

1119
00:58:45.179 --> 00:58:46.370
Did you use the ice?

1120
00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:48.270
It helped you

1121
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:54.120
It's right-sided probably.

1122
00:58:57.129 --> 00:58:58.580
Stomach or you did it

1123
00:58:59.169 --> 00:58:59.840
on the liver.

1124
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520
Hm.

1125
00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.820
That also helps

1126
00:59:06.629 --> 00:59:07.330
Released

1127
00:59:10.969 --> 00:59:12.290
My breathing is all right.

1128
00:59:19.610 --> 00:59:20.010
Regina,

1129
00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:20.679
you sit here.

1130
00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:24.419
Don't close your eyes.

1131
01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:16.439
Hello,

1132
01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:17.179
for me.

1133
01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.760
This is in me.

1134
01:00:37.709 --> 01:00:37.719
Mm

1135
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:46.649
No

1136
01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:57.510
Um,

1137
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.540
feet,

1138
01:00:58.620 --> 01:00:58.969
feet.

1139
01:00:59.820 --> 01:00:59.899
But

1140
01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.810
You cannot think about them.

1141
01:01:12.889 --> 01:01:13.929
You just have to see it.

1142
01:01:33.570 --> 01:01:34.020
Oh,

1143
01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:56.330
Hm.

1144
01:02:04.919 --> 01:02:05.080

You can rub it on your head.

1335
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:47.830

1386
01:18:51.209 --> 01:18:54.049

I mean he's seen everything.

1388
01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.720
Is there any particular person whom you want to marry?

1389
01:19:04.939 --> 01:19:05.600
Yes,

1390
01:19:05.609 --> 01:19:05.620

But where is he?

1397
01:19:41.250 --> 01:19:42.259
Where is he going?

1398
01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:43.359

01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.729

1402
01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:47.799
He could get here.

1403
01:19:52.509 --> 01:19:54.330
And ready to meet that girl.

1404
01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:55.939
Gale

1405
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:58.870
Where did you meet her?

1406
01:20:00.509 --> 01:20:01.310
Where did you

1407
01:20:05.859 --> 01:20:06.899

1408
01:20:08.799 --> 01:20:09.100
Oh,

1409
01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:09.930
that's great.

1410
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:12.020
All right,

1411
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:13.709
that's very beautiful.

1412
01:20:16.810 --> 01:20:19.189
So it's so this one is so this one's on.

1413
01:20:28.649 --> 01:20:29.270
This is him,

1414
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.899
Phil,

1415
01:20:30.069 --> 01:20:30.939
this is Phil.

1416
01:20:31.629 --> 01:20:32.700
He couldn't get a photograph,

1417
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:34.509
but seeing as his uh wife's

1418
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:35.299
uh

1419
01:20:35.509 --> 01:20:35.910
here.

1420
01:20:38.169 --> 01:20:39.680
She has a photograph of herself.

1421
01:20:40.459 --> 01:20:40.470
Ah,

1422
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:42.770

1423
01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.200
Director

1424
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:57.620
Of Broadway studios New York.

1425
01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:03.939
It make they make films.

1426
01:21:06.799 --> 01:21:06.830
the director.

1427
01:21:08.569 --> 01:21:09.240
Oh,

1428
01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:10.279
that's good.

1429
01:21:10.609 --> 01:21:12.490
Now we should make one film of Seekers,

1430
01:21:12.569 --> 01:21:13.060
all right.

1431
01:21:16.259 --> 01:21:16.509
You

1432
01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.740
His desire to humility it's wonderful.

1433
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:24.899
Now see your vibrations,

1434
01:21:24.990 --> 01:21:25.899
both of you.

1435
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:27.259
First of all,

1436
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.859
beautiful.

1437
01:21:42.069 --> 01:21:42.990
May God bless you.

1438
01:21:45.069 --> 01:21:46.450
You should put one more point.

1439
01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:47.740
Have you been to any guru?

1440
01:21:47.859 --> 01:21:48.450
That's important.

1441
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:49.580
We have that on this form.

1442
01:21:52.259 --> 01:21:52.600
Now,

1443
01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:53.359

1444
01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.009

01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:07.640
How are you?

1448
01:22:11.629 --> 01:22:11.640
Uh

1449
01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:19.609
Uh,

1450
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:21.149

1451
01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:21.790
I do.

1452
01:22:26.459 --> 01:22:27.709
I'll put it on your head.

1453
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:29.910
It would be good for us.

1454
01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:40.950
All right,

1455
01:22:41.399 --> 01:22:42.200
that's fine,

1456
01:22:42.439 --> 01:22:43.149
excellent.

1457
01:22:46.490 --> 01:22:46.729
Oh man.

1458
01:22:51.379 --> 01:22:52.229
Richard

1459
01:22:52.939 --> 01:22:53.750

1460
01:22:56.970 --> 01:22:57.899
37

1461
01:23:13.100 --> 01:23:14.430
Are you still nursing,

1462
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:16.049
Richard Richard?

1463
01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:23.279
Are you still nursing?

1464
01:23:23.450 --> 01:23:23.529
Yes,

1465
01:23:23.649 --> 01:23:23.810
I,

1466
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:25.399
I do it part time.

1467
01:23:42.959 --> 01:23:44.700
In that you would like to marry?

1468
01:23:45.149 --> 01:23:45.520
Yes ma'am.

1469
01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:47.509
That's good.

1470
01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:50.589
Mm

1471
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:05.100
Great

1472
01:24:05.979 --> 01:24:07.029
Yes we have

1473
01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.129
Is he here,

1474
01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:13.470
Edward.

1475
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:18.970
Canadian

1476
01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:20.959
I

1477
01:24:22.919 --> 01:24:26.069
Some people couldn't come through much as you lack of space

1478
01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:28.709
in that sense.

1479
01:24:29.620 --> 01:24:31.060
He's so tall as 6 ft.

1480
01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:33.669
Oh,

1481
01:25:22.729 --> 01:25:24.299
What's the meaning of tardy.

1482
01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:27.089
late

1483
01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:29.799
A person who's always late,

1484
01:25:30.569 --> 01:25:31.209
like me.

1485
01:25:33.589 --> 01:25:36.419
You have a different way of doing it a different purpose.

1486
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:38.379
Distracted

1487
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:40.189
Often distracted,

1488
01:25:40.299 --> 01:25:41.310
that attention is

1489
01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:42.359
easily

1490
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.479
taken away from.

1491
01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.000
Daydreaming.

1492
01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:52.759
It's.

1493
01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:54.569
Is he?

1494
01:25:56.569 --> 01:25:57.319
He's improved.

1495
01:25:59.529 --> 01:26:00.560
Laurie Hynes,

1496
01:26:00.569 --> 01:26:01.000
uh,

1497
01:26:01.009 --> 01:26:01.600
person,

1498
01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:03.839
he's in the ashram there in,

1499
01:26:03.959 --> 01:26:05.620
in Vancouver,

1500
01:26:05.770 --> 01:26:07.290
but he's had an up and down history.

1501
01:26:08.350 --> 01:26:09.950
So we'll find it somebody.

1502
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:12.279
It's very good.

1503
01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:20.080
Godfrey in San Diego.

1504
01:26:55.459 --> 01:26:55.680
point

1505
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.049
She has children.

1506
01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:26.399
Uh,

1507
01:27:26.459 --> 01:27:26.649
yes,

1508
01:27:26.740 --> 01:27:26.810
ma'am.

1509
01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:30.060
Is he here?

1510
01:27:30.450 --> 01:27:30.640
No.

1511
01:27:31.930 --> 01:27:34.109
Again another case of vaccine.

1512
01:27:35.229 --> 01:27:36.279
They uh

1513
01:27:38.370 --> 01:27:40.080
With saving to go to India.

1514
01:27:40.939 --> 01:27:40.950
Mm

1515
01:27:42.689 --> 01:27:46.560
And I think the difference between flying here and there may make.

1516
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:51.939
may make the difference whether you can go to India.

1517
01:27:52.979 --> 01:27:53.859
So

1518
01:27:54.319 --> 01:27:55.490
they didn't know you were

1519
01:27:55.779 --> 01:27:56.500
gonna be here,

1520
01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:56.910
mother.

1521
01:27:57.799 --> 01:27:58.979
At first it was Warren and they,

1522
01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:01.490
Warren was gonna go to their San Diego.

1523
01:28:09.899 --> 01:28:10.439
Christine.

1524
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.939
We have done

1525
01:28:24.140 --> 01:28:25.229
Janet Bows.

1526
01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:26.339
Ja

1527
01:28:28.750 --> 01:28:29.240
Jeannette.

1528
01:28:30.939 --> 01:28:31.129
the

1529
01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:33.189
Oh good.

1530
01:28:34.279 --> 01:28:34.290
Hm.

1531
01:28:45.459 --> 01:28:47.009
They're all filmmakers here.

1532
01:28:48.250 --> 01:28:49.439
She she brought them,

1533
01:28:49.569 --> 01:28:49.660
uh,

1534
01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:52.089
Phil and Christine and all these other filmmakers

1535
01:28:52.089 --> 01:28:53.810
from the department where she works for.

1536
01:28:54.330 --> 01:28:56.890
Now what's that.

1537
01:29:20.370 --> 01:29:20.729
Christine,

1538
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:21.069
could you

1539
01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:23.589
Good

1540
01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.200
gone to sleep.

1541
01:29:30.959 --> 01:29:31.979
Left sided feet.

1542
01:29:35.419 --> 01:29:35.660
Yes,

1543
01:29:35.939 --> 01:29:36.870
a very good person extremely.

1544
01:29:41.799 --> 01:29:43.120
30 years of age.

1545
01:29:55.399 --> 01:29:56.759
For some streets.

1546
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:00.930
Elizabeth

1547
01:30:02.339 --> 01:30:03.020
And she's she said,

1548
01:30:04.879 --> 01:30:05.040
yes,

1549
01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:05.830
I met her.

1550
01:30:06.439 --> 01:30:07.830
I know I don't her.

1551
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:17.709
She has children.

1552
01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:19.270
Uh,

1553
01:30:19.379 --> 01:30:19.500
no,

1554
01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:19.819
mother,

1555
01:30:20.009 --> 01:30:21.029
she's never been married.

1556
01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:36.310
I

1557
01:30:37.839 --> 01:30:37.850
Hm.

1558
01:30:41.509 --> 01:30:42.009
Caroline,

1559
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:43.109
I would like to marry.

1560
01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.009
Did you hear that?

1561
01:30:57.319 --> 01:30:57.640
I said,

1562
01:30:57.729 --> 01:30:59.319
I would like to marry you now.

1563
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:02.220
Myself.

1564
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:11.359
We are so good.

1565
01:31:19.649 --> 01:31:19.660
Ah,

1566
01:31:21.439 --> 01:31:22.549
that's so good.

1567
01:31:59.569 --> 01:32:00.229
divorced

1568
01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:04.279
To

1569
01:32:06.009 --> 01:32:07.839
You divorced and he divorced.

1570
01:32:13.479 --> 01:32:14.370
Is he married?

1571
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:15.209
huh?

1572
01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:17.120
Mm,

1573
01:32:17.359 --> 01:32:17.629
does he?

1574
01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:18.870
Not bad.

1575
01:32:20.439 --> 01:32:22.109
I don't want to give you another chance.

1576
01:32:29.819 --> 01:32:30.799
How do you find him?

1577
01:32:32.569 --> 01:32:32.580
Be

1578
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:38.120
Why not try Sergio.

1579
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:41.009
Mm.

1580
01:32:43.419 --> 01:32:47.770
Better try because I am saying your children must be missing the father.

1581
01:32:48.589 --> 01:32:48.839
Oh,

1582
01:32:48.879 --> 01:32:49.370
they have their they have grown up,

1583
01:32:50.100 --> 01:32:51.979
huh.

1584
01:32:54.729 --> 01:32:58.890
25 and 23 years old in professions of their own.

1585
01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:03.589
They're all working professionally in fields,

1586
01:33:03.850 --> 01:33:04.609
economics.

1587
01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:06.879
Father.

1588
01:33:11.879 --> 01:33:13.390
Why not try him again,

1589
01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:14.560
all right?

1590
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:17.029
I have a feeling

1591
01:33:17.259 --> 01:33:18.410
he's a good man.

1592
01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:26.370
He may come to search you.

1593
01:33:28.290 --> 01:33:28.310
All right,

1594
01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:31.160
that would be a unique thing.

1595
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:35.680
You know my ego

1596
01:33:37.919 --> 01:33:38.040
No,

1597
01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.140
it's not that.

1598
01:33:42.339 --> 01:33:42.890
I think

1599
01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:45.500
Now you are very.

1600
01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:48.069
Right,

1601
01:33:49.529 --> 01:33:50.009
try.

1602
01:33:52.509 --> 01:33:52.520
So

1603
01:33:54.330 --> 01:33:55.560
That would be the best.

1604
01:33:56.850 --> 01:33:58.200
I'll be very happy

1605
01:33:58.609 --> 01:33:59.319
because it's,

1606
01:33:59.370 --> 01:34:00.729
it's a new precedent

1607
01:34:01.129 --> 01:34:02.049
for people

1608
01:34:02.569 --> 01:34:06.240
to show that those who are divorced again can remarry

1609
01:34:07.209 --> 01:34:08.200
because after

1610
01:34:08.890 --> 01:34:09.959
realisation,

1611
01:34:10.569 --> 01:34:12.770
a person gets completely transformed.

1612
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:17.479
I start seeing the beauty of another person with a different rank.

1613
01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:19.180
I

1614
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:22.799
And all the hurts and all those past things are.

1615
01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:32.149
Hm.

1616
01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:37.040
Lee.

1617
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.799
Yeah,

1618
01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:37.819
OK,

1619
01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:41.149
yeah.

1620
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.729
Yeah.
