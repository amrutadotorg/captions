1
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:10,983
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Krishna Puja.

2
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:22,733
We have to understand clearly that Shri Krishna

3
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:28,192
is a very, very important deity within us

4
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:33,108
because He is the Vishnu,

5
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:38,317
who resides in the Void,

6
00:00:40,484 --> 00:00:43,067
in the Nabhi.

7
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:50,858
He is the one who generates Dharma within us.

8
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:55,108
When you got your realization I didn’t tell you,

9
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:57,733
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

10
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:03,150
I never told you that “This is not good. That is not good.”

11
00:01:03,608 --> 00:01:05,650
You just did it

12
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:12,359
because Shri Vishnu was awakened within you.

13
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:15,525
He is in the Void

14
00:01:15,983 --> 00:01:20,067
and if He is awakened

15
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:28,192
He brings you to the light,

16
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:32,108
removes your ignorance, removes your darkness,

17
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,608
and you start seeing that

18
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,983
whatever you were doing was destructive for you,

19
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:47,192
and that’s how the dharma is established.

20
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:51,275
Of course, the Dharma was established also

21
00:01:51,733 --> 00:01:57,900
by all the ten Gurus who came on this earth,

22
00:01:58,234 --> 00:02:02,566
the prophets, who taught us about dharma.

23
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:16,733
So this combination of Shri Vishnu

24
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:20,525
and the ten Gurus

25
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:26,359
is to establish Dharma within us.

26
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:29,691
Now this Dharma is taught by prophets,

27
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,775
as you have seen everywhere.

28
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:35,566
They have said, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

29
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:38,359
They have talked of Ten Commandments.

30
00:02:38,733 --> 00:02:44,733
Every prophet has talked about Dharma, what is to be done,

31
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:49,566
up to a point when Christ also had to talk about it

32
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:54,108
and He says, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

33
00:02:54,525 --> 00:03:02,816
But Shri Krishna is the one

34
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:08,900
who says that “I come on this earth

35
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:19,359
when there is a glani, means demise, of Dharma.”

36
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:22,983
When the Dharma becomes weak

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,733
then He comes on this Earth,

38
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:28,942
and then He destroys the people

39
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,566
who are responsible

40
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:44,025
for bringing Dharma to this level of doom.

41
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:48,025
The second thing He says, that

42
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:53,650
“I protect the saints. I protect the saints

43
00:03:55,025 --> 00:04:02,858
and I kill all those who are devils or who are satanic,

44
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,858
who are destructive.”

45
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:06,900
These are His promises

46
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:11,775
which He gave long time back as Shri Krishna.

47
00:04:12,192 --> 00:04:16,983
As Vishnu we know Him only as the one

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,317
who is the giver of Dharma, mainly.

49
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:25,525
But all His potent qualities really were expressed

50
00:04:25,942 --> 00:04:28,025
when He came as Shri Krishna.

51
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:31,608
At the time of Shri Rama also these qualities

52
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:34,983
could not be expressed in that way.

53
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:40,275
So Shri Krishna’s first half of His life

54
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,025
He spent in Gokul and Vrindavan

55
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:51,150
where He showed His beautiful expression of His character,

56
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:55,608
as He made it,

57
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:59,275
what He calls as Leela, Leeladhara,

58
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:04,484
the one who said that you become a witness;

59
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:09,400
you witness the whole world like a drama,

60
00:05:09,775 --> 00:05:11,067
Sakshi Swarupa.

61
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:18,108
And then once you see the whole world as just

62
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:25,775
a child watches, in a child-like mirth and joy, you enjoy life.

63
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,525
That has happened to you people

64
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,983
that you have become like citizens of Vrindavan and Gokul,

65
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:35,067
the way you are enjoying yourself,

66
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:40,775
enjoying each other’s company, enjoying the bliss of God.

67
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:44,067
Then He showed also by killing Kaliya,

68
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:46,733
by killing Putana and other people,

69
00:05:47,192 --> 00:05:54,025
that if anybody tries to trouble such joyous children of God,

70
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,275
He is the one who will definitely protect

71
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:04,900
and kill all such evil forces which are troublesome.

72
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:10,234
But later on He becomes the king,

73
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,775
and when He becomes the king

74
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,524
He uses His powers in a different way.

75
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:22,942
First of all, if you see His own uncle, His own relation,

76
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:26,775
His own uncle, mother’s brother, was Kansa,

77
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:29,317
and was such a bad man.

78
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:33,983
So Shri Krishna didn’t spare him, He killed him.

79
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,608
He killed so many people.

80
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:40,733
Before becoming the king, He killed so many people.

81
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:48,484
Now what does that mean, that His own uncle He killed?

82
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:56,525
One quality that He has, which Christ had, we can say,

83
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:02,524
or so many saints had, is forgiveness.

84
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,733
He did not believe in forgiveness.

85
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:12,317
He’s the only one who said that, “I have to punish.”

86
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:16,025
We have to have somebody who should punish also.

87
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:18,150
If you are like Shiva,

88
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:21,359
then Shiva used to even love rakshasas

89
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:26,400
and in His innocence He used to give them also blessings.

90
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:33,400
But Shri Krishna did not believe in forgiveness at all

91
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:38,317
because it was important that there should be

92
00:07:38,608 --> 00:07:40,858
somebody with a very stern mind,

93
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:45,108
with such a stern understanding that a devil is a devil,

94
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:48,942
and devil must be killed.

95
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:54,900
He has done in His lifetime,

96
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,275
if you see, killing of so many people.

97
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:01,108
That doesn’t mean that we have right to kill anybody.

98
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:04,317
He was Shri Krishna; we are not.

99
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:08,816
We have to forgive because we are human beings.

100
00:08:09,234 --> 00:08:12,858
Once we forgive we transfer all our anger,

101
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:21,566
all our attitude of taking revenge, to Shri Krishna.

102
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,192
He takes over.

103
00:08:25,524 --> 00:08:28,484
Once you say that “I forgive,” then He takes over,

104
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,775
because He does not forgive.

105
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:37,025
He will immediately take over from you

106
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:41,484
and if it is justifiable, if it is necessary

107
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:47,525
He will punish the people who are torturing saints,

108
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,816
who are destroying the dharma.

109
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,442
Now it is very surprising

110
00:08:54,733 --> 00:08:58,484
that whatever is preached by the person,

111
00:08:58,858 --> 00:09:03,234
that area becomes just the opposite of it.

112
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,192
Is very surprising.

113
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:11,525
Like we said that Christ said,

114
00:09:11,816 --> 00:09:13,983
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

115
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:18,234
Christians are the worst as far as their eyes are concerned.

116
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:25,275
In the same way, in the Hindu religion it is said that

117
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,525
everybody has the spirit.

118
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:34,775
Still the Hindus believe in the different castes and communities

119
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,775
and fight with each other.

120
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:45,400
Everything that was preached, just the opposite of it is followed.

121
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:48,524
If you read even Koran, in the Koran,

122
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,484
Mohammed Sahib has all the time

123
00:09:51,816 --> 00:09:54,442
said about rahmat, means compassion.

124
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:56,525
But you don’t find it anywhere.

125
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:58,566
He has not said about shariat,

126
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:00,317
He has not said of many things

127
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,816
which are being practiced by Muslims, just on their own.

128
00:10:05,275 --> 00:10:07,608
He never said that women should cover their face

129
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:10,192
or cover their heads,

130
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:14,067
but it is practiced and not practiced but vengeance.

131
00:10:14,484 --> 00:10:19,983
So what it shows to us is this, that whatever is preached,

132
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:24,691
just the opposite of that people try to do.

133
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:32,067
And when such things happen, the dharma goes down.

134
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:38,150
Now as you know that Krishna, His country is America.

135
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:40,442
He rules over America.

136
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:48,983
So it is a rich country because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

137
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:53,108
He is the Lord of wealth.

138
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:57,234
So, He has given wealth to America.

139
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:05,400
Then He is Vachana, means communication.

140
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:11,691
His another quality is that He is the one who communicated.

141
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:16,691
It was He who danced with gopis and gopas.

142
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:24,108
It was He who transferred His powers to them.

143
00:11:24,566 --> 00:11:30,733
So the communication part is one of His greatest qualities

144
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,484
that is working in America.

145
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,067
So they are going just the opposite way

146
00:11:39,484 --> 00:11:42,275
that if there is a war, say, with Saddam Hussein,

147
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,608
so America is going.

148
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:47,650
If there’s Korean War, America is going.

149
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:52,691
Everywhere there is any problem, America has to go.

150
00:11:52,942 --> 00:11:54,275
I mean, one can ask question,

151
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:56,275
“Who are you? Why, why are you bothered?

152
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,566
Keep to your own country enjoying yourself.

153
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,775
Why are you sending troops all over?

154
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,525
Why are you looking after everyone?”

155
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,484
Even the formation of UN and all that is done

156
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:09,816
under the guidance of the Americans.

157
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:12,484
They play a very important part

158
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:16,442
in the formation of this United Nations

159
00:12:16,858 --> 00:12:22,150
and one world and peace and all sorts of things.

160
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:28,983
But actually, if you see, the main thing that Krishna had taught,

161
00:12:29,442 --> 00:12:31,858
they are missing.

162
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:33,900
They are all right for communication.

163
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:37,733
They are all right for establishing

164
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:40,900
relationships between countries.

165
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:45,484
But the worst thing they have done is that there is no dharma,

166
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:49,484
no idea of dharma, no morality.

167
00:12:50,442 --> 00:12:54,067
Democracy without morality.

168
00:12:54,524 --> 00:13:00,025
To talk of morality in America is something out of the blue.

169
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:05,025
They cannot understand anyone who talks of morality.

170
00:13:05,525 --> 00:13:09,733
Now, of course, the pangs of their doings

171
00:13:10,108 --> 00:13:13,150
is really torturing them.

172
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:17,650
And also they are realizing, some of them,

173
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:21,275
that because of immoral behavior

174
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:26,317
they have come to a point where

175
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,983
sixty-five percent people of that country who are Americans

176
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,733
may suffer from some disease or may just die out

177
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,442
at a very young age.

178
00:13:40,775 --> 00:13:45,983
When it is coming

179
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:53,317
as a starking

180
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,525
information is a shock.

181
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:04,566
But despite that, despite all this,

182
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:08,067
they are still going on with it and thinking that

183
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,317
“No, no, no, it’s all right. It’s not for us. What is there to worry?”

184
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:17,942
Now His punishments have started,

185
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,317
which they don’t realize how the punishment has started.

186
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:27,275
Now supposing somebody is leading an immoral life

187
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:32,234
and as a result he develops some disease.

188
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:37,275
Now this disease is not curable.

189
00:14:38,108 --> 00:14:41,192
They try everything to find out the ways and methods

190
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:44,067
of curing these diseases which are coming

191
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:48,025
out of immoral living. They cannot.

192
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:54,608
It’s an impossible task for all the medical sciences of America

193
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:58,983
to find out how to cure these particular diseases

194
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:01,733
which are coming out of immorality.

195
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,067
But the worst part is that they cannot even say

196
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:09,359
that immorality is wrong.

197
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:15,691
They cannot even openly admit that immoral behavior

198
00:15:16,108 --> 00:15:19,442
leads to these things.

199
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:24,442
And this immorality is completely neglected

200
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,650
in a country of Shri Krishna where He was born,

201
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:34,983
always He says, just to establish morality.

202
00:15:36,275 --> 00:15:39,317
Artificial morality, that is there,

203
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:43,234
like the Islamic talk about or the Christians talk about

204
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:48,900
or Hindus talk about, is artificial, where they are hypocritical.

205
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,691
They follow one code of conduct

206
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:59,192
and another they have for themselves secretly adopted.

207
00:15:59,566 --> 00:16:03,275
But America is an open thing.

208
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:07,025
Whatsoever they are doing they are not hiding it.

209
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:09,608
They say, “We don’t believe in hypocrisy.”

210
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:11,691
So they are not hiding it.

211
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:16,025
And this has led this country, such a vast,

212
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,983
beautiful, rich, prosperous country,

213
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:22,900
into such a ditch that I do not know

214
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,025
how it is going to recover unless and until

215
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,900
it takes to Sahaja Yoga.

216
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:35,566
Now another thing what dharma does to a normal person?

217
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:39,275
A dharmic person is the one who is always

218
00:16:39,608 --> 00:16:42,025
introspective by nature.

219
00:16:42,484 --> 00:16:49,317
He tries to see, “Am I doing things all right? Is it correct?”

220
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:54,858
He doesn’t allow his mind to justify wrong things.

221
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,400
That is one of the signs of a real dharmic person.

222
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,359
He may not be a Sahaja yogi.

223
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:06,858
But he will ask himself, “Is it right or is it wrong?”

224
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,608
But that capacity is completely gone in America.

225
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,983
They never try to introspect themselves.

226
00:17:16,484 --> 00:17:20,524
On the contrary, they always say, “What’s wrong?”

227
00:17:20,983 --> 00:17:24,650
Those people who go on like this

228
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:32,733
will definitely fall into a mess of things

229
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:40,650
that will have no moral conductor, moral guidance.

230
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,650
It is introspection which gives you a awakened conscience.

231
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:53,524
It’s conscience which tells you, “This is wrong.”

232
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,025
They may be guided in one part.

233
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,067
For example, you see, they might say that

234
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:03,650
“We are all right in administration,” maybe, or,

235
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:10,524
“We are all right for, say, our railways, our shipping,

236
00:18:10,942 --> 00:18:15,524
our other things, or maybe other economic banks

237
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,524
or whatever it is.”

238
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,858
But all these things are extremely superficial

239
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:24,775
for human beings and they are outside.

240
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:30,400
The inside is all managed by the conscience

241
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:36,524
and also through moral inspection of yourself.

242
00:18:36,942 --> 00:18:39,566
People say, “Mother, what is this conscience is?”

243
00:18:40,025 --> 00:18:41,442
This conscience is there.

244
00:18:41,858 --> 00:18:47,192
It is there all the time, but a person who has to be

245
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:51,400
conscious about it. “I have a conscience”.

246
00:18:51,942 --> 00:18:55,650
And this conscience has to answer.

247
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,775
That conscience that is within us is,

248
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:05,816
is the light of Shri Krishna within us even before realization.

249
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,858
As you know, the ascent takes place, of Kundalini,

250
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,484
through the Sushumna which is guided by Mahalakshmi.

251
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,566
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

252
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,108
By listening to your conscience

253
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:32,816
you develop a proper channel of Mahalakshmi within yourself.

254
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,733
But the people who have no conscience,

255
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,359
in a particular line it’s not so; it is in every line, in every way.

256
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:42,525
Otherwise, one chakra will be all right,

257
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:45,317
another chakra will be in jeopardy.

258
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:49,650
So the conscience has to be referred to,

259
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:53,442
which is beyond rationality. It is not rationality.

260
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:57,067
Something may look like rational to kill somebody

261
00:19:57,484 --> 00:19:59,025
or to snatch somebody’s money

262
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:03,359
or to grab somebody’s land. May seem.

263
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:08,192
But conscience will tell you that this is not right.

264
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,025
At a time when people invaded so many countries

265
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:15,900
and tried to overpower them,

266
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,858
it was America which was the only country,

267
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:22,566
you must understand, never went out of their bounds

268
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:25,524
to become empires.

269
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:28,234
Very surprising, what kept them there.

270
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:31,566
Because at that time when all this nonsense was going on

271
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:37,067
all over the world, and that era when people

272
00:20:37,442 --> 00:20:39,359
didn’t mind subjecting other people,

273
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,816
taking away their lands and becoming this thing,

274
00:20:44,525 --> 00:20:47,400
America had stopped at that time.

275
00:20:47,816 --> 00:20:50,484
Before doing that, they had done once for all.

276
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,108
They had occupied the area, they became the landlords,

277
00:20:54,442 --> 00:20:57,317
they became this. Of course they were foreigners.

278
00:20:57,733 --> 00:20:59,858
But after having done that,

279
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,691
the era when the people started expanding their empire,

280
00:21:04,192 --> 00:21:07,067
they did not do it.

281
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,275
Now what is the reason? Why they didn’t do it?

282
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:12,650
We should ask a question:

283
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,816
when others were expanding their empires,

284
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:20,150
why did not America do it?

285
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:23,025
The reason is very simple.

286
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,900
At that time some great people with great conscience

287
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:29,317
were born in that country

288
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:33,192
and they guided that country.

289
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:37,816
Like, you can say, Washington was there.

290
00:21:38,317 --> 00:21:43,691
Of course, there were so many people, whom if I name there,

291
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:45,816
there will be a big list of those people.

292
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,234
But if you see their character, their life, the way they lived.

293
00:21:49,566 --> 00:21:51,775
Abraham Lincoln, if you see his life,

294
00:21:52,234 --> 00:21:55,150
full of conscience, full of conscience.

295
00:21:55,608 --> 00:22:00,816
And they didn’t allow the nation to be drifted away

296
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:04,234
to the ambition of gathering other countries

297
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,900
and making them their slaves and ...

298
00:22:07,317 --> 00:22:09,775
This they didn’t do.

299
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:16,067
So in the first place when the,

300
00:22:16,484 --> 00:22:18,983
when, I should say, Columbus went there, conquered them,

301
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,525
and tried to … actually, he didn’t do much.

302
00:22:24,983 --> 00:22:27,608
But Spanish and then others, and then Anglo-Saxons,

303
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:30,691
all of them, when they conquered that country,

304
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:33,816
once they settled down there,

305
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:39,691
as if that era was over for them once for all,

306
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,484
and then they started talking about freedom,

307
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:48,192
of democracy, of higher values.

308
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:55,816
But the karmas of their past,

309
00:22:56,442 --> 00:23:01,608
the way they killed so many aboriginals,

310
00:23:02,108 --> 00:23:04,650
so many Red Indians,

311
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,192
will not be forgiven by Shri Krishna

312
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:15,067
unless and until now they take to Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:19,858
Despite that time when they did not try

314
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,691
to overpower other countries and to spread their empire

315
00:23:24,108 --> 00:23:29,900
and do all kinds of cruelties, like Hitler, they didn’t do that.

316
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,566
And they always stood for something that is justice …

317
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,775
tried to, I mean, at least.

318
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,816
Then they became hypocritical also but on the whole,

319
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:43,192
on the face of it, they tried to show

320
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:46,524
that they are for uniting the whole world.

321
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,608
They are against racialism, against fundamentalism, all these,

322
00:23:51,983 --> 00:23:57,359
I mean, just some sort of an idealism they propagated.

323
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:04,150
But despite all that, all these ideas of self-destruction

324
00:24:04,524 --> 00:24:07,067
started working in them.

325
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,484
So I would say it is nothing but their karmas

326
00:24:12,816 --> 00:24:16,691
are working against them.

327
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:23,442
And that’s how the violence is so much rampant there.

328
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,566
So many diseases, so many things,

329
00:24:27,067 --> 00:24:32,359
it is very remarkable that all these troubles have started

330
00:24:32,858 --> 00:24:36,900
very, very recently in America,

331
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:43,108
because the exposure is coming up.

332
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,524
To add up to that, we had lots of false gurus

333
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:52,108
who went there and captured

334
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:55,942
innocent, simple people who were seeking the truth.

335
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,566
We have lost so many of them in America.

336
00:24:58,942 --> 00:25:04,067
Also there, I would say, in the atmosphere where these

337
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:07,484
curses of the people whom they had killed,

338
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,775
which reacted, and they took to something that was wrong.

339
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:15,816
Why should they have taken to wrong things

340
00:25:16,192 --> 00:25:19,650
as far as their personal life is concerned?

341
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:22,275
Freedom was given to them

342
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:26,775
but they thought freedom is there also to ruin themselves

343
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:30,525
or to make a mess out of their lives.

344
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:34,858
This is a wrong idea which worked in them.

345
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,650
Then the whole idea became collective.

346
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,733
When it became collective they found out that people

347
00:25:41,192 --> 00:25:43,900
like all those things that are destructive.

348
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,442
So, we have Hollywood there,

349
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,525
we have all such organizations and musicians

350
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:58,025
and big, big, we can say, destructive forces

351
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:06,150
which have formed groups and militant organizations

352
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:13,775
which openly say that “We are that.”

353
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:20,983
For example, only in America we have satan’s,

354
00:26:21,442 --> 00:26:25,650
satan’s organization, devils’ organizations.

355
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:30,442
Then there’s witchcraft. Openly.

356
00:26:30,942 --> 00:26:36,150
Openly, they are registered organizations in America,

357
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,108
when nowhere in the world you can have such a thing

358
00:26:39,442 --> 00:26:41,442
that this is a black magic organization,

359
00:26:41,816 --> 00:26:43,400
this is a witchcraft organization,

360
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:46,983
openly they are registered there.

361
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:50,691
So to such an extent they have gone;

362
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,608
and accepted collectively.

363
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:59,733
The reason is the punishment.

364
00:27:00,484 --> 00:27:05,858
That’s why America is the most difficult place for us,

365
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,650
for Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:12,733
One must have real sympathy for them.

367
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:17,733
They are now passing through the phase of punishment,

368
00:27:18,317 --> 00:27:23,108
because their forefathers did all kinds of wrong things

369
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:28,525
and they, too, never accepted Dharma as a principle of life.

370
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:32,525
They thought that Dharma means killing your freedom;

371
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:37,484
dharma means it takes away your personal, private life

372
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:43,608
into the hands of something else.

373
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:49,025
So to establish Dharma in America,

374
00:27:49,816 --> 00:27:51,525
what can we do?

375
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,691
I’ve been to America at least ten times

376
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:58,442
more than I’ve been to Russia

377
00:27:58,983 --> 00:28:06,108
and I want to really somehow or other bring to their notice that

378
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,650
"You have lost your Dharma."

379
00:28:09,025 --> 00:28:10,524
But this will never appeal to them

380
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:12,192
because they are very egoistical.

381
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,608
If you tell them like that, then they’ll be very angry.

382
00:28:16,067 --> 00:28:18,484
On the contrary, those who tell them, like Rajneesh

383
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,317
and all these people, “Oh, this, no dharma,” their weaknesses,

384
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:26,025
their egos are pampered. Then they are very happy.

385
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:29,025
So it’s a difficult task in that country

386
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:33,608
to make people understand that you are under punishment,

387
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:36,775
that this punishment you can only overcome

388
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:39,442
if you become Sahaja yogis.

389
00:28:39,816 --> 00:28:43,484
With Sahaja Yoga their dharma will be awakened

390
00:28:43,942 --> 00:28:49,359
and all their punishments and all their curses will be over.

391
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:52,359
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga much more

392
00:28:52,733 --> 00:28:54,566
than any other country.

393
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:58,525
My concern for America is for the same reason.

394
00:28:59,108 --> 00:29:01,525
I’m not saying so much about South America

395
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:04,400
but more about the North America.

396
00:29:04,816 --> 00:29:07,900
But even in South America, what I found is

397
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:16,484
that it is a kind of a nation

398
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:24,524
where they have no guidance at all about Dharma, no guidance.

399
00:29:25,317 --> 00:29:28,234
Openly they are doing carnival, this, that.

400
00:29:28,691 --> 00:29:33,858
I mean, how can you do it in a country, all those things?

401
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:37,816
They are following the footsteps of North America.

402
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:41,150
Like in North America they have that Halloween nonsense.

403
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:42,983
I mean, imagine openly on the street

404
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,275
doing Halloween nonsense.

405
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,192
So they are following carnival.

406
00:29:47,608 --> 00:29:50,566
To them, “Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

407
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:54,566
as if there is a very big achievement and going into that carnival

408
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:56,067
from all over the places.

409
00:29:56,524 --> 00:30:00,733
From Australia people are coming down.

410
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:07,317
All this is working against them very much.

411
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:11,025
Their situation is so bad in so many ways

412
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:18,150
that it is not easy to explain why they are going to that limit.

413
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:24,775
Like thirteen-year-old girls are made into prostitutes in Brazil.

414
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,608
Openly.

415
00:30:29,484 --> 00:30:33,525
All their trees are cut in Amazon. Openly.

416
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:37,025
Whole smuggling is done, openly.

417
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:39,900
Their politicians are corrupt.

418
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:43,733
There, I mean, so much of black magic there,

419
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,067
so much of black magic. Openly that.

420
00:30:47,524 --> 00:30:53,525
They are just following the footsteps of North America.

421
00:30:54,025 --> 00:30:58,983
The Dharma is like this Catholic Church is there.

422
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:02,942
What is it going to teach them Dharma, this Catholic Church?

423
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:06,524
So they go to church, they do everything

424
00:31:06,942 --> 00:31:12,942
and they come back home with same ideas that they have.

425
00:31:13,524 --> 00:31:17,524
There are countries and countries which are so very poor.

426
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:23,150
So that shows that Kubera’s attention is not on that country.

427
00:31:23,691 --> 00:31:27,192
Normally, poor people are dharmic, normally.

428
00:31:27,816 --> 00:31:29,983
Because you see, money gives them these ideas

429
00:31:30,442 --> 00:31:33,317
to do all nonsensical things and ego.

430
00:31:33,775 --> 00:31:38,900
Normally, the poor people are dharmic but there it is different.

431
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:42,359
They indulge into black magic too much.

432
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:45,524
They were telling Me that it is the black magic

433
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:48,359
which came from Africa and they have accepted.

434
00:31:48,775 --> 00:31:52,400
But so much it is developed in South America

435
00:31:52,816 --> 00:31:55,942
that it is impossible to understand that

436
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:59,150
how they have accepted this nonsense

437
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:02,942
so easily to curse themselves.

438
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,150
Now, we have to understand that these problems

439
00:32:06,484 --> 00:32:11,816
also exist within ourselves, on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

440
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:18,525
If we have to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra all right,

441
00:32:19,192 --> 00:32:24,317
we have two sides as you know, is the left and the right.

442
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:32,524
So the right side is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is speaking,

443
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:36,108
which is talking about Dharma,

444
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:41,858
which is on the aggressive side, we can say.

445
00:32:42,733 --> 00:32:46,234
Now those people who are aggressive,

446
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,525
who talk in an aggressive manner,

447
00:32:48,942 --> 00:32:54,816
who are, say, trying to dominate others by their talks,

448
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:59,400
are the people who are right-sided.

449
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:04,400
I’ve seen people, those who really do wrong things.

450
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:08,942
Say, a person, a servant steals something.

451
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:13,524
You call him, he’ll be so rude to you that you’ll be amazed.

452
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,234
This man is so rude.

453
00:33:15,608 --> 00:33:20,525
How can he, how can have been able to steal something?

454
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:25,067
He’s not afraid; he’s answering you back so nicely.

455
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:27,775
So those people who are right-sided

456
00:33:28,192 --> 00:33:30,733
can cover up any sin that they have committed,

457
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,400
any wrong they have done,

458
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:36,150
any murder they have done, by their talk.

459
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,484
It could be a talk which is very aggressive, blatant.

460
00:33:41,858 --> 00:33:46,025
People might think, “Oh, how can that be?

461
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:49,608
This man is telling so loudly everything,”

462
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:53,067
and you just, you are stunned and you think,

463
00:33:53,442 --> 00:33:56,484
“No, it’s not possible. How can a person who says this thing ?”

464
00:33:56,858 --> 00:34:01,108
In this way we, too, as ordinary human beings,

465
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:06,067
indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things

466
00:34:06,525 --> 00:34:10,442
and then we try to justify it by talking,

467
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:13,192
wriggling out of it.

468
00:34:13,525 --> 00:34:20,067
You know as many criminals, war criminals,

469
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:24,067
have come out of it by just talking,

470
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:27,900
by creating stories, by showing something like that.

471
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,359
That also is with all human beings,

472
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:34,816
they have this capacity to say something

473
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:39,484
by which to hide whatever wrong you are doing.

474
00:34:39,858 --> 00:34:42,108
But it is never realized by them

475
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:47,234
that whatever harm you have done is not going to be forgiven

476
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:51,983
and will be less forgiven when you talk like this,

477
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,400
because Shri Krishna is finished.

478
00:34:55,942 --> 00:35:01,317
If you start justifying, rationalizing all your wrong things,

479
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:06,858
then you will be punished and you will be punished very badly

480
00:35:07,317 --> 00:35:11,942
in so many ways that you will not know how to get it out of it.

481
00:35:12,442 --> 00:35:16,983
Physically, mentally, emotionally, every way you’ll be.

482
00:35:17,566 --> 00:35:24,858
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have a temperament,

483
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:29,775
a culture, a style, a behavior

484
00:35:30,234 --> 00:35:33,025
which has got the quality of Shri Krishna,

485
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:38,608
which is called as madhurya, means melodious, melodious.

486
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:43,566
We should talk in such a manner that it should be melodious.

487
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:47,108
The person who listens to you,

488
00:35:47,566 --> 00:35:55,150
listens as if he’s listening to the flute of Shri Krishna.

489
00:35:55,608 --> 00:35:59,900
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be sweet like that.

490
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:05,691
When you talk to someone it should be melodious.

491
00:36:06,275 --> 00:36:08,234
It should not be aggressive, at all,

492
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,608
but on the contrary it should be melodious.

493
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:15,983
It should not be sarcastic; it should not hurt another person.

494
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:21,067
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming

495
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:24,025
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

496
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:28,192
So in no way one should hurt.

497
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:33,400
I wish all the Sahaja yogis develop that melodious voice

498
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:37,359
of Shri Krishna as their Vishuddhi is awakened.

499
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:43,942
Madhurya, in his behavior, madhurya is – you see,

500
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:48,942
while talking to someone there are so many gestures by which

501
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,150
you can express your madhurya.

502
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:58,775
For example, specially in Italy and other places,

503
00:36:59,192 --> 00:37:00,983
I’ve seen people use too much of their hands.

504
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,067
This is also Shri Krishna’s style.

505
00:37:03,524 --> 00:37:05,275
So they use their hands in such a way

506
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:09,359
that sometimes you don’t understand what they are meaning.

507
00:37:09,775 --> 00:37:12,025
And sometimes it can be quite aggressive also,

508
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:14,025
the way they use their hands.

509
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:17,359
Now, the hands must be used in such a way

510
00:37:17,775 --> 00:37:20,775
that it should create madhurya.

511
00:37:21,234 --> 00:37:26,359
I’ve seen this in Russia or specially in Eastern blocs

512
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:30,150
where people, they have to express their love

513
00:37:30,525 --> 00:37:35,275
– [just put like this, it’s cold] – if they have to say namaste.

514
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:38,234
The whole expression is so sweet,

515
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:44,900
and also their heart is very full when they see Me.

516
00:37:45,317 --> 00:37:47,359
So they don’t know how to express it.

517
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:52,067
So they just put their hands like this.

518
00:37:52,524 --> 00:37:54,691
Or they feel shy, they do like this.

519
00:37:55,234 --> 00:37:59,317
Very, very sweet things they express through their hands,

520
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:05,108
through their eyes. It is the tears, you see,

521
00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:13,150
that really create such clouds of, I should say,

522
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:16,192
very dense clouds of compassion in My heart

523
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:21,150
when I see their eyes expressing their love for Me.

524
00:38:21,608 --> 00:38:26,858
Everything, the tears, everything, that’s the face,

525
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:32,442
the eyes, the hands, all these belong to Shri Krishna.

526
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,067
So in their behavior, in their talking,

527
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:40,192
how they express themselves.

528
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:42,400
You can use the same eyes

529
00:38:42,816 --> 00:38:44,858
for showing your temper and getting angry.

530
00:38:45,317 --> 00:38:48,108
Many people use eyes for controlling others.

531
00:38:48,524 --> 00:38:51,983
They’ll put their eyes like this, stare at someone, try to control.

532
00:38:52,484 --> 00:38:58,691
They may use their eyes also for condemning someone.

533
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:03,524
Also sometimes they use, sort of spit at someone

534
00:39:04,025 --> 00:39:10,150
or try to show the tongue to insult someone.

535
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:17,442
So in the behavior also we must have a kind of a sweetness.

536
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:21,025
Like when I went to, went to England first,

537
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:24,359
I was, you see, I learnt English in My own way.

538
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:26,816
But when I went there newly they said,

539
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,234
“Now, if you have to say word like ‘thought’

540
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:32,234
you must say ‘thought’.” I said, “What?”

541
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,942
“You must take out your tongue and say ‘thought’”.

542
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:39,775
I said, “Is absurd. Why should you take out your tongue?”

543
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:43,317
He said, “Unless and until you take out your tongue like that

544
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:48,108
is not something, proper expression.”

545
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:50,525
So I said, “This is English. You have developed

546
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,983
some nonsensical things, to show tongue at it, everyone.”

547
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,317
Even a child, you know, when he gets angry

548
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,983
automatically he shows his tongue.

549
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:04,442
So you see all these expressions are – and making faces now,

550
00:40:04,816 --> 00:40:07,983
as they say that ‘stiff upper lip,’ you see.

551
00:40:08,317 --> 00:40:11,525
You must have heard about that, with a nose like that, you see,

552
00:40:11,858 --> 00:40:14,983
snooty nose or a face where you just make your faces

553
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:21,608
and make a crooked face just to tease someone

554
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:26,733
or to make an expression out of your nose.

555
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:28,525
Also people do it like this, you see,

556
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,816
to show as if you are sneezing at that person.

557
00:40:32,317 --> 00:40:34,858
All these things, expressions, are coming

558
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:41,983
out of Shri Krishna’s grace, but the power of that is madhurya,

559
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:45,775
is the sweetness, the melodiousness;

560
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:52,234
the rapport should be so sweet that that rapport should create

561
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:55,858
tremendous joy and tremendous happiness.

562
00:40:56,275 --> 00:41:00,691
As you have heard the song of Baba Mama’s on My eyes:

563
00:41:01,108 --> 00:41:05,192
only I looked at him, I say with that glance

564
00:41:05,525 --> 00:41:08,650
– that generated that beautiful music in him.

565
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:13,067
So, as far as possible, as far as possible,

566
00:41:13,484 --> 00:41:16,983
try to put your eyes on the greenery; that’s the best.

567
00:41:17,484 --> 00:41:21,900
Then it soothes down and also you develop

568
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:25,067
the soothing quality of the greenery.

569
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:28,150
I always tell people that “Better see the greenery around,

570
00:41:28,566 --> 00:41:29,816
how it soothes your eyes.”

571
00:41:30,317 --> 00:41:33,816
In the same way you should try to soothe

572
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:37,067
the other person when you talk to that person.

573
00:41:37,442 --> 00:41:39,025
The person must melt.

574
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,317
Instead of that, if you start arguing and fighting with that person,

575
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:44,900
that person will never melt.

576
00:41:45,234 --> 00:41:49,359
On the contrary, you’ll be adding fire, more fire to that person.

577
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:53,691
That was the quality of Shri Krishna, is the madhurya,

578
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,942
and that it is expressed in His lifetime

579
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:03,400
how He beautifully managed to say things

580
00:42:03,775 --> 00:42:10,025
in His own sweetness, specially in His childhood.

581
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:14,359
The another quality which Shri Krishna has, which

582
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:20,858
we can express through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

583
00:42:21,192 --> 00:42:23,192
But there are two types of diplomacies:

584
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:26,067
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

585
00:42:26,524 --> 00:42:31,192
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have to take to

586
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:35,566
a certain standard or you don’t have to read some books

587
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:39,275
to know what is diplomacy.

588
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:42,858
Is a genuinely it comes to you.

589
00:42:43,275 --> 00:42:46,525
It, the whole thing works very sweetly,

590
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:49,983
in such a genuine manner.

591
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:53,192
I, I have used it many-a-times Myself,

592
00:42:53,566 --> 00:42:56,025
and you all can use it also many-a-times.

593
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,442
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry with them;

594
00:42:59,858 --> 00:43:02,566
not possible if you are angry.

595
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:07,025
Now, there’s a story I’ve told you about some,

596
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,816
this Gagangiri Maharaj.

597
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:12,234
I went to meet him and he was very angry

598
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,359
because he could not stop the rain.

599
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,150
He was supposed to stop the rain.

600
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:18,108
And I was all drenched.

601
00:43:18,484 --> 00:43:20,192
And he was so angry and he said that

602
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:22,775
“Is it my ego You are trying to control?”

603
00:43:23,108 --> 00:43:25,691
and like that he started little bit fighting with Me.

604
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,983
I said, “No, that’s not the reason.”

605
00:43:28,484 --> 00:43:31,691
He said, “Why? Why did You not allow me to stop the rain?

606
00:43:32,025 --> 00:43:32,858
You are all drenched.”

607
00:43:33,192 --> 00:43:35,733
I said, “Because you are a sanyasi

608
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:37,359
and you bought a sari for Me.

609
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,524
I would not take a sari from a sanyasi.

610
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,983
So I had to get drenched, for your sake.”

611
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:46,942
The whole thing finished off.

612
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:50,733
The whole anger, temper, finished off.

613
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:54,067
This is how we have to melt people.

614
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:59,733
The diplomacy is not convincing anybody

615
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:03,900
with his intellect or by temper or anything

616
00:44:04,317 --> 00:44:10,234
but it is to melt away another person by your goodness,

617
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:13,067
by your good words, by your sweet words,

618
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,317
by your forgiving nature.

619
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:20,400
This quality He had and He tried this on many people.

620
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:23,524
It worked on some; it did not work on some.

621
00:44:23,983 --> 00:44:25,525
He didn’t feel it’s a failure.

622
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:28,025
It’s the reaction of the another person

623
00:44:28,442 --> 00:44:30,525
which is important to be seen.

624
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,442
So this quality of Right Vishuddhi you should have,

625
00:44:34,816 --> 00:44:39,608
is to talk to others and melt them away.

626
00:44:39,942 --> 00:44:44,067
I hope in America people develop this quality

627
00:44:44,525 --> 00:44:48,400
and try to improve relations with each other.

628
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:51,733
Actually, to talk to they are very sweet, I must say.

629
00:44:52,192 --> 00:44:53,775
They get very friendly with you.

630
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,775
You give them any number of presents,

631
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,816
they’ll be very happy but they’ll never give you any present.

632
00:44:59,234 --> 00:45:01,192
You call them for dinner, anything,

633
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:04,359
they’ll ten times they will come to your house for dinner

634
00:45:04,775 --> 00:45:06,691
but they will never call you for dinner.

635
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,566
You see, they are very friendly as long

636
00:45:09,942 --> 00:45:11,484
as you are doing anything for them.

637
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,442
But when it comes to returning it they find it difficult;

638
00:45:15,858 --> 00:45:19,442
they don’t do it. So, you see the whole thing amounts

639
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:23,067
to be a very sweet exploitation of another person.

640
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:26,484
This is what is to be understood that by sweetness

641
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,275
you are not going to exploit anyone but by sweetness

642
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:34,525
you are going to melt that person and bring him to the level

643
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:40,359
that he can understand what is goodness.

644
00:45:41,025 --> 00:45:43,816
Now, about South America, I’ve already told you

645
00:45:44,317 --> 00:45:48,900
that they are extremely simple and innocent people.

646
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:52,192
They are very poor, simple, innocent,

647
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:55,650
but what has entered them into is this black magic,

648
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:59,942
and which they are now realizing, luckily,

649
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:03,150
that this is black magic which is troubling them.

650
00:46:03,608 --> 00:46:06,067
But somehow they have depended on it so much,

651
00:46:06,484 --> 00:46:07,566
on the left side.

652
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,192
They feel very guilty about it; they feel very bad.

653
00:46:10,524 --> 00:46:12,900
All the time you find them absolutely guilty.

654
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:14,858
Their whole behavior is that

655
00:46:15,317 --> 00:46:17,400
as if they have done something wrong

656
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,691
but they do not know how to correct themselves.

657
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,733
So for us is important not to feel guilty about anything.

658
00:46:26,192 --> 00:46:28,775
We are all Sahaja yogis.

659
00:46:29,192 --> 00:46:31,858
How can we have guilt after all, when we are the spirit?

660
00:46:32,234 --> 00:46:33,983
Spirit cannot have the guilt.

661
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,234
So this guilt has to go away.

662
00:46:36,608 --> 00:46:41,733
But by guilt what do we do, what we lose is the witness power,

663
00:46:42,192 --> 00:46:45,275
because when there is a guilt we put it here, the guilt is there.

664
00:46:45,691 --> 00:46:48,192
But we cannot see.

665
00:46:48,566 --> 00:46:51,900
We cannot witness what’s wrong

666
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:54,317
and we do not want to face the difficulty,

667
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:58,524
our mistakes or the difficulty we have.

668
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:01,025
Just put it as a guilt here, finished.

669
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,359
Is stored up there nicely, guilt.

670
00:47:03,775 --> 00:47:05,442
But we do not want to face it.

671
00:47:05,816 --> 00:47:09,942
For example a man, say, or a woman is very cruel by nature.

672
00:47:10,317 --> 00:47:13,858
Then suddenly she realizes that she has been cruel

673
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:16,234
or whatever it is. So she puts it down there,

674
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:18,442
“Oh, I’ve been very bad. I’ve been very cruel,

675
00:47:18,775 --> 00:47:22,608
this thing, that thing.” But she doesn’t face it.

676
00:47:22,983 --> 00:47:25,400
Facing means she should know, “Why was I cruel?

677
00:47:25,691 --> 00:47:27,858
What was the need for me? I should not have been cruel

678
00:47:28,275 --> 00:47:31,691
and now I will not be cruel anymore.” That finishes off.

679
00:47:32,108 --> 00:47:35,650
But, “I’m very guilty about it. I’m very guilty about it,”

680
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:38,108
doesn’t help. On the contrary, you know,

681
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,025
what are the problems are of the guilt,

682
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,733
and the same problems are today faced by South America.

683
00:47:45,275 --> 00:47:48,108
When I went there I was surprised that in Brazil

684
00:47:48,525 --> 00:47:53,900
the man who was the topmost there talked to Me in a manner,

685
00:47:54,317 --> 00:47:56,733
“Oh, we are, we know we have lots of defects.

686
00:47:57,192 --> 00:47:59,234
We know we are no good,” this, that.

687
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:02,858
What I just say, why doesn’t he correct?

688
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,442
If he knows this is the mistake, this is the thing,

689
00:48:08,816 --> 00:48:10,983
why shouldn’t he correct? Then he told Me that

690
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,900
“You write to me all the things You found wrong with us.”

691
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:16,108
And it was really very sweet of him.

692
00:48:16,566 --> 00:48:20,150
So then one journalist came and we told him.

693
00:48:20,484 --> 00:48:22,608
And now I think they are doing something about it.

694
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,525
They are trying to improve it and things will improve definitely.

695
00:48:26,025 --> 00:48:30,525
But on the contrary I found that Russia is very different.

696
00:48:30,858 --> 00:48:34,108
In Russia they never said, “We are guilty,” or anything,

697
00:48:34,524 --> 00:48:37,067
nothing of the kind. They never said so.

698
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:39,359
They said, “That time is over now.

699
00:48:39,691 --> 00:48:42,942
We are in the kingdom of God. Finished.

700
00:48:43,317 --> 00:48:47,317
So that is over. We are now in the Kingdom of God

701
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,359
and we have to enjoy life.” Everything positive.

702
00:48:51,691 --> 00:48:53,942
Never talked of their past, of their governments

703
00:48:54,317 --> 00:48:58,858
or this happened, or Stalin or Lenin or anyone.

704
00:48:59,317 --> 00:49:02,400
They were not concerned. They were above it.

705
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:05,108
“So why should we worry?” They said, “Why should we worry?

706
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,942
Let them fight. Let them do what they like.”

707
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,983
They don’t want to know anything about their politics,

708
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,317
about their problems or anything.

709
00:49:13,733 --> 00:49:15,525
They think, “Our problems are solved.

710
00:49:15,942 --> 00:49:17,691
We are now realized souls.

711
00:49:18,108 --> 00:49:20,900
We are enjoying ourselves. Let us enjoy.”

712
00:49:21,317 --> 00:49:24,525
Very straight-forward way of understanding Sahaja Yoga.

713
00:49:25,025 --> 00:49:26,983
But I’ve seen people, they write to Me

714
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,775
ten pages of their confessions as if I am a priest,

715
00:49:30,192 --> 00:49:33,525
Catholic priest, you see, all about their, what they have done,

716
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,983
this they have done, and I don’t want to read it.

717
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,108
Just throw it or I burn it off.

718
00:49:39,566 --> 00:49:42,067
So they try to confess. There’s no need to confess.

719
00:49:42,525 --> 00:49:46,234
There’s nothing to say. And not to dwell upon

720
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,775
what wrongs you have done, but now enjoy what you have got it.

721
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:53,733
It’s like this: supposing a beggar is made a king, all right?

722
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:57,524
Then he should enjoy his kingdom, should behave like a king.

723
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,858
But still he remembers his past more,

724
00:50:00,275 --> 00:50:01,816
so anybody who passes by he says,

725
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:06,150
“Give me five rupees or five pounds.” It’s like that.

726
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:08,524
Once you are in the Kingdom of God,

727
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,983
know that you are in the Kingdom of God.

728
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:16,275
But this black magic business is very, very dangerous

729
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:18,359
and it can act through anyone.

730
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:21,691
It can act through your relations, act through your friends,

731
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:23,400
act through anyone.

732
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:26,983
So one has to be very careful that you do not become,

733
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,234
because of your guilt business or whatever it is,

734
00:50:30,691 --> 00:50:34,317
you become vulnerable to black magic.

735
00:50:34,775 --> 00:50:37,400
It can ruin you. It can ruin your families.

736
00:50:37,816 --> 00:50:40,733
Even if you are a Sahaja yogi it can ruin you.

737
00:50:41,275 --> 00:50:44,816
So this guilt business has to be given up completely.

738
00:50:45,234 --> 00:50:47,733
You should not be guilty. Guilt is put into you.

739
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,816
Somebody can say, “Oh you are so bad.

740
00:50:50,234 --> 00:50:53,108
You didn’t do this for me. You didn’t do that,”

741
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:55,359
or something like that. They put ideas.

742
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:58,025
Then you start feeling, “Oh, I should have done this for them.

743
00:50:58,317 --> 00:51:01,275
I should have. It was wrong on my part,” or something,

744
00:51:01,566 --> 00:51:02,525
and then the guilt starts.

745
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,691
Instead of doing something for that person

746
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,983
or instead of understanding that this all nonsense,

747
00:51:08,442 --> 00:51:11,524
they go on brooding on that, brooding and then suddenly

748
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:17,775
they find they are in the trouble of getting possessed

749
00:51:18,192 --> 00:51:20,942
or being affected by black magic.

750
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,108
So one has to forget it and get into the atmosphere

751
00:51:25,524 --> 00:51:30,525
where you know that you are now in the kingdom of God.

752
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:34,608
For Shri Krishna, whatever is to be said is less than

753
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,108
what He’s said always, I always feel,

754
00:51:37,525 --> 00:51:44,525
and that His main work is through our brain.

755
00:51:45,025 --> 00:51:49,067
That is Virata. He works through our brain.

756
00:51:49,566 --> 00:51:51,816
And as Shiva works through our heart,

757
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:54,025
He works through our brain.

758
00:51:54,524 --> 00:52:00,108
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,

759
00:52:00,524 --> 00:52:04,108
all the subtleties of the brain and the knowledge

760
00:52:04,608 --> 00:52:08,234
starts manifesting and expressing itself.

761
00:52:08,608 --> 00:52:10,484
But the greatest thing that happens,

762
00:52:10,816 --> 00:52:12,691
that integration takes place in your brain.

763
00:52:13,108 --> 00:52:14,983
It’s not that your heart wants one thing

764
00:52:15,442 --> 00:52:17,317
and your brain wants another thing.

765
00:52:17,733 --> 00:52:19,150
The integration takes place.

766
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:21,067
And when that integration takes place

767
00:52:21,484 --> 00:52:24,733
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

768
00:52:25,192 --> 00:52:29,524
Even without thinking about it, without reading about it,

769
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:31,816
you just become dharmic.

770
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,150
You are not to be told that you have to be dharmic.

771
00:52:34,525 --> 00:52:37,733
Innately you become dharmic because your brain,

772
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:42,359
which normally is used for rationality,

773
00:52:42,816 --> 00:52:44,691
for justifying all that is wrong,

774
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:49,442
becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

775
00:52:49,816 --> 00:52:53,317
This is the greatest thing that Shri Krishna does to you

776
00:52:53,733 --> 00:52:58,608
is to make your brain, brain itself dharmic.

777
00:52:59,067 --> 00:53:08,150
It becomes a vehicle of understanding Dharma,

778
00:53:08,983 --> 00:53:18,359
of leading a dharmic life and of standing firmly on Dharma.

779
00:53:18,816 --> 00:53:25,400
It’s the brain; it is the brain which really,

780
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:31,900
mostly, takes you away from Dharma, apart from black magic.

781
00:53:32,484 --> 00:53:37,192
But once your Sahasrara is opened out,

782
00:53:37,691 --> 00:53:43,192
Virata is expressed.

783
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:45,775
Then you are amazed at yourself.

784
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,525
The one who was indulging into everything thinking,

785
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:51,525
“This is pleasure. This is my right. I should have done it.

786
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:53,608
Who else can tell me?” and all that,

787
00:53:53,942 --> 00:53:56,900
suddenly you become a prophet.

788
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,484
This is the greatest blessing of Shri Krishna

789
00:54:00,816 --> 00:54:06,025
that He is Virat, and the Virat is your brain,

790
00:54:06,524 --> 00:54:10,608
and the brain of God Almighty is Virat.

791
00:54:11,067 --> 00:54:13,650
So this is what one has to realize,

792
00:54:14,025 --> 00:54:17,524
that after realization a person gets ideas

793
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:21,484
which are always constructive, and if they are not,

794
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:23,484
then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

795
00:54:23,942 --> 00:54:28,234
Constructive and dharmic, that is very, very important

796
00:54:28,608 --> 00:54:33,484
for us to understand, where is our mind going?

797
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:40,775
Is it contradicting, it is telling something else than what it is?

798
00:54:41,442 --> 00:54:45,942
We have to just keep a watch and you’ll be amazed to see

799
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:50,317
how your brain has changed its ways.

800
00:54:50,816 --> 00:54:54,400
The upside brain has become normal.

801
00:54:54,816 --> 00:55:01,524
This you can get very easily if you just meditate

802
00:55:01,983 --> 00:55:07,983
every day and see for yourself how the expression

803
00:55:08,442 --> 00:55:13,608
of your Sahasrara is penetrating into your being

804
00:55:14,067 --> 00:55:17,067
and is acting in your life.

805
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:21,275
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

806
00:55:21,733 --> 00:55:25,733
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,

807
00:55:26,108 --> 00:55:28,442
and others will never doubt you.

808
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:31,025
May God bless you.
