00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.320
Today, I have taken up the subject of Left Vishuddhi

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.440
because I felt that I must one day speak on this subject.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:22.360
That this is absolutely not intelligible to God that you are guilty.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.920
For what?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.720
Guilty for what are you?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.360
If you ask yourself you will say, “Oh, we are
guilty because we crucified Christ.” – at the most.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.800
That is the maximum guilt a human being
can say on his head. “We crucified Christ.”

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.560
“We tortured all the saints.” All right.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.760
But by being guilty what do you get?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.080
Do you get Him back? Can you go back
and correct that situation? You cannot.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.360
But harping upon that, you do get into your sub-conscious mind.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.280
You get into a position where you are
no more normal to receive the love of God.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.320
You recede into a corner of your mind which is darkness,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.520
which is ignorance, which is blindness;

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:29.560
where you cannot receive that beautiful
ray, that eternal flow that’s coming in.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.080
You hide yourself at the back and then you say, “What about the sun?

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.040
I cannot receive it because I don’t deserve it.”

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:51.640
Behind all this ego-orientation in the West though
I wish they were purely egoistical – they are not.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.280
All this ego recedes back into that
little pouch, what we call ‘the guilt’.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.120
You say something to someone.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.800
It’s not saying that thing at that stage

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.920
that, “I’ve said it, all right I’ve said it
and I take the responsibility. It’s good.”

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.120
Not that way. But you come back
home, “Oh, I should not have said that!”

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.960
So you wobble between one kind of action into another kind,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.560
from an aggressive to the another one of a receding type.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.600
And this wobbling really is very, very troublesome.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.520
It can go on too much, the oscillation could be
so much that it can make you absolutely frantic,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.160
diffident and sometimes useless.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.680
On the contrary, God wants to find
human beings who are cheerful people,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.680
who are happy people, who are thankful to Him for His blessings.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.920
The most unhappy animal in this world
is a human being. Can you believe that?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.640
Animals don’t know happiness and unhappiness, also a good point is.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.000
But the most unhappy human being and the most complicated human being

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.240
has become so over, you see, self-destructive

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.200
that a destruction force has built within himself.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.040
Now think of that force that has built you up into a human:

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.360
how with care and love, without your knowledge, without troubling you.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.880
Even when you were born you never knew what was the pain of the birth;

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.680
your mother took over it.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:55.240
He’s made you a human being so
carefully, delicately he’s built you up.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.680
For what? What is the fruit of this beautiful flower?

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.600
Why the flower starts hitting itself?
Have you ever heard of anyone like that?

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.320
This is the worst disease with which we, in the West, suffer.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.800
French, yes, we had at least double the number
of people than we have here today, surprisingly,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.920
but all of them had the same problem
and I think all their psychologists,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:44.200
psychoanalysts, the books, the writers,
the philosophers, everyone has done to them;

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.000
they have given you the ideas and everybody accepts them

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.080
and they curse themselves morning till evening,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.880
walking with so many wrinkles on the forehead.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.480
When you ask them they will say, “Mother we are very unhappy people.”

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.560
It’s like asking unhappiness to come and decorate you.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:19.520
But it has a subtler meaning, of which people are not aware.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.400
These are the times when you have to get your Realisation,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.240
this mass Realisation has to work out, is all prophesised,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.800
and very important times are these.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.840
All the stars are acting to help us.
The whole Universe is helping them.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.400
All the elements are helping us. We are on the stage.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.960
But when the actors arrive on the stage they are finished!

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.520
They can’t act, they can’t do anything, they can’t play their game.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.640
They are so involved with their different roles.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.440
And that is why one has to understand the subtler effect of it.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.080
Then only you will get rid of this guilt.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:13.280
You are playing into the hands of negative forces,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:22.160
they are not less than any atomic bombs, built within yourself.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.040
Now what is the way it works out, I think people do not realise it.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:35.680
It’s a very subtle method. Let’s see the atomic
bomb, hydrogen bomb, what will you do there?

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.360
They will separate something which should not be separated.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:48.520
We break atom which is not divisible into its divisible parts.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.680
So we put a pressure to break them.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.360
And when that breaking force, that aggression I would say,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:09.120
is worked out, that becomes another destructive force.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:17.920
So whatever effort we have put into
that multiplies; it’s not the same force.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.880
And that we use for our destruction.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:27.040
I mean, this, only human being can
do, to create things to destroy himself.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.840
But this force which works within our
minds, within ourselves, within our being

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.680
– where we actually really hate ourselves, sometimes I feel,

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.240
the way we are destroying ourselves –

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:46.480
this force we build within ourselves thanks
to many nonsensical writers and conditioners,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.160
and people who talk of conditioning really condition you much worse!

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.680
You should be singing and chirping like a bird.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.200
You should be laughing and enjoying life like a flower.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.840
But I find human beings faces, all, looking so very unhappy.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.080
What’s the reason?

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:14.440
The reason is you are separated from your own being,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:19.240
the being that integrates you. You are completely disintegrated.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:29.720
When you disintegrate a hydrogen atom,
you form a very big force [that is] built into it.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.720
In the same way, you are disintegrating your being:

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.560
your physical being on one side, your mental being on another side,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.720
your spiritual being on another side.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.440
There’s no integrating point.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.720
And when you cannot feel that integration you feel guilty,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:09:00.560
but that guilt is just a symptom of a
very big destructive force built-in you.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.520
This is the way we are going to destroy ourselves.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.360
No other way.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.720
Our destruction is not going to come to
us from outside, that can be controlled.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:20.280
It’s going to come from within, within ourselves.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:28.960
Everything we do now, after disintegration, is further disintegration

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:35.880
or further building up that negative force within ourselves.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:46.000
But to integrate it, to make you feel
complete integration with all your being,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:53.040
is only possible if you can somehow
or other get to that integrating force

00:09:53.120 --> 00:10:00.520
which is still there and is quite deep.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.840
That’s the last chance I would say now. That has to win.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.720
The way the negative forces have set in motion,

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.160
of which you may not be aware at all, you may not be aware,

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.880
you don’t know what darkness is there.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:30.720
And to fight it, what one has to do is to
bring in that light of the Spirit which integrates.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.960
Darkness always disintegrates you.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.600
For example there is complete darkness all right,

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.680
I can’t feel you, I don’t know who you are,
where you are sitting, [then] we are all separated.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.240
I can’t see you, I don’t know who you people are here.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:51.560
I wouldn’t know where is the window, where is
the door. I’ll hold this and say, “This is the Truth.”

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.400
All disintegrated personality.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.800
And disintegrated people always see
aberrations, they see different things,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.520
different auras, different things.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:11.560
So these forces are built within us, of negativity,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:17.000
when we go to the extremes of negativity.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:26.680
So, in the Kundalini shastra, we can say
that the left and right side, when used too much,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:33.240
you build up these forces in the head of
eleven Rudras, of the eleven destructive forces.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.320
A cancer patient develops it.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.480
But even before developing cancer people can develop it.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:47.200
And there are so many things that can create this

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.160
that sometimes one would feel, in this vicious circle,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.720
that how are you going to patch up the whole society?

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:06.240
And there’s only one thing that will
save the situation – it’s Self-realisation.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:13.120
All other things are destroying,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.680
are absolutely confusing.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.320
But there’s only one thing if you can do, it saves the whole thing.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.760
Like putting on the light – finished!

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.040
But people don’t understand the importance of Self-realisation,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.600
because some people ask me, “What’s the
use of getting the cool breeze in the hand?”

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.520
Now see the big canvas of the whole
thing, the whole cosmos, in a jeopardy.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.840
See what’s happening to human beings today.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:51.280
And if they are to be saved [there’s] no use being unhappy.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.240
Like in France they said, “You cannot
Mother, say you are a very happy person.”

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:04.920
I said, “Why?” “Because that means you are ignorant of the shocks.”

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.280
You see? I have to say, “I am very unhappy,”
you see. I have to paint some lines here to show

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:16.760
that I’m very deeply concerned, worried about the whole world.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:23.320
But what is the solution have you
got? You want me to be like you only?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.800
Is that the solution?

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:33.040
That if ten people are weeping you also
join them weeping? Is that the solution?

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:40.520
And the one and only method that we have,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:48.440
which has been already told and prescribed and has been prophesised,

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.680
nobody seeks it! No one seeks it!

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.400
What is the destination? And the destination is the Spirit.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:06.520
And today, the background is so black and so dark

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:13.720
that this solution is the end of everything.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.800
But do we realise this?

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:22.720
On the contrary the vicious circle builds in within us all the time.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.600
“Oh, see how the world is miserable! How can I be happy?”

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.760
“I am so unhappy in life!”

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:40.800
I have yet to come across a person before
Realisation saying that, “I am a happy person.”

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.640
Maybe ego-oriented people might
say, “I am happy.” meaning, “My ego [is]”.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.480
If he goes in a swanky car or something
like that he’s very happy, on top of the world!

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.720
After ten minutes you see him [looking miserable].

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:02.280
And this vicious circle is set in. This
ego-oriented circle, or another one, it sets in.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.600
Another vicious circle and another
vicious circle and another vicious circle,

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.760
we go on from one to another,

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:19.400
moving on the wheels after wheels
without realising that, “Where we are going?”

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.280
And this vicious circle has to be broken

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:36.720
by one faith, by one understanding, that God is forgiveness,

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.680
God is love.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:51.560
When we feel love for anyone without any
lust and greed, then that is God’s love within us.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:58.880
That He is the embodiment of that pure love

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.520
which just loves,

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:10.160
which has given you this beautiful human
life and wants to make you more beautiful.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:18.400
He created all this creation for you and that He
wants you to enjoy the bounties of this creation.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:24.840
He wants you to enjoy the citizen of
his realm and the Kingdom of his Grace.
