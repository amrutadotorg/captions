00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.182
About Sahaja culture, alright.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.730
Sahaja culture I explained to you what is
a Sahaja culture is, in which you have grow

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.340
then last night,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:21.190
where's Judy, she's there, come in, come in,
let them sit, now] then last night I talked

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.410
to you about ego.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:34.790
That how ego manifests itself and how it is
difficult to get out of the ego.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.940
It's easy to get out of the conditionings
super egos, but very difficult to get out

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:47.399
of ego because ego aggresses others, doesn't
trouble you at all, and you enjoy that aggression,

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.809
see.

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.960
Now, today I want to tell you about how ego
has been historically, traditionally torturing

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.329
people around.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.059
So you'll see the manifestation of this ego,
and then you will know that if you are playing

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:12.329
anything any role with your ego, you could
be part and parcel of that destructive force.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:19.079
So to begin with we'll see now, when this
ego started growing in man.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:44.729
First of all see, it started growing with
the protection, so

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:55.429
the pituitary, which is within us started
growing when we raised our head, like this.

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:02.659
When we were animals, our head were like this,
at that time the pineal body as it is called,

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.189
was very powerful.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.080
They say in human beings the pineal doesn’t
work out, it is not true, it does, but they

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.739
don't know how it works.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:23.349
So this pineal body within us was very active
when we were animal state.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:29.010
But when we raised our head, you see a chemical
change took place within ourselves in the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.909
sense that our brain started growing in a
pyramid, which I've told you how with the

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.819
parallelogram of forces and all that it has
started growing into a pyramid, and when it

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:48.079
became like that, you see because first it
was only the pineal body looking after the

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.900
super ego, up to the animal kingdom, up to
the kingdom were the animals sort of became

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.810
more sort of humanized, then the ego started
growing.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.159
[Unclear: In this part, we think Mother meant,
“it is only human beings that can use the

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.159
matter.”)

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.329
It's the only animals who can use the matter.

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.469
Human beings can use the matter, not the animals.

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.030
Animals cannot use the matter for their own
purpose.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.250
When they started aggressing the matter, the
ego started developing, and we developed this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.170
what you call “the pyramid of our brain”,
we starting growing, more and more and more

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.140
and more like this.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.780
But when it reached it's height, then we started
using our ego more we didn't stop at that

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.780
point.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.040
We started moving on the other side so this
went down and covered it covered it, completely

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.319
like that.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.680
That's why we say the pineal body in the human
beings doesn't work, it functions, no doubt,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680
it functions.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:51.090
As a result of that, you see when we saw this
ego was growing, as a result of that people

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.670
felt extremely over-confident.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.670
What's wrong?

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.500
business started long time back, since the
time of Columbus, as I've said if Columbus

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.389
had come to India, he would not have seen
Me here, he would have finished all the Indians

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.530
there, not him, he was a very nice man, but
those who followed him.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.189
In the same way, this ego started destroying
people, and they had an idea of a triumph,

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.680
and killing people, occupying lands, occupying
territories, accumulating wealth.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.140
Went on, and on, and on, and on, on this level.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.650
Then from there they started.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.080
When the marriage system started in a proper
way, again the aggression started on the women

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.840
and now the women are aggressing men, like
that, it's all became so aggressive.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.230
But when you are aggress you don't see that
you are aggressing, this is the problem of

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.479
the egoistical person.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.970
Though he may be a seeker, though he may be
a very genuine seeker, but if he is in the

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.789
area of ego, he never feels his own catches,
because the ego is in between, the reality

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:54.789
means that.

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.449
So he cannot see his own catches, he cannot
see how he is aggressing others, and he doesn't

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.740
see how he's hurting others, troubling others,
torturing others, and such a person can be

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:17.199
extremely arrogant, extremely what you call
the “strangulating”.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.449
This is what happens when you get cancer also,
when you get the cancer, what happens, it

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:24.970
starts with the left side no doubt.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:38.440
But when it comes into the person, then he
becomes a person who is vulnerable to a disease

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:44.410
or a disease where the person is aggressive.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:51.920
The cells of the body first develop the aggression;
we call it “malignant”.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.870
When this cell comes in contact with others
that also becomes malignant.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:03.600
So that's how the malignancy spreads, and
when it spreads what happens?

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.270
That supposing in the nose there are some
cells which become malignant; so they start

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:17.889
obstructing other organs to grow, the only
nose will grow like that not outside but inside.

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:24.750
So they aggress, you see, the aggression starts
and they lose complete control with the whole,

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.979
because there is no co-ordination with the
whole, they don't see that the whole has to

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.770
grow together, and not only the nose, and
not only the eyes, isn't it?

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:41.400
and this breaking from the collectivity is
the first sign when you find a Sahaja yogi

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.449
behaves in a funny way, that if he is breaking
from the collectivity, then he is nothing

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:53.599
but a egoist, no doubt about it; by any argument,
by anything.

00:06:53.599 --> 00:07:01.449
But a person who is a super ego fellow will
stick onto the collectivity; will try to be

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.750
very close to the ashram, he'll be very much
close to us very much here, around it, even

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.970
if we say “we don't want to”, it will
be there, why?

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:23.120
Because it realizes that it is aggressed and
also it realizes that it can be sly.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:30.520
So when a left-sided person enters into an
ashram, that person will be very nice, quiet,

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.030
sweet, everything.

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:39.250
But the entities, the bhoots in him, will
aggress the people slyly, they'll torture

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:48.750
but those people can be cured very easily,
because they are troubled and tortured themselves,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:54.560
but those who are egotistical will be very
difficult for them to get out it.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.189
That's why I've been talking about ego yesterday
and today.

00:07:57.189 --> 00:08:02.710
They can see all aggression, they manifest,
what's wrong?

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.389
Say now, I was talking about the chemicals.

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:08.419
Now, how did you discover these chemicals?

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:13.479
It is through your ego, through your science.

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:18.759
Now, if the science is not related to God
or to the whole, then you go like that, and

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:23.169
then you can produce hydrogen bombs, you can
produce these horrible chemicals, like it's

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.610
what you call “the fool-hardiness”.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:34.880
You enter into every area, every place and
achieve the power over that, but then you

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.110
don't know what that is capable of.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:45.330
Supposing now you make computers, supposes,
tomorrow these computers will eat you off.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:50.290
I must tell you now there's a new disease
I have discovered in people that their conscious

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:51.930
mind overpowers them.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:58.550
There was a fellow who was like this, very
egoistical, he didn't believe in God also.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.230
He's an Indian and he met with an accident.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.750
His wife is a doctor, she's a friend of Mine,
she brought him to Me.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.400
In My presence, he got up and walked off nicely,
everything.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.360
But on his own, whenever he wanted consciously
to do it, he couldn’t even raise his leg.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:15.360
Can you imagine?

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.090
So with these egoistical people now a new
disease is coming that consciously they cannot

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.290
do anything.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:32.050
They cannot do anything, in this will come,
I'm promising you now, or I'm warning you

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.050
now.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:37.890
As I warned the people who were going left-sided
that you will have a horrible disease and

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:42.050
this is the new disease for all the egoists
that consciously they won't be able to move,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:49.110
they'll be mute, sitting there only, their
ego will take over.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:53.280
It's a very dangerous era when you are born,
you must know.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:59.350
This is the time we are precariously placed
either you get to God or you go to Hell, there

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:01.350
is nothing is between.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:07.280
So a new disease will come very soon, there
is no insanity in it, nothing, you will be

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:16.330
quite alert, but you can't move your hands,
your whole nervous system refuses to work.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:22.210
That's going to come, very soon it will manifest.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:28.120
You have seen that egotistical people have
been going on like Hitler and all that, and

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.560
they have destroyed the world and they have
done so much harm to our value system.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:38.860
In subtle way we say that all this manifestation
of 25 years of all this horrible hell they

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:44.750
have created for us is because of the wars,
because of the wars.

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:55.080
But these wars and things even if you avoid
by some chance you avoid it, still if ego

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.680
is there it will manifest itself.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.490
If you avoid it outside it will manifest inside
and then you will find that you can't just

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.490
move.

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:13.070
You can't blink, you can't sleep, you can't
move your hands, even now people can't sleep,

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.980
many.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:23.700
And I don't want Sahaja yogis to suffer from
that horrible disease, and Western people

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:27.730
are more liable to that kind of a thing.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.210
The Sahaja yogis who are trying to get out
of the collectivity, who are asserting their

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:40.430
ego under the name of bhoots or whatever it
is, should understand that it is 99% it is

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:47.150
ego within us, and that ego has to be faced.

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:52.810
“Oh, I have a ego, I feel guilty”, then
alright you put it back here, [unclear: on

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:58.930
your ear], that's not the way.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:11:59.930
That's not the way you'll do it.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:06.050
Today you are very active, working very hard,
doing this, tomorrow fine you'll be just immobilized.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:15.750
You can't move and persons don't care in this
country as it is even for people who are alright,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.170
but you'll become like old people who cannot
move.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:26.570
Who see everything, know everything, who are
conscious, at a very young age this will happen,

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:31.980
the slightest accident, the slightest disturbance,
will just trigger off to that area where you

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:34.250
will be absolutely like a mute person sitting.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:39.010
You can't move your finger, you can't hold
anything.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.860
You will not be in a coma, coma happens to
people who take pills and things to go to

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.470
the left, like drugs and things which take
you to the left.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.490
But those who are right-sided you will not
be in coma, that’s one thing, is a curse,

00:12:52.490 --> 00:13:01.980
you’ll see everything, you'll be alert you
know everything but can't even turn your head.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.510
Take it from Me.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.630
That's coming, very soon.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:13.880
You may be talking, you may not be talking,
it can go to that level, slowly, slowly, you'll

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.380
find your body will be immobilized.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.580
People don't understand what dangers ego can
have.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:27.870
It is not now the aggression outside so much,
because it goes into left Vishuddhi, and this

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:37.440
left Vishuddhi will creates this horrible
disease.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.110
Now, how do we control our ego is very important
to understand.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:47.100
First of all you must write your names and
beat yourselves with shoes for 108 times to

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.380
begin with.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:56.300
Secondly discipline yourself, by disciplining,
get up in the morning, do your meditation,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.180
with right hand towards the photograph, left
hand this way.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.010
Not to use light at all, not to use sun don't
go to the sun at all.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:11.000
Sun is to be avoided, keep to the moon, read
the books which describes the Maha Kalis of

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:19.070
the left-side Shaktis, don't read the books
like Abbaduta book.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.700
You should never read it because you think
you are an Abbaduta I see, he said “I'm

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.870
omnipresent, I'm this thing”, the person
start feeing “I am this”.

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:33.950
I was reading the book of Abbaduta, I said
this book, this show what's gone wrong with

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.790
our incarnations.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:41.830
What's gone wrong with our incarnations is
they never knew human beings at all, at what

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:43.220
level they are.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:53.700
You come and tell them “I'm formless and
form, I'm this and that”, so what?

00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:00.040
If you are that, alright, I'm Compassion,
I'm Love, I'm Peace, I'm that ... so what?

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:07.010
How do you fill-in these cups, you have to
come down to a human level, that's what they

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:11.120
did not try, and that's why it's all a waste,
I think on the contrary.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:19.530
Everybody think I'm God, I'm Bramha, Shivo
Ham finished, and then they quarrel among

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:26.690
themselves, that growth, that maturity has
not come.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:31.320
It is very shallow, the whole thing become
very shallow, you become a shallow person,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:37.240
and you live with it, so the first thing practical
thing I'm telling you: beat yourself with

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:45.900
shoes and “I'm NOT this”, like that you
have to start first of all, telling yourself,

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:51.020
if you are a seeker, a truthful seeker, an
honest seeker, then I advise you this way,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:57.440
that you watch yourself in the mirror, and
tell yourself, “now you Mr Ego XYZ, will

00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:07.240
you get out from here, I know what I am, you
get out”, you have to get after all this

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:12.210
I mean, laugh at yourselves, smile at yourself,
make fun of yourself.

00:16:12.210 --> 00:16:18.250
That's the best, and never feel hurt, if anybody
says “you are egoistical”, and then you'll

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:30.880
say “I know, I know”, if you know you
are egotistical, then how do you go further?

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.060
Now ego manifest in so many ways.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:41.000
Through your eyes, through your ears, through
your mouth, through your nose, everyway, because

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.860
you go against God, that is you go against
collectivity, because you go against Shri

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.310
Krishna, against your Vishuddhi chakra.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:54.730
That's first thing it manifest, nowadays nobody
beats people like this, you see, we have become

00:16:54.730 --> 00:17:00.520
subtler in our ego manifestation; we use this
part, not hands.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:06.829
It can be that you show temper through your
eyes or it can be you flirt with your eyes.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:07.829
You become adulterous.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:09.730
That is why Christ has said “don't become
adulterous”.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:13.709
So now it is nice that the AIDS can work out
through the tears.

00:17:13.709 --> 00:17:15.319
It's good.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.519
Used to kiss people, alright, now kiss.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:20.949
Nobody will kiss now.

00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:25.730
You used all your Vishuddhi chakra so far
to express all filth.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.309
Now the filth is pouring out.

00:17:30.309 --> 00:17:36.600
So, in the second stage when we understand
that it is through the Vishuddhi that is this

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.789
America we express ourselves, our ego, so
what should we do?

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:49.549
First of all, stop talking, here the way the
people talk, I mean you see, you have just

00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:55.000
start opening your mouth like this and like
that, you go on and the other is talking,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.950
just you tell them something, they just come
on with all the knowledge they have known

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:04.100
everything, A to Z, and you don't know where
you are.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:09.799
How do you stop talking?, I've told you a
practical thing, I'll get you beetle nuts,

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:16.059
which I'll vibrate, put it in mouth, and you
take it out when you have to talk otherwise

00:18:16.059 --> 00:18:22.230
keep it there, that's Shri Ganesha, don't
take it out.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.870
Stop talking.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.520
If you stop talking, your hypocrisy will go
away.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:35.250
It's through our face we are hypocritical,
everything works out through Vishuddhi.

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:41.960
Now see, a person who is extremely aggressive
you see can also act to be very, very sweet

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.379
you see, if they have to exploit you or make
money out of you.

00:18:46.379 --> 00:18:52.169
They can act, acting; the whole acting comes
through this Vishuddhi.

00:18:52.169 --> 00:18:59.830
Then you act, “you are a very gentle person,
you are very good”, but you are not, you

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.160
are aggressive.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:12.860
So for that you have to know that talking
less will reduce 50% of your hypocrisy and

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.860
acting, 50%.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:21.769
Now 50% still left, now what to do with the
50%?

00:19:21.769 --> 00:19:32.659
50% is a thing where we have to know what
other chakras are responsible for ego manifestation.

00:19:32.659 --> 00:19:38.299
Is one is the Hamsa, is very important Hamsa
is.

00:19:38.299 --> 00:19:46.519
We use when we want to show our temper, indifference.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:55.510
Then a person thinks “Oh God, what have
I done to this person?”

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.379
That's how we show our temper, all the time
like this.

00:19:59.379 --> 00:20:10.260
That's Hamsa and that's why we have to use
what we call the simple thing called ghee

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:20.340
or something oilish for ears, for nose, for
eyes the kajal and for this portion also.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:28.409
We have to put some ghee in hot water or milk
and take it so that you sooth down your nerves

00:20:28.409 --> 00:20:35.990
and you smooth down your Vishuddhi and also
you sooth down the what you call in a general

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.840
way is the peritoneum but is the lining.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.860
Lining as we sooth down our fingers and hands
when they are dried, we have to sooth them.

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.700
Rub ghee here, ghee here, oil here, oil there,
in the head.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:58.950
Now, the modern style is not to put oil in
the head, you'll become balds.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:06.769
Balded gentleman, of course you can still
act like Yull Brinner, but he died of cancer.

00:21:06.769 --> 00:21:17.990
His sister is our disciple, and you will develop
funny hair styles everything and of this modern

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.590
fashion has started don't put any oil, I don't
know from it has come.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.450
The children also they say “don't put any
oil in the ears”, this is doctors, they

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:31.960
want to create patients, don't listen to them.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:38.539
Before going traveling or anywhere, put oil
in your ears, into your noses not the oil

00:21:38.539 --> 00:21:45.779
but ghee, and control your peritoneum through
your Hamsa chakra, is very important.

00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:53.120
This is the chakra which really helps you
very much to soothe down.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:22:00.820
Now in Sanskrit and also in many colloquial
languages, ghee is called as “mir”, and

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.970
sneha is love.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:08.249
Neha also is love.

00:22:08.249 --> 00:22:12.509
So you have to oil it down, so the frictions
are less.

00:22:12.509 --> 00:22:17.120
We know in nature, when we have the reduce
friction, we put oil.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:23.910
Like we have to say launch a ship, I've launched
I know what it is, they had to put grease

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:32.270
on the thing, and it just touched the ship
and the ship moves, so smoothly onto the sea.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.930
Beautifully it moves.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:40.370
In India they put bananas, because bananas
is a very easily available, so they put bananas

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:41.759
you see under.

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:45.960
Here they use grease, in England for example
they use grease.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.529
In the same way, we have to grease ourselves.

00:22:49.529 --> 00:22:57.370
Our language, our tone, our speaking must
be greased, greased with love and love is

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:06.940
such a powerful thing that can attract any
one let it be even Hitler.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:15.399
When you talk to someone or say something,
it should have that coating of chocolate of

00:23:15.399 --> 00:23:22.700
Love, then you can give even give castor oil,
I do that.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:31.249
So, all these things are to be understood
[Vedas] says that we should not become stupid

00:23:31.249 --> 00:23:33.169
as the other people are.

00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:43.480
We are yogis and we have to have a ideal life
which manifest itself in all kinds of dynamism

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:51.090
and we do not waste this great blessing that
we have got.

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:58.980
Now with this another chakra which is always
caught is the Agnya, Agnya chakra.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:04.390
In the Agnya chakra we have to become thoughtlessly
aware but we can't.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:12.600
Now if you watch your thoughts you will know
mostly we think of the people who have harmed,

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:17.450
who have troubled us, sometimes we have the
glimpse of the good things also.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:22.640
We think of the good people also, sometimes,
normally we are thinking about the people

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.429
who have harmed us, hurt us, this thing, that.

00:24:25.429 --> 00:24:31.980
Now, Christ who is Shri Ganesha and who has
all the powers to kill us and to finish us

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:39.769
off and destroy us completely has given us
the greatest weapon, is to forgive.

00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:49.020
So the mantra here is “forgive” and you
have to see that you forgive others.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:53.140
Anybody says anything, forgive.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:56.840
When you forgive, God takes over.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:03.789
And He knows how to handle or mishandle, to
do whatever He likes to that person.

00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:09.909
That's not your job, you just forgive, so
you give him a ticket, go to God, I forgive

00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:21.799
you, and you have to forgive and that is the
thing you can enjoy your Agnya chakra very

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:28.140
well, and raise your Kundalini beyond by saying
“forgive, forgive, forgive”, three times,

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:32.149
and you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara,
no thoughts.

00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:38.590
Agnya is the one that brings thoughts to you,
that's why Christ was so particular on the

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:43.460
eyes, that “thou shall not have adulterous
eyes”, try to concentrate your eyes on the

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:49.860
mother Earth for some time, she'll suck in,
so that your attention doesn't become that

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:55.019
wobbly, becomes concentrated, and equalized
and balanced.

00:25:55.019 --> 00:26:01.890
When that is done your eyes become so powerful
even if you look at somebody, you can cure

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:07.050
that person and the innocence will start coming
in your eyes, you will not have lust and greed.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:11.330
It is a very dangerous thing people are playing
here, I mean, I didn’t know all these things

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:17.019
people do but I saw it in the West, I mean,
everybody is looking at every girl, what is

00:26:17.019 --> 00:26:18.220
the joyless pursuit?

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.419
Why, turn your eyes to anything that you don't
enjoy at all.

00:26:23.419 --> 00:26:27.659
At every girl a man is looking, a girl is
looking at every man, what's this nonsense?

00:26:27.659 --> 00:26:29.220
Why waste your energy.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:34.710
I always look at about 3 feet height, you
see all the flowers there, you see all the

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.130
children.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.750
One day somebody asked Me, “don't you feel
like looking at handsome men”?

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:48.600
I said “I'm not a fool, I look at the most
handsome things, at 3 feet level”.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.710
He said, you must be a fool to look at this.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.179
I'm not, that is what it is.

00:26:55.179 --> 00:27:02.070
So that will give you tremendous amount of
energy, because you preserve all your energy

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.070
through your eyes.

00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:08.010
Eyes are the windows of that Power.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:14.090
If you try to preserve it, it's alright, otherwise
like now they say “save water, because you've

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:18.650
wasted your water, so now save water”.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:27.320
But when your eyes are innocent in this shower
of bliss, you enjoy that bliss, you don't

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:32.159
have to look at anyone, you don't have to
say anything, you just enjoy, just feel the

00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:36.019
joy pouring into you completely.

00:27:36.019 --> 00:27:41.250
Because the ego has vanished, you see it is
an aggression to look at everyone like that,

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.250
it's an aggression.

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:48.049
I've known people who mesmerize women, who
mesmerize men, I've known women like that,

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:52.279
I've seen in the parties, I've seen the bhoots
coming out of these women, and they look at

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:58.529
the man and he gets transfixed, completely,
falls in love with that woman, till he becomes

00:27:58.529 --> 00:28:01.610
like a beggar, she just lynches him.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:08.120
It is prostitution, by men or women, it's
a horrible thing, it is dirt in your eyes,

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.630
so keep your eyes steady, try to steady them,
if they try to go here and there tell them,

00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:17.440
you say “look there, there's the mother
Earth, she's the one that gives us all beautiful

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:24.499
things, look at that” and then the beauty
of that mother Earth will come into your eyes.

00:28:24.499 --> 00:28:34.280
And the cleanliness and the innocence will
cleanse others, that's how it should be.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:42.580
So to fight this ego one has to be prepared
and must have proper will power, because ego

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.899
kills the will power of man, completely.

00:28:45.899 --> 00:28:49.770
A man who is an egoist is left with no will
power.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:53.250
It does what the ego tells him to.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:29:02.610
It can murder people, it can be violent, all
the violence in America is from the ego manifestation.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:10.460
Because there is no respect of the law, not
of human laws, but not of God's law also,

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:14.749
that's how people behave, that how they incur
diseases, a horrible things.

00:29:14.749 --> 00:29:23.039
A person who is not egotistical will not get
cancer.

00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:27.269
You have to be egotistical to get cancer,
though it is a left-sided thing, but you have

00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:34.570
to have ego, vulnerability comes through ego
and then it acts.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:44.440
If you are egoistical, you are vulnerable
to cancer so first thing if you survive from

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:54.610
say cancer, you'll have the other one waiting,
where you'll be transfixed by bhoots.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:59.130
You will become like some of the things I
see on TV, where people are given some sort

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:06.610
of artificial thing and they are just nothing
but machines and they move their hands like

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:11.580
machines, they walk like this, they look like
human being, and they walk straight like this,

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:19.249
they can't feel anything, like that you'll
become, because ego takes you away from emotions

00:30:19.249 --> 00:30:23.771
and away from the left side and you become
really a person like a machine, you become

00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:24.771
like a machine.

00:30:24.771 --> 00:30:33.489
I met one dentist, he came to Me, he said
to me “Mother, now I cannot apply, I cannot

00:30:33.489 --> 00:30:38.700
feel and I do not feel bad when somebody dies”.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:48.739
I said “so what do you do?”, “I jog”,
I mean jog means running away from yourself.

00:30:48.739 --> 00:30:51.539
Jog for how many hours?

00:30:51.539 --> 00:30:59.600
“5 hours”, out of the 10 hours he’s
awake, he is away 5 hours, he jogs, what else

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.159
will happen?

00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:07.700
So all these artificial things have come to
us because is a manifestation of somebody's

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:14.870
ego, even drugs came to us because somebody
wanted to make money out of us.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:20.470
All these gurus they wanted to make money
out of us, you see they are more interested

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:25.609
in making money, all egotistical people are
very money oriented, they can't get out of

00:31:25.609 --> 00:31:28.450
it, any amount of money you give them.

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:33.639
Whatever I mean I have blessed people with
thousands and thousands of rupees, billion

00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:39.799
and billions of things, but still their money
orientation doesn't go and then they lose

00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:47.390
it in no time, they lose just like that, just
like that, Naturally, because they do not

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:54.140
recognize that it is a blessing one has got
it, now you have to share it.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:32:03.529
I mean, actually coming to Sahaja Yoga there
was one gentleman who was really absolutely

00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:11.119
on the verge of collapsing without any money,
he has become such a rich man overnight and

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:13.450
overnight again he become the same.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:21.489
Is an example, he came to Me, came to Sahaja
Yoga, he became very rich, became all this,

00:32:21.489 --> 00:32:25.789
and then suddenly he lost everything, and
even Sahaja Yogis started saying “Mother,

00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:31.429
we come to You for a short time” and then
they go away and they become very rich, I

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:38.859
said, alright:, and then see afterwards one
year, before and after, where are they now?

00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:50.429
This man has become so poor that he doesn't
even have money to take a bus, so the calamities

00:32:50.429 --> 00:32:55.360
come in like that and then they don't understand,
but I'm telling you unless and until you talk

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:59.309
of calamities, people don't learn, they need
a shock, otherwise they don't want to get

00:32:59.309 --> 00:33:04.399
out of their egos, they cannot, they live
with it, they don't want to understand that

00:33:04.399 --> 00:33:09.159
this is going to happen, then they'd better
do it, when they see it happening.

00:33:09.159 --> 00:33:16.820
This case, one case of one gentleman has brought
forth before all the Indian Sahaja yogis a

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.279
very big lesson.

00:33:18.279 --> 00:33:23.409
They were saying that “you should come to
Sahaja Yoga for short time and get out of

00:33:23.409 --> 00:33:27.780
it, then you'll become very rich”, this
is what they have reached their conclusion

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:38.679
and now they don't say so, because the medium
through which you have got God's grace, if

00:33:38.679 --> 00:33:41.769
it is lost, you have lost it.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:49.289
So don't live with full confidence with that
horrible ego of yours, it is going to overpower

00:33:49.289 --> 00:33:51.350
you.

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:55.600
And as you've seen the bhoots combine, also
egotistical people will always combine.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.739
They are two egoists, they will always be
very friendly, because they combined together

00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:08.560
they are just the same, but when they are
immobilized then what is going to happen?

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:14.300
They were sitting like statues, you can make
statues out of them I think, what will be

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.660
the next [unclear: state?]

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:22.770
I do not know, because they are not dead,
they are living, but they can't eat food,

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:31.500
they can look at food, they can't eat it,
but if you put injection in [unclear] because

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:38.050
the parasympathetic might be working or maybe
sympathetic might be working, the autonomous

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:40.280
might be working but the rest of it is finished.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.650
The central nervous system is finished.

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.600
It can happen suddenly to someone.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:58.000
Write it down, today I have told you about
this disease.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:06.640
Try to keep to the group, try to share everything
and don't try your cunning clever methods.

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.691
Cunningness is cheating yourself, Gregoire
has told Me “Mother this intelligence, human

00:35:10.691 --> 00:35:15.580
intelligence is so intelligent it can cheat
yourself”.

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:19.370
That's what I see.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:26.830
Why do you want to cheat yourself, are you
mad?

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:32.070
This is what one has to realize, once you
understand that, you'll see most of the problems

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.220
of this world will subside.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.400
How do you have atom bomb, how do you have
all these things?

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.240
Science never said “you make atom bomb”,
science was given to you for constructive

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:50.120
work, for saving time for meditation, not
to make atomic bombs to kill you, no, but

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:57.470
in a way it acts because America makes some
bombs, Russia makes some bombs, like two,

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:03.560
they'll be sitting on their heads, now they
cannot put their hands to the buttons.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:12.160
Is a good idea, they are afraid of the devils
they have created themselves, see that's what

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:21.880
because it is so over-powering, so if you
want to avoid your own destruction, then beware,

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:34.390
be aware of yourself, not to boast, that “I
know, I know”, no, how you behave?

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:44.240
Some people are such that they say “we can't
live in an ordinary place, we cannot sleep

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.870
in an ordinary place and all that”, that
means they are beggars, that is what I feel

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:55.720
about such people, because if you are the
king like I am the Queen I should say, I don't

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.560
want anything, you make me sleep under this
tree, I can sleep, I can sleep anywhere, I

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:05.141
can live the way I like, and you know I live
in a palace, actually a palace, so what, that

00:37:05.141 --> 00:37:10.850
palace is not important to Me, wherever I
go I make it a palace for Myself, because

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:18.890
I'm not bothered about comforts, no comfort
can crawl up on Me, nothing dominate can Me,

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:29.100
nothing can come over Me, nothing is important
to Me, because I'm the Queen, if I'm the beggar

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:38.000
then I want comfort, I want this, I want that,
there is no want left.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:48.430
Nothing wanted, in that state when you arrive
then you'll enjoy Sahaja Yoga, your spirit,

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:52.480
and that's what happens when people come to
India.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:38:00.880
I was amazed to see these people who came,
first time they came we spent 40,000 dollars

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:14.490
and 5 Americans came here, 4 or 5, 4 and 1
Canadian, so 5 and 4 ran away, imagine how

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:22.470
expensive that, 4 ran away, we tried, they
came to see Me and all that, “No, Mother

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:26.570
we can't stand this [unclear: discomfort],
we cannot stand this discomfort”, what comfort

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:31.090
do you want here?, I don't see any comfort,
horrible since I've come to this, you can

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:38.660
see my head, I've been sick in this horrible
place, what comforts you have?

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.680
And there they were boasting so much, they
ran away.

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:51.680
So, all you understand that those people who
are asking for things all the time, begging

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:57.370
for things have not achieved anything in life.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:01.170
Now when you are coming this time to India
we are going to have a much more Spartan life

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:09.220
because we are not going to be stay in any
building whatsoever, as far as possible except

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:16.060
in Rowdy, maybe there also, we are going to
put you up in the pendalls outside, absolutely

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:29.190
in the forest, where there will be tigers
they will be snakes, crawling up you, and

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:40.730
you’ll have to have baths in the river which
are flowing in at a big speed.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:51.710
And then also you will have their beautiful
music of the morning birds and beautiful fragrance,

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:55.050
it’s so beautiful and soothing.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:40:09.630
There where grows the essence of life and
that's what we have decided, I mean, I can

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:12.830
live there, why can't you live?

00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:28.640
I can't understand, what is so special about
it, I'm an old woman now 63 years of age,

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:37.380
and all my life my father or my husband are
being extremely over-comfortable people, I

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.310
mean luxurious people.

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:46.310
I mean I have never known how to take a taxi
or take a bus all my life, I've never known

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:53.320
how to take a ticket to go by train, I've
never traveled by air alone, I mean, I don't

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:59.990
know how to travel by air alone, I mean, I've
always been like that, but I don't need anything,

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:05.560
I can travel alone, I can go anywhere, I can
do everything without feeling any fear, without

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:12.100
feeling any problems because as long I'm with
myself, what is there to worry?

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:18.350
And that’s what we have to achieve, that
is what we have to do.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:23.260
Once we achieve that kind of a temperament,
is so beautiful, you'll respect yourself,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.220
you'll love yourself, and that's how we love
others and respect others, those that don't

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:30.590
respect themselves cannot respect.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:34.760
Egotistical people do not respect themselves,
if they respect themselves they would not

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.370
be egotistical, but it is so shameful to be
egotistical.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:43.710
If you say “you are very egotistical”
that person will punch you, even if you say

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.840
something else, they won't, will they?

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:53.640
But is you say “you are egoistical”, they'll
punch you that means they feel hurt, if they

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.030
don't like why do they have it?

00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:04.220
It's a very difficult thing to move that ego
from your heads, and you catch from one to

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:08.380
the other so fast that sometimes I don't understand.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.620
But Indian climate and Indian up-bringing
is such, people don't get egotistical, I have

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.510
not known of anyone who is today good and
tomorrow standing with a punch, I've not seen

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:22.770
anyone like that in India, very steady people,
now see here is sitting somebody a doctor

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:26.300
and he missed his Nobel prize, a man like
that.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.882
Can you believe that such a man is sitting
here?

00:42:28.882 --> 00:42:32.110
He's another one.

00:42:32.110 --> 00:42:37.400
You won't find this with anyone in India behaving
like that, they have ego, very subtle egos,

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:45.580
bureaucrats have I must say, and other politicians
have, [watch: Mother corrects India to abroad

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:48.770
very quickly here] but till they come to abroad
then they get even worse.

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:57.540
But normally a person's status is known the
way he is humble in India, otherwise they

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:03.710
don't believe you are from a royal family,
you are from a royal family you are extremely

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:10.580
humble, that the sign, like the [unclear:
shesha].

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.120
I talked to her five sentences as I said and
she said “this lady is very honorable, from

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:21.610
a royal family, must be” I am, but I mean,
I am, but I mean I've never told her, which

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:30.830
is not known to many people, but she said
“She must be from a royal family”.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:35.600
What is the need to insult others, what is
the need to shout at others and talk in that

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.600
manner?

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:43.650
There is no need, you must talk in a way that
is sweet and nice, it looks nice, it shows

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:44.650
better.

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:52.280
Your personality is better seen by others,
at least for the sake of congenial concord

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:59.880
with others please try to get over your nonsensical
ego.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:11.260
It keeps you out of bounds for the joy, the
ocean of joy that you have to have.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:17.210
You are a miserable creature for nothing at
all, making everybody miserable.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:22.550
But face it, face it, don't put it in your
left Vishuddhi, “Oh, I'm egotistical, I'm

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:27.300
very unhappy”, you're finished, I cannot
cure that, I'm already suffering you see,

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.320
all the time I get pain here, pain here, I
don’t know what to do, since I've come to

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:36.190
West I've developed a problem here because
all of you have in this left Vishuddhi and

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.920
I've put you inside My body.

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:46.190
You don't know how much you make Me suffer,
though I don't mind, I can see that.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:54.490
I have to request you now to you look after
yourself and behave in a manner that this

00:44:54.490 --> 00:45:02.950
American ego disappears because there's another
way out that is Shri Krishna's time which

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.910
I don't want to use just now.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:16.400
The first destruction will start in America
then construction will start.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.100
Destruction is impossible, the clouds of destruction
will disappear, completely disappear, the

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:28.720
cool wind will blow it out, but you have to
be of sincerity and of understanding, without

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:35.550
any ego, that's your responsibility, for your
children, for your progeny, for your country,

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:38.880
it is your responsibility.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.420
Good?

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:46.560
May God Bless you.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:56.290
So now I'll be going for the another stride
and in the evening I may not meet you again.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:46:06.120
But I hope you people will now give the full
list of the people who want to marry.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:12.260
Those who have not yet decided, should decide,
even if you are not decided on people, give

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:19.710
me the list of the people who want to get
married in India, if not this year, then next

00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:26.570
year, something like that, all of you should
give your names, those who want to marry that

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:32.850
is very important because it is impossible
to do it without getting everyone there, that's

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.520
one point is.

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:39.910
Secondly we should decide how many are going,
how they are going, and all these things are

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:46.700
to be done in a proper systematic way and
Babet must be informed about it, everybody

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:50.460
should say that so many are going from Los
Angeles this way, they are going from this

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:54.960
way and Babet should be able to organize it,
there should be no competition, nothing.

00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:00.010
And you should see to it that you get the
cheapest price.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:10.970
But not at the cost of disturbing yourself,
whatever you can get easily, just get it,

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:12.810
that's not so important.

00:47:12.810 --> 00:47:19.700
The third point I've said that there is no
need for you to bring too much of luggage

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:26.061
especially for ladies, there is no need to
bring any make-ups or anything in India, no

00:47:26.061 --> 00:47:32.850
need at all it's a country where your skin
improves by itself, you don't have to do much

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:38.580
make-up or anything it's very smooth country,
where your skin nourishes itself, and you'll

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:43.250
feel very nice and even if you have to buy
you can buy, you can buy them in India which

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:47.920
are made out of not any chemicals or anything,
but natural things you see.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.300
Even for toothpaste and all that, it is better
to use Indian toothpaste I think, so I think

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:57.830
now I've reached that conclusion, all these
horrible toothpaste here things are what chemicals

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:03.090
they have I don't know what will happen to
the teeth, so far my teeth are intact, I've

00:48:03.090 --> 00:48:10.950
never been to a dentist, but I feel, I feel
there are full of horrible chemicals in it.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:16.250
So don't spoil your skin with these horrible
make-ups and things like that, I mean to find

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:20.880
a proper shampoo here, I find it impossible
because sometimes maybe some shampoos can

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:29.500
just take out your hair like that, you see,
so try to acquire habits which are simple,

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:37.340
natural habits in a living not primitive,
again I say not primitive, but not very elaborate

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:42.290
and don't pay so much attention to your body
as you do, there is no need to pay, it is

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:46.740
alright whatever God has given it a body,
it's alright, you don't have worry too much

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:47.740
about it.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:53.290
To do some little exercises in the morning,
or something, do your meditation properly,

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:58.580
be normal people, you don't have to overdo
anything, little bit is alright, but just

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.060
keep in the center, don't go to extremes in
anything.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:06.720
Now you have to be bring a sweater and things
like that and as I told you a proper bedding

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.210
as I told that you have to bring.

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:14.690
Now, in India they will supply you with sheets
and everything, with nice cotton sheets, because

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:21.800
you must use as far as possible cotton and
as far as possible silks, or cotton natural

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:26.680
things, not artificial things like you'll
get into trouble if you use plastics and things

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:35.190
like that, so as far as possible try not to
bring many clothes because we can get you

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:36.190
everything.

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:46.010
Now, to come to the practical side of it I
would like to have all the what you call,

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:52.700
sizes, written down properly but make them
into 4 sizes.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:50:01.470
You sort it out, you can do it, put them into
4 sizes, for kurtas, and for ladies' also

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:11.530
blouses into 4 sizes so you make 4 sizes,
A, B, C, D sizes for men and women, and we

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:13.940
keep that ready for you when you come.

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:19.230
Imagine how much these Indians work for it
and how much do I donate, that's all donation

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:24.150
whatever I give, what remains the money is
so little and they are now going to donate

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:31.590
so much money for your school, for your children,
imagine that Indians should do it, it's not

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:33.270
very good.

00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:40.040
We have such a little money to be very frank
which has been given that I really feel shy

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:45.370
to take that money to India so I've kept it
now with Arneau, every money is kept there,

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:49.550
that you keep it there, but if you have to
have a school we have to a good school and

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:55.980
for that we need money but just now you don't
think of donating anything, because though

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.340
you are rich people you are incapable of donations
now.

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:03.560
II can see that clearly, because you have
to travel, you have to spend money on your

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.630
travels, Indians don't have to do that, so
it's alright but whatever they have said a

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:13.370
little amount for donations that much you
give them.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:19.010
And you come there with love, but people come
back like traders I tell you really like traders,

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:25.580
because India is a place where one can buy
lots of things, you like everything “you

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.470
want buy this, you want to buy that” that's
not good.

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:34.589
Buy a few things of symbolic value, whatever
you need you should buy, you cannot bring

00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:40.180
all the things that you need from India, but
people when they travel like that it is very

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:47.310
shameful I think people sometimes don't understand
how yogis have to carry so many things, now

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:55.570
you should carry things which are useful to
you, which are good for you but not too much.
