WEBVTT

00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:04.167
About Sahaja culture, alright.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:11.434
Sahaja culture I explained to you what is a Sahaja culture is, in which you have grow

00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:18.901
then last night, where's Judy, she's there, come in, come in, let them sit, now].

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:24.801
Then last night I talked to you about ego.

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:35.267
That how ego manifests itself and how it is difficult to get out of the ego.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:40.767
It's easy to get out of the conditionings super egos, but very difficult to get out of ego

00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:44.667
because ego aggresses others, doesn't trouble you at all.

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:46.801
And you enjoy that aggression,

00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:49.767
See now.

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:53.901
Today I want to tell you about how ego has been

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.100
historically, traditionally torturing people around.

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:03.434
So you'll see the manifestation of this ego, and then you will know that

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:07.801
if you are playing anything any role with your ego,

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:12.133
you could be part and parcel of that destructive force.

00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:18.734
So to begin with we'll see now, when this ego started growing in man.

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:27.467
First of all see, it started growing with the protection,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.467
so

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:55.067
the pituitary, which is within us, started growing when we raised our head, like this.

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.701
When we were animals, our head were like this,

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:03.934
at that time the pineal body as it is called, was very powerful.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:08.667
They say in human beings the pineal doesn’t work out, it is not true, it does.

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:13.501
But they don't know how it works.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:23.334
So this pineal body within us, was very active when we were animal state.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.567
But when we raised our head, you see a chemical change took place within ourselves

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:32.801
in the sense that our brain started growing in a pyramid,

00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:37.601
which I've told you how with the parallelogram of forces and all that it has started growing

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:43.000
into a pyramid, and when it became like that, you see

00:02:43.067 --> 00:02:49.367
because first it was only the pineal body looking after the super ego,

00:02:49.434 --> 00:02:52.334
up to the animal kingdom, up to the kingdom where

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:55.567
the animals sort of became more sort of humanized,

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:58.734
then the ego started growing.

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:01.534
It's the only animals who can use the matter.

00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:04.067
Human beings can use the matter, not the animals.

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:06.968
Animals cannot use the matter for their own purpose.

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:11.100
When they started aggressing the matter, the ego started developing,

00:03:11.167 --> 00:03:16.000
and we developed this what you call “the pyramid of our brain”,

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:20.834
we starting growing, more and more and more and more like this.

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:28.300
But when it reached it's height, then we started using our ego more we didn't stop at that point.

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.901
We started moving on the other side

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
so this went down and covered it covered it, completely like that.

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:39.334
That's why we say the pineal body in the human beings doesn't work,

00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:41.434
it functions, no doubt, it functions.

00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:48.300
As a result of that, you see when we saw this ego was growing,

00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:53.200
as a result of that people felt extremely over-confident.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.434
What's wrong?

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:58.234
business started long time back, since the time of Columbus, as I've said

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.234
if Columbus had come to India, he would not have seen Me here,

00:04:01.334 --> 00:04:03.334
he would have finished all the Indians there.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.300
Not him, he was a very nice man, but those who followed him.

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:10.267
In the same way, this ego started destroying people,

00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:13.834
and they had an idea of a triumph, and killing people,

00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:18.467
occupying lands, occupying territories, accumulating wealth.

00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:22.000
Went on, and on, and on, and on, on this level.

00:04:22.067 --> 00:04:24.300
Then from there they started.

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:27.334
When the marriage system started in a proper way,

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.934
again the aggression started on the women

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.667
and now the women are aggressing men, like that, it's all became so aggressive.

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:37.801
But when you are aggress you don't see that you are aggressing,

00:04:37.868 --> 00:04:40.434
this is the problem of the egoistical person.

00:04:40.534 --> 00:04:46.367
Though he may be a seeker, though he may be a very genuine seeker, but

00:04:46.434 --> 00:04:51.801
if he is in the area of ego, he never feels his own catches,

00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:55.000
because the ego is in between, the reality means that.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.133
So he cannot see his own catches, he cannot see how he is aggressing others,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.567
and he doesn't see how he's hurting others, troubling others, torturing others,

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:16.868
and such a person can be extremely arrogant, extremely what you call the “strangulating”.

00:05:16.968 --> 00:05:20.934
This is what happens when you get cancer also.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.934
When you get the cancer, what happens, it starts with the left side no doubt.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:31.434
But when it comes into the person, then he becomes

00:05:31.534 --> 00:05:45.400
a person who is vulnerable to a disease or a disease where the person is aggressive.

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:51.534
The cells of the body first develop the aggression; we call it “malignant”.

00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:58.167
When this cell comes in contact with others that also becomes malignant.

00:05:58.234 --> 00:06:03.367
So that's how the malignancy spreads, and when it spreads what happens?

00:06:03.434 --> 00:06:07.434
That supposing in the nose there are some cells which become malignant.

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:14.200
So they start obstructing other organs to grow, the only nose will grow like that.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.567
Not outside but inside.

00:06:17.634 --> 00:06:22.434
So they aggress, you see, the aggression starts and

00:06:22.501 --> 00:06:24.701
they lose complete control with the whole,

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.167
because there is no co-ordination with the whole, they don't see that

00:06:28.234 --> 00:06:33.367
the whole has to grow together, and not only the nose, and not only the eyes, isn't it?

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:38.634
and this breaking from the collectivity is the first sign

00:06:38.701 --> 00:06:43.033
when you find a Sahaja yogi behaves in a funny way,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.868
that if he is breaking from the collectivity,

00:06:45.934 --> 00:06:53.801
then he is nothing but a egoist, no doubt about it; by any argument, by anything.

00:06:53.901 --> 00:07:00.200
But a person who is a super ego fellow will stick onto the collectivity;

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.100
will try to be very close to the ashram, he'll be very much close to us very much here,

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.968
around it, even if we say “we don't want to”, it will be there, why?

00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:22.968
Because it realizes that it is aggressed and also it realizes that it can be sly.

00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:26.934
So when a left-sided person enters into an ashram,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.667
that person will be very nice, quiet, sweet, everything.

00:07:32.767 --> 00:07:40.634
But the entities, the bhoots in him, will aggress the people slyly, they'll torture

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.701
but those people can be cured very easily,

00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:48.501
because they are troubled and tortured themselves.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:54.200
But those who are egotistical will be very difficult for them to get out it.

00:07:54.267 --> 00:07:57.400
That's why I've been talking about ego yesterday and today.

00:07:57.467 --> 00:08:02.467
They can see all aggression, they manifest, what's wrong?

00:08:02.534 --> 00:08:05.567
Say now, I was talking about the chemicals.

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:09.400
Now, how did you discover these chemicals?

00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:13.667
It is through your ego, through your science.

00:08:13.734 --> 00:08:18.167
Now, if the science is not related to God or to the whole, then you go like that,

00:08:18.234 --> 00:08:22.334
and then you can produce hydrogen bombs, you can produce these horrible chemicals,

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:26.601
like it's what you call “the fool-hardiness”.
You enter into every area,

00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:33.567
every place and achieve the power over that,

00:08:33.667 --> 00:08:36.868
I think you don't know what that is capable of.

00:08:36.934 --> 00:08:40.834
Supposing now you make computers, supposing,

00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:45.100
tomorrow these computers will eat you off.

00:08:45.167 --> 00:08:49.100
I must tell you now there's a new disease I have discovered in people

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:52.767
that their conscious mind overpowers them.

00:08:54.234 --> 00:08:59.234
There was a fellow who was like this, very egoistical, he didn't believe in God also.

00:08:59.334 --> 00:09:01.701
He's an Indian and he met with an accident.

00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:05.501
His wife is a doctor, she's a friend of Mine, she brought him to Me.

00:09:05.601 --> 00:09:09.501
In My presence, he got up and walked off nicely, everything.

00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:14.133
But on his own, whenever he wanted consciously to do it, he couldn’t even raise his leg.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.367
Can you imagine?

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:19.968
So with these egoistical people now a new disease is coming

00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:23.701
that consciously they cannot do anything.

00:09:25.133 --> 00:09:32.200
They cannot do anything, in this will come, I'm promising you now, or I'm warning you now.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.434
As I warned the people who were going left-sided that you will have a horrible disease

00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:40.067
and this is the new disease for all the egoists

00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:43.300
that consciously they won't be able to move, they'll be mute,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.300
sitting there only, their ego will take over.

00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:53.901
It's a very dangerous era when you are born, you must know.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:56.400
This is the time we are precariously placed:

00:09:56.467 --> 00:10:01.100
either you get to God or you go to Hell, there is nothing is between.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.100
So a new disease will come very soon, there is no insanity in it,

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:09.968
nothing, you will be quite alert, but you can't move your hands,

00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:14.367
your whole nervous system refuses to work.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.234
That's going to come, very soon it will manifest.

00:10:21.968 --> 00:10:25.434
You have seen that egotistical people

00:10:25.534 --> 00:10:29.968
have been going on like Hitler and all that, and they have destroyed the world

00:10:30.067 --> 00:10:32.801
and they have done so much harm to our value system.

00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:37.801
In subtle way we say that all this manifestation of 25 years

00:10:37.868 --> 00:10:43.033
of all this horrible hell they have created for us is because of the wars,

00:10:43.133 --> 00:10:44.501
because of the wars.

00:10:44.601 --> 00:10:53.367
But these wars and things even if you avoid by some chance you avoid it,

00:10:53.434 --> 00:10:58.434
still if ego is there it will manifest itself.

00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:04.767
If you avoid it outside it will manifest inside
and then you will find that you can't just move.

00:11:04.868 --> 00:11:08.200
You can't blink, you can't sleep,

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:14.734
you can't move your hands, even now people can't sleep, many.

00:11:14.801 --> 00:11:20.067
And I don't want Sahaja yogis to suffer from that horrible disease,

00:11:21.701 --> 00:11:27.501
and Western people are more liable to that kind of a thing.

00:11:27.567 --> 00:11:30.834
The Sahaja yogis who are trying to get out of the collectivity,

00:11:30.934 --> 00:11:34.701
who are asserting their ego under the name of bhoots or whatever it is,

00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:42.367
should understand that it is 99% it is ego within us.

00:11:44.601 --> 00:11:48.000
And that ego has to be faced.

00:11:48.067 --> 00:11:50.467
“Oh, I have a ego, I feel guilty”,

00:11:50.534 --> 00:11:56.267
then alright you put it back here, [unclear: on your ear], that's not the way.

00:11:58.133 --> 00:12:00.067
That's not the way you'll do it.

00:12:00.167 --> 00:12:03.133
Today you are very active, working very hard, doing this,

00:12:03.234 --> 00:12:07.133
tomorrow fine you'll be just immobilized.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.167
You can't move and persons don't care in this country

00:12:12.234 --> 00:12:16.701
as it is even for people who are alright,

00:12:16.801 --> 00:12:20.000
but you'll become like old people who cannot move.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:26.334
Who see everything, know everything, who are
conscious, at a very young age this will happen,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.267
the slightest accident, the slightest disturbance, will just trigger off to that area

00:12:31.334 --> 00:12:34.667
where you will be absolutely like a mute person sitting.

00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:38.767
You can't move your finger, you can't hold anything.

00:12:38.834 --> 00:12:40.868
You will not be in a coma.

00:12:40.934 --> 00:12:44.501
Coma happens to people who take pills and things to go to the left,

00:12:44.567 --> 00:12:47.234
like drugs and things which take you to the left.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.734
But those who are right-sided you will not be in coma, that’s one thing, is a curse.

00:12:52.801 --> 00:13:01.367
You’ll see everything, you'll be alert you know everything but can't even turn your head.

00:13:01.434 --> 00:13:04.133
Take it from Me.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.334
That's coming, very soon.

00:13:08.367 --> 00:13:10.701
You may be talking, you may not be talking,

00:13:10.801 --> 00:13:17.968
it can go to that level, slowly, slowly, you'll find your body will be immobilized.

00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:20.901
People don't understand what dangers ego can have.

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:24.267
It is not now the aggression outside so much,

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:37.267
because it goes into left Vishuddhi, and this
left Vishuddhi will creates this horrible disease.

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:42.667
Now, how do we control our ego is very important to understand.

00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:49.434
First of all you must write your names and beat
yourselves with shoes for 108 times to begin with.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.067
Secondly discipline yourself, by disciplining, get up in the morning, do your meditation,

00:13:56.133 --> 00:13:59.734
with right hand towards the photograph, left hand this way.

00:13:59.834 --> 00:14:04.701
Not to use light at all, not to use sun don't go to the sun at all.

00:14:04.767 --> 00:14:07.667
Sun is to be avoided, keep to the moon,

00:14:07.767 --> 00:14:14.267
read the books which describes the Maha Kalis of the left-side Shaktis.

00:14:16.801 --> 00:14:19.000
Don't read the books like Avadhuta book.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:22.767
You should never read it because you think you are an Avadhuta, I see, he said

00:14:22.834 --> 00:14:26.734
“I'm omnipresent, I'm this thing”, the person start feeing “I am this”.

00:14:26.801 --> 00:14:29.834
I was reading the book of Avadhuta,

00:14:29.901 --> 00:14:36.467
I said this book, this show what's gone wrong with our incarnations.

00:14:36.534 --> 00:14:38.901
What's gone wrong with our incarnations is

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.067
they never knew human beings at all, at what level they are.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:49.701
You come and tell them “I'm formless and form, I'm this and that”, so what?

00:14:53.467 --> 00:14:59.801
If you are that, alright, I'm Compassion, I'm Love, I'm Peace, I'm that ... so what?

00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:03.400
How do you fill-in these cups?

00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:07.801
You have to come down to a human level, that's what they did not try,

00:15:07.868 --> 00:15:10.868
and that's why it's all a waste, I think on the contrary

00:15:10.968 --> 00:15:18.234
everybody think I'm God, I'm Bramha, Shivo Ham. Finished!

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.767
And then they quarrel among themselves.

00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:26.567
That growth, that maturity has not come.

00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:29.467
It is very shallow, the whole thing become very shallow,

00:15:29.567 --> 00:15:33.000
you become a shallow person, and you live with it.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.434
So the first thing practical thing I'm telling you: beat yourself with shoes

00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:41.267
and “I'm NOT this”.

00:15:42.434 --> 00:15:45.667
Like that you have to start first of all, telling yourself,

00:15:45.734 --> 00:15:50.701
if you are a seeker, a truthful seeker, an honest seeker, then I advise you this way,

00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:54.501
that you watch yourself in the mirror, and tell yourself:

00:15:54.601 --> 00:16:03.033
“Now you Mr Ego XYZ, will you get out from here, I know what I am, you get out”.

00:16:04.934 --> 00:16:07.300
You have to get after all this I mean.

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:11.968
Laugh at yourselves, smile at yourself, make fun of yourself.

00:16:12.734 --> 00:16:15.667
That's the best, and never feel hurt.

00:16:15.767 --> 00:16:22.501
If anybody says “you are egoistical”, and then you'll say “I know"

00:16:22.601 --> 00:16:28.601
'I know”: if you know you are egotistical, then how do you go further?

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.834
Now ego manifest in so many ways.

00:16:34.901 --> 00:16:40.167
Through your eyes, through your ears, through your mouth, through your nose.

00:16:40.234 --> 00:16:44.267
Everyway, because you go against God, that is you go against collectivity,

00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:49.000
because you go against Shri Krishna, against your Vishuddhi chakra.

00:16:49.067 --> 00:16:50.868
That's first thing it manifest.

00:16:50.934 --> 00:16:54.334
Nowadays nobody beats people like this, you see, we have become

00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.200
subtler in our ego manifestation; we use this part, not hands.

00:17:00.901 --> 00:17:06.200
It can be that you show temper through your eyes or it can be you flirt with your eyes.

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.200
You become adulterous. That is why Christ has said “don't become adulterous”.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.801
So now it is nice that the AIDS can work out through the tears.

00:17:13.868 --> 00:17:15.000
It's good.

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:17.601
Used to kiss people, alright, now kiss.

00:17:17.701 --> 00:17:20.467
Nobody will kiss now.

00:17:20.534 --> 00:17:26.901
You used all your Vishuddhi chakra so far to express all filth.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.067
Now the filth is pouring out.

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:35.534
So, in the second stage when we understand that it is through the Vishuddhi

00:17:35.601 --> 00:17:42.200
that is this America we express ourselves, our ego, so what should we do?

00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:45.968
First of all, stop talking.

00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:49.501
Here the way the people talk, I mean you see, you have just

00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:54.667
start opening your mouth like this and like that, you go on and the other is talking,

00:17:54.767 --> 00:17:58.334
just you tell them something, they just come on with all the knowledge

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.767
they have known everything, A to Z, and you don't know where you are.

00:18:03.868 --> 00:18:09.467
How do you stop talking?, I've told you a practical thing, I'll get you betel nuts,

00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:15.434
which I'll vibrate, put it in mouth, and you take it out when you have to talk.

00:18:15.501 --> 00:18:21.901
Otherwise keep it there, that's Shri Ganesha, don't take it out.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.534
Stop talking.

00:18:24.634 --> 00:18:28.767
If you stop talking, your hypocrisy will go away.

00:18:28.868 --> 00:18:35.067
It's through our face we are hypocritical, everything works out through Vishuddhi.

00:18:35.167 --> 00:18:41.767
Now see, a person who is extremely aggressive you see can also act to be very, very sweet

00:18:41.834 --> 00:18:46.400
you see, if they have to exploit you or make money out of you.

00:18:46.467 --> 00:18:51.834
They can act, acting; the whole acting comes through this Vishuddhi.

00:18:51.934 --> 00:18:57.934
Then you act, “You are a very gentle person, you are very good”.

00:18:58.033 --> 00:19:01.834
But you are not, you are aggressive.

00:19:01.934 --> 00:19:09.234
So for that you have to know that talking less

00:19:09.334 --> 00:19:15.267
will reduce 50% of your hypocrisy and acting, 50%.

00:19:15.367 --> 00:19:20.200
Now 50% still left, now what to do with the 50%?

00:19:23.067 --> 00:19:27.334
50% is a thing where we have to know

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:33.133
what other chakras are responsible for ego manifestation.

00:19:33.234 --> 00:19:37.968
Is one is the Hamsa, is very important Hamsa is.

00:19:38.067 --> 00:19:46.200
We use when we want to show our temper, indifference.

00:19:46.267 --> 00:19:55.200
Then a person thinks “Oh God, what have I done to this person?”

00:19:55.267 --> 00:19:59.067
That's how we show our temper, all the time like this.

00:19:59.133 --> 00:20:09.934
That's Hamsa and that's why we have to use what we call the simple thing called ghee

00:20:10.033 --> 00:20:20.033
or something oilish for ears, for nose, for eyes the kajal and for this portion also.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:28.100
We have to put some ghee in hot water or milk and take it so that you sooth down your nerves

00:20:28.167 --> 00:20:35.667
and you smooth down your Vishuddhi and also you sooth down the what you call in a general

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:39.534
way is the peritoneum but is the lining.

00:20:39.601 --> 00:20:46.534
Lining as we sooth down our fingers and hands when they are dried, we have to sooth them.

00:20:46.634 --> 00:20:52.367
Rub ghee here, ghee here, oil here, oil there, in the head.

00:20:52.467 --> 00:20:58.634
Now, the modern style is not to put oil in the head, you'll become balds.

00:20:58.701 --> 00:21:06.434
Balded gentleman, of course you can still act like Yull Brinner, but he died of cancer.

00:21:06.534 --> 00:21:17.667
His sister is our disciple, and you will develop funny hair styles everything and of this modern

00:21:17.734 --> 00:21:21.267
fashion has started don't put any oil, I don't know from it has come.

00:21:21.334 --> 00:21:25.133
The children also they say “don't put any oil in the ears”, this is doctors, they

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:31.634
want to create patients, don't listen to them.

00:21:31.734 --> 00:21:38.234
Before going traveling or anywhere, put oil in your ears, into your noses not the oil

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:45.467
but ghee, and control your peritoneum through your Hamsa chakra, is very important.

00:21:45.534 --> 00:21:52.801
This is the chakra which really helps you very much to soothe down.

00:21:52.868 --> 00:22:00.501
Now in Sanskrit and also in many colloquial languages, ghee is called as “mir”, and

00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:02.634
sneha is love.

00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:07.934
Neha also is love.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.200
So you have to oil it down, so the frictions are less.

00:22:12.267 --> 00:22:16.801
We know in nature, when we have the reduce friction, we put oil.

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:23.601
Like we have to say launch a ship, I've launched I know what it is, they had to put grease

00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:31.934
on the thing, and it just touched the ship and the ship moves, so smoothly onto the sea.

00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:33.601
Beautifully it moves.

00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:40.033
In India they put bananas, because bananas is a very easily available, so they put bananas

00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:41.434
you see under.

00:22:41.534 --> 00:22:45.634
Here they use grease, in England for example they use grease.

00:22:45.734 --> 00:22:49.200
In the same way, we have to grease ourselves.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:57.033
Our language, our tone, our speaking must be greased, greased with love and love is

00:22:57.133 --> 00:23:06.634
such a powerful thing that can attract any one let it be even Hitler.

00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:15.067
When you talk to someone or say something, it should have that coating of chocolate of

00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:22.367
Love, then you can give even give castor oil, I do that.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:30.934
So, all these things are to be understood [Vedas] says that we should not become stupid

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.834
as the other people are.

00:23:32.934 --> 00:23:43.167
We are yogis and we have to have a ideal life which manifest itself in all kinds of dynamism

00:23:43.234 --> 00:23:50.767
and we do not waste this great blessing that we have got.

00:23:50.834 --> 00:23:58.667
Now with this another chakra which is always caught is the Agnya, Agnya chakra.

00:23:58.734 --> 00:24:04.067
In the Agnya chakra we have to become thoughtlessly aware but we can't.

00:24:04.133 --> 00:24:12.267
Now if you watch your thoughts you will know mostly we think of the people who have harmed,

00:24:12.367 --> 00:24:17.133
who have troubled us, sometimes we have the glimpse of the good things also.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.334
We think of the good people also, sometimes, normally we are thinking about the people

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.100
who have harmed us, hurt us, this thing, that.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:31.667
Now, Christ who is Shri Ganesha and who has all the powers to kill us and to finish us

00:24:31.734 --> 00:24:39.434
off and destroy us completely has given us the greatest weapon, is to forgive.

00:24:39.534 --> 00:24:48.701
So the mantra here is “forgive” and you have to see that you forgive others.

00:24:48.767 --> 00:24:52.834
Anybody says anything, forgive.

00:24:52.901 --> 00:24:56.534
When you forgive, God takes over.

00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:03.467
And He knows how to handle or mishandle, to do whatever He likes to that person.

00:25:03.534 --> 00:25:09.601
That's not your job, you just forgive, so you give him a ticket, go to God, I forgive

00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:21.467
you, and you have to forgive and that is the thing you can enjoy your Agnya chakra very

00:25:21.567 --> 00:25:27.834
well, and raise your Kundalini beyond by saying “forgive, forgive, forgive”, three times,

00:25:27.901 --> 00:25:31.834
and you have to say the mantra of Nirvichara, no thoughts.

00:25:31.901 --> 00:25:38.267
Agnya is the one that brings thoughts to you, that's why Christ was so particular on the

00:25:38.334 --> 00:25:43.133
eyes, that “thou shall not have adulterous eyes”, try to concentrate your eyes on the

00:25:43.234 --> 00:25:49.534
mother Earth for some time, she'll suck in, so that your attention doesn't become that

00:25:49.634 --> 00:25:54.701
wobbly, becomes concentrated, and equalized and balanced.

00:25:54.767 --> 00:26:01.567
When that is done your eyes become so powerful even if you look at somebody, you can cure

00:26:01.634 --> 00:26:06.734
that person and the innocence will start coming in your eyes, you will not have lust and greed.

00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:11.000
It is a very dangerous thing people are playing here, I mean, I didn’t know all these things

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:16.701
people do but I saw it in the West, I mean, everybody is looking at every girl, what is

00:26:16.767 --> 00:26:17.901
the joyless pursuit?

00:26:17.968 --> 00:26:23.100
Why, turn your eyes to anything that you don't enjoy at all.

00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:27.334
At every girl a man is looking, a girl is looking at every man, what's this nonsense?

00:26:27.434 --> 00:26:28.901
Why waste your energy.

00:26:28.968 --> 00:26:34.400
I always look at about 3 feet height, you see all the flowers there, you see all the

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:36.801
children.

00:26:36.901 --> 00:26:40.434
One day somebody asked Me, “don't you feel like looking at handsome men”?

00:26:40.501 --> 00:26:48.267
I said “I'm not a fool, I look at the most handsome things, at 3 feet level”.

00:26:48.367 --> 00:26:52.400
He said, you must be a fool to look at this.

00:26:52.467 --> 00:26:54.868
I'm not, that is what it is.

00:26:54.934 --> 00:27:01.734
So that will give you tremendous amount of energy, because you preserve all your energy

00:27:01.834 --> 00:27:02.734
through your eyes.

00:27:02.834 --> 00:27:07.701
Eyes are the windows of that Power.

00:27:07.767 --> 00:27:13.767
If you try to preserve it, it's alright, otherwise like now they say “save water, because you've

00:27:13.834 --> 00:27:18.334
wasted your water, so now save water”.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:27.000
But when your eyes are innocent in this shower of bliss, you enjoy that bliss, you don't

00:27:27.067 --> 00:27:31.834
have to look at anyone, you don't have to say anything, you just enjoy, just feel the

00:27:31.934 --> 00:27:35.701
joy pouring into you completely.

00:27:35.767 --> 00:27:40.934
Because the ego has vanished, you see it is an aggression to look at everyone like that,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.934
it's an aggression.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.734
I've known people who mesmerize women, who mesmerize men, I've known women like that,

00:27:47.801 --> 00:27:51.968
I've seen in the parties, I've seen the bhoots coming out of these women, and they look at

00:27:52.033 --> 00:27:58.200
the man and he gets transfixed, completely, falls in love with that woman, till he becomes

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.300
like a beggar, she just lynches him.

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:07.801
It is prostitution, by men or women, it's a horrible thing, it is dirt in your eyes,

00:28:07.868 --> 00:28:12.300
so keep your eyes steady, try to steady them, if they try to go here and there tell them,

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.133
you say “look there, there's the mother Earth, she's the one that gives us all beautiful

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:24.167
things, look at that” and then the beauty of that mother Earth will come into your eyes.

00:28:24.267 --> 00:28:33.968
And the cleanliness and the innocence will cleanse others, that's how it should be.

00:28:34.033 --> 00:28:42.267
So to fight this ego one has to be prepared and must have proper will power, because ego

00:28:42.334 --> 00:28:45.567
kills the will power of man, completely.

00:28:45.667 --> 00:28:49.434
A man who is an egoist is left with no will power.

00:28:49.534 --> 00:28:52.934
It does what the ego tells him to.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:29:02.300
It can murder people, it can be violent, all the violence in America is from the ego manifestation.

00:29:02.367 --> 00:29:10.133
Because there is no respect of the law, not of human laws, but not of God's law also,

00:29:10.234 --> 00:29:14.434
that's how people behave, that how they incur diseases, a horrible things.

00:29:14.501 --> 00:29:22.734
A person who is not egotistical will not get cancer.

00:29:22.801 --> 00:29:26.934
You have to be egotistical to get cancer, though it is a left-sided thing, but you have

00:29:27.033 --> 00:29:34.234
to have ego, vulnerability comes through ego and then it acts.

00:29:34.334 --> 00:29:44.133
If you are egoistical, you are vulnerable to cancer so first thing if you survive from

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:54.300
say cancer, you'll have the other one waiting, where you'll be transfixed by bhoots.

00:29:54.367 --> 00:29:58.801
You will become like some of the things I see on TV, where people are given some sort

00:29:58.901 --> 00:30:06.300
of artificial thing and they are just nothing but machines and they move their hands like

00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:11.267
machines, they walk like this, they look like human being, and they walk straight like this,

00:30:11.334 --> 00:30:18.934
they can't feel anything, like that you'll become, because ego takes you away from emotions

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.434
and away from the left side and you become really a person like a machine, you become

00:30:23.534 --> 00:30:24.434
like a machine.

00:30:24.534 --> 00:30:33.167
I met one dentist, he came to Me, he said to me “Mother, now I cannot apply, I cannot

00:30:33.234 --> 00:30:38.367
feel and I do not feel bad when somebody dies”.

00:30:38.467 --> 00:30:48.434
I said “so what do you do?”, “I jog”, I mean jog means running away from yourself.

00:30:48.501 --> 00:30:51.234
Jog for how many hours?

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:59.267
“5 hours”, out of the 10 hours he’s awake, he is away 5 hours, he jogs, what else

00:30:59.367 --> 00:31:01.834
will happen?

00:31:01.934 --> 00:31:07.367
So all these artificial things have come to us because is a manifestation of somebody's

00:31:07.467 --> 00:31:14.534
ego, even drugs came to us because somebody wanted to make money out of us.

00:31:14.634 --> 00:31:20.133
All these gurus they wanted to make money out of us, you see they are more interested

00:31:20.234 --> 00:31:25.300
in making money, all egotistical people are very money oriented, they can't get out of

00:31:25.367 --> 00:31:28.133
it, any amount of money you give them.

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:33.334
Whatever I mean I have blessed people with thousands and thousands of rupees, billion

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.467
and billions of things, but still their money orientation doesn't go and then they lose

00:31:39.567 --> 00:31:47.067
it in no time, they lose just like that, just like that, Naturally, because they do not

00:31:47.133 --> 00:31:53.834
recognize that it is a blessing one has got it, now you have to share it.

00:31:53.901 --> 00:32:03.200
I mean, actually coming to Sahaja Yoga there was one gentleman who was really absolutely

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:10.801
on the verge of collapsing without any money, he has become such a rich man overnight and

00:32:10.868 --> 00:32:13.133
overnight again he become the same.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:21.167
Is an example, he came to Me, came to Sahaja Yoga, he became very rich, became all this,

00:32:21.234 --> 00:32:25.467
and then suddenly he lost everything, and even Sahaja Yogis started saying “Mother,

00:32:25.534 --> 00:32:31.100
we come to You for a short time” and then they go away and they become very rich, I

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:38.534
said, alright:, and then see afterwards one year, before and after, where are they now?

00:32:38.634 --> 00:32:50.100
This man has become so poor that he doesn't even have money to take a bus, so the calamities

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:55.033
come in like that and then they don't understand, but I'm telling you unless and until you talk

00:32:55.133 --> 00:32:59.000
of calamities, people don't learn, they need a shock, otherwise they don't want to get

00:32:59.067 --> 00:33:04.067
out of their egos, they cannot, they live with it, they don't want to understand that

00:33:04.167 --> 00:33:08.834
this is going to happen, then they'd better do it, when they see it happening.

00:33:08.934 --> 00:33:16.501
This case, one case of one gentleman has brought forth before all the Indian Sahaja yogis a

00:33:16.567 --> 00:33:17.968
very big lesson.

00:33:18.033 --> 00:33:23.100
They were saying that “you should come to Sahaja Yoga for short time and get out of

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:27.467
it, then you'll become very rich”, this is what they have reached their conclusion

00:33:27.534 --> 00:33:38.367
and now they don't say so, because the medium through which you have got God's grace, if

00:33:38.434 --> 00:33:41.434
it is lost, you have lost it.

00:33:41.534 --> 00:33:48.968
So don't live with full confidence with that horrible ego of yours, it is going to overpower

00:33:49.033 --> 00:33:51.033
you.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.267
And as you've seen the bhoots combine, also egotistical people will always combine.

00:33:55.367 --> 00:34:01.434
They are two egoists, they will always be very friendly, because they combined together

00:34:01.501 --> 00:34:08.234
they are just the same, but when they are immobilized then what is going to happen?

00:34:08.334 --> 00:34:13.968
They were sitting like statues, you can make statues out of them I think, what will be

00:34:14.067 --> 00:34:15.334
the next [unclear: state?]

00:34:15.434 --> 00:34:22.434
I do not know, because they are not dead, they are living, but they can't eat food,

00:34:22.534 --> 00:34:31.167
they can look at food, they can't eat it, but if you put injection in [unclear] because

00:34:31.267 --> 00:34:37.734
the parasympathetic might be working or maybe sympathetic might be working, the autonomous

00:34:37.801 --> 00:34:39.968
might be working but the rest of it is finished.

00:34:40.033 --> 00:34:44.334
The central nervous system is finished.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.267
It can happen suddenly to someone.

00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:57.667
Write it down, today I have told you about this disease.

00:34:57.767 --> 00:35:06.334
Try to keep to the group, try to share everything and don't try your cunning clever methods.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.367
Cunningness is cheating yourself, Gregoire has told Me “Mother this intelligence, human

00:35:10.434 --> 00:35:15.267
intelligence is so intelligent it can cheat yourself”.

00:35:15.334 --> 00:35:19.033
That's what I see.

00:35:19.133 --> 00:35:26.501
Why do you want to cheat yourself, are you mad?

00:35:26.601 --> 00:35:31.734
This is what one has to realize, once you understand that, you'll see most of the problems

00:35:31.834 --> 00:35:33.901
of this world will subside.

00:35:33.968 --> 00:35:38.067
How do you have atom bomb, how do you have all these things?

00:35:38.167 --> 00:35:41.934
Science never said “you make atom bomb”, science was given to you for constructive

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.801
work, for saving time for meditation, not to make atomic bombs to kill you, no, but

00:35:49.868 --> 00:35:57.133
in a way it acts because America makes some bombs, Russia makes some bombs, like two,

00:35:57.234 --> 00:36:03.234
they'll be sitting on their heads, now they cannot put their hands to the buttons.

00:36:03.334 --> 00:36:11.834
Is a good idea, they are afraid of the devils they have created themselves, see that's what

00:36:11.934 --> 00:36:21.567
because it is so over-powering, so if you want to avoid your own destruction, then beware,

00:36:21.634 --> 00:36:34.067
be aware of yourself, not to boast, that “I know, I know”, no, how you behave?

00:36:34.133 --> 00:36:43.934
Some people are such that they say “we can't live in an ordinary place, we cannot sleep

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.534
in an ordinary place and all that”, that means they are beggars, that is what I feel

00:36:48.634 --> 00:36:55.400
about such people, because if you are the king like I am the Queen I should say, I don't

00:36:55.467 --> 00:36:59.234
want anything, you make me sleep under this tree, I can sleep, I can sleep anywhere, I

00:36:59.334 --> 00:37:04.834
can live the way I like, and you know I live in a palace, actually a palace, so what, that

00:37:04.901 --> 00:37:10.534
palace is not important to Me, wherever I go I make it a palace for Myself, because

00:37:10.601 --> 00:37:18.567
I'm not bothered about comforts, no comfort can crawl up on Me, nothing dominate can Me,

00:37:18.634 --> 00:37:28.767
nothing can come over Me, nothing is important to Me, because I'm the Queen, if I'm the beggar

00:37:28.868 --> 00:37:37.667
then I want comfort, I want this, I want that, there is no want left.

00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:48.100
Nothing wanted, in that state when you arrive then you'll enjoy Sahaja Yoga, your spirit,

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:52.167
and that's what happens when people come to India.

00:37:52.234 --> 00:38:00.567
I was amazed to see these people who came, first time they came we spent 40,000 dollars

00:38:00.634 --> 00:38:14.167
and 5 Americans came here, 4 or 5, 4 and 1 Canadian, so 5 and 4 ran away, imagine how

00:38:14.234 --> 00:38:22.133
expensive that, 4 ran away, we tried, they came to see Me and all that, “No, Mother

00:38:22.234 --> 00:38:26.234
we can't stand this [unclear: discomfort], we cannot stand this discomfort”, what comfort

00:38:26.334 --> 00:38:30.767
do you want here?, I don't see any comfort, horrible since I've come to this, you can

00:38:30.834 --> 00:38:38.334
see my head, I've been sick in this horrible place, what comforts you have?

00:38:38.434 --> 00:38:40.367
And there they were boasting so much, they ran away.

00:38:40.434 --> 00:38:51.367
So, all you understand that those people who are asking for things all the time, begging

00:38:51.434 --> 00:38:57.033
for things have not achieved anything in life.

00:38:57.133 --> 00:39:00.834
Now when you are coming this time to India we are going to have a much more Spartan life

00:39:00.934 --> 00:39:08.901
because we are not going to be stay in any building whatsoever, as far as possible except

00:39:08.968 --> 00:39:15.734
in Rowdy, maybe there also, we are going to put you up in the pendalls outside, absolutely

00:39:15.834 --> 00:39:28.868
in the forest, where there will be tigers they will be snakes, crawling up you, and

00:39:28.934 --> 00:39:40.400
you’ll have to have baths in the river which are flowing in at a big speed.

00:39:40.501 --> 00:39:51.400
And then also you will have their beautiful music of the morning birds and beautiful fragrance,

00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:54.734
it’s so beautiful and soothing.

00:39:54.801 --> 00:40:09.300
There where grows the essence of life and that's what we have decided, I mean, I can

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.501
live there, why can't you live?

00:40:12.601 --> 00:40:28.334
I can't understand, what is so special about it, I'm an old woman now 63 years of age,

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:37.067
and all my life my father or my husband are being extremely over-comfortable people, I

00:40:37.133 --> 00:40:40.000
mean luxurious people.

00:40:40.067 --> 00:40:46.000
I mean I have never known how to take a taxi or take a bus all my life, I've never known

00:40:46.067 --> 00:40:53.000
how to take a ticket to go by train, I've never traveled by air alone, I mean, I don't

00:40:53.067 --> 00:40:59.667
know how to travel by air alone, I mean, I've always been like that, but I don't need anything,

00:40:59.734 --> 00:41:05.234
I can travel alone, I can go anywhere, I can do everything without feeling any fear, without

00:41:05.334 --> 00:41:11.767
feeling any problems because as long I'm with myself, what is there to worry?

00:41:11.868 --> 00:41:18.033
And that’s what we have to achieve, that is what we have to do.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.934
Once we achieve that kind of a temperament, is so beautiful, you'll respect yourself,

00:41:23.033 --> 00:41:26.901
you'll love yourself, and that's how we love others and respect others, those that don't

00:41:26.968 --> 00:41:30.267
respect themselves cannot respect.

00:41:30.334 --> 00:41:34.434
Egotistical people do not respect themselves, if they respect themselves they would not

00:41:34.534 --> 00:41:38.033
be egotistical, but it is so shameful to be egotistical.

00:41:38.133 --> 00:41:43.400
If you say “you are very egotistical” that person will punch you, even if you say

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:45.534
something else, they won't, will they?

00:41:45.601 --> 00:41:53.334
But is you say “you are egoistical”, they'll punch you that means they feel hurt, if they

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.701
don't like why do they have it?

00:41:55.801 --> 00:42:03.901
It's a very difficult thing to move that ego from your heads, and you catch from one to

00:42:03.968 --> 00:42:08.067
the other so fast that sometimes I don't understand.

00:42:08.133 --> 00:42:12.300
But Indian climate and Indian up-bringing is such, people don't get egotistical, I have

00:42:12.367 --> 00:42:17.200
not known of anyone who is today good and tomorrow standing with a punch, I've not seen

00:42:17.267 --> 00:42:22.434
anyone like that in India, very steady people, now see here is sitting somebody a doctor

00:42:22.534 --> 00:42:25.968
and he missed his Nobel prize, a man like that.

00:42:26.067 --> 00:42:28.567
Can you believe that such a man is sitting here?

00:42:28.634 --> 00:42:31.801
He's another one.

00:42:31.868 --> 00:42:37.067
You won't find this with anyone in India behaving like that, they have ego, very subtle egos,

00:42:37.167 --> 00:42:45.267
bureaucrats have I must say, and other politicians have, [watch: Mother corrects India to abroad

00:42:45.334 --> 00:42:48.434
very quickly here] but till they come to abroad then they get even worse.

00:42:48.534 --> 00:42:57.234
But normally a person's status is known the way he is humble in India, otherwise they

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:03.400
don't believe you are from a royal family, you are from a royal family you are extremely

00:43:03.467 --> 00:43:10.267
humble, that the sign, like the [unclear: shesha].

00:43:10.334 --> 00:43:14.801
I talked to her five sentences as I said and she said “this lady is very honorable, from

00:43:14.868 --> 00:43:21.300
a royal family, must be” I am, but I mean, I am, but I mean I've never told her, which

00:43:21.367 --> 00:43:30.501
is not known to many people, but she said “She must be from a royal family”.

00:43:30.601 --> 00:43:35.267
What is the need to insult others, what is the need to shout at others and talk in that

00:43:35.367 --> 00:43:36.267
manner?

00:43:36.367 --> 00:43:43.334
There is no need, you must talk in a way that is sweet and nice, it looks nice, it shows

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.334
better.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:51.968
Your personality is better seen by others, at least for the sake of congenial concord

00:43:52.033 --> 00:43:59.567
with others please try to get over your nonsensical ego.

00:43:59.634 --> 00:44:10.934
It keeps you out of bounds for the joy, the ocean of joy that you have to have.

00:44:11.033 --> 00:44:16.901
You are a miserable creature for nothing at all, making everybody miserable.

00:44:16.968 --> 00:44:22.234
But face it, face it, don't put it in your left Vishuddhi, “Oh, I'm egotistical, I'm

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.968
very unhappy”, you're finished, I cannot cure that, I'm already suffering you see,

00:44:27.067 --> 00:44:31.000
all the time I get pain here, pain here, I don’t know what to do, since I've come to

00:44:31.067 --> 00:44:35.868
West I've developed a problem here because all of you have in this left Vishuddhi and

00:44:35.934 --> 00:44:39.601
I've put you inside My body.

00:44:39.667 --> 00:44:45.868
You don't know how much you make Me suffer, though I don't mind, I can see that.

00:44:45.934 --> 00:44:54.167
I have to request you now to you look after yourself and behave in a manner that this

00:44:54.234 --> 00:45:02.634
American ego disappears because there's another way out that is Shri Krishna's time which

00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:06.601
I don't want to use just now.

00:45:06.667 --> 00:45:16.067
The first destruction will start in America then construction will start.

00:45:16.167 --> 00:45:20.767
Destruction is impossible, the clouds of destruction will disappear, completely disappear, the

00:45:20.868 --> 00:45:28.400
cool wind will blow it out, but you have to be of sincerity and of understanding, without

00:45:28.467 --> 00:45:35.234
any ego, that's your responsibility, for your children, for your progeny, for your country,

00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:38.567
it is your responsibility.

00:45:38.634 --> 00:45:40.100
Good?

00:45:40.167 --> 00:45:46.234
May God Bless you.

00:45:46.334 --> 00:45:55.968
So now I'll be going for the another stride and in the evening I may not meet you again.

00:45:56.033 --> 00:46:05.801
But I hope you people will now give the full list of the people who want to marry.

00:46:05.868 --> 00:46:11.934
Those who have not yet decided, should decide, even if you are not decided on people, give

00:46:12.033 --> 00:46:19.400
me the list of the people who want to get married in India, if not this year, then next

00:46:19.467 --> 00:46:26.234
year, something like that, all of you should give your names, those who want to marry that

00:46:26.334 --> 00:46:32.534
is very important because it is impossible to do it without getting everyone there, that's

00:46:32.601 --> 00:46:34.200
one point is.

00:46:34.267 --> 00:46:39.601
Secondly we should decide how many are going, how they are going, and all these things are

00:46:39.667 --> 00:46:46.367
to be done in a proper systematic way and Babet must be informed about it, everybody

00:46:46.467 --> 00:46:50.133
should say that so many are going from Los Angeles this way, they are going from this

00:46:50.234 --> 00:46:54.634
way and Babet should be able to organize it, there should be no competition, nothing.

00:46:54.734 --> 00:46:59.701
And you should see to it that you get the cheapest price.

00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:10.634
But not at the cost of disturbing yourself, whatever you can get easily, just get it,

00:47:10.734 --> 00:47:12.501
that's not so important.

00:47:12.567 --> 00:47:19.367
The third point I've said that there is no need for you to bring too much of luggage

00:47:19.467 --> 00:47:25.734
especially for ladies, there is no need to bring any make-ups or anything in India, no

00:47:25.834 --> 00:47:32.534
need at all it's a country where your skin improves by itself, you don't have to do much

00:47:32.601 --> 00:47:38.267
make-up or anything it's very smooth country, where your skin nourishes itself, and you'll

00:47:38.334 --> 00:47:42.934
feel very nice and even if you have to buy you can buy, you can buy them in India which

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.601
are made out of not any chemicals or anything, but natural things you see.

00:47:47.667 --> 00:47:50.968
Even for toothpaste and all that, it is better to use Indian toothpaste I think, so I think

00:47:51.067 --> 00:47:57.501
now I've reached that conclusion, all these horrible toothpaste here things are what chemicals

00:47:57.601 --> 00:48:02.767
they have I don't know what will happen to the teeth, so far my teeth are intact, I've

00:48:02.834 --> 00:48:10.634
never been to a dentist, but I feel, I feel there are full of horrible chemicals in it.

00:48:10.701 --> 00:48:15.934
So don't spoil your skin with these horrible make-ups and things like that, I mean to find

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.567
a proper shampoo here, I find it impossible because sometimes maybe some shampoos can

00:48:20.634 --> 00:48:29.167
just take out your hair like that, you see, so try to acquire habits which are simple,

00:48:29.267 --> 00:48:37.033
natural habits in a living not primitive, again I say not primitive, but not very elaborate

00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:41.968
and don't pay so much attention to your body as you do, there is no need to pay, it is

00:48:42.033 --> 00:48:46.434
alright whatever God has given it a body, it's alright, you don't have worry too much

00:48:46.501 --> 00:48:47.434
about it.

00:48:47.501 --> 00:48:52.968
To do some little exercises in the morning, or something, do your meditation properly,

00:48:53.033 --> 00:48:58.267
be normal people, you don't have to overdo anything, little bit is alright, but just

00:48:58.334 --> 00:49:01.734
keep in the center, don't go to extremes in anything.

00:49:01.834 --> 00:49:06.400
Now you have to be bring a sweater and things like that and as I told you a proper bedding

00:49:06.467 --> 00:49:07.901
as I told that you have to bring.

00:49:07.968 --> 00:49:14.367
Now, in India they will supply you with sheets and everything, with nice cotton sheets, because

00:49:14.434 --> 00:49:21.467
you must use as far as possible cotton and as far as possible silks, or cotton natural

00:49:21.567 --> 00:49:26.367
things, not artificial things like you'll get into trouble if you use plastics and things

00:49:26.434 --> 00:49:34.868
like that, so as far as possible try not to bring many clothes because we can get you

00:49:34.934 --> 00:49:35.868
everything.

00:49:35.934 --> 00:49:45.701
Now, to come to the practical side of it I would like to have all the what you call,

00:49:45.767 --> 00:49:52.367
sizes, written down properly but make them into 4 sizes.

00:49:52.467 --> 00:50:01.133
You sort it out, you can do it, put them into 4 sizes, for kurtas, and for ladies' also

00:50:01.234 --> 00:50:11.200
blouses into 4 sizes so you make 4 sizes, A, B, C, D sizes for men and women, and we

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.634
keep that ready for you when you come.

00:50:13.701 --> 00:50:18.901
Imagine how much these Indians work for it and how much do I donate, that's all donation

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.834
whatever I give, what remains the money is so little and they are now going to donate

00:50:23.901 --> 00:50:31.267
so much money for your school, for your children, imagine that Indians should do it, it's not

00:50:31.334 --> 00:50:32.934
very good.

00:50:33.033 --> 00:50:39.734
We have such a little money to be very frank which has been given that I really feel shy

00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:45.033
to take that money to India so I've kept it now with Arneau, every money is kept there,

00:50:45.133 --> 00:50:49.234
that you keep it there, but if you have to have a school we have to a good school and

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:55.667
for that we need money but just now you don't think of donating anything, because though

00:50:55.734 --> 00:50:58.033
you are rich people you are incapable of donations now.

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:03.234
II can see that clearly, because you have to travel, you have to spend money on your

00:51:03.334 --> 00:51:08.300
travels, Indians don't have to do that, so it's alright but whatever they have said a

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:13.033
little amount for donations that much you give them.

00:51:13.133 --> 00:51:18.701
And you come there with love, but people come back like traders I tell you really like traders,

00:51:18.767 --> 00:51:25.267
because India is a place where one can buy lots of things, you like everything “you

00:51:25.334 --> 00:51:28.133
want buy this, you want to buy that” that's not good.

00:51:28.234 --> 00:51:34.267
Buy a few things of symbolic value, whatever you need you should buy, you cannot bring

00:51:34.334 --> 00:51:39.868
all the things that you need from India, but people when they travel like that it is very

00:51:39.934 --> 00:51:47.000
shameful I think people sometimes don't understand how yogis have to carry so many things, now

00:51:47.067 --> 00:51:55.334
you should carry things which are useful to you, which are good for you but not too much.
