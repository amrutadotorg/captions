00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.660
Nice to be back again in Hampstead.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.660
I always enjoyed Hampstead

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.700
because,as I have told, you in London,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.000
many people who were

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.820
great spiritual lived in this area.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.980
They preferred it to other places.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.040
So I believe that many people who live in this area

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.240
must be also spiritual,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.400
must have taken their birth with the idea of achieving their Self-Realisation.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.920
It’s a very important t ime: when you are born.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.580
It’s the most important in the history of the universe.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.440
You are created a human being to become your Spirit.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.880
There’s nothing in between.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.740
If you have intelligence, pure intelligence,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.880
you can see through all that.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.620
You have to test your intelligence on this.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.400
Whatever we think and whatever we conceive

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.860
and whatever we try to organise ourselves into,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620
mostly comes from our conditionings,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
not from the Spirit, because we have not touched the Spirit.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.800
But innately we have got a sense to know

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.200
that these are very important times;

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.360
that there must be something great in the atmosphere,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.180
that there are so many people who are seeking.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.240
It’s something remarkable. If this misses your attention,

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.240
that means you are not alert.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.800
There are people of all types, all kinds. But seekers

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.240
of this calibre have been very few.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.400
Now England has its own problems,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.660
and London has its own peculiarities.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.300
Despite the fact I have been in London for about

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.040
eight and a half years,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.300
I feel that

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.340
the reception of the truth has been very, very poor.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.440
Maybe, I am luckier than others.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.420
It’s the conditioning, again I would say, of another type

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.200
that prevails [in] the minds.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.100
First we had, about twenty-five years back

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.740
the conditioning of the science,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.240
but scientists themselves have refuted it.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.320
They themselves have challenged the science

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.300
and they themselves know that it’s not such a happy affair,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.220
just to be a scientist.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.520
Then comes the intellectuals.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.960
The books started pouring in, in the market:

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.660
all kinds of books.You can read about everything.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.660
Everyone knows about everything!

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.080
And once you start reading about them,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.200
you conceive something;

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.140
your conceptions are built about the truth also.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.580
The thing you have never seen,

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.380
the thing you have never felt, you cannot conceive it,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.460
it is to be seen.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.780
Like I had never seen Hampstead before,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.640
and the first idea of my husband was to buy a house in Hampstead

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.140
it’s surprising! I was very happy at that point.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.300
So I said, “Let’s go and see!”

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.600
Without seeing it, if I had some conception about it,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.360
it would have been wrong.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.320
My seeing is different from others, I must say.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.700
I liked the place immensely,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.660
but he,from the point of view [of] distances and all of that he said,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.380
“It’s not good.” And naturally his ideas prevailed;doesn’t matter.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.100
But seeing, itself, makes you understand.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.480
But what is Self-Realisation? It’s not only seeing.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.040
When you come to Hampstead you don’t see it.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.480
You feel it.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:34.560
You feel it. Now many people say you can feel it, but the idea of feeling is also quite conditioned.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.880
Like, some children like to cuddle a little doll.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.640
They feel the doll. But God knows how far they feel it.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.820
They might be feeling it physically,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.620
or emotionally also they might be feeling some sort of a security with the doll, maybe.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.360
Psychologically they might be deriving some joy out of that

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.320
doll itself.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.960
Or maybe the image,

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.200
which has some sort of an attraction

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.360
of some sort of a thing that is built within their unconscious,

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.360
that they feel so close to that.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.700
But a person who is a realised-soul

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.380
does not feel a doll that way, even if it’s a child.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.900
It’s surprising. You must watch a realised child

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.700
getting to a doll. It’s very surprising.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:39.280
For example, I bought two dolls from London for my grandchildren and they rejected completely.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.300
They said, “What sort of dolls these are?” I said, “Why?”

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.600
“They are unhappy!” I said, “They are not unhappy.”

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.640
“No, see their lips!”

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.800
You see, the lips of the dolls here is all just like a duck’s beak.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.700
They said, “They have resentment. They are angry.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.960
They are not realised!”

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.860
That’s it!

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.540
If you are a happy person then the whole get-up of your face changes,

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.740
and they could see, they could feel it.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.740
They rejected: “We don’t want these dolls.”

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.380
And then next time when I had to go I had to go

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.260
round the whole places. First of all they were plastics;

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.260
so plastics they don’t like.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:31.660
They don’t like plastic. Somehow realised people don’t like plastics,automatically.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.740
They wouldn’t wear plastic clothes,  they wouldn’t wear nylon clothes,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.740
they wouldn’t wear mixed clothes: very difficult.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.780
They must have cotton clothes. Even if they have one, they’ll wear that the whole day,

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.260
morning, evening, every time, the same thing.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.340
You see, it’s a different sensitivity which we do not have before Realisation.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:51.860
They have a different sensitivity.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:58.180
And the coefficients of a doll which emits vibrations they like.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.000
But it’s very difficult to get such dolls nowadays; impossible.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:07.780
Because where are these artists who are realised-souls who used to make dolls?

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.260
I have seen they make their own dolls,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.760
out of something:. sometimes my saris they will use or something.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.240
And sleep with those.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.240
It’s something to be understood that, after Realisation,

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:31.580
the thing you feel is not what you feel through your heart or through your conditioning of ages, also, maybe.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.580
Like if you have been living with a woman

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.260
for many years with blue eyes,

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.580
then you may like a doll with blue eyes. You may,

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.160
because you have that image into your head.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.380
You may like. Or you may have a nanny of with blue eyes

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.120
you may like a doll like that.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.940
It’s all psychological.  It’s conditioning very deep in you.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.520
But Spirit has no conditioning. It’s a free thing.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:02.420
What does it feel? It feels the joy of Creation,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.220
which we cannot.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.360
Before Realisation we cannot feel.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.940
You see, when we see something, where is the joy?

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.520
Now, for example, if a fussy man comes here he’ll say,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.940
“Oh, God, what a thing! I have to take out my shoes

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.140
and sit like that! And the chairs were horrible!

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.920
And couldn’t sit: very uncomfortable!

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.920
And the colour was all white.”

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.160
He couldn’t bear it.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.400
And I don’t know: all sorts of things.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.760
The thoughts will start.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.480
If you buy something – same thing.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.240
If you see something – same thing.

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.200
There’s no joy!

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.340
We just start thinking!

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.920
Or if not, to avoid that, you may start a poetry about it.

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:54.720
It’s sometimes so artificial, some of the poetry.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.760
So artificially put there that you can see it clearly

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.800
clearly that this man is just a sadist, wants to make you cry.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.080
Like Lord Byron!

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.060
You can see it so clearly that this man has no sincerity of purpose.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.920
He’s not sincere.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.460
That sincerity you cannot feel

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.560
unless and until you are realised

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.660
because such a poem you won’t like at all,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.600
whether you understand the language or not.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.740
The whole tone of it will emit horrible vibrations;

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.820
it’s absolutely the essence of everything is nothing but vibrations.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.520
Everything is nothing but vibrations; the rest is all zero.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.800
We are nothing but our vibrations

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.280
which are

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.960
emitted because we are now connected with the Spirit.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.100
But otherwise also, whether you are connected with Spirit

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.960
or not, you emit vibrations.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.440
But these are the vibrations without the light in it,

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.980
and you can feel the vibrations of a person out and out.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.600
You can feel, feel how.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.500
You can feel on your centres.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.040
All your centres become active and you start feeling on your centres.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.140
That means all these five centres, six, seven centres you start feeling.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.400
Even you may not feel in your fingers.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:26.940
Some of us Sahaja yogis may not feel also even today after so many days because their Vishuddhi Chakra is very bad.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.200
They must have smoked in,  I think, ten lives,

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.920
and must have been horrible Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.600
and maybe that’s why it’s all on the myelin sheath of the nerves that you cannot feel it.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.800
That’s a different point.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.700
But you will feel it on your centres.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.140
And the feeling on the centre is emitted in your nervous system.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:55.420
And when it comes to it you feel it on your centres

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.560
and you know, you just know.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.320
And you know it as vibratory awareness.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.060
This vibratory awareness has to grow, no doubt.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:13.280
The sensitivity has to grow, no doubt.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.580
But, first you must touch it.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.760
If it has not even touched, then how can it grow?

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.160
But we are so conditioned that we take to things

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.120
which superficially are very appealing.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.680
Sahaja Yoga is not like that.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:35.580
It’s truth. It’s reality.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.340
Of course, you cannot pay for reality. I mean, how can you pay?

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:41.340
If it is reality, you cannot pay for it.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.220
That’s one simple thing.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.820
You cannot artificially say you are realised-soul.  You cannot.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.920
There was a girl, I met her in Portugal,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.640
mischievous one, and she wanted to stick on with the Sahaja yogis

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.000
because she was very negative and she wanted to disturb the Sahaja yogis.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.580
And she came to the programme

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.980
and she told me, “Oh, I am feeling very well, Mother. I am feeling vibrations!”

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.520
I just looked at her.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.080
I kept quiet: because I knew she was not.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.540
I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want to create trouble.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.420
But second day when she turned up I said, “Why are you telling me lies?”

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.660
“No, no, no!” I said, “Yes,

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.240
you are telling me lies. You have to be sincere.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.360
What are you going to gain?”

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.620
Say, you are mischievous.You are playing into the hands of negative forces:

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.260
what is your gain?

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.640
You are the Spirit. The Spirit is within you.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.420
You have to become the Spirit.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.180
It’s your own joy, is your own property, is your own Self:

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.240
which is not known to you.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.640
Why not be honest about it

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.740
and get to it instead of playing tricks

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.260
with yourself?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720
And then playing tricks with other Sahaja yogis:

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.720
what is the use? What is the gain?

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.220
Why are you playing into the hands of the satanic force?

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.520
Why don’t you play into the hands of the Divine force?”

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.940
She said, “No, no, Mother, I am feeling it!”

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.340
I said, “See, don’t tell me lies.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.540
I know for definite you are not feeling it,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.920
and if you are not going to be honest you are not going to come to my programme at all.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.420
You have to be honest yourself.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.360
If you are not honest I am not going to have you here.”

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:14.200
But dishonesty sometimes reaches a very absurd limit,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.480
because honesty is only up to which point you can see.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.160
Say, you can see the colour

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.800
is white – up to that you are honest.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.440
But if you start saying, “I know who has painted it,

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.540
and I know who has done the job and I know who is the company,”

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.160
and all that, that’s not true.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.400
So honesty is up to the point you know.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.160
Beyond that, if you start saying things because you have read somewhere something

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.760
or you have heard something,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.760
that’s wrong, that’s not being honest.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.480
So we have to have honesty and open-mindedness.

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.800
You have to be open-minded and honest,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.460
so that you see for yourself.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.480
Because as I told you it’s not like other places where you can just go and become members– nothing.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.120
First you have get your Realisation.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.520
Secondly, you have to grow into it.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.140
Those who cannot do, will be left out.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:09.800
You can’t help it.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.720
How far can you move it people?

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.920
How far can you tell them?

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.420
There’s no binding force.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.180
You are completely free to leave it or to take it.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.220
If you want to take it,

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.280
well and good. If you don’t want to take it,

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.220
no one is going to force you at all in this,! Because you cannot force.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.820
You can force a horse to eat,

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.160
that is possible;

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.440
but you cannot force any human being to be a realised-soul.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.440
You cannot.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.300
Not only that he has to ask for it

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.120
but he has to,later on, work for it.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.580
It is a tremendous thing you are asking for

00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.280
and it’s the greatest thing that you are achieving.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.180
It is made easy, I should say.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.460
The times are such. It looks easy but it’s not so easy.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.680
In Sahaja Yoga there are more drop-outs than sticking people.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:06.960
Naturally, because you have to be honest.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.920
You have to be very honest with it

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.080
and you have to give a try.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:18.400
Like in Spain I met about five, six ladies

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.300
and two men who came to see me.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.380
When I came out I was very reluctant

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.300
to have anything to do with them.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.660
But, all the Sahaja yogis were so impressed.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:29.720
I don’t know why.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.440
“Oh, Mother they are so good. You don’t know,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.340
they came and looked at your photograph and they did this and all that.”

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.320
I said, “Now, it’s all right if you want I will try!

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.580
But somehow I don’t think much is going to work out.”

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.680
And they thought they had found such a great bunch of people,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.240
who are real Sahaja yogis of the thing.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.440
I said, “Did you see their vibrations?”

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.380
They said, “No, Mother we were waiting for you.”

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.400
I said, “All right, doesn’t matter. I’ll have a look at them.”

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.900
And they said,

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.640
first question they asked,“Mother, why is it Sahaja yogis don’t smoke?”

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.760
I said, “Because they don’t want to.”

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.440
I mean, is that a question to ask?

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.860
I mean, if you smoke is it very normal?

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.840
I just couldn’t understand this question.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.240
She said, “No, we don’t want to lose our freedom

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.820
of smoking and freedom of drinking.”

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.940
I said, “Do you think you are free?

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.480
You are a slave.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.700
You can’t give up even if you want to.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.160
I can free you from that or your Kundalini can free you but you cannot.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.120
Even if you want you cannot give up,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.660
but here they just give up.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:42.820
I don’t tell them, I never force them,

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:47.940
but it just happens because if you get the nectar of life you don’t care for other nonsensical things.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.420
It’s simple as that.”

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.100
But they were so frightened with the Sahaja yogis’ style of life,

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:57.100
means they don’t smoke and drink every night, they said, “This is impossible”.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.900
They gave up.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.820
Can you imagine? At the first talk we had!

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.420
But then we had people with such tremendous characters.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.060
They came for the program.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:11.260
I was so very happy, extremely happy and joyous.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.120
Everybody said, “Mother, why?”

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.520
They were little, sometimes,

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.080
not so much receptive, maybe, according to Sahaja yogis.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.200
But I could feel my vibrations sucked into them,

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.600
absolutely flowing: the energy just getting into them,

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.580
and suddenly they said, “Ah! Got it.”

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.360
And tremendous people!

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.400
Very well-educated also, some of them.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:44.280
But extremely well-versed about what we have to achieve.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.520
I was surprised

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.000
in Spain there are people who know Sanskrit so well and about everything,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.520
about Chaitanya and all that.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.640
They know so well.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:57.320
It’s most surprising, and I used to think only scholarships exist in England.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.760
No. I was surprised.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.340
All of them knew about chakras.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:08.200
They knew about what it means. Everything they have sorted it out.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.180
I said,“When did you start?”

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.140
They said, “About, when we were, I think, ten years of age.”

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.600
I said, “Ten years of age? How?”

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:19.120
They said, “We, we just couldn’t be satisfied with what was the answer here.”

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.800
“Such grown-up people,” I said.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.400
From ten years of age. So many of them!

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.400
And you should have seen the way they were!

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:32.400
And they recognise Sahaja Yoga and the tremendous effect it has and the work that it is doing.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:37.480
You will be amazed the way these people behaved towards Sahaj Yoga.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:43.260
Then I said, “Next time, I am not staying in London – Spain.”

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.820
Yeah, really, I tell you!

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.780
Just the kind of reception. There’s no barrier at all in their minds.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.800
It’s such pure intelligence, sharp, to see this is the thing

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.300
– where are we running.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:01.300
And really I felt that, eight years I have wasted in this country, that time.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.760
Really for a moment I just felt, “Oh, God!”

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.600
But you know the importance of this country is so great

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.600
because it’s the heart of the universe.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.320
I have to labour through it! And such lethargy and such inertia

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.260
and explanations.  Intellectuals have a very good,

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.420
an easy-chair way of looking at things, very easy-chair way of looking at things.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.200
Easy-chair politicians they are.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.060
“Well, it’s very interesting.”

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.360
Many a times I have heard [this], “It’s very interesting, you know, Mother, what you have given us.

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.560
Very nice, yes, yes.”

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:42.660
It’s very common! But there, for them, it was a heavenly gift because they knew what it was.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.260
What’s the use of all the scholarship of Lord Byron

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:48.760
when you can’t recognise Christ?

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.100
When you can’t recognise the truth?

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.040
What’s this education for?

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.940
I was amazed at these people. They never went to Cambridge and they were not Oxbridges.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.460
Most surprising!

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.220
And they were people of great intelligence, very well-versed.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.520
And in Spain!

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.780
Can you imagine?

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.900
The same I will say of Italy.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.980
Italians are supposed to be very dishonest and this,  that, I have heard.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.060
Nobody was dishonest with me

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:28.280
as far as I am concerned: very upright, straightforward and tremendous people.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.000
Just my photograph convinced them.

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:39.400
They said, “The face shows!” They hate the Pope.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:43.940
They hate the Papal things. They know all about Pope. Everything they know.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.280
They have sorted out everything. But to know so much about chakras and things,

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.660
I was amazed.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:53.200
They knew about tantrism. They knew that Hitler used tantrikas.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.620
They knew that Hitler used all these things. Actually, they told me. So I was amazed how did they know?

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.620
I dared not say this before because everyone who is following all these tantrikas would have been angry with me.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.640
But that’s what Hitler did.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.180
And so much they knew!

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.620
One of the boys was just, you can call him a hippie or whatever he may be.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.360
He went on the street shouting, “Oh, Mother has come now!

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.720
The Mother has come! The Holy Mother has come! What are you doing now?

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:23.060
Come along to the programme!” He was shouting on the street like “Eureka!”

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.560
And a learned man, in the real sense of the word.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.820
It’s such a pleasure to talk to them, such a pleasure, I tell you.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.340
I think it is time that English should come down a little,

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:37.900
really.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.540
Australia again: just look at Australians,

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.240
they are supposed to be convicts.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.700
Supposed to be; I can’t understand.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.660
You see, this high-handedness, or we can call it

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.640
condescendingly to watch something

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.660
is not proper, it’s not proper.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.400
You must come down in humility, otherwise things will not work out,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.400
I can tell you. You have to humble down.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:11.780
We have Hampstead: so what?

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.420
What have you done to Blake?

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.220
Can you understand him?

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.680
Do you know who he was?

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.760
Do you know what he wanted to say?

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.980
What he wanted to communicate?

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.060
Even in his programme, where I went,

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:37.480
to see his beautiful paintings, people were watching how many nude women and nude men he has produced.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:45.380
With all this, and this [low] level, I just couldn’t understand it.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.100
You must understand holiness.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.040
You must understand auspiciousness. You must understand sublime things.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.660
Something great that is beyond

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.260
just now, but is within your reach because you are sublime.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.640
You are not a low-level animal.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.920
You are sublime.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.460
You are the Spirit.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.100
Unless and until you really assume that situation

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
with that pride and glory,

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.840
to God you are nothing.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.020
You are just zero, useless.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.720
And this is what I’ll find always, new people coming,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.340
even in your Hampstead, Magda, and they just disappear.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.140
It’s like one lecture, it’s free. “All right, let’s go and see Mother.”That’s all.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.820
All these experiences, even in a country like Portugal,

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.180
Portugal.

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:46.320
The way people have done, Sahaja Yoga is remarkable.

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.620
I go there for three days only.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:54.240
Only for three days in a year. I must have gone there only twice so far.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.060
Look at them:

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.880
young people taking up responsibility, working it out for their country.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.880
So much they understand of auspiciousness.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.560
How have we lost all that sense of holiness and auspiciousness?

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.340
We are running after people who are collecting money from you,

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.880
giving you a circus.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.000
How can you?

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.640
How can you not find out that this is not the truth, that you have to be the truth,

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.000
that you are something great?

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.560
Why can’t we assume that situation?

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.740
We are not our ego.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.320
No, we are not.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.220
We are the Spirit,the sublime, the great.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.200
And that’s what I find.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.980
Many new people coming, then they disappear, then they come after ten days,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.980
then after they come after one month.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.480
They have this problem, that problem.

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.260
Then why not grow?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.180
When are we going to grow?

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:57.520
When are we going to become fully that?

00:25:57.740 --> 00:25:59.740
Time is very short, my children.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.860
Time is very, very short. Believe me.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:06.780
Some people advise me, “Mother, you have to be very strict and all that.”

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.420
I don’t know how a Mother could be strict.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:14.060
What should I do? Because, you cannot force it on anyone.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.420
The problem [I have / I’m helpless], is I cannot force it on to you

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.960
This is a big problem. You must understand this. You are seekers.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:30.560
You are seekers of very great times, born in this great country of yours, but so much conditioned.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.840
This is for you to take it within yourself, what you are, and to achieve that.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.560
This is something cannot be forced.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:48.420
I cannot mischievously do something or cleverly do something or cunningly say something to convince you.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:52.080
It is not that. It is something that has to happen within you,

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.520
that you have to be something more than what you are.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.800
It’s that concern of Mine

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.800
because it’s my job

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.120
that keeps me here.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:14.400
You must know your real Self which is seeking,

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.320
which is seeking the truth.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.600
It will never be satisfied with all these monkey tricks that people are indulging into.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.940
It’s no monkey tricks.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.160
You don’t become a monkey,

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.900
like dancing, jumping, singing.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.360
This is not the thing.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.260
In your awareness, in your central nervous system

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.700
you should feel the presence of your Spirit.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.140
That’s it.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.500
If you have discarded Christianity ?

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.840
like, some people write to me,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.820
“Mother, I have many problems. First begins with Christianity” ?

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.120
where do you land?

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.860
Even if you discard Christianity you can’t do without Christ.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.120
Christ is there. I mean, Christ is our soul. We cannot do without Him.

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:06.100
Then you come into another thing,

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.440
then you fall into another trap, then fall into another trap.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.240
You miss the essence of it every time you fall into these peripheries.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.820
The essence is in the centre of it and that centre is within you; is your Spirit.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.840
You may ask me a hundred questions, I will give you two hundred answers;

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:30.020
makes no difference at all, I tell you.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.860
It is of no value,

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.500
of no availability

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.100
to you or any goodness out of it you, believe me.

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.020
You have to be what you are.

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.700
Unless and until that happens and you establish it within yourself,

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:48.420
it’s such a waste of life, waste of this Creation,

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.480
everything I feel wasted.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.180
So I have to request you again and again.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:58.380
Of course, in London now there are some very great Sahaja yogis, no doubt,

00:28:59.280 --> 00:28:59.980
we have,

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.440
but the way it has been progressing if I were in any other country, I tell you,

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.620
things would have been very different.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:11.440
I can assure you this one, any other country.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.260
America? I’ve been there only once.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.320
Can you believe it?

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.440
Long time back, that too for about

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
four, five days, and this time when I went

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:22.620
I was hardly in any place for more than three days.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.820
Say, Houston, hardly for three days and how many people there are.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.460
I mean, you don’t know. Ask Gavin, he’ll tell you.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.820
What’s wrong with us? Let’s see.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.160
I just can’t understand

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.380
why we can’t grow.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:48.460
Why can’t we give up our conditionings easily and take to truth and get into it?

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:56.080
We don’t understand is it the importance of this time,

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:02.020
the vital nature of this happening.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.300
Or have we lost that sense of seriousness

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.520
where an emergency of this kind has arisen today which we don’t feel or fathom?

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.840
Or we just think that it’s just a joke going on?

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.380
Or our life we treat is just like

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.580
a joke or a frivolous thing?

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.660
What is it?

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.940
I still can’t understand what stops that truth…

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.320
beyond me.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.960
The land is fertile, beautiful.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.200
I am not sown my seeds in a wrong land;

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.740
I know that.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.060
But doesn’t grow; it doesn’t grow.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.380
It doesn’t take shape.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.880
What’s the matter?

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.040
Today there are new people, I am happy to know,

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.440
and I have to make a humble request to all of you.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.560
If you have to come to Sahaja Yoga

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.340
you have to be people who have to understand that reality is not a joke.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.840
It’s not a frivolous thing.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.720
You have to become

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.960
a realised-soul

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:25.580
and you have to grow in the light of that Realisation and you have to master this art.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.720
We need now masters all over.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.040
Not that somebody else is your master but you become your own master.

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.360
Such people are needed to channelise the energy of God.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.980
I am sure

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.100
Warren must have told you all about it.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.620
He’s another great character I have;

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.060
very proud of him,

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.420
the way he feels responsible for the whole world,

00:31:58.580 --> 00:31:59.700
the way he came down.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.440
He sacrificed so much, so much.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.220
I mean we, I don’t need any money from an, anything as such,

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:10.100
but even money-wise I am sure he must have done something.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.820
I don’t know because I have never taken any money from him as such.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.060
But even there I am sure,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.060
he established an ashram, he established people, he got them, he worked it out.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.380
I mean it’s remarkable, and how people followed him, seeing him the way he is.

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:31.800
He doesn’t have any private life left except for to enjoy this privacy of the Spirit with others,

00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:37.140
and if you see his background

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.240
he’ll tell you that he knew he was a seeker

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.720
but in the seeking he committed so many mistakes, so many mistakes.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.680
But look at his sensitivity.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:50.420
He knows where the Kundalini is,

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:55.540
he knows how to correct it and not him but most of the people from Australia know it so well.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.840
It’s nothing mundane.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.780
It will be very sad

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.500
and unhappy if you people get your Realisation

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.340
and lose it and do not develop into it.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.660
I don’t know what would be the category of such people

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.880
whom God has given the light and they didn’t give light to anyone.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.640
I don’t know what should be the position.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:28.260
Today I am rather concerned,

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.180
very much concerned because I have come back from these three countries.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.060
I was amazed.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.560
France: tremendous.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.960
French people,

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.660
I used to always say that these “les miserables” and all that.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.420
Nothing of the kind.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.260
There’s a priest who got his Realisation.

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.940
He formed an association called “Saving the people from gurus.”

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.580
Very clever,

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.860
and he is a priest still,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.600
but he is a Sahaja yogi out and out.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.060
And what he does,  those people who go to him and tell against the Christianity

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.060
he said,“Why don’t you go to Sahaja Yoga?”

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.140
Anybody whom he saves, he sends them to Sahaja Yoga…

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:22.640
all that.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
But the other day he said, “Mother, why should we have Pope anymore?”

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:28.940
Look at that.

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.720
And he stays in the church and works for Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.200
Can you beat that?

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.540
Because he thinks he has to save people who are misled.

00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.820
He does that.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.820
We have people of that calibre.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.140
Another one we met,

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.520
another one very great one,

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.180
in Portugal.

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:57.140
He told me that the T.M. gentleman wanted to establish his kingdom in Portugal.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.440
He’s got a very big land and all that.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.300
And he told me all the secrets.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.840
He said, “I am going to talk to the people who are in charge here.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.780
They are sensible.”

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.720
I said, “Really? Are you sure?”

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.380
I said, “If you want to talk to anybody here in Mentmore, they’ll not listen.. They are very satisfied

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.480
with the yards of black suits they are wearing

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:22.300
and with the so-called idea of sitting on a gold gilded chair.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:27.960
All that stupidity.” He said, “No, not in Portugal. They are very sensible people.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.200
They realise it. I am going to talk to them.”

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.140
Because they are all suffering

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:36.760
so early. Only three years they have been doing it.

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:41.000
They are all suffering on the left side, their ears are finished, somebody’s eyes are finished,

00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:45.560
somebody’s problem is on the left side, somebody has a problem on the left Void and all that.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.620
I cured, of course.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.900
But they said, “All of us are suffering.”

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.700
That means they are very sensitive also to suffer so fast.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.840
And they are realising, they are reaching all of them, even their administrators and their;

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.880
everybody’s realising that there’s some sort of a nonsense going on in this T.M.

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.680
Just imagine.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.480
When I went back,

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.440
so transformed and changed.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.580
The one gentleman had an eye like this.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.140
It’s all opened out equally the same, everything,face so transformed.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.280
I said, “I can’t recognise you, the way you are changed.”

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.720
Such a short time, in eight days,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.320
they worked it out.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.080
Portugal is a country known for its escape nowadays.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:44.160
There are nobody, we should call,the real Portuguese

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.460
have run away from that country.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.040
They are settled in Brazil.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:53.220
Spain, people have not much hopes from Spain, politically.It’s a hopeless country, they say.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.380
Italy is the worst of all. They have Mafia, this.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.660
And in that Maya

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.080
these beautiful lotuses to see.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.920
What a joy it was;

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.380
what a joy.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.540
You can’t imagine.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.580
Even our Ambassador in Spain said, “The people here are very different, Mother.”

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.260
He said, “I talked to some people. They said, ‘When She is coming you have to call us.’”

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:25.180
I said, “Next year you have a big program. This year let’s have only the Indians.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.340
But next year, of course, you can call.”

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.720
You see, all of them here want to have Realisation.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.380
All big people, eminent people.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.760
You just come next year and you’ll see all of them.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.400
Here, do you think anybody?

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.800
An ambassador, can you imagine?

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.540
I can’t think.

00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:53.740
Very funny people.

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.100
I’ve met a very big man once in a dinner party

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:04.020
where one of the Sahaja yogis is the chairman of the Hague High Court, of course an Indian, Dr. Nagen Singh.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.960
And he told that gentleman that,

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:13.580
“This lady is a very well-known spiritual leader of India and She has given Realisation to many

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.360
and She has given Realisation to me also.”

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.220
He looked at me and he said, “No, I am also a realised-soul.”

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.500
What to say?

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.460
He said, “Christ has given me Realisation.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.580
It’s Christ who is going to give me.”

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:37.420
So Nagen Singh in Hindi says,“There are no vibrations,the Kundalini is frozen

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.280
and this one is saying. How can Christ give him Realisation?”

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:44.320
I said, “This is the escape because Christ is no more.”

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.440
Of course, Christ gives him but where is Christ within himself?

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.140
So he asked him, “Where is Christ within yourself?”

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.020
“That Christ knows himself.”

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.300
He said, “I didn’t know these people were such buffoons.”

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.440
Really, these were his words.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.140
And my husband then couldn’t bear it any more

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.200
He said “Now, forget it.” You see, he was such a blind man.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.120
I mean, in India people may not get Realisation,

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.920
may not, but they know what is Realisation.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:21.260
They know who is truthful,

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.320
I must say.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.620
Whether they are ambassadors or Presidents, make no difference;

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.180
they know that definitely.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.700
Even President of India, say,

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.140
if he sees me he doesn’t sit down.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.860
He’ll stand up.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.840
They have that sense.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.020
That basic humility is missing.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.280
That’s why we take to people who pamper our ego.

00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.280
We take to people who are nonsensical.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.980
We take to people who befool us.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.840
Only the egoistical can be befooled.

00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:02.780
If you are not egoistical no one can befool you

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.860
How do you befool a person?

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.320
By pampering the ego.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.580
So one has to understand

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.860
that unless and until we develop that basic humility within ourselves

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.080
we are not going to do very well in England.

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.420
It’s for all the Sahaja yogis as well as for people who have come here.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:27.100
It’s a very, very, serious problem,

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:36.820
and you are placed in the most vital parts of the universe that is this England, that’s the Heart.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:42.620
And if you now any way escape your responsibility,

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.360
you will be held responsible,

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.860
I am telling you now very strongly.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.940
Because today I had big lectures from people saying that,

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.980
“Mother, you don’t say things strongly, and people are to be frightened.”

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.840
I don’t want to frighten you but you will be held responsible,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:01.780
take it from me.

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.540
You are born on this Earth,

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.100
on this

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.340
great land

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.680
for a very great purpose,

00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.160
to create Jerusalem out of that.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.160
And now if you are not going to stand up,

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.640
you’ll be held responsible.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.700
This is what it is.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.740
It’s a tremendous work one has to do,

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.340
for which you must prepare yourself

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.780
Get to it.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.740
I can give Realisation;  that’s all.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.980
But I can’t give you strength.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.980
I mean, you can’t make the horse stand up on his forelegs, can you?

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.820
It’s a very, very, desperate situation sometimes the way things happen.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:50.540
After all, you must know that My coming here has some meaning of.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:53.140
I didn’t come here because

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.580
I chose to come in the way people,

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.820
the gurus walk into your country.

00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.140
I came here because something was done spontaneously.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:07.680
I had to stay here, I had to work for you,

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:13.540
I had to implore you and request you and tell you in every way possible your responsibility.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:19.240
But then you don’t tell me because I have not failed in my duties as far as I’m concerned.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.720
Of that I am very sure.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.100
But now I’ll leave it to you

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.380
because I may not be here next year. What can you say?

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.300
Depends on the moods.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.420
But we have to see what you are going to do for the whole world,

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.720
for the whole emancipation of the human being.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.840
First you have to find your own beauty

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.620
and you have to give this beauty to others.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:48.100
This is a greatest artist’s job you have to do,

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.820
as a great master of art in divine life.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.380
You have to become divine.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:56.560
It’s you who has to become divine.

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.040
You don’t worry about me.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.780
I don’t have to achieve anything.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:03.240
That’s the only problem.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.580
I don’t have to achieve it.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.840
I have to only achieve you people.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:20.700
I have to only have ways and methods by which I could really make you grow.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:30.740
All that is possible I will do, but you must stand up on your legs, must ask for it.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:34.780
It’s a big problem.

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.760
Not for others; for me.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.280
Because others have no such problem.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.160
They don’t want you to stand on your legs.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.260
They want you to crawl and they want you to disappear.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.860
This is a different thing. I want you to grow,

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.160
not because I want, but Divine wants it.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.040
The whole Creation wants it.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.600
Otherwise it will have no meaning.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.440
So the responsibility of English Sahaja yogis,

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.440
British Sahaja yogis is very great.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:10.340
Again and again I have requested you and I have told you in whatever way possible,

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.420
that establish yourself.

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.740
You are lagging behind.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.940
I can tell you Spanish people will have to come and teach you Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.760
Already we have got somebody from Australia to teach that.

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.980
You give up your old ideas and conditioning.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:32.680
Every Saturday, Sunday, must you go out of the country, out of London?

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.300
London is your place where you have to work.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.500
Unless and until you take it up upon yourself it’s not going to work out.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.500
Some people have to do it, someone.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:56.800
I am looking out for such people for whom this is their desire.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:01.920
We talk of big things. If we talk to anyone, I see in big, big parties they talk,

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.940
“Oh, what’s this?” and “We must become peaceful countries.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.800
We must do this and that must happen.”

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:13.720
And even if you’ll listen to the lecture of our great President of America,

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.380
you find, “Oh God, some angel is speaking,” or what?

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.200
Like an angel, they speak.

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:25.280
Angelic, prophetic, such big, big, words. I can’t understand even

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:32.320
it won’t come into the mouth of God Himself but the way people talk, ultimately what remains is nothing.

00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.540
So let us be that, what we talk.

00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.080
We can be.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.300
We all can be. It’s very simple.

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.260
You have to decide.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.000
You have to really decide. The time has come.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:57.160
I just pray may God give you strength to stand with the truth.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.380
It’s not difficult.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.340
It’s very joy-giving. But stand with it, grow with it.

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.060
That’s what you are. Thank you very much.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:18.500
Now if you have any questions you can ask me and we should have Realisation.

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.320
Hello.

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.040
What’s that? What’s that here?

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:39.200
Right Swadisthana. She’s showing right Swadisthana.

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:47.900
Oh, all right. Now you take this one.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.820
They are fighting. They are fighting, see, working it out.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.260
They are all fighting.

00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.780
How is your child,[Graham]?

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.500
That same thing?

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.040
Much less.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:41.720
Your Agnya? Have you brought her?

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:47.700
No, because I haven’t the right, because she has [just come out of / to stay in the] hospital two or three weeks.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.060
“All right. On my way back if we have time I will go for see her.

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.700
That child is fighting.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.500
What sufferings from the very beginning of life.

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.460
That house also I think has problems.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:19.100
No questions? Are there any questions please?

00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:28.080
Yes?

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:38.300
I’m from Holland and I wonder whether I should try to stay in England, in London for, should I remain in England to find work? ”

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.080
It’s difficult to find?

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:49.100
I am wondering whether I should try to find work here in England or, do you understand what I am saying?

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.240
You are English?

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.220
No, Holland.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:51.840
Yes?

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.620
Holland.

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:53.380
Holland?

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.700
Yes.Oh, we need people in Holland.

00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:00.060
I haven’t yet touched it.

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.160
Excuse me?

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.240
I haven’t yet touched Holland.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:08.800
Haven’t been there. I went there once, a long time back, but we have to touch Holland

00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:12.680
There are lots of seekers, no doubt, but

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.220
drinking too much.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:25.520
Yeah. They drink too much, they told me, like Scotland, see,

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.320
chana. All right, you eat chana

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.300
and we have to look after them, no doubt.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.060
There are lots of seekers misled there are.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.620
In Holland we have one great soul.

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:43.080
There’s a young boy of sixteen years, I think. Careen, his name is.

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.960
They asked him about his father, mother, everything.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.800
He said, “my father is just like other fathers.”

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:51.820
I said, “Really? What does he do?”

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.440
“In the daytime he drinks beer. In the night he drinks whisky.”

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:00.940
I said, “Really?” “All fathers do that, Mother.”

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:03.680
“And what about the children?”

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:09.780
“Some of us, our friends, we meditate but most of them also are drinking beer.”

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:13.740
When he was twelve years he first came.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:15.660
I think twelve or eight years he came here, I think.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.740
Yes, and he must be sixteen now, yes.

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:21.400
Wonderful man. He is growing up there.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:24.480
I told him to gather more people who think like him.

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.140
He might, he is a great person.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:33.060
His mother is French and father is this thing and divorced and another mother,

00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.320
all kinds of problems.

00:50:35.820 --> 00:50:39.300
No, would be better in Holland, no doubt, but you get your Realisation,

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:43.900
you settle down here and we must start a centre in Holland and next year I am coming down there,

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:45.200
all right?

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.280
Holland is one place I have not been. I didn’t go to Austria.

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.100
Now, we have a very powerful yogi there. So I am going this year.

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.600
A few countries I have not tackled.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.740
We should not go away from our country.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.160
We should work there.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:00.700
That’s the place we have to work, whatever is the condition.

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:06.260
Switzerland now are doing very well. Switzerland is doing so well.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:11.340
Those who were committing suicide are now coming to Sahaja Yoga and doing very well.

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:16.260
I said, “The way you [are/were] doing suicide, if you can do Sahaja Yoga even once it will be all right.”

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.500
Because they did a perfect job always with their suicide things.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:26.320
They used to plan it out so well, the suicide,

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:31.360
in such a way, I mean, that it would not create any problems for anyone and sort of thing.

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:38.600
They used to think about it all the time, how to commit suicide, and they, very great planning.

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:41.980
But look at Switzerland.

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.600
It’s a challenge to all of you.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.300
So it’s a good idea.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:00.940
You get your Sahaja Yoga here, settle down, master it and go to Holland.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:06.700
You would be the one of the—- I gave once a Realisation to one Mr. called August Tigger.

00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:12.400
He was the chairman of your, one of your very big companies.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:18.460
He was a very big man, no doubt, but he told me that,

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:22.880
“I cannot talk about to anyone. They will think I have gone crazy.”

00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.260
And he died.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.380
He was a very old man when I met him.

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.620
He was about eighty years of age when I first met him.

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.300
And a very great seeker he was, very great seeker.

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.380
Holland I’ll definitely come, no doubt.

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.380
And now we have reached Brussels also.

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.280
So in Brussels and Holland we can do it, isn’t it?

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:57.300
From Brussels it is easier to go to Amsterdam.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:00.060
Where will you be in Holland?

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.060
I have no place at all.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:02.660
Huh.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.660
have no place [where] to go for the moment.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.540
But you will be placed in Holland?

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.700
Then I have to go back. I have to.

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:12.320
Yes, you should, you should.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:19.080
You see, I would request you, once you become a Sahaja yogi, you should go there,

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.240
and we’ll send some people to help you also.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.720
There is somebody very powerful in Brussels,

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.220
Very powerful in Brussels, who’ll help you, very powerful.

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:29.740
You remember that Rajneesh fellow who came?

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.200
Oh, he’s so powerful.

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.340
You must see that.

00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:40.040
He’s brought about ten people from Brussels to Lille.

00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:43.580
Can you imagine?

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.420
He’s already started his own centre.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.480
It can only work in the democratic countries, isn’t it?

00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.980
And I think Holland is very important.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.900
And who is there is Dr Nagen Singh himself, is there in Holland.

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.140
He’s in Hague.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.240
Is he?

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.780
He’s in Hague.He’s the Chairman of your World Court.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:59.800
Look, what? What? Anand? Anand. This is Anand. Ananad. And this is?

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:05.420
Sonu. Sonu. Sonu. Say Sonu.

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.140
He’s a real joker, I tell you.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.660
What makes you laugh so much and look here?

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.420
All right now. Sit down, you sit down there.

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:32.260
Sit down. All right. Be a nice girl, all right?

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:36.540
Ha, now sit down. Yes, we have to raise their Kundalini.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:43.600
Ha, come along, come along, come along, come along, come along now.) How is she [unclear name]?

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.600
All right now

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:47.720
Better?

00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:58.000
She is better. How is the baby from Australia? Is he all right? Is he all right?

00:55:58.380 --> 00:55:59.300
Much better.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:05.980
Much better now. I am sorry that day you had gone away.I wanted to see the baby.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:20.240
What? Ha. Ha. Hop. Hop.

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:28.480
Ha, up, up. Hop. Hop.

00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:35.620
Now, hop, hop. Come, come. Anna, come, come.

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.620
These children.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:07.560
Give her, give her chana. Good.

00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.100
Give her some, give her, give some chana. Give her some chana.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.580
All right. Go and give her some chana. All right? Take this one

00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:22.200
You give her. I told you to give her.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.480
All right, let’s have it, for that.

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:36.740
See how cheerful they are, how cheerful. All right, now we are going to keep quiet.Sit down here, sit down.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.800
All of us are going to sit down.

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:41.660
All right? Sit down. Come here. Come here. Sit down.

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.020
All sit down. You sit down. Olympia.

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:49.880
You sit down. All right? Sit down. All right. Be a nice girl. Now, it’s all right.Let her be.

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:56.580
She is not well. She is still little. All right, she’ll come.

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.040
She’s, she will come.

00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:05.840
She can’t leave. She can’t enjoy herself, see. That’s what it is; everybody must enjoy.

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.980
All right. Now close your eyes, please. Just close your eyes.

00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.320
Put both your feet on the ground.

00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.820
Now, take out your shoes. Shoes, shoes.
