WEBVTT

00:41.020 --> 00:43.660
Nice to be back again in Hampstead.

00:44.120 --> 00:47.660
I always enjoyed Hampstead

00:50.880 --> 00:54.700
because,as I have told, you in London,

00:56.700 --> 00:59.000
many people who were

01:00.680 --> 01:04.820
great spiritual lived in this area.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.980
They preferred it to other places.

01:12.740 --> 01:19.040
So I believe that many people who live in this area

01:20.840 --> 01:23.240
must be also spiritual,

01:24.640 --> 01:32.400
must have taken their birth with the idea of achieving their Self-Realisation.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.920
It’s a very important t ime: when you are born.

01:39.460 --> 01:43.580
It’s the most important in the history of the universe.

01:45.500 --> 01:49.440
You are created a human being to become your Spirit.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.880
There’s nothing in between.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.740
If you have intelligence, pure intelligence,

01:55.880 --> 01:57.880
you can see through all that.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.620
You have to test your intelligence on this.

02:03.020 --> 02:06.400
Whatever we think and whatever we conceive

02:07.160 --> 02:12.860
and whatever we try to organise ourselves into,

02:13.560 --> 02:15.620
mostly comes from our conditionings,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
not from the Spirit, because we have not touched the Spirit.

02:20.700 --> 02:27.800
But innately we have got a sense to know

02:29.120 --> 02:31.200
that these are very important times;

02:32.620 --> 02:35.360
that there must be something great in the atmosphere,

02:35.400 --> 02:37.180
that there are so many people who are seeking.

02:39.760 --> 02:43.240
It’s something remarkable. If this misses your attention,

02:43.240 --> 02:45.240
that means you are not alert.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.800
There are people of all types, all kinds. But seekers

02:52.660 --> 02:55.240
of this calibre have been very few.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.400
Now England has its own problems,

03:00.560 --> 03:02.660
and London has its own peculiarities.

03:06.500 --> 03:10.300
Despite the fact I have been in London for about

03:12.040 --> 03:14.040
eight and a half years,

03:15.160 --> 03:17.300
I feel that

03:18.600 --> 03:22.340
the reception of the truth has been very, very poor.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.440
Maybe, I am luckier than others.

03:30.640 --> 03:37.420
It’s the conditioning, again I would say, of another type

03:39.040 --> 03:42.200
that prevails [in] the minds.

03:43.680 --> 03:48.100
First we had, about twenty-five years back

03:48.480 --> 03:50.740
the conditioning of the science,

03:51.720 --> 03:54.240
but scientists themselves have refuted it.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.320
They themselves have challenged the science

03:57.120 --> 04:00.300
and they themselves know that it’s not such a happy affair,

04:00.440 --> 04:02.220
just to be a scientist.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.520
Then comes the intellectuals.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.960
The books started pouring in, in the market:

04:07.960 --> 04:10.660
all kinds of books.You can read about everything.

04:10.660 --> 04:12.660
Everyone knows about everything!

04:13.880 --> 04:16.080
And once you start reading about them,

04:18.420 --> 04:20.200
you conceive something;

04:20.200 --> 04:23.140
your conceptions are built about the truth also.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.580
The thing you have never seen,

04:26.580 --> 04:29.380
the thing you have never felt, you cannot conceive it,

04:30.760 --> 04:32.460
it is to be seen.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.780
Like I had never seen Hampstead before,

04:37.220 --> 04:40.640
and the first idea of my husband was to buy a house in Hampstead

04:41.900 --> 04:44.140
it’s surprising! I was very happy at that point.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.300
So I said, “Let’s go and see!”

04:48.720 --> 04:52.600
Without seeing it, if I had some conception about it,

04:53.640 --> 04:55.360
it would have been wrong.

04:55.560 --> 04:58.320
My seeing is different from others, I must say.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.700
I liked the place immensely,

05:00.860 --> 05:03.660
but he,from the point of view [of] distances and all of that he said,

05:03.660 --> 05:07.380
“It’s not good.” And naturally his ideas prevailed;doesn’t matter.

05:08.940 --> 05:14.100
But seeing, itself, makes you understand.

05:17.100 --> 05:20.480
But what is Self-Realisation? It’s not only seeing.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.040
When you come to Hampstead you don’t see it.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.480
You feel it.

05:26.660 --> 05:34.560
You feel it. Now many people say you can feel it, but the idea of feeling is also quite conditioned.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.880
Like, some children like to cuddle a little doll.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.640
They feel the doll. But God knows how far they feel it.

05:45.820 --> 05:47.820
They might be feeling it physically,

05:47.840 --> 05:53.620
or emotionally also they might be feeling some sort of a security with the doll, maybe.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.360
Psychologically they might be deriving some joy out of that

05:57.960 --> 05:59.320
doll itself.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.960
Or maybe the image,

06:02.140 --> 06:05.200
which has some sort of an attraction

06:07.440 --> 06:10.360
of some sort of a thing that is built within their unconscious,

06:11.360 --> 06:13.360
that they feel so close to that.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.700
But a person who is a realised-soul

06:20.000 --> 06:22.380
does not feel a doll that way, even if it’s a child.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.900
It’s surprising. You must watch a realised child

06:29.980 --> 06:32.700
getting to a doll. It’s very surprising.

06:33.640 --> 06:39.280
For example, I bought two dolls from London for my grandchildren and they rejected completely.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.300
They said, “What sort of dolls these are?” I said, “Why?”

06:43.000 --> 06:45.600
“They are unhappy!” I said, “They are not unhappy.”

06:46.020 --> 06:47.640
“No, see their lips!”

06:47.880 --> 06:51.800
You see, the lips of the dolls here is all just like a duck’s beak.

06:53.220 --> 06:56.700
They said, “They have resentment. They are angry.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.960
They are not realised!”

07:02.860 --> 07:04.860
That’s it!

07:06.100 --> 07:10.540
If you are a happy person then the whole get-up of your face changes,

07:13.720 --> 07:15.740
and they could see, they could feel it.

07:15.740 --> 07:17.740
They rejected: “We don’t want these dolls.”

07:20.000 --> 07:22.380
And then next time when I had to go I had to go

07:22.900 --> 07:25.260
round the whole places. First of all they were plastics;

07:25.260 --> 07:27.260
so plastics they don’t like.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.660
They don’t like plastic. Somehow realised people don’t like plastics,automatically.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.740
They wouldn’t wear plastic clothes,  they wouldn’t wear nylon clothes,

07:35.740 --> 07:37.740
they wouldn’t wear mixed clothes: very difficult.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.780
They must have cotton clothes. Even if they have one, they’ll wear that the whole day,

07:41.780 --> 07:44.260
morning, evening, every time, the same thing.

07:45.320 --> 07:49.340
You see, it’s a different sensitivity which we do not have before Realisation.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.860
They have a different sensitivity.

07:51.860 --> 07:58.180
And the coefficients of a doll which emits vibrations they like.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.000
But it’s very difficult to get such dolls nowadays; impossible.

08:01.600 --> 08:07.780
Because where are these artists who are realised-souls who used to make dolls?

08:10.260 --> 08:12.260
I have seen they make their own dolls,

08:13.540 --> 08:16.760
out of something:. sometimes my saris they will use or something.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.240
And sleep with those.

08:21.960 --> 08:25.240
It’s something to be understood that, after Realisation,

08:25.900 --> 08:31.580
the thing you feel is not what you feel through your heart or through your conditioning of ages, also, maybe.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.580
Like if you have been living with a woman

08:35.260 --> 08:37.260
for many years with blue eyes,

08:38.300 --> 08:40.580
then you may like a doll with blue eyes. You may,

08:41.160 --> 08:43.160
because you have that image into your head.

08:44.380 --> 08:47.380
You may like. Or you may have a nanny of with blue eyes

08:47.500 --> 08:49.120
you may like a doll like that.

08:49.120 --> 08:51.940
It’s all psychological.  It’s conditioning very deep in you.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.520
But Spirit has no conditioning. It’s a free thing.

08:56.380 --> 09:02.420
What does it feel? It feels the joy of Creation,

09:05.080 --> 09:06.220
which we cannot.

09:06.360 --> 09:08.360
Before Realisation we cannot feel.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.940
You see, when we see something, where is the joy?

09:12.220 --> 09:14.520
Now, for example, if a fussy man comes here he’ll say,

09:14.560 --> 09:17.940
“Oh, God, what a thing! I have to take out my shoes

09:18.040 --> 09:21.140
and sit like that! And the chairs were horrible!

09:21.740 --> 09:23.920
And couldn’t sit: very uncomfortable!

09:23.920 --> 09:25.920
And the colour was all white.”

09:26.080 --> 09:27.160
He couldn’t bear it.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.400
And I don’t know: all sorts of things.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.760
The thoughts will start.

09:34.460 --> 09:37.480
If you buy something – same thing.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.240
If you see something – same thing.

09:40.660 --> 09:42.200
There’s no joy!

09:42.340 --> 09:44.340
We just start thinking!

09:45.660 --> 09:49.920
Or if not, to avoid that, you may start a poetry about it.

09:50.660 --> 09:54.720
It’s sometimes so artificial, some of the poetry.

09:55.640 --> 09:59.760
So artificially put there that you can see it clearly

09:59.760 --> 10:04.800
clearly that this man is just a sadist, wants to make you cry.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.080
Like Lord Byron!

10:06.080 --> 10:11.060
You can see it so clearly that this man has no sincerity of purpose.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.920
He’s not sincere.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.460
That sincerity you cannot feel

10:15.560 --> 10:17.560
unless and until you are realised

10:17.660 --> 10:19.660
because such a poem you won’t like at all,

10:19.960 --> 10:21.600
whether you understand the language or not.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.740
The whole tone of it will emit horrible vibrations;

10:25.160 --> 10:29.820
it’s absolutely the essence of everything is nothing but vibrations.

10:33.820 --> 10:37.520
Everything is nothing but vibrations; the rest is all zero.

10:38.740 --> 10:40.800
We are nothing but our vibrations

10:41.300 --> 10:42.280
which are

10:45.700 --> 10:48.960
emitted because we are now connected with the Spirit.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.100
But otherwise also, whether you are connected with Spirit

10:52.100 --> 10:53.960
or not, you emit vibrations.

10:53.960 --> 10:58.440
But these are the vibrations without the light in it,

10:58.860 --> 11:01.980
and you can feel the vibrations of a person out and out.

11:04.020 --> 11:06.600
You can feel, feel how.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.500
You can feel on your centres.

11:09.620 --> 11:14.040
All your centres become active and you start feeling on your centres.

11:14.920 --> 11:18.140
That means all these five centres, six, seven centres you start feeling.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.400
Even you may not feel in your fingers.

11:20.400 --> 11:26.940
Some of us Sahaja yogis may not feel also even today after so many days because their Vishuddhi Chakra is very bad.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.200
They must have smoked in,  I think, ten lives,

11:34.560 --> 11:36.920
and must have been horrible Vishuddhi Chakra,

11:37.040 --> 11:42.600
and maybe that’s why it’s all on the myelin sheath of the nerves that you cannot feel it.

11:42.600 --> 11:43.800
That’s a different point.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.700
But you will feel it on your centres.

11:45.880 --> 11:50.140
And the feeling on the centre is emitted in your nervous system.

11:50.740 --> 11:55.420
And when it comes to it you feel it on your centres

11:56.560 --> 11:58.560
and you know, you just know.

12:01.280 --> 12:06.320
And you know it as vibratory awareness.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.060
This vibratory awareness has to grow, no doubt.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.280
The sensitivity has to grow, no doubt.

12:14.580 --> 12:16.580
But, first you must touch it.

12:18.260 --> 12:21.760
If it has not even touched, then how can it grow?

12:23.040 --> 12:27.160
But we are so conditioned that we take to things

12:27.620 --> 12:30.120
which superficially are very appealing.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.680
Sahaja Yoga is not like that.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.580
It’s truth. It’s reality.

12:36.660 --> 12:39.340
Of course, you cannot pay for reality. I mean, how can you pay?

12:39.340 --> 12:41.340
If it is reality, you cannot pay for it.

12:41.340 --> 12:42.220
That’s one simple thing.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.820
You cannot artificially say you are realised-soul.  You cannot.

12:45.820 --> 12:49.920
There was a girl, I met her in Portugal,

12:50.280 --> 12:53.640
mischievous one, and she wanted to stick on with the Sahaja yogis

12:53.640 --> 12:57.000
because she was very negative and she wanted to disturb the Sahaja yogis.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.580
And she came to the programme

13:00.100 --> 13:02.980
and she told me, “Oh, I am feeling very well, Mother. I am feeling vibrations!”

13:02.980 --> 13:04.520
I just looked at her.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.080
I kept quiet: because I knew she was not.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.540
I didn’t say anything. I didn’t want to create trouble.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.420
But second day when she turned up I said, “Why are you telling me lies?”

13:13.660 --> 13:15.660
“No, no, no!” I said, “Yes,

13:16.340 --> 13:19.240
you are telling me lies. You have to be sincere.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.360
What are you going to gain?”

13:21.500 --> 13:24.620
Say, you are mischievous.You are playing into the hands of negative forces:

13:24.780 --> 13:26.260
what is your gain?

13:26.420 --> 13:29.640
You are the Spirit. The Spirit is within you.

13:30.020 --> 13:31.420
You have to become the Spirit.

13:31.740 --> 13:36.180
It’s your own joy, is your own property, is your own Self:

13:37.300 --> 13:38.240
which is not known to you.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.640
Why not be honest about it

13:40.640 --> 13:42.740
and get to it instead of playing tricks

13:43.520 --> 13:44.260
with yourself?

13:44.720 --> 13:46.720
And then playing tricks with other Sahaja yogis:

13:47.340 --> 13:48.720
what is the use? What is the gain?

13:48.720 --> 13:51.220
Why are you playing into the hands of the satanic force?

13:51.900 --> 13:54.520
Why don’t you play into the hands of the Divine force?”

13:55.360 --> 13:56.940
She said, “No, no, Mother, I am feeling it!”

13:56.940 --> 13:58.340
I said, “See, don’t tell me lies.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.540
I know for definite you are not feeling it,

14:00.640 --> 14:03.920
and if you are not going to be honest you are not going to come to my programme at all.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.420
You have to be honest yourself.

14:06.740 --> 14:09.360
If you are not honest I am not going to have you here.”

14:09.980 --> 14:14.200
But dishonesty sometimes reaches a very absurd limit,

14:15.360 --> 14:19.480
because honesty is only up to which point you can see.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.160
Say, you can see the colour

14:23.440 --> 14:25.800
is white – up to that you are honest.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.440
But if you start saying, “I know who has painted it,

14:28.440 --> 14:31.540
and I know who has done the job and I know who is the company,”

14:31.540 --> 14:33.160
and all that, that’s not true.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.400
So honesty is up to the point you know.

14:36.940 --> 14:40.160
Beyond that, if you start saying things because you have read somewhere something

14:40.160 --> 14:41.760
or you have heard something,

14:41.920 --> 14:43.760
that’s wrong, that’s not being honest.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.480
So we have to have honesty and open-mindedness.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.800
You have to be open-minded and honest,

14:51.760 --> 14:53.460
so that you see for yourself.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.480
Because as I told you it’s not like other places where you can just go and become members– nothing.

14:59.220 --> 15:01.120
First you have get your Realisation.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.520
Secondly, you have to grow into it.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.140
Those who cannot do, will be left out.

15:08.820 --> 15:09.800
You can’t help it.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.720
How far can you move it people?

15:12.600 --> 15:13.920
How far can you tell them?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.420
There’s no binding force.

15:16.740 --> 15:20.180
You are completely free to leave it or to take it.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.220
If you want to take it,

15:22.280 --> 15:24.280
well and good. If you don’t want to take it,

15:24.540 --> 15:28.220
no one is going to force you at all in this,! Because you cannot force.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.820
You can force a horse to eat,

15:30.920 --> 15:32.160
that is possible;

15:32.760 --> 15:36.440
but you cannot force any human being to be a realised-soul.

15:36.440 --> 15:37.440
You cannot.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.300
Not only that he has to ask for it

15:41.060 --> 15:43.120
but he has to,later on, work for it.

15:43.580 --> 15:45.580
It is a tremendous thing you are asking for

15:46.180 --> 15:48.280
and it’s the greatest thing that you are achieving.

15:49.900 --> 15:52.180
It is made easy, I should say.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.460
The times are such. It looks easy but it’s not so easy.

15:58.900 --> 16:02.680
In Sahaja Yoga there are more drop-outs than sticking people.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.960
Naturally, because you have to be honest.

16:08.920 --> 16:10.920
You have to be very honest with it

16:11.460 --> 16:13.080
and you have to give a try.

16:13.780 --> 16:18.400
Like in Spain I met about five, six ladies

16:19.300 --> 16:21.300
and two men who came to see me.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.380
When I came out I was very reluctant

16:24.720 --> 16:26.300
to have anything to do with them.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.660
But, all the Sahaja yogis were so impressed.

16:28.660 --> 16:29.720
I don’t know why.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.440
“Oh, Mother they are so good. You don’t know,

16:33.440 --> 16:37.340
they came and looked at your photograph and they did this and all that.”

16:37.340 --> 16:40.320
I said, “Now, it’s all right if you want I will try!

16:40.320 --> 16:43.580
But somehow I don’t think much is going to work out.”

16:43.580 --> 16:47.680
And they thought they had found such a great bunch of people,

16:47.680 --> 16:50.240
who are real Sahaja yogis of the thing.

16:50.720 --> 16:52.440
I said, “Did you see their vibrations?”

16:52.580 --> 16:54.380
They said, “No, Mother we were waiting for you.”

16:54.380 --> 16:58.400
I said, “All right, doesn’t matter. I’ll have a look at them.”

17:01.820 --> 17:03.900
And they said,

17:04.620 --> 17:07.640
first question they asked,“Mother, why is it Sahaja yogis don’t smoke?”

17:09.760 --> 17:11.760
I said, “Because they don’t want to.”

17:12.440 --> 17:14.440
I mean, is that a question to ask?

17:14.660 --> 17:16.860
I mean, if you smoke is it very normal?

17:18.240 --> 17:19.840
I just couldn’t understand this question.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.240
She said, “No, we don’t want to lose our freedom

17:22.540 --> 17:24.820
of smoking and freedom of drinking.”

17:25.940 --> 17:27.940
I said, “Do you think you are free?

17:28.340 --> 17:29.480
You are a slave.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.700
You can’t give up even if you want to.

17:32.420 --> 17:37.160
I can free you from that or your Kundalini can free you but you cannot.

17:37.420 --> 17:39.120
Even if you want you cannot give up,

17:39.200 --> 17:40.660
but here they just give up.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.820
I don’t tell them, I never force them,

17:42.960 --> 17:47.940
but it just happens because if you get the nectar of life you don’t care for other nonsensical things.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.420
It’s simple as that.”

17:50.680 --> 17:53.100
But they were so frightened with the Sahaja yogis’ style of life,

17:53.100 --> 17:57.100
means they don’t smoke and drink every night, they said, “This is impossible”.

17:57.100 --> 17:57.900
They gave up.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.820
Can you imagine? At the first talk we had!

18:01.840 --> 18:05.420
But then we had people with such tremendous characters.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.060
They came for the program.

18:07.180 --> 18:11.260
I was so very happy, extremely happy and joyous.

18:11.580 --> 18:13.120
Everybody said, “Mother, why?”

18:14.160 --> 18:15.520
They were little, sometimes,

18:16.680 --> 18:20.080
not so much receptive, maybe, according to Sahaja yogis.

18:20.560 --> 18:23.200
But I could feel my vibrations sucked into them,

18:23.420 --> 18:27.600
absolutely flowing: the energy just getting into them,

18:28.060 --> 18:30.580
and suddenly they said, “Ah! Got it.”

18:32.780 --> 18:34.360
And tremendous people!

18:34.860 --> 18:38.400
Very well-educated also, some of them.

18:38.400 --> 18:44.280
But extremely well-versed about what we have to achieve.

18:44.440 --> 18:45.520
I was surprised

18:45.520 --> 18:50.000
in Spain there are people who know Sanskrit so well and about everything,

18:50.000 --> 18:51.520
about Chaitanya and all that.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.640
They know so well.

18:52.640 --> 18:57.320
It’s most surprising, and I used to think only scholarships exist in England.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.760
No. I was surprised.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.340
All of them knew about chakras.

19:04.540 --> 19:08.200
They knew about what it means. Everything they have sorted it out.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.180
I said,“When did you start?”

19:10.720 --> 19:13.140
They said, “About, when we were, I think, ten years of age.”

19:13.480 --> 19:15.600
I said, “Ten years of age? How?”

19:15.860 --> 19:19.120
They said, “We, we just couldn’t be satisfied with what was the answer here.”

19:19.800 --> 19:21.800
“Such grown-up people,” I said.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.400
From ten years of age. So many of them!

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
And you should have seen the way they were!

19:26.740 --> 19:32.400
And they recognise Sahaja Yoga and the tremendous effect it has and the work that it is doing.

19:33.760 --> 19:37.480
You will be amazed the way these people behaved towards Sahaj Yoga.

19:38.900 --> 19:43.260
Then I said, “Next time, I am not staying in London – Spain.”

19:44.820 --> 19:46.820
Yeah, really, I tell you!

19:48.240 --> 19:51.780
Just the kind of reception. There’s no barrier at all in their minds.

19:51.780 --> 19:55.800
It’s such pure intelligence, sharp, to see this is the thing

19:55.800 --> 19:57.300
– where are we running.

19:57.540 --> 20:01.300
And really I felt that, eight years I have wasted in this country, that time.

20:01.860 --> 20:04.760
Really for a moment I just felt, “Oh, God!”

20:05.440 --> 20:07.600
But you know the importance of this country is so great

20:07.600 --> 20:09.600
because it’s the heart of the universe.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.320
I have to labour through it! And such lethargy and such inertia

20:14.420 --> 20:17.260
and explanations.  Intellectuals have a very good,

20:18.500 --> 20:22.420
an easy-chair way of looking at things, very easy-chair way of looking at things.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.200
Easy-chair politicians they are.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.060
“Well, it’s very interesting.”

20:29.160 --> 20:33.360
Many a times I have heard [this], “It’s very interesting, you know, Mother, what you have given us.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.560
Very nice, yes, yes.”

20:36.980 --> 20:42.660
It’s very common! But there, for them, it was a heavenly gift because they knew what it was.

20:43.940 --> 20:46.260
What’s the use of all the scholarship of Lord Byron

20:46.960 --> 20:48.760
when you can’t recognise Christ?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.100
When you can’t recognise the truth?

20:52.040 --> 20:54.040
What’s this education for?

20:55.480 --> 21:00.940
I was amazed at these people. They never went to Cambridge and they were not Oxbridges.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.460
Most surprising!

21:05.400 --> 21:10.220
And they were people of great intelligence, very well-versed.

21:10.220 --> 21:11.520
And in Spain!

21:11.760 --> 21:12.780
Can you imagine?

21:13.900 --> 21:15.900
The same I will say of Italy.

21:16.780 --> 21:19.980
Italians are supposed to be very dishonest and this,  that, I have heard.

21:20.140 --> 21:22.060
Nobody was dishonest with me

21:22.140 --> 21:28.280
as far as I am concerned: very upright, straightforward and tremendous people.

21:32.460 --> 21:35.000
Just my photograph convinced them.

21:35.820 --> 21:39.400
They said, “The face shows!” They hate the Pope.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.940
They hate the Papal things. They know all about Pope. Everything they know.

21:44.200 --> 21:48.280
They have sorted out everything. But to know so much about chakras and things,

21:48.280 --> 21:49.660
I was amazed.

21:49.800 --> 21:53.200
They knew about tantrism. They knew that Hitler used tantrikas.

21:53.400 --> 21:57.620
They knew that Hitler used all these things. Actually, they told me. So I was amazed how did they know?

21:58.220 --> 22:03.620
I dared not say this before because everyone who is following all these tantrikas would have been angry with me.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.640
But that’s what Hitler did.

22:07.180 --> 22:09.180
And so much they knew!

22:10.140 --> 22:13.620
One of the boys was just, you can call him a hippie or whatever he may be.

22:14.480 --> 22:17.360
He went on the street shouting, “Oh, Mother has come now!

22:17.640 --> 22:19.720
The Mother has come! The Holy Mother has come! What are you doing now?

22:19.720 --> 22:23.060
Come along to the programme!” He was shouting on the street like “Eureka!”

22:24.420 --> 22:27.560
And a learned man, in the real sense of the word.

22:27.640 --> 22:31.820
It’s such a pleasure to talk to them, such a pleasure, I tell you.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.340
I think it is time that English should come down a little,

22:37.400 --> 22:37.900
really.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.540
Australia again: just look at Australians,

22:40.660 --> 22:42.240
they are supposed to be convicts.

22:43.820 --> 22:47.700
Supposed to be; I can’t understand.

22:49.640 --> 22:53.660
You see, this high-handedness, or we can call it

22:53.720 --> 22:56.640
condescendingly to watch something

22:57.160 --> 22:59.660
is not proper, it’s not proper.

23:00.800 --> 23:04.400
You must come down in humility, otherwise things will not work out,

23:04.400 --> 23:06.400
I can tell you. You have to humble down.

23:09.780 --> 23:11.780
We have Hampstead: so what?

23:13.420 --> 23:15.420
What have you done to Blake?

23:16.120 --> 23:17.220
Can you understand him?

23:21.140 --> 23:22.680
Do you know who he was?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.760
Do you know what he wanted to say?

23:24.980 --> 23:26.980
What he wanted to communicate?

23:27.280 --> 23:31.060
Even in his programme, where I went,

23:31.480 --> 23:37.480
to see his beautiful paintings, people were watching how many nude women and nude men he has produced.

23:39.720 --> 23:45.380
With all this, and this [low] level, I just couldn’t understand it.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.100
You must understand holiness.

23:48.160 --> 23:52.040
You must understand auspiciousness. You must understand sublime things.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.660
Something great that is beyond

23:57.240 --> 24:00.260
just now, but is within your reach because you are sublime.

24:00.640 --> 24:02.640
You are not a low-level animal.

24:02.760 --> 24:03.920
You are sublime.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.460
You are the Spirit.

24:07.640 --> 24:11.100
Unless and until you really assume that situation

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
with that pride and glory,

24:15.600 --> 24:16.840
to God you are nothing.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.020
You are just zero, useless.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.720
And this is what I’ll find always, new people coming,

24:24.900 --> 24:28.340
even in your Hampstead, Magda, and they just disappear.

24:28.540 --> 24:32.140
It’s like one lecture, it’s free. “All right, let’s go and see Mother.”That’s all.

24:35.340 --> 24:38.820
All these experiences, even in a country like Portugal,

24:39.960 --> 24:41.180
Portugal.

24:42.120 --> 24:46.320
The way people have done, Sahaja Yoga is remarkable.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.620
I go there for three days only.

24:50.380 --> 24:54.240
Only for three days in a year. I must have gone there only twice so far.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.060
Look at them:

24:58.200 --> 25:02.880
young people taking up responsibility, working it out for their country.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.880
So much they understand of auspiciousness.

25:07.320 --> 25:10.560
How have we lost all that sense of holiness and auspiciousness?

25:11.020 --> 25:13.340
We are running after people who are collecting money from you,

25:13.640 --> 25:14.880
giving you a circus.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.000
How can you?

25:18.700 --> 25:23.640
How can you not find out that this is not the truth, that you have to be the truth,

25:23.640 --> 25:25.000
that you are something great?

25:25.220 --> 25:27.560
Why can’t we assume that situation?

25:28.240 --> 25:29.740
We are not our ego.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.320
No, we are not.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.220
We are the Spirit,the sublime, the great.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.200
And that’s what I find.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.980
Many new people coming, then they disappear, then they come after ten days,

25:40.980 --> 25:42.980
then after they come after one month.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.480
They have this problem, that problem.

25:46.020 --> 25:47.260
Then why not grow?

25:48.820 --> 25:50.180
When are we going to grow?

25:52.420 --> 25:57.520
When are we going to become fully that?

25:57.740 --> 25:59.740
Time is very short, my children.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.860
Time is very, very short. Believe me.

26:03.660 --> 26:06.780
Some people advise me, “Mother, you have to be very strict and all that.”

26:06.840 --> 26:09.420
I don’t know how a Mother could be strict.

26:10.100 --> 26:14.060
What should I do? Because, you cannot force it on anyone.

26:14.320 --> 26:18.420
The problem [I have / I’m helpless], is I cannot force it on to you

26:19.360 --> 26:23.960
This is a big problem. You must understand this. You are seekers.

26:24.120 --> 26:30.560
You are seekers of very great times, born in this great country of yours, but so much conditioned.

26:30.860 --> 26:35.840
This is for you to take it within yourself, what you are, and to achieve that.

26:38.560 --> 26:40.560
This is something cannot be forced.

26:41.120 --> 26:48.420
I cannot mischievously do something or cleverly do something or cunningly say something to convince you.

26:48.420 --> 26:52.080
It is not that. It is something that has to happen within you,

26:52.340 --> 26:55.520
that you have to be something more than what you are.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.800
It’s that concern of Mine

27:00.700 --> 27:02.800
because it’s my job

27:06.760 --> 27:08.120
that keeps me here.

27:08.740 --> 27:14.400
You must know your real Self which is seeking,

27:15.060 --> 27:16.320
which is seeking the truth.

27:16.320 --> 27:20.600
It will never be satisfied with all these monkey tricks that people are indulging into.

27:22.540 --> 27:23.940
It’s no monkey tricks.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.160
You don’t become a monkey,

27:26.900 --> 27:28.900
like dancing, jumping, singing.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.360
This is not the thing.

27:30.920 --> 27:34.260
In your awareness, in your central nervous system

27:34.400 --> 27:37.700
you should feel the presence of your Spirit.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.140
That’s it.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.500
If you have discarded Christianity ?

27:44.360 --> 27:45.840
like, some people write to me,

27:46.000 --> 27:48.820
“Mother, I have many problems. First begins with Christianity” ?

27:49.900 --> 27:51.120
where do you land?

27:51.300 --> 27:55.860
Even if you discard Christianity you can’t do without Christ.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.120
Christ is there. I mean, Christ is our soul. We cannot do without Him.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.100
Then you come into another thing,

28:06.520 --> 28:09.440
then you fall into another trap, then fall into another trap.

28:10.640 --> 28:15.240
You miss the essence of it every time you fall into these peripheries.

28:15.480 --> 28:20.820
The essence is in the centre of it and that centre is within you; is your Spirit.

28:24.340 --> 28:27.840
You may ask me a hundred questions, I will give you two hundred answers;

28:27.900 --> 28:30.020
makes no difference at all, I tell you.

28:30.420 --> 28:31.860
It is of no value,

28:32.500 --> 28:34.500
of no availability

28:34.940 --> 28:38.100
to you or any goodness out of it you, believe me.

28:39.020 --> 28:41.020
You have to be what you are.

28:41.380 --> 28:44.700
Unless and until that happens and you establish it within yourself,

28:44.980 --> 28:48.420
it’s such a waste of life, waste of this Creation,

28:48.760 --> 28:50.480
everything I feel wasted.

28:52.180 --> 28:54.180
So I have to request you again and again.

28:54.380 --> 28:58.380
Of course, in London now there are some very great Sahaja yogis, no doubt,

28:59.280 --> 28:59.980
we have,

29:00.800 --> 29:05.440
but the way it has been progressing if I were in any other country, I tell you,

29:05.620 --> 29:07.620
things would have been very different.

29:08.020 --> 29:11.440
I can assure you this one, any other country.

29:12.100 --> 29:14.260
America? I’ve been there only once.

29:14.640 --> 29:15.320
Can you believe it?

29:15.440 --> 29:17.440
Long time back, that too for about

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
four, five days, and this time when I went

29:20.340 --> 29:22.620
I was hardly in any place for more than three days.

29:22.680 --> 29:26.820
Say, Houston, hardly for three days and how many people there are.

29:26.940 --> 29:29.460
I mean, you don’t know. Ask Gavin, he’ll tell you.

29:34.820 --> 29:36.820
What’s wrong with us? Let’s see.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.160
I just can’t understand

29:39.920 --> 29:41.380
why we can’t grow.

29:41.980 --> 29:48.460
Why can’t we give up our conditionings easily and take to truth and get into it?

29:49.380 --> 29:56.080
We don’t understand is it the importance of this time,

29:56.860 --> 30:02.020
the vital nature of this happening.

30:04.080 --> 30:08.300
Or have we lost that sense of seriousness

30:09.440 --> 30:14.520
where an emergency of this kind has arisen today which we don’t feel or fathom?

30:16.280 --> 30:19.840
Or we just think that it’s just a joke going on?

30:21.860 --> 30:24.380
Or our life we treat is just like

30:24.880 --> 30:26.580
a joke or a frivolous thing?

30:26.740 --> 30:27.660
What is it?

30:27.760 --> 30:31.940
I still can’t understand what stops that truth…

30:33.320 --> 30:35.320
beyond me.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.960
The land is fertile, beautiful.

30:42.760 --> 30:46.200
I am not sown my seeds in a wrong land;

30:46.760 --> 30:47.740
I know that.

30:48.060 --> 30:50.060
But doesn’t grow; it doesn’t grow.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.380
It doesn’t take shape.

30:54.520 --> 30:55.880
What’s the matter?

30:58.320 --> 31:01.040
Today there are new people, I am happy to know,

31:01.440 --> 31:03.440
and I have to make a humble request to all of you.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.560
If you have to come to Sahaja Yoga

31:07.380 --> 31:12.340
you have to be people who have to understand that reality is not a joke.

31:13.300 --> 31:14.840
It’s not a frivolous thing.

31:15.500 --> 31:16.720
You have to become

31:17.620 --> 31:18.960
a realised-soul

31:19.280 --> 31:25.580
and you have to grow in the light of that Realisation and you have to master this art.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.720
We need now masters all over.

31:29.440 --> 31:33.040
Not that somebody else is your master but you become your own master.

31:34.180 --> 31:38.360
Such people are needed to channelise the energy of God.

31:40.960 --> 31:41.980
I am sure

31:43.600 --> 31:46.100
Warren must have told you all about it.

31:46.920 --> 31:49.620
He’s another great character I have;

31:49.880 --> 31:51.060
very proud of him,

31:53.320 --> 31:56.420
the way he feels responsible for the whole world,

31:58.580 --> 31:59.700
the way he came down.

31:59.780 --> 32:01.440
He sacrificed so much, so much.

32:01.640 --> 32:05.220
I mean we, I don’t need any money from an, anything as such,

32:05.880 --> 32:10.100
but even money-wise I am sure he must have done something.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.820
I don’t know because I have never taken any money from him as such.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.060
But even there I am sure,

32:16.000 --> 32:21.060
he established an ashram, he established people, he got them, he worked it out.

32:21.100 --> 32:25.380
I mean it’s remarkable, and how people followed him, seeing him the way he is.

32:25.780 --> 32:31.800
He doesn’t have any private life left except for to enjoy this privacy of the Spirit with others,

32:35.140 --> 32:37.140
and if you see his background

32:37.880 --> 32:41.240
he’ll tell you that he knew he was a seeker

32:42.160 --> 32:45.720
but in the seeking he committed so many mistakes, so many mistakes.

32:46.680 --> 32:48.680
But look at his sensitivity.

32:49.180 --> 32:50.420
He knows where the Kundalini is,

32:50.420 --> 32:55.540
he knows how to correct it and not him but most of the people from Australia know it so well.

33:00.680 --> 33:01.840
It’s nothing mundane.

33:04.200 --> 33:05.780
It will be very sad

33:05.960 --> 33:09.500
and unhappy if you people get your Realisation

33:09.500 --> 33:12.340
and lose it and do not develop into it.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.660
I don’t know what would be the category of such people

33:16.700 --> 33:20.880
whom God has given the light and they didn’t give light to anyone.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.640
I don’t know what should be the position.

33:26.620 --> 33:28.260
Today I am rather concerned,

33:28.720 --> 33:33.180
very much concerned because I have come back from these three countries.

33:35.620 --> 33:37.060
I was amazed.

33:38.260 --> 33:40.560
France: tremendous.

33:42.800 --> 33:43.960
French people,

33:44.200 --> 33:47.660
I used to always say that these “les miserables” and all that.

33:47.840 --> 33:49.420
Nothing of the kind.

33:49.740 --> 33:54.260
There’s a priest who got his Realisation.

33:55.200 --> 33:59.940
He formed an association called “Saving the people from gurus.”

34:01.180 --> 34:02.580
Very clever,

34:03.040 --> 34:04.860
and he is a priest still,

34:06.920 --> 34:09.600
but he is a Sahaja yogi out and out.

34:11.020 --> 34:15.060
And what he does,  those people who go to him and tell against the Christianity

34:15.060 --> 34:17.060
he said,“Why don’t you go to Sahaja Yoga?”

34:18.120 --> 34:21.140
Anybody whom he saves, he sends them to Sahaja Yoga…

34:22.020 --> 34:22.640
all that.

34:23.000 --> 34:26.000
But the other day he said, “Mother, why should we have Pope anymore?”

34:28.140 --> 34:28.940
Look at that.

34:29.240 --> 34:31.720
And he stays in the church and works for Sahaja Yoga.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.200
Can you beat that?

34:34.960 --> 34:38.540
Because he thinks he has to save people who are misled.

34:38.980 --> 34:39.820
He does that.

34:43.260 --> 34:44.820
We have people of that calibre.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.140
Another one we met,

34:47.520 --> 34:49.520
another one very great one,

34:49.820 --> 34:51.180
in Portugal.

34:51.720 --> 34:57.140
He told me that the T.M. gentleman wanted to establish his kingdom in Portugal.

34:57.260 --> 34:59.440
He’s got a very big land and all that.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.300
And he told me all the secrets.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.840
He said, “I am going to talk to the people who are in charge here.

35:05.000 --> 35:05.780
They are sensible.”

35:06.260 --> 35:07.720
I said, “Really? Are you sure?”

35:08.040 --> 35:12.380
I said, “If you want to talk to anybody here in Mentmore, they’ll not listen.. They are very satisfied

35:12.480 --> 35:14.480
with the yards of black suits they are wearing

35:15.860 --> 35:22.300
and with the so-called idea of sitting on a gold gilded chair.

35:23.540 --> 35:27.960
All that stupidity.” He said, “No, not in Portugal. They are very sensible people.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.200
They realise it. I am going to talk to them.”

35:32.140 --> 35:34.140
Because they are all suffering

35:34.620 --> 35:36.760
so early. Only three years they have been doing it.

35:37.100 --> 35:41.000
They are all suffering on the left side, their ears are finished, somebody’s eyes are finished,

35:41.020 --> 35:45.560
somebody’s problem is on the left side, somebody has a problem on the left Void and all that.

35:46.360 --> 35:47.620
I cured, of course.

35:48.060 --> 35:50.900
But they said, “All of us are suffering.”

35:51.240 --> 35:53.700
That means they are very sensitive also to suffer so fast.

35:56.080 --> 35:59.840
And they are realising, they are reaching all of them, even their administrators and their;

35:59.860 --> 36:03.880
everybody’s realising that there’s some sort of a nonsense going on in this T.M.

36:06.300 --> 36:07.680
Just imagine.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.480
When I went back,

36:14.440 --> 36:16.440
so transformed and changed.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.580
The one gentleman had an eye like this.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.140
It’s all opened out equally the same, everything,face so transformed.

36:22.620 --> 36:25.280
I said, “I can’t recognise you, the way you are changed.”

36:25.720 --> 36:27.720
Such a short time, in eight days,

36:28.320 --> 36:30.320
they worked it out.

36:35.120 --> 36:40.080
Portugal is a country known for its escape nowadays.

36:40.580 --> 36:44.160
There are nobody, we should call,the real Portuguese

36:44.160 --> 36:45.460
have run away from that country.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.040
They are settled in Brazil.

36:47.940 --> 36:53.220
Spain, people have not much hopes from Spain, politically.It’s a hopeless country, they say.

36:53.740 --> 36:56.380
Italy is the worst of all. They have Mafia, this.

36:56.660 --> 36:58.660
And in that Maya

37:01.700 --> 37:04.080
these beautiful lotuses to see.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.920
What a joy it was;

37:09.240 --> 37:10.380
what a joy.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.540
You can’t imagine.

37:11.920 --> 37:15.580
Even our Ambassador in Spain said, “The people here are very different, Mother.”

37:17.880 --> 37:21.260
He said, “I talked to some people. They said, ‘When She is coming you have to call us.’”

37:21.420 --> 37:25.180
I said, “Next year you have a big program. This year let’s have only the Indians.

37:25.340 --> 37:27.340
But next year, of course, you can call.”

37:27.340 --> 37:30.720
You see, all of them here want to have Realisation.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.380
All big people, eminent people.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.760
You just come next year and you’ll see all of them.

37:36.540 --> 37:39.400
Here, do you think anybody?

37:43.280 --> 37:45.800
An ambassador, can you imagine?

37:48.520 --> 37:49.540
I can’t think.

37:52.660 --> 37:53.740
Very funny people.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.100
I’ve met a very big man once in a dinner party

37:57.920 --> 38:04.020
where one of the Sahaja yogis is the chairman of the Hague High Court, of course an Indian, Dr. Nagen Singh.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.960
And he told that gentleman that,

38:08.120 --> 38:13.580
“This lady is a very well-known spiritual leader of India and She has given Realisation to many

38:13.580 --> 38:15.360
and She has given Realisation to me also.”

38:17.440 --> 38:21.220
He looked at me and he said, “No, I am also a realised-soul.”

38:23.220 --> 38:24.500
What to say?

38:25.460 --> 38:27.460
He said, “Christ has given me Realisation.

38:28.360 --> 38:30.580
It’s Christ who is going to give me.”

38:32.900 --> 38:37.420
So Nagen Singh in Hindi says,“There are no vibrations,the Kundalini is frozen

38:38.240 --> 38:41.280
and this one is saying. How can Christ give him Realisation?”

38:41.660 --> 38:44.320
I said, “This is the escape because Christ is no more.”

38:45.260 --> 38:48.440
Of course, Christ gives him but where is Christ within himself?

38:50.140 --> 38:52.140
So he asked him, “Where is Christ within yourself?”

38:54.020 --> 38:56.020
“That Christ knows himself.”

39:00.000 --> 39:02.300
He said, “I didn’t know these people were such buffoons.”

39:03.440 --> 39:05.440
Really, these were his words.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.140
And my husband then couldn’t bear it any more

39:08.680 --> 39:12.200
He said “Now, forget it.” You see, he was such a blind man.

39:12.500 --> 39:16.120
I mean, in India people may not get Realisation,

39:16.120 --> 39:18.920
may not, but they know what is Realisation.

39:19.540 --> 39:21.260
They know who is truthful,

39:22.140 --> 39:23.320
I must say.

39:23.640 --> 39:26.620
Whether they are ambassadors or Presidents, make no difference;

39:28.600 --> 39:30.180
they know that definitely.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.700
Even President of India, say,

39:32.940 --> 39:35.140
if he sees me he doesn’t sit down.

39:35.840 --> 39:36.860
He’ll stand up.

39:37.660 --> 39:38.840
They have that sense.

39:39.800 --> 39:42.020
That basic humility is missing.

39:43.020 --> 39:46.280
That’s why we take to people who pamper our ego.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.280
We take to people who are nonsensical.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.980
We take to people who befool us.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.840
Only the egoistical can be befooled.

39:59.660 --> 40:02.780
If you are not egoistical no one can befool you

40:03.380 --> 40:04.860
How do you befool a person?

40:05.240 --> 40:06.320
By pampering the ego.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.580
So one has to understand

40:10.700 --> 40:14.860
that unless and until we develop that basic humility within ourselves

40:15.640 --> 40:18.080
we are not going to do very well in England.

40:19.080 --> 40:22.420
It’s for all the Sahaja yogis as well as for people who have come here.

40:22.620 --> 40:27.100
It’s a very, very, serious problem,

40:27.500 --> 40:36.820
and you are placed in the most vital parts of the universe that is this England, that’s the Heart.

40:37.660 --> 40:42.620
And if you now any way escape your responsibility,

40:43.360 --> 40:45.360
you will be held responsible,

40:45.640 --> 40:49.860
I am telling you now very strongly.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.940
Because today I had big lectures from people saying that,

40:53.100 --> 40:56.980
“Mother, you don’t say things strongly, and people are to be frightened.”

40:57.320 --> 41:00.840
I don’t want to frighten you but you will be held responsible,

41:01.000 --> 41:01.780
take it from me.

41:02.280 --> 41:03.540
You are born on this Earth,

41:04.280 --> 41:05.100
on this

41:05.680 --> 41:06.340
great land

41:06.680 --> 41:08.680
for a very great purpose,

41:09.140 --> 41:11.160
to create Jerusalem out of that.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.160
And now if you are not going to stand up,

41:15.640 --> 41:17.640
you’ll be held responsible.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.700
This is what it is.

41:20.740 --> 41:22.740
It’s a tremendous work one has to do,

41:24.240 --> 41:27.340
for which you must prepare yourself

41:27.920 --> 41:28.780
Get to it.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.740
I can give Realisation;  that’s all.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.980
But I can’t give you strength.

41:33.760 --> 41:36.980
I mean, you can’t make the horse stand up on his forelegs, can you?

41:38.500 --> 41:42.820
It’s a very, very, desperate situation sometimes the way things happen.

41:45.300 --> 41:50.540
After all, you must know that My coming here has some meaning of.

41:50.860 --> 41:53.140
I didn’t come here because

41:53.400 --> 41:56.580
I chose to come in the way people,

41:56.820 --> 41:58.820
the gurus walk into your country.

41:59.460 --> 42:03.140
I came here because something was done spontaneously.

42:04.300 --> 42:07.680
I had to stay here, I had to work for you,

42:07.920 --> 42:13.540
I had to implore you and request you and tell you in every way possible your responsibility.

42:14.700 --> 42:19.240
But then you don’t tell me because I have not failed in my duties as far as I’m concerned.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.720
Of that I am very sure.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.100
But now I’ll leave it to you

42:24.220 --> 42:26.380
because I may not be here next year. What can you say?

42:27.300 --> 42:29.300
Depends on the moods.

42:30.920 --> 42:34.420
But we have to see what you are going to do for the whole world,

42:36.120 --> 42:38.720
for the whole emancipation of the human being.

42:39.840 --> 42:41.840
First you have to find your own beauty

42:42.120 --> 42:44.620
and you have to give this beauty to others.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.100
This is a greatest artist’s job you have to do,

42:48.280 --> 42:51.820
as a great master of art in divine life.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.380
You have to become divine.

42:54.820 --> 42:56.560
It’s you who has to become divine.

42:56.780 --> 42:58.040
You don’t worry about me.

43:00.180 --> 43:01.780
I don’t have to achieve anything.

43:01.960 --> 43:03.240
That’s the only problem.

43:07.260 --> 43:08.580
I don’t have to achieve it.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.840
I have to only achieve you people.

43:13.420 --> 43:20.700
I have to only have ways and methods by which I could really make you grow.

43:22.400 --> 43:30.740
All that is possible I will do, but you must stand up on your legs, must ask for it.

43:33.620 --> 43:34.780
It’s a big problem.

43:36.980 --> 43:38.760
Not for others; for me.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.280
Because others have no such problem.

43:40.440 --> 43:42.160
They don’t want you to stand on your legs.

43:42.260 --> 43:44.260
They want you to crawl and they want you to disappear.

43:44.860 --> 43:46.860
This is a different thing. I want you to grow,

43:49.840 --> 43:52.160
not because I want, but Divine wants it.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.040
The whole Creation wants it.

43:56.160 --> 43:57.600
Otherwise it will have no meaning.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.440
So the responsibility of English Sahaja yogis,

44:01.980 --> 44:04.440
British Sahaja yogis is very great.

44:05.300 --> 44:10.340
Again and again I have requested you and I have told you in whatever way possible,

44:11.720 --> 44:13.420
that establish yourself.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.740
You are lagging behind.

44:15.740 --> 44:18.940
I can tell you Spanish people will have to come and teach you Sahaja Yoga.

44:19.200 --> 44:22.760
Already we have got somebody from Australia to teach that.

44:25.740 --> 44:27.980
You give up your old ideas and conditioning.

44:28.060 --> 44:32.680
Every Saturday, Sunday, must you go out of the country, out of London?

44:33.300 --> 44:35.300
London is your place where you have to work.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.500
Unless and until you take it up upon yourself it’s not going to work out.

44:44.920 --> 44:47.500
Some people have to do it, someone.

44:49.760 --> 44:56.800
I am looking out for such people for whom this is their desire.

44:57.140 --> 45:01.920
We talk of big things. If we talk to anyone, I see in big, big parties they talk,

45:01.960 --> 45:04.940
“Oh, what’s this?” and “We must become peaceful countries.

45:04.940 --> 45:06.800
We must do this and that must happen.”

45:06.800 --> 45:13.720
And even if you’ll listen to the lecture of our great President of America,

45:14.380 --> 45:16.380
you find, “Oh God, some angel is speaking,” or what?

45:17.440 --> 45:19.200
Like an angel, they speak.

45:19.680 --> 45:25.280
Angelic, prophetic, such big, big, words. I can’t understand even

45:25.400 --> 45:32.320
it won’t come into the mouth of God Himself but the way people talk, ultimately what remains is nothing.

45:35.540 --> 45:37.540
So let us be that, what we talk.

45:40.100 --> 45:41.080
We can be.

45:41.740 --> 45:44.300
We all can be. It’s very simple.

45:46.260 --> 45:47.260
You have to decide.

45:48.440 --> 45:51.000
You have to really decide. The time has come.

45:52.060 --> 45:57.160
I just pray may God give you strength to stand with the truth.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.380
It’s not difficult.

45:59.080 --> 46:03.340
It’s very joy-giving. But stand with it, grow with it.

46:04.320 --> 46:08.060
That’s what you are. Thank you very much.

46:13.060 --> 46:18.500
Now if you have any questions you can ask me and we should have Realisation.

46:18.780 --> 46:19.320
Hello.

46:25.860 --> 46:29.040
What’s that? What’s that here?

46:34.580 --> 46:39.200
Right Swadisthana. She’s showing right Swadisthana.

46:43.580 --> 46:47.900
Oh, all right. Now you take this one.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.820
They are fighting. They are fighting, see, working it out.

47:18.760 --> 47:20.260
They are all fighting.

47:32.780 --> 47:34.780
How is your child,[Graham]?

47:35.440 --> 47:36.500
That same thing?

47:36.580 --> 47:38.040
Much less.

47:38.240 --> 47:41.720
Your Agnya? Have you brought her?

47:42.800 --> 47:47.700
No, because I haven’t the right, because she has [just come out of / to stay in the] hospital two or three weeks.

47:48.040 --> 47:52.060
“All right. On my way back if we have time I will go for see her.

47:54.560 --> 47:55.700
That child is fighting.

47:59.820 --> 48:02.500
What sufferings from the very beginning of life.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.460
That house also I think has problems.

48:12.860 --> 48:19.100
No questions? Are there any questions please?

48:27.420 --> 48:28.080
Yes?

48:29.480 --> 48:38.300
I’m from Holland and I wonder whether I should try to stay in England, in London for, should I remain in England to find work? ”

48:39.700 --> 48:41.080
It’s difficult to find?

48:41.300 --> 48:49.100
I am wondering whether I should try to find work here in England or, do you understand what I am saying?

48:49.340 --> 48:50.240
You are English?

48:50.320 --> 48:51.220
No, Holland.

48:51.340 --> 48:51.840
Yes?

48:51.920 --> 48:52.620
Holland.

48:52.760 --> 48:53.380
Holland?

48:53.520 --> 48:56.700
Yes.Oh, we need people in Holland.

48:58.600 --> 49:00.060
I haven’t yet touched it.

49:00.060 --> 49:01.160
Excuse me?

49:01.240 --> 49:03.240
I haven’t yet touched Holland.

49:03.720 --> 49:08.800
Haven’t been there. I went there once, a long time back, but we have to touch Holland

49:09.460 --> 49:12.680
There are lots of seekers, no doubt, but

49:15.220 --> 49:17.220
drinking too much.

49:19.120 --> 49:25.520
Yeah. They drink too much, they told me, like Scotland, see,

49:27.040 --> 49:29.320
chana. All right, you eat chana

49:32.200 --> 49:34.300
and we have to look after them, no doubt.

49:34.560 --> 49:37.060
There are lots of seekers misled there are.

49:37.620 --> 49:39.620
In Holland we have one great soul.

49:40.060 --> 49:43.080
There’s a young boy of sixteen years, I think. Careen, his name is.

49:43.960 --> 49:45.960
They asked him about his father, mother, everything.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.800
He said, “my father is just like other fathers.”

49:49.820 --> 49:51.820
I said, “Really? What does he do?”

49:52.000 --> 49:56.440
“In the daytime he drinks beer. In the night he drinks whisky.”

49:58.440 --> 50:00.940
I said, “Really?” “All fathers do that, Mother.”

50:02.260 --> 50:03.680
“And what about the children?”

50:04.320 --> 50:09.780
“Some of us, our friends, we meditate but most of them also are drinking beer.”

50:11.740 --> 50:13.740
When he was twelve years he first came.

50:13.740 --> 50:15.660
I think twelve or eight years he came here, I think.

50:15.740 --> 50:17.740
Yes, and he must be sixteen now, yes.

50:17.740 --> 50:21.400
Wonderful man. He is growing up there.

50:21.740 --> 50:24.480
I told him to gather more people who think like him.

50:25.140 --> 50:27.140
He might, he is a great person.

50:28.780 --> 50:33.060
His mother is French and father is this thing and divorced and another mother,

50:33.060 --> 50:34.320
all kinds of problems.

50:35.820 --> 50:39.300
No, would be better in Holland, no doubt, but you get your Realisation,

50:39.300 --> 50:43.900
you settle down here and we must start a centre in Holland and next year I am coming down there,

50:44.580 --> 50:45.200
all right?

50:46.220 --> 50:49.280
Holland is one place I have not been. I didn’t go to Austria.

50:49.360 --> 50:52.100
Now, we have a very powerful yogi there. So I am going this year.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.600
A few countries I have not tackled.

50:54.740 --> 50:56.740
We should not go away from our country.

50:56.920 --> 50:58.160
We should work there.

50:58.380 --> 51:00.700
That’s the place we have to work, whatever is the condition.

51:02.500 --> 51:06.260
Switzerland now are doing very well. Switzerland is doing so well.

51:06.380 --> 51:11.340
Those who were committing suicide are now coming to Sahaja Yoga and doing very well.

51:11.340 --> 51:16.260
I said, “The way you [are/were] doing suicide, if you can do Sahaja Yoga even once it will be all right.”

51:17.960 --> 51:21.500
Because they did a perfect job always with their suicide things.

51:22.280 --> 51:26.320
They used to plan it out so well, the suicide,

51:26.320 --> 51:31.360
in such a way, I mean, that it would not create any problems for anyone and sort of thing.

51:32.780 --> 51:38.600
They used to think about it all the time, how to commit suicide, and they, very great planning.

51:40.340 --> 51:41.980
But look at Switzerland.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.600
It’s a challenge to all of you.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.300
So it’s a good idea.

51:56.860 --> 52:00.940
You get your Sahaja Yoga here, settle down, master it and go to Holland.

52:00.940 --> 52:06.700
You would be the one of the—- I gave once a Realisation to one Mr. called August Tigger.

52:07.520 --> 52:12.400
He was the chairman of your, one of your very big companies.

52:13.340 --> 52:18.460
He was a very big man, no doubt, but he told me that,

52:18.460 --> 52:22.880
“I cannot talk about to anyone. They will think I have gone crazy.”

52:25.260 --> 52:26.260
And he died.

52:26.380 --> 52:28.380
He was a very old man when I met him.

52:28.700 --> 52:31.620
He was about eighty years of age when I first met him.

52:38.080 --> 52:40.300
And a very great seeker he was, very great seeker.

52:45.380 --> 52:47.380
Holland I’ll definitely come, no doubt.

52:48.380 --> 52:50.380
And now we have reached Brussels also.

52:50.640 --> 52:53.280
So in Brussels and Holland we can do it, isn’t it?

52:53.340 --> 52:57.300
From Brussels it is easier to go to Amsterdam.

52:58.220 --> 53:00.060
Where will you be in Holland?

53:00.060 --> 53:02.060
I have no place at all.

53:02.100 --> 53:02.660
Huh.

53:02.660 --> 53:04.660
have no place [where] to go for the moment.

53:06.080 --> 53:08.540
But you will be placed in Holland?

53:08.700 --> 53:10.700
Then I have to go back. I have to.

53:10.760 --> 53:12.320
Yes, you should, you should.

53:12.480 --> 53:19.080
You see, I would request you, once you become a Sahaja yogi, you should go there,

53:19.240 --> 53:21.240
and we’ll send some people to help you also.

53:21.720 --> 53:23.720
There is somebody very powerful in Brussels,

53:23.720 --> 53:27.220
Very powerful in Brussels, who’ll help you, very powerful.

53:27.740 --> 53:29.740
You remember that Rajneesh fellow who came?

53:31.720 --> 53:33.200
Oh, he’s so powerful.

53:33.200 --> 53:34.340
You must see that.

53:34.680 --> 53:40.040
He’s brought about ten people from Brussels to Lille.

53:42.580 --> 53:43.580
Can you imagine?

53:44.420 --> 53:46.420
He’s already started his own centre.

53:53.600 --> 53:56.480
It can only work in the democratic countries, isn’t it?

53:56.980 --> 53:58.980
And I think Holland is very important.

53:59.800 --> 54:03.900
And who is there is Dr Nagen Singh himself, is there in Holland.

54:04.040 --> 54:05.140
He’s in Hague.

54:05.220 --> 54:06.240
Is he?

54:06.500 --> 54:08.780
He’s in Hague.He’s the Chairman of your World Court.

54:51.900 --> 54:59.800
Look, what? What? Anand? Anand. This is Anand. Ananad. And this is?

54:59.980 --> 55:05.420
Sonu. Sonu. Sonu. Say Sonu.

55:18.140 --> 55:20.140
He’s a real joker, I tell you.

55:23.900 --> 55:26.660
What makes you laugh so much and look here?

55:27.300 --> 55:29.420
All right now. Sit down, you sit down there.

55:29.560 --> 55:32.260
Sit down. All right. Be a nice girl, all right?

55:33.040 --> 55:36.540
Ha, now sit down. Yes, we have to raise their Kundalini.

55:36.720 --> 55:43.600
Ha, come along, come along, come along, come along, come along now.) How is she [unclear name]?

55:45.260 --> 55:46.600
All right now

55:46.980 --> 55:47.720
Better?

55:49.160 --> 55:58.000
She is better. How is the baby from Australia? Is he all right? Is he all right?

55:58.380 --> 55:59.300
Much better.

55:59.640 --> 56:05.980
Much better now. I am sorry that day you had gone away.I wanted to see the baby.

56:15.960 --> 56:20.240
What? Ha. Ha. Hop. Hop.

56:20.700 --> 56:28.480
Ha, up, up. Hop. Hop.

56:31.220 --> 56:35.620
Now, hop, hop. Come, come. Anna, come, come.

56:38.620 --> 56:40.620
These children.

57:05.220 --> 57:07.560
Give her, give her chana. Good.

57:07.560 --> 57:11.100
Give her some, give her, give some chana. Give her some chana.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.580
All right. Go and give her some chana. All right? Take this one

57:16.220 --> 57:22.200
You give her. I told you to give her.

57:28.960 --> 57:30.480
All right, let’s have it, for that.

57:30.620 --> 57:36.740
See how cheerful they are, how cheerful. All right, now we are going to keep quiet.Sit down here, sit down.

57:36.800 --> 57:38.800
All of us are going to sit down.

57:39.180 --> 57:41.660
All right? Sit down. Come here. Come here. Sit down.

57:42.020 --> 57:44.020
All sit down. You sit down. Olympia.

57:44.020 --> 57:49.880
You sit down. All right? Sit down. All right. Be a nice girl. Now, it’s all right.Let her be.

57:49.880 --> 57:56.580
She is not well. She is still little. All right, she’ll come.

57:56.720 --> 57:59.040
She’s, she will come.

58:00.620 --> 58:05.840
She can’t leave. She can’t enjoy herself, see. That’s what it is; everybody must enjoy.

58:10.420 --> 58:12.980
All right. Now close your eyes, please. Just close your eyes.

58:12.980 --> 58:15.320
Put both your feet on the ground.

58:20.960 --> 58:23.820
Now, take out your shoes. Shoes, shoes.
