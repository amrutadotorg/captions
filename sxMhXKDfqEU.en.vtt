00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Yeah, so I was, I got pregnant, and the day I knew I'm pregnant, I came home, and my husband looked at me and said, who died in the family?

2
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I said, nobody, but I'm pregnant, and I was afraid because Shivataji told me not to be pregnant again, could be dangerous.

3
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But my strong husband said, don't worry, I will work on you every day, and you have to be positive.

4
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This soul has to feel that the soul is welcomed on this earth.

5
00:00:45.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, okay, the pregnancy went on. And again, I was losing some blood after Shivataji left Austria, and I said, okay, we go to the hospital, it will be like every time I will lose the child.

6
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I was just, but not, examining, examining, I had just to lie down for two days, and everything was alright.

7
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I was at Ganesha Puja in September, my husband was at Ganesha Puja, and I went to the genealog for an ultra-shall.

8
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And the genealog looked at the ultra-shall, and he suddenly, he looked at me and he said, you see, madam, I have to be frank with you, I don't like what I see on this ultra-shall.

9
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And I said, what is this? He said, it's something behind the placenta, we can't do anything, and this will resolve the placenta and the child will die.

10
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Boom.

11
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I was finished, and I said, but maybe, I told the genealog, maybe you are wrong, look, I heard mions, maybe you mixed something, I mean I was trying to.

12
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And he looked at the papers and he said, oh, maybe, maybe no, but, and at this moment I felt vibrations in my hand and I said, you see, I know this child is protected.

13
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:40.000
He looked at me very catholic, he said, wow, you believe in God? He told me, I said yes.

14
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And because I got diabetes during my pregnancy, the genealog told me to do a cesarean three weeks before.

15
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And what happened when I woke up after the operation, the genealog looked at me, he said, felicitation, it's a boy, he's really healthy, but you see, it's a miracle.

16
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Because when I took out the placenta, the hematom was here. In my career, I never saw this. You are believing in God and he protected you.

17
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And he's here. And our daughter Aparna, she was in the Kuchipudi Academy in Madras at this time. So with my husband, we wrote a fax, we sent it to Sumataji to thank her about Lakshmana, about,

18
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and I'm so moved again. And Aparna went, could enter the room of Sumataji and gave her the fax and Sumataji said, oh, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle. Three times she said, but I knew she desired so much child.

19
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Lucas is alright, but I will give him a name when I see him. You see, all these great souls just want to incarnate on this earth now.

20
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We were driving in Warsaw, I was driving Sumataji to the airport and she was sitting in the back of course with our Ganesh. And I thought to myself, it would be nice to have an Indian name for our son.

21
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So I asked Sumataji, very polite and humbly, for a name and she didn't answer at all. So I thought, okay, it's like this. And she was talking about other things and I actually gave it up.

22
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So when we arrived at the airport, somebody was jumping, opening the door of Sumataji. She put one foot into the basement and with a big smile, she said to me, Lakshmana.

23
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yeah. Okay. So thank you to have listened to it. Thank you to have given us the opportunity to share these stories and all of our love.

24
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:12.000
I will say something also. I heard these stories of my wife, a couple of times, you can imagine, but I'm still moved by this thing.

25
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Christine, you missed the story about when mother came to Gertner Gasser Ashram, and we did our tea to her and what Sumataji said then to us.

26
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
She said, it's like a puja.

27
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
We did.

28
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Yeah. But you see, Dara, I have such a lot, a lot, a lot of other stories.

29
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I had to choose. I mean, yes.

30
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
We need another session that's already leading.

31
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Yes.

32
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
That would be wonderful because it's amazing.
