Becoming the Light Within
Public Program, Hampstead, England

00:35.830 --> 00:41.730
May 10, 1985

00:41.730 --> 00:47.230
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:47.230 --> 01:14.900
As I’ve told you before that these are special
times, and times when we are very confused.

01:14.900 --> 01:24.310
We are confused because so many things are
in the atmosphere.

01:24.310 --> 01:28.200
Moreover there is a special urge to search
the truth.

01:28.200 --> 01:41.610
This is a very special thing of the modern
times that people want to search the truth.

01:41.610 --> 01:50.350
They think perhaps that there is something
beyond that they have to seek.

01:50.350 --> 01:55.800
They feel they are not satisfied with whatever
they have.

01:55.800 --> 02:02.380
They feel whatever is going on in this world
is not all right.

02:02.380 --> 02:13.440
Perhaps they feel that human beings are not
on the right track, that we have to take to

02:13.440 --> 02:20.080
something else, something different, something
higher.

02:20.080 --> 02:28.590
But first of all when we are seeking, we must
understand that it should be based on the

02:28.590 --> 02:30.530
tradition of seeking.

02:30.530 --> 02:40.590
For example, when you see these lights here
you know that it was discovered gradually,

02:40.590 --> 02:48.760
first through principles then little more
then little more, till they discovered these

02:48.760 --> 02:51.040
lights for us.

02:51.040 --> 03:02.250
But in the seeking, today the problem is human
being has become not independent, but arbitrary.

03:02.250 --> 03:11.400
He has no relationship with the whole, and
anybody who tries to find out a new method,

03:11.400 --> 03:18.050
a new idea, a new way, people jump at it.

03:18.050 --> 03:21.760
This is the character of the modern times.

03:21.760 --> 03:27.840
Also media and everybody tries to support
anything new comes up.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.960
In seeking also it has happened.

03:32.960 --> 03:45.180
Whatever the ancient people, the scriptures
have found out for us is not to be wasted.

03:45.180 --> 03:52.891
We have to base our findings, our path, on
the same experiences that they have had and

03:52.891 --> 03:57.900
use them for our purpose, is a sensible thing.

03:57.900 --> 04:08.930
Like a boy gets a lot of money, say from his
parents, he uses that and then builds up his

04:08.930 --> 04:16.959
own business, very rarely he’ll throw away
all that and start something new venture and

04:16.959 --> 04:22.940
end up into bankruptcy.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.481
This is one of the problems we are facing.

04:24.481 --> 04:32.039
So I have seen that people suddenly take to
new methods.

04:32.039 --> 04:42.460
Like I was in Pune the other day and I met
some very learned Sanskrit scholars, and I

04:42.460 --> 04:49.370
was amazed that they all were suffering from
all kinds of diseases of a very serious nature.

04:49.370 --> 04:55.670
They said we have a guru, another said he
had a guru.

04:55.670 --> 04:59.540
I said, “How is it you are suffering from
diseases?

04:59.540 --> 05:07.660
If you have a guru at least your health should
be all right, at least minimum of minimum.”

05:07.660 --> 05:11.910
“Oh,” they said, “No, this is something
we are doing, very serious work.”

05:11.910 --> 05:14.570
I said, “What is that?”

05:14.570 --> 05:19.340
They started giving Me names Urnopait, Turnopait,
this, that.

05:19.340 --> 05:22.560
They said that our guru gives us a shaktipath.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.820
I said, “What is all that I have never heard
it.

05:25.820 --> 05:29.180
In what book have you found it?

05:29.180 --> 05:31.940
Is it in Vedas?

05:31.940 --> 05:33.150
Is it in Puranas?

05:33.150 --> 05:34.150
Is it in the Gita?

05:34.150 --> 05:39.639
Or is it in the Bible or Koran, where is it?

05:39.639 --> 05:42.560
Did Lao Tse talk about it or Socrates?

05:42.560 --> 05:44.990
From where do you get this word shaktipath
suddenly?

05:44.990 --> 05:46.890
I’ve never heard about it.”

05:46.890 --> 05:52.210
So they said about sixty, seventy years back
there was a gentleman called Vishnutirth,

05:52.210 --> 05:56.500
he has written a book, a book, and all this
is based on that shaktipath business.

05:56.500 --> 06:00.720
I said, “I have never heard of this Vishnutirth.”

06:00.720 --> 06:09.960
And he started a new fad, and this fad you
have accepted; paying no attention to what

06:09.960 --> 06:19.510
Gita has to say, no attention to what Vedas
have to say, no attention to what other scriptures

06:19.510 --> 06:23.770
have to say about your ascent.

06:23.770 --> 06:25.330
You accepted this gentleman out of the blue.

06:25.330 --> 06:36.750
Last hundred years in India we have had such
funny people, they produced books after books,

06:36.750 --> 06:38.730
even in English language.

06:38.730 --> 06:46.311
All these books were translated in English,
German and all these languages which has no

06:46.311 --> 06:49.110
basis, no connection, no relevance whatsoever
to the ancient books.

06:49.110 --> 06:56.990
I read a book by one German fellow who must
have taken some, I don’t know, idea from

06:56.990 --> 07:02.810
half baked personalities in India, somebody
who knows little bit of Sanskrit and lot of

07:02.810 --> 07:08.350
English or maybe something, he wrote such
a funny book where he said the kundalini is

07:08.350 --> 07:10.100
in your stomach.

07:10.100 --> 07:16.270
And this fellow says when the kundalini is
awakened then you start jumping like a frog,

07:16.270 --> 07:19.170
or you start making noises like a lion.

07:19.170 --> 07:25.370
I said, “Now, are you going to become a
frog and then an earthworm?”

07:25.370 --> 07:32.050
All these funny ideas are worked out.

07:32.050 --> 07:38.870
Maybe it is an ego trip or maybe it’s some
sort of a befooling going on.

07:38.870 --> 07:46.590
The other day only, I met somebody in Germany;
there were thirty people in a group and their

07:46.590 --> 07:50.520
so-called teacher came to see Me, and they
all.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.389
And I said, “What are you teaching them?”

07:52.389 --> 07:53.389
He said, “I am teaching them Prana moksha.”

07:53.389 --> 07:54.389
In Sanskrit language this word means death.

07:54.389 --> 07:56.380
I was quite shocked, what is he teaching there?

07:56.380 --> 08:00.900
I said, “What sort of a Prana moksha are
you teaching them?”

08:00.900 --> 08:05.630
He said, “I circulate the air into my body
and then I make the air go here and there.”

08:05.630 --> 08:10.730
So I said, “What difference will it make
if the air goes here or there or here or anywhere,

08:10.730 --> 08:14.770
what difference is it going to make?”

08:14.770 --> 08:17.930
But he was quite confident about it.

08:17.930 --> 08:22.130
He said, “You must give me more time.

08:22.130 --> 08:23.940
I’ll talk to You about it.”

08:23.940 --> 08:27.630
His kundalini was all frozen, absolutely,
he had no realization, nothing, and he was

08:27.630 --> 08:31.180
boasting as if he knew every thing about it.

08:31.180 --> 08:36.300
I was amazed at his confidence, really, and
I said that these thirty people tomorrow will

08:36.300 --> 08:45.130
be suffering from horrible diseases or they
might end up in a lunatic asylum.

08:45.130 --> 08:52.540
It may be some of the seekers might have reached
a state that they are so frustrated with all

08:52.540 --> 08:55.950
this nonsense, that they might be wanting
just to kill themselves.

08:55.950 --> 08:59.249
They might have joined him for this Prana
moksha.

08:59.249 --> 09:04.110
I can’t understand, why did they join this
nonsensical thing?

09:04.110 --> 09:12.899
So, it is in India also we have such people
who take to new things, even in Western countries

09:12.899 --> 09:16.050
we are finding all kinds of new things coming
out.

09:16.050 --> 09:22.819
Like we have now, say Christ came in, now
as soon as Christ came there was an attack

09:22.819 --> 09:23.819
on Christianity.

09:23.819 --> 09:26.550
As I told you last time, Paul.

09:26.550 --> 09:32.639
Paul came to attack Christianity, absolutely
he is anti-Christ man, because he just neutralized

09:32.639 --> 09:34.920
Christ in his writings.

09:34.920 --> 09:39.910
When I first saw him there I said, “Who
is this Mr. Paul here, what is he doing?”

09:39.910 --> 09:44.220
And he cannot understand the mystery of God.

09:44.220 --> 09:49.660
He cannot think what greatness God’s powers
are.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.720
How can he describe?

09:51.720 --> 09:57.920
He himself was epileptic, according to us
that means he was a possessed man.

09:57.920 --> 10:02.730
Not only epileptic, he had other problems.

10:02.730 --> 10:07.619
He had killed many Christians and suddenly
he becomes a very nice man.

10:07.619 --> 10:10.999
Same with Augustine, he was another attack.

10:10.999 --> 10:16.720
Now thank God that Paul is exposed, and now
we have two types of Christians, those who

10:16.720 --> 10:20.589
believe in Christ and those who believe in
Paul.

10:20.589 --> 10:22.250
You cannot intellectualize.

10:22.250 --> 10:26.119
No, you cannot intellectualize Christ.

10:26.119 --> 10:31.309
You cannot intellectualize God, you cannot,
He is beyond your intellect, you cannot understand

10:31.309 --> 10:33.610
Him through your intellect.

10:33.610 --> 10:37.110
If you have to understand him you have to
become the spirit.

10:37.110 --> 10:41.470
Christ has clearly said that you are to be
born again.

10:41.470 --> 10:46.610
And when Nicodemus asked, “How am I to be
born again, I have to enter into the womb

10:46.610 --> 10:48.029
of my mother?”

10:48.029 --> 10:53.740
Christ said, “No, that what is flesh will
produce flesh.

10:53.740 --> 10:58.240
You have to be born again by the Holy Ghost.”

10:58.240 --> 11:05.850
If you remember Christ was killed in no time;
if was given time He would have told you what

11:05.850 --> 11:06.850
Holy Ghost is.

11:06.850 --> 11:07.850
Holy Ghost is the Kundalini within.

11:07.850 --> 11:11.410
She is going to give you the second birth.

11:11.410 --> 11:19.439
It’s a living process, and a living process
that should take place spontaneously.

11:19.439 --> 11:23.410
All living processes take place spontaneously.

11:23.410 --> 11:31.499
It is not that you can make a seed sprout
by taking out, pulling out its primule.

11:31.499 --> 11:32.829
You cannot force it.

11:32.829 --> 11:41.509
You cannot put some sort of a yoga system
on that seed that it should sprout.

11:41.509 --> 11:48.681
It has to just be embedded in the Mother Earth,
and the Mother Earth has the capacity and

11:48.681 --> 11:50.519
it sprouts.

11:50.519 --> 11:55.880
So all these new ideas come in and for an
intellectual, he being a right-sided person,

11:55.880 --> 11:58.540
it’s a great thing to see something new.

11:58.540 --> 12:05.490
And that’s why sometimes people of My age
group here in England are quite shocked to

12:05.490 --> 12:08.490
see how things have changed in this short
time.

12:08.490 --> 12:10.810
How people have taken to absurd things.

12:10.810 --> 12:17.360
Why have they accepted this kind of absurdity
and even the law goes in their favor, because

12:17.360 --> 12:21.810
law has to be democratic, it has to accept
whatever people say.

12:21.810 --> 12:26.639
Tomorrow if many people decide to commit suicide
the law will say, all right, by law you are

12:26.639 --> 12:28.199
allowed to commit suicide.

12:28.199 --> 12:30.910
What can the law do?

12:30.910 --> 12:37.990
They allow all kinds of nonsensical perverted
sexual behavior, and in ‘73 when I went

12:37.990 --> 12:42.550
to America I told them there will be a horrible
disease coming in which will stop all this

12:42.550 --> 12:43.550
nonsense.

12:43.550 --> 12:48.560
And they were very angry with Me, nobody would
listen to Me.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.382
But other gurus said, “It’s all right,
that’s your culture, do what you like, we

12:52.382 --> 12:53.382
have nothing to say.

12:53.382 --> 12:58.700
Only thing, as long as you give us money we
are satisfied.

12:58.700 --> 13:03.029
Nothing more is wanted for you to do, you
do, that’s your culture, this is our culture.”

13:03.029 --> 13:06.989
Even lamas say that, lamas when they come
down all the way from there, they are only

13:06.989 --> 13:08.999
interested in taking money from here.

13:08.999 --> 13:14.329
They said, that’s your culture, this is
our culture; as if Christians had a culture

13:14.329 --> 13:22.110
which was nothing to do with righteousness,
nothing to do with virtue, nothing to do with

13:22.110 --> 13:25.170
purity.

13:25.170 --> 13:28.989
Was that a animal’s culture that was preached
here?

13:28.989 --> 13:34.180
But that’s what people accepted, because
they just wanted your money.

13:34.180 --> 13:39.000
It’s a spontaneous process, you cannot pay
for it.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.839
And once you understand this simple point
that you cannot pay for it, is a spontaneous

13:43.839 --> 13:49.410
thing, it is your own, it is within your being,
that this kundalini resides.

13:49.410 --> 13:57.239
And it resides in such a way that it notes
everything that you do, it’s like a tape

13:57.239 --> 13:58.239
recorder.

13:58.239 --> 14:04.040
It’s your mother, and she is never going
to harm you, but she knows about her child.

14:04.040 --> 14:11.449
She is your individual mother, and she is
the pure desire within you.

14:11.449 --> 14:13.839
All other desires are impure desires.

14:13.839 --> 14:21.519
It’s an energy, an energy which is the reflection
of the Holy Ghost, because Holy Ghost is the

14:21.519 --> 14:24.809
energy of God, which is all-pervading.

14:24.809 --> 14:33.089
This energy resides in the triangular bone,
and the Greeks knew about it because they

14:33.089 --> 14:35.399
called the bone as sacrum.

14:35.399 --> 14:43.360
This all your own, you don’t have to go
any where else to find God.

14:43.360 --> 15:06.009
(Let her have a chair, get her a chair here,
she wants to come closer to Me, this little

15:06.009 --> 15:07.009
child.

15:07.009 --> 15:11.660
All right, please be seated.

15:11.660 --> 15:15.620
She’s a born-realized person.

15:15.620 --> 15:20.570
How are you?)

15:20.570 --> 15:33.660
So, these great things are available to you,
at your command you have got it, and the times

15:33.660 --> 15:37.619
have come, so many people have to get realization.

15:37.619 --> 15:44.839
But not through your mental projections, not
through your understanding you can understand

15:44.839 --> 15:47.550
the miracles of God; you cannot.

15:47.550 --> 15:53.170
Must understand very humbly that we have to
go beyond, we have to become the spirit.

15:53.170 --> 15:57.329
As Krishna has said, Atman Nivatman Atushda.

15:57.329 --> 16:00.639
That is: through atma only the atma will know.

16:00.639 --> 16:05.939
That is: the spirit will know itself through
the spirit.

16:05.939 --> 16:09.839
Is a simple thing to be understood that we
are not yet the spirit, and we have to become

16:09.839 --> 16:10.839
the spirit.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.769
That’s what Christ has clearly said it.

16:13.769 --> 16:16.790
Because people did not become the spirit,
now they are challenging Him.

16:16.790 --> 16:18.970
They are challenging His miracles.

16:18.970 --> 16:23.759
To see His miracles, one thing is that you
have to be the spirit.

16:23.759 --> 16:27.000
Now all that is within you, in your own power.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.410
It’s all there, you have to just get it
awakened, and you become that.

16:31.410 --> 16:35.839
Once you become the spirit, you become the
light and then you can give realization to

16:35.839 --> 16:36.839
other people.

16:36.839 --> 16:44.139
Now the people when they are skeptical, and
they start doubting, I think there is nothing

16:44.139 --> 16:45.139
to doubt.

16:45.139 --> 16:47.799
You are doubting yourself.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.600
Because, you are not to pay anything here.

16:49.600 --> 16:57.670
You are not to do anything but to get your
realization, that’s all, very simple.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.180
Why should you doubt?

16:59.180 --> 17:08.750
Because your brain is such that you doubt
the right and never the wrong.

17:08.750 --> 17:16.160
So please tell your mind that just now wait
for a while, let me become the spirit.

17:16.160 --> 17:23.510
Then the same mind, you’ll be surprised,
the same mind will communicate to you, what

17:23.510 --> 17:27.059
you have achieved and what you have got.

17:27.059 --> 17:34.250
But as a result of spiritual ascent what do
you get, that’s the main point is, what

17:34.250 --> 17:35.740
should happen to us?

17:35.740 --> 17:42.799
So the first thing happens to us is that we
become, again I say you become on your central

17:42.799 --> 17:46.309
nervous system, collectively conscious.

17:46.309 --> 17:53.760
That is on your fingertips you can feel the
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

17:53.760 --> 18:02.250
You can feel the centers of another person,
on your fingertips you can feel it.

18:02.250 --> 18:09.270
You can know about your own centers, you can
know about the center of others.

18:09.270 --> 18:14.340
That is one thing that happens to you, that
you become collectively conscious.

18:14.340 --> 18:21.120
I say you become, it’s no certificate by
anybody else, but you yourself can find out

18:21.120 --> 18:33.549
that a new awareness has come on your chakras
and you can feel it.

18:33.549 --> 18:42.740
That you can feel what’s wrong, particularly,
in a particular place within your being, also

18:42.740 --> 18:48.260
you know how to cure it, how to put it right,
how to make all right.

18:48.260 --> 18:54.880
This is the first thing you get as a knowledge
of collective consciousness.

18:54.880 --> 19:04.310
Your attention becomes enlightened because
you become aware of yourself and of others.

19:04.310 --> 19:11.320
Now this awareness is very good word in English
language if you understand.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.730
Human beings are much more aware than the
animals.

19:14.730 --> 19:15.730
Where?

19:15.730 --> 19:17.330
On the central nervous system.

19:17.330 --> 19:23.000
Whatever we have achieved in our evolution
is on the central nervous system.

19:23.000 --> 19:29.260
So whatever has to happen to you has to be
on the central nervous system, so that you

19:29.260 --> 19:32.360
achieve the epitome of your evolution.

19:32.360 --> 19:39.450
From amoeba you have become the human being
and now you have to become the higher being,

19:39.450 --> 19:47.760
not a frog or an earthworm, but a higher being
who can feel another personality and your

19:47.760 --> 19:49.269
own personality.

19:49.269 --> 19:53.429
And then you have to know how to cure it.

19:53.429 --> 19:58.600
What I do is nothing, is just like a light,
which is enlightened, can enlighten another

19:58.600 --> 20:00.200
light, that’s all.

20:00.200 --> 20:04.720
You are all ready and the another light gets
enlightened.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.400
So your ego should not feel challenged at
all.

20:07.400 --> 20:14.299
There should be no fear that you are obliged
to Me or there is some obligation on you,

20:14.299 --> 20:15.769
nothing of the kind.

20:15.769 --> 20:22.580
This is the first thing happens to you, then
the second thing happens that you become aware

20:22.580 --> 20:26.950
that you are a part and parcel of the whole.

20:26.950 --> 20:31.850
Because you start feeling another person within
you.

20:31.850 --> 20:38.130
You start understanding another person within
you, not mentally, but on your vibrations.

20:38.130 --> 20:46.500
So you understand which part of your being
is not all right and which part is all right.

20:46.500 --> 20:53.590
For example, if somebody gets cured through
Sahaja Yoga and he tries to thank Me for that,

20:53.590 --> 20:57.090
or thank anyone for that, there’s nothing
to thank.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.230
Because who is the other?

20:59.230 --> 21:06.659
Supposing this hand is feeling the pain, the
another hand soothes it like that, it’s

21:06.659 --> 21:09.130
doing no obligation on this hand.

21:09.130 --> 21:14.320
It’s happening automatically because there
is nobody who is the other.

21:14.320 --> 21:21.309
So this is the second thing happens to you,
that you feel conscious, aware that you are

21:21.309 --> 21:25.260
part and parcel of the whole.

21:25.260 --> 21:31.679
Then you know the truth, what is the truth?

21:31.679 --> 21:39.090
The truth is that you are the light, that
you are the spirit.

21:39.090 --> 21:45.559
Now many people see the light and they say
we have seen the light now we have become

21:45.559 --> 21:46.570
the light.

21:46.570 --> 21:50.271
If you become the light do you see the light?

21:50.271 --> 21:52.830
You see the light when you are away from the
light.

21:52.830 --> 21:57.590
If you see the light, then it is not that
you have become the light, but you are seeing

21:57.590 --> 21:58.880
the light, that means it is away from you.

21:58.880 --> 22:04.519
So we must have a full idea as to what is
the light within ourselves.

22:04.519 --> 22:10.519
When we have light within ourselves we see
ourselves clearly and others clearly.

22:10.519 --> 22:12.970
And understand ourselves and understand others.

22:12.970 --> 22:20.399
And in that light, if you have the knowledge
how to cure, how to improve, how to cleanse

22:20.399 --> 22:24.049
yourself and others then you are the light.

22:24.049 --> 22:28.389
And that’s what exactly happens to you.

22:28.389 --> 22:39.960
Then the spirit is the source of compassion
and you become extremely compassionate and

22:39.960 --> 22:48.090
discreet, because you know which person is
all right, which person is not all right.

22:48.090 --> 22:53.799
For example a person is there who may be a
thug, he is cheating, and he says, “I am

22:53.799 --> 22:55.000
a great saint.”

22:55.000 --> 22:57.590
How are you to find out?

22:57.590 --> 23:03.919
Only through vibrations, because you become
like a computer which is connected.

23:03.919 --> 23:09.980
If the computer is not connected then it cannot
say, it is indiscreet, but once it is connected,

23:09.980 --> 23:16.250
all the programming is done in you, you start
working it out and you know exactly what that

23:16.250 --> 23:17.510
sort of a person is.

23:17.510 --> 23:23.720
As soon as you know that person, you know
what should be done about it.

23:23.720 --> 23:29.059
Even if the person is dead, even if he is
far away you can find out about that person

23:29.059 --> 23:34.809
and also if he is a great saint, a great personality,
you enjoy it.

23:34.809 --> 23:40.020
Even you enjoy the people who are around you,
whom you have missed, you never knew about

23:40.020 --> 23:41.020
them.

23:41.020 --> 23:47.130
So that first time the rapport is established
between human beings of a very pure nature.

23:47.130 --> 23:52.460
Normally there is some lust, some greed, some
sort of a relationship that exists.

23:52.460 --> 23:59.059
Here is a pure relationship of enjoyment,
every human being is a source of joy when

23:59.059 --> 24:00.740
he becomes the spirit.

24:00.740 --> 24:06.059
As soon as he becomes the spirit you start
enjoying him as a spirit and he also enjoys

24:06.059 --> 24:07.610
you as a pure spirit.

24:07.610 --> 24:11.710
There is no lust, no greed, nothing of the
kind.

24:11.710 --> 24:16.779
Nothing common, like two drunkards are great
friendly people, one of them gives up alcohol

24:16.779 --> 24:18.750
then there is no friendship.

24:18.750 --> 24:24.160
Two nations will say we are brothers, brothers,
and when it comes to reality you’ll find

24:24.160 --> 24:26.250
they are the ones fighting with each other.

24:26.250 --> 24:32.710
It can happen to two own brothers, born of
the same parents, it can happen to anyone.

24:32.710 --> 24:43.149
But once you born of your spirit, you feel
the oneness that all cells belong to one great

24:43.149 --> 24:44.149
being.

24:44.149 --> 24:50.649
Microcosm becomes the macrocosm and you do
not feel that separateness from another personality

24:50.649 --> 24:56.790
as you all the time feel you have fear, you
have apprehensions, you are bothered.

24:56.790 --> 25:03.929
But once you become that you trust and you
know that another one is a great human being.

25:03.929 --> 25:08.340
Only the human beings are the ones who have
created atomic bombs to kill each other.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.409
No animals have done like this.

25:10.409 --> 25:14.980
Only the human beings have a great capacity
to destroy each other.

25:14.980 --> 25:21.519
But all these ideas of destruction of others
goes away and you think of constructing everyone

25:21.519 --> 25:26.740
into a beautiful way, without aggressing anyone,
without torturing anybody, without trying

25:26.740 --> 25:27.880
to show off.

25:27.880 --> 25:34.210
It’s just automatically works out and this
compassion is the compassion which doesn’t

25:34.210 --> 25:35.210
talk.

25:35.210 --> 25:41.150
It’s a silent compassion which emits from
such a personality and when it emits, it acts,

25:41.150 --> 25:44.500
it works, it doesn’t talk.

25:44.500 --> 25:53.510
Such a person, even with a glance, can make
a person peaceful, can bring joy to that person,

25:53.510 --> 26:02.009
can reconcile many broken hearts, can do wonders,
can cure lepers, can cure people suffering

26:02.009 --> 26:04.370
from horrible diseases.

26:04.370 --> 26:11.799
Because joy, which we talk of, has got its
own powers and one of the greatest powers

26:11.799 --> 26:17.470
of joy is that it is the truth and it is the
compassion.

26:17.470 --> 26:22.659
Is the absolute, it is the absolute and that’s
how you do not have any more confusions in

26:22.659 --> 26:30.299
your minds because the relative world disappears
and everything gets related to the absolute

26:30.299 --> 26:31.710
that is your spirit.

26:31.710 --> 26:33.190
And this is what you are.

26:33.190 --> 26:34.629
You are the spirit.

26:34.629 --> 26:40.019
Only thing you have to just become and that
becoming is a very easy thing that should

26:40.019 --> 26:42.899
happen to you.

26:42.899 --> 26:46.690
Some people must have read some books where
they must have heard that it’s not such

26:46.690 --> 26:48.409
a easy thing.

26:48.409 --> 26:56.259
You have to do lots of cleansing yourself
and you have to go to Himalayas or some sort

26:56.259 --> 26:59.039
of a Gobi desert to take your mokshas.

26:59.039 --> 27:04.620
In any case, if you go to Himalayas or to
Gobi desert you get your mokshas all right.

27:04.620 --> 27:07.769
There is nothing to try anymore.

27:07.769 --> 27:14.460
But, it is that whatever is vital, you have
to get it easily.

27:14.460 --> 27:24.320
You breathe so easily, you digest your food
so easily, you don’t have to go to a guru

27:24.320 --> 27:26.610
or to anyone to get it.

27:26.610 --> 27:33.289
So whatever is vital has to happen easily
and that’s why you have to get it very easily.

27:33.289 --> 27:37.049
Now you may say, “Why you are there Mother,
what are you doing there?

27:37.049 --> 27:39.479
If we have to get it why not we get it directly?”

27:39.479 --> 27:42.889
You cannot, because it cannot talk.

27:42.889 --> 27:48.279
It does not have words and somebody has to
decode it for you.

27:48.279 --> 27:55.240
After decoding you must, like scientist, accept
Me just as a hypothesis and then see for yourself

27:55.240 --> 27:56.740
if it is true or not.

27:56.740 --> 28:02.120
You should not just discard it because I am
saying so or you should not accept it because

28:02.120 --> 28:08.090
I am saying so, but as scientist keep your
mind open and see for yourself, if it works

28:08.090 --> 28:09.090
you must accept.

28:09.090 --> 28:13.260
If you are honest you will but if you are
dishonest you will not.

28:13.260 --> 28:18.059
Of course this is not meant for frivolous
people who want to waste away their life,

28:18.059 --> 28:21.280
who want to go towards destruction.

28:21.280 --> 28:24.950
God is not going to fall at their feet.

28:24.950 --> 28:31.429
He selects, in a way He does select, and you
yourself were into this selection.

28:31.429 --> 28:34.440
You yourself are found out in this selection.

28:34.440 --> 28:40.430
So it is for you to understand that it is
meant for true seekers, seekers of truth who

28:40.430 --> 28:45.080
are really seeking God and not for people
who are just doing it out of fashion.

28:45.080 --> 28:50.750
I used to get some people because they couldn’t
get admission into some other lecture so they

28:50.750 --> 28:52.879
would come to Me.

28:52.879 --> 28:59.929
But some of them would get realization, despite
that, just by chance also they got realization.

28:59.929 --> 29:06.629
But such people are not serious people, they
do not develop their realization further and

29:06.629 --> 29:08.130
they end up with some problems.

29:08.130 --> 29:13.279
And after one year they’ll appear saying
that I have got this problem and that problem.

29:13.279 --> 29:18.669
But this is a science of complete understanding
of the divine laws, how they work out, and

29:18.669 --> 29:23.769
once you know that you’ll become a master,
master of yourself.

29:23.769 --> 29:30.399
So this source of joy, which is the spirit,
must be achieved and must be enjoyed.

29:30.399 --> 29:33.450
If we do not become that, we have missed the
real point.

29:33.450 --> 29:34.960
That’s what it is.

29:34.960 --> 29:42.429
Now there are many people who also come down
with new ideas, this is so, that is so, but

29:42.429 --> 29:46.460
one should understand that why do you want
represent anyone here.

29:46.460 --> 29:48.490
Why don’t you become yourself?

29:48.490 --> 29:51.200
You need not represent some other cult, some
other gurus, better be yourself.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.920
What have you got so far?

29:53.920 --> 30:00.659
It just takes a second for you to get realization,
what is the need for you to represent some

30:00.659 --> 30:06.710
other people because you have paid some money
there or because you are member of some organization.

30:06.710 --> 30:10.139
You cannot be a member of Sahaja Yoga, you
have to become.

30:10.139 --> 30:16.970
First you have to become a person with thoughtless
awareness, which we call in Sanskrit Nirvichar

30:16.970 --> 30:23.440
Samadhi, and after that you become a person
endowed with doubtless awareness, which we

30:23.440 --> 30:30.700
call as Nirvichar Samadhi This must be achieved,
otherwise no use coming to Sahaja Yoga.

30:30.700 --> 30:38.809
Because we do not want just majority, nobody
is fighting elections here, it is for your

30:38.809 --> 30:39.809
gain.

30:39.809 --> 30:46.590
If you do not want to achieve that state,
no use being here because it’s just a waste

30:46.590 --> 30:48.870
of time for us and for you.

30:48.870 --> 30:54.309
You should just understand that this is your
right to have it, you must get it and you

30:54.309 --> 30:56.080
must learn how to preserve it.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.009
And then you have to give it to others.

30:59.009 --> 31:01.499
You have to use it for helping others.

31:01.499 --> 31:06.990
For the emancipation of the whole humanity,
for the saving of the whole humanity.

31:06.990 --> 31:12.080
There may be very few, doesn’t matter, but
they have to be genuine and truthful people.

31:12.080 --> 31:17.259
If you are interested in money, by getting
some money in Sahaja Yoga, there are some

31:17.259 --> 31:21.080
people before they came in Sahaja Yoga, wanted
to make money out of it.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.960
Then we found some people who were having
power games.

31:23.960 --> 31:27.370
All this is not going to help.

31:27.370 --> 31:33.080
What is going to help us is our genuine effort
to know the truth, that’s all.

31:33.080 --> 31:39.980
Otherwise all other things are of no avail
and no help to us or to you.

31:39.980 --> 31:47.440
That’s the only thing that we expect you
to have, is a genuine understanding that it

31:47.440 --> 31:52.929
is what you have which we have to give you,
and which you have to take it, and then give

31:52.929 --> 31:56.110
it to others, what they have.

31:56.110 --> 32:01.950
Is a very simple thing, like one light can
enlighten many lights and all those many lights

32:01.950 --> 32:04.470
can enlighten innumerable lights.

32:04.470 --> 32:10.730
And the time has come and there is no need
to waste any more time about it.

32:10.730 --> 32:14.860
I hope today again we’ll have many people
get their realization.

32:14.860 --> 32:16.600
But you should not get lost.

32:16.600 --> 32:23.039
After getting realization people get lost,
and I think Christ has already described a

32:23.039 --> 32:30.010
parable where some seeds got sprouted and
got lost.

32:30.010 --> 32:34.860
So that sort of a thing should not happen,
we should have the seeds which become the

32:34.860 --> 32:35.860
trees.

32:35.860 --> 32:41.360
And you can, you are quite capable of it because
you have been seekers of ages, not of today.

32:41.360 --> 32:45.279
So you must utilize what you have had today.

32:45.279 --> 32:51.879
You must cash it, it’s your own, and as
your Mother I’m very anxious that I better

32:51.879 --> 32:57.550
deliver the goods to the right people, whatever
belongs to you I must give you.

32:57.550 --> 33:04.850
That’s how I’m traveling, today only I
came from Austria and I will be again going

33:04.850 --> 33:05.850
to Italy.

33:05.850 --> 33:11.249
And I find in Italy specially people are extremely
sensitive, extremely sensitive.

33:11.249 --> 33:18.049
The municipality itself has come forward to
help us and they are the ones who are paying

33:18.049 --> 33:20.889
for all our halls and for our advertisement.

33:20.889 --> 33:24.659
I don’t know that is possible in English
municipality.

33:24.659 --> 33:28.320
I don’t know if they’ll have that much
of awareness here.

33:28.320 --> 33:30.879
But doesn’t matter, let’s hope for the
best, doesn’t matter.

33:30.879 --> 33:36.730
Whatever it is we, I think if you all people
get your realization and establish it I am

33:36.730 --> 33:42.799
sure one day will come that we’ll have to
make this great country into Jerusalem.

33:42.799 --> 33:51.830
Is already prescribed by William Blake, and
He must have seen the future of England as

33:51.830 --> 33:58.039
something great, that’s why He wrote it,
because He was a very great seer.

33:58.039 --> 34:02.889
And we have lots of proof of that, that He
was a great seer and whatever He has said

34:02.889 --> 34:04.450
has become the truth.

34:04.450 --> 34:11.550
I’ve been here in England for the last eleven
years now, and maybe some more years I may

34:11.550 --> 34:14.610
be here, but then I have to go back to India.

34:14.610 --> 34:18.850
Before that I hope in England we’ll be able
to establish something really substantial.

34:18.850 --> 34:24.400
May God bless you all.

34:24.400 --> 34:30.290
The question part we have decided not to have
because it wastes your time, but if you have

34:30.290 --> 34:34.170
any questions you can write to Me, and I’ll
answer them.

34:34.170 --> 34:39.480
That is much better because mostly these are
individual questions, nothing collective,

34:39.480 --> 34:44.350
so is better not to disturb everyone by questions.

34:44.350 --> 34:49.600
If you have any problems you may write to
Me, you have got address, and I’ll definitely

34:49.600 --> 34:56.920
answer you, and I’ll try to do whatever
is possible.

34:56.920 --> 35:05.130
Thank you.

35:05.130 --> 35:20.560
Now we will have the experience, which is
a very simple thing; but we are not very simple,

35:20.560 --> 35:23.370
we are quite complicated.

35:23.370 --> 35:28.970
So in a simple place, like I went to Himalayas,
the foothills of Himalayas.

35:28.970 --> 35:35.040
Very simple people from the village came,
and it was said that they call the Kundalini

35:35.040 --> 35:39.070
as the Devi, is the Goddess: “the Goddess
will be awakened.”

35:39.070 --> 35:44.660
They came from twenty miles walking down,
and in a valley we had a program, and thousands

35:44.660 --> 35:45.660
were there.

35:45.660 --> 35:50.550
And they all got realization, and they got
established, I didn’t have to do much about

35:50.550 --> 35:51.550
them.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.260
Very simple people.

35:53.260 --> 35:57.430
And traditionally they know what it is, waiting
for this day.

35:57.430 --> 36:03.910
So, because we are little complicated we have
to help ourselves.

36:03.910 --> 36:08.130
And so it might take little more time, doesn’t
matter, we must have patience with ourselves.

36:08.130 --> 36:14.500
For this experience I have to say that those
who do not want to do it should go away, because

36:14.500 --> 36:15.780
they shouldn’t disturb others.

36:15.780 --> 36:21.160
To be civil and kind to others should go away,
and should not suddenly get up and walk out,

36:21.160 --> 36:23.130
or suddenly open your eyes.

36:23.130 --> 36:25.080
If you want to go away, you can go away.

36:25.080 --> 36:45.359
But if you want to stay you are welcome to
stay, but you have to do the way we tell you,

36:45.359 --> 37:06.010
because it cannot be forced upon you.

37:06.010 --> 37:20.550
Now, you will all have to close your eyes,
so you need not have your spectacles, because

37:20.550 --> 37:22.270
it also helps your eyesight.

37:22.270 --> 37:29.320
And you have to take out your shoes, because
this Mother Earth helps us a lot to suck out

37:29.320 --> 37:33.240
our problems due to the matter.

37:33.240 --> 37:40.150
Best is to take out your spectacles, because
your eyesight improves.

37:40.150 --> 37:41.990
Many a times it does help.

37:41.990 --> 37:46.960
And moreover, the attention has to be withdrawn
inside.

37:46.960 --> 37:51.060
But if your eyes are open then the attention
goes out.

37:51.060 --> 37:59.170
So, best thing is to take out your shoes and
your spectacles, and any sort of a tight thing

37:59.170 --> 38:05.940
which makes you, I would say, little uncomfortable.

38:05.940 --> 38:15.370
Anything tight anywhere which makes you uncomfortable
should be loosened, that’s all.

38:15.370 --> 38:20.530
Both the feet should be on the Mother Earth
straight, like that.

38:20.530 --> 38:24.330
In case you are sitting on the ground it’s
all right, but if you are not sitting on the

38:24.330 --> 38:30.680
ground, the best thing is to put both the
feet on the Mother Earth.

38:30.680 --> 38:35.110
And the shoes, please keep them at the back,
would be better than to keep it on the sides.

38:35.110 --> 38:36.110
At the back.

38:36.110 --> 38:37.270
You should not touch them.

38:37.270 --> 38:44.620
And now put your feet away from each other
a little bit, parallel on the ground.

38:44.620 --> 38:54.370
At the very outset I have to say that we have
to be very pleasantly placed within ourselves,

38:54.370 --> 39:00.060
because we are going to enter into the Kingdom
of God.

39:00.060 --> 39:05.950
So, we should be very pleasant about it, and
we should forgive ourselves.

39:05.950 --> 39:13.700
We should not have guilt of any kind, of any
kind whatsoever.

39:13.700 --> 39:19.440
This is one of the biggest obstacles of the
West, that everybody has some sort of a nonsensical

39:19.440 --> 39:23.680
thing called guilt, which I do not understand.

39:23.680 --> 39:28.930
Even for a small thing we build up a guilt,
because the norms are so strong here that

39:28.930 --> 39:35.970
people who do not do some small thing like
wearing a proper shoe also feels guilty.

39:35.970 --> 39:38.720
It’s very absurd to feel guilty.

39:38.720 --> 39:45.130
When you are a human being, that means God
has accepted you, chosen you to be a higher

39:45.130 --> 39:46.130
personality.

39:46.130 --> 39:48.600
So you should not have any guilt at all.

39:48.600 --> 39:58.340
Apart from that, Divine is the ocean of forgiveness,
and you cannot commit mistakes in such a way

39:58.340 --> 40:00.460
that Divine cannot forgive.

40:00.460 --> 40:09.060
So please first of all forgive yourself, have
respect yourself, because you are the temple

40:09.060 --> 40:10.650
of God.

40:10.650 --> 40:13.790
Only the light has to be brought in, that’s
all.

40:13.790 --> 40:17.120
So you must have respect for yourself.

40:17.120 --> 40:27.050
Now, the left hand is the power of your desire,
and kundalini is the power of pure desire.

40:27.050 --> 40:31.160
So you put your desire on your hand like this
towards Me.

40:31.160 --> 40:41.430
That is the expression that you are desiring
to have your realization, all the time.

40:41.430 --> 40:52.190
And the right hand has to be put on different
centers to help the kundalini to settle herself

40:52.190 --> 40:55.490
properly in these centers, and to rise.

40:55.490 --> 40:57.090
And this, you have to do it.

40:57.090 --> 40:58.830
You have to raise your own kundalini.

40:58.830 --> 41:01.560
I’ll just tell you how it is done, is very
simple, where to put which hand.

41:01.560 --> 41:08.520
Now, in the beginning you just keep your eyes
open and see that on the heart first, I’ll

41:08.520 --> 41:14.800
tell you later on, just now see, that on the
heart, then on the upper part of the abdomen,

41:14.800 --> 41:19.810
then on the lower part of the abdomen, then
going back in the upper part of the abdomen,

41:19.810 --> 41:21.410
then on your heart again.

41:21.410 --> 41:23.980
I will tell you one by one, everything.

41:23.980 --> 41:28.600
And then here, this is the center which catches
very much when you feel guilty.

41:28.600 --> 41:30.730
And it’s still very bad today.

41:30.730 --> 41:32.850
So just here, at the back.

41:32.850 --> 41:37.820
From the front you have to take the hand and
put it on the left-hand side like this, between

41:37.820 --> 41:44.230
the angle of the neck and the shoulder, and
just press it a little bit behind like that.

41:44.230 --> 41:46.070
This is very important center.

41:46.070 --> 41:51.370
And this is how I find people get spondylitis
and angina, all kinds of diseases; because

41:51.370 --> 41:52.370
they feel guilty all the time.

41:52.370 --> 41:53.370
There’s nothing to feel guilty.

41:53.370 --> 41:59.720
Then you have to put your hand here, this
is the center of Christ, and another one,

41:59.720 --> 42:00.780
here at back.

42:00.780 --> 42:06.450
And then you have to stretch your hand and
put this center of your hand on top of your

42:06.450 --> 42:12.490
head, here on the fontanel bone area which
we call as the Brahmarandra, and press it

42:12.490 --> 42:13.490
hard.

42:13.490 --> 42:16.110
And move it clockwise like this, seven times.

42:16.110 --> 42:22.930
So this all we will be doing after closing
our eyes, which is a simple thing; only people

42:22.930 --> 42:24.160
make mistakes when they do not put their hands
this way but this way, and it pains, so best

42:24.160 --> 42:27.620
is to do it in this manner.

42:27.620 --> 42:35.640
Now, all these centers we are trying on the
left-hand side, that one should remember;

42:35.640 --> 42:37.120
not on the right-hand side.

42:37.120 --> 42:43.220
Every center I’ll describe to you, and I’m
sure we’ll all achieve our realization.

42:43.220 --> 42:47.430
Now, the left hand towards Me and both the
feet on the ground.

42:47.430 --> 42:48.430
You shouldn’t watch others.

42:48.430 --> 42:53.850
This is the first time you are going to see
yourself, so don’t watch anybody else, only

42:53.850 --> 42:56.020
you have to watch yourself within.

42:56.020 --> 42:58.110
And please don’t open your eyes.

42:58.110 --> 43:01.230
Keep your eyes shut till I tell you.

43:01.230 --> 43:09.260
Now, the right hand has to go on the heart.

43:09.260 --> 43:16.570
Now, here resides the spirit.

43:16.570 --> 43:19.510
You have to now ask Me a very fundamental
question.

43:19.510 --> 43:27.100
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or you can
call Me “Mother,” whatever you like.

43:27.100 --> 43:29.420
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

43:29.420 --> 43:49.720
Ask this fundamental question with full confidence
in yourself.

43:49.720 --> 44:03.300
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

44:03.300 --> 44:04.300
Three times.

44:04.300 --> 44:10.570
Now after this a very fundamental question
again follows, just after this, that if you

44:10.570 --> 44:14.470
are the spirit, you are your own master.

44:14.470 --> 44:27.400
So you put your hand please on the left-hand
side of your stomach, in the upper part.

44:27.400 --> 44:37.010
Here, you again ask Me a question three times,
“Mother, am I my own master?

44:37.010 --> 44:39.750
Mother, am I my own guide?

44:39.750 --> 44:45.640
Mother, am I my own guru?”

44:45.640 --> 44:53.980
Three times.

44:53.980 --> 45:19.270
Now, please take this hand in the lower part
of the abdomen on the left-hand side, and

45:19.270 --> 45:25.040
press it hard a little with your fingers.

45:25.040 --> 45:30.190
Lower part of the abdomen, lower part.

45:30.190 --> 45:39.780
Now, this is a center of the true knowledge
of the Divine, the laws of the Divine, the

45:39.780 --> 45:41.360
technique of the Divine.

45:41.360 --> 45:47.820
The pure knowledge resides in this center.

45:47.820 --> 45:59.050
Now, I cannot force you to ask this knowledge,
so I would request you to say that you want

45:59.050 --> 46:00.050
this knowledge.

46:00.050 --> 46:08.730
So please say, “Mother, may I have the pure
knowledge, the true knowledge?”

46:08.730 --> 46:15.540
You have to say this six times, because this
center has got six petals.

46:15.540 --> 46:16.840
Six times.

46:16.840 --> 46:30.810
“May I have the true knowledge, may I have
the pure knowledge?”

46:30.810 --> 46:54.080
This will excite the kundalini.

46:54.080 --> 47:11.670
Now raise your right hand on the upper part
of the abdomen on the left-hand side, press

47:11.670 --> 47:13.060
hard.

47:13.060 --> 47:27.860
Here again, this being the center of a master,
a Guru Principle center which is created by

47:27.860 --> 47:37.100
all the great masters of the world, you have
to assert, to make a seat for the kundalini

47:37.100 --> 47:40.040
to rise.

47:40.040 --> 47:47.720
With full confidence in yourself, you have
to say, “Mother, I am my own master.

47:47.720 --> 47:54.160
Mother, I am my own guru,” ten times.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.770
“Mother, I am my own guide.”

47:56.770 --> 48:09.750
Ten times, because there are ten principles
of the mastery.

48:09.750 --> 49:17.330
Now, please raise your hand to your heart
and press it there, on the heart.

49:17.330 --> 49:20.410
Here resides the spirit.

49:20.410 --> 49:26.151
The truth is, you are the spirit.

49:26.151 --> 49:29.740
So now you have to assert again, twelve times.

49:29.740 --> 49:32.940
There are the twelve petals here.

49:32.940 --> 49:38.500
Twelve times you have to say, “Mother, I
am the spirit.”

49:38.500 --> 49:40.950
Have confidence in yourself.

49:40.950 --> 49:43.320
Please say it.

49:43.320 --> 49:45.680
“Mother, I am the spirit.”

49:45.680 --> 49:47.240
Believe in yourself.

49:47.240 --> 49:48.609
Have faith in yourself.

49:48.609 --> 49:58.780
You are the spirit.

49:58.780 --> 50:24.050
Now please raise your right hand in the corner
of your neck and the shoulder, on the left-hand

50:24.050 --> 50:33.410
side, and take it little backward and hold
it tight.

50:33.410 --> 50:41.160
Here is the center which goes into problem
when you feel guilty.

50:41.160 --> 50:52.250
So please say sixteen times, “Mother, I
am not guilty at all.”

50:52.250 --> 51:01.900
Divine is the ocean of love, peace, graciousness,
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

51:01.900 --> 51:12.340
So please say it sixteen times, with full
confidence that you are not guilty at all,

51:12.340 --> 51:15.920
“Mother, I am not guilty at all for anything.”

51:15.920 --> 51:17.940
Forget the past.

51:17.940 --> 51:19.960
Forget the past.

51:19.960 --> 51:24.940
Be in the present.

51:24.940 --> 51:41.200
Close your eyes in a way that there’s no
pressure on the eyes, close them fully.

51:41.200 --> 51:44.440
Sixteen times.

51:44.440 --> 51:50.100
If you still, if you still feel that you are
guilty, you better punish yourself by saying

51:50.100 --> 51:51.630
it hundred-and-eight times.

51:51.630 --> 51:58.240
That would be better then, for some people
who just indulge into this kind of a pastime

51:58.240 --> 52:01.850
for nothing at all.

52:01.850 --> 52:30.300
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

52:30.300 --> 52:58.340
Now, please put your right hand on your forehead
across, and press it on both the sides.

52:58.340 --> 53:08.050
Here you have to say – how many times is
not the point.

53:08.050 --> 53:12.480
Here you have to say from your heart, “Mother,
I forgive everyone.

53:12.480 --> 53:16.520
Mother, I forgive everyone.”

53:16.520 --> 53:18.310
From your heart.

53:18.310 --> 53:26.380
Those who say it is difficult to say are under
wrong impression, because it’s a myth.

53:26.380 --> 53:32.220
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, it’s
a myth.

53:32.220 --> 53:33.750
On your forehead, please.

53:33.750 --> 53:37.570
Not on your head, but on your forehead.

53:37.570 --> 53:38.920
On your forehead.

53:38.920 --> 53:46.590
From your heart, please say, “Mother, I
forgive everyone.”

53:46.590 --> 53:52.940
Because if you don’t forgive you are playing
into the hands of wrong people.

53:52.940 --> 54:00.270
It’s a myth, in any case.

54:00.270 --> 54:05.490
Now, take this hand on the back of your head.

54:05.490 --> 54:12.650
Just for your satisfaction you may say that
“If I have done any mistakes, oh Divine,

54:12.650 --> 54:14.890
please forgive me.”

54:14.890 --> 54:25.850
Just for your satisfaction you should say
that, because the Divine has already forgiven

54:25.850 --> 54:27.010
you.

54:27.010 --> 54:36.101
Now, please stretch your hand and put your
palm on the fontanel bone area which is a

54:36.101 --> 54:42.240
soft bone in your childhood, and press it
hard and move it seven times.

54:42.240 --> 55:16.520
Press it hard; the center part you press it
hard, the center part.

55:16.520 --> 55:35.450
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

55:35.450 --> 55:41.870
Now slowly take down your hand, and slowly
open your eyes.

55:41.870 --> 55:44.270
Now, without thinking, you have to watch Me;
just without thinking.

55:44.270 --> 55:45.670
You can do it.

55:45.670 --> 55:46.670
Without thinking.

55:46.670 --> 55:47.780
There’s no thought.

55:47.780 --> 56:01.130
Now you may put on your glasses if you want
to, and without thinking you put your right

56:01.130 --> 56:07.400
hand like this, little higher, and with the
left hand just try to see if there’s a cool

56:07.400 --> 56:11.150
breeze coming out – with the left hand.

56:11.150 --> 56:15.240
It’s very subtle, it’s sukshma; with the
left hand.

56:15.240 --> 56:19.130
Put your right hand like this, please.

56:19.130 --> 56:25.030
It’s very, very subtle, very subtle.

56:25.030 --> 56:26.550
Little higher.

56:26.550 --> 56:30.390
Maybe about four inches, five inches.

56:30.390 --> 56:31.470
Here.

56:31.470 --> 56:32.560
Hmm.

56:32.560 --> 56:40.260
Now, put the right hand on top again, left
hand towards Me.

56:40.260 --> 56:44.850
There’ll be some heat coming out, doesn’t
matter.

56:44.850 --> 56:49.000
Let it come out.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.080
Is here.

56:51.080 --> 57:01.520
There’s no thought in your mind, you can
see there’s no thought.

57:01.520 --> 57:07.760
Now raise both the hands and push back your
head, and ask a question, “Is this the cool

57:07.760 --> 57:08.760
breeze of the Holy Ghost?

57:08.760 --> 57:11.650
Is this the all-pervading Power of God?

57:11.650 --> 57:14.000
Is this the Brahma Shakti?”

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
Ask the question.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.150
“Is this the Power that does all living
work?”

57:19.150 --> 57:20.150
Just push back your head and ask.

57:20.150 --> 57:21.150
Now, put down your hands.

57:21.150 --> 57:34.390
See if you feel it in your hands.

57:34.390 --> 57:45.370
Like this, like this.

57:45.370 --> 57:51.460
Opening out.

57:51.460 --> 57:54.500
There.

57:54.500 --> 58:00.360
And you are relaxed.

58:00.360 --> 58:06.520
There’s a peace that is emitted.

58:06.520 --> 58:08.470
All right?

58:08.470 --> 58:23.580
Keep the neck straight.

58:23.580 --> 58:37.680
Straight neck.

58:37.680 --> 58:42.910
One more thing I would like to tell you – how
to raise your own kundalini.

58:42.910 --> 58:48.920
Because this is the only program we are having
here, so I’m sorry I have to tell you all

58:48.920 --> 58:50.200
in one program.

58:50.200 --> 58:53.440
But you all have to come to our centers.

58:53.440 --> 59:00.640
We have them in every corner of England and
also in London, where you can meet people

59:00.640 --> 59:03.710
and find out more about it, and master it.

59:03.710 --> 59:06.150
That’s what you have to do, on the follow-on.

59:06.150 --> 59:08.920
You must come and pay attention fully to it.

59:08.920 --> 59:11.440
It’s not only when I come that you should
come.

59:11.440 --> 59:16.380
They are all here who have known about it,
and they will just guide you.

59:16.380 --> 59:20.520
They are not going to dominate you, they are
just here to guide you; and once you know,

59:20.520 --> 59:25.420
when you become masters, then you can do the
same.

59:25.420 --> 59:29.400
Because I’m alone, and how many people can
I meet?

59:29.400 --> 59:33.460
I have to travel, I have to go in other countries
also.

59:33.460 --> 59:39.600
So, there are people who are quite equipped,
and they will tell you all about it in a very

59:39.600 --> 59:40.600
sensible way.

59:40.600 --> 59:46.520
Just listen to them and they will guide you,
and you will reach your destination very soon.

59:46.520 --> 59:50.490
You need hardly a month to understand it,
hardly a month.

59:50.490 --> 59:58.390
Now, how to get yourself into a complete protection.

59:58.390 --> 59:59.800
You have to give protection to your aura.

59:59.800 --> 01:00:07.260
So for that you have to raise your hand from
this to this, like that, seven times.

01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:12.110
Let’s do it.

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:29.810
One, two, three – this is a protection to
our aura – four, five, six and seven.

01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:42.211
Now to raise your kundalini, put your hand
while sitting down, in front of you just like

01:00:42.211 --> 01:00:43.270
this.

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.410
In front.

01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:50.380
And the movement of the left hand should be
straight like that, watching the hand, and

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:54.150
the right hand should be upward, forward,
downward, backward.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:01:00.200
It’s very simple, like that, clockwise and
this hand should move straight till you reach

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.200
the head.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.600
I’ll tell you how.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.610
Now, let’s start.

01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:07.610
It’s very simple.

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:11.620
Even a child can do it.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:19.630
Push back your head, loosen your shoulders
and give it a twist.

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:22.380
And now tie it up.

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.630
Let’s do it again.

01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:24.630
Three times.

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:25.630
See now it’s moving faster.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:26.630
Push back your head.

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:27.630
Now.

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:28.630
The kundalini moves with it.

01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:29.630
Now, this is what the Christ’s disciples
did, and people didn’t understand.

01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:33.380
And let’s have it once more and this time
three knots are needed on your head, so you

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:44.020
fix up the kundalini on top of your head.

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:57.780
One, two and the three.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:01.810
Now, you feel it in your hands.

01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:02.810
See now the ….

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:03.810
The face changes.

01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:04.810
Eyes start glistening.

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:05.810
A different glint comes in, and that’s how
you know you are a realized soul; and that’s

01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:06.810
how you know you are My children.

01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.660
But you have to establish it.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:16.650
You have to establish the experience.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:19.890
Even those who haven’t got it, doesn’t
matter.

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:25.610
Everyone can get it and you have to establish
it, and for establishing luckily today it’s

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:31.680
very easy, because we have here so many people
who can tell you all about it.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:38.210
They have understood it fully, they know it,
they know everything and they will tell you

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:39.310
all about it.

01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:41.520
There’s no secret in Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.730
Everything is going to be told to you.

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:48.960
May God bless you.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:54.520
How many of you have felt the cool breeze
on the head and as well as in the hands?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:00.470
If you have felt on the hands or in the head,
please raise both your hands.

01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:02.600
Both your hands.

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:06.470
All of you felt it!

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:11.020
Except for very few, all of you have felt.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:17.910
Those of you who haven’t felt it shouldn’t
mind, it will all work out.

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:22.480
There are people who can help you out.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.480
Thank you very much.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:04:00.900
May God give you wisdom and strength to establish
yourself as great yogis.
