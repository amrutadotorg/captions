00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.250
Today's Puja of Vishnumaya,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.999
who was the sister of Shri Krishna,

00:02:33.625 --> 00:02:36.875
was not scheduled as such in an international

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:38.750
pujas that we do.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.875
But they say for the love of God

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:50.417
when all the devotees assemble,

00:02:51.625 --> 00:02:54.750
God also has to break many rules,

00:02:55.583 --> 00:03:01.625
and that's how this puja has been accepted to be done.

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.999
At least once it should be done, I think, was a good idea.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.166
By your love

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.291
and your devotion it was desired,

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:20.041
and so this puja is going to be performed.

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.999
It's just spontaneous

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:28.125
that I happened to be in England at this time,

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.999
because this puja if ever had happened,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.875
would have happened in India.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:39.166
Because this is a puja of a deity,

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:42.291
Vishnumaya,

00:03:43.834 --> 00:03:49.041
the seed of which is not easy to plant

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:51.999
in the Western countries.

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:59.834
Now the whole shakti programming has been done

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.834
in such a way that we have Mother as a Shakti first,

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.041
the Primordial Mother.

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:11.458
Then we have three shaktis coming out of Her,

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:14.166
as you know - Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:19.458
And then we have children from them:

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.250
brothers and sisters.

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:27.834
So before the power

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500
of what we call the wife or the spouse was created,

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:34.166
is the power of the sister is created.

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:38.250
So, as you know that Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha were born

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.959
to these three Shaktis,

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:42.291
and they all had sisters.

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:45.625
And their sisters were married

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:52.458
- like Vishnu's sister is Parvati

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:55.625
and She was married to Shiva.

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:58.625
Is very important to understand

00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:02.458
that these three types of powers

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:06.959
always play on the chakras.

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:09.500
And if you understand these three powers,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:10.917
how they play,

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:12.625
then you will understand

00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:16.500
what is the importance of Vishnumaya is.

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:21.917
Vishnumaya is the power of a sister in a family.

00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:26.750
So the female is the power,

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.375
and the male is the kinetic power

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.834
which asserts the powers

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.709
of these three powers which surround him.

00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:45.959
So when the male power comes in,

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:48.750
all these powers become

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:56.583
helpful acting associates with that power.

00:05:57.834 --> 00:06:01.500
Now Vishnumaya's power is very important to understand,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.834
because Mother power is to protect your innocence,

00:06:04.834 --> 00:06:07.083
because that is the most important thing.

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:10.375
To protect your innocence is the Mother's power.

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:16.083
Now, Vishnumaya's power is to protect your chastity.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:21.667
You don't understand sometimes what is chastity

00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:24.208
and what is innocence.

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:28.959
Innocence is a power which is not acted upon.

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:31.667
Like we have electricity in our house,

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:36.583
the electricity exists like innocence exists within us;

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.083
but enactment of that is done through chastity.

00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:45.083
A person can say,

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:48.500
"I did this very innocently" - no, he cannot.

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:51.458
Because whatever you do if it is innocent,

00:06:51.792 --> 00:06:54.375
cannot be harmful to your character,

00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:58.959
to your innocence or to your righteousness.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.041
So those people who say like this,

00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:03.709
that "I did it innocently" are wrong,

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.000
because innocently if you do anything it becomes chastity.

00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:12.834
So when innocence is practiced it becomes chastity.

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:17.166
You must have respect of your chastity.

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:21.583
Chastity is the one which is Vishnumaya's power within us,

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:24.417
Gauri's power, is the pure virgin.

00:07:24.417 --> 00:07:26.125
She doesn't marry.

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:30.000
As you know that Vishnumaya was created,

00:07:30.291 --> 00:07:34.166
just after Her birth She was killed by Kamsa.

00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:40.625
Now to understand the significance of chastity within us,

00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:44.125
we have to know that chastity is the foundation

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:46.000
of all dharmas.

00:07:46.375 --> 00:07:48.750
Unless and until you have sense of chastity

00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:50.625
you cannot have dharma.

00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:54.166
Dharma is not possible because that's the foundation.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.750
It will be a house of cards;

00:07:57.041 --> 00:08:00.709
if you do not have the foundation of chastity

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.959
it will just collapse in no time.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.500
So is a very important thing is chastity

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.125
which has been challenged in the West throughout,

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:12.375
and that's why I'm saying is difficult

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:14.750
to sow the seed of chastity in this country.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.250
And that it should happen,

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.583
there must be some divine plan I think,

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:23.041
that it has happened that this great puja

00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:24.250
should be performed here.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.125
It's not a easy puja to do

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:28.375
- is to be done by people who are innocent,

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:31.834
done by people who have lead a very religious life;

00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:33.625
those who have been very chaste,

00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:35.583
have respected their chastity.

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.041
But now as you are saints,

00:08:37.291 --> 00:08:41.333
before you everything is pure and good,

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:44.583
because now you have been leading a saintly life.

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:48.625
That's why chastity has become awakened in you,

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:52.375
and chastity works in you as Gauri, as your kundalini.

00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:57.917
So if you come to the essence of religious life,

00:08:58.166 --> 00:09:02.250
of righteous life, of Sahaja Yoga life, is chastity.

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:06.250
You cannot diversify it.

00:09:07.125 --> 00:09:10.583
Now this chastity gives you the maryadas,

00:09:10.834 --> 00:09:12.166
means delimits you.

00:09:17.834 --> 00:09:19.375
(Why are you sitting here?

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:21.375
Go further, it's better to be in front.

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:23.250
This is - you are not doing the puja.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.375
If you are doing the puja, then you sit here.

00:09:25.375 --> 00:09:27.166
Otherwise, better sit down.

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.000
Better get My vibrations there,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.500
in front. Here, come along.)

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.999
So the chastity is the one that gives you maryadas,

00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:41.875
gives you the limits.

00:09:42.208 --> 00:09:43.917
How does it give you the limits?

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:48.417
Like the, in the sky is the lightning.

00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:52.625
When the two clouds,

00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:55.125
who are like Sahaja yogis we can say,

00:09:55.417 --> 00:09:59.583
came out of the sea

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.333
and pure water is

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.041
there in the, those clouds,

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:14.999
and they have to be poured out;

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.417
when they come closer together

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:23.709
and cross their limits of their ego,

00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:27.875
or fight with each other or in any way clash,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.750
is, there is this chastity,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.291
this lightning that takes place.

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:38.458
This lightning which says that

00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:41.750
"You are wrong. Why are you fighting among yourself?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.250
Why are you crossing each other's ego?"

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:46.041
That's the sister's job.

00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:48.583
Yesterday we have had many sisters.

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:51.500
Now the sister's job is not to take sides,

00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:54.750
but to show that if you cross your limits

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.250
of your brotherliness,

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:59.417
then there will be a lightning.

00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:03.166
Now this power of lightning

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:07.250
is a part of the power of Shri Krishna

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.834
which He took it out from Himself.

00:11:10.834 --> 00:11:13.750
That's why He became such a sweet,

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:18.250
gentle incarnation.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.500
He took it out.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.291
He said, "Now you've become My sister,

00:11:21.291 --> 00:11:25.959
and every time they try to misbehave you better work it out.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:31.125
And that's how Shri Krishna became such a gentle and a very,

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.709
as they call it, romantic incarnation;

00:11:35.709 --> 00:11:38.291
because He took out the sisterly part away

00:11:38.834 --> 00:11:40.041
and He worked it out.

00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:42.792
But She was always with Him

00:11:42.792 --> 00:11:43.999
and She worked with Him;

00:11:44.291 --> 00:11:46.083
because the sister in the family

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:48.792
has to see that the brothers don't fight,

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:50.875
they are all looked after well,

00:11:51.166 --> 00:11:53.667
that they are not challenged by others,

00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:55.959
that she gives them the maryadas

00:11:55.959 --> 00:12:00.041
how far to go - how far to go.

00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:02.041
Now it's very important,

00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:05.667
very, very important for all of us to understand

00:12:06.291 --> 00:12:10.667
that Freud and all these nonsensical people

00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:17.667
brought forth the theories to challenge Vishnumaya,

00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:26.208
so that we should have all kinds of funny relationships,

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:28.542
which is an impossibility,

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:30.166
is a wrong thing.

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:33.750
Now if there is any relationship like that

00:12:34.875 --> 00:12:38.417
between brothers and sisters,

00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:43.083
for seven generations the family suffers

00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:46.500
from terrible diseases - seven generations.

00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:53.792
But if there's another like Freud-style relationship,

00:12:53.792 --> 00:12:58.166
then fourteen generations the family has to suffer.

00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:03.750
So the limiting forces of Vishnumaya are such

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:07.709
that your ego is controlled, your superego is controlled,

00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:10.375
your family is controlled.

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:12.750
Everybody is under control,

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:17.625
under the guidance of this pure power of Vishnumaya

00:13:18.291 --> 00:13:20.750
which exists within all of us.

00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:24.250
And the saddest part is that

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.959
in all the Western countries

00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:29.625
Vishnumaya is sick, absolutely sick.

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:32.166
I mean, I have lost My hearing even,

00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:34.542
up to that point it has come,

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:36.166
on the left-hand side,

00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:41.625
because the sense of chastity is completely lacking.

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:44.959
We have to forget about the people now

00:13:45.291 --> 00:13:49.083
who have no sense at all, but now we are Sahaja yogis.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.375
So coming to the right point, we have to say that,

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:56.750
that many people have still some lingering funny ideas,

00:13:57.041 --> 00:14:00.083
like "I have a good friendship with that gentleman"

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.041
or "I'm very friendly with such and such gentleman"

00:14:03.291 --> 00:14:04.291
and all that.

00:14:04.291 --> 00:14:06.208
It's not a maryada then.

00:14:06.999 --> 00:14:12.542
You cannot have friendship with - between men and women,

00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:16.250
you cannot, it's absolutely absurd.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.500
In the West the whole culture is funny;

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.375
because if you go to a dinner party

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:22.250
you are supposed to sit with somebody's husband

00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:24.625
on both the sides - horrible!

00:14:25.375 --> 00:14:28.291
But in the East it's not done,

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:32.625
because the Vishnumaya is against these things.

00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:36.417
She will see to it that husband and wife sit together.

00:14:38.625 --> 00:14:41.625
Now here, as you know, the chastity part

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:43.166
is so much missing

00:14:43.166 --> 00:14:45.291
that our left Vishuddhis are catching.

00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:48.375
And when I talk about it, it catches more.

00:14:49.542 --> 00:14:51.166
Now when you say you are not guilty,

00:14:51.166 --> 00:14:54.166
you are actually admitting it to Vishnumaya,

00:14:54.417 --> 00:14:55.417
to your own sister,

00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:58.959
saying that "I am not guilty."

00:14:58.959 --> 00:15:02.166
But She doesn't like you to have the guilt upon you.

00:15:02.166 --> 00:15:04.625
The wife may like you to have the guilt.

00:15:04.625 --> 00:15:06.667
She may like that you should have the guilt,

00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:09.291
because she thinks her power is challenged

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:13.250
and that she has somebody who is her rival.

00:15:13.542 --> 00:15:17.166
But not, not Vishnumaya;

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.959
the sister does not say that.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.041
But a brother and a sister are never friends.

00:15:25.083 --> 00:15:27.041
Now in a group we are sitting here.

00:15:27.041 --> 00:15:31.375
Like that, in any group a brother and a sister,

00:15:31.834 --> 00:15:35.041
they are, they know that they exist as brothers and sisters

00:15:35.417 --> 00:15:37.166
but they don't cling onto one person,

00:15:37.166 --> 00:15:38.625
they don't talk to one person,

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:41.542
they don't get friendly with that sister.

00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:45.750
Like once we had a big fate with these Christians once,

00:15:45.999 --> 00:15:48.417
I remember, and I must be having at least

00:15:48.667 --> 00:15:52.750
thirty cousins and four, five brothers I had at that time.

00:15:53.875 --> 00:15:55.875
And we went to that function,

00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:57.500
and among Indian Christians

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.875
we have Christians from all kinds of stratas.

00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:06.375
So there were some vagabonds I think,

00:16:06.375 --> 00:16:08.834
they passed some remarks about us,

00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:10.875
we sisters, you see.

00:16:11.999 --> 00:16:13.625
We didn't know we had so many cousins.

00:16:13.959 --> 00:16:17.041
They all shot out, you see, just like jack-in-the-box,

00:16:17.417 --> 00:16:21.375
and they all took over and started beating those boys.

00:16:21.625 --> 00:16:24.125
And then we realized so many cousins we have.

00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:25.625
Otherwise we never knew;

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:28.041
they were somewhere, we were not talking to them much,

00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:30.417
we were talking among ourselves, our friends,

00:16:30.417 --> 00:16:32.166
we girls were talking to each other.

00:16:32.166 --> 00:16:34.291
Suddenly we found we have so many cousins

00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:36.999
and so many brothers. It was most surprising

00:16:37.291 --> 00:16:39.417
that we should have so many cousins there

00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:40.500
we did not know.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.291
Immediately they jumped on the protection

00:16:43.709 --> 00:16:45.834
of the chastity of their sister,

00:16:45.834 --> 00:16:48.999
because she is the basis of their chastity.

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:54.834
But normally you don't talk to your brother much,

00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:58.834
nor the brother talks to you so much,

00:16:59.291 --> 00:17:00.417
you don't get friendly.

00:17:00.417 --> 00:17:03.750
But at the time of difficulties, at the time of maryadas,

00:17:03.999 --> 00:17:09.041
at the time of consulting about something

00:17:09.291 --> 00:17:11.959
that is dear to the family, the sister comes in.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.583
Recently My own brother, younger brother,

00:17:14.583 --> 00:17:15.625
wrote a letter to Me

00:17:15.625 --> 00:17:17.583
because there's a problem in the family.

00:17:17.834 --> 00:17:22.000
Now My mother is not there, and normally a sister is better

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:26.834
because she is easily available to you than the mother.

00:17:26.834 --> 00:17:28.583
Mother is so busy with the whole family,

00:17:28.583 --> 00:17:30.166
the whole work, you know what she's doing.

00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:33.333
So the sisterly feeling is very important.

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:37.959
Now just imagine that our left Vishuddhi is so bad.

00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:45.458
It is, of course,

00:17:45.709 --> 00:17:47.834
because we have never cared for our chastity,

00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:50.709
we have not respected our chastity.

00:17:51.208 --> 00:17:53.208
In India it is not so.

00:17:53.458 --> 00:17:58.000
Women and men all respect their chastity very much.

00:17:58.417 --> 00:18:01.125
And I've asked some foreign-going boys,

00:18:01.417 --> 00:18:03.792
they said that "Though we were doing all wrong things

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:06.583
as they were doing, we all the time somehow knew

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:08.417
that we were doing wrong."

00:18:08.417 --> 00:18:09.417
I said, "How is it?"

00:18:09.417 --> 00:18:12.333
He said, "There's something like a sister's relationship."

00:18:15.542 --> 00:18:19.083
But now I can say that Indian men are also becoming

00:18:19.083 --> 00:18:20.542
just like you people,

00:18:20.792 --> 00:18:23.834
and have lost their power to keep their chastity.

00:18:24.208 --> 00:18:26.667
The men must respect their chastity,

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:31.542
because they think they do not owe anything to the chastity.

00:18:32.208 --> 00:18:38.667
And if the basis of your spiritual existence

00:18:39.083 --> 00:18:41.834
doesn't exist, you'll collapse in no time.

00:18:43.333 --> 00:18:45.250
For that I have many a times said that

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.417
put your attention on the Mother Earth, the green.

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:50.999
Green is the color,

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:53.083
if you put your attention into that

00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:57.208
then you will be saved

00:18:57.667 --> 00:19:01.417
from these errors you are committing of adultery

00:19:01.417 --> 00:19:03.125
all the time,

00:19:03.917 --> 00:19:05.417
your looking at others' sisters,

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:08.583
others' wives, others' daughters.

00:19:09.917 --> 00:19:11.083
So the relationship

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:13.792
that is now being expressed, as you know,

00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:14.625
is of a daughter,

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:22.999
of a sister and of a mother,

00:19:23.417 --> 00:19:27.083
which is a very, very pure relationship.

00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:33.500
So much so that now, supposing you use your brains too much,

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.834
then why does your heart catch - have you thought of that?

00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:42.000
Why does your heart catch when you use right side too much?

00:19:47.041 --> 00:19:50.375
What is the reason for catching your heart?

00:19:50.709 --> 00:19:53.166
Must understand this, it's the same thing.

00:19:53.834 --> 00:19:59.750
The relationship of, say, Shiva is to Vishnu in two ways.

00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:07.041
Firstly Vishnu's wife - the sister, He has married.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.959
All right?

00:20:10.166 --> 00:20:13.750
Then who is the sister of Shiva?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.458
Shiva's sister is Saraswati.

00:20:17.875 --> 00:20:21.041
If you work too much on Saraswati, heart will catch.

00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:22.959
It has maryadas.

00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:29.583
This is how the intermarriages took place,

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:31.834
by which the sister's relationship

00:20:32.125 --> 00:20:37.166
is worked out to keep your maryadas of your chakras.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.750
If you cross that,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.917
you suddenly get into the left or the right

00:20:41.917 --> 00:20:44.625
because you have crossed the maryadas of that.

00:20:45.999 --> 00:20:48.709
Now this sisterly relationship existed

00:20:48.999 --> 00:20:51.834
in other incarnations also;

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:53.750
like Mohammed Sahib

00:20:54.417 --> 00:20:56.709
had a sisterly relationship

00:20:57.583 --> 00:21:04.375
with - actually what we have to say that

00:21:04.917 --> 00:21:07.625
His sister as such was Ali's wife,

00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:10.959
but She was born to Him as a daughter.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.917
So they can be born as the daughter or as the sister.

00:21:17.375 --> 00:21:20.458
She was born as Nanaka's sister, Nanaki.

00:21:21.917 --> 00:21:25.250
She was born as the daughter of Mohammed Sahib.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:31.333
So it could be a sister or could be

00:21:32.583 --> 00:21:36.625
the daughter of an incarnation.

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:43.208
But daughter and sister are innocent, pure chastity.

00:21:44.709 --> 00:21:47.375
Now think of it, that those people

00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:53.959
who cannot understand the importance of chastity,

00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:59.375
how can they talk of any laws whatsoever?

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.375
- because "laws" means maryadas,

00:22:06.709 --> 00:22:10.959
and it has the proper sense

00:22:11.959 --> 00:22:14.458
through the power of Vishnumaya.

00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:19.917
Now you might say that not to steal anybody else's thing

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:27.333
is also not proper, because it belongs to somebody else.

00:22:27.959 --> 00:22:29.959
But who will tell you?

00:22:30.375 --> 00:22:33.625
Who is the one that is going to tell you that this is wrong?

00:22:33.625 --> 00:22:35.875
Of course, there is police, but

00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:37.625
who has told?

00:22:37.959 --> 00:22:39.375
The lawmakers.

00:22:40.166 --> 00:22:43.625
Which part of the unconscious has played is the Vishnumaya;

00:22:44.375 --> 00:22:47.999
because as soon as you steal something you feel guilty.

00:22:49.667 --> 00:22:52.625
In the law also this word "guilty" is used.

00:22:53.208 --> 00:22:57.792
And guilty comes from the left side, is Vishnumaya.

00:23:02.208 --> 00:23:06.291
So how important it is to have a sense of chastity.

00:23:06.999 --> 00:23:08.999
But we are very divided people,

00:23:08.999 --> 00:23:11.999
and those who have moral chastity

00:23:11.999 --> 00:23:14.375
may not have material chastity.

00:23:15.667 --> 00:23:18.041
Those who have got material chastity

00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:20.542
may not have moral chastity.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.375
Moral chastity comes first,

00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:25.792
that's very important,

00:23:25.792 --> 00:23:27.166
because it is innate.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:35.750
And if your moral chastity is perfectly nourished,

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:41.999
then automatically the material chastity comes in.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:44.542
But the effect is the same.

00:23:45.083 --> 00:23:49.083
Whether you do money cheating in Sahaja Yoga

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.500
or whether you cheat morally,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.208
your left Vishuddhi will be caught,

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.375
and the whole problem will start from left Vishuddhi.

00:23:57.834 --> 00:24:01.375
Now supposing somebody tries to cheat in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:01.667 --> 00:24:04.291
want to take away the money of Sahaja Yoga

00:24:04.542 --> 00:24:05.500
or something like that.

00:24:05.792 --> 00:24:08.999
Immediately his left Vishuddhi will be caught.

00:24:09.417 --> 00:24:11.999
As soon as the left Vishuddhi will be caught

00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:14.542
he will start behaving in a funny manner,

00:24:14.834 --> 00:24:16.208
the whole catch will be shown.

00:24:16.625 --> 00:24:18.583
If you become immoral also

00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:20.709
the left Vishuddhi will be caught.

00:24:20.959 --> 00:24:25.125
Now the whole guilt part comes from there.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.792
Sin against the Mother could be also an insult,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.041
in any way answering back to Mother.

00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:35.959
Many people have a habit, I've seen, of saying,

00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:37.458
"No, Mother."

00:24:37.834 --> 00:24:40.583
"No" is never to be said,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.250
because if you say "no"

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.625
that means you go to the left Vishuddhi.

00:24:45.041 --> 00:24:49.709
The Vishnumaya power will not tolerate your "no"

00:24:49.709 --> 00:24:51.000
for anything at all.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.375
Many people have a habit of saying this, "No, Mother."

00:24:55.333 --> 00:24:56.583
This is not to be done,

00:24:56.583 --> 00:25:00.709
because once you catch your left Vishuddhi

00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:03.625
all your left chakras become weak,

00:25:03.625 --> 00:25:07.583
because the chastity which is the basis of all the chakras

00:25:08.375 --> 00:25:10.000
is weak.

00:25:10.792 --> 00:25:12.709
So how much important it is

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.625
to understand the value of left Vishuddhi.

00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:20.834
All of us catch on left Vishuddhi,

00:25:21.041 --> 00:25:25.000
and we do not think that it is such an important thing.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.625
But we say, "Oh, left Vishuddhi catching

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:27.709
means I'm feeling guilty."

00:25:27.709 --> 00:25:30.792
We do not understand that "What have I done?

00:25:30.792 --> 00:25:33.959
I have crossed the limits, that's why is showing there.

00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:38.500
I've neglected some kind of a morality.

00:25:38.792 --> 00:25:42.041
I've gone on a wrong path against Mother

00:25:42.333 --> 00:25:45.917
and Father, that's why left Vishuddhi's catching."

00:25:45.917 --> 00:25:50.583
Left Vishuddhi is the indication of the mistakes,

00:25:51.041 --> 00:25:53.583
of the wrongs, of the sins.

00:25:53.917 --> 00:25:56.208
We can't afford to have left Vishuddhi,

00:25:56.583 --> 00:25:59.500
Sahaja yogis cannot afford to have left Vishuddhi.

00:25:59.792 --> 00:26:02.333
To add to the trouble, they smoke,

00:26:02.792 --> 00:26:04.333
they take all kinds of things.

00:26:05.375 --> 00:26:10.250
In India they take what you call tamakhu,

00:26:10.583 --> 00:26:14.834
is a kind of a - what leaves are these? - tobacco leaves,

00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.709
and they think they have done no wrong.

00:26:19.959 --> 00:26:22.000
But left Vishuddhi catches.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.208
Left Vishuddhi, in a way, is the gateway

00:26:26.625 --> 00:26:30.375
to all kinds of problems for yourself,

00:26:30.917 --> 00:26:34.709
so be careful not to feel guilty about anything.

00:26:35.999 --> 00:26:38.667
Moreover it's a very vicious - great vicious circle.

00:26:38.917 --> 00:26:41.625
For example, somebody has done something wrong.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:47.417
I have decided that I have to tell them on their face

00:26:47.417 --> 00:26:49.792
whether they like it or not, this is wrong,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.917
as far as possible. Of course,

00:26:51.917 --> 00:26:55.417
I try to play sometimes tricks on them to understand,

00:26:55.667 --> 00:26:58.917
if they do not understand My telling them - up to a point.

00:26:59.333 --> 00:27:02.917
And then I tell them that "Now you better get out.

00:27:02.917 --> 00:27:05.083
I cannot have you in My body any more."

00:27:05.417 --> 00:27:07.083
So I throw them out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:07.083 --> 00:27:08.542
Once they're out of Sahaja Yoga at least

00:27:08.834 --> 00:27:10.166
My headache is over.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.166
Now what I have seen that

00:27:13.417 --> 00:27:18.500
when this negativity starts acting, people,

00:27:18.959 --> 00:27:22.417
instead of facing it, facing the mistakes that "I am wrong,

00:27:22.417 --> 00:27:24.959
I should not have done it, it's a wrong thing to do,"

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.250
start giving explanations.

00:27:27.542 --> 00:27:28.999
Once you start giving explanation,

00:27:29.291 --> 00:27:35.999
this left Vishuddhi starts becoming like a bloated big lump,

00:27:36.542 --> 00:27:39.417
and then there's no possibility of curing,

00:27:39.417 --> 00:27:41.542
no possibility of cleansing.

00:27:41.875 --> 00:27:43.583
So people start giving explanation,

00:27:43.875 --> 00:27:45.999
"Why I did it, why I did this."

00:27:46.208 --> 00:27:48.667
Once it is said is wrong, is wrong;

00:27:49.083 --> 00:27:49.999
to be accepted,

00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:51.999
"All right, next time I'm not going to do it,

00:27:52.208 --> 00:27:54.125
I'm very sorry." But "sorry"

00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:58.125
seems to be a very difficult word for at least

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.125
Western Sahaja yogis

00:28:00.125 --> 00:28:02.583
and some of the Indian Sahaja yogis also,

00:28:02.583 --> 00:28:05.000
to say, "Sorry, I'm very sorry."

00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:08.291
Indians never feel guilty, is a good idea,

00:28:08.583 --> 00:28:13.583
but they never say sorry, so it's just the same.

00:28:17.917 --> 00:28:19.917
Now one has to understand

00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:22.250
that when you have committed a mistake,

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.041
you are a human being: to error is human

00:28:25.333 --> 00:28:27.000
and to forgive, divine.

00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:29.500
But you must know that you have erred.

00:28:29.834 --> 00:28:33.333
If you go on giving explanations then one thing is definite,

00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:36.041
you do not understand that God knows everything.

00:28:38.333 --> 00:28:41.500
If He says you have done wrong, then it is a wrong.

00:28:42.959 --> 00:28:44.709
How can you challenge, how can you say,

00:28:44.959 --> 00:28:46.750
"This is the reason I did it. That's the reason"

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.000
- it's the thing one must understand.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.625
Because this is the power of electricity,

00:28:51.625 --> 00:28:53.750
you must understand, gives you a shock.

00:28:54.458 --> 00:28:56.291
It shocks you.

00:28:56.917 --> 00:28:59.917
And then you realize that "I have done a mistake."

00:28:59.917 --> 00:29:02.834
So don't create a shock for yourself.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.959
Do not behave in a manner

00:29:04.959 --> 00:29:07.959
that ultimately you end up with a shock.

00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:11.500
It's - of course, the Mother's power is so forgiving,

00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:15.000
Sadashiva's power is so forgiving that you are allowed,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
and allowed, and allowed

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:20.917
to continue with what you are doing, for a while.

00:29:21.125 --> 00:29:23.583
But it's been told,

00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:25.959
is explained to you that this is wrong.

00:29:26.333 --> 00:29:30.583
But supposing you cross your limits absolutely,

00:29:30.834 --> 00:29:33.458
then suddenly the Vishnumaya appears

00:29:33.458 --> 00:29:35.792
and the whole thing gets exposed.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.250
In Sahaja Yoga you get exposed.

00:29:41.834 --> 00:29:46.917
So one must know that though this power is so helpful,

00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:55.250
so guiding, so improving and nourishing and protecting,

00:29:55.625 --> 00:29:58.250
still - up to a point.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.583
Otherwise it is She only who exposes you,

00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:09.333
because She can't bear any more this nonsense from you.

00:30:11.125 --> 00:30:12.583
So if you go on like that,

00:30:12.583 --> 00:30:14.709
She'll just see to it that She is exposed.

00:30:14.999 --> 00:30:16.333
You have seen people have been doing

00:30:16.333 --> 00:30:17.792
all kinds of filthy things.

00:30:17.792 --> 00:30:20.208
I have known many prime ministers

00:30:20.458 --> 00:30:23.208
and all these presidents and this and that,

00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:25.999
when they die - exposed.

00:30:31.458 --> 00:30:35.000
Nobody says that such and such person was a chaste person.

00:30:35.875 --> 00:30:39.917
Very few leaders of nations have got this certificate

00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:42.291
that they were very chaste people.

00:30:42.667 --> 00:30:45.999
Chastity is a very, very rare certificate they get.

00:30:46.208 --> 00:30:50.208
Because once you get a power in life

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.458
then you think you have a free hand,

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.208
you can be and you can do what you like.

00:30:56.458 --> 00:30:58.999
You can be a chaste person,

00:30:59.208 --> 00:31:01.917
you can be any way unchaste,

00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:03.417
you can do what you like.

00:31:03.792 --> 00:31:07.917
You become sort of overpowered with this idea that

00:31:07.917 --> 00:31:11.542
"I have got all the powers, now I am very well placed."

00:31:11.917 --> 00:31:17.417
And that becomes a complete delusion for you,

00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:20.333
and you forget that chastity is so important.

00:31:20.333 --> 00:31:23.417
So the higher a person is placed in life,

00:31:23.667 --> 00:31:25.583
the higher positions he occupies,

00:31:25.875 --> 00:31:35.083
the higher what you call the ego-pampering stuff he gets,

00:31:35.333 --> 00:31:39.542
the more he presses down on the left Vishuddhi.

00:31:39.999 --> 00:31:43.083
So such a person escapes into the left Vishuddhi,

00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:45.750
because in his heart of hearts,

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.000
in his unconscious he feels guilty.

00:31:48.291 --> 00:31:51.999
And the whole thing goes as a guilt,

00:31:52.542 --> 00:31:54.417
guilt in the left Vishuddhi.

00:31:54.792 --> 00:31:58.000
And when it goes as a guilt in the left Vishuddhi

00:31:58.333 --> 00:31:59.999
then it's a difficult situation,

00:32:00.208 --> 00:32:01.625
because such a person,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.750
he becomes extremely sensitive.

00:32:03.999 --> 00:32:06.667
You say anything to that person, he feels more guilty.

00:32:07.166 --> 00:32:09.792
You try to cure his left Vishuddhi,

00:32:09.792 --> 00:32:12.083
then he becomes even worse.

00:32:12.542 --> 00:32:15.458
It's a very bad situation with left Vishuddhi people,

00:32:15.792 --> 00:32:19.208
and they are the people who have left Vishuddhi

00:32:19.458 --> 00:32:20.917
always give explanations.

00:32:21.959 --> 00:32:24.667
A person who has right Vishuddhi will be arrogant,

00:32:24.959 --> 00:32:28.166
but left Vishuddhi people have a very sly method

00:32:28.166 --> 00:32:32.375
of giving answers back and explanation for everything.

00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:33.500
Whatever You say, they will say,

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.625
"No, Mother, this is this, this is this."

00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:39.250
This is one thing. Not only, it doesn't end there,

00:32:39.625 --> 00:32:41.291
it gives you sarcasm.

00:32:41.999 --> 00:32:45.500
That's why in the West people never talk straightforward,

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.083
it's always sarcastic.

00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:50.291
To talk straightforward means they think it's stupid,

00:32:50.834 --> 00:32:51.959
is unintelligent,

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.625
if unless and until you talk in a very sarcastic manner

00:32:55.959 --> 00:32:58.834
which sometimes, you know, it's difficult to reach.

00:33:01.291 --> 00:33:04.291
That's how in a very crooked way they talk.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:09.542
And that crookery comes through this left Vishuddhi problem.

00:33:09.542 --> 00:33:11.500
If your left Vishuddhi is so bad,

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:17.166
you cannot achieve anything that is sweet,

00:33:17.667 --> 00:33:19.083
that is beautiful,

00:33:20.625 --> 00:33:22.291
that's appreciative.

00:33:23.875 --> 00:33:26.834
Left Vishuddhi will never appreciate.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:28.834
Those who suffer from left Vishuddhi

00:33:28.834 --> 00:33:31.250
can never appreciate another person, can never.

00:33:31.959 --> 00:33:34.250
It will have its own say, it will think, "I'm the best"

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.542
because it has to exist,

00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:39.500
that problem has to exist, so how?

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.375
It's a kind of a perverted ego

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:44.083
that doesn't want to accept

00:33:44.083 --> 00:33:45.709
that anybody can be better than me,

00:33:45.709 --> 00:33:47.417
that anybody I have to follow,

00:33:47.667 --> 00:33:50.417
that I have to take some lessons from another one.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:51.999
I've had many examples;

00:33:51.999 --> 00:33:53.959
I see specially people who are with Me,

00:33:53.959 --> 00:33:57.250
I find they get into left Vishuddhi very fast

00:33:57.959 --> 00:34:00.875
because they lack in protocol.

00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:02.875
Once they start lacking in protocol

00:34:02.875 --> 00:34:05.250
they go into left Vishuddhi.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.834
So to be with Me is a blessing, no doubt,

00:34:08.083 --> 00:34:11.917
but also one has to be very, very careful

00:34:12.125 --> 00:34:14.667
that you do not cross the protocols.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.917
Do not try to come over-forward,

00:34:18.458 --> 00:34:20.208
just prancing.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:25.250
Some people have a habit of crossing the limits,

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:26.959
and as soon as you cross the limits

00:34:26.959 --> 00:34:29.000
left Vishuddhi is created.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.375
There should be awe for your Mother,

00:34:32.625 --> 00:34:34.291
there should be respect for your Mother,

00:34:34.291 --> 00:34:38.041
which is guarded by left Vishuddhi.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:43.500
Now this is a very hidden power of Shri Ganesha.

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:46.834
What you call is the power of Ganesha

00:34:46.834 --> 00:34:52.417
is left Vishuddhi acting like chastity.

00:34:55.291 --> 00:35:01.750
Ganesha's power are all expressed through left Vishuddhi.

00:35:03.583 --> 00:35:06.458
So those who believe in Ganesha, in pure innocence,

00:35:06.458 --> 00:35:09.291
must know that in your everyday-to-day behavior,

00:35:09.583 --> 00:35:12.834
in everyday-to-day action,

00:35:13.583 --> 00:35:15.041
there should be chastity.

00:35:15.375 --> 00:35:19.875
Ganesha is expressed as flowers of chastity.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.625
And just see, in the divine law if there's no chastity,

00:35:24.625 --> 00:35:26.375
how do you delimit people,

00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:28.709
how do you make all right,

00:35:28.959 --> 00:35:30.875
how do you cleanse them,

00:35:31.166 --> 00:35:33.125
how do you make them evolve?

00:35:33.458 --> 00:35:37.917
Supposing a tree is growing and there's no limit in it,

00:35:38.125 --> 00:35:40.500
it just grows like a wild thing,

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.834
it has no limits,

00:35:41.834 --> 00:35:43.375
then what will you get out of it?

00:35:43.375 --> 00:35:44.583
Nothing.

00:35:44.834 --> 00:35:48.375
So to make a person higher and higher,

00:35:48.375 --> 00:35:50.041
you have to limit it.

00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:53.166
My father used to give a very good example of this,

00:35:53.166 --> 00:35:56.458
that if you take some wheat, the wheat &amp; .

00:35:56.917 --> 00:35:58.458
(You please now don't disturb.

00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:00.458
If you want to go out you can go out,

00:36:00.709 --> 00:36:04.291
but don't disturb the people, anybody moving about.)

00:36:06.834 --> 00:36:08.750
This is also another thing is, you see.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.750
All these things are nothing but

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.041
the upheaval of the left Vishuddhi.

00:36:14.583 --> 00:36:19.542
See, all this show-off or disturbing

00:36:19.999 --> 00:36:22.542
or trying to be overpowering,

00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:26.083
or very forward person or bumptiousness,

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:28.458
all these come from left Vishuddhi,

00:36:28.458 --> 00:36:30.834
because you want to overcome your left Vishuddhi

00:36:30.834 --> 00:36:32.375
so you do it.

00:36:33.333 --> 00:36:35.375
And then this is added to it.

00:36:35.667 --> 00:36:39.000
The more you try to overcome it, the more it is added to it.

00:36:39.291 --> 00:36:42.625
Now the father's story I must tell you,

00:36:42.625 --> 00:36:44.041
that he said that

00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:48.166
you have got the wheat and if you spread it,

00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:50.709
it just fritters away like attention does.

00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:54.041
But if you put in a gunny bag,

00:36:54.625 --> 00:36:55.625
in a bag,

00:36:56.041 --> 00:37:00.875
you can heap it up and it can achieve a height.

00:37:01.667 --> 00:37:02.875
In the same way,

00:37:03.083 --> 00:37:06.166
if you fritter away your attention without chastity,

00:37:06.417 --> 00:37:07.999
it spreads out;

00:37:08.917 --> 00:37:11.834
it has no limits, it has no forms,

00:37:11.834 --> 00:37:13.250
it had no shape.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.917
But if you delimit it,

00:37:15.834 --> 00:37:20.041
then you become higher and higher and higher,

00:37:20.333 --> 00:37:24.625
and you can rise higher in your spiritual life.

00:37:25.125 --> 00:37:29.709
As you are the people who want to lead a very spiritual life,

00:37:29.959 --> 00:37:36.834
you must understand that left Vishuddhi is to be corrected.

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:41.792
Now, how do you correct your left Vishuddhi?

00:37:42.709 --> 00:37:44.875
I get sometimes very tired with them,

00:37:44.875 --> 00:37:47.125
really to be - I get very,

00:37:47.417 --> 00:37:49.375
I just give them up.

00:37:49.999 --> 00:37:51.834
Because if they are catching

00:37:51.834 --> 00:37:53.291
and you tell them "You are catching"

00:37:53.583 --> 00:37:55.999
they become even worse. What a vicious circle it is.

00:37:56.375 --> 00:37:57.834
What is the cure for it?

00:37:57.917 --> 00:38:02.000
How to break the vicious circle? - is by facing it.

00:38:02.917 --> 00:38:05.125
Should say, "What, you are feeling guilty for what?

00:38:05.125 --> 00:38:07.000
You're doing the same mistake again and again,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.709
and still you're doing it."

00:38:08.709 --> 00:38:14.375
You should give all injections to yourself.

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:17.709
But instead of that they start telling Me,

00:38:17.959 --> 00:38:21.000
"No, Mother. No, Mother. No, Mother."

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.166
You tell yourself, "No, myself.

00:38:25.208 --> 00:38:28.125
I have done this today, tomorrow I'm going to do it,

00:38:28.125 --> 00:38:29.500
day after tomorrow I'm going to do it.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:33.792
Stop it now, stop." And stop at this point.

00:38:34.375 --> 00:38:37.792
There you exert your Vishnumaya power.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:41.834
Vishnumaya power has to be neutralized,

00:38:43.041 --> 00:38:46.583
if so, by your mistakes;

00:38:46.959 --> 00:38:52.000
but if it has to be brought back into its power,

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.000
you must use Vishnumaya's power

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.333
by giving yourself shocks.

00:38:59.458 --> 00:39:01.125
Then only you can do it.

00:39:01.125 --> 00:39:03.834
So on that point, on the Vishnumaya point

00:39:03.834 --> 00:39:06.000
I really fail you.

00:39:06.333 --> 00:39:08.208
You have to do it.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.583
And that's why I was thinking about this puja

00:39:13.834 --> 00:39:17.333
that when you people are doing this puja to Me,

00:39:17.959 --> 00:39:22.250
if I say anything it will create more Vishnumaya in you.

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:25.000
But that's the easiest way to manage things, you see -

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.208
"I am feeling guilty" - you're finished.

00:39:29.542 --> 00:39:32.000
"I have taken the punishment, I called myself guilty."

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:36.250
It's like in the court the jury says you are guilty

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:39.667
- all right, accept it, "I am guilty," but no punishment,

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.250
take no punishment.

00:39:42.792 --> 00:39:45.583
If you have done wrong, then punish yourself.

00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:47.583
Now there are two ways people punish.

00:39:47.999 --> 00:39:50.792
One is like some people punish them

00:39:50.792 --> 00:39:53.709
by saying that "I will not have my food."

00:39:53.709 --> 00:39:56.750
But those people who have a habit of not having food

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.417
and this thing, can also become aggressive

00:39:59.417 --> 00:40:01.417
with that kind of a habit to trouble others

00:40:01.417 --> 00:40:05.750
by not eating food. I mean, human beings are very crooked.

00:40:06.291 --> 00:40:07.750
They know how to kill themselves

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.458
with a crooked knife all the time.

00:40:09.875 --> 00:40:12.083
So that's not the way you can correct yourself.

00:40:13.208 --> 00:40:15.333
If you have to correct yourself,

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.291
then you have to face yourself in a proper way.

00:40:20.792 --> 00:40:23.166
Supposing you have done something wrong,

00:40:23.792 --> 00:40:26.917
then you should do something that

00:40:26.917 --> 00:40:29.208
you would like to do normally,

00:40:30.542 --> 00:40:31.750
and punish yourself.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.625
You should, you should, I am sorry,

00:40:33.625 --> 00:40:35.542
you should not do something

00:40:35.542 --> 00:40:37.291
that you would like to do normally.

00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:39.291
Like correcting yourself;

00:40:39.291 --> 00:40:45.667
somebody is, say, very fond of the gardens, of flowers.

00:40:46.291 --> 00:40:47.542
When you do some mistake

00:40:47.542 --> 00:40:50.333
you don't see flowers for some time,

00:40:52.417 --> 00:40:54.792
just close your eyes for flowers.

00:40:55.291 --> 00:40:58.041
Now there are some people, supposing,

00:40:58.291 --> 00:41:02.333
who are fond of singing,

00:41:04.291 --> 00:41:08.417
so if you do mistakes then just stop singing.

00:41:12.999 --> 00:41:14.959
That's how you have to shock.

00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:19.041
You must know Vishnumaya is a lightning,

00:41:19.417 --> 00:41:21.375
and the lecture has to be like that.

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:24.999
It cannot be that soft one, as Shri Krishna was.

00:41:25.375 --> 00:41:27.750
It's a very powerful thing I'm telling you,

00:41:28.125 --> 00:41:34.875
and may God awaken that power within you of Vishnumaya.

00:41:35.166 --> 00:41:39.166
It's the most powerful thing that a human being can have,

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.125
is the most auspicious thing;

00:41:41.125 --> 00:41:43.834
you become a holy personality.

00:41:46.709 --> 00:41:50.500
This is one of the ways of getting God's realization.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.625
It was a nice question aptly asked,

00:41:54.875 --> 00:41:56.417
right time yesterday,

00:41:56.709 --> 00:41:59.583
is to establish your chastity

00:42:00.291 --> 00:42:01.875
- not by giving bandhans,

00:42:01.875 --> 00:42:04.834
taking vibrations from Mother and then getting lost,

00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:07.959
not that way: you yourself correcting yourself

00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:09.834
morning till evening,

00:42:10.917 --> 00:42:13.959
and facing yourself and not feeling guilty,

00:42:15.625 --> 00:42:17.625
and learning new things.

00:42:18.166 --> 00:42:21.625
All the time is the sister who teaches you,

00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:24.875
all the time, how to be better and better and better,

00:42:24.875 --> 00:42:26.083
not the Mother;

00:42:26.375 --> 00:42:28.250
because Mother you can say, "No, Mother."

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.625
To a sister if you say - electricity,

00:42:31.875 --> 00:42:33.041
all right?

00:42:33.583 --> 00:42:37.417
Try your fingers in the plug and you will know

00:42:38.417 --> 00:42:40.458
- no explanations!

00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:50.291
With this understanding,

00:42:50.291 --> 00:42:52.667
today we are going to do the puja

00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:55.417
for the establishment of our chastity,

00:42:55.667 --> 00:43:00.667
chastity of our emotions and chastity of our mind.

00:43:01.417 --> 00:43:03.000
Now whatever you have done so far,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.750
forget it, forget the past.

00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:07.999
That is very important also to forget the past,

00:43:08.208 --> 00:43:10.166
because you see that's a very good way of explaining,

00:43:10.166 --> 00:43:12.667
"Because I had this, that's why it has happened.

00:43:12.667 --> 00:43:15.417
My mother was like this, that, and my father was like this

00:43:15.792 --> 00:43:18.750
"Mother, father, everybody you forget now,

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:21.875
you belong to this family, which is a holy family.

00:43:22.417 --> 00:43:25.792
People who are saints

00:43:27.208 --> 00:43:30.583
sitting here, among them you are.

00:43:31.417 --> 00:43:35.083
And automatically these laws will start working,

00:43:35.083 --> 00:43:36.875
and I will not have to tell you

00:43:37.083 --> 00:43:38.792
whether you be friendly with that person

00:43:38.792 --> 00:43:41.333
or not friendly with that person.

00:43:43.875 --> 00:43:46.917
You see, interest in another sex

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:51.625
all the time is not a sign of chastity.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.291
I mean, it's horrid, absolutely ridiculous,

00:43:57.542 --> 00:43:59.333
you become stupid.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.875
Like some men know so much about what women use,

00:44:03.083 --> 00:44:04.999
perfumes, this, that. What's the use?

00:44:04.999 --> 00:44:07.458
Are you slaves of women, or what?

00:44:07.999 --> 00:44:10.792
They become experts on this nonsensical thing.

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:14.709
You are men, live like men.

00:44:16.792 --> 00:44:19.999
And women have to have that sense of chastity

00:44:19.999 --> 00:44:22.709
within themselves, because they're the powers.

00:44:23.583 --> 00:44:26.417
Why are you wanting to become like men?

00:44:26.792 --> 00:44:28.875
I mean, you are the powers behind them.

00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:33.125
And women must look after their chastity.

00:44:33.458 --> 00:44:35.291
For that I must say,

00:44:36.041 --> 00:44:40.417
I must bow to Indian women for that,

00:44:41.875 --> 00:44:43.166
the way they are humble,

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.291
the way they are chaste,

00:44:45.291 --> 00:44:47.542
one has to learn - of course there are many

00:44:47.542 --> 00:44:50.999
who are not also - but the humility that they have.

00:44:52.792 --> 00:44:57.999
There's only one category which should not have humility:

00:44:59.333 --> 00:45:03.083
that is the incarnations.

00:45:03.999 --> 00:45:07.750
I cannot have humility, sorry to say.

00:45:08.166 --> 00:45:10.083
There are certain qualities you can have

00:45:10.083 --> 00:45:11.959
and enjoy and cherish, I cannot have.

00:45:12.166 --> 00:45:17.959
I cannot humble down Myself, cannot do it, I'm sorry

00:45:20.375 --> 00:45:22.417
- I'm not supposed to do it.

00:45:23.208 --> 00:45:25.625
No incarnation was humble;

00:45:25.875 --> 00:45:27.291
they cannot,

00:45:28.625 --> 00:45:31.208
because they have no guilt.

00:45:37.959 --> 00:45:41.417
I have put so many guilty people in My left Vishuddhi

00:45:41.792 --> 00:45:45.542
that My ears are getting blocked trying to clear them out.

00:45:45.792 --> 00:45:47.417
If you can clear out your guilt

00:45:47.667 --> 00:45:50.875
My ears will be opened out, My trouble will go away.

00:45:50.875 --> 00:45:52.291
So please, I request you

00:45:52.542 --> 00:45:54.667
to keep your left Vishuddhi all right.

00:45:54.667 --> 00:45:57.625
Don't feel guilty, be in the center.

00:45:58.291 --> 00:46:01.542
Be in the center, watch yourself and face yourself,

00:46:01.792 --> 00:46:03.667
shock yourself, correct yourself.

00:46:03.667 --> 00:46:06.875
Only such people will ascend.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.208
Another way is meditation.

00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:13.250
With your left hand towards the photograph,

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:16.166
with the light there, right hand on the Mother Earth,

00:46:16.959 --> 00:46:18.041
you can work it out.

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:19.583
Put the light over here,

00:46:19.583 --> 00:46:21.417
give a bandhan to your left Vishuddhi,

00:46:21.417 --> 00:46:22.375
you can work it out.

00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:26.041
But these become rituals if you do not do it from your heart.

00:46:26.375 --> 00:46:30.041
So first of all face it, mentally face it fully,

00:46:30.041 --> 00:46:31.750
then do it with these things.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.875
Emotionally understand it also,

00:46:34.166 --> 00:46:38.417
that the emotions you have should have no guilt in it.

00:46:40.291 --> 00:46:42.417
So for all our practical purposes

00:46:42.709 --> 00:46:46.959
we are not to use all such words which shows our guilt

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:48.417
- but humility.

00:46:48.875 --> 00:46:52.166
Humility is very different from a guilty person.

00:46:52.417 --> 00:46:56.250
Guilty person is the person who is under duress,

00:46:56.583 --> 00:47:00.625
under pressure, but a humble person is a free person.

00:47:01.583 --> 00:47:05.500
He is humble in his own freedom, in his own exuberance.

00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:07.875
Like the trees, when they are loaded with fruit

00:47:07.875 --> 00:47:11.792
they just bow to the Mother Earth.

00:47:12.792 --> 00:47:15.333
Like, if you go to the sea,

00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:19.709
you'll find that all the trees around the sea,

00:47:19.999 --> 00:47:22.667
specially the coconut trees,

00:47:22.667 --> 00:47:25.291
all bend towards the sea

00:47:26.208 --> 00:47:29.083
because the sea has given them that speciality.

00:47:29.083 --> 00:47:32.917
The water that is in the coconut comes from the sea.

00:47:32.917 --> 00:47:37.917
So all of them have that respect,

00:47:38.208 --> 00:47:40.917
that humility towards the sea.

00:47:41.208 --> 00:47:47.458
In the same way a person who is not guilty

00:47:47.999 --> 00:47:50.667
only will be really humble,

00:47:50.917 --> 00:47:52.667
because guilty people, as I told you,

00:47:52.917 --> 00:47:56.875
are aggressive by their sarcasm, by their nasty words,

00:47:56.875 --> 00:47:59.709
by their answering back, by their explanations.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:06.792
But a humble person is a free person,

00:48:07.208 --> 00:48:08.917
free to be humble,

00:48:09.333 --> 00:48:12.333
free to be kindly,

00:48:12.792 --> 00:48:15.000
to be gentle, to be compassionate.

00:48:15.291 --> 00:48:19.792
And that sort of Sahaja yogis you have to be,

00:48:20.083 --> 00:48:21.750
so that when people meet you

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.333
they're impressed by your humility.

00:48:23.583 --> 00:48:27.709
But humility doesn't have any subservience

00:48:28.083 --> 00:48:30.917
- innocence and humility.

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:35.999
I, I lack that quality completely.

00:48:36.333 --> 00:48:37.792
I cannot be humble,

00:48:38.125 --> 00:48:40.291
and you should never try to humble Me down

00:48:40.291 --> 00:48:42.333
because that is not to be done.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.500
But nobody can say in My behavior when they meet Me

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.375
that I'm not humble.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.959
I act as a very humble person.

00:48:54.709 --> 00:48:58.625
I can act as a very humble person but to be very frank,

00:48:58.875 --> 00:49:02.750
I have no humility of any kind within Me, no humility.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.291
Compassion is very different from humility.

00:49:06.625 --> 00:49:09.500
Humility is a human quality,

00:49:09.834 --> 00:49:13.709
is a special quality only the bhaktas have.

00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:17.875
Only the bhaktas have, it's such a beautiful quality

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.834
of taking the showers of bliss.

00:49:22.834 --> 00:49:25.959
The one who gives bliss cannot be humble

00:49:25.959 --> 00:49:28.041
because it cannot take anything.

00:49:28.291 --> 00:49:32.125
It's the only human beings who are humble,

00:49:32.375 --> 00:49:35.875
and who can take it and achieve it and receive it.

00:49:36.125 --> 00:49:42.166
And the person who cannot take is so lonely, so lonely.

00:49:42.709 --> 00:49:47.875
Such a person cannot get companionship with anyone,

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.750
because it has to give, and give, and give.

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:57.291
It's so lonely, and has to face everything oneself.

00:49:57.583 --> 00:50:01.291
Those who are humble can only become friendly

00:50:01.291 --> 00:50:05.750
with each other, can share their problems with each other.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.041
I cannot, because you have no solutions.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.959
I have to solve My own problem.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:18.291
So the humility can only help you to articulate

00:50:18.583 --> 00:50:20.583
and to have rapport with your friends,

00:50:20.834 --> 00:50:23.500
everyone, share your difficulties.

00:50:23.834 --> 00:50:26.583
But again I have to warn you because it always happens,

00:50:26.875 --> 00:50:30.041
your humility should not be sympathetic.

00:50:31.625 --> 00:50:34.166
Humility is a detached person,

00:50:34.166 --> 00:50:36.375
it's a detached quality.

00:50:36.625 --> 00:50:39.500
It's not a quality that gets attached

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.500
to one person or second person.

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:44.417
It's a humble style of life

00:50:44.417 --> 00:50:46.709
where you are not arrogant unnecessarily,

00:50:46.959 --> 00:50:48.709
you don't shout at people.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.625
But in India we say the cow

00:50:52.959 --> 00:50:54.583
is a very humble animal.

00:50:54.834 --> 00:50:56.625
It gives its milk,

00:50:57.375 --> 00:50:59.333
it provides everything,

00:50:59.583 --> 00:51:01.500
it doesn't attack anyone.

00:51:03.333 --> 00:51:06.583
So humility is such a guard for you.

00:51:07.291 --> 00:51:09.792
Of course, sometimes people take advantage of humble people,

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.625
doesn't matter.

00:51:10.625 --> 00:51:13.208
As long as you have not lost your humility,

00:51:13.458 --> 00:51:14.333
everything is all right.

00:51:14.667 --> 00:51:16.166
But people lose their humility.

00:51:16.166 --> 00:51:17.667
When people try to trouble them

00:51:17.667 --> 00:51:19.208
they become left-Vishuddhites

00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:22.417
and then they lose their humility,

00:51:22.792 --> 00:51:24.917
and that's one thing one should not lose;

00:51:25.417 --> 00:51:29.291
because if you have to keep connection with the Divine

00:51:29.625 --> 00:51:31.875
then you have to be humble.

00:51:32.208 --> 00:51:33.917
There's no other way.

00:51:34.417 --> 00:51:36.542
If you are not a humble person

00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:38.875
you cannot keep the relationship.

00:51:39.208 --> 00:51:42.999
See, two qualities, like a plug and the socket.

00:51:43.291 --> 00:51:45.166
The plug has to be the plug,

00:51:45.417 --> 00:51:47.458
the socket has to be socket.

00:51:47.458 --> 00:51:49.458
In the same way if you have to

00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:52.333
get something out of the Divine,

00:51:52.333 --> 00:51:54.166
you have to be humble people.

00:51:54.166 --> 00:51:57.208
Through arrogance you will not get anything,

00:51:57.625 --> 00:52:00.417
through aggression you'll not get anything,

00:52:00.999 --> 00:52:03.291
through anything .&amp; Some people also feel that

00:52:03.291 --> 00:52:06.667
"I love Mother," but that love is to be expressed

00:52:06.917 --> 00:52:08.917
through complete humility.

00:52:10.999 --> 00:52:12.875
That's the only way,

00:52:13.166 --> 00:52:17.083
that's the only channel through which you can approach Me,

00:52:17.333 --> 00:52:19.166
there's no way out.

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:28.667
So we end up today on a very high stage.

00:52:29.917 --> 00:52:32.417
It's the beginning of God's realization.

00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:34.875
But you must speed up with Me.

00:52:35.291 --> 00:52:37.333
It's not easy to keep speed with Me,

00:52:37.792 --> 00:52:39.625
so you have to speed up with Me.

00:52:39.625 --> 00:52:41.750
If you have to go towards God's realization,

00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:47.792
first establish your sense of chastity and humility.

00:52:51.917 --> 00:52:53.999
May God bless you.

00:53:04.291 --> 00:53:06.959
So now, we start our Puja.

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.834
You can wash My Feet if you want.

00:53:23.834 --> 00:53:27.875
The Ganesh Puja has to be there; one Ganesh stotra.

00:53:31.291 --> 00:53:33.500
Now for this you have to judge yourself.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:36.375
I mean, you have to judge yourself not to accept guilt,

00:53:36.375 --> 00:53:37.750
but to judge yourself,

00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:39.959
"Am I a very forward type of a person,

00:53:39.959 --> 00:53:41.625
do I go forward all the time?

00:53:41.625 --> 00:53:44.999
Do I sit all the time before everybody else?

00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:47.083
Do I try to be arrogant to Mother?

00:53:47.083 --> 00:53:48.875
Do I say "no" to Mother?

00:53:48.875 --> 00:53:50.083
Do I behave like?"

00:53:50.083 --> 00:53:51.500
And see all these points within yourself.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.959
It's not for others, it's for you to see,

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.375
"How far I go?

00:53:55.667 --> 00:54:00.333
Am I presumptuous, am I bumptious?

00:54:00.917 --> 00:54:03.125
Am I do things which I should not have done?"

00:54:03.125 --> 00:54:05.166
Like that you go on into this thing.

00:54:05.458 --> 00:54:06.458
These are symptomatic,

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.291
symptoms coming from inside,

00:54:08.583 --> 00:54:10.333
and once you understand your symptoms,

00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:11.375
"Oh, I am that.

00:54:11.375 --> 00:54:16.792
All right, no more." Face it, tell yourself.

00:54:19.125 --> 00:54:21.333
As soon as you say, "I'm not guilty,"

00:54:21.583 --> 00:54:24.375
it doesn't mean that you do not face it - you face it.

00:54:25.583 --> 00:54:28.000
All right. We'll have the washing of the Feet.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:39.667
Today I'm sorry, only the virgins can worship Me,

00:54:40.208 --> 00:54:44.917
only the real virgins can worship Me - little girls,

00:54:44.917 --> 00:54:46.458
if there are any.

00:54:46.875 --> 00:54:48.333
Hallo, there are, they are coming.

00:54:48.333 --> 00:54:51.000
Come along, come along, come along, all the children.

00:54:51.417 --> 00:54:53.333
Hallo, come up

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.625
Nice frock!

00:55:04.041 --> 00:55:06.375
Ah, ha! Ah, ha!

00:55:06.959 --> 00:55:09.417
Oh, very nice dress, Athena!

00:55:09.417 --> 00:55:11.458
Come, hah! Now, where are the others?

00:55:11.458 --> 00:55:13.125
Come along, all the children, all the children.

00:55:13.458 --> 00:55:15.250
Only the children can do that.

00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:20.291
All right, sit down, sit down. Come forward.

00:55:20.959 --> 00:55:23.500
Oh, somebody's wearing a sari!

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:27.000
All the children.

00:55:36.125 --> 00:55:37.875
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:55:38.125 --> 00:55:40.458
All the children have to sit down here, all right?

00:55:40.458 --> 00:55:43.041
Hallo, India, how are you?

00:55:43.959 --> 00:55:46.750
Be careful of this light, all right?

00:55:49.166 --> 00:55:52.834
Can you, can you put that to one side a little bit,

00:55:52.834 --> 00:55:54.291
for the children I'm rather worried,

00:55:54.291 --> 00:55:56.625
and then we can enlighten it.

00:55:57.041 --> 00:55:58.750
Ah, thank you.

00:56:03.041 --> 00:56:06.375
More are coming, they are in the coming.

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:13.500
In future we are going to have lots of them,

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:17.125
and maybe you will all have to sit outside.

00:56:17.125 --> 00:56:18.375
Now they sit outside;

00:56:18.375 --> 00:56:22.000
after some time you all will have to sit outside!

00:56:29.208 --> 00:56:30.375
That would be the best!

00:56:37.250 --> 00:56:39.792
They'll all say, "Out, out!"

00:56:42.709 --> 00:56:44.667
Let them grow!

00:56:46.709 --> 00:56:49.083
A new army's coming forward.

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:54.875
I think you get...can do that.

00:56:55.083 --> 00:56:58.792
You give it to him, he'll do it, he'll just, he'll do it.

00:56:58.792 --> 00:57:00.208
He'll do it carefully now.

00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:01.291
Come along, come along.

00:57:01.291 --> 00:57:04.458
Gavin, you move that both sides just a little bit.

00:57:05.166 --> 00:57:06.917
Hallo, come along, this side.

00:57:07.542 --> 00:57:10.667
Now all the little ones should come forward first,

00:57:10.667 --> 00:57:12.458
all the little ones here.

00:57:12.458 --> 00:57:14.333
One - all of you are little ones, all right?

00:57:14.333 --> 00:57:16.917
Now, who are the littlest?

00:57:18.875 --> 00:57:22.041
Now, is there anyone else coming up?

00:57:24.417 --> 00:57:27.291
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:57:27.291 --> 00:57:29.417
All right, you come here, you want to come here?

00:57:29.417 --> 00:57:32.083
All right, now, give him a chance there, all right?

00:57:32.333 --> 00:57:34.875
Now let it be. Now bring him here.

00:57:34.875 --> 00:57:38.041
Now, all the girls should come first,

00:57:38.041 --> 00:57:39.417
and all the boys later.

00:57:39.417 --> 00:57:40.750
Should we do that way,

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:43.750
or should we have the little boys first?

00:57:44.041 --> 00:57:47.166
Little boys is better, isn't it - you are sisters,

00:57:47.166 --> 00:57:48.333
after all.

00:57:48.417 --> 00:57:50.667
Now let's have the little boys first, all right.

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:53.959
All the little boys, and then the sisters will do that.

00:57:53.959 --> 00:57:55.625
Now who are the little boys?

00:57:55.625 --> 00:57:57.750
Ah, all of them.

00:57:57.875 --> 00:58:00.166
Now the sisters have to wait for a while, all right?

00:58:00.709 --> 00:58:03.083
See, see the thing, see;

00:58:03.542 --> 00:58:06.583
how easily acceptable this is.

00:58:07.125 --> 00:58:10.000
All the sisters - now she's a sister - now come along,

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:12.208
all the sisters have to go back.

00:58:12.208 --> 00:58:13.375
Did she follow?

00:58:13.375 --> 00:58:14.625
All right, you stand there.

00:58:14.625 --> 00:58:15.834
All right, tell her.

00:58:15.834 --> 00:58:17.500
You stand there. You come forward.

00:58:17.834 --> 00:58:19.959
All right. Now all the boys, come along.

00:58:19.959 --> 00:58:20.875
You come here.

00:58:20.875 --> 00:58:23.959
All the boys have to do it, all the sisters have to wait.

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.125
There's the - there are no boys there, no more?

00:58:28.375 --> 00:58:31.875
Come, come, come, come, come; come!

00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:37.250
All right. Now, everyone.

00:58:47.709 --> 00:58:53.166
If Pat's son is there you can call him, Pat's son, all right.

00:58:53.709 --> 00:58:54.709
He will do it.

00:58:54.709 --> 00:58:57.583
Everyone else should sit down. Ah, good.

00:58:57.583 --> 00:59:01.083
Now all the sisters, all the sisters are sitting down first.

00:59:01.083 --> 00:59:03.166
You see, the boys are doing first, all right?

00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:06.875
All the sisters are standing there to look after the boys.

00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:14.083
Come along.

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.375
The boys have to come here.

00:59:15.375 --> 00:59:19.250
Come, come, come; come, come.

00:59:26.375 --> 00:59:28.750
All right, let him sit down, he's the boy.

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:30.750
Come along, sit down, you are the boy!

00:59:30.999 --> 00:59:32.959
Hah! You're a boy?

00:59:33.166 --> 00:59:35.166
Those who are boys must sit down.

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.166
When you sit down, he'll sit down for a while,

00:59:37.166 --> 00:59:39.625
he'll sit down. He's a nice boy. Not to be shy;

00:59:39.625 --> 00:59:41.750
nobody has to be shy in here, all right?

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:43.875
Hah! Now come along, all the boys,

00:59:43.875 --> 00:59:45.750
those who are shy are not boys!

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:48.041
No, he's a boy, he's good. All right.

00:59:48.959 --> 00:59:51.083
If you are boys, you should not be shy.

00:59:53.959 --> 00:59:56.291
Only the girls are shy.

00:59:57.208 --> 00:59:59.166
He's shy. It's all right, don't force,

00:59:59.166 --> 01:00:01.542
it's all right, don't force the children.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.250
Ross is here?

01:00:09.999 --> 01:00:10.959
He's not here?

01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:13.500
Come along.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.875
Now you look after that side.

01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:17.625
Give him, so that he'll do it.

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:19.041
You have to wash My Feet.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:21.291
All right, come along. Say the mantra of

01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:23.792
just say it...Into your hands.

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:25.041
Please leave it to him,

01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:27.166
and you have to wash My Feet, all right?

01:00:27.166 --> 01:00:28.583
Now, be careful with that.

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:29.834
You see, that's why I have called you,

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:30.875
because they are small children.

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:34.875
Now, wash My Feet.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:36.667
Tell them how to wash.

01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:38.750
Now, one by one, come along.

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:40.625
Wash My Feet.

01:00:41.375 --> 01:00:43.417
Yes, Markandeya, you wash it, all right.

01:00:43.417 --> 01:00:44.834
Come along, all of you, wash it.

01:00:45.125 --> 01:00:46.625
Wash it, wash it hard.

01:00:46.625 --> 01:00:48.875
All right, we'll, we'll have a second group, all right?

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:50.500
And next we'll have second group also.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.250
That's good. You rub it. Rub it, rub it now.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.500
Rub it.This one also.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.500
Come along, wash My Feet.

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:59.125
Dennis, let them, wash My Feet.

01:00:59.375 --> 01:01:01.750
Come, wash, wash. Wash, wash, wash.

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:05.709
Now come along - hallo! Come, wash My Feet.

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:08.125
Wash My Feet.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.291
Good. Good. Now

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:40.291
Now the other boys should do it,

01:01:40.291 --> 01:01:41.709
all right? You've done it?

01:01:41.709 --> 01:01:43.709
All right, now the other boys should wash now.

01:01:44.792 --> 01:01:47.125
You've done it, Hanu? Washed it?

01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:48.709
All right.

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:55.041
The bigger boys. You come along.

01:01:56.917 --> 01:01:58.333
Let them wash, all right?

01:01:58.333 --> 01:02:00.542
Nanaka? Now let them wash, all right?

01:02:00.542 --> 01:02:03.208
Now you get up. You get up now?

01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:05.917
Markandeya? Let them come. All right?

01:02:09.333 --> 01:02:12.041
Ah, that's good. You also Hanu?

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:14.834
Let them come. All right? Come forward

01:02:14.834 --> 01:02:19.959
Now, come along. Done, all right?

01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:22.125
Now let the girls come in.

01:02:31.041 --> 01:02:32.917
Now the girls come in.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:35.583
Let the boys go, boys have to go.

01:02:39.250 --> 01:02:40.458
You didn't do it?

01:02:42.834 --> 01:02:44.000
All right, ask him to do.

01:02:46.375 --> 01:02:47.917
You come along, wash it.

01:02:51.999 --> 01:02:55.500
Now, all of you should get up and let the girls do it.

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.166
All right, you all get up now? Boys have to wash.

01:02:58.417 --> 01:02:59.792
I think he has washed.

01:02:59.792 --> 01:03:02.667
You washed it? No? All right, come along, come along.

01:03:05.417 --> 01:03:07.208
Put the water here.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:10.041
Let him come.

01:03:11.709 --> 01:03:13.583
All right, come forward. Let him come.

01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:15.583
Good. Get up, Nanak, get up.

01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:19.250
Danya?

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.834
Just a minute, just a minute.

01:03:21.834 --> 01:03:25.250
Some of you - I'll call all of you one by one, all right?

01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:28.500
Now, wash it. Wash it now, wash it now.

01:03:30.375 --> 01:03:31.999
Just help here

01:04:05.792 --> 01:04:08.834
Done! Now, now, let the others come in, now.

01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:13.000
Get up now. Girls have to come in now.

01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:15.500
All the boys have to go.

01:04:15.667 --> 01:04:18.125
Nanaka, you get up now, get up, get up nicely.

01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:20.375
Let the girls come in.

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.917
Now, come on.

01:04:24.834 --> 01:04:26.208
Where is Olympia?

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:31.417
You stay here. You stay here. Stay here.

01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:33.999
Girls have to stay.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.750
Boys can go.

01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:50.917
They have to go now, because this is the girls'puja.

01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:10.875
Both the hands.

01:05:24.583 --> 01:05:26.291
All right? Now wipe your hands.

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:28.750
All right, put it on your head.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:37.500
All the girls have to sit here.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:43.166
Olympia, where is she? She's coming.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.166
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down.

01:05:48.542 --> 01:05:49.792
All right.

01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:52.792
Olympia, come.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:00.000
All the girls. You washed, have you?

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:02.041
You've washed, all right.

01:06:04.041 --> 01:06:05.250
Take out this one, let's take out this one.

01:06:55.083 --> 01:06:56.166
Now take the names,

01:06:56.166 --> 01:06:59.917
hundred-and-eight names straightforward,

01:07:00.291 --> 01:07:03.166
because that's really the Gauri's names.

01:07:04.625 --> 01:07:06.875
Hard.

01:07:12.625 --> 01:07:14.166
Rub it hard. All right.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:25.834
No, no. You must take My name, Gavin,

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:28.125
otherwise vibrations don't flow.

01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:30.458
You have to say full thing - what can I do,

01:07:30.458 --> 01:07:32.625
because there's the limit.

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:00.667
You want to do it?

01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:04.417
You can come. Be careful, all right?

01:10:04.417 --> 01:10:06.250
Because everything comes in the photograph.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.041
Now just a minute, just a minute.

01:11:13.417 --> 01:11:15.500
I'll ask everybody to help.

01:11:16.291 --> 01:11:17.291
Now don't fight.

01:11:17.291 --> 01:11:18.625
Everybody will be doing it.

01:11:18.625 --> 01:11:21.125
Girls will go away. Just put it here.

01:14:02.458 --> 01:14:06.500
Thank you very much. It's all right,

01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:10.208
rub your hands like this.

01:14:13.375 --> 01:14:15.375
All hands become red.

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:17.041
All over.

01:14:17.041 --> 01:14:21.709
Rub it like this all over, all the fingers.

01:15:45.917 --> 01:15:47.333
Do it with your heart,

01:15:47.333 --> 01:15:50.333
because what is happening is that it's all mental.

01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:52.333
Do it with your heart.

01:15:52.792 --> 01:15:55.834
You, what you are saying is saying to Me;

01:15:55.834 --> 01:15:58.917
I'm sitting before you - fortunate people!

01:15:59.458 --> 01:16:02.917
Do it with heart, then only it will be - open your heart,

01:16:02.917 --> 01:16:04.458
and do it with your heart.

01:16:04.792 --> 01:16:06.333
Come along!

01:16:07.917 --> 01:16:10.959
Without feeling guilty, that's very important.

01:55:07.375 --> 01:55:10.333
Sari of Vishnumaya is very beautiful.

01:55:12.542 --> 01:55:17.667
Showing the two tipes of flowers and the lights in between.

01:55:20.667 --> 01:55:23.083
This is French.

01:55:33.542 --> 01:55:35.125
Big significance.

01:55:36.458 --> 01:55:40.208
French sari for Vishnumaya.

02:03:12.291 --> 02:03:14.500
Just say "Vishnumaya" - that's all.

02:03:14.500 --> 02:03:16.291
Today is not Shiva's Puja,

02:03:16.291 --> 02:03:18.959
and without His Puja how can you take His name?

02:03:18.959 --> 02:03:23.750
Just say Vishnumaya: "Twameva Sakshat Shri Vishnumaya..."

02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:43.041
May God bless you all.

02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:48.041
With Shiva's name both My Feet

02:04:48.333 --> 02:04:52.750
have become absolutely frozen. All right.

02:04:55.041 --> 02:04:58.166
All right. Bow down.

02:05:51.917 --> 02:05:53.458
May God bless you all.

02:05:53.834 --> 02:05:55.375
May God bless you all.

02:05:55.834 --> 02:05:57.375
May God bless you all.
