01:01.625 --> 01:05.999
You'll spoil the carpets, be careful

01:26.999 --> 01:29.834
Please be seated.

02:59.959 --> 03:01.333
It’s all right.

03:02.875 --> 03:06.792
I hope you can hear Me all the way, can you?

03:07.000 --> 03:10.083
Come forward a little bit, perhaps.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.583
Today is a very

04:15.291 --> 04:19.542
joyous that all of us are here in Turkey,

04:19.999 --> 04:26.917
to celebrate the Puja of Fatima.

04:35.166 --> 04:41.375
As you know about Her that She was the daughter

04:41.625 --> 04:46.667
of Mohammed Sahib and was married to Ali,

04:46.875 --> 04:50.999
and She had two children, Hassan and Hussein,

04:51.250 --> 04:55.375
who were ultimately killed in Karbala

04:55.625 --> 04:57.750
by the fanatics,

04:58.291 --> 05:02.417
who were that time called themselves Sunnis.

05:07.917 --> 05:15.999
All this happened because there were fanaticism,

05:17.333 --> 05:19.709
and the fanaticism

05:20.166 --> 05:23.375
that makes person thinks always

05:23.625 --> 05:26.709
that they are on the right

05:26.959 --> 05:31.999
and they have every right to be

05:34.625 --> 05:39.333
angry, to persuade, to convince another party,

05:39.583 --> 05:42.125
another person.

05:42.792 --> 05:45.999
And these fanaticisms grew

05:46.208 --> 05:49.333
since long – it’s not a new thing.

05:51.834 --> 05:57.667
It is so obvious now that our main problem

05:58.083 --> 06:01.999
in this world is of fanaticism.

06:02.709 --> 06:05.667
Fatima lost Her two children,

06:05.917 --> 06:09.667
and She was the embodiment of

06:09.959 --> 06:12.208
Gruha Lakshmi.

06:12.709 --> 06:16.375
She resides in our Left Nabhi.

06:16.834 --> 06:21.458
So for all the diseases that are connected with the spleen,

06:24.667 --> 06:29.750
all the problems that are connected with your Left Nabhi

06:29.999 --> 06:35.458
can be only corrected by Fatima.

06:35.709 --> 06:39.834
So you have to keep Fatima awakened within yourself.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.166
That we are here in the Islamic culture,

06:43.417 --> 06:47.500
we can say, this is place of Islamic culture;

06:52.417 --> 06:55.625
and in the Islamic culture a housewife was given

06:55.999 --> 06:59.000
a very, very important place.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.999
At the time of Mohammed Sahib

07:05.208 --> 07:09.125
there were struggles and fights

07:09.375 --> 07:12.999
and wars going on between different tribes.

07:13.417 --> 07:15.583
As a result many, many

07:15.792 --> 07:21.834
young men were killed.

07:23.917 --> 07:28.417
Only quite old people survived,

07:28.999 --> 07:32.834
and also so many women.

07:33.291 --> 07:37.999
This is the reason why Mohammed said that

07:38.166 --> 07:41.417
“You can marry four wives, five wives;

07:42.083 --> 07:47.208
but you cannot allow them to remain

07:49.125 --> 07:55.959
unmarried or they will have extramarital relationships.

07:57.166 --> 08:01.542
That will be the greatest fall for Islam,

08:01.834 --> 08:04.667
for that religion.”

08:05.375 --> 08:08.500
So He understood that unless and until

08:08.999 --> 08:13.250
women are kept absolutely chaste,

08:14.500 --> 08:17.083
absolutely pure,

08:19.667 --> 08:21.917
there cannot be the Kingdom of God.

08:22.125 --> 08:23.709
In Sanskrit there’s a saying,

08:23.917 --> 08:27.458
“Yatra narya pujyante, tatra ramante devata”:

08:27.667 --> 08:31.834
meaning “Where the women are respected,

08:32.083 --> 08:34.792
are worshipped and they are worshipful” –

08:35.041 --> 08:37.083
not that they are to be worshipped,

08:37.333 --> 08:40.125
but they are respectable –

08:40.333 --> 08:45.999
“there only exists the Kingdom of God.”

08:46.542 --> 08:51.291
So, so much responsibility is on women.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.792
So from Fatima’s life we have to know that

08:55.999 --> 08:59.333
She did not go out of Her house

08:59.542 --> 09:03.125
and She remained a housewife,

09:03.667 --> 09:06.999
and She made Her two children grow up

09:07.291 --> 09:11.083
in such a manner that they had to fight the war

09:11.333 --> 09:13.999
against fanaticism.

09:14.875 --> 09:17.667
Her husband also was there.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.750
This is how a woman of a housewife

09:19.959 --> 09:25.250
is shown to be so powerful that though

09:25.500 --> 09:27.333
she’s in the house, though she’s –

09:27.583 --> 09:30.417
looks to be just a mother,

09:30.667 --> 09:33.333
but how powerful she is.

09:37.792 --> 09:43.500
But these days a new type of ideas have come up.

09:43.709 --> 09:46.208
Men also have been very nasty

09:46.417 --> 09:49.125
and very aggressive with women.

09:49.333 --> 09:53.999
As a result we find there’s a big

09:54.542 --> 09:58.999
opposition to men,

09:59.375 --> 10:02.250
and a kind of a big rift has been created

10:02.500 --> 10:05.417
between men and women.

10:07.875 --> 10:11.709
Also the men, the way they started becoming licentious,

10:11.959 --> 10:14.375
perverted,

10:14.625 --> 10:17.333
going to bad women,

10:18.333 --> 10:19.542
the good women also thought,

10:19.792 --> 10:22.375
“Why not we also become like that?”

10:22.625 --> 10:26.166
and they also started doing wrong things

10:26.417 --> 10:28.667
which they should not have done.

10:28.875 --> 10:33.333
That’s how the whole society crumbled down.

10:34.542 --> 10:39.125
Now, the men are responsible for the politics and the economics

10:39.375 --> 10:45.000
and also the nation, as administrators,

10:45.417 --> 10:49.083
but women are responsible for the society.

10:50.667 --> 10:53.875
Whether she’s in the house or she’s outside,

10:54.083 --> 10:57.750
whether she’s working in the house or outside,

10:57.999 --> 11:01.083
she is responsible for

11:01.792 --> 11:05.417
the maintenance of the society.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.583
And there it looks as, sometimes to a woman,

11:09.834 --> 11:12.166
that she’s dominated,

11:12.375 --> 11:14.125
that her husband dominates her,

11:14.375 --> 11:17.083
that the husband’s family dominates her,

11:17.333 --> 11:19.875
but it’s the quality of a woman

11:20.083 --> 11:23.792
that brings up the level of the society.

11:23.999 --> 11:25.250
Not only the level,

11:25.458 --> 11:29.999
but also in the family she is then respected.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.542
It’s a very important role as a housewife;

11:35.750 --> 11:38.500
perhaps we never realize it.

11:38.750 --> 11:40.999
Now we see so many lights here,

11:41.208 --> 11:43.750
electricity is there running.

11:43.999 --> 11:46.999
But what is the source of this electricity?

11:47.417 --> 11:51.417
Is it not much more important than these lights?

11:51.999 --> 11:57.166
So men are nothing but, we can say, the kinetic energy,

11:57.500 --> 12:00.999
but what is the potential is the woman of the house.

12:01.999 --> 12:06.999
But these days it’s becoming a very funny situation.

12:07.542 --> 12:09.208
I was surprised when I went to

12:09.417 --> 12:12.333
Italy also, that

12:12.625 --> 12:17.917
how women have made themself cheap.

12:18.333 --> 12:22.750
And they want to look attractive to every man.

12:22.999 --> 12:24.999
What is the need?

12:25.999 --> 12:28.834
It’s a joyless pursuit into which men are going,

12:29.000 --> 12:33.208
and women are making themselves absolutely cheap.

12:34.458 --> 12:37.750
This cheapness of women

12:38.000 --> 12:41.667
is not going to give them any strength or joy.

12:41.917 --> 12:44.709
I know one feels very unhappy

12:44.959 --> 12:47.375
the way men treat them.

12:47.625 --> 12:50.291
But you must have your own personality,

12:50.542 --> 12:53.917
you must have your own understanding

12:54.125 --> 12:57.458
that you are a woman, you are shakti,

12:58.166 --> 13:01.458
and nobody can suppress the shakti.

13:01.709 --> 13:05.709
But if you do not keep to your own

13:05.959 --> 13:08.625
personality or your chastity,

13:09.125 --> 13:11.750
then you cannot achieve

13:13.083 --> 13:15.166
your goal in life.

13:15.417 --> 13:20.625
And your goal in life is to give power to your son,

13:20.875 --> 13:22.999
to your husband,

13:23.458 --> 13:27.166
to all the society the woman gives power.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.542
I am also a woman, as you know,

13:29.834 --> 13:32.709
and I also have a family.

13:33.542 --> 13:36.083
With all the powers that I have,

13:36.375 --> 13:40.999
I never showed them that I have those powers.

13:41.417 --> 13:43.625
I always listened to My husband, obeyed him

13:43.834 --> 13:46.583
though sometimes he was very unreasonable also.

13:46.875 --> 13:49.750
And he also came from a society

13:49.959 --> 13:53.999
which was more Islamic-oriented.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.333
But that was just a joke for Me,

13:59.583 --> 14:01.291
because I thought

14:01.500 --> 14:04.208
“He’s just like a child

14:04.458 --> 14:07.375
and I have to be

14:08.999 --> 14:11.875
very patient with him.”

14:12.291 --> 14:14.583
He always says that because of My powers

14:14.875 --> 14:16.583
he earned everything in life.

14:16.792 --> 14:19.375
Always, in the of everyone he says so.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.750
I don’t know that part, but definitely

14:21.959 --> 14:26.875
I feel very satisfied with My own married life.

14:27.291 --> 14:30.417
I never think the way other people think

14:30.667 --> 14:32.750
that we must try to dominate the husband,

14:32.999 --> 14:36.458
we must fight him, we must have a right to do this.

14:36.709 --> 14:40.999
Our right is within ourselves, within our powers.

14:41.917 --> 14:46.709
Also the men must realize that they have to respect women.

14:46.959 --> 14:48.834
I mean, not to such an extent that she tells you

14:49.041 --> 14:50.208
to do something wrong,

14:50.500 --> 14:52.750
and you just get lost with this – that’s not the way.

14:52.999 --> 14:56.667
That’s slavishness. Men have to be men.

14:57.834 --> 15:01.083
It in no way means the women are dominated by men.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.999
I do not say it that way;

15:04.417 --> 15:06.999
because if you have your own powers,

15:07.208 --> 15:08.792
ultimately whatever may be the husband,

15:09.000 --> 15:12.625
he’ll have to come and

15:13.417 --> 15:17.291
understand what you want.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.333
He’ll have to know what you are.

15:20.583 --> 15:23.458
I have seen it many-a-times in My own lifetime

15:23.667 --> 15:26.625
that it has done that way.

15:26.875 --> 15:29.208
I would never say anything.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.083
Supposing he gets angry, I would keep quiet.

15:32.333 --> 15:33.750
All right.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.999
After all he has to fight outside

15:36.208 --> 15:38.166
and he has to take out temper on Me

15:38.417 --> 15:39.458
that he couldn’t do:

15:39.667 --> 15:41.208
if he does this to others they will beat him,

15:41.417 --> 15:43.875
so it’s better he takes out temper on Me.

15:44.041 --> 15:46.583
And I never, never felt that way

15:46.834 --> 15:48.041
that he’s dominating Me.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.125
Only thing I thought, he’s taking out his temper.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.999
But I’ve seen that whenever

15:54.208 --> 15:59.333
I said something to him, he thought about it.

15:59.583 --> 16:03.999
In his lifetime I’ve taken eleven decisions;

16:04.333 --> 16:06.999
and all these decisions

16:07.291 --> 16:10.333
he still remembers one by one

16:10.542 --> 16:13.709
and knows that it was very, very important.

16:13.959 --> 16:17.291
Other things I never tell him what to do.

16:17.583 --> 16:21.999
Whatever was most important is the principle.

16:22.417 --> 16:26.166
Now, he also realized that

16:26.375 --> 16:28.999
I have a very important mission.

16:29.250 --> 16:32.333
So he gave Me money, he gave Me time, gave Me all freedom.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.500
But first I had to establish Myself

16:35.750 --> 16:39.999
as a very sensible, devoted wife.

16:42.417 --> 16:45.959
The men as a whole are very different type,

16:46.125 --> 16:47.875
you must understand.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.375
They are extroverts,

16:50.583 --> 16:51.834
and whatever the women care

16:52.041 --> 16:54.083
too much for, they do not.

16:54.333 --> 16:55.792
It’s all right,

16:56.041 --> 17:00.000
because women and men are complementary.

17:00.834 --> 17:04.417
Like Ali was there outside working everything out,

17:04.667 --> 17:09.417
while Fatima Bi in the house, home,

17:09.667 --> 17:10.999
who never went out,

17:11.208 --> 17:12.875
but he knew his source of energy

17:13.083 --> 17:16.333
from where it was coming.

17:19.125 --> 17:22.458
Because women were never respected as shakti,

17:22.750 --> 17:28.417
they started getting drifted into this Western modern ideas

17:28.625 --> 17:30.750
that “we have to fight men,

17:31.000 --> 17:33.834
they are problematic, they are troubling us

17:34.000 --> 17:37.792
and we should take revenge.”

17:38.000 --> 17:41.458
That’s how society cannot work out.

17:42.917 --> 17:45.750
Responsibility of the women is much greater

17:45.999 --> 17:48.208
than that of men.

17:48.417 --> 17:51.083
Men have to just go to offices,

17:52.999 --> 17:55.999
work it out something, come back home.

17:56.375 --> 18:01.542
Women have to lifelong generate the energy

18:01.750 --> 18:03.750
for the growth of the children,

18:04.041 --> 18:05.750
the protection of the husband,

18:05.999 --> 18:09.291
for all the sensible things that she has to do.

18:09.625 --> 18:11.291
That’s why in India we say,

18:11.583 --> 18:15.999
“A woman is to be absolutely respected,

18:16.542 --> 18:19.166
and she has to be respectable.”

18:19.417 --> 18:21.667
Moreover it is not only in India,

18:21.917 --> 18:25.166
I’ve seen it all over that women

18:25.417 --> 18:28.208
are always respected if they are housewives.

18:28.458 --> 18:30.417
For example,

18:30.999 --> 18:34.667
I go with My husband to some function.

18:35.417 --> 18:38.583
I’m respected as much as he is respected.

18:38.792 --> 18:39.583
For example,

18:39.834 --> 18:42.999
his deputy won’t be respected as I am respected,

18:43.291 --> 18:45.542
his secretary won’t be respected.

18:45.959 --> 18:46.917
No one.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.917
I, as his wife, is respected the same way

18:50.083 --> 18:52.709
because I’m his wife.

18:54.208 --> 18:57.333
Nobody looks down upon Me

18:57.542 --> 18:59.583
because I’m somebody’s wife.

18:59.875 --> 19:01.834
Is all over it is like this.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.709
I’ll give you a case of a lady I knew.

19:04.999 --> 19:07.250
She used to think she’s a very smart person, you know,

19:07.583 --> 19:09.667
always looked after her body and just

19:09.917 --> 19:11.999
to be thin and all that,

19:11.999 --> 19:14.375
and she wanted to all the men

19:15.542 --> 19:16.834
and all kinds of things,

19:17.041 --> 19:19.999
she would wear, you see, jeans and, you know, quite old lady.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.500
And her husband was a big man

19:22.750 --> 19:24.999
he was a chief cabinet secretary,

19:25.208 --> 19:27.208
very senior to us.

19:27.458 --> 19:31.166
So one day we were all invited for a dinner.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.792
So, she was not there.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.542
So many asked him, so many people,

19:37.792 --> 19:40.291
“Where is your wife, where is your wife?”

19:40.542 --> 19:42.375
He said, “I don’t know where she is.

19:42.583 --> 19:44.834
She was to come here.”

19:45.041 --> 19:47.250
I was also thinking where is she, where is she gone,

19:47.417 --> 19:51.000
because there was a seat for her, a special seat.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.458
So before sitting for the dinner

19:54.750 --> 19:57.750
I went for, I went into the bathroom.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.792
And there the poor thing was sitting on one corner.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.999
I said, “Why are you sitting here?”

20:04.750 --> 20:07.166
So she said, “They made me sit here.

20:07.375 --> 20:09.417
I don’t know what to do.”

20:09.667 --> 20:12.417
So I brought her out. I said,

20:12.667 --> 20:14.125
“Why did you make her sit there?”

20:14.375 --> 20:15.999
And she was thinking she’s very smart

20:16.208 --> 20:17.750
she’s done her hair nicely,

20:17.999 --> 20:20.375
she’s looking like an actress.

20:20.625 --> 20:23.000
“Oh, is she the wife?” I said, “Yes.”

20:23.291 --> 20:26.583
“Oh, my God! We thought she’s the secretary.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.291
How could she be? She has no dignity of her own,

20:29.542 --> 20:31.999
the way she was dressed stupidly.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.750
How can we believe that she’s the wife?

20:34.959 --> 20:37.625
She has no dignity as a wife of a Indian

20:37.834 --> 20:39.917
gentleman so highly placed.”

20:40.125 --> 20:42.999
And poor thing was sitting there for half-an-hour,

20:43.208 --> 20:44.709
smoking.

20:48.917 --> 20:50.792
They couldn’t believe it. Then they asked Me,

20:50.999 --> 20:52.750
“Are You sure she’s his wife?”

20:52.999 --> 20:55.959
I said, “Yes, I’m sure.”

20:56.125 --> 20:59.959
I mean, she came to the table, nobody got up for her.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.542
And they still thought, all the rest,

21:02.792 --> 21:05.375
she’s the secretary who has come.

21:05.917 --> 21:08.208
Then we had to tell them, “that’s his wife.”

21:08.458 --> 21:11.750
She was thinking she’s a smart young lady, you know;

21:11.917 --> 21:15.500
at that old age behaving stupidly.

21:15.834 --> 21:19.041
So even in the West a woman is respected

21:19.250 --> 21:21.542
if she’s a good housewife.

21:21.792 --> 21:25.583
Anywhere, she is respected.

21:25.834 --> 21:27.834
I was surprised also that

21:28.000 --> 21:30.792
I knew somebody very highly placed,

21:30.999 --> 21:34.458
a minister in the cabinet

21:34.667 --> 21:37.000
of England,

21:37.375 --> 21:40.000
and he was

21:40.250 --> 21:44.125
supposed to be little wayward

21:47.166 --> 21:50.083
and nobody would take notice of him.

21:51.083 --> 21:54.166
Nobody would. “Don’t look at him!”

21:54.375 --> 21:56.250
I was not so good at the scandals

21:56.500 --> 22:00.125
that they had in the all diplomatic circles,

22:01.125 --> 22:03.041
but I said that “Why don’t you talk to this man?”

22:03.250 --> 22:04.834
“No, not worth it.”

22:05.000 --> 22:06.291
I said, “Why?”

22:06.542 --> 22:11.917
They said, “He’s horrible. He is not a good man.”

22:12.083 --> 22:13.959
“Yes, but why? What has he done?”

22:14.208 --> 22:15.750
They said, “He’s a flirt,

22:15.999 --> 22:19.709
and he is looking at other women

22:19.959 --> 22:23.041
and he’s doing all kinds of things,”

22:23.291 --> 22:25.999
and they told stories about him. My God!

22:26.166 --> 22:29.208
Such a big man like a minister –

22:29.542 --> 22:31.792
why is he behaving like this?

22:32.000 --> 22:35.792
Like a stupid donkey, he is going about …

22:35.999 --> 22:37.709
Nobody would shake hands with him.

22:37.917 --> 22:40.999
Even men would not look at him.

22:43.417 --> 22:46.458
Now, of course, a new society is forming of all these

22:46.709 --> 22:49.417
stupid people. That’s different.

22:49.667 --> 22:52.542
But one Sahaja Yogi

22:52.792 --> 22:54.959
who will visit these places

22:55.125 --> 22:58.375
will be amazed how stupid they are.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.583
They can make it out.

23:00.834 --> 23:04.000
All of them catch on their Left Nabhi,

23:04.250 --> 23:06.792
whether they are women or men.

23:07.041 --> 23:11.834
But it’s more dangerous for men if they have a wife like that.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.458
Now, the Left Nabhi if it catches, what happens?

23:15.709 --> 23:18.208
What diseases you'll have?

23:18.417 --> 23:22.999
The first and foremost is blood cancer.

23:23.417 --> 23:26.500
With the Left Nabhi you can get blood cancer.

23:26.750 --> 23:29.208
Women think they can dominate their husband,

23:29.458 --> 23:31.375
they can do this to their husband,

23:31.625 --> 23:32.999
they can put them right, but they don’t know

23:33.208 --> 23:38.999
they are causing a serious disease like blood cancer.

23:40.999 --> 23:43.834
I know of somebody who was suffering

23:44.000 --> 23:46.417
from blood cancer, but we cured him

23:46.583 --> 23:49.542
and then we discovered his Left Nabhi was still bad.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.834
Again and again he was getting relapse.

23:52.041 --> 23:55.999
Then we found out it was his wife.

23:57.999 --> 24:01.166
She was such a dangerous woman for him.

24:01.375 --> 24:04.417
And he wouldn’t leave her, wouldn’t leave her.

24:04.625 --> 24:06.834
So I told him, “I will not treat you again

24:07.041 --> 24:08.375
if you live with that woman.

24:08.625 --> 24:11.875
Better throw her out, or you send her somewhere else.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.750
But if you are going to live with this woman,

24:14.999 --> 24:16.625
I’m not going to treat you.”

24:16.917 --> 24:19.625
He also called her and I told her on her face

24:19.834 --> 24:23.083
that “You’re a very dominating, horrible shrew woman,

24:23.333 --> 24:25.999
and if you try to torture your husband,

24:26.208 --> 24:28.999
he cannot be cured.”

24:29.583 --> 24:31.125
But she went on.

24:31.375 --> 24:35.999
And then, the end result was horrible, horrible, horrible.

24:36.583 --> 24:38.875
He developed a big spleen like that,

24:39.083 --> 24:41.999
all of it was taken out, and doctors told that

24:42.291 --> 24:45.083
“within six months you’ll be finished.”

24:45.999 --> 24:48.291
So on both the cases, I would say,

24:48.542 --> 24:50.417
the wife tried to dominate the husband,

24:50.625 --> 24:54.000
and husband getting attached to that wife still.

24:54.250 --> 24:56.875
It’s recent case I’m telling you.

24:57.083 --> 24:59.458
Now, we are husband and wife

24:59.667 --> 25:03.208
because we love each other, we are complementary.

25:03.542 --> 25:05.834
Woman is a woman, man is a man.

25:06.041 --> 25:10.500
Men should not expect women to be like you – very fast,

25:10.750 --> 25:14.999
and women should not expect men to be like you –

25:15.625 --> 25:20.834
very, I should say, noble.

25:21.041 --> 25:25.583
They are qualities of a woman and the qualities of a man.

25:25.834 --> 25:29.999
But the greatest power of a woman is her chastity.

25:30.999 --> 25:33.917
If her chastity is disturbed,

25:34.125 --> 25:37.625
then she is a dangerous person,

25:37.834 --> 25:39.999
very dangerous.

25:40.166 --> 25:43.083
She can not only harm her husband,

25:43.333 --> 25:46.999
but also her children, her society.

25:47.959 --> 25:51.999
We come from a culture which is very akin

25:52.375 --> 25:54.625
to Islamic culture also.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.667
Indian culture is like that.

25:57.917 --> 26:00.917
In the Indian culture women respect their chastity

26:01.083 --> 26:02.583
more than anything in this world.

26:02.834 --> 26:06.291
They can give up everything, but not their chastity.

26:07.417 --> 26:08.917
And once - there’s a story

26:09.083 --> 26:10.999
I must tell you, very interesting,

26:11.166 --> 26:13.959
about a very beautiful woman called Padmini.

26:14.166 --> 26:15.999
She was the wife of a king.

26:16.166 --> 26:20.083
And there was a horrible Muslim king who wanted

26:20.375 --> 26:22.792
to see this woman, because he heard she was very beautiful.

26:22.999 --> 26:26.125
See, this is, was a funny thing.

26:26.542 --> 26:29.959
And she came, and he came to that kingdom

26:30.125 --> 26:32.000
and he said, “I must look at this lady, otherwise

26:32.208 --> 26:35.250
I’ll destroy the whole kingdom.”

26:35.417 --> 26:38.583
Now people said, “This he can’t do, she’s our queen.

26:38.792 --> 26:42.375
She can’t, he can’t see our queen like that.”

26:42.875 --> 26:45.250
She just thought, “All right. He need not see me,

26:45.458 --> 26:48.500
but he might see my reflection.”

26:48.667 --> 26:52.667
So she stood before a mirror

26:52.875 --> 26:54.709
and he saw her reflection.

26:54.959 --> 26:57.000
Then he became even more mad

26:57.250 --> 26:59.500
and he said, “I must have this woman.

26:59.750 --> 27:01.750
If you don’t give her to me,

27:01.959 --> 27:04.542
then I’ll destroy all of you.”

27:04.792 --> 27:08.875
Imagine a king doing all this nonsense for a woman –

27:09.125 --> 27:12.000
shows what a useless fellow he was.

27:12.333 --> 27:15.667
So he brought all his army, everything,

27:15.875 --> 27:17.750
and settled down near the fort

27:17.959 --> 27:20.792
where these people were, and sent a message that

27:20.999 --> 27:23.458
“if you don’t send this lady to me,

27:23.667 --> 27:26.125
then I’m going to attack.”

27:26.417 --> 27:30.667
They were not prepared, didn’t know what to do,

27:30.917 --> 27:34.792
so they said that “Let us go and fight him.

27:34.999 --> 27:38.375
We cannot allow our queen to be given to him.

27:38.667 --> 27:41.999
This is a question of our prestige.”

27:46.542 --> 27:47.834
They took a hundred palanquin.

27:47.999 --> 27:50.709
Do you understand palanquin?

27:50.917 --> 27:52.750
They took a hundred palanquin.

27:52.917 --> 27:56.166
And in those hundred palanquins there were four warriors

27:56.375 --> 27:58.417
sitting with these arms and their machines,

27:58.667 --> 28:00.750
and there were two who were carrying them.

28:00.959 --> 28:03.166
And they said, “All right. The queen is coming with her

28:03.375 --> 28:06.000
hundred maids.”

28:06.375 --> 28:09.792
The Muslims that time were, the Muslim king was

28:10.000 --> 28:12.417
having his drinks and things, very happy

28:12.667 --> 28:15.208
that the queen is going to come.

28:15.458 --> 28:18.583
So these people went there

28:18.792 --> 28:22.999
and came out of their palanquins and started fighting.

28:23.291 --> 28:28.792
They had told these women that “In case we win,

28:28.999 --> 28:32.417
by five o’clock in the morning we’ll lit a fire

28:32.667 --> 28:34.291
and you will see the fire,

28:34.542 --> 28:36.250
then you’ll know that we have won the case.

28:36.458 --> 28:41.625
But if we do not win, then you should know

28:41.875 --> 28:45.000
for definite that we have not won the battle.”

28:45.834 --> 28:49.000
They were only, say, four hundred people or six hundred people,

28:49.250 --> 28:51.166
and thousands were with this man and he had

28:51.417 --> 28:54.792
guns and cannons and everything.

28:55.625 --> 28:57.542
So they started fighting.

28:57.792 --> 28:59.999
In that fight

29:00.875 --> 29:05.083
that Muslim king won -

29:05.291 --> 29:08.208
because he had so much of power -

29:09.333 --> 29:13.125
and most of these people died. Even the king was killed.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.709
There was no fire lit at five o’clock,

29:17.917 --> 29:21.417
so these women saw there’s no fire lit.

29:21.875 --> 29:26.125
So they made a huge big platform, a pyre,

29:26.750 --> 29:29.542
they climbed down to the pyre and lit the fire,

29:29.750 --> 29:34.709
and they all died. Three thousand women died,

29:34.959 --> 29:37.875
because they didn’t want other men to touch them.

29:38.041 --> 29:40.500
Any other man coming and touching them

29:40.709 --> 29:42.709
means their chastity is finished.

29:42.875 --> 29:46.999
There are many, many stories of this kind in India.

29:47.208 --> 29:50.999
So, how they respected their chastity!

29:51.625 --> 29:55.625
It’s easy, you see, to fall to some sort of a,

29:55.834 --> 29:57.917
another

29:58.083 --> 30:00.458
temptation,

30:01.709 --> 30:05.333
but if this is your power,

30:05.667 --> 30:07.792
why you should submit yourself

30:07.999 --> 30:10.999
to something which is so useless?

30:11.208 --> 30:14.000
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize.

30:14.333 --> 30:16.750
Men also must know that if their

30:16.959 --> 30:19.875
wives are so chaste and so good,

30:20.083 --> 30:22.250
they must respect them.

30:22.458 --> 30:26.250
They should also realize that they have also rakhi sisters,

30:26.500 --> 30:29.709
which is that we are very chaste people.

30:29.917 --> 30:33.208
We respect the chastity of a rakhi sister

30:33.583 --> 30:38.625
and we do not want to in any way to comply with anyone

30:38.917 --> 30:41.375
who does not respect the chastity.

30:41.583 --> 30:44.333
Then the men also become chaste.

30:44.542 --> 30:47.375
When the women are chaste men also become chaste.

30:47.625 --> 30:50.875
And this chastity is your main power,

30:51.083 --> 30:56.000
is this chastity is the one is the power of Shri Ganesha.

30:56.375 --> 30:59.291
And when you get this Shri Ganesha’s power,

30:59.500 --> 31:02.834
you know how powerful you become

31:03.000 --> 31:06.625
with the innocence that is awakened within you.

31:06.875 --> 31:10.166
So without the chastity the women cannot achieve

31:10.458 --> 31:14.125
anything in Sahaja Yoga.

31:14.375 --> 31:17.792
One has to give up all the past ideas,

31:17.999 --> 31:22.375
all the past things, and also the way there is bombardment

31:22.625 --> 31:26.999
from the newspapers, from the media, from everything.

31:27.166 --> 31:29.458
Recently I read a beautiful book,

31:29.709 --> 31:34.999
so big as that, has come out that Media Versus America.

31:35.583 --> 31:40.333
In that they have said that how this media has put

31:40.583 --> 31:45.000
ideas into the heads of women and men,

31:45.999 --> 31:51.291
decrying the utility of married life

31:51.542 --> 31:54.542
how they have killed the married life.

31:55.667 --> 31:59.458
They marry, then divorce; they marry, then divorce.

31:59.709 --> 32:02.999
The same thing goes on all the time.

32:03.208 --> 32:05.500
In Sahaja Yoga, of course, it’s not that bad.

32:05.750 --> 32:09.542
We had eighty-six weddings this time. Eighty-six.

32:09.917 --> 32:12.834
Out of which one was about to fizzle out;

32:13.000 --> 32:15.500
that also is established.

32:16.291 --> 32:18.500
In Sahaja Yoga it’s much better.

32:18.750 --> 32:21.709
People understand the importance of married life.

32:21.999 --> 32:25.999
It’s a drama, but also it is tapas,

32:26.208 --> 32:30.999
it is a tapasya with which you understand

32:31.583 --> 32:33.999
your own powers.

32:34.166 --> 32:36.959
I would say a man is like the sun, but

32:37.125 --> 32:41.166
the woman is like the Mother Earth.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.875
The difference is like this:

32:44.166 --> 32:47.291
that the sun shines, gives light,

32:47.917 --> 32:52.125
it gives also nourishment to the Mother Earth in a way;

32:53.083 --> 32:55.417
and the Mother Earth gives everything,

32:55.667 --> 32:58.667
she bears so much of things,

32:59.166 --> 33:01.625
she bears all our sins.

33:01.875 --> 33:06.083
So a housewife is like the Mother Earth.

33:06.291 --> 33:08.750
She gives joy to everyone, to her husband,

33:08.999 --> 33:11.875
to her children. She doesn’t think about herself.

33:12.083 --> 33:16.291
She doesn’t think "how I could achieve great things

33:16.500 --> 33:19.083
through my beauty maybe, through my body,

33:19.333 --> 33:21.750
through my education,

33:21.959 --> 33:25.625
through my

33:25.875 --> 33:28.333
powers that I’ve got" – no, she doesn’t.

33:28.542 --> 33:33.333
What she thinks, "how I can make others powerful,

33:34.458 --> 33:38.417
how I can give them power, how I can help them."

33:38.625 --> 33:42.709
This is the typical

33:43.583 --> 33:46.250
ideology of a woman.

33:47.041 --> 33:51.208
If it is not so, then she’s not a woman.

33:51.750 --> 33:54.083
I mean, she feels – if somebody says,

33:54.291 --> 33:55.875
“I want to come to your house for dinner,”

33:56.083 --> 33:58.458
she feels very happy. “Oh, that’s very good.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.583
Now then, what should I cook? What should I do?”

34:00.792 --> 34:03.667
This is a woman’s attitude.

34:04.625 --> 34:07.959
Once we had a group of people, about twenty-five

34:08.125 --> 34:09.875
of them had come to see Me.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.999
I was sitting with them in an open space,

34:13.291 --> 34:15.875
and then I sent word to My daughter that they are here and

34:16.041 --> 34:18.959
it might be late, so better prepare dinner for them.

34:19.333 --> 34:21.999
After the thing I said, “There dinner is for you, let's go.”

34:22.208 --> 34:24.458
They said, “How?” I said, “All right.”

34:24.709 --> 34:26.458
She was so overjoyed, My daughter.

34:26.709 --> 34:28.583
She had prepared all kinds of things,

34:28.792 --> 34:30.583
her friends also came to help her.

34:30.792 --> 34:33.792
And they were surprised, all these foreigners, that

34:33.999 --> 34:35.917
“How, Mother, she’s so happy about it?

34:36.333 --> 34:40.041
If I tell my wife” – that’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga –

34:40.291 --> 34:43.000
“that even three persons are coming for dinner,

34:43.250 --> 34:46.417
she’d go round and round and round ...”

34:47.667 --> 34:49.709
I said, “Why?”

34:50.291 --> 34:52.583
“ … and she’d grudge and grumble,

34:52.792 --> 34:56.417
and she’d show all her temper with the people.”

34:57.583 --> 35:00.000
I was quite surprised.

35:02.458 --> 35:05.999
In Sahaja Yoga that’s how we live.

35:06.333 --> 35:08.375
We want to give love, and

35:08.583 --> 35:14.166
men have to appreciate that love and enjoy that love;

35:14.333 --> 35:16.959
whether you are a brother or a husband

35:17.125 --> 35:22.000
or a son, any way, the woman’s love is for you.

35:22.250 --> 35:26.999
And she gives you that love that makes you absolutely,

35:27.583 --> 35:31.750
not only joyous but also religious.

35:32.667 --> 35:35.125
Because it’s a relative thing.

35:35.417 --> 35:37.291
If a woman starts misbehaving,

35:37.542 --> 35:39.625
that’s the worst for the society:

35:39.834 --> 35:41.208
men also start misbehaving.

35:41.417 --> 35:43.500
Men, as it is, are extroverts.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.709
So to control them,

35:45.959 --> 35:48.917
put them as householders,

35:49.083 --> 35:52.999
women must know how to keep them.

35:53.959 --> 35:55.667
It’s not easy to run a house,

35:55.875 --> 35:59.917
it’s not easy to run your family,

36:00.083 --> 36:04.417
it’s not easy to look after your children – very difficult.

36:05.583 --> 36:09.208
And those who have those qualities are the best women

36:09.417 --> 36:12.583
and they really achieve it.

36:12.999 --> 36:16.750
I mean, you can think of your mothers,

36:17.291 --> 36:18.667
how much they loved you,

36:18.959 --> 36:20.208
all the men and the women.

36:20.458 --> 36:23.333
Why? Why do you think of your mother so much?

36:23.542 --> 36:26.542
Because she sacrificed everything,

36:26.792 --> 36:29.458
but without showing that she was sacrificing.

36:29.709 --> 36:33.417
She did so much for you, so you could...

36:34.999 --> 36:39.250
Woman’s potential to love is tremendous,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.250
tremendous!

36:42.500 --> 36:46.083
And this is what we have to learn from Fatima.

36:46.291 --> 36:49.709
She gave Her two children to be killed.

36:50.083 --> 36:54.834
She knew, because She was, after all, Vishnumaya.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.125
She was the incarnation of Vishnumaya.

36:57.417 --> 36:58.834
She knew Her children will be killed,

36:59.041 --> 37:01.333
but still She sent Her children,

37:01.709 --> 37:03.166
“All right. Doesn’t matter.

37:03.417 --> 37:09.333
Even if I know that they are going to die, it’s all right."

37:09.834 --> 37:12.750
Such bravery, such courage,

37:12.999 --> 37:18.208
such understanding of the duty of Her children.

37:18.458 --> 37:22.208
Today we remember them as Hassan and Hussein.

37:22.417 --> 37:25.542
Supposing She had said, “No, no, no, no, don’t go

37:25.750 --> 37:28.709
for the war. Stay at home.”

37:29.667 --> 37:32.667
And if She had forced them not to go,

37:33.250 --> 37:35.208
then they would not have gone.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.709
We would not have talked about them today, isn’t it?

37:38.000 --> 37:40.875
In any case, they would have been dead sometime,

37:41.041 --> 37:45.333
but the death of a hero they got because of their mother.

37:45.917 --> 37:48.625
Of course, they were also a kind of incarnations,

37:48.834 --> 37:53.000
but the way She gave them absolutely complete

37:53.250 --> 37:58.500
encouragement, “Go and fight for the right thing.”

37:58.792 --> 38:01.750
Because these fundamentalists

38:01.999 --> 38:05.792
were trying to bring their fanaticism.

38:06.999 --> 38:11.583
So today is a day I have to tell men also

38:11.834 --> 38:17.083
that you must learn to respect a woman who is chaste.

38:17.875 --> 38:21.542
Please understand, if your wife is a chaste woman,

38:21.792 --> 38:26.999
then you have no right, in no way to trouble her.

38:27.458 --> 38:30.417
Not that she should be respectable

38:30.709 --> 38:32.709
but you should see that everyone respects her,

38:32.999 --> 38:36.291
nobody insults her, should stand by her,

38:36.500 --> 38:38.750
be identified with her.

38:38.999 --> 38:41.709
But if she’s not a chaste woman

38:41.959 --> 38:45.458
and if she is that kind, better keep out.

38:45.917 --> 38:49.041
I do not have that much courage to say that

38:49.250 --> 38:51.999
“All right. Go ahead with her and I’ll look after.”

38:51.999 --> 38:53.375
It’s very difficult.

38:53.583 --> 38:56.709
I don’t know what complications might come.

38:57.291 --> 39:01.999
With all these experiences

39:02.333 --> 39:04.625
one learns one thing for definite,

39:04.875 --> 39:09.542
that woman is much more inward,

39:09.792 --> 39:12.667
she has much more powers,

39:12.875 --> 39:16.667
she is much more wiser than other people are,

39:16.875 --> 39:20.083
if she keeps to her chastity.

39:20.959 --> 39:25.583
That’s the point on which all her

39:25.834 --> 39:30.583
movement rotates, all her personality rotates.

39:30.792 --> 39:32.625
She may be anything.

39:32.834 --> 39:35.000
We had women – like there was a lady who was

39:35.208 --> 39:39.083
only seventeen years of age, and she became a widow.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.999
Widow she became at the age of seventeen,

39:42.250 --> 39:45.542
and she fought a very horrible king called as

39:45.750 --> 39:48.792
Aurangzeb, and she saw to it that he was battled;

39:48.999 --> 39:51.417
her name was Tarabai.

39:51.625 --> 39:54.999
We have women in India of different, different,

39:56.083 --> 39:58.750
say, characters in a way,

39:58.959 --> 40:01.834
fighting in different, different ways,

40:02.041 --> 40:05.917
but they were first and foremost were housewives.

40:06.792 --> 40:10.291
All their powers were there as housewives.

40:10.500 --> 40:13.709
So do not look down upon

40:15.000 --> 40:16.583
the housewife.

40:16.834 --> 40:18.792
When I’m traveling in the plane,

40:18.999 --> 40:20.875
they ask Me, “Mother, what is your profession?”

40:21.041 --> 40:23.208
“Housewife.”

40:23.417 --> 40:25.875
My profession is housewife.

40:26.041 --> 40:29.999
I’m a housewife of a very, very big family.

40:33.458 --> 40:35.792
I’m looking after My children,

40:36.000 --> 40:38.999
I’m loving them, they love Me,

40:39.750 --> 40:45.667
and this profession is the best, I think,

40:45.875 --> 40:49.792
because it is so joy-giving,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.625
it’s so beautiful.

40:53.834 --> 40:55.709
It’s love.

40:55.917 --> 40:59.333
It’s so energy-giving.

41:01.208 --> 41:04.333
And at this age also I never feel My age,

41:04.542 --> 41:08.999
because I am the Mother of so many of you.

41:09.709 --> 41:12.792
And it never comes to My head that I’m old now

41:12.999 --> 41:15.792
and I must do so-and-so, I must take rest

41:15.999 --> 41:19.542
and I must not do this work or that...

41:21.625 --> 41:25.375
Because this feeling of love

41:25.583 --> 41:28.583
for My children: I have to nourish them,

41:28.792 --> 41:30.625
I have to look after them,

41:30.834 --> 41:33.667
because all My powers I have to give them.

41:33.875 --> 41:37.999
I never try to show off My powers to you in any way.

41:38.291 --> 41:41.250
It’s only you, who should imbibe all My powers.

41:41.458 --> 41:43.291
That’s the only desire I have,

41:43.500 --> 41:46.667
that you should be as powerful as Myself.

41:47.583 --> 41:50.417
Of course you discover it that I have powers,

41:50.625 --> 41:53.458
but as far as I am concerned

41:53.709 --> 41:57.041
I want that you should forget as to

41:57.208 --> 42:00.375
what powers I have, but you should yourself

42:00.542 --> 42:02.792
have all these powers within yourself,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.417
so that you can save the world.

42:05.667 --> 42:08.999
That’s the only thing I want to give you.

42:09.291 --> 42:13.041
And I want to assure you that you all can have

42:13.250 --> 42:15.999
everything that I have; only thing if you can retain –

42:16.208 --> 42:20.291
simple thing in life – that we have to be righteous people.

42:21.250 --> 42:25.333
We cannot play about, we cannot misbehave.

42:25.542 --> 42:27.999
Nowadays so many things are coming up,

42:28.166 --> 42:30.625
things that men are doing and women are doing;

42:30.834 --> 42:32.750
we are not.

42:32.917 --> 42:35.083
In the evolutionary process,

42:35.333 --> 42:38.542
as we may say that there were some monkeys - chimpanzees

42:38.750 --> 42:41.834
that became human beings. But no,

42:42.041 --> 42:43.834
in between there were some other human beings

42:44.000 --> 42:47.333
that came in, which vanished.

42:47.834 --> 42:51.250
So, very few people will become Sahaja Yogis,

42:51.500 --> 42:54.625
who will be saved. All the rest will be not there -

42:54.875 --> 42:58.041
they’ll be neither monkeys nor human beings, finished.

42:59.208 --> 43:02.750
These are all self-destroying things

43:02.959 --> 43:04.125
which kills the family,

43:04.375 --> 43:07.709
which kills the chastity within us,

43:07.917 --> 43:10.999
and then we are left high and dry.

43:11.709 --> 43:14.959
We are nowhere. We have diseases, we have troubles,

43:15.125 --> 43:18.999
we have problems. So be careful,

43:19.709 --> 43:21.208
very, very careful.

43:21.458 --> 43:26.083
And this special puja for

43:26.542 --> 43:28.041
Fatima Bi is

43:28.250 --> 43:29.834
puja of Vishnumaya.

43:30.041 --> 43:33.792
Also the guilt that works on the Left Vishuddhi

43:33.999 --> 43:38.417
can be cured if you develop your chastity.

43:38.667 --> 43:39.792
You’ll never feel guilty,

43:39.999 --> 43:42.250
because that’s such a virtue you have.

43:42.500 --> 43:45.709
In that virtue you will never, never feel guilty,

43:45.917 --> 43:48.875
and you can stand up to any nonsense

43:49.083 --> 43:53.291
because you are standing on the truth of chastity.

43:53.500 --> 43:58.250
Today it’s special day, I would say, when we are

43:58.500 --> 44:03.375
worshipping this great ideal of chastity that is Fatima Bi.

44:03.625 --> 44:06.999
May God bless you.

44:16.417 --> 44:19.083
Right, so now we have very few children …

44:19.291 --> 44:21.291
How many children we have?

44:28.417 --> 44:30.999
Come along, come along, come along.

45:03.250 --> 45:05.458
Let’s sing the Ganesha Stuthi.

45:27.250 --> 45:30.458
All right, you can sing the Ganesha Stuthi.

45:30.667 --> 45:32.375
Let’s say the Ganesha’s mantra,

45:32.625 --> 45:35.083
and then we’ll sing the Ganesha Stuthi,

45:35.333 --> 45:41.208
and after that we’ll have the hundred-and-eight names.

01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:26.291
This stone, feroza, comes from Iraq,

01:46:26.667 --> 01:46:31.583
and Fatima used to wear quartz, no doubt about it.

01:46:33.166 --> 01:46:35.999
This one is called as a quartz;

01:46:36.166 --> 01:46:38.041
it’s called as feroza.

01:46:38.250 --> 01:46:41.999
And full of it, it’s there in Iraq, so many.

01:46:42.625 --> 01:46:47.000
She used to wear this feroza, it’s absolutely correct.

01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:22.083
Also this, for your information, ...

01:47:22.417 --> 01:47:25.125
these vases also come from Iraq,

01:47:25.458 --> 01:47:27.999
also from the same place where She was.

01:47:28.750 --> 01:47:31.709
So just see the coincidence,

01:47:31.917 --> 01:47:35.083
exactly, at this time, to come from Iraq.

01:47:35.458 --> 01:47:40.000
May God bless that country and may there be peace.

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:23.083
There’s another suggestion that everybody cannot

01:55:23.375 --> 01:55:28.959
go to India, so people can’t get married, you see.

01:55:29.125 --> 01:55:32.834
So we’re thinking of also organizing marriages,

01:55:34.166 --> 01:55:37.125
when – during Diwali Puja.

01:55:37.333 --> 01:55:40.999
But you won’t have such a wide choice, that’s the point is.

01:55:41.166 --> 01:55:44.999
Doesn’t matter. Those who want to get married

01:55:45.208 --> 01:55:49.208
should send Me forms filled in,

01:55:49.417 --> 01:55:51.959
and send it to Guido.

01:55:52.125 --> 01:55:58.999
And another thing is that we can’t have

01:55:59.208 --> 01:56:03.750
the same elaborate way as we have it in India. We try,

01:56:03.999 --> 01:56:06.375
but still you know it’s very difficult.

01:56:06.583 --> 01:56:08.625
It’s a different country.

01:56:08.875 --> 01:56:11.792
We’re trying to find out things

01:56:11.999 --> 01:56:14.917
that can be worked out.

01:56:15.083 --> 01:56:17.417
In any case

01:56:18.999 --> 01:56:22.250
we’ll organize the marriages, because you don’t want

01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:27.041
another type, a simple type, you want to have Indian style.

01:56:29.917 --> 01:56:32.917
So I’ll go to India before Diwali,

01:56:33.083 --> 01:56:35.458
try to organize things for you.

01:56:35.667 --> 01:56:38.792
May God bless you.

01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:04.125
Thank you very much for everything.

01:58:07.583 --> 01:58:10.083
I’m sorry I couldn’t get presents

01:58:10.333 --> 01:58:12.709
for all of you - all of you this time.
