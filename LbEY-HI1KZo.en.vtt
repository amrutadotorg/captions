00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.173
So now we have talked
about Bhairava and

00:00:06.776 --> 00:00:09.650
we have seen how
negativity acts within us,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.730
and how we get caught up.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.610
So,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.560
I would say that, we must
always keep in mind,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.990
that we have a soul

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.480
and that soul can be attacked.

00:00:25.034 --> 00:00:27.874
It has been already
attacked when with all

00:00:27.874 --> 00:00:30.064
the kinds of things we have
had in these modern lives,

00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:32.704
it's already under attack.

00:00:32.984 --> 00:00:35.864
But now we have to
cleanse it, and put it right.

00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:39.744
If you really want to enjoy Sahaja
Yoga and cleanse yourself

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:43.744
then you have to understand
that we need lot of introspection

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:45.934
- lot of introspection.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:49.934
Now the people who are
left-sided are sort of,

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:52.452
they are not straightforward

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:56.660
and they are sly and
they talk ill about others.

00:00:56.694 --> 00:00:58.774
Last time I discovered that in Perth

00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:01.844
there was a lot of things
people were talking and,

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:06.684
I wanted to remind you again
that I heard about it,

00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:09.044
also that even now in Australia

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:11.844
that kind of people are still there,

00:01:11.844 --> 00:01:14.834
who just start at the
back saying things.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:17.794
One person says something,
another listens to it

00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:19.754
and it's very very bad thing,

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:22.754
because talking ill about others
means you first of all

00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:24.754
you get the ill within you.

00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:26.834
The second thing is that
the way you propagate

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.904
you stop Divinity spreading out.

00:01:29.904 --> 00:01:32.864
Thirdly you grow into
negativity yourself

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:37.664
and to whomsoever you talk
that person also gets infected,

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:38.864
it's like a disease.

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:42.864
So I think in Australia throughout
we have to be very careful

00:01:43.744 --> 00:01:46.814
because we have had two
big somersaults you can say,

00:01:46.814 --> 00:01:50.694
with big falling
because of this only,

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.734
that secretly, and this is a side,

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.734
I would say Australia
is very left-sided

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.724
otherwise also
because Ganesha's place.

00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:01.764
That's why Ganesha
was placed here,

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:04.004
to save you and to put you right

00:02:04.684 --> 00:02:07.884
as far as the left side is concerned.

00:02:07.884 --> 00:02:09.884
And we have to be very cautious

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:11.844
because that temperament develops,

00:02:11.844 --> 00:02:13.764
you know, depend on.

00:02:13.764 --> 00:02:15.954
Like also it is in England quite a lot,

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:19.794
but say not in America,
say not in Austria,

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:21.914
not in Russia, Germany,

00:02:22.634 --> 00:02:25.794
they are on the contrary open
and they can be aggressive,

00:02:25.794 --> 00:02:27.994
but they are not sly.

00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:30.824
So either you are aggressive
or you are sly.

00:02:30.824 --> 00:02:33.664
Accordingly you must
find out within yourself

00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:36.704
what's wrong with you
and where are we wrong.

00:02:36.704 --> 00:02:38.664
Because after all we
are Sahaja Yogis,

00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:39.984
it's a great chance we have got

00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:41.824
that we have got our Realization,

00:02:41.824 --> 00:02:44.814
and that now we have reached
a stage where we really

00:02:45.774 --> 00:02:48.814
are placed in the Kingdom of God.

00:02:49.614 --> 00:02:53.974
But now how far you go
into it depends only on you.

00:02:54.654 --> 00:02:56.614
Now Russia why we
were successful

00:02:56.614 --> 00:02:58.614
because people are
very introspective.

00:02:58.614 --> 00:03:00.804
If you read any book
of Russian writers

00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:02.804
like Tolstoy or anyone,

00:03:02.804 --> 00:03:05.884
anything they do, say even when
they fall in love or anything,

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:08.884
immediately they
start introspecting:

00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:10.924
'Why, why am I falling in love?

00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:12.884
Why this happening to me?

00:03:12.884 --> 00:03:15.874
Why I'm thinking like that?
Why I'm doing like that?'

00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:17.714
You see they introspect,

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:20.834
and that introspection if we
do not have within ourselves

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:23.754
then, what happens that we can go

00:03:23.754 --> 00:03:25.794
either to the right or to the left.

00:03:25.794 --> 00:03:29.864
But in this country I see
it's more the left side,

00:03:30.664 --> 00:03:31.864
sly things are there.

00:03:32.584 --> 00:03:34.664
Now how all this
has happened that

00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:38.904
we had some horrible leaders,

00:03:39.584 --> 00:03:42.824
agreed and instead
of talking about it

00:03:43.664 --> 00:03:44.854
or telling Me about it,

00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:48.574
they all just started talking
among themselves and all that

00:03:48.574 --> 00:03:50.774
and they got all their bad qualities

00:03:50.774 --> 00:03:52.814
sort of combined within themselves

00:03:52.814 --> 00:03:55.854
and that's how so many
lost their vibrations

00:03:55.854 --> 00:03:59.712
and lost their, what should I say,

00:04:01.724 --> 00:04:03.684
the searching power.

00:04:04.102 --> 00:04:06.644
So when you see a person,

00:04:06.924 --> 00:04:08.884
or anyone who is doing wrong,

00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:11.764
better is to forget about it.

00:04:11.764 --> 00:04:15.594
Or if you don't forget then
you should write to Me,

00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:17.594
even if you don't do that

00:04:17.594 --> 00:04:20.594
better go and talk to
that person on his face

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.594
that: 'I think this is not right.'

00:04:22.874 --> 00:04:25.914
But if you write to
Me it can be solved,

00:04:26.594 --> 00:04:27.714
problem can be solved.

00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:30.584
Say now you have one
Mr X as your leader

00:04:30.584 --> 00:04:32.704
or anybody here who is

00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:34.544
coming say,

00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:36.664
from New Zealand,

00:04:36.664 --> 00:04:38.624
or someone from outside.

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:40.864
Immediately you should find out,

00:04:41.235 --> 00:04:43.544
are you critical of him?

00:04:44.734 --> 00:04:46.854
What are you looking at that person?

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:49.654
What are you trying to find
out about that person?

00:04:50.734 --> 00:04:54.654
If you are critical then know
that you can never progress.

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:57.694
You should be critical
about yourself,

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:00.604
not about others,

00:05:00.604 --> 00:05:02.684
know that you
are most imperfect,

00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:03.844
that's the best way.

00:05:04.564 --> 00:05:06.804
Like we had a child
about nine year old,

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:10.884
and he was extremely sly type

00:05:12.724 --> 00:05:13.764
and,

00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:17.674
he was talking ill like this of
this person to that person and

00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:20.794
he would go and just
jump on to someone,

00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:24.634
and hit someone, secretly.

00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:25.754
Not openly.

00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:27.834
So I called the child
and I asked him:

00:05:28.514 --> 00:05:29.634
'What do you think of yourself?

00:05:29.634 --> 00:05:31.744
Do you think you are the
most perfect person?'

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:33.824
He said: 'Yes, I do'

00:05:34.544 --> 00:05:35.624
I said: 'That's it.

00:05:36.504 --> 00:05:37.664
It's finished.'

00:05:37.664 --> 00:05:39.704
Such a person cannot improve.

00:05:40.624 --> 00:05:43.504
So when you try to find
faults with others

00:05:43.504 --> 00:05:45.854
know that we have too
many faults ourselves.

00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:48.654
Not to feel guilty - of course,
that point is there also.

00:05:48.654 --> 00:05:50.654
you should never feel
guilty about it.

00:05:50.654 --> 00:05:52.734
If you have faults just see:

00:05:52.734 --> 00:05:54.534
"What faults do I have?

00:05:54.534 --> 00:05:55.694
How will I correct?

00:05:55.694 --> 00:05:57.534
What chakras I am catching?"

00:05:57.534 --> 00:05:59.804
Instead of seeing the
chakras of others,

00:06:00.484 --> 00:06:03.724
if you see your own, then
you'll become purified,

00:06:03.724 --> 00:06:06.604
you'll be very clean, you'll be wonderful,

00:06:06.604 --> 00:06:08.524
everything will be fine.

00:06:08.804 --> 00:06:13.564
But if you cannot see
your own faults,

00:06:14.764 --> 00:06:17.834
that means you haven't
yet got your Self-Realization.

00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:20.634
Self-Realization means to
know about your Self,

00:06:20.634 --> 00:06:24.834
and this - the last time I did
say all these things here in Perth

00:06:25.514 --> 00:06:26.714
and also otherwise, that if you

00:06:26.714 --> 00:06:30.784
talk about somebody like
that to spread stories.

00:06:31.664 --> 00:06:32.864
Ladies specially should be careful

00:06:33.544 --> 00:06:34.544
because they are on the left,

00:06:34.544 --> 00:06:36.464
they have to be very, very careful,

00:06:36.464 --> 00:06:38.464
that they start judging others.

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.464
They think they are
perfect, they judge,

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:41.464
they tell their husbands,

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:42.704
then husband tells another husband,

00:06:42.704 --> 00:06:44.624
then husband tells his
wife - it spreads.

00:06:44.624 --> 00:06:48.774
You have to be extremely
wise and sensible women.

00:06:49.454 --> 00:06:54.494
If you are not sensible
this will spread like a disease.

00:06:54.494 --> 00:06:58.454
In Sahaja Yoga this is one
of the diseases I dread,

00:06:58.454 --> 00:07:01.604
is what Christ has
called: "Murmuring souls."

00:07:01.604 --> 00:07:04.644
He said: "Beware of
the murmuring souls!"

00:07:05.604 --> 00:07:07.644
Leaders are also afraid
to tell you something.

00:07:07.644 --> 00:07:10.644
If they tell you something
immediately you'll start saying

00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:12.724
"Oh, Mother said so
- he's saying so."

00:07:13.444 --> 00:07:15.634
Whatever the leader is
saying you must listen to him,

00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:17.674
must obey him, ask him

00:07:17.674 --> 00:07:21.474
what, does he mean by
saying this, what is it?

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.714
Now in case you find something
wrong with the leader

00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:25.594
you are all free to write to Me,

00:07:25.594 --> 00:07:27.474
and I will definitely go into it,

00:07:27.474 --> 00:07:29.514
for example, Stephen wrote
to Me about someone

00:07:29.514 --> 00:07:31.424
and I went into this,

00:07:31.424 --> 00:07:33.544
enquired and found out
what was the thing.

00:07:33.544 --> 00:07:35.504
You see so there's no harm,

00:07:35.504 --> 00:07:37.664
in finding out about someone.

00:07:37.664 --> 00:07:40.704
Some lady wrote to Me
also and I found it.

00:07:41.624 --> 00:07:45.574
So but unnecessarily paying
attention to another person

00:07:45.574 --> 00:07:47.414
is not a good thing.

00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:48.654
Paying attention to yourself

00:07:48.654 --> 00:07:51.654
and looking all the good
points of another person,

00:07:51.654 --> 00:07:53.534
of helping another person,

00:07:53.534 --> 00:07:55.574
that's how we would be collective,

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:57.494
we'll be growing faster

00:07:57.494 --> 00:07:59.414
and we'll be enjoying ourselves.

00:07:59.414 --> 00:08:01.404
Now our children are here.

00:08:01.724 --> 00:08:06.724
Now, what I find that
we do not know really

00:08:07.684 --> 00:08:11.604
what are the balanced ways
of looking after our children.

00:08:11.604 --> 00:08:14.684
So some think that when
I said they are realized souls,

00:08:14.684 --> 00:08:17.434
so they said, "All right, let
them do what they like."

00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:20.514
It's not true,
otherwise if that is so

00:08:20.514 --> 00:08:23.514
they would have been born
out of the trees, you see.

00:08:23.514 --> 00:08:25.434
Why are they born out of you?

00:08:25.434 --> 00:08:27.674
So you have a responsibility

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.754
whether they are realized or not.

00:08:30.424 --> 00:08:32.744
You have a responsibility
about your children

00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:35.584
and you have to see
that you correct them.

00:08:36.384 --> 00:08:37.464
It's very important.

00:08:37.464 --> 00:08:40.384
Some people I've seen
allow their children

00:08:40.384 --> 00:08:44.624
to go just so mad and
so, they go so amok.

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:49.574
In this I would say an Indian
parent is an ideal parent.

00:08:50.454 --> 00:08:52.494
What he will do, he
looks after the child.

00:08:53.454 --> 00:08:56.534
Also, in a way he loves,

00:08:56.534 --> 00:08:58.454
expresses his love and all that,

00:08:58.454 --> 00:09:00.724
but if he finds anything
wrong with the child

00:09:01.404 --> 00:09:04.524
immediately he'll
correct - immediately,

00:09:04.524 --> 00:09:07.444
not spare him, in the
presence of others.

00:09:07.444 --> 00:09:10.724
Now, if another person comes
and tells about the child,

00:09:11.444 --> 00:09:12.444
that this child has done,

00:09:12.444 --> 00:09:15.474
immediately he will scold the child.

00:09:15.474 --> 00:09:17.474
He will never get angry with
the another person:

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:19.434
"Why did you say
about my child now?"

00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:21.594
But thank him and that
"Thank God you have told me";

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:25.594
because he might be spoiled more.

00:09:26.674 --> 00:09:28.714
Like I'll tell you we had one Avadhut

00:09:29.394 --> 00:09:30.704
- now he's a grown up boy,
but when he was young,

00:09:31.384 --> 00:09:32.664
one day he asked Me that,

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:36.464
"If you leave your parents their,

00:09:36.464 --> 00:09:39.504
the baddhas of your parents
they leave you or not?"

00:09:39.504 --> 00:09:42.464
I said: 'No, they may not leave,
the baddhas of your parents.

00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:44.544
Then what's the use
of leaving the parents?'

00:09:44.544 --> 00:09:46.374
"But," I said:
'Who is leaving parents?"

00:09:46.374 --> 00:09:49.374
"No," he said: "I've heard that
in the Western countries,

00:09:49.374 --> 00:09:51.574
people, children
leave their parents

00:09:51.574 --> 00:09:53.454
when they are
eighteen years of age.

00:09:53.454 --> 00:09:55.534
But I would not
like to leave the parents."

00:09:55.534 --> 00:09:58.414
I said: "Why?
You can be free."

00:09:58.414 --> 00:10:00.604
He said: "Then, I'll be
free to do wrong.

00:10:01.444 --> 00:10:02.524
Who will correct me?

00:10:02.524 --> 00:10:04.484
If I take the cigarette
in my hand,

00:10:04.484 --> 00:10:05.644
who will correct me?

00:10:06.364 --> 00:10:07.444
Who will tell me:
"Don't do it."

00:10:07.444 --> 00:10:09.684
I mean if a child takes
a cigarette in the hand,

00:10:10.364 --> 00:10:11.644
immediately the father
will take the cigarette

00:10:12.324 --> 00:10:14.324
and burn it, also.

00:10:14.604 --> 00:10:17.594
And: "Next time I see you
I'll burn your tongue."

00:10:18.554 --> 00:10:20.314
Finished.

00:10:20.634 --> 00:10:24.354
But, the child knows that,
"The father loves me

00:10:24.594 --> 00:10:27.354
and loves me in such a way

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:29.394
that I should not lose my father",

00:10:29.394 --> 00:10:31.344
but he must know that he can lose,

00:10:31.344 --> 00:10:33.344
the kindness of the father.

00:10:33.344 --> 00:10:36.344
If you allow the child
just all the time

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:39.464
to behave the way
he likes, or it likes,

00:10:39.464 --> 00:10:41.624
then it will sit on your head.

00:10:42.344 --> 00:10:44.464
And today only I was
discussing with him

00:10:44.464 --> 00:10:47.494
and I told him that I was
traveling one day with one lady

00:10:48.294 --> 00:10:50.334
in the train, one of
the Sahaja Yoginis,

00:10:50.334 --> 00:10:52.494
and her child was
there, not very old,

00:10:52.494 --> 00:10:54.614
must have been about
seven years of age.

00:10:55.574 --> 00:10:58.414
She was trying to talk
to Me and this fellow

00:10:58.414 --> 00:11:00.644
was all the time:
"Mummy, mummy,"

00:11:01.364 --> 00:11:04.364
and then: "Why? Why?"
was going on,

00:11:04.364 --> 00:11:05.564
you see, all the time.

00:11:06.564 --> 00:11:09.564
I told her: "Why must you
answer all his questions?"

00:11:10.444 --> 00:11:12.444
I said: "He is just
making enquiries."

00:11:12.444 --> 00:11:15.554
I said, "Nothing sensible
enquiries, just it's nonsense.

00:11:15.554 --> 00:11:17.514
He wants to attract
your attention."

00:11:17.514 --> 00:11:20.354
So why do you want to pay
so much attention to him?

00:11:20.634 --> 00:11:22.474
So she said: "Mother, how to stop it?"

00:11:22.474 --> 00:11:24.394
I said: "I'll stop it in one minute."

00:11:24.394 --> 00:11:26.594
I said, I asked him:

00:11:27.314 --> 00:11:28.594
"You should not ask
so many questions."

00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:30.544
So he said: "Why?"

00:11:31.384 --> 00:11:33.384
"Because", I said,
"you are stupid.

00:11:34.344 --> 00:11:35.624
You have to learn a lot, still

00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:37.584
and if you go on asking
question like this

00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:39.384
you'll be very, very stupid

00:11:39.384 --> 00:11:42.304
and one day you'll have
to go like a madman.

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:43.584
Do you want to become a madman?"

00:11:46.294 --> 00:11:47.454
He got a fright of his life.

00:11:47.454 --> 00:11:48.494
"You'll become mad."

00:11:48.494 --> 00:11:51.334
And you see if you any
of your children are there

00:11:51.334 --> 00:11:53.374
you have to tell them
some stories. I'll tell you how.

00:11:53.374 --> 00:11:56.374
Some children have
a habit of beating others

00:11:56.374 --> 00:11:58.294
or doing something, then you said,

00:11:58.294 --> 00:12:03.324
"Now if you beat then a tail
comes out of your bottom,

00:12:03.324 --> 00:12:06.564
like that you see like a doggy
and something like that."

00:12:07.284 --> 00:12:09.244
And they believe it.
They believe it.

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:13.564
Next day they'll ask:
"Is there a tail coming out?"

00:12:16.314 --> 00:12:17.434
"Ya maybe, maybe."

00:12:17.434 --> 00:12:20.314
So now you are going to
behave: "Ya I'll be very..."

00:12:20.314 --> 00:12:23.274
You see all these tricks have
to be played to your children

00:12:23.274 --> 00:12:24.434
but they're very clever

00:12:24.434 --> 00:12:26.474
and they knowhow
to make you dance,

00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:29.474
you see how to make you

00:12:31.344 --> 00:12:35.424
- their sort of slaves,
sometimes, you may call

00:12:35.424 --> 00:12:38.224
for everything they
will demand: "Do this, do this."

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:40.224
Now because they're Realized souls

00:12:40.224 --> 00:12:43.264
I was surprised that when
I went to London you see

00:12:43.264 --> 00:12:46.414
I read in the newspaper
the statistics about children

00:12:46.414 --> 00:12:49.534
that every week in London City only,

00:12:50.214 --> 00:12:51.574
two children are killed by parents.

00:12:52.254 --> 00:12:53.494
I mean that was too much for Me.

00:12:53.494 --> 00:12:56.374
So I just blasted all
of them and I said:

00:12:56.374 --> 00:12:58.334
"Nothing doing, you must
love your children."

00:12:58.334 --> 00:13:01.364
As a result all the children
sat on their heads, you see

00:13:01.364 --> 00:13:03.484
and they couldn't come
to the programs.

00:13:04.204 --> 00:13:05.444
If they came to the
programs they were,

00:13:05.444 --> 00:13:08.204
the children were to be
kept outside like doggies,

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.524
tied together something and
in England I don't know,

00:13:11.204 --> 00:13:13.524
maybe here also, they do
have a leash, just like a dog.

00:13:14.364 --> 00:13:16.394
You see they hold the
children just like... I said,

00:13:16.394 --> 00:13:18.314
"How cruel it is",

00:13:18.314 --> 00:13:21.234
but now I know how children
can be in the West.

00:13:21.234 --> 00:13:23.354
I don't know if it's white skin
or whatever you may say

00:13:23.354 --> 00:13:27.434
that first we started
a school you see, for them,

00:13:27.434 --> 00:13:30.274
because there was
no school available,

00:13:30.274 --> 00:13:31.424
they were in a mess.

00:13:32.464 --> 00:13:35.264
So we said, "All right in Dharamshala
we'll start a school."

00:13:36.184 --> 00:13:37.464
So we started
a school in Dharamshala

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:39.424
and these children were brought

00:13:39.424 --> 00:13:41.544
because they had no way
to go anywhere

00:13:42.224 --> 00:13:43.544
so in a hurry it was
started, you see.

00:13:44.264 --> 00:13:46.334
So there must be something
also if you

00:13:46.334 --> 00:13:48.334
just start a school in a great hurry

00:13:48.334 --> 00:13:50.254
maybe some things are left out.

00:13:50.254 --> 00:13:52.214
But these children were terrible

00:13:52.214 --> 00:13:54.334
because they saw these
teachers were Indians

00:13:54.334 --> 00:13:56.414
so they came and
started punching them,

00:13:56.414 --> 00:13:59.174
they started showing
tongue to them,

00:13:59.174 --> 00:14:00.454
sometimes spitting
at them, sometimes

00:14:03.164 --> 00:14:05.364
- pinching and doing all
kinds of things, you know.

00:14:06.484 --> 00:14:08.284
So the teachers got a fright.

00:14:08.284 --> 00:14:11.164
They said: "Baba, we can't
look after these bounders,

00:14:11.164 --> 00:14:12.524
God knows what they are up to.

00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:15.444
One day they'll bring a knife
and push it through us.

00:14:16.154 --> 00:14:17.394
We don't know what to do."

00:14:17.394 --> 00:14:20.194
And we have very bad
experience in Shudy Camp

00:14:20.194 --> 00:14:21.434
about these children

00:14:21.434 --> 00:14:24.274
that they had no sense
of proportion, nothing.

00:14:24.274 --> 00:14:26.434
They were not cautious at all and

00:14:27.474 --> 00:14:29.314
then I said: 'What will you do?

00:14:30.234 --> 00:14:31.344
"They have already started jumping,"

00:14:31.344 --> 00:14:33.224
they said, "from different places."

00:14:33.224 --> 00:14:35.304
I hope they are not
jumping there.

00:14:38.144 --> 00:14:41.344
So... and one boy broke his leg.

00:14:41.344 --> 00:14:43.224
They got a fright.

00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:47.494
So I said: 'All right now
you do one thing.

00:14:48.214 --> 00:14:49.334
They are already spoilt

00:14:49.334 --> 00:14:52.374
but take one foot-rule, ruler,

00:14:52.374 --> 00:14:54.294
and keep it and say that

00:14:54.294 --> 00:14:56.334
"If you misbehave this is the thing."

00:14:56.334 --> 00:14:58.414
And once or twice just do
a little bit like that."

00:14:59.294 --> 00:15:01.324
Now that doesn't mean you
go on beating your children.

00:15:01.324 --> 00:15:06.124
I mean everything should
not be taken to an extreme,

00:15:06.124 --> 00:15:07.484
but there should be a balance.

00:15:08.204 --> 00:15:09.244
Must understand.

00:15:10.164 --> 00:15:12.364
So there was one boy
who had come as a cook

00:15:12.364 --> 00:15:15.364
from Austria and Yogi had asked him,

00:15:15.364 --> 00:15:17.234
he thought that he is a Westerner -

00:15:17.234 --> 00:15:18.474
"You'd better look after the children."

00:15:19.194 --> 00:15:21.154
He started thrashing
them, left and right.

00:15:21.474 --> 00:15:23.314
Not the Indian women.

00:15:23.314 --> 00:15:25.194
Indian women don't
thrash so much,

00:15:25.194 --> 00:15:27.154
you see we don't
beat. I mean I have

00:15:27.434 --> 00:15:30.194
slapped My daughter
once, one daughter,

00:15:30.194 --> 00:15:33.224
elder one and younger
one twice in their lifetime.

00:15:34.104 --> 00:15:35.184
We don't believe in thrashing,

00:15:35.184 --> 00:15:37.304
but you see they're
afraid of our eyes,

00:15:37.304 --> 00:15:42.910
even they know what
we want, what is good.

00:15:43.264 --> 00:15:46.134
I'll tell you My younger
daughter she,

00:15:46.134 --> 00:15:48.374
when she went to college
in Delhi she found

00:15:48.374 --> 00:15:51.134
all the girls were wearing
sleeveless blouses.

00:15:51.134 --> 00:15:52.334
So she came and asked Me,

00:15:52.334 --> 00:15:55.214
Should I wear sleeveless blouses?

00:15:55.214 --> 00:15:58.094
because all the girls are
wearing sleeveless blouses?"

00:15:58.374 --> 00:16:00.334
I said, "Go ahead if you think so."

00:16:00.334 --> 00:16:03.404
She said, "Mummy why don't
you wear sleeveless blouse?"

00:16:04.084 --> 00:16:05.364
I said, "I feel shy when
I've worn it;

00:16:06.084 --> 00:16:10.364
I don't like to expose
My hands like that,

00:16:11.084 --> 00:16:12.284
I don't like it, it's not good.

00:16:12.284 --> 00:16:15.284
The arms, you see, should
be covered, I think."

00:16:16.274 --> 00:16:18.154
Immediately she said,

00:16:18.154 --> 00:16:20.394
"Then it is no criteria if I say

00:16:21.074 --> 00:16:23.434
I want this and all that you
should say yes to everything.

00:16:24.154 --> 00:16:25.194
You should have said, 'No,

00:16:25.194 --> 00:16:27.154
no', to me. I would have
been very happy."

00:16:28.194 --> 00:16:30.354
So this wisdom is there in,
among Indian children.

00:16:30.354 --> 00:16:32.344
They like - like Avadut,
as I told you,

00:16:32.344 --> 00:16:34.344
he said that, "Then
who will correct me,

00:16:35.064 --> 00:16:36.264
who will stop me
from doing wrong?"

00:16:36.264 --> 00:16:38.344
But that's not with
our children here,

00:16:39.064 --> 00:16:41.104
so you see because,
I don't know why,

00:16:41.104 --> 00:16:44.064
but maybe that our roots
are too deep or whatever it is

00:16:44.064 --> 00:16:46.094
we have to keep controlled
all the time

00:16:46.094 --> 00:16:47.374
and wisdom is very important.

00:16:48.094 --> 00:16:50.174
If you tell a child, "You have
been very unmannerly," -

00:16:50.174 --> 00:16:54.294
I mean, it's like saying the
horridest thing to a child,

00:16:54.294 --> 00:16:55.414
"you're unmannerly."

00:16:56.134 --> 00:16:57.414
Or to say, "You are very unwise";

00:16:58.094 --> 00:17:00.134
then the child feels very hurt.

00:17:00.134 --> 00:17:02.284
"I'm unwise, I've not been seeing."

00:17:02.284 --> 00:17:04.244
But the best thing would be to say,

00:17:04.244 --> 00:17:06.244
"You are Sahaja Yogis,
you are special people,

00:17:06.244 --> 00:17:08.404
you can't do like that,
you are Sahaja Yogis."

00:17:09.124 --> 00:17:11.084
All the time go on telling them

00:17:11.084 --> 00:17:13.124
how dignified they should be,

00:17:13.124 --> 00:17:16.074
what is expected of
a Sahaja Yogi, it is better.

00:17:16.074 --> 00:17:18.234
But never spoil them.

00:17:18.234 --> 00:17:21.194
This is one thing you should
not do otherwise it will be

00:17:21.194 --> 00:17:23.114
a permanent headache for you,

00:17:23.114 --> 00:17:25.354
even if they are Realized souls
whatever they may be.

00:17:26.034 --> 00:17:28.314
But please see that
you do not spoil them.

00:17:29.034 --> 00:17:30.114
That's very important.

00:17:30.114 --> 00:17:32.144
Also as I told you that,

00:17:32.144 --> 00:17:35.184
"Don't talk ill of each
other, on the back."

00:17:35.184 --> 00:17:37.104
Is a very bad habit,

00:17:37.104 --> 00:17:39.184
that's how you'll catch on bhoots

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.304
and you'll become extremely negative.

00:17:41.304 --> 00:17:45.224
Any such thought comes into
your mind, just stop it.

00:17:48.054 --> 00:17:52.174
It's a very, nasty disease
you see that spreads,

00:17:53.014 --> 00:17:55.334
so it makes you - I mean, it's
so sickening you know,

00:17:56.014 --> 00:17:57.134
when I mean I hear
about somebody

00:17:57.134 --> 00:18:00.254
who talks ill of someone
it's extremely sickening

00:18:00.254 --> 00:18:04.324
because it's not being human.

00:18:05.164 --> 00:18:07.324
You see in the animal, there's
one animal called hyena.

00:18:08.204 --> 00:18:10.124
And they say this
hyena is like that.

00:18:10.124 --> 00:18:15.044
It comes slowly and steals
a child, or anything,

00:18:15.044 --> 00:18:18.354
it's a very, sly type of an animal

00:18:19.034 --> 00:18:22.154
and such a person we call
as hyena in India,

00:18:22.154 --> 00:18:24.194
such a person is called as a hyena

00:18:24.194 --> 00:18:29.114
and it's regarded as a very
low type of a personality,

00:18:29.994 --> 00:18:31.184
if they talk like this.

00:18:31.184 --> 00:18:33.184
In Sahaja Yoga it doesn't behove.

00:18:33.184 --> 00:18:36.344
No Sahaja Yogis should
talk ill about each other.

00:18:38.344 --> 00:18:41.144
Nor should they discuss each other.

00:18:41.984 --> 00:18:43.064
Never!

00:18:43.064 --> 00:18:46.294
Now somebody does that
you must immediately say:

00:18:46.974 --> 00:18:49.214
"Now, please I don't want to know.

00:18:49.214 --> 00:18:52.014
Please don't tell me."

00:18:52.254 --> 00:18:54.254
This is not a very good thing.

00:18:54.254 --> 00:18:58.334
Politicians do like that,
but not Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:59.254 --> 00:19:01.084
Sahaja Yogis should not do,

00:19:01.084 --> 00:19:04.124
because, you see you are
great people, you are yogis.

00:19:04.124 --> 00:19:06.284
Do you know how a yogi becomes

00:19:06.964 --> 00:19:10.284
a Realized soul, in the normal way?

00:19:11.164 --> 00:19:13.084
The other day I was reading a book

00:19:13.964 --> 00:19:17.114
about Upanishadas and
one of them was - today

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:20.114
only I saw it in the morning
time when I got up.

00:19:20.114 --> 00:19:22.954
There was written about a yogi

00:19:25.074 --> 00:19:26.114
that,

00:19:27.314 --> 00:19:31.064
"You have to really starve
yourself, first of all.

00:19:31.944 --> 00:19:33.984
Then you have to do shirshasana,

00:19:34.264 --> 00:19:36.184
with that you have to do pranayama,

00:19:36.184 --> 00:19:41.024
then you have to get up four
o'clock in the morning

00:19:41.944 --> 00:19:43.064
and take your bath,

00:19:43.064 --> 00:19:45.184
and then sit down for dhyana,

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.174
and for five hours you must
sit for your dhyana.

00:19:49.294 --> 00:19:51.974
After that you have
to do pranayama.

00:19:51.974 --> 00:19:53.174
That's also special style.

00:19:53.174 --> 00:19:55.254
It's not easy for normal
person to do that

00:19:55.934 --> 00:19:59.934
is till you say sixty you
raise your left side,

00:20:01.204 --> 00:20:03.924
take the prana through your,

00:20:03.924 --> 00:20:06.924
I mean you breathe through
your nostril left one,

00:20:07.244 --> 00:20:10.084
now sixty-four you
say keep it here,

00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:16.074
and then rechaka: you do the
taking it out thirty-two  times,

00:20:16.074 --> 00:20:17.274
can you imagine?

00:20:17.994 --> 00:20:21.074
This you have to do 108 times,
every day,

00:20:22.194 --> 00:20:23.994
minimum. This is the minimum."

00:20:23.994 --> 00:20:26.074
Now there are so many exercises,

00:20:26.074 --> 00:20:28.114
if I tell you that, you'll
be shocked.

00:20:29.034 --> 00:20:30.274
So like,

00:20:33.904 --> 00:20:35.264
you have to stand
and suddenly jump

00:20:35.984 --> 00:20:38.944
and put your both the
feet five feet apart   imagine

00:20:40.944 --> 00:20:42.104
Then turn round,

00:20:42.104 --> 00:20:44.184
to clear your nadis you see,

00:20:44.184 --> 00:20:46.094
you have to turn round

00:20:46.094 --> 00:20:49.014
and put yourself on the left side.

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:51.054
Now on the left side you put yourself

00:20:51.054 --> 00:20:53.134
and it's quite a big thing
that they have described

00:20:53.134 --> 00:20:56.174
but in short it's
a stretching exercise,

00:20:56.894 --> 00:20:58.974
and you put your
hand on the left side

00:20:58.974 --> 00:21:01.014
and go down stretch yourself,

00:21:01.014 --> 00:21:02.124
again go back to normal,

00:21:02.124 --> 00:21:04.924
again jump and go five feet apart.

00:21:04.924 --> 00:21:06.884
Then put to the right side.

00:21:06.884 --> 00:21:08.924
Nadi cleansing is this way.

00:21:09.884 --> 00:21:11.924
But there are so many
others described you see.

00:21:11.924 --> 00:21:13.084
They are so horrible.

00:21:13.084 --> 00:21:16.084
They said ordinary exercises
for ordinary people,

00:21:16.084 --> 00:21:19.874
but for a person who
wants to achieve yoga,

00:21:19.874 --> 00:21:22.154
he has to do all these
horrible exercises

00:21:22.154 --> 00:21:23.994
are I don't know, I mean,

00:21:23.994 --> 00:21:26.034
by that time all your
body will be broken

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:29.874
the way it is or in any case
you'll get moksha you see.

00:21:31.034 --> 00:21:32.144
It's like that.

00:21:32.144 --> 00:21:34.144
But what I'm trying
to tell you is this

00:21:34.864 --> 00:21:36.184
that now you've got everything simple

00:21:36.864 --> 00:21:40.024
- easy this thing, but in
a subtle way

00:21:40.024 --> 00:21:43.944
still all these nonsensical
things are sticking on,

00:21:45.864 --> 00:21:47.934
and even if you are in the boat now,

00:21:48.174 --> 00:21:51.054
still it is there and they are
creating a heavy weight,

00:21:51.974 --> 00:21:54.054
and this heavy weight can really

00:21:54.894 --> 00:21:56.134
take you down again,

00:21:56.134 --> 00:21:59.054
and when you go down
after a certain height,

00:21:59.054 --> 00:22:01.054
you go down very fast.

00:22:01.924 --> 00:22:04.084
So many people we have
thrown out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:04.084 --> 00:22:06.204
so many have gone out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:06.884 --> 00:22:08.884
so many have come into Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:08.884 --> 00:22:10.924
Now the people who have
come in the beginning,

00:22:10.924 --> 00:22:12.964
are excused for some time

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:15.164
and also they see you
how you behave,

00:22:15.844 --> 00:22:16.994
it's very important.

00:22:16.994 --> 00:22:20.074
So first thing we must
know that we are people

00:22:20.074 --> 00:22:22.194
who are Sahaja Yogis
special type of people,

00:22:22.914 --> 00:22:24.074
specially placed

00:22:24.074 --> 00:22:26.954
and we have so many privileges

00:22:26.954 --> 00:22:29.154
so we have to be extremely dignified.

00:22:30.154 --> 00:22:32.864
I've seen people just will
laugh for nothing at all.

00:22:33.184 --> 00:22:34.904
In a group, you are there,

00:22:34.904 --> 00:22:36.824
they just start laughing.

00:22:36.824 --> 00:22:37.904
There's no need to laugh

00:22:37.904 --> 00:22:39.144
but they'll just start laughing.

00:22:39.824 --> 00:22:42.944
Even if I am sitting they'll
just go on chatting

00:22:42.944 --> 00:22:45.864
and talking and, see no sense at all.

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:48.894
But if your Guru is sitting there
you have to keep quiet,

00:22:48.894 --> 00:22:50.134
you have to be humble,

00:22:50.814 --> 00:22:52.094
you have to have awe.

00:22:52.094 --> 00:22:54.054
All these things are important

00:22:54.054 --> 00:22:56.014
which we have to gradually learn,

00:22:56.014 --> 00:22:58.134
because you have never had a proper

00:22:58.974 --> 00:23:01.844
training about spiritual life.

00:23:01.844 --> 00:23:04.844
You see what these churches
or you can say

00:23:04.844 --> 00:23:06.884
these temples that you have seen or

00:23:06.884 --> 00:23:09.044
anything else that you
have got those,

00:23:09.044 --> 00:23:13.844
you see have not been
real masters to tell you

00:23:13.844 --> 00:23:16.164
how to behave, how to address,

00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:17.874
how to be there.

00:23:17.874 --> 00:23:21.034
So, now, gradually you
should see for yourself

00:23:21.034 --> 00:23:23.874
that you have to grow,
and grow very fast

00:23:23.874 --> 00:23:26.794
and for that you have to remember

00:23:26.794 --> 00:23:30.954
we must need our introspection,
to see: 'Where am I?

00:23:30.954 --> 00:23:32.104
Now what am I doing?

00:23:32.784 --> 00:23:34.864
Ah, now the anger is coming.'

00:23:34.864 --> 00:23:36.104
As soon as the anger starts coming

00:23:36.784 --> 00:23:38.944
go and stand before
your mirror and say:

00:23:38.944 --> 00:23:40.784
'Now come along let's get angry.'

00:23:41.784 --> 00:23:45.904
You face yourself all the
time and it will help.

00:23:45.904 --> 00:23:47.134
Not the others.

00:23:47.854 --> 00:23:50.934
Now I have to tell you that
whenever you find

00:23:50.934 --> 00:23:54.014
such people coming up
they will form a group,

00:23:54.014 --> 00:23:57.774
then a group can become
bigger or absolutely small,

00:23:57.774 --> 00:23:59.014
depending on you.

00:23:59.014 --> 00:24:00.054
You have to just say:

00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:03.924
'Mother has said not to listen
a word against anyone.

00:24:03.924 --> 00:24:05.124
Just not to listen.

00:24:05.844 --> 00:24:07.924
And in the beginning of course it is,

00:24:07.924 --> 00:24:09.764
quite a lot has to be tolerated.

00:24:09.764 --> 00:24:13.044
Like I've seen if you see
the letters written to Me

00:24:13.764 --> 00:24:15.764
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:15.764 --> 00:24:17.914
they are so maddening.

00:24:17.914 --> 00:24:19.954
This person talking ill about that,

00:24:19.954 --> 00:24:21.794
that person talking ill about that,

00:24:21.794 --> 00:24:24.954
I mean, anybody would
be mad to read all that.

00:24:24.954 --> 00:24:26.754
So I never read them.

00:24:26.754 --> 00:24:28.994
All these letters I used to just burn away.

00:24:28.994 --> 00:24:31.744
But luckily now these
people have become

00:24:31.744 --> 00:24:32.864
extremely sensible,

00:24:32.864 --> 00:24:34.744
they understand their responsibility,

00:24:34.744 --> 00:24:36.904
they have become very,
very beautiful people,

00:24:36.904 --> 00:24:38.744
very understanding,

00:24:38.744 --> 00:24:40.904
and the love that they
have for each other,

00:24:40.904 --> 00:24:42.744
it's very interesting.

00:24:42.744 --> 00:24:45.944
Only in love you can know
about others, not in hatred.

00:24:45.944 --> 00:24:48.734
If you hate someone how will
you know about that person,

00:24:48.734 --> 00:24:49.974
the beauty of that person?

00:24:49.974 --> 00:24:52.774
So then you start seeing
the beauty of that person

00:24:52.774 --> 00:24:54.774
and you start enjoying that person.

00:24:54.774 --> 00:24:56.774
This is what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:24:57.934 --> 00:25:01.094
So I would like you to see
that you train your children

00:25:01.764 --> 00:25:06.884
in such a manner that they
feel their responsibilities

00:25:06.909 --> 00:25:08.789
as Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:11.976 --> 00:25:13.804
May God bless you!

00:25:15.724 --> 00:25:18.554
Better be on the lookout,
there’s smaller children also.
