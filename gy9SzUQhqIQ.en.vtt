1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
They don't understand sahaja yoga and it's hard, it's hard when the majority is different to remain on the constant fact.

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The question is, what is the most important thing in the world?

3
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But you see, evolution is the survival of the fittest.

4
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And now evolution moves from material to spiritual.

5
00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So the one who is spiritually the fittest is going to be on top of evolution.

6
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So you have a big advantage in these race over the others.

7
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Because you are ahead of them.

8
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So don't go back just for the sake of being with them.

9
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It's a little bit lonely on the top of the mountain, but the view is very nice.

10
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But we are not lonely on the mountain.

11
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You are not lonely as long as you are with yourself.

12
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
He is from Switzerland. He knows mountain tops.

13
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Mountains are nice.

14
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Himavati, Shailaputra, the name of the goddess.

15
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
You know, yesterday when I spoke about Russia and Ukraine,

16
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:55.000
is that if you can manage your role here, you could help opening the Alia Chakra.

17
00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:04.000
You know, like the Chinese yogi, they help opening the door of the left side.

18
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Open the left side of the door.

19
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
You can help opening the right side of the door.

20
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And if you can do that, you will have your names on the streets in 200 years.

21
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And people will bring garlands to your grandchildren.

22
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So have a sense of perspective.

23
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I am quite surprised.

24
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Because I think that what I said is true.

25
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We also started to go like this.

26
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So now you can walk in Kiev and you can say, okay, this place I want my name.

27
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
It all works above there again.

28
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Any questions?

29
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Also, please, boys, don't go on pornography.

30
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And girls, needless to say.

31
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
You can have it on your telephone.

32
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
At least in our crazy countries, maybe not here.

33
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Don't go there.

34
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
For a simple reason.

35
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's very easy if I drop ink.

36
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It's very easy to drop ink on this sweater.

37
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But to clean the sweater is difficult.

38
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So keep your life simple.

39
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And if you do it, don't feel guilty.

40
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Just use your willpower.

41
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Conquer your freedom.

42
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Freedom from ignorance.

43
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Freedom from addiction.

44
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Freedom from what binds your spiritual evolution.

45
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Our entities closed.

46
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I have a second question.

47
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
What about astrology?

48
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Has no Shri Mataji respected it?

49
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Yes, she did.

50
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But also, she said also, she respected astrology.

51
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But she said also that the realized soul can go beyond the strength of the science.

52
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
You understand?

53
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:50.000
If you are realized, the stars lose their influence.

54
00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:02.000
But still, it is part of the game.

55
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Why are we on the bottom, not on the top?

56
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
No, because if you want to know about astrology,

57
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
it's because you want to know.

58
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
If you are on the top, you know.

59
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So you don't need astrology.

60
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You have very nice vibrations.

61
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
You think that we give you vibration, right?

62
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
You think that.

63
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
You think that.

64
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We think that you give us vibration.

65
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
We are sharing.

66
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I think that our goal is to give our goal to our own people.

67
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I think that this process is very important.

68
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
This is collective.

69
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
This is the Kalki incarnation.

70
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
This is the reincarnation of the collective.

71
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Before, it wasn't like that.

72
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Before, we were very lonely.

73
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
We were very lonely.

74
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Okay, the parrot.

75
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I said, Shri Kalki is a horse and a parrot.

76
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I explained to the horse why the parrot is a horse.

77
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Why is it a parrot?

78
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And so I asked Shri Mataji.

79
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Parrot is a standing.

80
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Parrot is the one who rides the horse?

81
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
No, parrot is a bird.

82
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It's the parrot which speaks, because he is a parrot.

83
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So I asked Shri Mataji, I understand the horse, but why the parrot?

84
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Because the horse is a parrot, and he doesn't want to be a parrot.

85
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And she responded, because he wants to communicate, but he can't.

86
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I understand, but why the parrot is a parrot?

87
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Because she said everything that was to be said.

88
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I understand, but why the parrot?

89
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And then she was silent for ten years.

90
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And she said, she didn't want to be a parrot.

91
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So this is because now the Divine did everything that it could to help us,

92
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and now it's up to us to grow.

93
00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So she stopped talking, because she said what we needed to hear.

94
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I have a question.

95
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.000
One of the first yogis, first marriages in Sahaja Yoga,

96
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
they had their children whose age they were ready for marriages,

97
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and maybe they already had children.

98
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So I think children are the purest ones.

99
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So it's the children of the children who come in Sahaja Yoga.

100
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Is it that they already came, or it's this year?

101
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Do you understand?

102
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Yes, they came already.

103
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So you know them? What age are these children?

104
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Two, three, four, five.

105
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
His grandchildren, for example.

106
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
That's why he smiled.

107
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Your children have a marriage with Sahaja children?

108
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Yes.

109
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I think it's, I feel that these children will be something, absolutely another.

110
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Look at his face.

111
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
He is naughty.

112
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
They need to be protected.

113
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
They need to be protected, and they can be born only,

114
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
they can be born only in realized families.

115
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Also they absorb a lot from school.

116
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
For everybody it's a big work.

117
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
It's like a washing machine all the time.

118
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Cleansing, cleansing, cleansing.

119
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
What did he say?

120
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
They want to be your grandchildren.

121
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
In a simple word.

122
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Maybe I will be their grandchild.

123
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I have a question.

124
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
It's more effective than to meditate in large group.

125
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Because we are losing depth in large collective while cleaning each other.

126
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
It's quite possible, but here the answer is try.

127
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Try what works.

128
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Because there is not one answer.

129
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
You need to try.

130
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
You need to meditate in small group, meditate in large group,

131
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
see what works, you pick your chart.

132
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
You are like before a landscape.

133
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
You cannot ask me how do I navigate in the landscape.

134
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Because it's your landscape, you will find.

135
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It's experimental.

136
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:51.000
But yes, you can have this situation where if there are couple of negative people,

137
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
if you have two or three people from a fake guru,

138
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
or two or three people who really have bad vibration,

139
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
it can spoil a meeting.

140
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
It can.

141
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
But I think that everything that works, it's not a problem.

142
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
We are a complex group, so it's not a problem.

143
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
But if you have negative and negative people from a collective,

144
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
you have to meditate in large collective.

145
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Because it's not a problem.

146
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
What works?

147
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
We don't have a problem with the group.

148
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I think that if you have negative and negative people,

149
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
you have to meditate in large group.

150
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
That's the important thing.

151
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
You remember the silence that we felt now?

152
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Remember? You remember? Remember?

153
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
This one you remember? Yes?

154
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Or is the other one who looked sad?

155
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Over there.

156
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
You remember? Yes.

157
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
You remember the silence? You felt the silence?

158
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I'm not sure.

159
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
You actually asked when.

160
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
If she was silent all the time, it's even better.

161
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
It's even better.

162
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
But you know, just have faith in yourself.

163
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Let's have faith in yourself.

164
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
You know what I find out sometimes to meditate with big groups,

165
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
or any group, it's about how to channelize the attention.

166
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
If in a big group the attention goes off,

167
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
it's much worse than in a smaller group sometimes.

168
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Because in a smaller group, if three or four keep the attention,

169
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
you can still meditate quite okay.

170
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
But if in a bigger group of a certain percentage of people,

171
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
the attention wanders somewhere.

172
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And that can have many reasons that it's much more difficult.

173
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
So when you find out that in a big group you can't meditate,

174
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
maybe it's also a way to find out what would you prefer,

175
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
how you want to have the meditation in order to go deeper,

176
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
to enjoy more, to get more deeper.

177
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Maybe you could find out, maybe have discussions on that.

178
00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.000
Is there anything else you want to suggest?

179
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
No, it's okay to find out in washing today.

180
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
So, today, before you started,

181
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
there are this group over here,

182
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
what is called meditation already?

183
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
It's a Buddhist group.

184
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
By Becky's method, it's called meditation within a round group.

185
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Maybe you could find out, maybe you have discussions on that.

186
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:46.000
How do we want to have our meditation and work to experience more, try different things, as Grady has said.

187
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:00.000
How would you do your meditations? The one that you describe where you are a hundred people and you don't go deep. What are you doing?

188
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Surely, if we are speaking about collective and you, we talk about…

189
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
You are not you, huh? The question was for the you.

190
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
I thought, ah, ha, ha, ha, no.

191
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
You are question for the you, huh? What do you do?

192
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
I think it is very difficult to say, but it is very difficult to say.

193
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
It is difficult.

194
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
It is difficult, like, every time different.

195
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Exactly.

196
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
So, if you can't say this, every time it will be bad, every time it will be good. So, it just depends.

197
00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:02.000
You see, what's nice to understand inside is that we are completely clueless.

198
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
What is the principle of Sahaj?

199
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
It is actually very nice because you start relaxing.

200
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And you are not relaxing, so you are not feeling well.

201
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Because what really happens in Sahaj, it is not as we do it.

202
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Because we are not able to do it in Sahaj, it is not possible to do it in our own way.

203
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
If I do this in the back of somebody, what do I do? I move my hand.

204
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
If I do this in the back of somebody, what do I do?

205
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
You have to do it in your own way.

206
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
And, I think, I don't know if I can say this, but I think it is very nice to know that you are not alone.

207
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Because you are not alone, you are not alone.

208
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
You are not alone, you are not alone. You are not alone. You are not alone.

209
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Because we, he and me, in our life, we stressed because of Sahaja Yoga.

210
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And we are not stressed because of Sahaja Yoga.

211
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Because we want to give more realization, because we think people should grow faster, because we think yogis should not fight.

212
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
But if I am frustrated, I don't help anybody and I don't help myself.

213
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
But if I am frustrated, I don't help anyone.

214
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Because of Sahaj's balance, we are not able to balance ourselves, we are not able to do anything.

215
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
We are not able to do anything.

216
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
There is one minute to four o'clock, so we can have a last question.

217
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
The boys are very shy.

218
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I like to pray.

219
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
I like to pray.

220
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I like to pray.

221
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
I like to pray.

222
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I like to pray.

223
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
I like to pray.

224
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Little.

225
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Little.

226
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
He wants the vibrations to answer.

227
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
He wants to answer.

228
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Can I ask you something?

229
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
I met you for the first time in Kabela and you just picked me up on the road.

230
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And you told me the story when you were first time in Ukraine.

231
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Can you tell the story for all of us?

232
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Because I heard it.

233
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000
But I wanted to tell the story for all of us.

234
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
When you said that Shimatazu left you here.

235
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Oh, why?

236
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Well, it's not a big story.

237
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Just I was, yay, I'm with Shimatazu.

238
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And in the morning we were supposed to go all together to the airport.

239
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And when I woke up everybody was gone.

240
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I was alone.

241
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
So still today I cannot remember how I went back to Moscow.

242
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
I simply can't remember.

243
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Obviously it must have worked out.

244
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Maybe Shimatazu just felt his desire to be in Ukraine.

245
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
See, the other thing that maybe just to add one thing, you see.

246
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Here people are naive about the West.

247
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Because you know what doesn't work in your part of the world.

248
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
And you think that in our part of the world things are better.

249
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
It's true we are better economically.

250
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Maybe infrastructures are better.

251
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Maybe there is more freedom.

252
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
But in our countries the family is destroyed.

253
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
So when the family is destroyed it becomes a vicious circle.

254
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Because the children of destroyed families are worse.

255
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
And the children of those children are worse.

256
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
And now we really, you know, it is a very serious situation.

257
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
So is it also in your vision?

258
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Have a vision for Ukraine.

259
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Don't have this vision that the future of Ukraine is to be like the Western country.

260
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
No.

261
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Your food is still healthy here, I hope.

262
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
You know, the food in our place, people get cancer left, right, left, right.

263
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Because we are poisoned by our food, we are poisoned by the pharmaceutical industry.

264
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
And the problem is that we are not able to get the food.

265
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And that is why we are in a complex that is very special.

266
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And that is why we are not able to get it.

267
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And that is why we are going to have cancer in our country.

268
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
I'm just saying that because if I were in Ukraine I would say,

269
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
if only I could travel and if I could go west and visit New York and this and that.

270
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
I understand this desire, but actually that would not be the solution.

271
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
I think that Ukraine is a very special country,

272
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
and it is a very important country in Europe, in New York.

273
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
It is a very important country, but it is not a very special problem.

274
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Thank you.

275
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
OK, so maybe we see each other in the public program tomorrow.

276
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I don't know.

277
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Is there any space?

278
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Yes, there is.

279
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
I'm a bit scared.

280
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
I'm scared.

281
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I'm scared.

282
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I'm scared.
