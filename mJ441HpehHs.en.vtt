00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.376
Today, we have gathered here to do
Ganesha Puja.

00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:17.934
I know very well that Ganesha is the symbol

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:23.128
of purity, of sanctity,

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:34.003
and worshipping the innocence.

00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:40.495
When you are worshipping Shri Ganesh,
you have to know

00:00:40.696 --> 00:00:46.188
that He is the embodiment of innocence.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:53.356
I wonder if we understand the meaning
of innocence or not.

00:00:53.946 --> 00:01:00.105
Innocence is a quality, which is innate,

00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:05.772
which cannot be forced, which cannot
be trained into.

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:13.541
It’s just a quality, innate quality,
within a human being.

00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:21.654
When he becomes Shri Ganesha’s disciple,
he becomes an innocent person.

00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:25.999
Maybe you say that innocent persons

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.536
are attacked by the cunning,
by the aggressive.

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:38.097
But innocence is such a great thing
that it cannot be destroyed.

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:44.162
Is the quality of the Spirit. Innocence is
the quality of the Spirit.

00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:52.834
And when this Spirit within you is
awakened, you get the power of innocence,

00:01:53.035 --> 00:02:00.100
by which you overcome all that is negative,
all that is wrong,

00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:08.899
all that is detrimental to your growth,
spiritual understanding.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.181
So to be innocent is not possible.

00:02:14.692 --> 00:02:22.009
You have to be innocent, in the sense
that you are innately innocent.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.125
This happens after Sahaja Yoga,
after Realization.

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:35.362
And your power to fight all these

00:02:35.563 --> 00:02:40.917
wrong, negative feelings within you,
and without,

00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:51.002
are absolutely supported, protected
by the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.256
It’s difficult these days to tell somebody
about innocence.

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:10.015
But you know the life of Christ.
He was a innocent - innocence.

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:14.743
He didn’t know what sort of people
He was around.

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:21.625
He thought they were all innocent. And so
He was talking to them in a manner

00:03:22.273 --> 00:03:32.143
that nobody who was cunning would
have done that.

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:35.975
Because cunning always understand
the cunning of others.

00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:43.552
And He said things which may not have
been understood by people;

00:03:43.753 --> 00:03:50.258
but whatever He said had the vibrations
of innocence.

00:03:50.757 --> 00:03:56.808
That should have put all these people
in a proper sense,

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.067
in a proper relationship with Him.

00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:04.306
But somehow, that was not the time
perhaps for them

00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:06.754
to be realized souls.

00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:14.955
So the innocence of Ganesha was not,
that we should we say, defeated,

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:24.397
but was very much - created an atmosphere
of such sanctity

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:28.947
and beauty that you can see in the life
of Christ.

00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:35.858
I’m happy you all have heard about
your marriages.

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:42.041
Why the marriage? What is the need
to have a marriage?

00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:46.455
After all, these days people are living
without marriage.

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:50.929
But marriage means the sanctity
of marriage.

00:04:51.489 --> 00:04:59.916
Sanctity of your physical, mental
and emotional integration.

00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:05.643
If you do not have the sanctity and you
live with a person,

00:05:05.844 --> 00:05:12.932
then it is not perfect. The children you
will produce will not be all right.

00:05:13.133 --> 00:05:15.694
That’s why the marriage is necessary.

00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:21.604
And as you know, Christ went to attend
a wedding.

00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:25.373
Why did He pay so much attention
to a wedding?

00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:30.924
Because that sanctifies your relationships
with each other.

00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:36.129
Anything is all right, but relationship

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.897
between husband and wife have
to be sanctified.

00:05:40.098 --> 00:05:45.858
Otherwise, the children you produce
could turn out to be anything.

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:54.377
They may be robbers, they may be cheats,
they may be liars,

00:05:54.578 --> 00:06:00.815
they may be very, very cruel people,
if there’s no sanctity about the marriage.

00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:05.186
That’s why He went to sanctify the marriage
institution.

00:06:05.387 --> 00:06:11.006
But is absolutely wrong and nonsense
that He created alcohol.

00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:21.010
What He did was to change the water
into the taste of grape juice.

00:06:21.211 --> 00:06:25.323
“Alcohol” is called as “grape juice”
in Hebrew language.

00:06:25.524 --> 00:06:33.604
You can say it is not called, but “wine”
means alcohol

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:38.330
as well as grape juice. But it cannot be,

00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:43.393
because instantly you cannot create
alcohol.

00:06:43.594 --> 00:06:47.686
Alcohol takes time, it has to rot
and rot and rot.

00:06:47.887 --> 00:06:55.080
Then it becomes an alcohol. But if Christ
has made it

00:06:55.281 --> 00:07:02.877
in such a sahaj manner, spontaneously,
how can it be an alcohol that intoxicates?

00:07:03.078 --> 00:07:06.311
So, many people, specially in Christian
religion,

00:07:06.512 --> 00:07:12.780
believe that Christ sanctified wine,
which is absolutely wrong.

00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:17.123
He never sanctified alcohol. He changed

00:07:17.324 --> 00:07:26.018
the grape juice into wine tasting.

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:29.780
The other day, I happened to meet person,

00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:32.828
as you know him, Romano Battaglia.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.295
And he said: “Mother, You give me
Realization”.

00:07:37.496 --> 00:07:40.737
I said: “Alright, get me some water.”

00:07:40.938 --> 00:07:45.471
Brought some water, I put my fingers
into it.

00:07:45.672 --> 00:07:50.237
And then he tasted and said: “Mother,
it tastes like wine!” I said: “That’s it!

00:07:50.438 --> 00:07:56.331
That’s what Christ has done.” So,
there is no sanctity of alcohol.

00:07:56.532 --> 00:08:01.386
How can you expect Christ to do
something like that,

00:08:01.587 --> 00:08:05.895
by which your awareness absolutely
goes wrong.

00:08:06.462 --> 00:08:10.436
Those people who drink, you know,
are not normal people.

00:08:10.637 --> 00:08:14.628
Something goes wrong with their brains.
When they drive, they create problems.

00:08:14.829 --> 00:08:23.046
When they are talking to somebody,
you can make out that they are not normal.

00:08:23.247 --> 00:08:25.487
They try to be very aggressive,

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:30.569
sometimes they can be very passive also.
Mostly they are very aggressive,

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:37.011
and very much behaving in a manner
that doesn’t behove a human being.

00:08:37.212 --> 00:08:41.995
So, we must understand that

00:08:42.196 --> 00:08:46.315
this wine, so-called, which is being
fermented for days together,

00:08:46.516 --> 00:08:51.571
is very wrong and against the spiritual
life.

00:08:52.723 --> 00:09:01.921
All those countries where alcohol
is accepted as a very sanctified thing,

00:09:02.122 --> 00:09:05.948
are just going to dogs.

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:10.386
It is against Shri Ganesh. It’s against
innocence.

00:09:10.587 --> 00:09:15.893
And so, such a person can become
very cunning, very shrewd,

00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:20.721
very dominating – all kinds of bad things
can come through him.

00:09:20.922 --> 00:09:26.362
And one cannot trust a person who drinks
and becomes a drunkard.

00:09:26.563 --> 00:09:31.686
He can get after his wife, his children,
anybody.

00:09:31.887 --> 00:09:37.986
And try to destroy their lives, because
he knows he is himself destroyed.

00:09:38.547 --> 00:09:44.073
So the one thing one has to understand,
innocence doesn’t allow you

00:09:44.274 --> 00:09:48.964
to have anything like that, that goes
against your awareness.

00:09:49.165 --> 00:09:54.436
Your human awareness is very important.
That must be respected.

00:09:54.637 --> 00:09:59.405
Anything that you take that spoils
your awareness or spoils your health

00:09:59.606 --> 00:10:04.179
is all wrong for - specially for sahaj
yogis.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:09.311
You have to keep your health all right.
How do you keep your health all right?

00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:16.044
By avoiding all such things – those which
destroy your health.

00:10:16.419 --> 00:10:19.901
So the married life is a sanctified life.

00:10:20.102 --> 00:10:24.534
Is a life which is been blessed.

00:10:24.735 --> 00:10:29.964
Now we have peace, but I would say
in Sahaja Yoga, they are all blessed by Me.

00:10:30.165 --> 00:10:36.401
So one should understand that this is
a very big thing that you have got.

00:10:36.602 --> 00:10:41.237
But there are many I have known, who come
round saying: “Mother, we want a divorce.

00:10:41.438 --> 00:10:45.249
We are trying to make up a good marriage…”

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.458
All kinds of stories they tell Me.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.132
If you know it’s a sanctified marriage –

00:10:52.359 --> 00:11:02.706
is a marriage which is been done under
all the ceremonies of Sahaja Yoga –

00:11:02.907 --> 00:11:09.882
it cannot be a bad marriage. But if you
are bad, nobody can help you.

00:11:10.083 --> 00:11:15.538
If you have funny ideas about marriages,
you should try to correct it.

00:11:15.739 --> 00:11:19.182
If you want to marry in Sahaja Yoga,
then please see

00:11:19.383 --> 00:11:24.339
that you respect the sanctity of married
life.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.811
I know, sometimes women can be bad,

00:11:28.012 --> 00:11:31.081
men can be bad, there can be problems.

00:11:31.282 --> 00:11:35.893
But a person who is wise will try
to endure all that.

00:11:36.094 --> 00:11:43.897
Because she wants or he wants to respect
the sanctity of marriage.

00:11:46.368 --> 00:11:51.624
This one is a very contradictory thing
then, which comes to,

00:11:51.825 --> 00:11:55.532
that Christ was born without the marriage.

00:11:55.733 --> 00:11:59.865
And Ganesha was also born without
the marriage.

00:12:00.376 --> 00:12:04.022
They Themselves are sanctity.

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:07.386
They don’t need any sanctity from outside.

00:12:07.587 --> 00:12:11.085
They are innocence, and for innocent
people,

00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:18.995
They don’t need any kind of a ritual
or a kind of a ceremony.

00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:25.128
That’s how They have been born,
absolutely pure, of innocence.

00:12:25.329 --> 00:12:30.284
But that doesn’t mean that we should
take Their example into ourselves.

00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:34.694
They were divine personalities, and They
were to be born like that.

00:12:34.895 --> 00:12:40.797
While we have to be sanctified and leading
a sanctified life.

00:12:41.013 --> 00:12:46.376
This is a difference between an incarnation
and a human being.

00:12:46.861 --> 00:12:54.174
Is easy to criticise incarnations.
Very simple to criticise Them.

00:12:54.375 --> 00:12:58.174
All incarnations have been criticised
by human beings,

00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:01.346
because human beings cannot understand
Them.

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:07.436
But try to be really very pure and
innocent,

00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:12.608
and then you will understand that why
Their lives were on a different line,

00:13:12.809 --> 00:13:15.291
different style.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:24.513
Now, if you say: “We can develop
innocence, Mother”, you cannot.

00:13:25.144 --> 00:13:29.717
Which is the way to become innocent?
In Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:36.647
we have a proper method how we can
become innocent.

00:13:36.848 --> 00:13:43.678
It happens through our thoughtless
awareness.

00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:47.823
If you are in the state of thoughtless
awareness,

00:13:48.034 --> 00:13:51.256
then what happens, you do not react.

00:13:51.457 --> 00:13:56.657
You do not get involved into wrong things.

00:13:57.102 --> 00:14:03.002
You do not get involved into any
discussions, arguments. But you just watch.

00:14:03.203 --> 00:14:06.209
And the innocence within you rises
beautifully,

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:11.228
like a lotus rises out of a dirty pond.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.002
So, whatever may be the circumstances,

00:14:14.203 --> 00:14:18.850
when you are in thoughtless awareness,
you do not react.

00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:25.620
That is the sign of innocence. And people
who do not react keep young.

00:14:25.821 --> 00:14:28.952
They will never show their age,
they keep young.

00:14:29.153 --> 00:14:38.737
Because to react is not a very good thing,

00:14:38.938 --> 00:14:43.565
which makes you get involved into
another person.

00:14:43.766 --> 00:14:49.291
But if you don’t react, if you are just
watching, and you are a witness,

00:14:49.492 --> 00:14:53.565
then you don’t get involved into anything.
You are away from everything.

00:14:53.766 --> 00:15:00.485
And that’s how your innocence grows
and you get very confident.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:07.602
I’ve read a story about a Chinese king,
who went

00:15:08.585 --> 00:15:17.397
to a saint, and asked Him that he wants
some boon from Him. He said, “What?”

00:15:17.598 --> 00:15:23.737
He said: “I want my son to be developed
into a person

00:15:23.938 --> 00:15:26.788
who can face all kinds of people.

00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:30.737
Whatever people may do, he should
be able to face them”.

00:15:30.938 --> 00:15:34.457
He said: “Alright, you leave your son
with me”.

00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:39.475
So, when the arguments started,
when the fighting started,

00:15:39.676 --> 00:15:41.487
his son was just standing straight,

00:15:41.688 --> 00:15:44.545
watching everything in thoughtless
awareness.

00:15:44.746 --> 00:15:52.170
So, everybody from the arena went back,
they all went away.

00:15:52.371 --> 00:16:00.021
And they couldn’t stand the innocence
of this boy, who was very young.

00:16:00.222 --> 00:16:04.064
And the king was surprised how his son
could face

00:16:04.265 --> 00:16:08.209
all of them, all their arguments,
all their aggression

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.623
and all kinds of horrible things
they said to him.

00:16:12.824 --> 00:16:18.701
If anybody says anything to you, you should
just be innocent.

00:16:18.902 --> 00:16:22.713
At that time, your power of innocence
will show

00:16:22.914 --> 00:16:27.517
that this person, who is trying
to dominate you,

00:16:27.718 --> 00:16:32.052
to trouble you, is very much in the wrong.

00:16:32.253 --> 00:16:37.646
And the person himself might realise that:
“I’m doing all these things

00:16:37.847 --> 00:16:42.952
and this fellow, the one on whom I’m trying
to dominate,

00:16:43.153 --> 00:16:45.470
is not taking any note of it.”

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:50.050
So he feels very weak.

00:16:50.251 --> 00:16:53.511
He thinks he has no power to dominate
a person.

00:16:53.712 --> 00:16:56.882
So this is we have now as sahaj yogis:

00:16:57.083 --> 00:16:59.745
we can get into thoughtless awareness.

00:16:59.946 --> 00:17:03.952
Try to reduce your reactions, reaction
to anything.

00:17:04.153 --> 00:17:09.265
People have such funny ideas about
themselves that they react.

00:17:09.466 --> 00:17:13.859
Now for example, somebody showed me
those carpets,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.933
I’ve started watching, I was very happy.
And they told me

00:17:18.134 --> 00:17:23.206
all the sahaja yoginis have made these
with their hands, so beautifully.

00:17:23.407 --> 00:17:28.273
I mean, it was really so joyful to know
that they have done it.

00:17:28.474 --> 00:17:35.167
But if I was a very normal person, I would
have said: “Oh, My God,

00:17:35.368 --> 00:17:39.097
what a colour! What a thing!” and all
that ... like that.

00:17:39.298 --> 00:17:43.030
So whatever they have done, I can’t even
enjoy that.

00:17:43.231 --> 00:17:49.015
One thing is the enjoyment is lost.
For a child, enjoyment is complete.

00:17:49.216 --> 00:17:54.741
Whatever he sees, he makes a joy,
joyful thing out of it.

00:17:54.942 --> 00:17:58.620
You look at children - I’ve seen children,

00:17:58.821 --> 00:18:01.605
they find anything, they make a toy
out of it.

00:18:01.806 --> 00:18:08.136
The other day, we had gone to Genoa and
I saw there were big blockets kept there.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:11.234
Some children came from somewhere.
They just climbed on that

00:18:11.435 --> 00:18:14.441
and made horses out of them. And were
enjoying them.

00:18:14.642 --> 00:18:17.085
You see, they find anything, any space,

00:18:17.286 --> 00:18:22.460
they make a joyful thing for them to,
a play for them.

00:18:22.661 --> 00:18:30.894
For them, life is also a play.
Just a thing of enjoyment.

00:18:31.095 --> 00:18:33.749
And they make you also enjoy everything.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:39.023
If you are not in a good mood, they’ll
come and behave in such a manner

00:18:39.224 --> 00:18:48.882
that you’ll have to come round and become
a very simple, natural person.

00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:52.089
So to see, a simple natural person,
we always say:

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:56.976
“See, they are like children”. Means they
do not understand the cunning.

00:18:57.177 --> 00:19:01.632
They do not understand the stupidity
of the people,

00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:04.894
and they live in their own world
of innocence.

00:19:05.095 --> 00:19:11.773
In the same way, all the Sahaja Yogis
have to develop that aura around them.

00:19:11.974 --> 00:19:17.062
Let people see you, how innocent you are,
how sweet you are!

00:19:17.263 --> 00:19:22.390
No arguments, no quarrelling, no fighting
is needed.

00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:28.898
It is just the inner satisfaction
of thoughtless awareness.

00:19:29.099 --> 00:19:31.710
Many people say: “Mother, we cannot
become thoughtless!”

00:19:31.911 --> 00:19:34.284
Why? Why can’t you become thoughtless?

00:19:34.485 --> 00:19:39.198
Because all the time, whatever you see,
you want to react.

00:19:39.399 --> 00:19:42.726
If you gradually start stopping reaction -

00:19:42.927 --> 00:19:46.027
introspect yourself, see for yourself.

00:19:46.228 --> 00:19:55.618
If you are all the time trying to react,
tell your mind to behave itself.

00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.784
If there’s any reaction, you just don’t say
anything. Keep quiet.

00:20:00.985 --> 00:20:04.933
Gradually, you’ll be amazed and surprised

00:20:05.134 --> 00:20:12.581
how you become thoughtlessly aware,
how beautiful you become.

00:20:12.782 --> 00:20:16.964
And everybody who sees you will know that

00:20:17.165 --> 00:20:21.312
you are something different – you are not
like the normal person.

00:20:21.513 --> 00:20:25.617
But the normal reaction of human beings is
this, that, if there’s a quarrel going on,

00:20:25.818 --> 00:20:32.156
say, on the street, everybody will join in
the quarrel. They like to fight.

00:20:32.357 --> 00:20:39.344
They want to be part and parcel of that
quarrel or fight or whatever it is.

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:41.777
They don’t want to get out of it.

00:20:41.978 --> 00:20:47.097
At that time, if you just have your
innocence, that will act.

00:20:47.298 --> 00:20:50.905
I told you, innocence is the Spirit,
and Spirit is the innocence,

00:20:51.106 --> 00:20:56.374
which cannot be destroyed by anything.
The fact is that it cannot be destroyed

00:20:56.575 --> 00:21:03.197
by anything, and it can be re-established
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:03.398 --> 00:21:06.236
You might have been a very aggressive
person,

00:21:06.437 --> 00:21:08.980
you might have been a very unhappy person,

00:21:09.181 --> 00:21:14.027
you might have been a person who is
all the time disturbing others – maybe.

00:21:14.228 --> 00:21:19.202
But after Sahaja Yoga, you can make
your personality so sweet and beautiful,

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:24.242
that not only you can enjoy, but others
can also enjoy.

00:21:26.352 --> 00:21:34.477
This innocence is something which is
absolute, honest intelligence.

00:21:35.466 --> 00:21:45.222
It is not that it works for the purpose,
some purpose.

00:21:45.423 --> 00:21:50.433
But it is purposeless. It’s absolutely
purposeless.

00:21:50.634 --> 00:21:58.944
And thus it achieves that height of joy
because there is no purpose in anything

00:21:59.145 --> 00:22:03.881
It sees the futility of all kinds
of endeavours that we have,

00:22:04.082 --> 00:22:08.956
and it just enjoys: “Why people are running
up and down, why are they fighting?”

00:22:09.159 --> 00:22:13.878
Just stands up and sees, that: “Why
should they do it?” – like that.

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:15.995
Some may think they are all right,

00:22:16.196 --> 00:22:19.476
there’s nothing wrong with them,
but it’s not so.

00:22:19.677 --> 00:22:24.108
Innocence is something, I told you,
is an innate quality,

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:30.020
and you should not deceive yourself
by thinking you are innocent.

00:22:30.255 --> 00:22:34.893
On the contrary, you just put some
introspection upon yourself,

00:22:35.094 --> 00:22:38.563
and see for yourself what have you been
doing so far,

00:22:38.764 --> 00:22:44.058
as far as others are concerned?
What is your attitude?

00:22:44.259 --> 00:22:47.905
I have already talked to you about
emotional intelligence.

00:22:48.106 --> 00:22:52.714
Emotional intelligence is the expression
of innocence.

00:22:52.915 --> 00:22:57.433
It is the expression of Shri Ganesha
within you.

00:22:57.634 --> 00:23:03.159
Children who are gifted with this will
always try to please you.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.397
They know what you want, what you need.

00:23:06.598 --> 00:23:09.823
They’ll give you all the joy that you want,

00:23:10.024 --> 00:23:13.569
they’ll do all the things that you like,
just to please you.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:18.601
They don’t have their own wants. They don’t
want to have their own demands.

00:23:18.802 --> 00:23:22.972
They never say: “I want this”,
“You do for me” – never!

00:23:23.173 --> 00:23:27.542
They just want to see what you want,
what do you want to have.

00:23:27.743 --> 00:23:33.854
And they put all the effort to supply you
with that, whatever you want.

00:23:34.055 --> 00:23:37.101
It’s very interesting how the children
behave

00:23:37.302 --> 00:23:45.448
towards others, elders. Just like, I would
say, a great understanding, we should say,

00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:49.780
like a very elderly personality.

00:23:49.981 --> 00:23:54.062
So, in innocence, you become extremely
grown up, matured.

00:23:54.263 --> 00:23:57.331
Very matured. With that maturity you know

00:23:57.532 --> 00:24:02.222
what this person needs, and what
the other person should not have.

00:24:02.423 --> 00:24:05.312
And the way they establish is very
interesting.

00:24:05.513 --> 00:24:09.534
Children are the most interesting things,
I think, in the world.

00:24:09.735 --> 00:24:15.636
For me, roses are very beautiful, but
children are the most interesting things.

00:24:15.837 --> 00:24:22.116
And they teach you so many things that
you are surprised at their innocence.

00:24:22.317 --> 00:24:27.054
So many jokes are there about the children
– how they behave, how they talk.

00:24:27.255 --> 00:24:32.015
And they are so innocent that they will
tell everything to everyone.

00:24:32.216 --> 00:24:38.491
They have no way of hiding anything,
it’s very difficult.

00:24:38.692 --> 00:24:46.085
I know one joke: when a gentleman
came to the house for dinner.

00:24:46.286 --> 00:24:49.809
So the child was looking at him
very intensely.

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:53.738
And then he says: “Mother, he doesn’t eat

00:24:53.939 --> 00:24:57.844
like a horse, as you told me!”.
So everybody was shocked!

00:24:58.045 --> 00:24:59.629
“You see, he doesn’t eat like a horse!”.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.110
Mother must have told him: “He eats
like a horse”.

00:25:02.311 --> 00:25:05.004
So he looked at him: “He doesn’t
eat like a horse!”. You see,

00:25:05.205 --> 00:25:08.695
they are so innocent sometimes,
they say things,

00:25:08.896 --> 00:25:11.684
by which you can get exposed completely.

00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:17.387
There are so many jokes about it. And if
you write some books,

00:25:17.588 --> 00:25:22.297
writing the jokes of children, I tell you,
people will just enjoy it.

00:25:22.498 --> 00:25:27.945
Because so innocently they say things,
which are nothing but the truth.

00:25:28.146 --> 00:25:32.250
And they cannot tell lies. They are
so truthful,

00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:37.070
that’s the quality of innocence.
They never tell lies.

00:25:37.271 --> 00:25:39.488
“You did this?” “Yes, I did.”

00:25:39.689 --> 00:25:44.047
“You didn’t do this?” “No, I didn’t do.”
They never tell lies.

00:25:44.248 --> 00:25:53.333
It is we, the grown-ups teach them to how
to tell lies, how to be cheating.

00:25:54.814 --> 00:25:58.047
Then we teach also our children another
bad thing,

00:25:58.248 --> 00:26:01.379
that is, “You must possess everything.”

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.871
Especially in the West, is a thing they do.

00:26:06.072 --> 00:26:11.595
They tell the child that: “This is yours,
you should not give it to anyone,

00:26:11.796 --> 00:26:13.965
this is your own.”

00:26:14.166 --> 00:26:19.106
On the contrary, you should tell them:
“You can do what you like.”

00:26:19.307 --> 00:26:20.790
Leave it to their innocence.

00:26:20.991 --> 00:26:24.723
You’ll be amazed, they’ll give up
everything that they have.

00:26:24.924 --> 00:26:28.500
In such a beautiful manner they’ll behave,
that you’ll be amazed

00:26:28.701 --> 00:26:36.035
how they try to please everyone, and try
to do something to entertain you.

00:26:36.236 --> 00:26:40.742
All their capacity of this is so great
that sometimes

00:26:40.943 --> 00:26:45.367
one wonders how these little things
have developed these capacities.

00:26:45.568 --> 00:26:49.879
It is the blessings of Shri Ganesha.
Is His blessings

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:57.227
that children are so very sweet and
so much entertaining, and so beautiful.

00:26:57.428 --> 00:27:00.848
Try to become like them. We have to be
like them.

00:27:01.049 --> 00:27:04.813
You might have read many books, you might
have got lots of degrees,

00:27:05.014 --> 00:27:09.680
you might be something great, but you are
not a childlike.

00:27:09.881 --> 00:27:18.027
You have to be a childlike person.
Otherwise, no one likes your company.

00:27:18.228 --> 00:27:22.047
We call them bores. But actually boring
comes with the people

00:27:22.248 --> 00:27:27.421
who have no innocence in their heart.
They are trying to tell you:

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:32.891
“You must do this. If you want to be
successful, you do that.”

00:27:33.092 --> 00:27:35.957
All these lectures are useless
for children.

00:27:36.158 --> 00:27:40.469
In the same way, it should be within
your own understanding

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.590
that it’s all nonsense they are talking.

00:27:43.791 --> 00:27:47.719
As the children don’t care for what
you suggest to them –

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:52.297
to be nasty, to be horrid – in the same
way, if you are innocent

00:27:52.498 --> 00:27:56.723
you will not accept it. You may listen
to anything,

00:27:56.924 --> 00:28:00.735
let them tell you anything they want to,
doesn’t matter.

00:28:00.936 --> 00:28:05.451
You’ll never do that, because you cannot,
because you are innocent.

00:28:05.686 --> 00:28:09.551
And the innocence will guard you, it will
give you proper guidance

00:28:09.752 --> 00:28:12.735
what is to be done, what is not to be
done.

00:28:12.936 --> 00:28:18.961
Now try to introspect and see for yourself:
“Are you innocent or not?”

00:28:19.162 --> 00:28:24.561
People think that somebody is trying
to overpower you,

00:28:25.045 --> 00:28:32.125
is trying to harm you, is trying to put
you down.

00:28:32.326 --> 00:28:34.953
Nobody can put down innocence.

00:28:35.154 --> 00:28:40.770
Innocence is a quality that survives
all kinds of nonsense.

00:28:40.971 --> 00:28:48.892
And not only that, but age, your health,
your mind,

00:28:49.725 --> 00:28:55.414
your thinking, and your emotions,

00:28:55.615 --> 00:29:02.166
are extremely innocent and you enjoy
yourself.

00:29:03.588 --> 00:29:08.534
Nowadays, there’s a big wave

00:29:11.141 --> 00:29:14.567
of shamelessness. Sometimes they have.

00:29:16.127 --> 00:29:19.031
The people I’ve seen, they have no Lajja.

00:29:19.232 --> 00:29:21.801
I don’t know, some men want to attract
women

00:29:22.002 --> 00:29:26.184
and some women want to attract men.
Children never do like that.

00:29:26.385 --> 00:29:30.453
They don’t know what is this ‘to attract
men’ or ‘to attract women’,

00:29:30.654 --> 00:29:36.895
or ‘attract’ anyone. They’ll try to please
the dog, they’ll try to please a horse,

00:29:37.096 --> 00:29:43.590
but they never I’ve seen going all out
to attract someone.

00:29:43.791 --> 00:29:49.682
The reason is this, that their self-esteem
is complete.

00:29:50.521 --> 00:29:53.340
They know about themselves fully.

00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:55.481
So why should they do all this nonsense

00:29:55.682 --> 00:30:01.371
of running after women, running after men
and creating problems for themselves?

00:30:01.572 --> 00:30:05.860
Their self-esteem is complete. Innocence
is like that.

00:30:06.061 --> 00:30:09.813
It gives you a complete self-esteem.

00:30:10.014 --> 00:30:14.438
You don’t bow to anyone, nor you make
anybody else to bow.

00:30:14.639 --> 00:30:19.313
This is the beauty of innocence, which
works out so well within you.

00:30:19.514 --> 00:30:24.488
That’s why I always say that: “Worship
Shri Ganesha!”

00:30:24.689 --> 00:30:32.485
I know of somebody who was very highly
placed.

00:30:32.686 --> 00:30:39.305
And suddenly I was surprised how
he was paralysed.

00:30:39.506 --> 00:30:45.436
What happened? He was a very good man,
he should not have been paralysed.

00:30:45.834 --> 00:30:55.579
Then I found out that he had very bad
intentions about women,

00:30:56.166 --> 00:30:59.797
and that’s how he got this problem.

00:30:59.998 --> 00:31:04.621
So I told him: “You’d better worship
Ganesha. You worship Shri Ganesha”.

00:31:04.822 --> 00:31:08.727
Worshipping the Shri Ganesha improves
your Mooladhara,

00:31:08.963 --> 00:31:16.934
improves your sense of shame, improves
of your own dignity, self-esteem.

00:31:17.135 --> 00:31:22.922
You dress up in a way that shows that
you respect your body.

00:31:23.123 --> 00:31:28.113
You talk in such a way that shows that
you respect your tongue,

00:31:28.314 --> 00:31:33.485
your language. You cannot have a foul
mouth if you are an innocent person.

00:31:33.686 --> 00:31:41.016
Cannot have a mind that can abuse
or can say horrible words.

00:31:41.217 --> 00:31:46.781
I have seen, in America, they talk in such
a funny manner that you are shocked.

00:31:46.982 --> 00:31:52.250
There’s no need to use these dirty words
to express yourself.

00:31:52.451 --> 00:31:57.727
With that, your tongue gets spoiled.
So innocence is gone from your tongue.

00:31:57.928 --> 00:32:00.059
If you have lost innocence from
your tongue,

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.391
whatever you say will never come true –
will never come true.

00:32:04.592 --> 00:32:07.606
But if you are innocent, and your tongue
is innocent

00:32:07.807 --> 00:32:11.188
and respects… So the basic, as you
can see,

00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:14.082
is respect your innocence in every manner.

00:32:14.283 --> 00:32:20.317
Like, when you have to get angry with
somebody or say something,

00:32:20.518 --> 00:32:22.438
just keep quiet is the best way.

00:32:22.639 --> 00:32:28.719
Or else you must respect your tongue,
respect your eyes.

00:32:28.955 --> 00:32:33.953
Some people have a very bad habit of roving
their eyes all over, looking at women;

00:32:34.154 --> 00:32:38.977
or some women are like that. You don’t
respect your eyes,

00:32:39.178 --> 00:32:44.703
then they develop problems of the eyes.
Not only that, but mind also.

00:32:44.904 --> 00:32:51.930
Mind gets so much ruined by this kind
of behaviour that it has no sense.

00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:56.641
It cannot enjoy anything. Such a person
cannot enjoy anything.

00:32:56.842 --> 00:33:04.232
If you are a person who respects your eyes,
your nose, your ears –

00:33:05.197 --> 00:33:10.824
I tell you, you’ll be amazed. Everything is
so enjoyable.

00:33:11.025 --> 00:33:14.266
In this world there are so many things
to be enjoyed.

00:33:14.467 --> 00:33:17.238
But people can’t hear anything that is
good.

00:33:17.439 --> 00:33:20.477
There are birds who are chirping –
they can’t hear.

00:33:20.678 --> 00:33:23.356
There are trees, which are growing,
they can’t see.

00:33:23.557 --> 00:33:27.129
There are flowers, which have fragrance –
they cannot smell.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:31.649
Because they are so much low
in their self-esteem,

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.309
because they are very low-level people,
I should say,

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:38.547
who cannot enjoy everything around.

00:33:38.748 --> 00:33:41.414
And they should be a source of enjoyment.

00:33:41.615 --> 00:33:45.457
You see children, how they are source
of enjoyment!

00:33:45.658 --> 00:33:49.547
Anybody who comes on the stage and
runs about, I mean, how we enjoy.

00:33:49.748 --> 00:33:52.684
Why? Why do we enjoy a child running
about?

00:33:52.885 --> 00:33:57.512
We don’t say he’s gone amuck, or he’s
drunk, but we enjoy the child. Why?

00:33:57.713 --> 00:34:02.578
What is the sweetness of that child that
makes us so happy?

00:34:02.779 --> 00:34:07.496
Because that’s innocence. His power
is innocence.

00:34:07.697 --> 00:34:12.652
With that power, he is just looking
so sweet, so beautiful

00:34:12.853 --> 00:34:16.188
that it gives us the real joy within us.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:21.367
So the second thing is that innocence
is joy-giving.

00:34:21.568 --> 00:34:26.898
Innocence gives joy to people. Anything
said innocently,

00:34:27.099 --> 00:34:32.430
anything done innocently is very,
very joy-giving.

00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:40.309
And, in that, you see the person
so transparent, so beautiful,

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:49.984
that you enjoy that transparency and
that sanctified innocence.

00:34:50.185 --> 00:34:53.309
That’s why Ganesha is worshipped first.

00:34:53.510 --> 00:35:00.500
Because Ganesha was the first Deity
that was created by Adi Shakti.

00:35:00.701 --> 00:35:06.688
Because, if She has to create something,

00:35:06.889 --> 00:35:09.410
She must know that there has to be
power of innocence.

00:35:09.611 --> 00:35:13.797
Otherwise people will go wrong, they’ll
do all kinds of wrong things.

00:35:13.998 --> 00:35:18.328
So first She created Ganesha, whose
innocence –

00:35:18.529 --> 00:35:24.063
you can call the vibrations – are so strong
that it controls.

00:35:24.264 --> 00:35:28.355
Of course, there are people who have
abandoned completely

00:35:28.556 --> 00:35:32.957
their innocence and they think no end
of themselves. Just forget about them!

00:35:33.158 --> 00:35:39.754
But normally, normally, you are always
guided by your innocence,

00:35:39.955 --> 00:35:45.207
whether you are aware of it or not,
and that is such a sweet thing.

00:35:45.408 --> 00:35:48.760
Such a sweet thing that it makes

00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:52.586
people rise in their nobleness,
in their greatness.

00:35:52.787 --> 00:35:57.539
And that is what we have to develop in us,
the sahaj yogis.

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:01.465
When sahaj yogis go anywhere, try to do
anything,

00:36:01.666 --> 00:36:03.973
meet anybody, any social work

00:36:04.174 --> 00:36:09.836
anything, people should feel that joy that
you have within yourself.

00:36:10.037 --> 00:36:13.447
It’s for that joy only

00:36:14.806 --> 00:36:18.582
the Adi Shakti created Shri Ganesha.

00:36:18.783 --> 00:36:23.957
Because that joy within, of innocent joy,
which doesn’t harm anybody,

00:36:24.158 --> 00:36:27.156
which doesn’t expect anything, which
doesn’t demand anything,

00:36:27.357 --> 00:36:32.988
which doesn’t want anything, but just
emitting joy all over -

00:36:33.189 --> 00:36:36.285
that sort of a personality you should have.

00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:39.578
There’s nothing wrong in wearing good
dresses,

00:36:39.779 --> 00:36:42.367
nothing wrong in eating good food,

00:36:42.568 --> 00:36:47.070
nothing wrong in having conversations
with people.

00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:51.813
But in all that, it is the respect
of the innocence,

00:36:52.037 --> 00:36:54.848
the expression of innocence should be
there.

00:36:55.049 --> 00:36:59.469
With this innocence we can solve
the problems –

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.199
all the problems of the world can be
solved.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.703
That’s why Shri Ganesha is so important.

00:37:05.904 --> 00:37:11.977
If you do not have proper understanding
of Shri Ganesha,

00:37:12.178 --> 00:37:18.664
and if your Shri Ganesha is in a jeopardy,
I don’t know what can happen to you.

00:37:18.865 --> 00:37:24.164
These days, see, so many horrible diseases
are coming,

00:37:24.365 --> 00:37:29.258
because they are not sanctified. Their
relationships are not sanctified.

00:37:29.459 --> 00:37:33.770
Every relationship has to be sanctified
with your innocence.

00:37:33.971 --> 00:37:38.512
Like, you have a sister, you have a mother,
you have a brother,

00:37:38.713 --> 00:37:42.684
you have a father, you have all these
relationships.

00:37:42.885 --> 00:37:47.539
And these all relationships they are
so good, so beautiful and sanctified,

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:52.297
because there is the relationship
of innocence.

00:37:52.498 --> 00:37:57.773
You love your father out of innocence, and
you love your daughter out of innocence,

00:37:57.974 --> 00:38:02.367
you love your mother out of innocence.
Why should you love,

00:38:02.568 --> 00:38:06.191
for some sort of a gain? Then it’s
cunning.

00:38:06.392 --> 00:38:12.504
For some sort of an overpowering?
Then it’s cunning.

00:38:12.705 --> 00:38:17.105
It’s just for love’s, love’s sake. That’s
possible if you are innocent.

00:38:17.306 --> 00:38:21.078
So now I’m happy: tomorrow you are
all going to get married.

00:38:21.279 --> 00:38:23.871
And those people who are getting married
should understand

00:38:24.072 --> 00:38:27.625
that it’s a sanctified marriage.
It’s very important.

00:38:27.826 --> 00:38:34.457
It’s not like any other marriage. It’s the
marriage taking place in my presence.

00:38:34.658 --> 00:38:39.824
So be careful! Now, if you do not want
to marry, all right, finish it.

00:38:40.025 --> 00:38:42.930
You have been given a chance to know
the person, to understand it.

00:38:43.131 --> 00:38:47.105
But afterwards, if you try to be funny,
it’s going to be very difficult

00:38:47.306 --> 00:38:52.590
for you and for me. I may give up having
marriages.

00:38:52.791 --> 00:38:58.666
So I don’t like people to talk of divorce
from the very first day.

00:38:59.459 --> 00:39:02.848
But if there is really a problem,

00:39:03.049 --> 00:39:08.320
it’s all right, in Sahaja Yoga, we have
allowed divorce.

00:39:08.521 --> 00:39:11.457
Not, say, the Catholic Church, they don’t
allow divorce.

00:39:11.658 --> 00:39:15.306
So men have all kinds of relationships
and women have all kinds of relationships.

00:39:15.507 --> 00:39:20.512
That’s not there. Instead of doing this
kind of a nonsense, you can have a divorce.

00:39:20.713 --> 00:39:26.130
But it should be very innocent happening.

00:39:26.331 --> 00:39:30.649
That if you are divorcing a person because
your innocence is challenged,

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:35.258
it’s all right. There, I agree with you
that you should have.

00:39:35.459 --> 00:39:37.652
So preserve your innocence.

00:39:37.853 --> 00:39:43.426
In these modern times, it’s very important
to preserve your innocence,

00:39:43.627 --> 00:39:51.273
that Shri Ganesh should be awakened
within you, and also in other people.

00:39:51.474 --> 00:39:55.216
That is going to save this world.
Nothing else,

00:39:55.417 --> 00:40:00.113
but the innocence that you have,
is going to save the world.

00:40:00.314 --> 00:40:06.020
Whatever you may know, whatever you
may say, whatever you may write,

00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:11.551
please see that you are not hurting
the innocence within you.

00:40:11.752 --> 00:40:17.926
It’s not necessary to lead a life
of morality, this, that.

00:40:18.127 --> 00:40:20.370
What is needed is your innocence.

00:40:20.571 --> 00:40:26.065
Innocence itself gives you moral strength,
moral understanding.

00:40:26.266 --> 00:40:31.213
You don’t have to read books for that,
you don’t have to go to any guru for that.

00:40:31.414 --> 00:40:37.323
Innocence will guide you and tell you
that: “This is what is sahaj,

00:40:37.524 --> 00:40:41.901
this is what you have to have.” You all
have got Realization,

00:40:42.102 --> 00:40:45.225
is a very big thing, that has happened
to so many people.

00:40:45.426 --> 00:40:51.194
And I always want you to worship
Shri Ganesh within you.

00:40:51.395 --> 00:40:55.584
Shri Ganesh is your innocence, it is
the Spirit within you.

00:40:55.785 --> 00:41:00.620
When you want to know your Spirit,
it is Shri Ganesha you become one,

00:41:00.821 --> 00:41:04.116
one with Shri Ganesh. It is within you,

00:41:04.317 --> 00:41:07.549
and is absolutely possible for all of you

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:15.028
to be completely enlightened by the power
of Shri Ganesha.

00:41:15.903 --> 00:41:19.975
I’m very happy that you have accepted
all the marriages,

00:41:20.176 --> 00:41:22.210
and you have decided to marry.

00:41:22.372 --> 00:41:26.155
But, even now, if you say no, it’s better
to finish it off.

00:41:26.356 --> 00:41:29.706
But don’t try any tricks, and don’t try
to be funny,

00:41:29.907 --> 00:41:34.315
because that is not going to help you
in any way to enjoy your marriage.

00:41:34.516 --> 00:41:39.729
From the very first day, try to understand
that you have to be very kind.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:43.702
Kind to your partner, very respectful,

00:41:43.903 --> 00:41:48.373
very caring, very loving. That’s a very
important thing,

00:41:48.574 --> 00:41:52.073
which people don’t understand. And do not
take for granted:

00:41:52.274 --> 00:41:55.373
“It’s alright because it’s a sahaj
marriage”, people take it for granted.

00:41:55.574 --> 00:41:59.057
No, never take it for granted. If you want
to have real joy,

00:41:59.258 --> 00:42:03.713
then have innocent love between yourself
and enjoy yourself.

00:42:03.914 --> 00:42:06.536
May God bless you. Thank you.
