1
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:13,292
This time when - there was no rain, so we went to the sea

2
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:15,000
in Melbourne.

3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:17,626
I told that would be great if we go to Melbourne,

4
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,709
and we went to the sea and

5
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:24,292
I made a Ganesha and they made a Shiva there

6
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:29,167
and they worshipped Me.

7
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:35,792
Do we have some towel for Mother?

8
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,959
For Mother’s hands.

9
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:43,792
So, and they made a

10
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:53,167
Kundalini also there. See, and then they prayed.

11
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,667
And it rained and rained and rained,

12
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:59,959
it poured, you know, poured in buckets, poured in buckets, it was -

13
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,751
- I have never seen such rain before,

14
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,918
like buckets were pouring.

15
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:06,501
And in one day,

16
00:01:06,709 --> 00:01:09,667
four inches of rain in that Sydney can you believe it?

17
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:14,209
And the puja was on inside and outside on My birthday.

18
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:17,209
Buckets and buckets of water.

19
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:20,000
And it was a drought, you know,they were so frightened.

20
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:22,834
Yogi: We heard that the whole tent fell, Mother,

21
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:26,375
because of so much rain. Robert was telling us, Mother.

22
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:29,125
Shri Mataji: And the, you see the

23
00:01:29,334 --> 00:01:31,501
Sahaja Yogis enjoyed it so much,

24
00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:33,042
how they are playing the trick.

25
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,417
And then the river got flooded

26
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:40,083
and it entered into all the pubs and all

27
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,459
and washed off everything, you know, brought it,

28
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:46,792
you see, as if went inside, washed the bottles, everything,

29
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,626
and all the bottles were,

30
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:51,834
some of the empty ones you see, were floating,

31
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,626
these plastic ones were floating

32
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,125
and others sank down.

33
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:57,459
And everything was washed up and was brought in.

34
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:00,584
But only into the pubs there entered.

35
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:04,209
So in the newspaper was that the rain

36
00:02:04,417 --> 00:02:07,667
was tremendous, but the river was very discrete.

37
00:02:10,334 --> 00:02:15,417
And also this fire that broke out before I went to Adelaide.

38
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,417
Adelaide had a very bad fire

39
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:21,626
and what they described it was this -

40
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:24,751
Can you put it there, this one, on top of that, like that?

41
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,751
And they described that the fire

42
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:32,209
was also very discrete

43
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:36,542
and the balls of fire they saw rising on the hills

44
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:40,167
and entering to some houses, avoiding some houses.

45
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:43,459
Some houses were completely burned and some were not.

46
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:47,209
And those people who did not suffer, came to My program said,

47
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,042
"Now we know, why we are saved out of that."

48
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:54,209
And they could see the balls, can you imagine the balls of fire

49
00:02:54,417 --> 00:02:57,250
from somewhere, I mean they don’t know how the balls were formed.

50
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:02,792
And big, big balls like this, you see, were just rolling up the hill.

51
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,209
And they could see, you see, balls rolling up the hill,

52
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:08,959
they are going up, entering into the houses like that.

53
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,542
They just couldn’t understand what happened with the fire.

54
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:16,334
But the best was the washing of the pubs,

55
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:20,959
because normally on the riverside they have all these pubs, you see.

56
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:26,542
And they washed up all these - what you call things used for,

57
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:31,417
these tanning things, you see, they have those mattresses.

58
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:34,459
Sahaja Yogi: Those sun lounges.
Shri Mataji: Sun mattresses and all that.

59
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:39,542
All, everything was washed and brought inside.

60
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:42,375
I really enjoyed it very much.

61
00:03:42,584 --> 00:03:46,209
And Sahaja Yogis were so happy with all that, very happy

62
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:54,918
They asked Me a question: “Why God is angry with us, you see,

63
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,542
here in Adelaide?”

64
00:03:56,751 --> 00:04:00,792
And Adelaide is just like Paris for Australia,

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,417
just like Paris.

66
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:05,918
Very promiscuous, all kinds of dirty things happen there,

67
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,125
all sorts of horrid things take place there.

68
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:12,250
So like Soho it is, you see?

69
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:17,292
So it was Adelaide was chosen by fire - just burnt them out

70
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:23,626
So when I went to see the things, you see, where it had started: All black,

71
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:26,459
– all black things, nothing was there, nothing!

72
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:29,709
No leaves, not a single leave there.

73
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,959
And really it was surprising:

74
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:33,959
This house was burned, that was not burned,

75
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,959
this house was burned, that was not burned.

76
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,542
You could see it so clearly.

77
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:42,209
And where it was burned, it was burned completely!

78
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:46,334
I don't know how they burned even the bricks and everything, you see!

79
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:49,501
absolutely charred black.

80
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,542
It’s very interesting the way

81
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:56,876
sometimes the nature takes its respite.

82
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:00,250
Like when I went once to Guntur, you see,

83
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:04,083
I told these people that "You shouldn’t grow any tobaccos any more."

84
00:05:04,501 --> 00:05:09,834
They were exporting all that tobacco to England, can you imagine?

85
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,709
And they had a- in the house you could find all your English tiles

86
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:22,876
and English - what do you call these old style big showers, you see?

87
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,459
such big, big showers, you see,

88
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:27,083
you stand under them, then the whole thing

89
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,417
that's absolutely - like a torrential rain falls on you. All English.

90
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:33,876
And tubs they had, English tubs, everything in the house.

91
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,209
Exporting that tobacco here you see.

92
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:39,459
So I said, “You shouldn’t do that, you should not have done it!"

93
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,417
So they said, “But you know, Mother,

94
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:43,918
we are giving it to English, not to Indians.”

95
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,334
I said, “Still you should not have done it, it’s wrong.” -

96
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:51,501
I think you are doing the same mistake as I have done, I think. One moment.

97
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:54,042
It's correct, it's correct.

98
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,083
You are better (...)

99
00:05:56,292 --> 00:06:02,250
So, then what happened that,

100
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:05,792
I told, just I told them you shouldn’t grow like this,

101
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,834
it is not good.

102
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:11,459
And whether they are English or Indian, you are committing sins.

103
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,959
You should not do like that, why are you growing this?

104
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:18,250
I said, you can grow very good –

105
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:21,959
what you call? - cotton here, just like Egyptian cotton,

106
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,459
I told them, why do you want to do it?

107
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:27,000
Some people take Me seriously some of them got very angry.

108
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:30,918
When I had gone there about 50 cars came to receive Me.

109
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,626
So, when I was going hardly two or three people came to see Me because

110
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,792
they were angry for that. I said now, I'd warned them,

111
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,334
that if you go about like this the sea is just next door

112
00:06:41,542 --> 00:06:42,709
It will take a respite.

113
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:45,542
It is going to be angry with you, listen to Me!

114
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:48,000
And they were so angry with Me,

115
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:51,000
they didn’t come to see Me off or anything, because I told them.

116
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:54,959
Now what happened, that

117
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,292
that same year there was a typhoon which entered into Guntur.

118
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,209
It had never entered there

119
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:06,167
and all that was devastated,

120
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,751
all their crops were devastated.

121
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:14,542
They can no more grow, no more grow tobacco there.

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,042
And in the meanwhile the government of

123
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:27,584
UK stopped the import of tobacco from that place.

124
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:31,125
So it was doubly hit, you see, doubly hit.

125
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:34,792
But those who started growing the cotton

126
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,209
were perfectly all right.

127
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:41,209
Because all this salty water went into the soil,

128
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:42,792
so now they can’t grow all these things.

129
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,250
And they said, they never had this kind of an experience.

130
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:49,000
After that they came to Delhi and asked Me,

131
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,959
"Mother, You must again come here,

132
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,501
We are sorry for what we have done.”

133
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:55,751
And I said, "Now you see, I didn't do anything, to be very frank”,

134
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,792
I'd never thought of any destruction, but you brought it-

135
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,417
but I told you, that the sea would get angry.

136
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:04,292
But they said: “It happened so quickly, Mother.”

137
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,667
I said: "Not so quick, because

138
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:12,667
at least there were eight months for Me to change your ways.

139
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:15,584
Imagine, just to export those tobaccos to you

140
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:19,125
and get those tubs there.

141
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:22,792
You know they have a kind of a

142
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,417
inferiority complex that

143
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:29,918
if they live like English having tubs and things like that

144
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:33,751
then they become something higher personality.

145
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:37,626
But for that they sell tobacco to English, just imagine!

146
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,751
It’s all showing up now, you will see that

147
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:46,209
everything that I say will be showing up.

148
00:08:46,417 --> 00:08:48,834
I was happy to learn that there has been an-

149
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,417
a program about these horrible diseases,

150
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,918
which are caused by this promiscuous life and all that.

151
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,459
I am very happy. Let people learn now!

152
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,542
They used to make fun of Me and say

153
00:08:58,751 --> 00:09:03,959
that I am Victorian, this, that. Now let them learn what it means.

154
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,417
Now everybody is quite alert.

155
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:13,459
In England, in, you were telling Me I think, she told Me

156
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,292
that in England there are 10,000 people

157
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:19,250
who are suffering from this disease! Can you believe it?

158
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:26,626
10,000 people!

159
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:37,417
And they used to call Me ‘Victorian’.

160
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,876
Gavin has arrived? All right.

161
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:52,459
Just I say that hundred years life we'll see.

162
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,834
Come along.

163
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:59,083
You also giving a puja thing, you know, here.

164
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:03,250
It's all right. You can take that paper out.

165
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:07,125
Now, I think we should spread some other cloth here,

166
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,709
some sort of a

167
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:14,209
old towel or something, or put one of the towels there.

168
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:17,334
so that this proportion is kept clear.

169
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,459
There are some more. Take the -

170
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,459
take the milk.

171
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:34,876
I didn’t give you a silver thali, isn’t it?

172
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:38,250
I must have given it to some other center, I don't know.

173
00:10:40,042 --> 00:10:42,918
From that same shop where they were giving Me, you see,

174
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,667
100% silver I bought, silver for different centers.

175
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:50,167
I don't know who I gave one.

176
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,167
So all of them are here? Has Jane come?

177
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:22,042
Shri Mataji: Has she arrived? No?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, she is here Mother. Where she is.
Sahaja Yogi: She is outside.

178
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,292
All right. Call all of them inside.

179
00:11:25,501 --> 00:11:27,834
You can move forward a little bit I think.

180
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:33,918
But why not spread here something just to - this.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s just coming, Mother. Of course, it’s just coming.

181
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:39,667
(Hindi)

182
00:11:52,417 --> 00:12:00,000
Did you see those lines, energy lines? Just imagine.

183
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,167
Sahaja Yogi: There’s so many of the zodiac signs found here.

184
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:10,042
Shri Mataji: Zodiac lines?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, they found them by energy lines.

185
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:13,417
These are energy lines take to the zodiac?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

186
00:12:13,626 --> 00:12:19,292
Shri Mataji: I didn’t know that. I thought.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s [unclear] and that’s one in this. 

187
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:23,334
So what are the zodiac signs? Which ones are they?

188
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:27,626
Sahaja Yogi: All the twelve signs.
Shri Mataji: All twelve are there - in a circle?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

189
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:37,584
And you discovered these by a magnet?

190
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,083
Sahaja Yogi: I think he's found a lot of it by dowsing.

191
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,501
Shri Mataji: By dowsing?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, just with the…

192
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,167
With that? Or they find it by magnet?

193
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:53,209
Sahaja Yogi: Or they find it also by tracing the old lines of the boundaries.

194
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,792
Shri Mataji: Boundaries of what?
Sahaja Yogi: The waterways

195
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,501
and the boundaries between the current shears.
Shri Mataji: Is it?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

196
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,959
Shri Mataji: But actually, you see, if you take a magnet

197
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:10,375
it will dip at the point, you see. So, if you follow that dipping

198
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:15,626
then it forms a line. That’s the best scientific method.

199
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:19,292
Dowsing also the same thing, it's working with the magnet.

200
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,167
and the magnet, when it -

201
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,626
you see at certain points, the magnetic lines are strong.

202
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:33,083
Thus magnetism is the essence of the Mother Earth, in expression.

203
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:36,876
I mean the fragrance is, but the fragrance has

204
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:40,209
the magnet in it. You see, fragrance comes out of magnet.

205
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:44,125
Now this magnetism of the Mother Earth

206
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:49,918
goes in lines. You see, it doesn't move in - eh -

207
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,792
only at the fragrant point it moves all over.

208
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,542
But otherwise it acts in lines.

209
00:13:56,751 --> 00:14:00,125
And these lines you can find out easily if you use a magnet,

210
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:02,876
you see, a powerful magnet.

211
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,292
Move that magnet on the Mother Earth, you see,

212
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:08,334
you will find that will start dipping down.

213
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,959
You see, you move it and now you find it's not dipping there,

214
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,626
then you move that side and the line travels.

215
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,584
It’s the easiest way because

216
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:19,834
dowsing could be could be bhootish sometimes, could be.

217
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,876
But are you sure it's done with dowsing - they are doing?

218
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:34,751
Sahaja Yogi: No, I think they use a combination of different things.

219
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:43,375
Certainly this, this one who had written the book had been.

220
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:48,959
Shri Mataji: Using dowsing. Sahaja Yogi: Using dowsing as one of the methods.

221
00:14:49,292 --> 00:14:52,167
Shri Mataji: But dowsing can be challenged by science.

222
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,459
Sahaja Yogi: And te one in Glastonbury, Mother, was done by an aerial photograph.

223
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,125
The one in Glastonbury was also discovered by an aerial photograph.

224
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:08,667
Sahaja Yogi: See to the field boundaries, things like that.

225
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:10,584
Shri Mataji: How? They did photographs, how?

226
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:13,667
Sahaja Yogi: They can see that the boundaries of the field made a pattern,

227
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:15,751
things like that.
Shri Mataji: Field?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

228
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,459
It's only old boundaries between the kind of crops.
Shri Mataji: Old ones?

229
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:25,501
Sahaja Yogi: Fields and roads and waters.

230
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:31,876
Shri Mataji: Unconscious must be building up that way.

231
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:36,042
And the old people that lived, were much more sensitive,

232
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,501
much more reactive to unconscious.

233
00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:41,167
They were not so artificial.

234
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,334
But when we become artificial, what happens, we get covered up

235
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,250
with so many barriers that we cannot -

236
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:50,918
we are not sensitive to the dictates of the unconscious.

237
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,209
And when you cannot feel the dictates of the unconscious, you see,

238
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,959
you start having again deliberations as I call it.

239
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:01,792
Deliberations take you out, you see, from that sensitivity.

240
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,083
But if you are natural and a simple person,

241
00:16:05,292 --> 00:16:07,667
then you are quite sensitive to it.

242
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:10,918
You are very sensitive.

243
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,375
Can you can move forward? I think you come forward now.

244
00:16:15,751 --> 00:16:22,667
Just come forward.

245
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,292
Come forward, you can.

246
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:36,792
Esther you come. Actually new people should be in front,

247
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,250
those who are from Brighton.

248
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,626
Would be better, I think.

249
00:17:36,834 --> 00:17:38,042
Come forward.

250
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:43,834
The Brighton should, Brighton people should come forward I would say as much as you can.

251
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,918
Gavin, you come this side, I think would be much better.

252
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:50,542
because you have [unclear]

253
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,584
Come along, sit down, sit down, sit down!

254
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:16,542
Is that dirty [unclear]. You can keep on it that side, I think.

255
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:26,751
Who else is there?

256
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,250
Is somebody still outside?

257
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,667
Nick, if you can.

258
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:55,125
So this, on the other side of Nick also some people can be seated.

259
00:18:58,209 --> 00:19:01,584
It’s a very nice sunny day today, isn’t it?

260
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,042
Sahaja Yogi: Would You like this window open slightly, Mother?
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon...

261
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,542
Sahaja Yogi: Would You like the window slightly open, Mother?

262
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:11,542
Shri Mataji: As you please. I think that one if you open, it’s a better idea.

263
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:13,918
Sahaja Yogi: It's open, Mother. Shri Mataji: It's open, it's o.k. so.

264
00:19:56,667 --> 00:20:00,667
Today is a great day to come to Brighton,

265
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:07,167
because it’s the day of Buddha’s birthday.

266
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:10,959
Today is Buddha's birthday, Lord Buddha's birthday.

267
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:17,501
We all have heard about His birth

268
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:23,334
and that His mother dreamt of an elephant,

269
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:29,959
of a large white elephant before the birth of Buddha.

270
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:35,834
And then it was predicted

271
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,125
that a child will be born in your family

272
00:20:40,751 --> 00:20:45,751
who will be either a great saint

273
00:20:46,501 --> 00:20:50,125
or a very great King,

274
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:54,125
as in Sanskrit called ‘chakravarti' - means the one who

275
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:58,709
is the ruler of the whole world.

276
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:04,167
So the father got worried,

277
00:21:05,209 --> 00:21:12,209
and he thought he must get the son involved into the family life,

278
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:14,709
into material life

279
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,709
and give Him all the pleasures of life.

280
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:24,459
So he built a very special place for Him,

281
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:27,375
a beautiful palace to live in.

282
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:36,334
And where he got Him married to a girl called Yashodhara,

283
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,959
was a very, very beautiful woman,

284
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:41,918
gave HIm all the pleasures of life,

285
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:49,918
everything that he could do to entice this boy away from asceticism.

286
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,959
Also you know the story of His going

287
00:21:57,167 --> 00:22:03,667
one day on the road, how He found three types of people,

288
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:10,167
and how He felt that ‘Why a person should become old?'

289
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,959
‘Why should a person suffer in life?

290
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:17,501
and ‘Why should people die?’.

291
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:25,542
So all these three things put an enquiry into Himself

292
00:22:25,876 --> 00:22:29,584
and He started trying to understand

293
00:22:29,792 --> 00:22:32,959
why these things happen to human beings.

294
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:35,542
With this the enquiry started.

295
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:42,167
So He reached a point where

296
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:49,501
He could not bear any more the comforts and the, all the attachments

297
00:22:49,709 --> 00:22:52,834
that were entangled around him by His father.

298
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:56,584
He had a son whose name was Rahul;

299
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:04,501
and He left the son and the wife in the search of the truth.

300
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:12,542
Now, He started from a wrong end, I should say,

301
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:15,876
for the search of the truth because

302
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:20,292
He wanted to know, why there are miseries in the human beings.

303
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:27,959
And so He started from collective towards the center.

304
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:30,584
When we see miseries all around us,

305
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:33,459
many people I have seen, they say: “What about others?

306
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,501
Will everybody get realization?

307
00:23:35,709 --> 00:23:37,751
Will everybody will have this, you see?

308
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:43,250
This comes from the wrong end I feel because

309
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:48,584
first of all we must know, are we all right?

310
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:53,959
Have we - are we perfect?

311
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:57,000
Are we full of joy?

312
00:23:57,209 --> 00:24:02,959
Have we received the absolute knowledge?

313
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:07,792
If you start from this point, it’s always better.

314
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:11,083
Because He started from the wrong point,

315
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:14,125
searching it from the collective

316
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:16,667
to remove the miseries of the people

317
00:24:16,876 --> 00:24:20,125
He had to go in a very round about way.

318
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:24,792
So He read all the books and Vedas and this,

319
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:27,792
He went to big pundits,

320
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:34,667
to all the great knowledgeable people to meet them,

321
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:41,459
to ask them the answer, “Why there are these three things?”

322
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:48,959
that is the ‘roga’, is the

323
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:56,083
health or miserable physical body,

324
00:24:56,626 --> 00:25:01,792
then the death and the old age.

325
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,751
He went and asked so many people

326
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:10,042
And they said: “You have to die because your are born."

327
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,834
And then they said that you have to

328
00:25:14,042 --> 00:25:19,125
become old because you are born like that

329
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:21,876
and you have to suffer

330
00:25:22,209 --> 00:25:24,334
because you commit sins.

331
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:27,459
He was not satisfied with this answer.

332
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:32,542
So He went on searching and searching and searching.

333
00:25:32,876 --> 00:25:36,459
Then He got tired, absolutely fed up.

334
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:42,792
Then He went to a place called Gaya, very near

335
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:47,042
Patna it is, I've seen the place and the tree.

336
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:55,375
And He sat under a banyan tree where He slept off,

337
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:59,459
because He got so tired of His seeking.

338
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:02,709
And after the sleep He got up

339
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:06,792
and suddenly He got His Realization.

340
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:11,459
And He thought the whole drama is over.

341
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:16,709
Now His Mother Herself was Adishakti, who gave Him the birth

342
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:19,667
and She died just after the birth of the child.

343
00:26:19,876 --> 00:26:25,042
And He got His Realization.

344
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,459
Now at that time when He got His Realization

345
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:33,626
there was nobody to tell Him what it is,

346
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:37,626
that what it means Realization is.

347
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,000
Nobody to decode

348
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:45,125
or talk about anything that was to be understood by Him.

349
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:49,459
But because of His tremendous seeking

350
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:54,209
and such ardent desire

351
00:26:54,626 --> 00:27:00,626
that the shuddha iccha, the Kundalini itself rose,

352
00:27:00,834 --> 00:27:02,876
but of course the Adishakti blessed Him

353
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:07,083
and He got His Realization under the banyan tree.

354
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:13,876
Now any incarnation, which came on this Earth

355
00:27:14,083 --> 00:27:19,834
had to 'samayachara' - according to the time,

356
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:24,292
the need of the time had to act firstly,

357
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:31,250
secondly the need of the

358
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:34,125
incarnation to come on this earth

359
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:38,751
was first created in the human beings.

360
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:43,918
So supposing at a time when there was too much of ritualism,

361
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:48,000
Brahmanism or priesthood

362
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:52,834
and people were trying to take everything

363
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:58,000
onto those artificial rituals and all that,

364
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:05,375
an incarnation had to come on this earth to correct those ideas.

365
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:09,876
Like Krishna came at a time when He said, “This is all leela",

366
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:12,083
the puja and everything He canceled.

367
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,584
Nothing doing, no puja nothing,

368
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:18,250
you just have raas, enjoy yourself.

369
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:20,501
It's all a joke going on, you see.

370
00:28:20,709 --> 00:28:26,417
So He brought that concept at that time in the awareness of people

371
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:29,375
that the whole world is a leela,

372
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:34,000
is a play of God's own whims.

373
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:35,959
So you just enjoy it.

374
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:42,959
And that's how He created this wonderful festival of Holi,

375
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,876
which we had

376
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:49,459
in Delhi. I don’t know- anyone of you was there for the Holi? No.

377
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:50,417
You were there?

378
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:52,751
Sahaja Yogi: Two years back.

379
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:55,334
Shri Mataji: No, but this time you were not there.All right.

380
00:28:55,542 --> 00:28:58,834
You might get the pictures of that. All right.

381
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:02,751
So in the same way when Buddha came in

382
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:05,834
first problem was that

383
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:10,167
He thought that it's better not to talk about God.

384
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:13,751
Because in His search everybody told Him

385
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:17,834
the answer was, “Oh it’s God who does it.

386
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:22,292
He punishes you. It’s God who gives you this old age.

387
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:25,000
It’s God who does it.“ But what is this God after all?

388
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:27,292
Why does He do it?” They said, “You better ask the God."

389
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:30,292
“Where is the God?”

390
00:29:30,501 --> 00:29:35,083
So everybody put every blame on God, as usual.

391
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:39,334
Even that’s done today, nothing so, so new

392
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:42,792
and nothing unusual I should say.

393
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:46,209
So this must be done by God, you see.

394
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:47,751
If you cut your throat:

395
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:53,000
‘God put my knife in my hand and He cut my throat’.

396
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:57,375
So you see, He thought better not talk of God.

397
00:29:57,626 --> 00:30:00,709
Because everybody is going towards God.

398
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:03,542
Then the people whom He met they said,

399
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:06,292
“Now I have become God.” He said, “How?”

400
00:30:06,501 --> 00:30:09,042
He said: "I am God now.” “For what? Why?”

401
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,209
Because he could mesmerize people,

402
00:30:11,417 --> 00:30:15,375
he said: “I have become God.” Just imagine!

403
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:18,959
So He thought that it’s very dangerous to talk of God

404
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:22,209
because people take God in the hand and use it

405
00:30:22,417 --> 00:30:23,959
for their own purpose,

406
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:28,626
always say, “Oh this is what the God has to do

407
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,375
and it’s God has

408
00:30:30,584 --> 00:30:33,000
done it and I’m in connection with God and I’ll tell God.”

409
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:37,125
So He got a fright and He said that, “Better not talk about God.

410
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:40,876
Because that puts the attention of the people on ritualism,

411
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:44,667
artificial things, they are building temples after temples,

412
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,250
and just doing all these horrible things

413
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:53,375
which one should not do. Like if you go to the south you’ll find

414
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:57,167
in the temples they shave their heads of the ladies,

415
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,751
they shave it completely.

416
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,626
And they have to -

417
00:31:01,834 --> 00:31:05,417
it’s all cobbled along the sides of the wall,

418
00:31:05,626 --> 00:31:08,042
some walls of the temple.

419
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:11,042
And the ladies who shaved their heads

420
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:14,584
are just rolling along the sides, you see.

421
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:19,167
They have to do sometimes 1008 times, rolling - imagine,

422
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:21,834
and the water is poured on them.

423
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:25,501
God knows what is the ritual, from where it has come!

424
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:28,792
So the poor women go on rolling, rolling, rolling like that

425
00:31:28,959 --> 00:31:31,334
and somebody is pouring water on them all the time,

426
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:32,876
buckets after buckets.

427
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:36,584
Her husband and her brother and all they’re doing one after another,

428
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,167
you see one is finished then another one.

429
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,083
Poor ladies rolling like that,

430
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:45,959
on that muddy sort of a cobbled area.

431
00:31:46,417 --> 00:31:49,042
I mean, I was shocked when I saw this.  I said: “What’s this?”

432
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,501
And then later on you see they became modern,

433
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:56,626
so they started selling the hair, you see, abroad,

434
00:31:56,834 --> 00:32:00,751
so the whole thing became a big industry in Madras, you see,

435
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:05,292
the hair was made into this bouffant and all they call it, here,

436
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:09,375
and they sent it to England and other places.

437
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:14,501
So it’s, I mean, in the name of God ridiculous things were done,

438
00:32:14,709 --> 00:32:17,000
ridiculous things were done!

439
00:32:17,209 --> 00:32:19,209
So He just thought: Better not talk about God.

440
00:32:19,417 --> 00:32:22,626
The first step is Self-Realization.

441
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:25,000
He was a great Sahaja Yogi I must say.

442
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,959
Because He said nothing doing, don't talk about God or anything,

443
00:32:28,167 --> 00:32:30,709
first you get your Realization.

444
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:34,334
That was the first condition, establish it.

445
00:32:34,542 --> 00:32:37,626
Unless and until you have established your Realization,

446
00:32:37,834 --> 00:32:38,792
- nothing doing.

447
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:46,417
So He just started His own method of propagating Buddhi

448
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:49,751
Buddha's knowledge or you can Buddhism you can say as they call it.

449
00:32:49,959 --> 00:32:51,834
Of course it became ‘ism’ later on.

450
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,334
So all that He started

451
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:58,792
with the idea that people should first become Buddha.

452
00:32:58,959 --> 00:33:03,501
Buddha means realized, Buddha is ‘to know’.

453
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:07,250
So "Buddha" means the person who has known,

454
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:10,584
means the one who is a Realized soul.

455
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:14,626
So what He says, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

456
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:18,000
I bow, no I surrender – ‘sharanam’ means surrender,

457
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:24,542
I surrender to the Buddhas - means to all the Sahaja Yogis.

458
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,501
You are all Buddhas because you know.

459
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:32,375
When you know, you are the Buddha.

460
00:33:32,876 --> 00:33:36,209
Now without going into all that nonsense

461
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:41,167
of renunciation and shaving your head and wearing that dress

462
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,834
and everything, you have achieved your Realization.

463
00:33:44,042 --> 00:33:47,709
It’s a short circuit or a short path.

464
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:51,792
Why? Because He started from the other side.

465
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:57,792
But if He had started directly from Himself, you see,

466
00:33:58,626 --> 00:34:00,083
it would have been better.

467
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:04,751
You see, in practical sense I'll tell you how it is.

468
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:11,959
Supposing you want to repair your house.

469
00:34:12,292 --> 00:34:15,959
So you have to have instrument for that house.

470
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:20,042
But supposing you are worried about all the houses of the world.

471
00:34:20,417 --> 00:34:25,417
and you start repairing, neither you'll repair other houses nor yours.

472
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:29,292
So first you must practice on yourself.

473
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:33,792
Put your attention to yourself first.

474
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:38,959
Is also is a method by which you avoid

475
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:41,042
seeing the point,

476
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,667
seeing the reality,

477
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:48,167
that, if you are not all right, how can you improve the whole world?

478
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:52,000
So when your attention goes to other things, are

479
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:55,042
you must know that there’s something wrong with you first of all,

480
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,667
which must be corrected.

481
00:34:57,876 --> 00:34:59,083
And that’s why

482
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:02,292
it took Him so much time to go round and round and round.

483
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:05,209
He had to give up His wife, give up His family,

484
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:08,542
give up everything and get to Realization.

485
00:35:08,918 --> 00:35:11,417
Because by giving up everything He realized

486
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:14,375
that it is He, who should achieve it.

487
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:17,417
It's a very circuitous way,

488
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:19,709
but you can just say: It doesn't exist anything,

489
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:23,334
first let me get all right - that’s Sahaja Yoga.

490
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:28,918
Now what happened, that became a method for people to achieve God.

491
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:34,375
Many people think that you must suffer like Christ to achieve God.

492
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:39,209
You must renounce the world then achieve God.

493
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:43,751
Actually renouncing the world and all that is just a myth.

494
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:46,459
How do you renounce the world?

495
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:48,459
It’s myth. What are you renouncing?

496
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:51,375
I mean in any case, you can’t carry this with you, can you?

497
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:55,792
I mean, can you even carry, I would say, even a thread?

498
00:35:55,959 --> 00:35:59,375
Nothing! When you come you come like this, you are born

499
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:02,709
with closed fists. When you go, the hands are like this open.

500
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:05,250
Have you ever seen a dead corpse?

501
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:07,792
He always has his hands like this. Nothing can he take,

502
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:11,167
just going like this.

503
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,792
So you don't take anything from here.

504
00:36:13,959 --> 00:36:17,209
So this renouncing, this ‘I renounce that’, ‘I renounce that"

505
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:21,876
'I’ll give up this’, ‘I’ll give up my wife’, ‘I’ll give up that",

506
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,918
has no meaning.

507
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:28,626
Because it’s a state of mind in which your

508
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,834
being becomes -

509
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,876
I don't know the English word for that

510
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:40,167
which doesn't stick to something, what is it called?

511
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:48,918
I don't know. You see, any substance that doesn't stick to anything.

512
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,792
I mean we have all kind of stick plast. Yogi: Unattached?

513
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:55,584
Shri Mataji: No, but that quality.

514
00:36:55,792 --> 00:37:01,334
There is a quality of the temperament, which doesn't stick to anything.

515
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:05,792
Doesn't stick to anything, I mean you put it here, it will come out.

516
00:37:06,083 --> 00:37:10,417
You can say the soap or something like that –

517
00:37:10,626 --> 00:37:13,584
Yogi: Like mercury. Mother, like mercury, just flows.

518
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:15,959
Shri Mataji: Ah - like mercury.

519
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,834
But mercury also you can apply sometimes,

520
00:37:19,042 --> 00:37:22,042
you know with heat and, but this is something beyond mercury,

521
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,667
is absolute, which doesn't stick to anything, you see.

522
00:37:26,876 --> 00:37:28,459
You just become like that.

523
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:32,918
All you do, wear this, you wear that, you have this, all right.
524
00:37:35,584 --> 00:37:32,918
Then name of the Goddess is ‘Nirmama’, ‘Nirmama’,

524
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,334
You are never stuck.

525
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:43,667
that for Her nothing is Her own, you see,

526
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:46,209
see, She doesn't stick to anything.

527
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:49,959
She is in everything, but She doesn't stick to anything.

528
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:52,709
For example now see the light here,

529
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:58,501
it’s not sticking to anything, it exists by itself.

530
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:00,918
It doesn’t stick to anything.

531
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,959
This is the nearest you can say, it doesn't stick to anything.

532
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:08,667
Any but thing tries to stick it gets burned, that’s a good idea.

533
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,542
So this is what it is,

534
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:18,000
this is called an enlightened person doesn't stick to anything.

535
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:23,167
And whatever tries to come very close gets burnt off.

536
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:29,042
So, such a person is not attached to anything.

537
00:38:29,292 --> 00:38:32,042
But that’s not a mental thing that you can do

538
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,792
that, “Oh I am not attached to you”, you see.

539
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:37,167
It’s very common in this country especially, “I hate you”.

540
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:39,918
Then you can't hate anyone. How can you?

541
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:42,209
And nor can you love anyone because

542
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:48,375
the attachment cannot give you both the qualities.

543
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:52,501
You see, because you are attached to someone,

544
00:38:52,709 --> 00:38:56,959
you say that you hate, simultaneously you are loving that person.

545
00:38:57,167 --> 00:39:02,250
Because these are the dual qualities of attachment, see?

546
00:39:02,501 --> 00:39:05,834
So once you have attachment you have both things.

547
00:39:06,042 --> 00:39:08,709
One moment you hate, another moment you love,

548
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,209
another moment you hate,

549
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,751
then you love and you don't know what's the matter with yourself.

550
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:17,584
But the thing is the quality of the mind is such that

551
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:22,584
it is either getting attached mentally

552
00:39:22,792 --> 00:39:26,083
or either getting detached mentally.

553
00:39:26,667 --> 00:39:32,501
But actually anybody say, you love someone very much.

554
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:36,792
Now you don't even die together, whatever you may try.

555
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,584
You cannot die together.

556
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:41,751
One person has to die earlier, another has to die later.

557
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:46,709
So the answer to His question that He asked was,

558
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:48,959
“Why all these things are caused?”

559
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:54,542
So he said, it is because of desire.

560
00:39:54,876 --> 00:39:59,792
Because of human desire, these are all problems are caused,

561
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:06,792
like the death, like the old age

562
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,918
or the sickness, are caused by desire.

563
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:15,083
Now see in Sahaja Yoga language how we should understand Him.

564
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:21,042
Is the desire, as you know, is the left side.

565
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:26,792
Left side gives you death.

566
00:40:26,959 --> 00:40:31,501
When the left side is very much used

567
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:35,667
you get to death, ultimately when it is exhausted.

568
00:40:35,918 --> 00:40:40,709
When the left side is out, desire,

569
00:40:40,918 --> 00:40:44,417
you also get sickness.

570
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:52,876
And when the left side is used too much you get your old age.

571
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:58,918
Of course the right side is the one which does it,

572
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:02,125
but the left side is the originator.

573
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,709
If you have no desire you won't go into the right side.

574
00:41:05,918 --> 00:41:10,459
First is the desire, the starting point is the desire.

575
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:14,167
He reached the point all right, but He didn't clearly say

576
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:17,918
what desire means: Desire means the left side.

577
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:24,667
When we have the pure desire, which is the Kundalini,

578
00:41:24,918 --> 00:41:28,417
then all these things are neutralized.

579
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:34,042
When the Kundalini rises the pure desire, the real desire,

580
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,042
the only desire, it gives you the absolute

581
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,751
by which you don't get old,

582
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:45,584
you don’t die and you do not get sick.

583
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:52,292
Because you achieve that which is eternal, it does not die.

584
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:54,000
You become the Spirit.

585
00:41:54,209 --> 00:41:56,584
When you want to die, you die.

586
00:41:56,834 --> 00:42:00,375
When you want to be reborn, you are reborn, and

587
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:06,584
you have that realized temperament within you. It does not die.

588
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:09,334
That's what you take with you.

589
00:42:09,584 --> 00:42:15,959
Now you take your Realization with you when you die.

590
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:19,209
So what He tried to say was to build up

591
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:22,584
that we should not have any desires.

592
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:27,209
Now because, you see, His passage was like that, He went from

593
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:30,834
one to another, giving up this desire, that desire, that desire,

594
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:34,959
that desire - ultimately He came to Kundalini.

595
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:39,083
There’s a saying, “Ya neti neti vachanair nigama avocham”

596
00:42:39,292 --> 00:42:40,292
When you go on saying:

597
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:43,334
'Not this, not this, not this, not this, not this',

598
00:42:43,709 --> 00:42:46,125
then you go to a point, when you say “Then

599
00:42:46,584 --> 00:42:51,417
what ultimately left is the desire, which is the pure desire,

600
00:42:51,626 --> 00:42:54,000
the desire, that is the Kundalini.

601
00:42:54,334 --> 00:42:55,792
Say for example

602
00:42:55,959 --> 00:42:58,334
you say, “I’ll have a house -  no, no, I’ll not have a house,

603
00:42:58,542 --> 00:42:59,792
I’ll have a car, no, no car,no,

604
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:03,459
I’ll not have a wife, I’ll not look at any woman.

605
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,292
I’ll have nothing to do with it.

606
00:43:05,501 --> 00:43:09,292
I'll give up this, give up that, give up that, give up that.

607
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:15,250
Till you reach a point where you are at an absolute point.

608
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,125
And there you realize that the Kundalini rises.

609
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:19,584
But I think it is going too far.

610
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,584
Why not start from the Kundalini rising? There.

611
00:43:24,918 --> 00:43:26,000
Is a simple thing.

612
00:43:26,209 --> 00:43:29,334
So Sahaja Yoga is the other way round stuff,

613
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:31,876
is that you better start from the Kundalini.

614
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:35,501
and neutralize all your left side.

615
00:43:36,709 --> 00:43:37,834
You see the point now?

616
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:42,501
That's why Buddha was always regarded as an atheist.

617
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:45,501
He was not. He was not an atheist.

618
00:43:45,709 --> 00:43:48,542
But as a matter of policy,

619
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:52,501
He and Mahavira -they were contemporary -

620
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:59,167
they decided: Let's not have the name of God anywhere near,

621
00:43:59,542 --> 00:44:01,959
because once you start the god business,

622
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:07,501
big philosophies are built and people just start claiming it.

623
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:09,292
I mean, they become that!

624
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:14,459
Actually anybody who reads Geeta becomes a sort of a Krishna,

625
00:44:14,709 --> 00:44:16,459
Shri Krishna Himself, it’s the way he talks,

626
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:19,667
people - you can be shocked the way they talk I mean

627
00:44:19,876 --> 00:44:22,751
they are Shri Krishna, giving an advice to Arjuna, you know,

628
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:24,709
sitting on a chariot.

629
00:44:24,918 --> 00:44:28,042
They behave in that manner, you know their style is like that.

630
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:31,250
I met one fellow called Chinmayanand

631
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:34,834
and I was amazed you know the way he was talking,  I was surprised,

632
00:44:35,042 --> 00:44:37,334
I mean he was just behaving like Shri Krishna,

633
00:44:37,542 --> 00:44:39,083
of course horrid looking,

634
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:43,792
but, he thought he was Shri Krishna himself, you see.

635
00:44:43,959 --> 00:44:46,834
So that's what identification takes place with human beings

636
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:49,751
when they start talking about God or His ways and others.

637
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:51,792
So He said: "All right put that out,

638
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:55,292
just talk about Self-Realization. That's the first step."

639
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:59,751
And Mahavira joined hands with Him.

640
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,459
It helped that time very much,

641
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:06,626
to all the people who were in the name of ritualism you see,

642
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:09,000
they would say, “It’s very difficult, you know,

643
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:12,417
Hinduism is the most difficult thing."

644
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:17,250
You have to fast on Sunday, because of the sun,

645
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:20,083
Monday because of the moon,

646
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:24,000
Tuesday because of the Mars. Like that went on and on,

647
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:28,209
and when do you eat your food?

648
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:32,292
If you have to achieve God then you have to

649
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:36,375
take your bath at four o’clock and do this and do that and

650
00:45:36,709 --> 00:45:40,000
shave your head and then you become a sanyasi,

651
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,417
and you can't eat this and you can't eat that,

652
00:45:43,626 --> 00:45:47,459
and you can't do that - all those things ritualistic they started.

653
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:51,792
But He felt that supposing if you take to sanyasa,

654
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:55,459
so half of your desires are finished, you are a sanyasi,

655
00:45:55,667 --> 00:45:58,542
you are doing God's work

656
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:01,375
and there is no need to have a family or anything,

657
00:46:01,584 --> 00:46:03,501
so half of your desires are finished.

658
00:46:03,709 --> 00:46:06,626
If you have a family then you want to do something for the family,

659
00:46:06,834 --> 00:46:10,125
you have to look after your family and all that is to be done.

660
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:15,751
But He did not realize that He was a Realized soul, others were not.

661
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:21,792
You see, if a realized soul does that, it has no difference to him;

662
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:23,542
whether he has a family or no family

663
00:46:23,751 --> 00:46:25,083
makes no difference to a realized soul,

664
00:46:25,292 --> 00:46:26,584
because he is not attached.

665
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:31,417
But to a person who is not a realized soul,

666
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:34,834
supposing he’ll give up his car, he’ll give up his house,

667
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,709
go to the Himalayas.

668
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:37,918
There, what he’ll do?

669
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:44,584
He’ll have a hut and have a barbed thing around or so.

670
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:48,542
Then he may think of a Georgian style of a house

671
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:51,792
if he's an English man,

672
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,125
because according to them Georgian style is unpretentious,

673
00:46:56,334 --> 00:46:59,918
so we can have, after all we are sanyasis!

674
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,334
That’s typical!

675
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:07,083
I tell you all our western mind is behaving in that way, if you see,

676
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:10,250
that we should be unpretentious, you see, it’s very fussy,

677
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:11,584
is the word they will use.

678
00:47:11,792 --> 00:47:15,000
If you put even a little [thing]: "Oh it’s very fussy."

679
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:18,959
They want everything to be plain, blunt, you see?

680
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:24,709
But what about inside? I’s filled with what?

681
00:47:24,918 --> 00:47:29,250
All bottled up with all kinds of rums, this, that.

682
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:34,083
But the outside should be absolutely blunt, you know.

683
00:47:34,292 --> 00:47:36,083
The food should not be,

684
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:39,375
if possible just get it in its natural form.

685
00:47:39,584 --> 00:47:42,792
If not, don’t have any taste in it.

686
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,876
It should be so blunt that

687
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:48,584
any guest who comes to your house must starve, you see.

688
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:53,334
All these funny ideas cropped up in that - of asceticism.

689
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:55,792
Then we have other people like Shamballas.

690
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:58,375
who are going now to Gobi desert.

691
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,250
You see, they thought that this desert is not sufficient,

692
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:02,667
let’s go to Gobi desert.

693
00:48:02,876 --> 00:48:04,667
So they are going now to Gobi desert.

694
00:48:04,876 --> 00:48:07,209
All these absurd ideas

695
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:11,918
came out of Buddhism, and also Jainism.

696
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:15,459
Jainis went to the other extreme in vegetarianism,

697
00:48:15,834 --> 00:48:20,542
because Buddha Himself was not a vegetarian, do you know that?

698
00:48:20,751 --> 00:48:25,584
He was not Himself a vegetarian, nor was Mahavira.

699
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:32,000
You will be surprised: Vegetarianism for them was a philosophy.

700
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:39,083
It was not a sort of a thing where you don't eat meat and all,

701
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:44,375
because Buddha Himself died when He went to one of His disciples

702
00:48:44,584 --> 00:48:52,584
who was a ‘shikari’ – hunter.

703
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:56,959
And the hunter had killed a wild boar.

704
00:48:57,167 --> 00:49:00,834
And he said that the wild boar has been killed just now

705
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:06,918
and it will take some time to cook, it’s rather half done, you see.

706
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:10,792
I mean, He beeing an Indian, He could not eat that half done thing

707
00:49:10,959 --> 00:49:17,375
and He got diseased of, I think, this liver or something got

708
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:20,334
into problem and He died of that, you see.

709
00:49:20,584 --> 00:49:23,250
I mean, I can't eat half done food Myself.

710
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:26,209
"This is half done now." Half done is a horrible stuff,

711
00:49:26,417 --> 00:49:28,626
but we eat because it is unpretentious, you see

712
00:49:28,959 --> 00:49:30,125
or some sort of a thing.

713
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:35,125
People have idea it’s not, it’s very next to the nature, you see.

714
00:49:35,334 --> 00:49:38,584
This is what is coming. But it’s all deliberate.

715
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:40,834
You are attached inside.

716
00:49:41,042 --> 00:49:44,667
Outside, if you behave like that you are not going to become that.

717
00:49:44,876 --> 00:49:50,334
Like Hippies have an idea, if they live like primitive people,

718
00:49:50,542 --> 00:49:54,792
then they become primitive. You cannot, your brain is modern.

719
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:58,083
Just by living, you see, wearing a wig like a hippy,

720
00:49:58,292 --> 00:49:59,751
can I become primitive?

721
00:49:59,959 --> 00:50:02,334
I cannot, My brain is modern, you see?

722
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:06,667
That’s what people don't understand, that we are too deliberate.

723
00:50:06,876 --> 00:50:09,959
And all these deliberations can be only reduced

724
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:14,542
if your Self comes into your attention.

725
00:50:14,751 --> 00:50:19,626
Otherwise all these are just our mental projections.

726
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:24,626
So all these sanyasa and all these ideas came gradually,

727
00:50:24,834 --> 00:50:27,375
everyone who came on this Earth,

728
00:50:27,584 --> 00:50:31,167
people have really made a mess out of them.

729
00:50:31,375 --> 00:50:35,042
And Buddha's mess has gone to such an extent

730
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:38,667
that if you see that you’ll be shocked.

731
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:41,959
It went into many formations.

732
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:44,042
But I heard from My son-in-law that

733
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,459
he went and visited some of the caves

734
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:50,083
where the very early Buddhist lived, very early Buddhist lived.

735
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:53,959
In the caves, because they were not supported by kings or anything,

736
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:56,125
so they had a very bad time.

737
00:50:56,334 --> 00:50:58,083
And they used to live in the caves.

738
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:03,584
And what My son-in-law told Me that in the caves there are writings

739
00:51:03,834 --> 00:51:08,417
in Sanskrit, in Pali and in Indian script,

740
00:51:08,667 --> 00:51:12,209
saying that it is the spontaneous happening

741
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:15,959
that can bring forth the Self-Realization.

742
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:20,334
He has got that photographed.

743
00:51:20,667 --> 00:51:24,125
So it’s coming forward. You see, so they knew about it,

744
00:51:24,334 --> 00:51:27,501
the Sahaja Yoga, they knew about it.

745
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,751
But then as every religion has gone into a mess

746
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:36,751
and lot of funny sort of, we can say the -

747
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:42,459
funny sort of expressions, also Buddhism has gone,

748
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:46,709
it became Mahayan, Hinayan, all sorts of things.

749
00:51:46,918 --> 00:51:52,250
But one of them was called as Vidhitama,

750
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:56,167
who ran away from India, settled down in Japan

751
00:51:56,459 --> 00:51:59,459
and he started the Zen system of religion,

752
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:02,417
which he kept to the spontaneous happening.

753
00:52:02,626 --> 00:52:05,209
That one was preserved.

754
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:11,125
Another was the Lao Tse style, who did not talk of God

755
00:52:11,334 --> 00:52:14,667
and of Buddha, but of Tao itself -

756
00:52:14,876 --> 00:52:19,083
the energy or we can say about the Adishakti.

757
00:52:19,292 --> 00:52:22,459
So these two good things came out of Him.

758
00:52:22,667 --> 00:52:27,792
While they searched back into the history of China

759
00:52:27,959 --> 00:52:30,501
and they found out the Adishakti

760
00:52:30,709 --> 00:52:34,667
lived many years back there as Kuan Yin.

761
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:38,834
And that’s how Kuan Yin was established

762
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:42,751
as a Goddess for many Buddhists.

763
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:47,417
Now then Buddha also got

764
00:52:47,626 --> 00:52:50,709
into another form because

765
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:53,792
there was a big competition between Hinduism,

766
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,209
Hindus of those days and the Buddhists.

767
00:52:58,417 --> 00:53:00,209
So they wanted to form,

768
00:53:00,417 --> 00:53:03,959
for ordinary people it’s very difficult to understand the philosophy

769
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:08,375
so they thought that we should have Buddha expressed

770
00:53:08,584 --> 00:53:12,125
as He has been and He will be.

771
00:53:12,375 --> 00:53:18,125
So they formed their, you see, as you see He is a Matreya

772
00:53:18,334 --> 00:53:20,918
is going to come, the future Buddha is Bodhisatva

773
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,751
and they started making His statues and everything.

774
00:53:23,959 --> 00:53:26,584
So they made Buddha as the God.

775
00:53:26,834 --> 00:53:32,876
They started using Him to represent the Divine Power,

776
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:36,334
giving Him forms and things and like hat many things happened.

777
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:39,959
But Buddha Himself was so much frightened of the ritualism

778
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:43,292
that He said, “You should not worship anything,

779
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:45,834
you should not build any temples

780
00:53:46,125 --> 00:53:48,083
so you see the loophole was found out,

781
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:51,542
if temples are not to be built, we’ll build stupas.

782
00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:57,250
Now in the Stupas they put the tooth of Buddha,

783
00:53:57,459 --> 00:54:00,083
of course that was sensible to do I must say,

784
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:02,542
but of course Buddha had said not to do it.

785
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,959
And they put it there, He had two disciples,

786
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,501
called as Sariputta and Moggallana.

787
00:54:07,709 --> 00:54:10,042
They were very good disciples of His

788
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,792
and their bones were collected after they were burnt out

789
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:17,542
and were put in the stupa.

790
00:54:17,751 --> 00:54:20,834
That was something definitely sensible to put them there.

791
00:54:21,042 --> 00:54:23,876
Of course the bones and all these things should not be disturbed

792
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,834
because it’s not good, it creates a problem for the body.

793
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:31,584
But at least if they have put it there in the Mother Earth

794
00:54:31,792 --> 00:54:34,792
it would have been all right. but they put it in caskets.

795
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:37,959
Now the first casket was made of gold,

796
00:54:38,167 --> 00:54:42,584
the second of silver, the third of iron,

797
00:54:42,792 --> 00:54:46,709
the fourth one of wood sort of a thing, mummified those things.

798
00:54:46,959 --> 00:54:49,209
That was a very wrong thing to do, because

799
00:54:49,417 --> 00:54:51,626
because if you go on keeping like that,

800
00:54:51,834 --> 00:54:53,792
some parts of the body of these great people,

801
00:54:54,083 --> 00:55:01,417
it can hamper their rebirth or their body

802
00:55:01,626 --> 00:55:04,334
which they want to again incarnate, you see.

803
00:55:04,542 --> 00:55:06,959
But hair is all right or nails are all right,

804
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:10,083
but you shouldn’t keep the part of dead body like that.

805
00:55:10,292 --> 00:55:15,167
And this kind of thing gave another nonsensical ideas to

806
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:17,375
to horrible human beeings.

807
00:55:17,709 --> 00:55:22,250
What they did, that they thought that if we have to keep some part

808
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:25,667
of the person who died like divine person,

809
00:55:25,876 --> 00:55:29,626
why not we cut the hand of someone and like that.

810
00:55:29,834 --> 00:55:35,542
So in Tibet and all these places, specially in Ladhak, you see,

811
00:55:35,792 --> 00:55:39,125
they used to cut the hands of the people when they died

812
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:40,959
and big ritual for the dead

813
00:55:41,167 --> 00:55:43,417
and then they started going towards the dead.

814
00:55:43,626 --> 00:55:47,125
So they started moving towards the left side.

815
00:55:47,334 --> 00:55:50,584
Most of the Buddhists moved to the left side,

816
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:56,501
which was absolutely prohibited by Buddha,

817
00:55:56,751 --> 00:55:59,959
because He is on the right side.

818
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:06,751
He said, “Cut down your desires, do the karmas without the desire”.

819
00:56:06,959 --> 00:56:08,292
This was His idea.

820
00:56:08,501 --> 00:56:12,792
Activate your right side without the desire.

821
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,626
This was His philosophy.

822
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:18,834
But they - all of them are left sided.

823
00:56:19,083 --> 00:56:22,959
They have desires, not only desires

824
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:26,876
but whatever they do they do it out of desire.

825
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:31,626
Like the worst is like the Japanese,

826
00:56:31,876 --> 00:56:36,042
they think that you can

827
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:42,584
commit suicide in the name of your nation.

828
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:47,959
With this desire they will commit suicide.

829
00:56:48,334 --> 00:56:50,417
To save their country they can commit suicide.

830
00:56:50,626 --> 00:56:52,584
I mean it is absurd.

831
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:56,334
He said, “Whatever you have to do, do without the desire”,

832
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,125
which is a difficult thing for human beings.

833
00:56:58,334 --> 00:57:02,042
How many there are who are doing it without desire?

834
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:05,792
And whatever we do, we do out of desire.

835
00:57:05,959 --> 00:57:08,250
Even at the subtler point.

836
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:09,918
Even when we do puja,

837
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:15,125
we do with the desire that our vibrations will improve.

838
00:57:15,334 --> 00:57:19,959
Can we think of a state where it is absolutely desireless?

839
00:57:20,292 --> 00:57:26,959
Only one person has that, there’s no desire, desireless.

840
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:29,459
The whole thing is done without any desire,

841
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:31,792
so there is no disappointment.

842
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:34,417
There is no unhappiness.

843
00:57:34,626 --> 00:57:35,918
You are going to America,

844
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:41,959
knowingly that is going to be a horrible experience,

845
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,000
but it’s a joke, just going to see the joke.

846
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:48,542
Without any hope,

847
00:57:48,876 --> 00:57:53,584
maybe it might work out to be something tremendous,

848
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:55,334
but no desires.

849
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:59,792
You see, it’s so desireless the whole personality is,

850
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,709
that even if I have to desire for something

851
00:58:01,918 --> 00:58:03,250
I have to ask you, "You better desire!",

852
00:58:03,459 --> 00:58:05,959
because I have lost the sense of desire.

853
00:58:06,209 --> 00:58:09,375
So many times I’ve said you better do it for Me.

854
00:58:09,584 --> 00:58:12,959
Unless and until you pray to Me I can't do it.

855
00:58:13,209 --> 00:58:15,167
That's why I asked you write to Me a letter,

856
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:16,626
because you see, I can't desire,

857
00:58:16,834 --> 00:58:18,501
i really don't. I don't do anything!

858
00:58:18,709 --> 00:58:21,792
Without doing anything it is happening. So why should I desire?

859
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:25,626
I really don't do anything.

860
00:58:25,918 --> 00:58:28,792
You'll be amazed, I don't do anything, I don't desire anything,

861
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:30,876
nothing of the kind, it’s working I am just watching.

862
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:31,876
Still you are saying,

863
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:38,000
“Mother you aredoing it.” I'm quite surprised!

864
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:40,083
That is Tao.

865
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:41,709
If you read about Tao,

866
00:58:41,959 --> 00:58:45,042
it is said that it doesn’t do anything.

867
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:49,209
But everything works out.

868
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:52,501
So this is what He said, which was all sahaja,

869
00:58:52,709 --> 00:58:55,083
that you have to be desireless

870
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:57,918
and do everything,

871
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:03,250
and He is the one who controls our ego.

872
00:59:03,459 --> 00:59:08,501
Because if you have no desire you will have no ego either.

873
00:59:09,209 --> 00:59:10,876
Ego is only built up

874
00:59:11,083 --> 00:59:14,584
when you have a desire to do something.

875
00:59:14,792 --> 00:59:19,584
That is you just do it for fun, just for joy, just for doing it.

876
00:59:19,792 --> 00:59:22,125
Then how will you build up ego? You cannot.

877
00:59:22,334 --> 00:59:26,209
Like an artist is painting just for fun and throwing it away.

878
00:59:26,459 --> 00:59:30,542
Creating something just for fun – that’s what God is.

879
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:33,042
Not with the desire to achieve something.

880
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,125
I mean the desire is so gross, can be extremely gross.

881
00:59:36,459 --> 00:59:39,626
It can become subtler and subtler and subtler. That’s a good way.

882
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:43,334
But can be very, very gross also,

883
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:46,751
like some people can believe that, you see,

884
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:51,584
“I should painting, because I'll get so much money."

885
00:59:51,876 --> 00:59:54,542
Or "I can sell it to somebody

886
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:58,292
who may be the worst man, but I’ll sell it because I can get more money.”

887
00:59:58,501 --> 01:00:01,083
That’s absolutely the grossest of all, you see.

888
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:04,876
That you can go to the most sinful things, I mean, I don’t know,

889
01:00:05,083 --> 01:00:07,709
there can be even worse desires than that,

890
01:00:07,959 --> 01:00:09,334
can be very many.

891
01:00:09,542 --> 01:00:12,042
But on this auspicious day we should not think of them

892
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:16,375
which are there like that, but minimum of minimum,

893
01:00:16,584 --> 01:00:22,417
if you come, just do your puja, just for the joy of it,

894
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:25,751
not with any desires.

895
01:00:26,167 --> 01:00:27,959
Just for the joy of it.

896
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:30,501
I mean we are doing so many things like that.

897
01:00:30,709 --> 01:00:34,834
For example, we enjoy each other’s company.

898
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:36,959
Just, just think of that!

899
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:39,542
We all Sahaja Yogis are enjoying each other’s company,

900
01:00:39,792 --> 01:00:43,334
what’s this for? Nothing at all. There’s no, nothing.

901
01:00:44,667 --> 01:00:47,709
Just, you are enjoying it without any desire.

902
01:00:47,959 --> 01:00:53,125
Just say, for enjoyment’s sake, enjoyment.

903
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,542
When that purity comes, you see in our temperament,

904
01:00:56,834 --> 01:00:59,751
that we do everything without any desire,

905
01:01:00,042 --> 01:01:03,167
we have got rid of all the ego.

906
01:01:03,375 --> 01:01:04,959
The Buddha is awakened within us.

907
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:07,626
And that’s what is the importance of Buddha,

908
01:01:07,834 --> 01:01:09,834
that He settled down Himself

909
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:12,751
in a place which is the most difficult place,

910
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:16,042
that is on the left side of your head, you see.

911
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:19,584
Sometimes I've seen it projects here up to this point, you know,

912
01:01:19,792 --> 01:01:22,751
in some people they get such a terrible pain, you know,

913
01:01:22,959 --> 01:01:25,792
pulling it out from there, can't imagine.

914
01:01:25,959 --> 01:01:31,375
So this horrible point which is  -

915
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:35,417
so funny it is, sometimes it can blow up like that, you see,

916
01:01:35,626 --> 01:01:38,876
sometimes it can pierce through. It’s a horrible one

917
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:42,042
which all of you have developed quite a lot, you see,

918
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:45,417
and it takes it forms in different ways and methods.

919
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:51,083
For that we have to say, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

920
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:55,667
means: We surrender ourselves to Buddha.

921
01:01:56,584 --> 01:01:59,292
Then what does He say? The second one is very good:

922
01:01:59,501 --> 01:02:02,292
‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’:

923
01:02:02,542 --> 01:02:05,292
I surrender myself to collectivity, ‘sangham’.

924
01:02:05,501 --> 01:02:07,792
‘Sangha’ is the collectivity.

925
01:02:07,959 --> 01:02:11,584
I surrender myself to collectivity. Ego goes down.

926
01:02:11,876 --> 01:02:14,834
First of all Buddha who is sitting, who is the deity,

927
01:02:15,042 --> 01:02:16,501
which is the enlightenment,

928
01:02:16,709 --> 01:02:20,959
you say: “I surrender myself to Buddha.”

929
01:02:21,334 --> 01:02:26,083
Secondly you say: “I surrender myself to collectivity.”

930
01:02:26,334 --> 01:02:29,959
Egoistical people cannot surrender.

931
01:02:31,042 --> 01:02:33,667
So, ‘I surrender myself to collectivity’,

932
01:02:33,876 --> 01:02:41,876
so we say: “Sangham Sharanam Gachhami.”

933
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:49,292
It is to Virat we are doing.

934
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:52,292
What is the third one, is? "BuddhamSharanam Gachhami",

935
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:56,042
"Sangham Sharanam Gachhami", the third one -

936
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,626
‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

937
01:02:57,834 --> 01:03:00,125
Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami. ‘Dhammam’ means

938
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:02,584
the religion - the balance.

939
01:03:02,792 --> 01:03:06,792
I surrender myself to religion, which is  essence of you,

940
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:08,959
or you can put it the other way round,

941
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:14,167
that, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami, Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami,

942
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:15,792
Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’.

943
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,125
That's all. If you have achieved it then we can talk of God.

944
01:03:20,417 --> 01:03:24,417
Not before that.

945
01:03:24,626 --> 01:03:26,918
So these three things are to be achieved.

946
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:29,417
We would put it in a Sahaja Yoga way like this:

947
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:33,709
First of all: ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’,

948
01:03:33,959 --> 01:03:39,792
‘I surrender myself to my virtues’.

949
01:03:39,959 --> 01:03:42,375
All desires can be surrendered to a virtue.

950
01:03:42,792 --> 01:03:45,751
Is it virtuous to do like this?

951
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:48,501
You can, if you are brought up that way you’ll just not do it.

952
01:03:48,709 --> 01:03:50,125
You'll have no desires to do something,

953
01:03:50,334 --> 01:03:52,334
that is not virtuous and righteous.

954
01:03:52,542 --> 01:03:54,167
You will just not do it.

955
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:57,375
So, ‘Dhammam Sharanam Gachhami’.

956
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,417
Then you should say, ‘Buddham Sharanam Gachhami’, means:

957
01:04:00,626 --> 01:04:02,959
I surrender myself to my enlightenment.

958
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:06,125
This is the second state, when you are ascended.

959
01:04:06,334 --> 01:04:11,209
Surrender myself to enlightenment.

960
01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:15,042
Enlightenment that I've got to my Spirit.

961
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:17,459
Is the Spirit who is going to guide you.

962
01:04:17,667 --> 01:04:22,834
No more my physical, mental, emotional nonsensical temptations.

963
01:04:23,042 --> 01:04:25,751
But what? Is the Spirit?

964
01:04:26,167 --> 01:04:29,918
And thirdly: ‘Sangham Sharanam Gachhami’, to the collectivity,

965
01:04:30,334 --> 01:04:33,584
to the whole, to the Virat.

966
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:36,584
This is the way we have to work it out.

967
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:39,292
So ultimately he reached the same point,

968
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:43,042
that let me start it from myself.

969
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:47,918
It's from myself to others, not from others to myself.

970
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:52,626
Is like treating the tree from outside, not from the roots.

971
01:04:53,083 --> 01:04:55,918
But Sahaja Yoga treats you from the roots.

972
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:59,125
First you get your Realization,all right,

973
01:04:59,334 --> 01:05:06,125
then you learn how to surrender yourself to your Dharma.

974
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:10,876
Then you become collectively conscious.

975
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:14,167
Collectivity is a temperament,

976
01:05:14,375 --> 01:05:20,709
is a sense of enjoyment that you get in the collective living.

977
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:29,042
Unless and until you have that you have not achieved your joy.

978
01:05:30,959 --> 01:05:37,000
So Buddha has played a very great role in our lives

979
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:41,959
and He is a very great powerful force within us.

980
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:48,709
I’m very happy that Buddha Jayanti has fallen here in England,

981
01:05:48,918 --> 01:05:52,667
because as we say the England is the Heart of the universe -

982
01:05:52,876 --> 01:05:57,292
it doesn't matter if I say here, is any Arab here?

983
01:05:58,459 --> 01:06:02,375
I don't want to displease any Arab people sitting here.

984
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:07,834
All right. And if it is the heart

985
01:06:08,042 --> 01:06:13,501
whatever you do here will circulate in the whole universe.

986
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:16,626
So if you can conquer your ego here,

987
01:06:16,834 --> 01:06:22,459
you can even conquer the ego of Mister Reagan and these Russians.

988
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:25,584
You can manage that. But first start it here.

989
01:06:25,834 --> 01:06:27,792
It has to reverse back you see, now

990
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,626
they have to learn from you and you don’t learn from them.

991
01:06:34,042 --> 01:06:39,918
When it will work out you’ll be amazed.

992
01:06:40,167 --> 01:06:44,292
Ego is the only problem I always face reaching their hearts.

993
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:48,792
If ego is removed everything will be all right.

994
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:54,667
So for us the great mantra is "Buddham Sharanam Gachhami".

995
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:59,709
These three mantras you must say everyday I think,

996
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:05,042
to get rid of this horrible ego.

997
01:07:05,292 --> 01:07:07,667
Now, any questions on Buddha you have?

998
01:07:07,918 --> 01:07:15,876
I've made it in a short way – the whole life it is very difficult.

999
01:07:30,083 --> 01:07:36,375
It’s receding - ego.

1000
01:07:43,542 --> 01:07:46,083
English are wise people, sound people,

1001
01:07:46,292 --> 01:07:47,501
and they must understand this, that

1002
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:49,542
is a very, very important thing

1003
01:07:49,751 --> 01:07:52,584
that they should not loose these qualities

1004
01:07:52,792 --> 01:07:57,125
and should try to fix their enlightenment

1005
01:07:57,334 --> 01:08:02,542
in such a way that it circulates.

1006
01:08:15,751 --> 01:08:20,751
Any question?

1007
01:08:23,876 --> 01:08:26,459
Gavin told Me yesterday it is Buddha Jayanti. I was very happy,

1008
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:28,918
because in England I've not talked of Buddha

1009
01:08:29,125 --> 01:08:33,959
but otherwise I have talked about Him elsewhere.

1010
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:15,375
So now, that's why I wore, you see, a Buddha's shawl

1011
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:23,709
because it is suggesting of a detached mind

1012
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:28,417
which has no color.

1013
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:32,667
And

1014
01:09:33,959 --> 01:09:40,042
there could be a personality which is colourless.

1015
01:09:41,501 --> 01:09:49,459
but you can have it covered with colours to make others happy.

1016
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:58,042
So when you are a Realized Soul, whatever you do is natural.

1017
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,375
Whatever you do.

1018
01:09:59,584 --> 01:10:01,584
If I am wearing this, now I am a Buddha.

1019
01:10:01,792 --> 01:10:05,042
When I take it out, I'm Adi Shakti.

1020
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:09,459
Is not a drama, is a fact.

1021
01:10:10,667 --> 01:10:15,918
But if you are not a realized soul, before that whatever you do it’s just a drama.

1022
01:10:18,334 --> 01:10:20,584
For example, this is an artificial thing,

1023
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:23,167
I put My hand there anything, nothing will burn.

1024
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:26,125
But if it is real, it will definitely burn, whatever I may try.

1025
01:10:26,334 --> 01:10:28,334
It's like that.

1026
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:35,459
So if somebody is a real person

1027
01:10:35,667 --> 01:10:38,334
whatever he does is not a drama,

1028
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:40,542
is reality.

1029
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:43,250
That's how they say

1030
01:10:43,459 --> 01:10:46,167
that She can take this form, She can take thav form

1031
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,000
people don't understand, how can

1032
01:10:48,209 --> 01:10:50,834
one person take so forms. Can.

1033
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:53,792
if it is Reality, it can.

1034
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:56,417
Like the Mother Earh, She is a Reality,

1035
01:10:56,667 --> 01:11:00,834
and the sap that is coming from the Mother Earth

1036
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:03,209
takes so many forms.

1037
01:11:03,459 --> 01:11:05,626
See Her power!

1038
01:11:05,959 --> 01:11:12,542
Flowers, this wood, different colors, fragrance

1039
01:11:12,834 --> 01:11:19,667
so many things! Is one Mother Earth, is producing all this!

1040
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:24,083
Because She is Reality.

1041
01:11:24,292 --> 01:11:29,042
It's the Reality in Her can produce.

1042
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:32,209
But unreal things,

1043
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,334
whatever you make out of unreal things,

1044
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:43,709
they may look real, but they are not.

1045
01:11:45,918 --> 01:11:49,626
So now, let us have the puja.

1046
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,792
And for the rituals also He said,

1047
01:11:52,959 --> 01:11:55,959
because most of them were unrealized souls in those days

1048
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:59,918
that they, whatever puja, they did was unreal, it was not real,

1049
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:06,000
had no meaning. It was giving no effect.

1050
01:12:06,334 --> 01:12:08,959
You see, worshipping a person who is unreal

1051
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:10,667
or any Deity who is unreal

1052
01:12:10,876 --> 01:12:12,542
or those who were not real people

1053
01:12:12,751 --> 01:12:14,334
and the Realized Souls.

1054
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:16,667
What's the use of unrealized people worshipping Me?

1055
01:12:16,876 --> 01:12:20,626
I mean I would not allow any unrealized person to worship Me at all.

1056
01:12:20,876 --> 01:12:23,167
You see, I always tell people unless and until they are

1057
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:25,751
perfectly sahaja yogis, you know then they are good,

1058
01:12:25,959 --> 01:12:27,250
please don't bring them for puja.

1059
01:12:27,459 --> 01:12:30,125
Is troublesome to Me. Much more than to them.

1060
01:12:30,334 --> 01:12:33,542
You see they also feel obliged as if, you see, they are obliging Me,

1061
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:35,584
they think so by worshipping Me. I don't know.

1062
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:37,501
But they don't know how much they are troubling Me,

1063
01:12:37,709 --> 01:12:39,709
by coming here without Realisation.

1064
01:12:39,918 --> 01:12:43,459
So the ones who haven't got Realisation are really troublesome.

1065
01:12:43,667 --> 01:12:47,209
They don't help Me.

1066
01:12:47,417 --> 01:12:53,125
So the myth some peple have that if they come to a puja

1067
01:12:53,501 --> 01:12:58,709
before Realisation they'll get Realisation, is not good.

1068
01:12:58,918 --> 01:13:02,167
You should not bring anyone who is not a Realized Soul

1069
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:04,209
or who is not a Sahaja Yogi to a puja here.

1070
01:13:04,417 --> 01:13:08,167
It's troublesome and that person also starts doubting,this, that.

1071
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:09,542
Is better not to do such a thing.

1072
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:14,417
Because also such a person is half baked.

1073
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:18,000
So no use giving Me half baked cakes,

1074
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:20,918
and spoiling the half baked cake also permanently

1075
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:23,584
because if you take out a half baked cake, you see,

1076
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:25,209
it's spoilt for ever.

1077
01:13:25,417 --> 01:13:28,667
I can't eat it nor you can bake it again.

1078
01:13:28,959 --> 01:13:33,334
So what's the use of bringing somebody who is half baked?

1079
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:34,083
All right?

1080
01:13:34,292 --> 01:13:38,250
So from next time, also this is out of compassion you do it,

1081
01:13:38,501 --> 01:13:40,584
I know you do it out of compassion,

1082
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:46,083
but this is not wise.

1083
01:13:46,292 --> 01:13:48,792
It doesn't help Me, nor it helps others. All right?

1084
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,959
So from next time also any time, you must find out a circular saying

1085
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:56,250
that unless and until you are sure about the Realisation of a person

1086
01:13:56,459 --> 01:13:59,751
that he has got Realisation, you should not call them for the puja.

1087
01:13:59,959 --> 01:14:03,417
They are not good for Mother and they are not good for themselves.

1088
01:14:03,626 --> 01:14:07,459
Because they become, you see doubting or something, and

1089
01:14:07,959 --> 01:14:10,584
you cannot really give them Realisation after that, it's very [hard].

1090
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,792
You remember your friend had the same problem

1091
01:14:12,959 --> 01:14:16,083
who was he? Nick or something...

1092
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:17,042
All right.

1093
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:21,167
So now we can… Gavin, you can do the Ganesha Puja.

1094
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:23,626
You can read it in English.

1095
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:27,751
Now, I think those who have not washed My Feet before, in Brighton,

1096
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,792
should come down. You washed My Feet?

1097
01:14:30,959 --> 01:14:34,083
No? All right, he will come to do it.

1098
01:14:34,292 --> 01:14:37,709
Who else is there? Come forward.

1099
01:14:38,459 --> 01:14:42,584
Can you put some towel here? [Hindi/Marathi]

1100
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:45,918
Put one down here, straight.

1101
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:08,292
Now, you,

1102
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:14,417
look and she has to... Gavin, has washed My Feet, can she?

1103
01:15:14,626 --> 01:15:17,334
Shri Mataji: Who is she? Sahaja Yogi: Carol? Carol...

1104
01:15:17,542 --> 01:15:21,751
Shri Mataji: You washed it. You've done it, in India?

1105
01:15:30,584 --> 01:15:33,959
Let two by, two, two persons should come, would be better.

1106
01:15:34,167 --> 01:15:35,626
All right? So let's have it.

1107
01:15:35,834 --> 01:15:38,876
You can be here, you both, and then these two can be there.

1108
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:42,626
All right. Now you can sit there, but just...

1109
01:15:42,834 --> 01:15:44,125
You pour the water.

1110
01:15:44,334 --> 01:15:50,667
Now, Gavin, you say the English translation, would be better.

1111
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:53,417
Both of you. Come along, come forward,

1112
01:15:53,626 --> 01:15:57,083
and you have to rub My Feet very hard.
