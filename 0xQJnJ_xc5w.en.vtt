00:00.090 --> 00:06.900
For attention, two centers, which\h
is very important for Sahaja yogis\h\h

00:06.900 --> 00:24.390
and also as the situation is, one is of\h
left Vishuddhi and one of heart itself.

00:24.390 --> 00:34.320
Just now when I was coming, I knew there were lots\h\h

00:34.320 --> 00:38.970
of left Vishuddhis everywhere and in\h
the car also I felt the same thing.

00:38.970 --> 00:42.090
I did not know what to do.

00:42.090 --> 00:45.690
Because there were people who were thinking,\h\h

00:45.690 --> 00:55.470
“I wish we had done this and that,” and I was\h
just waiting for a chance to break it, you see.

00:55.470 --> 01:02.130
And then suddenly I got a chance\h
and I made a fun of the whole thing.

01:02.130 --> 01:09.510
The combination between left\h
Vishuddhi and joy is quite a lot.

01:09.510 --> 01:13.020
Left Vishuddhi is also of two types.

01:13.020 --> 01:18.510
One is where people do not feel guilty.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.310
Indians will never feel guilty.

01:23.310 --> 01:25.770
Seldom will you find an Indian feeling guilty.

01:25.770 --> 01:28.680
Seldom, that’s not in their character.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.510
I mean they are adamantly not feeling guilty.

01:30.510 --> 01:35.580
Can you believe it! Even if they have\h
done wrong, they will go on shamelessly.

01:35.580 --> 01:39.360
You’ll tell them, then they\h
will take another course.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.410
Then you tell them something, they will go in\h
another course, but they will never change.

01:43.410 --> 01:46.260
They are very adamant, extremely adamant people.

01:46.260 --> 01:49.440
Only thing is if, somehow or other,\h\h

01:49.440 --> 01:53.190
you manage to break their adamant\h
nature, then they will come around.

01:53.190 --> 01:57.060
Otherwise they go on.

01:57.060 --> 02:06.120
The another thing is the western left Vishuddhi.

02:06.120 --> 02:11.850
Whatever you may try, they will get into guilt.

02:11.850 --> 02:21.210
You make them laugh, you tickle\h
them, you joke with them,\h\h

02:21.210 --> 02:25.680
make them feel nice, [but still] for small,\h
small things they will start feeling guilty.

02:25.680 --> 02:39.000
I mean that’s also another adamance! That,\h
try to understand that what guilt can we have.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.070
Firstly as Indians are,\h
they never commit mistakes.

02:44.070 --> 02:45.960
I mean, if you tell them anything, they would say,\h\h

02:45.960 --> 02:51.270
“Why do you blame me?” I mean, they’ll never\h
take a blame of anything upon themselves.

02:51.270 --> 02:55.350
Somehow or the other it is, maybe, because\h
they have been slaves for three hundred years,\h\h

02:55.350 --> 02:58.020
this kind of a thing they have\h
developed within themselves that,\h\h

02:58.020 --> 02:59.280
if you take the blame, you are punished.

02:59.280 --> 03:04.560
So best thing is never take the blame\h
and never fall into that trap you see.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.740
It is a kind of a egotistical left\h
Vishuddhi you can say, a type of.

03:07.740 --> 03:14.760
But the another one is incurable,\h
because the first one cures itself.

03:14.760 --> 03:21.540
Anybody who is like that you say, now\h
supposing you say that “you should not\h\h

03:21.540 --> 03:25.860
do this!” then the person will say,\h
“All right I’ll do something else."

03:25.860 --> 03:27.930
Then I will recede.

03:27.930 --> 03:28.620
I will do this.

03:28.620 --> 03:29.220
I will go away.

03:29.220 --> 03:29.880
I will do this.

03:29.880 --> 03:32.220
But they will never give up their habits.

03:33.930 --> 03:37.260
That’s one type.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.820
Some of you have that kind.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.590
Very few but have.

03:40.590 --> 03:51.960
Now as we are here to improve ourselves and\h
grow more, we have to understand how we do it.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.450
Not to find excuses.

03:54.450 --> 03:59.340
It’s very easy to say, to say,\h
“Oh my health is not good,\h\h

04:00.660 --> 04:04.680
I am not good for this, I am a\h
bad person,” All sorts of things.

04:04.680 --> 04:08.070
It’s just finding faults with yourself.

04:08.070 --> 04:13.380
For what, I mean, the second\h
type of left Vishuddhis are,\h\h

04:13.380 --> 04:16.860
just because that’s only the\h
way you can escape yourself.

04:16.860 --> 04:23.160
I mean, the net results of both the Vishuddhis\h
is that you do not achieve anything.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.840
Isn’t it?

04:24.840 --> 04:33.300
One person can say that “No I have done nothing\h
wrong, you see I will go on like this,” and that\h\h

04:33.300 --> 04:40.320
person will keep quiet, reserved, won’t\h
say anything, but will be fast there.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.910
Will not smile, laugh you see, lose collectivity.

04:44.910 --> 04:49.050
But what is the gain?

04:49.050 --> 04:52.740
I mean, you are not going to carry on with\h
these frivolous things all your lives, are you?

04:52.740 --> 04:57.900
You have to go further, and where\h
have you to go in the witness state?

04:57.900 --> 05:00.960
You must go to the witness state.

05:00.960 --> 05:06.780
Unless and until you witness the whole thing,\h
you do not gain and how do you witness?

05:06.780 --> 05:14.380
By seeing the futility of these\h
kinds of angularities you have got.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.960
Just witness the drama.

05:16.960 --> 05:22.990
Just witness yourself just as an actor.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.820
Just see these things are happening.

05:24.820 --> 05:25.210
All right.

05:25.210 --> 05:30.070
So, why should you worry about these things?

05:30.070 --> 05:31.600
You should love the other person.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.220
You should be in a loving mood\h
and a happy and joyous mood.

05:36.220 --> 05:46.180
You should not worry as to what is going\h
to happen to yourself or to others.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.960
Witness the whole play as a detached person.

05:49.960 --> 05:55.090
You go on witnessing it and the way it develops,\h\h

05:55.090 --> 06:01.690
you will be a very lovable\h
person having collectively.

06:01.690 --> 06:09.190
Of course this witness state can be also\h
hampered by some people who are egoistical.

06:09.190 --> 06:15.100
We have in Sahaja yoga some 3-4 people who will\h
remain egoistical whatever I may try, I think now.

06:15.100 --> 06:16.900
See, they are very difficult people.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.250
They are unpopular.

06:18.250 --> 06:20.380
No one likes them, sort of people.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.820
They don’t understand that\h
collectivity is important.

06:24.820 --> 06:28.030
They’ll find faults with\h
everybody but not with themselves.

06:28.030 --> 06:30.970
They go on like that.

06:30.970 --> 06:32.920
Sometimes they improve a\h
little, again they go down.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.530
But, we have to witness all of them.

06:35.530 --> 06:39.580
It never justifies your behavior.

06:40.810 --> 06:44.440
Supposing somebody is like that,\h
take an X Y Z is like that,\h\h

06:44.440 --> 06:47.290
is difficult, he doesn’t have collectivity.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.940
Say, the position is like that, you see.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.650
So now what should be your attitude?

06:51.430 --> 06:53.890
Should you get affected by that.

06:53.890 --> 06:55.810
Not at all.

06:55.810 --> 06:56.470
If you are a witness.

06:56.470 --> 07:04.120
Should you get enamoured by that or\h
caught by that or become like that?

07:04.120 --> 07:07.510
Not at all, because you are a collective being.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.510
What is the third thing you can do?

07:10.510 --> 07:12.190
Can you tell me?

07:12.190 --> 07:16.120
With such a difficult person, what\h
will you do with such a person?

07:16.120 --> 07:17.560
What should we do with such a person?

07:17.560 --> 07:23.860
If there is a difficult person with\h
us, there are some people who hate.

07:25.730 --> 07:30.320
They hate such a person if he is there, we\h
cannot perfect, we are not supposed to perfect.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.070
Are we perfect?

07:31.070 --> 07:33.050
Then what should we do?

07:36.740 --> 07:37.057
Sahaja Yogi: We should love him even more.

07:37.057 --> 07:45.350
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s true we should love,\h
but sometimes he may misunderstand your love.

07:45.350 --> 07:57.200
Not only that but he might become more sort of\h
aggressive because he takes your love for granted.

07:57.200 --> 08:03.820
What should the Sahaja yogis do?

08:03.820 --> 08:03.844
Sahaja Yogis: Shoe beat.

08:03.844 --> 08:08.660
Shri Mataji – Yes that’s one of them.

08:12.200 --> 08:19.240
It’s very simple, very close\h
to you, which you forget.

08:19.240 --> 08:19.267
Sahaja Yogis : Work on him.

08:19.267 --> 08:22.160
Shri Mataji: What…..

08:22.160 --> 08:24.650
Alright.

08:24.650 --> 08:26.510
But still simpler.

08:33.410 --> 08:35.465
What is it?

08:35.465 --> 08:35.497
Sahaja Yogi: Put him in bandhan.

08:35.497 --> 08:39.710
Shri Mataji: That’s it,\h
but even simpler than that.

08:39.710 --> 08:39.937
Sahaja Yogi: Ignore him.

08:39.937 --> 08:47.986
Shri Mataji: That’s your human\h
style, not Sahaja yogi style …

08:47.986 --> 08:55.057
Ray Harris: Tell him your not\h
going to stand for his nonsense.

08:55.057 --> 09:03.170
Shri Mataji: That’s again human, everybody does\h
that … What is the speciality of Sahaja yogis?

09:03.170 --> 09:04.579
Now, Gavin is using his brain.

09:04.579 --> 09:07.510
Shri Mataji laughs and says… “Use your heart."

09:07.510 --> 09:07.567
Linda: “Pray to You that\h
everything will be all right."

09:07.567 --> 09:14.690
Shri Mataji: “That’s it, that’s it,” she said it.

09:14.690 --> 09:19.010
“Leave it to Me,” she said it.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.410
That’s how Linda has achieved, so much.

09:24.410 --> 09:26.150
Leave it to Me.

09:26.150 --> 09:30.590
If you believe in Me, then don’t\h
worry, leave it to Me what ever I say,\h\h

09:30.590 --> 09:34.490
whatever I say, how to treat\h
that person, just listen to Me.

09:34.490 --> 09:34.640
Leave to Me.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.390
If I am available you can\h
tell Me, but leave to Me .

09:38.390 --> 09:42.950
I know everything, just leave it\h
to Me, and it can be worked out.

09:42.950 --> 09:47.720
As simple as that.

09:47.720 --> 09:52.100
Sahaja yoga is very simple made\h
easy, absolutely made easy,\h\h

09:52.100 --> 09:58.070
but still we trust ourselves\h
more, isn’t it, than the Divine.

09:58.070 --> 10:08.210
That’s what everybody else does, but for Sahaja\h
yogis it is important that [they] leave it to Me.

10:08.210 --> 10:10.880
I know how to manage.

10:10.880 --> 10:19.700
I know how to punish and also I know\h
how to save and I know how to love.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.050
So leave it to Me.

10:21.050 --> 10:25.910
You may write a letter to Me\h
also which I may never read.

10:25.910 --> 10:33.170
Doesn’t matter, you may pray, that’s the best way.

10:33.170 --> 10:34.850
Things work out better.

10:34.850 --> 10:35.570
Where is Peter (Pearce)?

10:35.570 --> 10:36.110
Has he come?”

10:36.110 --> 10:43.642
Linda Pearce: “I am afraid, Mother, I forgot betel\h
leaves; he has gone to get them from Pam’s house."

10:43.642 --> 10:47.540
Shri Mataji: “He’s gone to Pam’s house\h
(Pamela Bromley), alright, it’s alright.

10:47.540 --> 10:50.690
Forget it! If there are no\h
betel leaves it doesn’t matter.

10:50.690 --> 10:54.200
There are so many other\h
leaves here which can be used.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.260
In India it’s all right, betel leaves.

10:57.260 --> 10:58.940
Why in England?

10:58.940 --> 11:00.350
Maple are the best.

11:00.350 --> 11:01.790
I love the Maple.

11:01.790 --> 11:04.899
You have Maple here?

11:04.899 --> 11:04.910
This here.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.400
You get these are beautiful ones.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.000
Aren’t they?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.950
I love them.

11:09.950 --> 11:11.870
Your Maple trees are beautiful."

11:11.870 --> 11:19.610
So, now, how do we make ourselves\h
all right with this guilt business?

11:19.610 --> 11:21.650
Feeling guilt.

11:21.650 --> 11:27.350
First of all, let us see the people that’s the\h
main problem, I think is of feeling guilty.

11:27.350 --> 11:33.830
When you start witnessing yourself,\h
you’ll start seeing how your mind\h\h

11:33.830 --> 11:37.580
becomes subtler and subtler, as\h
far as the guilt is concerned.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.760
First it will start guilt.

11:40.760 --> 11:44.420
“Oh I should have not said this\h
to someone,” or all that starts.

11:44.420 --> 11:49.940
By that actually the another person does not\h
know also, that you have said something harsh.

11:49.940 --> 11:53.630
But you just think that, “Oh, I should not have\h
said this or said that,” and you create a barrier.

11:53.630 --> 12:03.200
So if you witness that this is my\h
mind which is playing a trick on\h\h

12:03.200 --> 12:06.710
me and just trying to cut me off from that person.

12:06.710 --> 12:12.380
Many relations break only because\h
of feeling guilty about things.

12:12.380 --> 12:20.990
If you could get over this understanding that\h
never keep anything in the mind about a person,\h\h

12:20.990 --> 12:27.410
no reservations then you will be surprised\h
there won’t be any guilt in your mind.

12:27.410 --> 12:33.920
All the time your mind is pouring\h
these ideas into your head.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.450
You [should] go on denying them.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.190
They’ll become subtler and subtler.

12:37.190 --> 12:41.630
It will work to this limit like, “Oh I\h
should not have done this to Mother."

12:41.630 --> 12:43.100
It comes to that point.

12:43.100 --> 12:48.080
The other way of the thing, you see, praying\h
to Mother and feeling guilty about it.

12:48.080 --> 12:52.760
“Ah I should not have put my feet towards Her.

12:52.760 --> 12:56.420
Oh God! I have taken Her shawl,\h
I should not have done this,\h\h

12:56.420 --> 13:06.620
I should have done that,” these\h
things are not child like.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.190
You have to be child like, innocent.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.620
Nothing is important.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.010
Nothing is [more] important than your love.

13:16.010 --> 13:18.410
I mean, you are not doing it deliberately.

13:18.410 --> 13:23.750
If something is done by mistake,\h
you should not feel bad.

13:23.750 --> 13:28.460
For example, I told Pamela\h
[Bromley] at a very subtler level,\h\h

13:28.460 --> 13:33.620
that she can use my bed after 3 days.

13:33.620 --> 13:35.330
I mean, she had been using the next day.

13:35.330 --> 13:37.010
All these years, nothing happened.

13:37.010 --> 13:41.990
But I am supposed to tell\h
her this because there are\h\h

13:41.990 --> 13:45.710
Ganas who are waiting there and they may harm you.

13:45.710 --> 13:52.250
But Indians, if they do this, then\h
they are really harmed immediately.

13:52.250 --> 13:52.820
Like Mrs.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.980
Pradhan she was thrown out of her bed thrice.

13:54.980 --> 13:56.810
She did not know what was happening.

13:56.810 --> 14:00.170
She was fast asleep she was thrown out.

14:00.170 --> 14:02.390
Then she got up and got onto the bed.

14:02.390 --> 14:03.530
Again she was thrown out.

14:03.530 --> 14:05.930
Then third time she was again on the ground.

14:05.930 --> 14:08.240
I said, “What is happening\h
here?” She said, “I don’t know.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.050
Somebody is throwing me out."

14:09.050 --> 14:13.970
I said, “Oh God, that was\h
My bed, you slept in My bed.

14:13.970 --> 14:14.480
I am sorry."

14:14.480 --> 14:16.250
I said, “Now you come and sleep here.

14:16.250 --> 14:19.100
Then she said now I am not going\h
to sleep on that bed Mother,\h\h

14:19.100 --> 14:22.535
because you have slept on that so\h
I am going to sleep on the ground.

14:22.535 --> 14:25.010
But they know.

14:25.010 --> 14:26.750
Indians know these things.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.640
They understand the auspiciousness and when\h\h

14:28.640 --> 14:31.940
they cross it, they are more\h
punished than you people are.

14:31.940 --> 14:33.050
Very badly punished.

14:33.050 --> 14:34.970
Because you are innocent.

14:34.970 --> 14:36.335
You do not know about it.

14:36.335 --> 14:41.060
But I have to tell you that you do it like this.

14:41.060 --> 14:44.810
Now if something has happened, then If I say,\h\h

14:44.810 --> 14:48.410
“Oh you should have done it,” then\h
immediately the guilt falls on you.

14:48.410 --> 14:53.030
So normally I take proper care\h
to tell you before it starts.

14:53.030 --> 15:03.260
So that at least it doesn’t have the\h
after effects because I don’t want\h\h

15:03.260 --> 15:08.510
that you should unnecessarily\h
bother about useless things.

15:08.510 --> 15:14.660
These things become important\h
when you have the knowledge of it.

15:14.660 --> 15:17.150
This is what is so great about Divine.

15:17.150 --> 15:22.520
You see supposing you put hand in\h
the flame, you will burn, isn’t it?

15:22.520 --> 15:27.740
But after getting realization\h
it’s just the other way round.

15:27.740 --> 15:32.690
If you commit mistakes and you do not\h
know about it, then you are not harmed.

15:32.690 --> 15:38.570
But knowingly if you do something, if you\h
know and you forget then you may be harmed.

15:38.570 --> 15:51.875
Thus you will realize that there is a Divine\h
hand which is guiding you and looking after you.

15:51.875 --> 15:57.380
Unless and until you learn how to witness\h
the thing, you can never enjoy life.

15:57.380 --> 16:02.210
So your witness state must be improved.

16:02.210 --> 16:06.440
Now what goes against witness state, in the west?

16:06.440 --> 16:09.455
We’ll see the western point of view.

16:09.455 --> 16:15.620
The first of them is that we have not\h
heard of Krishna very much before.

16:15.620 --> 16:18.950
I mean many people never\h
must have known about Him.

16:18.950 --> 16:21.680
So we are more identified with Christ.

16:22.340 --> 16:24.530
There cannot be like that.

16:24.530 --> 16:27.980
In Sahaja Yoga you have to be\h
identified equally with everything.

16:27.980 --> 16:30.440
You cannot be identified with\h
your eyes more than your nose.

16:30.440 --> 16:30.950
Can we?

16:30.950 --> 16:36.440
I mean we need both of them, we\h
can’t do away with any one of them.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.220
It’s like that.

16:37.220 --> 16:43.700
So, everybody is equally important\h
and harmonizing and they are just one.

16:43.700 --> 16:44.900
They are a unity.

16:44.900 --> 16:47.090
We cannot understand that unity because we are not\h\h

16:47.090 --> 16:50.450
perfect ourselves and we have\h
never seen such unity in life.

16:50.450 --> 16:57.380
I mean no two persons in this world,\h
that I have seen so far, who are that\h\h

16:57.380 --> 17:01.610
united as all these persons\h
are united within themselves.

17:01.610 --> 17:08.450
So, if such a unity is existing between them,\h\h

17:08.450 --> 17:11.720
if you try to dis-unite them,\h
they themselves get angry.

17:12.220 --> 17:13.570
They don’t like it.

17:13.570 --> 17:20.050
It’s like if you try to pull your\h
hair the head doesn’t like it,\h\h

17:20.050 --> 17:22.900
the body doesn’t like it, no one likes it.

17:22.900 --> 17:28.720
In the same way they don’t like it\h
at all, and both of them get angry.

17:28.720 --> 17:31.300
You must understand them\h
in their right perspective.

17:31.300 --> 17:38.770
In the West people have not\h
realized much about Krishna,\h\h

17:38.770 --> 17:43.285
nor do they respect Him as\h
much as they respect Christ .

17:43.285 --> 17:45.490
But Christ doesn’t like it.

17:45.490 --> 17:48.700
That’s why you catch on Angya.

17:48.700 --> 17:57.010
The combination fits in, and also Vishuddhi\h
is catching .Vishuddhi/Angya catch is the\h\h

17:57.010 --> 18:04.000
worse thing I feel sometimes, because\h
in between these two lies the Heart.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.930
You can imagine what a granthi\h
it would be in the heart.

18:07.930 --> 18:18.550
So you have to develop that love for\h
Krishna, and understanding about Him.

18:18.550 --> 18:21.730
Anybody, anything says against\h
Krishna, they are saying against me.

18:21.730 --> 18:23.380
I know for definite, it is Me only.

18:23.380 --> 18:28.180
But anything anybody says\h
anything against Mohammad,\h\h

18:28.180 --> 18:33.085
I will stand up and I will\h
really be angry and furious .

18:33.085 --> 18:34.960
If they say against me,\h\h

18:34.960 --> 18:40.150
as I am today I may not so much because\h
they don’t know about the other person.

18:40.150 --> 18:45.460
So you have to understand\h
that you have to be united.

18:45.460 --> 18:49.900
Now those who have been Hare Krishna people,\h
they don’t want to hear about Christ.

18:49.900 --> 18:53.050
Their Guru has told them,\h
“Don’t worry about Christ."

18:53.050 --> 18:54.175
So they don’t want to hear about Christ.

18:54.175 --> 19:01.240
There’s another type who do not want to hear\h
about Mohammad, but Sahaja Yogis must know that\h\h

19:01.240 --> 19:07.990
we must develop the proper understanding\h
of Krishna, if you have to have this.

19:07.990 --> 19:11.200
Now you must know that He is the Primordial being.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.620
He’s the one who is the whole.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.380
You have to become one with Him.

19:19.380 --> 19:23.430
He is the complete awareness,\h
the Chitta, complete.

19:23.430 --> 19:27.960
Now we have to become one with Him.

19:27.960 --> 19:33.330
So first of all collectivity has to be developed.

19:33.330 --> 19:38.130
Another reason why Christian nations\h
are ego oriented, is because they\h\h

19:38.130 --> 19:40.050
have no sense of collectivity within themselves.

19:40.050 --> 19:41.670
They are very individualistic, you see.

19:41.670 --> 19:45.930
They must have their own\h
bathrooms, their rooms painted.

19:45.930 --> 19:51.420
I am told that the Warwick road people are\h
very busy painting their rooms and things.

19:51.420 --> 19:56.100
I mean, “This is my daughter, this\h
is my sister, this is my wife,\h\h

19:56.100 --> 20:01.320
this is my husband, my my my my my\h
my,” goes on morning till evening.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.630
There’s no sharing at all.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.340
Collectivity is very poor.

20:05.340 --> 20:09.300
They can’t understand that we can\h
share everything with each other.

20:09.300 --> 20:17.370
And when it comes to sharing with such\h
people it happens that they spoil.

20:17.370 --> 20:23.730
For example, you call people\h
or you give them something that\h\h

20:23.730 --> 20:27.030
belongs to another person – they will spoil it.

20:27.030 --> 20:34.740
On the contrary those who are people who are\h
collective, when they go to somebody’s house,\h\h

20:34.740 --> 20:40.020
or if they have somebody else’s things, they’ll\h
be more careful about them than their own.

20:40.020 --> 20:44.610
Like Patricia has been asking that, “Mother,\h\h

20:44.610 --> 20:48.390
you come and stay in my house because you want\h
to shift from Your house, will be a good idea."

20:48.390 --> 20:54.060
When my grandchildren were here, we didn’t want\h
to go there, because they may spoil her house.

20:54.060 --> 20:58.500
Then I will now, you see,\h
sort of, there’s a hesitation,\h\h

20:58.500 --> 21:01.260
thinking that we should not spoil her house.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.020
I mean if we are living in this\h
house, we are spoiling it already.

21:04.020 --> 21:06.210
But we don’t want to spoil that house.

21:06.210 --> 21:09.270
You see this kind of a feeling\h
should be with you that,\h\h

21:09.270 --> 21:10.740
by going to somebody’s house\h
you should not spoil [it].

21:10.740 --> 21:15.150
But if you go there, for example,\h
now we are in say Pamela’s house.

21:15.150 --> 21:22.500
Do we understand how should we live in that house?

21:22.500 --> 21:25.410
I’ve already seen 3-4 things broken there.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.750
Why?

21:27.750 --> 21:28.980
Because you have no collectivity,\h\h

21:28.980 --> 21:31.950
the understanding that we should\h
not look after our things.

21:31.950 --> 21:37.170
You see, we look after our things more and\h
then we don’t look after other’s things.

21:37.170 --> 21:40.980
I tell you if you start giving up looking after\h\h

21:40.980 --> 21:44.400
your own things, you will start\h
looking after other’s things.

21:44.400 --> 21:49.500
If you have to grow in, grow in Sahaja yoga,\h
first thing is we must grow in collectivity.

21:49.500 --> 21:53.070
We are worried more about our feelings.

21:53.070 --> 21:56.460
If somebody says something to us,\h
we will go and beat that person,\h\h

21:56.460 --> 22:05.970
but we don’t mind about the feelings\h
of others, then collectivity is less.

22:05.970 --> 22:08.940
And this is one of the drawbacks.

22:08.940 --> 22:13.020
I think the ego developed in this country more,\h\h

22:13.020 --> 22:18.240
much more because there was no\h
existence of Krishna felt at that time.

22:18.240 --> 22:25.680
If people had felt his existence, they\h
would never have gone that far, because\h\h

22:25.680 --> 22:30.570
they should know that we are part and parcel\h
of the whole and we have our own limitations.

22:30.570 --> 22:32.520
We cannot go beyond that.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.620
He is there, we have to achieve that.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.800
Why because Indians were not conscious of Christ.

22:37.800 --> 22:43.920
They went on with their Karma theories, that those\h
who are suffering have to suffer and those who\h\h

22:43.920 --> 22:48.750
have to do this like that, they said that, ‘Yes,\h
those who are born Brahmins,’ they thought that\h\h

22:48.750 --> 22:55.350
‘Oh we are higher people and these people have\h
to suffer.’ In any way both are monster ego.

22:55.350 --> 23:01.530
So we have to understand we are Sahaja yogis.

23:01.530 --> 23:07.170
We are people responsible\h
for changing the whole world,\h\h

23:07.170 --> 23:10.170
transforming the whole world\h
into a beautiful place.

23:10.170 --> 23:12.660
So we have to change ourselves.

23:12.660 --> 23:16.170
We should not find any excuses.

23:16.170 --> 23:19.710
We should decide that whatever may happen,\h\h

23:19.710 --> 23:23.340
we are going to change ourselves,\h
ourselves and not others.

23:23.340 --> 23:31.860
Even if that person is your brother, sister, wife,\h
husband – you should change, not the other person.

23:31.860 --> 23:39.570
If you start changing, you\h
will set in motion this thing.

23:39.570 --> 23:44.790
While many people just don’t want to change,\h
just don’t want to change, they go about with it.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.490
Every time you talk to them, they are like that.

23:47.490 --> 23:51.105
What are you doing about it?

23:51.105 --> 23:52.800
You have to work it out.

23:52.800 --> 24:00.270
So for Vishuddhi, I would say that you\h
should see the collectivity of Shri Krishna.

24:00.270 --> 24:05.130
He married 16,000 women.

24:05.130 --> 24:13.050
Now people might say “Oh God that’s too\h
much!” And He had 5 queens, you see.

24:13.050 --> 24:16.860
Actually these 16,000 women are\h
nothing but his 16,000 powers.

24:16.860 --> 24:20.850
Now he could not have Sahaja\h
Yogis as His children you see.

24:20.850 --> 24:26.130
He was very young, so He thought of\h
this trick that let His powers be\h\h

24:26.130 --> 24:30.450
born as women and He will have them\h
as wives and it was all a big drama.

24:30.450 --> 24:39.330
And the 5 queens are the\h
5 elements who incarnated.

24:39.330 --> 24:49.050
Just to use these 5 elements,\h
He had them as His queens.

24:49.050 --> 24:57.510
It’s a story, a very secretive story\h
and one has to understand in that line.

24:57.510 --> 25:02.490
So His collectivity was so great.

25:02.490 --> 25:05.910
Narada was the one who used\h
to create problems you see.

25:05.910 --> 25:11.100
He went and he told, he went and told,\h\h

25:15.110 --> 25:20.300
one of the wives that, “Oh this Krishna,\h
He does not love you, He only loves Radha.

25:20.300 --> 25:24.350
You are under wrong ideas, that He loves you.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.540
He just loves Radha.

25:26.540 --> 25:27.620
He does not love anyone.

25:27.620 --> 25:29.420
She’s the one He really cares for."

25:29.420 --> 25:36.680
So they got jealous, and they went\h
and told Shri Krishna that see we\h\h

25:36.680 --> 25:39.440
think that you only love Radha\h
and your just be befooling us.

25:39.440 --> 25:43.970
And we are not going to be your\h
wives anymore the way You are.

25:43.970 --> 25:46.040
In your heart of hearts You love Radha."

25:46.040 --> 25:49.520
So He said, “Who told you that?” They said Narada.

25:49.520 --> 25:49.940
He said “Alright.

25:49.940 --> 25:52.070
I know this Narada!”.

25:52.070 --> 26:04.430
So Narada came to see Shri Krishna and Narada,\h
then heard a great scream from Shri Krishna.

26:04.430 --> 26:05.360
Narada said, “What has happened."

26:05.360 --> 26:08.900
He said, “Oh a terrible pain in\h
my stomach, oh no terrible pain.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.130
I just can’t get over it."

26:10.130 --> 26:13.820
So Narada got a fright and he\h
said, “Now what should we do?

26:13.820 --> 26:15.020
You better tell us the medicine."

26:15.020 --> 26:22.640
He said if you can give the dust of your\h
feet for Me to drink, I’ll be all right.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.730
See the tricks of the witness.

26:25.730 --> 26:34.370
So he said, “Oh God!” Narada said, “I can’t\h
give because I know He’s the Primordial being.

26:34.370 --> 26:36.620
I can’t give the dust of my feet for Him to drink,\h\h

26:36.620 --> 26:42.350
that would be such a bad thing to do and I will\h
have all the sins of the world upon myself.

26:42.350 --> 26:43.310
I am not going to do."

26:43.310 --> 26:46.220
He said, “I am not doing!”

26:46.220 --> 26:48.590
He said anybody, anybody who thinks is my bhakta\h\h

26:48.590 --> 26:51.920
can do it, and you can ask my\h
wives, that’s a better idea.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.890
So Narada went round.

26:54.890 --> 26:55.940
He said “Oh He is in terrible pain,\h\h

26:55.940 --> 26:59.150
why don’t you give the dust of your\h
feet?” She said, “No, Nothing doing.

26:59.150 --> 27:02.000
You see as it is He doesn’t love us,\h\h

27:02.000 --> 27:09.980
in His heart is only Radha and He wants us\h
to give the dust of our feet, we are not mad.

27:09.980 --> 27:15.500
We will have no punyas, we will have no good\h
deeds for us and what’s going to happen”?

27:18.490 --> 27:27.640
So, Shri Krishna said, “If you cannot\h
give me, then what am I to do now?

27:27.640 --> 27:29.230
I have got terrible pain.

27:29.230 --> 27:31.480
And somebody has to do it."

27:31.480 --> 27:39.850
So Narada said, “What do you suggest\h
yourself?” He said “You go and ask Radha,\h\h

27:39.850 --> 27:41.710
she’s the only person left now."

27:41.710 --> 27:47.920
So he went to Gokul, and Vrindaban,\h\h

27:47.920 --> 27:58.210
that area has got the dust of yellow\h
color like pollen, the color of a pollen.

27:58.210 --> 28:05.260
And he went and told that “He’s got a pain\h
in the stomach, and now what to do?” She\h\h

28:05.260 --> 28:09.100
said “What did he say?” He said “If give\h
the dust of your feet, He will all right."

28:09.100 --> 28:10.390
She said “Take it, take it, take it.

28:10.390 --> 28:16.090
Just now you take it!” He said “Aren’t\h
you worried?” She said “About what?

28:16.090 --> 28:19.810
He’s the Primordial being! You give Him your dust.

28:19.810 --> 28:22.586
What will happen?” She didn’t feel guilty.

28:22.586 --> 28:29.353
She just said “It’s all right take it out."

28:29.353 --> 28:32.441
And he scraped some of the dust.

28:32.441 --> 28:37.130
He said, “Aren’t you worried, you’ll be losing\h
completely in your punyas and all that."

28:37.130 --> 28:38.630
She said, “Oh, don’t you worry."

28:38.630 --> 28:44.180
And she said, “He is the One who makes me do all\h\h

28:44.180 --> 28:48.050
the sins and He’s the One who makes me\h
love others, and He does everything.

28:48.050 --> 28:50.090
I’m not bothered it is his lookout.

28:50.090 --> 28:51.470
If He has asked for it, better take it."

28:51.470 --> 28:56.330
So he went to Krishna.

28:56.330 --> 28:59.390
The beauty of the story is here.

28:59.390 --> 29:03.260
He went to Sri Krishna and told\h
him that she has given the thing.

29:03.260 --> 29:07.010
He said “Bring it bring it!” and He drank.

29:07.010 --> 29:14.060
And he said But I was surprised at her answer that\h\h

29:14.060 --> 29:16.430
it is You who do all kinds\h
of sins and this and that.

29:16.430 --> 29:22.310
And you are the One who makes her to love\h
others and what ever He does is [UNCLEAR],\h\h

29:22.310 --> 29:23.330
She’s not bothered about it.

29:23.330 --> 29:26.570
She’s not worried about paapas and punyas,\h
she’s not worried about sin and good deeds.

29:26.570 --> 29:30.470
She said its He who does everything , I have\h
nothing to bother, let Him do what He likes.

29:30.470 --> 29:31.430
If He wants it I’ll give.

29:31.430 --> 29:33.410
I’m surprised she is not bothered.

29:33.410 --> 29:39.590
So Sri Krishna said, “All\h
right, you just watch just now.

29:39.590 --> 29:41.360
Watch my heart.

29:41.360 --> 29:45.965
And Sri Krishna opened His heart\h
and in the heart was Radha sitting.

29:45.965 --> 29:52.580
It was a lotus and the lotus had the pollen\h
and Her feet were touching that pollen.

29:52.580 --> 30:04.730
If Her feet are touching that pollen there then\h
what is the punyas and what are the apunyas?

30:04.730 --> 30:13.040
If Her feet are in His heart\h
then what is to decide.

30:13.040 --> 30:13.730
See the beauty.

30:13.730 --> 30:20.600
The poetry of the divine is so\h
beautiful, it’s so beautiful,\h\h

30:20.600 --> 30:24.920
if you understand the poetry,\h
then you will never feel guilty.

30:24.920 --> 30:29.690
You are unnecessarily taking\h
out thorns out of flowers.

30:29.690 --> 30:35.660
The beauty is so much, it’s so beautiful it is,\h\h

30:35.660 --> 30:40.190
the whole thing is so poetic\h
that, to understand that poetry,\h\h

30:40.190 --> 30:46.670
you have to cut down all these ideas of cursing\h
yourself and saying bad things to yourself.

30:46.670 --> 30:56.510
Leave everything to the Divine, in\h
full understanding and in full love.

30:56.510 --> 31:03.170
You don’t need much imagination for that.

31:03.170 --> 31:09.710
Its just when you go to your heart, and\h
see for yourself how much you have got.

31:09.710 --> 31:11.360
Just think.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.960
When you think of your guilt,\h
you should think: where were you?

31:14.960 --> 31:17.600
What was you condition?

31:17.600 --> 31:20.720
Did you ever expect that you\h
will get self-realization\h\h

31:20.720 --> 31:25.460
sitting down in London watching Thames Television?

31:33.490 --> 31:37.270
And you got it, just think of\h
the blessing and the grace,\h\h

31:37.270 --> 31:45.340
and forget about feeling guilty, just be\h
joyous and happy, and smile at yourself.

31:45.340 --> 31:52.660
There should be a giggle all\h
the time behind the lips.

31:52.660 --> 32:03.130
When these things will happen to you,\h
then you start feeling the joy within you.

32:03.130 --> 32:10.630
And that joy should be felt, it’s just a\h
play of the Divine which is to be seen as\h\h

32:10.630 --> 32:16.930
a play and not as something serious and\h
a horrible thing which makes you guilty.

32:16.930 --> 32:26.230
Now, no more you are going to feel guilty, but\h
if you are doing something wrong, against Sahaja\h\h

32:26.230 --> 32:35.200
Yoga, by which you are bringing bad name to\h
Sahaja Yoga, then you must immediately correct.

32:35.200 --> 32:40.030
Such people will be definitely punished\h
whether they feel guilty or not.

32:40.030 --> 32:41.740
There’s not doubt about it.

32:41.740 --> 32:46.180
But if you are loosing in\h
collectivity, you better improve.

32:46.180 --> 32:47.590
There are many people like that.

32:47.590 --> 32:50.500
First thing they’ll say, “I\h
was never told, I did not know.

32:50.500 --> 32:51.910
He should tell me."

32:51.910 --> 32:56.530
Some people will never tell, you see\h
this is the same style of people.

32:56.530 --> 32:58.600
Why not be open?

32:58.600 --> 32:59.440
Just open.

32:59.440 --> 33:04.420
You see flowers, they are only\h
always on top of the tree.

33:04.420 --> 33:07.330
Do they hide themselves under\h
the some roots and things?

33:07.330 --> 33:15.760
Only the creepers, horrible ones, like snakes\h
and worms and all these things, they hide.

33:15.760 --> 33:16.660
Why do they hide?

33:16.660 --> 33:21.280
Because they can’t face the beauty of sun.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.310
They can’t face the beauty of collectivity.

33:24.310 --> 33:28.840
So they hide and these scorpions they hide.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.930
Why should you hide anything from each other?

33:31.930 --> 33:32.290
Be open.

33:32.290 --> 33:36.700
Talk to each other openly,\h
without any reservations.

33:36.700 --> 33:42.200
I mean small things like people used to first\h
grudge, “Mother she has taken away my soap!”\h\h

33:42.200 --> 33:50.300
And I would used to say, “Oh God look at these\h
people!” “Oh I can’t use that soap!” You see.

33:51.590 --> 33:54.590
Perhaps you have not noticed, I have been\h
using your common soap there throughout.

33:54.590 --> 33:57.560
I deliberately did not use My soap.

33:57.560 --> 34:03.380
I left My soap down there so that you\h
can use it for a different purpose.

34:03.380 --> 34:05.900
I play like this all the time with you.

34:05.900 --> 34:10.880
But you have to also start playing with\h
Me, otherwise you will not be in the game.

34:10.880 --> 34:21.260
You will be left out, you will never\h
enjoy, and not only that you’ll be misfits,\h\h

34:21.260 --> 34:26.030
but like the way the other fellow\h
has asked Me that “How do you go\h\h

34:26.030 --> 34:30.080
to eternal hell?” I answered him\h
very simply, I said “You can take\h\h

34:30.080 --> 34:36.050
two running jumps and go there!” Imagine\h
the fellow doing that! It’s like that.

34:36.050 --> 34:39.650
So this is how we create our heavens and our hell.

34:39.650 --> 34:42.890
Sahaja Yoga is not for people\h
who want to go to hell.

34:42.890 --> 34:43.880
It’s very easy.

34:43.880 --> 34:50.990
But to deny Sahaja Yoga and to defy it\h
after coming to it, and not to accept\h\h

34:50.990 --> 35:02.110
the verdict of Sahaja Yoga and to displease\h
the deities is the worst thing one can do.

35:02.110 --> 35:09.700
Either you don’t come, if you come, you\h
have to obey and understand that these\h\h

35:09.700 --> 35:14.470
are the laws which are eternal\h
and you cannot surpass them.

35:14.470 --> 35:16.840
You accept them, then you enjoy.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.850
What’s the use of denying them?

35:18.850 --> 35:25.324
If you do not accept them you\h
cannot enjoy yourself and you\h\h

35:25.324 --> 35:27.430
will create a hell for yourself and for others.

35:27.430 --> 35:38.740
So today I say that let us open our heart.

35:38.740 --> 35:43.180
Just like the flowers, we\h
have to come up the tree.

35:43.180 --> 35:48.280
Let us compete in giving more, being\h
nice to others instead of criticizing.

35:48.280 --> 35:52.240
And sometimes people come and\h
tell me, “Oh he did like this."

35:52.240 --> 35:53.440
I don’t like it much.

35:53.440 --> 35:58.780
Unless and until it’s fundamentally\h
something wrong, you should not,\h\h

35:58.780 --> 36:02.590
and I know how many people\h
can carry on with others.

36:02.590 --> 36:04.150
That’s very important.

36:04.150 --> 36:09.970
So the collectivity must be brought in but\h
your character itself should be such that\h\h

36:09.970 --> 36:15.100
people should say “oh she is very sweet” or\h
“He’s very nice and is nice to everyone."

36:15.100 --> 36:20.560
Then also they should say not only that\h
but “They are ideal, the way they behave”.

36:20.560 --> 36:26.050
Especially husband and wives, I have seen\h
that some of them are very much appreciated,\h\h

36:26.050 --> 36:30.610
some of them are neutral type\h
and some of them are condemned.

36:30.610 --> 36:35.080
When you are married before Me,\h
its your moral responsibility\h\h

36:35.080 --> 36:42.550
to see that you really create a good\h
relationship and do not hate each other.

36:42.550 --> 36:54.600
One should not judge by other norms like you see,\h\h

36:54.600 --> 36:57.120
“He didn’t bring me a sari” or “He didn’t\h
bring me a frock” or something like that.

36:57.120 --> 37:02.340
But we have to be ideals.

37:02.340 --> 37:15.030
I have seen either they are dominated or they\h
do not want to get dominated or they dominate.

37:15.030 --> 37:17.280
There are only three categories.

37:17.280 --> 37:24.330
Wise are those who get over this category\h
and make a beautiful thing out of it.

37:24.330 --> 37:26.310
That’s a challenging point.

37:26.310 --> 37:32.700
And all such people who can take\h
up the challenge have been married.

37:32.700 --> 37:36.030
If they fail, I don’t think\h
anybody will marry again,\h\h

37:36.030 --> 37:40.920
most of them may remain bachelors\h
or spinsters or what you call them.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.780
So it’s not good.

37:42.780 --> 37:47.550
Those who are married have a great\h
responsibility to be sensible,\h\h

37:47.550 --> 37:52.320
not dominating at all by any chance.

37:52.320 --> 37:58.380
Nobody has business to say “Don’t\h
do that!” Nobody! After Sahaja Yoga.

37:58.380 --> 38:01.920
Before Sahaja Yoga it’s all right,\h
after you’re not to say, “Don’t”.

38:01.920 --> 38:08.430
And you don’t have to be also off-handed by\h
doing everything that you want to do yourself.

38:08.430 --> 38:09.300
Both things are wrong.

38:09.300 --> 38:11.670
There should be combination and understanding.

38:11.670 --> 38:17.880
I think the married people have much greater\h
responsibility than the unmarried in Sahaja Yoga.

38:17.880 --> 38:22.590
Then the mothers and the parents\h
are also very responsible people.

38:22.590 --> 38:27.630
They have to guide others how\h
they have to live with each other.

38:27.630 --> 38:34.230
The norms have to change; it’s not how much you\h
are educated, and what you know and efficiency.

38:34.230 --> 38:36.120
That’s not important in Sahaja Yoga at all.

38:36.120 --> 38:39.090
How much you earn, all this is not important.

38:39.090 --> 38:47.370
What is important is how you deal\h
with each other and enjoy each other.

38:47.370 --> 38:50.610
How much capacity you have\h
got to enjoy each other.

38:50.610 --> 38:54.360
And that’s the way you really transform yourself\h\h

38:54.360 --> 38:57.570
into a beautiful joyous\h
personality and others too.

38:57.570 --> 39:02.140
I hope the rain would stop\h
and we’ll have our Puja now.\h

39:02.140 --> 39:10.273
So May God bless you, enjoy every\h
bit of it, enjoy every bit of it.
