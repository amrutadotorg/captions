00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:19.760
Honourable Justice Tatachari and the citizens of Delhi and Sahaja Yogis,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:31.480
we are now at a juncture of history where it has become imminent

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.580
that we have to prove the existence of divine power.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:45.920
We have read about this All-pervading power. In our shastras,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:54.440
there has been elaborate descriptions about the divine power flowing through us,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.800
through each and every particle that is being manifested in this universe.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:15.140
But so far very few people have been able to enter into the realm of divinity

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.800
to feel that divine power.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:32.480
Those were born at such a higher level that they could not communicate with the rest of the people.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:42.760
They only sang the songs of divinity which was carried to the people

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.800
who never felt the existence of that divine power

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.020
which those people felt it like reality.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:06.080
It has been, as I have told you before, a search of human beings to jump into infinity

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:18.980
but the finite rationality and understanding, the buddhi of human being could not permeate into the infinity.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.400
So, the whole thing became such a mechanical process,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.260
the religions lost their significance and people could not believe in the talks of religions or divine power.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:43.280
But the time has come for people to have en masse entry into the Kingdom of God

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:57.300
to feel His existence throbbing being within themselves.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:09.380
As she told you, in 1970, I realized that human beings are not even awakened seekers.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.440
And that’s why all the mistakes have been committed

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:24.940
because those who were born on the 10th story could not explain to people who were not even in the first story.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.460
When I got this human Realization

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.300
and the reasons why this was happening,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:53.620
I started working on various people and found out their problems on the path of their awakening.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.960
In doing so within 2 years’ time I was hardly able to give

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:11.740
Realization or I should say the people could realize, only to twelve people

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.800
and it was a very hard task

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:29.480
because the people who came to me were not so much attracted.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.780
They felt, “What is the proof that there is divine power beyond us?”

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:45.280
But when they realized and when they started getting vibrations from their fingertips,

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.600
the vibrations which we call Chaitanya Lahari, by which they became Nirvakara,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:05:00.160
by which they started curing other people, by which they started giving awakening to other people

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:10.880
and giving them Realization, it became a proof with them, they have reached Self-actualization.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:19.620
It is a truth, it is not falsehood, it is not any propaganda, it has to happen within you,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.980
you cannot give false certificate to anybody that it has happened,

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.400
it has to happen fully into you and you have to feel it that it has happened

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.600
and when you use it you know it has happened.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:41.120
The other day you have seen the rising of the Kundalini with your naked eyes.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.900
Some of you have never even known the word ‘Kundalini’.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.480
But you have seen the throbbing of the Kundalini, how it rose and how it came up through the spine.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:06:03.000
When the Kundalini rises you actually can see the movement of Kundalini.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.780
There have been many people who have been talking of Kundalini awakening,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:18.540
actually none of them who says so have shown the rising of the Kundalini,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.280
the reason being the Kundalini never rose.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:33.280
The Kundalini only rises when there is somebody who is already enlightened and who knows the job of rising the Kundalini.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:44.680
So, they have described that, by raising the Kundalini, you actually become very heated up

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:55.160
or sometimes you start dancing, sometimes you start shouting and sometimes you get blisters all over your body.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.460
The way they have described Kundalini one would think that it is better to remain as you are

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.880
than to go into such kind of ordeal where you get completely finished and fract out

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.080
Kundalini is your Mother and She rests in the triangular bone

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.260
which is placed higher than Mooladhara Chakra.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:23.960
The triangular bone is known as the Mooladhara. You are all, you all know Sanskrit and you know what is the meaning of the Mooladhara.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:31.100
She rests there and those who try to incite Her from the wrong side,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:38.020
Shri Ganesha who is sitting on the Mooladhara Chakra gets angry and that anger is expressed

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:45.400
which people say that the Kundalini is angry.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:53.240
The Kundalini will never rise. She knows your problems. She loves you.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.500
She is the only Mother you have and She has been with you for ages for many lives

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.360
So, She doesn’t rise at all, She stays there.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.140
Only Shri Ganesha gets angry because He is supposed to look

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:12.120
after the chastity of your Mother, the protocol of your Mother.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:18.480
Now whether there is Shri Ganesha or not we start from that. From the scratch one has to start.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.120
People say that they have seen Shri Ganesha symbol inside the being.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:29.760
Whether Shri Ganesha is there or not can be verified in Sahaj Yoga.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:36.240
Because when you find somebody suffering like that you have to request to Shri Ganesh that,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:43.280
“Please don’t be angry”, the person has done it in that ignorance and He listens to you

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.120
immediately you find such a person becomes cool down.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.620
His blisters disappear and he feels very much comforted.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.240
Last time in Delhi if you remember there was one man who came rushing to me.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.980
First, he has gone to Bombay and then he has come back again to Delhi.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:07.300
He was a resident of Delhi and he told me that somebody has excited his Kundalini

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:17.680
and he was running all over the place helter-skelter shouting “What heat, what heat” as if lots of wasps have bitten.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.280
I asked him, “How did you get your awakening? Who was the man who did it?”

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:28.560
And he told me it was such a hideous method that decency prohibited to talk about that.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.100
And when I saw that I told him that, “How can you believe

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.000
that God can be achieved through such hideous and useless method?”

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.380
And he was a very educated man. Then I asked Shri Ganesh that,

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.960
“Please forgive him because he doesn’t know he is an ignorant person

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.800
and somebody who tried to take the money out of him or somebody who tried to show off his knowledge,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.800
played with his Kundalini, so please excuse him.”

00:09:54.800 --> 00:10:01.620
And there are so many people who witnessed that immediately he cooled down and he was all right.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.060
All the Deities that are on your Kundalini,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.400
whether they are there or not, because somebody has written, because somebody has said it,

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:13.400
because they are in the shastras also, why should we accept?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:19.140
Because rational man does not want to accept anything! Your children are not going to accept it.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:24.400
We can prove the existence of Shri Ganesha, in the same way we can prove the existence of all these Deities

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:31.740
that are on the chakras that are within human spine.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:38.660
Now to say of Indian culture and Hindu culture and Muslim culture and other cultures,

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:44.380
it is most surprising that Kundalini

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:53.400
or we can say the Primordial Kundalini of the Virata has got all these great incarnations

00:10:53.440 --> 00:11:00.180
whether they were Muslims, whether they were Christians, whether they were Indians,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.300
seated on the chakras.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.520
For example, if you start from the Mooladhara Chakra upwards

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:15.760
then we have got on the second chakra, Swadishthan Chakra, Shri Brahmadeva

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:22.800
who is the creative power, creative aspect of God, and His power is Saraswati.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.580
You have seen that in Delhi you all were caught with Swadishthan Chakra.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.340
All of you have got this problem of Swadishthan Chakra

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.620
because Delhi is the place where we are planning too much

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:39.060
and the power of planning, the power of future thinking comes from Swadishthan Chakra,

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:44.860
and that’s how many of you are caught up with Swadishthan Chakra.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:52.340
The third chakra which is known as the Nabhi Chakra,

00:11:52.340 --> 00:12:04.560
actually it is known as Manipur Chakra, rests above this triangular bone

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:10.900
and it controls the solar plexus in the gross [physical] form in the human beings

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.780
and this is the chakra which represents our dharma, our religion.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.440
Now when I talk of religion immediately the modern mind will get after me saying that,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.420
“What are you talking of this, out of these things?”

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.860
When I say ‘dharma’ I mean “dareithi sadharma”)

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:34.220
it is human beings have got certain religion as everything has got religion.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.720
For example, you take a mango from the mango tree. If you plant it you will get the mango.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.580
Or else you can see as I told you yesterday that a gold bangle is gold

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.980
because it is not tarnishable, that is the dharma of gold.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:58.220
The water has got purification dharma. In the same way a human being has got his own dharma

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:02.320
which is expressed in the Bible as Ten Commandments.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:07.000
These are ten dharmas a human being is born with. He is born with it.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:16.820
But he has to establish himself into dharma when he has to go into dharmarthi state, is beyond that.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:19.260
But these ten must be established.

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.480
If you play about with them then this is a problem in your awakening and in your Realization.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:29.780
If you play about with them then this is a problem in your awakening and in your Realization.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:35.440
The Nabhi Chakra is the most important one and there

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:44.340
rests the great incarnation or we can say the aspect of God which we call as ‘Narayana’ Himself, Shri Vishnu,

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:49.000
and His power is Shri Lakshmi.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.180
Vishnu represents the sustenance, the dharma aspect of God.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.320
And Vishnu is responsible for the evolution of human beings.

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:06.200
We never find out why a amoeba has become a human being,

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.220
what has made him come up to the level of human being

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.880
and what is going to happen to this human being, after all why is he made a human being?

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.060
You are made for some purpose.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:23.660
What is going to happen to this human being afterwards, we never think of that.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:30.580
This evolutionary power comes to us through Shri Vishnu Himself.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.480
Shri Vishnu is not Hindu’s God. He does not belong to India;

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.200
he does not belong to one particular state or one particular area.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:47.400
He belongs in the Primordial Being,

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:53.220
in the great Primordial Being who we call as Islam we call it ‘Allah hu Akbar’.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:59.860
He is the expression of that Primordial Being who is great.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.640
God has many aspects and one of the aspects is of His greatness.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.860
And that’s why as Vishnu He wants us to be great.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:16.680
Yesterday, I told you that the body of Virata contains everything that He manifests

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:22.000
and we have to realize that we are a part and parcel of that great Virata.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:35.340
And that we are in the process of realizing Him because we are made in the image of God.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.000
Then comes the most important part of our body is the stomach.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.560
It represents the Bhavasagara, Is the maya in which we are placed.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:55.240
We are born in this Bhavasagara when Shri Vishnu Himself incarnates again and again.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.360
You have seen as matsyavatara and purvamavtara

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:07.520
and He Himself leads the human beings in their evolutionary path.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:22.540
He is helped by another Deity whom we call as ‘Primordial Guru’, the Adi Guru Dattatreya.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:33.140
Shri Vishnu rises from Bhavasagara and gives you the leadership to rise within yourself.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:40.280
He builds up your awareness step by step and today you are as a human being.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:47.200
In your being itself, He creates two more chakras one on the Hriday [Heart] Chakra

00:16:47.200 --> 00:17:03.620
and above that is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is placed here, which is called as the complete incarnation of Shri Krishna.

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:11.840
At the Vishuddhi Chakra, Shri Vishnu completes His incarnation, He is the complete Virata.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:16.840
He is represented here in the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:23.440
Whether He is there or not you can find out when the Kundalini is awakened.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:29.460
On the left-hand side are the Virata, in the heart resides Shiva Himself.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:42.000
Shiva is the symbol of God’s aspect of existence.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.720
It is Shiva who makes the whole manifestation to existence

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:51.680
and when He does not like the show, when He does not like the play, He switches off.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.620
That’s why He is also known as a destroyer.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:00.780
If he likes it, if it is moving in the right direction, He continues to watch the show.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:06.360
But if He does not like it, He just switches off.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.160
another of His creativity by Brahmadeva and the third one which is the evolutionary but which is based on Dharma itself.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:24.540
another of His creativity by Brahmadeva and the third one which is the evolutionary but which is based on Dharma itself.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.000
A one person can have three attitudes, can have three aspects.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.380
God has many more aspects but the aspects that are manifested are these three.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:42.040
Now these three aspects, the essence of these aspects or we can say the innocence of these three aspects

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:47.140
is combined in the Primordial Guru or the Adi Guru Dattatreya

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:54.120
who resides in the Bhavasagara and helps Shri Vishnu for your evolution.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:59.500
Now he has taken many incarnations, mainly ten incarnations,

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:05.540
and these are very important and we have to understand them in their full entirety.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:11.980
If you accept Him as a Dattatreya you have to also accept Him as Raja Janaka.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.580
It’s easy for Hindu mind to accept Raja Janaka but it cannot accept Mohammad Sahib

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:22.640
who was the same as Raja Janaka. It is a fact and you can prove it on your Kundalini.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:30.220
A person who is suffering from cancer of the stomach, now this is the thing when I say that Sahaja Yoga can

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:35.280
cure your cancer, you have to give up certain notions that we have in our head.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.960
A person, supposing he is a Hindu and he is suffering from the stomach cancer,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:45.580
I have to ask him to take the name of Mohammad Sahib.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:52.560
If I fail to ask him or if I do not convince him, I cannot cure his cancer.

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:58.080
I am sorry I tell him I just cannot do it. But if he is Muslim, I have to tell him,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.400
“You have to take the name of Dattatreya.”

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:14.880
Human beings like fools have taken away the living flowers of one tree and now are fighting on something that is dead.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.780
He was Dattatreya, there is no doubt about it.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.260
And His daughter Fatima was nobody else but Sita Janaki Herself.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:31.080
And Her two sons Hassan and Hussain were nobody else but Luv and Kush.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.700
They were born again and again. They were born as Mahavira and Buddha

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.820
and then they were born as Hassan and Hussain.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:50.660
It is only possible through Sahaja Yoga to realize that this is the truth, this is the fact.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:58.020
He was born as Nanaka and Nanaki was nobody else but Janaki

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:03.860
In Nanaka’s life He has expressed it. Of course, I don’t know how many people have read about Nanaka.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:09.280
Nanaka one day was sleeping and his feet were towards Kaaba

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.340
and people were getting vibrations from that side

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:17.640
so they said, “What are you doing? Your feet are towards Kaaba!”

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:21.120
So, he said, “Alright I will turn my feet on the other side”

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.580
and they started getting vibrations from the other side.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:29.700
They said, “What? Kaaba has moved or what?”

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.380
He has in a way, showed,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:36.060
but how dare they said many things?

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:41.600
When they said very few things, they have killed these people and tortured them.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.620
If you read Mohammad Sahib’s life you will feel

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.440
what foolish people we have been, the way we have tortured.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.300
For fanaticism, the way He was killed actually he was poisoned.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:22:00.200
He had no place where to hide his head the way people were after Him because He was telling the truth

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.240
and fanaticism is one thing He fought.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.380
So, Guru Tatva [principe] is killed as soon as you become a fanatic person.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:19.160
Your Guru Tatva is immediately finished as soon as you take to fanaticism of any kind.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:26.100
You come up now to the Heart Chakra. Heart Chakra is divided into three parts.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.180
In the centre of the Heart Chakra resides Jagadamba Herself.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:37.040
But the left side, as I have told you, resides Shiva and His power is Parvati.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:48.960
When Parvati Herself separates Her identity with Her lord and enters in the centre to save Her children

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:56.340
from the domination of the evil spirits, then She resides in the centre and She is the Jagadamba.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:01.000
This is called as ‘sacred heart’ in the Bible.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.180
She resides as Jagadamba. She has taken many incarnations to save.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:10.920
Today there was Lalita Panchami, they sang the song of Lalita,

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.020
the way She took Her incarnation to fight the evil forces

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:25.140
to save the bhaktas from the domination of satanic and depraving personalities.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.860
She is there within you also. If not awakened She can be awakened.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.880
She is all the time there to save you from those satanic forces.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:39.020
Today so many rakshasas have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:46.420
They are here as some of them call themselves “Gods” and “God’s men”.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:53.360
But from their behaviour and from their character, you can make out that they are not human beings, they are less than human beings.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.900
All such horrid incarnations have come in a camouflage, in the maya,

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:05.660
because this is Kali Yuga. Ravana is not going to come out as Ravana, he is not going to say, “I am Ravana”

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:11.740
but from his ideologies and from his methods, you can make out that he is “the Ravana”.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:21.040
There are challenging religion today. There are people who are preaching that sex should be used for sublimation into God.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.580
How can that be?

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.900
Sex has nothing to do with your awakening. Because sex point as I told you,

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.340
is much lower than the Mooladhara where your Mother resides.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.960
It’s such an absurd idea which has already taken over in the West.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:44.260
I don’t know how people have lost all their brains not to understand!

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.920
And such ideologies are today spreading in this country.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:56.080
And I want Justice Tatachari to put little pressure to the people who have made laws

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:02.860
to see that these horrid things do not come up, that they are not accepted by people.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:08.080
Because when you subject yourself to such horrible satanic forces,

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.680
they come to you as entities, they possess you, you get possessed.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.000
Then you start giving everything that you have.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:25.900
Whatever money you have, you give to them. Whatever attention you have, you give it to them.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:38.840
Ultimately you find out that they have now landed in the courts and now are enjoying some sentences for life.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:44.420
It is better that you should be all warned, that you must understand that a religious person,

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.660
a person who is really awakened, cannot take even a single pai from you.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:56.060
When you are so self-respecting, how can a person, the one who has got the blessing of God, will accept anything from you?

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.400
This is the way they satisfy your ego,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.520
that you feel that you have been able to purchase a religious personality.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.540
You cannot purchase God in the market. You must understand that.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.420
And when a person tries to satisfy your ego, by doing all these things,

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:18.920
you must know that it is…, it is an act which is adharmic.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.760
Man must understand that God is above everything.

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.900
It is his Grace that can take you there, you cannot do anything about Him.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:36.840
It is He who should pour his Grace onto you. What can the seed do when it wants to germinate? Nothing.

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:47.100
But to be there and the gardener pours his Grace, his love on that seed and it sprouts by itself.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:53.720
That is what ‘sahaja’ is. That means that it is born with you, like the seed you have to sprout.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:27:02.020
But you have to be very careful with those horrible destructive forces that have come in so many ways.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:06.520
I can tell you there are 16 rakshasas whom know have bin taken birth.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.740
Mahishasura is there, Narakasura is there, Ruktasura is there.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:15.880
There are 6 rakshasis who have taken birth. And you have no idea to what they are doing.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.460
They will do all kinds of tricks to convince you that they are godly people.

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:23.620
But must only ask for the Supreme,

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:29.800
for the last which is being described by so many sages like Markandeya, like Shankaracharya.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.840
We are so lucky that we have had such great people

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:40.400
who have elaborately said, who have clearly said that, “This is what is the supreme,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.660
ask for the reality and do not ask for something cheapish.”

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:51.720
You cannot cheapen God. You do not try to mold Him in your own small cups.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:28:09.080
Above that chakra as I told you on the right-hand side of the Heart Chakra is placed the Deity of Shri Rama and Sita.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:19.100
Now they are placed on the side because He was made to forget His power as Vishnu.

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:24.120
He became a human being in every way.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:33.420
He had to be a human being, every way. And that’s why He behaved in such a manner that He showed the maryada purushottama.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:38.620
He is on the right side. He is the ideal king about which the philosophers have told you.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:46.320
He is the person who does all the raja karan. He is the person who gives us the way the evolutionary stage,

00:28:46.320 --> 00:29:00.260
to which a person who is in this world and who is in position higher level of administration, should follow too.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:06.840
And He is maryada purushottama, Rama who is on the right-hand side. And you know His power is Sita.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.420
She is Adi Shakti who is born again and again.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:18.220
On the Vishuddhi Chakra rest the great Deity of Shri Krishna.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:25.020
He represents the Virata, the Akbar, Allah hu Akbar.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.680
He is represented here and this is the finger for Shri Krishna.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:36.000
Shri Krishna has manifested and has shown to Arjuna His Virata Swarupa, but Arjuna got frightened.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.460
Imagine that time it was not possible for Arjuna to see all that, he got frightened.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.820
Now in the Kali Yuga the time has come for you to see the Virata. You can

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.300
if you get your realization through Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:57.140
If you raise your awareness to that extent where you can see Virata, you can see that.

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:03.160
About Shri Krishna I need not say much, you all know about Him

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:10.980
but the essence of His life, the essence of His teachings was one simple thing that it is all a play going on.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.420
When you are complete, when you are sampurna,

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.060
then only you feel you are just a sakshi.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.760
When you are sakshi you are watching the whole thing.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:26.500
Here at this point you meet oneness with complete vairagnya within

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:31.000
and love outside. The vairagnya within flows that love outside.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.340
Actually, it’s such a wonderful thing it cannot be explained.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:39.020
For example, today’s puja filled me up with vibrations.

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:44.120
So many vibrations started flowing through my chakras that I didn’t know what to do,

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.260
then they started flowing out.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:52.860
That’s why yesterday I said that Sahaja Yoga teaches you how you become the capitalist of vibrations,

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.760
and when it flows out you know it is the communist

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:01.060
because you cannot help it. Once they are inside you want to give away,

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:09.340
you have to feed others with what you have got because you cannot carry on with that capital that you have achieved.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.860
You see it is so spontaneous and automatic that the release is necessary.

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.680
For example, if I have such a problem, I must meet my Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:27.180
If I don’t find them, I go to the sea and stand there and give my vibrations to the sea or to the tree or to the akasha

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:30.180
because I must give away, because they are working out

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.280
and they have to cross this finite being

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:37.040
in which the infinite is pushing through.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.520
It is such an interesting thing that when we say, “You press the feet of your parents

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:46.140
you get the blessings”, it is absolute truth because when you press the feet of your parents,

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:51.220
the chakras that move the vibrations, they come into us and they sooth us

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.040
while they feel sooth and we also feel sooth.

00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:00.480
Above this chakra is the Agnya Chakra, which is a very, very important chakra,

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.400
which is the door, which is the door of the Sahasrara.

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.800
At the Agnya Chakra resides Mahavishnu.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:19.140
Those who have read about Mahavishnu in the Markandeya Purana or in the Devi Bhagwat, you will know what I am talking about

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:24.600
but we do not know when He incarnated and who He was. He was nobody else but Jesus Christ.

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:31.040
Jesus Christ was the only son of Mary who was Radha. She was Mahalakshmi.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.920
It was Mahalakshmi who incarnated as Mary

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.800
and Jesus Christ was nobody else but Mahavishnu.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.360
If you want to know about Mahavishnu you must read Devi Bhagwat. There it’s described in all elaboration.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:46.540
But whether He is there or not, whether it’s a fact or not, can be seen

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.620
because, somebody’s Agnya Chakra is caught up,

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.400
we have to take the name of Jesus Christ.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:58.540
He is Omkar Swarup so you can even take the name of Omkara. But you have to take the name of Jesus Christ.

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:04.100
If you do not take His name, if you do not accept Him, I cannot open your Agnya Chakra.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:12.380
I am sorry but it is so. Because for Hindus it’s very difficult to accept and for Christians it is very difficult to accept the other side of it.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:17.520
You see, whether you accept it or not that’s a fact.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:22.460
Because of your secluded temperaments, because of your limited energies,

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:33.260
because of your I should say a very narrow vision of God and religion, you cannot accept the truth which is so wide and so great.

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:39.440
But it’s a fact and it’s to be seen. In the Agnya Chakra, He resides.

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:46.400
He controls your ego and superego both. He removes the entities that are in you

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.560
and He kills your darpa, your ego.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.860
He looks after your ego also. If you bend before somebody who is not a realized soul,

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.660
who is just doing anadhikar chestha,

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:06.060
unauthorized, He is asking. You are serviliant  or you are subjection; He gets angry

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:13.500
and that’s how the Agnya Chakra closes down. Agnya chakra is in the center of the optic thalamus of the human beings

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:20.380
and is one of the most important things and once it opens out it’s much easier for you to get your realization.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:24.520
Among you there are at least 50% people who are already realized,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.720
who know how to handle the Kundalini, who have mastered the Kundalini.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.860
So, when I am telling you is just a repetition but there are many new comers

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.640
that’s why I have to tell them about it.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:39.880
The last is the most important, is the limbic area where resides the Sahasrara.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:45.340
There are 982 nerves in our brain and there are 8 other nerves

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.620
so we can say that there are 1000 nerves.

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:53.080
There is no use quarreling with these doctors because they will be all the time fighting with you and telling you,

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:58.220
“No, no, it is not so. No, it is not so.” But they will never come and see. Because we have cured cancer,

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.620
we have cured so many people, they will never come and see it.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.180
We have so many doctors who have been realized now

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.780
and who accept that Sahaja Yoga is the only way the cancer can be cured.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:12.700
But still they are not going to accept it because the ego is too much.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:18.040
How are they going to accept it because that’s what they are depending on And now they have to accept,

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:24.140
they have to jump to something. Are they going to accept Christ? Are they going to accept Ganesha?

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:27.420
Oh God, that’s too much for scientists to accept Shri Ganesha

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:36.820
because Christ is the human incarnation of Shri Ganesha. He is the embodiment of eternal childhood.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:45.620
In the Sahasrara we are the integration of all these chakras which we call as the seven peethas. They are placed there

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:50.920
and because of this integration in the Sahasrara one has to workout on the Sahasrara.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.560
Now the Sahasrara opening happened when, 1970,

00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.980
when I saw how one can handle all these 7 chakras in the Sahasrara.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:08.860
Here resides Shri Bhagvati who coordinates, cooperates with those seven chakras in such a

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:17.980
manner that all the permutations and combinations of these 7 chakras can be worked out in the Sahasrara.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:24.140
Once She works it on that, She can give you the realization too and that’s how we have got 7 chakras.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:30.120
On top of this there are 3 more abstract forms in which one has to rise.

00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.180
Above this is the trikona which is the brain,

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:42.320
above that lies the ardha matra, as they call it, then the bindu, and then the, they call it the varthuna.(valaya?????)

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.620
But the thing is all these things I am talking about should not mean anything to you

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.780
unless and until you have achieved something because this all you can read in the books.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.040
I am not here to give you some books

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.780
and you know that so far I have not written books and I don’t know

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.200
if I am really going to complete the so called book I am writing. yourself.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:06.460
Because once you write the book, people start getting involved into it so much that they do not ask for the reality.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.860
So, you first see the reality.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:13.460
Now all over the world, there are Sahaja Yogis who have seen the Kundalini rising,

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.560
who has mastered the Kundalini, who know what is happening

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:21.500
because after realization you start feeling it on your fingers.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.160
You feel the Chaitanya Lahari coming into you

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:28.140
but not only that, it’s not only that the Chaitanya Lahari starts coming

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:34.260
but it is the communication is established with the all-pervading power, with God,

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.540
and you start feeling on the fingers what is the problem of the other person.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:44.880
For example, if you place your hand towards a person and you feel burning here you know it’s a Agnya Chakra.

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:50.620
Now for a person who is novice, who is recently come for the first time, who places his hand,

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.880
he will say this is the finger. Even a child can say that.

00:37:53.880 --> 00:38:00.400
My granddaughter who is a born realized soul she can just say like this, you know from the distance she tells me nani yeh hai.

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:08.080
Now she knows the names also! So, the communication is given to you silently: it burns you, it makes you uneasy,

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:12.780
sometimes you feel the throbbing, sometimes you feel something is flowing in. That’s how you know.

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:18.980
It is a subjective knowledge for this you do not need to go to school. Everybody knows if it is burning, they saw it is the finger that is burning.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:24.360
But I am here to decode all that, to tell you and then you verify it, you tally it

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.020
and find out if it is so or not.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:35.040
Not only that you feel the other person but with that you can raise the Kundalini of another person.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.540
With the raising of the Kundalini you can remove the problems that are physical, emotional and mental.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:45.840
By giving them Realization, you can remove their spiritual problems

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:50.500
and that’s how they enter also into the Kingdom of God where there is communication.
