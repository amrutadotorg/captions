00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:12.168
The greatest advantage of Sahaja
Yoga is that you can enjoy everything.

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.289
That is the greatest advantage,

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:22.855
whether it is art, architecture, music, 
or a lecture, or studies, education,

00:00:22.936 --> 00:00:27.070
family life, everything you should 
be able to enjoy fully.

00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:33.631
Then you are a real Sahaja yogi
and that you have achieved that state.

00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:38.709
Sometimes there are problems, here and 
there, something happens, doesn't matter.

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:46.791
Have faith, and you will be surprised 
at the miracles that you get.

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:49.877
One after another, so many miracles,

00:00:49.957 --> 00:00:54.699
but listen to Me and also try 
to follow what I say.

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:59.096
First of all, no temper. Temper if you have,

00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:02.499
you must know that it's a serious thing in
the West

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.506
because there's no controlling power
over temper,

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:12.545
and schizophrenia is the only
ultimate result of temper, schizophrenia.

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:16.146
So temper should not be justified.

00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:20.774
All ego, temper should be brought down.

00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:26.380
One should not try in any way to get angry with others

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.859
because of jealousy, because of 
complexes, because of anything.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.056
If it is so, please introspect, 
"Why do I get into tempers?"

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.118
Shri Krishna has placed temper as the worst disease
of all,

00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:48.039
He said from there it rises everything. 
But I don't agree with Him because,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.707
you see, it must be, He was, for Him
it's a leela, the whole world is a leela,

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:54.961
but not for everyone.

00:01:55.042 --> 00:02:01.565
Temper can come from Mooladhara, can come 
from Swadishtana, can come from anywhere.

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:04.632
So one cannot say that the source of temper

00:02:04.712 --> 00:02:09.301
is going to be the source of all the problems.

00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:15.101
Can be from anything. One can really get destroyed by anything,

00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:20.294
but temper is one thing that is the worst
of all.

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.707
So, if you find anybody who is hot tempered,

00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:28.121
if you find yourself to be hot tempered,

00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:34.512
then please see to it that you overcome it.

00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:38.072
I used to tell before, I don't know now, 
there must be My tapes

00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:42.381
that if you are very angry, then stand
before the mirror and say all kinds of things.

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:49.401
Or else you take a pillow and hit it
hard when you are in temper.

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:52.052
Close the door, hit the pillow and then go out.

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:57.978
You may have to spend for another pillow, doesn't matter.

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:07.828
So you develop a very, I should say, a pleasing personality.

00:03:07.914 --> 00:03:13.439
That's very important. You must have a very pleasing
personality.

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.781
But that is not acceptable in certain countries

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:26.779
because it's said that you should not show 
your, any pleasing personality,

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.366
because others will think you are weak.

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:34.809
The strength is your joy. 
Strength is your virtue.

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.956
Strength is your pleasing personality.

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:42.257
That is your strength. And this, 
artificially, some people say that

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:47.141
if you become very pleasing and this and
that, then others will think you are weak.

00:03:47.221 --> 00:03:52.631
If they think, let them think like that. 
That is their stupidity.

00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:57.421
So you should be happy, 
joyous, pleasing.
