00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:38.643
This is a special month in India

00:01:39.492 --> 00:01:45.212
and it is nice that we are organizing this program during this month

00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:47.922
called as the Margasheersha,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.948
means where Marga means the road and Sheersha is the head,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.210
which leads you to the Epitome,

00:02:02.212 --> 00:02:06.648
that's the month. And in this month they worship

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:11.356
Guru because of His birthday of Dattatreya

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:15.363
and also they worship Mahalakshmi.

00:02:18.136 --> 00:02:22.812
That means this is the month of Shushumna,

00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:28.129
where the people get out of

00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:36.659
the bondages of smaller hankerings

00:02:38.498 --> 00:02:43.934
and enter into a new path of seeking

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:48.521
of Spirituality  that is Shushumna that is Mahalakshmi.

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:59.017
Also on this, there are lots of  Pujas

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.035
they do for four Thursdays,  the Puja of Mahalakshmi

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:10.523
because Mahalakshmi is worshipped on a Thursday

00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:14.760
as it is the essence of the Guru principle.

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:22.140
The Gurus have to satisfy the Mahalakshmi

00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:26.317
principle, which is just pure seeking of God,

00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:29.406
or what do you call the Shuddha Ichha.

00:03:31.845 --> 00:03:39.390
Today is the Saturday as I enquired and the Puja was done in Poona

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.161
was also  on Thursday.

00:03:46.907 --> 00:03:51.730
Thursday puja was the thing of the Mahalakshmi's Puja is started.

00:03:52.373 --> 00:03:56.555
The day we did  puja in Mahalakshmi, there,

00:03:56.897 --> 00:04:04.130
you saw hole  the water was giving away its exuberance

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:10.528
by putting up miraculous fountains.

00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:14.342
And they became the clouds I believe

00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:19.310
because I heard at the time of the puja

00:04:20.643 --> 00:04:24.567
rain started in Rahuri and it rained and rained and rained.

00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:29.630
And now this country which is under drought,

00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:33.277
people  don't even have water to drink we have rain.

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:40.448
So the whole thing works out according to the calendar

00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:44.843
which is devised by God, not by human beings.

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:48.967
So today is an another day of Saturday,

00:04:50.181 --> 00:04:54.956
where we are sitting on the bank of Krishna river.

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:57.557
See how it works out?

00:04:57.946 --> 00:05:01.572
Krishna river represents the power of Shri Krishna.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.258
So the Mahalakshmi Tattwa has to go to the Krishna's state,

00:05:11.502 --> 00:05:15.561
of the witness state and that's how we are here today

00:05:15.823 --> 00:05:19.982
on this special occasion in Brahmapuri,

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.591
also the word Brahmapuri means where you feel the Brahma,

00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:28.028
the Chaitanya which you can feel it on this earth.

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:37.451
So when we are touring we are actually also internally, moving.

00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:43.271
Also there is Anthar Yoga which you are achieving.

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:47.800
So you should not mind little, little things here and there

00:05:48.316 --> 00:05:51.284
but enjoy every bit of it.

00:05:51.752 --> 00:05:55.054
Yesterday also I was happy you all danced

00:05:55.531 --> 00:05:59.983
because yesterday was the day of Shakti, was the Friday.

00:06:00.582 --> 00:06:04.889
On the day of Shakti if you dance you will get that power within yourself.

00:06:05.432 --> 00:06:09.520
And that's why you are looking much better now.

00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:15.097
In My name if you dance you get the power, no doubt about it.

00:06:15.994 --> 00:06:20.818
And that's why here you have to achieve your Spiritual power,

00:06:21.534 --> 00:06:25.626
your Spiritual peace and your Spiritual love.

00:06:27.452 --> 00:06:30.602
All these things if you can achieve in India

00:06:30.991 --> 00:06:34.739
you have done full justice to Me and to yourself.

00:06:36.477 --> 00:06:40.143
It is not just a picnic or an outing, nothing of the kind,

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.901
and working out internally all of you, now I am sure it will work out.

00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:52.637
So have loving attitude towards all the other people

00:06:53.265 --> 00:06:59.406
who are here, who are feeling lots of love for you

00:06:59.976 --> 00:07:04.252
and they pay lot of attention, they don't want you to do any hard work

00:07:04.459 --> 00:07:07.971
they want to look after you but you also try to make friends

00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:12.482
and try to know them, hardly you know their names, hardly,

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:15.884
you write to them. That's not proper.

00:07:16.186 --> 00:07:18.509
So at least those who have been here many a times,

00:07:18.724 --> 00:07:20.787
should try to know the names of the people,

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:23.999
take their addresses and they may also write to you

00:07:24.253 --> 00:07:25.948
and you may also write to them.

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:29.171
So that you maintain a proper correspondence.

00:07:30.242 --> 00:07:32.830
So this relationship, of friendship and love

00:07:33.365 --> 00:07:35.979
must be started as Shri Krishna has said

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:39.550
that unless and until you love each other

00:07:40.466 --> 00:07:42.537
I do not exist with in you.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.365
So it is not only one country, it is not many countries,

00:07:46.545 --> 00:07:49.905
it's all the countries of the world have to love each other

00:07:50.135 --> 00:07:53.099
and to understand each other as yogis.

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:55.937
You are all yogis and to be appreciated.

00:07:56.366 --> 00:08:00.940
They are already singing the praises of you since long

00:08:01.612 --> 00:08:05.794
and now it is time to prove it.

00:08:06.572 --> 00:08:09.810
The other day I described to them the procession

00:08:10.188 --> 00:08:14.177
that was described by one of the English poets

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.372
in his vision he saw our procession and when I told them

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.511
they are very happy that already an English poet like Lewis could

00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:26.851
see these points and written in such details the whole description.

00:08:27.177 --> 00:08:30.565
But that book has not arrived in India, Vision.  It is a beautiful book

00:08:30.867 --> 00:08:34.642
and I would request the Australians to, if possible

00:08:34.928 --> 00:08:37.640
to make some copies of that and handed it over,

00:08:37.871 --> 00:08:40.418
at least the typed copies,

00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:44.272
in Southara or in Sangli somehow if you have the book with you

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:48.267
and give it to them. They will be very happy, know all about it.

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:55.625
That will be a special present to the people of Ganapatipule.

00:08:56.068 --> 00:09:01.420
If you could give the exact,  book

00:09:01.871 --> 00:09:05.468
then somebody can do it in Southara and can do it in one day  in India

00:09:05.698 --> 00:09:08.634
these things can be done very easily in India.

00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:11.557
We don't book things as you have to book.

00:09:11.747 --> 00:09:15.009
We have started but not so much of booking this year.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.580
So I request you do that much,

00:09:17.803 --> 00:09:21.000
give the book to these people, so they will bring it printed

00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:23.373
and everybody can have it.
