PRACTICAL UNDERSTANDING OF COLLECTIVITY

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.634
1. MEANING OF COLLECTIVITY

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.225
Collectivity doesn’t mean that we all
should be stuck together

00:00:28.426 --> 00:00:35.216
with some glue or something or we all
become like Gibraltar,

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.868
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean
that.

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:46.138
 It means wherever you are, you are
connected. That is collectivity.

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:50.648
But if you are not connected and you are
just glued together,

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:56.785
it’s very inconvenient to live under such
circumstances.

00:00:56.986 --> 00:01:02.471
I think, people don’t even understand
the meaning of collectivity

00:01:02.672 --> 00:01:09.547
where there’s not the other, Ananya. Where
there’s not the other,

00:01:09.748 --> 00:01:13.513
there’s no other personality.

00:01:14.964 --> 00:01:23.570
These personalities are separated from you
because of left and right.

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:27.044
Or could be both.

00:01:29.264 --> 00:01:35.634
But you are yourself fully when you are
absolutely detached

00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:43.886
and your Kundalini is dancing – you’re
alone and never alone.

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:54.329
This oneness with the whole

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.964
gives you all the security that you want,
all the joy you want.

00:02:04.217 --> 00:02:11.778
And that’s why Kundalini Awakening means
"collectivity".

00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:21.964
Unless and until you want pure collectivity
in your being, Kundalini won’t rise.

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:28.849
2. ONE BIG FAMILY

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:41.788
So now, let us see how do we miss out
on collectivity.

00:02:44.028 --> 00:02:50.063
There’s a very practical down-to-earth
understanding.

00:02:50.264 --> 00:02:56.232
First we must know without collectivity we
cannot exist.

00:02:56.433 --> 00:03:02.062
As the body has to be in connection with
the brain,

00:03:02.263 --> 00:03:08.710
in the same way, without collectivity
Sahaja Yoga cannot exist.

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.609
Once you understand that, then you have
to work it out

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.513
that collectivity is absolutely
established, within and without.

00:03:21.714 --> 00:03:29.754
I do not know what thing comes first
in the human mind about another person,

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:36.139
but the first thing is that these are your
real relations

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.186
and nobody else are your relations.

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:46.634
These children are your children

00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:52.236
and these men are your brothers, and these
ladies are your sisters,

00:03:52.437 --> 00:03:56.961
and we are one big family together.

00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:03.045
We are part and parcel of one body,

00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:09.371
and this hand cannot hit another hand,
thank God it doesn’t think,

00:04:09.572 --> 00:04:14.976
otherwise as human beings they might start
thinking against another hand,

00:04:15.177 --> 00:04:20.772
but they don’t because they are connected
to one brain activity.

00:04:22.672 --> 00:04:27.445
3. PURE RELATIONSHIPS

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.955
So, we can see that when we ascend
in the collective consciousness

00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:42.316
and we have collective living, collective
meeting,

00:04:44.329 --> 00:04:52.167
at the Vishuddhi Chakra Shri Krishna
established this, or He manifested

00:04:52.368 --> 00:04:57.184
this pure relationship of a sister.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.646
In a collective life that we have,

00:05:08.953 --> 00:05:14.709
in the Ashram where we live, where we move
about as Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.867
if we do not have this basic principle
within us,

00:05:22.177 --> 00:05:26.299
there will be a chaos, complete chaos.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.491
Once this purity of relationship is
established,

00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:39.215
that apart from my wife, all the rest are
my sisters or mothers,

00:05:43.948 --> 00:05:47.100
it cannot be

00:05:51.550 --> 00:06:02.885
a proper society and the chaos
of the social system of America

00:06:03.086 --> 00:06:09.666
is because they have no sense of pure
relationships.

00:06:10.732 --> 00:06:14.834
Once you call somebody a sister, she is
the sister.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.779
 And once you call somebody a brother,
she is (he is) a brother.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.029
It's not only that you should be born
of the same parents, it's not necessary,

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.389
but this is a very important principle

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:37.725
to have a very pure society where everybody
can live peacefully.

00:06:39.968 --> 00:06:44.929
4. TURMOIL AND PEACE

00:06:47.294 --> 00:06:54.184
Think of the tree which is, say,
in a turmoil or during earthquake:

00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:59.604
it won’t grow. When the earthquake stops,

00:06:59.805 --> 00:07:05.829
everything becomes quiet, everything is
peaceful, then only the tree can grow.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:12.449
In the same way, our growth can only take
place if we are peaceful within ourselves.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:20.433
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider
and rising higher and higher,

00:07:20.634 --> 00:07:25.892
first thing is we must have peace within
ourselves.

00:07:26.093 --> 00:07:31.371
But this peace is possible if you can make
really peace with others.

00:07:31.572 --> 00:07:36.624
If you cannot make peace with others who
are in Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:36.825 --> 00:07:43.432
who are in the collective, if you are in
a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise.

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:47.606
That is why collectivity is so important.

00:07:47.807 --> 00:07:52.014
Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot
open,

00:07:52.215 --> 00:08:00.509
and without collectivity you cannot have
the growth of your spirituality.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:07.003
It’s the growth of the spirituality: as
they say, the Tree of Life is upside-down

00:08:07.204 --> 00:08:16.128
and the roots are in the brain, and this
Kundalini has to go and water that brain,

00:08:16.347 --> 00:08:21.644
as we water the roots. Then it starts
flowing downward,

00:08:21.845 --> 00:08:24.986
and that’s how you start expanding.

00:08:26.904 --> 00:08:32.148
5. COMPASSION AND LOVE

00:08:33.717 --> 00:08:36.557
Now Mother has said we have to have
compassion, well now where do we

00:08:36.758 --> 00:08:41.095
have our compassion, on the walls? Where
do we use our compassion?

00:08:41.296 --> 00:08:44.389
Where do we use our compassion?

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:47.985
So Sahaja Yoga is to be practiced, doesn’t
mean that you sit down

00:08:48.186 --> 00:08:51.811
with My photograph all the time, doesn’t
mean that.

00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:59.448
It means you practice compassion; you
practice that.

00:09:01.076 --> 00:09:06.182
Then you have to practice love. Now how do
you practice love with others?

00:09:06.383 --> 00:09:12.941
If you love someone, what do you do? You
try to please that person.

00:09:13.142 --> 00:09:16.705
Small things can make people very happy.

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:20.284
I know, you all try to please Me very much,
you’ll give Me presents,

00:09:20.485 --> 00:09:22.774
you’ll find out things which are good
for Me,

00:09:22.975 --> 00:09:25.804
you’ll go out of the way buy sweet flowers
for Me,

00:09:26.005 --> 00:09:31.446
beautiful things you do to please Me.
I am over-pleased, I must tell you.

00:09:31.647 --> 00:09:35.661
But I am more pleased, much more pleased

00:09:35.862 --> 00:09:40.622
if you understand collectivity and try
to please each other.

00:09:40.845 --> 00:09:46.376
So now the practice love, where do you
practice? Ask you a question:

00:09:46.577 --> 00:09:52.441
where do I practice love? What do I love?

00:09:52.642 --> 00:09:58.891
We live, love our house, we love our
photographs, our decorations, everything,

00:09:59.092 --> 00:10:09.177
but do I practice this love on my wife, or
on my husband, or on other Sahaja yogis?

00:10:11.437 --> 00:10:16.386
6. DEVELOPMENT OF PATIENCE

00:10:18.293 --> 00:10:25.841
In our Sahaj culture we have to practice
compassion and love,

00:10:28.142 --> 00:10:32.384
and thirdly we have to practice patience.

00:10:32.585 --> 00:10:39.075
I know some children are maybe little more
mischievous, some are less mischievous.

00:10:39.276 --> 00:10:45.251
Maybe some people are very talkative,
sometimes really they give Me also headache;

00:10:45.452 --> 00:10:49.295
they go on talking, talking, talking,
talking, so much!

00:10:49.496 --> 00:10:55.046
Sometimes I think it’s good because it’s
a rest for My mouth –

00:10:55.927 --> 00:11:00.047
one way of looking at it. Another way of
looking at it is just switch off your mind,

00:11:00.248 --> 00:11:04.549
let him talk, take it out whatever he wants
to talk.

00:11:04.824 --> 00:11:11.535
Once he is finished with it and fagged out
then he won’t bother you much

00:11:11.736 --> 00:11:16.773
and also he’ll feel satisfied that somebody
has listened to his prattles.

00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:23.368
So patience is needed and patience is
needed in such a way

00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:26.443
that others should see your patience.

00:11:26.693 --> 00:11:29.822
Yesterday for example, I was sitting
for about, I think, three hours

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:37.165
shaking hands with all sorts of people
and all types of problems,

00:11:37.366 --> 00:11:40.143
and the person who came last, he said,

00:11:40.344 --> 00:11:45.605
“Looking at Your patience, I develop my own
patience.”

00:11:47.868 --> 00:11:55.716
And love gives you patience. This love
nourishes you.

00:11:55.917 --> 00:12:00.546
I’m telling you, it’s absolutely
down-to-earth method:

00:12:00.747 --> 00:12:06.270
here I’ve not mentioned that you trust God,
I’m just saying trust yourself,

00:12:06.471 --> 00:12:11.078
absolutely down-to-earth because we are
talking about your brain.

00:12:12.917 --> 00:12:18.025
7. EXPLOITATION AND RESPECT

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:29.782
So, today's understanding should be that we
all should become collective from inside.

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:38.210
We should not grudge or grumble about
everything and enjoy the collectivity.

00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:44.036
But the second side of collectivity is
this, that do not try

00:12:44.237 --> 00:12:48.760
to exploit the collectivity, otherwise,
you'll be in trouble.

00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:52.762
Like, I've seen some people don't know how
to use their bathrooms.

00:12:52.963 --> 00:13:02.992
When you are collective you have to be
respecting the collectivity of others.

00:13:03.911 --> 00:13:11.007
 By your presence another person should
not, by any chance, suffer,

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:24.322
or should not feel in any way insulted
or inconvenienced.

00:13:25.253 --> 00:13:28.463
So when you are in the collective it should
be such that

00:13:28.664 --> 00:13:36.027
another person should enjoy your company,
enjoy your being there.

00:13:36.228 --> 00:13:43.499
That is something where there is
no problem.

00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:50.156
But if you are demanding, and if you are
asking for things

00:13:50.357 --> 00:13:55.108
and you think no end of yourself, you
cannot at all collective, by any chance,

00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:58.815
but you'll suffer for that,

00:14:00.594 --> 00:14:04.362
automatically you will suffer.

00:14:05.252 --> 00:14:12.396
If this is realized and understood
properly, your Agnya is solved.

00:14:14.593 --> 00:14:19.490
8. ANGER AND FORGIVENESS

00:14:21.405 --> 00:14:25.775
Like anger.

00:14:28.398 --> 00:14:34.892
There are people always boast, "I'm very
angry with him." Boast.

00:14:36.852 --> 00:14:43.164
But just make that anger into forgiveness
and you'll see the person,

00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:48.814
instead of you getting into problems,
he will get into problems.

00:14:49.015 --> 00:14:57.730
Anger will upset you, but forgiveness will
upset him, automatically.

00:14:57.931 --> 00:15:02.317
It's the biggest weapon you have got –
is to forgive.

00:15:02.518 --> 00:15:07.281
And this is shown in Buddha's character
throughout.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.967
Now we have been saying that we have
to forgive everyone,

00:15:14.168 --> 00:15:21.446
but we don’t practice that. Small, small
things like mad people we remember.

00:15:21.647 --> 00:15:25.108
I mean, only I have heard that snake has
this capacity

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:27.561
to remember if somebody has hurt him,

00:15:27.762 --> 00:15:31.496
but here I find human beings have no less
capacity.

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:34.664
Whatever has happened 13 years back,
15 years back

00:15:34.865 --> 00:15:38.181
they all remember each and every thing:
whatever has hurt them,

00:15:38.405 --> 00:15:42.200
but how they have hurt others they don’t
remember,

00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:45.883
how they have been nasty to others they
don’t remember,

00:15:46.084 --> 00:15:51.496
because this is a human mind which has got
the ego,

00:15:51.697 --> 00:15:57.225
it can go on hurting others, it doesn’t
feel anything, and the superego

00:15:57.426 --> 00:16:02.746
which goes on receiving all the hurts and
always complaining about it.

00:16:04.572 --> 00:16:09.442
9. CRITICISM AND BUMPTIOUSNESS

00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:18.040
Don’t criticize the collectivity, till I
Myself find it out and I’ll put it right.

00:16:18.241 --> 00:16:23.909
Keep to the collectivity wisely and
earnestly,

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:29.561
and try to keep the collectivity together.

00:16:31.202 --> 00:16:35.701
Try to help to keep the people collective,
to enjoy together.

00:16:35.902 --> 00:16:39.335
Don’t criticize each other.

00:16:39.536 --> 00:16:44.033
Only criticize yourself if you are
in the habit of criticism,

00:16:44.234 --> 00:16:49.533
better criticize yourself, it’s better;
because these are habits also.

00:16:49.734 --> 00:16:54.386
People, specially I have seen people
in the West, they react to everything.

00:16:54.587 --> 00:16:57.577
If they see this carpet, “Oh, I don’t
like it.”

00:16:57.778 --> 00:17:01.135
But this is not yours, you’ve not paid for
you, what have you got to do with it?

00:17:01.336 --> 00:17:05.354
“No, I don’t like it.” But it’s not yours;

00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:09.866
what’s the question? It’s lying here, why
should you be so upset about it?

00:17:10.067 --> 00:17:15.334
“I don’t like that person. I don’t like
that dress.”

00:17:15.615 --> 00:17:18.569
Who are you?

00:17:19.253 --> 00:17:22.229
“I don’t like.”

00:17:23.998 --> 00:17:29.370
This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga,
“I don’t like.”

00:17:30.404 --> 00:17:40.019
There is a way of saying things; but there
is no need to say anything whatsoever.

00:17:44.383 --> 00:17:51.995
So all this kind of bumptiousness and
showing off is against collectivity.

00:17:53.979 --> 00:17:58.955
10. JEALOUSY AND APPRECIATION

00:18:00.865 --> 00:18:08.247
So try to appreciate everything. Children
are producing pictures, paintings, any way.

00:18:08.448 --> 00:18:13.003
They make sometimes My face is very funny
when they draw –

00:18:13.204 --> 00:18:17.629
not the children, even grownups. Doesn’t
matter, I appreciate it, it’s very good,

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:22.303
wonderful, very nice, to encourage that
person.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:30.206
So criticism should go out of our mind,
but appreciation should be practiced:

00:18:30.407 --> 00:18:36.036
appreciation of others’ children,
appreciation of other people

00:18:36.237 --> 00:18:41.140
is very important but that doesn’t mean
that you appreciate all others

00:18:41.341 --> 00:18:47.852
and torture your wife or torture your
husband – that also is an imbalance.

00:18:48.053 --> 00:18:53.878
First responsibility is your family but you
should appreciate others,

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:59.073
and this comes when you have no jealousies
about anyone.

00:18:59.274 --> 00:19:01.538
This jealousy, I don’t know from where
it comes,

00:19:01.739 --> 00:19:07.045
so I don’t know this quality of jealousy,
why there is jealousy.

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:12.615
So, also if you have jealousy you have
to use it for the right purpose,

00:19:12.816 --> 00:19:16.616
and what is the right purpose is that you
should be jealous of a person

00:19:16.817 --> 00:19:22.335
who is spiritually higher than you, and you
practice it that you become better.

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:26.807
If jealousy is for competition, then you
compete with the person

00:19:27.008 --> 00:19:36.250
who is more compassionate, more loving,
more sacrificing, more patient.

00:19:38.127 --> 00:19:41.598
So this competition becomes a very healthy
competition

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:46.175
and the collectivity becomes very
nourished.

00:19:48.176 --> 00:19:53.214
11. AGGRESSIVENESS AND HIMULITY

00:19:54.986 --> 00:20:00.145
Now the worst enemy of collectivity is
aggressiveness.

00:20:00.346 --> 00:20:06.220
Some people are basically aggressive; their
style of talking is extremely aggressive,

00:20:06.421 --> 00:20:10.763
the way they say things is aggressive.
May be because anything,

00:20:10.964 --> 00:20:17.999
may be they are better educated, may be
they come from a very aggressive family,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.444
may be they are having a kind
of a superiority complex

00:20:23.645 --> 00:20:30.865
or an inferiority complex or a sense
of insecurity, or maybe they are possessed.

00:20:31.066 --> 00:20:38.803
They try to dominate and show their very
strong feelings towards people –

00:20:39.004 --> 00:20:45.526
of superiority. They may be inferior, it’s
not necessary,

00:20:45.727 --> 00:20:51.006
but they do and this is something is to be
curbed.

00:20:51.207 --> 00:20:58.213
So what you have to practice here is
humility. Try to be humble.

00:20:59.315 --> 00:21:05.415
Humility is that in no way you try
to aggress others,

00:21:05.616 --> 00:21:11.887
and if others are aggressive you accept it
 as a childish thing, as a stupid thing,

00:21:12.087 --> 00:21:20.169
as a foolish thing, has no meaning: because
you are so powerful, you can bear it.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:28.360
That is humility which you have to practice
and all these qualities if you have,

00:21:29.638 --> 00:21:35.892
you will really be surprised that you will
lose your selfishness.

00:21:37.666 --> 00:21:42.447
12. COLLECTIVE TEMPERAMENT

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:49.618
Only way to grow is to be collective.
There’s no other way out.

00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:53.719
If people think that by staying away
from ashrams,

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.351
alone living somewhere they will achieve
much

00:21:57.552 --> 00:22:02.264
- that’s not the way Sahaja Yoga is meant.

00:22:02.465 --> 00:22:09.806
Formerly, people used to go to Himalayas
and most of them were separated

00:22:10.007 --> 00:22:16.211
and only one or two persons were chosen
for spiritual growth.

00:22:16.412 --> 00:22:19.664
Here it is not question of spiritual
growth,

00:22:19.865 --> 00:22:26.021
 it’s a question of your collectivity
growing in you.

00:22:26.226 --> 00:22:33.748
That is how you become a person who is
collective, who enjoys collective,

00:22:33.949 --> 00:22:38.599
who works on collective and lives
with collective.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:47.372
Such a person develops new kind of powers.

00:22:49.305 --> 00:22:55.466
And these powers are such that they are
very subtle,

00:22:55.667 --> 00:23:06.262
but they penetrate into any molecule, atom
or human beings, anywhere.

00:23:06.463 --> 00:23:10.525
And their penetration is only possible if
you have

00:23:10.726 --> 00:23:14.214
a temperament which is collective.

00:23:14.415 --> 00:23:21.531
Without being fully collective, you cannot
achieve

00:23:22.293 --> 00:23:27.882
that height which is very necessary today
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:30.494 --> 00:23:35.515
13. INDIVIDUALISM AND INTEGRATION

00:23:37.175 --> 00:23:46.464
Question: “Shri Mother, we feel the same
chakras, more on legs than on the fingers.”

00:23:46.665 --> 00:23:52.102
Shri Mataji: The integration is not there,
that’s why. You have to attend collectively.

00:23:52.303 --> 00:23:56.012
You have to become more collective.
The body has to be collective.

00:23:56.213 --> 00:24:00.090
The thing is if you don't, if you are not
a collective person then sometimes

00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:03.418
you’ll feel them on the legs, sometimes
on the hand, sometimes in the head.

00:24:03.619 --> 00:24:06.639
That’s not a good thing. You should try
to become more collective,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:12.992
you should meet more people, take more
interest. You see, the body of your’s

00:24:13.193 --> 00:24:21.179
won't work out efficiently unless and
until you use it.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:27.075
Because individually, you see if they,
individually if you work out,

00:24:27.276 --> 00:24:33.666
it will not develop collectively, because
where are you using it?

00:24:33.867 --> 00:24:38.462
You are correcting yourself to give it
to others. And if you don’t give it,

00:24:38.663 --> 00:24:45.511
if you do not work it out in a collective
way, there is no circulation.

00:24:47.446 --> 00:24:52.288
14. COLLECTIVE MEDITATION

00:24:53.896 --> 00:25:00.381
Meditating together is the best way to feel
the collectivity.

00:25:00.582 --> 00:25:03.904
You can meditate at home, of course, you
also cleanse it for your depth,

00:25:04.105 --> 00:25:07.910
but also you must meditate together and
when you meditate together

00:25:08.111 --> 00:25:13.596
then the strength that you have strengthens
others,

00:25:13.797 --> 00:25:18.059
and the strength of the whole collectivity
improves so much.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.721
We are meditating together is a very big
thing.

00:25:21.922 --> 00:25:26.331
Everyone has to understand that whenever
you get time you find out

00:25:26.532 --> 00:25:30.935
in the morning times, for example, we’ll go
to the ashram and meditate.

00:25:31.136 --> 00:25:34.404
Say, Sunday morning, we’ll just go and
meditate in the ashram.

00:25:34.605 --> 00:25:38.014
Just for meditation you have to come.
Meditate and go away

00:25:38.215 --> 00:25:41.996
because I reside in this ashram, I am here,

00:25:42.197 --> 00:25:45.928
so leave your homes, come here and
meditate.

00:25:46.113 --> 00:25:51.794
Meditation will help you a lot. Wherever
you are together, I am with you

00:25:51.995 --> 00:25:56.987
but when you are away from each other,
I am not with you.

00:25:57.438 --> 00:26:02.302
Only in difficulties, when you are pushed
into some places where I am not there,

00:26:02.503 --> 00:26:06.241
where you think I am not there, I am there.

00:26:06.449 --> 00:26:12.537
But if you deliberately are keeping out
of collectivity, I am not with you,

00:26:12.738 --> 00:26:19.748
so try to grow your collectivity otherwise
you cannot go deep into your own depths,

00:26:19.949 --> 00:26:26.208
you cannot become a great Sahaja yogi,
you cannot really be called a Sahaja yogi.

00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:31.566
Those who have a sense of collectivity can
only become that.

00:26:33.579 --> 00:26:38.302
15. EGO AND SURRENDERING

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:46.700
"Sangham sharanam gacchami." Sangha means
collectivity,

00:26:46.901 --> 00:26:52.571
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

00:26:52.782 --> 00:26:57.040
So here, in complete awareness, I mean,
you cannot be mesmerized.

00:26:57.241 --> 00:27:01.266
If you are mesmerized then you can live
whatever way you like.

00:27:01.467 --> 00:27:09.514
But in complete awareness and full
understanding we have to become collective.

00:27:10.062 --> 00:27:16.691
But once you are without ego means you have
surrendered yourself,

00:27:16.892 --> 00:27:22.873
no one can cheat you. Can you understand
that?

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:35.481
No one can cheat you because there is some
higher force, which is looking after you.

00:27:35.682 --> 00:27:39.993
This is the way we should understand
Buddha.

00:27:40.194 --> 00:27:45.567
This is we should know our Buddha
qualities.

00:27:45.768 --> 00:27:53.269
This is how our ego can be dissolved. When
you say, "Mother, we surrender to You,"

00:27:53.470 --> 00:28:03.046
that just means that you give this horrible
ego a complete holiday.

00:28:03.645 --> 00:28:09.967
It means that. That is how this ego
disappears.

00:28:11.919 --> 00:28:15.763
I think all your, your… just now,

00:28:15.964 --> 00:28:21.274
your Agnyas are opened out, most of you,
somehow.

00:28:21.537 --> 00:28:24.861
And then you'll laugh at everything;

00:28:25.062 --> 00:28:31.094
you'll make fun of yourself; just enjoy
everything.

00:28:33.101 --> 00:28:37.912
16. THE QUALITY OF VIRATANGANA

00:28:39.602 --> 00:28:45.717
Last but not the least, one must understand
that as all

00:28:45.918 --> 00:28:54.026
the seven chakras I am working on are
in a collective way held by Me, by Virata.

00:28:54.227 --> 00:28:58.445
The quality of Viratangana is that,
that She creates

00:28:58.646 --> 00:29:05.865
this universal awareness within us –
the collectivity;

00:29:06.863 --> 00:29:13.225
and if you do not realize that in modern
times we are

00:29:13.426 --> 00:29:20.622
in a spiritual path, in a collective way
only.

00:29:23.516 --> 00:29:29.009
This is what it is, because we have reached
to the state of Sahasrara,

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:39.392
and here we have to have a collective
working only, there’s no other way out.

00:29:40.058 --> 00:29:46.990
This is the most important point we must
know: if we cannot be collective –

00:29:47.691 --> 00:29:52.559
because of anything, jealousy maybe,
inferiority complex maybe, any, anything

00:29:52.736 --> 00:29:56.981
which is coming from behind like a worm
crawling up –

00:29:57.182 --> 00:30:02.616
then know that something wrong with you
 nothing wrong with the collectivity.

00:30:03.256 --> 00:30:07.483
I hope you’ll understand My vision and
you’ll stand by Me,

00:30:07.725 --> 00:30:13.737
and you’ll come up to that. I depend on you
entirely for My vision.

00:30:13.938 --> 00:30:17.231
We have to change this whole world into
a beautiful place,

00:30:17.432 --> 00:30:21.642
and for that not much sacrifice is needed.

00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:24.897
You’re already blessed, you don’t have
to do much;

00:30:25.113 --> 00:30:31.926
only thing is keep your attention
on the Source of power.

00:30:32.127 --> 00:30:35.519
May God bless you.

00:30:41.406 --> 00:30:45.527
Thank you. Matthias says, “We promise.”
Will you all say that?

00:30:45.728 --> 00:30:49.639
(Audience: “We promise, Shri Mataji.”)

00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:01.888
Thank you very much.
