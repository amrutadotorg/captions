WEBVTT

00:05.297 --> 00:13.325
PRACTICAL UNDERSTANDING OF COLLECTIVITY

00:17.480 --> 00:23.634
1. MEANING OF COLLECTIVITY

00:24.610 --> 00:28.225
Collectivity doesn’t mean that we all
should be stuck together

00:28.426 --> 00:35.216
with some glue or something or we all
become like Gibraltar,

00:35.460 --> 00:38.868
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean
that.

00:39.069 --> 00:46.138
It means wherever you are, you are
connected. That is collectivity.

00:46.748 --> 00:50.648
But if you are not connected and you are
just glued together,

00:50.849 --> 00:56.785
it’s very inconvenient to live under such
circumstances.

00:56.986 --> 01:02.471
I think, people don’t even understand
the meaning of collectivity

01:02.672 --> 01:09.547
where there’s not the other, Ananya. Where
there’s not the other,

01:09.748 --> 01:13.513
there’s no other personality.

01:14.964 --> 01:23.570
These personalities are separated from you
because of left and right.

01:23.771 --> 01:27.044
Or could be both.

01:29.264 --> 01:35.634
But you are yourself fully when you are
absolutely detached

01:35.835 --> 01:43.886
and your Kundalini is dancing – you’re
alone and never alone.

01:49.201 --> 01:54.329
This oneness with the whole

01:54.530 --> 02:02.964
gives you all the security that you want,
all the joy you want.

02:04.217 --> 02:11.778
And that’s why Kundalini Awakening means
"collectivity".

02:12.051 --> 02:21.964
Unless and until you want pure collectivity
in your being, Kundalini won’t rise.

02:23.846 --> 02:28.849
2. ONE BIG FAMILY

02:31.009 --> 02:41.788
So now, let us see how do we miss out
on collectivity.

02:44.028 --> 02:50.063
There’s a very practical down-to-earth
understanding.

02:50.264 --> 02:56.232
First we must know without collectivity we
cannot exist.

02:56.433 --> 03:02.062
As the body has to be in connection with
the brain,

03:02.263 --> 03:08.710
in the same way, without collectivity
Sahaja Yoga cannot exist.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.609
Once you understand that, then you have
to work it out

03:14.810 --> 03:21.513
that collectivity is absolutely
established, within and without.

03:21.714 --> 03:29.754
I do not know what thing comes first
in the human mind about another person,

03:29.955 --> 03:36.139
but the first thing is that these are your
real relations

03:36.340 --> 03:42.186
and nobody else are your relations.

03:42.387 --> 03:46.634
These children are your children

03:46.835 --> 03:52.236
and these men are your brothers, and these
ladies are your sisters,

03:52.437 --> 03:56.961
and we are one big family together.

03:58.873 --> 04:03.045
We are part and parcel of one body,

04:03.246 --> 04:09.371
and this hand cannot hit another hand,
thank God it doesn’t think,

04:09.572 --> 04:14.976
otherwise as human beings they might start
thinking against another hand,

04:15.177 --> 04:20.772
but they don’t because they are connected
to one brain activity.

04:22.672 --> 04:27.445
3. PURE RELATIONSHIPS

04:29.480 --> 04:36.955
So, we can see that when we ascend
in the collective consciousness

04:37.156 --> 04:42.316
and we have collective living, collective
meeting,

04:44.329 --> 04:52.167
at the Vishuddhi Chakra Shri Krishna
established this, or He manifested

04:52.368 --> 04:57.184
this pure relationship of a sister.

05:01.890 --> 05:06.646
In a collective life that we have,

05:08.953 --> 05:14.709
in the Ashram where we live, where we move
about as Sahaja Yogis,

05:14.910 --> 05:20.867
if we do not have this basic principle
within us,

05:22.177 --> 05:26.299
there will be a chaos, complete chaos.

05:26.500 --> 05:32.491
Once this purity of relationship is
established,

05:32.692 --> 05:39.215
that apart from my wife, all the rest are
my sisters or mothers,

05:43.948 --> 05:47.100
it cannot be

05:51.550 --> 06:02.885
a proper society and the chaos
of the social system of America

06:03.086 --> 06:09.666
is because they have no sense of pure
relationships.

06:10.732 --> 06:14.834
Once you call somebody a sister, she is
the sister.

06:15.090 --> 06:19.779
And once you call somebody a brother,
she is (he is) a brother.

06:21.040 --> 06:26.029
It's not only that you should be born
of the same parents, it's not necessary,

06:26.230 --> 06:30.389
but this is a very important principle

06:30.590 --> 06:37.725
to have a very pure society where everybody
can live peacefully.

06:39.968 --> 06:44.929
4. TURMOIL AND PEACE

06:47.294 --> 06:54.184
Think of the tree which is, say,
in a turmoil or during earthquake:

06:54.385 --> 06:59.604
it won’t grow. When the earthquake stops,

06:59.805 --> 07:05.829
everything becomes quiet, everything is
peaceful, then only the tree can grow.

07:06.030 --> 07:12.449
In the same way, our growth can only take
place if we are peaceful within ourselves.

07:12.650 --> 07:20.433
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider
and rising higher and higher,

07:20.634 --> 07:25.892
first thing is we must have peace within
ourselves.

07:26.093 --> 07:31.371
But this peace is possible if you can make
really peace with others.

07:31.572 --> 07:36.624
If you cannot make peace with others who
are in Sahaja Yoga,

07:36.825 --> 07:43.432
who are in the collective, if you are in
a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise.

07:43.633 --> 07:47.606
That is why collectivity is so important.

07:47.807 --> 07:52.014
Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot
open,

07:52.215 --> 08:00.509
and without collectivity you cannot have
the growth of your spirituality.

08:00.710 --> 08:07.003
It’s the growth of the spirituality: as
they say, the Tree of Life is upside-down

08:07.204 --> 08:16.128
and the roots are in the brain, and this
Kundalini has to go and water that brain,

08:16.347 --> 08:21.644
as we water the roots. Then it starts
flowing downward,

08:21.845 --> 08:24.986
and that’s how you start expanding.

08:26.904 --> 08:32.148
5. COMPASSION AND LOVE

08:33.717 --> 08:36.557
Now Mother has said we have to have
compassion, well now where do we

08:36.758 --> 08:41.095
have our compassion, on the walls? Where
do we use our compassion?

08:41.296 --> 08:44.389
Where do we use our compassion?

08:44.590 --> 08:47.985
So Sahaja Yoga is to be practiced, doesn’t
mean that you sit down

08:48.186 --> 08:51.811
with My photograph all the time, doesn’t
mean that.

08:52.012 --> 08:59.448
It means you practice compassion; you
practice that.

09:01.076 --> 09:06.182
Then you have to practice love. Now how do
you practice love with others?

09:06.383 --> 09:12.941
If you love someone, what do you do? You
try to please that person.

09:13.142 --> 09:16.705
Small things can make people very happy.

09:16.906 --> 09:20.284
I know, you all try to please Me very much,
you’ll give Me presents,

09:20.485 --> 09:22.774
you’ll find out things which are good
for Me,

09:22.975 --> 09:25.804
you’ll go out of the way buy sweet flowers
for Me,

09:26.005 --> 09:31.446
beautiful things you do to please Me.
I am over-pleased, I must tell you.

09:31.647 --> 09:35.661
But I am more pleased, much more pleased

09:35.862 --> 09:40.622
if you understand collectivity and try
to please each other.

09:40.845 --> 09:46.376
So now the practice love, where do you
practice? Ask you a question:

09:46.577 --> 09:52.441
where do I practice love? What do I love?

09:52.642 --> 09:58.891
We live, love our house, we love our
photographs, our decorations, everything,

09:59.092 --> 10:09.177
but do I practice this love on my wife, or
on my husband, or on other Sahaja yogis?

10:11.437 --> 10:16.386
6. DEVELOPMENT OF PATIENCE

10:18.293 --> 10:25.841
In our Sahaj culture we have to practice
compassion and love,

10:28.142 --> 10:32.384
and thirdly we have to practice patience.

10:32.585 --> 10:39.075
I know some children are maybe little more
mischievous, some are less mischievous.

10:39.276 --> 10:45.251
Maybe some people are very talkative,
sometimes really they give Me also headache;

10:45.452 --> 10:49.295
they go on talking, talking, talking,
talking, so much!

10:49.496 --> 10:55.046
Sometimes I think it’s good because it’s
a rest for My mouth –

10:55.927 --> 11:00.047
one way of looking at it. Another way of
looking at it is just switch off your mind,

11:00.248 --> 11:04.549
let him talk, take it out whatever he wants
to talk.

11:04.824 --> 11:11.535
Once he is finished with it and fagged out
then he won’t bother you much

11:11.736 --> 11:16.773
and also he’ll feel satisfied that somebody
has listened to his prattles.

11:16.974 --> 11:23.368
So patience is needed and patience is
needed in such a way

11:23.569 --> 11:26.443
that others should see your patience.

11:26.693 --> 11:29.822
Yesterday for example, I was sitting
for about, I think, three hours

11:30.023 --> 11:37.165
shaking hands with all sorts of people
and all types of problems,

11:37.366 --> 11:40.143
and the person who came last, he said,

11:40.344 --> 11:45.605
“Looking at Your patience, I develop my own
patience.”

11:47.868 --> 11:55.716
And love gives you patience. This love
nourishes you.

11:55.917 --> 12:00.546
I’m telling you, it’s absolutely
down-to-earth method:

12:00.747 --> 12:06.270
here I’ve not mentioned that you trust God,
I’m just saying trust yourself,

12:06.471 --> 12:11.078
absolutely down-to-earth because we are
talking about your brain.

12:12.917 --> 12:18.025
7. EXPLOITATION AND RESPECT

12:19.639 --> 12:29.782
So, today's understanding should be that we
all should become collective from inside.

12:29.983 --> 12:38.210
We should not grudge or grumble about
everything and enjoy the collectivity.

12:38.411 --> 12:44.036
But the second side of collectivity is
this, that do not try

12:44.237 --> 12:48.760
to exploit the collectivity, otherwise,
you'll be in trouble.

12:48.961 --> 12:52.762
Like, I've seen some people don't know how
to use their bathrooms.

12:52.963 --> 13:02.992
When you are collective you have to be
respecting the collectivity of others.

13:03.911 --> 13:11.007
By your presence another person should
not, by any chance, suffer,

13:11.208 --> 13:24.322
or should not feel in any way insulted
or inconvenienced.

13:25.253 --> 13:28.463
So when you are in the collective it should
be such that

13:28.664 --> 13:36.027
another person should enjoy your company,
enjoy your being there.

13:36.228 --> 13:43.499
That is something where there is
no problem.

13:46.872 --> 13:50.156
But if you are demanding, and if you are
asking for things

13:50.357 --> 13:55.108
and you think no end of yourself, you
cannot at all collective, by any chance,

13:55.309 --> 13:58.815
but you'll suffer for that,

14:00.594 --> 14:04.362
automatically you will suffer.

14:05.252 --> 14:12.396
If this is realized and understood
properly, your Agnya is solved.

14:14.593 --> 14:19.490
8. ANGER AND FORGIVENESS

14:21.405 --> 14:25.775
Like anger.

14:28.398 --> 14:34.892
There are people always boast, "I'm very
angry with him." Boast.

14:36.852 --> 14:43.164
But just make that anger into forgiveness
and you'll see the person,

14:43.365 --> 14:48.814
instead of you getting into problems,
he will get into problems.

14:49.015 --> 14:57.730
Anger will upset you, but forgiveness will
upset him, automatically.

14:57.931 --> 15:02.317
It's the biggest weapon you have got –
is to forgive.

15:02.518 --> 15:07.281
And this is shown in Buddha's character
throughout.

15:08.970 --> 15:13.967
Now we have been saying that we have
to forgive everyone,

15:14.168 --> 15:21.446
but we don’t practice that. Small, small
things like mad people we remember.

15:21.647 --> 15:25.108
I mean, only I have heard that snake has
this capacity

15:25.309 --> 15:27.561
to remember if somebody has hurt him,

15:27.762 --> 15:31.496
but here I find human beings have no less
capacity.

15:31.697 --> 15:34.664
Whatever has happened 13 years back,
15 years back

15:34.865 --> 15:38.181
they all remember each and every thing:
whatever has hurt them,

15:38.405 --> 15:42.200
but how they have hurt others they don’t
remember,

15:42.401 --> 15:45.883
how they have been nasty to others they
don’t remember,

15:46.084 --> 15:51.496
because this is a human mind which has got
the ego,

15:51.697 --> 15:57.225
it can go on hurting others, it doesn’t
feel anything, and the superego

15:57.426 --> 16:02.746
which goes on receiving all the hurts and
always complaining about it.

16:04.572 --> 16:09.442
9. CRITICISM AND BUMPTIOUSNESS

16:11.553 --> 16:18.040
Don’t criticize the collectivity, till I
Myself find it out and I’ll put it right.

16:18.241 --> 16:23.909
Keep to the collectivity wisely and
earnestly,

16:24.110 --> 16:29.561
and try to keep the collectivity together.

16:31.202 --> 16:35.701
Try to help to keep the people collective,
to enjoy together.

16:35.902 --> 16:39.335
Don’t criticize each other.

16:39.536 --> 16:44.033
Only criticize yourself if you are
in the habit of criticism,

16:44.234 --> 16:49.533
better criticize yourself, it’s better;
because these are habits also.

16:49.734 --> 16:54.386
People, specially I have seen people
in the West, they react to everything.

16:54.587 --> 16:57.577
If they see this carpet, “Oh, I don’t
like it.”

16:57.778 --> 17:01.135
But this is not yours, you’ve not paid for
you, what have you got to do with it?

17:01.336 --> 17:05.354
“No, I don’t like it.” But it’s not yours;

17:05.555 --> 17:09.866
what’s the question? It’s lying here, why
should you be so upset about it?

17:10.067 --> 17:15.334
“I don’t like that person. I don’t like
that dress.”

17:15.615 --> 17:18.569
Who are you?

17:19.253 --> 17:22.229
“I don’t like.”

17:23.998 --> 17:29.370
This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga,
“I don’t like.”

17:30.404 --> 17:40.019
There is a way of saying things; but there
is no need to say anything whatsoever.

17:44.383 --> 17:51.995
So all this kind of bumptiousness and
showing off is against collectivity.

17:53.979 --> 17:58.955
10. JEALOUSY AND APPRECIATION

18:00.865 --> 18:08.247
So try to appreciate everything. Children
are producing pictures, paintings, any way.

18:08.448 --> 18:13.003
They make sometimes My face is very funny
when they draw –

18:13.204 --> 18:17.629
not the children, even grownups. Doesn’t
matter, I appreciate it, it’s very good,

18:17.830 --> 18:22.303
wonderful, very nice, to encourage that
person.

18:22.480 --> 18:30.206
So criticism should go out of our mind,
but appreciation should be practiced:

18:30.407 --> 18:36.036
appreciation of others’ children,
appreciation of other people

18:36.237 --> 18:41.140
is very important but that doesn’t mean
that you appreciate all others

18:41.341 --> 18:47.852
and torture your wife or torture your
husband – that also is an imbalance.

18:48.053 --> 18:53.878
First responsibility is your family but you
should appreciate others,

18:54.079 --> 18:59.073
and this comes when you have no jealousies
about anyone.

18:59.274 --> 19:01.538
This jealousy, I don’t know from where
it comes,

19:01.739 --> 19:07.045
so I don’t know this quality of jealousy,
why there is jealousy.

19:07.246 --> 19:12.615
So, also if you have jealousy you have
to use it for the right purpose,

19:12.816 --> 19:16.616
and what is the right purpose is that you
should be jealous of a person

19:16.817 --> 19:22.335
who is spiritually higher than you, and you
practice it that you become better.

19:22.536 --> 19:26.807
If jealousy is for competition, then you
compete with the person

19:27.008 --> 19:36.250
who is more compassionate, more loving,
more sacrificing, more patient.

19:38.127 --> 19:41.598
So this competition becomes a very healthy
competition

19:41.799 --> 19:46.175
and the collectivity becomes very
nourished.

19:48.176 --> 19:53.214
11. AGGRESSIVENESS AND HIMULITY

19:54.986 --> 20:00.145
Now the worst enemy of collectivity is
aggressiveness.

20:00.346 --> 20:06.220
Some people are basically aggressive; their
style of talking is extremely aggressive,

20:06.421 --> 20:10.763
the way they say things is aggressive.
May be because anything,

20:10.964 --> 20:17.999
may be they are better educated, may be
they come from a very aggressive family,

20:18.200 --> 20:23.444
may be they are having a kind
of a superiority complex

20:23.645 --> 20:30.865
or an inferiority complex or a sense
of insecurity, or maybe they are possessed.

20:31.066 --> 20:38.803
They try to dominate and show their very
strong feelings towards people –

20:39.004 --> 20:45.526
of superiority. They may be inferior, it’s
not necessary,

20:45.727 --> 20:51.006
but they do and this is something is to be
curbed.

20:51.207 --> 20:58.213
So what you have to practice here is
humility. Try to be humble.

20:59.315 --> 21:05.415
Humility is that in no way you try
to aggress others,

21:05.616 --> 21:11.887
and if others are aggressive you accept it
as a childish thing, as a stupid thing,

21:12.087 --> 21:20.169
as a foolish thing, has no meaning: because
you are so powerful, you can bear it.

21:20.370 --> 21:28.360
That is humility which you have to practice
and all these qualities if you have,

21:29.638 --> 21:35.892
you will really be surprised that you will
lose your selfishness.

21:37.666 --> 21:42.447
12. COLLECTIVE TEMPERAMENT

21:44.390 --> 21:49.618
Only way to grow is to be collective.
There’s no other way out.

21:49.819 --> 21:53.719
If people think that by staying away
from ashrams,

21:53.920 --> 21:57.351
alone living somewhere they will achieve
much

21:57.552 --> 22:02.264
- that’s not the way Sahaja Yoga is meant.

22:02.465 --> 22:09.806
Formerly, people used to go to Himalayas
and most of them were separated

22:10.007 --> 22:16.211
and only one or two persons were chosen
for spiritual growth.

22:16.412 --> 22:19.664
Here it is not question of spiritual
growth,

22:19.865 --> 22:26.021
it’s a question of your collectivity
growing in you.

22:26.226 --> 22:33.748
That is how you become a person who is
collective, who enjoys collective,

22:33.949 --> 22:38.599
who works on collective and lives
with collective.

22:38.800 --> 22:47.372
Such a person develops new kind of powers.

22:49.305 --> 22:55.466
And these powers are such that they are
very subtle,

22:55.667 --> 23:06.262
but they penetrate into any molecule, atom
or human beings, anywhere.

23:06.463 --> 23:10.525
And their penetration is only possible if
you have

23:10.726 --> 23:14.214
a temperament which is collective.

23:14.415 --> 23:21.531
Without being fully collective, you cannot
achieve

23:22.293 --> 23:27.882
that height which is very necessary today
for Sahaja Yoga.

23:30.494 --> 23:35.515
13. INDIVIDUALISM AND INTEGRATION

23:37.175 --> 23:46.464
Question: “Shri Mother, we feel the same
chakras, more on legs than on the fingers.”

23:46.665 --> 23:52.102
Shri Mataji: The integration is not there,
that’s why. You have to attend collectively.

23:52.303 --> 23:56.012
You have to become more collective.
The body has to be collective.

23:56.213 --> 24:00.090
The thing is if you don't, if you are not
a collective person then sometimes

24:00.291 --> 24:03.418
you’ll feel them on the legs, sometimes
on the hand, sometimes in the head.

24:03.619 --> 24:06.639
That’s not a good thing. You should try
to become more collective,

24:06.840 --> 24:12.992
you should meet more people, take more
interest. You see, the body of your’s

24:13.193 --> 24:21.179
won't work out efficiently unless and
until you use it.

24:21.380 --> 24:27.075
Because individually, you see if they,
individually if you work out,

24:27.276 --> 24:33.666
it will not develop collectively, because
where are you using it?

24:33.867 --> 24:38.462
You are correcting yourself to give it
to others. And if you don’t give it,

24:38.663 --> 24:45.511
if you do not work it out in a collective
way, there is no circulation.

24:47.446 --> 24:52.288
14. COLLECTIVE MEDITATION

24:53.896 --> 25:00.381
Meditating together is the best way to feel
the collectivity.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.904
You can meditate at home, of course, you
also cleanse it for your depth,

25:04.105 --> 25:07.910
but also you must meditate together and
when you meditate together

25:08.111 --> 25:13.596
then the strength that you have strengthens
others,

25:13.797 --> 25:18.059
and the strength of the whole collectivity
improves so much.

25:18.260 --> 25:21.721
We are meditating together is a very big
thing.

25:21.922 --> 25:26.331
Everyone has to understand that whenever
you get time you find out

25:26.532 --> 25:30.935
in the morning times, for example, we’ll go
to the ashram and meditate.

25:31.136 --> 25:34.404
Say, Sunday morning, we’ll just go and
meditate in the ashram.

25:34.605 --> 25:38.014
Just for meditation you have to come.
Meditate and go away

25:38.215 --> 25:41.996
because I reside in this ashram, I am here,

25:42.197 --> 25:45.928
so leave your homes, come here and
meditate.

25:46.113 --> 25:51.794
Meditation will help you a lot. Wherever
you are together, I am with you

25:51.995 --> 25:56.987
but when you are away from each other,
I am not with you.

25:57.438 --> 26:02.302
Only in difficulties, when you are pushed
into some places where I am not there,

26:02.503 --> 26:06.241
where you think I am not there, I am there.

26:06.449 --> 26:12.537
But if you deliberately are keeping out
of collectivity, I am not with you,

26:12.738 --> 26:19.748
so try to grow your collectivity otherwise
you cannot go deep into your own depths,

26:19.949 --> 26:26.208
you cannot become a great Sahaja yogi,
you cannot really be called a Sahaja yogi.

26:26.409 --> 26:31.566
Those who have a sense of collectivity can
only become that.

26:33.579 --> 26:38.302
15. EGO AND SURRENDERING

26:40.010 --> 26:46.700
"Sangham sharanam gacchami." Sangha means
collectivity,

26:46.901 --> 26:52.571
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

26:52.782 --> 26:57.040
So here, in complete awareness, I mean,
you cannot be mesmerized.

26:57.241 --> 27:01.266
If you are mesmerized then you can live
whatever way you like.

27:01.467 --> 27:09.514
But in complete awareness and full
understanding we have to become collective.

27:10.062 --> 27:16.691
But once you are without ego means you have
surrendered yourself,

27:16.892 --> 27:22.873
no one can cheat you. Can you understand
that?

27:24.870 --> 27:35.481
No one can cheat you because there is some
higher force, which is looking after you.

27:35.682 --> 27:39.993
This is the way we should understand
Buddha.

27:40.194 --> 27:45.567
This is we should know our Buddha
qualities.

27:45.768 --> 27:53.269
This is how our ego can be dissolved. When
you say, "Mother, we surrender to You,"

27:53.470 --> 28:03.046
that just means that you give this horrible
ego a complete holiday.

28:03.645 --> 28:09.967
It means that. That is how this ego
disappears.

28:11.919 --> 28:15.763
I think all your, your… just now,

28:15.964 --> 28:21.274
your Agnyas are opened out, most of you,
somehow.

28:21.537 --> 28:24.861
And then you'll laugh at everything;

28:25.062 --> 28:31.094
you'll make fun of yourself; just enjoy
everything.

28:33.101 --> 28:37.912
16. THE QUALITY OF VIRATANGANA

28:39.602 --> 28:45.717
Last but not the least, one must understand
that as all

28:45.918 --> 28:54.026
the seven chakras I am working on are
in a collective way held by Me, by Virata.

28:54.227 --> 28:58.445
The quality of Viratangana is that,
that She creates

28:58.646 --> 29:05.865
this universal awareness within us –
the collectivity;

29:06.863 --> 29:13.225
and if you do not realize that in modern
times we are

29:13.426 --> 29:20.622
in a spiritual path, in a collective way
only.

29:23.516 --> 29:29.009
This is what it is, because we have reached
to the state of Sahasrara,

29:29.210 --> 29:39.392
and here we have to have a collective
working only, there’s no other way out.

29:40.058 --> 29:46.990
This is the most important point we must
know: if we cannot be collective –

29:47.691 --> 29:52.559
because of anything, jealousy maybe,
inferiority complex maybe, any, anything

29:52.736 --> 29:56.981
which is coming from behind like a worm
crawling up –

29:57.182 --> 30:02.616
then know that something wrong with you
nothing wrong with the collectivity.

30:03.256 --> 30:07.483
I hope you’ll understand My vision and
you’ll stand by Me,

30:07.725 --> 30:13.737
and you’ll come up to that. I depend on you
entirely for My vision.

30:13.938 --> 30:17.231
We have to change this whole world into
a beautiful place,

30:17.432 --> 30:21.642
and for that not much sacrifice is needed.

30:21.843 --> 30:24.897
You’re already blessed, you don’t have
to do much;

30:25.113 --> 30:31.926
only thing is keep your attention
on the Source of power.

30:32.127 --> 30:35.519
May God bless you.

30:41.406 --> 30:45.527
Thank you. Matthias says, “We promise.”
Will you all say that?

30:45.728 --> 30:49.639
(Audience: “We promise, Shri Mataji.”)

30:58.571 --> 31:01.888
Thank you very much.
