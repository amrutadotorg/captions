00:00:17.959 --> 00:00:26.208
Sankranti Puja, Rahuri, India

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:37.417
January 14th, 1987

00:01:20.318 --> 00:01:30.666
Today is the day where we celebrate the change

00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:40.997
of the axis of the Sun and that He moves

00:01:41.022 --> 00:01:45.421
towards the tropic of cancer.

00:01:52.214 --> 00:01:56.630
Tropic of cancer is the one

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.339
which represents the motherhood,

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:15.005
the motherhood of the Earth.

00:02:22.713 --> 00:02:28.380
This tropic of Cancer has passed through

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.380
quite a big area of land

00:02:32.963 --> 00:02:37.089
while the tropic of Capricorn has not.

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:43.047
And the area through which it has passed

00:02:44.671 --> 00:02:47.297
it has created

00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:58.755
different beautiful manifestation

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:05.339
of the motherhood qualities on this Earth.

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:11.089
We celebrate this change

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.047
because the Sun has now moved into the new

00:03:21.297 --> 00:03:26.588
dimension so that all over the world

00:03:29.463 --> 00:03:35.214
there will be the warmth of the Sun.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.630
Warmth of the Sun

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:48.297
represents the warmth of God's love.

00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:53.713
This is the reason why we celebrate

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:59.505
this festival

00:04:00.963 --> 00:04:03.380
by giving you some sort of a sweet

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:06.797
made out of sesame seeds.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:16.546
Sesame seeds are given because they are also heat giving

00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:21.797
and now as we are coming from the cold,

00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:28.380
we come to the hot season, in a way hotter season,

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:34.339
so to prepare you with that warmth of the Sun.

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:40.588
These special things are made out of the seed

00:04:41.172 --> 00:04:46.755
of sesame to represent the oncoming warmth

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.089
and the warm of the Sun.

00:04:54.588 --> 00:04:57.505
Though in India the heat is too much,

00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:04.963
still people are waiting for this time to come in

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.379
and they celebrate it with such a warm heart.

00:05:09.838 --> 00:05:14.380
At this time it is said that

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:23.671
they give you this sesame seed and the sugar to eat,

00:05:24.255 --> 00:05:28.339
but now you must speak in a sweet manner,

00:05:28.963 --> 00:05:33.505
"gudd gudd bola", means you must speak in the sweet manner.

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:39.130
Speaking in the sweet manner is very important.

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:44.463
Some people think it is smart to speak in a rude manner

00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:50.130
or is very intelligent to shout on people,

00:05:53.047 --> 00:05:57.380
but no one likes this kind of a personality.

00:05:58.005 --> 00:06:04.047
You may be intelligent, you may be very sharp or smart,

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:09.379
maybe on a television people may like to see you,

00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:14.505
but not as companions, as friends.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.047
To speak in a very sweet manner

00:06:21.755 --> 00:06:28.880
is a sign of good breeding, good culture and fear of God.

00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:32.421
Those who fear God will never speak

00:06:32.963 --> 00:06:36.214
rudely to another person, because in another person

00:06:36.797 --> 00:06:39.671
also the same spirit is shining

00:06:40.172 --> 00:06:45.130
and why should we be sharp or angry with another person

00:06:45.546 --> 00:06:50.838
who is created by God Almighty as we are created.

00:06:51.755 --> 00:06:56.963
So this loving, beautiful relationship

00:06:57.421 --> 00:06:58.713
that we have with each other,

00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:00.880
after Sahaja Yoga especially,

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:06.047
let us express in talking to each other sweetly.

00:07:06.505 --> 00:07:10.421
There are so many ways by which we could be sweet.

00:07:13.922 --> 00:07:17.214
There are little, little things if you do,

00:07:18.546 --> 00:07:20.755
you can create lot of sweetness,

00:07:21.297 --> 00:07:26.505
but you need not a sharp tongue, but a sharp memory.

00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:29.755
I try these things many a times.

00:07:30.797 --> 00:07:35.880
Once one of the Sahaja Yogi,

00:07:36.005 --> 00:07:39.380
who is a very good Sahaja Yogi and an active Sahaja Yogi,

00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:42.630
was going in the car with Me

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:51.588
and his knife was stolen by the driver or somebody

00:07:52.047 --> 00:07:55.047
and he got very angry with the driver.

00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:58.379
I said, "Forget it, you see he is an poor man,

00:07:58.755 --> 00:08:02.671
so he has taken it away, doesn't matter, just forget it."

00:08:03.047 --> 00:08:05.380
He says, "No, it was because it's a present to me

00:08:05.713 --> 00:08:07.922
from somebody who was in Switzerland and

00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:10.755
it's a Swiss knife which I was keeping with me.

00:08:11.172 --> 00:08:15.630
So I feel sorry that I have lost it."

00:08:16.089 --> 00:08:18.214
When I went to Switzerland I bought that kind of a

00:08:18.505 --> 00:08:20.463
same knife for him.

00:08:20.963 --> 00:08:24.172
When I came, when I gave him,

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:26.089
he didn't have words to say anything.

00:08:26.463 --> 00:08:29.463
He said, "Mother, how did You remember?

00:08:29.922 --> 00:08:31.380
After such a long time how did you manage

00:08:32.172 --> 00:08:33.421
to get this knife?"

00:08:34.172 --> 00:08:35.339
I said, "I have a very good memory."

00:08:35.963 --> 00:08:38.713
That's the trouble with Me.

00:08:39.297 --> 00:08:42.463
The memory is so good that sometimes,

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.755
I just don't know,

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:49.214
I may embarrass some people with My memory.

00:08:49.546 --> 00:08:53.379
It is that good, I don't forget anything whatsoever.

00:08:53.797 --> 00:08:55.588
I, of course, forget all the bad things,

00:08:55.963 --> 00:08:59.421
because no use remembering bad things,

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.005
no use thinking of them.

00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:06.630
Because of forgiveness you can always forget the bad things.

00:09:07.172 --> 00:09:09.089
And if you remember the good things

00:09:09.755 --> 00:09:12.797
your joy becomes multiplied.

00:09:13.255 --> 00:09:15.339
If you try to remember something bad

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:17.297
then your joy goes down.

00:09:17.713 --> 00:09:19.421
Every time you see a person try to remember

00:09:19.963 --> 00:09:22.922
what good that person has done to you.

00:09:23.339 --> 00:09:25.380
What good that person has.

00:09:25.797 --> 00:09:28.463
If you have memory for good things

00:09:30.463 --> 00:09:33.214
you will have a very nice time.

00:09:33.963 --> 00:09:37.379
Now today is the day when you are all leaving India.

00:09:37.713 --> 00:09:40.047
Some of you will be leaving day after tomorrow.

00:09:40.421 --> 00:09:41.463
Whatever it is,

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.339
I have to tell you one thing, that

00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:50.755
whatever was possible has been done here, for you people

00:09:51.172 --> 00:09:53.755
to give you joy and happiness.

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.505
Now when you are going back,

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.421
try to remember all that was said to you.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.380
All that was nice.

00:10:01.838 --> 00:10:03.297
How people praised you.

00:10:03.713 --> 00:10:06.880
How they loved you. How they were kind to you.

00:10:07.421 --> 00:10:09.339
How you met some nice people.

00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:11.797
What nice experiences you had

00:10:12.255 --> 00:10:15.880
but don't brood over things which are worthless.

00:10:16.214 --> 00:10:19.505
All right, somebody must have said something harsh to you

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.880
or you might have said something harsh to someone,

00:10:22.297 --> 00:10:23.880
just forget it.

00:10:24.379 --> 00:10:26.797
Try to understand that you are spoiling

00:10:27.172 --> 00:10:29.671
your chances of enjoying life.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:37.922
Nobody is hurt by that so try to be extremely happy

00:10:38.463 --> 00:10:40.297
that you have met so many people,

00:10:40.755 --> 00:10:42.255
that you have had weddings,

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.297
that you have seen so many weddings.

00:10:44.588 --> 00:10:48.505
We have had a nice time and every bit of it was

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.047
full of joyous vibrations.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.089
Of course, today some of you would be a little unhappy

00:10:55.505 --> 00:10:59.130
I can understand that because your spouses are leaving,

00:10:59.588 --> 00:11:01.797
somebody's husbands are going away or

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:03.755
somebody's wives are going away.

00:11:04.172 --> 00:11:05.255
So I can see some of them

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.005
are looking rather miserable about it.

00:11:14.797 --> 00:11:17.255
But that's a good thing because it is out of love

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.047
and out of attraction for each other,

00:11:21.463 --> 00:11:23.838
for enjoying the company of each other.

00:11:24.172 --> 00:11:26.463
That's suggestive of something very good to Me

00:11:26.797 --> 00:11:29.339
but still I would say that, after all,

00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:31.755
you are going to meet each other

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.379
and remember all the good things that

00:11:33.797 --> 00:11:35.463
you have said to each other,

00:11:35.838 --> 00:11:38.963
you have enjoyed with each other and try to keep happy.

00:11:39.463 --> 00:11:42.214
Because these days will pass very fast.

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:44.671
In Sahaja Yoga you just forget time, everything,

00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:48.463
the time passes so fast and all these things will pass over

00:11:48.797 --> 00:11:52.797
and you will be again united with your husbands or wives,

00:11:53.172 --> 00:11:54.505
whatever may be the case.

00:11:55.089 --> 00:11:58.297
So there is nothing to feel very sad about all these things,

00:11:58.546 --> 00:12:00.630
and to keep smiling and laughing,

00:12:01.089 --> 00:12:02.297
so when they are departing also,

00:12:02.797 --> 00:12:06.297
they should not feel, see your last face full of tears but,

00:12:08.421 --> 00:12:13.379
but remember the face of assurance and courage,

00:12:13.755 --> 00:12:16.130
that the hope is there,

00:12:16.463 --> 00:12:17.838
we are going to meet very soon and

00:12:18.297 --> 00:12:20.713
there is nothing to feel very sad about it.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.713
Today is the day to make joy and to enjoy everything

00:12:25.214 --> 00:12:30.713
and to feel the blessings of God all around us.

00:12:31.172 --> 00:12:35.130
The Sun has come back in His own glory

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:41.214
and we have to wish Him all success in the coming year,

00:12:41.588 --> 00:12:43.421
because in this part of Maharashtra

00:12:43.797 --> 00:12:45.713
as you know there has been no rain.

00:12:46.047 --> 00:12:48.089
There has been problems with them and

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:49.713
we have to wish Him success

00:12:50.421 --> 00:12:55.421
so that He can bring forth the rain

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:02.339
and all that is needed out of this solar energy

00:13:02.755 --> 00:13:05.089
that we have in this country.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:10.297
And you have to be beaming like the Sun

00:13:10.671 --> 00:13:12.339
when you go back to your countries.

00:13:12.922 --> 00:13:16.297
That your countries are not so hot as ours are neither

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:20.005
you have that much of warmth there and you can find

00:13:20.379 --> 00:13:23.838
that why people are so warm and so much loving because

00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:25.880
we have the Sun with us.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.797
Now you carry the Sun with you and you give them love

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:35.089
and affection and warmth and let them feel that the Sun

00:13:35.463 --> 00:13:38.005
has been brought from India by you.

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:40.463
Whenever I have traveled anywhere, in any country,

00:13:40.922 --> 00:13:43.421
the Sun used to be there very bright, so they said that,

00:13:44.005 --> 00:13:46.630
there is a saying that, when the Indians travel

00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:48.880
they carry the Sun with them.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.255
Of course you can't carry the Sun in your pockets

00:13:51.922 --> 00:13:54.089
but we must be carrying it in our hearts, the Sun.

00:13:54.588 --> 00:13:56.505
That must be the reason that's why

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.089
the Sun was shining so well

00:13:58.713 --> 00:14:00.214
and everybody came out with their good dresses

00:14:00.588 --> 00:14:02.379
and everything was ...were, and were enjoying.

00:14:02.963 --> 00:14:04.713
So this is what it is,

00:14:05.255 --> 00:14:07.005
that you have to carry the Sun with you

00:14:07.421 --> 00:14:11.005
speaking sweetly today and forever to each other

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.130
to be friendly, to be helpful, to be kind

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.172
because you are yogis,

00:14:16.505 --> 00:14:17.755
you are not ordinary people.

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.214
You are yogis, you represent that category of people

00:14:21.463 --> 00:14:23.089
who are known for their righteousness,

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:26.214
for their goodness and for their compassion and love.

00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:29.297
So I wish you all best of luck.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.922
Enjoy your journeys,

00:14:31.339 --> 00:14:34.130
enjoy everything and pass this joy

00:14:34.505 --> 00:14:35.797
that you have achieved here,

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:37.922
to other people, to other Sahaja Yogis

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.379
and to other people who are not even Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:41.797 --> 00:14:44.130
May God bless you with that.

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:46.380
Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi.

00:14:46.755 --> 00:14:49.380
Today is an auspicious day and on this day we give sesame

00:14:50.505 --> 00:14:53.255
seeds to others and ask them to talk sweetly.

00:14:54.214 --> 00:14:56.505
We tell others but it would be better if we tell it

00:14:57.379 --> 00:15:00.339
to ourselves also because it is easier to tell others

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.047
to talk sweetly but: “I’ll talk harshly.”

00:15:03.838 --> 00:15:05.463
With this habit of ours have created

00:15:06.214 --> 00:15:09.546
wrong ideas about ourselves. We do not have any idea

00:15:10.713 --> 00:15:14.463
of the blessings that God has bestowed upon us.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:18.005
God has given such a lot of blessings to us in this country.

00:15:18.339 --> 00:15:21.588
But in this country people do not care much for cleanliness.

00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.005
In this country there are different types of germs

00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:28.172
and parasites.

00:15:28.421 --> 00:15:30.380
I feel that we have all the parasites of the whole world

00:15:30.922 --> 00:15:33.214
in this country. We even have parasites which

00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:36.089
cannot be found anywhere else in the world.

00:15:36.671 --> 00:15:39.838
If these parasites go to the other countries they will die.

00:15:40.339 --> 00:15:42.380
Because of the cold they cannot survive.

00:15:42.838 --> 00:15:45.546
Due to the Sun, there are so many parasites in this country.

00:15:46.797 --> 00:15:49.172
Once a scientist asked Me, “How is it possible to remain

00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:53.421
alive with so many parasites present in your country?”

00:15:53.963 --> 00:15:56.172
I replied that “In this country, the people are not only

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.755
alive but live with joy and happiness,

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.380
with a lot of bliss and happiness.”

00:16:01.797 --> 00:16:03.463
The reason for this is the Sun.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:05.463
The Sun has taught us to keep our homes open

00:16:06.172 --> 00:16:07.713
and also open our hearts.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.838
In England, if you have to go out somewhere

00:16:13.546 --> 00:16:16.505
then you have to spend at least fifteen minutes just to put

00:16:17.005 --> 00:16:18.505
on the right clothes.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.922
It’s as if you are wearing a shield before going out,

00:16:21.214 --> 00:16:25.339
otherwise you might catch a cold and affect your head.

00:16:26.463 --> 00:16:28.005
This is the situation there.

00:16:28.339 --> 00:16:31.463
Today you are sitting here in the open but we cannot sit

00:16:32.005 --> 00:16:33.963
like this in England or in any other Western country.

00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:38.630
Because of the weather these countries have become very cold.

00:16:40.963 --> 00:16:44.505
Even in our country there are areas (city), for example

00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:49.713
if you go to cities like Bhowali or the other side of

00:16:50.797 --> 00:16:54.588
Nainital and Dehradun and very close to the Himalayas, then

00:16:55.505 --> 00:17:00.214
you can find the cold weather as in the other countries.

00:17:01.005 --> 00:17:06.047
There, it is also cold like in England and America.

00:17:06.838 --> 00:17:09.380
But in these cold countries not even birds or insects

00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:10.922
can survive.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:15.671
There are a lot of forests with beautiful flowers in them.

00:17:17.797 --> 00:17:19.630
They call it a valley of flowers.

00:17:20.214 --> 00:17:22.005
There are so many beautiful flowers – as if it is a paradise

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.713
on earth – but this feeling is only for a moment.

00:17:25.797 --> 00:17:28.047
It is so cold there that we cannot even open our eyes

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.214
to see that beautiful place.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.588
We have to wear spectacles otherwise our eyes are hurt,

00:17:34.172 --> 00:17:35.505
because of the cold.

00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:38.089
But in spite of the cold,

00:17:38.505 --> 00:17:40.963
those countries have progressed so much.

00:17:41.546 --> 00:17:45.880
They have fought against the nature and the cold climate

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.797
and strengthened their countries.

00:17:51.671 --> 00:17:54.797
In spite of having a lot of sun, we have not been able

00:17:55.505 --> 00:17:57.713
to exploit its advantages.

00:17:58.255 --> 00:18:00.047
We can also produce solar energy.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:02.838
If we use the solar energy we will never have a dearth

00:18:03.339 --> 00:18:04.755
of (electrical) energy.

00:18:05.089 --> 00:18:07.047
Even the cars can run on solar energy.

00:18:07.379 --> 00:18:09.089
But the attention of the politicians here in India

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.463
is elsewhere and due to this fact, we cannot exploit

00:18:11.922 --> 00:18:14.880
the advantages from the sun but suffer from it.

00:18:15.297 --> 00:18:19.297
If we do not go to the extremes then we can do a lot of work.

00:18:19.797 --> 00:18:21.380
The main thing which we can learn from the Sun

00:18:21.671 --> 00:18:25.214
is Its capacity of giving. It always gives.

00:18:26.297 --> 00:18:29.421
It does not take anything but always gives.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.463
Due to this tremendous giving power of the Sun

00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:37.047
we can have rain, we can have crops and living beings.

00:18:37.505 --> 00:18:39.546
If we did not have the sun then we would not have anything.

00:18:40.005 --> 00:18:41.421
It is due to the giving power of love of the Sun only, that

00:18:41.922 --> 00:18:44.297
we have been able to reach this state.

00:18:44.588 --> 00:18:46.630
Thus what we have to learn from the Sun is that we should

00:18:46.922 --> 00:18:48.797
also develop the power of giving.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.922
If we look around us we will find people who will always

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:53.838
think, “How I can save money and keep it for myself?”

00:18:54.214 --> 00:18:56.671
Even if I give money for some programs, some people still

00:18:56.922 --> 00:18:59.047
think how they can save money from that also.

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:01.922
Even if I have given them some money to spend they always

00:19:02.214 --> 00:19:05.380
have a tendency to save money from everything. Why?

00:19:05.797 --> 00:19:07.588
Because there is a tendency to hold on to something.

00:19:07.838 --> 00:19:09.922
If someone goes to the market and they find that prices

00:19:10.214 --> 00:19:11.838
have risen, and if we ask, “Why?” they reply that

00:19:12.172 --> 00:19:14.130
“Because the others have increased the prices,

00:19:14.379 --> 00:19:15.630
that’s why I also increase the price.”

00:19:15.963 --> 00:19:18.297
If the (cost) prices of the commodities are not rising then

00:19:18.963 --> 00:19:21.297
why do they raise the (selling) price?

00:19:22.047 --> 00:19:25.380
They have always a tendency to suck the energy of others.

00:19:25.838 --> 00:19:28.172
Even if I want to make a small ceremony for a festive

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.463
occasion, then others tell Me,

00:19:40.546 --> 00:19:42.214
“Shri Mataji you will not be able to succeed.”

00:19:43.214 --> 00:19:45.797
When I ask, “Why?” the reply is that people are corrupt and

00:19:46.172 --> 00:19:48.255
they will eat (grab) money.

00:19:48.713 --> 00:19:51.546
As I eat the food they eat money, so maybe we will not get

00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:54.380
along together. It is such an absurd thing.

00:19:54.713 --> 00:19:56.463
Those who are responsible for the country’s welfare,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.005
those who are the administrators and those on whom the power

00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:02.255
has been bestowed by God, even they do not understand that

00:20:02.755 --> 00:20:05.797
we have to give.

00:20:06.297 --> 00:20:10.380
This quality of giving one has to learn from the Sun:

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:14.421
that we have come (on this earth) to give and not to take.

00:20:14.797 --> 00:20:17.130
This complete change from within has to be reached with

00:20:17.546 --> 00:20:19.130
an understanding that we have to give and not to take.

00:20:19.588 --> 00:20:21.671
We have to have the passion of giving.

00:20:22.172 --> 00:20:25.005
It’s as if when a mother knows that “Today my son is coming”

00:20:25.255 --> 00:20:26.963
then with passion she thinks, “What can I do for him,

00:20:27.255 --> 00:20:30.047
what food can I cook for him?”

00:20:30.297 --> 00:20:32.588
This is the passion which a mother has.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.671
Even if she doesn’t have the ingredients, she might borrow

00:20:36.047 --> 00:20:38.797
them from the neighbors and prepare some sweets for you.

00:20:39.047 --> 00:20:41.546
She always feel that she has not done enough.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.922
Unless and until we have this kind of collective passion

00:20:46.172 --> 00:20:48.089
from inside and have this kind of feeling about others,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.546
no country can progress, neither our own nor other countries.

00:20:52.047 --> 00:20:54.755
But we always have the urge to take things from others,

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.339
to plunder from others, to borrow from others or

00:20:57.546 --> 00:20:59.505
to deceive others. Because of this urge our children

00:20:59.922 --> 00:21:02.339
will suffer, we will suffer and we will not be able

00:21:02.546 --> 00:21:05.505
to achieve anything in this country.

00:21:05.963 --> 00:21:09.671
In My in-law’s village (inaudible)…to build a lake.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.546
The government gave them money in thousands for the purpose.

00:21:13.047 --> 00:21:14.797
But the lake was never built.

00:21:15.089 --> 00:21:17.380
They said that they had dug a hole to make a lake but then

00:21:17.671 --> 00:21:20.255
they covered it again since they did not find any water.

00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:23.130
But in fact the hole was never dug.

00:21:23.379 --> 00:21:25.838
So where did the money go?

00:21:26.297 --> 00:21:27.922
They sent it to Switzerland (bank).

00:21:27.922 --> 00:21:29.671
So the banks will again borrow from Switzerland and send

00:21:30.005 --> 00:21:31.421
the money again to Switzerland.

00:21:31.755 --> 00:21:33.421
If the Sun acts in this way then we cannot survive

00:21:33.421 --> 00:21:35.214
even for one day.

00:21:35.505 --> 00:21:38.755
If he alone eats (consumes) everything, what can we eat?

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.005
Today we are celebrating the SANKRANTI.

00:21:42.713 --> 00:21:47.463
Sankranti means a sort of Kranti (revolution) by which

00:21:47.797 --> 00:21:49.380
we acquire the habit of giving.

00:21:50.005 --> 00:21:53.713
Everybody says that we should have the habit of giving

00:21:54.255 --> 00:21:57.005
but most of the people believe in donating something

00:21:57.421 --> 00:21:59.713
to the priest.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.713
Also, many people preach the art of giving

00:22:04.005 --> 00:22:06.047
just to fill their own pockets.

00:22:06.588 --> 00:22:08.255
This doesn’t have any meaning.

00:22:09.005 --> 00:22:13.255
There is always a question of whom to give and why to give.

00:22:13.797 --> 00:22:16.172
In fact, in all liberty and freedom, we should see

00:22:16.546 --> 00:22:19.130
for ourselves what we are giving for our country,

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:22.880
for our brothers and sisters and our neighbors.

00:22:23.922 --> 00:22:26.963
We should not be selfish, but give with all our heart

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.421
so that we get all the joy of giving.

00:22:31.379 --> 00:22:34.588
When we give with all our heart, the joy that we get

00:22:35.546 --> 00:22:38.963
cannot be compared with any other joy.

00:22:39.713 --> 00:22:42.130
If we want to feel this kind of joy only, then we should

00:22:42.546 --> 00:22:47.463
celebrate the SANKRANTI today.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.838
Our nature should become like the Sun.

00:22:54.922 --> 00:22:58.130
Whatever he is doing, he doesn’t have the feeling that

00:22:58.755 --> 00:23:02.379
he is doing something. He is doing everything in AKARMA

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:05.379
(without the feeling of doing anything) and constantly

00:23:05.838 --> 00:23:08.963
burning himself and giving you joy, light,

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.089
the essence of living, and he nourishes you.

00:23:14.421 --> 00:23:17.255
We see the Sun every day and many people do Namaskar also,

00:23:17.671 --> 00:23:19.421
but we only do Namaskar without imbibing

00:23:19.755 --> 00:23:21.214
his qualities of giving.

00:23:21.797 --> 00:23:23.797
I told you a very small thing:

00:23:24.255 --> 00:23:26.922
that every Sahaja yogi

00:23:27.214 --> 00:23:30.505
should plant a banyan tree in his garden.

00:23:30.963 --> 00:23:32.380
Why do we have to take money from the government

00:23:32.671 --> 00:23:34.255
for this purpose?

00:23:34.671 --> 00:23:35.922
Just to plant a tree and put a fence around that

00:23:36.255 --> 00:23:37.963
tree doesn’t need much money.

00:23:38.379 --> 00:23:39.671
Even to smoke bidi (tobacco) costs more.

00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:42.047
Try to do this small thing so that others should see that

00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:43.922
you are at least doing something.

00:23:44.588 --> 00:23:46.380
In spite of this we always think how we can get money

00:23:46.797 --> 00:23:48.671
from others, how we can plunder others and how we can

00:23:49.172 --> 00:23:51.297
save money at others cost.

00:23:51.671 --> 00:23:53.880
Because of these tendencies within us,

00:23:54.339 --> 00:23:56.755
our country can never progress.

00:23:57.339 --> 00:23:59.505
We did not have these tendencies before in people,

00:24:00.089 --> 00:24:02.130
in the earlier days.

00:24:02.713 --> 00:24:06.089
I can tell you that when I was young I saw people who

00:24:06.339 --> 00:24:09.671
believed only in giving and never in taking.

00:24:10.339 --> 00:24:13.297
I saw them giving only, they did not like taking.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.421
Even the parents did not like it if the children took

00:24:18.047 --> 00:24:20.505
something from others and would tell them to return it.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.588
I still remember in My father’s house they had made

00:24:22.588 --> 00:24:24.546
some chairs and also an umbrella, out of silver.

00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:28.047
Everybody asked, “Why did you make these out of silver?”

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.546
So the reply was, “When we have marriage ceremonies,

00:24:30.546 --> 00:24:32.838
instead of borrowing or hiring them,

00:24:33.089 --> 00:24:34.630
it would be better that we have them with us once

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:36.588
and for all, because if we had to hire then sometimes

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.630
we did not get them in time because the earlier person

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.255
who had borrowed had not returned them.

00:24:40.505 --> 00:24:41.922
And sometimes these umbrellas were lost because someone

00:24:41.922 --> 00:24:43.838
had never returned them and so they got lost.”

00:24:44.089 --> 00:24:45.297
So what I wanted to say is that if we have money,

00:24:45.755 --> 00:24:47.130
we should invest it into something collective.

00:24:47.379 --> 00:24:48.671
If you want to construct a badminton court,

00:24:48.671 --> 00:24:51.089
then in that court everybody should be able to come

00:24:51.089 --> 00:24:52.546
and play and we should not say that only my children

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.463
should play in that court. If somebody buys a car,

00:24:54.755 --> 00:24:56.005
we should be able to take all the children to school.

00:24:56.421 --> 00:24:58.713
Thus we should buy a big car so that all the children

00:24:59.214 --> 00:25:00.671
can be taken to school.

00:25:01.255 --> 00:25:02.838
This habit of being collective and being useful

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.130
to everybody, one should learn from the Sun.

00:25:05.421 --> 00:25:07.379
And today is a special day when we can learn this thing

00:25:07.671 --> 00:25:11.089
from the Sun. And we should take a vow that

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.713
“I’ll do something which is collective.”

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.671
I do not understand how people can eat without caring

00:25:18.089 --> 00:25:19.630
for the common public.

00:25:20.505 --> 00:25:22.379
You do not even worry about your neighbors and do not

00:25:22.755 --> 00:25:24.130
do anything for the common people.

00:25:24.755 --> 00:25:27.838
I told you a very small thing is to plant a tree.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.922
We have got so many yogis in Maharashtra,

00:25:31.297 --> 00:25:33.671
even if each one plants one tree and looks after it,

00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:36.505
this will be certainly helpful to everybody.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.630
Thus I request all of you to do something collective and

00:25:41.255 --> 00:25:43.130
it will be useful to everybody.

00:25:43.797 --> 00:25:46.421
But one should never think how much will I earn from it

00:25:46.755 --> 00:25:48.297
and make money out of it.

00:25:48.755 --> 00:25:50.671
It should not happen like the way we give money

00:25:51.089 --> 00:25:52.380
to the priest.

00:25:53.005 --> 00:25:54.963
One should open his heart and lovingly do something

00:25:55.255 --> 00:25:56.963
for the collective and feel the joy out of it.

00:25:57.797 --> 00:25:59.755
One should make it a habit.

00:26:00.047 --> 00:26:01.922
I do not want to say that others should have

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.214
everything for free.

00:26:04.588 --> 00:26:06.339
I never said that you do something for free for

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.671
the people who have come from abroad.

00:26:09.172 --> 00:26:11.630
If you look at them you will see that they have brought

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:16.005
so many things for you from abroad to give you as presents.

00:26:16.588 --> 00:26:18.755
Of course I have contributed a lot.

00:26:19.172 --> 00:26:21.089
But they have also brought a lot of things of their own.

00:26:21.463 --> 00:26:23.255
When I saw the presents here, I thought that they were

00:26:23.255 --> 00:26:25.214
the presents which I had bought in Rome for you

00:26:25.463 --> 00:26:27.339
but then they told Me that these were the presents

00:26:27.755 --> 00:26:29.797
which they bought themselves and they had not

00:26:29.797 --> 00:26:32.089
brought My presents.

00:26:32.463 --> 00:26:34.546
They felt such a lot of joy to bring so many things

00:26:34.838 --> 00:26:36.005
for you.

00:26:36.379 --> 00:26:39.047
They do not even know in Italy to whom these presents were

00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:41.421
to be given but they do not bother.

00:26:41.671 --> 00:26:43.463
They leave it to Me to give them to the Sahaja yogis

00:26:43.838 --> 00:26:45.505
here in India.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.130
But in India we have a tendency to think only about

00:26:48.463 --> 00:26:50.838
our children and about our mother.

00:26:51.214 --> 00:26:53.339
Then the mother comes walking, limping on one leg.

00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:56.130
Then you start saying that “My mother did not get

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.214
a high quality sari.”

00:26:58.588 --> 00:27:01.963
Since I do not have one I give her a simple sari.

00:27:02.339 --> 00:27:04.880
This is the tendency here.

00:27:05.214 --> 00:27:07.505
But with the people from abroad it is just the opposite.

00:27:07.797 --> 00:27:09.922
When they came here they came with so many presents

00:27:09.922 --> 00:27:13.089
it seems they brought two tons of presents from abroad.

00:27:13.421 --> 00:27:15.546
Even My hands starting paining while giving these

00:27:15.922 --> 00:27:17.797
two tons of presents.

00:27:18.172 --> 00:27:21.047
What I want to say is that they do not expect anything

00:27:21.463 --> 00:27:23.339
from you. But your behavior should be such as to show

00:27:23.546 --> 00:27:25.963
an example for them. And you should show them that

00:27:25.963 --> 00:27:28.380
you are in no way inferior to them,

00:27:28.797 --> 00:27:30.838
“We are here really to serve you, to welcome you,

00:27:31.172 --> 00:27:32.463
whatever is possible from our side

00:27:32.463 --> 00:27:34.380
we do not hesitate to do.”

00:27:34.713 --> 00:27:36.421
It doesn’t cost any money nor any hard work.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:39.297
The only thing is that we should change our outlook.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.214
If even after coming in Sahaja Yoga we are not able

00:27:42.214 --> 00:27:44.089
to change our nature in this manner then I do not feel

00:27:44.089 --> 00:27:46.713
that we can change the entire humanity with Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:46.963 --> 00:27:48.963
The biggest quality in us is to give to others.

00:27:49.463 --> 00:27:51.463
And this quality we should imbibe within us.

00:27:51.463 --> 00:27:53.421
In Sahaja yoga your Kundalini is awakened and you

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.630
realize your spirit but the essence of spirit is like that

00:27:56.172 --> 00:27:58.005
of the Sun and this essence is of giving.

00:27:58.421 --> 00:28:01.005
If you have seen one photograph of Mine, there is the Sun

00:28:01.255 --> 00:28:02.963
shining on My heart; in fact there is a Sun in My heart

00:28:03.255 --> 00:28:05.588
and because of this I never feel that I should take something

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.380
from them or to plunder anybody.

00:28:09.255 --> 00:28:11.505
I do not understand from which part of your head this idea

00:28:12.047 --> 00:28:13.588
of plundering them comes from.

00:28:14.005 --> 00:28:16.546
This is a very strange behavior.

00:28:16.963 --> 00:28:18.755
Sahaja yogis should not think in this way but on the contrary

00:28:19.005 --> 00:28:21.047
every day we must think what we can give or do for others.

00:28:21.463 --> 00:28:23.339
In Rahuri itself I have started an organization

00:28:23.588 --> 00:28:25.172
whose name is “SAHAJ STREE SUDHAR” or “SAMAJSUDHAR”

00:28:25.546 --> 00:28:27.089
(association for the welfare of women).

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:29.379
Through Life Eternal Trust we cannot use the money for

00:28:29.713 --> 00:28:31.172
the welfare of the women thus we had to create

00:28:31.546 --> 00:28:32.755
this organization.

00:28:33.047 --> 00:28:34.922
This organization has been registered and people from Canada

00:28:35.255 --> 00:28:37.463
and elsewhere are ready to donate to it but here I do not

00:28:37.838 --> 00:28:39.505
find anybody to work for this organization.

00:28:40.005 --> 00:28:42.463
If the local women take it upon themselves to work for this

00:28:42.713 --> 00:28:44.755
organization only then it will succeed.

00:28:45.047 --> 00:28:46.922
We have acquired land and all the facilities but we do not

00:28:47.297 --> 00:28:49.588
find time to devote for this organization.

00:28:50.214 --> 00:28:51.797
So how can we go to this place?

00:28:51.797 --> 00:28:53.588
But one should remember that people are coming from abroad

00:28:53.588 --> 00:28:55.505
with the money to donate for your organization.

00:28:55.755 --> 00:28:57.130
They have brought fourteen machines for the women here.

00:28:57.922 --> 00:29:00.005
You can see women loitering about without doing anything.

00:29:00.463 --> 00:29:02.255
You can ask them to work so that they can earn

00:29:02.255 --> 00:29:04.963
something out of it. And they can prosper.

00:29:04.963 --> 00:29:07.421
At least these things we should try to think about.

00:29:07.797 --> 00:29:09.421
Instead of that we always think about ourselves.

00:29:09.671 --> 00:29:11.255
So the persons who are in Sahaja Yoga should know that this

00:29:11.588 --> 00:29:13.339
selfish attitude is not accepted in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:14.089 --> 00:29:15.963
We should think in terms of global advantage.

00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:18.172
The lives (Vibhouti) of saint are for the salvation

00:29:18.172 --> 00:29:19.838
of the world. And also for the salvation of saint lives,

00:29:20.172 --> 00:29:21.380
this world exists.

00:29:21.797 --> 00:29:23.880
Thus the saints will be blessed by this attitude…

00:29:24.255 --> 00:29:27.421
(VIBHOUTI means Ashes with which Shiva is decorated).

00:29:27.963 --> 00:29:31.255
Now you have become saints you should behave like saints

00:29:31.588 --> 00:29:33.797
and the first quality of a saint is giving.

00:29:33.797 --> 00:29:37.130
You have never heard of a saint plundering anybody.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.922
If a saint thinks of cheating he does not remain a saint.

00:29:41.297 --> 00:29:43.172
Thus from our side we should always think how much

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.172
we can give and what we can give,

00:29:45.421 --> 00:29:49.838
how much love we can give.

00:29:50.214 --> 00:29:51.797
And how many people we can help.

00:29:52.255 --> 00:29:53.922
All our attention should be for this purpose.

00:29:54.797 --> 00:29:56.588
Nowadays there are welfare associations

00:29:57.047 --> 00:29:59.421
just for election purposes.

00:29:59.838 --> 00:30:02.797
We should not create any such type of welfare association.

00:30:03.339 --> 00:30:04.588
But we should create associations in which we can

00:30:04.963 --> 00:30:06.880
work selflessly and our love should be NIRVAJYA (selfless)

00:30:07.379 --> 00:30:09.880
and we should not expect anything in return.

00:30:10.214 --> 00:30:12.463
And there are no limits for our love, it is an endless love.

00:30:12.838 --> 00:30:14.922
When we have this kind of love automatically

00:30:15.379 --> 00:30:17.214
we will know what is to be done.

00:30:17.214 --> 00:30:18.963
The improvements should be done gradually and every

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.797
Sahaja yogi should contribute to this collective welfare.

00:30:22.797 --> 00:30:24.005
We should try to devote our time for this purpose and

00:30:24.297 --> 00:30:26.047
work hard to achieve our goals. It should not happen

00:30:26.463 --> 00:30:28.797
that “Shri Mataji has come, She gives a talk,

00:30:28.797 --> 00:30:30.922
and when She goes everything is finished.”

00:30:30.922 --> 00:30:32.922
These people (from abroad) have done a lot.

00:30:32.922 --> 00:30:35.379
They have started schools and social welfare.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.505
We should also start something in this manner.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.755
Sahaja Yoga should not become an association of people

00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:42.379
who have realized the spirit and are swimming in the joy

00:30:42.379 --> 00:30:45.380
but are lazy lumps.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.089
It should not happen this way.

00:30:49.089 --> 00:30:52.339
We should try to see how we can help others.

00:30:52.339 --> 00:30:55.255
We should open our eyes to look around us with love

00:30:55.255 --> 00:30:57.588
and try to see how we can help others.

00:30:58.047 --> 00:31:02.214
Still I have not been able to move to India.

00:31:02.588 --> 00:31:04.671
Once I come back to India you will see that

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:07.214
I will make everyone work.

00:31:07.214 --> 00:31:09.339
Thus it is advisable to start working before I come.

00:31:09.339 --> 00:31:11.838
Sahaja Yoga is not meant only for sitting and meditating.

00:31:11.838 --> 00:31:13.713
For meditating why do you need Sahaja Yoga?

00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:15.713
You can go the Himalayas.

00:31:16.089 --> 00:31:17.797
If you want to stay here and be in Sahaja Yoga then

00:31:18.047 --> 00:31:20.089
the common people should be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:20.588 --> 00:31:22.671
But Sahaja Yoga should not become like these

00:31:22.671 --> 00:31:24.505
modern welfare organizations.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:27.214
We should try to achieve our goals with full sincerity

00:31:27.505 --> 00:31:29.797
and only then we can say that we have established Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.713
Now I heard a lot of praise for Me.

00:31:34.255 --> 00:31:37.089
I heard the songs and they gave Me a lot of Joy and

00:31:37.463 --> 00:31:40.047
satisfaction that people have recognized Me.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.963
But you should remember one thing – you should work

00:31:43.214 --> 00:31:44.838
in order to know yourself because you cannot see

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.797
yourself in the mirror.

00:31:47.214 --> 00:31:49.255
You should be able to see what you have achieved,

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.379
like in the earlier days you used to look after

00:31:51.797 --> 00:31:53.755
your household, your children. In the same manner,

00:31:54.005 --> 00:31:56.339
if you are not able to work for the collective,

00:31:56.339 --> 00:31:58.505
then in My opinion, you have not achieved anything

00:31:58.797 --> 00:32:00.797
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:01.047 --> 00:32:03.089
You have remained where you were,

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:05.380
you have not progressed at all.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.838
Next year when I come, you should be able to tell Me

00:32:10.297 --> 00:32:12.379
how many banyan trees you have planted.

00:32:12.922 --> 00:32:16.421
Secondly, you should be able to tell Me what collective

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.546
or social work you have done.

00:32:19.005 --> 00:32:21.130
If you try to look around you will definitely be able

00:32:21.546 --> 00:32:23.671
to see some collective work which you can do

00:32:24.089 --> 00:32:25.922
and you should do.

00:32:26.963 --> 00:32:28.505
I’m sure you will be able to do it very well.

00:32:28.922 --> 00:32:30.797
It doesn’t need any money – only you have to decide

00:32:31.339 --> 00:32:32.755
within your heart. When I started Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:33.172 --> 00:32:34.713
at that time I’d given realization to one lady only

00:32:35.172 --> 00:32:37.005
and I started without any money.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.671
I did not have support from anybody but even then

00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:41.797
I started Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:42.339 --> 00:32:45.380
But because of honesty of the work and the consistency,

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:47.797
it has spread so much.

00:32:48.172 --> 00:32:49.297
Now each one of you, man or woman,

00:32:49.963 --> 00:32:52.379
you have the responsibility that when you will

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.172
introduce Sahaja Yoga to the general public,

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.630
you will be able to give them some proof of the general

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.214
well being. You need not break any law for this.

00:33:03.505 --> 00:33:05.880
You need not do anything wrong nor need you do

00:33:06.172 --> 00:33:09.047
anything unlawful. In a very simple way if you just

00:33:09.421 --> 00:33:11.713
open your eyes you will be able to see what you can do

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.797
for the general welfare of the people,

00:33:13.797 --> 00:33:16.130
how you can help the wellbeing of the people.

00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:18.630
And I’m here to give you all the strength and energy

00:33:19.005 --> 00:33:20.546
to do this work.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.797
We do not need any vote nor any money or anything else.

00:33:23.172 --> 00:33:24.755
You should give you Me a promise that without expecting

00:33:25.047 --> 00:33:27.005
anything in return you will start working for

00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:29.880
the welfare of the people.

00:33:30.255 --> 00:33:32.380
Sometimes, it might so happen that when people start

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.005
some welfare work they go round asking for funds.

00:33:35.005 --> 00:33:37.005
This is wrong. We should not ask for money in the beginning.

00:33:37.005 --> 00:33:39.630
First you should start some work which does not need money.

00:33:39.922 --> 00:33:41.880
Everyone feels that without money we cannot do anything.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.172
You have got the powers so why do you need money?

00:33:44.546 --> 00:33:47.838
If somebody is sick or not well in your neighborhood

00:33:48.214 --> 00:33:52.005
then you can go and visit him and try to soothe that person.

00:33:53.713 --> 00:33:54.922
Instead of that, what I see is that

00:33:55.297 --> 00:33:56.713
you bring the sick person to Me.

00:33:57.089 --> 00:33:58.421
The other day, someone brought

00:33:58.421 --> 00:34:00.214
an injured person to Me. He had a broken arm.

00:34:00.463 --> 00:34:02.214
A Sahaja yogi could have treated him in two minutes and

00:34:02.421 --> 00:34:04.214
made him well but instead of that, they brought him to Me

00:34:04.505 --> 00:34:05.713
and that too right in the middle of a public program

00:34:06.005 --> 00:34:07.505
and asked Me to treat his arm.

00:34:07.838 --> 00:34:09.172
You are so many and all the powers are flowing

00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:11.463
through your hands but still you do not use them.

00:34:11.797 --> 00:34:15.505
If you are not able to treat even these small ailments

00:34:16.297 --> 00:34:20.379
what is the use of you being a Sahaja yogi? Someone says,

00:34:21.214 --> 00:34:23.880
"my mother is sick, my father has broken his leg.”

00:34:24.797 --> 00:34:29.005
Instead of bringing them to Me you can easily treat them.

00:34:29.421 --> 00:34:32.463
You do have the powers, try to use them.

00:34:33.089 --> 00:34:35.130
Thus you should be able to help the people without

00:34:36.047 --> 00:34:39.214
expecting anything in return and with full Joy.

00:34:39.797 --> 00:34:42.505
You will be able to feel a lot of joy when you have

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:45.630
the feeling that you do not do anything but you are just

00:34:48.047 --> 00:34:50.963
an instrument of God and you are living in this world,

00:34:52.089 --> 00:34:55.379
in this country and you are giving something special to them.

00:34:56.005 --> 00:34:58.463
It is such a big thing, such a big understanding.

00:34:58.713 --> 00:35:00.339
With such a feeling, if all of you decide to work,

00:35:00.755 --> 00:35:03.755
then, you will be able to do something for others

00:35:04.421 --> 00:35:07.546
and other people will see what Sahaja Yoga is.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.379
Now people think what is Sahaja Yoga –

00:35:11.922 --> 00:35:14.421
just everybody meditating together and that’s all.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.172
Even if there is some problem in the country Sahaja yogis

00:35:17.421 --> 00:35:19.546
are just sitting in meditation.

00:35:19.922 --> 00:35:21.797
One man came and told Me, “My wife doesn’t cook.”

00:35:21.797 --> 00:35:23.838
I asked, “Why?” He said, “She just meditates.”

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:26.005
So I said, “Is it so? But who told her that?”

00:35:26.255 --> 00:35:28.339
First she should cook, for meditation even

00:35:28.588 --> 00:35:30.546
five minutes are sufficient.

00:35:30.797 --> 00:35:33.047
I have given you the power and the energy to cook well.

00:35:33.047 --> 00:35:36.130
Thus one should have the confidence

00:35:37.713 --> 00:35:41.047
that you are capable of work.

00:35:41.546 --> 00:35:43.546
I am giving you the powers, you can assimilate them.

00:35:43.838 --> 00:35:46.047
If you just meditate every day it is not sufficient.

00:35:46.047 --> 00:35:48.379
You have to see what wellbeing you are

00:35:48.838 --> 00:35:52.380
giving to the others.

00:35:53.089 --> 00:35:55.130
But instead of that, you always think about your own wellbeing

00:35:55.379 --> 00:35:57.047
and come and ask Me to treat your son, your father,

00:35:57.047 --> 00:35:58.838
your mother, or ask that you should get a good job.

00:35:59.089 --> 00:36:00.255
And you want that I should also come to your house

00:36:00.505 --> 00:36:01.421
to eat, do this, do that.

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.630
This way, you try to impose your will upon Me

00:36:03.838 --> 00:36:07.421
but about you, what can you do?

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.546
You should always remember that you have to do something.

00:36:10.838 --> 00:36:12.505
“I will show Shri Mataji what I’m capable of,

00:36:12.922 --> 00:36:14.630
to do something special.”

00:36:15.005 --> 00:36:18.089
We should decide this once and for all.

00:36:18.546 --> 00:36:23.546
I have an image in front of My eyes as Shri Gyaneshwara

00:36:23.963 --> 00:36:30.047
has said, "BOLTE PIYUSHANCHE SAGAR."

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.588
(Words or sayings are like the oceans of nectar)

00:36:37.421 --> 00:36:40.297
Where is it? I want to see it.

00:36:41.797 --> 00:36:44.379
Thus on this auspicious day I give you

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.630
all My sweet blessings that you will help everyone

00:36:47.379 --> 00:36:49.546
and look after their wellbeing and you will treat

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.505
everyone with love and you will talk sweetly,

00:36:54.047 --> 00:36:56.838
full of love.

00:37:21.089 --> 00:37:22.713
He is saying you should put your hands

00:37:23.297 --> 00:37:26.130
like this to say that you are bound by Mother's words.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.380
And we will try to do good to others and

00:37:29.755 --> 00:37:33.047
we will be very kind to each other.

00:37:37.463 --> 00:37:41.671
I've been telling them that we have to be collective

00:37:42.214 --> 00:37:44.463
not among only Sahaja Yogis but with others also.

00:37:44.838 --> 00:37:47.089
We should see surroundings, what's wrong where,

00:37:47.505 --> 00:37:52.713
how we can help. We have many social obligations

00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:54.838
which we have to fulfill.

00:37:55.214 --> 00:37:57.963
Now you have reached the stage where you can do that

00:37:58.339 --> 00:38:03.922
without forming any social organization which collects money

00:38:04.339 --> 00:38:06.838
and have saints and things that kind of a nonsense.

00:38:07.297 --> 00:38:11.255
But you can see around yourself who are the needy,

00:38:11.588 --> 00:38:13.797
to whom you can help.

00:38:14.214 --> 00:38:16.339
And that is how you can really give

00:38:16.713 --> 00:38:20.380
a very positive form to Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:36.172 --> 00:38:38.172
Marathi

00:38:56.713 --> 00:38:58.047
Rahurila

00:48:23.339 --> 00:48:26.463
I'll be giving this water to all of you

00:48:27.089 --> 00:48:32.339
all the leaders and aslo..

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.922
you can take it.

00:48:35.755 --> 00:48:37.214
this water is very good for

00:48:37.671 --> 00:48:42.546
all diseases of the Mooladhara chakra.
