00:00:05.487 --> 00:00:08.154
And this is how the things go on accumulating

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:11.428
which has no value aesthetically or in any way.

00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:15.156
Actually you should buy something
only to give it to someone.

00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:19.362
That's the best way of enjoying it
to the maximum, you see.

00:00:19.443 --> 00:00:21.443
And anybody likes it - have it.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.349
You see, that's the best way.
It's a great thing,

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.239
I mean I tell you it's rather difficult
for you people to understand,

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.173
but I am one of them who does that very often,

00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:34.778
and my children and my husband
are rather worried you know,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.448
"God knows next time what She'll give away."

00:00:38.529 --> 00:00:40.529
But you'll be amazed I've so many things,

00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:42.490
so many things, despite all this,

00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.404
I mean the whole time thinking
what to give to whom,

00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:49.573
still it's so many things in the house, now
that we have to take a bigger house.

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:52.240
I don't know what to do with so many things

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:56.404
and I try to thrust things on the people,
"Baba you take this you have liked it."

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:58.531
But they say: "No no no how can you give me."

00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:01.823
But really that gives me such a pleasure,

00:01:01.904 --> 00:01:04.323
and one must learn how to do.

00:01:04.404 --> 00:01:08.154
But I've have seen human beings are different.
For themselves they'll buy diamonds,

00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:11.613
and for others they'll buy artificial things.

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:13.487
It's very common you know.

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:15.535
They will buy for, they are wearing diamonds

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:18.620
and when it is coming to giving to others
they'll give artificial.

00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:21.033
At least don't wear at that time the diamond.

00:01:21.114 --> 00:01:23.114
At least that much decency should be there.

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:27.365
So you see when it comes to giving,
give it with your full heart.

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:29.653
You just feel that love of giving

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:34.339
and you feel so happy, because
you feel so big about yourself,

00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:37.820
like an ocean that's giving so much of clouds

00:01:37.862 --> 00:01:41.948
and again it is receiving these rivers into it,
and again making it into clouds,

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:46.904
a sort of a circle of beautiful
conversion into beauty

00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:49.362
after beauty starts, it's so beautiful.

00:01:49.862 --> 00:01:52.820
And that's what we should try to become,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:56.279
a part of that circle, which is so beautiful

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:59.667
and which is so joy giving, to yourself also.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.154
And this is what it is, and this hand is
for ashraya, means for the protection.

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:10.654
You must protect the people
who are your subordinates,

00:02:10.778 --> 00:02:13.529
who are dependent on you, your children.

00:02:13.778 --> 00:02:18.130
Like, it's a very common thing to insult
your children from their childhood.

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.565
Why did you spoil that carpet?

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.618
Why did you do that? You should not have
said this, why did you?

00:02:24.698 --> 00:02:27.070
This is a very wrong thing of discipline.

00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:31.174
Best discipline is to put dignity into children.

00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:35.323
You see, a good home in India we'll say,

00:02:35.404 --> 00:02:39.114
is known by the way children
are addressed in the family.

00:02:39.195 --> 00:02:44.945
Like, in a good family we address the children like "Sa".

00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:47.911
Little bit like that, ap, means 'Sir'.

00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:51.240
We never address the children with indignity,

00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:54.341
and we put them on a dignified level.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.682
And it's a very nice thing.

00:02:57.762 --> 00:03:00.198
I'll tell you about my own granddaughter,

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:07.321
that, somebody was telling her one day that,
there's a very, this boy

00:03:07.452 --> 00:03:09.024
and why don't you marry him.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.383
She said: 'Why do you want
to talk about marriage?

00:03:11.464 --> 00:03:14.695
I'm not yet grown at all
to think about marriage,

00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:17.571
and we have to be dignified about things,

00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:20.906
how can we think of marriage
when we are not to think,

00:03:20.987 --> 00:03:25.571
and my grandmother will marry me
and I want to live, a dignified person.'

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:29.737
A little girl of seven years said this
to this woman who was very,

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:32.904
sort of pseudo-intellectual type and she tried

00:03:32.987 --> 00:03:36.778
to tease my granddaughter.
She said: 'It's not dignified'.

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:41.404
Just think of that. At the age of seven years
they have their sense of dignity.

00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:45.496
If you tell them, you see they, you need
not tell them don't spoil the carpet,

00:03:45.583 --> 00:03:48.060
but give them dignity they will never spoil it.
