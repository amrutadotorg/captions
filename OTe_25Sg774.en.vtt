WEBVTT

03:18.694 --> 03:33.333
I hope you are all very comfortable now and
that you are enjoying the food as well. [Applause]

03:33.333 --> 03:44.034
Also we are approaching the fag end of our
tour. This tour was arranged, as you know,

03:44.034 --> 03:53.773
like a journey through your Shushumna Nadi.
At different, different points different,

03:53.773 --> 03:59.424
different Chakras in the same way we have
passed through various places and now we have

03:59.424 --> 04:05.264
reached Ganapatipule where we have to get
our Sahasrara fully drenched with blessings

04:05.264 --> 04:17.453
of Shri Ganesh. As you know Sahaja Yoga is
a very subtler happening within us. It's a

04:17.453 --> 04:26.525
very subtler happening and this subtler happening
gives you sensitivity to Divine joy. When

04:26.525 --> 04:31.624
you start getting the Divine joy you don't
care for any comforts, you don't care for

04:31.624 --> 04:38.423
all worldly type of pleasure giving things.
To you, this becomes the most important thing

04:38.423 --> 04:49.423
and the only thing. Apart from that you start
seeing the truth as it is. When I say you

04:49.423 --> 04:58.874
start seeing the truth many people can misuse
this word. I've seen many people saying that

04:58.874 --> 05:07.644
they can decide things on vibrations and they
have decided certain things on vibrations.

05:07.644 --> 05:12.874
But they commit mistakes. That means they
have not yet grown up to that state where

05:12.874 --> 05:20.853
they can decide on vibrations. So nobody should
arbitrarily decide but consult the collective,

05:20.853 --> 05:28.354
especially your leaders to find out if whatever
decision you have taken, whatever you have

05:28.354 --> 05:36.734
thought of, is it all right or not. And one
may commit lots of mistakes if you start behaving

05:36.734 --> 05:45.284
arbitrarily. The greatest law of Sahaja Yoga
is that it is a collective happening.

05:45.284 --> 05:49.624
Now as you have seen here people are from
abroad, people are from Delhi, people are

05:49.624 --> 05:56.984
from Calcutta, people from Bombay, people
from villages, people from various places.

05:56.984 --> 06:03.794
The idea of all of you coming here is to,
is to create the understanding of the collective.

06:03.794 --> 06:09.064
As people start becoming collective and collective
they do not bother others, they do not trouble

06:09.064 --> 06:15.744
others, but they give joy to others. They
are not bothered about their going and coming,

06:15.744 --> 06:25.544
their eating and everything, they just don't
behave like mundane, usual type of people.

06:25.544 --> 06:32.324
But they are very patient, Saburi as they
call it. They are in the patience. Now this

06:32.324 --> 06:43.544
patience is most joy giving. Patience gives
you the greatest joy. When you are patient

06:43.544 --> 06:50.674
you develop all your qualities. I think in
patience you blossom the best. But patience

06:50.674 --> 06:58.994
is not be patient, be patient. Patience is
also a kind of a state within us with just

06:58.994 --> 07:07.814
this patience, Saburi as they call it. You
just watch and see. Wherever you are you are.

07:07.814 --> 07:14.524
Now some people are worried that they must
get into the bus. Some people are worried

07:14.524 --> 07:19.654
they must reach back home. Some people are
worried they must get their food in time.

07:19.654 --> 07:25.864
According to them this is discipline. This
is not. This is conditioning. But what is

07:25.864 --> 07:33.494
the discipline is of patience in Sahaja Yoga.
Where you watch everything and you are patient.

07:33.494 --> 07:37.684
If you are in the bus you are there. If you
are standing on the road you are there. If

07:37.684 --> 07:42.674
you are walking on the road you are there.
On the contrary it is a good idea to walk.

07:42.674 --> 07:48.854
I wish I could but I can't because once I
start walking everybody will fall at My feet.

07:48.854 --> 07:58.824
Nobody will spare Me. So I am just imprisoned
inside the house, inside the room all day

07:58.824 --> 08:03.214
long because I just can't come out as soon
as I come out I find there hosts of people

08:03.214 --> 08:10.004
standing outside. But your case is not such.
You are free people. You are not bound like

08:10.004 --> 08:17.805
Me. So it's nice to walk a little bit in the
evening time, it's a good idea. It’s a very

08:17.805 --> 08:22.884
good idea, leisurely you can walk, that will
digest your food. The food is rather heavy

08:22.884 --> 08:30.504
sometimes. It makes you feel better and just
know that you are walking that's all. To feel

08:30.504 --> 08:34.474
that I have to walk, I have to go there, once
you start thinking you get exhausted sitting

08:34.474 --> 08:42.164
here, even if you have not walked. So, it
is important that patience should be made

08:42.164 --> 08:44.314
the discipline of life.

08:44.314 --> 08:51.174
How much patient we are for anything, for
anything. Now as you can see, I have to sit

08:51.174 --> 08:56.524
here before I don't come you can not start,
till I have to sit here till you finish. You

08:56.524 --> 09:03.084
are all free you can get up, walk about, come
whenever you feel like I am not. And how do

09:03.084 --> 09:09.394
I manage all this, is through My patience.
But patience is My quality. It's My nature

09:09.394 --> 09:15.794
which I enjoy the most of all. Now I am sitting
here is nobody is there I am enjoying it.

09:15.794 --> 09:27.054
If I am lost somewhere I enjoy it. If I lost
My way I enjoy it because I am there to enjoy

09:27.054 --> 09:33.934
Myself. So I think we should make a practice
now the Moon is out, beautiful moonlit nights,

09:33.934 --> 09:38.654
try to walk down, especially the Delhi people
must walk. They don't just walk. In Delhi

09:38.654 --> 09:44.144
is all right because you can not walk about,
there is danger and all that but here is better.

09:44.144 --> 09:49.404
You better walk your health will improve.
Sahaja Yoga will improve. Kundalini will improve.

09:49.404 --> 09:51.464
You'll feel much better.

09:51.464 --> 10:00.763
That's the good part of this remote place
that nobody sees you. Nobody is bothered about

10:00.763 --> 10:05.244
you. You can live whatever way you like you
can walk the way you like. There is nobody

10:05.244 --> 10:10.293
to bother. There is no need to have a competition
or run about but just leisurely if you walk

10:10.293 --> 10:18.554
it is a good idea. I am not saying just to
save some money out of the buses. But it is

10:18.554 --> 10:24.714
just to make you feel more healthy, just sitting
all the time one feels very funny sit here,

10:24.714 --> 10:30.184
sit there, sit there, going in a taxi, going
in a bus, going in a lift, you just don't

10:30.184 --> 10:36.894
move your legs. There is no exercise also
in Sahaja Yoga. Walking is the best exercise

10:36.894 --> 10:42.594
for all the Sahaja Yogis as I told you. And
that's why it is important that you all should

10:42.594 --> 10:48.804
try to walk a little bit, if possible. For
there are ladies who have children, that is

10:48.804 --> 10:56.974
all right, old ladies, old men but even them
it's a good idea to walk half a way and then

10:56.974 --> 11:02.013
you can go by buses. Something like that try
to adjust yourself for these three, four days.

11:02.013 --> 11:11.204
You'll feel much better. I promise you will
feel much better when you walk now.

11:11.204 --> 11:22.744
And another thing, which one has to learn
apart from Saburi from the patience. One has

11:22.744 --> 11:31.754
to imbibe within one self is the sweetness.
If you are sweet you are filled with humor,

11:31.754 --> 11:41.513
you do not hurt others, you are not hurt either,
you see everything so beautiful and nice,

11:41.513 --> 11:50.234
that's the quality of Shri Krishna, Madhurya.
Anything can be done with sweetness. That's

11:50.234 --> 11:55.374
very important. Now some people might say,
“Mother, sometimes You have to get angry

11:55.374 --> 11:59.713
and all that.” There, is no need for you
that I can do that dirty job. You don't have

11:59.713 --> 12:07.574
to. You don't have to get angry with anyone.
You just show your patience, your love, your

12:07.574 --> 12:11.744
kindness, your sweetness. That is how the
personality of Sahaja Yoga, which is a collective

12:11.744 --> 12:18.314
being, is to be built by people who have patience,
who are sweet outwardly, inwardly.

12:18.314 --> 12:26.604
And the third one is the genuineness. Without
genuineness we can not enter into ourselves

12:26.604 --> 12:33.394
because our inner being knows what we are.
If there is hypocrisy, if there is just showing

12:33.394 --> 12:41.695
off or if there is a kind of a reservation
within us we can not enter inside us. Also

12:41.695 --> 12:48.164
the people who come in contact with such people
can not progress. So one has to be very genuine

12:48.164 --> 12:52.214
about it and this is an individual quality,
is not a Samuhik [MEANS collective –SG]

12:52.214 --> 12:58.334
quality. It is not a collective quality. All
of us have to be genuine within ourselves

12:58.334 --> 13:04.664
because it is for our gain, for our Hitha.
So we have to be collective because it is

13:04.664 --> 13:11.164
good for us. We have to be patient because
it is good for us and we have to be genuine

13:11.164 --> 13:18.444
because it is good for us. It’s all Swartha.
It is all the meaning of Swa, Swartha, Swa

13:18.444 --> 13:24.914
means ourselves, and Artha means the meaning.
And Swartha also means selfishness but actually

13:24.914 --> 13:28.564
it is self, and self and self.

13:28.564 --> 13:36.524
Now you are changed people. Your personality
is different. It's shining through your Spirit.

13:36.524 --> 13:42.324
In that Spirit you have to see everything.
All your conditionings will drop out as soon

13:42.324 --> 13:47.524
as you start identifying your Self fully,
fully with the Spirit. Fully again I say because

13:47.524 --> 13:55.523
we do not, we are still Christians, we are
still Hindus, we are still Muslims. We are

13:55.523 --> 14:05.484
still Indians, English this that. We are still
narrow-minded small little puddles. We have

14:05.484 --> 14:14.354
to be the ocean. Once you are identified with
the ocean we have to throw away everything

14:14.354 --> 14:22.484
and become absolutely clean and detached,
Nisanga. So when we are singing all these

14:22.484 --> 14:27.904
songs we are saying this. It should not be
a lip service. It should be flow in our heart.

14:27.904 --> 14:33.724
We should feel it. But I am happy that your
Spirits are shining and the Spirit is enjoying

14:33.724 --> 14:39.554
and that you are moving very smoothly upward.
Little push will help you more and understanding

14:39.554 --> 14:41.364
about it.

14:41.364 --> 14:48.034
This time it has been a much better seminar
as I have seen it. We must have a proper seminar,

14:48.034 --> 14:53.684
may be tomorrow morning we might try to have
a proper seminar of this brain trust or something

14:53.684 --> 14:59.254
but most of the people who are coming will
be really coming tomorrow. So I don't know

14:59.254 --> 15:03.584
may be tomorrow evening you can have brain
trust. They’ll be coming tomorrow sometime,

15:03.584 --> 15:09.023
there’s hardly any time for a seminar which
I would like you all to sit down and have

15:09.023 --> 15:14.564
a proper brain trust or something or you can
have it tomorrow morning and also you can

15:14.564 --> 15:20.295
have it day after tomorrow sometime. So something
can be arranged by the leaders and all the

15:20.295 --> 15:24.654
leaders of the world should meet and should
do it.

15:24.654 --> 15:34.484
As the program stands it is so. But in Sahaja
Yoga programs are never just the same. Changing

15:34.484 --> 15:43.213
is the sign of life. As I told you a little
root has got a very little small tiny cell

15:43.213 --> 15:48.963
at the end of it which is very discreet and
it changes its course according to the way

15:48.963 --> 15:54.474
it can penetrate into the Mother Earth. If
there is a big boulder it goes round and round

15:54.474 --> 16:01.184
and round to create a bondage for it later
on for the tree to stand on. Then it goes

16:01.184 --> 16:07.914
into all various areas in a proper manner
whichever way the best and Sahaj. In the same

16:07.914 --> 16:13.534
way it's a living process and whatever works
out has to be worked out in that manner. Sometimes

16:13.534 --> 16:18.054
you might sleep at ten o'clock, sometimes
you may sleep at one o'clock. Sometimes you

16:18.054 --> 16:24.444
may sleep at anytime. It depends on whatever
way the things are moving. We have to be prepared

16:24.444 --> 16:28.554
for everything in a very sweet manner with
an enjoyable manner.

16:28.554 --> 16:36.934
So once, we start deciding that we are going
to be great Sahaja Yogis, we are here to be

16:36.934 --> 16:45.954
the Nirmalites, to fight all that is wrong,
to stand for right and to emancipate the whole

16:45.954 --> 16:54.144
humanity. If you understand the tremendous
work we have to do, then you will create your

16:54.144 --> 17:01.594
own personalities in such way that you will
be able to shoulder this great responsibility.

17:01.594 --> 17:11.864
So let us see, today is the beginning of this
understanding between us that we are not going

17:11.864 --> 17:21.244
to grow by demanding, by asking, by getting
worried about ourselves. But just be enjoy,

17:21.244 --> 17:26.054
just be enjoy and this is what is lacking
in some people and that's why they cannot

17:26.054 --> 17:29.744
enjoy. They are all the time worried how will
they reach there, how will they come here,

17:29.744 --> 17:34.624
what is the arrangement, what's this, what
is that. Just take it easy and things will

17:34.624 --> 17:37.784
work out for you. That's how you are going
to enjoy life.

17:37.784 --> 17:38.824
May God bless you all!
