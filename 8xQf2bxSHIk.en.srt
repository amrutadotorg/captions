1
00:00:08,181 --> 00:00:11,820
As you see here on the left hand
side this blue line is there.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,201
This blue line is our power of desire

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,220
by which we desire, by which God has – supposing
this is the primordial being because God has made

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,886
you in His own image – supposing it is
the image of God, then it is His desire.

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,140
This power of desire gives you existence, and
when this desire is over, when the Spirit,

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:48,480
which is watching the drama of this body, gets
fed up, it disappears, then the death comes in.

7
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,069
This power of desire is the left side.

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,720
We call it in Sanskrit as Ida Nadi,

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,140
also called as the Moon Nadi and
in the Hatha Yoga is the Tha Nadi.

10
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,660
This is the channel, is a subtle channel.

11
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,260
But this gives rise to the gross channel,
which is the left sympathetic nervous system.

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,580
Now, doctors don’t believe that left and right
sympathetic nervous systems are two different,

13
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,240
but you will find out yourself
that they are very different.

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,920
This looks after our emotional
side, and also beyond this lies

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,880
the area which is unknown to us, is
the subconscious; it is unknown to us.

16
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,260
Whatever is unknown is not
God, is not from God’s area.

17
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,000
It is an unknown area, and
beyond that subconscious area,

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,762
lies the collective subconscious –
all that has died from our creation.
