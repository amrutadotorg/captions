00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:05.128
So now let us give ourselves a nice bandhan.

00:00:05.248 --> 00:00:10.081
In the Bandhan of Mother let us move our left to the right.

00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:14.813
One, nicely, understanding what you are, what are your auras.

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.782
Now again, second one.

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:23.236
Now the third one.

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:30.121
Now the fourth one.

00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:36.186
Now the fifth.

00:00:38.648 --> 00:00:41.776
Now the sixth one.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:46.214
And now the seventh.

00:00:46.334 --> 00:00:48.703
Now raise your Kundalini.

00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:51.894
Raise your Kundalini, slowly, very slowly.

00:00:52.014 --> 00:00:54.759
Raise it, first time you have to do it very slowly.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.645
Now push back your heads, and give it a knot,

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:00.340
one knot.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.451
Second one, let's do it, very slowly

00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:06.906
and knowing what you are, you're a saint.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:10.322
Do it, properly, properly, do it properly, not in a haste.

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:12.593
Take it to your head, push back your head

00:01:12.713 --> 00:01:17.884
and give it two knots there, one and two.

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:19.317
Now let's do the other one.

00:01:19.437 --> 00:01:23.133
Again the third one we have to give three knots.

00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:29.487
Very slowly do it, very slowly. Now do it properly.

00:01:29.607 --> 00:01:36.772
Now push back your head, now give it the third one, three times.

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:44.446
Now see your vibrations.

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:52.002
See your vibrations like this

00:01:52.554 --> 00:01:57.439
All the children, see your vibrations like this. Put your hands.

00:02:23.112 --> 00:02:30.456
Beautiful. I am getting vibrations from you.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.640
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
