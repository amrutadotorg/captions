00:02.980 --> 00:11.719
Today we have gathered here to do
the Sahastrara puja.

00:12.711 --> 00:19.891
Sahastrar, the word ‘sahastr’, in Sanskrit
language, means ‘one thousand’.

00:20.092 --> 00:30.553
And there are one thousand petals
in our brain, which get enlightened.

00:30.754 --> 00:37.198
Of course, the doctors are quarrelling
on that point, but forget about them.

00:37.492 --> 00:45.371
Now these petals are kept ready
for our enlightenment,

00:46.277 --> 00:54.332
and these are really the nerves,
one thousand nerves,

00:54.533 --> 00:59.943
which are there for the enlightenment
of the brain.

01:00.451 --> 01:11.660
So when the Kundalini rises, she enlightens
those one thousand nerves

01:11.861 --> 01:20.953
which become like a –

01:21.154 --> 01:33.454
as you see here, the shape of these
flames – like a petal.

01:34.279 --> 01:43.949
And that’s why it is called as ‘Sahastrara’
- is the centre of Sahastrara.

01:44.150 --> 01:51.938
In the human beings it is a very important
centre,

01:52.139 --> 01:59.433
because this is the only centre by which
we think

01:59.634 --> 02:07.532
and we try to stop whatever we don’t like.

02:08.326 --> 02:15.996
This is the centre which reacts, reacts
in such a manner

02:16.197 --> 02:24.035
that, without any discretion we start
saying, ‘no’ to this, and, ‘no’ to that,

02:24.236 --> 02:29.517
on small things also. Like somebody might
say, “I don’t like this carpet,”

02:29.718 --> 02:34.514
“I don’t like this house,” “I don’t
like that.”

02:37.792 --> 02:43.806
This language itself shows that – who
are you? First find out!

02:44.007 --> 02:48.721
But you cannot become yourself unless
and until this Sahastrara,

02:48.922 --> 02:57.800
this brain is opened out and the Kundalini
becomes one with the Paramchaitanya.

02:59.832 --> 03:08.969
Before that, you are in complete ignorance
about what is good and what is bad.

03:09.170 --> 03:15.237
Whatever you think [that], for this brain,
is good, you do it.

03:15.438 --> 03:20.095
But whatever is really good, you do
not know,

03:20.296 --> 03:24.478
because you do not know the Reality.

03:25.510 --> 03:30.193
Now we have to understand the consciousness
that we have:

03:30.394 --> 03:36.987
consciousness of being alive, consciousness
of so many things we have,

03:37.188 --> 03:42.641
and the so-called knowledge we have
about everything.

03:43.220 --> 03:50.062
All that consciousness is stored near
the liver – for your information –

03:50.308 --> 03:53.239
by this diaphragm.

03:53.440 --> 03:58.966
But then, this consciousness starts rising,
higher and higher.

03:59.167 --> 04:03.699
Then you become aware. In the evolutionary
process,

04:03.900 --> 04:08.953
you become aware, aware of things.

04:09.154 --> 04:16.492
Without going through your brain, you just
become aware. And how?

04:16.693 --> 04:22.487
Not by thinking, not by understanding
or seeing,

04:22.688 --> 04:28.785
but you become aware because
your brain has now

04:28.986 --> 04:36.219
started working in a manner that’s very,
very sensitive.

04:36.420 --> 04:42.230
So you just become aware of some sort
of a fear,

04:42.431 --> 04:49.075
or maybe some sort of a goodness
or anything. But it goes even further.

04:49.276 --> 04:54.457
The growth of consciousness, which becomes
aware, goes further:

04:54.658 --> 05:04.670
where you start liking a person,
or disliking a person.

05:06.441 --> 05:11.709
But, still it’s nothing definite and sure.

05:11.910 --> 05:16.345
You dislike a person because he has
a particular type of a face,

05:16.546 --> 05:20.304
maybe eyes or maybe anything.

05:21.277 --> 05:28.333
Or maybe because you have known
somebody who has been very nice,

05:28.534 --> 05:34.661
so you start transferring that image
onto others.

05:34.862 --> 05:42.908
With these transferred images, you can
hate or love someone.

05:43.109 --> 05:48.811
Then you start saying, “I hate this,
I hate that,”

05:49.363 --> 05:54.061
which has no, actually, substantial
meaning.

05:54.262 --> 06:02.789
You hate it because, perhaps, maybe such
and such person looks like somebody.

06:03.146 --> 06:07.208
Now you go further with it, then you see
that, such and such person –

06:07.409 --> 06:11.056
now I’m not talking about things, but
about persons -

06:11.257 --> 06:18.869
such and such person has done this harm to me
- something positive (may mean "negative").

06:19.070 --> 06:25.218
So you start feeling that you should hate
that person.

06:25.923 --> 06:29.569
Now you start hating that person.
With that hatred

06:29.770 --> 06:34.184
you develop new faculties [of] how to harm
that person.

06:34.385 --> 06:38.631
Then you start thinking how to destroy
that person,

06:38.832 --> 06:44.211
how to make his life miserable.

06:44.412 --> 06:50.142
Then you may beat that person, you may
shout at that person,

06:50.343 --> 06:54.420
you may try to kill that person. You can
do anything.

06:54.621 --> 06:59.994
So now the awareness is going towards
another direction, which is darkness,

07:00.195 --> 07:05.830
which is not light, because in the light
you won’t do such a thing.

07:06.031 --> 07:11.908
In the light you see everybody, everybody
is sitting, you know how far you are,

07:12.109 --> 07:17.150
where you are sitting. If you want to go
out, you know how to walk out.

07:17.351 --> 07:22.161
But when, in the darkness you are there,
you just don’t understand

07:22.362 --> 07:30.101
and you go on behaving in a manner
which is, which cannot be explained

07:30.302 --> 07:34.504
otherwise, except that, because you are
a human being.

07:34.705 --> 07:39.752
Animals don’t do like that. Animals have
limitation [on them].

07:39.953 --> 07:46.743
The animals, if they find something wrong,
something absolutely

07:46.950 --> 07:51.885
harmful done to them, then they will attack
or run away,

07:52.086 --> 07:57.107
but they do not carry a kind of a hatred
or anything.

07:57.308 --> 08:01.830
But they can carry the impression of fear,
could be,

08:02.031 --> 08:08.102
of some sort of a harm done to them.
But human beings are not like that.

08:08.303 --> 08:17.651
Human beings don’t have any particular
reason, as such, to hate someone.

08:17.852 --> 08:24.587
But why it works out? Because they are
involved in their ego.

08:24.788 --> 08:34.131
Egoistical person feels that he has a right
to do what he wants to do:

08:34.364 --> 08:41.169
he can kill anybody, he can bomb anyone,
he can do whatever he likes.

08:42.058 --> 08:47.570
But a person who is not doing that,
is the other way round:

08:47.771 --> 08:52.612
he is frightened, he is afraid of someone.

08:52.813 --> 08:57.607
Now the awareness moves on. This is
a subtler awareness,

08:57.808 --> 09:04.653
because, if you are afraid of somebody,
you would not like to go to his house,

09:04.854 --> 09:10.332
you will avoid him in the street,
all things you can do.

09:10.533 --> 09:15.034
So all this kind of knowledge about other
human beings also

09:15.235 --> 09:18.711
accumulates in your mind.

09:18.912 --> 09:28.062
Then this thing starts working on
a collective level,

09:28.263 --> 09:32.724
because you think, “This group is very bad.
They are good.

09:32.925 --> 09:37.748
These are bad. They are excellent!”
like that, it works out.

09:37.949 --> 09:44.684
In your own mind you think that somebody
has a group,

09:44.885 --> 09:49.241
and the other group is better or that group
is better.

09:49.442 --> 09:59.302
And collectively, then, you start working
out your whole temperament, your awareness.

09:59.503 --> 10:03.546
Like once people decide that say,
for example,

10:03.747 --> 10:11.565
that black people are to be finished,
so all the white people can join together.

10:11.766 --> 10:19.750
Or like at the time of Hitler, he decided
that all other human beings but Germans

10:19.951 --> 10:25.152
were useless. So he gathered people around
his thought and ideas.

10:25.353 --> 10:30.273
And this collective awareness just
comes to,

10:30.474 --> 10:34.492
I don’t know how, but it enters into
the minds of many.

10:34.693 --> 10:40.142
They never challenge it, they never ask
[about] it, whether it is correct or not.

10:40.343 --> 10:46.968
So this grows more and more and more,
and then it becomes like a –

10:47.565 --> 10:53.641
country-wise, you can say – an awareness
of this kind of a feeling.

10:53.842 --> 11:03.384
But whether it is correct or not is not
understood, is not known.

11:03.585 --> 11:09.028
So, what is important [is] that you should
know Reality,

11:09.229 --> 11:13.849
you should know exactly what is right
and what is wrong.

11:14.050 --> 11:23.986
For that, as I told you, there is this
great power of Kundalini within you.

11:24.541 --> 11:27.675
She is the one, She passes through
all these centres,

11:27.876 --> 11:34.121
enlightens them first of all, so your
awareness gets enlightened.

11:34.322 --> 11:39.766
And when She pierces through Sahastrara,
She joins you

11:39.967 --> 11:48.242
to this All-pervading Power which is
Knowledge,

11:49.535 --> 11:56.367
which is love, which is Truth.

11:57.813 --> 12:02.175
So, after that, you immediately know –

12:02.832 --> 12:06.997
some people don’t know immediately,
but some people do –

12:07.198 --> 12:15.997
that what we have been thinking so far,
of separating ourselves from others

12:16.198 --> 12:20.150
by thinking they are not all right, they are
wrong, they are whatever it is –

12:20.351 --> 12:24.428
this disappears. This disappears
completely,

12:24.629 --> 12:28.381
and then you realise that your awareness
itself,

12:28.587 --> 12:34.018
awareness itself is dominated by so many
other circumstances.

12:34.219 --> 12:38.225
For example, where you were born, what
your parents taught you,

12:38.426 --> 12:41.322
what experiences you have had.

12:41.523 --> 12:46.551
And then you realise that it was all wrong,
because it’s not Reality.

12:46.752 --> 12:52.047
Whatever feelings you have, whatever
ideas you have

12:52.248 --> 12:59.507
about another person or about other nation,
all of them are not correct.

12:59.708 --> 13:07.565
Because now your Sahastrara is awakened,
that it is connected now

13:07.766 --> 13:14.251
to the All-pervading Power. So this
starts flowing into you.

13:14.452 --> 13:23.502
This - I should say - enlightened awareness,
it starts flowing down into your being,

13:23.703 --> 13:31.742
in your brain, and then on your nerves
you can feel that awareness.

13:31.943 --> 13:38.120
Now once you want to know about something,
whether it is right or wrong –

13:38.321 --> 13:41.938
absolute right and wrong, it’s not [a]
question of relative –

13:42.139 --> 13:46.992
you just have to put your hands towards
that person,

13:47.193 --> 13:50.182
or towards that thing or whatever it is:

13:50.383 --> 13:54.962
immediately on these vibrations you
will know.

13:55.163 --> 13:59.890
So what are these vibrations, is this
Paramachaitanya,

14:00.091 --> 14:06.977
we call it ‘Brahmachaitanya’, which starts
flowing through your finger tips.

14:07.183 --> 14:12.117
Now you start feeling what chakras
they are catching,

14:12.318 --> 14:19.581
whether they are right or wrong, and your
discretion improves immensely.

14:19.782 --> 14:23.504
The brain, which was putting you
in delusions

14:23.705 --> 14:28.367
and wrong type of life, immediately
corrects itself.

14:28.568 --> 14:34.055
For example, I’m walking in a place
with my eyes closed,

14:34.256 --> 14:40.940
and there is a big ditch. I can’t see it,
I’m just walking.

14:41.141 --> 14:44.384
And suddenly I open my eyes and see
the ditch:

14:44.585 --> 14:48.510
immediately I know it’s wrong and I give up
and come away.

14:48.711 --> 14:54.541
In the same way it happens to you when
your Sahastrara is enlightened.

14:54.742 --> 15:00.598
Whatever you had gathered, knowledge,
whatever you think was right,

15:00.799 --> 15:06.248
whatever was your dream and your aims
of life, all these aspirations,

15:06.449 --> 15:08.978
they melt away.

15:09.179 --> 15:16.110
And then you take to reality and you start
seeing the reality of everything.

15:16.311 --> 15:24.708
Unless and until you see that reality, you
will be going with [the] other crowd:

15:24.909 --> 15:27.238
“These people are saying so, so let’s
do that.”

15:27.439 --> 15:32.733
“They are saying so, so let’s do that”.
But you cannot see whether it is correct

15:32.934 --> 15:39.040
or not, it’s good for you or not, or
whether it is going to help you.

15:39.241 --> 15:45.234
This kind of thing is so common
in the whole world

15:45.435 --> 15:52.131
and that’s why there is so much problem.
Because they don’t know the reality.

15:52.332 --> 15:56.936
Once you know the reality, most of
the problems can be finished,

15:57.137 --> 16:00.935
because this brain itself is creating
problems.

16:01.136 --> 16:07.129
First of all, it commits all kinds
of atrocities, violence, everything;

16:07.330 --> 16:13.265
then it also justifies itself, and then
it does even worse things.

16:13.466 --> 16:20.754
All this, they used to call it as ‘sin’, but
now in Sahaja Yoga, that’s finished now.

16:20.976 --> 16:25.777
Whatever your brain was contaminated with
is now cleansed.

16:25.978 --> 16:30.571
It has got the knowledge and through
the knowledge you can make out

16:30.772 --> 16:35.839
what is right and what is wrong.
Up to this point is all right.

16:36.040 --> 16:44.770
But then you must have full understanding
that, whatever [is] right, is right,

16:44.971 --> 16:51.031
and whatever [is] wrong is wrong, and we
should not do anything that is wrong,

16:51.232 --> 16:57.032
always do the right. You have to decide
on that point.

16:57.233 --> 17:02.358
”Now we have to do the right only,
never the wrong”.

17:02.559 --> 17:07.749
This, when it comes to your mind, then
what starts is your determination:

17:07.950 --> 17:13.529
what we call as devotion, dedication,
surrendering.

17:15.772 --> 17:23.847
With that, you give up all your false ideas
and all your false pride,

17:24.048 --> 17:26.930
all other things that you have been doing
so far,

17:27.131 --> 17:33.319
and immediately you become a different
person, a beautiful person.

17:36.543 --> 17:41.982
Now the third thing that happens to you,
which never happened to you before,

17:42.183 --> 17:49.404
[is] that you feel that: “Unless and until
I give the same state to other people

17:49.605 --> 17:55.893
it won’t be all right, it won’t be -
all right for me to talk to them”.

17:56.094 --> 17:59.431
So you start talking to your brothers,
sisters.

17:59.632 --> 18:04.301
Then you start talking to other people,
then you start talking to...

18:04.502 --> 18:08.095
[the] whole nation you can talk about
Sahaja Yoga,

18:08.296 --> 18:15.620
that, “I have gained so much, I have got
these things; so now, why not you take it?”

18:15.821 --> 18:19.340
But to expect that by talking,
by discussion,

18:19.541 --> 18:24.054
by arguments, by sermoning…
they will never take.

18:24.255 --> 18:31.962
Because their brain, as I told you, is just
the same - still full of ignorance.

18:32.163 --> 18:35.814
So what you have to do is to raise
their Kundalini.

18:36.015 --> 18:40.919
Once you raise their Kundalini and their
brain opens,

18:41.120 --> 18:47.113
then they are on the same line as yourself.
They don’t have to worry

18:47.314 --> 18:55.504
about what is good and what is bad,
they know [it] themselves.

18:58.323 --> 19:05.099
Now that is what is very important.
To correct this world is very important:

19:05.300 --> 19:09.631
that you all should know what is right
and what is wrong.

19:09.832 --> 19:17.171
And you have a vehicle of Paramachaitanya
to know what is wrong and what is right.

19:17.372 --> 19:22.195
Now this strength starts moving and,
as you see, there are

19:22.396 --> 19:26.970
so many people, today, with their open
Sahastrara.

19:27.171 --> 19:33.638
So opening Sahastrara was the most
important part of the evolutionary process.

19:33.839 --> 19:39.111
All the evolution process brought human
beings to what level?

19:39.312 --> 19:47.278
We had wars, we had all kinds of silly
programmes

19:47.479 --> 19:54.009
by which we really ruined so many
countries, so many people.

19:54.752 --> 20:02.732
Now when you are one with that
All-pervading Power: It’s a pure power.

20:02.933 --> 20:08.778
It’s a nirmal power. Absolutely pure
power.

20:08.979 --> 20:14.765
That gives you complete sense and complete
understanding

20:14.966 --> 20:22.945
as to how you should move, how you should
live, and what you should have.

20:23.282 --> 20:27.862
This is what is Self-realisation, they say.

20:28.063 --> 20:34.043
But I would say that Self-realisation is
much further than that.

20:34.244 --> 20:41.372
Even if your brain is enriched by
the Knowledge, the Real Knowledge,

20:41.573 --> 20:45.781
still there are other things which you
should have.

20:45.982 --> 20:51.957
And the most important thing is that
you have to be

20:52.158 --> 20:57.639
completely aware – again I say word
‘aware’ –

20:57.840 --> 21:07.309
of where you stand in this big plan
of world global transformation.

21:07.510 --> 21:12.030
What is your position? What are you
supposed to do

21:12.231 --> 21:18.853
for this global transformation? What is
your position?

21:19.067 --> 21:25.747
Where do you stand? What is the work
for you to be done?

21:25.948 --> 21:33.828
Now you’ve got this compulsion on you,
that, “I have to do something.”

21:34.029 --> 21:40.021
When this compulsion starts working
on you, which is not dreadful,

21:40.222 --> 21:47.712
which is not annoying, but very peaceful
and joyful,

21:47.913 --> 21:53.850
which says that, “I have to see that others
also know themselves!”

21:54.051 --> 22:00.122
So to know themselves is, first of all
you must know your own chakras.

22:00.797 --> 22:06.150
Yes, many people get their Realisation,
I know, very quickly.

22:06.351 --> 22:10.511
But they do not settle down with
their chakras.

22:10.712 --> 22:15.191
They have to see to their chakras: why you
have problems on your chakras.

22:15.392 --> 22:19.064
They will know they have problems,
but they still go on

22:19.265 --> 22:23.937
without paying attention or without looking
at it.

22:24.138 --> 22:28.472
To them it is a kind of a

22:31.239 --> 22:37.103
by the way [style], you can say: that,
“These problems are with me doesn’t matter.

22:37.304 --> 22:44.382
But what does it matter as long as I am
working out Sahaja Yoga?”

22:44.568 --> 22:49.021
It is not only for others, but for yourself
also!

22:49.222 --> 22:54.255
Is important that you should get your
chakras corrected.

22:54.456 --> 22:59.619
That’s the most important thing for you,
and then you will have Self-knowledge,

22:59.820 --> 23:03.746
in the sense [that] you will know what is
the defect, where is the defect,

23:03.947 --> 23:10.143
”What am I doing wrong? What should I do?”
And then when you correct it,

23:10.344 --> 23:14.537
when you correct those centres, then
your awareness,

23:14.738 --> 23:19.462
I would say, will be really, fully
enlightened about all the world.

23:19.663 --> 23:23.020
Now, it’s a tremendous thing – it’s very
tremendous.

23:23.221 --> 23:28.693
Because if you have to transform this mad
world into something very sane,

23:28.894 --> 23:33.224
and if we have to give them all
Self-realisation,

23:33.425 --> 23:39.330
imagine the task, how great it is, how many
people we need to do it.

23:39.507 --> 23:47.115
But if your willpower is strong about it
and you see – you feel compelled to do it.

23:47.316 --> 23:52.247
But normally, you see, we are compelled
because we have to run our houses,

23:52.448 --> 23:56.900
we have to earn money, we have to do this,
we have to do that.

23:57.101 --> 24:04.344
That you can do. But main object of your
life is to transform people

24:04.553 --> 24:12.369
and to work it out, this transformation –
for the global peace.

24:12.570 --> 24:16.506
I don’t know [if] it has been predicted
or not,

24:16.707 --> 24:19.806
that a complete transformation will take
place,

24:20.007 --> 24:24.606
but they have talked about transformation.
I don’t know that part,

24:24.807 --> 24:31.128
and I just don’t bother my head as to how
many people are getting transformed.

24:31.329 --> 24:36.523
But after transformation you must settle
down.

24:36.724 --> 24:41.675
First of all you should see if you are
a peaceful person,

24:41.835 --> 24:46.496
if there’s peace in your heart.
If you have no peace in your heart

24:46.697 --> 24:51.510
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.
If you get excited

24:51.711 --> 24:58.218
and if you start shouting at people and all
that, it means you are not Sahaja Yogis.

24:58.419 --> 25:04.972
You have to have a very, very peaceful
temperament, that is very important.

25:05.173 --> 25:10.984
Now with that peace what should be there,
[is] pure compassion.

25:12.912 --> 25:18.684
What you are doing is not for your benefit
or as such,

25:18.885 --> 25:28.260
but because you are compelled by this Force
to do good for others, to transform them.

25:28.461 --> 25:33.891
This is the greatest good you can do
to others, that their brains are put right,

25:34.092 --> 25:38.770
they get rid of their diseases, they get
rid of their problems. It’s all there.

25:38.971 --> 25:43.773
But, the first thing and the most important
thing that happens

25:43.974 --> 25:47.430
[is] that they get the power to transform
others.

25:47.631 --> 25:53.806
When you have that power to transform
others you should not waste it,

25:54.007 --> 25:58.704
you should not use it for yourself. That
means the growth is not complete.

25:58.905 --> 26:05.523
You must talk about it, you must tell
about it, and you must work it out.

26:05.724 --> 26:09.297
Wherever it is possible you have to work
it out.

26:09.498 --> 26:14.948
This is the way we can spread people
on a global level,

26:15.149 --> 26:18.472
who can get complete transformation.

26:18.673 --> 26:24.180
All our problems, whether in India
or anywhere,

26:24.381 --> 26:33.287
is because of human beings, because they
have been not enlightened.

26:33.488 --> 26:39.084
See, if you are enlightened you’ll have
no problem of any quarrelling

26:39.285 --> 26:42.732
or any fighting and all that.

26:42.933 --> 26:49.658
If you are enlightened, then you will think
about others,

26:49.859 --> 26:55.071
others as if they are your own, bother
your heads about them.

26:55.272 --> 26:59.808
You will not think about yourself anymore.

27:00.009 --> 27:06.132
If you are enlightened then [there's]
no question of any violence in your head.

27:06.333 --> 27:10.023
Nowadays in the name of religion,
in the name of everything,

27:10.224 --> 27:12.572
there is so much of violence.

27:12.795 --> 27:17.962
This violence can be easily corrected
if they all become Sahaja Yogis.

27:18.163 --> 27:23.422
Think, if all people become Sahaja Yogis,
how will they quarrel, for what?

27:23.623 --> 27:27.485
So this religion is there, but above
all these religions

27:27.686 --> 27:32.391
is the religion of Sahaja Yoga, where
you become one.

27:32.592 --> 27:37.287
And there all these quarrels of religions
will disappear.

27:37.876 --> 27:40.873
This is not the only problem we have
as human beings,

27:41.074 --> 27:44.480
we have some other problems also,
very serious.

27:44.681 --> 27:52.405
That is, we have a hankering.

27:53.136 --> 27:58.892
We are very greedy. We cannot adjust
yourself to any other circumstances.

27:59.093 --> 28:03.061
We want to live in complete comfort and
this and that.

28:03.254 --> 28:08.742
But after this you can sleep anywhere, you
can eat anywhere, you need not eat.

28:08.921 --> 28:18.941
You become a person who is above all these
needs, all these demands, absolutely.

28:32.997 --> 28:38.573
Then you don’t worry, you don’t worry.
There’s worry for what?

28:38.774 --> 28:43.066
Supposing I get lost somewhere and the car
is going in a wrong way:

28:43.267 --> 28:47.630
all right, I have to go that way,
that’s why I’m going like that.

28:47.831 --> 28:50.582
What is there to feel upset about it?

28:50.783 --> 28:57.767
So many things, small, big, happen in your
life for which you get upset.

28:57.968 --> 29:02.427
But now, with this blessing of Sahastrara,

29:02.628 --> 29:08.661
you’ll be amazed, there is help
from Paramchaitanya.

29:08.883 --> 29:17.765
And that means a tremendous help, because
it acts globally, it acts individually,

29:17.966 --> 29:24.873
it acts on communities, it acts on nations,

29:25.074 --> 29:34.122
because there is a Divine – what we call
‘Divine’ – where is a Divine play going on.

29:34.323 --> 29:39.704
And this Divine play plays tremendous
beautiful things,

29:39.905 --> 29:44.188
by which people start correcting
themselves.

29:44.389 --> 29:47.737
So, you should never be nervous, you should
never be upset,

29:47.938 --> 29:53.032
because you have the Divine Power
within you, and it will correct.

29:53.233 --> 29:59.061
It can correct anyone. I mean, recently
we had a case of one boy

29:59.262 --> 30:04.834
who was hit by a truck and they said
his lungs were smashed.

30:05.035 --> 30:09.612
Now, with the lungs smashed, nobody has
heard that they become normal.

30:09.818 --> 30:13.395
Not only they became normal, but he started
breathing normally.

30:13.596 --> 30:19.667
And now he is all right. Is only this work
is done by Paramchaitanya.

30:19.868 --> 30:24.157
You don’t have to do anything. Any problem
comes before you,

30:24.358 --> 30:30.943
before it really touches you, is solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

30:31.705 --> 30:38.724
But you must have full faith in yourself
and in Paramachaitanya

30:38.925 --> 30:44.326
and believe that you are a realised-soul.
Nobody can harm you.

30:44.527 --> 30:48.961
If they try to harm you, for the time
being, all right, you may suffer,

30:49.162 --> 30:54.156
but you don’t also feel the sufferings
and you get out of it.

30:54.357 --> 31:00.758
Such a security, such a proper guidance
is there.

31:00.959 --> 31:04.987
Also you are saved from all kinds
of attacks

31:05.188 --> 31:09.633
and all kinds of mistakes that you commit.

31:09.834 --> 31:17.124
It’s all such a big – I would say,
a Computer of Knowledge.

31:17.325 --> 31:24.180
He knows, It knows what you are doing
and what you should not do,

31:24.381 --> 31:30.115
where you are going and what should
not be your way.

31:30.316 --> 31:36.606
He knows, It knows everything, knows
everything about you.

31:36.807 --> 31:42.151
So then you have to become aware of It.

31:42.352 --> 31:46.796
Now this is the stage where I would say
that you have to be aware

31:46.997 --> 31:54.586
that you are realised-souls, you are
different,

31:54.787 --> 32:00.265
very unique. You are realised-souls,
you are not ordinary people.

32:00.466 --> 32:10.243
And that you are protected by this
Paramchaitanya. Nothing can change you,

32:10.444 --> 32:17.793
nothing can trouble you, nothing can
overpower you.

32:17.994 --> 32:23.056
Because you are not aware, also, of this
Paramachaitanya,

32:23.257 --> 32:27.041
that’s why you, a little bit, get worried.
And people write to me,

32:27.242 --> 32:31.285
“Mother, my - something wrong with
my daughter, something this thing."

32:31.486 --> 32:37.165
Everything can be corrected
by Paramchaitanya,

32:37.366 --> 32:41.415
if you know how to leave it to That,

32:42.232 --> 32:47.368
if you understand how you are one
with that Paramchaitanya,

32:47.569 --> 32:55.825
you are a part and parcel of that. And that
Paramchaitanya is looking after you.

32:56.026 --> 33:00.743
You don’t have [a] very conscious effort,

33:00.944 --> 33:06.762
there’s no need to have very conscious
effort. Accept life as it is.

33:06.963 --> 33:11.167
As it is, whatever life is there, accept.
Don’t retaliate,

33:11.368 --> 33:14.951
don’t get angry, don’t get upset.
Just accept.

33:15.152 --> 33:20.008
And you’ll enjoy the same life which
was irritating you!

33:20.209 --> 33:26.221
You will see the enjoying part of that,
and it will be so beautiful

33:26.422 --> 33:30.778
the way you will see that you’ll get over
all your problems,

33:30.979 --> 33:33.511
you’ll get over all your enemies.

33:33.712 --> 33:41.091
And a kind of a very fresh, beautiful
existence you’ll have.

33:41.292 --> 33:48.413
So now, as you are all Sahaja Yogis,
is a very great position.

33:48.614 --> 33:56.053
With that, if you humble down, humble down,
then you’ll be amazed to see

33:56.254 --> 34:03.362
that, you are absolutely in contact with
this Paramchaitanya;

34:03.563 --> 34:08.189
not only that, but you have become
Paramchaitanya.

34:11.154 --> 34:15.687
With this Paramchaitanya you can do
anything.

34:15.888 --> 34:22.203
I need not tell you what you can do,
because some of you may not believe.

34:22.404 --> 34:28.286
But that’s [what] my own experience is,
that, if you are the Paramchaitanya,

34:28.487 --> 34:33.771
if you know you are the Paramchaitanya,
then it keeps your dignity,

34:33.972 --> 34:40.182
it keeps your position, it keeps your world
and looks after you.

34:40.383 --> 34:45.524
And whatever is just said or desired,
you just get it.

34:45.725 --> 34:51.637
Your desires also change. Your desires
are not for stupid things,

34:51.838 --> 34:56.447
but for something that is very noble.

34:57.503 --> 35:03.456
Like, you want to transform people, you
want to do Sahaja Yoga work.

35:03.663 --> 35:07.701
All these desires are fulfilled fully,

35:07.902 --> 35:13.995
when you want to do it, you like it and
you think of it.

35:14.196 --> 35:18.131
It is something, even seeing something:

35:18.332 --> 35:22.799
if you see something and you are stunned
by that!

35:23.000 --> 35:31.835
Immediately Paramchaitanya will take over
and you will have no problems, no problems.

35:32.036 --> 35:40.281
Because the way we react to all these
difficulties and to so-called odds in life

35:40.482 --> 35:43.705
becomes a play, just a play.
You are amazed!

35:43.906 --> 35:48.082
You looked at it and finished!
Look at that, and finished!

35:48.283 --> 35:56.031
That is how it is the light, which goes into
the darkness and finishes the darkness.

35:56.232 --> 36:00.902
The darkness is finished, and our problems
are finished also.

36:01.103 --> 36:04.655
So this is what is our awareness has
to become.

36:04.856 --> 36:08.486
Awareness has to become Paramachaitanya.

36:08.687 --> 36:13.867
Then you get all the ideas, everything
that are Divine.

36:14.068 --> 36:21.560
But not only that, but also the help of
the Divine, all the solutions of the Divine.

36:21.761 --> 36:26.691
It’s something amazing! And everything
quietens down,

36:26.892 --> 36:33.200
everything settles down, and you are
amazed, watching all this,

36:33.401 --> 36:39.229
that you are the centre of doing
all these things.

36:39.430 --> 36:43.082
You are not aware that you are doing,
and you are this.

36:43.283 --> 36:47.754
That ego part is missing. But you
see it’s all happening around you,

36:47.955 --> 36:52.607
and then you are amazed how it is
happening.

36:52.808 --> 36:58.427
The whole lifestyle changes, the whole
understanding changes,

36:58.628 --> 37:05.111
and you become a great source of happiness,
joy and knowledge to others.

37:05.312 --> 37:11.577
You don’t have to study anything, you don’t
have to know much,

37:11.745 --> 37:17.906
but you will know about everything,
what is right and what is wrong.

37:19.057 --> 37:24.804
And then only you can tell the things
with complete authority

37:25.005 --> 37:30.338
that, “This is not right!” Like today,
we had a discussion on this point

37:30.539 --> 37:35.333
about the economic position and
the economics of modern times.

37:35.534 --> 37:43.160
I said, “Is all wrong, because it is
self-destructive.”

37:43.361 --> 37:49.835
It destroys the nations, if not your
nation, other nations.

37:50.036 --> 37:59.140
Then it also destroys your family life.
It destroys your value system.

37:59.341 --> 38:06.587
It completely destroys you. So what sort
of an economics is this?

38:06.788 --> 38:17.721
It’s just a show, just a, like a, you can
say, a balloon: it can burst any moment.

38:17.922 --> 38:21.262
I have seen people who are very rich,
very this thing,

38:21.463 --> 38:26.866
think no end of themselves [then] become
bankrupt. And very bankrupt become rich.

38:27.067 --> 38:33.806
So it’s [a] kind of a turmoil in which
they are jumping,

38:34.007 --> 38:40.090
from one shore to another shore. But
you are not. You watch that drama.

38:40.291 --> 38:46.722
You see all that drama, and with your peace
you can see everything, very calmly.

38:46.923 --> 38:51.123
Not, it’s not difficult for you to create
more people like this.

38:51.324 --> 38:57.863
It’s not difficult to transform this world.
The time has come, just ripe time.

38:58.064 --> 39:02.313
Like when the proper time comes,
the blossom time comes,

39:02.514 --> 39:07.926
so many flowers become fruits. So,
like that, you all have become.

39:08.127 --> 39:13.362
Now it is for you to create seeds to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

39:13.563 --> 39:18.703
You are at that level of awareness now
where Paramchaitanya is with you,

39:18.904 --> 39:24.866
absolutely part and parcel of you,
absolutely with you to give you

39:25.067 --> 39:34.027
all necessary help, all necessary prestige,
and also the personality.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.546
May God bless you all.
