00:00:37.030 --> 00:01:35.850
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.030
They had planned everything.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.969
They had all the arrangements made
and the sari was missing.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.390
All right.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.500
So they came and told Me that the sari's missing,
so now what to do?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.119
You can't have puja without the sari, according
to them.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.170
So I said, "All right, let's wait.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.980
If it arrives in time we'll have it;
otherwise we can have it later.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:12.790
But I was least disturbed,
least upset.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.030
Because I do not have a mental conception
of it.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.620
But if you have a mental conception,
"Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.620
everything.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.760
We have done this and now it's fizzling out."

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.180
Doesn't matter.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.040
Nothing is fizzling out.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.489
But that is what we cannot do.

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.070
Because you asked Me today, "What is Mahamaya?"

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.569
This is what it is.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.849
You must learn to accept whatever comes your
way.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.790
That's one of the things.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.920
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.600
because we make a mental projection.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.220
Mentally we calculate something.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.480
This has to be.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.970
And it's really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.530
Because I thought, "That's what is destined.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.530
All right.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.530
We'll have it tomorrow.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.330
What does it matter?"

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.239
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I'll
be back

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.239
only about two o'clock.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.150
He said, "Why not in the morning?"

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.599
"I don't think it will be feasible."

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.099
So this is how you become avyagra.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.830
Vyagra means person who is worried.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.659
The one who is not worried.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:55.100
So we worry because of two things.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:04.150
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in
the future?

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.510
Future doesn't exist.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.870
If you have made up your mind
that this should happen in the future,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.770
then you get upset.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.410
That's one thing.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.350
But you have not made any mental picture,
you will see what comes on the scene.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.210
You'll watch whatever appears.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.740
Then you're not worried, because you're anxious
to see

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.630
what's going to happen.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.830
That's one way, that you feel hurt, that you're
worried.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.930
Secondly you worry when you have built up
a myth,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.120
picture of that "Oh, we're going to have a
puja now,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.380
and we are not having it."

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.950
So you are upset.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.880
What difference does it make?

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.280
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and
the puja tomorrow.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.160
Because today you think it was going to be
puja.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.560
We are all dressed up well.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.910
Very nice
We spend so much time to get ready for the

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.910
puja.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.180
All right, we'll have it tomorrow.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.620
What does it matter?

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.120
We really decorated ourselves well.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.020
We were all ready for the puja,
we were sitting here for the puja,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.080
and now what has happened!

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.060
I didn't wear My sari for puja at all.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:39.350
I knew what was coming.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.050
So, it's all right to see you like this.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.000
Because normally in the puja, I never see
you dressed like this,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.590
I'm busy with Myself.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.919
Now I can see you nicely dressed.

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.110
I feel very happy about it.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.320
And these mental things are responsible for
frustrating us.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.570
Like as I was telling you about money.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.120
Same thing happens.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.259
In India people come.

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.090
They keep so much money for buying things.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.259
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like
what you call traders.

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.850
The customs are so kind, I mean
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.479
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:28.360
And then they have a mental picture,
"We'll buy this."

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.360
All right?

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360
"And see so much we'll spend."

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.290
And if they have to spend some money for something
else,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.230
they get upset because they have decided to
spend so much.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.389
So then they might go to spend some money.

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.139
That's also, you see how Mahamaya works, you
see?

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:51.120
It has happened with all of you.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.340
So they go and buy something.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.620
I'll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:06.530
I don't know he paid about, I think 500 rupees
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.710
don't know.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.889
How many pounds you paid for that?

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:10.889
Gavin: Forty pounds.

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:11.889
Forty pounds.

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:12.889
He paid forty pounds for that thing.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.160
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.880
And I said, "What's this?

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880
How did you buy?"

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.150
"Oh, it's a very nice thing, Mother.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.500
We got it in Agra."

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.039
I said, "It is from Nepal.

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.560
If you buy it in Agra,
I think it is very expensive and it's such

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.979
a waste."

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:32.319
But the worst was the vibrations were very
bad.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:33.729
They thought they've bought something great.

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:36.129
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed
it.

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:37.580
So he said, "All right, Mother.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.509
I'll keep it in Your house
and You improve the vibrations."

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:41.509
I tried.

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:43.190
It would not work out.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.060
I said, "Gavin, what to do now?

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.539
You sink it in the Thames.

00:07:46.539 --> 00:07:51.389
I don't know what."

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:57.560
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,
"I have to take some present of Buddha to

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.560
Japan."

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.560
I said, "These Japanese exhibitors are good
for nothing.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.229
No bhoot is going to trouble them."

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:06.630
So he said, "Can I buy something?"

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.500
I said, "Buddha's things means it's not easy
to get here."

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.500
"But I have avlokhiteshwara.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.500
Would you like to take that?"

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.210
He said, "What is the price?"

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.669
I said, "Forty pounds."

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:18.129
He said, "All right.

00:08:18.129 --> 00:08:19.129
All right.

00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:20.389
I'll take it.

00:08:20.389 --> 00:08:22.639
And he bought it for forty pounds.

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.599
I said, "All right.

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:27.199
Give it to the Japanese fellow."

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.520
He was a very nasty person.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.419
I said, "Good for him."

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:38.919
And I found it out that,
you see because I knew that it will have some

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:41.039
purpose somewhere.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:49.530
So this is how our mental images are so rigid
that there's no flexibility in our understanding.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:56.040
And if you start making it flexible then
and this is very early stages when Gavin had

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.010
gone to India,
very early.

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.560
Now he's different.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:06.510
So if you become flexible,
then what happens you see the joy of it.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.640
You see how things get adjusted.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.600
But if it is rigid,
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.530
And you can never enjoy it,
because there's no movement for the Mahamaya

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.420
power.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.140
And that's how then you feel frustrated.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.640
You see it is all your own creation.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:37.350
The mental projection is your creation,
and also the destruction is your creation.

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:38.820
Nobody is responsible for that.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.770
You are responsible.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:48.850
But who does that is Mahamaya,
"Sankalpa vikalpa karo", you do decide something.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:53.750
You say, "Now today I will go to Birmingham.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.850
I have to go to Birmingham.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.150
I can't come for a meditation.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.600
I have to."

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.720
After some time you will find
that it's impossible to do something,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.330
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:14.150
Because whenever you will try to do something,
you will find it will frustrate you, it will

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.150
upset you.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:24.750
If not, then it will make you realize
what is important, what you've missed.

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.780
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:29.790
You think that, "Oh God.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.790
We have lost the way.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:32.790
What to do?

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:38.300
Now where to go?"

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.050
If I was you, I would say, "All right.

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:42.070
We've lost the way.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.730
Must be to find something else."

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.261
And there I find something else which I've
been looking for,

00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:47.261
for days together.

00:10:47.261 --> 00:10:49.360
I just see that there.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:11:04.680
So if 
you trust your joy giving quality of your

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:09.210
Spirit,
that you're not going to lose that quality

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:13.470
of the Spirit,
at any cost.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:24.270
Then that acts as a guide
and you understand the flexibility

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.160
of all these worldly, transitory things.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:37.209
They are all changeable,
only you cannot change because you are the

00:11:37.209 --> 00:11:39.240
Spirit.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:44.590
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,
which is very important subject.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:52.920
I think I have talked about it many a times.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:12:04.870
But in the West I must say,
because of our wrong attitudes

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:18.670
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections
of other people who are very dominating,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:27.160
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:34.460
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:39.920
had,
and has sustained itself,

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:51.150
we must know that we can always fall a trap
to our different bifurcations which we had

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:57.280
created before.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:04.699
It's a very serious matter
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:10.910
shattered,
and we have created pathways

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:19.440
into which our attention can go
if we are not very careful.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:26.329
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:33.600
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.480
You see yourself and you get shocked how,
"Why did I say such a thing?

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.500
Why did I do such a thing?"

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:54.079
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,
sin against the Mother,

00:13:54.079 --> 00:14:07.500
it's a secretive action
that's only between you and yourself.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:13.120
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except
for you.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:25.819
Nobody knows what you are going to do
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

00:14:25.819 --> 00:14:29.799
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:33.300
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:40.510
To be very frank with you,
that's one center I find it difficult to feel

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:41.510
Myself.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:49.160
The reason is, I have a very, very strong
Mooladhara,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:57.949
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:58.980
It is not bothered.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.530
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go
near any other Mooladhara.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:09.679
It just recedes back,
that's the action it plays all the time.

00:15:09.679 --> 00:15:13.610
So I also, unless and until it is very badly
off,

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:18.490
I mean the person is very close to Me,
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.560
But still I can?

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:26.190
Supposing you give Me something, that thing
is used by you,

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.130
immediately I can feel it.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:35.970
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends
on you.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.929
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot
rise high,

00:15:38.929 --> 00:15:43.069
do what you like.

00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:51.820
Now for people who are Indian,
who have respected their Mooladharas,

00:15:51.820 --> 00:16:02.030
there are so many methods and ways given
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:10.390
But that won't work out with the Western people,
because it's a damaged one.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:16.410
It's one which is a shattered one,
and which does not work on the physical side

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:21.640
of the Mooladhara,
but on the emotional side as we call the "Mana",

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.799
the left side.

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:38.480
So, even you may not talk in that way,
but your mind is still in that realm.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.810
And you still think on that realm.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:49.169
Even mentally, you are in it.

00:16:49.169 --> 00:16:56.040
Or you are seeing things,
wanting to see such things,

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.240
wanting to enjoy such things.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:06.990
That lurking attraction is still there,
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:14.070
And we have to realize that I'm talking to
Western people.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:20.020
I would not say the same to the people from
India.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.310
So now we have to work out much harder.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:30.950
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:36.830
And it is more a mental activity.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:43.310
"Mental" meaning I mean the emotional side.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:44.730
You have to watch your mind.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.890
In English, it's a very funny word "mind"
is.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:53.960
But "Mana",
through which we cater to our emotional side,

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.270
to our desires.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.850
Where is it going?

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:06.110
Where is this movement of our mind?

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.770
What is it doing?

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:13.940
You have to stand against your mind,
stand against your desires,

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:20.600
or you can face it
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:26.860
It's for you to decide.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.910
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:33.600
I know you people have been confessing to
Me.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.040
I never read your letters, to be very frank.

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.890
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read
it.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:43.350
Whatever confessions you have made,
I burnt all those letters.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:46.150
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.670
Nor do I want to know about it.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.000
That's not My concern.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:05.950
My concern is that now
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:15.360
on the same level,
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:23.430
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat
the thoughts that come to you

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.860
from wrong type of Mooladhara.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.200
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your
Mooladhara.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:38.240
And we have some physical treatment for such
bhoots also,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:44.090
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,
which you can ask.

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.200
But you cannot always say that,
"It is a bhoot and I'm all right.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.480
I'm away from the bhoot."

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.230
You are not.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:53.230
Whenever you say, "I have a bhoot,"
means you yourself you're siding with the

00:19:53.230 --> 00:20:00.950
bhoot.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:06.900
You see a person as a Sakshi.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:17.180
That means you see that person
but you do not get a reaction,

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:26.030
which is killer of joy.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:34.680
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very
well.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:39.210
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.660
And be alert about it.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:52.060
If you want to be kind to yourself,
know that you have to divert your attention

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.890
towards a sane married life.

00:20:54.890 --> 00:21:00.120
But also that should not be too much.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:06.510
Because what I have learnt now,
that in the West people have devised methods

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:11.140
of transferring their attention
from one person to another.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:22.350
Mental acrobatics of different type
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:29.160
Don't play onto these.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:39.170
There are so many other things by which
we express that we are still under the trap

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.220
of a bad Mooladhara.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:46.750
The way you dress up, the way you walk,
the way you sit, the way you talk,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:59.870
the way you behave, to impress other people.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:04.770
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja
Yoga itself.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:15.920
The only impression that should really work
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.230
You can do it; it's not difficult.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.120
When the Kundalini can rise with all such
shattered

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.760
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara
completely.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:34.220
But your question is first of all
of strengthening the Mooladhara,

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:41.320
for which I think you all have to go into
a kind of tapasya.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.390
That's why I say sometimes
that the Western people should take to less

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:51.840
of meat,
especially the red meats and beefs,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:23:06.730
and horses, and dogs
and I don't know what else you eat.

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.200
Take more to vegetarian food.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.250
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand
that.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:20.130
Take more to things
which do not give you so much heat in the

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.530
body.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.980
Even fish is very [inaudible].

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:34.980
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,
but don't take to these horrible health foods

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.980
also.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.180
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.770
They're not meant for human beings, but for
animals I think.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:45.950
They churn your stomach completely, and it's
horrible.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.850
This Country Store thing I took once and I
said "had enough of it!"

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:58.400
Country Store - the whole country went into
My stomach.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:04.010
So for you people,
(You have to go?)

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:12.480
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must
know

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:22.490
that food does make a difference
in the powers of Mooladhara.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:30.690
So if you have to get it cured, first of all
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.000
over-excited.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.990
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,
any woman you look at ...

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.260
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.760
Horrible.

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:50.110
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.450
your Mooladhara.

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:53.470
There's no grace.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:59.100
But it's not so outside that I can say that,
"you must respect yourself."

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:08.980
It cannot work out with those words I know.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:16.970
You have to sit down,
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:24.930
I'll discuss with Gavin and I'll tell him
what things can be done about it,

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:30.220
because I can't tell you in the open like
this.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.400
But still this is all physical.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:41.890
Mentally you must be on the watch
to see where does this mind go - to dirty

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:42.890
things.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:47.230
Why does it always go to this sensation?

00:25:47.230 --> 00:26:02.400
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,
see the beautiful people, just see them.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.510
Another horrible thing in the West
is that the women must expose their body

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.960
to get men excited.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.170
Men do the same I think.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:19.510
They always try to excite each other
and live in a stupid excitement.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:24.570
You have to expose beautiful things, like
flowers,

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:26.380
beautiful ornaments.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.190
All right?

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:32.890
But you're not a thing!

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:39.780
It's your private property.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:47.980
You don't put all your gold on the streets,
do you?

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.690
Better try that, sometimes.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:57.470
You will mind people plundering your gold,
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:02.470
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:03.470
You don't feel insulted?

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.090
Because ego is a dirty stuff.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.750
It does not mind.

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:11.510
It feels happy that people are watching you.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:15.230
They are plundering you.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:19.920
They are looting your chastity.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:27.309
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

00:27:27.309 --> 00:27:32.490
But still I must say you must cleanse your
hearts,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:43.510
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:50.150
The minds are very funnily placed,
and that's why the greatest complications

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.500
there are
in the brains of people.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:02.160
They are very confused,
very confused people.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.750
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of
life.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.870
You become just a sex-oriented personality.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:13.660
It is actually just the other way round.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.450
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve
money.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.179
If you are possession-oriented you want to
preserve it.

00:28:20.179 --> 00:28:23.700
If you get one little antique piece you want
to preserve it.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:28.860
And why not this property of yours
which is the highest of all,

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:38.710
to be preserved, to be adorned,
to be worshipped?

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:46.440
I'm quite worried on that point
that secretly people are indulging into such

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.290
things.

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:52.620
And they're hypocritical sometimes,
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.990
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,
but in this matter they think they can go

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:59.480
about
the way they like.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.080
And sometimes some of them say that
"Mother has said it's all right."

00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.650
I never said so!

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.780
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:13.830
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,
towards your life, towards your being,

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.830
towards your personality.

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.830
You are saints.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:25.809
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,
I call it the character, the essence of character,

00:29:25.809 --> 00:29:32.720
is not a saint.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:35.429
So this purity has to be maintained.

00:29:35.429 --> 00:29:38.920
There cannot be any compromise on that.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:43.679
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:51.960
If it works out,
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:59.470
nobody deceives oneself
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.770
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going
to rise,

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:07.940
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.840
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy
things,

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:16.490
your mind can be cleansed.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:19.840
And whenever such a thought comes in, you
have to say,

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.700
"not this, not this, not this."

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:29.730
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:36.480
I know it's difficult,
but if you can get realization why not this

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.610
also?

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:43.080
You all have to understand
that there is no compromise on this.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:48.020
And a day may come, if you continue with it,
you will be thrown away completely,

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:54.730
just like any other devil is thrown out.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:56.440
So there is no compromise.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.900
Tell yourself,
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.701
You cannot ascend
if there is any lurking thing within you.

00:31:04.701 --> 00:31:09.059
You will be dragged down, because that's your
weakness,

00:31:09.059 --> 00:31:14.960
and you will become weaker, and weaker and
weaker.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:19.010
Only question is "where is your attention?"

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:21.450
Divert.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.920
Divert your attention.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:35.490
First you will need some exercise, some effort,
and afterwards it will come automatically.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:40.380
You won't have to exert, you won't have to
worry.

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:50.010
On the contrary,
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:51.760
So much conditioning is there.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:58.870
We have played into the hands of conditioning,
we have ruined ourselves.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:03.880
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,
and the worst of all.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:09.400
It's impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,
unless and until you individually

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.890
take up the responsibility of looking after
it.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:26.000
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,
and the most powerful chakra.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.350
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:41.950
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your
memory will fail.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:48.630
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin
with,

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.940
your wisdom will fail.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.960
You will have no sense of direction.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.420
The insanity that is now crawling up in America
before they become forty years of age

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.559
is because their Mooladharas are out.

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:13.760
Most of the diseases which are incurable
come because of weak Mooladharas,

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.210
on the physical side.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:20.610
On the mental side,
most of the mental problems we saw there,

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:27.710
most, I would say ninety percent,
are due to weak Mooladhara.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:33.720
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,
powerful Mooladhara,

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.720
it doesn't get into trouble.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:44.640
Because you know there's a very strong hold
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:54.280
And when your mind goes off,
you blame the brain.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:34:00.700
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.600
So for physical safety and for your emotional
safety also,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:14.480
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards
Mooladhara.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.070
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should
get married,

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.109
and after marriage, after a few days, you
find

00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:29.389
that your attention starts diverting to other
problems of married life.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:38.429
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,
because the sensationalization

00:34:38.429 --> 00:34:41.159
has become the main theme of modern life.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:52.980
And you are tossed about on the rough sea
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:35:05.500
Media, books, ideas, everything,
creates this horrible excitable temperament

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.280
within you.

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:17.580
Such a person doesn't have any patience,
doesn't have any balance.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:23.840
Actually he's hypocritical,
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:27.230
So many complications take place with this.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:32.210
Before realization, forget the past.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.980
Whatever you have done, forget it.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.619
Just don't worry.

00:35:36.619 --> 00:35:41.310
But remember one thing,
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:45.220
So you have to look after it, you have to
soothe it down,

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:50.020
you have to bring it to normalcy.

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:58.730
You have to make it a healthy,
balanced center,

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:08.150
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:17.240
Talking about Shri Ganesha,
you know vibrations become too much for Me.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:22.470
We talk of innocence,
but to awaken innocence within ourselves

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:30.150
we must be on the full watch,
on the full alertness about our minds.

00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:32.070
What is it thinking?

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.990
Where is it going?

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:36.570
Where is this thief going?

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:38.960
Is he trying to do some tricks?

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960
Is he up to some tricks?

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.960
All right!

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:48.010
You have to be alert, very alert.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:49.250
I've been thinking of talking about it since
long.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:54.740
But now I have to tell you one thing.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.460
That you'll be exposed.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.450
That is another quality of Mahamaya.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.550
She'll expose you.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:06.850
You'll be exposed
if you try to play tricks with Me.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:09.570
"With Me" means with your Kundalini.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:14.470
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,
you'll be exposed.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:18.190
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:31.100
So please be careful, very careful about it,
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.320
and powerful.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:40.750
May God bless you!

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:52.550
So our prayer should be that
"Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong."

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:56.720
That's all.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.880
Let's pray.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:08.990
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:15.610
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader
in England.

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:17.340
Then he will pass it on to you.

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.820
It should be done verbally.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.710
It should not be written down.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:29.680
The leaders of the ashrams and other places
should come and see him every month sometime,

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:37.030
and these things should be talked.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:41.880
Because it's a secret,
not to be discussed openly.

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.960
It's a secret, between you and yourself.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.620
It should not be written down anywhere.

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:55.200
It should not be mentioned,
but should be worked out by all of you,

00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:02.210
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of
Shri Ganesha.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:07.510
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than
for the men.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:14.030
Because men suffer much more than women do.

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:18.080
And that's why women must be very careful.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:26.130
Develop very good relationships with your
brothers.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:34.770
Unless and until you really establish your
high character,

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:39.460
men cannot be improved.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:43.330
You have seen in India women don't like it
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:44.330
to touch them.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:46.230
They don't like it.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.470
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves
up,

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:59.220
thousands of them, because they thought some
other people may come and touch their body.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:07.380
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:16.210
As if it is the body,
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:21.690
You all can be that, because you have become
yoginis now.

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:29.920
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing
the power of their chastity.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:38.510
It's more for ladies here,
that they should try to generate that feeling

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:44.810
of nobility, of chastity,
of holiness around them,

00:40:44.810 --> 00:45:47.580
so that the men themselves respect them
and develop that feeling within themselves.

00:45:47.580 --> 00:51:07.280
Thank you 

00:51:07.280 --> 02:35:29.550
very much.
