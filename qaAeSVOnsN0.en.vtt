WEBVTT

00:29.354 --> 00:42.684
Today, we are here to celebrate the birthday of Shri Jesus Christ.

00:43.632 --> 00:52.859
Jesus Christ's life was very short and He spent most of His time in India, in Kashmir.

00:59.279 --> 01:02.795
He went back just for last three years

01:03.208 --> 01:06.328
and people fixed Him to a cross.

01:14.008 --> 01:17.168
It was somewhat destined.

01:20.928 --> 01:23.008
To open Agnya chakra

01:23.208 --> 01:25.168
He had to offer this sacrifice.

01:26.768 --> 01:28.488
So in this way He

01:30.688 --> 01:32.608
set up Agnya chakra.

01:35.168 --> 01:36.568
Agnya chakra is very

01:39.408 --> 01:41.008
constricted

01:41.888 --> 01:42.968
small

01:45.688 --> 01:47.808
and not easily openable,

01:49.608 --> 01:51.168
because a human being

01:52.368 --> 01:54.008
got freedom

01:55.448 --> 01:57.528
that made him egoistic.

01:59.768 --> 02:01.288
This ego

02:01.848 --> 02:04.488
constricted his Agnya chakra.

02:08.608 --> 02:09.807
And from that

02:10.008 --> 02:12.861
constricted Agnya chakra

02:13.608 --> 02:15.790
it was necessary to take out ego.

02:17.568 --> 02:20.008
And to take out ego

02:21.448 --> 02:24.568
you have to control your (MAAN).

02:26.288 --> 02:28.968
But you do not take out your ego from your (MAAN).

02:30.648 --> 02:35.008
As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your (MAAN)

02:38.648 --> 02:40.768
the (MAAN) will go on increasing

02:40.968 --> 02:43.208
and the ego will go on increasing

02:44.448 --> 02:46.208
[ AHAAM  KAROTI  SAHA  AHAMKAR ]

02:47.288 --> 02:48.408
We do !

02:49.168 --> 02:53.448
It means that if we try to minimise our ego

02:55.648 --> 02:57.728
the ego will shoot up because

02:57.928 --> 03:00.568
we will try to do so with the help of ego only.

03:04.288 --> 03:05.968
Those who think

03:06.488 --> 03:08.008
that to our ego

03:09.968 --> 03:11.088
will suppress

03:12.368 --> 03:13.768
will eat less food

03:15.848 --> 03:17.248
worldwide violence

03:18.288 --> 03:19.048
one

03:19.408 --> 03:21.968
standing on one foot and some on their head.

03:24.968 --> 03:26.288
Every type of

03:26.608 --> 03:27.688
experiment

03:30.168 --> 03:33.208
people do to destroy their ego

03:35.448 --> 03:37.248
But it does not supress the ego.

03:37.848 --> 03:39.168
It shoots up.

03:40.088 --> 03:43.328
To fast, to do (JAP TAP)

03:44.928 --> 03:46.448
everything

03:47.408 --> 03:48.488
shoots up ego !

03:49.208 --> 03:50.768
[Havana] also gives rise to ego !

03:51.768 --> 03:54.848
Because Agni is right sided.

03:58.448 --> 04:00.048
Whatever

04:02.968 --> 04:07.768
karmakand we do, rituals  we perform gives rise to our ego.

04:16.328 --> 04:18.608
For the past thousands of years human beings

04:18.728 --> 04:21.248
have been doing the same type of karmakand.

04:22.728 --> 04:27.688
Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing.

04:32.408 --> 04:35.448
This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand.

04:37.448 --> 04:39.688
There is no need to do any karmakand.

04:45.048 --> 04:47.728
And to go to the extremes is all the more bad.

04:49.568 --> 04:50.648
As I said

04:51.288 --> 04:53.248
that to take away your ego

04:53.448 --> 04:57.368
you, in Marathi is called (JODE PATTI ) beat 'it' with shoes.

04:58.488 --> 05:01.528
So daily in the morning Sahajyogis

05:01.648 --> 05:04.888
move out in a line with shoes in their hands.

05:06.328 --> 05:09.168
O.k ! but if you have ego, then only

05:10.128 --> 05:12.888
Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand.

05:14.368 --> 05:15.368
All this

05:16.608 --> 05:19.408
karmakand  penetrated into Sahajyoga too.

05:21.328 --> 05:26.288
So much so, that from France a gentleman came

05:26.488 --> 05:30.648
from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there.

05:31.768 --> 05:34.008
It is for sick people.

05:34.408 --> 05:38.608
If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand

05:39.048 --> 05:42.368
The karmakand of cancer are written in that.

05:44.408 --> 05:46.768
I said it is human being's nature

05:47.488 --> 05:51.808
to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it

05:55.208 --> 05:57.643
because of my karmakand, work will be done

05:59.088 --> 06:01.087
and in this karmakand

06:01.288 --> 06:02.941
not only you

06:03.488 --> 06:05.135
in foreign country also

06:06.279 --> 06:09.279
many people go on doing karmakand of various types.

06:11.088 --> 06:12.168
For example

06:12.768 --> 06:15.448
will go to church once a year.

06:17.488 --> 06:18.568
Means today.

06:19.688 --> 06:22.368
After that they don't take even the name of God.

06:22.488 --> 06:24.808
After doing all the dirty jobs of world

06:25.088 --> 06:28.448
and go to Catholic  ( DHARAM) and make confession

06:30.408 --> 06:34.728
If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi.

06:35.528 --> 06:38.928
If you can understand that this wrong act

06:39.768 --> 06:41.608
What we have done is wrong

06:42.208 --> 06:44.408
and now onwards this act is not to be done.

06:45.168 --> 06:47.128
If you can understand this

06:47.848 --> 06:50.608
your brain will retain it

06:53.248 --> 06:54.248
Now,

06:55.088 --> 06:58.408
Karmakandis have got all the more qualities.

06:59.928 --> 07:03.768
One thing is that they are misers number one.

07:06.328 --> 07:08.408
If you talk to them about ten rupees

07:08.608 --> 07:11.168
they start jumping into the sky.

07:13.488 --> 07:15.928
That is called in Marathi, 'KODI CHUMBAK'

07:17.688 --> 07:20.248
One thing is that in Marathi there are such words

07:20.568 --> 07:22.648
That your ego will dissolve easily.

07:27.008 --> 07:28.328
For example somebody

07:28.528 --> 07:32.168
talked high of himself, i did this, i did that

07:33.608 --> 07:35.568
tell him in a low voice

07:37.888 --> 07:40.207
'You are climbing a chickpea tree'.

07:40.408 --> 07:42.308
A chickpea tree doesn't exist !

07:43.288 --> 07:46.208
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

07:46.688 --> 07:48.448
So he cools down.

07:49.128 --> 07:52.168
I did this, i did that, i

07:52.848 --> 07:55.208
Till this 'I' ness doesn't go

07:55.408 --> 07:59.168
till then our recognising Christ is wrong.

08:00.408 --> 08:02.088
But it is surprising

08:02.368 --> 08:05.888
that what is called ' Christian Nations' where there is christanity

08:06.288 --> 08:08.808
more than them egoistic I have not seen

08:09.808 --> 08:11.208
particularly English.

08:11.568 --> 08:12.568
American

08:13.008 --> 08:14.008
everybody

08:14.448 --> 08:16.688
is so much egoistic

08:17.128 --> 08:20.368
that can't understand these desciples of Christ.

08:22.288 --> 08:24.319
Now what is the remedy of this ego?

08:25.928 --> 08:27.272
that should be thought

08:28.248 --> 08:30.927
It's remedy was Jesus Christ

08:31.128 --> 08:33.168
and He has taught

08:33.368 --> 08:34.848
that now

08:37.208 --> 08:38.408
love everybody

08:40.928 --> 08:42.688
love your enemies too.

08:44.568 --> 08:47.128
It's remedy He said was 'Love'.

08:50.448 --> 08:52.448
and apart from 'Love'

08:53.048 --> 08:54.128
there is no remedy.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.568
But this 'Love'

09:00.288 --> 09:02.888
is the 'Love' of Param Chaitanya.

09:04.848 --> 09:08.968
He said clearly,'Seek yourself'.

09:10.208 --> 09:14.088
knock the door and the door will open !

09:16.448 --> 09:19.848
It doesn't mean that you go and knock the door.

09:21.488 --> 09:25.808
It means open the doors of your heart.

09:26.888 --> 09:29.008
A peson whose heart is small

09:30.128 --> 09:31.448
those who are misers

09:33.408 --> 09:36.848
that person can never be a Sahajyogi.

09:40.728 --> 09:45.088
And another thing which is very important

09:46.088 --> 09:48.528
if you get angry

09:49.728 --> 09:52.448
it means that you have too much ego.

09:55.968 --> 09:59.248
I have seen absolutely angry volatile people

10:01.488 --> 10:05.728
And they feel elated saying,'I am a very angry person'.

10:06.848 --> 10:08.808
Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga.

10:12.008 --> 10:16.888
Those who know to 'Love' and that too 'Pure Love'

10:18.568 --> 10:22.848
and that too such 'Love' where there is no expectation

10:23.488 --> 10:24.568
no desire

10:25.648 --> 10:28.808
those who completely know to love selflessly

10:29.328 --> 10:31.488
only they can be in Sahajyoga.

10:33.408 --> 10:36.088
Egoistic people do wrong acts.

10:36.808 --> 10:38.208
I am tired of them.

10:42.088 --> 10:44.484
They will start something on their own

10:46.168 --> 10:48.088
and they won't even tell me.

10:50.288 --> 10:51.888
and by doing so

10:52.288 --> 10:55.448
Today thousands of questions have risen

10:57.488 --> 10:59.928
Today it is worth saying that in Delhi

11:01.088 --> 11:03.008
once they

11:03.928 --> 11:06.808
on the day of some puja hurriedly told me

11:07.088 --> 11:09.727
that we are getting land only this much.

11:09.928 --> 11:11.488
How much did we charge ?

11:11.688 --> 11:16.008
How is that going to be ? How is the land ? Nothing !

11:16.328 --> 11:18.328
And no Sahajyogi told me.

11:20.328 --> 11:23.808
Because if tomorrow somebody says, 'Mataji has said so'

11:23.928 --> 11:26.408
leave that person.

11:28.968 --> 11:31.648
If I have to say something, I will tell myself.

11:32.488 --> 11:35.768
After that we had so many meetings, I didn't say anything.

11:35.928 --> 11:38.328
Now those who have given them money

11:39.088 --> 11:40.968
are holding their heads

11:42.768 --> 11:44.488
that they have been cheated !

11:45.368 --> 11:47.528
How to get back that money ?

11:47.928 --> 11:50.248
Without asking Me all the work

11:52.488 --> 11:54.328
Absolutely without asking Me.

11:54.488 --> 11:58.168
The land is so bad that they have received a notice

11:58.288 --> 12:02.608
that you cannot construct anything here. On the contrary you will be arrested

12:06.888 --> 12:10.168
Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me

12:11.448 --> 12:12.528
and ask Me

12:13.328 --> 12:15.368
they made a society of their own

12:15.568 --> 12:16.808
and became mad

12:17.328 --> 12:19.328
that they are getting land

12:20.168 --> 12:21.688
It is such a bad land

12:23.368 --> 12:26.088
It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken

12:26.928 --> 12:30.688
Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ?

12:35.488 --> 12:38.048
Now whatever has happened is foolishness !

12:38.288 --> 12:40.088
and for that I am not responsible.

12:41.968 --> 12:44.288
But you ask for your money back.

12:46.128 --> 12:48.088
It is none of My resposibility.

12:53.808 --> 12:56.008
Jesus Christ had said that

12:59.168 --> 13:00.368
those people

13:06.008 --> 13:07.608
make houses

13:08.848 --> 13:09.848
live in houses

13:10.568 --> 13:12.408
they should watch birds

13:14.888 --> 13:16.368
he makes his own (GHARONDA)

13:16.488 --> 13:21.208
with how much love they make a small one for their ownself

13:24.848 --> 13:27.048
and when they make their home

13:27.448 --> 13:30.848
they feel a great joy in constructing that home.

13:35.128 --> 13:38.168
He explained it in every way

13:38.368 --> 13:40.928
that you give up attatchment.

13:41.928 --> 13:42.808
This is my house.

13:44.088 --> 13:45.208
This is my land.

13:46.288 --> 13:47.648
They are my children.

13:49.168 --> 13:51.597
Even this much that it is my country.

13:53.848 --> 13:56.728
This attatchment should be given up.

13:57.088 --> 14:01.008
Then only you can be great.

14:04.128 --> 14:06.408
In the whole world you are

14:06.608 --> 14:08.128
brothers and sisters.

14:08.968 --> 14:12.688
It doesn't mean that you give up devotion to your country.

14:12.888 --> 14:13.968
Not at all !

14:14.088 --> 14:18.088
If you are not devoted to your country you can't do anything.

14:19.248 --> 14:22.200
Within you there should be devotion to country.

14:23.128 --> 14:26.967
But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world.

14:27.168 --> 14:29.208
If there is no devotion to one's country

14:29.328 --> 14:32.448
if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ?

14:33.688 --> 14:38.448
first of all whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all.

14:38.568 --> 14:41.327
If you are working  against your country

14:41.528 --> 14:43.368
you are not devoted to it.

14:43.808 --> 14:44.888
Jesus Christ

14:45.408 --> 14:47.808
had no need to go back.

14:48.648 --> 14:50.048
He had said also

14:50.528 --> 14:52.728
That there live such people

14:53.168 --> 14:55.808
Those who have the desire of only (MAL) are (MALECH)

14:57.128 --> 15:00.528
But Shalivahana told Him, 'No ! No 1 you go'.

15:00.728 --> 15:03.408
' And teach them (NIRMAL TATTWAM) the principle of purity.

15:05.688 --> 15:09.568
He went there to teach 'Nirmal Tatwam' and they put an end to His life.

15:10.888 --> 15:12.688
It is mad people's country.

15:14.048 --> 15:15.728
He didn't need to learn anything.

15:16.768 --> 15:18.288
But had to teach something.

15:18.488 --> 15:20.208
That is why He went there.

15:20.608 --> 15:22.208
and for the same reason

15:24.528 --> 15:26.288
His end was this way.

15:27.328 --> 15:29.008
But 'Wiseness' and 'Forgiveness'

15:30.648 --> 15:34.368
'Forgiveness' is the only mantra which can open Agnya chakra.

15:34.608 --> 15:37.648
If against anyone you have

15:40.248 --> 15:42.968
any ill feeling

15:43.728 --> 15:45.488
against anyone

15:45.968 --> 15:47.088
anger

15:48.168 --> 15:49.088
or

15:49.928 --> 15:54.128
if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone

15:54.408 --> 15:56.328
your Agnya cannot be up to the mark.

15:58.408 --> 16:00.008
Whatever you have to do

16:00.208 --> 16:01.728
you have to do with love.

16:03.328 --> 16:06.968
Even if you have to say something to anyone you have to say

16:07.088 --> 16:09.648
so that his life becomes 'NIRMAL'.

16:10.528 --> 16:13.368
It doesn't mean that you spoil your children.

16:14.408 --> 16:15.568
To children

16:15.768 --> 16:18.008
you have to perfectly

16:21.448 --> 16:22.928
discipline

16:23.968 --> 16:26.608
If you cannot discipline children

16:26.888 --> 16:29.528
your children can never be good Sahajyogis.

16:31.888 --> 16:35.048
And for that you must be yourself disciplined.

16:37.488 --> 16:41.728
If you are not disciplined yourself you cannot discipline your children.

16:42.688 --> 16:47.408
About Jesus Christ's life very little was written.

16:47.848 --> 16:50.728
But He was so disciplined

16:51.848 --> 16:53.168
In this way

16:54.408 --> 16:55.488
tolerated

16:57.328 --> 16:59.048
and from His life He showed

17:00.128 --> 17:02.408
He didn't need to be married

17:03.928 --> 17:05.368
He didn't marry

17:05.728 --> 17:08.728
It doesn't mean that He was against marriage.

17:09.328 --> 17:13.048
People have such wrong notions

17:14.528 --> 17:15.728
And that is why

17:18.208 --> 17:20.088
they have self made notions

17:20.288 --> 17:23.808
the women who are called 'NUNS' were married to Jesus Christ

17:23.968 --> 17:25.288
He was Sakhshat Ganesha !

17:26.048 --> 17:27.808
How can anyone be married to Him ?

17:29.608 --> 17:30.688
Apart from that

17:31.488 --> 17:34.128
Men also no to marry

17:34.768 --> 17:37.808
such unnatural/ uncultural  concepts were taught.

17:38.968 --> 17:43.768
With that everyone can be kept under control

17:44.008 --> 17:47.008
but one cannot become Christian.

17:51.008 --> 17:52.048
like such

17:53.648 --> 17:55.648
[KRITRIM BANDHAN]

17:56.208 --> 17:58.448
to cover oneself

17:58.648 --> 18:01.408
today Chritian religion is losing its importance.

18:01.888 --> 18:03.368
They forgot Jesus !

18:04.088 --> 18:06.528
and created a religion out of their own

18:06.928 --> 18:08.928
and call it Christian religion.

18:20.488 --> 18:22.328
The Christian religion of today

18:23.088 --> 18:26.048
Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus !

18:27.088 --> 18:29.328
Because I was born in this religion

18:29.528 --> 18:32.328
I saw the ins and outs of this religion.

18:35.368 --> 18:38.088
The same is the case with Hindu religion.

18:39.408 --> 18:43.208
In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all.

18:45.208 --> 18:50.008
Because your various gurus, real gurus

18:50.208 --> 18:54.528
like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies

18:55.048 --> 18:58.968
are your many incarnations

18:59.168 --> 19:02.288
and your Sayambus are many.

19:04.728 --> 19:08.408
You don't have one book. You have number of books.

19:08.768 --> 19:11.448
Only Jesus and Bible

19:12.128 --> 19:15.888
They can be fundamentalists.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.568
And they can be Yahudis also

19:21.728 --> 19:24.528
And all the three are related to each other.

19:25.168 --> 19:26.848
It is written in books.

19:27.488 --> 19:30.328
But a Hindu can never be communal.

19:31.168 --> 19:34.808
Because some have some guru and others a different guru.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.648
Some adore Mahalaxmi.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.408
Others  Renuka Devi.

19:41.368 --> 19:43.128
Some to Krishna.

19:46.248 --> 19:48.408
So, every person

19:50.048 --> 19:55.368
every family individually

19:58.648 --> 20:00.768
adore incarnation, books.

20:03.128 --> 20:05.408
As such there is no book

20:05.608 --> 20:08.688
which can be called as Holy Bible.

20:10.368 --> 20:12.408
So to all the religions

20:13.248 --> 20:18.368
a Hindu should pay respect.

20:19.248 --> 20:20.248
I have noticed

20:21.048 --> 20:24.008
The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus.

20:25.648 --> 20:28.448
Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible.

20:30.648 --> 20:34.288
They keep a Bible (IN THE ROOM) whether somebody reads or not.

20:34.448 --> 20:36.448
That Bible fell on the floor.

20:36.968 --> 20:40.608
There was one Hindu with us.

20:41.168 --> 20:46.568
He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table.

20:48.688 --> 20:51.128
They will never touch The Bible with their feet.

20:52.728 --> 20:54.808
The Christians will do so.

20:56.208 --> 20:57.808
A Hindu will never do so.

20:57.928 --> 21:01.408
To respect everybody is Hindu's Dharma.

21:02.248 --> 21:07.968
But those who have come out of it are very very strange.

21:09.928 --> 21:12.288
Those who are our politicians

21:12.488 --> 21:14.568
such people have taken birth.

21:15.928 --> 21:17.728
As mushrooms come out in monsoon

21:17.928 --> 21:19.608
same way some people have come out.

21:20.368 --> 21:22.088
But they are not Hindus.

21:25.408 --> 21:28.488
They don't know anything about their (DHARMA) religion.

21:29.168 --> 21:31.768
North Indians don't know it at all.

21:32.488 --> 21:33.568
And those

21:34.808 --> 21:36.488
who are South Indians

21:36.968 --> 21:39.088
they know that bramhins have to be given money

21:39.208 --> 21:42.088
here and there, have to do this and that (RITUALS).

21:42.208 --> 21:45.688
In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand.

21:46.408 --> 21:47.728
They are so karmakandi.

21:47.928 --> 21:49.768
In Maharashtra I have worked very hard.

21:50.088 --> 21:51.488
Everything was waste.

21:51.928 --> 21:54.248
Because they are very ritualistic  (KARMAKANDI).

21:54.368 --> 21:55.928
They cannot give it up.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.408
Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak.

21:58.848 --> 22:01.928
The Ganeshji that is there, I have awakened that.

22:02.608 --> 22:06.848
Now what do I see that there one mile long

22:08.928 --> 22:11.568
long lines one mile long

22:12.888 --> 22:14.568
are standing on Tuesday.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.608
Gneshji too must have slept.

22:20.608 --> 22:24.968
The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra.

22:25.848 --> 22:29.208
Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot.

22:31.968 --> 22:33.528
And in North India also

22:34.328 --> 22:35.728
I have seen

22:35.928 --> 22:38.168
that some people are Karmakandi.

22:39.288 --> 22:41.328
And those who are Karmakandi

22:41.728 --> 22:44.328
they have lot of anger, are hot tempered.

22:46.368 --> 22:50.848
And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool.

22:52.008 --> 22:55.728
So the first thing is Stop ritualism

22:55.848 --> 22:58.008
but respect everything.

22:58.768 --> 23:01.568
Stopping ritualism doesn't mean to kick everything.

23:03.688 --> 23:08.128
This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ.

23:10.248 --> 23:13.448
Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open.

23:15.168 --> 23:19.248
Everbody's respect

23:19.448 --> 23:27.008
and unnecessary

23:27.208 --> 23:31.768
ritualism, in which wrong people are growing.

23:35.208 --> 23:38.968
Now a day's false gurus

23:39.408 --> 23:41.888
They exist because of ritualism (KARMAKAND).

23:44.248 --> 23:47.888
They will say you give so much money, do this do that.

23:48.088 --> 23:50.448
Do Havana

23:51.528 --> 23:56.368
108 times daily read these names, those names

23:56.568 --> 23:59.288
giving you mantras, doing this that.

23:59.448 --> 24:03.648
These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand.

24:03.928 --> 24:07.408
Completely against which is Jesus Christ.

24:15.928 --> 24:20.288
Which He knew that by doing Karmakand

24:21.928 --> 24:23.928
a human being becomes egoistic.

24:25.048 --> 24:27.408
and to crack this ego,

24:28.008 --> 24:30.688
To Karmakand, He

24:33.568 --> 24:35.288
had totally forbidden.

24:42.848 --> 24:46.888
The same way, in the name of God

24:47.888 --> 24:51.008
anyone earning money was objectionable to Him.

24:52.848 --> 24:54.768
On the contrary reverse process started.

24:55.648 --> 24:58.008
Earn money and consume.

25:00.168 --> 25:01.888
They don't give up earning

25:02.088 --> 25:04.408
but (believe to) earn money and consume.

25:06.408 --> 25:08.248
It doesn't solve any problem.

25:10.368 --> 25:12.208
Today in Sahajyoga work

25:12.488 --> 25:13.928
We should remember

25:14.688 --> 25:19.008
how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work.

25:20.408 --> 25:22.368
How much money did we give?

25:24.448 --> 25:27.568
Jesus Christ had twelve  fish killers.

25:28.728 --> 25:29.848
Even they

25:32.368 --> 25:34.848
spread in the  whole world by working hard.

25:35.688 --> 25:38.048
Today you are so many disciples of mine.

25:39.088 --> 25:40.688
And if you want

25:40.888 --> 25:43.648
you can give realisation to so many people.

25:45.768 --> 25:48.768
Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga.

25:49.408 --> 25:51.568
But the people should not be half baked.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.128
They should be deep.

25:54.368 --> 25:58.768
Unless they are deep, they cannot understand.

25:58.968 --> 26:02.728
And for that the greatest thing is

26:03.848 --> 26:05.928
that how much we love them.

26:06.728 --> 26:09.808
And how much love they give to others.

26:10.808 --> 26:12.848
Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga

26:13.048 --> 26:14.928
he should remember first of all

26:15.048 --> 26:19.808
that the teaching of Jesus Christ is to love everybody.

26:20.528 --> 26:22.408
Am i doing that ?

26:23.928 --> 26:25.728
I shower my anger over everyone.

26:26.408 --> 26:28.528
I keep everybody under control

26:31.568 --> 26:33.608
I express my anger with my eyes.

26:35.568 --> 26:37.008
This ego is

26:37.208 --> 26:38.528
very much

26:40.888 --> 26:42.808
not only against  Sahajyoga

26:43.168 --> 26:44.928
but his destructor

26:46.328 --> 26:48.208
Whosoever is egoistic

26:48.608 --> 26:53.168
should lessen it and replace it with love

26:53.728 --> 26:56.128
Life will be  a pleasure.

26:57.088 --> 26:58.648
Life will be beautiful !

26:59.808 --> 27:01.648
If you don't know how to love

27:01.848 --> 27:04.248
then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga.

27:04.368 --> 27:07.088
First you open the doors of your heart.

27:09.648 --> 27:14.148
With that only With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread.

27:15.368 --> 27:17.807
The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga

27:18.008 --> 27:21.568
they have the Shakti of love less and the Shakti of anger more.

27:21.688 --> 27:23.005
It will never spread.

27:25.008 --> 27:29.328
With love it will spread And with anger it will minimise and diminish.

27:31.088 --> 27:36.328
The teaching of Jesus is necessary for us to understand.

27:38.888 --> 27:41.488
Sorry ! I had to talk in Hindi language

27:41.688 --> 27:44.568
because most of the people are here Indians

27:44.768 --> 27:46.968
Some of them are Marathis

27:47.168 --> 27:50.688
and others are from North India.

27:51.528 --> 27:54.648
I was telling them about Christ.

27:54.848 --> 27:56.848
What was His power ?

27:57.048 --> 27:59.528
His power was of 'Love'.

28:01.888 --> 28:04.848
And not of anger

28:07.208 --> 28:10.408
Because He is the one

28:10.608 --> 28:12.968
who has crossed

28:13.168 --> 28:18.728
the most difficult center of Agnya.

28:20.848 --> 28:22.888
Those people who have ego

28:24.248 --> 28:26.128
never realise they have ego

28:27.728 --> 28:28.928
With their ego they do

28:29.128 --> 28:31.568
all kinds of nonsensical things.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.448
Without asking Me

28:33.648 --> 28:36.128
they have done something in Delhi.

28:36.888 --> 28:37.808
Without asking me

28:38.008 --> 28:39.928
they have done something in Russia.

28:40.488 --> 28:42.848
And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga.

28:43.968 --> 28:45.448
that they don't realise

28:46.408 --> 28:48.408
what they have done is the crime

28:48.608 --> 28:52.008
which is punishable by all Divine laws.

28:56.528 --> 28:59.008
If you want to do anything you must

28:59.528 --> 29:01.008
tell me beforehand.

29:01.968 --> 29:03.488
You must consult Me

29:03.688 --> 29:05.168
you must talk to Me

29:05.288 --> 29:08.448
Because I know what is happening.

29:09.048 --> 29:12.568
You don't know if somebody wants to cheat you.

29:14.288 --> 29:17.808
Then how will you know if you were

29:18.848 --> 29:20.968
so sensitive you would find out

29:23.848 --> 29:25.368
You would have asked Me,

29:25.568 --> 29:27.568
'Mother what should we do ?'

29:29.248 --> 29:30.848
At least ask Me.

29:32.088 --> 29:35.168
This is the main thing missing among

29:35.888 --> 29:37.448
Sahajyogis now that

29:37.648 --> 29:40.848
we have a kind of a very subtle ego.

29:41.768 --> 29:43.408
If you make somebody a leader

29:43.728 --> 29:45.688
it is very dangerous sometimes.

29:45.808 --> 29:48.528
If the leader developes ego because of his wife,

29:49.848 --> 29:51.688
It is a very difficult thing.

29:51.808 --> 29:53.928
They can destroy Sahajyoga completely.

29:57.688 --> 29:59.088
Anything is possible.

30:00.528 --> 30:02.928
So before you do anything like that

30:03.248 --> 30:04.608
you have to consult (Me).

30:05.128 --> 30:06.288
I am still living

30:07.088 --> 30:07.968
and you can ask.

30:08.808 --> 30:11.688
You can write to Me, you can telephone too.

30:14.208 --> 30:15.848
At least I am there to tell you.

30:17.128 --> 30:19.168
But then you have to develop

30:19.488 --> 30:21.328
your balance and your love.

30:22.168 --> 30:25.208
That is only through this Param Chaitanya

30:25.848 --> 30:28.808
It is all pervading power of Divine Love.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.288
You can develop that discretion.

30:33.088 --> 30:33.888
special

30:34.368 --> 30:37.088
.....powers.

30:37.608 --> 30:39.608
Even if somebody telephones to Me

30:39.728 --> 30:42.688
immediately I know what is wrong with that person.

30:44.048 --> 30:46.288
I don't say that you can become like Me.

30:46.488 --> 30:49.768
But at least you have vibrations to see.

30:50.488 --> 30:52.608
Also see your own vibrations.

30:53.808 --> 30:54.928
How are you moving ?

30:55.688 --> 30:57.128
Put a paper on your hand

30:57.728 --> 31:00.968
and you will see it will start shaking before My photograph.

31:02.968 --> 31:04.048
With this ego

31:05.408 --> 31:06.648
you cannot go further

31:07.248 --> 31:08.808
Why did you come to sahajyoga ?

31:09.568 --> 31:11.728
You came here not to become

31:11.928 --> 31:13.008
some sort of a leader

31:13.488 --> 31:14.888
or some sort of a

31:16.648 --> 31:17.728
a king but

31:19.048 --> 31:20.648
you came here

31:21.008 --> 31:24.088
to become a great guru.

31:24.648 --> 31:26.928
As you ask Me Gurupad Dijiye.

31:28.528 --> 31:31.448
For that you have to have in Sahajyoga

31:31.768 --> 31:34.408
a complete humility

31:35.328 --> 31:37.008
natural humility

31:40.688 --> 31:42.368
natural balance.

31:42.888 --> 31:46.128
This is what Christ has taught us.

31:59.448 --> 32:00.568
At that time

32:03.488 --> 32:05.808
I don't think that people had that much ego.

32:06.848 --> 32:09.728
Ego is a modern present to you.

32:11.008 --> 32:13.128
People get ego out of anything.

32:15.408 --> 32:20.928
For example, I met one lady once and found her ego very bad.

32:21.448 --> 32:23.888
I said, ''What is the matter with her?''

32:24.168 --> 32:26.568
So, I asked My daughters ,''What does she do?''

32:26.848 --> 32:30.608
They said," Mummy She knows how to make dolls.''

32:31.528 --> 32:32.648
For that she had ego.

32:34.928 --> 32:35.808
What is so great

32:36.648 --> 32:38.168
than to be a good sahajyogi

32:38.568 --> 32:40.928
You may be the king, you may be anything.

32:41.088 --> 32:42.848
Now you see the Prime Ministers

32:43.048 --> 32:44.888
and all of them going to jail.

32:46.728 --> 32:48.528
What are they compared to you?

32:48.648 --> 32:49.848
They have no balance.

32:50.648 --> 32:51.768
They have no sense.

32:54.728 --> 32:56.928
What makes you a separate

32:58.288 --> 32:59.368
individuals

33:00.088 --> 33:01.928
higher people, because

33:02.928 --> 33:05.968
you have no ego.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.768
Now people try to remove their ego

33:13.248 --> 33:14.328
Their two types.....

33:16.008 --> 33:19.208
So they will go on beating themselves with shoes.

33:21.368 --> 33:25.048
All kinds of ritualistic things they do to remove their ego.

33:26.168 --> 33:28.448
But all this we do with our mind.

33:29.608 --> 33:32.688
Whatever you do with your mind will give you ego only.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.208
They become ascetic.

33:37.488 --> 33:39.768
They are the greatest egoist.

33:39.968 --> 33:43.048
I must say, Hitler was the greatest ascetic.

33:43.888 --> 33:46.248
With his asceticism he became Hitler.

33:46.448 --> 33:49.528
If you want to become Hitler, you become ascetic.

33:50.368 --> 33:52.888
In Sahajyoga you are not allowed at all

33:53.328 --> 33:54.448
all this asceticism.

34:01.248 --> 34:03.288
You have to be loving

34:03.928 --> 34:05.008
affectionate

34:05.488 --> 34:07.568
kind and disciplined.

34:09.448 --> 34:12.528
I must say this because when you are loving

34:13.008 --> 34:15.928
you go out of bounds sometimes

34:16.408 --> 34:18.807
because you have no discipline of sahajyoga.

34:19.008 --> 34:24.848
Loving doesn't mean that you become like a

34:26.328 --> 34:28.048
Romeo, Juliet,doesn't mean that.

34:30.368 --> 34:33.928
You must have your balance through your discipline.

34:34.968 --> 34:36.768
If you have no discipline

34:36.888 --> 34:40.208
you can never be a good Sahajyogi.

34:43.888 --> 34:45.648
From the life of Christ

34:46.368 --> 34:47.488
we have to learn

34:48.208 --> 34:49.368
these things

34:49.568 --> 34:52.848
that unless and until we have these things

34:53.088 --> 34:55.128
we cannot

34:58.008 --> 34:59.408
become good Sahajyogis.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.568
Firstly, ritualistic nature

35:05.248 --> 35:06.768
secondly, anger

35:07.848 --> 35:09.888
thirdly, miserliness.

35:11.728 --> 35:13.888
like

35:14.368 --> 35:15.528
if you

35:16.768 --> 35:18.008
go to England

35:18.328 --> 35:19.408
it is written there

35:19.528 --> 35:21.968
'save pounds by taking a taxi'

35:26.648 --> 35:27.768
this is what it is.

35:28.328 --> 35:29.408
Miserliness

35:29.648 --> 35:31.768
where can we save money,

35:32.288 --> 35:35.487
'Mother, can you give concession?'

35:35.688 --> 35:39.488
it is not a some sort of a business I am doing here.

35:42.128 --> 35:45.608
'If you make it half price, so many will come'.

35:48.648 --> 35:50.568
''I am not using your money''.

35:50.968 --> 35:54.975
I am using it for your buildings, all this I have got it

35:55.728 --> 35:58.368
of course My money also and your money.

35:59.448 --> 36:00.928
So many things I have done

36:01.648 --> 36:03.128
The whole of Vashi

36:03.808 --> 36:05.528
the whole of Ashram

36:07.448 --> 36:08.928
In Delhi two ashrams,

36:09.368 --> 36:10.928
then the whole of school

36:11.888 --> 36:12.808
and also

36:13.488 --> 36:15.608
land in Pune and other places.

36:16.488 --> 36:18.248
Now in Pune they want Me

36:18.368 --> 36:20.848
to pay the land, to pay for everything

36:21.008 --> 36:23.688
and Pune people are the known Maharashtrians

36:23.808 --> 36:24.928
to be great

36:25.568 --> 36:27.568
miserly, kanjoos people.

36:30.488 --> 36:32.408
Even for their own

36:33.048 --> 36:36.608
ashram, they would like Me to pay for everything.

36:37.448 --> 36:39.968
and they nicely go and sing bhajans nicely.

36:40.368 --> 36:43.408
See they are good musicians, that is what they are.

36:43.608 --> 36:46.008
Very very miserly people.

36:51.688 --> 36:53.608
Miserly people can never love.

36:53.728 --> 36:54.808
Tthey love money.

36:56.368 --> 36:58.568
Egoistical people can never love

36:58.688 --> 37:00.528
because they love power

37:00.968 --> 37:02.048
to control others.

37:05.768 --> 37:08.048
They think theey are doing for Sahajyoga.

37:08.648 --> 37:09.728
but not.

37:09.848 --> 37:13.448
Unless until you do something for yourself and ego

37:13.928 --> 37:15.888
no use working for Sahajyoga.

37:19.568 --> 37:20.728
Look at The Christ

37:21.528 --> 37:23.608
He took birth in a very humble

37:24.208 --> 37:25.328
abode.

37:27.088 --> 37:28.448
But He was the king.

37:30.488 --> 37:32.008
And He lived with the poor

37:35.928 --> 37:37.208
and tried to save them.

37:37.328 --> 37:38.528
He saved the lepers.

37:38.728 --> 37:40.728
He saved so many people, there were.

37:40.928 --> 37:44.928
Twenty one people were cured by Him.

37:45.128 --> 37:48.528
Now sahaj yoga I don't know, how many thousands have been cured.

37:52.728 --> 37:55.208
But what is important is if you are curing

37:55.568 --> 37:57.808
you know that you are not curing

37:57.928 --> 38:00.728
It is the Divine power that is curing.

38:03.008 --> 38:04.608
You are not doing anything

38:06.248 --> 38:07.928
It is best to be like that.

38:08.048 --> 38:10.368
I feel the same way that I am doing nothing

38:11.008 --> 38:12.128
and I am Nishkriya

38:12.968 --> 38:13.848
doing nothing.

38:15.128 --> 38:16.528
but I am not lazy.

38:20.328 --> 38:23.208
You should be active but all your activity

38:23.328 --> 38:26.768
should come from the Divine power of 'Love'

38:27.648 --> 38:30.688
First of all you must extend your hands for l'ove'.

38:31.488 --> 38:32.768
You extend your heart

38:32.888 --> 38:33.928
extend your money

38:34.048 --> 38:37.168
house, everything for 'Love'

38:39.328 --> 38:42.128
Now once your wife doesn't allow others to come in

38:42.248 --> 38:44.608
throw her out of the house, I don't mind.

38:47.528 --> 38:51.168
Teach her how to be kind and generous

38:51.328 --> 38:53.440
otherway round for the husband.

38:54.488 --> 38:55.835
It is very important

38:56.328 --> 39:01.088
you have to be generous. You have to be kind, you have to be loving

39:01.648 --> 39:03.236
and sweet to others.

39:04.568 --> 39:06.648
Christ only once went into temper

39:06.848 --> 39:08.608
which He had a right to do that

39:08.928 --> 39:10.048
when He saw people

39:10.408 --> 39:12.248
selling things in the temple.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.048
Samething we have here.

39:16.608 --> 39:20.568
And if you don't go and buy anything from them they will be lost.

39:22.248 --> 39:25.007
But you only go and buy things from them because

39:25.208 --> 39:27.087
you have a habit of shopping.

39:27.288 --> 39:30.128
Anywhere they people go, they must shop

39:30.888 --> 39:31.968
is a habit

39:33.248 --> 39:34.688
shopping they must do.

39:34.808 --> 39:36.568
They will not see the greenery

39:36.728 --> 39:38.528
the beauty of nature, nothing.

39:39.728 --> 39:43.368
When I went to so many countries,you see I had to

39:44.208 --> 39:45.568
with my husband

39:46.448 --> 39:48.408
I had to go

39:48.688 --> 39:51.568
and see beautiful places like museums.

39:52.208 --> 39:53.288
I never used to shop.

39:54.368 --> 39:58.047
But when I have so many children then I have to shop.

39:58.248 --> 39:59.954
So I would go for shops.

40:00.368 --> 40:02.168
But not the way that

40:02.288 --> 40:04.248
that every place is for shopping.

40:05.048 --> 40:06.568
What is there to shop here

40:06.848 --> 40:10.088
when you have come here for your spiritual growth.

40:11.768 --> 40:14.048
In Mecca, do they have any shops?

40:18.048 --> 40:19.848
This is the holier than holi.

40:21.088 --> 40:23.768
Why should go to the shops ? I can't understand.

40:23.888 --> 40:26.648
I have told them not to have shops

40:26.848 --> 40:30.168
but you people are the ones, who encourage.

40:31.488 --> 40:34.288
who encouraged them to make money out of us ?

40:36.928 --> 40:38.928
Nothing essential to buy there.

40:40.208 --> 40:44.088
Now you have come to the holy occassion.

40:44.448 --> 40:47.968
Here you have come for your worship.

40:50.808 --> 40:53.048
In our Mahalaxmi temple

40:53.248 --> 40:55.488
there are people who are selling

40:55.688 --> 40:58.288
garlands and things for ladies' hair.

40:58.888 --> 41:01.168
But they say it is for the Goddess.

41:01.608 --> 41:02.728
And they buy there.

41:03.288 --> 41:05.608
All the people who are coming stupidly

41:06.328 --> 41:08.608
and give it

41:09.088 --> 41:11.008
to the brahmin in the temple

41:11.408 --> 41:13.448
and the Brahmin sells it back

41:14.248 --> 41:15.368
at a lower price.

41:16.048 --> 41:18.568
And these garlands are

41:19.048 --> 41:21.328
I don't know how many times sold and bought

41:21.448 --> 41:23.528
and sold and bought because of the

41:23.728 --> 41:25.928
stupidity of the people who go there.

41:26.968 --> 41:28.488
If they have to take something

41:28.688 --> 41:30.475
they should buy it from outside,

41:31.528 --> 41:33.448
not at the place where you have come.

41:39.528 --> 41:42.968
As it is you went to Delhi, you could have bought it there.

41:44.528 --> 41:46.088
or you came to Bombay

41:46.288 --> 41:48.968
you could have bought there but not in this place.

41:49.288 --> 41:52.648
We cannot make this place Bombay or Delhi

41:52.968 --> 41:55.048
otherwise why should we come here.

41:56.408 --> 41:58.208
That is why christ took a hunter

42:00.368 --> 42:04.608
and beat them those who were selling things near the church.

42:07.408 --> 42:08.488
Now they don't have

42:09.168 --> 42:11.768
I have seen, near the church they don't have.

42:11.968 --> 42:13.328
They have outside.

42:15.928 --> 42:17.528
But they sell other things

42:18.088 --> 42:21.048
like catholic church sells

42:21.688 --> 42:24.168
a wine called Benedictine.

42:24.288 --> 42:25.368
Imagine !

42:26.888 --> 42:28.008
That is another story.

42:29.848 --> 42:30.928
Christ went

42:34.728 --> 42:35.808
for wedding

42:37.808 --> 42:40.128
and they had no wine.

42:40.648 --> 42:42.248
Now in the Hibru language

42:42.488 --> 42:43.648
wine

42:43.848 --> 42:45.368
means

42:45.768 --> 42:48.208
the juice of the grapes.

42:48.408 --> 42:49.928
It doesn't mean fermented.

42:52.208 --> 42:55.008
So He converted water into black wine.

42:56.488 --> 42:57.768
You cannot convert

42:58.928 --> 43:01.568
water instatantaneously

43:01.968 --> 43:03.528
into wine.

43:03.728 --> 43:06.128
Wine has to rot , has to smell

43:06.248 --> 43:08.688
The more it smells, the best it is.

43:10.688 --> 43:14.568
But they think that Christ said you must drink this thing.

43:17.248 --> 43:18.328
He never said that.

43:19.728 --> 43:23.568
He just converted it into wine.

43:23.928 --> 43:24.768
meaning

43:25.248 --> 43:26.008
the

43:26.208 --> 43:30.128
taste of the juice of grapes.

43:30.808 --> 43:31.928
Once I went

43:32.848 --> 43:34.128
to some television

43:34.728 --> 43:37.808
and there was a very nice man in Italy.

43:38.008 --> 43:42.008
He said ,''Mother you first give me realisation''.

43:42.608 --> 43:45.208
So I said ,''Get some Water''. I put My hand into it.

43:45.728 --> 43:46.688
" Now you drink it".

43:47.008 --> 43:49.928
He said ,"It is tasting like wine".

43:50.328 --> 43:52.448
I said,"This is what Christ did".

43:53.408 --> 43:54.928
He got his realisation.

43:55.248 --> 43:58.168
Instantaneously, you cannot make wine.

43:59.488 --> 44:02.928
But if somebody dies, they will drink.

44:03.768 --> 44:05.968
If somebody is born, they will drink.

44:06.528 --> 44:09.848
At any cost, without drinking they are not normal.

44:16.048 --> 44:18.847
But the people who got realisation are suddenly changed.

44:19.048 --> 44:21.528
They don't want to drink. They have stopped drinking.

44:21.648 --> 44:23.527
Their attention has become nice.

44:23.728 --> 44:25.408
The whole thing is changed.

44:25.888 --> 44:28.168
This is the transformation that has worked

44:29.368 --> 44:32.128
of which Christ has talked, Mohammed sahib has talked

44:32.488 --> 44:35.408
everybody has talked about this particular time

44:35.608 --> 44:38.208
when people will get transformed.

44:38.568 --> 44:40.808
But even after transformation

44:41.208 --> 44:44.488
you do not want to become what you have to be

44:46.408 --> 44:48.414
for which you have come here.

44:49.928 --> 44:51.248
You will be left behind.

44:51.968 --> 44:53.055
It is a big

45:01.968 --> 45:04.071
transformation is taking place.

45:05.408 --> 45:08.864
In that transformation also your rising is taking place.

45:09.488 --> 45:12.208
There is a big evolution going on

45:12.608 --> 45:15.448
and those who will not evolve properly

45:15.648 --> 45:16.968
will be left behind.

45:20.768 --> 45:24.448
As it is said that, it is the last judgement.

45:26.328 --> 45:27.939
And you will be judged.

45:28.208 --> 45:29.928
You will be left behind.

45:30.968 --> 45:33.928
You cannot adhere to people who are rising higher.

45:34.848 --> 45:36.848
With your weight you will fall down.

45:38.928 --> 45:40.568
So for you

45:42.168 --> 45:43.528
to understand Christ

45:43.768 --> 45:46.608
is all these qualities you must have.

45:47.488 --> 45:51.528
If you are hot tempered , alright , go and beat yourself with shoes.

45:52.288 --> 45:54.768
But if you are not, then you need not.

45:56.048 --> 45:57.408
You must know what you are.

45:57.528 --> 45:58.968
First of all introspect.

45:59.088 --> 46:01.368
Accordingly you should work it out.

46:01.568 --> 46:05.328
But this ritualism is not allwed in Sahajyoga all the time.

46:22.808 --> 46:25.528
I would love all my children.

46:27.248 --> 46:30.248
To be extremely loving and collective.

46:31.928 --> 46:36.168
Not to denounce anybody for no rhyme and reason

46:36.528 --> 46:38.968
and if you have to denounce, you should tell Me.

46:39.288 --> 46:41.128
I know what is what !

46:41.808 --> 46:45.168
Without asking Me, you should not measure up somebody

46:45.288 --> 46:46.928
and say i have measured somebody.

46:47.048 --> 46:49.271
With what ? what is your yardstick ?

46:51.688 --> 46:55.688
You yourself you are caught up in the web of ego.

46:57.808 --> 47:01.128
You cannot condemn anyone without telling Me.

47:01.888 --> 47:03.287
You have to tell me.

47:03.488 --> 47:06.408
Don't worry that this thing will disturb Me or anything

47:06.608 --> 47:08.167
but you should ask.

47:08.368 --> 47:10.047
I know about everyone.

47:10.248 --> 47:13.848
May be I have not mat that person but i can feel the vibrations.

47:16.448 --> 47:17.848
You can write to me.

47:18.432 --> 47:21.247
Many people just telephone, that is not the way.

47:21.448 --> 47:25.168
You must write to Me because I read each and every letter.

47:25.728 --> 47:30.047
But all nonsensical letters you should not write also to waste my time.

47:30.248 --> 47:35.328
.....like my father's mother's, mother, this thing

47:35.528 --> 47:40.568
is sick or is dead and her bhoot is moving about.

47:44.048 --> 47:46.848
All sorts of funny letters come to Me.

47:47.049 --> 47:50.128
What can I do for such people ? That is not important.

47:50.248 --> 47:53.008
All: "I need money, I have no money.

47:53.208 --> 47:58.208
I am depending on you for money. So please send me money."

48:00.728 --> 48:02.888
You can ask on my photograph.

48:04.728 --> 48:08.648
If you are a good Sahajyogi, you don't have to worry for money also.

48:11.448 --> 48:15.808
Or i have no child ,Mother what to do? Mother i want to have a child.

48:15.928 --> 48:19.237
Those who have child, ask them what do else they have to say.

48:21.088 --> 48:24.648
So many have got children after coming to Sahajyoga

48:24.768 --> 48:26.688
but you must deserve it.

48:31.928 --> 48:35.488
So many miracles have taken place.

48:35.688 --> 48:39.088
So many people have been cured no doubt.

48:40.248 --> 48:42.608
But that doesn't mean that you have done it.

48:44.368 --> 48:48.368
Don't get into the trap of ego.

48:51.168 --> 48:53.288
That is most dangerous.

48:54.048 --> 48:58.048
If you destroy sahajyoga, you are destroying yourself.

49:03.448 --> 49:06.848
So, today you all have to promise in your heart.

49:08.008 --> 49:09.928
Put your hands to your heart

49:10.328 --> 49:11.248
and to say

49:12.288 --> 49:14.528
''Mother, We love,

49:15.968 --> 49:18.368
We spread your Divine Love,

49:19.008 --> 49:21.128
encompass the whole world,

49:21.648 --> 49:23.888
give realisation to all the people.

49:24.648 --> 49:25.728
Will not shout,

49:26.888 --> 49:28.248
will not be angry,

49:28.648 --> 49:34.488
will not do the all kinds of rituals but just surrender.

49:35.528 --> 49:37.008
Surrender our ego

49:37.728 --> 49:38.648
surrender ego

49:39.048 --> 49:40.568
surrender your ego.

49:40.808 --> 49:42.968
All your problems can be solved.

49:43.368 --> 49:45.288
because, as long as, there is ego

49:45.608 --> 49:47.888
this divine power doesn't take over.

49:48.608 --> 49:49.728
You may do anything

49:50.128 --> 49:52.808
You are not connected. Your connection is missing.

49:54.048 --> 49:56.368
Christ is missing. He is no more.

49:58.768 --> 50:03.648
To establish Him first of all you must show how you love.

50:03.968 --> 50:06.488
That doesn't mean that you love your wife,

50:06.608 --> 50:08.968
love your children and love your house.

50:10.608 --> 50:12.728
You have to love everyone.

50:14.168 --> 50:16.888
Try to make everyone happy.

50:18.088 --> 50:19.488
That is why I like music

50:19.608 --> 50:22.728
because through music you can spread vibrations.

50:23.968 --> 50:26.888
Very good media of spreading vibrations

50:27.888 --> 50:29.647
of loving vibrations.

50:29.848 --> 50:33.928
But those who are musicians have to be loving people,

50:35.928 --> 50:37.245
not hot tempered

50:38.848 --> 50:40.253
not showing off

50:42.008 --> 50:44.768
not thinking too much of themselves.

50:46.208 --> 50:47.608
All these will work

50:48.368 --> 50:50.408
very well if you understand

50:50.608 --> 50:53.608
that this Divine power

50:53.808 --> 50:55.728
is so powerful.

50:57.688 --> 50:58.808
No doubt it is love,

50:59.608 --> 51:02.008
no doubt it is truth,

51:02.928 --> 51:04.608
and no doubt

51:06.288 --> 51:10.208
if you get out of it, you will be caught up by anything

51:10.408 --> 51:12.408
and you could be finished.

51:14.728 --> 51:17.008
It is a very very

51:18.208 --> 51:23.288
powerful, effective and absolutely conclusive

51:24.448 --> 51:26.768
power you have within yourself.

51:27.888 --> 51:30.688
And thanks to christ that crucified Himself

51:31.048 --> 51:33.448
sacrificed his body for our sake

51:33.728 --> 51:35.208
that our agnya is opened up.

51:35.408 --> 51:37.808
Otherwise I could not have done this Sahajyoga.

51:40.128 --> 51:41.768
But in this area

51:41.968 --> 51:45.208
we have Buddha, Christ and Mahavira.

51:47.648 --> 51:50.248
and they had to do tapasya, tapaha.

51:50.728 --> 51:51.648
They did it.

51:51.848 --> 51:55.408
You don't have to do now, they have done for you.

52:00.168 --> 52:02.608
Now see I saw the musicians yesterday.

52:02.808 --> 52:05.207
In two three months they have learnt so much,

52:05.408 --> 52:08.408
otherwise formerly  all the musicians I knew.

52:08.608 --> 52:09.968
For Indian music

52:10.848 --> 52:12.568
had to really starve.

52:13.168 --> 52:15.408
For months together they had to practice

52:15.608 --> 52:19.328
years together, they had to bow to their guru.

52:19.528 --> 52:21.488
That is all over now.

52:23.928 --> 52:26.088
because of this Param Chaitanya

52:26.288 --> 52:28.088
and your power

52:29.328 --> 52:31.688
to be one with the Divine.

52:31.888 --> 52:35.488
This Divine power can transform you completely

52:35.688 --> 52:37.368
to such an extent

52:37.568 --> 52:39.448
that anything that you want to do,

52:39.648 --> 52:41.408
you can do it in two, three months.

52:43.368 --> 52:45.528
In Pune when they were singing

52:46.008 --> 52:48.608
'foreigners' as we call them with respect.

52:48.808 --> 52:52.048
In India 'foreigners' means respect , not like other countries.

52:53.448 --> 52:54.648
So they were singing.

52:54.848 --> 52:58.528
They were some very great musicians (who) had come.

52:59.168 --> 53:02.488
They told  Me,"Mother, we put down our head to them."

53:02.888 --> 53:04.728
Because how could these people

53:04.928 --> 53:09.328
who don't know a word about Indian music have learnt it so well

53:09.448 --> 53:12.808
and the pronunciation of these Marathi languages were difficult.

53:13.008 --> 53:14.928
But they are so good at it

53:15.128 --> 53:16.768
is very surprising.

53:18.448 --> 53:22.328
Now all this has happened in your presence,

53:23.768 --> 53:24.888
in your presence.

53:26.208 --> 53:28.855
It is nice here, you have balloons here.

53:29.088 --> 53:31.048
to celebrate Christ's birthday.

53:31.168 --> 53:34.448
and all these balloons of your ego should be burst,

53:35.048 --> 53:36.168
should be finished.

53:38.288 --> 53:44.608
(clapping)

53:50.088 --> 53:53.208
I will be happy if you could learn Hindi language.

53:54.288 --> 53:57.088
But I know My English may not be so good

53:57.208 --> 54:00.208
but best is to learn hindi,

54:01.208 --> 54:03.128
if possible.

54:03.328 --> 54:07.648
Because there are already fourteen languages in India

54:08.608 --> 54:11.208
and so many languages in another country.

54:12.208 --> 54:15.367
Every country has a different type of English language.

54:15.568 --> 54:17.168
If you go to America,

54:17.288 --> 54:20.568
I don't understand their English for at least two, three days.

54:20.688 --> 54:22.208
Because they go on

54:22.408 --> 54:23.848
taking their

54:24.048 --> 54:25.848
....tongue

54:26.328 --> 54:29.808
and lips on one side, then on another side.

54:35.808 --> 54:38.968
English of the French is another point.

54:39.168 --> 54:41.248
So best is to learn Hindi.

54:41.448 --> 54:45.928
and that too a good Hindi, not Sanskritized.

54:46.048 --> 54:49.648
But as they say (Rozmara) i.e., day- to- day- Hindi because

54:50.008 --> 54:53.208
I feel better if you understand what I am saying.

54:53.328 --> 54:55.688
It is not difficult because you are all sahajyogis.

54:55.808 --> 54:58.968
You can learn Hindi in no time. I am not saying you learn Sanskrit.

54:59.088 --> 55:00.328
But Hindi is very easy.

55:00.448 --> 55:02.288
Try to. It is not My Mother tongue.

55:02.488 --> 55:04.968
I have never studied Hindi language, never.

55:05.408 --> 55:08.928
But you see it is a very easy language to learn.

55:09.688 --> 55:14.448
But as My father told Me ,"Never teach Hindi language

55:14.888 --> 55:16.368
to an English man."

55:19.008 --> 55:20.768
I said," Why this advise ?"

55:21.248 --> 55:23.727
He said," There was an English man who was after me

55:23.928 --> 55:26.074
that i should teach him Hindi."

55:26.688 --> 55:30.608
so he said," I have to tell my servant to open the door

55:32.208 --> 55:33.608
or to close the door.''

55:35.448 --> 55:38.168
So for open the door he said you say

55:38.928 --> 55:44.208
'there was a cool day', means 'Darwaza khol de'

55:49.448 --> 55:50.876
(clapping)

55:57.688 --> 56:01.968
And for closing the door, you have to say, 'There was a banker'

56:03.808 --> 56:07.288
"Maine darwaza bandh kar dey" (means close the door)

56:09.648 --> 56:11.328
But now it is different.

56:13.008 --> 56:15.888
They will pick up Hindi very quickly.

56:17.208 --> 56:18.928
Very quickly, I can see that.

56:19.128 --> 56:24.048
If you can learn this horrible Indian classical music

56:24.208 --> 56:27.968
which is so difficult, so easily, what will happen ?

56:28.848 --> 56:32.568
They can learn Hindi in no time and make Me happier every time.

56:32.768 --> 56:35.687
Not because Hindi is My language- It is not, it is Marathi.

56:35.888 --> 56:37.208
Marathi is very difficult.

56:37.328 --> 56:40.648
I don't think you can learn Marathi. It is very precise.

56:40.768 --> 56:43.035
I think that is one of the best languages

56:43.236 --> 56:45.528
to put down your ego.

56:47.399 --> 56:50.247
That is why Maharashtrians are normally not egoistical,

56:50.448 --> 56:53.768
because in their language it is built in process.

56:54.328 --> 56:56.688
For example somebody is boasting,

56:58.728 --> 57:00.968
that I have done this, I have done that.

57:01.288 --> 57:06.008
So in Marathi they will say, " Don't climb on a bush."

57:06.248 --> 57:11.208
or what we call the tree of channa which is so big as that.

57:13.048 --> 57:14.727
Then the person is finished.

57:14.928 --> 57:17.368
Like that there are many words by which

57:17.568 --> 57:20.648
you can put down the ego of the man on his face.

57:20.808 --> 57:24.208
So Marathi language has so many advantages.

57:24.448 --> 57:28.527
but I would not ask you to learn Marathi language. It is not so easy.

57:28.728 --> 57:33.008
But Hindi you should. It is very easy, very easy.

57:33.208 --> 57:37.248
but you must know one  thing that in Hindi language

57:38.048 --> 57:39.048
there is 'Adab'.

57:39.528 --> 57:43.328
'Adab' means modesty

57:43.528 --> 57:49.248
and respect

57:49.888 --> 57:54.568
respect, but more than respect it is a style of saying.

57:55.648 --> 57:59.248
Not ' Urdu ' but Hindi of day - to- day talking

57:59.568 --> 58:03.168
there is respect and a way to address others,

58:04.928 --> 58:06.248
to address others.

58:06.448 --> 58:07.368
All this

58:08.448 --> 58:09.568
will give you

58:10.488 --> 58:14.088
a kind of a more

58:15.488 --> 58:17.368
flexible vehichle

58:18.648 --> 58:20.288
to express your love.

58:21.488 --> 58:25.408
Because in Hindi language we can never translate 'I hate you'.

58:25.528 --> 58:26.688
We never say like that.

58:27.568 --> 58:28.568
I hate you.

58:29.368 --> 58:32.008
'I hate you' will anybody say like that ?

58:33.848 --> 58:35.128
We cannot say.

58:35.328 --> 58:37.568
To hate somebody is sinful.

58:38.968 --> 58:40.960
So they can never say,'I hate you.'

58:46.168 --> 58:48.568
Chastity is more in Marathi language

58:48.688 --> 58:49.928
but it is a little hard

58:50.088 --> 58:52.968
because it has got such as I told you

58:53.688 --> 58:58.488
......idioms which can correct you just there.

59:00.368 --> 59:06.608
All this is just to request now if you can learn this music,

59:07.608 --> 59:09.048
which is very difficult.

59:09.568 --> 59:12.448
You can always learn a simple Hindi language

59:13.208 --> 59:17.408
which is very very easy and very very easy to talk.

59:25.568 --> 59:29.488
There are so many things , I would like you to know about Christ

59:30.008 --> 59:31.008
But this is

59:31.808 --> 59:34.168
short time in which I cannot tell you.

59:36.008 --> 59:39.048
The way He had His own priorities.

59:43.608 --> 59:46.768
Though in the Bible He is not described fully, I should say

59:46.888 --> 59:50.768
and whatever it might have been they have reduced it.

59:51.608 --> 59:52.607
Maybe,

59:52.808 --> 59:55.928
and the way they practice Christianity is shocking.

59:56.608 --> 01:00:02.888
So one has to learn Christianity through the heart.

01:00:03.328 --> 01:00:04.328
No other way out.

01:00:06.008 --> 01:00:10.448
They should learn through the Heart, Heart of your Mother.

01:00:12.168 --> 01:00:13.528
May God bless you !
