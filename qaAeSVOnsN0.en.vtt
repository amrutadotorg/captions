00:00:29.354 --> 00:00:42.684
Today, we are here to celebrate the birthday of Shri Jesus Christ.

00:00:43.632 --> 00:00:52.859
Jesus Christ's life was very short and He spent most of His time in India, in Kashmir.

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:02.795
He went back just for last three years

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.328
and people fixed Him to a cross.

00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:17.168
It was somewhat destined.

00:01:20.928 --> 00:01:23.008
To open Agnya chakra

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.168
He had to offer this sacrifice.

00:01:26.768 --> 00:01:28.488
So in this way He

00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:32.608
set up Agnya chakra.

00:01:35.168 --> 00:01:36.568
Agnya chakra is very

00:01:39.408 --> 00:01:41.008
constricted

00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:42.968
small

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:47.808
and not easily openable,

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.168
because a human being

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:54.008
got freedom

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:57.528
that made him egoistic.

00:01:59.768 --> 00:02:01.288
This ego

00:02:01.848 --> 00:02:04.488
constricted his Agnya chakra.

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:09.807
And from that

00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:12.861
constricted Agnya chakra

00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:15.790
it was necessary to take out ego.

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:20.008
And to take out ego

00:02:21.448 --> 00:02:24.568
you have to control your (MAAN).

00:02:26.288 --> 00:02:28.968
But you do not take out your ego from your (MAAN).

00:02:30.648 --> 00:02:35.008
As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your (MAAN)

00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:40.768
the (MAAN) will go on increasing

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:43.208
and the ego will go on increasing

00:02:44.448 --> 00:02:46.208
[ AHAAM  KAROTI  SAHA  AHAMKAR ]

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:48.408
We do !

00:02:49.168 --> 00:02:53.448
It means that if we try to minimise our ego

00:02:55.648 --> 00:02:57.728
the ego will shoot up because

00:02:57.928 --> 00:03:00.568
we will try to do so with the help of ego only.

00:03:04.288 --> 00:03:05.968
Those who think

00:03:06.488 --> 00:03:08.008
that to our ego

00:03:09.968 --> 00:03:11.088
will suppress

00:03:12.368 --> 00:03:13.768
will eat less food

00:03:15.848 --> 00:03:17.248
worldwide violence

00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:19.048
one

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.968
standing on one foot and some on their head.

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:26.288
Every type of

00:03:26.608 --> 00:03:27.688
experiment

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:33.208
people do to destroy their ego

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:37.248
But it does not supress the ego.

00:03:37.848 --> 00:03:39.168
It shoots up.

00:03:40.088 --> 00:03:43.328
To fast, to do (JAP TAP)

00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:46.448
everything

00:03:47.408 --> 00:03:48.488
shoots up ego !

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:50.768
[Havana] also gives rise to ego !

00:03:51.768 --> 00:03:54.848
Because Agni is right sided.

00:03:58.448 --> 00:04:00.048
Whatever

00:04:02.968 --> 00:04:07.768
karmakand we do, rituals  we perform gives rise to our ego.

00:04:16.328 --> 00:04:18.608
For the past thousands of years human beings

00:04:18.728 --> 00:04:21.248
have been doing the same type of karmakand.

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:27.688
Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing.

00:04:32.408 --> 00:04:35.448
This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand.

00:04:37.448 --> 00:04:39.688
There is no need to do any karmakand.

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:47.728
And to go to the extremes is all the more bad.

00:04:49.568 --> 00:04:50.648
As I said

00:04:51.288 --> 00:04:53.248
that to take away your ego

00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:57.368
you, in Marathi is called (JODE PATTI ) beat 'it' with shoes.

00:04:58.488 --> 00:05:01.528
So daily in the morning Sahajyogis

00:05:01.648 --> 00:05:04.888
move out in a line with shoes in their hands.

00:05:06.328 --> 00:05:09.168
O.k ! but if you have ego, then only

00:05:10.128 --> 00:05:12.888
Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand.

00:05:14.368 --> 00:05:15.368
All this

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:19.408
karmakand  penetrated into Sahajyoga too.

00:05:21.328 --> 00:05:26.288
So much so, that from France a gentleman came

00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:30.648
from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there.

00:05:31.768 --> 00:05:34.008
It is for sick people.

00:05:34.408 --> 00:05:38.608
If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand

00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:42.368
The karmakand of cancer are written in that.

00:05:44.408 --> 00:05:46.768
I said it is human being's nature

00:05:47.488 --> 00:05:51.808
to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it

00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:57.643
because of my karmakand, work will be done

00:05:59.088 --> 00:06:01.087
and in this karmakand

00:06:01.288 --> 00:06:02.941
not only you

00:06:03.488 --> 00:06:05.135
in foreign country also

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:09.279
many people go on doing karmakand of various types.

00:06:11.088 --> 00:06:12.168
For example

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:15.448
will go to church once a year.

00:06:17.488 --> 00:06:18.568
Means today.

00:06:19.688 --> 00:06:22.368
After that they don't take even the name of God.

00:06:22.488 --> 00:06:24.808
After doing all the dirty jobs of world

00:06:25.088 --> 00:06:28.448
and go to Catholic  ( DHARAM) and make confession

00:06:30.408 --> 00:06:34.728
If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi.

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:38.928
If you can understand that this wrong act

00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:41.608
What we have done is wrong

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:44.408
and now onwards this act is not to be done.

00:06:45.168 --> 00:06:47.128
If you can understand this

00:06:47.848 --> 00:06:50.608
your brain will retain it

00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:54.248
Now,

00:06:55.088 --> 00:06:58.408
Karmakandis have got all the more qualities.

00:06:59.928 --> 00:07:03.768
One thing is that they are misers number one.

00:07:06.328 --> 00:07:08.408
If you talk to them about ten rupees

00:07:08.608 --> 00:07:11.168
they start jumping into the sky.

00:07:13.488 --> 00:07:15.928
That is called in Marathi, 'KODI CHUMBAK'

00:07:17.688 --> 00:07:20.248
One thing is that in Marathi there are such words

00:07:20.568 --> 00:07:22.648
That your ego will dissolve easily.

00:07:27.008 --> 00:07:28.328
For example somebody

00:07:28.528 --> 00:07:32.168
talked high of himself, i did this, i did that

00:07:33.608 --> 00:07:35.568
tell him in a low voice

00:07:37.888 --> 00:07:40.207
'You are climbing a chickpea tree'.

00:07:40.408 --> 00:07:42.308
A chickpea tree doesn't exist !

00:07:43.288 --> 00:07:46.208
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

00:07:46.688 --> 00:07:48.448
So he cools down.

00:07:49.128 --> 00:07:52.168
I did this, i did that, i

00:07:52.848 --> 00:07:55.208
Till this 'I' ness doesn't go

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:59.168
till then our recognising Christ is wrong.

00:08:00.408 --> 00:08:02.088
But it is surprising

00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:05.888
that what is called ' Christian Nations' where there is christanity

00:08:06.288 --> 00:08:08.808
more than them egoistic I have not seen

00:08:09.808 --> 00:08:11.208
particularly English.

00:08:11.568 --> 00:08:12.568
American

00:08:13.008 --> 00:08:14.008
everybody

00:08:14.448 --> 00:08:16.688
is so much egoistic

00:08:17.128 --> 00:08:20.368
that can't understand these desciples of Christ.

00:08:22.288 --> 00:08:24.319
Now what is the remedy of this ego?

00:08:25.928 --> 00:08:27.272
that should be thought

00:08:28.248 --> 00:08:30.927
It's remedy was Jesus Christ

00:08:31.128 --> 00:08:33.168
and He has taught

00:08:33.368 --> 00:08:34.848
that now

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:38.408
love everybody

00:08:40.928 --> 00:08:42.688
love your enemies too.

00:08:44.568 --> 00:08:47.128
It's remedy He said was 'Love'.

00:08:50.448 --> 00:08:52.448
and apart from 'Love'

00:08:53.048 --> 00:08:54.128
there is no remedy.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.568
But this 'Love'

00:09:00.288 --> 00:09:02.888
is the 'Love' of Param Chaitanya.

00:09:04.848 --> 00:09:08.968
He said clearly,'Seek yourself'.

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:14.088
knock the door and the door will open !

00:09:16.448 --> 00:09:19.848
It doesn't mean that you go and knock the door.

00:09:21.488 --> 00:09:25.808
It means open the doors of your heart.

00:09:26.888 --> 00:09:29.008
A peson whose heart is small

00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:31.448
those who are misers

00:09:33.408 --> 00:09:36.848
that person can never be a Sahajyogi.

00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:45.088
And another thing which is very important

00:09:46.088 --> 00:09:48.528
if you get angry

00:09:49.728 --> 00:09:52.448
it means that you have too much ego.

00:09:55.968 --> 00:09:59.248
I have seen absolutely angry volatile people

00:10:01.488 --> 00:10:05.728
And they feel elated saying,'I am a very angry person'.

00:10:06.848 --> 00:10:08.808
Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga.

00:10:12.008 --> 00:10:16.888
Those who know to 'Love' and that too 'Pure Love'

00:10:18.568 --> 00:10:22.848
and that too such 'Love' where there is no expectation

00:10:23.488 --> 00:10:24.568
no desire

00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:28.808
those who completely know to love selflessly

00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:31.488
only they can be in Sahajyoga.

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:36.088
Egoistic people do wrong acts.

00:10:36.808 --> 00:10:38.208
I am tired of them.

00:10:42.088 --> 00:10:44.484
They will start something on their own

00:10:46.168 --> 00:10:48.088
and they won't even tell me.

00:10:50.288 --> 00:10:51.888
and by doing so

00:10:52.288 --> 00:10:55.448
Today thousands of questions have risen

00:10:57.488 --> 00:10:59.928
Today it is worth saying that in Delhi

00:11:01.088 --> 00:11:03.008
once they

00:11:03.928 --> 00:11:06.808
on the day of some puja hurriedly told me

00:11:07.088 --> 00:11:09.727
that we are getting land only this much.

00:11:09.928 --> 00:11:11.488
How much did we charge ?

00:11:11.688 --> 00:11:16.008
How is that going to be ? How is the land ? Nothing !

00:11:16.328 --> 00:11:18.328
And no Sahajyogi told me.

00:11:20.328 --> 00:11:23.808
Because if tomorrow somebody says, 'Mataji has said so'

00:11:23.928 --> 00:11:26.408
leave that person.

00:11:28.968 --> 00:11:31.648
If I have to say something, I will tell myself.

00:11:32.488 --> 00:11:35.768
After that we had so many meetings, I didn't say anything.

00:11:35.928 --> 00:11:38.328
Now those who have given them money

00:11:39.088 --> 00:11:40.968
are holding their heads

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:44.488
that they have been cheated !

00:11:45.368 --> 00:11:47.528
How to get back that money ?

00:11:47.928 --> 00:11:50.248
Without asking Me all the work

00:11:52.488 --> 00:11:54.328
Absolutely without asking Me.

00:11:54.488 --> 00:11:58.168
The land is so bad that they have received a notice

00:11:58.288 --> 00:12:02.608
that you cannot construct anything here. On the contrary you will be arrested

00:12:06.888 --> 00:12:10.168
Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me

00:12:11.448 --> 00:12:12.528
and ask Me

00:12:13.328 --> 00:12:15.368
they made a society of their own

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:16.808
and became mad

00:12:17.328 --> 00:12:19.328
that they are getting land

00:12:20.168 --> 00:12:21.688
It is such a bad land

00:12:23.368 --> 00:12:26.088
It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken

00:12:26.928 --> 00:12:30.688
Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ?

00:12:35.488 --> 00:12:38.048
Now whatever has happened is foolishness !

00:12:38.288 --> 00:12:40.088
and for that I am not responsible.

00:12:41.968 --> 00:12:44.288
But you ask for your money back.

00:12:46.128 --> 00:12:48.088
It is none of My resposibility.

00:12:53.808 --> 00:12:56.008
Jesus Christ had said that

00:12:59.168 --> 00:13:00.368
those people

00:13:06.008 --> 00:13:07.608
make houses

00:13:08.848 --> 00:13:09.848
live in houses

00:13:10.568 --> 00:13:12.408
they should watch birds

00:13:14.888 --> 00:13:16.368
he makes his own (GHARONDA)

00:13:16.488 --> 00:13:21.208
with how much love they make a small one for their ownself

00:13:24.848 --> 00:13:27.048
and when they make their home

00:13:27.448 --> 00:13:30.848
they feel a great joy in constructing that home.

00:13:35.128 --> 00:13:38.168
He explained it in every way

00:13:38.368 --> 00:13:40.928
that you give up attatchment.

00:13:41.928 --> 00:13:42.808
This is my house.

00:13:44.088 --> 00:13:45.208
This is my land.

00:13:46.288 --> 00:13:47.648
They are my children.

00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:51.597
Even this much that it is my country.

00:13:53.848 --> 00:13:56.728
This attatchment should be given up.

00:13:57.088 --> 00:14:01.008
Then only you can be great.

00:14:04.128 --> 00:14:06.408
In the whole world you are

00:14:06.608 --> 00:14:08.128
brothers and sisters.

00:14:08.968 --> 00:14:12.688
It doesn't mean that you give up devotion to your country.

00:14:12.888 --> 00:14:13.968
Not at all !

00:14:14.088 --> 00:14:18.088
If you are not devoted to your country you can't do anything.

00:14:19.248 --> 00:14:22.200
Within you there should be devotion to country.

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:26.967
But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world.

00:14:27.168 --> 00:14:29.208
If there is no devotion to one's country

00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:32.448
if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ?

00:14:33.688 --> 00:14:38.448
first of all whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all.

00:14:38.568 --> 00:14:41.327
If you are working  against your country

00:14:41.528 --> 00:14:43.368
you are not devoted to it.

00:14:43.808 --> 00:14:44.888
Jesus Christ

00:14:45.408 --> 00:14:47.808
had no need to go back.

00:14:48.648 --> 00:14:50.048
He had said also

00:14:50.528 --> 00:14:52.728
That there live such people

00:14:53.168 --> 00:14:55.808
Those who have the desire of only (MAL) are (MALECH)

00:14:57.128 --> 00:15:00.528
But Shalivahana told Him, 'No ! No 1 you go'.

00:15:00.728 --> 00:15:03.408
' And teach them (NIRMAL TATTWAM) the principle of purity.

00:15:05.688 --> 00:15:09.568
He went there to teach 'Nirmal Tatwam' and they put an end to His life.

00:15:10.888 --> 00:15:12.688
It is mad people's country.

00:15:14.048 --> 00:15:15.728
He didn't need to learn anything.

00:15:16.768 --> 00:15:18.288
But had to teach something.

00:15:18.488 --> 00:15:20.208
That is why He went there.

00:15:20.608 --> 00:15:22.208
and for the same reason

00:15:24.528 --> 00:15:26.288
His end was this way.

00:15:27.328 --> 00:15:29.008
But 'Wiseness' and 'Forgiveness'

00:15:30.648 --> 00:15:34.368
'Forgiveness' is the only mantra which can open Agnya chakra.

00:15:34.608 --> 00:15:37.648
If against anyone you have

00:15:40.248 --> 00:15:42.968
any ill feeling

00:15:43.728 --> 00:15:45.488
against anyone

00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:47.088
anger

00:15:48.168 --> 00:15:49.088
or

00:15:49.928 --> 00:15:54.128
if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone

00:15:54.408 --> 00:15:56.328
your Agnya cannot be up to the mark.

00:15:58.408 --> 00:16:00.008
Whatever you have to do

00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:01.728
you have to do with love.

00:16:03.328 --> 00:16:06.968
Even if you have to say something to anyone you have to say

00:16:07.088 --> 00:16:09.648
so that his life becomes 'NIRMAL'.

00:16:10.528 --> 00:16:13.368
It doesn't mean that you spoil your children.

00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:15.568
To children

00:16:15.768 --> 00:16:18.008
you have to perfectly

00:16:21.448 --> 00:16:22.928
discipline

00:16:23.968 --> 00:16:26.608
If you cannot discipline children

00:16:26.888 --> 00:16:29.528
your children can never be good Sahajyogis.

00:16:31.888 --> 00:16:35.048
And for that you must be yourself disciplined.

00:16:37.488 --> 00:16:41.728
If you are not disciplined yourself you cannot discipline your children.

00:16:42.688 --> 00:16:47.408
About Jesus Christ's life very little was written.

00:16:47.848 --> 00:16:50.728
But He was so disciplined

00:16:51.848 --> 00:16:53.168
In this way

00:16:54.408 --> 00:16:55.488
tolerated

00:16:57.328 --> 00:16:59.048
and from His life He showed

00:17:00.128 --> 00:17:02.408
He didn't need to be married

00:17:03.928 --> 00:17:05.368
He didn't marry

00:17:05.728 --> 00:17:08.728
It doesn't mean that He was against marriage.

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:13.048
People have such wrong notions

00:17:14.528 --> 00:17:15.728
And that is why

00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:20.088
they have self made notions

00:17:20.288 --> 00:17:23.808
the women who are called 'NUNS' were married to Jesus Christ

00:17:23.968 --> 00:17:25.288
He was Sakhshat Ganesha !

00:17:26.048 --> 00:17:27.808
How can anyone be married to Him ?

00:17:29.608 --> 00:17:30.688
Apart from that

00:17:31.488 --> 00:17:34.128
Men also no to marry

00:17:34.768 --> 00:17:37.808
such unnatural/ uncultural  concepts were taught.

00:17:38.968 --> 00:17:43.768
With that everyone can be kept under control

00:17:44.008 --> 00:17:47.008
but one cannot become Christian.

00:17:51.008 --> 00:17:52.048
like such

00:17:53.648 --> 00:17:55.648
[KRITRIM BANDHAN]

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.448
to cover oneself

00:17:58.648 --> 00:18:01.408
today Chritian religion is losing its importance.

00:18:01.888 --> 00:18:03.368
They forgot Jesus !

00:18:04.088 --> 00:18:06.528
and created a religion out of their own

00:18:06.928 --> 00:18:08.928
and call it Christian religion.

00:18:20.488 --> 00:18:22.328
The Christian religion of today

00:18:23.088 --> 00:18:26.048
Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus !

00:18:27.088 --> 00:18:29.328
Because I was born in this religion

00:18:29.528 --> 00:18:32.328
I saw the ins and outs of this religion.

00:18:35.368 --> 00:18:38.088
The same is the case with Hindu religion.

00:18:39.408 --> 00:18:43.208
In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all.

00:18:45.208 --> 00:18:50.008
Because your various gurus, real gurus

00:18:50.208 --> 00:18:54.528
like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies

00:18:55.048 --> 00:18:58.968
are your many incarnations

00:18:59.168 --> 00:19:02.288
and your Sayambus are many.

00:19:04.728 --> 00:19:08.408
You don't have one book. You have number of books.

00:19:08.768 --> 00:19:11.448
Only Jesus and Bible

00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:15.888
They can be fundamentalists.

00:19:16.488 --> 00:19:19.568
And they can be Yahudis also

00:19:21.728 --> 00:19:24.528
And all the three are related to each other.

00:19:25.168 --> 00:19:26.848
It is written in books.

00:19:27.488 --> 00:19:30.328
But a Hindu can never be communal.

00:19:31.168 --> 00:19:34.808
Because some have some guru and others a different guru.

00:19:35.808 --> 00:19:37.648
Some adore Mahalaxmi.

00:19:38.568 --> 00:19:40.408
Others  Renuka Devi.

00:19:41.368 --> 00:19:43.128
Some to Krishna.

00:19:46.248 --> 00:19:48.408
So, every person

00:19:50.048 --> 00:19:55.368
every family individually

00:19:58.648 --> 00:20:00.768
adore incarnation, books.

00:20:03.128 --> 00:20:05.408
As such there is no book

00:20:05.608 --> 00:20:08.688
which can be called as Holy Bible.

00:20:10.368 --> 00:20:12.408
So to all the religions

00:20:13.248 --> 00:20:18.368
a Hindu should pay respect.

00:20:19.248 --> 00:20:20.248
I have noticed

00:20:21.048 --> 00:20:24.008
The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus.

00:20:25.648 --> 00:20:28.448
Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible.

00:20:30.648 --> 00:20:34.288
They keep a Bible (IN THE ROOM) whether somebody reads or not.

00:20:34.448 --> 00:20:36.448
That Bible fell on the floor.

00:20:36.968 --> 00:20:40.608
There was one Hindu with us.

00:20:41.168 --> 00:20:46.568
He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table.

00:20:48.688 --> 00:20:51.128
They will never touch The Bible with their feet.

00:20:52.728 --> 00:20:54.808
The Christians will do so.

00:20:56.208 --> 00:20:57.808
A Hindu will never do so.

00:20:57.928 --> 00:21:01.408
To respect everybody is Hindu's Dharma.

00:21:02.248 --> 00:21:07.968
But those who have come out of it are very very strange.

00:21:09.928 --> 00:21:12.288
Those who are our politicians

00:21:12.488 --> 00:21:14.568
such people have taken birth.

00:21:15.928 --> 00:21:17.728
As mushrooms come out in monsoon

00:21:17.928 --> 00:21:19.608
same way some people have come out.

00:21:20.368 --> 00:21:22.088
But they are not Hindus.

00:21:25.408 --> 00:21:28.488
They don't know anything about their (DHARMA) religion.

00:21:29.168 --> 00:21:31.768
North Indians don't know it at all.

00:21:32.488 --> 00:21:33.568
And those

00:21:34.808 --> 00:21:36.488
who are South Indians

00:21:36.968 --> 00:21:39.088
they know that bramhins have to be given money

00:21:39.208 --> 00:21:42.088
here and there, have to do this and that (RITUALS).

00:21:42.208 --> 00:21:45.688
In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand.

00:21:46.408 --> 00:21:47.728
They are so karmakandi.

00:21:47.928 --> 00:21:49.768
In Maharashtra I have worked very hard.

00:21:50.088 --> 00:21:51.488
Everything was waste.

00:21:51.928 --> 00:21:54.248
Because they are very ritualistic  (KARMAKANDI).

00:21:54.368 --> 00:21:55.928
They cannot give it up.

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:58.408
Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak.

00:21:58.848 --> 00:22:01.928
The Ganeshji that is there, I have awakened that.

00:22:02.608 --> 00:22:06.848
Now what do I see that there one mile long

00:22:08.928 --> 00:22:11.568
long lines one mile long

00:22:12.888 --> 00:22:14.568
are standing on Tuesday.

00:22:15.968 --> 00:22:17.608
Gneshji too must have slept.

00:22:20.608 --> 00:22:24.968
The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra.

00:22:25.848 --> 00:22:29.208
Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot.

00:22:31.968 --> 00:22:33.528
And in North India also

00:22:34.328 --> 00:22:35.728
I have seen

00:22:35.928 --> 00:22:38.168
that some people are Karmakandi.

00:22:39.288 --> 00:22:41.328
And those who are Karmakandi

00:22:41.728 --> 00:22:44.328
they have lot of anger, are hot tempered.

00:22:46.368 --> 00:22:50.848
And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool.

00:22:52.008 --> 00:22:55.728
So the first thing is Stop ritualism

00:22:55.848 --> 00:22:58.008
but respect everything.

00:22:58.768 --> 00:23:01.568
Stopping ritualism doesn't mean to kick everything.

00:23:03.688 --> 00:23:08.128
This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ.

00:23:10.248 --> 00:23:13.448
Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open.

00:23:15.168 --> 00:23:19.248
Everbody's respect

00:23:19.448 --> 00:23:27.008
and unnecessary

00:23:27.208 --> 00:23:31.768
ritualism, in which wrong people are growing.

00:23:35.208 --> 00:23:38.968
Now a day's false gurus

00:23:39.408 --> 00:23:41.888
They exist because of ritualism (KARMAKAND).

00:23:44.248 --> 00:23:47.888
They will say you give so much money, do this do that.

00:23:48.088 --> 00:23:50.448
Do Havana

00:23:51.528 --> 00:23:56.368
108 times daily read these names, those names

00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:59.288
giving you mantras, doing this that.

00:23:59.448 --> 00:24:03.648
These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand.

00:24:03.928 --> 00:24:07.408
Completely against which is Jesus Christ.

00:24:15.928 --> 00:24:20.288
Which He knew that by doing Karmakand

00:24:21.928 --> 00:24:23.928
a human being becomes egoistic.

00:24:25.048 --> 00:24:27.408
and to crack this ego,

00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:30.688
To Karmakand, He

00:24:33.568 --> 00:24:35.288
had totally forbidden.

00:24:42.848 --> 00:24:46.888
The same way, in the name of God

00:24:47.888 --> 00:24:51.008
anyone earning money was objectionable to Him.

00:24:52.848 --> 00:24:54.768
On the contrary reverse process started.

00:24:55.648 --> 00:24:58.008
Earn money and consume.

00:25:00.168 --> 00:25:01.888
They don't give up earning

00:25:02.088 --> 00:25:04.408
but (believe to) earn money and consume.

00:25:06.408 --> 00:25:08.248
It doesn't solve any problem.

00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:12.208
Today in Sahajyoga work

00:25:12.488 --> 00:25:13.928
We should remember

00:25:14.688 --> 00:25:19.008
how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work.

00:25:20.408 --> 00:25:22.368
How much money did we give?

00:25:24.448 --> 00:25:27.568
Jesus Christ had twelve  fish killers.

00:25:28.728 --> 00:25:29.848
Even they

00:25:32.368 --> 00:25:34.848
spread in the  whole world by working hard.

00:25:35.688 --> 00:25:38.048
Today you are so many disciples of mine.

00:25:39.088 --> 00:25:40.688
And if you want

00:25:40.888 --> 00:25:43.648
you can give realisation to so many people.

00:25:45.768 --> 00:25:48.768
Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga.

00:25:49.408 --> 00:25:51.568
But the people should not be half baked.

00:25:52.008 --> 00:25:53.128
They should be deep.

00:25:54.368 --> 00:25:58.768
Unless they are deep, they cannot understand.

00:25:58.968 --> 00:26:02.728
And for that the greatest thing is

00:26:03.848 --> 00:26:05.928
that how much we love them.

00:26:06.728 --> 00:26:09.808
And how much love they give to others.

00:26:10.808 --> 00:26:12.848
Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga

00:26:13.048 --> 00:26:14.928
he should remember first of all

00:26:15.048 --> 00:26:19.808
that the teaching of Jesus Christ is to love everybody.

00:26:20.528 --> 00:26:22.408
Am i doing that ?

00:26:23.928 --> 00:26:25.728
I shower my anger over everyone.

00:26:26.408 --> 00:26:28.528
I keep everybody under control

00:26:31.568 --> 00:26:33.608
I express my anger with my eyes.

00:26:35.568 --> 00:26:37.008
This ego is

00:26:37.208 --> 00:26:38.528
very much

00:26:40.888 --> 00:26:42.808
not only against  Sahajyoga

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:44.928
but his destructor

00:26:46.328 --> 00:26:48.208
Whosoever is egoistic

00:26:48.608 --> 00:26:53.168
should lessen it and replace it with love

00:26:53.728 --> 00:26:56.128
Life will be  a pleasure.

00:26:57.088 --> 00:26:58.648
Life will be beautiful !

00:26:59.808 --> 00:27:01.648
If you don't know how to love

00:27:01.848 --> 00:27:04.248
then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga.

00:27:04.368 --> 00:27:07.088
First you open the doors of your heart.

00:27:09.648 --> 00:27:14.148
With that only With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread.

00:27:15.368 --> 00:27:17.807
The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga

00:27:18.008 --> 00:27:21.568
they have the Shakti of love less and the Shakti of anger more.

00:27:21.688 --> 00:27:23.005
It will never spread.

00:27:25.008 --> 00:27:29.328
With love it will spread And with anger it will minimise and diminish.

00:27:31.088 --> 00:27:36.328
The teaching of Jesus is necessary for us to understand.

00:27:38.888 --> 00:27:41.488
Sorry ! I had to talk in Hindi language

00:27:41.688 --> 00:27:44.568
because most of the people are here Indians

00:27:44.768 --> 00:27:46.968
Some of them are Marathis

00:27:47.168 --> 00:27:50.688
and others are from North India.

00:27:51.528 --> 00:27:54.648
I was telling them about Christ.

00:27:54.848 --> 00:27:56.848
What was His power ?

00:27:57.048 --> 00:27:59.528
His power was of 'Love'.

00:28:01.888 --> 00:28:04.848
And not of anger

00:28:07.208 --> 00:28:10.408
Because He is the one

00:28:10.608 --> 00:28:12.968
who has crossed

00:28:13.168 --> 00:28:18.728
the most difficult center of Agnya.

00:28:20.848 --> 00:28:22.888
Those people who have ego

00:28:24.248 --> 00:28:26.128
never realise they have ego

00:28:27.728 --> 00:28:28.928
With their ego they do

00:28:29.128 --> 00:28:31.568
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:33.448
Without asking Me

00:28:33.648 --> 00:28:36.128
they have done something in Delhi.

00:28:36.888 --> 00:28:37.808
Without asking me

00:28:38.008 --> 00:28:39.928
they have done something in Russia.

00:28:40.488 --> 00:28:42.848
And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga.

00:28:43.968 --> 00:28:45.448
that they don't realise

00:28:46.408 --> 00:28:48.408
what they have done is the crime

00:28:48.608 --> 00:28:52.008
which is punishable by all Divine laws.

00:28:56.528 --> 00:28:59.008
If you want to do anything you must

00:28:59.528 --> 00:29:01.008
tell me beforehand.

00:29:01.968 --> 00:29:03.488
You must consult Me

00:29:03.688 --> 00:29:05.168
you must talk to Me

00:29:05.288 --> 00:29:08.448
Because I know what is happening.

00:29:09.048 --> 00:29:12.568
You don't know if somebody wants to cheat you.

00:29:14.288 --> 00:29:17.808
Then how will you know if you were

00:29:18.848 --> 00:29:20.968
so sensitive you would find out

00:29:23.848 --> 00:29:25.368
You would have asked Me,

00:29:25.568 --> 00:29:27.568
'Mother what should we do ?'

00:29:29.248 --> 00:29:30.848
At least ask Me.

00:29:32.088 --> 00:29:35.168
This is the main thing missing among

00:29:35.888 --> 00:29:37.448
Sahajyogis now that

00:29:37.648 --> 00:29:40.848
we have a kind of a very subtle ego.

00:29:41.768 --> 00:29:43.408
If you make somebody a leader

00:29:43.728 --> 00:29:45.688
it is very dangerous sometimes.

00:29:45.808 --> 00:29:48.528
If the leader developes ego because of his wife,

00:29:49.848 --> 00:29:51.688
It is a very difficult thing.

00:29:51.808 --> 00:29:53.928
They can destroy Sahajyoga completely.

00:29:57.688 --> 00:29:59.088
Anything is possible.

00:30:00.528 --> 00:30:02.928
So before you do anything like that

00:30:03.248 --> 00:30:04.608
you have to consult (Me).

00:30:05.128 --> 00:30:06.288
I am still living

00:30:07.088 --> 00:30:07.968
and you can ask.

00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:11.688
You can write to Me, you can telephone too.

00:30:14.208 --> 00:30:15.848
At least I am there to tell you.

00:30:17.128 --> 00:30:19.168
But then you have to develop

00:30:19.488 --> 00:30:21.328
your balance and your love.

00:30:22.168 --> 00:30:25.208
That is only through this Param Chaitanya

00:30:25.848 --> 00:30:28.808
It is all pervading power of Divine Love.

00:30:29.328 --> 00:30:32.288
You can develop that discretion.

00:30:33.088 --> 00:30:33.888
special

00:30:34.368 --> 00:30:37.088
.....powers.

00:30:37.608 --> 00:30:39.608
Even if somebody telephones to Me

00:30:39.728 --> 00:30:42.688
immediately I know what is wrong with that person.

00:30:44.048 --> 00:30:46.288
I don't say that you can become like Me.

00:30:46.488 --> 00:30:49.768
But at least you have vibrations to see.

00:30:50.488 --> 00:30:52.608
Also see your own vibrations.

00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:54.928
How are you moving ?

00:30:55.688 --> 00:30:57.128
Put a paper on your hand

00:30:57.728 --> 00:31:00.968
and you will see it will start shaking before My photograph.

00:31:02.968 --> 00:31:04.048
With this ego

00:31:05.408 --> 00:31:06.648
you cannot go further

00:31:07.248 --> 00:31:08.808
Why did you come to sahajyoga ?

00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:11.728
You came here not to become

00:31:11.928 --> 00:31:13.008
some sort of a leader

00:31:13.488 --> 00:31:14.888
or some sort of a

00:31:16.648 --> 00:31:17.728
a king but

00:31:19.048 --> 00:31:20.648
you came here

00:31:21.008 --> 00:31:24.088
to become a great guru.

00:31:24.648 --> 00:31:26.928
As you ask Me Gurupad Dijiye.

00:31:28.528 --> 00:31:31.448
For that you have to have in Sahajyoga

00:31:31.768 --> 00:31:34.408
a complete humility

00:31:35.328 --> 00:31:37.008
natural humility

00:31:40.688 --> 00:31:42.368
natural balance.

00:31:42.888 --> 00:31:46.128
This is what Christ has taught us.

00:31:59.448 --> 00:32:00.568
At that time

00:32:03.488 --> 00:32:05.808
I don't think that people had that much ego.

00:32:06.848 --> 00:32:09.728
Ego is a modern present to you.

00:32:11.008 --> 00:32:13.128
People get ego out of anything.

00:32:15.408 --> 00:32:20.928
For example, I met one lady once and found her ego very bad.

00:32:21.448 --> 00:32:23.888
I said, ''What is the matter with her?''

00:32:24.168 --> 00:32:26.568
So, I asked My daughters ,''What does she do?''

00:32:26.848 --> 00:32:30.608
They said," Mummy She knows how to make dolls.''

00:32:31.528 --> 00:32:32.648
For that she had ego.

00:32:34.928 --> 00:32:35.808
What is so great

00:32:36.648 --> 00:32:38.168
than to be a good sahajyogi

00:32:38.568 --> 00:32:40.928
You may be the king, you may be anything.

00:32:41.088 --> 00:32:42.848
Now you see the Prime Ministers

00:32:43.048 --> 00:32:44.888
and all of them going to jail.

00:32:46.728 --> 00:32:48.528
What are they compared to you?

00:32:48.648 --> 00:32:49.848
They have no balance.

00:32:50.648 --> 00:32:51.768
They have no sense.

00:32:54.728 --> 00:32:56.928
What makes you a separate

00:32:58.288 --> 00:32:59.368
individuals

00:33:00.088 --> 00:33:01.928
higher people, because

00:33:02.928 --> 00:33:05.968
you have no ego.

00:33:09.488 --> 00:33:11.768
Now people try to remove their ego

00:33:13.248 --> 00:33:14.328
Their two types.....

00:33:16.008 --> 00:33:19.208
So they will go on beating themselves with shoes.

00:33:21.368 --> 00:33:25.048
All kinds of ritualistic things they do to remove their ego.

00:33:26.168 --> 00:33:28.448
But all this we do with our mind.

00:33:29.608 --> 00:33:32.688
Whatever you do with your mind will give you ego only.

00:33:36.048 --> 00:33:37.208
They become ascetic.

00:33:37.488 --> 00:33:39.768
They are the greatest egoist.

00:33:39.968 --> 00:33:43.048
I must say, Hitler was the greatest ascetic.

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:46.248
With his asceticism he became Hitler.

00:33:46.448 --> 00:33:49.528
If you want to become Hitler, you become ascetic.

00:33:50.368 --> 00:33:52.888
In Sahajyoga you are not allowed at all

00:33:53.328 --> 00:33:54.448
all this asceticism.

00:34:01.248 --> 00:34:03.288
You have to be loving

00:34:03.928 --> 00:34:05.008
affectionate

00:34:05.488 --> 00:34:07.568
kind and disciplined.

00:34:09.448 --> 00:34:12.528
I must say this because when you are loving

00:34:13.008 --> 00:34:15.928
you go out of bounds sometimes

00:34:16.408 --> 00:34:18.807
because you have no discipline of sahajyoga.

00:34:19.008 --> 00:34:24.848
Loving doesn't mean that you become like a

00:34:26.328 --> 00:34:28.048
Romeo, Juliet,doesn't mean that.

00:34:30.368 --> 00:34:33.928
You must have your balance through your discipline.

00:34:34.968 --> 00:34:36.768
If you have no discipline

00:34:36.888 --> 00:34:40.208
you can never be a good Sahajyogi.

00:34:43.888 --> 00:34:45.648
From the life of Christ

00:34:46.368 --> 00:34:47.488
we have to learn

00:34:48.208 --> 00:34:49.368
these things

00:34:49.568 --> 00:34:52.848
that unless and until we have these things

00:34:53.088 --> 00:34:55.128
we cannot

00:34:58.008 --> 00:34:59.408
become good Sahajyogis.

00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:02.568
Firstly, ritualistic nature

00:35:05.248 --> 00:35:06.768
secondly, anger

00:35:07.848 --> 00:35:09.888
thirdly, miserliness.

00:35:11.728 --> 00:35:13.888
like

00:35:14.368 --> 00:35:15.528
if you

00:35:16.768 --> 00:35:18.008
go to England

00:35:18.328 --> 00:35:19.408
it is written there

00:35:19.528 --> 00:35:21.968
'save pounds by taking a taxi'

00:35:26.648 --> 00:35:27.768
this is what it is.

00:35:28.328 --> 00:35:29.408
Miserliness

00:35:29.648 --> 00:35:31.768
where can we save money,

00:35:32.288 --> 00:35:35.487
'Mother, can you give concession?'

00:35:35.688 --> 00:35:39.488
it is not a some sort of a business I am doing here.

00:35:42.128 --> 00:35:45.608
'If you make it half price, so many will come'.

00:35:48.648 --> 00:35:50.568
''I am not using your money''.

00:35:50.968 --> 00:35:54.975
I am using it for your buildings, all this I have got it

00:35:55.728 --> 00:35:58.368
of course My money also and your money.

00:35:59.448 --> 00:36:00.928
So many things I have done

00:36:01.648 --> 00:36:03.128
The whole of Vashi

00:36:03.808 --> 00:36:05.528
the whole of Ashram

00:36:07.448 --> 00:36:08.928
In Delhi two ashrams,

00:36:09.368 --> 00:36:10.928
then the whole of school

00:36:11.888 --> 00:36:12.808
and also

00:36:13.488 --> 00:36:15.608
land in Pune and other places.

00:36:16.488 --> 00:36:18.248
Now in Pune they want Me

00:36:18.368 --> 00:36:20.848
to pay the land, to pay for everything

00:36:21.008 --> 00:36:23.688
and Pune people are the known Maharashtrians

00:36:23.808 --> 00:36:24.928
to be great

00:36:25.568 --> 00:36:27.568
miserly, kanjoos people.

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:32.408
Even for their own

00:36:33.048 --> 00:36:36.608
ashram, they would like Me to pay for everything.

00:36:37.448 --> 00:36:39.968
and they nicely go and sing bhajans nicely.

00:36:40.368 --> 00:36:43.408
See they are good musicians, that is what they are.

00:36:43.608 --> 00:36:46.008
Very very miserly people.

00:36:51.688 --> 00:36:53.608
Miserly people can never love.

00:36:53.728 --> 00:36:54.808
Tthey love money.

00:36:56.368 --> 00:36:58.568
Egoistical people can never love

00:36:58.688 --> 00:37:00.528
because they love power

00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:02.048
to control others.

00:37:05.768 --> 00:37:08.048
They think theey are doing for Sahajyoga.

00:37:08.648 --> 00:37:09.728
but not.

00:37:09.848 --> 00:37:13.448
Unless until you do something for yourself and ego

00:37:13.928 --> 00:37:15.888
no use working for Sahajyoga.

00:37:19.568 --> 00:37:20.728
Look at The Christ

00:37:21.528 --> 00:37:23.608
He took birth in a very humble

00:37:24.208 --> 00:37:25.328
abode.

00:37:27.088 --> 00:37:28.448
But He was the king.

00:37:30.488 --> 00:37:32.008
And He lived with the poor

00:37:35.928 --> 00:37:37.208
and tried to save them.

00:37:37.328 --> 00:37:38.528
He saved the lepers.

00:37:38.728 --> 00:37:40.728
He saved so many people, there were.

00:37:40.928 --> 00:37:44.928
Twenty one people were cured by Him.

00:37:45.128 --> 00:37:48.528
Now sahaj yoga I don't know, how many thousands have been cured.

00:37:52.728 --> 00:37:55.208
But what is important is if you are curing

00:37:55.568 --> 00:37:57.808
you know that you are not curing

00:37:57.928 --> 00:38:00.728
It is the Divine power that is curing.

00:38:03.008 --> 00:38:04.608
You are not doing anything

00:38:06.248 --> 00:38:07.928
It is best to be like that.

00:38:08.048 --> 00:38:10.368
I feel the same way that I am doing nothing

00:38:11.008 --> 00:38:12.128
and I am Nishkriya

00:38:12.968 --> 00:38:13.848
doing nothing.

00:38:15.128 --> 00:38:16.528
but I am not lazy.

00:38:20.328 --> 00:38:23.208
You should be active but all your activity

00:38:23.328 --> 00:38:26.768
should come from the Divine power of 'Love'

00:38:27.648 --> 00:38:30.688
First of all you must extend your hands for l'ove'.

00:38:31.488 --> 00:38:32.768
You extend your heart

00:38:32.888 --> 00:38:33.928
extend your money

00:38:34.048 --> 00:38:37.168
house, everything for 'Love'

00:38:39.328 --> 00:38:42.128
Now once your wife doesn't allow others to come in

00:38:42.248 --> 00:38:44.608
throw her out of the house, I don't mind.

00:38:47.528 --> 00:38:51.168
Teach her how to be kind and generous

00:38:51.328 --> 00:38:53.440
otherway round for the husband.

00:38:54.488 --> 00:38:55.835
It is very important

00:38:56.328 --> 00:39:01.088
you have to be generous. You have to be kind, you have to be loving

00:39:01.648 --> 00:39:03.236
and sweet to others.

00:39:04.568 --> 00:39:06.648
Christ only once went into temper

00:39:06.848 --> 00:39:08.608
which He had a right to do that

00:39:08.928 --> 00:39:10.048
when He saw people

00:39:10.408 --> 00:39:12.248
selling things in the temple.

00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:15.048
Samething we have here.

00:39:16.608 --> 00:39:20.568
And if you don't go and buy anything from them they will be lost.

00:39:22.248 --> 00:39:25.007
But you only go and buy things from them because

00:39:25.208 --> 00:39:27.087
you have a habit of shopping.

00:39:27.288 --> 00:39:30.128
Anywhere they people go, they must shop

00:39:30.888 --> 00:39:31.968
is a habit

00:39:33.248 --> 00:39:34.688
shopping they must do.

00:39:34.808 --> 00:39:36.568
They will not see the greenery

00:39:36.728 --> 00:39:38.528
the beauty of nature, nothing.

00:39:39.728 --> 00:39:43.368
When I went to so many countries,you see I had to

00:39:44.208 --> 00:39:45.568
with my husband

00:39:46.448 --> 00:39:48.408
I had to go

00:39:48.688 --> 00:39:51.568
and see beautiful places like museums.

00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:53.288
I never used to shop.

00:39:54.368 --> 00:39:58.047
But when I have so many children then I have to shop.

00:39:58.248 --> 00:39:59.954
So I would go for shops.

00:40:00.368 --> 00:40:02.168
But not the way that

00:40:02.288 --> 00:40:04.248
that every place is for shopping.

00:40:05.048 --> 00:40:06.568
What is there to shop here

00:40:06.848 --> 00:40:10.088
when you have come here for your spiritual growth.

00:40:11.768 --> 00:40:14.048
In Mecca, do they have any shops?

00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:19.848
This is the holier than holi.

00:40:21.088 --> 00:40:23.768
Why should go to the shops ? I can't understand.

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:26.648
I have told them not to have shops

00:40:26.848 --> 00:40:30.168
but you people are the ones, who encourage.

00:40:31.488 --> 00:40:34.288
who encouraged them to make money out of us ?

00:40:36.928 --> 00:40:38.928
Nothing essential to buy there.

00:40:40.208 --> 00:40:44.088
Now you have come to the holy occassion.

00:40:44.448 --> 00:40:47.968
Here you have come for your worship.

00:40:50.808 --> 00:40:53.048
In our Mahalaxmi temple

00:40:53.248 --> 00:40:55.488
there are people who are selling

00:40:55.688 --> 00:40:58.288
garlands and things for ladies' hair.

00:40:58.888 --> 00:41:01.168
But they say it is for the Goddess.

00:41:01.608 --> 00:41:02.728
And they buy there.

00:41:03.288 --> 00:41:05.608
All the people who are coming stupidly

00:41:06.328 --> 00:41:08.608
and give it

00:41:09.088 --> 00:41:11.008
to the brahmin in the temple

00:41:11.408 --> 00:41:13.448
and the Brahmin sells it back

00:41:14.248 --> 00:41:15.368
at a lower price.

00:41:16.048 --> 00:41:18.568
And these garlands are

00:41:19.048 --> 00:41:21.328
I don't know how many times sold and bought

00:41:21.448 --> 00:41:23.528
and sold and bought because of the

00:41:23.728 --> 00:41:25.928
stupidity of the people who go there.

00:41:26.968 --> 00:41:28.488
If they have to take something

00:41:28.688 --> 00:41:30.475
they should buy it from outside,

00:41:31.528 --> 00:41:33.448
not at the place where you have come.

00:41:39.528 --> 00:41:42.968
As it is you went to Delhi, you could have bought it there.

00:41:44.528 --> 00:41:46.088
or you came to Bombay

00:41:46.288 --> 00:41:48.968
you could have bought there but not in this place.

00:41:49.288 --> 00:41:52.648
We cannot make this place Bombay or Delhi

00:41:52.968 --> 00:41:55.048
otherwise why should we come here.

00:41:56.408 --> 00:41:58.208
That is why christ took a hunter

00:42:00.368 --> 00:42:04.608
and beat them those who were selling things near the church.

00:42:07.408 --> 00:42:08.488
Now they don't have

00:42:09.168 --> 00:42:11.768
I have seen, near the church they don't have.

00:42:11.968 --> 00:42:13.328
They have outside.

00:42:15.928 --> 00:42:17.528
But they sell other things

00:42:18.088 --> 00:42:21.048
like catholic church sells

00:42:21.688 --> 00:42:24.168
a wine called Benedictine.

00:42:24.288 --> 00:42:25.368
Imagine !

00:42:26.888 --> 00:42:28.008
That is another story.

00:42:29.848 --> 00:42:30.928
Christ went

00:42:34.728 --> 00:42:35.808
for wedding

00:42:37.808 --> 00:42:40.128
and they had no wine.

00:42:40.648 --> 00:42:42.248
Now in the Hibru language

00:42:42.488 --> 00:42:43.648
wine

00:42:43.848 --> 00:42:45.368
means

00:42:45.768 --> 00:42:48.208
the juice of the grapes.

00:42:48.408 --> 00:42:49.928
It doesn't mean fermented.

00:42:52.208 --> 00:42:55.008
So He converted water into black wine.

00:42:56.488 --> 00:42:57.768
You cannot convert

00:42:58.928 --> 00:43:01.568
water instatantaneously

00:43:01.968 --> 00:43:03.528
into wine.

00:43:03.728 --> 00:43:06.128
Wine has to rot , has to smell

00:43:06.248 --> 00:43:08.688
The more it smells, the best it is.

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:14.568
But they think that Christ said you must drink this thing.

00:43:17.248 --> 00:43:18.328
He never said that.

00:43:19.728 --> 00:43:23.568
He just converted it into wine.

00:43:23.928 --> 00:43:24.768
meaning

00:43:25.248 --> 00:43:26.008
the

00:43:26.208 --> 00:43:30.128
taste of the juice of grapes.

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:31.928
Once I went

00:43:32.848 --> 00:43:34.128
to some television

00:43:34.728 --> 00:43:37.808
and there was a very nice man in Italy.

00:43:38.008 --> 00:43:42.008
He said ,''Mother you first give me realisation''.

00:43:42.608 --> 00:43:45.208
So I said ,''Get some Water''. I put My hand into it.

00:43:45.728 --> 00:43:46.688
" Now you drink it".

00:43:47.008 --> 00:43:49.928
He said ,"It is tasting like wine".

00:43:50.328 --> 00:43:52.448
I said,"This is what Christ did".

00:43:53.408 --> 00:43:54.928
He got his realisation.

00:43:55.248 --> 00:43:58.168
Instantaneously, you cannot make wine.

00:43:59.488 --> 00:44:02.928
But if somebody dies, they will drink.

00:44:03.768 --> 00:44:05.968
If somebody is born, they will drink.

00:44:06.528 --> 00:44:09.848
At any cost, without drinking they are not normal.

00:44:16.048 --> 00:44:18.847
But the people who got realisation are suddenly changed.

00:44:19.048 --> 00:44:21.528
They don't want to drink. They have stopped drinking.

00:44:21.648 --> 00:44:23.527
Their attention has become nice.

00:44:23.728 --> 00:44:25.408
The whole thing is changed.

00:44:25.888 --> 00:44:28.168
This is the transformation that has worked

00:44:29.368 --> 00:44:32.128
of which Christ has talked, Mohammed sahib has talked

00:44:32.488 --> 00:44:35.408
everybody has talked about this particular time

00:44:35.608 --> 00:44:38.208
when people will get transformed.

00:44:38.568 --> 00:44:40.808
But even after transformation

00:44:41.208 --> 00:44:44.488
you do not want to become what you have to be

00:44:46.408 --> 00:44:48.414
for which you have come here.

00:44:49.928 --> 00:44:51.248
You will be left behind.

00:44:51.968 --> 00:44:53.055
It is a big

00:45:01.968 --> 00:45:04.071
transformation is taking place.

00:45:05.408 --> 00:45:08.864
In that transformation also your rising is taking place.

00:45:09.488 --> 00:45:12.208
There is a big evolution going on

00:45:12.608 --> 00:45:15.448
and those who will not evolve properly

00:45:15.648 --> 00:45:16.968
will be left behind.

00:45:20.768 --> 00:45:24.448
As it is said that, it is the last judgement.

00:45:26.328 --> 00:45:27.939
And you will be judged.

00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:29.928
You will be left behind.

00:45:30.968 --> 00:45:33.928
You cannot adhere to people who are rising higher.

00:45:34.848 --> 00:45:36.848
With your weight you will fall down.

00:45:38.928 --> 00:45:40.568
So for you

00:45:42.168 --> 00:45:43.528
to understand Christ

00:45:43.768 --> 00:45:46.608
is all these qualities you must have.

00:45:47.488 --> 00:45:51.528
If you are hot tempered , alright , go and beat yourself with shoes.

00:45:52.288 --> 00:45:54.768
But if you are not, then you need not.

00:45:56.048 --> 00:45:57.408
You must know what you are.

00:45:57.528 --> 00:45:58.968
First of all introspect.

00:45:59.088 --> 00:46:01.368
Accordingly you should work it out.

00:46:01.568 --> 00:46:05.328
But this ritualism is not allwed in Sahajyoga all the time.

00:46:22.808 --> 00:46:25.528
I would love all my children.

00:46:27.248 --> 00:46:30.248
To be extremely loving and collective.

00:46:31.928 --> 00:46:36.168
Not to denounce anybody for no rhyme and reason

00:46:36.528 --> 00:46:38.968
and if you have to denounce, you should tell Me.

00:46:39.288 --> 00:46:41.128
I know what is what !

00:46:41.808 --> 00:46:45.168
Without asking Me, you should not measure up somebody

00:46:45.288 --> 00:46:46.928
and say i have measured somebody.

00:46:47.048 --> 00:46:49.271
With what ? what is your yardstick ?

00:46:51.688 --> 00:46:55.688
You yourself you are caught up in the web of ego.

00:46:57.808 --> 00:47:01.128
You cannot condemn anyone without telling Me.

00:47:01.888 --> 00:47:03.287
You have to tell me.

00:47:03.488 --> 00:47:06.408
Don't worry that this thing will disturb Me or anything

00:47:06.608 --> 00:47:08.167
but you should ask.

00:47:08.368 --> 00:47:10.047
I know about everyone.

00:47:10.248 --> 00:47:13.848
May be I have not mat that person but i can feel the vibrations.

00:47:16.448 --> 00:47:17.848
You can write to me.

00:47:18.432 --> 00:47:21.247
Many people just telephone, that is not the way.

00:47:21.448 --> 00:47:25.168
You must write to Me because I read each and every letter.

00:47:25.728 --> 00:47:30.047
But all nonsensical letters you should not write also to waste my time.

00:47:30.248 --> 00:47:35.328
.....like my father's mother's, mother, this thing

00:47:35.528 --> 00:47:40.568
is sick or is dead and her bhoot is moving about.

00:47:44.048 --> 00:47:46.848
All sorts of funny letters come to Me.

00:47:47.049 --> 00:47:50.128
What can I do for such people ? That is not important.

00:47:50.248 --> 00:47:53.008
All: "I need money, I have no money.

00:47:53.208 --> 00:47:58.208
I am depending on you for money. So please send me money."

00:48:00.728 --> 00:48:02.888
You can ask on my photograph.

00:48:04.728 --> 00:48:08.648
If you are a good Sahajyogi, you don't have to worry for money also.

00:48:11.448 --> 00:48:15.808
Or i have no child ,Mother what to do? Mother i want to have a child.

00:48:15.928 --> 00:48:19.237
Those who have child, ask them what do else they have to say.

00:48:21.088 --> 00:48:24.648
So many have got children after coming to Sahajyoga

00:48:24.768 --> 00:48:26.688
but you must deserve it.

00:48:31.928 --> 00:48:35.488
So many miracles have taken place.

00:48:35.688 --> 00:48:39.088
So many people have been cured no doubt.

00:48:40.248 --> 00:48:42.608
But that doesn't mean that you have done it.

00:48:44.368 --> 00:48:48.368
Don't get into the trap of ego.

00:48:51.168 --> 00:48:53.288
That is most dangerous.

00:48:54.048 --> 00:48:58.048
If you destroy sahajyoga, you are destroying yourself.

00:49:03.448 --> 00:49:06.848
So, today you all have to promise in your heart.

00:49:08.008 --> 00:49:09.928
Put your hands to your heart

00:49:10.328 --> 00:49:11.248
and to say

00:49:12.288 --> 00:49:14.528
''Mother, We love,

00:49:15.968 --> 00:49:18.368
We spread your Divine Love,

00:49:19.008 --> 00:49:21.128
encompass the whole world,

00:49:21.648 --> 00:49:23.888
give realisation to all the people.

00:49:24.648 --> 00:49:25.728
Will not shout,

00:49:26.888 --> 00:49:28.248
will not be angry,

00:49:28.648 --> 00:49:34.488
will not do the all kinds of rituals but just surrender.

00:49:35.528 --> 00:49:37.008
Surrender our ego

00:49:37.728 --> 00:49:38.648
surrender ego

00:49:39.048 --> 00:49:40.568
surrender your ego.

00:49:40.808 --> 00:49:42.968
All your problems can be solved.

00:49:43.368 --> 00:49:45.288
because, as long as, there is ego

00:49:45.608 --> 00:49:47.888
this divine power doesn't take over.

00:49:48.608 --> 00:49:49.728
You may do anything

00:49:50.128 --> 00:49:52.808
You are not connected. Your connection is missing.

00:49:54.048 --> 00:49:56.368
Christ is missing. He is no more.

00:49:58.768 --> 00:50:03.648
To establish Him first of all you must show how you love.

00:50:03.968 --> 00:50:06.488
That doesn't mean that you love your wife,

00:50:06.608 --> 00:50:08.968
love your children and love your house.

00:50:10.608 --> 00:50:12.728
You have to love everyone.

00:50:14.168 --> 00:50:16.888
Try to make everyone happy.

00:50:18.088 --> 00:50:19.488
That is why I like music

00:50:19.608 --> 00:50:22.728
because through music you can spread vibrations.

00:50:23.968 --> 00:50:26.888
Very good media of spreading vibrations

00:50:27.888 --> 00:50:29.647
of loving vibrations.

00:50:29.848 --> 00:50:33.928
But those who are musicians have to be loving people,

00:50:35.928 --> 00:50:37.245
not hot tempered

00:50:38.848 --> 00:50:40.253
not showing off

00:50:42.008 --> 00:50:44.768
not thinking too much of themselves.

00:50:46.208 --> 00:50:47.608
All these will work

00:50:48.368 --> 00:50:50.408
very well if you understand

00:50:50.608 --> 00:50:53.608
that this Divine power

00:50:53.808 --> 00:50:55.728
is so powerful.

00:50:57.688 --> 00:50:58.808
No doubt it is love,

00:50:59.608 --> 00:51:02.008
no doubt it is truth,

00:51:02.928 --> 00:51:04.608
and no doubt

00:51:06.288 --> 00:51:10.208
if you get out of it, you will be caught up by anything

00:51:10.408 --> 00:51:12.408
and you could be finished.

00:51:14.728 --> 00:51:17.008
It is a very very

00:51:18.208 --> 00:51:23.288
powerful, effective and absolutely conclusive

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:26.768
power you have within yourself.

00:51:27.888 --> 00:51:30.688
And thanks to christ that crucified Himself

00:51:31.048 --> 00:51:33.448
sacrificed his body for our sake

00:51:33.728 --> 00:51:35.208
that our agnya is opened up.

00:51:35.408 --> 00:51:37.808
Otherwise I could not have done this Sahajyoga.

00:51:40.128 --> 00:51:41.768
But in this area

00:51:41.968 --> 00:51:45.208
we have Buddha, Christ and Mahavira.

00:51:47.648 --> 00:51:50.248
and they had to do tapasya, tapaha.

00:51:50.728 --> 00:51:51.648
They did it.

00:51:51.848 --> 00:51:55.408
You don't have to do now, they have done for you.

00:52:00.168 --> 00:52:02.608
Now see I saw the musicians yesterday.

00:52:02.808 --> 00:52:05.207
In two three months they have learnt so much,

00:52:05.408 --> 00:52:08.408
otherwise formerly  all the musicians I knew.

00:52:08.608 --> 00:52:09.968
For Indian music

00:52:10.848 --> 00:52:12.568
had to really starve.

00:52:13.168 --> 00:52:15.408
For months together they had to practice

00:52:15.608 --> 00:52:19.328
years together, they had to bow to their guru.

00:52:19.528 --> 00:52:21.488
That is all over now.

00:52:23.928 --> 00:52:26.088
because of this Param Chaitanya

00:52:26.288 --> 00:52:28.088
and your power

00:52:29.328 --> 00:52:31.688
to be one with the Divine.

00:52:31.888 --> 00:52:35.488
This Divine power can transform you completely

00:52:35.688 --> 00:52:37.368
to such an extent

00:52:37.568 --> 00:52:39.448
that anything that you want to do,

00:52:39.648 --> 00:52:41.408
you can do it in two, three months.

00:52:43.368 --> 00:52:45.528
In Pune when they were singing

00:52:46.008 --> 00:52:48.608
'foreigners' as we call them with respect.

00:52:48.808 --> 00:52:52.048
In India 'foreigners' means respect , not like other countries.

00:52:53.448 --> 00:52:54.648
So they were singing.

00:52:54.848 --> 00:52:58.528
They were some very great musicians (who) had come.

00:52:59.168 --> 00:53:02.488
They told  Me,"Mother, we put down our head to them."

00:53:02.888 --> 00:53:04.728
Because how could these people

00:53:04.928 --> 00:53:09.328
who don't know a word about Indian music have learnt it so well

00:53:09.448 --> 00:53:12.808
and the pronunciation of these Marathi languages were difficult.

00:53:13.008 --> 00:53:14.928
But they are so good at it

00:53:15.128 --> 00:53:16.768
is very surprising.

00:53:18.448 --> 00:53:22.328
Now all this has happened in your presence,

00:53:23.768 --> 00:53:24.888
in your presence.

00:53:26.208 --> 00:53:28.855
It is nice here, you have balloons here.

00:53:29.088 --> 00:53:31.048
to celebrate Christ's birthday.

00:53:31.168 --> 00:53:34.448
and all these balloons of your ego should be burst,

00:53:35.048 --> 00:53:36.168
should be finished.

00:53:38.288 --> 00:53:44.608
(clapping)

00:53:50.088 --> 00:53:53.208
I will be happy if you could learn Hindi language.

00:53:54.288 --> 00:53:57.088
But I know My English may not be so good

00:53:57.208 --> 00:54:00.208
but best is to learn hindi,

00:54:01.208 --> 00:54:03.128
if possible.

00:54:03.328 --> 00:54:07.648
Because there are already fourteen languages in India

00:54:08.608 --> 00:54:11.208
and so many languages in another country.

00:54:12.208 --> 00:54:15.367
Every country has a different type of English language.

00:54:15.568 --> 00:54:17.168
If you go to America,

00:54:17.288 --> 00:54:20.568
I don't understand their English for at least two, three days.

00:54:20.688 --> 00:54:22.208
Because they go on

00:54:22.408 --> 00:54:23.848
taking their

00:54:24.048 --> 00:54:25.848
....tongue

00:54:26.328 --> 00:54:29.808
and lips on one side, then on another side.

00:54:35.808 --> 00:54:38.968
English of the French is another point.

00:54:39.168 --> 00:54:41.248
So best is to learn Hindi.

00:54:41.448 --> 00:54:45.928
and that too a good Hindi, not Sanskritized.

00:54:46.048 --> 00:54:49.648
But as they say (Rozmara) i.e., day- to- day- Hindi because

00:54:50.008 --> 00:54:53.208
I feel better if you understand what I am saying.

00:54:53.328 --> 00:54:55.688
It is not difficult because you are all sahajyogis.

00:54:55.808 --> 00:54:58.968
You can learn Hindi in no time. I am not saying you learn Sanskrit.

00:54:59.088 --> 00:55:00.328
But Hindi is very easy.

00:55:00.448 --> 00:55:02.288
Try to. It is not My Mother tongue.

00:55:02.488 --> 00:55:04.968
I have never studied Hindi language, never.

00:55:05.408 --> 00:55:08.928
But you see it is a very easy language to learn.

00:55:09.688 --> 00:55:14.448
But as My father told Me ,"Never teach Hindi language

00:55:14.888 --> 00:55:16.368
to an English man."

00:55:19.008 --> 00:55:20.768
I said," Why this advise ?"

00:55:21.248 --> 00:55:23.727
He said," There was an English man who was after me

00:55:23.928 --> 00:55:26.074
that i should teach him Hindi."

00:55:26.688 --> 00:55:30.608
so he said," I have to tell my servant to open the door

00:55:32.208 --> 00:55:33.608
or to close the door.''

00:55:35.448 --> 00:55:38.168
So for open the door he said you say

00:55:38.928 --> 00:55:44.208
'there was a cool day', means 'Darwaza khol de'

00:55:49.448 --> 00:55:50.876
(clapping)

00:55:57.688 --> 00:56:01.968
And for closing the door, you have to say, 'There was a banker'

00:56:03.808 --> 00:56:07.288
"Maine darwaza bandh kar dey" (means close the door)

00:56:09.648 --> 00:56:11.328
But now it is different.

00:56:13.008 --> 00:56:15.888
They will pick up Hindi very quickly.

00:56:17.208 --> 00:56:18.928
Very quickly, I can see that.

00:56:19.128 --> 00:56:24.048
If you can learn this horrible Indian classical music

00:56:24.208 --> 00:56:27.968
which is so difficult, so easily, what will happen ?

00:56:28.848 --> 00:56:32.568
They can learn Hindi in no time and make Me happier every time.

00:56:32.768 --> 00:56:35.687
Not because Hindi is My language- It is not, it is Marathi.

00:56:35.888 --> 00:56:37.208
Marathi is very difficult.

00:56:37.328 --> 00:56:40.648
I don't think you can learn Marathi. It is very precise.

00:56:40.768 --> 00:56:43.035
I think that is one of the best languages

00:56:43.236 --> 00:56:45.528
to put down your ego.

00:56:47.399 --> 00:56:50.247
That is why Maharashtrians are normally not egoistical,

00:56:50.448 --> 00:56:53.768
because in their language it is built in process.

00:56:54.328 --> 00:56:56.688
For example somebody is boasting,

00:56:58.728 --> 00:57:00.968
that I have done this, I have done that.

00:57:01.288 --> 00:57:06.008
So in Marathi they will say, " Don't climb on a bush."

00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:11.208
or what we call the tree of channa which is so big as that.

00:57:13.048 --> 00:57:14.727
Then the person is finished.

00:57:14.928 --> 00:57:17.368
Like that there are many words by which

00:57:17.568 --> 00:57:20.648
you can put down the ego of the man on his face.

00:57:20.808 --> 00:57:24.208
So Marathi language has so many advantages.

00:57:24.448 --> 00:57:28.527
but I would not ask you to learn Marathi language. It is not so easy.

00:57:28.728 --> 00:57:33.008
But Hindi you should. It is very easy, very easy.

00:57:33.208 --> 00:57:37.248
but you must know one  thing that in Hindi language

00:57:38.048 --> 00:57:39.048
there is 'Adab'.

00:57:39.528 --> 00:57:43.328
'Adab' means modesty

00:57:43.528 --> 00:57:49.248
and respect

00:57:49.888 --> 00:57:54.568
respect, but more than respect it is a style of saying.

00:57:55.648 --> 00:57:59.248
Not ' Urdu ' but Hindi of day - to- day talking

00:57:59.568 --> 00:58:03.168
there is respect and a way to address others,

00:58:04.928 --> 00:58:06.248
to address others.

00:58:06.448 --> 00:58:07.368
All this

00:58:08.448 --> 00:58:09.568
will give you

00:58:10.488 --> 00:58:14.088
a kind of a more

00:58:15.488 --> 00:58:17.368
flexible vehichle

00:58:18.648 --> 00:58:20.288
to express your love.

00:58:21.488 --> 00:58:25.408
Because in Hindi language we can never translate 'I hate you'.

00:58:25.528 --> 00:58:26.688
We never say like that.

00:58:27.568 --> 00:58:28.568
I hate you.

00:58:29.368 --> 00:58:32.008
'I hate you' will anybody say like that ?

00:58:33.848 --> 00:58:35.128
We cannot say.

00:58:35.328 --> 00:58:37.568
To hate somebody is sinful.

00:58:38.968 --> 00:58:40.960
So they can never say,'I hate you.'

00:58:46.168 --> 00:58:48.568
Chastity is more in Marathi language

00:58:48.688 --> 00:58:49.928
but it is a little hard

00:58:50.088 --> 00:58:52.968
because it has got such as I told you

00:58:53.688 --> 00:58:58.488
......idioms which can correct you just there.

00:59:00.368 --> 00:59:06.608
All this is just to request now if you can learn this music,

00:59:07.608 --> 00:59:09.048
which is very difficult.

00:59:09.568 --> 00:59:12.448
You can always learn a simple Hindi language

00:59:13.208 --> 00:59:17.408
which is very very easy and very very easy to talk.

00:59:25.568 --> 00:59:29.488
There are so many things , I would like you to know about Christ

00:59:30.008 --> 00:59:31.008
But this is

00:59:31.808 --> 00:59:34.168
short time in which I cannot tell you.

00:59:36.008 --> 00:59:39.048
The way He had His own priorities.

00:59:43.608 --> 00:59:46.768
Though in the Bible He is not described fully, I should say

00:59:46.888 --> 00:59:50.768
and whatever it might have been they have reduced it.

00:59:51.608 --> 00:59:52.607
Maybe,

00:59:52.808 --> 00:59:55.928
and the way they practice Christianity is shocking.

00:59:56.608 --> 01:00:02.888
So one has to learn Christianity through the heart.

01:00:03.328 --> 01:00:04.328
No other way out.

01:00:06.008 --> 01:00:10.448
They should learn through the Heart, Heart of your Mother.

01:00:12.168 --> 01:00:13.528
May God bless you !
