00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:07.133
This is what I’m trying to tell you,

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:12.634
that Spirit gives you spontaneity in which you are the master.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:17.734
You are the master of yourself, complete master,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.400
no enslavement of any kind, no habits formation coming.

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:23.000
All habits drop out.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.434
You become so, so spontaneous that I don’t have to tell you.

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:31.033
You just drop out all habits and you become a master of your self.

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:33.601
That should happen to you.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.167
Instead of that, if you indulge into things which enslave you,

00:00:39.267 --> 00:00:43.167
you will like it for a while because you can’t help it.

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:45.167
But if really sit down,

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:48.133
you will know that it’s not the thing that you wanted.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.734
You wanted to be the master of yourself.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:54.634
Now here in this map as we show we have two powers,

00:00:54.734 --> 00:00:56.434
left and right powers.

00:00:56.534 --> 00:01:00.534
The left power is the power that gives us conditioning –

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:04.067
left side, the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

00:01:04.167 --> 00:01:06.467
That gives us the conditioning.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.067
Now, if you try to deny all that,

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:11.434
then the right side is even worse.

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:16.501
It gives us action, but with action we can become very ego oriented.

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.667
So both ways it can be troublesome.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:21.767
Supposing you say that “All right,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.801
I have no conditioning of any kind.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:27.133
What’s wrong in doing this? What’s wrong in doing that?”

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.133
And if you just move with that idea, with that freedom,

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:35.000
it will be abandonment, it may not be freedom.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.033
Because freedom must have wisdom behind it.

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:44.067
So both the sides, the movements on both the sides are wrong.

00:01:44.534 --> 00:01:47.334
So what is all right, In the center?

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.434
Is not to get conditioned by anything

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:55.234
and not to be ego oriented.

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:57.434
But how to do it is the problem.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.567
The problem is how to do it.

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:06.400
To be spontaneous is to be absolutely free.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.100
Now I would consider these two powers as say,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.033
a brake and an accelerator in a car.

00:02:13.534 --> 00:02:15.200
Now you use both the powers.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.100
You use the brake first, you use the accelerator.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.801
You try to control these two powers.

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:23.701
But, first of all it is difficult to understand

00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:25.400
how you can use these powers.

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:27.701
Gradually, with practice you’ll do it.

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:32.534
You know how to drive the car, you become the good driver.

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:34.701
After becoming the good driver,

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.000
still you are not the master of the driving.

00:02:38.434 --> 00:02:40.601
But then you become the master.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:45.567
So, today the master within us, within us is the Spirit.

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:50.133
But before realization, we are not the master

00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:54.734
because the master has not come in our conscious mind.

00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:57.734
It is not expressing in our conscious mind.

00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:05.200
In the sense that we are not empowered by its powers.

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:08.501
The Spirit exists; It has Its own powers.

00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:12.234
But we haven’t felt those powers within us.

00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:15.167
Once we feel the powers of the Spirit,

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:20.067
we are empowered by our own powers which are there.

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:23.200
The powers are within us.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.067
These are our own powers.

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:28.100
We don’t have to borrow from anyone, ask from anyone,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.467
they are in ourselves.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:31.100
The Spirit is within us –

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.067
only thing that Spirit has to give light in our,

00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:40.000
in our consciousness.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.601
It has to come in our consciousness.

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:46.634
In simple medical terminology we can see, say,

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:54.067
that the Spirit must manifest Itself in our central nervous system,

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:56.400
in our central nervous system,

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:58.701
so that we should know what we are doing.

00:03:58.767 --> 00:04:02.667
Not that we start just jumping on the,

00:04:02.767 --> 00:04:07.067
on the chair, or some people said, “Oh, we just start doing it.”

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:09.300
It is hypnosis.

00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:12.300
It’s not correct. You are not in conscious mind.

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:14.601
You are doing it out of hypnosis.

00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:18.200
Hypnosis may be coming from outside force.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.467
It’s not your force, your awareness,

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:23.801
your understanding, your power.

00:04:24.067 --> 00:04:28.234
It is somebody else’s because you’re not doing it.

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:34.267
As matter has a power to overpower us, in the same way

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:37.234
there are some material things, I should say,

00:04:37.334 --> 00:04:40.133
which are very dangerous, which are placed.

00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:42.734
For example now cancer, take cancer,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.467
cancer overpowers you.

00:04:44.534 --> 00:04:46.167
It’s a very serious thing.

00:04:46.234 --> 00:04:49.100
Cancer overpowers you; you cannot overpower cancer.

00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:51.000
Take a very concrete example.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.000
Now how is it caused?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.067
Doctors say this way, that way.

00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:58.033
We, Sahaja Yoga can cure cancer, definitely,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.267
hundred percent it can cure, it has cured.

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.267
Many Sahaja Yogis have cured cancer.

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.734
How? Is very simple.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.767
That you become master of yourself and you master the disease also.

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:11.534
You master everything.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.300
Because the master is within you,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.434
it has not come in your conscious mind

00:05:18.534 --> 00:05:20.167
is the only link is left,

00:05:20.267 --> 00:05:24.334
and when that happens Yoga takes place, union takes place.

00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:28.067
We should now completely keep ourselves

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:33.801
limited to Self-realization, about God I’ll tell next time.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:40.334
Self-realization means to bring your Spirit into your conscious mind.

00:05:40.434 --> 00:05:44.200
Now how cancer is caused? Let’s see here what happens.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.434
It is caused by left-sided activity.

00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:52.367
Now left sided activities are emotional traumas,

00:05:52.467 --> 00:05:56.601
emotional problems, emotional upheavals,

00:05:56.701 --> 00:05:59.133
emotional insecurities –

00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:02.701
any kind of insecurity can take you to the left side.

00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:05.701
Little more movement can be these horrible gurus

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:07.267
because they hypnotize you.

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:08.667
They put you to the left.

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:12.033
They put some Spirit in you or I don’t know what they do,

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:14.133
but they put you to the left.

00:06:14.234 --> 00:06:18.667
Any one of these activities which are not authorized by God,

00:06:18.767 --> 00:06:20.801
taken to, you go to the left side,

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:23.567
because you cannot ascend in the center.

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:26.067
So either you go to the left or to the right.

00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:29.667
When you overdo these things, like black magic -

00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:34.133
you have another thing here I’ve heard,

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:37.234
some sort of a organization head -

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.334
and the fellow you see, he used to -

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.434
everything he saw moving in the house.

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:43.434
He came to Sahaja Yoga and

00:06:43.534 --> 00:06:47.434
his water jug was moving there and this was moving there

00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:50.100
and he couldn’t explain what was happening in his room.

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:53.267
He was sitting down and he found something moving from here to here

00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:55.400
It happens. What is that?

00:06:55.467 --> 00:06:59.067
What is that doing this kind of a thing which you cannot control.

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:01.234
Again we come to the same point –

00:07:01.334 --> 00:07:03.000
something you cannot control.

00:07:03.067 --> 00:07:05.767
So you enter into the realm,

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:09.234
into the realm where you are controlled

00:07:09.334 --> 00:07:11.400
and you are not under your own control.

00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:14.467
And that realm, when you enter in,

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:17.467
I have always seen all the cancer patients

00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:20.501
are the ones affected by this.

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:24.167
Most surprising.

00:07:24.267 --> 00:07:27.701
They are not aware; they do not know how they get into it.

00:07:27.767 --> 00:07:30.667
For a lady, supposing, say she’s suffering

00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:34.667
from an insecurity about her husband or maybe something,

00:07:34.767 --> 00:07:38.434
or maybe she thinks that her husband may leave her any time.

00:07:38.534 --> 00:07:41.133
She loves him. Whatever it is.

00:07:41.234 --> 00:07:45.367
Such a woman might get a breast cancer,

00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:48.801
because the insecurities set in, in one of the centers there

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:51.767
which you can see here, the center of the heart -

00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:55.000
Center Heart, as we call it.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.434
Now if this center goes out of order,

00:07:59.534 --> 00:08:02.567
if a woman feels insecure for anything whatsoever,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.467
she’s capable – she’s vulnerable to be attacked

00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:09.400
and she can get into cancer.

00:08:10.334 --> 00:08:13.200
So we have to understand life in totality,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.467
and not in one way.

00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:20.067
The total impact of life, the total effect of life,

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:25.234
the total relationship with life must be understood.

00:08:25.334 --> 00:08:27.601
Now no doctor knows this.

00:08:27.701 --> 00:08:32.501
Will he know, when he treats the patient for, say breast cancer,

00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:37.200
will he know that this lady is insecured ?

00:08:38.234 --> 00:08:43.434
There’s another disease – anorexia – many girls suffer from it.

00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:47.200
They don’t just eat. They just give up eating.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.434
Now, you do not know why it happens.

00:08:50.534 --> 00:08:52.734
Doctors can’t cure it; nobody can cure it.

00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:54.200
What is the reason?

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.734
The relationship of a girl, of a daughter with the father.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.567
Say father dies and the daughter doesn’t see the father,

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:07.367
or she, in heart she loves the father but she doesn’t express it,

00:09:07.467 --> 00:09:10.667
or there’s some bad relationship that comes between

00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:13.701
the father and the daughter,

00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:16.133
you get this trouble anorexia.

00:09:16.234 --> 00:09:21.300
You’ll be amazed but it is impossible for doctors to get –

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.367
we have some doctors sitting here –

00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:29.000
it is impossible for any medical science to go near it.

00:09:30.434 --> 00:09:34.367
Because they do not see a human being in its totality.

00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:38.000
It’s a very delicate instrument God has created.

00:09:38.434 --> 00:09:40.200
The way we are harsh with others,

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.567
the way we sometimes try to trouble others,

00:09:47.067 --> 00:09:53.267
try to make others feel insecured are unfair, unjust.

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:59.400
Without our knowledge we really give them a tremendous insecurity.

00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:03.801
And such insecurities can work out

00:10:04.067 --> 00:10:08.367
incurable diseases of which we are not aware.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.534
So to understand the totality, what should happen to us?

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:18.567
We should achieve that state where we can see the totality.

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:21.734
Like if I have to see now, for example,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.634
the whole of Brighton, what should I do?

00:10:25.734 --> 00:10:29.200
I should go on a plane and see it from that height.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.601
I can see the whole.

00:10:30.701 --> 00:10:34.434
In the same way in your awareness, in your understanding,

00:10:34.534 --> 00:10:38.467
you should rise to that point from where you can see the whole.

00:10:40.067 --> 00:10:44.467
If you cannot see the whole, the partial vision,

00:10:44.534 --> 00:10:50.534
or we can say, a little that you see can create confusion,

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:54.000
can create problems

00:10:54.067 --> 00:10:59.334
and some of them could be of a very, very serious nature.

00:11:00.067 --> 00:11:05.167
Because as human beings, we do not know what are we.

00:11:06.734 --> 00:11:10.701
This is the greatest problem of human beings,

00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:13.367
that they’ll say, “I don’t like it.”

00:11:13.467 --> 00:11:15.400
Now which one is this “I”?

00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:19.367
Is that your Spirit, or is that your ego?

00:11:19.467 --> 00:11:21.801
What is the part that is not liking it?

00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:24.033
Or is it your conditioning,

00:11:24.133 --> 00:11:27.601
because you’re brought up in a particular way so you don’t like this?

00:11:28.267 --> 00:11:32.000
Which part of you is not liking it?

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.701
And you’ll be amazed that it is not your Spirit.

00:11:36.267 --> 00:11:40.133
Because if Spirit likes, how will you know?

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:43.234
It’s only through your vibrations.

00:11:43.334 --> 00:11:46.501
When you can feel the vibrations, then only you will say,

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:48.367
“Yes, my Spirit likes it”,

00:11:48.434 --> 00:11:51.033
because the vibrations have emitted.
