00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.920
...to organize.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.400
Yes, but

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.120
I praise Indians very much and I also praise with you.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.640
But we have certain very bad qualities, and one of them is

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.480
that we are very extremely untidy people.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.600
Our aesthetics are so horribly made

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.400
that we don't understand the difference between a plastic bag

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.440
and a silver jug,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.880
such jumbled up things we have.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.680
And I think I would request you to

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.840
insist on arranging things yourself,

00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:34.440
because then they will pick up and learn things that it is to be done.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.560
You have to learn a lot of things from them,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.200
but they have to also learn some things from you,

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.600
and they are very important things.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.480
Because it all makes a coefficients, it makes an atmosphere,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.080
and a pleasing thing for the Gods.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.960
But this is the character of an Indian, Indian character,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.760
that whatever is wrong, wherever, whatever is the condition, carry on.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.360
See no evil.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.400
Speak no evil.  It's like that.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.480
If anything is bad, let it be as it is.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.040
Let it rust, let it - absolutely till it becomes so rotten,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.640
that it is going to fall on your head,

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.000
then you may put a little support.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.920
That's our character.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.840
We're too tolerant with everything,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.320
and that has led us to this kind of a

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.640
incapacity to work.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.000
But if you see the ritambhara pragya, see the ritambhara pragya,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.200
how she works,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.800
how she beautifully does everything,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.600
how she creates everything so beautifully.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.840
There's so much neatness if you go to a jungle,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.160
you will not find anything dirty, filthy, smelling - nothing.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.440
Everything washed up, cleaned up.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.080
The nature works in beautiful circles.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.520
Everything works out so much beautifully,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.720
that when we call ourselves "natural"

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.520
we should understand that ritambhara pragya is the most natural thing.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.480
And how ritambhara pragya works is with complete neatness

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:02.920
and complete cleanliness of the whole thing.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.240
Indians will be personally very, very clean,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.240
extremely clean they are, no doubt.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.160
But collectively they don't understand cleanliness.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.800
If you see their roads, if you see their

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.680
outside of the houses, it's all dirty.

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.400
And that is what I will blame our Indian men,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.800
you see, they are extremely

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.800
conscious that they are human beings.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.560
You see, we have only two races in India:

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.040
Women and men.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.760
There is no third race.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.240
Men are not supposed to do any work, inside, outside, anywhere.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.920
They don't see to the outside of the house.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.480
Like in England I find men are

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:41.320
all the time doing the sweeping, swabbing, everything outside.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.520
They do mowing of the lawn, looking after the garden, everything.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.720
Here the men will be just standing

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.880
with their hands on their waist

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.960
and ordering the wives, or if not the wife,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.680
the servants and all that.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.280
And whatever may be, the wife may be dominating

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.440
as far as money is concerned,

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.040
but all these things the man is not going to do.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.400
He'll just give up.  He'll say:

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.600
"I am not supposed to do all these things."

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.360
That's why collectively in this country

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:07.760
we can never be clean people,

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.520
because our men will just sit down.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.280
They won't do anything, just they won't do anything.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.000
Only the women are supposed to do everything,

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.000
and that's how our collective cleanliness is zero, absolute zero.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.520
For example, if there's a WC not working in England,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.880
I can't think of any man who will sit down for five minutes.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.480
He'll himself do it, he'll get a plumber,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.480
he'll do somehow or other, try to manage.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.200
Here, it's not all right - doesn't matter:

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.560
It's all right.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.800
No, see no evil - manage.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.640
This is how we have lived all centuries now I think,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.840
and it's high time for all Sahaja yogis to change themselves.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.520
Now, here there are many artists sitting in this part,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.680
but the men are not doing anything - puja the women are doing.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.880
And the women don't know anything how to do it,

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.600
so the whole thing can be absolutely wretched.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.760
It is not, it is a sort of a

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.160
character with us, we do this way.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.600
But otherwise we have so many qualities.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.240
We have so many qualities, that

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.600
you can't imagine how much we have got through our traditions.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.760
We are very humble people, we are

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.440
extremely loving, affectionate,

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.800
we'll go to any extent to serve others.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.680
We are not cunning people, we are not meticulous, we don't calculate.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.320
We are very hospitable.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.200
All these things are there, no doubt.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.240
But these things, that we have to learn from you,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.120
it's maybe gross, to look at it looks gross, but it's not.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.960
Just now as you see that if it is properly done, if it is

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.240
nicely done, I mean, at least I feel very much pleased with it.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.520
And everybody feels pleased about it.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.520
And when somebody sees the film also, they'll be pleased to see

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.960
this find of a film where there's something sensibly

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.520
put up and everything is nicely done, care has been taken.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.039
Also shows a kind of a understanding,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.120
that this is the worship of the Adi Shakti,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.520
and you cannot take liberties with it.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.000
Imagine, in these ordinary temples

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.960
they spend so much money - even the walls, the doors,

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.160
the windows, everything made of silver.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.320
They do so much to create that.

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.880
But if you people miss it - the Indians, I am saying -

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.440
then it's going to be very dangerous for you.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.160
One must understand that you cannot just play about - just:

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.680
"Mother is coming"  -  Nobody came to even call Me.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.000
Somebody should have come to call Me - I just walked on Myself.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.840
Here, this is not the way to behave,

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.400
and the Indians must learn these things,

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.240
that somebody must come to call Me!

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.600
After all, you see,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.040
all these protocols they are going to learn from you,

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.240
from the Indians;

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.640
and if you don't have any protocol about it,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.880
how are they going to get it?

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.400
So this is what one has to understand,

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.440
that as English have to learn

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.000
from French and French have to learn from Germans,

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.320
and Germans have to learn from,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.520
say, Austrians,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.440
or Austrians have to learn from Swiss, whatever it is.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:55.360
It's very important,

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:58.440
that the Indians must learn from the Western people.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.880
Certain things, that the way they respect their women -

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.560
first of all that:

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.920
The way they respect their women.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.560
Of course, one should not go to that limit

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.840
that the women just dominate, all the time.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.000
I mean, American women are,

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.920
I have seen about women, they are horrible.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.080
But still, I would say that one must learn,

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.480
must learn how to respect the women.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.000
Women are human beings.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.880
Your Mother is a woman,

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:22.040
and you must learn how to respect a woman.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.800
And if you don't know how to respect the woman,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.280
then in this country I'm sure

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.880
there cannot be bliss, whatever you may try.

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.120
So the men must learn that,

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.880
they must know how to talk to their sisters,

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:38.520
to their mothers, to their wives.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.680
But if there's a woman who is dominating,

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.480
you see, if there's a dominating woman,

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.000
then she becomes a prime minister in this country.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.200
That's what we are.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.520
If you get a dominating woman then she can manage.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:52.039
If she's a simple woman, she's good, she's religious,

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.360
she's submissive, then she's finished.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.760
If she's dominating, then men are afraid of such women.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.480
This is very sad and that gives a very bad images.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.640
So I feel that as Ritambhara Pragya works out everything so well;

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.760
in the nature if you see how she beautifully creates everything,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.960
how she chooses things, how she places things,

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.720
how the colors change.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.400
You'll never find anything loud, anything obstructing,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:20.240
anything that is destructive, vulgar, new - nothing.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.920
Find everything so beautifully done,

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.440
that it creates an inspiration in a human mind,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.120
in a human heart which can be of a stone also.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.120
Even French, you see, they get

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.680
inspired by Ritambhara Pragya.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.760
So you can imagine people with stone hearts

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.800
can get inspired,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.520
people who have very funny ideas about human beings

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.200
can get inspired by Ritambhara Pragya.

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.320
So why not

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.840
we, the Sahaja Yogis, should get inspiration

00:18:47.039 --> 00:18:48.320
from Ritambhara Pragya,

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.720
and try to make everything look

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.080
nice, beautiful, and must have coefficients

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.160
by which we can have

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.680
the proper channel for our vibrations.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.520
And this is what I feel is lacking

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.120
in the coordination between East and West.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.920
Let us give them this simple thing

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.960
as to understand

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.800
how you respect your women,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.080
how you respect the aesthetics,

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.480
how you look after things.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.240
I know in London, supposing I have to have a Puja,

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:21.560
I don't want to see these things at all.

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:25.080
On the contrary, I am enamored the way things are done - always.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:27.440
Here also they work out, I'm not saying always,

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.680
but it could have been much better little bit,

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.000
because a film has to be done and all that.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.920
But this is the trouble is that

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.040
in our everyday look,

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.440
outlook, we are like that.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.720
You will see that everywhere you go in the villages

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.440
the problem is, there are bathrooms, there are WCs,

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.520
but never repaired.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.560
Once spoiled means spoiled once for all.

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:49.040
Telephone is spoiled, it's spoiled forever.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.400
At least in America people will go and buy; they will not repair.

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:53.680
They will go and buy new one.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.080
Here they will not buy new one,

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.720
nor they will have any replacement -

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.680
carry on with it throughout.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.600
That is a very bad character we have got, which we must change.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.520
We should try to see everything is working all right.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.080
Now, come to the Kundalini,

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.240
supposing the Kundalini goes out of order.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.040
Are we going to give it up?

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.160
If one chakra is not good, are we going to give it up?

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.840
If there's something wrong with -

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:18.680
that point Indians are very particular,

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.400
much more than the Western -

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.920
if the kundalini is out, they'll get after it.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:25.680
If one chakra is out, they'll get after it, they'll clean it.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.360
Because they are the roots, you see,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.560
and the root doesn't bother about the beauty;

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:31.440
but the tree has to look after the beauty.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:35.280
So this is a combination which has to be worked out properly

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.280
by you both.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.600
And the things will work out very well, I think,

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.840
if you understand

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.840
what co-relationship you have with each other,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.400
what you have to learn from them

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.040
and what they have to learn from you.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.320
Now, today is a special day I thought of having a Puja,

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.640
because today is the moon - just see, in front of Me here -

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.320
and today is the day, first day, the moon is waxing.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:01.680
In the science of Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.640
the moon is the spirit in our heart.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.200
It is the spirit in our heart,

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.960
meaning in Marathi "Purnantara",

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.080
is the spirit in our heart,

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.600
and it shines when the sun

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.680
reflects on it.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.680
When the sun - the sun,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.000
that is the Son of God.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.560
When the Son of God reflects on the heart,

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.640
then the moon shines in the human heart.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.040
But when it shines as a moon,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.440
then Shiva Himself lifts it up

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.600
and puts it on His head.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.000
So the human beings

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.039
who are

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.080
blessed by the Son of God,

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.400
who are being

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.240
awakened by the Son of God,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.040
that is you can say that

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.600
it is Shri Ganesh

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.160
or Lord Jesus Christ,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.760
any one of them,

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:12.240
if they enlighten the heart of human beings,

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.040
then it becomes a shining moon.

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.280
And the "amavasya", the day

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.400
when it's the dark night,

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.960
is when a man is not a realized soul at all.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.440
The realized soul is like the full moon.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.640
Now today is the day

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.400
when the moon is slightly,

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.280
one degree less.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.920
It's a important day for us

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.680
because this is the first day

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.600
when it is waxing.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.920
And that is the day we have to fix up our

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:39.800
moon within ourselves,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.760
that we start waxing

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:45.800
by degrees.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.600
Into sixteen degrees we to go on waxing.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.400
And when that happens we don't realize,

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.720
that there is no shining.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.400
The shining is going out.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.080
And we have to be careful,

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.680
we have to look after it,

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.120
and we have to work it out

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.880
so that we worship that day when it starts waxing.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.480
It can wax with many things.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.800
You see, we have so many ways of finishing off

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
the light that God has given us in our heart,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.360
that is the spirit.

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.080
One of them is,

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.080
very great one, is the thinking,

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.640
that we do about it.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.640
The first it starts when we start thinking about it,

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.440
rationalizing about it.

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.040
You must know that when I speak,

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.560
I don't speak - actually these are all mantras,

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.000
and whatever I do,

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.360
I work it out in such a way

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.200
that what I'm saying works out within you.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.880
It's the Krita Yuga, and it works out.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:40.080
When I say that, the whole machinery gets geared up.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.600
So when I say something,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.920
if you start reflecting it in your mind you are gone,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.760
because you are not receiving what I am trying to do.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.160
If it is a mantra,

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.040
that means whatever I am saying,

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.760
those sound waves will create

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.480
that being within you

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.880
that I am describing.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.960
So at that time, once you start thinking about it

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.120
you cannot receive it,

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.880
because you have put a barrier of your thought.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.280
So when I'm talking, just try to receive it.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.200
Just say "yes, yes" inside,

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.280
so that you receive it within yourself.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.360
So this is one of the greatest problems of today,

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.040
is that whatever you say

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.600
everybody must answer,

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.520
everybody must argue,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.560
everybody must say,

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.320
"No, this could be that way, that could be,

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.080
there are alternatives, this, that"  -  everything goes on.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.240
There is no need at all to do all that.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.840
And when you start doing that,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.760
then all the Gods and Goddesses get angry one by one,

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.520
and that's how you start losing your light within yourself.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.360
So this is the most displeasing thing

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.560
for Gods and Goddesses,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.720
that you don't recognize Me.

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.960
That you don't recognize Me fully.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.000
That you still argue with Me.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.200
Still you start asking questions.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.800
Still you start giving Me alternatives.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.680
Absolutely, this is just not necessary

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:59.720
for you to go on arguing,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.160
to go on discussing it.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.080
It is just that you assimilate

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.440
whatever I am saying,

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.680
and that assimilation itself

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.000
will open out those new dimensions within you,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.160
which God wants to be opened out.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.560
So better surrender in that way your ego.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.360
Ego is the one that makes you say something,

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.320
argue something, discuss something.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.280
And this is what is the biggest problem,

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.400
what that I have seen

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.880
when the first day of the waxing starts.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:32.400
So today is the first day when we should say that,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.640
that our ego should not start that drooping down.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.680
It was nice to dance, enjoy, everything,

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.240
but then when you sit down -

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.160
while dancing you can't think, thank God!

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.040
But as soon as the whole thing is over you sit down,

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.760
again the mind starts going on "tack, tack, tack, tack"

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.360
and then we start thinking.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.080
And once we start thinking,

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.040
then we are losing that light which we have received.

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.960
Sort of, the moon has started waxing.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.000
And that point one has to be careful,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.080
because that's the most important thing.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.360
If you do not allow it to happen first time,

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.960
then it can stop.

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.080
It's very simple to understand

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.680
that if you can stop

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.440
a sari or a last bit of it,

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.600
it will not blown off,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.360
because you are holding onto it.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.200
So at the very beginning of waxing of the moon,

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.200
if you are careful about it,

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.440
if you are alert about it,

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.800
it will never happen; whatever you have achieved

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.039
will be sustained, and then you can increase.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.880
But that's the very important point which we miss,

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.360
and that's why we have lots of trouble

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.720
and lots of problems in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.800
So now as you are moving for your further journey,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.080
so many of you have come for the first time,

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.520
I have to tell you:   Don't think!

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.240
Don't reflect!

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.120
In this you must learn from Indians.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.120
They don't think about these things.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:02.560
But they have to think, because when they think

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.120
they'll start thinking about gross things which they have to think.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.600
I mean you don't think.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:08.800
You'll be giving up all that is nonsensical

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.560
that you have been thinking about.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.080
So don't think about it,

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.120
don't reflect, don't bother!

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.200
Try to be subtler and subtler

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.920
and not misidentified with your tags

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.280
that are outside - like hooks, you see.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.720
And the mind is like a hook.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:24.600
I have seen all of you have some

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:25.640
one hook outside

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.160
and all the yarns go, hook around it,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.200
again another yarn goes and hooks around it.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.800
And the whole mind is attached to that hook,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.480
that is Mr. Ego.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.840
If you can cut your strings somehow or other

00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:39.360
and say, "I'm not going to think.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.040
I have come here for my spiritual ascent.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.680
Let me be what I am.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.440
If Mother says something I'll listen to it.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.640
She scolds me, I'll listen to it, She does something,

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.440
whatever She does, let me see

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.880
that, as I have come here for chiseling out myself,

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.840
let Her chisel me out, let the nature chisel me out,

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.920
let the whole atmosphere chisel me out,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.600
Puja should chisel me out."

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.320
But you just become like a beautiful,

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.960
we can say a

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:11.160
jade in the hands of the Divine,

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.680
and allow the Divine

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.280
to take out all your beauty.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.640
Just allow the Divine to take out your beauty,

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.480
and then you can enjoy your beauty.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.640
But if you hand over to all these old things,

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.560
then it will be very difficult.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.120
So as being the first day,

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.960
I have started it on the day

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.280
when the moon is about to wax, you see.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.039
I hope you'll be all very careful about it.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.960
Be alert!   You have to be very alert.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.520
You have to go beyond time.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720
You don't have to think about food.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.480
Once in a while if you don't eat, doesn't matter.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.200
Nobody is going to die.   I tell you!

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.880
We don't eat for days together, nothing happens to us.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.440
So food has not come,

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.720
the breakfast time, the dinner time -

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.960
I mean, there food is a religion, I think,

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.480
so everything has a time.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.600
Here there is no time for anything.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.520
We'll do whenever we feel like, you see?

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.000
Let's do that way.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:02.320
So we have to be prepared for a nice thorough cleansing,

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.440
and a very enjoyable time throughout.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.920
These two things can work hand in hand,

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.320
if you just accept

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.720
that you don't have to think.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.560
If you don't think, everything can be done

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.160
without any problem, and you'll enjoy life very much.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.000
So that's one thing.
