00:00:39.640 --> 00:01:05.979
I 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:27.540
see many more New Zealanders, very happy to
see all of you here.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.960
Today I thought we should have Mahasaraswati's
Puja.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:40.670
Would be a good idea, because we did Mahalakshmi,
let's have Mahasaraswati.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:51.940
So, Mahasaraswati Principle is on the right
side as you all know.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:02.200
First is the Brahmadeva's Principle, which
is the Saraswati Principle, and then this

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:14.989
Mahasaraswati takes you to the principle of
Mahabramadeva called as Hiranyagarba.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:24.560
Now this Hiranyagarba Principle, is very important
for Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:37.000
First of all, those who think too much or
those who create too much without realization,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:52.061
those who express themselves in poetry or
in literature or in music, you can say, in

00:02:52.061 --> 00:03:01.980
paintings, in all kinds of arts; if they are
not realized souls, then they go to the left

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.980
to the extreme or to the right.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:16.170
So for example if there is an artist, if he
goes to the right gradually his paintings

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:24.650
will become extremely violent expressions.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:40.049
Would be very much showing something very
violent and also rather, I would say he would

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.180
be a man who would be inflexible.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.400
He'll have his own style; he can't move into
another style.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.730
He'll use the same style and he will not get
into any other style.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:07.700
Kind of a austere nature he develops in his
productions and then when he gets tired of

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:17.220
it, then he will take to something you can
say like abstract art but without realization

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.250
the abstract art can be something very absurd
and funny.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:34.070
I have seen the extremes of it that I've seen
people who put big canvases on the ground

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:43.460
and poured lots of oil paints one after another
and roll over it, is supposed to be a painting.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:49.800
They say this is spontaneous because they
fell on it or they rolled on that so is spontaneous

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.430
painting that's come out.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.190
Now this spontaneous painting should come
from a spontaneous personality not by rolling

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.080
on thing or something, I mean, all sorts of
things they do but there's no end to it to

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.969
which nonsensical things they think of.

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:12.070
And they think they have achieved a lot and
they've done a lot and also they sell it to

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.750
people who have too much of right side.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.640
They like it.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:30.640
So, they put in lot of effort to create this
kind of a painting.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.570
Also that today's pop music also, which is
very aggressive, is from the same outcome

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.979
because you cannot ascend, so you move to
your right.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:48.150
And this pop music then starts now it's becoming
so horribly noisy, I don't know what to call

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.150
it.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:56.901
Absolutely it can deafen your ears if you
listen to it and the whole thing is, the whole

00:05:56.901 --> 00:06:03.980
gestures and all that are so ugly and so aggressive
as if they're going to eat the mike sometimes

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.229
I feel the way go on with the mike and things.

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:15.060
And see then these people also impress such
people who are very right-sided and so they

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.700
become popular.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.830
But the popularity is not the sign of real
success.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.490
It will come and go away.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:32.890
All such artists and painters come and go
away they have no, no standing, they are there

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.950
for a short time.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:40.780
And then the history talks about them those
who have been in the center never about the

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.780
people who went to the extremes.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.260
God knows how many must have come and gone.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.350
And those who are today also painting or singing
in that way tomorrow they will not be known.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:55.229
One after another you see the craze comes
in one comes and goes away another so they

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:00.880
are crazy people and they create a craze and
the crazy like them enjoy the craze.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:09.690
So it amounts to something that is just wasteful
creates no impression in the history.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:17.930
So this is the right-sided nonsense that comes
out of the right side movement of the sympathetic

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:25.440
going too far with your creativity and also
your writing.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:30.200
And there were many writers in English language
you know from Shakespeare you can start who

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:39.140
showed the futility of human endeavor like
we call an avaduta, the one who has reached

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.520
a very great degree of development in his
spiritual life.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:51.219
He can see the futility of human endeavor
and then he brings them to the point that

00:07:51.219 --> 00:07:58.740
they have to rise above these stupid and human
endeavors and take to some sort of an endeavor,

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:05.610
which will bring them something higher and
also will create something of an eternal value.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:11.050
Then also we have, I think in English language
I have said, [INAUDIBLE] to Somerset Maugham

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.050
and all that.

00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:18.810
They're very centrally placed people, also
Cronin was I would say, but then this Hemmingway

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.700
came, and he started moving towards the right.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:26.400
Now I don't know I don't read now modern novels
because all full of filth.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.370
So it moves to the right.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:34.870
So one is which moves to the right and talks
about all kinds of violence this that, that

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:40.570
also is absolutely not palatable to human
consumption I tell you.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.500
But still they write and people like it.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.630
People want to read about Hitler, they want
to read how people were killed, war stories

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.769
this that.

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:55.000
They want to see pictures which has full of
violence, who are killing this and that, so

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that their own desire to be violent is satisfied
in seeing those things in films and in, otherwise

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.300
also reading such books of that kind.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:13.800
On the left hand side when they move you see
these artists then same about musicians as

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:22.210
I said that the musicians become sort of a
absolutely suffering from Greek tragedy all

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.370
the time.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:32.960
They go on crying and weeping and saying that
this is sort of, we have been very sad and

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:39.560
this sadness and the tragedy of life, I mean
they go on crying and make you cry also.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:48.250
So there's no hope for them and they just
go on doing such stupid things.

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:55.820
Then we have you see many artists also of
the same kind specially French.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:02.390
French writers as well as French poets also
and French painters if you see.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.430
They are very left sided because they drink
a lot.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:10.220
If you go in any France village after seven
o'clock you can't find even one person on

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:15.330
the road and even if you want to find out
the road and you knock at the door and request

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.380
them that you would like know some road and
all that, they're all drunk already at seven

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.470
o'clock.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:28.370
So with this thing they become extremely over-romantic
type and they sing songs of romance, have

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:34.010
no romance in their life you see, they just,
some sort of a imaginary romance they have

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:39.890
and they live in that imaginary world of pain
and sufferings and they have their own ideas

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:48.250
about their own romantic models that they
formed in their heads you see with their left

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:49.250
side.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:54.330
So the poets and the writers go to the left
side like that and in say for example in our

00:10:54.330 --> 00:11:02.210
India we had those Muslims used to drink a
lot then they started a thing called as gazal

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.050
and that gazal is nothing but crying.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:09.320
Even in certain poets you see, we have this
kind of a thing in the other places where

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.600
there were many poets who were seeking God
and were crying, "Oh God, when will I meet?"

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:23.140
and in separation they are singing, not in
the meeting, not in the yoga but in separation

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.170
they sing, 'When will I meet You, oh God?"
and all that.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.950
And all such people who are still seeking
like such songs going on.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:35.540
Up to this much is all right but then you
get lots of grotesque type of writers also

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.560
who write such horrible things that you feel
you are in hell the way they describe things

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.070
are horrible.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.350
And in Sanskrit called as vivastera create
a vivasaras.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:52.280
And it's the description of very filthy things
which were never before even in English language.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:12:04.630
Never I saw that but now some books are full
of filth and dirt and horrible sex descriptions

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.840
that you just can't bear it.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:14.710
So all this comes with the left side movement
that, because you see society also moves from

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.870
sometimes to the right sometimes to the left.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.320
So when it moves to the right they like right-sided
things sometimes they move to the left they

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.710
like left-sided things.

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:29.160
So also there are people with two types of
temperaments so that's how they start appreciating

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.950
these things and unnecessarily they believe
that they are tragic.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:40.250
As you know about the Greek tragedy which
is a very sort of a fundamental thing I would

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:48.710
say for a Western literature is a Greek tragedy
where a woman marries a man but she doesn't

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:52.420
love her husband so she loves somebody else
and that tragedy is there.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:59.170
I mean it's artificially created tragedy that
shows that you are married to some man and

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.660
you should be happy with him.

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:04.750
Of course I mean if the man is very bad and
troublesome and all that then you can give

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.750
him up.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:09.230
But what's the use of pining for another man,
living with one other man?

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:14.450
Sort of a thing as you must have heard about
Tolstoy who was another great ralized soul.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:19.160
He's written Anna Karenina and ultimately
he saw that Anna Karenina commits suicide.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.710
Because what she was doing a wrong thing you
see, so he brought the whole thing so beautifully

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:30.540
out and such an introspection all the time
you see going on and also the futility of

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.490
this kind of a romance that was there.

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:41.380
So all this shows to us that there are people
at the same time who are in the center I would

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:47.950
say in French writers also Maupassant was
one of them whom I would put in the center.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:52.040
He showed both the sides and he showed the
right side also.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:59.920
So we have had Goethe, we had many sort of
people in Europe and England also in English

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.880
language because I am talking about English
language.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.900
But also same in Sanskrit, in Hindi, in every
language we have the same type of people but

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.950
more in Sanskrit.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:16.210
We don't have many people with this right
or left side.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.870
The reason is: for literature there are some
rules and regulations.

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:27.300
It's not the Western idea in India that we
should be abandoned people.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.230
That's not accepted.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.540
So even in literature there is a kind of a
restriction.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.020
What is a literature?

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.200
Sahitya, it's called as sahit, means which
will be benevolent.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.160
Sahita means which will be benevolent.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.550
If it is not benevolent then it is not sahitya,
it's not literature.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.050
Then it is trash.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:57.710
So that restriction you see, which is there
which is given to us by great saints and seers,

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.600
is still accepted.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:05.089
Of course, some people deviate a little bit,
little bit they deviate, but once they deviate

00:15:05.089 --> 00:15:11.000
it goes out of the society, people just don't
read it.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.010
Say for example some people must have written
this Karma Sutra or something long time back

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:20.460
but we never knew about it, we never read
about it till the Germans came and made such

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.610
an ado out of it, we never knew there are
such books.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.540
Even now I don't know who wrote it or I've
never read such a book, I've never seen it

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:32.400
with My own eyes but we have heard about it
that people wrote such things.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:40.010
But actually if you ask a ordinary human being
in India who is maybe a scholar also, he will

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.010
say, "What's that?

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.520
I've never heard about it."

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:48.310
But the Germans or the Japanese very particular
on these things, they want to find all such

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:49.310
things.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:16:00.529
So these creations of ugliness I should say,
or of vulgarity, all these are a compensation

00:16:00.529 --> 00:16:08.240
for people who are very right-sided also because
a right-sided man will always take to drink.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.360
Because you see he wants to compensate so
the right-sided man also will like such horrible

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:23.010
things just to quench his thirst for power
you see.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:31.770
He's so mad and then he would like to little
bit neutralize that movement in such a way

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:38.970
that his right-sided behavior is little bit
compensated by the left side.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.620
So the people who are right-sided take to
drinks very much.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:49.210
You will see people will work very hard and
two nights, Saturday and Sunday night, they're

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.210
just drunk.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.339
Then Monday they'll come out with a hangover.

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:56.220
See it's very interesting to note how human
being are.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:01.430
For five days they will slog, slog, slog,
slog, slog and then two days they'll just

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:06.770
go into a kind of a hibernation as they say
and absolutely lost to the whole world.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.689
Whether they are doctors or professionals,
they don't care.

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:14.550
So whatever they earn in five days they'll
spend it in these two days in drinking and

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.880
finish it off.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:28.439
So that's how the total gain in all that creativity
comes in.

00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:42.510
Now, when these extreme things start showing
results and then the artist gets just fed

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:49.720
up with this kind of thing going on all round
he sees and all that.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:59.060
Then within him rises a subtler attitude towards
creativity, towards art, towards books and

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:07.680
all that and then he starts in that, reading
about the true knowledge pure knowledge.

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:18.840
He wants to see paintings or he wants to listen
to music which sings of Divine or divinity.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:29.660
Whole that madness makes him really think
that now we should start doing something better

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.410
and then the Mahasaraswati Principle starts
working out.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:40.140
But in that also when they start thinking
of God, they fall into traps.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.590
Like you see somebody might fall into some
sort of a religion.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:49.680
Now as you know these religions so-called
are just money-oriented or power-oriented.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.990
They are not at all in no way spirit-oriented.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:19:00.620
That's the reason when they are not spirit-oriented
what they give people is a kind of a personality

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:04.280
which is all mental.

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:11.230
You ask them about Upanishads they will recite
verses after verses.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.870
Gita they'll give big lectures on that hours
together.

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:19.520
For this Chinmoy you see if you hear him,
he speaks for hours together on Gita you get

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.772
tired and bored stiff with his lectures.

00:19:20.772 --> 00:19:25.640
He can speak about it but nothing inside.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:30.000
Nothing inside and whatever they speak has
no effect on others also because they are

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.300
not awakened people, they are not connected
with the Divine and whatever they do is just

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.300
mental.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:44.320
So when the Mahasaraswati Principle is awakened
you start seeing it clearly that "This is

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.100
mental, this is not the truth, there must
be something higher."

00:19:49.100 --> 00:20:02.650
They read about all the spiritual works in
their own religion in which they are born,

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:07.000
then they start moving out and reading about
some other religions also.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.370
Then this thing that every religion says the
same thing then it comes to the Agnya point.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:19.830
When it comes to the Agnya point only there
then suddenly they realize that there is something

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:26.060
wrong, that people are mentally only accepting
this religion and there must be something

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.300
beyond this.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:35.430
At that point if somebody gets the realization,
he just takes to it.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:41.290
But this Mahasaraswati Principle has to be
awakened in all the people who are musicians,who

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.400
are artists, who are this and that and that.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:50.400
And those who have reached that state, then
suddenly they can get realization very easily.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:56.200
I've seen some people, very great artists
they are today but when they came to Me first

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.400
were not at all well known or anything.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.980
But when they came to Me while singing only
they got their realization just singing.

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:10.690
Or there was one gentleman who was just playing
tabla before Me, I mean not so good, all right,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:19.179
and then I was in Pune where I saw him, and
in Pune he was playing very well and I said,

00:21:19.179 --> 00:21:20.780
"He's the same fellow."

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:25.230
But somebody said, "No, no, Mother, he's not
the same, he was not such a great player."

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.230
I said, "All right."

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.280
I had taken some flowers for these musicians
so I sent it.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.840
He came running and touched My feet.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.690
"Mother, have you not recognized me or what?"

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:34.770
I said, "I have, that's why I have brought
you the flowers."

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.179
I didn't know what to say.

00:21:36.179 --> 00:21:39.270
But the way he had improved, now he is a world
famous tabla player, world famous.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:46.679
It has happened with many others also the
sarod people with the sitar people, so many

00:21:46.679 --> 00:21:49.350
people have achieved a lot.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:22:00.310
Musicians they after coming to Me they have
asked Me that "Please, do something that we

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:05.010
should be able to enhance our creativity."

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.830
I just said, "Take to Sahaj, that's all."

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:15.700
And when they were awakened very surprisingly
today most of them are very well known musicians

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.700
and very famous in India.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.370
Of course, the Western musicians I don't know
where to lay My hands because I don't know,

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.950
till they the way they are screaming these
days I think their throats will be out may

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.440
be something then they might come to Me.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:45.750
But on the whole My own idea is this, that
those who have reached Mahasaraswati level

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:55.080
through reading or through creativity, but
through writings or anything, when they reach

00:22:55.080 --> 00:23:06.730
a certain state of Agnya, then either they
get disappointed go to the left and absolutely

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.800
think that this is all useless.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:19.679
Or else if they get realization they become
really very dynamic artists, very dynamic

00:23:19.679 --> 00:23:28.140
writers and people who are creating something
of an eternal value.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:34.950
So many Sahaja Yogis who have never spoken
on the stage, who have never been on the stage

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.410
they said, "We had a fright for the stage."

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:46.340
They all, surprisingly now have become great
orators and speak very well and know so much.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.670
So this is the Mahasaraswati Principle.

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:57.740
Now this makes you a person much subtler and
you start becoming aware that the gross understanding

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:08.800
we had about our art or our creativity has
to be subtler, we have to be subtler people.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.610
And then such writers only appeal to people
who are subtler.

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:16.970
Like William Blake was regarded as a mad poet.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.650
I mean in India I never read about him.

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:25.610
I did read on My own but in the colleges university
they never had William Blake or in any book

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.150
as such there was no William Blake.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:36.140
But when you go to these people and talk to
them, there was one called Mascaro fellow,

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:44.540
he has translated Gita into English, is a
very wonderful person.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.580
He is, actually I think he is a Italian.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.309
Now he is no more.

00:24:48.309 --> 00:24:50.030
He lived in near Cambridge.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:58.630
I went to see him, he was very anxious to
meet Me and when I went there you'll be amazed,

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:07.640
he did My aarti, and he said a mantra in Sanskrit
that "Oh God, You have come to my house!

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.910
What have I done in my previous lives that
You are in my house?"

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:21.710
Such a beautiful poet, you see, and he said
in Sanskrit language, he was a master of Sanskrit.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.270
So I asked him, "From which book you have
taken this couplet?"

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.810
He said, "I've composed it myself."

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:32.110
So beautiful it was, and then he said certain
things from Gita and all that.

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.799
And he said, "Mother, I don't know You might
be ..."

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:36.100
He was very old that time.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:37.530
He was eighty years of age.

00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:43.790
He said, "Mother, maybe You might be able
to change these English, but I don't think

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:45.110
I've done anything.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:48.040
Even when I translated Gita they are just
reading only.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.470
Reading Gita, that's all.

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:51.630
So what's the use of my translation?

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:52.630
Just like Bible.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.130
Now they are reading word by word Gita.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.130
So, finished!

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:56.660
What's the use of doing this work?"

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.330
And he was so disappointed with the whole
thing.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.640
So he said, "What will You work out?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.200
How will You work out?"

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.080
I said, "All right, I'll try."

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.059
He said, "Of course, You are there; You are
an Incarnation."

00:26:08.059 --> 00:26:09.380
He just recognized Me.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.320
"I know You'll work it out."

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.220
He wrote a very nice letter to Me also and
then he died.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.130
But such a nice man and he suffered a lot.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.640
Nobody tried to understand him.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:27.460
He said, "I talked to so many scientists and
things and they're absolutely useless and

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.320
very superficial.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:34.240
So I don't think in this country of England
You'll be able to do much, is a very superficial

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.240
country."

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:40.130
There were at least twenty English Sahaja
Yogis with Me sitting there listening to it.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:44.840
He said, "They are extremely superficial,
this language is superficial, they don't know

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.010
about anything about Spirit or anything about
Kundalini."

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:57.040
And he was a very well read man very deep
person and he told Me that while he was studying

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.120
gradually he felt this Mahasaraswati Principle
the way he didn't say Mahasaraswati but he

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.200
felt there must be subtler knowledge subtler
knowledge.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.840
So he took to books like Gita, this, that,
and then suddenly he felt that it's all reading

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.840
again.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:18.299
It's just the same like translation and specially
when he translated Gita he was amazed that

00:27:18.299 --> 00:27:23.600
people were just reading it like Bible then.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.470
Then he said that "Mother, I don't know how
but one day I was praying to Mother Mary and

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:33.350
to the Holy Ghost and I got my realization."

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:37.660
So he was a realized soul and he saw Me in
dream, you see.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.140
He said, "In dream You came and gave me realization."

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.140
It's surprising.

00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:42.950
He saw Me in dream and he got ...

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.290
There's another few people who have got it,
but specially him.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.900
I was so surprised so when I arrived in his
house he recognized Me immediately.

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.020
He said, " I saw You in my dream.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:56.650
You came and gave me realization, You awakened
my Kundalini and You gave me realization."

00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:04.600
So you can imagine that this gentleman was
so beautifully placed so subtle, he was that

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.760
at the Agnya point.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.670
He just got the dream and he got realization.

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:13.120
And he said, "All the knowledge is now revealed
to me so much more."

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.150
And then he sat down with Me.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:16.820
And he said, "Can you stay for some time?"

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.289
I said, "I am now going away."

00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:21.039
But at least for five hours he was talking
to Me.

00:28:21.039 --> 00:28:23.730
He was not tired, he would not leave Me.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:25.790
Such an old man was sitting at My feet.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.640
I was telling him, "You sit on the chair."

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640
"'No, I'm very good.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.780
I'm very much all right You sitting there."

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:36.679
So this is what happens with this Mahasaraswati
Principle developing within us.

00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:39.850
But we should allow that to grow within us.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.999
So in Sahaja Yoga we are not told that we
are not to read any book, not at all.

00:28:43.999 --> 00:28:49.370
We have to read, but in that book we have
to see the subtle points and see for yourself.

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:53.260
I don't read any scriptures, because I don't
need to read.

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:59.270
But when I started reading the, you see, these
intellectuals, what they have to say, I was

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.580
amazed that they are saying the same thing.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.910
There's nothing new.

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:06.810
What I know, what I say, that's what they
are saying.

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.950
There's nothing new about it; there's nothing
special about it.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:15.140
Just what all the scriptures have said, they
have said the same thing, and these people

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.240
are saying the same thing.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.180
But by saying these things, how are they going
to propagate?

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.180
Nothing.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:29.799
It will be just again something that will
happen outside and it will drop out.

00:29:29.799 --> 00:29:34.840
It doesn't become part and part of yourself,
so it has to become innate.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:39.370
That's only possible if your Spirit comes
into your attention.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.490
There's no other way out.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:48.059
So luckily you all are realized souls and
your Mahasaraswati is very much there, but

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:49.670
I would say you must read.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:57.539
Read books of value and understand how it
is absolute Sahaja Yoga there, how it is there.

00:29:57.539 --> 00:30:03.420
Anything you take up you'll be surprised that
all these books are talking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.620
May not be all of it, but part of the Sahaja
Yoga is there.

00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:12.660
All of them talk of some part of Sahaja Yoga
but not the whole of it, because they came

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:14.190
at different times.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:18.850
And now the Sahaja Yoga is the time when you
have to know the complete, integrated knowledge

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:24.400
of this religious thought that was there.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.470
Complete integrated.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:29.660
And that's how you understand that all religions
are integrated.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.460
So one should, in Sahaja Yoga, after you come,
people don't take to any reading.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.460
Is a wrong thing.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:40.720
They should read and understand what others
have said, where have they gone wrong.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.740
But not these nonsensical people.

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.760
You shouldn't read these nonsensical people
which you know are nonsensical.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.950
But so many, the other day I got this book
of the Christian Science.

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:54.179
It's all Bible nothing special about it.

00:30:54.179 --> 00:30:58.700
They are saying you should not do this; you
should not do this, and all that.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.430
It's all written in the Bible.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.850
What new things are you telling?

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:03.850
Nothing.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:04.850
You don't need a science for that.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.300
It's just there.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.720
But they are making money out of it by explaining
and this and this.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.820
No explanation needed.

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.780
Because that has to come within yourself is
the point which is not there.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:23.600
So now, this Mahaswaraswati Principle is awakened
within us and we have to read and see the

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:33.660
subtle side of this growth of thought, how
it grew up and how it became subtler and subtler,

00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:37.600
and how so many people in the world have contributed
to it.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:46.640
So many artists, so many musicians and so
many, we can say, writers who have really

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:53.650
contributed to the central path of Sushumna
because they became realized souls.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.280
They were realized souls.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:02.190
Some were born, and some became, and then
they completely wrote about the yoga.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:08.010
For example Rabindranath Tagore, in the beginning
he writes, "How, when will I meet you my friend?"

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.720
and all that.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.059
What you call the separation song, [INAUDIBLE]
yoga.

00:32:13.059 --> 00:32:18.419
And then after some time, suddenly he gets
his realization, because he becomes subtler

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:20.080
and subtler and subtler.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:28.309
Then he writes about his meeting, his meeting
the Spirit and he writes about it.

00:32:28.309 --> 00:32:36.130
So these things work out in such a manner
for some people that by their subtleties they

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.510
arrive at a point of realization.

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.860
Same thing happened with Buddha.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.380
He did the same thing.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:49.480
He renounced everything, renounced His family
went out, read Upanishads this, that.

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:56.650
Everything He read and ultimately reached
Gaya where He was sleeping under a banyan

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:57.650
tree.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:07.030
And while sleeping only, He was so tired and
fed up, He got his realization.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.230
And that's what is very important.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:14.809
But for the Buddhists what He did before going
there is important.

00:33:14.809 --> 00:33:19.630
So they also want to also renounce this and
become sanyasis, this, that.

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.730
But by becoming that, nothing is going to
happen.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.539
It's going to Gaya and sleeping there also
won't happen.

00:33:25.539 --> 00:33:33.730
It has to happen because He was a pure seeker,
true seeker and that's why it happened.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:38.909
But for Sahaja Yogis, they don't have to do
anything of the kind they just get it, realization.

00:33:38.909 --> 00:33:44.880
Because I think most of them in their last
lives have crossed most of their problems,

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.970
and have known that it's nothing, it's all
nonsense in all these things.

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:52.429
Or maybe in this life also they must have
realized it's all nonsense.

00:33:52.429 --> 00:33:55.650
And then they must have come to Sahaja Yog.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:34:03.220
So it's a very great luck for you that you
are here and you've got your realization and

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:11.280
that you are enjoying yourself.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:19.220
May God bless you!

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:24.929
Another side which I have left over is the
political side - on the right side, you see.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:32.109
Even in politics, the growth becomes subtler
and subtler.

00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:39.750
Like in say, we can say, in Russia when it
was such a power-oriented thing.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.149
It's not money-oriented.

00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:46.020
The Communism was so power-oriented it reached
a place that person like Gorbachev was to

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:54.429
be born who would put it in a proper sense,
and he came on a central path.

00:34:54.429 --> 00:35:00.349
He didn't want complete democracy as it is
in America, it's a demonocracy, but he wanted

00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:02.039
a balanced thing.

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:06.640
So far he has not been able to manage, but
I'm sure one day he will be managed, but he

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:17.690
will be known all over the world for his great,
great thought and great work of reducing the

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:24.309
pressure between the two great, or say between
the two ideologists.

00:35:24.309 --> 00:35:31.660
And he's done such a good thing that now there's
no war, going to be no war, as I mean not

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.579
a very big world war but could be little bit
here and there.

00:35:34.579 --> 00:35:39.539
That also is coming up which is a problem
of fundamentalism, is not due to political

00:35:39.539 --> 00:35:41.220
but fundamentalism.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:46.640
So now the problem today is fundamentalism
and that also comes from the right side, absolutely.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:53.539
Fundamentalists are all right-sided people
and this right-sidedness takes them to any

00:35:53.539 --> 00:36:00.809
extreme of violence could be or, in some cases,
it's really crazy and madness.

00:36:00.809 --> 00:36:06.660
But a new disease has started now those who
go too much to the right is called as a yuppies

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:13.500
disease where the whole conscious mind goes
out of order and you become like a reptile.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:20.660
I've seen people being carried like big fishes
on the shoulders you see and put in a seat

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.519
and they just know everything.

00:36:22.519 --> 00:36:26.809
By brain is all right but they understand
everything.

00:36:26.809 --> 00:36:33.500
They can talk well but they cannot move their
hands, cannot move their feet if they want

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.500
to.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.289
Unconsciously they may, but consciously they
cannot, and this disease is the one which

00:36:38.289 --> 00:36:41.960
is a warning to everyone.

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.609
So we have be careful in Sahaja Yoga also,
we should not go too much to the right is

00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:48.109
also very dangerous, too.

00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:54.099
Some people become very fanatic and start
teaching Sahaja Yoga in a very fanatical manner

00:36:54.099 --> 00:36:58.420
and sort of you see, make a ... I don't know
what to call that.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.940
But sometimes I see some people speaking in
a manner that one should never speak that

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:05.660
way because we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:17.390
The main thing is love, compassion, which
is a living force and must be done everything,

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:29.430
with that force, which is a beautiful, living
force which creates these flowers, which does

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:32.960
all kinds of beautiful constructive things.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:46.180
It should not be in any way a oppression,
domination or in any kind of command.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:51.530
You should not do like this, and organization,
nothing of the kind.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:57.099
It is something so spontaneous, so beautiful,
just works out.

00:37:57.099 --> 00:38:03.589
But as these trees have to be embedded in
the Mother Earth, in the same way you should

00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:10.599
be embedded in the principle of Sahaja Yoga
which is compassion, love, and divine grace.

00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:15.030
If it is not there, then you'll have problems
with leadership and you'll have problems with

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:19.279
... Anybody who's a violent person cannot
stay in Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:19.279 --> 00:38:20.299
He has to disappear.

00:38:20.299 --> 00:38:24.239
Either he should change himself entirely or
he has to disappear.

00:38:24.239 --> 00:38:27.490
It doesn't work out with people who are violent.

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:34.599
So one has to understand that you may be in
any position, you may be anywhere, you may

00:38:34.599 --> 00:38:40.469
be a very poor person, you may be very rich
but makes no difference for a Sahaja Yogi.

00:38:40.469 --> 00:38:48.289
The best thing to judge yourself is that whenever
we are doing anything for anyone or saying

00:38:48.289 --> 00:38:54.719
anything, is it benevolent or is it violent?

00:38:54.719 --> 00:39:10.039
Is it for our self-propagation or self, holier-than-thou
sort of a principle or it is for the goodness

00:39:10.039 --> 00:39:11.839
of others?

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:19.430
Once you start judging like that, you'll be
amazed that your whole system will change,

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:23.810
your way of talking, your way of working it
out.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:27.069
For example today you see there was a lady
who wouldn't allow Me to talk at all.

00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:30.410
She was talking all the time about something
which was not important.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:34.450
But still I was working it out because I knew
that there's no need to talk now.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.130
With this gentleman I can work it out.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:45.609
So it is always so that you should try to
see the whole thing as a complete play and

00:39:45.609 --> 00:40:00.730
take a very, a witness state, in 
a witness state you should watch.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:08.859
If you watch everything in a witness state
then you can handle the whole situation very

00:40:08.859 --> 00:40:14.479
nicely, even if you do not talk, if you do
not say anything still in a witness state

00:40:14.479 --> 00:40:58.529
you become very powerful, and in that witness
state you can easily solve lots 

00:40:58.529 --> 00:58:32.420
of problems.

00:58:32.420 --> 02:08:47.850
May God bless you!
