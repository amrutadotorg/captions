02:17.587 --> 02:27.757
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

02:27.757 --> 02:34.196
When Bala says that I can give you realization
in a split of a second I have to tell you

02:34.196 --> 02:36.466
that it is you who get it.

02:36.466 --> 02:47.227
You are built in that way like a seed; when
you put it in the Mother Earth it sprouts.

02:47.227 --> 02:52.657
Whom will you give the credit -- the seed
or the Mother Earth?

02:52.657 --> 03:03.966
Without the Mother Earth the seed cannot sprout
and it does not mean that if you put a stone

03:03.966 --> 03:07.826
in the Mother Earth it will sprout.

03:07.826 --> 03:15.317
So the credit is not to anyone but it is a
process which is built within us through ages

03:15.317 --> 03:17.487
of our seeking.

03:17.487 --> 03:22.276
We have been seekers in previous lives and
before that we have been seeking.

03:22.276 --> 03:25.076
Even when we were amoeba we were seeking.

03:25.076 --> 03:27.757
That's how we have become a human being.

03:27.757 --> 03:33.177
And now we have reached a stage where we are
human beings and we are seekers of truth.

03:33.177 --> 03:41.677
This is the epitome of the highest that any
human being can reach where he is seeking.

03:41.677 --> 03:50.296
As a human being when we are born we are quite
aware that we are higher than animals, that

03:50.296 --> 03:56.957
we have capacities much more than animals
have.

03:56.957 --> 04:07.147
We are quite aware of our being as a human
being but this awareness that we have is still

04:07.147 --> 04:12.207
not complete because we are still in confusion.

04:12.207 --> 04:15.966
We do not know why we are on this earth.

04:15.966 --> 04:19.117
We do not know what we have to achieve.

04:19.117 --> 04:27.557
We do not know what mistakes we are committing
or this is right or that is right.

04:27.557 --> 04:34.567
A man lands up himself into confusion because
of ignorance.

04:34.567 --> 04:40.747
Now this ignorance, as has been described
by all the prophets and saints, is just a

04:40.747 --> 04:46.697
myth, like if you have darkness here that
doesn't mean it exists, but because there

04:46.697 --> 04:49.147
is no light.

04:49.147 --> 04:56.367
In the negation of the light gives you the
darkness.

04:56.367 --> 05:04.127
Where is the light, and how do we awaken it?

05:04.127 --> 05:12.827
This question has been very much looked into
by thousands and thousands of people earlier

05:12.827 --> 05:19.967
also, and thousands of years back people have
bothered to find out where is this light and

05:19.967 --> 05:22.637
how do we awaken it.

05:22.637 --> 05:30.867
Now this light is within us because they found
it, and the method they have said also is

05:30.867 --> 05:34.257
within us because they knew about it.

05:34.257 --> 05:41.617
But this knowledge was quite a big secret
for many years, thousands of years, and was

05:41.617 --> 05:47.597
not given to people because people were not
ready to accept it and to take advantage of

05:47.597 --> 05:49.407
it.

05:49.407 --> 05:53.587
But we should not say that it was not said.

05:53.587 --> 06:01.277
It was very clearly said in most of the scriptures
that you are to be born again.

06:01.277 --> 06:04.507
Unless and until you know yourself you cannot
know God.

06:04.507 --> 06:12.386
First you know yourself and then you will
know God Almighty.

06:12.386 --> 06:25.626
For example, supposing we are coming to Birmingham
and we do not know the way, and we get lost.

06:25.626 --> 06:32.017
We can come here, can be brought properly,
but the car that you are driving, you don't

06:32.017 --> 06:34.137
know the car.

06:34.137 --> 06:36.277
You don't know how to drive.

06:36.277 --> 06:39.127
You don't know the way.

06:39.127 --> 06:42.897
Then how are you to reach the right place?

06:42.897 --> 06:48.867
If everything is missing, how can you say
that you can reach Birmingham without any

06:48.867 --> 06:51.077
knowledge about it?

06:51.077 --> 06:57.777
In the same way, if you have no knowledge
of yourself itself, how can you know God when

06:57.777 --> 06:59.287
you have not known yourself?

06:59.287 --> 07:05.346
It is very logical, and extremely simple logic
should tell you that you do not know about

07:05.346 --> 07:07.697
yourself.

07:07.697 --> 07:14.737
People become mad and when they are absolutely
gone cases they end up into lunatic asylum.

07:14.737 --> 07:16.807
But when it starts they do not know.

07:16.807 --> 07:23.167
They get cancer diseases, terminal diseases
of the worst type, and they don't know how

07:23.167 --> 07:24.557
to overcome it.

07:24.557 --> 07:30.397
Till they have reached their last stage they
do not even feel it.

07:30.397 --> 07:34.357
Suddenly they discover, "O God, I have this
disease."

07:34.357 --> 07:39.267
So we do not know even our physical being
that when it is hurt, when it is in danger,

07:39.267 --> 07:43.697
when it is diseased we have no idea.

07:43.697 --> 07:47.066
We do not know our mental being either.

07:47.066 --> 07:51.857
When we are impressed by other people we start
behaving like them.

07:51.857 --> 07:55.537
When they mesmerize us, we start following
them.

07:55.537 --> 08:00.797
We are not aware that we have no mind of our
own; we are just following something that

08:00.797 --> 08:06.827
is very aggressive and that's how we accept
it.

08:06.827 --> 08:15.667
If you are accepting something about which
you have no idea just because you are impressed

08:15.667 --> 08:24.126
by somebody's personality or the way he talks
or the way he comes to you, then definitely

08:24.126 --> 08:26.287
your mind you do not know.

08:26.287 --> 08:29.797
Like Hitler, he came with funny ideas.

08:29.797 --> 08:37.677
He told people that, "We are a very great
race and we have a right to kill everyone

08:37.677 --> 08:40.827
and to put the people in the gas chamber."

08:40.827 --> 08:45.527
They accepted.

08:45.527 --> 08:51.126
How can you accept such a mass massacre of
people like that?

08:51.126 --> 08:52.126
But they did accept.

08:52.126 --> 08:57.317
The reason was they did not know what is their
mind.

08:57.317 --> 09:00.126
We do not know our emotions also.

09:00.126 --> 09:01.457
We say, "This is my son.

09:01.457 --> 09:03.596
I'll give my life for this son.

09:03.596 --> 09:05.027
I'll do this for him.

09:05.027 --> 09:06.027
This is my daughter.

09:06.027 --> 09:08.156
This is my father."

09:08.156 --> 09:12.707
But when it comes to selfishness everything
drops out.

09:12.707 --> 09:15.717
So we do not also know our emotions.

09:15.717 --> 09:18.077
If we had known we would not talk like that.

09:18.077 --> 09:20.927
Every moment we are changing our mood from
this to that.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.607
Sometimes we are happy with that person.

09:22.607 --> 09:24.307
Then we are very unhappy.

09:24.307 --> 09:26.287
Then we become enemy of that person.

09:26.287 --> 09:28.156
We fight for that person first.

09:28.156 --> 09:33.807
We say, "No, this is my brother," and then
we say, "No, he is my enemy."

09:33.807 --> 09:34.807
Why?

09:34.807 --> 09:38.157
Because both of them do not know their mind.

09:38.157 --> 09:49.777
So first we must know ourselves by which we
get the light to know all these things.

09:49.777 --> 09:50.936
Now what is that self?

09:50.936 --> 09:55.457
What is that Spirit, that Atma about which
all the great people have talked?

09:55.457 --> 09:59.677
Where does it reside within us?

09:59.677 --> 10:04.197
It resides in our heart.

10:04.197 --> 10:06.827
Now when I say this, you need not accept Me.

10:06.827 --> 10:10.037
In these modern times nothing should be accepted
blindfolded.

10:10.037 --> 10:11.927
It's very dangerous.

10:11.927 --> 10:16.017
That's how you have fallen into traps of so
many wrong people.

10:16.017 --> 10:22.096
When I say that you should only have an open
mind of a scientist, to see whatever Mother

10:22.096 --> 10:24.066
is saying is true or not.

10:24.066 --> 10:33.697
Now the time has come that God can be proved
scientifically.

10:33.697 --> 10:38.567
The science of Sahaja Yoga can prove that
there is God.

10:38.567 --> 10:45.927
The science of Sahaja Yoga can prove that
there is self, the spirit.

10:45.927 --> 10:51.806
It can prove all the saints and prophets who
came on this earth told the truth.

10:51.806 --> 10:58.037
It can prove that whatever is said about the
miracles of God is all true.

10:58.037 --> 10:59.936
The time is like that.

10:59.936 --> 11:02.446
Only our mind doesn't go to that side.

11:02.446 --> 11:04.167
We don't want to know about it.

11:04.167 --> 11:08.377
We don't want to understand it.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.266
Now this is a special time which is described.

11:11.266 --> 11:19.337
This is a very, very special time which has
been prophesized by so many.

11:19.337 --> 11:23.307
Every one of them, those who were great saints,
have.

11:23.307 --> 11:29.366
They have to be great saints or real saints,
as we say Sat-Guru [Hindi word meaning True

11:29.366 --> 11:30.366
Master].

11:30.366 --> 11:38.597
Those prophets who were real prophets, they
all have said that the time is going to come

11:38.597 --> 11:41.316
when you are going to be resurrected.

11:41.316 --> 11:48.467
Mohammed Sahib has said, "At the time of resurrection
your hands will speak."

11:48.467 --> 11:53.740
Very clearly he has talked about resurrection
throughout, but who is bothered to know that?

11:53.740 --> 12:00.686
They all only want to talk about the doomsday
so that everybody is frightened.

12:00.686 --> 12:06.636
Another is that we talk of the day when you
are all going to be damned into something

12:06.636 --> 12:13.496
because you should be all frightened and you
should just go under their clutches and surrender

12:13.496 --> 12:21.956
yourself so that these people who will be
destroyed first are going to save you.

12:21.956 --> 12:24.066
People have made money out of God.

12:24.066 --> 12:25.066
Imagine!

12:25.066 --> 12:27.866
How can you have an enterprise in the name
of God?

12:27.866 --> 12:30.196
How can you make money in the name of God?

12:30.196 --> 12:32.917
I mean, how does it go into your logics?

12:32.917 --> 12:36.477
I can't understand that you can pay money.

12:36.477 --> 12:40.527
How can you intellectualize God?

12:40.527 --> 12:45.946
It's amazing the way they are intellectualizing
Christ and believing Paul was nothing but

12:45.946 --> 12:46.946
an intellectual.

12:46.946 --> 12:48.046
Why is he there in the Bible?

12:48.046 --> 12:51.717
I can't understand he should not have been
there.

12:51.717 --> 12:54.837
That way, we Indians are sensible.

12:54.837 --> 12:58.706
We had Guru Nanak who wrote Guru Granth Sahab.

12:58.706 --> 13:02.097
He has taken all the poets who are realized
souls.

13:02.097 --> 13:05.116
Not one is none realized.

13:05.116 --> 13:11.597
We don't listen to people who are not realized,
who are not of a great evolved state.

13:11.597 --> 13:16.677
But this Mr Paul has come inside there, and
now he's challenging Christ and his miracles.

13:16.677 --> 13:17.677
What does he know?

13:17.677 --> 13:20.527
He is not a realized soul.

13:20.527 --> 13:23.306
If he's not a realized soul how can he talk
about God?

13:23.306 --> 13:24.306
He has no business.

13:24.306 --> 13:25.306
He has no right.

13:25.306 --> 13:30.537
None of these people who authorize themselves,
get elected and selected as big Brahmins and

13:30.537 --> 13:41.076
big pundits and big bishops and Popes and
others, they are nowhere near God.

13:41.076 --> 13:43.556
They are not realized people, are they?

13:43.556 --> 13:46.337
What realization have they got?

13:46.337 --> 13:50.388
They are just interested in politics, economics
and all nonsense that is not God's job.

13:50.388 --> 13:58.186
But we get into their traps.

13:58.186 --> 13:59.186
Be careful.

13:59.186 --> 14:04.676
You are seekers of truth and not of something
that is ignorance.

14:04.676 --> 14:09.266
We have had enough of ignorance.

14:09.266 --> 14:14.996
Any person who has any power will never succumb
or compromise with untruth.

14:14.996 --> 14:17.996
That is first sign of a person who is a realized
soul.

14:17.996 --> 14:23.597
He is not bothered, even if you put him to
jail, you crucify him, poison him, do what

14:23.597 --> 14:25.066
you like.

14:25.066 --> 14:27.556
And this is what surprises me.

14:27.556 --> 14:34.147
How do you like such people and adore such
people for compromising and meek and taking

14:34.147 --> 14:39.196
to all kinds of falsehood?

14:39.196 --> 14:40.777
Take the case of Christ.

14:40.777 --> 14:44.047
Did He compromise?

14:44.047 --> 14:46.236
Did not!

14:46.236 --> 14:49.097
Any time, He never compromised.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.206
What I am saying about Paul was said by Kahil
Gibran.

14:51.206 --> 14:57.787
Openly he said it in his book, "The Son of
Man" or something like that, he clearly says,

14:57.787 --> 14:59.246
"This Paul, a strange man."

14:59.246 --> 15:00.246
I don't understand.

15:00.246 --> 15:02.796
He's not a man with a free will.

15:02.796 --> 15:09.046
It's true anybody who is a realized soul can
see this, and all those who follow him are

15:09.046 --> 15:12.556
following falsehood and making others follow
him.

15:12.556 --> 15:14.597
I must tell you God is not an enterprise.

15:14.597 --> 15:15.717
Remember that.

15:15.717 --> 15:19.956
If you understand that God doesn't understand
money at all.

15:19.956 --> 15:21.756
Is your headache.

15:21.756 --> 15:24.477
You better deal with money, not Him.

15:24.477 --> 15:29.076
So in Sahaja Yoga people say, "Mother, what
about money?"

15:29.076 --> 15:31.217
I say, "What money?

15:31.217 --> 15:34.037
How much money you pay to the Mother Earth
to sprout the seed?

15:34.037 --> 15:37.027
You pay that much to Me.

15:37.027 --> 15:43.337
If Mother Earth can take for her love any
money, you can give me some money."

15:43.337 --> 15:44.566
How can you talk like this?

15:44.566 --> 15:45.657
This is ridiculous.

15:45.657 --> 15:48.477
It is ridiculous.

15:48.477 --> 15:50.366
So there is no money.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.366
That is nonsense.

15:51.366 --> 15:52.367
There is no effort, either.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.557
See what effort do we put in?

15:54.557 --> 15:59.997
It's a living process and for a living process
what effort are you going to put?

15:59.997 --> 16:03.046
What effort did we put to become human beings?

16:03.046 --> 16:04.046
Nothing!

16:04.046 --> 16:05.046
Effortless!

16:05.046 --> 16:06.796
Sahaja Samadhi Lago.

16:06.796 --> 16:10.546
Sahaj is born with you.

16:10.546 --> 16:13.546
Sahaja, born with you.

16:13.546 --> 16:17.746
So what is there for people to put in effort?

16:17.746 --> 16:20.337
It is He who does all the jobs.

16:20.337 --> 16:21.576
What work do we do?

16:21.576 --> 16:22.576
In our ego we think, "I have done this.

16:22.576 --> 16:23.796
I have done that."

16:23.796 --> 16:24.796
What?

16:24.796 --> 16:28.126
A tree must have died and you make a platform.

16:28.126 --> 16:29.126
So what?

16:29.126 --> 16:30.546
Dead from the dead!

16:30.546 --> 16:32.587
What else have we done?

16:32.587 --> 16:33.837
Then you make a chair and sit on the chair.

16:33.837 --> 16:36.936
You can't sit on the garden, floor.

16:36.936 --> 16:39.287
The other day somebody was interviewing on
the BBC.

16:39.287 --> 16:40.287
Poor thing!

16:40.287 --> 16:44.536
You see, they were trying to arrange a platform
and I sat very comfortably, but he had such

16:44.536 --> 16:46.516
aches and cramp.

16:46.516 --> 16:51.897
He couldn't even ask me proper questions because
he can't sit on the platform.

16:51.897 --> 16:58.606
He said, "Mother I have never sat on a platform
all my life," because now he must carry a

16:58.606 --> 17:03.076
chair with him on his head.

17:03.076 --> 17:09.186
So one must understand that this dead is going
to make us slaves.

17:09.186 --> 17:12.686
What we do is to create dead out of dead and
think, "Oh, I have done this.

17:12.686 --> 17:14.316
We have done that."

17:14.316 --> 17:17.616
Can you transform a flower into a fruit?

17:17.616 --> 17:19.106
Can you?

17:19.106 --> 17:24.066
One flower?

17:24.066 --> 17:26.766
What can I describe?

17:26.766 --> 17:28.076
The glory of God!

17:28.076 --> 17:31.066
There's no words.

17:31.066 --> 17:38.717
Just think that every human being gets a child
according to the family.

17:38.717 --> 17:42.436
Who does that job?

17:42.436 --> 17:43.436
Imagine!

17:43.436 --> 17:47.056
Imagine that child has cells developed.

17:47.056 --> 17:53.616
There's thousands of cells: some for the nose,
some for the eyes, some for the hands.

17:53.616 --> 17:58.066
How it develops automatically -- Sahaja.

17:58.066 --> 17:59.516
What do you do?

17:59.516 --> 18:00.756
Spontaneous!

18:00.756 --> 18:05.147
Do you give any treatment to the child or
give any suggestions to the child?

18:05.147 --> 18:10.196
The One who does all these things, how can
you describe His glory?

18:10.196 --> 18:12.417
And you challenge Him.

18:12.417 --> 18:19.366
Here we are, like Newton has said in a very
humble way, collecting the pebbles on the

18:19.366 --> 18:21.967
shores of knowledge.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.306
That's what we are.

18:23.306 --> 18:29.136
And so we have to know, only thing that we
can become is a drop in the ocean and become

18:29.136 --> 18:36.837
the ocean so that all our angularities drop
out.

18:36.837 --> 18:39.647
This is the only thing we have to achieve.

18:39.647 --> 18:44.236
But for that also, God has made all arrangements
so sweetly within us.

18:44.236 --> 18:50.366
He has made us so beautifully; he has created
us so beautifully within ourselves.

18:50.366 --> 18:56.926
This is the picture of that tree of life which
is still dormant within you, and the Kundalini

18:56.926 --> 19:02.566
that is the Holy Ghost is described, is in
the triangular bone.

19:02.566 --> 19:09.986
Now this Kundalini has to rise, just like
a primule in a seed, or you can say the germinating

19:09.986 --> 19:20.787
power, and she rises through six centers,
comes out of your fontanel bone area and gives

19:20.787 --> 19:25.547
you the Cool Breeze, from your body, from
your head.

19:25.547 --> 19:28.537
For that you need not change your dress.

19:28.537 --> 19:29.957
You need not put up any show.

19:29.957 --> 19:30.957
Nothing.

19:30.957 --> 19:33.357
It is something inside that happens.

19:33.357 --> 19:39.557
Kabira has described, "Shunya shikhar par
anahad baaje."

19:39.557 --> 19:51.547
On

19:51.547 --> 19:57.487
the silent apex there is the percussion of
Anahata.

19:57.487 --> 20:01.207
Anahat is this "lub-dub" of the heart you
feel there.

20:01.207 --> 20:05.837
And then when it breaks you start getting
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

20:05.837 --> 20:06.837
If you call it, miracle.

20:06.837 --> 20:07.837
It is a miracle, but to Me it is not.

20:07.837 --> 20:08.837
It's all there.

20:08.837 --> 20:09.837
It is built in.

20:09.837 --> 20:14.407
There are thousand and one miracles we see
morning till evening.

20:14.407 --> 20:20.597
We are not surprised and this is also the
great thing that God has done, that you all

20:20.597 --> 20:22.927
have to get your Self-realization.

20:22.927 --> 20:24.107
The time has come.

20:24.107 --> 20:29.867
This is the time of judgment, a special time,
a blossom time when thousands of you have

20:29.867 --> 20:30.927
to get your realization.

20:30.927 --> 20:36.667
First of all we have to know that we must
get the light within ourselves.

20:36.667 --> 20:41.277
Then one can tell you all about the chakras
and the nadis and everything.

20:41.277 --> 20:45.907
Like the light here has to be put on first,
and then one can tell you about the history

20:45.907 --> 20:51.107
and how it came and about everything else,
but very easy to get the light.

20:51.107 --> 20:55.837
Now the other day somebody asked me a question,
"Mother it used to take thousands of years

20:55.837 --> 20:57.597
for people to get realization.

20:57.597 --> 21:00.827
They used to be born again and again and all
that."

21:00.827 --> 21:03.837
I said, "That was all right."

21:03.837 --> 21:08.747
Because on the tree of life first there were
one or two flowers only, but today you all

21:08.747 --> 21:10.377
have come through all that.

21:10.377 --> 21:11.527
Now that background is with you.

21:11.527 --> 21:16.087
You are just cashing your background with
Me.

21:16.087 --> 21:20.097
I am just like a banker sitting here.

21:20.097 --> 21:22.857
But even you feel that you don't have a background.

21:22.857 --> 21:25.027
You have it.

21:25.027 --> 21:29.827
You don't know what background you must have
had that you have become a human being, and

21:29.827 --> 21:31.357
on top of that you are a seeker.

21:31.357 --> 21:33.407
You might done some mistakes, doesn't matter.

21:33.407 --> 21:38.367
After all, human beings are only going to
make mistakes.

21:38.367 --> 21:40.107
So we are not to feel guilty.

21:40.107 --> 21:44.737
That is one thing I have to make very humble
request that we are not going to feel guilty

21:44.737 --> 21:45.737
at all.

21:45.737 --> 21:49.147
Today, somehow or other, the time has become
very short for Me.

21:49.147 --> 21:51.377
Your train times have to change.

21:51.377 --> 21:58.707
You have to go to London tonight, and I will
start the program of giving realization to

21:58.707 --> 21:59.707
you.

21:59.707 --> 22:05.447
But there will be some people here who will
look after you, fulfill all your questions

22:05.447 --> 22:07.577
and do everything.

22:07.577 --> 22:10.987
They have become experts and sometimes they
are more effective than Me.

22:10.987 --> 22:23.447
Especially in India you see, and here I find
that somehow I, being a very gentle Mother,

22:23.447 --> 22:27.137
people do not take things seriously.

22:27.137 --> 22:35.507
Mother may be gentle but She can be very forceful,
and you all should take your realization because

22:35.507 --> 22:46.867
the power of love is the highest that suits
you, controls you, makes you a higher personality.

22:46.867 --> 22:51.207
We have never used the power of love so far.

22:51.207 --> 22:55.127
We have only used the power of hatred.

22:55.127 --> 22:59.457
The power of love just flows.

22:59.457 --> 23:08.267
That is, not to be seen but to be felt as
cool breeze all around, is called as Rutambhara

23:08.267 --> 23:13.197
Pragya -- in Sanskrit language, is called
as the All Pervading Power of God's love.

23:13.197 --> 23:20.347
Is called as Brahma, is called as so many
Nirakaar sakshat brahma, but all these things

23:20.347 --> 23:23.617
are to be felt.

23:23.617 --> 23:30.887
It acts so that you get cured of your troubles.

23:30.887 --> 23:39.117
It acts so that you are mentally a very happy
and a satisfied person that you rise into

23:39.117 --> 23:40.117
joy.

23:40.117 --> 23:46.527
It acts through your attention that wherever
you put your attention it cures; it makes

23:46.527 --> 23:48.827
a person innocent.

23:48.827 --> 23:52.197
As Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous
eyes."

23:52.197 --> 23:53.877
Where are those people?

23:53.877 --> 23:57.907
Where do we find those people who have no
adulterous eyes?

23:57.907 --> 23:59.227
But you get purified..

23:59.227 --> 24:04.687
Your eyes get purified, and you have those
eyes that when you put those eyes on anybody

24:04.687 --> 24:07.457
he gets his realization.

24:07.457 --> 24:10.977
That sort of a personality you develop.

24:10.977 --> 24:14.157
You are so great and glorified by God.

24:14.157 --> 24:17.847
Just achieve what is inside you.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.927
Just get it, manifest it.

24:19.927 --> 24:26.527
But truth has to be manifested on your central
nervous system.

24:26.527 --> 24:28.857
Not just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

24:28.857 --> 24:33.437
No mental projection, but you must feel it
on your central nervous system and you have

24:33.437 --> 24:38.257
to become your own master.

24:38.257 --> 24:43.507
That's what when happens then you say you
are a self-realized person.

24:43.507 --> 24:50.287
It's not that you do all kinds of bad things
and say that, "Oh I am great."

24:50.287 --> 24:51.387
Not so.

24:51.387 --> 25:03.397
You really become embodiment of virtue, embodiment
of righteousness and you lose that capacity

25:03.397 --> 25:05.177
to be tempted by nonsense.

25:05.177 --> 25:10.977
Nor do you allow any habits to come over you.

25:10.977 --> 25:16.687
Such a powerful, compassionate personality
you develop and the whole personality beams

25:16.687 --> 25:19.617
with that and you can see it clearly.

25:19.617 --> 25:27.517
You don't become a miserable bony structure,
as they put up of Christ, but you really become

25:27.517 --> 25:32.267
like the one Michelangelo has done -- that
sort of a great personality.

25:32.267 --> 25:36.417
When they put up such a picture know that
they are miserable creatures themselves.

25:36.417 --> 25:41.257
Ask them if they can carry the cross themselves
that they can put up such a picture of Christ.

25:41.257 --> 25:48.287
They have done harm to everyone, not only
to Christ; to all the great prophets when

25:48.287 --> 25:49.947
they lived and when they died.

25:49.947 --> 25:55.327
They are still harming them by giving wrong
ideas about them, by making money out of them,

25:55.327 --> 25:58.607
by spreading hatred out of them.

25:58.607 --> 26:00.457
Anything extreme is wrong.

26:00.457 --> 26:03.627
You have to be in the center.

26:03.627 --> 26:06.967
You have to be moderate and it acts and works
out.

26:06.967 --> 26:10.167
May God bless you all.

26:10.167 --> 26:15.877
Today I am sorry I won't allow you to ask
Me questions because there's no time today.

26:15.877 --> 26:21.407
I'm sorry I didn't have so much time, but
what we can do is to leave someone here for

26:21.407 --> 26:23.447
you, whom you can ask questions.

26:23.447 --> 26:25.697
Best is to get your realization.

26:25.697 --> 26:28.977
That will work it out and let's see how much
time it takes.

26:28.977 --> 26:35.027
Actually, Kundalini takes split of a second
to rise, split of a second.

26:35.027 --> 26:36.027
But where?

26:36.027 --> 26:39.577
In Indian villages.

26:39.577 --> 26:41.267
I don't know about Birmingham.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.377
Let us see how it works out.

26:44.377 --> 26:50.677
But you have many people here who are already
realized souls sitting and it should take

26:50.677 --> 26:53.377
no time for you to be that.

26:53.377 --> 26:56.057
But don't start thinking about it.

26:56.057 --> 26:57.977
It is beyond thought.

26:57.977 --> 27:04.297
It is in thoughtless awareness you have to
rise but you don't have to fight your thoughts.

27:04.297 --> 27:06.607
You become thoughtlessly aware.

27:06.607 --> 27:12.817
You become -- again I say you have to become,
it's not just a mental projection or a certificate,

27:12.817 --> 27:16.437
"born again", and behaving like a stupid fool.

27:16.437 --> 27:24.577
Or, "I am such and such guru," wearing his
mala and the guru and the shishas going to

27:24.577 --> 27:28.727
hell, taking two running jumps that way.

27:28.727 --> 27:31.117
That's not it.

27:31.117 --> 27:38.417
It's such a funny sight when you see those
people, the chelas of the gurus the way they

27:38.417 --> 27:39.417
are.

27:39.417 --> 27:40.417
Just can't believe it.

27:40.417 --> 27:44.687
The guru has befooled them and they have really
become fools and stupid people.

27:44.687 --> 27:47.377
So be careful.

27:47.377 --> 27:49.547
You have to become your own guru.

27:49.547 --> 27:52.197
I am just your Mother.

27:52.197 --> 27:54.977
I am here to give you your realization.

27:54.977 --> 27:59.237
As far as the Mother Earth gives sprouting
to the seed, that's all.

27:59.237 --> 28:02.097
There's no obligation, nothing of the kind.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.097
It's your own.

28:03.097 --> 28:04.217
You have it and enjoy it.

28:04.217 --> 28:11.597
Only thing after this, as yoga has one meaning,
the Union with the Divine, and another is

28:11.597 --> 28:19.697
the deftness, the art of handling this power
of God.

28:19.697 --> 28:23.987
The Divine Power, the Divine Laws, this is
the, another meaning.

28:23.987 --> 28:25.817
That is in Sanskrit it's Kaushalam.

28:25.817 --> 28:30.857
It's the deftness, the technique, the technicalities.

28:30.857 --> 28:38.887
Not of how to handle a car but how to handle
this power, this great power that starts flowing

28:38.887 --> 28:39.887
through you.

28:39.887 --> 28:49.877
You become like the flute of Shri Krishna,
egoless, and you enjoy that egoless state.

28:49.877 --> 28:54.897
That's what you all are for and you should
get it.

28:54.897 --> 28:59.697
May God bless you.

28:59.697 --> 29:04.497
Question from a seeker.

29:04.497 --> 29:15.297
Shri Mataji: Just a minute, I'll tell you
now.

29:15.297 --> 29:17.297
Sit down, sit down.

29:17.297 --> 29:19.567
It's very simple, you see.

29:19.567 --> 29:23.187
Your question is all right but is not thought
out.

29:23.187 --> 29:26.687
But you understand how you have not thought
out.

29:26.687 --> 29:31.817
Now just a minute, now in this light there
is a lamp and a light coming out, all right?

29:31.817 --> 29:38.247
Now you think about your question again.

29:38.247 --> 29:39.347
What is it?

29:39.347 --> 29:41.197
What are you asking me?

29:41.197 --> 29:42.277
All right!

29:42.277 --> 29:43.347
All right!

29:43.347 --> 29:46.047
God is everywhere, all right?

29:46.047 --> 29:51.747
I can't understand what he is talking about.

29:51.747 --> 29:57.407
Bala: Mother I don't think this is the time
to discuss...

29:57.407 --> 29:58.887
Shri Mataji: All right, you can discuss with
him later on.

29:58.887 --> 30:00.367
All right, we'll give you a full chance.

30:00.367 --> 30:01.367
What is he trying to say?

30:01.367 --> 30:02.367
Just tell me.

30:02.367 --> 30:03.367
One minute.

30:03.367 --> 30:09.107
Bala: He is saying that the Kundalini is wholly
within the body but God is everywhere.

30:09.107 --> 30:13.167
How can you awaken something which is within?

30:13.167 --> 30:14.997
Shri Mataji: But that I will show you....

30:14.997 --> 30:16.617
Bala: On the assumption that God is everywhere.

30:16.617 --> 30:18.997
Shri Mataji: I mean, God is everywhere.

30:18.997 --> 30:19.997
Now see, it's very simple.

30:19.997 --> 30:20.997
I'll tell you.

30:20.997 --> 30:21.997
It's like this.

30:21.997 --> 30:26.187
There is ether everywhere, all right, but
how is it that only the radio receives the

30:26.187 --> 30:27.577
programs?

30:27.577 --> 30:31.167
Why do you have a radio?

30:31.167 --> 30:32.197
You can receive yourself.

30:32.197 --> 30:34.177
After all, ether is everywhere.

30:34.177 --> 30:35.497
It's very simple.

30:35.497 --> 30:37.687
I mean, you have not used your brains at all.

30:37.687 --> 30:39.807
When asking the questions use your brains.

30:39.807 --> 30:43.607
Comment from questioner: "Let the people receive
the"....

30:43.607 --> 30:46.477
Shri Mataji: Now you should not be -- Hello,
sir, you should not be aggressive.

30:46.477 --> 30:47.487
There are many who want it.

30:47.487 --> 30:48.577
Let it be.

30:48.577 --> 30:49.907
We are going to give you time.

30:49.907 --> 30:50.907
I will tell you all about it.

30:50.907 --> 30:55.957
Why you are for the people?

30:55.957 --> 30:57.267
Are you representing them?

30:57.267 --> 30:59.127
How are you talking for people?

30:59.127 --> 31:01.357
Who wants to hear his lecture?

31:01.357 --> 31:02.957
Is there anyone?

31:02.957 --> 31:05.097
No one wants you.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.697
Please go away.

31:06.697 --> 31:09.897
Useless man, does nothing for you.

31:09.897 --> 31:13.097
From where they come, God knows.

31:13.097 --> 31:15.037
Must be from some guru paid by them.

31:15.037 --> 31:17.407
That's all, nothing else.

31:17.407 --> 31:21.487
They earn money and that's how they manage.

31:21.487 --> 31:25.987
They earn money; good advertisements by some
people put them up.

31:25.987 --> 31:32.097
Some of them came to kill Me because you see
they are enterprisers.

31:32.097 --> 31:34.897
So, they think when I say, "You can't give
money," you see.

31:34.897 --> 31:40.577
In Marathi we say that, or in Hindi we say,
"Pate pe pair aana."

31:40.577 --> 31:42.867
You see, his earnings are hurt.

31:42.867 --> 31:44.097
They don't like Me.

31:44.097 --> 31:46.537
It's all right.

31:46.537 --> 31:49.857
I'll have to say what I have to say.

31:49.857 --> 31:52.397
I am not afraid of them.

31:52.397 --> 32:00.757
All right, please take out your shoes.

32:00.757 --> 32:02.857
It's not that only I can raise the Kundalini.

32:02.857 --> 32:04.667
You see, ego gets challenged by that.

32:04.667 --> 32:05.947
I don't mean that.

32:05.947 --> 32:08.397
If you get your realization you can give.

32:08.397 --> 32:14.647
Actually there's one gentleman in Maharashtra
who has raised the Kundalini of ten thousand

32:14.647 --> 32:19.197
people, but one light has to enlighten another
light.

32:19.197 --> 32:20.437
What is wrong in that?

32:20.437 --> 32:22.847
And then another light can enlighten just
another light.

32:22.847 --> 32:26.657
But the one that is not enlightened has to
get their light from someone.

32:26.657 --> 32:28.867
In that their ego is hurt.

32:28.867 --> 32:33.057
They don't mind taking dole from the government
but if somebody tries to raise their Kundalini,

32:33.057 --> 32:38.087
his ego is hurt.

32:38.087 --> 32:42.357
Such self-respecting people, I can't understand.

32:42.357 --> 32:46.467
It's a great blessing that somebody's raising
your Kundalini.

32:46.467 --> 32:48.807
Where do you get people these days?

32:48.807 --> 32:51.657
They only want to have all your money, that's
all.

32:51.657 --> 32:52.827
Who does that?

32:52.827 --> 32:54.737
Have you met anyone?

32:54.737 --> 32:57.417
If you have met anyone like Me, please tell
Me.

32:57.417 --> 33:02.717
I haven't met one.

33:02.717 --> 33:05.897
It's not that I am something great, but this
is the fact.

33:05.897 --> 33:14.627
This is the truth that somebody has to do
it without any selfish interest.

33:14.627 --> 33:16.627
It has to be done.

33:16.627 --> 33:20.897
It's a job of a person who has no selfish
interest.

33:20.897 --> 33:25.907
It's just the love, the compassion.

33:25.907 --> 33:27.867
So, how can you challenge that?

33:27.867 --> 33:28.867
It is there.

33:28.867 --> 33:30.307
It will act and work out.

33:30.307 --> 33:33.927
All right, so settle down little bit.

33:33.927 --> 33:36.667
Don't be upset with this gentleman.

33:36.667 --> 33:37.777
It's all right.

33:37.777 --> 33:39.997
They are always there to upset.

33:39.997 --> 33:41.677
Only one is not to fight.

33:41.677 --> 33:44.307
Now what you have to do take out your shoes,
simple.

33:44.307 --> 33:48.477
What I say, you just do it and it will work
out.

33:48.477 --> 33:49.747
Have faith in yourself.

33:49.747 --> 33:52.247
First of all, have faith in yourself.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.507
Forgive yourself.

33:53.507 --> 33:54.507
Don't feel guilty.

33:54.507 --> 33:57.277
I have told you before now, "Don't feel guilty.

33:57.277 --> 33:58.277
Don't feel guilty.

33:58.277 --> 33:59.277
Don't feel guilty."

33:59.277 --> 34:02.657
All of you are capable of this Kundalini awakening.

34:02.657 --> 34:06.477
So, please don't feel guilty.

34:06.477 --> 34:11.667
Just know that everyone can get realization.

34:11.667 --> 34:19.467
Everyone can become a guru and everyone can
give realizations to others.

34:19.467 --> 34:21.527
Is a fact.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.577
This has happened.

34:23.577 --> 34:28.856
But if you want to sit on the fence, you go
ahead with it because I have to gain nothing

34:28.856 --> 34:29.856
out of you.

34:29.856 --> 34:31.007
Be sure on that.

34:31.007 --> 34:35.367
You see, it's a subtle type of a ego that
works in people.

34:35.367 --> 34:37.137
What do you have to give Me?

34:37.137 --> 34:43.667
Supposing I say I want something, then it's
all right, but there's no shop here.

34:43.667 --> 34:46.137
It's a temple.

34:46.137 --> 34:54.557
In a temple you have to get something and
you don't go and fight with someone in a temple,

34:54.557 --> 34:55.967
do you?

34:55.967 --> 34:57.377
All right!

34:57.377 --> 34:59.097
So now close your eyes.

34:59.097 --> 35:03.797
Put your hands like this, just like this.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.356
You don't have to do anything.

35:06.356 --> 35:07.356
Effortless!

35:07.356 --> 35:08.437
It's effortless.

35:08.437 --> 35:10.547
Don't fight your thoughts.

35:10.547 --> 35:11.547
Don't fight anything.

35:11.547 --> 35:13.937
Just let your attention be loose.

35:13.937 --> 35:16.097
Kundalini itself will rise.

35:16.097 --> 35:17.647
You don't have to do anything.

35:17.647 --> 35:22.287
Just have faith in yourself, that's all, that
you are going to get it.

35:22.287 --> 35:29.287
Now
one thing you have to do is to remember that

35:29.287 --> 35:34.377
the left hand is for your desire, desire power,
which they will explain to you later, and

35:34.377 --> 35:41.897
the right hand is for awakening of the Kundalini
in the way that it goes into action.

35:41.897 --> 35:48.557
It gives release to your different centers
by which the Kundalini rises easily.

35:48.557 --> 35:49.797
It's very simple thing.

35:49.797 --> 36:03.177
So, put your right hand on your heart.

36:03.177 --> 36:08.877
Put your right hand on your heart.

36:08.877 --> 36:27.706
Now, as I said, the Spirit resides in your
heart but God Almighty, the seat of God Almighty,

36:27.706 --> 36:34.586
is on top of your head where you have a very
soft bone in your childhood called Talu.

36:34.586 --> 36:36.867
He resides there.

36:36.867 --> 36:42.106
But His reflection, the Spirit, resides in
your heart.

36:42.106 --> 36:49.907
So here you have to say, or ask Me a question
with full confidence again, not counting your

36:49.907 --> 36:54.566
sins or anything, but knowing that you are
a seeker and you are going to be blessed into

36:54.566 --> 36:55.677
the Kingdom of God.

36:55.677 --> 37:01.687
With all that dignity as a question to Me
-- you can call Me Shri Mataji or you can

37:01.687 --> 37:10.407
call me Mother, whatever you like -- "Mother,
am I the spirit?"

37:10.407 --> 37:15.426
Three times.

37:15.426 --> 37:27.966
Three times, ask a question.

37:27.966 --> 37:31.046
You are the spirit, but you have to just ask
the question.

37:31.046 --> 37:32.387
There's no harm in asking.

37:32.387 --> 37:36.587
Please keep your eyes shut because Kundalini
won't rise if you, if you keep your eyes shut.

37:36.587 --> 37:41.357
Please have respect for yourself because you
are the spirit.

37:41.357 --> 37:45.837
So just ask Me a question, "Mother, am I the
spirit?"

37:45.837 --> 37:47.736
We all have to become that.

37:47.736 --> 37:50.377
That is the epitome of our evolution.

37:50.377 --> 37:57.916
We all have to become the spirit.

37:57.916 --> 38:05.117
Now second position of the hand should be
on the stomach on the left hand side.

38:05.117 --> 38:08.567
We work on the left hand side.

38:08.567 --> 38:15.567
On the upper part of the stomach on the left
hand side you have to say again a question,

38:15.567 --> 38:19.127
"Mother, am I my own master?

38:19.127 --> 38:25.827
Am I my own guru," because logically if you
are the spirit you become your own master.

38:25.827 --> 38:30.567
All these great masters reside within us.

38:30.567 --> 38:34.597
So they bless you for that.

38:34.597 --> 38:40.667
Now with full confidence, without feeling
guilty, just ask Me a question, "Mother, am

38:40.667 --> 38:43.987
I my own master?

38:43.987 --> 38:45.926
Am I my own guru?"

38:45.926 --> 38:53.506
All the great gurus are there within us.

38:53.506 --> 39:01.607
This is a very important center.

39:01.607 --> 39:13.016
Now ask this question three times.

39:13.016 --> 39:36.067
Now take this right hand down on to the lower
part of the stomach, abdomen, and press it

39:36.067 --> 39:37.137
hard a little.

39:37.137 --> 39:43.207
This is a very important Swadhistana chakra
on the left hand side and it is related to

39:43.207 --> 39:49.647
the second part of yoga that I told you -- the
deftness, the technique of the true knowledge.

39:49.647 --> 39:54.796
Here I must confess I cannot cross your freedom.

39:54.796 --> 39:57.897
You are free to choose.

39:57.897 --> 40:05.016
So you have to ask that you want this true
knowledge and you have to say, "Mother, please

40:05.016 --> 40:07.587
give me my true knowledge.

40:07.587 --> 40:09.347
Give me Shuddha Vidya.

40:09.347 --> 40:13.996
Mother, give me true knowledge.

40:13.996 --> 40:17.716
Give me absolute knowledge.

40:17.716 --> 40:20.827
Give me pure knowledge."

40:20.827 --> 40:27.766
You have to say it six times because this
center has got six petals.

40:27.766 --> 40:38.137
These are like lotuses and they have six petals.

40:38.137 --> 40:49.246
In the same way it looks after the aortic
plexus in the gross and it has got six sub-plexuses.

40:49.246 --> 41:07.057
Now please raise your hand again back to the
same position on the stomach on the left hand

41:07.057 --> 41:13.827
side, that is the upper portion of the stomach,
upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand

41:13.827 --> 41:14.827
side, please, again.

41:14.827 --> 41:20.407
Putting the left hand there where it was.

41:20.407 --> 41:35.137
Now here again you have to assert because
you have asked for the true knowledge, so

41:35.137 --> 41:41.597
at this center of the guru there are ten gurus;
there are ten masters.

41:41.597 --> 41:46.337
Or we can say there are ten valences human
being have got.

41:46.337 --> 41:56.006
So, you put your hand on that center on the
left hand side and you have to ten times assert,

41:56.006 --> 42:01.407
"Mother, I am my own master.

42:01.407 --> 42:05.157
Mother, I am my own guru."

42:05.157 --> 42:06.707
That's what people don't like.

42:06.707 --> 42:16.377
They want to be subservient of somebody who
is not a realized soul because a realized

42:16.377 --> 42:26.546
soul never makes you subservient; he makes
you higher and higher.

42:26.546 --> 42:31.317
"Mother, I am my own guru."

42:31.317 --> 42:34.307
Say it ten times, please.

42:34.307 --> 42:36.857
Now please do not feel guilty.

42:36.857 --> 42:40.246
Even if you have been to wrong gurus, whatever
has happened has happened.

42:40.246 --> 42:41.387
Forget it.

42:41.387 --> 42:44.087
Don't blame yourself for that.

42:44.087 --> 42:48.807
Just say, "Mother, please make me my guru."

42:48.807 --> 42:55.167
First of all as you have said it, now you
say, "Mother, I am my own guru."

42:55.167 --> 43:18.107
Say it ten times.

43:18.107 --> 43:23.307
Now raise your right hand.

43:23.307 --> 43:24.746
It's like a play, I tell you.

43:24.746 --> 43:25.746
It's just a leela.

43:25.746 --> 43:27.367
It works out so well.

43:27.367 --> 43:30.766
Now put your right hand on the heart again.

43:30.766 --> 43:43.546
Now you have to assert ten times with full
confidence, "Mother, I am the spirit."

43:43.546 --> 43:45.467
With full confidence please say.

43:45.467 --> 43:46.837
Don't you worry.

43:46.837 --> 43:49.137
Many people think we have to cleanse this,
cleanse that.

43:49.137 --> 43:51.707
You leave it to Me, all those things.

43:51.707 --> 43:58.367
You just say whatever I tell you, please,
believing in yourself, "Mother I am the spirit."

43:58.367 --> 44:03.506
This you have to say twelve times because
this center has got twelve petals.

44:03.506 --> 44:22.127
This is the heart chakra, is called as the
anahat chakra, twelve times.

44:22.127 --> 44:40.327
Now raise this hand to the base of your neck
and place it on your shoulder from the front

44:40.327 --> 44:47.926
side in the corner where the neck and the
shoulder meet.

44:47.926 --> 44:49.776
Put it tight.

44:49.776 --> 44:54.726
This is the center gets caught up when you
feel guilty which is very badly caught up

44:54.726 --> 44:57.256
just now.

44:57.256 --> 45:01.546
What is there to feel guilty?

45:01.546 --> 45:08.847
Now take the hand from the front side, from
the front side on the left hand, front side,

45:08.847 --> 45:12.607
not this way across, front across.

45:12.607 --> 45:13.786
[Aside: No.

45:13.786 --> 45:23.307
Left hand towards Me and right hand like this
and hold it tight, yes.

45:23.307 --> 45:28.887
This gentleman is not knowing, you just - this
hand like this and this hand like that.

45:28.887 --> 45:30.216
Can you do it, please?

45:30.216 --> 45:31.496
Left hand towards Me.

45:31.496 --> 45:35.367
Yes, left hand towards Me like that, left
hand towards Me.

45:35.367 --> 45:38.006
Yes, correct and right hand here.

45:38.006 --> 45:40.067
That's good.

45:40.067 --> 45:44.357
Now this is a very important center what we
call the Vishuddhi chakra on the left hand

45:44.357 --> 45:45.357
side.

45:45.357 --> 45:50.526
Those who suffer from this center get all
the diseases like angina and rheumatic heart

45:50.526 --> 45:57.897
and all those things where there's a slow
movement of the circulation.

45:57.897 --> 46:05.206
So please say sixteen times, "Mother, I am
not guilty."

46:05.206 --> 46:12.807
You have to be pleasantly approaching towards
God's Kingdom, isn't it?

46:12.807 --> 46:14.167
You should be pleasant about it.

46:14.167 --> 46:22.536
What is there to be so sad or to be so gloomy
about?

46:22.536 --> 46:26.877
So just say, "Mother, I am not guilty," sixteen
times, and if you still continue with that

46:26.877 --> 46:34.397
kind of a thing is better that you say hundred
and eight times to punish yourself.

46:34.397 --> 46:38.187
Please say, "Mother, I am not guilty."

46:38.187 --> 46:42.397
Be pleasant about it.

46:42.397 --> 46:45.097
There's nothing to be upset about yourself.

46:45.097 --> 46:48.407
All the time you have condemned yourself for
nothing at all.

46:48.407 --> 46:56.786
Believe me, you have done nothing wrong that
cannot be forgiven by God because God is the

46:56.786 --> 46:58.796
ocean of love.

46:58.796 --> 47:01.726
He is the ocean of compassion.

47:01.726 --> 47:03.946
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

47:03.946 --> 48:11.786
What can you do that it cannot wash away these
little specks?

48:11.786 --> 48:17.936
Some people say that it is difficult to forgive
but just see what is the logic behind it.

48:17.936 --> 48:20.137
What do we do when we do not forgive?

48:20.137 --> 48:22.057
What do we do when we forgive?

48:22.057 --> 48:23.057
Nothing!

48:23.057 --> 48:24.057
It's a myth.

48:24.057 --> 48:25.676
We are just torturing ourselves.

48:25.676 --> 48:34.746
So just say, "Mother I forgive everyone,"
with your heart in it.

48:34.746 --> 48:38.406
Please forgive everyone.

48:38.406 --> 48:46.427
To forgive is Divine, and really, that's a
fact.

48:46.427 --> 49:01.226
You'll feel much lighter if you forgive.

49:01.226 --> 49:11.186
Now you have to put your hand on top of your
head for a while, just for a while, pressing

49:11.186 --> 49:21.587
the palm of your hand on top of the fontanel
area or the soft bone or the talu and press

49:21.587 --> 49:31.557
it in a clockwise manner and move it so that
your scalp also moves in a clockwise manner.

49:31.557 --> 49:33.417
Press it hard.

49:33.417 --> 49:35.726
Seven times you have to press it.

49:35.726 --> 49:42.307
Before that you just say without feeling guilty
again, without confidence before entering

49:42.307 --> 49:49.577
into the Kingdom of God that, "Oh God, please
forgive me if I have done any mistakes," but

49:49.577 --> 49:53.996
don't feel any way guilty about it.

49:53.996 --> 50:04.196
Just say it three times.

50:04.196 --> 50:16.877
Now here at the top of the head you have to
cross the gross into the subtle.

50:16.877 --> 50:19.587
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

50:19.587 --> 50:22.347
For that I cannot force you.

50:22.347 --> 50:23.756
I cannot push you in.

50:23.756 --> 50:25.177
You have to ask for it.

50:25.177 --> 50:29.906
So again you have to say, "Mother, I want
my realization.

50:29.906 --> 50:31.597
Please give me self-realization.

50:31.597 --> 50:35.206
Mother, please give me Atma Shakshatkaar."

50:35.206 --> 51:38.046
Just press it hard, seven times.

51:38.046 --> 51:43.877
Now you can take down your hand.

51:43.877 --> 51:46.046
Put your left hand on top of your head.

51:46.046 --> 51:51.016
Pay attention there, about four inches above.

51:51.016 --> 51:57.097
And now see if there's a cool breeze coming
out.

51:57.097 --> 52:15.097
Keep your eyes shut.

52:15.097 --> 52:45.766
[Mother breathes into the microphone] You
start feeling a cool breeze on top of your

52:45.766 --> 52:47.597
head.

52:47.597 --> 52:48.986
Just move it up and down.

52:48.986 --> 52:52.337
Now don't get upset you are not feeling it
-- Vishuddhi.

52:52.337 --> 52:59.637
If you are feeling any cool breeze, well and
good.

52:59.637 --> 53:04.147
Even it you are not feeling you should not
worry.

53:04.147 --> 53:06.197
There might be heat coming out.

53:06.197 --> 53:09.526
First, there's a lot of heat in the body.

53:09.526 --> 53:10.526
Let it come out.

53:10.526 --> 53:11.526
Let the heat come out.

53:11.526 --> 53:15.766
You can change your hand and see if there
is cool breeze coming in.

53:15.766 --> 53:22.367
If it is coming you can put down your hand.

53:22.367 --> 53:24.286
Little higher!

53:24.286 --> 53:33.867
Move it up and down or move backwards and
forwards.

53:33.867 --> 53:35.786
All right?

53:35.786 --> 53:36.786
Good.

53:36.786 --> 53:42.496
Now put your hands like this.

53:42.496 --> 53:48.946
Now putting the hands towards Me, you have
to ask Me a question again sixteen times,

53:48.946 --> 53:53.966
I am sorry, "Mother, am I the part and parcel
of the whole?

53:53.966 --> 54:00.837
Mother, am I the part and parcel of the whole?"

54:00.837 --> 54:28.137
[Aside: that will work out for Vishuddhi].

54:28.137 --> 54:37.206
Now I will tell you how to raise your own
Kundalini and keep it there because it has

54:37.206 --> 54:38.206
stuck.

54:38.206 --> 54:39.906
I know it has stuck.

54:39.906 --> 54:40.906
Still you may not feel it.

54:40.906 --> 54:43.276
Some may feel it.

54:43.276 --> 54:48.877
There are many Sahaja Yogis here who will
help you how to do it.

54:48.877 --> 54:54.666
They'll tell you, but there's very simple
which you should follow every day to raise

54:54.666 --> 54:58.006
your Kundalini and keep it in proper place.

54:58.006 --> 55:08.276
It's first of all, just hold it.

55:08.276 --> 55:16.776
You have to put your left hand in front of
your Kundalini, just like this, how to raise

55:16.776 --> 55:19.317
it.

55:19.317 --> 55:24.226
That is -- [Aside: should we give them a bandhan
first of all?

55:24.226 --> 55:25.226
All right!

55:25.226 --> 55:26.226
Doesn't matter.]

55:26.226 --> 55:32.157
Now you put your right hand here and go on
moving it just like that.

55:32.157 --> 55:34.637
Take it on top of your head.

55:34.637 --> 55:39.067
Push it back your head and make a -- that's
it.

55:39.067 --> 55:42.397
This is the first way we raise our Kundalini.

55:42.397 --> 55:45.436
Everybody should try because then they will
say, "We didn't feel it.

55:45.436 --> 55:46.436
We didn't have."

55:46.436 --> 55:47.436
It's very simple.

55:47.436 --> 55:52.057
Now this is what in the Bible they said that
when the Holy Ghost blessed them they started

55:52.057 --> 55:57.377
speaking in strange languages, means the languages
of the chakras, and they moving their hands

55:57.377 --> 55:58.417
in a funny manner.

55:58.417 --> 56:01.107
This is the way because that's how you raise
the Kundalini.

56:01.107 --> 56:02.957
Even the children were doing.

56:02.957 --> 56:04.077
I saw them.

56:04.077 --> 56:08.877
They are -- some of them are born realized
so they themselves were trying all the things,

56:08.877 --> 56:10.307
so -- but we are grown-ups, you see.

56:10.307 --> 56:12.087
So we are too much up here.

56:12.087 --> 56:16.186
Now let us be humbled down and take it.

56:16.186 --> 56:22.127
This is the first time we push back our head.

56:22.127 --> 56:23.127
That's one.

56:23.127 --> 56:24.607
Again second time.

56:24.607 --> 56:28.077
This is, we are raising our Kundalini.

56:28.077 --> 56:31.307
You'll see the vibrations will increase.

56:31.307 --> 56:32.477
Second time.

56:32.477 --> 56:36.536
Third time, three times we have to give, beautiful.

56:36.536 --> 56:44.417
Three times we have to give a knot, beautiful,
one, two and three.

56:44.417 --> 56:46.637
Now see your hands.

56:46.637 --> 56:48.637
Are they feeling cool breeze?

56:48.637 --> 56:57.166
In the hands, feeling it, yes.

56:57.166 --> 57:07.857
[Mother speaks in Hindi] If it is not coming
you should not be dishonest.

57:07.857 --> 57:09.286
You have to get it.

57:09.286 --> 57:11.107
You should not be dishonest to yourself.

57:11.107 --> 57:16.706
You should be kind to yourself and as a result
of that sometimes, you know, people think,

57:16.706 --> 57:18.157
"Oh, I haven't got it.

57:18.157 --> 57:19.157
So what!"

57:19.157 --> 57:20.357
It's nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

57:20.357 --> 57:21.357
It's something wrong with you.

57:21.357 --> 57:25.146
Either you are egoistical or you are conditioned.

57:25.146 --> 57:33.186
Either you are not well or there's something
going in your minds which is against, or some

57:33.186 --> 57:35.646
sort of a thing that works out.

57:35.646 --> 57:38.046
I have seen there was a gentleman who asked
me, "Why I can't get it?"

57:38.046 --> 57:44.146
He was a very frivolous man and I didn't want
to tell him that, "You are frivolous."

57:44.146 --> 57:59.756
Another one was thinking no end

57:59.756 --> 58:01.026
of himself.

58:01.026 --> 58:13.337
So just see if you are feeling.

58:13.337 --> 58:19.077
Is it so simple?

58:19.077 --> 58:27.756
[Mother speaks in Hindi] Taking the name of
Nanaka himself, you see, such a great primordial

58:27.756 --> 58:29.817
master born on this earth.

58:29.817 --> 58:34.906
Just taking his name itself, the Kundalini
rises.

58:34.906 --> 58:46.036
[Mother speaks in Hindi] He was the same as
Mohammed Sahib.

58:46.036 --> 58:47.196
He was the same as Abraham.

58:47.196 --> 58:52.796
He was the same as Moses.

58:52.796 --> 58:57.716
Why are you fighting?

58:57.716 --> 59:02.127
Just see this.

59:02.127 --> 59:08.286
All right, I am sorry I have to catch a train
because there is some sort of an emergency

59:08.286 --> 59:11.736
for Me to go to London but here is Warren.

59:11.736 --> 59:12.847
He is Dr Warren Reeves.

59:12.847 --> 59:17.397
I call him Warren because he is like my son,
he -- they are all My children.

59:17.397 --> 59:20.476
He is here to satisfy your mind.

59:20.476 --> 59:23.197
If you have any questions you can write to
him.

59:23.197 --> 59:25.847
If you have not felt the vibrations don't
go away.

59:25.847 --> 59:26.926
Raise your hands.

59:26.926 --> 59:32.827
There are at least here thirty to forty Sahaja
Yogis who have been imported.

59:32.827 --> 59:35.996
Now we have to import people from Birmingham
to London.

59:35.996 --> 59:38.897
So there are so many have come.

59:38.897 --> 59:41.607
Please just listen to them.

59:41.607 --> 59:43.506
You can outbeat them in no time.

59:43.506 --> 59:51.486
There is nothing to feel bad and this is how
you are going to achieve, that is being prophesized.

59:51.486 --> 59:55.166
And now you can ask a question, "Is there
God?"

59:55.166 --> 59:58.506
Ask a question, "Is the God miraculous?

59:58.506 --> 01:00:01.567
All the miracles of Christ -- are they correct?"

01:00:01.567 --> 01:00:07.196
Real, ask a question and you'll get the answer
as tremendous vibrations.

01:00:07.196 --> 01:00:11.286
You become a computer which is living computer.

01:00:11.286 --> 01:00:13.677
That's how you can prove everything.

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:15.976
Everything can be proved.

01:00:15.976 --> 01:00:18.486
May God bless you all.

01:00:18.486 --> 01:00:19.486
There are people here.

01:00:19.486 --> 01:00:21.627
Dr Warren will tell you about it.

01:00:21.627 --> 01:00:23.486
He is going to stay on.

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:28.067
He has given realization to I don't know how
many thousands people in Australia, but somehow

01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:30.496
Australians are very much in the center.

01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:33.696
I must say Australians are very different.

01:00:33.696 --> 01:00:37.397
English now think that they have punished
Australians; so now they are great.

01:00:37.397 --> 01:00:38.426
It's not so.

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:42.706
In Australia great saints are born.

01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:46.377
So in England also but we have to become.

01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:47.567
So the becoming is the point.

01:00:47.567 --> 01:00:51.687
We have a very nice center in Birmingham and
I've been coming to this hall I don't know

01:00:51.687 --> 01:00:54.516
how many times, and to Birmingham.

01:00:54.516 --> 01:00:57.946
I hope you people become the tree.

01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:01.497
Now the seed has sprouted but just don't give
it up.

01:01:01.497 --> 01:01:03.367
Become the tree.

01:01:03.367 --> 01:01:09.837
That's very important; otherwise it's just
a waste and is a sin against yourself if you

01:01:09.837 --> 01:01:10.837
do that.

01:01:10.837 --> 01:01:13.097
So may God bless you.

01:01:13.097 --> 01:01:15.886
I don't think you have questions.
