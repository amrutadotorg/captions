01:15.439 --> 02:05.790
A Sahajyogi gives introduction about Sahajyoga in Marathi.

02:05.814 --> 02:08.114
Clapping (Shree Mataji Comes to the stage)

02:08.138 --> 02:12.397
Adi Shakti Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi ki Jai!

02:12.422 --> 02:16.858
Adi Shakti Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi ki Jai!

02:16.882 --> 02:20.866
Adi Shakti Mataji Shree Nirmala Devi ki Jai!

02:20.891 --> 02:39.819
Music

02:39.856 --> 03:53.806
Music

03:53.831 --> 07:07.917
Welcome Song

07:07.942 --> 07:21.058
Song

07:21.083 --> 07:26.804
Dear Sahajyogis

07:26.829 --> 07:37.235
and those who have curiosity to know about Sahajyoga

07:37.260 --> 07:43.794
Today

07:44.192 --> 07:51.754
it is a holy occassion.

07:51.779 --> 07:55.437
Shree Mataji Nirmala Deviji is with us

07:55.462 --> 08:09.732
and will tell us about Kundalini awakening

08:09.757 --> 08:13.810
I know that those gentlemen who have come here

08:13.835 --> 08:18.101
are having a great difficulty because of the lack of space

08:18.126 --> 08:21.682
i would like to be excused

08:21.707 --> 08:24.648
for the discomfort they will have on account of the shortage of space

08:24.714 --> 08:29.455
but what you will get

08:29.480 --> 08:32.373
in these sessions from Mataji

08:32.398 --> 08:35.223
that will overcome all that discomfort.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.773
This is what i assure you

08:37.798 --> 08:39.434
but along with that

08:39.460 --> 08:45.455
What shall i say

08:45.480 --> 08:51.130
in appreciation of this compassionate and loving Mother

08:51.155 --> 08:53.365
can't say anything, can't understand anything,

08:53.390 --> 08:57.960
from where shall i start and how shall i start

08:59.500 --> 09:05.915
Mother, who is the source and ocean of compassion and  love

09:05.939 --> 09:09.233
who is sitting here among us

09:10.205 --> 09:19.181
To that thing for which our saints had said

09:19.208 --> 09:24.256
that Kundalini awakening is very tough

09:24.281 --> 09:28.599
and takes place only after a great effort.

09:28.624 --> 09:34.336
But Mother has made it so easy.

09:34.361 --> 09:41.352
If you are really eager to know or are seekers

09:41.377 --> 09:48.119
i assure you that today, before leaving this place

09:48.143 --> 09:50.652
you will get your realization. Thank you.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.899
without coming too much in between you and Mataji

09:53.924 --> 09:55.357
i shall request Mataji

09:55.382 --> 10:02.336
that She with Her compassionate and loving voice

10:02.361 --> 10:08.482
shall satisfy your inner desire.

10:08.507 --> 10:13.341
CLAPPING

10:13.366 --> 10:37.898
Shree Mataji, stands up to talk to seekers.

10:37.923 --> 10:40.346
The seekers of truth

10:46.719 --> 10:53.782
I bow respectfully to all the souls.

10:53.808 --> 10:59.952
Today I was thinking, in which language I should converse with you

10:59.977 --> 11:01.281
So, I thought that

11:01.306 --> 11:05.889
I have given speeches many times in Marathi in Poona

11:05.914 --> 11:08.898
and today let Me speak in Hindi

11:08.923 --> 11:14.080
as Hindi is our national Language.

11:14.105 --> 11:16.604
And My mother tongue is Marathi

11:16.629 --> 11:20.941
but I think that, learning Hindi language is most important.

11:20.966 --> 11:28.984
So you, lovers of Marathi Language, plz forgive Me liberally.

11:29.009 --> 11:33.539
and Hindi speaking people, who are literary

11:33.564 --> 11:37.854
also please forgive Me for My mistakes, if there are any.

11:37.879 --> 11:42.945
But first of all, you must understand that language should be of heart

11:42.970 --> 11:47.888
where language instead of being of heart, is only unintelligible

11:47.913 --> 11:52.272
then all types of troubles crop up.

11:52.297 --> 11:55.519
That is why any language which comes out of heart

11:55.544 --> 11:58.883
is touching and is effective.

11:58.908 --> 12:04.519
We have been in search of truth for the past so many years.

12:04.547 --> 12:06.342
It is not just today only.

12:06.367 --> 12:09.712
We have been in search of truth for the past so many years

12:09.737 --> 12:17.559
and in this process of search, many people have gone astray.

12:17.584 --> 12:20.254
We should understand its reason

12:20.279 --> 12:25.304
because today's situation, today's environment and today's atmosphere

12:25.329 --> 12:28.403
in that atmosphere one cannot understand that

12:28.428 --> 12:32.775
everybody talks about God, talk about dharma.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.013
Why do they create, so much dispute

12:34.038 --> 12:37.908
so much disaster and such a scene?

12:37.933 --> 12:43.632
This question arises in front of younger generation

12:43.657 --> 12:47.602
and they ask repeatedly, "Mother what does it mean?"

12:47.627 --> 12:55.914
If God is truth, if God is love, if God is kindness

12:55.939 --> 12:59.672
it doesn't seem, that there is any such blessing of God

12:59.697 --> 13:02.419
or there is any effect of God.

13:02.444 --> 13:08.495
So it is better to forget such God, who has created so much fuss.

13:08.520 --> 13:11.856
In this way, you can see that a big tussle is going on

13:11.881 --> 13:16.457
among our younger generation.

13:16.482 --> 13:19.162
The discussion is on, about God's existence.

13:19.187 --> 13:22.373
How to come to an agreement?

13:22.398 --> 13:26.814
You may agree or not, but there is God.

13:26.839 --> 13:29.363
It is not a question of agreement or disagreement.

13:29.388 --> 13:34.021
The truth will be, whether you accept it or not.

13:34.046 --> 13:38.580
But what is it that happened, because of which

13:38.605 --> 13:41.392
man follows wrong  paths

13:41.417 --> 13:45.209
where you do not find God even by searching.

13:45.657 --> 13:48.862
If we try to understand this

13:48.887 --> 13:52.314
Where did we make the mistake should be visible to us.

13:52.339 --> 13:58.507
Now  Sahajyoga is: Sahaja: Saha means 'with you', 'ja', means 'born'.

13:58.532 --> 14:03.975
Now the programme of Divine connection born with you

14:04.000 --> 14:07.755
which for you is the strategy of Divine connection

14:07.780 --> 14:11.128
not only this, it is an assurance for you.

14:11.153 --> 14:14.132
The time has come to prove that .

14:14.157 --> 14:16.817
Sahajyoga is not today's discovery.

14:16.842 --> 14:18.517
Thousand years back also

14:18.542 --> 14:23.682
Indra was given self realization and self knowledge.

14:23.707 --> 14:25.648
Even then there was Sahajyoga

14:25.673 --> 14:28.676
and after that you have seen that Markandey Swami

14:28.701 --> 14:31.489
who had come in this world 14000 years before

14:31.514 --> 14:34.349
also has said about the importance of Sahaj.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.446
But did not say it openly.

14:37.471 --> 14:42.129
After that, we can say that after many years

14:42.154 --> 14:47.737
Adi Shankaracharya openly talked about it to all the societies.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.564
Even then it was not said

14:49.589 --> 14:51.216
that how it happens.

14:51.241 --> 14:52.761
It was not fully explained

14:52.786 --> 14:54.256
because that was not the time.

14:54.281 --> 14:58.138
Krishna also said, that you should know Atma

14:58.163 --> 15:01.006
the one who has known his self, only can understand

15:01.031 --> 15:04.316
Christ also said, that there should be your second birth.

15:04.341 --> 15:07.571
Buddha, Mahavira, everybody said that

15:07.596 --> 15:09.713
there should be your second birth.

15:09.738 --> 15:13.557
But Adi Shankaracharya told it very openly

15:13.582 --> 15:16.217
that apart from this there is no other way.

15:16.242 --> 15:20.040
Unless cool vibrations will flow from within you

15:20.065 --> 15:23.138
till then he said, "SALEELAM, SALEELAM"

15:23.163 --> 15:26.134
we cannot get rid of this web of words.

15:26.159 --> 15:30.725
But I will say that Nanak Sahab and Kabirdas ji

15:30.750 --> 15:36.483
tried their best and presented the truth that

15:36.508 --> 15:40.204
without the awakening of Kundalini, nothing can be proved.

15:40.229 --> 15:45.501
But their way of talking was so emphatic and so strong

15:45.526 --> 15:47.815
that people could not understand them.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.648
This is what I felt that

15:50.673 --> 15:54.127
in this world, unless you give them knowledge of the self

15:54.152 --> 15:58.382
it will be almost useless to talk about it.

15:58.406 --> 16:02.616
For example, Gita was written. But the readers were mislead.

16:02.641 --> 16:04.999
After that, some thing more about knowledge was written.

16:05.024 --> 16:07.246
That too mislead the readers.

16:07.271 --> 16:10.534
But now it is, not to do anything

16:10.559 --> 16:12.583
to show anything or to say anything

16:12.608 --> 16:14.446
and keeping that in mind

16:14.471 --> 16:21.211
I have tried to find out, what are the problems of mankind?

16:21.236 --> 16:23.381
What are the obstacles?

16:23.406 --> 16:26.509
Because of which, he cannot recognize God

16:26.534 --> 16:30.223
and after working hard for a long period of My life

16:30.248 --> 16:32.737
one day, spontaneously I thought that

16:32.762 --> 16:35.228
by opening Sahastrara, everything will be alright

16:35.253 --> 16:39.034
and that is how our Sahajyoga was established.

16:39.059 --> 16:43.309
Now in nutshell, you must understand

16:43.334 --> 16:46.165
that this is a living process within us, a living process.

16:46.190 --> 16:50.213
As we have become human beings from an amoeba

16:50.238 --> 16:51.398
in the same way

16:51.423 --> 16:54.940
we have to become from a human being to a realized person

16:54.965 --> 16:57.456
and that too by a living process.

16:57.482 --> 17:00.288
There is no artificiality in it

17:00.313 --> 17:07.623
that it will happen by a bundle of words.

17:07.648 --> 17:09.777
it is an activity within the being.

17:09.802 --> 17:15.570
For example, if you want to grow a seed

17:15.595 --> 17:18.381
if sprout, has to come out

17:18.406 --> 17:21.245
you will have to put it in the heart of the mother

17:21.270 --> 17:26.910
you will have to put it into the womb of a mother earth.

17:26.935 --> 17:30.688
It gets sprouted, can you say how?

17:30.713 --> 17:34.026
You cannot say ,how a flower turns into a fruit.

17:34.051 --> 17:38.379
In this way, Sahajyoga

17:38.404 --> 17:40.504
is a strange happening

17:40.529 --> 17:44.323
but I can tell you, how it takes place.

17:44.348 --> 17:48.426
Because man's all workings must be known.

17:48.451 --> 17:52.890
So, you can know that within us the power of Kundalini

17:52.915 --> 17:56.997
which is settled in triangular bone

17:57.022 --> 18:00.977
when awakened, gives self realization.

18:01.002 --> 18:05.076
It is so surprising that while writing Geeta

18:05.101 --> 18:08.105
Gneshwari has been written, completely based on Geeta only

18:08.130 --> 18:15.917
Gyaneshwar ji in sixth chapter emphatically explained Kundalini.

18:15.942 --> 18:19.181
He has talked about it, discussed it and explained it beautifully

18:19.206 --> 18:21.003
Very beautifully explained

18:21.028 --> 18:25.719
and he has also said that when Kundalini will be awakened

18:25.744 --> 18:27.924
then people will be benifitted in such ways

18:27.949 --> 18:30.281
In that a very beautiful thing is

18:30.306 --> 18:33.187
Zo Jey Wanchele Te To laho

18:33.212 --> 18:34.907
you will get whatever you desire

18:34.932 --> 18:37.160
But a man's desire itself changes.

18:37.185 --> 18:40.299
His behaviour of desiring itself changes.

18:40.324 --> 18:43.410
Now, this Kundalini is situated within us.

18:43.435 --> 18:45.949
Now, if there are scientific people

18:45.974 --> 18:48.893
they will say, " How did you know this?"

18:48.918 --> 18:53.541
I know it, whether you agree or disagree

18:53.566 --> 18:57.703
but even if you are a scientist, you should keep your brain open.

18:57.728 --> 18:59.418
You should have open mindedness.

18:59.443 --> 19:02.744
If you are not open minded, you can never be a scientist.

19:02.769 --> 19:08.890
I am presenting a hypothesis before you

19:08.915 --> 19:12.770
if I prove that, then it becomes a rule.

19:12.795 --> 19:17.856
In the same way, Kundalini is a deep subject.

19:17.881 --> 19:22.030
and to acquire that deep subject, we must keep our mind open.

19:22.055 --> 19:24.465
If beforehand only, you stand with rods in your hands

19:24.490 --> 19:26.180
what shall I say?

19:26.205 --> 19:30.407
I have seen that such things happen only in the kingdom of God.

19:30.432 --> 19:33.518
You see, if you are going to join a college or a university

19:33.543 --> 19:35.795
how much do you struggle for admission?

19:35.820 --> 19:38.956
How many hurdles we overcome, to take admission

19:38.981 --> 19:42.406
we take admission and sit in front of our teachers

19:42.431 --> 19:43.353
with our necks bend down

19:43.378 --> 19:45.619
taking it for granted that whatever they will say, will be valid.

19:45.644 --> 19:50.251
But I have seen that all the saints who came into this world

19:50.276 --> 19:52.914
were tortured by us

19:52.939 --> 19:55.756
troubled them, did not listen to them

19:55.780 --> 20:02.707
bothered them and every time argumented with them.

20:02.732 --> 20:07.381
In this way, you cannot get knowledge.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.519
For getting knowledge, the first thing is that

20:09.544 --> 20:13.627
i have no knowledge and i have to know now.

20:13.652 --> 20:19.411
In all the Shastras, all the great saints have written about that.

20:19.436 --> 20:22.310
Ramdas Swami has clearly written that

20:22.335 --> 20:24.676
by reading, nothing is going to be achieved.

20:25.252 --> 20:28.458
Our Kabirdas ji has clearly written

20:28.483 --> 20:33.357
Padi Padi Pandit Moorakh Bhai.

20:33.382 --> 20:34.744
He has written clearly

20:34.769 --> 20:38.659
and lot of things these saints have written very clearly

20:38.684 --> 20:41.816
it is so surprising that we read their books

20:41.841 --> 20:44.911
how do we do only, what they have forbidden.

20:44.936 --> 20:49.623
Now, I will tell you the reason as to why that happens

20:49.648 --> 20:56.904
and because of this how our dharma somehow changes into adharma.

20:56.929 --> 21:00.060
Kundalini Shakti is pure desire.

21:00.125 --> 21:05.481
This is pure desire means all other desires are impure desires.

21:05.506 --> 21:07.206
Because had it not been impure

21:07.231 --> 21:08.645
on getting one

21:08.670 --> 21:10.578
there would not have been the desire for getting other things.

21:10.603 --> 21:16.722
According to the laws of our Economics, laws of Artha Shastra

21:16.747 --> 21:20.501
any type of necessity is not fullfilled normally.

21:20.526 --> 21:25.095
Means in general these cannot be satisfied.

21:25.120 --> 21:29.896
In general, means that if you get one thing in particular

21:29.921 --> 21:31.388
but after getting that

21:31.427 --> 21:34.167
if you want to get second thing and then third thing

21:34.192 --> 21:37.953
its reason is that you don't have pure desire.

21:38.059 --> 21:42.629
The desire for which you strive hard to be fullfilled

21:42.654 --> 21:45.049
that desire is not pure desire, it is impure desire.

21:45.073 --> 21:50.640
The power of pure desire is this Kundalini, which has made this PINDA

21:50.665 --> 21:52.827
and after that is sitting just like that

21:52.852 --> 21:55.008
because it has not been awakened as yet

21:55.033 --> 22:00.889
it has not been manifested perfectly within us, as yet

22:00.914 --> 22:02.474
so that it shows its effect.

22:02.499 --> 22:06.307
This pure desire is settled in our triangular bone

22:06.332 --> 22:10.786
which we call  kundalini because it has three and a half circles.

22:10.811 --> 22:12.268
Why is she sitting in three and a half circle

22:12.293 --> 22:13.629
what is the mathematical explanation of it, etc.

22:13.654 --> 22:16.889
I don't have that much time today, to explain it

22:16.914 --> 22:18.833
If you listen to My lectures

22:18.858 --> 22:22.076
you will find that, I have explained everything very clearly.

22:22.101 --> 22:25.640
Now, this power of Kundalini is Pure Desire.

22:25.665 --> 22:31.610
So the pure desire when awakened within us, what do we see

22:31.635 --> 22:34.532
that while passing through our chakras inside our being

22:34.557 --> 22:41.950
it remains unattatched and nourishes nicely to our chakras

22:41.975 --> 22:46.121
and if we look at it logically, it is right

22:46.146 --> 22:48.023
that inside a tree

22:48.048 --> 22:53.552
when its inner fluid (sap) grows and clings to any spot

22:53.577 --> 22:55.723
and if it dies, even in any one thing

22:55.748 --> 22:59.231
the tree as well as that thing will be dead.

22:59.256 --> 23:03.669
In the same way, when this Kundalini awakens within us

23:03.694 --> 23:05.570
and starts moving ahead

23:05.595 --> 23:09.999
this pure desire, keeps away other impure desires.

23:10.024 --> 23:14.079
But our routine remined just the opposite of it

23:14.104 --> 23:16.542
when we took a turn towards dharma.

23:16.567 --> 23:19.093
First of all, when we take a turn towards dharma

23:19.118 --> 23:21.372
or towards anything

23:21.397 --> 23:25.941
first, our physical relation comes in contact with them.

23:25.966 --> 23:30.785
We analyse what physical or material benifits we can get out of it.

23:30.809 --> 23:33.773
We see, as soon as people come to our house

23:33.798 --> 23:36.947
first of all we observe, what beniffits we can have out of it.

23:36.971 --> 23:38.333
What can we do with it?

23:38.358 --> 23:39.840
Even people think that

23:39.865 --> 23:45.792
it is better that we grab somebody's money, do this, do that

23:45.817 --> 23:47.711
and then by and by

23:47.736 --> 23:49.817
such things start taking shape

23:49.842 --> 23:52.699
which are virtually rubbish and hellish.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.558
The attention goes towards body.

23:54.583 --> 23:57.027
When a man's attention goes towards his body

23:57.052 --> 23:58.605
then it is not in his pure desire.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.041
It is so simple.

24:00.065 --> 24:03.830
then in the body, then change the dresses, change the name

24:03.855 --> 24:05.366
and do all types of worldly things

24:05.391 --> 24:07.675
can not establish dharma.

24:07.700 --> 24:10.792
So, man went on going astray

24:10.817 --> 24:14.456
so, the second catch that a man gets and is a very strong catch

24:14.481 --> 24:17.310
that is mental, means on wisdom.

24:17.334 --> 24:20.208
(NOT CLEAR) you know that

24:20.233 --> 24:26.706
how much, one very great intellectualist, tortured Adi Shankaracharya

24:26.731 --> 24:28.704
Always such intellectualists

24:28.729 --> 24:30.425
never understand how much they adhere to their intellect.

24:30.450 --> 24:33.261
They adhere to what they read

24:33.286 --> 24:35.674
If any one has read Gita

24:35.699 --> 24:38.730
he thinks, that he has become Vyas Munni atleast.

24:38.755 --> 24:41.792
if not greater than him but atleast i have become Vyas Munni.

24:41.817 --> 24:44.133
If somebody reads Bible, he feels that

24:44.158 --> 24:46.749
he thinks that Christ knows better than him

24:46.774 --> 24:50.062
This intellectual catch when it comes within us

24:50.087 --> 24:51.890
that gives rise to all the more questions.

24:51.915 --> 24:53.670
This whole Christian religion

24:53.695 --> 24:57.609
has come to an end because of this intellectual catch.

24:57.634 --> 25:01.499
You visualise how this intellectual catch came into it.

25:01.524 --> 25:04.223
When Christ came into this world

25:04.248 --> 25:06.655
He said ,"Take your rebirth."

25:06.680 --> 25:07.961
At that time Nicodemus said

25:07.986 --> 25:10.882
"Shall i enter again into my mother's womb?"

25:10.907 --> 25:14.593
He (Christ) said, "No,he who takes birth from womb, he is still JADDA."

25:14.618 --> 25:19.308
"But one takes birth from ATMA, from ADISHAKTI only is atma."

25:19.333 --> 25:23.370
unless you know atma, you cannot know God.

25:23.395 --> 25:26.293
But they thought that it was not clear

25:26.318 --> 25:31.324
because none of them knew to give realization

25:31.349 --> 25:32.911
Anyway, even if they didn't know

25:32.936 --> 25:36.779
there was no need of making a mess of intellectuality.

25:37.020 --> 25:38.753
He made such a mess of intellectualism

25:38.778 --> 25:41.112
there was a person named St. Paul

25:41.137 --> 25:43.560
who had no link with Christian Religion

25:43.585 --> 25:45.045
He had not seen Christ

25:45.070 --> 25:47.838
He himself was epileptic and used to be sick

25:47.863 --> 25:51.141
and in My view he had some Supraconscious problems

25:51.166 --> 25:53.048
he took his entry in Bible.

25:53.073 --> 25:54.954
When I first read Bible

25:54.979 --> 25:56.501
I asked ,"who is this gentleman?"

25:56.526 --> 25:59.775
Not only I, Khalil Jibran, and so many people

25:59.800 --> 26:04.360
You must be knowing that William Blake was a great seer.

26:04.385 --> 26:07.881
At that time, he said why is this (Mr. Paul) in Bible?

26:07.906 --> 26:10.159
And after they settled him in Bible

26:10.184 --> 26:13.846
whatever he wrote about Bible, they validated.

26:13.871 --> 26:16.320
Now he is in such a condition

26:16.345 --> 26:22.738
that, when an intellectual came across Bible and came to know that

26:22.763 --> 26:25.773
Paul, has not written anything about the birth of Jesus

26:25.798 --> 26:27.774
had not written anything about his mother.

26:27.799 --> 26:31.234
He didn't write anything about his miracles.

26:31.259 --> 26:36.905
He said that his disciples were fishermen

26:36.930 --> 26:39.788
would catch fishes and were fish killers.

26:39.812 --> 26:40.883
He didn't have any wisdom.

26:40.908 --> 26:43.409
He said so, just from from his own mind

26:43.434 --> 26:48.617
and to support this, Bishop of Cantebury

26:48.642 --> 26:52.058
too had to help him and say that it is okay.

26:52.083 --> 26:55.538
So, now you either follow Paul or Jesus.

26:55.563 --> 26:58.061
He (Bishop of Cantebury) said that he (Paul) is right.

26:58.086 --> 27:00.284
'Jesus was born', was wrong

27:00.309 --> 27:03.065
also it was wrong to say that there were some miracles (of Jesus).

27:03.090 --> 27:04.492
Mr. Paul was okeyed.

27:04.517 --> 27:07.998
This Paul took his birth as Augustine

27:08.023 --> 27:13.005
and he made an intellectual and argumentative Christian Religion

27:13.030 --> 27:14.170
that whatever may happen

27:14.195 --> 27:15.344
even at the cost of holding guns in hands

27:15.369 --> 27:16.610
would convert everyone to a Christian.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.895
To become a Christian means to become a Sahajyogi.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.130
To become a Yogi.

27:22.155 --> 27:24.116
Same is the case with Muslims.

27:24.141 --> 27:26.281
What Mohammad Sahab had written

27:26.306 --> 27:29.565
was turned so much upside down and made Muslim religion.

27:29.590 --> 27:31.296
The same is the case with Hindus.

27:31.321 --> 27:33.296
The situation of Hindus is the very bad.

27:33.321 --> 27:34.843
Because they didn't create one dharma

27:34.868 --> 27:35.786
they created fifty dharmas.

27:35.810 --> 27:39.488
I can't understand when shall we learn a lesson.

27:39.513 --> 27:43.789
First of all, it has been said that Atma lies in everyone.

27:43.814 --> 27:45.875
Then how was caste system evolved?

27:45.900 --> 27:48.117
Caste system has no meaning

27:48.142 --> 27:52.187
because caste system was created on the basis of profession.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.539
and since this caste system was made on the basis of birth

27:54.564 --> 27:56.074
this mess started.

27:56.099 --> 28:00.182
It is not possible at all that it will be according to birth

28:00.207 --> 28:03.645
Vyas wrote Geeta. who was Vyas?

28:03.670 --> 28:08.250
Everybody knows that he was the son of a  DIMARNI, who was not married.

28:08.275 --> 28:09.908
Can he be a Brahmin?

28:09.933 --> 28:13.559
Valmiki, who wrote Valmiki Ramayana, who was he?

28:13.584 --> 28:17.179
The great people who wrote Shastras, who were they?

28:17.204 --> 28:20.758
Brahmin is he who knows Bramha.

28:20.783 --> 28:23.608
Those who don't know Bramha, cannot be called Bramha.

28:23.633 --> 28:26.883
But we are Brahmins by birth, even though we may do any work

28:26.908 --> 28:28.823
We have become (Brahmins) by birth, okay.

28:28.848 --> 28:32.117
Now even our elections are also held on the basis of Caste system

28:32.142 --> 28:34.074
So, may God protect this country.

28:34.099 --> 28:35.403
What shall be its result?

28:35.428 --> 28:37.656
Because the caste in which you are born

28:37.681 --> 28:39.890
JAA-TI, Jati means Sahaj.

28:39.915 --> 28:43.368
Sahaj, that which is Sahaj (spontaneous) in you

28:43.392 --> 28:46.844
One who is in search of God is Brahmin

28:46.869 --> 28:52.016
and the person who seeks joy in bussiness is Vaishya.

28:52.041 --> 28:53.969
In this way, all the castes were classified

28:53.994 --> 28:56.867
and so much importance was given to those castes

28:56.892 --> 28:59.399
that we had Gora Kumbhar.

28:59.424 --> 29:02.820
In this Maharashtra, there is so much alertness

29:02.845 --> 29:05.704
they have made his full statue, Gora became Kumbhar.

29:05.729 --> 29:06.893
Tukaram said

29:06.918 --> 29:07.821
"It would have been better

29:07.846 --> 29:08.916
had i become MAHAAR(untouchable)."

29:08.941 --> 29:13.338
All the saints repeatedly spoke against caste system

29:13.363 --> 29:16.097
Not only this, Gyaneshwar Ji was tortured.

29:16.122 --> 29:19.473
All these intellectuals who considered themselves as

29:19.498 --> 29:23.709
entrepreneurs of God, everything and that of religion

29:23.734 --> 29:25.257
tortured them ( Saints) badly.

29:25.282 --> 29:27.099
And now they are writing his Gyaneshwari.

29:27.124 --> 29:28.180
He is being worshipped.

29:28.205 --> 29:29.645
They are making a temple of Gyaneshwar Ji.

29:31.666 --> 29:32.740
Its reason is that

29:32.765 --> 29:38.046
there was a great need of intellectual intelligence and not of Spirit

29:38.071 --> 29:39.627
There should be knowledge of spirit.

29:39.652 --> 29:43.154
All the saints have said, "Recognize your spirit."

29:43.224 --> 29:50.014
Namdev Sahab who was a great poet and had limitless knowledge.

29:50.039 --> 29:54.017
He has written a beautiful poetry

29:54.042 --> 29:56.703
Which was recognized by Nanak Sahab

29:56.728 --> 29:59.217
and included in Guru Granth Sahab

29:59.242 --> 30:01.168
which I will explain you in Hindi.

30:01.193 --> 30:06.672
He says that when a person gets one with God

30:06.697 --> 30:11.658
his condition is like a child whose attention is on a kite

30:11.683 --> 30:13.312
he is flying.

30:13.337 --> 30:15.469
the kite is fluttering in the sky

30:15.494 --> 30:17.340
He used Marathi word 'FARARI' (flutter)

30:17.365 --> 30:19.577
the kite is spinning after fluttering

30:19.757 --> 30:22.761
and this child is talking to others

30:22.786 --> 30:24.608
playing and running forward and backward

30:24.633 --> 30:29.987
but at that time, his attention is on that kite.

30:30.012 --> 30:31.927
Second thing, he said that

30:31.952 --> 30:35.776
when the ladies return back after filling their pitches (with water)

30:35.801 --> 30:39.208
are walking faster and talking among themselves

30:39.233 --> 30:41.352
and their pots are on their heads

30:41.377 --> 30:44.366
laughing and joking is going on, among themselves

30:44.391 --> 30:47.169
but, their attention is on the pot on their heads.

30:47.194 --> 30:49.409
So, it is worth understanding

30:49.434 --> 30:51.239
that those who are talking about dharma

30:51.264 --> 30:54.460
should get their self realization first.

30:54.485 --> 30:57.683
Otherwise, they don't have any right to get their self realization.

30:57.708 --> 31:04.151
And have no right to say that they are self realized.

31:04.176 --> 31:06.979
They may say to themselves that they are very great

31:07.004 --> 31:08.618
and give self certificate to themselves

31:08.643 --> 31:10.990
but its recognition is that

31:11.015 --> 31:14.535
a realized person must have

31:14.560 --> 31:17.045
collective consciousness inside his being.

31:17.070 --> 31:18.819
He should have collective consciousness inside his being.

31:18.844 --> 31:21.561
If he doesn't have that collective consciousness inside his being

31:21.586 --> 31:24.018
how much self certifition he may give himself

31:24.043 --> 31:26.826
even then he is not a self realized soul.

31:26.851 --> 31:29.067
And it is important that

31:29.092 --> 31:30.751
the nurturers of dharma

31:30.776 --> 31:34.866
those who can maintain dharma, should be self realized.

31:34.891 --> 31:37.485
It is only their right to discuss about dharma.

31:37.510 --> 31:40.982
Those who have not received that light till now

31:41.007 --> 31:43.310
have not received the light of the spirit

31:43.335 --> 31:46.583
those who are standing in the dark, what shall they talk about

31:46.608 --> 31:48.164
there will be discussion only about darkness

31:48.189 --> 31:50.695
or what shall a blind man say

31:50.720 --> 31:53.410
which colours or which art is lying here?

31:53.435 --> 31:57.194
So first, one's own eyes should get opened

31:57.219 --> 32:01.320
and that eye can be known only through the vision of the spirit.

32:01.345 --> 32:03.907
Even in Gita it is written, ATMANE  ATMANE TUSHTAHA

32:03.932 --> 32:05.931
Atma gets satisfied only by atma.

32:09.339 --> 32:13.323
Third catch is the worst, useless!

32:13.348 --> 32:17.315
in which, a person gets attatched to someone by his emotions

32:17.340 --> 32:20.948
emotions which we sometimes take for SHRADHA.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.846
But this is not SHRADHA, this is blind devotion.

32:22.871 --> 32:25.049
People move with blind devotion.

32:25.074 --> 32:26.709
Blind devotion means such

32:26.734 --> 32:28.795
When Jesus came

32:28.820 --> 32:32.370
people said that, we follow Moses because Moses had died.

32:32.395 --> 32:35.543
Now we follow Moses, we don't believe in Jesus.

32:35.568 --> 32:39.240
For example, Jews said we don't believe in Jesus

32:39.265 --> 32:41.053
We believe only in Moses.

32:41.078 --> 32:42.927
At that time Moses was not there.

32:42.952 --> 32:46.438
And that is why, Moses had said that we should suffer

32:46.463 --> 32:48.766
So, we will suffer

32:48.791 --> 32:51.811
although our whole suffering was about to come to an end.

32:51.836 --> 32:53.667
But they said," No, we will suffer".

32:53.692 --> 32:56.687
So, it is okay! Hitler came for you, and you better suffer.

32:56.712 --> 33:01.261
This was their basic difference, that we must suffer.

33:01.286 --> 33:03.152
Now what you have to suffer?

33:03.177 --> 33:06.515
What wrong things you have been taught?

33:06.540 --> 33:10.575
That you have to suffer always.

33:10.600 --> 33:13.844
God, who has given you this man's body

33:13.869 --> 33:17.315
why should He give you trouble and worries?

33:17.340 --> 33:21.829
When your mother gave you birth, she took all the trouble

33:21.854 --> 33:23.722
she didn't give you any trouble.

33:23.747 --> 33:26.030
Then to raise such issues

33:26.055 --> 33:27.978
in our Maharashtra, this is very special

33:28.003 --> 33:29.804
today is Monday and so it is fast day

33:29.829 --> 33:31.446
tomorrow is tuesday, and so fast day

33:31.471 --> 33:33.267
next day is wednesday and so fast day

33:33.292 --> 33:34.937
and something other, so fasting day.

33:34.962 --> 33:36.870
That means in our country, there are so many people fasting

33:36.895 --> 33:38.189
so why do you fast?

33:38.214 --> 33:41.303
But in our country, there is a disease of keeping fasts

33:41.328 --> 33:42.809
that too they will do in those days

33:42.834 --> 33:48.921
the day our some great incarnations took birth.

33:48.946 --> 33:52.255
For example, in our country, we observe SANKASHTI

33:52.280 --> 33:53.501
the day when Ganeshji was born.

33:53.526 --> 33:54.527
That day they will keep fast.

33:54.552 --> 33:57.991
If a child is born in your house, will you keep fast

33:58.016 --> 33:58.767
or observe SUTAK ( Impurity arising to the members of a family on account of that birth )

33:58.792 --> 34:01.955
or distribute sweets.

34:01.980 --> 34:04.647
Everything upside down they would talk

34:04.672 --> 34:09.497
that by being emotional, by torturing ourselves, we can know God.

34:09.522 --> 34:12.812
We know God by torturing ourselves

34:12.837 --> 34:13.805
as Shiyas do.

34:13.830 --> 34:15.982
People are absolutely mistaken.

34:16.007 --> 34:19.271
On the contrary, those who are joyful, they only can know God.

34:19.296 --> 34:20.617
For example, in English it is said

34:20.642 --> 34:22.393
"Count your blessings one by one ".

34:22.418 --> 34:24.164
Those who think of the blessings

34:24.189 --> 34:25.583
"How much God has given me".

34:25.608 --> 34:27.013
He gets connected to God.

34:27.038 --> 34:29.818
One who sees oneself in  distress

34:29.843 --> 34:32.759
you only say, if any mother sees her child

34:32.784 --> 34:34.536
that he is dying of hunger

34:34.561 --> 34:36.794
what can be more distressing than this, for a mother.

34:36.819 --> 34:38.589
She will say that my birth has been useless

34:38.614 --> 34:40.310
if my child remains hungry.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.560
There can be nothing more painful that this.

34:42.585 --> 34:45.466
Okay, if you want to fast, do so there is no harm

34:45.491 --> 34:47.396
you do it for your good health

34:47.421 --> 34:50.234
but there is no need to fast, in the name of God.

34:50.259 --> 34:53.521
This emotional feeling, that we are very sad.

34:53.546 --> 34:57.453
Second feeling that we have got a great faith on God.

34:57.478 --> 34:59.544
When Rama came

34:59.569 --> 35:02.349
people said, we follow Parshuram

35:02.374 --> 35:05.189
when Krishna came, people said, we follow Rama

35:05.214 --> 35:07.435
and now when anyone else will come

35:07.460 --> 35:09.552
people will say that they are following Krishna.

35:09.577 --> 35:12.150
Is Krishna standing in front of you today?

35:12.175 --> 35:14.307
You should also think , who is standing in front of you?

35:14.332 --> 35:16.733
We don't have the trend of being in the present.

35:16.758 --> 35:23.103
To remain in the past thoughts, is to be sentimental

35:23.128 --> 35:28.682
Sentimentalist go so much mad, that we see

35:28.707 --> 35:35.777
both intellectuals and sentimentalists become fanatics.

35:35.802 --> 35:40.443
Fanaticism only gets glued to sentiments

35:40.468 --> 35:44.648
and that feeling becomes too much, it is blind faith

35:44.673 --> 35:45.874
It is blind faith

35:45.899 --> 35:50.015
because of which, man gets glued to one thing

35:50.040 --> 35:52.337
he gets destroyed in his pure desire.

35:52.362 --> 35:55.044
For example, a stream flows down into sand

35:55.069 --> 35:56.213
and comes to an end.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.545
In the same way, our pure desire

35:58.570 --> 36:00.384
is to get one with God.

36:00.409 --> 36:03.186
In the same way, comes to an end in this or that.

36:03.757 --> 36:07.529
In this way, because of our blind faith, there has been great loss.

36:07.554 --> 36:08.823
A great loss!

36:08.848 --> 36:13.387
And the greatest loss is that now by getting separated

36:13.446 --> 36:14.584
have fallen apart.

36:14.609 --> 36:19.981
There is no arrangement of connecting

36:20.006 --> 36:22.903
all that of falling apart, of separation

36:22.928 --> 36:25.739
arrangements of separation have been made.

36:25.764 --> 36:28.129
But when our evolution takes place

36:28.154 --> 36:30.915
You see when our ascent takes place

36:30.940 --> 36:34.366
when we reach our heigher and higher states

36:34.391 --> 36:36.164
integration should take place.

36:36.189 --> 36:38.739
There should be integration.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.579
If integration within us doesn't take place

36:40.604 --> 36:42.700
we should understand that we are falling apart.

36:42.725 --> 36:45.006
If for getting our integration

36:45.031 --> 36:47.109
something has to be done, should be done

36:47.134 --> 36:51.184
and there is only one way for integration and that is Atma.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.985
As soon as we get that

36:53.010 --> 36:55.574
when Kundalini comes in contact with the enlightened atma

36:55.599 --> 36:57.364
then everything gets aside

36:57.389 --> 37:01.266
and in that light man sees how beautiful is the other too.

37:01.291 --> 37:03.751
And then he also starts observing

37:03.776 --> 37:08.454
in the collective consciousness, who is the other.

37:08.479 --> 37:13.626
When you are part and parcel of that Virat, who is the other?

37:13.651 --> 37:16.008
What favour we are doing to the other?

37:16.033 --> 37:16.893
Everybody is ours.

37:16.918 --> 37:20.352
They are our hands, our feet and our eyes only.

37:20.377 --> 37:22.637
But the arrangements that we have made

37:22.662 --> 37:24.769
that with one hand you take out your eye

37:24.794 --> 37:27.895
with the other hand cut your nose and yet with another cut your ear.

37:27.920 --> 37:31.433
and then after holding one ear, say we are Dharmic

37:31.458 --> 37:33.160
the other holding his nose, say we are Dharmic

37:33.818 --> 37:35.933
In this there is not even a bit of dharma.

37:35.958 --> 37:38.066
When a person gets involved in fanaticism

37:38.091 --> 37:40.423
he should know that there is not even a bit of dharma in it.

37:40.448 --> 37:42.891
Till you do not have integrated knowledge

37:42.916 --> 37:45.817
that comes only with the light of the Spirit.

37:45.842 --> 37:49.598
Nobody, none of the saints said

37:49.623 --> 37:52.460
that don't get your realization

37:52.485 --> 37:54.112
otherwise, today

37:54.137 --> 37:56.690
had there been even a single person like that by mistake,

37:56.715 --> 37:58.799
people would have publicly announced.

37:58.824 --> 38:02.718
But by God's grace, how much did they tolerate.

38:02.743 --> 38:07.173
They always said, get your realization.

38:07.198 --> 38:11.328
To get this realization we do many things.

38:11.353 --> 38:15.926
In Sahajyoga we see that, many type of people come in every country.

38:15.951 --> 38:18.952
The dacoits and plunderers who had gone from here

38:18.977 --> 38:22.798
they in their saintly attire, made fool of people

38:22.823 --> 38:24.751
and by making fool of them

38:24.776 --> 38:28.102
they were even told that if you take GANJA, you will know God.

38:28.127 --> 38:30.182
The poor ones take GANJA ( intoxicated drink ) also.

38:32.486 --> 38:34.487
Their blind faith is so much that

38:34.512 --> 38:35.977
they are ready to do, whatever they are told to do.

38:36.002 --> 38:38.505
Somebody told them,"You undress yourself, you will meet God".

38:38.530 --> 38:39.693
They undressed themselves.

38:39.718 --> 38:43.289
So in this way, everywhere if you observe

38:43.314 --> 38:47.742
you can see that every type of compulsion

38:47.767 --> 38:53.069
and a blind man is forcibly put  into a well

38:53.094 --> 38:57.320
and when the well is constructed twenty five people engage in

38:57.345 --> 39:01.481
it is but natural that there can be a big outbreak

39:01.506 --> 39:04.696
because of that there can be a great conflict

39:04.721 --> 39:06.579
because of that, there can be a fight.

39:06.604 --> 39:08.664
Not only this, there can be severe violence as well.

39:08.689 --> 39:10.967
In this way, throw everyone into well

39:10.992 --> 39:13.008
and occupied and possessed it

39:13.033 --> 39:14.799
that we are abbeys of this monastery

39:14.824 --> 39:16.177
we are the Pope of this place

39:16.202 --> 39:19.168
we are so and so of this place.

39:19.193 --> 39:25.289
Even a very great boon of Zen started by Viditama

39:25.314 --> 39:26.895
which is highly valuable

39:26.920 --> 39:29.867
and he would talk at a very great level.

39:29.892 --> 39:32.430
But I saw their leaders

39:32.455 --> 39:33.949
their Kundalini was lying at the base

39:33.974 --> 39:34.507
and they were not even realized.

39:34.532 --> 39:35.639
I asked them how are you ZEN?

39:35.664 --> 39:37.410
The meaning of ZEN is

39:37.435 --> 39:41.387
Z means 'GYANA', means who knows

39:41.412 --> 39:43.526
I asked them, where are you sitting?

39:43.551 --> 39:44.628
How is it?

39:44.653 --> 39:47.035
He said, we have twenty six Kashyaps.

39:47.060 --> 39:48.620
Since then there has been no Kashyap.

39:48.645 --> 39:49.988
How could I be so?

39:50.013 --> 39:52.191
All this came to an end in twelfth century.

39:52.216 --> 39:53.422
There were total twenty six.

39:53.447 --> 39:55.339
I asked him , "Why are you then sitting on that seat?"

39:55.364 --> 39:57.122
"You are sitting on this seat."

39:57.147 --> 39:58.444
"And what is your right?"

39:58.469 --> 40:00.266
In the same way, it is of 'VEDA'.

40:00.291 --> 40:02.449
In 'VEDA' it is written in the first shaloka itself

40:02.474 --> 40:05.641
the one who gets ' VIDA' has the right to 'VEDA'.

40:05.666 --> 40:08.257
The one who doesn't have 'VIDA'

40:08.282 --> 40:11.586
one who hasn't experienced, how is 'VED' going to help him.

40:11.611 --> 40:14.074
What is the meaning of having 'VIDA'?

40:14.099 --> 40:18.285
'VIDA' means the knowledge of consciousness that is inside us.

40:18.310 --> 40:20.114
If we say in English

40:20.139 --> 40:23.832
it is on our central nervous system, we must know our spirit.

40:23.857 --> 40:27.339
If we don't know it on our central nervous system

40:27.364 --> 40:28.981
it is not VIDA ( pure  knowledge on our central nervous system).

40:29.006 --> 40:33.259
All that we have acquired in our evolution

40:33.284 --> 40:36.947
all that we observe on our central nervous system.

40:36.972 --> 40:41.005
By self realization, how much we are benifitted

40:41.030 --> 40:42.979
many, limitless, I can't tell you.

40:43.004 --> 40:48.059
But tomorrow I will tell you what are the advantages of this.

40:48.084 --> 40:50.604
Because, a man first of all checks advantages.

40:50.629 --> 40:54.434
This a mother must know that children take first of all, chocolates.

40:54.459 --> 40:57.386
So, first benifit them and then make them understand

40:57.436 --> 41:00.559
that by progressing forward like this

41:00.584 --> 41:01.913
you can help others also to be benifitted.

41:01.938 --> 41:08.911
When others get benifitted, then you can understand the reality

41:08.936 --> 41:11.337
what you have acquired from Sahajyoga?

41:11.362 --> 41:13.817
Till then you feel that i am selfish

41:13.842 --> 41:16.313
that i am for myself only, i take care of myself only

41:16.338 --> 41:17.959
i can't do anything for others.

41:17.984 --> 41:22.464
When you start giving it to others, then you feel the real joy.

41:22.489 --> 41:25.006
In our country, we have lot of controvercies.

41:25.031 --> 41:26.497
People have raised controvercies

41:26.522 --> 41:28.208
over each and every great incarnation.

41:28.233 --> 41:30.242
But the reality nobody knows.

41:30.267 --> 41:34.158
For example, may be in Geeta, they did not talk about Kundalini

41:34.183 --> 41:36.439
because it was not the time to discuss about it.

41:36.464 --> 41:38.594
But they made it clear that

41:38.619 --> 41:42.665
"Yogakshema vahamyam", first get your yoga and then kshema.

41:42.690 --> 41:45.684
Such an organization is from time immemorial

41:45.709 --> 41:47.380
which bestowed this union of God.

41:47.405 --> 41:50.495
Here in Maharashtra, there was Nath Sampraday

41:50.520 --> 41:53.047
which granted people this union of God.

41:53.072 --> 41:56.489
But just one or two people would get realization those days.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.068
You know during the time of Raja Janaka

41:59.093 --> 42:01.367
only one person named NACHIKETA was given realization

42:01.392 --> 42:02.725
and that too after a lot of testing.

42:02.750 --> 42:07.177
And even here, there are some Gurus who can grant it

42:07.202 --> 42:10.099
But just one or two were granted realization, because at that time

42:10.124 --> 42:16.031
it was the beginning of our tree, out religious tree.

42:16.056 --> 42:18.890
At that time, only one or two flowers would lay on it.

42:18.915 --> 42:21.722
But wherever there were such great saints

42:21.747 --> 42:23.448
by using their lot of efforts

42:23.473 --> 42:25.671
by taking them into wrong notions

42:25.696 --> 42:27.691
we made our own communities

42:27.716 --> 42:32.301
which had physical, mental or intellectual problems

42:32.326 --> 42:34.071
and there was no dharma.

42:34.096 --> 42:37.689
Because dharma gives balance to a man.

42:37.714 --> 42:40.083
That should give balance to a person.

42:40.108 --> 42:42.145
He should become balanced.

42:42.170 --> 42:46.055
If a man doesn't become balanced, he is not dharmic.

42:46.080 --> 42:49.169
He remains imbalanced and that is bad.

42:49.193 --> 42:51.161
Dharma was given for being in balance.

42:51.186 --> 42:53.118
Because if there has to be your improvement

42:53.143 --> 42:56.856
If you want your ascent, first of all you should be balanced.

42:56.881 --> 42:59.399
NOT CLEAR

42:59.424 --> 43:01.211
if they are completely balanced

43:01.236 --> 43:02.825
He will surely save them

43:02.849 --> 43:05.044
but we do not balance ourselves.

43:05.069 --> 43:07.559
There can be no balance within us

43:07.584 --> 43:09.655
because we live in controversial dharma

43:09.680 --> 43:11.538
or in some blind faith

43:11.563 --> 43:15.016
or get busy with some puja physically

43:15.041 --> 43:16.595
that doesn't help dharma to get inside us.

43:16.620 --> 43:20.964
First of all, you must balance yourself.

43:20.989 --> 43:22.028
Look inside yourself.

43:22.053 --> 43:22.911
Are we balanced?

43:22.936 --> 43:25.755
And when you want to balance yourself

43:25.780 --> 43:28.832
right now you think, let us be balanced

43:28.857 --> 43:30.563
let us not go to any extreme.

43:30.588 --> 43:35.059
You get wisdom in a Sahaj way

43:35.084 --> 43:39.438
and the greatest thing in our India is that

43:39.463 --> 43:42.244
the land of this country is in itself, land of saints.

43:42.269 --> 43:43.889
It is a holy land.

43:43.914 --> 43:46.726
You took your birth here, how great it is?

43:46.751 --> 43:47.776
You don't know this.

43:47.801 --> 43:49.635
Once, I was coming from London.

43:49.660 --> 43:54.298
On our way, as soon as we crossed this holy land

43:54.323 --> 43:58.551
I told My husband that we have touched our India.

43:58.576 --> 43:59.500
He asked Me , "How do you know"?

43:59.525 --> 44:00.664
I told him,"You go and enquire".

44:00.689 --> 44:05.020
Pilot told him," We touched India's boundry just one minute before,"

44:05.045 --> 44:08.158
Because I could see vibrations all around

44:08.183 --> 44:09.500
in this India only

44:09.525 --> 44:11.873
and what to talk about Maharashtra.

44:11.898 --> 44:14.293
When Ramchander ji had come in this Maharashtra

44:14.318 --> 44:16.193
even then, He had taken off His Shoes

44:16.218 --> 44:17.677
and walked in this pure land of Maharashtra.

44:17.702 --> 44:20.912
This pure land gave birth to lot of saints

44:20.937 --> 44:24.269
but even about that, we have made a lot of hypocrisy.

44:24.294 --> 44:27.134
They said, that in every home there must be a Guru.

44:27.159 --> 44:29.424
Being a guru means that he has been released from jail

44:29.449 --> 44:31.577
wore yellowish-red garments and has become a guru.

44:31.602 --> 44:33.176
There should be a Satguru.

44:33.201 --> 44:35.703
and it is said, 'JO SAHIB MILE'

44:35.728 --> 44:38.867
he one who will connect you to God, he is Satguru.

44:38.892 --> 44:40.755
But every man has become a master.

44:40.780 --> 44:43.277
Even his appearance does not show that he is a guru.

44:43.301 --> 44:49.117
Such an appearance that you count his each wrinkle

44:49.142 --> 44:51.594
He looks like a dead person

44:51.619 --> 44:54.491
A sick person, he is himself getting diseases.

44:54.516 --> 44:59.018
if not such, then of another type, who is so because of swelling

44:59.043 --> 45:00.344
grabs money from others

45:00.369 --> 45:02.339
and teaches them dirty things

45:02.364 --> 45:03.849
teaches them adharm.

45:03.874 --> 45:07.324
It is good that many such people have gone to America

45:07.349 --> 45:08.478
let them thrive there only.

45:08.503 --> 45:10.993
They can thrive well in that culture.

45:11.018 --> 45:13.570
They cannot thrive well in India.

45:13.595 --> 45:15.550
For sometime they will thrive, but then they will have to go.

45:15.575 --> 45:17.443
They cannot thrive here.

45:17.468 --> 45:20.447
Second thing is that, we are very lucky people

45:20.472 --> 45:23.641
that our Indian culture has a very great culture

45:23.666 --> 45:27.446
because they always hold God in high esteem.

45:27.471 --> 45:29.146
When I was young, I remember since then

45:29.171 --> 45:32.280
My Mother used to say, " LAXYA KUTE, Where is your attention?"

45:32.305 --> 45:33.601
" where is your attention?"

45:33.626 --> 45:35.115
To control one's attention

45:35.140 --> 45:39.390
in our Shastras, in our Dharma, in our culture

45:39.415 --> 45:42.932
children are taught this from their childhood, pay your attention.

45:42.957 --> 45:45.417
Foreign culture is such that

45:45.442 --> 45:50.707
you believe Me, kills humans slowly.

45:50.769 --> 45:53.564
First of all, mess up his attention

45:53.589 --> 45:56.510
and after that, impair his purity

45:56.535 --> 46:00.429
and instill within him all, filthy thoughts and grab money.

46:00.454 --> 46:03.006
Because, until you have some drawbacks

46:03.031 --> 46:04.663
how can their industries run?

46:04.688 --> 46:07.962
Make such industries so that

46:07.987 --> 46:10.295
money be grabbed from people unnecessarily.

46:10.320 --> 46:11.912
So that they be made stupid

46:11.937 --> 46:13.763
and be grabbed

46:13.788 --> 46:15.754
whatever may be, they be put to an end.

46:15.779 --> 46:18.750
You see even the science you have made

46:18.775 --> 46:21.313
what did even that make, it is an Atomic Bomb.

46:21.338 --> 46:24.671
It is all foolishness that after putting in so much of hard work

46:24.696 --> 46:27.970
that we made Atomic Bomb, to destroy us only.

46:27.995 --> 46:29.627
to put an end to ourselves only.

46:29.652 --> 46:30.825
Why did we make such a thing?

46:30.850 --> 46:31.966
After all what is the problem?

46:31.991 --> 46:34.765
Within us there is also power that is JADDA.

46:34.790 --> 46:36.705
Which we want to convert into Atma

46:36.730 --> 46:39.036
and the JADDA SHAKTI wants to convert it back to JADDA

46:39.061 --> 46:41.063
It is easy to go towards JADDA

46:41.087 --> 46:42.508
To move upwards is difficult

46:42.533 --> 46:45.556
but it is easier to jump downwards

46:45.581 --> 46:47.691
That is why a man goes very fast towards JADDA

46:47.716 --> 46:51.246
and by going towards JADDATA how can you rise ?

46:51.271 --> 46:54.817
It is our Indian Culture itself, in the whole world

46:54.869 --> 46:57.223
that raises you upwards.

46:57.248 --> 46:59.547
In every sphere you are raised upwards.

46:59.572 --> 47:02.251
And to rise upwards only is your aim

47:02.276 --> 47:04.698
The rest of the life is zero.

47:04.723 --> 47:07.058
It is pointless, it has no meaning.

47:07.083 --> 47:10.038
The life which moves you upwards

47:10.063 --> 47:15.042
by superior methods raise to noble thoughts

47:15.067 --> 47:17.802
that is the real life for you.

47:17.827 --> 47:21.028
The rest is artificial, which we should give up.

47:21.053 --> 47:23.890
All the saints did a lot of work.

47:23.915 --> 47:26.293
But when I was born I saw

47:26.318 --> 47:29.077
that they were trying to attack even the saints.

47:29.102 --> 47:32.745
For example, the intellectuals have started a new discussion

47:32.770 --> 47:36.847
that Shankaracharya has not at all written Saundarya Lahiri.

47:36.950 --> 47:40.696
Then Communists say , "Shankaracharya was hocus-pocus."

47:40.721 --> 47:44.417
People were attatcking all of them, when they were alive.

47:44.442 --> 47:46.769
Now they are trying to attack them even after their death.

47:46.794 --> 47:51.222
The reason is that they are not yet free from their ego.

47:51.247 --> 47:54.129
That is why, their desire glued to their ego

47:54.154 --> 47:55.612
even now bothers them.

47:55.637 --> 47:58.253
You should detach yourself from that ego.

47:58.277 --> 48:01.540
And when a man will stand leaving his ego aside

48:01.565 --> 48:05.195
he will see that there in lies his KSHEMA, his well being

48:05.220 --> 48:08.259
here in lies his ascent, this is what he should get.

48:08.284 --> 48:10.455
All other things that are useless.

48:10.480 --> 48:14.012
Why did we go on quarelling, fighting and arguing?

48:14.037 --> 48:15.442
Afterwards when he understands

48:15.467 --> 48:18.854
"Oh God! how much time did I waste over useless things."

48:18.879 --> 48:22.855
All of you may get this benifit, this benifit of spirit

48:22.880 --> 48:26.843
you may get your self realization, is My pure desire.

48:26.938 --> 48:29.429
And with the grace of God, when it happens

48:29.454 --> 48:32.905
it should be understood that just seed has sprouted.

48:32.930 --> 48:36.125
Just the sprouting of a seed

48:36.150 --> 48:40.095
you can even destroy it or make a tree out of it.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.632
But there should be humility.

48:41.657 --> 48:44.381
Give up your ego and proceed with humility

48:44.406 --> 48:46.852
and try to understand how should it be attained.

48:46.877 --> 48:49.484
some people have given up their so many venues

48:49.509 --> 48:52.192
got over their goals and have reached great heights.

48:52.217 --> 48:54.254
Some people are sitting there only.

48:54.279 --> 48:58.630
It is so surprising that in Sahajyoga, some people progress a lot

48:58.655 --> 49:02.922
Some people are sitting and settled only on the earth.

49:02.947 --> 49:06.714
So, we should keep in mind that after getting it

49:06.739 --> 49:08.763
whatever position we may be in

49:08.788 --> 49:11.437
however rich we may be, poor or whatever we may be

49:11.462 --> 49:14.486
today we have got self realization, all of us are on one level.

49:14.511 --> 49:18.722
After this we should raise our level, move upwards.

49:18.747 --> 49:23.048
Those who have money, or have position, or are poor

49:23.073 --> 49:24.415
everybody's situation is same.

49:24.440 --> 49:26.481
I don't see any markable difference.

49:26.506 --> 49:31.331
Best thing is, that you come to this level and get your realization.

49:31.356 --> 49:34.635
Without that, your country's powerty, even cannot be overcome and

49:34.660 --> 49:36.657
black marketting cannot be controlled

49:36.682 --> 49:42.946
except that, we cannot get rid of the drawbacks of adminstration.

49:42.971 --> 49:44.858
The anarchy and whatever drawbacks there are

49:44.883 --> 49:46.735
everything you can get rid of with the help of this.

49:46.760 --> 49:49.478
There is no other way to man's ascent.

49:49.503 --> 49:51.714
After all only man is doing everything.

49:51.739 --> 49:53.931
If a man gets rectified

49:53.956 --> 49:56.444
his spirit gets awakened

49:56.469 --> 49:59.446
and he will have the knowledge of God's love

49:59.471 --> 50:02.759
then you will see, how much difference it will bring forth.

50:02.784 --> 50:06.601
How much change it will bring forth, in the whole country.

50:06.626 --> 50:12.136
But there is only one problem, how many people want it?

50:12.161 --> 50:16.739
They think that there is a little life, do whatever you want.

50:16.764 --> 50:19.811
Life is too long, have immortal life.

50:19.836 --> 50:23.122
To live a momentary life, won't make any difference.

50:23.147 --> 50:27.322
So, I request everyone

50:27.347 --> 50:34.519
I am a mother, My urge is that you somehow try to understand it

50:34.544 --> 50:37.269
Now the time has come of this ascent

50:37.294 --> 50:41.250
this last jump of our last evolution

50:41.275 --> 50:44.667
in which, we awaken in our collective consciousness

50:44.692 --> 50:46.085
we awaken in our ATMA

50:46.110 --> 50:48.400
the time has come to get it

50:48.425 --> 50:50.831
to skip it doesn't make any sence.

50:50.856 --> 50:54.354
It makes no sense to mislead people right now.

50:54.379 --> 50:56.905
Whatever has happened, has happened forget it.

50:56.930 --> 50:59.018
You descend into this infinity.

50:59.043 --> 51:03.079
You should enter into the kingdom of God.

51:04.239 --> 51:10.173
clapping

51:10.198 --> 51:13.268
Now, if you have any question, you ask 2-4 questions

51:13.293 --> 51:14.564
but don't ask too many.

51:14.589 --> 51:15.528
and second thing is that

51:15.553 --> 51:17.823
there is no need to express your anger to Me.

51:17.848 --> 51:22.368
I have not come here to bother you in any way.

51:22.393 --> 51:31.399
let them ask one or two more questions.

51:31.424 --> 51:35.121
There are many intellectuals in Pune

51:35.146 --> 51:48.826
If you want to ask anything about it, please tell

51:48.851 --> 51:58.794
Seeker: What is the difference between Gyana and Yoga?

51:58.819 --> 52:05.849
Any other question?

52:05.874 --> 52:13.060
Has anyone, any other question?

52:13.085 --> 52:19.671
There is one more gentleman.

52:19.696 --> 52:23.458
Marathi

52:23.483 --> 52:28.466
Sahajyog..........?

52:28.491 --> 52:32.888
What is Sahajyog, he wants to know.

52:32.913 --> 52:37.279
Marathi

52:37.304 --> 52:46.201
Marathi

52:46.226 --> 52:56.341
Marathi

52:56.366 --> 53:06.052
Marathi

53:06.077 --> 53:25.883
Marathi

53:25.908 --> 53:31.117
Marathi

53:31.142 --> 53:36.711
Marathi

53:36.736 --> 53:42.914
Marathi

53:42.939 --> 54:01.213
Marathi

54:01.238 --> 54:05.472
Talk in Marathi to Marathis, then they enjoy.

54:05.497 --> 54:07.302
Otherwise also, this Marathi language is

54:07.327 --> 54:13.143
very good, perfect language for this subject., is perfect language.

54:13.168 --> 54:15.985
According to Me, a lot has been written about this topic

54:16.010 --> 54:18.815
In no other language has been written so much about Kundalini

54:18.840 --> 54:22.049
as in Marathi language.

54:22.074 --> 54:28.580
Marathi

54:28.605 --> 54:41.643
Marathi

54:41.667 --> 54:48.746
Marathi

54:48.771 --> 54:56.692
Marathi

54:56.717 --> 55:00.512
Marathi

55:00.537 --> 55:08.301
Marathi

55:08.326 --> 55:12.207
Marathi

55:12.232 --> 55:17.762

55:17.787 --> 55:24.309

55:24.334 --> 55:28.254

55:28.279 --> 55:36.754

55:36.779 --> 55:42.137

55:42.162 --> 55:48.333
Marathi

55:48.358 --> 55:56.145
Marathi

55:56.170 --> 56:02.528

56:02.553 --> 56:10.981

56:11.006 --> 56:24.162

56:24.187 --> 56:36.861

56:36.886 --> 56:47.532
Marathi

56:47.557 --> 57:13.367
Marathi

57:13.392 --> 57:22.954
Marathi

57:22.979 --> 57:29.024
Marathi

57:29.049 --> 57:44.742
Marathi

57:44.767 --> 57:55.694
Marathi

57:55.719 --> 58:02.069
Marathi

58:02.094 --> 58:08.092
Marathi

58:08.117 --> 58:13.772
Marathi

58:13.797 --> 58:41.515
Marathi

58:41.540 --> 58:43.257
There is all pervading power of God.

58:43.282 --> 59:04.946
Marathi

59:04.970 --> 59:46.730
Marathi

59:46.755 --> 01:00:11.826
Marathi

01:00:11.851 --> 01:00:13.633
Come forward.

01:00:13.658 --> 01:00:18.880
Marathi

01:00:18.905 --> 01:00:29.901
Marathi

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:57.622
Marathi

01:00:57.647 --> 01:01:00.766
You can write it down. Tomorrow I will answer it.

01:01:00.791 --> 01:01:17.208
Marathi

01:01:17.233 --> 01:01:24.235
Marathi

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:55.943
Marathi

01:01:55.968 --> 01:02:43.902
Marathi

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:56.902
Marathi

01:02:56.927 --> 01:03:37.895
Marathi

01:03:37.920 --> 01:04:01.889
Marathi

01:04:06.211 --> 01:05:07.322
Marathi

01:05:07.347 --> 01:05:21.899
Marathi

01:05:21.924 --> 01:05:36.924
Marathi

01:05:36.949 --> 01:06:05.261
Marathi

01:06:05.286 --> 01:07:05.937
Marathi

01:07:05.962 --> 01:07:44.508
Marathi

01:07:44.533 --> 01:08:07.628
Marathi

01:08:07.653 --> 01:09:44.342
Marathi

01:09:44.367 --> 01:10:51.517
Marathi

01:10:51.542 --> 01:11:58.324
Marathi

01:11:58.349 --> 01:12:59.889
Marathi

01:12:59.914 --> 01:14:13.045
Marathi

01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:53.768
Marathi

01:14:53.793 --> 01:14:55.829
Now you take out your shoes.

01:14:55.854 --> 01:14:58.039
Do not put questions for that.

01:14:58.093 --> 01:14:59.750
Mother, why are you asking us to take out our shoes?

01:14:59.775 --> 01:15:03.943
It is because we are going to be benifitted by this earth.

01:15:03.968 --> 01:15:08.498
Our PRITHVI MATA is solving our half the questions.

01:15:08.523 --> 01:15:13.961
Don't know poor (Mata), since when is tolerating our sins beforehand?

01:15:13.986 --> 01:15:19.008
Take out your shoes.

01:15:19.033 --> 01:15:20.375
Second thing is that

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.717
you are sitting in front of Mother

01:15:21.742 --> 01:15:23.244
there is no need to put on a cap.

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:25.024
We don't put on a cap in front of our Mother.

01:15:25.049 --> 01:15:27.286
Had there been a Prime Minister, it would have been a different thing.

01:15:27.311 --> 01:15:29.316
I am your Mother.

01:15:29.341 --> 01:15:53.899
There is no formality with a mother.

01:15:53.975 --> 01:15:57.831
It is the work of these two hands only

01:15:57.855 --> 01:16:00.307
and out of these only, these powers flow.

01:16:00.332 --> 01:16:03.616
So, you put your left hand

01:16:03.641 --> 01:16:06.972
in your lap.

01:16:06.997 --> 01:16:16.514
Marathi

01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:26.169
Marathi

01:16:26.194 --> 01:16:38.540
Marathi

01:16:38.565 --> 01:16:43.235
Marathi

01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:51.499
Marathi

01:16:51.524 --> 01:17:20.385
Marathi

01:17:20.410 --> 01:17:34.581
Marathi

01:17:34.605 --> 01:17:49.931
Marathi

01:17:49.956 --> 01:17:54.364
Please remember one thing that your thoughts about yourself

01:17:54.389 --> 01:17:57.523
that you always feel that you made this mistake and that mistake

01:17:57.548 --> 01:18:00.856
and that we are great sinners or are very miserable

01:18:00.881 --> 01:18:03.234
all these thoughts you leave outside.

01:18:03.602 --> 01:18:08.335
You think that, you are going to  be in God's kingdom

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.542
and for this you should be joyful.

01:18:10.955 --> 01:18:12.528
You should be joyful.

01:18:12.553 --> 01:18:17.120
One who is not joyful, tell Me how can he go to the kingdom of God.

01:18:17.145 --> 01:18:20.674
Yes, those who are crying people, will at best be sent to jail.

01:18:20.699 --> 01:18:24.653
But those who are joyful, only they can go to the kingdom of God.

01:18:24.678 --> 01:18:30.443
Don't be angry with yourself. You are temple of God.

01:18:30.468 --> 01:18:34.751
In that, only light has to be given, your Spirit has to be awakened

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:36.018
only that much is to be done.

01:18:36.062 --> 01:18:37.630
Rest you are temple yourself.

01:18:37.655 --> 01:18:42.441
Keeping this in mind, have faith on yourself and close your eyes.

01:18:42.466 --> 01:18:44.647
But put your left hand towards Me

01:18:44.672 --> 01:18:49.590
and right hand you will have to use.

01:18:49.615 --> 01:18:58.323
Marathi

01:18:58.348 --> 01:19:12.838
Marathi

01:19:12.863 --> 01:19:30.606
Marathi

01:19:30.631 --> 01:19:45.396
Marathi

01:19:45.421 --> 01:19:55.113
Marathi

01:19:55.138 --> 01:20:22.234
Marathi

01:20:22.259 --> 01:20:26.036
Put your left hand towards Me

01:20:26.061 --> 01:20:30.254
Right hand you have to put on different chakras.

01:20:30.279 --> 01:20:34.278
First on heart, after that on the upper portion of your belly

01:20:34.303 --> 01:20:35.823
after that on the lower part of your abdomen

01:20:35.848 --> 01:20:38.113
everything will be on the left side, everything on the left side

01:20:38.138 --> 01:20:39.768
Marathi

01:20:39.792 --> 01:20:46.321
after that back to the upper part of abdomen, then to heart

01:20:46.346 --> 01:20:49.001
then here on the neck, to hold it firmly

01:20:49.026 --> 01:20:52.472
after that here to hold on the forehead like this

01:20:52.497 --> 01:20:57.606
at the back and the head

01:20:57.631 --> 01:21:00.651
and then here on head where there is Bramharandra

01:21:00.676 --> 01:21:02.987
which we call palm of hand

01:21:03.012 --> 01:21:06.849
putting palm on (head) and to rotate it seven times.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:08.372
In this way these things

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:11.709
At that time, what you should say and what you should pray

01:21:11.734 --> 01:21:13.262
I will tell you every time

01:21:13.287 --> 01:21:17.834
after listening to it carefully, please do it.

01:21:17.859 --> 01:21:22.342
And now don't look at others , look at yourself.

01:21:22.367 --> 01:21:27.733
So, have full confidence and complete faith about yourself

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:29.649
Close your eyes.

01:21:29.674 --> 01:21:34.522
There is no one here who can not get self realization.

01:21:34.547 --> 01:21:39.459
Marathi

01:21:39.484 --> 01:21:51.123
Marathi

01:21:51.148 --> 01:22:04.118
Marathi

01:22:04.143 --> 01:22:07.015
Close your eyes. Do not open your eyes

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.926
because your attention will not rise.

01:22:10.951 --> 01:22:12.579
Everybody please (close your eyes).

01:22:12.604 --> 01:22:17.032
All of you, put your right hand on your heart.

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:21.709
It will  also take away the heart problem of many people.

01:22:21.795 --> 01:22:29.092
Now , after putting your hand on heart, ask Me a question.

01:22:29.117 --> 01:22:31.847
Mother, "Am i the spirit"?

01:22:31.872 --> 01:22:33.607
Because it is the place of Atma.

01:22:33.632 --> 01:22:41.912
Marathi

01:22:41.937 --> 01:22:55.291
Marathi

01:22:55.316 --> 01:22:58.339
Do not open your eyes. You are not to open your eyes at all.

01:22:58.364 --> 01:23:01.161
Please keep them shut. Please!

01:23:07.557 --> 01:23:09.904
Am I the spirit?

01:23:09.929 --> 01:23:14.225
Marathi

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:42.774
Marathi

01:23:42.799 --> 01:23:52.112
Marathi

01:23:52.158 --> 01:23:58.323
Now this hand you slowly put on the upper part of the stomach

01:23:58.348 --> 01:24:00.949
on the left side and press it.

01:24:00.974 --> 01:24:01.908
Marathi

01:24:01.933 --> 01:24:04.805
This chakra is of Guru.

01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:10.840
All the great saints, the rebirths of Adi Guru many a times

01:24:10.865 --> 01:24:12.516
have their seats here.

01:24:12.552 --> 01:24:14.870
When you said ,"I am the spirit"

01:24:14.895 --> 01:24:16.606
ask another question

01:24:16.631 --> 01:24:18.751
the boon that those gurus have given you

01:24:18.776 --> 01:24:20.910
that you too can be your own guru.

01:24:20.935 --> 01:24:22.935
so, you have to ask one question

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:39.561
Marathi

01:24:39.586 --> 01:24:41.799
Here you have to ask a question that

01:24:41.824 --> 01:24:45.291
"If i am Atma, am i my own guru also?"

01:24:45.316 --> 01:24:49.416
So, you ask," Mother am i my own guru"?

01:24:49.441 --> 01:25:30.314
Marathi

01:25:30.339 --> 01:25:36.523
Now you take this hand towards downwards of your belly

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:41.369
and press it, but towards left side.

01:25:41.394 --> 01:25:45.044
In the lower part of the abdomen, on the left hand side

01:25:45.069 --> 01:25:48.791
press your fingers.

01:25:48.816 --> 01:26:21.773
Marathi

01:26:21.798 --> 01:26:40.500
Marathi

01:26:40.525 --> 01:26:45.457
Now, after keeping your hand below your belly, you should know that

01:26:45.482 --> 01:26:48.070
this Swadishthana chakra on your left side

01:26:48.095 --> 01:26:54.363
it leads to, does the creative work of God

01:26:54.388 --> 01:26:58.981
And so, this knowledge is called pure knowledge.

01:26:59.006 --> 01:27:05.793
So, you have to say, "Mother please give me pure knowledge".

01:27:05.818 --> 01:27:25.991
Marathi

01:27:26.016 --> 01:27:29.488
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

01:27:29.513 --> 01:28:01.067
Marathi

01:28:01.092 --> 01:28:02.817
Say this six times.

01:28:02.842 --> 01:28:04.997
Give me pure knowledge.

01:28:05.022 --> 01:28:08.965
I fully respect your independance.

01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:30.567
So, you will have to say. I can't force you.

01:28:30.591 --> 01:28:32.178
Will start now.

01:28:32.203 --> 01:28:35.030
Now kundalini awakening is starting

01:28:35.055 --> 01:28:38.041
so we are going to start the opening of chakras one by one.

01:28:38.066 --> 01:28:41.060
Now you only are awakening your kundalini

01:28:41.085 --> 01:28:47.572
Left hand towards Me, don't open your eyes and then this hand up

01:28:47.597 --> 01:28:52.041
on your belly, where you had put it at first

01:28:52.066 --> 01:28:56.181
on the upper portion, on the left side keep it on your Gurutatwa

01:28:56.206 --> 01:29:16.934
Marathi

01:29:16.959 --> 01:29:24.463
With full confidence, till you don't say, chakras won't open

01:29:24.488 --> 01:29:25.989
"Mother i am my own master".

01:29:26.014 --> 01:29:41.192
Marathi

01:29:41.262 --> 01:29:43.465
No, showmanship.

01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:57.019
Marathi

01:29:57.044 --> 01:30:04.050
This time, your right hand on your upper part of belley, say ten times

01:30:04.075 --> 01:30:07.425
"Mother i am my own guru".

01:30:07.450 --> 01:31:14.229
Marathi

01:31:14.254 --> 01:31:27.233
Marathi

01:31:27.257 --> 01:31:35.258
Now, put your right hand on your heart

01:31:35.282 --> 01:31:42.148
and here you have to say with great confidence

01:31:42.173 --> 01:31:50.022
that, "Mother i am the spirit".

01:31:50.046 --> 01:32:01.072
Marathi

01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:29.257
You have to assert yourself. you have to assert. Your will power is to be asserted.

01:32:29.281 --> 01:32:43.862
Marathi

01:32:43.887 --> 01:32:59.018
Say it twelve times. This chakra has twelve plexes.

01:32:59.043 --> 01:33:09.328
Marathi

01:33:09.353 --> 01:33:19.960
Complete alertness is required. Alertness.

01:33:19.985 --> 01:33:29.025
Now put your right hand on your neck.

01:33:29.050 --> 01:33:34.665
Marathi

01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:39.092
Where your neck and shoulder meet.

01:33:39.117 --> 01:33:41.388
I am telling in a very common language.

01:33:41.413 --> 01:33:44.249
It is not a difficult language.

01:33:44.274 --> 01:33:53.651
to keep it there and to hold it, hold it forcefully, this shoulder

01:33:53.675 --> 01:34:00.644
And those who think," I am very guilty, i have made a great mistake"

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:04.747
that is very wrong. That causes many diseases.

01:34:04.771 --> 01:34:06.213
So, you say

01:34:06.238 --> 01:34:10.344
"Mother, i am not guilty, i have not made any mistake at all".

01:34:10.369 --> 01:34:16.847
Say it sixteen times. " I am not guilty".

01:34:16.872 --> 01:34:42.003
Marathi

01:34:42.028 --> 01:34:50.835
Marathi

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:54.591
God, who is the ocean of love forgives everything.

01:34:54.647 --> 01:34:57.812
Which such mistake you can make, that He cannot forgive.

01:34:57.837 --> 01:34:59.100
Take your hand from the front.

01:34:59.125 --> 01:35:07.032
Marathi

01:35:07.057 --> 01:35:10.741
Take your hand from the front, not from the back.

01:35:10.766 --> 01:35:15.699
not from the back, take it from the front to the opposite shoulder.

01:35:15.724 --> 01:35:26.639
It has to be kept towards the left shoulder.

01:35:26.664 --> 01:35:28.812
It has lot of catches.

01:35:28.837 --> 01:35:33.984
It means that while sitting here

01:35:34.009 --> 01:35:38.715
you think what mistakes you have done.

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:39.911
If you are thinking like that

01:35:39.936 --> 01:35:43.714
then, say 108 times and get yourself a little bit punished.

01:35:43.739 --> 01:36:06.984
Marathi

01:36:07.009 --> 01:36:21.994
Marathi

01:36:22.019 --> 01:36:25.274
Now the same hand put it

01:36:25.299 --> 01:36:29.674
on your forehead diagonally and hold your forehead.

01:36:29.699 --> 01:36:33.458
Marathi

01:36:33.483 --> 01:36:36.866
Hold it the way you hold it when you have headache.

01:36:36.890 --> 01:36:40.164
Now you should say from your heart

01:36:40.188 --> 01:36:46.580
Mother, I forgive everyone, Mother, I forgive everyone.

01:36:46.605 --> 01:36:47.906
Say it from your heart.

01:36:47.931 --> 01:36:51.003
Some may say, "I cannot forgive, it is very difficult."

01:36:51.027 --> 01:36:53.526
Nothing is difficult. When you do not forgive, what do you do?

01:36:53.551 --> 01:36:55.954
And when you forgive, even then what do you do?

01:36:55.979 --> 01:36:57.599
It is all a game of words.

01:36:57.623 --> 01:36:59.720
But when you don't forgive

01:36:59.745 --> 01:37:04.949
you get stuck up in those worries, which others have forced on you.

01:37:04.974 --> 01:37:50.645
Marathi

01:37:50.669 --> 01:37:56.838
Marathi

01:37:56.862 --> 01:38:00.680
Nobody should get bad thoughts about himself

01:38:00.704 --> 01:38:03.542
put your right hand at the back of your head

01:38:03.566 --> 01:38:05.808
where there is your optic lobe.

01:38:05.833 --> 01:38:09.074
hold it by pressing it forcefully

01:38:09.098 --> 01:38:13.699
and now here you have to say only this

01:38:13.724 --> 01:38:16.334
but you do not have to blame yourself

01:38:16.358 --> 01:38:18.718
not considering yourself as a culprit say

01:38:18.743 --> 01:38:21.877
God, if i have made any mistake, please forgive me.

01:38:21.901 --> 01:38:38.667
Marathi

01:38:38.691 --> 01:38:55.408
Marathi

01:38:55.432 --> 01:38:57.948
Put it on head where there is your Fontenelle bone.

01:38:57.972 --> 01:38:59.825
Put the palm of your hand

01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:03.913
on the top of your Fontenelle bone in the center and press it.

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:06.474
Press it and rotate it seven times.

01:39:06.499 --> 01:39:09.106
And at that time say

01:39:09.130 --> 01:39:12.228
that, "Mother i want self realization, give me that."

01:39:12.252 --> 01:39:14.525
Because I cannot again force you.

01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:19.577
So you will have to say," Please give me self realization".

01:39:19.601 --> 01:39:44.675
Marathi

01:39:44.748 --> 01:39:58.815
Marathi

01:39:58.839 --> 01:40:06.660
Keep your attention to the top of your head and say

01:40:06.947 --> 01:40:14.432
Marathi

01:40:14.457 --> 01:40:19.243
After saying this, lift your right hand carefully

01:40:19.439 --> 01:40:24.265
and put it in the right side of your lap

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:26.296
on the right side knee.

01:40:27.537 --> 01:40:31.478
Do not open your eyes.

01:40:31.552 --> 01:40:33.803
Now on the top of your head

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:36.642
with about four fingers of your left hand

01:40:36.667 --> 01:40:40.148
see if you are getting cool breeze.

01:40:40.172 --> 01:40:48.380
Marathi

01:40:48.404 --> 01:40:50.876
Check if you are getting cool breeze.

01:40:50.901 --> 01:40:55.036
It will come from your head from your head, from your head only.

01:40:56.195 --> 01:41:05.875
Marathi

01:41:05.899 --> 01:41:09.957
Check it by raising it a little higher, four to five inches higher.

01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:14.131
Are you getting cool breeze or not? Is it coming?

01:41:14.155 --> 01:41:48.409
Marathi

01:41:48.433 --> 01:42:06.868
Marathi

01:42:06.892 --> 01:42:27.586
Marathi

01:42:27.610 --> 01:42:33.983
Now you say,"Is it Ritambara Pragnya? Is it Bramha Shakti?

01:42:34.008 --> 01:42:37.553
Is it the all pervading power of Divine?

01:42:37.577 --> 01:42:47.179
Put a question to yourself three times.

01:42:47.258 --> 01:42:49.328
Now put your hands down.

01:42:49.353 --> 01:42:54.690
Check, whether you are getting cool breeze in your hands also.

01:42:54.714 --> 01:42:58.050
Now open your eyes. Open slowly

01:42:58.074 --> 01:43:01.910
and be in thoughtless awareness, don't think.
