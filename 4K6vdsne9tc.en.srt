1
00:00:09,334 --> 00:00:13,710
Today we have come here

2
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:18,917
to do Hanumana’s Puja.

3
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:26,042
Shri Hanumana is a great character in our being,

4
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:33,042
and He runs all the way from Swadisthana to your brain.

5
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:41,001
And He supplies all the necessary guidance we need

6
00:00:41,334 --> 00:00:43,834
in our futuristic planning,

7
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:50,126
or in our mental activities;

8
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:55,876
He gives us guidance and protection.

9
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:06,376
As you know that Germany is a place where

10
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:11,501
people are very active, very right-sided,

11
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:16,376
use their brain too much,

12
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:20,750
and they are very machine-oriented also.

13
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:26,626
It is very surprising how a deity like Shri Hanumana,

14
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:30,334
who is an eternal child

15
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:34,751
– because He was like a monkey,

16
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,710
His head was that of a monkey,

17
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:40,876
if not of an elephant – so He was an eternal child,

18
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:46,042
and He was the one who was used

19
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:49,710
to run the right side of human beings.

20
00:01:52,917 --> 00:01:56,126
He was told that “You must control the sun.”

21
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,917
To begin with He has to control the sun,

22
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:01,959
that the sun in the people,

23
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:03,543
if there is too much sun

24
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,293
then He must try to control it

25
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:11,042
and make it cooler, or smoother.

26
00:02:12,084 --> 00:02:17,668
So – He was a child after all, so as soon He was born,

27
00:02:17,917 --> 00:02:21,543
when He knew that He has to look after the sun,

28
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:23,420
He said, “Why not eat it off?”

29
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:29,626
So He went, ran up the Virata’s body and ate up the Surya.

30
00:02:30,507 --> 00:02:33,750
There He had to be told,
“No, no, no, no, You have to control Him.

31
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,293
You don’t have to put Him inside your stomach!”

32
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:41,042
– because He thought that this sun

33
00:02:41,376 --> 00:02:44,876
will be controlled better if He has it in His own stomach.

34
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,710
So the beauty of His character is that

35
00:02:51,917 --> 00:02:57,792
He’s a child, and the child like behavior of Shri Hanumana

36
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,876
has to control the right side,

37
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:07,876
if there’s a right-sided mother or a right-sided father.

38
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:12,460
Normally right-sided people don’t get children, normally.

39
00:03:13,042 --> 00:03:15,251
They’re over-right-sided,

40
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:16,876
then even they get children,

41
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:19,334
but they are really not liked by the children

42
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:21,585
because they have no time for children,

43
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,212
they all the time are very strict with the children,

44
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:26,460
they shout them, shout at them,

45
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:28,710
they don’t know how to handle the children.

46
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:31,751
Or they’re over-indulgent,

47
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,543
because they always think that “I never got this,

48
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,876
so let me give it to the child.”

49
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:40,585
So these extreme type of people

50
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:45,334
who are right-sided

51
00:03:47,001 --> 00:03:51,668
have got this Hanumana, who is nothing but a child.

52
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:59,460
He is very anxious, very anxious

53
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:01,751
to do the work of Shri Rama.

54
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:05,460
Now Shri Rama is a character, I would say,

55
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,001
which is full of balance, absolutely.

56
00:04:10,293 --> 00:04:13,751
He’s the benevolent king which Socrates has described.

57
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,501
So He needed somebody with Him all the time

58
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:25,001
to do the work,

59
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,626
or to supply Him or to help Him

60
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:34,876
– like a secretary you can call Him;

61
00:04:36,168 --> 00:04:38,750
and Shri Hanumana was the one

62
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,290
who was created for this purpose.

63
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,836
Now Shri Rama (Shri Mataji may mean Shri Hanumana)

64
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:49,460
was such a assistant;

65
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,501
I mean, you cannot have such a word for Him.

66
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,251
We can say He was such a servant of Shri Rama

67
00:04:55,501 --> 00:04:57,460
– even the servants, you see,

68
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:01,792
don’t have that much of dedication for their master.

69
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:06,209
We can say like a dog or a horse,

70
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:13,376
but that also doesn’t have – such dedication for Shri Rama,

71
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:21,668
that by the time He grew up He got “nau” nine siddhis,

72
00:05:21,876 --> 00:05:23,710
navadha siddhis.

73
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:25,917
Nine siddhis He got.

74
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:32,792
These siddhis are like this, that He could become big,

75
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,001
He could become so heavy that nobody could lift Him;

76
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:41,376
He could become so sukshma that nobody could see Him,

77
00:05:41,585 --> 00:05:44,376
He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.

78
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:47,876
There are nine siddhis that He got.

79
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:56,376
So a person who has got the right side too much in him,

80
00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:00,084
He controls him with these nine siddhis.

81
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:09,668
Now, how will He control a man who is running very fast

82
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:11,251
in his life?

83
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:15,710
What He does is to control his movement,

84
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,751
He makes him in such a way

85
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:22,710
that he has to put down his speed.

86
00:06:23,084 --> 00:06:25,751
He makes his feet very heavy;

87
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:28,751
now he can’t do that much.

88
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:32,334
Or He makes his hands very heavy,

89
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:36,334
so the person cannot work very much with his hands.

90
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:47,376
So He can give a tremendous kind of a lethargic heaviness

91
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:53,460
to a person who is a very right-sided person.

92
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,792
He has got another siddhis which are very interesting, is

93
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:08,585
that He can extend His – He doesn’t have many weapons,

94
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:11,084
He has only one gadaa in His hand

95
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:18,792
– and He can extend His tail to any extent,

96
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:23,334
and He can handle people with His tails,

97
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:25,209
He does not have to use His hand.

98
00:07:25,376 --> 00:07:29,209
Sitting down here, He can put the tail around anywhere.

99
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:34,376
If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail

100
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,710
and sit on that.

101
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:38,418
Like He has all these monkey-tricks

102
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,251
as you’re to call them, you see,

103
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:44,251
and all these things He has within Himself

104
00:07:44,626 --> 00:07:47,501
is to control a person

105
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:51,418
who is extremely right-sided, to begin with.

106
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:54,293
Then He can fly in the air.

107
00:07:54,543 --> 00:08:01,168
Just, He doesn’t have any wings,

108
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:03,501
but He can just fly in the air.

109
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:07,668
That means He can become so big

110
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:11,626
that the amount of air He displaces

111
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:16,293
has a much more weight than His own weight

112
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,376
– just the same principle Archimedes,

113
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:20,418
if you know the Archimedes principle

114
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,251
– that He becomes so big that His body

115
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:29,581
starts floating in the air, like a boat, you see, you can call it.

116
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,710
And He can fly in the air,

117
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:41,168
and by flying in the air He can carry the messages

118
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:45,168
from one to another, through the ether.

119
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:49,251
Now the subtle of the ether that we have

120
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:56,084
is under the command of Shri Hanumana.

121
00:08:56,376 --> 00:08:58,543
He is the one who controls,

122
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,501
or He’s the Lord of this ether, the subtle of the ether

123
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,042
or say, the causal of the ether; and through it,

124
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:07,418
it communicates.

125
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,042
All the communications that you find,

126
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:14,750
like we have within ourselves also ductless glands

127
00:09:15,042 --> 00:09:18,376
which the pituitary is using, ductless glands,

128
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:22,168
is through Hanumana’s movement;

129
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,626
because He can go into a nirakar,

130
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:27,959
He can go into a formless state.

131
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:29,501
Also the communications,

132
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:32,212
we use it for this communication that we have,

133
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:37,376
maybe we can say that there’s a, we have got a loudspeaker,

134
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,293
but we have a television, we have got radios

135
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:43,042
and all those things.

136
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,501
Where we catch on to the ether,

137
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,084
anything is all the blessings of Hanumana,

138
00:09:51,376 --> 00:09:54,959
and are available to people who are right-sided.

139
00:09:55,376 --> 00:10:01,126
Only the right-sided people discover these things

140
00:10:01,293 --> 00:10:05,792
of the space, which we call as a cordless telephone

141
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:10,376
or a thing without – we have also telegraphs and,

142
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:15,460
where we don’t use any wires.

143
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:19,042
So without any connection through the ether,

144
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,418
He can manage.

145
00:10:20,626 --> 00:10:27,042
So all the ethereal connections has been done

146
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,168
by this great engineer, Shri Hanumana.

147
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:33,917
And it is so perfect, it’s so perfect

148
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,376
that you cannot challenge it,

149
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:38,337
and you cannot find faults with it.

150
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,792
Maybe your instruments may not be all right,

151
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:44,501
but as far as His ethereal work is concerned,

152
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,293
He’s perfectly there.

153
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:49,501
Now the scientists discover it and think that

154
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:55,293
it is in the nature, but they never think, how can it be?

155
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,626
We say something in the ether

156
00:10:57,834 --> 00:11:00,792
and how is it, it is received on the other end?

157
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:03,751
They just take it for granted that it is so, that

158
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:07,834
we say something here or we relay something

159
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,626
on the television and it is seen the other side.

160
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:17,042
But they never even think or search out how it is done,

161
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,334
what is the way.

162
00:11:18,626 --> 00:11:23,626
And this is what is the work of Shri Hanumana,

163
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:30,834
who has done such a beautiful network,

164
00:11:31,376 --> 00:11:35,545
and through that network all these things work out.

165
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:39,042
So even on the right side

166
00:11:39,543 --> 00:11:46,209
the vibrations we get in the molecules,

167
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:50,917
as you know that we get molecules like sulfur dioxide,

168
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,376
if you have the sulfur, has two oxygen,

169
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:57,959
and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.

170
00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:00,668
They are asymmetric, symmetric type of vibrations,

171
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:02,462
you all must be knowing about it.

172
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:05,668
So all these things, symmetric and asymmetric vibrations

173
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:08,751
are created by whom? Nobody wants to know,

174
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,293
nobody wants to find out,

175
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,209
because after all in an atom or...

176
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:17,042
So imagine, in a molecule, that deep, who does that job?

177
00:12:17,293 --> 00:12:21,418
It’s done by Shri Hanuman, in His subtle ways.

178
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:23,751
So He has another great,

179
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:31,501
great siddhi which we call as anima.

180
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:35,168
Anima, anu – “anu” means a molecule,

181
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,376
and that means it can enter into a molecule,

182
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:42,585
or “renu” is the atom.

183
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:45,236
It can enter into molecule or into atom.

184
00:12:45,317 --> 00:12:47,420
Now, many scientists think that they have,

185
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:50,001
in the modern times they discovered the molecules.

186
00:12:50,168 --> 00:12:54,501
It’s not so, because it’s already in our oldest scriptures,

187
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,168
description of anima is there, is of anu, renu is there,

188
00:12:59,376 --> 00:13:02,126
so is already described there.

189
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:07,626
Now, then whatever, wherever you see

190
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:12,001
the electromagnetic forces working,

191
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:16,126
it is worked through Hanumana’s blessings.

192
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:21,251
He is the one who creates electromagnetic forces.

193
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:25,376
So now we can see that as Ganesha

194
00:13:25,626 --> 00:13:29,042
has got the magnetic force in Him – He’s the magnet,

195
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,750
He’s the, He has got the magnetic force

196
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:36,001
– then we can say the electromagnetic is,

197
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,834
is the one which we call as Hanumana’s force,

198
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:43,126
on the material side of it.

199
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:50,376
But from the matter He goes up to the brain.

200
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:56,750
So He rises from Swadisthana up to the brain,

201
00:13:57,001 --> 00:14:03,834
so in the brain also He creates the co-relationships

202
00:14:04,293 --> 00:14:09,460
of the different sides of our brain.

203
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:11,585
So how much He gives us.

204
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:16,917
I mean, we can say if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

205
00:14:17,168 --> 00:14:20,501
then He gives us the power to think.

206
00:14:20,792 --> 00:14:25,293
He protects us also, that we should not think of bad things.

207
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:27,585
That is, we can say that,

208
00:14:27,792 --> 00:14:32,792
that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

209
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:39,126
then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.

210
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:43,251
I hope you understand the difference between the two.

211
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:47,251
Wisdom is where you do not need conscience so much

212
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:50,293
because you are wise, you know what is good, what is bad.

213
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:53,126
But conscience is needed in a personality

214
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:56,585
where he is to be controlled,

215
00:14:56,792 --> 00:15:01,168
and that control comes from Shri Hanumana,

216
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,792
which is the conscience in the human being.

217
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:07,042
Now this conscience which is Shri Hanumana

218
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:13,168
is the subtle form of Him which gives us

219
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,042
– is in Sanskrit called as “satasat vivekabuddhi”:

220
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:19,585
means, “sat” means truth,

221
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:22,042
“asat” means untruth,

222
00:15:22,293 --> 00:15:25,501
and “viveka” means the discrimination,

223
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,585
and “buddhi” means the intelligence.

224
00:15:29,792 --> 00:15:35,917
So, intelligence to discriminate between

225
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:42,585
the truth and untruth is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

226
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:46,543
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

227
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:53,152
if we say that Ganesha is the one who gives us,

228
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:54,501
He’s the adhyaksha,

229
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,626
means He is the – I call Him

230
00:15:56,751 --> 00:15:59,084
as the chancellor of the university.

231
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,751
He is the one who goes on degree to us,

232
00:16:02,042 --> 00:16:06,543
“Now you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.”

233
00:16:07,293 --> 00:16:13,751
And He helps us to know that what state we are in.

234
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,917
So the Ganesha gives us, say,

235
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,626
nirvichara samadhi

236
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:21,834
which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness,

237
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,834
and nirvikalpa samadhi.

238
00:16:24,293 --> 00:16:28,084
He gives all that, and also He gives us joy.

239
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:42,084
But the understanding that this is good,

240
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:45,418
this is for our benevolence,

241
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:53,750
mental understanding, comes to us from Shri Hanumana.

242
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:57,959
And it’s very important for Western people

243
00:16:58,209 --> 00:16:59,834
because it has to be mental,

244
00:17:00,084 --> 00:17:02,168
otherwise they won’t understand.

245
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,751
If it is not mental they cannot come into abstract.

246
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:07,293
It has to be mental.

247
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:12,626
And so the mental understanding of whether it is good or bad

248
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,668
is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

249
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:20,626
Without Him, even if you become a saint

250
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:23,751
you will be – of course, you are a saint

251
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,668
and you will enjoy the saintliness;

252
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,293
but whether this saintliness is

253
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,834
all right if you live on Himalayas,

254
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:37,917
or is all right when you go across to people

255
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:41,042
to give them realization – all this scanning,

256
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,668
this vivekabuddhi, all this scanning,

257
00:17:43,749 --> 00:17:47,749
all this discrimination, all this guidance,

258
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:52,668
all this protection is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

259
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,792
Germany being a country which is very, very much,

260
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,626
I should say, an essence of right side;

261
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:03,959
and because of it being such an essence of right side,

262
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:08,042
is important to get the protector of right side

263
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,751
here worshipped.

264
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:15,418
But in all that vivekabuddhi,

265
00:18:15,668 --> 00:18:18,751
in that discrimination He knows one thing,

266
00:18:19,168 --> 00:18:23,751
that He’s absolutely subservient to Shri Rama.

267
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:25,750
Now what is Shri Rama?

268
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:28,042
Shri Rama is the benevolent king,

269
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,418
He works for the benevolence.

270
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,852
And Shri Rama Himself is a formal king,

271
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:36,959
like sankocha, we call it – I mean,

272
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,420
the English words are not so good to explain this,

273
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:43,626
but Shri Rama is the one who is,

274
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,042
who will not push forward Himself.

275
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,168
He keeps back. He’s very balanced,

276
00:18:50,334 --> 00:18:52,959
He is a very poised person.

277
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:55,834
So the Hanumana, you see,

278
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,543
He, He is the one who is always anxious

279
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:02,917
to do the work of Shri Rama, always.

280
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:05,959
If Shri Rama says, “All right, you go and get the...”

281
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:10,209
He told Him, “go and get the...” – sanjeevani

282
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,334
is the kind of a herb that was needed

283
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:17,418
to bring Lakshmana to life

284
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,293
– He went there and He brought the whole mountain with Him,

285
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,209
“Now, better have it.” It’s like that sort of a person,

286
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,253
you see, so He brought the – that’s childlike behavior of His.

287
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:33,668
And the discrimination in this is that,

288
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:36,084
that “If Shri Rama has asked for,

289
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:38,084
whatever He asks for, I’ll do it.”

290
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:41,668
So is a relationship of a, I would say,

291
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:43,834
like a guru and [*]shishya.

292
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,751
But even more than that, that the shishya

293
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:51,001
is just like a subservient servant,

294
00:19:51,209 --> 00:19:54,334
absolutely surrendered to God,

295
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,834
absolutely surrendered to God,

296
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:01,293
and His main thing is surrender.

297
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:05,293
Now see, this surrender itself

298
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:08,959
shows that all those who are right-sided people

299
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:14,209
are surrendered to God, not surrendered to their bosses.

300
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,334
Mostly all those right-sided people

301
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,253
are very surrendered to their bosses,

302
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,293
surrendered to their jobs,

303
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:23,001
sometimes surrendered to their wives also.

304
00:20:23,543 --> 00:20:27,209
But they are subservient to wrong people,

305
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,585
they have no discretion.

306
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:32,418
You’ll always find that, they have no discretion.

307
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:35,460
But if you take the help of Hanumana,

308
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,209
then He tells you that you have to be

309
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,834
surrendered to God Almighty and not to anybody else,

310
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:44,334
or to your Guru like Rama.

311
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:47,751
Otherwise you are not to be surrendered to anybody else.

312
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:49,834
And then you are a free bird,

313
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:53,460
and you have all the nine powers within yourself.

314
00:20:53,750 --> 00:21:01,751
Hanumana’s whole thing is to antidote your overactivity,

315
00:21:02,001 --> 00:21:06,876
to antidote your too-much thinking,

316
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:09,626
to antidote your ego.

317
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:14,209
Now, how He finishes the ego of people

318
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:18,751
is very sweetly shown when He burnt the whole of Lanka

319
00:21:19,084 --> 00:21:26,084
– is the capital of Ravana

320
00:21:26,751 --> 00:21:28,834
– and the way He made fun of him.

321
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:32,668
Because you see, anybody who is egoistical,

322
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,001
one must make fun of him, then he’s all right.

323
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:41,418
Like first He went and when Ravana saw Him,

324
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:44,834
he said, “Who are You? Who are You, the monkey?”

325
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:48,460
So He just pushed His tail towards him,

326
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:52,168
and tickled his nose with His tail.

327
00:21:55,001 --> 00:22:00,001
So He’s the one who makes fun of egoistical people.

328
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:02,668
Now, if somebody egoistical tries to trouble you,

329
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:05,959
He’s the one; He’ll make such fun out of him

330
00:22:06,209 --> 00:22:08,750
that you’ll be amazed how this fellow was jumping,

331
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:10,750
like a Humpty-Dumpty has fallen down

332
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,212
and has broken his crown.

333
00:22:12,293 --> 00:22:15,209
So you see, it is the job of Hanumana

334
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,885
to protect you from egoistical people.
