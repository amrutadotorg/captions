00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:10.193
Now regarding the Spirit,

00:00:10.313 --> 00:00:15.916
the last and the highest thing 
that it is the source of joy.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:20.672
Joy has no duality, it doesn’t have 
happiness and unhappiness.

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:25.026
That is the ego; when the ego 
is pampered, it feels happy,

00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:27.974
when it is hurt it feels unhappy.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:34.088
So it (the spirit) has nothing to do 
with that duality; it’s in joy.

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:40.386
Say a sensible man is watching a tragedy 
or a comedy as a drama he enjoys both,

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.876
he doesn’t get involved into it.

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:51.189
In the same way, you enjoy life 
without getting involved into it

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.283
and the life becomes 
a source of joyous living.

00:00:57.404 --> 00:01:04.841
So the joy that you feel is rather late 
in the western minds,

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:08.795
(the) reason is the mind of the 
western people is over-developed,

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.681
and the heart is less-developed.

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:15.216
But say in a place where people 
are developing now,

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:17.891
they’re developing their brains now,

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.419
developing countries, 
the heart is more developed.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.959
So they feel the joy first

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.462
and they are not bothered 
about knowing about the brain.

00:01:27.582 --> 00:01:31.178
But the Western mind will first of all see: 
is it true or not?

00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:34.245
Yes, it’s true, then it will go and see this fellow,

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:37.691
let me see the vibrations of a tree, 
of a doggy, this, that.

00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:39.277
They go on analyzing everything,

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:43.596
see with the vibrations of this photograph, 
of this sari, of that clothes.

00:01:43.716 --> 00:01:47.098
They go on like mad, they go on, 
first analyzing it,

00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:51.756
then when they get out of it, 
they settle down

00:01:52.136 --> 00:01:58.563
then they find the kundalini is fixed here 
and the source of joy starts pouring,

00:01:58.683 --> 00:02:04.048
just like the river Ganges.
It pours actually physically.

00:02:04.168 --> 00:02:10.503
You feel that what we call the (…?)

00:02:10.623 --> 00:02:16.724
is the rising of the hair when you feel 
that joy falling from your head,

00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:21.152
just like the Ganges falls on Shiva.

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:28.482
When you see a beautiful picture, 
say  you see a Mona Lisa, you think:

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:31.379
this Leonardo Da Vinci, 
what he must have done,

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.096
how much it will cost, this, that, 
all those things.

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:37.102
But a realised soul does not think, 
he just looks,

00:02:37.228 --> 00:02:39.581
looks at it without thinking.

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:46.747
The joy of the creation of that beautiful painting

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:50.001
absolutely is reflected in his mind

00:02:50.121 --> 00:02:57.586
like in a ripple-less lake; all that 
is surrounding, it is completely reflected.

00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:02.577
That’s how the sense of beauty 
and aesthetics change absolutely.
