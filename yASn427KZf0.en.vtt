00:07.459 --> 00:10.193
Now regarding the Spirit,

00:10.313 --> 00:15.916
the last and the highest thing
that it is the source of joy.

00:16.036 --> 00:20.672
Joy has no duality, it doesn’t have
happiness and unhappiness.

00:20.792 --> 00:25.026
That is the ego; when the ego
is pampered, it feels happy,

00:25.146 --> 00:27.974
when it is hurt it feels unhappy.

00:28.094 --> 00:34.088
So it (the spirit) has nothing to do
with that duality; it’s in joy.

00:34.208 --> 00:40.386
Say a sensible man is watching a tragedy
or a comedy as a drama he enjoys both,

00:40.506 --> 00:42.876
he doesn’t get involved into it.

00:42.996 --> 00:51.189
In the same way, you enjoy life
without getting involved into it

00:51.309 --> 00:57.283
and the life becomes
a source of joyous living.

00:57.404 --> 01:04.841
So the joy that you feel is rather late
in the western minds,

01:04.961 --> 01:08.795
(the) reason is the mind of the
western people is over-developed,

01:08.915 --> 01:11.681
and the heart is less-developed.

01:11.801 --> 01:15.216
But say in a place where people
are developing now,

01:15.336 --> 01:17.891
they’re developing their brains now,

01:18.011 --> 01:21.419
developing countries,
the heart is more developed.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.959
So they feel the joy first

01:24.079 --> 01:27.462
and they are not bothered
about knowing about the brain.

01:27.582 --> 01:31.178
But the Western mind will first of all see:
is it true or not?

01:31.298 --> 01:34.245
Yes, it’s true, then it will go and see this fellow,

01:34.365 --> 01:37.691
let me see the vibrations of a tree,
of a doggy, this, that.

01:37.811 --> 01:39.277
They go on analyzing everything,

01:39.398 --> 01:43.596
see with the vibrations of this photograph,
of this sari, of that clothes.

01:43.716 --> 01:47.098
They go on like mad, they go on,
first analyzing it,

01:47.231 --> 01:51.756
then when they get out of it,
they settle down

01:52.136 --> 01:58.563
then they find the kundalini is fixed here
and the source of joy starts pouring,

01:58.683 --> 02:04.048
just like the river Ganges.
It pours actually physically.

02:04.168 --> 02:10.503
You feel that what we call the (…?)

02:10.623 --> 02:16.724
is the rising of the hair when you feel
that joy falling from your head,

02:16.844 --> 02:21.152
just like the Ganges falls on Shiva.

02:21.345 --> 02:28.482
When you see a beautiful picture,
say  you see a Mona Lisa, you think:

02:28.603 --> 02:31.379
this Leonardo Da Vinci,
what he must have done,

02:31.499 --> 02:34.096
how much it will cost, this, that,
all those things.

02:34.216 --> 02:37.102
But a realised soul does not think,
he just looks,

02:37.228 --> 02:39.581
looks at it without thinking.

02:39.701 --> 02:46.747
The joy of the creation of that beautiful painting

02:46.867 --> 02:50.001
absolutely is reflected in his mind

02:50.121 --> 02:57.586
like in a ripple-less lake; all that
is surrounding, it is completely reflected.

02:58.481 --> 03:02.577
That’s how the sense of beauty
and aesthetics change absolutely.
