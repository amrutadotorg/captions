07:19.812 --> 07:29.137
It is such a great pleasure to see you all
assembled here,

07:29.338 --> 07:40.205
and which is such a far-fetched place, away
from the madding crowd.

07:40.969 --> 07:48.847
It's such a beautiful place, and which has
vibrations.

07:50.991 --> 07:54.724
They can't hear you.

07:55.936 --> 08:01.865
Now can you hear Me? All right.

08:04.178 --> 08:07.317
It's all right now.

08:10.418 --> 08:14.064
I selected this place suddenly

08:14.265 --> 08:20.912
from a very thick newspaper, American
newspaper.

08:21.112 --> 08:25.014
The vibrations were just shooting out

08:25.214 --> 08:28.742
and I said, "What is this, coming from
where?"

08:28.943 --> 08:32.180
And there was a little advertisement,

08:32.381 --> 08:37.732
and I said, "This is the place where we
have to go."

08:37.933 --> 08:45.481
This place has so many vibrations, even
in the advertisement."

08:45.925 --> 08:52.277
So you can imagine how the guidance comes.

08:52.477 --> 09:00.125
It comes from vibrations, and that's how
I was here

09:00.325 --> 09:07.871
and this place was selected by the divine
Force,

09:08.071 --> 09:11.998
and it happened only in one day.

09:12.198 --> 09:16.884
Such a miraculous thing to happen in one
day!

09:17.988 --> 09:24.150
It was taking so much time for them even
to get this,

09:24.367 --> 09:29.304
and suddenly I told them, "Better get it."

09:30.063 --> 09:39.770
It all worked out, and we are now here
in the most beautiful atmosphere.

09:42.912 --> 09:49.843
Of course, you know that Red Indians were
driven out

09:50.043 --> 09:58.632
and they came here to hide themselves. They
were hiding themselves in this place

09:58.832 --> 10:08.245
so that they should not be crushed and
destroyed forever.

10:09.102 --> 10:16.077
That era is over now, that era
of domination,

10:16.277 --> 10:22.360
of entering into somebody else's land and
occupying it,

10:22.560 --> 10:26.715
and considering it to be a great revelry,

10:26.916 --> 10:33.460
all that is over now, the human
understanding has gone much beyond;

10:33.660 --> 10:40.521
and they understand that this is sinful,
this is wrong,

10:40.721 --> 10:44.086
whatever we have done was wrong.

10:44.286 --> 10:47.446
But those people are no more.

10:47.646 --> 10:53.132
And the children and the grandchildren
of those children

10:53.333 --> 10:58.480
of these people who were the children
of God, they used to think,

10:58.681 --> 11:02.129
do not like all that;

11:02.329 --> 11:09.238
because you have no right

11:09.438 --> 11:17.424
to take somebody's land like that and
occupy it as your own.

11:18.136 --> 11:21.698
Of course, the land doesn't belong
to anyone,

11:21.899 --> 11:28.346
but still wherever you are born, that's
your land,

11:28.546 --> 11:37.495
and that land has to be kept with those
who are born here, who own it.

11:37.695 --> 11:44.295
But this kind of aggression has been going
on for ages now.

11:44.495 --> 11:49.076
Now the time has come to finish this,

11:49.282 --> 11:54.226
once for all give up this kind
of adventure,

11:54.434 --> 12:02.749
is to enter into somebody's land or
somebody's house and occupy it.

12:02.950 --> 12:06.520
But there's another kind of aggression
I see now,

12:06.721 --> 12:12.070
is that they enter into the minds
of the people now

12:12.271 --> 12:21.776
through their talk, through their all kinds
of aggressive attitude,

12:22.048 --> 12:27.147
and the mind, mind itself becomes a slave.

12:27.347 --> 12:35.609
The present times are like that, I think,
where people have no freedom

12:35.810 --> 12:43.526
to think what is right, what is wrong, and
also to take to right things.

12:43.727 --> 12:49.998
They have to accept whatever is happening
around,

12:50.522 --> 12:57.144
whatever is immoral, whatever is
destructive.

12:57.345 --> 13:03.864
One has to accept because still, I think,

13:04.065 --> 13:08.065
we do not have sufficient number of Sahaja
yogis

13:08.265 --> 13:18.001
who can oppose all these adventures
of modern times.

13:18.201 --> 13:22.165
We have another kind where we find

13:22.365 --> 13:30.567
these false gurus who aggress - specially
America.

13:31.226 --> 13:37.753
America is really cursed that way because
it had money,

13:37.953 --> 13:43.132
so all the crooks of the world came here -
just imagine.

13:43.332 --> 13:46.790
To have money itself is not a blessing.

13:46.990 --> 13:52.610
They all came here and looted rich people

13:52.886 --> 13:57.382
and have made so much money for themself.

13:59.687 --> 14:03.760
This kind of exploitation

14:03.961 --> 14:09.717
is very much dangerous, much more,

14:09.918 --> 14:15.459
because the mind gets ruined. I have seen
many people were ruined,

14:15.660 --> 14:21.609
specially many seekers were ruined
completely.

14:23.305 --> 14:29.646
I hope they are born again and get their
Self-realization.

14:29.846 --> 14:32.901
The seeking is there, no doubt,

14:33.101 --> 14:39.591
but all kinds of obstacles have come,
all kinds of temptations are there.

14:39.792 --> 14:50.172
And so, despite all that seeking, earnest
seeking, honest seeking,

14:50.372 --> 14:56.612
they have fallen into traps, which I cannot
explain

14:56.813 --> 15:02.661
why should it have happened, but it has
happened - one has to see.

15:02.862 --> 15:09.746
It's a - makes you very miserable, unhappy.

15:10.774 --> 15:16.517
But still so many are there, you are there,
saved now.

15:16.717 --> 15:23.629
And in this Last Judgment you have risen
from that level

15:23.830 --> 15:28.023
to this new level, where I am sure

15:28.223 --> 15:33.785
you will be able to salvage many more.

15:33.986 --> 15:40.483
Each person can salvage at least thousand
people, and so many of you,

15:40.684 --> 15:47.425
if you try that, it would be of a very,
very great,

15:47.625 --> 15:56.471
very great emancipation for this world
which we are all to save.

15:56.672 --> 16:06.220
So one must know the first, first duty
of every Sahaja yogi now

16:06.421 --> 16:12.317
is to save others, to talk about Sahaja
Yoga,

16:12.518 --> 16:20.535
to work out Sahaja Yoga in different
places.

16:20.736 --> 16:25.112
For example now, I was surprised that they
are working out

16:25.312 --> 16:33.189
on children who are abused. They are also
in India, we are working out

16:33.390 --> 16:39.044
on various places like prisons, armies.

16:39.245 --> 16:43.899
So you can enter into all kinds
of activities,

16:44.099 --> 16:55.550
you can enter into all kinds of aggressed
places and save people.

16:55.751 --> 17:02.058
But worst of all, I think, is the innocence
is under attack

17:02.258 --> 17:05.687
in these Western countries, specially
in America.

17:05.888 --> 17:13.662
The innocence is under attack and this is
something is very dangerous,

17:13.862 --> 17:23.601
because the children get this mutation
at a very young age,

17:23.802 --> 17:27.044
and what will happen to them?

17:27.235 --> 17:33.890
So we have to think of all those innocent
children,

17:34.090 --> 17:40.153
what we can do for them, how we can save
them,

17:40.353 --> 17:43.266
how we can work it out.

17:43.467 --> 17:48.934
The concern has to now go from yourself
to others.

17:49.134 --> 17:54.268
You got your realization alright; you
corrected yourself,

17:54.468 --> 18:01.539
you are absolutely perfecting yourself;
all this is there,

18:01.739 --> 18:06.479
but now what is to be done?

18:06.680 --> 18:14.026
For what is this light enlightened here?
It is for others.

18:14.226 --> 18:20.685
So now Sahaja yogis have to live for others,
and not for themselves.

18:20.885 --> 18:24.721
They'll have all the energy, they'll have
all the support

18:24.898 --> 18:29.896
and they'll have all the blessings. So we
have to live for others.

18:30.097 --> 18:34.887
And how do we live for others - is very
simple,

18:35.087 --> 18:40.285
is to have concern, concern about
everything.

18:40.486 --> 18:46.702
You have concern about the Mother
Earth, concern about your neighbors,

18:46.903 --> 18:54.131
concern about the people who's suffering
all over the world.

18:54.331 --> 19:00.194
If you read the newspaper you will be
amazed how

19:00.394 --> 19:05.956
things are happening, how people are
suffering.

19:06.157 --> 19:09.118
We have to understand fundamentally

19:09.318 --> 19:13.427
that unless and until transformation takes
place,

19:13.627 --> 19:19.151
we cannot change this world. And you all
can transform others,

19:19.351 --> 19:24.939
so it's your duty, it's your job
to transform other people

19:25.140 --> 19:30.686
and tell them what is divine love.

19:30.886 --> 19:35.207
Love is the only way now we can work out.

19:35.408 --> 19:44.031
It is something like a big, big hole which
should go into this darkness of aggression,

19:44.232 --> 19:51.970
and which will clarify many places, many
hearts, many people.

19:52.170 --> 20:03.069
It is a ocean, we should say, ocean
of greatness.

20:03.269 --> 20:09.053
This divine love is so great

20:09.253 --> 20:17.444
and so powerful, at the same time so very
gentle

20:17.644 --> 20:23.147
that you can see the nature, how, how
the trees grow:

20:23.347 --> 20:32.585
every leaf gets the sunshine, every tree
has its own position.

20:32.785 --> 20:36.007
We have to learn so much from the nature,

20:36.208 --> 20:42.096
because nature is bound with that love.

20:42.509 --> 20:47.948
Nature has no aggressiveness.

20:48.148 --> 20:55.500
It is just under the complete control
of the divine love.

20:55.701 --> 21:01.304
With this understanding you should also
know

21:01.505 --> 21:07.575
that when you are getting to Sahaja yogis

21:07.775 --> 21:13.439
what should be your attitude: how you
should move,

21:13.640 --> 21:19.053
how you should talk to them, how you should
understand them,

21:19.253 --> 21:22.633
how you should express your love.

21:22.833 --> 21:30.610
This is quite possible now, it's not
difficult.

21:30.811 --> 21:35.598
You should not be afraid, not feel shy.

21:35.798 --> 21:44.489
But in a sweet manner you can talk to them,

21:44.690 --> 21:50.625
you can communicate with them, you can
tell them;

21:51.216 --> 21:59.486
because this was the time, this was
to happen,

21:59.687 --> 22:03.364
that's the reason Adi Shakti had to come.

22:03.565 --> 22:07.690
Without Her, it would not have been
possible.

22:07.891 --> 22:12.357
All other incarnations were there,

22:12.557 --> 22:16.996
but firstly, they were only on one chakras,

22:17.196 --> 22:20.940
and another one was they had to establish
themselves

22:21.140 --> 22:25.538
with other people, with the people around.

22:25.738 --> 22:28.907
They did try and they worked it out,

22:29.107 --> 22:35.061
but it didn't really work in the real sense
of the word.

22:35.262 --> 22:42.847
So Adi Shakti had to come, who has all
of them with Her.

22:43.047 --> 22:49.923
They're all with us, all the time wanting
to help you

22:50.123 --> 22:58.943
to do everything that you want to achieve.
It is there with -

22:59.143 --> 23:08.156
these holy vibrations are with you

23:08.356 --> 23:13.000
for every kind of good work you want to do,

23:13.201 --> 23:17.207
any kind of Sahaj work you want to do,

23:17.408 --> 23:23.369
these vibrations will definitely be there
to guide you,

23:23.570 --> 23:31.582
to help you, to support you and to love
you. You will be amazed how

23:31.782 --> 23:36.180
people, once they start working for Sahaja
Yoga,

23:36.381 --> 23:41.247
how they are blessed from every angle.

23:43.181 --> 23:50.162
So, one has to decide in their own minds

23:50.363 --> 23:58.066
that all your dreams have to come true.

23:58.266 --> 24:04.874
So only thing what you have to do is
to know only that

24:05.075 --> 24:13.376
your purpose of life is to spread Sahaja
Yoga.

24:14.312 --> 24:17.699
Even now many Sahaja yogis write to Me,

24:17.900 --> 24:20.347
"Mother, this is happening to me, that is
happening,

24:20.547 --> 24:27.124
my father like that, mother like that" -
but very few.

24:27.324 --> 24:31.341
Practically this is over now.

24:31.816 --> 24:38.731
They used to write, I should say, all such
letters,

24:38.931 --> 24:44.430
but now I think they are all been perfected,
I don't know what has happened.

24:44.631 --> 24:54.235
It's a very unique time where there's light
everywhere,

24:56.887 --> 25:05.485
the nature is absolutely with you. You can
see how nature acts,

25:05.686 --> 25:09.781
how it is trying to help you and support
you,

25:09.982 --> 25:14.202
and how it wants to work out everything
for you.

25:14.402 --> 25:21.617
It is to be just understood and felt

25:22.213 --> 25:31.682
that you are something very special, and
that you have all the help,

25:31.882 --> 25:39.302
everyone of you. It's not one person,
two persons,

25:39.502 --> 25:46.825
it's not ten persons who - it's the whole
lot, as if the whole ocean

25:47.026 --> 25:56.522
is there to help you, help you to swim over
to save so many.

25:56.722 --> 26:05.338
You haven't seen such an ocean where there
is so much depth,

26:05.539 --> 26:10.881
and all the waves try to save you,

26:11.081 --> 26:20.591
to make you float in the realm of joy.

26:21.369 --> 26:28.771
All this has happened to you because there
is a purpose.

26:28.972 --> 26:33.884
It's not just because you have done poorva
punyas and all that.

26:34.085 --> 26:40.416
Many people say, "Because of previous life
we have got it".

26:42.381 --> 26:46.174
That is true. The cause may be that,

26:46.375 --> 26:53.624
but the result is that now you are capable
of giving realization to people,

26:53.824 --> 26:56.430
and this is what you have to do.

26:56.630 --> 27:02.759
All the way you have come here in this
wilderness.

27:03.678 --> 27:09.792
From this wilderness only, you will rise

27:09.993 --> 27:14.430
and you will bless all the people
of the world.

27:14.630 --> 27:18.788
Specially America should be blessed again
and again,

27:18.988 --> 27:31.333
because it's the Virat, it is Shri
Krishna's land,

27:31.762 --> 27:39.800
because people will always try to follow,
to copy you.

27:40.346 --> 27:45.595
Things will improve

27:46.484 --> 27:55.266
if you get the, we can say the blessings

27:55.467 --> 28:00.924
of the various lotuses you have within
yourself, no doubt.

28:01.124 --> 28:06.921
But what about you doing something,

28:07.834 --> 28:15.782
what about you doing something about it?
And this is what is very important.

28:15.983 --> 28:21.401
Now only thing what you have to do about
yourself

28:21.780 --> 28:31.799
is to find out about your own activities,

28:32.044 --> 28:35.901
what activities you have been doing.

28:36.074 --> 28:43.428
You have to find out what have you done,
and what you can do.

28:43.628 --> 28:51.592
When you meditate you think about yourself,
how much you have grown,

28:51.793 --> 28:57.634
what have you done, what have you given
to others.

28:57.834 --> 29:02.959
Whatever you've got, unless and until you
distribute it, it won't increase.

29:03.159 --> 29:08.475
That is the fundamental law, and that
works. I've seen people

29:08.675 --> 29:14.778
who are realized souls, who are very good,

29:14.978 --> 29:18.066
who know everything about Sahaja Yog

29:18.267 --> 29:27.759
but are not yet that much confident,
I should say, or that much deep.

29:27.960 --> 29:35.328
All this is only possible if you yourself

29:35.529 --> 29:43.576
get into creating new Sahaja yogis,

29:44.782 --> 29:49.532
and more Sahaja yogis - not for popularity,

29:49.733 --> 29:56.034
but for their good and for the good
of the whole.

29:57.670 --> 30:02.450
I was asked that I should come and stay
in America

30:02.651 --> 30:08.411
so America will improve very much. So now
here I am.

30:08.611 --> 30:11.783
I came here, I stayed here,

30:11.983 --> 30:19.482
and I am definitely putting all My
attention,

30:19.682 --> 30:27.179
because it's a very important, very, very
important chakra

30:27.380 --> 30:34.419
which is this, which is America.

30:34.662 --> 30:48.278
And this very important country is doing
sometimes very stupid things.

30:48.479 --> 30:52.382
I would not say that you enter into
politics - no.

30:52.583 --> 30:58.200
I would not say you get into any opposition
and form a group - no.

30:58.400 --> 31:02.334
But you also know that you have powers.

31:02.534 --> 31:08.260
Even your thought, your desire has powers.

31:08.460 --> 31:14.697
Try to experiment with it. Once you
experiment, you will find out

31:14.897 --> 31:21.050
that only the attention that you put
to these things, it will work out,

31:21.335 --> 31:25.085
I am sure it will work out.

31:26.605 --> 31:34.066
It is a country which can definitely help

31:35.446 --> 31:39.839
for the emancipation of the whole human
beings.

31:40.039 --> 31:45.870
But on the contrary, it is going
on the other way round.

31:46.568 --> 31:49.792
I mean, American culture, I don't
understand at all

31:49.993 --> 31:58.183
what is American culture is. Is something -

31:58.961 --> 32:03.283
they say something, do something else.

32:03.918 --> 32:13.277
They've no proper value system which is
accepted by everyone,

32:13.477 --> 32:18.481
which is built traditionally from days
together.

32:18.737 --> 32:26.118
The value system is so convoluted,
so twisted

32:26.319 --> 32:32.530
that it's only a Sahaja yogi by his
nobility, by his greatness

32:32.731 --> 32:36.946
can disentangle these people.

32:37.899 --> 32:44.675
They have funny ideas, and those funny
ideas should not

32:44.876 --> 32:51.169
deter you, should not stop you; for you
know that they are stupid,

32:51.369 --> 33:00.660
they are destructive and they will destroy
all the, all the good qualities.

33:01.208 --> 33:07.261
You should know that the responsibility
of Americans

33:07.462 --> 33:13.844
is much greater than the responsibility
of any other Sahaja yogis,

33:14.045 --> 33:21.314
because they are accepted and regarded

33:22.696 --> 33:38.985
as the most competent people, as the most
effective people by the divine Power.

33:39.186 --> 33:46.416
Divine Power thinks that now you can go
all ahead,

33:46.617 --> 33:50.947
you can do so much, and let us see.

33:51.147 --> 33:56.057
Like we have the power and the machinery,

33:56.258 --> 34:03.875
but the machinery if it doesn't work, what's
the use of the power? It is useless.

34:04.076 --> 34:11.374
So the machinery has to work, and it is
working, it is spreading,

34:11.575 --> 34:15.320
but we have to double our efforts.

34:15.520 --> 34:20.432
I was thinking of doing some sort
of a social work here

34:20.633 --> 34:26.810
so that it will go, it will be caught
in the eyes of many people.

34:28.223 --> 34:32.876
On a subtler level we have worked,

34:55.839 --> 35:02.321
but now we have to work it on the surface.

35:02.521 --> 35:11.687
Subtler level we are there, we have
achieved and we can achieve much more.

35:11.888 --> 35:19.620
But we should come out of it and think
what can we do on the surface,

35:19.821 --> 35:27.983
so that people see what is Sahaja Yoga is,
and what it can do to people.

35:28.995 --> 35:38.484
It's your personal behavior, your collective
behavior, your national behavior,

35:38.685 --> 35:47.233
all are going to change the atmosphere
which is supposed to be superficial,

35:47.433 --> 35:51.647
so that that also becomes subtler.

35:51.847 --> 35:58.358
I've been saying this in many places, but
at this puja I think it is important to say

35:58.559 --> 36:02.221
that if you are really facing the Adi
Shakti,

36:02.422 --> 36:07.911
then you must know your powers are
boundless.

36:09.495 --> 36:15.047
You have to just assert those powers.

36:15.351 --> 36:21.243
It is not a stationary power. It’s, there's
a movement in it,

36:21.443 --> 36:24.877
and there's a right type of a movement.

36:25.077 --> 36:29.664
It knows where to enter, how to work it
out. Now look at this place.

36:29.864 --> 36:35.398
Can you imagine Me thinking about a place
like this?

36:35.599 --> 36:39.336
But I was just had in mind of course,
I must say,

36:39.536 --> 36:43.252
that we should have some place here,
because

36:43.453 --> 36:50.156
the American Sahaja yogis didn't have any
place to meet - that's all.

36:50.357 --> 36:53.325
And see how I got it!

36:53.525 --> 36:59.279
But the desire to do all this

36:59.479 --> 37:05.906
should be there within your subtler level,
and then it works.

37:06.107 --> 37:09.687
It works, it's like a magic, I tell you.

37:09.887 --> 37:15.883
Now you have faith in yourself and decide
about it.

37:16.084 --> 37:23.953
I am so very happy that it has been
achieved

37:24.153 --> 37:30.465
with such ease - unbelievable, with such
ease.

37:30.666 --> 37:36.702
Absolutely, nothing great was done.

37:36.902 --> 37:41.935
The way we got this was so simple,

37:42.135 --> 37:47.643
that just like another Sahaja yogi
the person was to sell us

37:47.844 --> 37:55.180
came down so excited, and he just sold it
to us, finished.

37:55.728 --> 38:01.272
We didn't have to do anything to convince
him

38:01.472 --> 38:08.736
or to talk to him or reduce the price -
nothing. And he sold it out to us.

38:08.937 --> 38:14.522
In the same way whatever on a subtler level
you desire,

38:14.722 --> 38:20.990
it becomes a terrific force which moves
by itself,

38:21.190 --> 38:32.291
which knows where to go, how to enter, into
which area, and it gets the thing done.

38:32.522 --> 38:41.581
It's something we all should experience,
and work it out with full confidence.

38:41.781 --> 38:47.436
It is the love that we have, the concern
we have.

38:47.636 --> 38:54.211
This is the power that has given us
Self-realization, and this is the power

38:54.411 --> 39:00.189
that has given us this enrichment
of achievements.

39:00.390 --> 39:05.415
I am sure all of you who are here will
realize

39:05.615 --> 39:10.678
how it was done - I mean, so quickly.
This is one of the things

39:10.878 --> 39:19.397
that should just tell you what we are
capable of doing,

39:20.735 --> 39:23.724
what we are capable of achieving.

39:23.925 --> 39:33.077
And when you think of so many people who
are lost in the mire of ignorance,

39:33.277 --> 39:38.076
we should really feel from inside that
concern

39:38.277 --> 39:48.477
and that hankering, "How can I help these
people?"

39:48.802 --> 39:53.043
And you'll be amazed, once you think like
that,

39:53.244 --> 39:57.536
how this divine Power, this Force, will
come in.

39:57.736 --> 40:06.382
Forget about petty things and petty
problems, they're nothing.

40:06.582 --> 40:10.877
You have such a powerful thing behind you.

40:11.077 --> 40:16.749
It's true that all this universe was
created, everything was created

40:16.949 --> 40:20.042
and then you were created, and all that
is done.

40:20.242 --> 40:24.588
But the greatest thing this Power has done
is to create

40:24.788 --> 40:28.900
Sahaja yogis. This is the greatest thing.

40:29.100 --> 40:37.227
Those who have knowledge, those who have
the pure knowledge

40:37.428 --> 40:45.014
and those who have the divine love in their
heart,

40:45.215 --> 40:50.582
what a tremendous personality it is. Just
think of that,

40:50.782 --> 40:59.235
and you will get all the opportunities
to express that love.

40:59.435 --> 41:02.793
So may God bless you.
