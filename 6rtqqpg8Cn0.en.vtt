17:26.839 --> 17:30.600
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.760
It gives Me tremendous pleasure

17:39.960 --> 17:44.640
to be among the people of Milan,

17:44.839 --> 17:48.839
which means the middle, the middle path.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.800
The people who are in the middle path

18:03.000 --> 18:06.520
are the best suited for their ascent,

18:13.800 --> 18:16.680
because those who go to extremes

18:16.960 --> 18:20.200
go away from reality.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.480
But those who lead a moderate life,

18:30.800 --> 18:34.000
a balanced life, a sensible life,

18:34.240 --> 18:37.280
are very well suited for their ascent.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.839
Now when we are seeking the truth,

18:50.040 --> 18:53.280
we have to know also what is the truth.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.080
The truth is that we are the Spirit.

19:04.320 --> 19:10.200
We are not this body, this physical being, this mental being,

19:10.600 --> 19:14.199
but we are the Spirit, the spiritual being.

19:24.960 --> 19:29.080
In the process of our evolutionary ascent

19:29.520 --> 19:34.160
we have come to this stage where we are called as human beings.

19:41.960 --> 19:46.840
But we have not found yet our absolute.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.919
We live in a very relative world.

19:56.839 --> 20:00.840
That is why we are so restless, there are problems of wars,

20:01.120 --> 20:04.199
there are problems of disintegration.

20:12.839 --> 20:15.639
Now whatever I’m going to tell you

20:15.839 --> 20:18.639
is the knowledge of the roots.

20:18.839 --> 20:21.919
We know the tree but not the roots.

20:31.760 --> 20:35.000
Italy is a country of traditions.

20:35.280 --> 20:39.240
In the same way India is a country of tradition

20:39.560 --> 20:42.760
but traditions of spirituality.

20:54.040 --> 20:57.960
There have been people seeking in that country since ages,

20:58.240 --> 21:00.840
and they have been able to find out something

21:01.120 --> 21:03.839
so great about ourselves.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.920
But there is no doubt

21:20.160 --> 21:24.640
there are many fake people who have come abroad to make money.

21:33.120 --> 21:37.120
One thing we must understand that we have become human beings,

21:37.600 --> 21:41.760
we have evolved to this state without paying any money for it.

21:50.320 --> 21:54.480
Anybody who takes money in the name of God or Divine

21:54.680 --> 22:00.040
or any other power is a person who is absolutely fake.

22:08.839 --> 22:12.879
Secondly, we have become human beings without any effort

22:13.200 --> 22:16.040
so it has to be effortless. If it is a living process,

22:16.280 --> 22:19.120
it has to be absolutely effortless.

22:31.880 --> 22:36.160
If our evolution is done by some living process,

22:36.480 --> 22:39.640
it has to be spontaneous. You cannot force a seed

22:39.840 --> 22:43.679
to sprout out of the Mother Earth, can you?

22:55.880 --> 23:00.720
So now people may say, “Then how do we become the Spirit?”

23:06.040 --> 23:08.960
Sahaja word means: “Saha” means “with” and “ja” means “born.”

23:09.160 --> 23:11.640
It’s born with you. The right to become the Spirit

23:11.839 --> 23:14.000
is born with you.

23:23.080 --> 23:26.159
That is you have a right to be the Spirit,

23:26.480 --> 23:29.720
you have the mechanism within yourself to be the Spirit,

23:29.920 --> 23:33.160
and that you are going to be the Spirit.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.280
As you have been told about the centers within us,

23:46.600 --> 23:49.760
these seven centers are nothing but the milestones

23:49.960 --> 23:52.800
of our evolutionary state.

24:01.280 --> 24:04.639
And this evolutionary state is to be expressed now

24:04.839 --> 24:09.040
at its highest point where you become the Spirit.

24:15.840 --> 24:19.800
But it is not any kind of an external behavior

24:20.000 --> 24:22.840
that is going to make that.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.040
Some people believe that if they change their dress

24:31.240 --> 24:34.960
or if they jump or then they shout or stand on their heads,

24:35.160 --> 24:39.800
they will become the Spirits – is absolutely not possible.

24:51.839 --> 24:55.639
Or some people believe that becoming abnormal personalities

24:55.839 --> 24:58.120
you will achieve something, is absolutely absurd.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.560
You have to be a very normal person.

25:11.320 --> 25:15.760
So the truth is that will happen to you, is in your awareness,

25:15.960 --> 25:19.040
in your central nervous system.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.480
We must accept the truth as it is

25:30.680 --> 25:35.720
and we should not force ourselves or force the truth to be like us.

25:42.680 --> 25:45.800
Now when you become the Spirit

25:46.080 --> 25:49.120
then what happens that we should see.

25:55.280 --> 25:59.879
Like Christ, He said that, “You are to be born again.”

26:05.560 --> 26:07.679
So Nicodemus said, “Do you mean to say

26:07.880 --> 26:11.640
that I have to enter into my mother’s womb again?”

26:18.720 --> 26:21.640
So He said, “No, you are to be born of the Holy Ghost.

26:21.839 --> 26:23.200
The Spirit is born of the Spirit,

26:23.520 --> 26:26.839
and whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit.”

26:33.960 --> 26:36.640
But many people are self-certified.

26:36.839 --> 26:39.720
They call themselves “born-again,” all kinds of things,

26:39.920 --> 26:43.320
and they believe that they are perfectly all right.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.840
And that is the reason why today the modern people

26:54.040 --> 26:56.320
don’t want to believe in anything that is divine

26:56.640 --> 26:59.960
because they see the people who are professing religion and God

27:00.160 --> 27:02.240
are horrible people.

27:12.160 --> 27:15.640
There is no connection with the Divine. When there is no connection,

27:15.839 --> 27:19.839
how can you have the power to be that which is Divine?

27:26.000 --> 27:28.800
Like this instrument, if it is not connected to the mains,

27:29.000 --> 27:30.880
is useless.

27:39.040 --> 27:43.000
In this way we all should be connected to the Divine,

27:43.200 --> 27:46.960
which is the all pervading power of God.

27:53.760 --> 27:58.200
Now this power exists whether you believe it or not.

28:01.839 --> 28:04.839
It pulsates into the atoms and molecules.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.480
It pulsates in your heart.

28:07.720 --> 28:12.840
It is everywhere working out so many things which are living.

28:20.080 --> 28:24.240
We in our ego think we can do so many things.

28:27.320 --> 28:31.320
But what do we do? We do dead work – from dead to dead.

28:35.680 --> 28:39.040
We cannot produce one living flower,

28:39.280 --> 28:44.280
and we cannot transform it into a fruit. Not even one.

28:51.839 --> 28:54.520
So who does this living work? There must be

28:54.720 --> 28:58.040
some sort of a power that does this work.

29:04.480 --> 29:08.920
Now the people may say that, “This is nature.”

29:09.120 --> 29:12.280
Whatever you may call, but this nature thinks, understands.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.959
Because at different time of seasons,

29:15.160 --> 29:19.760
different types of flowers come. What a tremendous task it is.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.000
Now to become Spirit is your right.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.640
And to become Spirit

29:35.839 --> 29:39.080
is the way you have to be, that has to be.

29:39.280 --> 29:43.160
Otherwise the problems of this world cannot be solved.

29:54.160 --> 29:58.640
So when the Kundalini, which is the true desire within you,

29:58.839 --> 30:01.879
manifests itself and you start feeling the cool breeze

30:02.080 --> 30:04.600
of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

30:04.800 --> 30:08.159
Then first thing that happens to you that in your awareness

30:08.520 --> 30:11.800
you become collectively conscious.

30:25.480 --> 30:28.640
I’m saying, “You become.” It is not a certificate.

30:28.840 --> 30:31.639
It is not that you just feel like that

30:31.840 --> 30:35.639
or you mentally think like that. It happens to you.

30:45.560 --> 30:49.080
You can feel it, the cool breeze on top of your head coming out.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.120
Cool breeze on top of your head is the real baptism

30:52.320 --> 30:54.560
and not an artificial one.

31:06.640 --> 31:10.560
Now also you start feeling cool breeze in your hand.

31:10.760 --> 31:13.280
You start feeling this power all around,

31:13.600 --> 31:18.240
this subtle, the subtlest of the power,

31:18.560 --> 31:20.560
as it is ether all spread,

31:20.760 --> 31:24.080
you start feeling it on your finger tips.

31:34.120 --> 31:38.239
It is not an artificial belief that you start feeling.

31:38.560 --> 31:42.760
You just feel it nicely on your finger tips.

31:47.760 --> 31:50.040
Mohammed Sahib has said in Koran

31:50.280 --> 31:53.920
– at length He has described the time of resurrection –

31:54.120 --> 31:58.239
that, “At the time of Resurrection your hands will speak.”

32:07.120 --> 32:11.679
But in the Islam people don’t talk of the Resurrection day.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.640
Even in the Christian religion people don’t talk

32:14.839 --> 32:17.720
of The Comforter to come. They talk of the doomsday

32:17.920 --> 32:22.160
because then they are very powerful by that frightening stuff.

32:36.080 --> 32:41.839
This all pervading power is the power of compassion, of love.

32:48.520 --> 32:52.320
It is the most powerful power that you could think of.

32:57.240 --> 33:00.840
It is neutralizing power of all that is ugly,

33:01.040 --> 33:04.879
of all that is grotesque, of all that is immoral.

33:13.960 --> 33:18.080
When the Kundalini rises She integrates you, all your chakras,

33:18.280 --> 33:22.600
by that She integrates all your beings within you.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.839
For example if you are doing something, we feel

33:36.040 --> 33:37.960
that we should not have done it, that’s wrong.

33:38.160 --> 33:43.000
We are not sure of whatever we have done is good or bad.

33:50.040 --> 33:54.200
That means we live in the world of relativity not of absolute.

33:59.080 --> 34:02.560
But when you start feeling these vibrations on your hand

34:02.760 --> 34:08.560
of the Divine, you do not anymore live with relative world.

34:20.120 --> 34:24.639
It is fantastic to know how fantastic you are,

34:29.920 --> 34:34.280
how glorious you are within yourself when you get your Realization.

34:39.719 --> 34:45.839
You become a new personality. Like an egg becoming a bird.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.280
As a bird. Become as an egg, but comes a bird.

35:02.120 --> 35:06.240
And you start feeling that absoluteness.

35:06.560 --> 35:10.160
You ask any questions. You can ask a question, “Is there God?”:

35:10.560 --> 35:13.799
You start getting tremendous cool breeze.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.920
“Was Christ the son of God?”: You get tremendous breeze.

35:17.120 --> 35:21.600
But if you ask about a man who is not a good person,

35:21.839 --> 35:25.279
then immediately your hand starts burning.

35:47.120 --> 35:50.720
Because the Spirit is the collective being,

35:50.920 --> 35:52.839
your attention becomes collective.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.840
You can pay attention to anyone sitting down here.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.680
Just like ether you can feel another person,

35:58.880 --> 36:02.520
you can know about another person and you can cure another person

36:02.760 --> 36:04.800
– any far away.

36:18.839 --> 36:21.920
And such a person develops his innocence back like a child.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.520
And his eyes become so innocent

36:24.720 --> 36:27.040
that the power of eyes is so great

36:27.280 --> 36:30.839
that only looking at a person he can cure that person.

36:43.680 --> 36:46.160
The lust and greed drops out of your eyes,

36:46.480 --> 36:49.720
and you become innocent and powerful.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.640
Then the person who gets Realization can suddenly become

36:57.839 --> 37:00.080
extremely dynamic and extremely creative

37:00.280 --> 37:02.480
because of the blessings of the second center

37:02.680 --> 37:05.839
which is the center of creativity. That, I have known somebody

37:06.040 --> 37:08.200
who had never seen any wood or anything,

37:08.520 --> 37:10.720
and he has now become a rich man

37:10.920 --> 37:14.160
just doing interior decoration after Realization.

37:33.480 --> 37:38.640
Such a person becomes extremely aware of the aesthetics

37:38.839 --> 37:42.640
of a personality, of the buildings, of everything.

37:42.839 --> 37:46.000
The aesthetics, the deeper sense of aesthetics starts

37:46.200 --> 37:48.879
bubbling through his awareness.

38:05.680 --> 38:07.960
And the last of all he becomes deft,

38:08.200 --> 38:10.480
He becomes expert in handling this power

38:10.680 --> 38:13.680
and in giving Realization to others

38:13.880 --> 38:16.680
and curing others and helping others.

38:30.240 --> 38:35.680
Through the, through the blessings of the center of the Nabhi,

38:35.880 --> 38:39.480
which we call as the Manipur Chakra,

38:39.760 --> 38:43.480
you get the power by which you become a person

38:43.680 --> 38:49.200
absolutely upright, righteous and virtuous.

39:08.160 --> 39:12.640
I have seen people dropping all their bad habits

39:12.880 --> 39:15.320
in one night sometimes, in one night.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.799
Forgetting about the past completely and becoming

39:18.000 --> 39:21.920
very different people of complete beauty

39:22.120 --> 39:26.920
and divinity after Realization.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.600
As the blessing of the heart chakra,

39:45.800 --> 39:49.640
you become a person completely secured within yourself,

39:49.840 --> 39:53.720
absolutely settled with yourself.

40:04.320 --> 40:08.120
You neither aggress others nor take aggression upon yourself.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.320
You feel so happy with yourself

40:16.640 --> 40:19.560
and you give happiness to others and security to others,

40:19.760 --> 40:22.600
and others feel nice in your company.

40:29.800 --> 40:32.080
You can see in the life of Christ this has happened

40:32.480 --> 40:36.040
that when people were throwing stones at Mary Magdalene,

40:36.280 --> 40:40.160
He came and stood up before them fearlessly. He was fearless.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.240
And He said, “Those who have not committed any sin

40:43.560 --> 40:46.480
may throw the stone at Me.”

41:05.760 --> 41:07.880
You are not afraid to talk, tell the truth.

41:08.120 --> 41:10.720
You are not afraid to tell what is wrong.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.680
You are not afraid of anyone,

41:12.880 --> 41:16.920
but just you are always in a blissful state

41:17.120 --> 41:19.720
of self-assurance.

41:32.000 --> 41:36.800
In My work for the last 15 years

41:37.000 --> 41:39.520
I’ve been flouting at all the fake gurus,

41:39.800 --> 41:42.800
right from the very beginning, taking their names and telling them

41:43.000 --> 41:45.280
what sort of horrible people they are.

41:45.600 --> 41:51.319
But nobody has dared to put Me to any trouble whatsoever.

42:09.520 --> 42:11.120
Because they know they are wrong;

42:11.320 --> 42:13.880
they know they are doing harm to people.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.640
They are trying to make money, they are befooling

42:16.839 --> 42:19.000
and they are nasty people. They know it.

42:19.200 --> 42:23.160
And once they know it, they dare not face the reality.

42:40.839 --> 42:44.120
So one develops that sense of security within yourself

42:44.320 --> 42:47.040
because you are the Spirit.

42:55.920 --> 43:01.839
At the center of your Vishuddhi, which is placed here,

43:02.320 --> 43:06.560
you develop a personality which is very balanced

43:06.800 --> 43:09.320
and a personality which is very collective.

43:09.720 --> 43:13.759
Now I would say that I have so many powers supposing.

43:14.000 --> 43:18.240
I have powers so I am a capitalist. But I’m a communist,

43:18.560 --> 43:22.680
because I cannot live without distributing it to others.

43:50.800 --> 43:52.640
By God’s grace I’m happily married,

43:52.839 --> 43:54.680
I have a nice family, I have grandchildren,

43:54.880 --> 43:59.600
but I can’t live without giving what they are having their own.

43:59.800 --> 44:02.839
I have to give it. I have to do it.

44:13.920 --> 44:17.800
But this is the greatest joy-giving thing

44:18.000 --> 44:19.960
that you receive what is yours.

44:20.160 --> 44:24.879
Because I know you have this and I must give you what is yours.

44:33.920 --> 44:36.120
As the blessing of this chakra,

44:36.320 --> 44:40.680
which is actually placed in the optic chiasm, a very subtle chakra,

44:40.880 --> 44:43.840
which is called as Agnya, that you get

44:44.040 --> 44:46.920
a tremendous blessings of Christ

44:47.120 --> 44:50.120
because this is the center of Christ.

45:02.839 --> 45:05.799
Now they say that He died for our sins.

45:06.000 --> 45:10.320
One must listen to it very carefully. They say He died for our sins.

45:10.640 --> 45:14.839
So what does He do, when He’s awakened, what does He do for us?

45:25.920 --> 45:28.600
When He is awakened at this point

45:28.839 --> 45:31.839
then what He does He sucks in, from both the sides.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.279
You can see the yellow and the …

45:34.600 --> 45:37.640
it’s a very small thing for you to see.

45:37.839 --> 45:43.000
But we have two big pouches in our head called ego and superego.

45:43.200 --> 45:45.319
He sucks them in.

46:02.839 --> 46:05.799
So the conditioning we have from the superego

46:06.000 --> 46:10.800
and the aggression we have from the ego, both are sucked in.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.640
So that a gap is made here

46:23.839 --> 46:27.520
for the Kundalini to rise in the fontanel bone area.

46:36.839 --> 46:38.960
So now we don’t have to suffer anymore.

46:39.160 --> 46:41.279
He has suffered for us sufficiently.

46:41.600 --> 46:44.720
If you ask for sufferings, it would be dangerous.

46:53.320 --> 46:56.600
I do not know from where this idea as suffering has come.

46:56.839 --> 47:02.320
Because Jews believed in sufferings and they suffered.

47:10.680 --> 47:14.759
There is no need to suffer. Only if you awaken Christ here,

47:14.960 --> 47:19.120
then the whole problem of our past deeds,

47:19.320 --> 47:22.280
which are called as sins or anything

47:22.600 --> 47:27.120
or whatever is our aggressiveness, everything is sucked in.

47:44.520 --> 47:47.080
And at that point we become thoughtlessly aware.

47:47.280 --> 47:49.839
There is no thought.

47:58.080 --> 48:00.839
Thought is the biggest problem these days.

48:06.520 --> 48:08.920
One doctor told Me that, “You can cut my throat,

48:09.120 --> 48:12.839
do what you like Mother, but take away this thinking mind.

48:13.080 --> 48:15.160
It’s all the time thinking.”

48:24.000 --> 48:26.200
Now, one thought rises and falls off,

48:26.560 --> 48:28.640
another thought rises and falls off;

48:28.839 --> 48:31.799
We live on the cusp of the thoughts. And that’s why we are jumping,

48:32.000 --> 48:36.040
our attention is very much restless.

48:46.920 --> 48:49.960
So in between these two thoughts of the past and the future

48:50.160 --> 48:53.640
we have in the center, a place where

48:53.839 --> 48:56.040
the Kundalini pierces through.

49:06.080 --> 49:10.839
And when that happens, then you become thoughtlessly aware.

49:17.720 --> 49:20.160
Then all the petty thoughts of possessions,

49:20.480 --> 49:23.600
petty thoughts of jealousy, of lust and greed

49:23.800 --> 49:27.080
and all these petty things, just drop out.

49:37.000 --> 49:40.640
Then you become in command of yourself, absolutely in command.

49:40.839 --> 49:43.799
If you want, you will think, otherwise you will not think.

49:53.040 --> 49:55.120
But now the thoughts that come to you,

49:55.320 --> 49:58.040
come to you as true knowledge.

50:04.720 --> 50:07.080
Mostly I work in the villages of India,

50:07.320 --> 50:10.200
and one day I was going on a bullock cart

50:10.520 --> 50:13.320
with a gentleman who is a Sahaja Yogi.

50:13.680 --> 50:17.480
And I was amazed, he was talking like a great saint.

50:31.480 --> 50:34.120
He is not educated, he has never seen the world.

50:34.320 --> 50:38.760
He lives in a village, but he talks like a saint.

50:47.920 --> 50:51.840
What university Christ went to? What university Nanaka went into?

50:52.120 --> 50:54.759
Where do they go to study? Socrates? Nothing.

50:54.960 --> 50:58.200
They had all the knowledge within themselves.

51:07.160 --> 51:10.640
They sometimes ask Me, “Mother, are your disciples all scholars?”

51:10.839 --> 51:14.720
I said, “No, they are very ordinary people.”

51:16.839 --> 51:20.480
"All your children are they, are they scholars?"

51:34.000 --> 51:39.200
But they are connected with the true knowledge which is fantastic.

51:44.640 --> 51:47.680
And whatever they want to know, they know it.

51:51.120 --> 51:57.839
Because Spirit is connected with the true source of knowledge.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.680
Above that, when you enter into the limbic area

52:06.880 --> 52:10.839
that is the Kingdom of God, that is promised to you long time back.

52:18.680 --> 52:22.640
And when you pierce through this and you establish yourself

52:22.839 --> 52:26.720
then you become doubtlessly aware, called as Nirvikalpa.

52:41.480 --> 52:44.560
Powers of such a person are tremendous.

52:48.320 --> 52:51.880
He’s forgiveness personified, he is compassion personified

52:52.080 --> 52:54.839
and he is extremely powerful.

53:02.840 --> 53:05.160
Mahatma Gandhi said once that, “Non-violence

53:05.480 --> 53:08.839
can be only practiced by the powerful.”

53:10.320 --> 53:14.080
SY: Excuse me.
SM: Should be practiced only by powerful people.

53:21.520 --> 53:25.560
What is the non-violence of the weak? It has no meaning.

53:28.560 --> 53:33.640
In the same way all the great saints, all the great prophets,

53:33.839 --> 53:36.040
all of them has promised these days

53:36.240 --> 53:39.319
that you have to have your Realization.

53:49.480 --> 53:51.480
About 200 years back

53:51.680 --> 53:55.520
a great saint was born in England, called as William Blake.

53:55.720 --> 53:58.919
You too had Dante such a great saint in Italy.

53:59.120 --> 54:02.080
In the same way there was a great saint born

54:02.320 --> 54:04.200
as William Blake in England,

54:04.520 --> 54:08.240
who has described in details about Sahaja Yoga.

54:26.080 --> 54:30.279
He has prophesized about Sahaja Yoga in such details

54:30.640 --> 54:32.879
and has told that,

54:33.080 --> 54:35.920
“The men of God will become prophets.

54:36.160 --> 54:40.640
And they’ll have powers to make others prophets.”

54:57.480 --> 55:00.200
That time has come today.

55:02.839 --> 55:05.480
And we have to work out in a way

55:05.680 --> 55:08.560
that you all get your Realization.

55:15.800 --> 55:18.200
It cannot be guaranteed.

55:19.839 --> 55:23.759
But it can be guaranteed that if not today, tomorrow

55:23.960 --> 55:27.680
or day after you’ll get your Realization in any case.

55:36.680 --> 55:40.120
But after Realization you have to respect your Realization

55:40.320 --> 55:43.240
and you have to lead a life

55:43.560 --> 55:47.680
according to the understanding of this divine power.

55:57.680 --> 56:00.799
At the most you need about a month, about a month.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.880
People who got Realization in Milan only three weeks back

56:04.080 --> 56:06.960
are now great Sahaja yogis.

56:15.760 --> 56:19.800
So it is not so difficult as people think. Nothing is difficult.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.520
It is sahaja: “Sahaj” also means “very easy.”

56:29.600 --> 56:34.640
Because it is vital. Anything that is vital has to be easy.

56:35.680 --> 56:38.839
Vital. Very necessary for life.

56:45.560 --> 56:46.640
Like our breathing.

56:46.839 --> 56:48.640
For our breathing if you have to go to the library

56:48.839 --> 56:52.040
and find out how to breath, how many will exist?

56:59.480 --> 57:03.720
Even children get the Realization in no time and they are experts.

57:10.760 --> 57:17.560
It is so innate. It is so beautiful that we all should have it.

57:26.600 --> 57:29.640
I’m very much thankful to you, to all the people of Milan

57:29.839 --> 57:32.240
who have taken trouble to come today and I hope

57:32.560 --> 57:35.560
you’ll come again tomorrow. I’ll explain to you more things

57:35.760 --> 57:38.600
about the three channels that are within us

57:38.839 --> 57:44.320
and hope today we’ll be able to work out the Kundalini-awakening.

57:58.320 --> 58:01.600
Now we will have, first of all, some questions if you have.

58:01.800 --> 58:05.240
And then we’ll start giving you this experience,

58:05.560 --> 58:09.759
which is very simple, very easy to manifest.

58:11.800 --> 58:13.520
Warren, I have to get now?

58:13.720 --> 58:17.240
SM: Yes. They can ask some questions. Few question they can ask.

58:29.720 --> 58:34.720
All right. Let them ask. One by one. All right.

59:19.600 --> 59:23.920
All right. I'll, I'll work it out, all right? Don't you worry.

59:25.200 --> 59:28.960
He is saying that something has happened to him two years back,

59:29.200 --> 59:32.279
and he doesn’t know what has happened. [Apart: The voice is going].

59:32.800 --> 59:35.080
So... It's all right.

59:35.360 --> 59:36.360
SY: Needs to be amplified Mother.

59:36.560 --> 59:39.240
SM: No, it's all right, it will work out. It's catching so much.

59:39.440 --> 59:41.000
SY: o.k.

59:41.320 --> 59:45.880
And I told him that "I'll work it out. Don’t you worry."

59:46.200 --> 59:49.720
He feels the pressure on his head. So he’ll be fine.

59:57.920 --> 01:00:01.040
Guido, just come. What's he's saying? She's saying something.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.160
What is she saying?

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.960
Liver?

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:30.400
Yes. Don't you... That, that will be worked out, all right?

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:34.080
Yes, yes. Everything will be all right. Don't you worry.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.960
Yes, yes, nothing to worry.

01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.920
Yes, it will work out. Yes.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.319
Don't you worry, Madam.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.279
It's all right. You see it's better

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.000
to have these questions than to have horrible ones.

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.000
Yes, Shri Mataji.

01:01:20.839 --> 01:01:23.040
No, I told her.

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.799
But tomorrow again I'll tell it, all right? That's a big question.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.920
So don't you have a program? Oh, we have no program for tomorrow?

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.200
Only one?

01:01:34.839 --> 01:01:38.680
I thought there's a program tomorrow.

01:01:42.839 --> 01:01:45.440
Yes, Madam.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:12.440
All these babajis, dadajis should be thrown in the [Hindi].

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.440
Luckily, luckily you have a center in Milan.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:51.400
SY: Can you give the mike...?

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.799
It's all right. The [unclear] it's coming out if they can hear me.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.120
Can you hear me, all of you there?

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:02.000
SM: Fine, then I'll stand.
SY: I'll keep it for you.

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:08.640
SM: She is asking that, “How are we to continue with it?”

01:03:08.839 --> 01:03:13.279
I have to say that luckily we have a very good center here in Milan,

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.880
and everybody will help you out, tell you all about it,

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.600
and you don’t have to pay anything whatsoever.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:21.080
Now, there’s a lady who asked Me how she can get rid of

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.640
evil forces upon herself.

01:04:23.839 --> 01:04:25.880
All people who are suffering from such troubles

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.840
or who are suffering from other diseases, anything,

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.000
can come to Sahaja Yoga center,

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.839
and they will be told how to work it out,

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.920
and everybody will help you.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.120
It is a very simple method, very simple.

01:04:55.839 --> 01:04:58.040
SM: What is it?

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:05.040
SY: The relation between the Divine and evil force in our Spirit.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.839
The relation between the Divine and the evil?

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.560
SM: I don’t understand the question.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.040
It says, “What is the relationship between evil and the Divine?”

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.000
There is no relationship. It’s inimical.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.920
SY: No. The question is: “Within us

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.040
how do divine and demonic forces work?”

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.640
SM: Oh, it’s a big question.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.839
It is as simple as this that when you have the light,

01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:40.680
the darkness runs away. It is as simple as that.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.400
I must learn.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.040
SY: When it happens that there is a calcification

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.080
of the brahmarandra there is an [impeachment]

01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.520
an [impeachment]

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:24.160
of the spiritual growing, an impediment.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.640
SM: Why?
SY: She is asking.

01:06:26.839 --> 01:06:28.839
SM: No, no. No, no.

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.520
Even it opens out that’s the beginning,

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:46.680
that’s the beginning of the sprouting.

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.640
As the primule comes out of the seed, you see.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.200
SY: There is a very good question, Shri Mataji.

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.680
“Why Jesus Christ and different other incarnations

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.320
had to pass through the crucifixion?”

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:12.720
SM: Oh, is a question of why Christ had to pass through crucifixion.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.759
From Bible we cannot understand Christ so well

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.800
because only His short life of about four years is really there.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.640
But actually He is Omkara.

01:07:44.839 --> 01:07:47.680
He is the Alpha and Omega as said. He is that.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:51.040
And He took His form

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.880
as an embodiment of innocence.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.760
The original mistake we committed

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.160
when it was the question of Adam and Eve.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.200
Pardon?

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.800
You, you tell Gregoire.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.000
Now at that time we made a mistake.

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.080
If we had listened to what was to be,

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:26.040
we would have been realized souls long time back.

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.600
But we wanted to know everything ourselves

01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:38.040
so we developed a terrible ego.

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:48.800
As a result of that we crossed over within ourselves.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.680
when we raised our heads as human beings,

01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:54.920
we crossed over our attention, and there was a big cross

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.960
through which nothing could pass through.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.479
So the man, the human being was lost

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.880
between the cross-roads of the conditioning and the ego.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:32.240
And to pass the Kundalini through that chakra was an impossibility.

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.639
So before Christ, it was believed in India

01:09:41.839 --> 01:09:44.000
that we have to repent for our misdeeds

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.240
and we have to become very humble to get over our ego.

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.720
But it was prophesized that Mahavishnu will come,

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.880
and He will do the needful for you for Agnya Chakra.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.120
So,

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:17.640
when Christ came, people did not understand Him in the West

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.080
or in Israel and all these places.

01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.519
They never understood Him, what sort of a personality He was.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.120
So Indians still believe that Mahavishnu still has to come

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:38.559
who will suck our ego and superego.

01:10:45.839 --> 01:10:50.519
Krishna has said before Christ that the eternal life

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:56.080
cannot be killed, cannot be crucified, cannot be destroyed.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.839
So Christ came, who was the embodiment of eternal life,

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.040
who was the embodiment of innocence, who could not be killed.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.880
And that’s why His resurrection had to take place.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:21.559
That’s why He was to be crucified to show

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.480
that eternal life can be resurrected.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:49.559
So He was placed at that cross as the symbol of Resurrection.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.320
The message of Christ is Resurrection.

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.840
All right, it was a long question. But if you ask such questions …

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:09.519
I have, I have spoken in London –

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.760
I don’t know, two thousand lectures are there.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:14.640
There are so many lectures I have given all over the world.

01:12:14.839 --> 01:12:17.960
And if you come to Sahaja Yoga, they’ll give you all these tapes and

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.599
you can understand about everything through them.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:41.839
Though every day I’m traveling, traveling, traveling in Europe,

01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:46.560
still it’s so unfortunate that I’m here only for one day.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.080
Next time I’ll come for three days, I promise you.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.839
SY: Oh, thank you.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.400
[Hindi] (Shri Mataji is asking for water)

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:23.480
SM: I’ll start the Realization part.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.840
All the people who are standing can come here and sit here.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.920
It’s all right. Everybody, if you people can move, you can sit here.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.880
You can sit in front. It’s better to be seated,

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:42.760
could be easier for Realization.

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.840
Or you could move inside here.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.080
You could move also here in front.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.400
They could move inside that.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.040
Better sit. Take it.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:16.280
Of course I am going to stand up.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.920
Sitting for a talk.

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.519
Such seekers.

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.640
What did you say?

01:16:24.839 --> 01:16:27.480
You take off your shoes.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.679
We take out our shoes

01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:49.520
because we have to be in contact with the Mother Earth.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:52.520
That’s important.

01:17:13.839 --> 01:17:15.960
And also they can remove spectacles because

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:18.599
they have to keep their eyes shut. So there is no need

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.680
to have spectacles. On the contrary it’s helpful to the eyes.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.839
Now, you have to just sit very comfortably, very comfortably

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:41.320
with both the hands on your lap, just like this.

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.640
The left hand...

01:17:55.840 --> 01:18:01.680
And the left hand is the one that suggests your desire, desire.

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.560
So you put your left hand all the time on your lap.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:16.480
Loudly.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.200
And the right hand is for your action,

01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.839
which is to be used to nourish your different centers.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.800
One has to be in a very cheerful mood,

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.720
not to be in a very melancholy way

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:41.480
because Italians get into that mood sometimes.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.679
Now, put the left hand just like this all the time,

01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:53.640
and the right hand has to go to different centers,

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.280
one on the heart, one here above on the stomach,

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:02.760
one below, and then you retrace it back again up to heart,

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:07.680
then bring it back here and then here and here and maybe here.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:12.000
So that’s all you have to do which I’ll tell you one after another.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.760
But please don’t open your eyes at all, till I tell you.

01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.160
Please don’t open your eyes.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:01.960
It’s the most joyous experience and the highest moment of your life.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:06.639
So you should not be frightened of
anything. Be in a very happy mood.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.840
Nothing will happen to you, as some people have told that

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.280
Kundalini gives this trouble and that trouble.

01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.600
I have seen nobody suffers from this.

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:37.960
Because She is your individual mother.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.000
So She is not going to trouble you at the time of your second birth.

01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:48.160
She takes up all the trouble upon Herself.

01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.280
At the very outset forget the past and forget the future.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.760
Be in the present.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.879
And three times I say, “Please don’t feel guilty.

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.640
Please don’t feel guilty. Please don’t feel guilty.”

01:21:20.839 --> 01:21:23.840
Otherwise I cannot achieve the results.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.320
So before starting you better tell in your heart all the time,

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:43.960
three times that, “I’m not guilty. I’m not guilty. I’m not guilty.”

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.680
You can address Me as Mother

01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:48.880
or as Shri Mataji, whatever you think proper.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.000
Ha, what do you say to "mother" in Italian?

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.160
SY: Madre.
SM: Madre. O.k.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:19.560
SM: All right. So now please close your eyes.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.120
If there is anything tight

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.719
you can loosen it a little bit, anything tight.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.880
But please be comfortable and close your eyes

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:30.080
and keep the left hand like this.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.000
You should not slouch back nor you should be very straight

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.639
but sit comfortably and without putting your head back

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:58.280
or forward but in a comfortable, normal, erect position.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.160
Now please close your eyes.

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:16.400
Just close your eyes.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.360
And say three times in your heart,

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.360
“Mother, I’m not guilty. Mother, I’m not guilty.

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.560
Mother, I’m not guilty.”

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:52.440
Now please put your right hand on your heart.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:01.800
Please don’t open your eyes.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:07.839
Now, in the heart resides your Spirit.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:12.440
Loudly.

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:16.480
In the heart the Spirit is there,

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.560
so you have to ask Me a question inside, not loudly,

01:24:21.839 --> 01:24:25.519
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask the question three times,

01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:28.600
with full confidence in yourself.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Tremendous.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.600
Have full confidence in yourself.

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:56.080
Ask three times.

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:21.000
Now take this right hand down

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.240
onto the upper part of your abdomen, of your stomach

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:29.680
on the left hand side. We are working on the left hand side.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.120
This is the center of the Primordial Master.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:53.360
And as you are the Spirit, logically you are also your own master.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:06.719
So now you have to ask a logical question:

01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:12.200
“Mother, am I my own master?” Ask this question three times.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:29.160
Three times.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.519
Now take this hand, right hand, keeping left hand as it is,

01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:51.839
take the right hand down in the lower part of the abdomen

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:54.960
on the left hand side.

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:16.480
This is the center of true knowledge

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:22.520
of the technique of the divine instrument.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.680
So now, at this point

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.280
you have to ask Me. I cannot cross your freedom.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:42.840
You have to say, “Mother, I want to have my Realization,

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.920
so give me true knowledge."

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:59.760
"Please give me pure knowledge”. Please say it six times

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:03.480
because this center has got six petals.

01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:21.440
"Mother" is better.

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:27.960
Right hand [unclear].

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.639
Now raise this right hand again

01:28:57.839 --> 01:29:03.120
back to the upper part of your abdomen.

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:20.560
This is the center of Primordial Master.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.800
And now the first truth

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.800
you should know that you are your own master,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
and you have to say with full confidence,

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:34.320
“Mother, I am my own master.” And this you have to say ten times.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.839
Say it please ten times.

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:05.879
Loudly, I think. You have to say loudly. Some people can't hear.

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:10.800
SM: Loudly.
SY: Yes, Mother, of course.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.679
Say it with full confidence. You are your own master.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:31.080
You don’t need anyone.

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:48.080
SY: Left side is much better.

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:56.280
Right side.

01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.880
Pani (water in Hindi). Water.

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:07.120
[Hindi]

01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.759
All right.

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:30.560
Now please raise your hand to your heart

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:33.480
where resides the Spirit.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.519
Here now again you have to assert

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:53.640
and assume your power as Spirit

01:31:53.839 --> 01:32:01.480
by saying twelve times: “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:23.040
Very much better.

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:45.880
Now you have to know that the Divine is the ocean of love,

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:48.839
is the ocean of compassion.

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:53.960
Above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.360
And the ocean of love.

01:33:21.480 --> 01:33:24.559
So please don’t feel guilty.

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:34.160
And raise your hand now, right hand, at the base of your neck,

01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:37.000
taking it backwards,

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:43.240
from the front.

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:53.960
This is the center which gets caught up when we feel guilty.

01:33:54.480 --> 01:34:00.240
Now at this point you have to say sixteen times,

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:03.600
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:28.520
Better.

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.560
If you still feel guilty

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:18.640
then to punish yourself, better say hundred and eight times:

01:35:18.839 --> 01:35:21.120
"Mother, I am not guilty."

01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:40.280
Worked out. Now...

01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:50.760
Now raise your hand to your forehead across, right hand.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:01.839
Please close the eyes, don't open them.

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.879
At this point,

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:16.120
because it is the center of Christ, you have to say,

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.400
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:36.920
Now people might say

01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:39.639
that we cannot forgive, it is very difficult.

01:36:39.839 --> 01:36:42.760
But it is mythical.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.240
It's absolutely mythical because

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.560
what do you do when you don`t forgive? You are torturing yourself.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.480
So please say from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone".

01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:13.400
Just forget it. It`s a big load on your head.

01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:33.559
Better.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.000
Hamsa.

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:03.760
Now, put back your hand, right hand,

01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:07.680
on the back of your head at the base of it.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:19.520
Now again,

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:22.800
again without feeling guilty, again, I said, without feeling guilty

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.720
you just say, "If we have done anything wrong,

01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:30.160
if I have done anything wrong against the Divine,

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:34.120
please forgive me." But don't feel guilty!

01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.880
But don't feel guilty for it!

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.160
SY: It's good.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:05.960
It's little bit stuck at the place of the [unclear].

01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.600
Take the head back.

01:39:08.839 --> 01:39:12.240
You can raise your head a little bit towards the sky

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.960
when you`re saying that.

01:39:23.800 --> 01:39:27.000
Better? Better now.

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:30.640
Now,

01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:35.000
please put this hand, right hand, on top of your head

01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:39.080
on the fontanel bone aria where you had a soft bone.

01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:43.320
in your childhood. Press the palm.

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:01.880
And press it hard and try to move it clockwise.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.600
Now, at this point again, I cannot cross your freedom,

01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:19.640
so you have to say

01:40:19.839 --> 01:40:22.280
that, "Mother, I want my Realization.

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:28.400
Please, give me my Realization". I cannot force it on you.

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:50.800
Press it hard and move it clockwise.

01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.719
Please say it seven times.

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:15.040
They are masters.

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.040
Now you can put your right hand down on your lap

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:25.240
and feel from your left hand. Please don't open your eyes,

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:41.320
Raise about four-five inches above.

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:54.080
It is very subtle

01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.080
Now see if there is a cool breeze.

01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:00.040
Or you open your eyes, but don't think.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:03.120
You can see Me, but don't think!

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.240
Start it.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:20.400
You can change your hands and see.

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.120
Watch Me without thinking!

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:43.719
One hand should be like this and another hand should be here to see.

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:47.120
It's done.

01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.600
Put your hand back. Put your hand.

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.280
Good.

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:06.559
Don't think!

01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:24.040
Those who are feeling can just put both the hands like this.

01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.960
Most of them.

01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.920
Now, how to feel it in the hand?

01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:00.800
It`s very important.

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:08.360
First you put up your hands like this and raise your head

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:13.080
and ask a question, "Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:15.960
"Is this the cool breeze of the chaitanya?"

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:19.680
"Is this the Cool Breeze of Brahma?" whichever way you want to ask.

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:23.200
Ask three times.

01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:58.400
Now put down your hands.

01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.240
See, are you feeling the cool breeze in the hands?

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:03.599
You must feel it in the hands. That's important

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.760
Something that is flowing, you'll feel

01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:16.040
some sort of an energy that's flowing. Can feel it this way.

01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:30.600
Now to add to the protection of yourself

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:35.680
we must learn that we have to give a protection to our being,

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:40.560
so that you put your auras into the protection.

01:46:40.840 --> 01:46:43.120
We call it as bandhan in Sanskrit language.

01:46:43.320 --> 01:46:46.839
What you do is to take the left hand from here,

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:51.680
raise it higher and and bring it down, one

01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:56.760
then two, like that. Seven times.

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:25.720
I will tell you. And then you have to raise the Kundalini also, one

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.839
two...

01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:36.120
All of you should do. Yes. Three.

01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:39.400
It will be very helpful for people,

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.360
four

01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:46.680
five,

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:50.280
six,

01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.919
and seven.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.120
Now, how you have to raise your own Kundalini.

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:04.280
Place your left hand in front of the Kundalini

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:07.839
when you are sitting down. Just like this, in front.

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.680
Left hand.

01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:19.200
And the right hand is the action.

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:21.920
You have to move it clockwise around it.

01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:24.639
Like this, and you have to take it up.

01:48:24.839 --> 01:48:26.960
That's how the Kundalini rises. Let us start.

01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:30.200
And then you have to give a knot.

01:48:45.120 --> 01:48:50.240
There is, three times you have to do it and third time, three knots.

01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:59.480
Let's do it now.

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:02.120
Once the left hand.

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.839
Push back your neck.

01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:11.080
Now give it a twist

01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:15.640
and a knot.

01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:20.160
Now, again, once more.

01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:25.320
Slowly, but the hand will be rising faster now.

01:49:26.839 --> 01:49:29.839
Go back.

01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.680
Second time.

01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:37.520
Third time, three knots.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:48.920
Go on.

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:52.920
One,

01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.880
two

01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:57.880
three.

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.760
Now, see.

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.839
All right?

01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:13.640
Now those who are feeling the cool breeze in the head

01:50:13.839 --> 01:50:16.120
or in the hands, raise your hands.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.360
Both hands.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:32.040
Raise both the hands.

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.080
Anything if you have felt here or in the hands.

01:50:46.839 --> 01:50:48.720
What's he is saying?

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.920
SY: I think she's worried about the air conditioning, Mother.

01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.880
SY: Just like everybody from everywhere.

01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:58.040
Everyone feels that way. There's no air conditioning.

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:00.519
Because this works.

01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:05.839
Is there the air conditioning? I didn't know.

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:10.680
All right. Now just see. Let's have
all the people who are feeling it.

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:23.000
May God bless you!

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.720
I hope you will take it up seriously.

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:31.720
Don't talk about it, don't discuss it.

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:36.120
And you must establish yourself like great trees

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.280
And next year I hope to come back to Milan.

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:25.400
Are you all right? Are you all right? [unclear]

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:10.920
He wants to thank. He wants to thank.

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:15.559
SM: This gentleman wants to thank.
SY: All right. Two minutes [unclear].

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:31.800
So all can have My photograph, all of you can.
