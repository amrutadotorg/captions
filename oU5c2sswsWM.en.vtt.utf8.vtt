00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.388
And when we reached there it 
was all covered with ice.

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:11.778
It was about 14-15 hours altogether and that
is the same day we had program - same day

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.219
in the evening, it was a bit too much.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:21.175
I think, next time you should
see that the day I arrive,

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.519
there should be no program
- until next day I can rest.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.910
Aapko aur bhi kisi cheez ke liye
yaad kiya tha bahut

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.050
- Ji haan
- Woh jo aapko case batayi thi na

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.270
- Ji, ji
- Aayiye Hum bata dein

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.300
- Woh log Madras pahunch gaye hain
- Achcha

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.550
wahan kuch zameen khareed li hai aur wahan 
ye laundering ka kaam karne waale hain

00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:56.351
aur Sahaja Yog ke naam se. Aur kise,
aap wahan kisi to aap kehelwa hi dijiye

00:00:56.412 --> 00:00:59.462
- Ji haan
- Aur waise Hum unko Home Ministry

00:00:59.464 --> 00:01:03.204
mein kehla dein kyonki; Hum jaante hain
Dhule sahab jo hain wahan

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:06.942
- par aap agar keh dein to bahut hi achcha hoga.
- Mein kehlata huun

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:12.299
Unka pata bhi hai aur woh sab wahan aane 
waale hain; Usmein se ek Pakistani

00:01:12.383 --> 00:01:15.733
- Achcha. Kisse yeh pata kiya?
- Hmm?

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:17.312
- Kisse yeh pata chala?
- Main batata huun aapko

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:23.432
Yeh inke paas se. Fauran wahan pata kijiye 
kyonki woh aa gaya - 28 tareek to aane
waala tha woh Ravindra

00:01:23.488 --> 00:01:27.458
- Ji, woh jo woh wahan the Sarin?
- Sarin

00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:33.100
Sarin aur jo doosre yeh hain, husband wife 
hain hamare yahan - uska, kya naam uska?

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:38.287
- Zafar, Dr. Zafar hain na
- Nahin, Zafar to doosra hai Pakistani

00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:40.724
- Jesopi?
- Aaya kya?

00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:45.310
- Jesopi, haan Jesopi.
- Jesopi. Woh sab wahin aakar ke 
rehne waale hain

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.940
Unhonne zamin le li hai aur wahan yeh
dhanda karne waale hain.

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:53.293
To waise bhi Jayakar ko bhi hum
inform kar dete hain

00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:55.450
- Theek hai
- aur aap bhi kar dijiye yahan matlab yeh

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.350
ki un logon ne wakayi kuch aisa
kamaal kiya, ki inka kuch ban nahin paaya.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.233
- Abhi bhi nahin ban payega
- Haan, woh bhaag khade hue

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:04.798
- Abhi bhi nahin hoga
- Annh?

00:02:04.798 --> 00:02:06.858
Abhi bhi nahin hoga kisi ko keh 
diya to nahin hoga

00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:12.428
Haan, aur doosra yeh hua ki bada unhonne
matlab wahan se phone kiye - Alka ko bataya

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:17.696
ki Indian government pata nahin kya hai,
humko to pehle itna promise kiya tha

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.580
aur phir kya pata nahin ho gaya
- aise, waise kaafi complaints

00:02:21.584 --> 00:02:25.684
Mera ek apne saath mein padhne ka, saath
hi padha hua dost wahan par, IAS mein hai

00:02:25.684 --> 00:02:30.044
- Haan
- Wahan par secretary hai Tamilnadu mein

00:02:30.044 --> 00:02:33.936
- Finance mein
- haan, wahan Tamilnadu, Madras mein

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:36.793
- Tamilnadu mein - wah, wah
- Usko main phone kar deta huun

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:41.056
- Usse bata dena. Kya naam hai?
- Rajeshwar Singh. Rajjeshwar Singh hai

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:44.180
- hamare saath college mein padhta tha
- Use hi bata dijiye [UNCLEAR]

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.287
Usko bata deta huun, hum usko,
theek kar deinge

00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:50.577
Woh kara lega kyonki yeh hai
gadbad log bilkul. Dekhiye

00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:53.873
- Sahaja yog ke naam se shuru kar rahe
- Nahin, main usko kara doonga. I

00:02:53.873 --> 00:03:00.083
There are so many dangers now in Sahaja 
yoga. Some of the Sahaja yogis think that

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:06.123
they are now Maha-yogis and they start 
talking big about it - very big and

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:09.443
- So, how are you?
- Fine [UNCLEAR]

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:16.442
and some of them are so stupid, I don't 
know what to say; One fellow started saying,

00:03:16.442 --> 00:03:19.241
"I am Adishakti, you see," so I said,
"Alright, why not

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:23.751
send some of My sarees - 
I've too many of them." [LAUGHTER]

00:03:24.411 --> 00:03:31.386
So, it's some sort of a, I don't know,
possession or maybe - very idiotic

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:38.442
and they're educated people and they 
talk like this. Suddenly, a new type of

00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:42.576
problems have started in Sahaja yoga,
I don't know.

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:52.757
It's a kind of a ambition, I think.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.580
I mean, in this gentleman, 
the one who said so,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.351
he is a PhD in Economics - what
do you say to [UNCLEAR].

00:04:03.351 --> 00:04:10.473
- [UNCLEAR]
- I don't know what's happening to
Economics nowadays.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:20.482
It's quite a big problem. Now, there's a
conference now, in Copenhagen,

00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:25.504
of all the Prime Ministers and all that.
They want to find out the solution

00:04:26.704 --> 00:04:32.384
for all the problems we have. Now, they
don't reach the point, that's the thing is

00:04:32.384 --> 00:04:36.615
they should know is the transformation
of human-beings. You cannot have peace

00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:42.839
by talking, by having conferences and 
speeches - not that way.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:48.051
Transformation se hi hoga and this is the 
big problem; No body wants to see the point.

00:04:53.224 --> 00:04:58.154
All kinds of Prime Ministers are going to 
be there - having a nice conference.

00:04:58.488 --> 00:05:07.870
Kholiye. And how can they have peace? 
Also another thing which I'm doing now,

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:13.513
is to write a book but they said that, 
"We'll use this book for the whole price."

00:05:13.716 --> 00:05:19.546
I just don't know what it is. But somebody
has to say here what's happening.

00:05:19.568 --> 00:05:25.348
Now, if you say that the Western culture
is very licentious, permissive

00:05:25.348 --> 00:05:30.966
very immoral and all that but the other 
side is, when you have this kind of a culture

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:37.740
to oppose it, the fundamentalists - they are
also equally immoral, they are also equally;

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.415
They are suppressed people so like, at the
time of Hitler same thing happened.

00:05:43.415 --> 00:05:52.027
Germany was full of, what you can say, 
corruption, immorality - everything.

00:05:52.027 --> 00:05:58.171
Horrible! Very decadent! So, he caught 
hold of young people, started telling them,

00:05:58.171 --> 00:06:06.250
"No, we must have a very moral life and
very austere life," that example and then he

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:14.176
made them fight. So they became enamored
by that but while doing all that,

00:06:14.188 --> 00:06:23.898
they were all suppressed, so the violence
started. That's what is happening with Islam

00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:30.801
One side they're getting destroyed 
because they are very indulgent

00:06:30.807 --> 00:06:37.527
second side is, they are so suppressed - 
they are indulgent also but also very violent,

00:06:37.807 --> 00:06:43.424
so how can you have peace? Only way,
is to have Sahaja culture.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:50.590
That's the only way you can really come up
to something - is to have Sahaja culture.

00:06:51.476 --> 00:07:01.016
In sahaja culture, you are neither oppressed,
neither suppressed nor you are licentious -

00:07:01.176 --> 00:07:05.920
you are in the center. 
Then why will you fight?

00:07:10.294 --> 00:07:14.134
But who's going to tell him - who'll
bell the cat - I don't know.

00:07:14.514 --> 00:07:18.074
So, I'm writing this book but C.P. said, "It's rather strong,"

00:07:18.074 --> 00:07:23.428
I said, "Let it be. Somebody has to tell 
them na." But in no way I've been strong

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:29.120
because I just get some, see anecdotes to
show that. So this is this, this is this.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.598
So, he says, "Very unique style of writing
which makes it very interesting."

00:07:33.734 --> 00:07:41.544
As long as it will go into the heads of people.
So, this way or that way is just the same.

00:07:43.053 --> 00:07:47.403
I've to tell you, one's austerity and
all that, doesn't help.

00:07:48.496 --> 00:07:55.946
Once I was going from Riyadh to London and
the ladies came with their burkha and all that

00:07:55.946 --> 00:08:02.158
and men came, you see, very with this 
all on their head gear and all, with their

00:08:02.163 --> 00:08:05.543
- kya kehte hain jo pehente hain
kapda usko, pathani log?

00:08:05.543 --> 00:08:07.486
- Pathani suit
- Annh?

00:08:08.077 --> 00:08:10.337
- Thoga, thoga
- thoga

00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:13.839
Haan, thog, thoga they call it. Full 
[UNCLEAR] from here to here

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:15.370
- The robe
- Annh?

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.933
- Robe, Mother
- Haan, poora robe - thog kehte usko

00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:31.746
and I went off to sleep and when I got up,
I saw very dandy looking people with [UNCLEAR]

00:08:32.286 --> 00:08:36.365
bow ties and all that. I said, "Now, who 
are these people, they've come from?"

00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:42.631
Very fashionable and the ladies were
in six inches skirts, you see.

00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:44.828
I said, "Now, from where have they come?"

00:08:44.828 --> 00:08:49.518
So I asked the air hostess, "Did we stop 
somewhere else?" She said, "No, we are

00:08:49.518 --> 00:08:54.979
directly flying." I said, "How these people
have come?" Said, "They are the same."

00:08:56.271 --> 00:09:02.901
I said, "Really?" "They are the same." Now even
before reaching London they were prepared for it.

00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:17.244
Aap Mahila pahunch gaye aur wahan se aaye 
hain, ab Mahila se? Kitni dur hai yahan se?

00:09:17.244 --> 00:09:19.370
- Do ghante ki flight hai.
- Bas!

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.245
- Ji haan.
- Arre baba!

00:09:21.245 --> 00:09:24.373
- Phir wahan par aana.
- Aayeinge to bilkul nahin.

00:09:25.182 --> 00:09:28.252
- Wahan Musalmanon ka raj hai?
- Nahin, Shri Mataji. Bahut

00:09:28.252 --> 00:09:30.583
- Catholic hain - sab Christian.
- Catholic log

00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:35.288
Bahut zyada hain. Woh Spanish ne rule kiya
tha to wahan par Catholic hain aur

00:09:35.288 --> 00:09:39.677
badi ajeeb si cheez hai ki, ek taraf to 
log haath mein apne Bible le ke padhte rehte

00:09:39.677 --> 00:09:43.222
hain, padhte rehte hain aur phir fauran
bund karke, jo bhi chahein woh karne ko

00:09:43.222 --> 00:09:48.068
unko khuli choot hai sab ko, sabhi kuch kar sakte
hain. To poora ek ajeeb sa samaj hai wahan par.

00:09:48.374 --> 00:09:53.034
Bilkul licentious - sab kuch khulam khulla
choot hai ek tarah se aur doosri taraf

00:09:53.034 --> 00:09:58.580
sab log church jaate hain. They are all
going to the church regularly

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.964
- Aur culture yehi hai?
- Culture is, they could be horrible

00:10:01.964 --> 00:10:04.895
- [UNCLEAR] America going tomorrow
- Annh, they will go?

00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:09.463
They will go tomorrow and the slogan -
wahan par ek mazak karte hain log idhar ki

00:10:09.463 --> 00:10:14.357
- slogan of the community is, people is, 
'Americans go back and take us with you.'

00:10:14.394 --> 00:10:22.844
So [LAUGHTER]. So you - wahan par ek mazak
hai aur bilkul usse - they're completely

00:10:23.479 --> 00:10:29.079
dominated aur wahan bilkul bhi American
basis hai ek woh khatam ho gaye hain aur

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:32.902
but Catholics hain aur woh kuch
ajeeb tarah ka priests

00:10:32.902 --> 00:10:36.028
Abhi woh wahan woh nahi aaye
evangelists, evangelist?

00:10:36.028 --> 00:10:40.727
- Abhi woh John Paul jo gire the wahan par
- Haan, unke bahut aaye the

00:10:40.828 --> 00:10:46.280
- 16 January ko [UNCLEAR]
- John Paul, what a man he is - really

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:52.762
Ten million people came for the mass on
the 15th of January or... 15th of January

00:10:53.113 --> 00:10:57.453
he was there. He's very strongly
Catholic dominated

00:10:57.453 --> 00:11:02.352
- Conversion
- Conversion nahin but a very bizarre sort of,

00:11:02.352 --> 00:11:06.585
very because it's Catholic on one side 
and then they have no morality,

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:09.529
- no values, no [UNCLEAR]
- Unka sab chaupat hai.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:13.470
See, they can't marry again - 
they can have keeps

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.367
- Yes, most of them
- Most of [UNCLEAR]

00:11:18.367 --> 00:11:21.097
- Shri Mataji, one a day kind of situation
- Achcha!

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.821
- Bilkul, ji haan. Everything is.....
- There's a lot of

00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:28.399
- Must have been
- [UNCLEAR] killers, no problem.

00:11:28.428 --> 00:11:34.038
They can have here as domestic servants
[UNCLEAR] they work for families

00:11:34.038 --> 00:11:37.637
and they bring up the children
in Hong Kong.

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:42.104
- Woh to sab jaate hi hain
- Wahan Sahaja chalega?

00:11:42.104 --> 00:11:46.286
- Ji haan. Abhi to log chahate honge
- Annh?

00:11:46.286 --> 00:11:49.120
- Woh aayein hamare saath mein abhi
- Woh to insaan hi hain

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.631
- Sri Lanka ke hain, Shri Mataji
- Annh?

00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:53.821
- Sri Lanka ke hain?
- Sri Lanka ke hain? Aaap bhi?

00:11:53.821 --> 00:11:57.404
- Ji. Jo wahan baithi hain
- Achcha! Aap bhi Sri Lanka ke?

00:11:57.404 --> 00:12:00.411
- Ji. Hindi nahin bolni aa rahi
- Achcha!

00:12:00.411 --> 00:12:03.801
- She's asking if you are from Sri Lanka?
- Yes, we are

00:12:03.801 --> 00:12:06.581
- and this one
- Annhh ...

00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:11.468
- and we are now
- We have one called Shri Vardhan

00:12:11.468 --> 00:12:16.074
Shri Vardhan. Shri Mataji where
You remember Anuma?

00:12:16.074 --> 00:12:20.257
- Anuma, who brought the first offering?
- Achcha, woh hain wahan?

00:12:20.257 --> 00:12:23.457
- Sri Lankan. He remembers Shri Mataji
- Achcha! Sahaj hai woh?

00:12:23.457 --> 00:12:26.999
Sahaj hain, Shri Mataji. Woh ekdam Sahaja
yogini and she came to Mahila

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:31.763
and talked to [UNCLEAR] to them 
and when I reached there

00:12:31.763 --> 00:12:34.567
we started meditating together,
so now it's

00:12:34.567 --> 00:12:38.093
Sri Lanka mein to ho jayega par
ye Catholic man to

00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:41.183
Use hona padega Mataji;
Aap aayeingi to ho jayega

00:12:41.183 --> 00:12:43.752
- Haan to
- Hum log intezaam kareinge kuch agle saal bhi

00:12:43.768 --> 00:12:49.428
Zaroor aayeinge [UNCLEAR] pata hai, ki
agar aap Christians hain, to ek aankh -

00:12:49.908 --> 00:12:55.258
if one eye does anything wrong, you take it
out. One hand does wrong, you cut your hand;

00:12:55.258 --> 00:12:59.038
I've not seen anybody without a hand
or without the eyes.

00:12:59.063 --> 00:13:01.890
Mahila mein [UNCLEAR] koi bhi na
bachega, sabhi log hain

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:05.900
- Sabhi aise ho jayeinge?
- Sab. Sirf kaale aur gore reh jayeinge wahan par

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.960
Srivastava sahab keh rahe, humne to
koi haath kata dekha nahin.

00:13:12.808 --> 00:13:16.628
This Pope himself is a horrid fellow.

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:23.133
Aapka jo Bofors ka paisa launder
hua hai woh Pope ke through.

00:13:24.319 --> 00:13:27.909
Woh jo hai na Bank of Ambrosia -
Humko saara maloom hai par koi

00:13:27.909 --> 00:13:31.189
- use dhyan nahin de, Hum karein kya?
- Koi maanega nahin

00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:36.903
- Woh dabaa diya hai
- Now with Your blessings Shri Mataji

00:13:36.903 --> 00:13:40.226
- Hain?
- Now with Your blessings we'll see the

00:13:40.226 --> 00:13:42.436
- Ab kuch inka unka bigad gaya hai maamla
- Ji

00:13:42.436 --> 00:13:45.139
- Prime Minister sahab ka aur [UNCLEAR] ji ka
- Achcha

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:48.529
- Haan. Kaafi rishtedaari bigad gayi.
- Achcha hi hai

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:53.209
Hota hi hai. Falsehood mein yehi pehchaan
hai. Jhagde ho jaate hain

00:13:53.384 --> 00:13:56.324
Ab to aur bhi zyada honge

00:14:02.673 --> 00:14:07.763
But somehow Sahaja is spreading
slowly. I mean, I'm surprised

00:14:07.783 --> 00:14:12.093
that in Philippines there's somebody
who's doing sahaja.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:15.589
- Shri Mataji, wahan khoob phail jaayega
- Annh?

00:14:15.589 --> 00:14:19.151
- Wahan khoob fayl jaayega kyonki [UNCLEAR]
- Log pareshaan hain?

00:14:19.151 --> 00:14:22.908
Pareshaan hain Shri Mataji aur yahan main
kaam kar raha huun [UNCLEAR] mein,

00:14:22.927 --> 00:14:24.791
- bahut mulk ke log hain
- Achcha!

00:14:24.791 --> 00:14:30.273
aur sab dhoond rahe, sab dhoond rahe.
Bas ab Aapka ashirwad rahe ki

00:14:30.398 --> 00:14:35.238
- Aapne kaha to ekdam vibrations shuru ho gaye.
- Yes, Shri Mataji, hoga.

00:14:35.238 --> 00:14:39.337
Par yeh aur chakkarbaazi na ho kahin ki -
yeh bhi badi mushkil hai. Abhi Japan mein,

00:14:39.337 --> 00:14:45.197
last time those who came, were all guru
shoppers so they got fed up with them, you see.

00:14:45.197 --> 00:14:51.466
such problems - this problem, that problem
but this time they got better people ki

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:55.466
who had done one of the gurus, is
alright but if you are a guru shopper,

00:14:55.466 --> 00:14:59.236
- to to ho gaya hai kaam waam.
- [UNCLEAR]

00:15:02.662 --> 00:15:06.662
But they are seekers; These people, who
came, are real seekers.

00:15:13.305 --> 00:15:16.685
Catholics, waise theek hai, par they
get Left Vishuddhi very bad.

00:15:16.685 --> 00:15:21.852
- Very bad. Mahila, it's very bad.
- Hmm?

00:15:21.852 --> 00:15:31.143
- Mahila, it's very bad.
- In Spain also there is very great influence

00:15:31.143 --> 00:15:38.063
of Catholicism but Sahaja Yoga is working
out. Portugal is something lost also

00:15:38.447 --> 00:15:45.497
because most of the Portuguese have now
gone to Brazil but in Brazil we're doing

00:15:45.497 --> 00:15:53.417
very well, you see. The mayor of Brazil, he
had came to the airport and brought a key

00:15:53.417 --> 00:16:00.657
for Me and he said, "Mother, this is the 
key of Brazilia, so please bless Brazilia

00:16:00.657 --> 00:16:07.417
and give us peace." So nice, really,
I was so surprised

00:16:08.908 --> 00:16:12.388
and then he came to program,
he got his realization.

00:16:12.388 --> 00:16:20.124
But recently I saw there is one, some
- I forget the name - one of these -

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:29.438
- kya kehte usko, log abhi [UNCLEAR]
- Evangelist

00:16:29.438 --> 00:16:36.049
Haan, Evangelist - uss aadmi ka naam yaad nahin - one Evangelist and thousands

00:16:36.049 --> 00:16:42.708
stupidly are there and they are supposed
to pay 10% of their salaries, all of them

00:16:42.708 --> 00:16:48.046
So now, government has an objection
to that. Somebody came from America,

00:16:48.046 --> 00:16:59.497
this Evangelist. They are so funny. One 
day in Hawaii, we had finished the program

00:16:59.497 --> 00:17:05.207
and it's 12 0'clock, I said, "Let's see 
what's coming in the news or something."

00:17:05.207 --> 00:17:13.733
What we find, Evangelists. He had a hundred 
dollar note, you see. He was saying, "See,

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:20.761
this if you give, then you get the real
blessings." [UNCLEAR] LAUGHTER

00:17:20.761 --> 00:17:29.413
There were five of these - one lady had with
her for her groceries and she gave it to us

00:17:29.413 --> 00:17:35.715
and can you imagine, the grocery arrived
on her doorstep. They're so stupid,

00:17:35.715 --> 00:17:44.412
these Americans, they believe this and then
they say the grocery started pouring from the

00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:52.996
roof - can you imagine? And very well 
sitting there - hmm, which as if they've lost.

00:17:54.825 --> 00:17:59.295
Even they mesmerize somebody -
you cannot digest such a thing - isn't it?

00:18:02.575 --> 00:18:08.095
Such blatant thing they were talking
and Dev Dumphy was there;

00:18:08.095 --> 00:18:13.362
looking as if he couldn't believe it. I 
said, "These are Americans , you know."

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:16.813
Bade stupid log hain - Americans
are very stupid.

00:18:17.375 --> 00:18:19.375
- Bahut bhole hain, Shri Mataji
- Annh?

00:18:19.375 --> 00:18:20.882
- Bahut bhole hain.
- Bhole nahin, bewakoof hain.

00:18:20.882 --> 00:18:22.950
- Bewakoof hain
- Stupid, idiotic

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.103
- [UNCLEAR]
- They take to all idiotic things.

00:18:26.798 --> 00:18:30.388
Abhi woh aajlal, aapka Deepak Chopra,
is making all the money.

00:18:30.388 --> 00:18:33.881
- Haanji, haanji, haanji.
- They have also, somehow or the other,

00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:40.175
managed, I think, the British government,
who are going to give them a land

00:18:40.175 --> 00:18:46.153
for starting a University. British ki bhi 
khopdi kharaab ho gayi.

00:18:47.225 --> 00:18:54.605
University they have and they give some sort
of fake degrees - nobody thinks much of it.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.830
- TM number 2, Shri Mataji
- Annh?

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.328
- TM number 2
- ATM

00:19:00.334 --> 00:19:03.511
- TM number 2. Inhonne bana li Geneva mein
- Kahan?

00:19:03.511 --> 00:19:05.774
- Switzerland mein to hai hi
- Switzerland mein hai?

00:19:05.774 --> 00:19:08.044
- Unki University hai pehle se
- Kahe ki?

00:19:08.044 --> 00:19:09.604
- [UNCLEAR] ki
- Achcha!

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:15.219
University of Creative Intelligence - kya
bol karke. Usmein ek degree dete hain

00:19:15.272 --> 00:19:18.292
- aur koi doosri yeh ...
- Woh koi maanta nahin lekin

00:19:18.292 --> 00:19:21.847
Nahin koi nahin maanta - kuch bhi
nahin. NOIDA mein bhi bana rahe

00:19:22.331 --> 00:19:28.651
- What's that?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:19:32.108 --> 00:19:37.928
So nice to draw this [UNCLEAR];
Bahut sunder hai

00:19:39.405 --> 00:19:43.655
[UNCLEAR] Similar ones
we've done last year

00:19:43.655 --> 00:19:52.329
- Aa, ah! Yeh ek chaudah saal ke ladke ke the
- Baap re!

00:19:57.122 --> 00:19:58.812
Very good! Bahut achcha hai.

00:19:58.812 --> 00:20:02.086
- You've done it?
- I did the translation for the

00:20:02.086 --> 00:20:05.560
- Haan
- poster. We had Mother a perfect
desire to do that.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.021
- Same thing in tran ..
- Same, the same

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.790
So we just send, 'You cannot know
the meaning of your life

00:20:13.605 --> 00:20:16.145
till you are connected to
the part of the energy'

00:20:16.248 --> 00:20:19.908
- What is that?
- 'You cannot know the meaning of your life

00:20:19.908 --> 00:20:24.828
until you are connected to the power of 
the energy.' It's Your words Shri Mataji.

00:20:29.365 --> 00:20:34.469
- No one is created.
- Created [UNCLEAR] created

00:20:36.099 --> 00:20:39.509
- Until you are connected with the Whole, you can't
- Connected [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:20:39.521 --> 00:20:44.161
- Nahin, created, created you
- Created you, is it?

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:49.890
- Origin of life is said - is it? 
- Created is not translated. They were
created is not translated

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:52.426
- No, that's what
- Put the Origin of Life

00:20:52.426 --> 00:20:54.666
- Hmm, Origin
- Yes, Mother

00:20:55.353 --> 00:20:59.523
Sometimes you have to use this
scripted line, isn't it?

00:21:14.663 --> 00:21:19.753
That's the birthday [UNCLEAR] preparation.
We've put also Chinese on the other side.

00:21:20.425 --> 00:21:25.465
- Haan... this is what is invitation
- Invitation, yeah.

00:21:25.676 --> 00:21:30.706
- and this one is?
- This is celebration - the
beginning of the program in the evening

00:21:31.582 --> 00:21:43.622
Very, very nice! Chinese have a real sense
of art! This means the center?

00:21:43.622 --> 00:21:55.024
- Yes, the central channel.
- Central channel. Same in Japanese?

00:21:55.238 --> 00:22:00.868
Yes, yes. In this they borrow our
characters [LAUGHTER]

00:22:00.868 --> 00:22:05.286
- I hope, they cannot beat you. [LAUGHTER]
- They copy [UNCLEAR]

00:22:05.286 --> 00:22:11.762
- Just see this, Shri Mataji, bulletin.
- So we kept the side frame [UNCLEAR]

00:22:11.762 --> 00:22:17.436
That's very good. Bahut achcha photo hai,
dekhiye; Ek 14 saal ke ladke ne liya tha

00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:23.831
6 photographs hain bahut advanced
camare se, photo

00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:25.605
- Hai kya [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?

00:22:25.605 --> 00:22:26.605
- Bilkul hain
- Hanumanji hain?

00:22:26.625 --> 00:22:30.202
Bilkul hain. Thode se colors
mein banaya hai

00:22:30.497 --> 00:22:34.697
- Yeh banaya hai?
- Nahin, matlab photo hai, ye photograph

00:22:34.697 --> 00:22:41.972
- Bilkul
- [UNCLEAR CONVERSATION]

00:22:45.389 --> 00:22:50.459
Hong Kong is being transformed through the 
persons, Shri Mataji - all other Hong Kong

00:22:51.152 --> 00:22:57.072
- This is from Angelina?
- I think, this one was taken Mathew,
Mathew [UNCLEAR]

00:22:57.388 --> 00:22:59.758
- Kaun hai?
- [UNCLEAR] ka beta hai,

00:22:59.779 --> 00:23:01.581
- Annh?
- Kohli sahab ka beta hai

00:23:01.581 --> 00:23:03.592
- Woh to pata hai Mujhe.
- Usi ne kiya hai.

00:23:04.704 --> 00:23:09.424
- This whole thing is done by you here?
- Yes, [UNCLEAR] in Hong Kong

00:23:09.424 --> 00:23:12.910
- [UNCLEAR] 
- I know [UNCLEAR] So to pata hai Mujhe ladka.

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:17.184
- [UNCLEAR] 
- Mathew ne photo bheja hai - 
inhone banaya hai

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.501
Bahut achcha design kiya hai, Shri Mataji.
Design bahut khoobsurat kiya hai.

00:23:21.501 --> 00:23:23.336
- Yeh log
- Yahan pe ek yeh karke aur

00:23:23.336 --> 00:23:25.906
- Bahut achcha
- Bahut achcha design kiya hai.
Lag hi nahin raha hai

00:23:25.906 --> 00:23:31.626
- Haath idhar nikal raha hai, udhar
- Yeh, yes, yes - beautiful! Graphic sense

00:23:31.766 --> 00:23:36.556
- The starting process [UNCLEAR]
- Very nice! Very attractive!

00:23:36.556 --> 00:23:42.382
They stand out so as soon as you put the first
lot, people come and look - Very attractive!

00:23:43.439 --> 00:23:47.599
- Very nice!
- So, so many people [UNCLEAR] saw the person

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.400
- Can we have take one of both?
- Yes

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.793
- There're some Chinese people [UNCLEAR]
- Very creative and just see

00:23:55.793 --> 00:24:00.050
this lotus also done so well! 
Everything very nice.

00:24:07.336 --> 00:24:13.556
- Every time something new.
- [UNCLEAR] also transform

00:24:13.556 --> 00:24:17.348
Sahaja to [UNCLEAR] that will know us.

00:24:17.348 --> 00:24:24.704
Tremendous! I was telling him, "He's a
very big find, Albert," because first time

00:24:24.718 --> 00:24:27.865
- when I came, nobody to speak Mandarin even
- Hmm

00:24:27.865 --> 00:24:30.065
- such a problem!
- Big problem

00:24:31.317 --> 00:24:37.989
Nobody to translate it - Mandarin. Then 
they said,"We no." They said, Cantonese

00:24:37.989 --> 00:24:41.683
they had some body but not
Mandarin. They said, "No."

00:24:41.683 --> 00:24:44.303
- You must know Cantonese, I think, here.
- Yes

00:24:44.303 --> 00:24:46.344
- You speak Cantonese?
- Yes, we speak Cantonese.

00:24:46.344 --> 00:24:50.463
So, the Mandarin - there was some body
with Mandarin but no Cantonese.

00:24:50.476 --> 00:24:52.466
- Sahaj
- a big problem.
- Yeah

00:24:56.245 --> 00:25:03.535
Cantonese eat lot of chillies. [LAUGHTER]
I went to Canton

00:25:04.408 --> 00:25:09.018
and there are mountains of 
chillies, mountains of chillis

00:25:10.334 --> 00:25:13.984
and that food can be - food is very hot;
Indians would love it.

00:25:14.624 --> 00:25:17.194
- Bahut hot hota hai.
- Wahan Sahaja yogis, Shri Mataji

00:25:17.233 --> 00:25:20.113
- Annh?
- Wahan Sahaja yogis have given up all this.

00:25:20.113 --> 00:25:21.850
- Given up now.
- Red chillies.

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.021
- Ab mircha nahin khate?
- Bilkul nahin. Padti nahin.

00:25:24.044 --> 00:25:27.504
Padti nahin, padti nahin, Shri Mataji;
Ghar mein nahin hai.

00:25:27.796 --> 00:25:31.356
- Ekdam choot gaya kya mircha?
- Bilkul choot gayi, Mataji.

00:25:31.356 --> 00:25:33.343
To phir khana mein mircha nahin aata hoga?

00:25:33.343 --> 00:25:35.688
- Aata hai.
- Aata hai

00:25:35.915 --> 00:25:42.465
Hum to khate hi nahin hai mircha bilkul
bhi shuru se hi; Bahut kam par ab to

00:25:42.465 --> 00:25:46.198
bilkul hi nahin khate, bilkul nahin.

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.820
Waise unhonne mujhe, Dilli mein, Cheen
ka base diya hai kaam karne ke liye.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.890
- Annh?
- Cheen ka kaam karne ko kaha hai.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:26:00.890
Cheen? Cheen pe kuch ho hi raha hai.
China is, you see, what happened that,

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:07.095
I went with CP to China and he's
Le Ping, the one who is the,

00:26:08.646 --> 00:26:16.096
he is the Prime Minister. He got very much
interested in Me, asking Me questions on,

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:21.010
about spirituality and but I kept quiet 
because with CP I just don't say everything

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:26.371
"Yes, yes," I said this, that and they 
took a photograph of the group, you see

00:26:26.371 --> 00:26:31.790
and he's also standing next to Me. Now this
photograph was at last with Sahaja yogis

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:37.740
and I didn't know they all had it. So once,
this Le Ping, I think, last year he went to

00:26:38.357 --> 00:26:46.697
Vienna. So, the people from Vienna took 
that photograph and showed him,

00:26:47.161 --> 00:26:50.941
and "Ah, of course I remember Her very
well, where is She this and...?"

00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:54.631
Then he asked, "How are you concerned,
how do you have this photograph?"

00:26:54.631 --> 00:26:58.928
So they said, "She's our spiritual
leader." So he was quite surprised,

00:26:58.928 --> 00:27:01.693
he was very much surprised.
He said, "Really?"

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:07.614
Then he said, "Of course, I asked Her but
She never said anything to me but I will

00:27:07.614 --> 00:27:13.325
send My cultural Natashe [UNCLEAR] to see
Her," because now he's going back.

00:27:13.325 --> 00:27:17.628
So the cultural Natashe came, 
very anxious, very respectful.

00:27:17.628 --> 00:27:21.299
These Chinese are very respectful people. Then he said that,

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:28.809
"It's such a honor, Mother, to see You and
this and that," so I gave him realization.

00:27:29.397 --> 00:27:37.107
He said, "Is this the," - khazaane ko kya
kehte hain angrezi mein?

00:27:37.107 --> 00:27:44.478
- Treasure
- Treasure - "Is this the treasure of

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:51.930
Indian spirituality that we used to know
in China, that India has treasure

00:27:52.366 --> 00:27:56.906
of Spirituality - is this the same?"
I said, "Yes, this is the same."

00:27:57.048 --> 00:28:03.988
He was so impressed. Then he went to 
China, he talked to Li Ping and all that

00:28:04.378 --> 00:28:09.684
but this old man is still there, you see. So,
he said, "Till he's there,

00:28:09.684 --> 00:28:16.727
it's rather difficult but once he's finished, 
then we can do something also in China."

00:28:16.727 --> 00:28:22.095
- About to go, about to go
- About to go - woh mar hi nahin rahe hain

00:28:22.095 --> 00:28:24.691
- Woh bas
- Mar gaya smajho

00:28:24.766 --> 00:28:28.656
Yesterday also he took out
some sort of a communicate.

00:28:32.424 --> 00:28:35.954
- Ho hi jayega khatam
- Zaroor ho jayega ussi time to baat kareinge

00:28:35.954 --> 00:28:42.444
Woh to bahut hi badhiya aadmi hai and I 
also told him, this gentleman, that,

00:28:42.458 --> 00:28:52.068
"Our C-in-C, Mr. Joshian, he's coming to
China, so I hope Le Ping will give him

00:28:52.068 --> 00:28:57.111
all the due respect and all the due 
consideration because we don't want to have

00:28:57.111 --> 00:29:05.201
any more wars with China." So, he was
telling Me, our C-in-C

00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:09.011
was saying that, "I had a red
carpet [UNCLEAR]."

00:29:09.011 --> 00:29:15.614
They looked after him so well and everything 
was done so well. So, I felt that they are

00:29:15.643 --> 00:29:21.473
[UNCLEAR] active about it. I'll have to go
and see him - let us see.

00:29:23.042 --> 00:29:28.212
Yeh mar hi nahin rahe hain - saal bhar ho 
gaya mar rahe hain. For one year he's dying

00:29:28.212 --> 00:29:34.074
- this Den Dias doesn't die.
- [UNCLEAR] nothing but the stuffed door

00:29:34.074 --> 00:29:39.405
- That really I don't know, if he's really dead or not.
- Nobody knows, nobody knows.

00:29:39.405 --> 00:29:42.019
- No one can say
- Because they keep showing

00:29:42.037 --> 00:29:45.497
the footage of him in our old channel
very much. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:29:45.497 --> 00:29:49.354
- [UNCLEAR] but he's keeping sick for years
- For years

00:29:49.354 --> 00:29:55.342
But this is something surprising. One he 
did such a condition, till you step your

00:29:55.342 --> 00:30:00.943
at least one foot in the grave, they don't
want to resign, I mean, just...

00:30:01.075 --> 00:30:03.005
- One and a half, Mother
- Annh?

00:30:03.005 --> 00:30:07.593
- One and a half
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:30:08.566 --> 00:30:17.646
It's such a attachment! This time we had a
very nice Shiv Puja, very nice for you -

00:30:17.646 --> 00:30:22.856
one of the best, I should say. I spoke for
one hour only on one subject, detachment.

00:30:23.969 --> 00:30:28.099
I said, now next time I'll talk about
other things - now detachment only.

00:30:28.124 --> 00:30:33.414
It was very nice Puja, very nice! As a 
result the whole of Japan was frozen.

00:30:33.854 --> 00:30:37.074
- Wow!
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:30:40.044 --> 00:30:42.734
- To abhi to raheinge aap?
- Ji Mataji

00:30:42.734 --> 00:30:44.324
- Program ke lie aaye hain aap?
- Ji Mataji

00:30:44.324 --> 00:30:46.299
- Abhi chal na sab jagah.
- Annh?

00:30:46.299 --> 00:30:48.819
- Taiwan wagairah aayega saath mein.
- Chaleinge?

00:30:48.819 --> 00:30:50.532
- Ji haan
- Chaliye

00:30:50.539 --> 00:30:53.229
- Ek hi hafte ki to baat hai.
- Ab aaye hain to ghoom lijiye aap

00:30:53.229 --> 00:30:58.725
- Aur kya.
- Yahan to abhi 6 tak to hain hi

00:30:58.742 --> 00:31:01.302
- Annh?
- Yahan 6 tak to hai hiin. Program
ke liye aaye hain

00:31:01.302 --> 00:31:05.394
- aur 5 Sunday tak hain
- Aap ko dekh kar bade mann khush hota hai

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.050
Ek to Mujhe iska laga hota hai na, ye jo
kar rahe hain Madras mein

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:14.731
- batayiye, sahaja yog ke naam se
- Nahin isko, isko to dekh

00:31:14.731 --> 00:31:17.706
Aapki dosti hai to badi achchi baat hai.
Phone number hai aapke paas?

00:31:17.706 --> 00:31:22.178
Hai Shri Mataji - yahan nahin hai, Mahila
mein hai. Isko wahan ja kar poochna padega

00:31:22.195 --> 00:31:25.315
- Wahan se karte hain [UNCLEAR]
- Bade dusht log hain

00:31:25.653 --> 00:31:29.103
- Ya to phir jinko pehle kaha tha Dilli mein
- Haan

00:31:29.103 --> 00:31:32.538
- unko phir se phone karte hain aur...
- Aur unko bhi keh do.

00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:36.604
- Unko bhi kehte hain. Dono ko kehte hain
- Phir Hum Jayakar se na kahein - don't need

00:31:36.604 --> 00:31:41.823
Zaroorat nahin hai - Jinse pehle kaha tha
Dilli mein, wojo Enforcement mein hain

00:31:41.823 --> 00:31:44.372
- Sab chupke chupke kaam kiya
- Woh Enforcement mein jo hain

00:31:44.372 --> 00:31:47.269
unko main bata doonga ki [UNCLEAR]
purana jaante hain

00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:50.962
Finance mein hain to lucky mein hain,
I mean, it is about Finance only.

00:31:50.962 --> 00:31:53.653
Ji haan, yeh ho jayega. Yeh IAS mein
hain - ho jayega.

00:31:54.241 --> 00:31:58.131
Unke peeche lagna chahiye. Police lagani
chahiye, pata karna chahiye kahan jaate

00:31:58.131 --> 00:32:01.715
hain, kisse milte hain. Par yahan to ho
gaye - pakad mein aa gaye, bhaag gaye

00:32:01.715 --> 00:32:04.579
Yahan se bhaag gaye - wahan se bhi ho
jayega, bilkul ho jayega.

00:32:04.637 --> 00:32:08.627
Unko jaana tha 18 ko, woh
13 hi ko bhaag gaye.

00:32:15.619 --> 00:32:18.530
- Ab, Shri Mataji, izaazat dein
- Achcha theek hai

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:20.211
- 12 bajne waale hain
- Achcha

00:32:20.211 --> 00:32:24.513
- Jai Shri Mataji
- Good night, good night.

00:32:28.236 --> 00:32:40.176
[ALL DO PRANAMS TO SHRI MATAJI]

00:32:43.154 --> 00:32:47.684
May God bless you! All of you. Theek hai

00:32:49.022 --> 00:32:59.712
Wow, very good, excellent. Alright, let's 
see. I hope the hall will be sufficient

00:33:00.656 --> 00:33:03.926
- I would like
- They have a capacity of three thousand.

00:33:03.926 --> 00:33:09.027
Wow! [ALL LAUGH]

00:33:09.488 --> 00:33:14.548
Just to give a desire there, we have to 
have, desire for [UNCLEAR]

00:33:14.564 --> 00:33:21.154
I think, you know, it's more advertising 
that works, really. It's only advertising

00:33:21.576 --> 00:33:27.496
In, what they did, in Sydney, was nothing
but advertising - that clicked.

00:33:29.186 --> 00:33:33.996
We've done a lot of magazine advertising,
in the newspapers...

00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:36.441
- That's it!
- we've done a lot.

00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:41.352
It's a very big force, these days
- advertise

00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:48.011
We had a merely, a 4000 people in Mao,
invitations to

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.920
- Really!
- We're hoping so. I think, it's something [UNCLEAR]

00:33:53.755 --> 00:33:58.135
- Abhi kahan thehre aap log?
- Shri Mataji, Aapke sadak ke paar
ek hotel hai

00:33:58.183 --> 00:33:59.983
- Imperial hotel
- Achcha

00:33:59.983 --> 00:34:03.953
- usmein thehre hain kaafi log
- Ismein Hum hamesha to nahin [UNCLEAR]

00:34:03.953 --> 00:34:07.872
- Bahut khoobsurat hai
- First time when I came, it got the first prize

00:34:09.416 --> 00:34:13.566
- Bahut achcha hai
- Bahut, bahut khoobsurat, bahut hi khoobsurat hai

00:34:13.566 --> 00:34:18.302
Hum bas saamne hi to hain, Shri Mataji.
Agar Aap [UNCLEAR] mein bhi chahein

00:34:18.302 --> 00:34:20.104
Din mein Hum kahin nahin ja rahe

00:34:20.104 --> 00:34:22.643
- Din mein aaoonga
- aayiyega
