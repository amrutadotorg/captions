00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.080
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.640

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.600
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.880
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.040
It is such a fortunate day today,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.040
that we should come on the birth of Shri Ganesha

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.920
– today is Vinayak Chaturthi, today -

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.240
that we should celebrate this Puja.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.880
Also, it is so fortunate to have people like

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.000
Dr Sanghvi, his wife and his son, his daughter-in-law,

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.520
who are so much dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.440
In 1972 I had visited Pune, Nasik,

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.280
and we had a big session here.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.200
People from all over came; we got a lot of Sahaja yogis here.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.880
Raulbai is one of them.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.800
But the people of Nasik did not come forward much to do Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.280
and sort of, we didn’t find any

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.640
footing place here, so we gave up coming to Nasik.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.760
And today after so many days, now I’m back here.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:10:00.480
And it’s so surprising how we have been able to manage.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.120
So many people yesterday, about,

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.160
they are saying about ten thousand people were present.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.880
And at least, I would say that ninety percent people

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.120
got Realization, at least.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.400
Now, I have to say that the quality of people is very important,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.440
and in Maharashtra you must understand that there’s a quality.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.280
These people have a special quality of purity, I think,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.000
that invariably

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.480
I’ve seen the amount of working it takes place in Maharashtra,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.840
doesn’t take place in other place.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.800
Perhaps the people are very much aware

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.800
of the three and a half peethas they have here.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.520
Now for, they are Jains and have been following Jainism but

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.120
still they always worshipped the Goddess, the Devi.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.560
So, we can understand that what is an impact

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.600
of those three and a half peethas is.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.800
And you have visited

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.240
the great shrine of Chaturshringi.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.720
Saptashringi.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.440
I’m sorry, Saptashringi. [Hindi/Marathi]

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.400
Today being Ganesha’s day,

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.800
only it is going to come "chatura" in My mouth.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.080
So this Saptashringi is the one

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.840
who has got seven chakras, means the limbic area,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.000
and She is the Sahasrara, representing the Sahasrara.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.840
That’s why she’s the Ardha-Matra.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.160
And Her face and body and all that you can see,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.920
is so beautifully made,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.040
that it emits vibrations for miles together.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.560
Those who are sensitive can feel it.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.080
And you have been so lucky to go there and see that

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.160
miraculous place, that this have come out of Mother Earth.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.400
And since ancient times it has been there.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.120
Nobody knows when it appeared.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.560
So we are in a very holy place,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.600
because as you know Sita lived here for so many years

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:30.880
and Shri Rama was also with Her, and also Shri Lakshmana.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.800
So it is obvious that this is a big kind of,

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.440
we can say a,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.360
quite a big meeting place of various holy things,

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:50.440
that happened during the different periods of Maharashtra.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:57.920
And the River Godavari also flows and the, also the

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.320
[Hindi/Marathi] source, source of this river is also very near.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:06.360
Actually they wanted to take you down there,

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.520
but it’s another high climb and I thought you will be all exhausted

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.880
so I told her better not take that way.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.120
But normally those people who come to Nasik always go there.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.720
And there is one sad incident was that

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.200
there’s a Trimbakeshwar where is there is one of the Jyotirlingas.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.680
There are twelve Jyotirlingas.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.360
Actually we should say they are fourteen because

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.680
two of them are half, so .…

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.760
There are twelve Jyotirlingas,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.200
and the complete are ten.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.440
Out of them, one of them is here.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.920
But the gentleman was quite funny and he said that

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:51.840
"Those who are not Hindus, we cannot admit there".

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160
So it’s again

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.720
all nonsense going on which will all stop one day, I’m sure,

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.440
because they have no sense how to recognize the saints, you see.

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:06.360
And once they start recognizing the saints, they will know that

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.080
they are the first who should go inside,

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.400
than those who are not realized.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.560
Moreover, for Shiva doesn’t matter whether they are even bhoots,

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.680
doesn’t matter to Him. His temple need not be so guarded.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.840
Any other temple I can understand, but Shiva’s I can’t understand

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.920
why there is so much guarding is needed.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.560
But I think it’s a money-making proposition.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.880
Whatever it is, it brings to My notice

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.920
all these nonsensical things that are going on in this country.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.680
And then one starts realizing

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.640
that how much people have to open out themselves and give up fear

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.840
from people who are coming from other countries.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.240
They suffer all of them, not only,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.160
not only the people

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.920
who are religious but also people who are political, social.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.640
They are all frightened of foreigners coming in now,

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.400
in the country, and they always start doubting.

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.240
And you can understand that’s why they doubt, but still

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.840
they should also understand that in these advanced stages

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.920
if there are saints, they should be able to recognize,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.480
and this is what’s lacking in them.

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.280
And I was sad on that point, but doesn’t matter.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.240
I think next time I’ll put him right, this gentleman.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.280
So, on the whole, our whole stay was,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.680
I think was very interesting and nice, and this evening

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.120
we are going to have a very beautiful musical program,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.400
variety entertainment and classical music by children,

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.840
which you, I’m sure you’ll all enjoy very much.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.800
That we’ll have here.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.920
So on the whole we should be thankful to Mr. Sanghvi

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.640
and to Mr. Mehtani for organizing

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.280
this stay in Nasik so well

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.200
and with such comfort to all of us,

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:11.320
and such elevating experiences which has brought you

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.920
to something higher, and the experience of your own depth.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.360
So may God bless you all.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.120
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.400
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.920
They have to first ask for forgiveness of all of you,

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.360
and they are asking My forgiveness also.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.920

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.400
They say, "If we have done any mistakes,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.560
please forgive us,our whole family.”

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.880
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.280
First you have to worship yourself. Otherwise …

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.760
that’s why she has to worship herself,

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.440
that she should make herself, cleanse herself,

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.560
and she should worship herself, she should have respect for herself,

00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.520
and she is worshipping Me.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.360
If you are not a respectable person

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:21.920
you are not supposed to worship Me.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.920
[Hindi/Marathi]

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.760

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.280

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.840
There are ten, ten guards

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:39.600

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.200

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.160
who are the guards of the ten directions,

to come and settle down and guard this great occasion,

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.680

This is our offer to the Devi

so that the disease of hunger should be eradicated.

00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:18.920
This is the worship of the deepa

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.880
suggesting that “Oh Mother, we need not,

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:29.600
we should not forget the Spirit, the light of Spirit within us,

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:36.360

should be on that light which is the Spirit within us.

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.640
And then they are praying, saying that

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:48.480
“Remove the great darkness of moha.”

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.840

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.120

[Hindi/Marathi]

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:11.600
Now by doing karmas, our brains have muddled up.

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.160
So Goddess, we offer You this dhupa

00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:20.800
so that You remove the enemy of karma in our head,

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.840
remove all of the karmas from our head

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:25.920
so that we are clarified, we give dhupa.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.080
Now, see, it’s so interesting that

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.720
what they are suggesting is dhupam,

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:37.920
is the, dhupam is given to Shri Krishna,

00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.360
who is the one who gives us the witness state.

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.000
So how it is connected. Deepam is the Spirit,

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.760

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:06.000
Now, it is so significant that a coconut is offered for moksha.

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:09.280
Now, you know, coconut has a limbic area inside it.

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:11.640
It has the three shells,

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:15.080
just like your brain has, and inside is the limbic area.

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:18.440
It represents the limbic area, and that’s why

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:23.120
for moksha you have to go into the limbic area and that’s why

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:28.560
a, is called as “shripala”, Holy Ghost, you see,

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.080

the fruit that is liked, or representing Her.

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.040
This is your limbic area, and that’s why it is given to the Mother.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:42.160
How significant, and how absolutely appropriate it is.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:46.640

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.080
Apple is for you, the Ganesha.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.920
See, it has an effect on the Mooladhara.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.160
If you are suffering from diarrhea this helps you.

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:13.360
SY: [Hindi/Marathi]
SM: So this is for you people, the Ganesha,

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.120
and for these country people this is the Ganesha.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.400
So God has given everything according to the need.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:28.240

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.480
Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.240
Seven times.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.400
You have to say seven times the first mantra of

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.200
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, seven times with her.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:32.560
Gavin, why have you dropped “Shri Mataji”?

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.920
You should put “Shri Mataji” essentially

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.360
because that’s the first name of the Sahasranama, all right?

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.640
Should be there, “Shri Mataji”.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:49.240
When you are standardizing the thing - who has done this?

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.400
– you must ask Me;

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.880
Because that’s the biggest part, is that I am the Mother, isn’t it?

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.680
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:03.720
And that is actually the name given by the modern people,

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.160
so it must be accepted. Is an additional thing.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.400
When you are standardizing the things, you must ask Me, all of you.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:21.040
I don’t know who has done it, but whosoever it is.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.560
Realized soul [Hindi/Marathi].

[Hindi/Marathi] Collective.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.200
Collectivity. [Hindi/Marathi]

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:30.080
Collectivity. Sangha bhi means collectivity. Sa means collectivity.

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:38.080
And we can do hundred and eight names of Devi.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:43.600

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.720
This one is all written in Marathi but so well done.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.440
I wish you could all remember by heart,

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.360
so that it’s a very nice way of getting rid

01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:01.840
of our six types of enemies.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.680
You also don’t know what to ask God.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.800
You are always asking for something which is not important.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.200
Our priorities are all wrong.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.880
So this is a very good way of knowing exactly

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.160
what a Sahaja yogi should ask.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:43.920
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.120
Mr. Sanghvi said that he would not accept any money

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:09.760
from the people for Puja. I said, “But they must all join in”.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.840
So with great difficulty they agreed that we should collect

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.680
eleven rupees from all of you for the Puja,

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.120
and somebody should do it.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.440
Twenty one.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.680
You have done? You have done twenty-one? All right. Whatever it is.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.920
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:51.280

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.120
Now all the people from Nasik are going to do this,

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:39.400
so little bit you have to move out.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.920
Those who are from Nasik.

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.920
And Nala if you can move out, these people will sit that side.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.800
[Hindi/Marathi] You must spread something for them.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.400
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.280

Alexander, you also move out a little,

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.000
because others have to sit there. All right?

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:03.880
