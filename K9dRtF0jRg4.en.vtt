07:12.920 --> 07:16.160
[Hindi/Marathi]

07:27.720 --> 07:30.720
[Hindi/Marathi]

07:38.280 --> 07:40.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

07:40.760 --> 07:43.480
[Hindi/Marathi]

07:43.840 --> 07:45.920
[Hindi/Marathi]

07:46.200 --> 07:49.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

07:49.240 --> 07:55.080
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:05.200 --> 08:07.640
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:07.840 --> 08:11.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:14.880 --> 08:18.600
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:34.920 --> 08:37.880
[Hindi/Marathi]

08:39.640 --> 08:43.040
It is such a fortunate day today,

08:43.240 --> 08:48.040
that we should come on the birth of Shri Ganesha

08:48.240 --> 08:50.920
– today is Vinayak Chaturthi, today -

08:51.200 --> 08:56.240
that we should celebrate this Puja.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.880
Also, it is so fortunate to have people like

09:02.120 --> 09:08.000
Dr Sanghvi, his wife and his son, his daughter-in-law,

09:08.920 --> 09:13.520
who are so much dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

09:16.080 --> 09:20.440
In 1972 I had visited Pune, Nasik,

09:20.640 --> 09:24.280
and we had a big session here.

09:24.560 --> 09:29.200
People from all over came; we got a lot of Sahaja yogis here.

09:29.520 --> 09:31.880
Raulbai is one of them.

09:32.120 --> 09:37.800
But the people of Nasik did not come forward much to do Sahaja Yoga,

09:38.120 --> 09:42.280
and sort of, we didn’t find any

09:43.600 --> 09:48.640
footing place here, so we gave up coming to Nasik.

09:48.880 --> 09:53.760
And today after so many days, now I’m back here.

09:54.640 --> 10:00.480
And it’s so surprising how we have been able to manage.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.120
So many people yesterday, about,

10:04.320 --> 10:08.160
they are saying about ten thousand people were present.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.880
And at least, I would say that ninety percent people

10:11.120 --> 10:15.120
got Realization, at least.

10:16.560 --> 10:22.400
Now, I have to say that the quality of people is very important,

10:23.000 --> 10:28.440
and in Maharashtra you must understand that there’s a quality.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.280
These people have a special quality of purity, I think,

10:33.520 --> 10:36.000
that invariably

10:36.240 --> 10:39.480
I’ve seen the amount of working it takes place in Maharashtra,

10:39.680 --> 10:42.840
doesn’t take place in other place.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.800
Perhaps the people are very much aware

10:47.040 --> 10:50.800
of the three and a half peethas they have here.

10:51.080 --> 10:56.520
Now for, they are Jains and have been following Jainism but

10:56.720 --> 11:00.120
still they always worshipped the Goddess, the Devi.

11:00.360 --> 11:05.560
So, we can understand that what is an impact

11:05.760 --> 11:09.600
of those three and a half peethas is.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.800
And you have visited

11:12.080 --> 11:17.240
the great shrine of Chaturshringi.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.720
Saptashringi.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.440
I’m sorry, Saptashringi. [Hindi/Marathi]

11:23.680 --> 11:25.400
Today being Ganesha’s day,

11:25.600 --> 11:28.800
only it is going to come "chatura" in My mouth.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.080
So this Saptashringi is the one

11:31.280 --> 11:34.840
who has got seven chakras, means the limbic area,

11:35.080 --> 11:38.000
and She is the Sahasrara, representing the Sahasrara.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.840
That’s why she’s the Ardha-Matra.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.160
And Her face and body and all that you can see,

11:46.400 --> 11:48.920
is so beautifully made,

11:49.160 --> 11:54.040
that it emits vibrations for miles together.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.560
Those who are sensitive can feel it.

11:59.040 --> 12:04.080
And you have been so lucky to go there and see that

12:04.360 --> 12:08.160
miraculous place, that this have come out of Mother Earth.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.400
And since ancient times it has been there.

12:10.600 --> 12:14.120
Nobody knows when it appeared.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.560
So we are in a very holy place,

12:19.720 --> 12:25.600
because as you know Sita lived here for so many years

12:25.840 --> 12:30.880
and Shri Rama was also with Her, and also Shri Lakshmana.

12:31.160 --> 12:36.800
So it is obvious that this is a big kind of,

12:37.040 --> 12:39.440
we can say a,

12:39.680 --> 12:44.360
quite a big meeting place of various holy things,

12:44.560 --> 12:50.440
that happened during the different periods of Maharashtra.

12:52.120 --> 12:57.920
And the River Godavari also flows and the, also the

13:00.040 --> 13:04.320
[Hindi/Marathi] source, source of this river is also very near.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.360
Actually they wanted to take you down there,

13:06.560 --> 13:09.520
but it’s another high climb and I thought you will be all exhausted

13:09.720 --> 13:11.880
so I told her better not take that way.

13:12.120 --> 13:16.120
But normally those people who come to Nasik always go there.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.720
And there is one sad incident was that

13:19.920 --> 13:23.200
there’s a Trimbakeshwar where is there is one of the Jyotirlingas.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.680
There are twelve Jyotirlingas.

13:25.880 --> 13:29.360
Actually we should say they are fourteen because

13:29.560 --> 13:31.680
two of them are half, so .…

13:31.880 --> 13:35.760
There are twelve Jyotirlingas,

13:38.240 --> 13:42.200
and the complete are ten.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.440
Out of them, one of them is here.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.920
But the gentleman was quite funny and he said that

13:48.160 --> 13:51.840
"Those who are not Hindus, we cannot admit there".

13:52.160 --> 13:53.160
So it’s again

13:53.360 --> 13:56.720
all nonsense going on which will all stop one day, I’m sure,

13:56.920 --> 14:01.440
because they have no sense how to recognize the saints, you see.

14:01.680 --> 14:06.360
And once they start recognizing the saints, they will know that

14:06.560 --> 14:09.080
they are the first who should go inside,

14:09.280 --> 14:11.400
than those who are not realized.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.560
Moreover, for Shiva doesn’t matter whether they are even bhoots,

14:15.760 --> 14:19.680
doesn’t matter to Him. His temple need not be so guarded.

14:19.880 --> 14:22.840
Any other temple I can understand, but Shiva’s I can’t understand

14:23.080 --> 14:24.920
why there is so much guarding is needed.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.560
But I think it’s a money-making proposition.

14:28.800 --> 14:32.880
Whatever it is, it brings to My notice

14:33.120 --> 14:36.920
all these nonsensical things that are going on in this country.

14:37.240 --> 14:40.680
And then one starts realizing

14:40.920 --> 14:44.640
that how much people have to open out themselves and give up fear

14:44.840 --> 14:47.840
from people who are coming from other countries.

14:48.120 --> 14:52.240
They suffer all of them, not only,

14:52.440 --> 14:55.160
not only the people

14:55.360 --> 14:58.920
who are religious but also people who are political, social.

14:59.160 --> 15:03.640
They are all frightened of foreigners coming in now,

15:03.880 --> 15:07.400
in the country, and they always start doubting.

15:07.640 --> 15:11.240
And you can understand that’s why they doubt, but still

15:11.440 --> 15:15.840
they should also understand that in these advanced stages

15:16.080 --> 15:18.920
if there are saints, they should be able to recognize,

15:19.160 --> 15:21.480
and this is what’s lacking in them.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.280
And I was sad on that point, but doesn’t matter.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.240
I think next time I’ll put him right, this gentleman.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.280
So, on the whole, our whole stay was,

15:32.480 --> 15:35.680
I think was very interesting and nice, and this evening

15:35.880 --> 15:41.120
we are going to have a very beautiful musical program,

15:41.400 --> 15:46.400
variety entertainment and classical music by children,

15:46.600 --> 15:49.840
which you, I’m sure you’ll all enjoy very much.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.800
That we’ll have here.

15:52.040 --> 15:55.920
So on the whole we should be thankful to Mr. Sanghvi

15:56.200 --> 15:59.640
and to Mr. Mehtani for organizing

15:59.840 --> 16:03.280
this stay in Nasik so well

16:03.560 --> 16:06.200
and with such comfort to all of us,

16:06.400 --> 16:11.320
and such elevating experiences which has brought you

16:11.520 --> 16:16.920
to something higher, and the experience of your own depth.

16:17.440 --> 16:21.360
So may God bless you all.

16:39.040 --> 16:43.120
[Hindi/Marathi]

16:43.320 --> 16:46.400
[Hindi/Marathi]

16:46.640 --> 16:49.920
They have to first ask for forgiveness of all of you,

16:50.120 --> 16:52.360
and they are asking My forgiveness also.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

16:55.400 --> 16:58.920
[Hindi/Marathi]

16:59.240 --> 17:04.760

17:09.800 --> 17:12.240

17:12.480 --> 17:14.400
They say, "If we have done any mistakes,

17:14.600 --> 17:17.560
please forgive us,our whole family.”

17:19.200 --> 17:21.560
[Hindi/Marathi]

17:21.800 --> 17:25.880
[Hindi/Marathi]

19:02.680 --> 19:05.280
First you have to worship yourself. Otherwise …

19:05.480 --> 19:07.760
that’s why she has to worship herself,

19:07.920 --> 19:11.440
that she should make herself, cleanse herself,

19:11.640 --> 19:14.560
and she should worship herself, she should have respect for herself,

19:14.760 --> 19:16.520
and she is worshipping Me.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.360
If you are not a respectable person

19:18.560 --> 19:21.920
you are not supposed to worship Me.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.920
[Hindi/Marathi]

20:23.040 --> 20:26.760
[Hindi/Marathi]

20:27.560 --> 20:31.200

He has to, now they'll be saying mantras. [Hindi/Marathi]

20:38.520 --> 20:40.640
[Hindi/Marathi]

20:40.920 --> 20:43.280

[Hindi/Marathi]

35:08.320 --> 35:11.000

35:11.240 --> 35:16.520
There should be peace, and for the peace there’s a shanti mantra.

35:16.720 --> 35:21.080
Is important. Shanti, the peace has to be within and without.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.760
First it has to be established within.

35:23.920 --> 35:25.920
You must feel your peace within yourself.

48:07.720 --> 48:13.000
Now the Puja of Saraswati and Mahalakshmi.

54:03.360 --> 54:06.040
This is our offer to the Devi

54:06.240 --> 54:11.400
so that the disease of hunger should be eradicated.

55:13.920 --> 55:18.920
This is the worship of the deepa

55:19.840 --> 55:23.880
suggesting that “Oh Mother, we need not,

55:24.120 --> 55:29.600
we should not forget the Spirit, the light of Spirit within us,

55:30.440 --> 55:36.360
and we worship You with this light, so that our attention

55:36.600 --> 55:40.520
should be on that light which is the Spirit within us.

55:40.760 --> 55:43.640
And then they are praying, saying that

55:43.880 --> 55:48.480
“Remove the great darkness of moha.”

55:48.760 --> 55:50.840
“Moha” is attachment.

55:51.080 --> 55:53.440
Attachment.Ahamkar.

55:53.760 --> 55:56.120
And remove the, and “moha” means the attachment.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.920
- SY: Attachments.
- SM: Ahamkar. Aham attachments.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.600

[Hindi/Marathi]

56:17.400 --> 56:20.120
[Hindi/Marathi]

57:04.480 --> 57:11.600
Now by doing karmas, our brains have muddled up.

57:12.320 --> 57:15.160
So Goddess, we offer You this dhupa

57:15.520 --> 57:20.800
so that You remove the enemy of karma in our head,

57:21.320 --> 57:23.840
remove all of the karmas from our head

57:24.040 --> 57:25.920
so that we are clarified, we give dhupa.

57:26.120 --> 57:29.080
Now, see, it’s so interesting that

57:29.480 --> 57:32.720
what they are suggesting is dhupam,

57:32.920 --> 57:37.920
is the, dhupam is given to Shri Krishna,

57:38.240 --> 57:42.360
who is the one who gives us the witness state.

57:42.640 --> 57:47.000
So how it is connected. Deepam is the Spirit,

57:47.400 --> 57:50.760
so you see how it is connected. The whole thing is so connected.

57:50.920 --> 57:52.120

57:52.320 --> 57:55.440
[Hindi/Marathi]

57:55.640 --> 57:58.600
[Hindi/Marathi]

59:00.480 --> 59:06.000
Now, it is so significant that a coconut is offered for moksha.

59:06.240 --> 59:09.280
Now, you know, coconut has a limbic area inside it.

59:09.480 --> 59:11.640
It has the three shells,

59:11.840 --> 59:15.080
just like your brain has, and inside is the limbic area.

59:15.280 --> 59:18.440
It represents the limbic area, and that’s why

59:18.640 --> 59:23.120
for moksha you have to go into the limbic area and that’s why

59:23.400 --> 59:28.560
a, is called as “shripala”, Holy Ghost, you see,

59:28.800 --> 59:31.080
the pala of the Holy Ghost, you see,

59:31.280 --> 59:34.280
the fruit that is liked, or representing Her.

59:34.480 --> 59:38.040
This is your limbic area, and that’s why it is given to the Mother.

59:38.240 --> 59:42.160
How significant, and how absolutely appropriate it is.

59:42.360 --> 59:46.640
God has also created this, just to suggest that thing.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.760
which is the Ganesha Tattwa, and that is Agama Shastras,

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.400
means the shastras which have come out of that.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.920
So “make me a virtuous personality”.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.160
All has come from Shri Ganesha,

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:27.720
and Shri Ganesha makes you auspicious and also virtuous.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.200
"So the one from where all the shastras have come out,

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.600
so this is the Shri Ganesha Tattwa which we offer You,

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.640
so that You also make us virtuous

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.400
and auspicious, by Your powers".

See, it has an effect on the Mooladhara.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.160

Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.240
Seven times.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:47.400
You have to say seven times the first mantra of

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.200
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, seven times with her.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:32.560
Gavin, why have you dropped “Shri Mataji”?

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.920
You should put “Shri Mataji” essentially

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:41.360
because that’s the first name of the Sahasranama, all right?

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:44.640
Should be there, “Shri Mataji”.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:49.240
When you are standardizing the thing - who has done this?

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.400
– you must ask Me;

01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:57.880
Because that’s the biggest part, is that I am the Mother, isn’t it?

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.680
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:03.720
And that is actually the name given by the modern people,

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.160
so it must be accepted. Is an additional thing.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:16.400
When you are standardizing the things, you must ask Me, all of you.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:21.040
I don’t know who has done it, but whosoever it is.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:43.600
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.360
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:50.760
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.200
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.640

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.520
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.080

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.160
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.720
This one is all written in Marathi but so well done.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.440
I wish you could all remember by heart,

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:54.360
so that it’s a very nice way of getting rid

01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:01.840
of our six types of enemies.

01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.680
You also don’t know what to ask God.

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:19.800
You are always asking for something which is not important.

01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:23.200
Our priorities are all wrong.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.880
So this is a very good way of knowing exactly

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:31.160
what a Sahaja yogi should ask.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.040
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:43.920
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.120
Mr. Sanghvi said that he would not accept any money

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:09.760
from the people for Puja. I said, “But they must all join in”.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.840
So with great difficulty they agreed that we should collect

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:20.680
eleven rupees from all of you for the Puja,

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.120
and somebody should do it.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.440
Twenty one.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.680
You have done? You have done twenty-one? All right. Whatever it is.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.920

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:51.280

[Hindi/Marathi]

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.320
[Hindi/Marathi] Remove that, a little bit.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:30.480

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.120
Now all the people from Nasik are going to do this,

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:39.400
so little bit you have to move out.

01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.920

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:57.920
And Nala if you can move out, these people will sit that side.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.800
[Hindi/Marathi] You must spread something for them.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.400
[Hindi/Marathi]

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.280

Alexander, you also move out a little,

01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.000
because others have to sit there. All right?

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:03.880
