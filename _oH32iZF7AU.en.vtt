00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.200
I think you can go down. There are lots of seats still vacant.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.240
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.320
At the very outset

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.920
I have to tell you that truth is what it is.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.280
You cannot transform it, change it

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.440
and unfortunately at this human awareness you cannot know it.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.600
Now whatever I am going to tell you today,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.520
you need not believe blind folded. We have already

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.200
suffered a lot because of blind faith.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.560
But if it is proved

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.120
then as honest people you have to accept it.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.560
Because it is for the benevolence of your being,

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.920
for the benevolence of your society,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.680
your city, your country and the world at large.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.960
So one has to understand

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.240
that we have not known so far the Absolute Truth.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.000
If we had known the Absolute Truth

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.960
there would not have been any problem whatsoever.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.520
Because everybody would see the same truth.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.280
There cannot be so many [dead] dogmas,

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.760
so many discussions, arguments, fights and wars.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:00.120
If everybody sees the same point then who will fight?

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.000
For example I am sitting before you, you all see it clearly

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.240
and you know it.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.920
So you are not going to fight that I am here or not.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.320
For that we need a last breakthrough of our evolution.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.640
As human beings, still, we have freedom to think whatever we like

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.600
but we haven’t got capacity to know the Absolute Truth.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.760
If that is so and if there is a way out,

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.120
why not we try for it?

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.960
You have been already told about this,

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.360
this instrument that is within you.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.600
I've never seen such a big one - today is the only...

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.360
In Australia everything is big I tell you.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.520
Very nice.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.280
I mean it can cover a very big hall as we had yesterday.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.520
A day before we had three thousand three hundred people

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.960
and this would have been better there.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.600
All right, as it is

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.520
this is the subtle instrument that is within us.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.840
It's created through our evolutionary process.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.320
As we learn, say, science and other things

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.960
from western countries, from Australia, from all

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.840
Japanese countries and all that.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.920
We can see the civilization has grown so big

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.000
and we do not know our roots.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.880
That’s why, what is happening is, people are waiting for a shock.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.240
Already they are very much upset.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.400
What has gone wrong with us that we should know our roots?

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.800
Now if these roots are coming from East or from India

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.120
why should we abhor it,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.920
why should we condemn it?

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.960
Because it's very important

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.320
that we have to seek our roots

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.400
and this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.040
The human problems

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.440
actually cover all the global problems, most of it.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.920
And to solve them

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:47.320
we have to see to this inner subtle instrument within us.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.200
When these centers are in jeopardy,

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.960
then we get physical, mental, emotional, spiritual,

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.960
social, political, all problems -

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.960
because problems are caused by human beings

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.000
and human beings are in trouble because of these centers.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.760
So if by chance,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.080
you know how to correct your centers

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.000
and then to correct others' centers also,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.200
you solve the problem.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.960
Now this power that is being told as ‘Kundalini’,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
is called ‘Kundalini’ because

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.600
‘Kundal’ means coils - it is coiled three and a half times.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.360
It has some mathematical calculation.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.400
Now this ‘Kundalini’ when She is awakened

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.000
She passes through these centers

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.320
and She enlightens them.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.200
She nourishes them and She integrates.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.520
Ultimately She pierces through your fontanel bone area -

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.800
in Sanskrit we call it ‘Brahmarandra’ -pierces through

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:05.160
and becomes one with this all pervading power.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.280
So you achieve two results.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.080
So the truth about you is that

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.480
you are not this body, mind, your ego, your conditionings.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.400
Because you say this is my ego,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.760
this is my conditioning, this is my house,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.320
this is my wife, my husband.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.760
So this ’my’, who is the ‘my’ there?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.080
So you become the ‘I’, the ‘self’,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.920
that is the ‘Spirit’, which you are!

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:40.880
And the second truth is that there is an All Pervading Power

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:45.120
which does all the living work.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.520
Look at these beautiful flowers; it's a miracle, if you see?

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.000
They are different flowers from different seeds of certain heights,

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.280
certain shapes, certain colour

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.840
and you take it for granted.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.400
You don’t even think about them how they have come out like that.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.960
Who runs our heart?

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.440
The doctors will say: autonomous nervous system.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.640
But who is the ‘auto’?

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.200
So we never question anything about living process,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.000
because we can’t answer.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.080
This living process

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.400
is done by a very subtle energy,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.960
which we can call by any name,

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.520
is the ‘divine power of love’.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:43.600
You can call it as ‘Ruh’ as in Koran,

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:49.840
you can call it as ‘Brahmachaitanya’ as in Sanskrit

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:56.520
and as ‘Ritambhara Pragya’ by Patanjali.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.480
You can give it any name to it, is different but,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.840
it is a power which we have never felt before

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:09.600
which is a subtle power which does all living work.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.520
So, as if,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.560
if you have not reached that source of energy,

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:22.360
the whole development outside is collapsing.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:27.640
Also, supposing this instrument

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.000
is not connected to the mains,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.960
then, it has no identity, it has no meaning. Why was it created?

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.800
And everywhere these days I find the seekers

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:47.880
are trying to find out their identity.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.800
So what is your identity, is that you are the Spirit,

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.880
you are the ‘Spirit’ and this Spirit

00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:04.440
is the ultimate that you have to become.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.880
Once you become the Spirit,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.680
in the light of the Spirit

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.480
you see the Truth.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.120
First of all on your fingertips

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.960
you start feeling this cool breeze,

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.200
‘cool breeze of the Holy Ghost’, you can call it

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.240
or this ‘All pervading power of Divine Love’.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.560
And when you start feeling that power,

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.200
is... your body acts like a computer.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.760
You ask any question.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.680
There are many people who don’t believe - there is no God.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:45.840
I think it is very unscientific to say there is no God,

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.680
because you have not found out.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.440
Without finding out how can you say there is no God?

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.160
They have all kinds of funny stories even about Christ.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.480
They say He was not the son of God. How do you say?

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:05.600
You are not at that point where you can decide,

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.600
what is true, what is not.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.840
Just mental projections,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.520
they go on condemning all the great incarnations, and

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.960
all the great prophets, and seers and sages

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.120
because they are all blind.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.640
Kabira says that, "O God, how am I to explain

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.720
to all these people who are blind in this world?"

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:32.120
Kaise samaja hu, sab jagah andha (Hindi to be checked).

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.280
So, Sahaja means, ‘Saha” means born,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.520
‘saha’ means ‘with’, ‘ja’  ’born’.

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.080
Born with you is the right

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:47.800
to become a ‘yogi’, to have this union, ‘yoga’

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.480
with the Divine.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.480
And it is very simple now.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.000
In the modern times it's very simple.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.960
In the olden days there were people

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:07.960
who were trying to give Realization, Self-Realization,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.920
but they would have one or two disciples only.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.680
And will...

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.920
they would not reveal the secrets about the ‘Kundalini’,

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.720
so clearly.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.720
In the twelfth century

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.920
one great poet called Gyaneshwara,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.640
he asked permission from his master -

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.560
his own brother was his master - that, "Allow me to talk about it.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.200
And I will not do anything

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.600
but I'll just talk about it in my book,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.000
‘Gyaneshwari’.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.680
In the sixth chapter He wrote very clearly about it.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:57.480
In Sanskrit we had, fourteen thousand years back

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.760
a great Markendeya who had written about it.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.160
Sixth century also ‘Adi Shankaracharya’ wrote about it.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.800
But it was all in Sanskrit, was not available to common people.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.360
After this,

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.560
after the twelfth century

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.200
when he (Gyaneshwara) wrote it, the people who were in charge of religion

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.920
said that this is a

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.360
‘nishiddha’, means is something not to be read by anyone,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.800
it's not, because they didn’t know what to do about it.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.080
They had no idea, they had no knowledge.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.720
They had no knowledge about the Divine

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.680
and they were in charge of religion, maybe making money.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.880
So the second...

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.840
lot of people, saints came up in India

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.640
In the sixteenth century

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.160
who have talked about it,

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.600
all over the country, about this ‘Kundalini’.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.480
In the Bible also it is written

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.160
that I will appear before you like ‘tongues of flames’,

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.960
and these look like tongues of flames,

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.760
very silent, beautiful.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:04.960
In these colors as shown here, they look like.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.320
And some people have described them, those who have been

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.720
moving round the circle.

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.120
But, to enter into it, to be -

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.120
supposing I see the light, I am not the light.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.200
This is the point many people have missed,

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.240
that you have to be not to see something.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.240
And once you become

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.920
then you have so many powers within you

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.240
that you start manifesting them.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.920
The other day there were some these

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.160
‘born again’ people were just...

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.280
like mad, were there shouting, shouting.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.640
I said, "You are not 'born again', what are you doing?"

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.560
You just call themselves ‘born again’, is not the way.

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.440
As we call ourselves Hindus, Muslims, Christians, this -

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.840
we are not!

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.880
We are really not because

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.720
anybody can commit any mistake,

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.120
can commit any sin -

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.320
you may belong to any religion.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.800
So there's something missing within you and your religion.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.440
It is not innately manifesting within you.

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.320
And that's the point we have to be

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.760
honest about it.

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.560
That our religion and ourselves

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.040
are not one with ourselves.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.040
As we can see something,

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.240
are we righteous?

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:45.120
Innately are we righteous? We are not.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.720
And there are temptations and temptations,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.520
so what’s wrong?

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.200
We do all kinds of

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.800
things and as far as the religion is concerned,

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.560
still what you find

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:02.560
that the religion is not one with us.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.600
And so many bad things are happening,

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.720
you see these Muslims being killed here,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.560
these Israelis are being killed and this, I mean

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.960
it is really I can’t understand

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.960
how can you do it in the name of God.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.760
Now this Bosnia problem is there and people are

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.560
dying and eating each other’s body,

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.880
that sort of thing. I mean, can you imagine in modern times

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.040
such things are happening all over the world?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.480
And it disturbs you completely -

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.440
that "Why is it they don’t want to see the point?"

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.680
There's something missing.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.120
With all that we have to understand that

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.440
if we have to solve the problem of religion,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.760
one thing we must know, that all these religions

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.680
were born on the same tree of spirituality.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.960
Only we have plucked the flowers.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:07.480
and now we are fighting with the dead flowers.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.000
Then where is the religion?

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.560
Religion is this part that is shown as the green colour.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.520
You see the ten petals, the Ten commandments,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:22.840
ten petals. And this is to be awakened.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.280
That's only possible if this ‘Kundalini’ rises.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.320
She is your own power.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.600
She is your own individual mother.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.680
She has recorded everything within Herself,

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.880
what you have been doing, what was your past

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.280
and what are your problems

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.600
and what are your conditionings.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.200
All your ventures She knows.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.400
It's like a tape recorder.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.640
But She's your mother

00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.960
and She is anxious to give you your second birth,

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.000
very anxious, because these are some special times.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.080
I call them Blossom Time.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:05.560
In the Bible they say it is ‘Last Judgment’

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.400
and in the Koran it is called ‘Khayyama’,

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.960
is the resurrection time - whatever you may call it.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.960
This is a special time when you are born

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.600
and you are all seekers, you are born

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.680
to seek the Truth.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.240
Be honest about it

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:26.600
that we have not yet achieved what we wanted

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.040
out of whatever religion we follow,

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.600
whatever way we worship God.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.960
Some people have some sort of satisfaction

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.200
that, "No, no, no, Mother, we are very happy we have got this...

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.640
No, that's not so.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.040
With this happening,

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.880
the first thing happens to you that

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.360
you develop a new dimension in your, your awareness.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:01.120
Just now you are not even conscious of your centers.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.320
Then you know your centers on your fingertips,

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.480
you can feel them also inside.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.600
Like somebody will come and tell Me, "Mother,

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.920
my ‘Agnya’ is caught. Please clear it out.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.960
Meaning what? "I am very egoistical.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.400
My ego is troubling me."

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.520
Nobody would say that normally.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.520
Nobody will even think he has ego.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.400
But with this, you get separated

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.680
from yourself and you see yourself

00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:35.400
and your problems.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.520
So the first thing happens to you,

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.680
that you have self-knowledge.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.560
And the second thing then happens to you,

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.760
that you have the knowledge of others.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.200
That is the ‘collective consciousness’,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.560
in which sitting down here you can find out

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.960
whose chakras are catching where,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.120
what's happening where, what's wrong with somebody.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.320
But you don’t talk the language

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.480
as we talk about, "Oh, this one is a corrupt man

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.320
or he is just like that, he has this problem".

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.840
No, we talk on chakras only.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.880
This is what the disciples of Christ were talking,

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.960
the language of chakras.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.680
You say that "this person has this problem,

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.320
this person has this problem".

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.640
And you start not criticizing, telling him anything,

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.320
but if you know how to correct your chakras,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.640
you can correct yours and you can correct others.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.120
This is the power you get which I call it as the

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.800
‘collective consciousness’.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.440
Because who is the other?

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.640
Is what we say,

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.600
the ‘microcosm’ becomes the ‘macrocosm’.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.120
The one drop becomes the ocean.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.840
The consciousness of the ocean comes within.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:04.160
This is what is just waiting at your threshold.

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.880
You can get it.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.080
It's very easy because it’s your own power

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.480
and it manifests,

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.960
so that you discover how glorious you are,

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.160
how powerful you are.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.720
When this power starts flowing through you

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.360
it corrects your chakras no doubt.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.600
But also

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.480
in the light of your Spirit your attention becomes

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.160
very innocent.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.640
Christ had said "Thou shall not have adulteress eyes".

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.080
I would like to see

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.840
any Christian nation where they don’t have

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:52.560
people of this kind.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.440
So

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:56.920
your attention becomes innocent

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.920
and wherever you put your attention on,

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:05.520
then what happens? It acts, it works.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.400
It works very well.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:13.760
So you become a global personality,

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.360
universal personality.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.720
You can spread your attention.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.120
But you become so compassionate,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.600
so compassionate that you never think of harming anyone.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.600
But anything that is harming,

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.160
you just put your attention and correct it

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.360
in your own life and the lives of others.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.720
It is unbelievable for people

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.560
to think that they can be that dynamic and

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.080
they can show those results - but they can.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.320
Because all these powers are within you.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.680
Please understand

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.440
that I have nothing to do with it. It's a living process.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.960
Like in the Mother Earth

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.760
if you put one seed it sprouts by itself.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.000
Because the seed has a capacity to sprout

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.400
and the Mother also has the capacity to sprout.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.160
It's a built-in capacity.

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.080
And when the built-in capacity is there,

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:19.280
it just acts as a living process.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.560
So far, at a human level

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:29.120
we have all limited memories, limited energies, limited,

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:35.720
we can call, intelligence and projection of mind -

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.960
and they are mostly artificial.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.320
So you jump into reality and you understand what is reality is.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.200
Yet you have not known the reality.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.280
So confused.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.120
What is reality?

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.280
And the reality is that you are the ‘Spirit’

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.320
and that this all pervading power

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.840
is flowing through you as realized souls.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:13.240
As you know the absolute truth, you can find out about anyone

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.080
who comes and says, "All right this is religion, this is God",

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.920
or say, "This is correct"

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:26.360
in every area, in every part of your activities.

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.240
Who is the correct man? How will you know?

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.480
Who is the one who is telling you the lies and who the one

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.560
who is just deceiving you?

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.000
As it is, I am ashamed to say,

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.400
that from my country so many

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.520
have come to loot you,

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.440
take advantage of your ignorance.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.600
But even there was one realized soul he would have pointed out

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.880
that, "These are all thieves, don’t go near them".

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:05.960
So this all pervading power is the ocean of knowledge.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.640
I've seen people

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.720
who have been ordinary artists have become great artists,

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.560
even Australia;

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.520
musicians have become great musicians, talented.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.720
But those who were government servants, as most of you might be,

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.240
who had nothing to do with art, maybe,

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:31.080
suddenly become artists, poets.

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.280
I was Myself surprised because I have always -

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.560
as you know my husband has been a

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.480
hard-boiled bureaucrat -

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.760
and I've seen it,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:48.880
people transforming themselves into such beautiful personalities

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.520
and doing good work now,

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.160
working out everything so well.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.560
So what happens, that

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.000
supposing you are standing in the water,

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.840
in the sea and you are getting drowned because of the waves,

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.320
but somehow you come on a boat,

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.680
then you can see the waves and enjoy them.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.400
But in case you know how to swim,

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.200
if you know how to swim you can save others.

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.840
This is exactly what happens to you.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.240
It is also true that most of the diseases get cured,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.360
or if you are getting into any diseases,

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.680
immediately know that you are getting into this trouble,

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.720
immediately. It's not difficult.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.080
Because on the centers you can feel it.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.120
What center is going out of gear

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.120
and immediately you know.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.400
If you know how to correct it, you are cured.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.840
You don’t have to pay any medicine -

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.040
for medicine or anything.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.040
Specially for diagnosis,

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.440
I mean, normally

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.480
a patient is killed before he is diagnosed, isn’t it?

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.640
But in this the diagnosis is so easy.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.960
On your finger tips you can say what's wrong with you,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.400
what's wrong with others.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:22.200
And you become a very dynamic personality.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.320
You must be knowing, I am 71 years of age.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.840
And practically I am travelling every day.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.320
Tomorrow I am going to New Zeeland early in the morning,

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.800
having a program in the evening.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.280
This morning I came, I have a program.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.880
It is working out all right; I mean nothing wrong with Me.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.800
But I never think I am travelling,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.640
I think I am there. As I'm sitting here on a chair,

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.960
I am sitting inside the aeroplane.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.800
So the first thing that happens to you really is

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.560
a new state of your mind

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.280
which we call as ‘thoughtless awareness’.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.400
That happens,

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.880
say, if you are thinking,

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.160
you are thinking about the future or the past.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.320
If I tell you, "Stand in your present" - you cannot.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:19.280
Present, you cannot, you cannot.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.880
You are either thinking of the future or of the past.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.600
And the thought comes like that, rises,

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.360
falls, again comes up, falls, like that.

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.800
Now we are jumping on the cusps of these thoughts.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.600
But with the ‘Kundalini’ awakening, these thoughts elongate

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.640
and in between them is what we call is the pause,

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.760
the ‘vilamba’ where there is no thought.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.720
And you are absolutely aware.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.720
No thought - you are absolutely aware

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:54.840
and you are without any thought,

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.400
in your peace. That is how you achieve your peace.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.160
It's no use having

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.080
peace foundations which I've seen.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.600
Many people who have peace foundations, peace awards,

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.960
they are so hot-tempered

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.520
that if you have to talk to them

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.360
better have a barge pole in between.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.440
They get awards for peace and peace and peace,

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.080
such a lot of money they have collected for peace,

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.040
but where is the peace? There is no peace within.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:30.440
So first you achieve your peace and you watch.

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.120
As I said when you get onto a boat you watch.

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.320
And when you see the problem you solve it better.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.560
If you are in it, you cannot.

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:48.440
So also one must know that

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.680
this All Pervading Power

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:57.120
is the source of all the blessings.

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.720
So many blessings are showered on you.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.960
People are writing to Me every day,

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.120
at least hundred letters

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.920
saying, "This has happened Mother.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.840
You know, this is my blessing.

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.240
This was a miracle, that was a miracle."

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.120
Now miracle has lost its power in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.880
"This happened to me, this

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.560
happened to my health, this happened to my

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.680
writings, this happened to my....

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.360
I was going in the plane and what,

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.160
how I was saved and how in the

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.720
accident I was saved" - so many of them.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.760
They can’t explain.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:39.040
So that we talk of God who blesses us.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.440
But we never felt that way so directly as we feel it now.

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.840
So much so that...

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.000
I was ....I told somebody that you better compile them.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.280
Within months' time, he said, "Mother they have come up to my head.

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.880
Now you tell me what to compile."

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.480
I said, "Forget it".

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.960
Because the ocean of blessings,

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:01.120
believe Me, is ocean of blessings.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.920
It's the ocean of compassion and love.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.200
It forgives.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:17.440
Above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.400
and it forgives.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.080
So, such a great power

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.160
which is itself so powerful,

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.320
this energy starts flowing through you.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.920
And it is everything is tangible.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.600
Now if I say that

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.040
diseases are cured -

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:47.160
we have four doctors now in Delhi University

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:52.680
who have got their MD (Master’s Degree) in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.320
It does cure, also cancer,

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.600
it cures so many diseases

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.800
that I cannot in this short lecture tell you.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.760
But one should come as a seeker of truth,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.600
not just to get yourself cured.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.320
Because you will be cured today,

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.640
again you will have another disease.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:15.680
Best is to get your Self-Realization fully

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.800
and establish yourself.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.840
Sometimes these connections are loose

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.360
so you have to establish.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.840
And most evident

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.960
is that you cannot pay.

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.520
You cannot pay for living work.

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.880
How much do you pay to Mother Earth?

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:40.600
So you cannot pay.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.440
Everybody thinks

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.800
that God has a bank or something and He,

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:49.200
He earns money out of us.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.280
That's your headache. Money is your headache not His.

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.360
So you don’t have to pay anything.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.040
It's not like an introductory lecture here

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.280
and then you go back and start

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.040
paying somewhere else - not that.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.160
You cannot pay for Self-Realization.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:09.840
You can pay for this hall, maybe.

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.480
But you can't pay for this Self-Realization.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.560
And once you realize

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.640
that what is your worth and value,

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.440
you really give up nonsensical things.

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.400
Like you belong to this group, you belong to that group

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:28.680
and you follow this type of methodology or that.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.080
But what have you got? Now face it up.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.440
What powers have you got?

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.360
Tomorrow you can get cancer,

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:39.720
you can get anything.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.120
One can become mad.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.880
I mean they are saying in America within ten years

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:48.560
65 per cent will be schizophrenic. Can you imagine?

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.800
Already I think they are very immature people

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.080
and if they become schizophrenic, what will happen to this world?

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.280
And they are so important.

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.720
So there's something going wrong,

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.720
we have to understand and we have to correct it.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.800
The greatest thing that happens to you

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.520
that you enter into the kingdom of God.

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.320
No more in the kingdom

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.920
of any country, but in the kingdom of God

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:26.440
where you are

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.400
drowned in joy,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.000
you are swimming in joy.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.440
What is joy?

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:35.840
Joy is not like happiness or unhappiness.

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.120
If your ego is pampered you feel happy

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:44.520
and if your ego is punctured you feel unhappy.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:47.640
But joy is singular.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.400
You just enjoy, anything,

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:57.120
anything nice, beautiful without desiring to have it.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.520
Now this power that is within you

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.560
is the primordial Mother

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:08.600
who is being reflected in you as ‘Kundalini’.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.440
Surprisingly in many religions they have not talked

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.520
of the primordial Mother.

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.720
Like they have the father, the son and the Holy Ghost.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.000
They have never said a word about the Mother,

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.160
the feminine part of it - I don’t know.

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.240
Especially with Bible, I think Mr Paul must have done it.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.440
Cause I don’t know why he is in the Bible. He never saw even Christ.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:35.680
All such things have happened.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.440
Woman is the ‘shakti’, she's the power

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.520
and if you treat her like that then she

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:48.280
becomes something else. She is no more a woman.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.240
Is a saying in Sanskrit, ’Yatra naryastu pujynte,

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.680
tatra ramante devanta’ [Sanskrit to be checked].

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.880
Where the women are respectable or respected,

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.920
respectable -

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:04.280
they have lost the sense of respectability, of chastity -

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:10.040
there reside Gods.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.480
So all these things also, these ideas of

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.360
condemning men or women or this and that and

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.520
making divisions and divisions in this division, is never there.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.480
It's the synthesis,

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:29.680
internal synthesis of the whole human beings, is the whole

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.680
world is going to take place.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:38.560
As you know Sahaja Yoga is now working  in sixty nations.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.960
Of course India, it is all right, because we in India we have this

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.480
tradition.

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.840
They know what is Self-Realization.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.680
But in Russia

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.960
where they never knew who is God.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.440
You won’t believe

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.920
that I can’t hold a program on such a small scale there.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:08.840
Minimum of minimum, sixteen to eighteen thousand people,

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.560
a very learned, very learned people.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.640
See, they are scientists and they are doctors.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:22.160
And the scientists - I started on

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.760
science - they said, "Mother we know science, everything.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.400
Now we don’t want to know anymore science.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.400
You tell us why are we on this earth

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.000
and you tell us about divine laws.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.680
We don’t want to hear any more about science, had enough of it."

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.400
Can you imagine they have bestowed

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.280
a very great honor on Me?

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.960
St. Petersburg University.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.280
I don’t know if he has told you or not,

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.960
but surprisingly,

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.720
it's one of the oldest universities

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.600
and there have been only ten members so far been

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.480
and Einstein is one of them, you see.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.920
I said how, I felt very amazed, was...

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.920
I felt very shy with the whole thing.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.040
They said, "Why Einstein? Einstein only worked on matter,

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.200
you are working on human beings".

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.760
I said, "I am not working; it is their own desire

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.880
is working, their own power is..."

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.360
So they are so sensitive, I can't understand.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.360
Seventy per cent of

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.320
Russians are extremely

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:30.120
sensitive to spirituality - all Eastern bloc.

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.200
We have been busy with our materialism, with our choices this...

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.800
Where have we landed?

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.560
And when they had the coup I was there,

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:42.240
and I asked, "Aren’t you worried?

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.800
Aren’t you worried about this coup?" They said,

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.600
"Why? Why should we worry?

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.200
We are in the kingdom of God, why should we worry?"

00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.400
Simple answer.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.840
Such lovely people they are!

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:58.440
They had never known Me, they had

00:42:58.640 --> 00:42:59.800
never seen Me, I mean...

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:01.880
And no other ‘guru’ could stay there,

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.800
you will be surprised, they threw out all of them.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.120
So this sensitivity comes I don’t know from where.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.960
How they have understood that

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.680
reality is the thing we have to achieve now,

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:19.640
that we have to become the ‘Spirit’, the ‘soul’,

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.560
and not anything else.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:30.320
I was amazed the way these people have reacted!

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.960
I don’t want to put a sort of a competition

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.880
for you or a challenge for you.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.360
But definitely there's something -

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.280
despite their very bad government and everything,

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:47.880
how they have maintained themselves, so introspective.

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.360
I wish

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.960
people all over the world understand

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.560
that there are problems.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.000
Your children have problems.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.040
Other day I was reading that

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:06.960
you cannot avoid small children, teenage children

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.640
who are not taking drugs.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.960
Why do they take drugs?

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.640
They are seeking something.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:23.440
And they can’t find it - out of frustration.

00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.080
But with Sahaja Yoga

00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.520
people have given up drugs overnight -

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:32.320
I assure you - there are some sitting here like that.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.320
Overnight they gave up drugs

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.320
and whatever damage it had caused them on their brains,

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:42.040
they have been recovered.

00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.360
All these indulgences

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.760
that have suffered,

00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:52.480
because of the genes, I think, genes, must be the [cause]...

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.320
The other day I read about the genes that

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.440
there are two protective genes within us.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.680
Surprisingly they said

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.880
that Asians have them all the time.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.080
So they take time to take to something like that.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.880
One gene

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.960
protects you from being violent, angry,

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:18.960
hot tempered, cruel

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.960
corrupt, all kinds of things.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:27.200
We can call it the father, the sin against the father.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:31.160
And the another gene protects you from indulging

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.680
into destructive things: sex,

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.880
too much of it, I mean this all kinds of rapes and so many

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.920
horrible things that we have never heard of such things

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.960
that are going on in these countries,

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:47.080
where they are supposed to be developed.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.640
And also indulging into

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:56.120
drugs and alcohol and all that.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.520
This protective gene

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:03.960
is being absolutely awakened again I have seen

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.480
after Realization.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:11.400
Whether you are an Asian or not, makes no difference.

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.960
But also look at these Germans.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.120
They say that they are the highest race, you know they feel.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.920
They are the ones who killed small little children in the

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:23.240
gas chamber and they saw them suffering.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:26.480
How could they do it?

00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:29.040
And they are supposed to be a very,

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.240
what you call them,

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.840
higher races. Max Muller says

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:36.440
that they came to India and wrote ‘Vedas’.

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:40.840
How can they write ‘Vedas’, these people?

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.080
They are not afraid of God,

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.960
the way they have behaved...

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:49.760
But now Sahaja Yogis, the Sahaja Yogis Germans, you should say,

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.760
the gentlest people you could think of, gentlest.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.920
They won’t hurt you, I mean, they are so beautiful.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:02.680
So this ‘Kundalini’ is the one, She cleanses all that,

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:09.440
makes you peaceful, joyous and collective.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:15.080
Now I hope you all get your Realization tonight.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:17.440
Have faith in yourself - that's the main thing.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:21.720
You must have faith that you will all get Realization.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.120
I know there are people who have some questions also.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.120
These questions now I can answer - for the last

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:31.040
twenty four years I have been doing this kind of work

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.880
all over the world.

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.080
So I can answer,

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.680
because it's just a mental acrobat - I have become quite an expert.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.800
But it is of no use.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.760
By that thing you are not going to get to your Realization.

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.560
What you have to ask really is your Self-Realization.

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:54.160
This power is the power of pure desire.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:58.640
All other desires, as you know, in economics,

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.160
that in general that they are not satiable.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:06.360
You may be aware, may not be aware, but this desire is within you,

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.280
is to become the Spirit,

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.880
to become one with this All Pervading Power

00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.560
and that acts, works and helps you.

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.560
Everything is tangible.

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:21.360
You will be amazed how it works,

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.360
how it helps you!

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:26.320
The second thing I have to tell you

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.120
that it is not an individual thing.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.920
It is not that, you can say, "Oh!".

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.960
First day you may feel very happy

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.920
and very relaxed, on top of the world.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.200
That's not important.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.480
You have to come to the collective.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.280
You must understand

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.960
the whole knowledge about your internal being

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:51.720
and you have to be with the collective to grow.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:56.120
Like if I take out one, say

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.920
nail out of my fingers, it will never grow.

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.880
So it's the

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:06.680
whole being, is a living organism.

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.440
Only thing, you have to pay

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.720
some time, as time... for it.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:18.000
They will tell you how to be in meditation, not to do meditation,

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.320
how to be in meditation.

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:24.520
So first you get the state of ‘thoughtless awareness’ -

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.880
we call it as ‘Nirvichar Samadhi’.

00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.800
And then the state you get is called as ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’,

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.040
where you get all the powers of raising others' ‘Kundalini’,

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.960
giving them Realization, curing, everything.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.640
Those who have never come to the stage become orators.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.800
See these musicians singing Indian songs.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.880
Can you imagine this?

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:48.080
I mean, English speaking people, so hard

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.560
for Indian music, I tell you,

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.080
especially for Indian words.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:54.800
But when they sing, ask Indians,

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.640
they will tell you they sing like Indians...

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.440
It was so difficult to teach even one word

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.320
to the Englishmen in India -

00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.800
one word. And now you see this.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.440
What has happened to them?

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.120
How suddenly they have picked up

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:16.520
all the rhythm, all the thing, which is very difficult.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.560
So...

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.800
all these powers which are within you,

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.960
you have to manifest

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:27.360
and enjoy your virtues, enjoy your virtues.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:31.320
You don’t become proud, but you enjoy them.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:33.560
You enjoy your generosity,

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.680
enjoy your compassion,

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.960
never feel that you are

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.400
taking too much trouble, you are doing this and that, nothing.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:47.160
You think of others all the time and you live in peace

00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:49.440
and create peace all around.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.000
We have these people from sixty

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.680
nations; they come to India once a year.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:01.200
I've never seen them quarrelling, fighting,

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:05.840
doing anything against each other - never.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:10.040
How do they live from all different countries, from Chinese

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.880
to Africans, from Africans to English

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.200
and from English to Americans and Australians - so many?

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.880
In Sydney we have twenty two centers.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:24.560
I must say Australia is one of our

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.320
very great country which has really

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:35.480
very enthusiastically has taken to Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:38.600
And I am sure also you all will.

00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.280
We have a great story in our ‘Puranas’ about Australia

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.840
which sometimes I'll tell you.

00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.080
So may God Bless you!

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:52.600
And you be confident that you will have your Realization just now.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:57.280
You don’t have to do much - just it will take ten minutes more.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:06.320
But, of course, I respect your freedom.

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.360
If you don’t want to have your Realization,

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.480
you should leave the hall. I cannot force on you.

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.960
It is something it cannot be forced.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.800
I respect your freedom out and out.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.200
So, if you want to go, you can go.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:34.120
All of you want Realization - it's very good.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.960
Now one thing that should not upset you,

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.320
because I've seen people get upset if I tell them

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:44.040
that you have to take out your shoes.

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:47.480
I hope you won’t be upset with that.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:59.000
You need not take out your socks but your shoes.

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.200
I does, sometimes.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.800
Don’t have to say any mantras, nothing,

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.960
and you don’t have to concentrate also.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.440
Please don’t try to concentrate.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.800
Just keep yourself open.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.720
Don’t force yourself into anything.

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.080
As I am saying, telling you that

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.800
it has become so easy now -

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.360
you don’t have to go to Himalayas

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:39.960
and stand on your head or anything.

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.400
You have to be very comfortable

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.640
and also

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.760
you should be very much pleasantly placed toward yourself.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.520
Because as I said, you are human beings,

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.960
you are at the epitomy of evolution.

00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:01.880
And you are...  have a right to have this,

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:07.240
because you are born at this time with a special purpose.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.600
So in no way you should condemn yourself.

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.800
This is the first condition.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:16.680
Have full confidence.

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:20.040
The another thing is you shouldn’t feel guilty at this time;

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.600
please don’t feel guilty for anything.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:26.840
It has become a fashion now to feel guilty for anything.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:29.640
I mean, even, if supposing you spill some

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.520
coffee you go on feeling guilty for your life.

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.960
What's this going on?

00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.120
You must value yourself.

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:39.360
This life is not meant

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:42.880
for feeling bad for small, small things.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:47.160
It is very great, it’s very precious.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.920
So please don’t have any guilt.

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.600
But if you have, then you catch on this center here.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:59.400
And this is such a dangerous thing because it gives you

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:02.600
what we call as angina.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:07.840
It may give you spondylitis. It may give you very lethargic organs.

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.480
So very dangerous is to feel guilt.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.800
So why feel guilty unnecessarily?

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.520
I tell you if you were guilty, you would have been in jail.

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.360
Now you are sitting here, so don’t feel guilty about

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:22.320
anything whatsoever.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.640
I assure you, you are not guilty.

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:34.120
So, you have to really forgive yourself.

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.880
Now, the most simple condition is this

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:44.360
that you have to forgive everyone.

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:47.600
People might say it's very difficult to forgive.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:51.160
But, whether you forgive or not - I am telling the logic,

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:54.600
now think about it - whether you forgive or not what do you do?

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:57.280
I don’t do anything.

00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:01.520
But when you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:06.440
Those who have troubled you, tortured you,

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.000
are not feeling bad.

00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.960
But you are the one who is torturing yourself.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.760
But at this time, the problem is that this centre of Agnya

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:21.080
which is like this, absolutely constructed like this, like a cross -

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:23.560
it is on the optic chiasma -

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.200
and if you don’t forgive, it won’t open at all.

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.400
But if you forgive

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:30.440
it will definitely open and the Kundalini will pass.

00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.960
So, at this juncture you as it is

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.640
troubled yourself so much,

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:37.880
at this juncture please,

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:41.120
please forgive everyone in general.

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.640
Don’t even think about them because it is a headache.

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.680
It's a real headache even to think of these people.

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:49.960
So you just forgive in general.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:54.320
Of course we'll tell you how to do it. It's very simple.

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:58.120
Now to begin with you keep your eyes open,

00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.400
I'll show you how you have to

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:08.040
yourself enrich your own centers - very simple.

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.520
So please put your left hand towards Me like this comfortably.

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.800
You have to be comfortable. That’s very important.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.920
Please both the feet apart from each other

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:18.680
because these are two powers, left and right.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.880
Put your left hand towards Me on your lap,

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.960
just like this.

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.800
And now

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:34.280
we have to use our left side with our right hand.

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:39.920
Now please put your right hand on your heart.

00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:46.880
This is the center where the Spirit resides.

00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.680
If you become the Spirit,

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:52.120
you become your own master in the light of the Spirit.

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.640
So please take your right hand

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:59.320
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the liver.

00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:05.840
All of you should do it, please.

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.400
This is the center of your mastery

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:11.960
which is created by great prophets

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:18.240
and seers and sages.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:21.720
Surprisingly the center of pure knowledge

00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:25.280
is lower here on the left hand side

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:31.240
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:38.840
Whatever you have done, forget it, forget it.

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:45.680
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:52.040
Now on your heart.

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.960
Now in the corner of your neck and shoulders.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.720
As I have already told you

00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.920
when this center catches what is the problem.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:06.440
Turn your head to your right, please.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:09.120
It’s very catching today.

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:14.520
Please don’t feel guilty for anything. You must...

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.760
There.

00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:23.360
Please take your right hand on top of your forehead across

00:59:23.560 --> 00:59:26.960
and bend your head slowly.

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:31.440
We have to be humble about it, you see.

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:38.320
So here you have to forgive everyone in general.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:46.120
Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.840
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:54.880
Here,

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:59.040
without counting your mistakes,

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.680
without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction,

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.240
you will have to ask forgiveness

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.520
from this All Pervading Power.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:16.640
Now please stretch your hand or palm fully.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.440
Now we go to the last center,

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.040
so please put the centre of your palm

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.360
on top of the fontanel bone area

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.400
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:35.160
Now please put down your head.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.120
Now push back your fingers nicely

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.320
so there's a good pressure on your scalp.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.360
Now put down your head and you have to move, move the scalp

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.080
seven times clockwise very slowly.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.200
That’s all we have to do actually.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.960
But remember you have to push back your fingers.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.160
Now you can take out your spectacles

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.240
because you have to close your eyes.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.320
It might help also your eyesight.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.680
Please,

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.920
before closing I must tell you again

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.920
that please put both the

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.560
legs apart from each other

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.440
and the left hand

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:36.840
towards Me on your lap comfortably in any way that you like.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.840
And then now place your right hand on your heart.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.320
Here, I've told you resides the Spirit.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.400
You have to ask Me

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.880
a very fundamental question about yourself in your heart.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:02.400
So please,

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.440
ask in your heart, three times.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.480
You can call me ‘Mother’ or ‘Shri Mataji’ whatever you like.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.880
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.960
Ask this question three times in your heart.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.280
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.760
Now, I've told you if you become the ‘Spirit’,

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.480
you become your own master.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.680
So now take down your right hand

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.880
in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.840
on the left hand side.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.400
Here,

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.520
you have to ask another fundamental question.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:59.960
“Mother, am I my master?”

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:05.200
Ask this question three times.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.720
I have already told you

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.280
that I respect your freedom.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.640
And I cannot force

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:24.240
divine pure knowledge on you.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.920
So now

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.960
please take your right hand

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.040
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:40.160
Here,

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.600
you have to ask six times,

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.840
because this center has got six petals,

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:53.800
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge”,

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.320
or you can say, “Mother please give me divine pure knowledge”.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.920
Whatever is divine is pure.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.680
Six times.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.800
As soon as you start asking

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.080
for pure divine knowledge,

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.840
the ‘Kundalini’ starts rising like a primule.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:23.160
Now we have to

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.840
open our higher centers

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.600
by our self-confidence,

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.240
for the Kundalini to pass through.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.680
Now, take your right hand -

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.080
you are working only on the left hand side -

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.360
in the upper portion

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.600
of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.280
Press it hard.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:52.440
Now, here with full confidence, please say ten times,

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.040
“Mother, I am my own master”.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.080
The Kundalini wants

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.960
you to show yourself confidence.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.960
Please say it ten times.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.760
At the very outset, I've told you

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.600
that the truth is that you are not this body,

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.240
this mind, this ego, these feelings,

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.240
these emotions, these conditionings,

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:30.800
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.440
So, now raise your right hand on top of your heart.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:40.480
And here you have to say again with full self-confidence,

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:45.120
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.720
Please say it.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.160
Please say it twelve times,

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.520
“Mother I am the pure Spirit”.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.920
I have already told you

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.560
that this All Pervading Power

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.280
is the ocean of knowledge,

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.480
ocean of compassion,

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:16.080
ocean of blessings, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:20.160
And whatever mistakes you might have committed,

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.320
are easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.200
So forgive yourself.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.720
And put your right hand

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.480
in the corner of your neck and shoulder

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.560
and turn your head to your right.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.880
Here,

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.280
with full confidence again,

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.120
you have to say sixteen times,

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.800
“Mother, I am not guilty at all”,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.440
“Mother I am not guilty at all”. Please say this.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.560
Is very important because this center

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.640
is catching very much tonight here.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.760
Now I have told you

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.240
whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.080
But if you don’t forgive,

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.560
then you play into wrong hands

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.120
and torture yourself.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.920
Especially at this moment, you should forgive

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.960
all of them, without thinking about them, in general,

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.520
so that your center opens out.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.840
Otherwise at this important moment,

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.680
you may miss your Self Realization.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.360
It's very important

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.560
to forgive all of them from your heart.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.000
Not how many times, it's not the point, from your heart.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.840
So now please put your right hand

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.800
on you forehead across

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.080
and bend your head as much as you can.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.720
And here,

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.000
you have to say,

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:09.400
not how many times, but from your heart,

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:15.840
“Mother, I forgive everyone in general”,

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.960
from your heart. Please say it from your heart.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.520
And now

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.040
please put your right hand on the back side of your head

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:46.800
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.160
Here, without feeling guilty,

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.120
without counting your mistakes,

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.200
just for your satisfaction,

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.480
you have to say,

01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.520
not how many times, but from your heart,

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.560
“Oh, Divine Power,

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.640
if I have done any mistake,

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.720
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me”.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.920
Just say it from your heart.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.640
“O Divine Power,

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.480
if I have done anything wrong,

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.400
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me”.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.680
Now

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.760
please stretch your palms.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.760
Put the center of your palm

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.200
on top of your fontanel bone area

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:48.520
which is a soft bone in your childhood.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.040
Here again,

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.320
I cannot force Self-Realization on you. You have to ask for it.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.280
So now push back your fingers - that's important -

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.240
and please put down your head.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.400
Now move your scalp with this pressure,

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.280
seven times, saying

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.880
seven times,

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.920
“Mother, please give me my Self-Realization”,

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.640
because I cannot force it on you.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.800
Please push back your fingers.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.480
Bend your heads; please push back your fingers.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.000
Keep your eyes shut, till I tell you

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.480
please keep them shut.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.160
Please take down your hands

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:12.000
and try to open your eyes slowly.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.440
Push both the hands towards Me.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.880
Now,

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.360
put the left hand towards Me like this,

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.200
bend your head and see with the right hand

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:36.480
if there is a cool or a warm breeze-like energy

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.960
is coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.920
Now don’t doubt, because air conditioning is not in your head.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.560
So just see for yourself. Some people think it is air conditioning.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.040
Some people get it hot.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.320
Some people get it far,

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.560
some closer,

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.800
but don’t put your hand on top of your head,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.280
away from it.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.840
See for yourself,

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.240
and if it is hot, that means you have not yet forgiven.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.480
So please forgive also.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.120
Now,

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.280
please put your right hand. Now, bend your head nicely

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.120
and see for yourself with the left hand

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:23.320
if there's a cool or a hot breeze-like energy is coming

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.560
out of your fontanel bone area.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.640
You have to move your hand up and down, sideways also. All right.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.080
Now do it with the left hand again.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.640
Little further. Some people get it further.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:50.160
Bend your heads, that is important, bend your heads.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.760
Now,

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.040
please put both your hands towards the sky.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.080
Push back your head

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.040
and ask anyone of these three questions,

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.840
three times, anyone of them.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.960
You can say, ”Mother,

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.040
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”,

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.000
or ”Mother, is this the

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.920
All Pervading Power of Divine Love?”,

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.160
or ”Mother, is this the Ruh

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.560
or Paramchaitanya?”.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.360
Ask anyone of these questions, three times.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.720
Now, just come down.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.680
Now please put your hands like this

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.120
and watch Me without thinking.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.840
Just watch Me without thinking.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.680
All those who have felt

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.480
hot or cold breeze on their fingertips,

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:17.720
on their palms or out of their fontanel bone area,

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.080
please raise both your hands.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.960
My God! Look at that.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.480
I mean most of you.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.840
May God bless you!

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.520
It's tremendous.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.160
Some didn’t get it, very few,

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.840
but most of you have got it.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.960
In any case all of you should get it.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.200
And those who haven’t got

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.280
should please later on come to the stage and they will do it.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.760
But in the meanwhile

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.560
we'll try something else

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.440
for Realization

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.080
and maybe that might help a little bit.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.960
[Marathi].

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.880
See this might help.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.360
This will be only five minutes experiment. Let's see.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.280
Which song will you sing?

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.480
[Marathi].

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.560
[Marathi].

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.960
This is the song they are going to sing,

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.120
was written - Namadeva -

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.760
by Namadeva in the sixteenth century

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.760
who went then to Punjab

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.760
and Guru Nanak Sahib, you see,

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.600
knew who he was and He asked him to write

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.120
poems in Punjabi language.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.000
And he has done such big compilation, I know that.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.480
This guru

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.960
was ...

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.240
he was just a tailor.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.520
And he went to see, meet

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.960
another realized soul who was a potter.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.320
And when he went and saw the potter kneading

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:11.920
the clay with his feet, he just stood there, watching him.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.880
The potter’s name was Gora Kumbhar.

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:19.120
Looked at him and what does he say,

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.880
in Marathi says that, but meaning

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.000
that, I came to see here

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.960
the "formless",

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.120
but it is "in the form".

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.120
I see it "in the form".

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:40.880
I mean only a saint can say it to another saint.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.440
That’s what happened

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.080
that he went up to Punjab

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.360
where Guru Nanak Sahib

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.560
called him, looked after him and asked him and they made beautiful,

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.040
I mean such beautiful songs there are and they are in Granth Sahib.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.800
They are all in Granth Sahib.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.680
[unclear].

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.320
This is the folk song

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:11.240
which was written, which says, “Oh, Mother, give me my Realization.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.440
‘Jogwa’ means Yoga - "Please give me that".

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.960
All that they sang,

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.320
all the time they have been singing, even now,

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.360
but they don’t know what it is.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.280
And they are saying, "Oh, Ambe" - means the Kundalini -

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.280
"please rise, rise".

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.280
And with you can also clap. It will help a lot, I am sure.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.000
This will definitely consolidate your Self-Realization.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.400
It is a village song. It’s a rustic...

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.160
Now you feel. Just try to feel now. Let's see.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.600
You must be feeling more, just see.

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.120
All right?

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.960
Now again, let us see how many of you have really

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.400
felt on your finger tips

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:47.160
or from your fontanel bone area or on your palms.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.400
Raise your both the hands.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.400
Oh! So, who didn’t feel before, have felt it - so many of you.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.960
Thank you very much. May God look after you.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.600
And also have wisdom

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:08.200
to respect your freedom,

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:14.560
respect your new status.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.880
The real freedom is now.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.280
So you respect your Self-Realization

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:29.880
and become a fully self-realized personality.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.600
That will help everywhere.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.320
May God bless you all!

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.360
Thank you very much, it was wonderful.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.920
You all have paper to know where the centers are

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.840
and I hope...

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.720
What's it?

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.240
...and where you are going to have

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.000
a follow-on program.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.800
All right?

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.120
Please, please come.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.200
Do you know?

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.520
What's it? They haven’t got paper already?

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.960
SY: They have, Shri Mataji.

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.200
SM: They all have?

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.040
Where are you having follow on?

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:55.840
Yes, yes, but when are having the follow on, where?

01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:00.280
You don't know.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.680
SY: As you go on out

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.000
there are leaflets there which will tell you...

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.240
all you need to know about follow-up programs.

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.080
Ah, we've got one here, finally.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.960
There's a series of seven programs

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.720
beginning on Monday 11th of April

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:25.360
then for six consecutive Thursdays commencing

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.600
Thursday 14th of April

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.680
at seven thirty to nine thirty

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.600
the [Far placed Room], Gorman House Art Center

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.720
Ainslie Avenue, Braddon.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.000
And there's a little bracket here, and we will provide

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.000
light refreshments to follow.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:50.480
Again remind you that all Sahaja Yoga programs

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:54.160
are completely free.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:59.320
There, if you have any questions you want to ask about that

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.440
there's two phone numbers here that

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:04.560
will tell you where to ring.

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.760
It really tells you everything you want to know

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.800
and you can pick up one of these up

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.080
as you go out the door.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.760
Now they've got a big supply there.

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.120
One other thing, if is anybody here

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.720
who - as soon as Shri Mataji's left -

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.320
if there's anybody here who has not felt anything tonight,

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.080
I would like to try.

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:38.120
There's probably a very good reasons, as we explained to you earlier.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.880
You have these centers - you can also have blocked centers -

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.520
they may be quite easily to clear, might be quite easy to clear and then

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:47.000
[unclear].

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.720
Before you leave here tonight

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:50.840
if are any of you didn't feel anything
