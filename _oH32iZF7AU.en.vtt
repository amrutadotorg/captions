03:33.280 --> 03:37.200
I think you can go down. There are lots of seats still vacant.

05:09.160 --> 05:13.240
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.320
At the very outset

05:20.520 --> 05:24.920
I have to tell you that truth is what it is.

05:26.480 --> 05:32.280
You cannot transform it, change it

05:32.520 --> 05:39.440
and unfortunately at this human awareness you cannot know it.

05:44.160 --> 05:47.600
Now whatever I am going to tell you today,

05:47.800 --> 05:51.520
you need not believe blind folded. We have already

05:51.760 --> 05:56.200
suffered a lot because of blind faith.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.560
But if it is proved

05:59.760 --> 06:03.120
then as honest people you have to accept it.

06:04.560 --> 06:09.560
Because it is for the benevolence of your being,

06:09.760 --> 06:14.920
for the benevolence of your society,

06:15.120 --> 06:20.680
your city, your country and the world at large.

06:23.240 --> 06:25.960
So one has to understand

06:26.160 --> 06:32.240
that we have not known so far the Absolute Truth.

06:32.440 --> 06:35.000
If we had known the Absolute Truth

06:35.200 --> 06:38.960
there would not have been any problem whatsoever.

06:40.720 --> 06:44.520
Because everybody would see the same truth.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.280
There cannot be so many [dead] dogmas,

06:48.480 --> 06:52.760
so many discussions, arguments, fights and wars.

06:52.960 --> 07:00.120
If everybody sees the same point then who will fight?

07:00.320 --> 07:04.000
For example I am sitting before you, you all see it clearly

07:04.240 --> 07:05.240
and you know it.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.920
So you are not going to fight that I am here or not.

07:10.720 --> 07:16.320
For that we need a last breakthrough of our evolution.

07:16.520 --> 07:21.640
As human beings, still, we have freedom to think whatever we like

07:21.840 --> 07:27.600
but we haven’t got capacity to know the Absolute Truth.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.760
If that is so and if there is a way out,

07:30.960 --> 07:34.120
why not we try for it?

07:34.320 --> 07:38.960
You have been already told about this,

07:40.760 --> 07:43.360
this instrument that is within you.

07:43.560 --> 07:48.600
I've never seen such a big one - today is the only...

07:52.920 --> 07:57.360
In Australia everything is big I tell you.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.520
Very nice.

07:59.720 --> 08:04.280
I mean it can cover a very big hall as we had yesterday.

08:04.480 --> 08:08.520
A day before we had three thousand three hundred people

08:08.720 --> 08:10.960
and this would have been better there.

08:11.160 --> 08:13.600
All right, as it is

08:13.800 --> 08:18.520
this is the subtle instrument that is within us.

08:18.720 --> 08:22.840
It's created through our evolutionary process.

08:25.200 --> 08:31.320
As we learn, say, science and other things

08:31.560 --> 08:34.960
from western countries, from Australia, from all

08:35.200 --> 08:38.840
Japanese countries and all that.

08:39.040 --> 08:43.920
We can see the civilization has grown so big

08:44.120 --> 08:49.000
and we do not know our roots.

08:49.200 --> 08:54.880
That’s why, what is happening is, people are waiting for a shock.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.240
Already they are very much upset.

08:58.440 --> 09:02.400
What has gone wrong with us that we should know our roots?

09:02.600 --> 09:06.800
Now if these roots are coming from East or from India

09:07.000 --> 09:11.120
why should we abhor it,

09:11.320 --> 09:13.920
why should we condemn it?

09:14.120 --> 09:15.960
Because it's very important

09:16.160 --> 09:18.320
that we have to seek our roots

09:18.520 --> 09:21.400
and this is the knowledge of the roots.

09:25.520 --> 09:30.040
The human problems

09:30.240 --> 09:34.440
actually cover all the global problems, most of it.

09:34.640 --> 09:39.920
And to solve them

09:40.120 --> 09:47.320
we have to see to this inner subtle instrument within us.

09:47.520 --> 09:52.200
When these centers are in jeopardy,

09:52.400 --> 09:55.960
then we get physical, mental, emotional, spiritual,

09:56.160 --> 09:58.960
social, political, all problems -

09:59.160 --> 10:02.960
because problems are caused by human beings

10:03.200 --> 10:07.000
and human beings are in trouble because of these centers.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.760
So if by chance,

10:11.960 --> 10:15.080
you know how to correct your centers

10:15.280 --> 10:19.000
and then to correct others' centers also,

10:19.200 --> 10:22.200
you solve the problem.

10:22.400 --> 10:25.960
Now this power that is being told as ‘Kundalini’,

10:26.160 --> 10:28.160
is called ‘Kundalini’ because

10:28.360 --> 10:32.600
‘Kundal’ means coils - it is coiled three and a half times.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.360
It has some mathematical calculation.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.400
Now this ‘Kundalini’ when She is awakened

10:39.600 --> 10:42.000
She passes through these centers

10:42.200 --> 10:45.320
and She enlightens them.

10:45.520 --> 10:49.200
She nourishes them and She integrates.

10:49.400 --> 10:54.520
Ultimately She pierces through your fontanel bone area -

10:54.720 --> 10:58.800
in Sanskrit we call it ‘Brahmarandra’ -pierces through

10:58.960 --> 11:05.160
and becomes one with this all pervading power.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.280
So you achieve two results.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.080
So the truth about you is that

11:12.280 --> 11:17.480
you are not this body, mind, your ego, your conditionings.

11:17.680 --> 11:19.400
Because you say this is my ego,

11:19.600 --> 11:22.760
this is my conditioning, this is my house,

11:22.960 --> 11:25.320
this is my wife, my husband.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.760
So this ’my’, who is the ‘my’ there?

11:29.960 --> 11:33.080
So you become the ‘I’, the ‘self’,

11:33.280 --> 11:36.920
that is the ‘Spirit’, which you are!

11:37.120 --> 11:40.880
And the second truth is that there is an All Pervading Power

11:41.080 --> 11:45.120
which does all the living work.

11:45.360 --> 11:50.520
Look at these beautiful flowers; it's a miracle, if you see?

11:50.720 --> 11:54.000
They are different flowers from different seeds of certain heights,

11:54.200 --> 11:57.280
certain shapes, certain colour

11:57.480 --> 12:00.840
and you take it for granted.

12:01.040 --> 12:06.400
You don’t even think about them how they have come out like that.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.960
Who runs our heart?

12:10.160 --> 12:12.440
The doctors will say: autonomous nervous system.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.640
But who is the ‘auto’?

12:15.840 --> 12:19.200
So we never question anything about living process,

12:19.400 --> 12:22.000
because we can’t answer.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.080
This living process

12:24.320 --> 12:28.400
is done by a very subtle energy,

12:28.600 --> 12:33.960
which we can call by any name,

12:34.160 --> 12:38.520
is the ‘divine power of love’.

12:38.720 --> 12:43.600
You can call it as ‘Ruh’ as in Koran,

12:43.800 --> 12:49.840
you can call it as ‘Brahmachaitanya’ as in Sanskrit

12:50.040 --> 12:56.520
and as ‘Ritambhara Pragya’ by Patanjali.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.480
You can give it any name to it, is different but,

12:59.800 --> 13:03.840
it is a power which we have never felt before

13:04.040 --> 13:09.600
which is a subtle power which does all living work.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.520
So, as if,

13:11.720 --> 13:16.560
if you have not reached that source of energy,

13:16.760 --> 13:22.360
the whole development outside is collapsing.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.640
Also, supposing this instrument

13:27.840 --> 13:31.000
is not connected to the mains,

13:31.200 --> 13:36.960
then, it has no identity, it has no meaning. Why was it created?

13:38.680 --> 13:42.800
And everywhere these days I find the seekers

13:42.960 --> 13:47.880
are trying to find out their identity.

13:48.080 --> 13:52.800
So what is your identity, is that you are the Spirit,

13:52.960 --> 13:56.880
you are the ‘Spirit’ and this Spirit

13:57.080 --> 14:04.440
is the ultimate that you have to become.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.880
Once you become the Spirit,

14:07.080 --> 14:09.680
in the light of the Spirit

14:09.880 --> 14:11.480
you see the Truth.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.120
First of all on your fingertips

14:14.320 --> 14:18.960
you start feeling this cool breeze,

14:19.160 --> 14:21.200
‘cool breeze of the Holy Ghost’, you can call it

14:21.400 --> 14:25.240
or this ‘All pervading power of Divine Love’.

14:25.440 --> 14:29.560
And when you start feeling that power,

14:29.800 --> 14:33.200
is... your body acts like a computer.

14:33.400 --> 14:35.760
You ask any question.

14:35.960 --> 14:38.680
There are many people who don’t believe - there is no God.

14:38.880 --> 14:45.840
I think it is very unscientific to say there is no God,

14:46.040 --> 14:48.680
because you have not found out.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.440
Without finding out how can you say there is no God?

14:52.640 --> 14:56.160
They have all kinds of funny stories even about Christ.

14:56.360 --> 15:01.480
They say He was not the son of God. How do you say?

15:01.680 --> 15:05.600
You are not at that point where you can decide,

15:05.800 --> 15:07.600
what is true, what is not.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.840
Just mental projections,

15:10.040 --> 15:14.520
they go on condemning all the great incarnations, and

15:14.720 --> 15:17.960
all the great prophets, and seers and sages

15:18.160 --> 15:20.120
because they are all blind.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.640
Kabira says that, "O God, how am I to explain

15:24.800 --> 15:27.720
to all these people who are blind in this world?"

15:27.920 --> 15:32.120
Kaise samaja hu, sab jagah andha (Hindi to be checked).

15:32.320 --> 15:36.280
So, Sahaja means, ‘Saha” means born,

15:38.360 --> 15:40.520
‘saha’ means ‘with’, ‘ja’  ’born’.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.080
Born with you is the right

15:43.280 --> 15:47.800
to become a ‘yogi’, to have this union, ‘yoga’

15:47.960 --> 15:49.480
with the Divine.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.480
And it is very simple now.

15:53.680 --> 15:58.000
In the modern times it's very simple.

15:58.200 --> 16:01.960
In the olden days there were people

16:02.240 --> 16:07.960
who were trying to give Realization, Self-Realization,

16:08.200 --> 16:12.920
but they would have one or two disciples only.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.680
And will...

16:17.880 --> 16:21.920
they would not reveal the secrets about the ‘Kundalini’,

16:22.120 --> 16:25.720
so clearly.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.720
In the twelfth century

16:28.920 --> 16:31.920
one great poet called Gyaneshwara,

16:32.120 --> 16:34.640
he asked permission from his master -

16:34.840 --> 16:39.560
his own brother was his master - that, "Allow me to talk about it.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.200
And I will not do anything

16:42.400 --> 16:44.600
but I'll just talk about it in my book,

16:44.800 --> 16:47.000
‘Gyaneshwari’.

16:47.200 --> 16:51.680
In the sixth chapter He wrote very clearly about it.

16:51.880 --> 16:57.480
In Sanskrit we had, fourteen thousand years back

16:57.680 --> 17:00.760
a great Markendeya who had written about it.

17:00.960 --> 17:05.160
Sixth century also ‘Adi Shankaracharya’ wrote about it.

17:05.360 --> 17:09.800
But it was all in Sanskrit, was not available to common people.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.360
After this,

17:11.560 --> 17:13.560
after the twelfth century

17:13.760 --> 17:17.200
when he (Gyaneshwara) wrote it, the people who were in charge of religion

17:17.400 --> 17:18.920
said that this is a

17:19.120 --> 17:22.360
‘nishiddha’, means is something not to be read by anyone,

17:22.560 --> 17:24.800
it's not, because they didn’t know what to do about it.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.080
They had no idea, they had no knowledge.

17:27.320 --> 17:29.720
They had no knowledge about the Divine

17:29.920 --> 17:34.680
and they were in charge of religion, maybe making money.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.880
So the second...

17:39.080 --> 17:42.840
lot of people, saints came up in India

17:43.040 --> 17:44.640
In the sixteenth century

17:44.840 --> 17:47.160
who have talked about it,

17:47.360 --> 17:50.600
all over the country, about this ‘Kundalini’.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.480
In the Bible also it is written

17:52.680 --> 17:55.160
that I will appear before you like ‘tongues of flames’,

17:55.360 --> 17:56.960
and these look like tongues of flames,

17:57.200 --> 17:58.760
very silent, beautiful.

17:58.960 --> 18:04.960
In these colors as shown here, they look like.

18:05.200 --> 18:09.320
And some people have described them, those who have been

18:09.520 --> 18:12.720
moving round the circle.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.120
But, to enter into it, to be -

18:15.320 --> 18:20.120
supposing I see the light, I am not the light.

18:20.320 --> 18:23.200
This is the point many people have missed,

18:23.400 --> 18:28.240
that you have to be not to see something.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.240
And once you become

18:31.440 --> 18:34.920
then you have so many powers within you

18:35.120 --> 18:37.240
that you start manifesting them.

18:37.480 --> 18:38.920
The other day there were some these

18:39.120 --> 18:41.160
‘born again’ people were just...

18:41.400 --> 18:44.280
like mad, were there shouting, shouting.

18:44.480 --> 18:48.640
I said, "You are not 'born again', what are you doing?"

18:48.840 --> 18:52.560
You just call themselves ‘born again’, is not the way.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.440
As we call ourselves Hindus, Muslims, Christians, this -

18:55.640 --> 18:58.840
we are not!

18:59.040 --> 19:00.880
We are really not because

19:01.080 --> 19:04.720
anybody can commit any mistake,

19:04.920 --> 19:06.120
can commit any sin -

19:06.320 --> 19:10.320
you may belong to any religion.

19:10.520 --> 19:14.800
So there's something missing within you and your religion.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.440
It is not innately manifesting within you.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.320
And that's the point we have to be

19:22.520 --> 19:24.760
honest about it.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.560
That our religion and ourselves

19:28.760 --> 19:33.040
are not one with ourselves.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.040
As we can see something,

19:36.240 --> 19:39.240
are we righteous?

19:39.440 --> 19:45.120
Innately are we righteous? We are not.

19:45.320 --> 19:48.720
And there are temptations and temptations,

19:48.920 --> 19:51.520
so what’s wrong?

19:51.720 --> 19:53.200
We do all kinds of

19:53.440 --> 19:55.800
things and as far as the religion is concerned,

19:55.960 --> 19:57.560
still what you find

19:57.760 --> 20:02.560
that the religion is not one with us.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.600
And so many bad things are happening,

20:04.800 --> 20:06.720
you see these Muslims being killed here,

20:06.920 --> 20:09.560
these Israelis are being killed and this, I mean

20:09.760 --> 20:11.960
it is really I can’t understand

20:12.200 --> 20:15.960
how can you do it in the name of God.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.760
Now this Bosnia problem is there and people are

20:20.960 --> 20:23.560
dying and eating each other’s body,

20:23.760 --> 20:26.880
that sort of thing. I mean, can you imagine in modern times

20:27.080 --> 20:29.040
such things are happening all over the world?

20:29.240 --> 20:32.480
And it disturbs you completely -

20:32.680 --> 20:35.440
that "Why is it they don’t want to see the point?"

20:35.640 --> 20:39.680
There's something missing.

20:39.880 --> 20:45.120
With all that we have to understand that

20:45.320 --> 20:50.440
if we have to solve the problem of religion,

20:50.640 --> 20:53.760
one thing we must know, that all these religions

20:53.960 --> 20:57.680
were born on the same tree of spirituality.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.960
Only we have plucked the flowers.

21:00.200 --> 21:07.480
and now we are fighting with the dead flowers.

21:07.680 --> 21:09.000
Then where is the religion?

21:09.200 --> 21:13.560
Religion is this part that is shown as the green colour.

21:13.760 --> 21:16.520
You see the ten petals, the Ten commandments,

21:16.720 --> 21:22.840
ten petals. And this is to be awakened.

21:23.040 --> 21:27.280
That's only possible if this ‘Kundalini’ rises.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.320
She is your own power.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.600
She is your own individual mother.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.680
She has recorded everything within Herself,

21:37.880 --> 21:40.880
what you have been doing, what was your past

21:41.080 --> 21:43.280
and what are your problems

21:43.480 --> 21:45.600
and what are your conditionings.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.200
All your ventures She knows.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.400
It's like a tape recorder.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.640
But She's your mother

21:51.840 --> 21:54.960
and She is anxious to give you your second birth,

21:55.160 --> 21:59.000
very anxious, because these are some special times.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.080
I call them Blossom Time.

22:01.280 --> 22:05.560
In the Bible they say it is ‘Last Judgment’

22:05.760 --> 22:08.400
and in the Koran it is called ‘Khayyama’,

22:08.600 --> 22:11.960
is the resurrection time - whatever you may call it.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.960
This is a special time when you are born

22:15.200 --> 22:17.600
and you are all seekers, you are born

22:17.800 --> 22:19.680
to seek the Truth.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.240
Be honest about it

22:22.440 --> 22:26.600
that we have not yet achieved what we wanted

22:26.800 --> 22:29.040
out of whatever religion we follow,

22:29.240 --> 22:32.600
whatever way we worship God.

22:32.800 --> 22:36.960
Some people have some sort of satisfaction

22:37.200 --> 22:40.200
that, "No, no, no, Mother, we are very happy we have got this...

22:40.400 --> 22:43.640
No, that's not so.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.040
With this happening,

22:46.240 --> 22:48.880
the first thing happens to you that

22:49.080 --> 22:54.360
you develop a new dimension in your, your awareness.

22:54.560 --> 23:01.120
Just now you are not even conscious of your centers.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.320
Then you know your centers on your fingertips,

23:04.600 --> 23:07.480
you can feel them also inside.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.600
Like somebody will come and tell Me, "Mother,

23:09.800 --> 23:12.920
my ‘Agnya’ is caught. Please clear it out.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.960
Meaning what? "I am very egoistical.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.400
My ego is troubling me."

23:17.600 --> 23:21.520
Nobody would say that normally.

23:21.720 --> 23:25.520
Nobody will even think he has ego.

23:25.720 --> 23:28.400
But with this, you get separated

23:28.600 --> 23:31.680
from yourself and you see yourself

23:31.880 --> 23:35.400
and your problems.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.520
So the first thing happens to you,

23:37.720 --> 23:40.680
that you have self-knowledge.

23:40.880 --> 23:43.560
And the second thing then happens to you,

23:43.760 --> 23:46.760
that you have the knowledge of others.

23:46.960 --> 23:50.200
That is the ‘collective consciousness’,

23:50.400 --> 23:54.560
in which sitting down here you can find out

23:54.760 --> 23:56.960
whose chakras are catching where,

23:57.160 --> 24:00.120
what's happening where, what's wrong with somebody.

24:00.320 --> 24:02.320
But you don’t talk the language

24:02.520 --> 24:05.480
as we talk about, "Oh, this one is a corrupt man

24:05.680 --> 24:08.320
or he is just like that, he has this problem".

24:08.520 --> 24:10.840
No, we talk on chakras only.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.880
This is what the disciples of Christ were talking,

24:14.080 --> 24:15.960
the language of chakras.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.680
You say that "this person has this problem,

24:18.880 --> 24:21.320
this person has this problem".

24:21.520 --> 24:26.640
And you start not criticizing, telling him anything,

24:26.840 --> 24:29.320
but if you know how to correct your chakras,

24:29.520 --> 24:32.640
you can correct yours and you can correct others.

24:32.840 --> 24:36.120
This is the power you get which I call it as the

24:36.320 --> 24:38.800
‘collective consciousness’.

24:38.960 --> 24:43.440
Because who is the other?

24:43.640 --> 24:45.640
Is what we say,

24:45.840 --> 24:49.600
the ‘microcosm’ becomes the ‘macrocosm’.

24:49.800 --> 24:54.120
The one drop becomes the ocean.

24:54.320 --> 24:58.840
The consciousness of the ocean comes within.

24:59.040 --> 25:04.160
This is what is just waiting at your threshold.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.880
You can get it.

25:07.120 --> 25:12.080
It's very easy because it’s your own power

25:12.280 --> 25:14.480
and it manifests,

25:14.680 --> 25:17.960
so that you discover how glorious you are,

25:18.160 --> 25:21.160
how powerful you are.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.720
When this power starts flowing through you

25:23.920 --> 25:26.360
it corrects your chakras no doubt.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.600
But also

25:28.800 --> 25:33.480
in the light of your Spirit your attention becomes

25:33.680 --> 25:38.160
very innocent.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.640
Christ had said "Thou shall not have adulteress eyes".

25:41.880 --> 25:43.080
I would like to see

25:43.280 --> 25:45.840
any Christian nation where they don’t have

25:46.040 --> 25:52.560
people of this kind.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.440
So

25:54.640 --> 25:56.920
your attention becomes innocent

25:57.120 --> 25:59.920
and wherever you put your attention on,

26:00.120 --> 26:05.520
then what happens? It acts, it works.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.400
It works very well.

26:08.600 --> 26:13.760
So you become a global personality,

26:13.960 --> 26:15.360
universal personality.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.720
You can spread your attention.

26:17.920 --> 26:21.120
But you become so compassionate,

26:21.320 --> 26:24.600
so compassionate that you never think of harming anyone.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.600
But anything that is harming,

26:27.800 --> 26:31.160
you just put your attention and correct it

26:31.360 --> 26:35.360
in your own life and the lives of others.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.720
It is unbelievable for people

26:37.920 --> 26:40.560
to think that they can be that dynamic and

26:40.760 --> 26:44.080
they can show those results - but they can.

26:44.280 --> 26:49.320
Because all these powers are within you.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.680
Please understand

26:50.880 --> 26:55.440
that I have nothing to do with it. It's a living process.

26:55.640 --> 26:56.960
Like in the Mother Earth

26:57.200 --> 26:59.760
if you put one seed it sprouts by itself.

26:59.960 --> 27:04.000
Because the seed has a capacity to sprout

27:04.200 --> 27:08.400
and the Mother also has the capacity to sprout.

27:08.600 --> 27:11.160
It's a built-in capacity.

27:11.360 --> 27:14.080
And when the built-in capacity is there,

27:14.280 --> 27:19.280
it just acts as a living process.

27:19.480 --> 27:22.560
So far, at a human level

27:22.760 --> 27:29.120
we have all limited memories, limited energies, limited,

27:29.320 --> 27:35.720
we can call, intelligence and projection of mind -

27:35.920 --> 27:38.960
and they are mostly artificial.

27:39.160 --> 27:44.320
So you jump into reality and you understand what is reality is.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.200
Yet you have not known the reality.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.280
So confused.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.120
What is reality?

27:52.320 --> 27:56.280
And the reality is that you are the ‘Spirit’

27:56.480 --> 27:59.320
and that this all pervading power

27:59.520 --> 28:04.840
is flowing through you as realized souls.

28:07.480 --> 28:13.240
As you know the absolute truth, you can find out about anyone

28:13.440 --> 28:17.080
who comes and says, "All right this is religion, this is God",

28:17.280 --> 28:18.920
or say, "This is correct"

28:19.120 --> 28:26.360
in every area, in every part of your activities.

28:26.560 --> 28:30.240
Who is the correct man? How will you know?

28:30.440 --> 28:33.480
Who is the one who is telling you the lies and who the one

28:33.680 --> 28:35.560
who is just deceiving you?

28:35.760 --> 28:38.000
As it is, I am ashamed to say,

28:38.240 --> 28:40.400
that from my country so many

28:40.600 --> 28:42.520
have come to loot you,

28:42.720 --> 28:47.440
take advantage of your ignorance.

28:47.640 --> 28:51.600
But even there was one realized soul he would have pointed out

28:51.800 --> 28:56.880
that, "These are all thieves, don’t go near them".

28:59.280 --> 29:05.960
So this all pervading power is the ocean of knowledge.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.640
I've seen people

29:07.840 --> 29:10.720
who have been ordinary artists have become great artists,

29:10.920 --> 29:13.560
even Australia;

29:13.760 --> 29:17.520
musicians have become great musicians, talented.

29:17.720 --> 29:21.720
But those who were government servants, as most of you might be,

29:21.920 --> 29:25.240
who had nothing to do with art, maybe,

29:25.440 --> 29:31.080
suddenly become artists, poets.

29:31.280 --> 29:34.280
I was Myself surprised because I have always -

29:34.480 --> 29:37.560
as you know my husband has been a

29:37.760 --> 29:40.480
hard-boiled bureaucrat -

29:40.680 --> 29:42.760
and I've seen it,

29:42.960 --> 29:48.880
people transforming themselves into such beautiful personalities

29:49.120 --> 29:51.520
and doing good work now,

29:51.720 --> 29:54.160
working out everything so well.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.560
So what happens, that

29:57.760 --> 30:02.000
supposing you are standing in the water,

30:02.200 --> 30:06.840
in the sea and you are getting drowned because of the waves,

30:07.040 --> 30:10.320
but somehow you come on a boat,

30:10.520 --> 30:13.680
then you can see the waves and enjoy them.

30:13.880 --> 30:18.400
But in case you know how to swim,

30:18.600 --> 30:22.200
if you know how to swim you can save others.

30:22.400 --> 30:26.840
This is exactly what happens to you.

30:27.040 --> 30:31.240
It is also true that most of the diseases get cured,

30:31.440 --> 30:34.360
or if you are getting into any diseases,

30:34.560 --> 30:38.680
immediately know that you are getting into this trouble,

30:38.880 --> 30:43.720
immediately. It's not difficult.

30:43.920 --> 30:46.080
Because on the centers you can feel it.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.120
What center is going out of gear

30:48.320 --> 30:50.120
and immediately you know.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.400
If you know how to correct it, you are cured.

30:52.600 --> 30:54.840
You don’t have to pay any medicine -

30:55.160 --> 30:57.040
for medicine or anything.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.040
Specially for diagnosis,

30:59.240 --> 31:00.440
I mean, normally

31:00.640 --> 31:04.480
a patient is killed before he is diagnosed, isn’t it?

31:04.680 --> 31:07.640
But in this the diagnosis is so easy.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.960
On your finger tips you can say what's wrong with you,

31:11.200 --> 31:16.400
what's wrong with others.

31:16.600 --> 31:22.200
And you become a very dynamic personality.

31:22.400 --> 31:26.320
You must be knowing, I am 71 years of age.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.840
And practically I am travelling every day.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.320
Tomorrow I am going to New Zeeland early in the morning,

31:31.520 --> 31:32.800
having a program in the evening.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.280
This morning I came, I have a program.

31:36.480 --> 31:39.880
It is working out all right; I mean nothing wrong with Me.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.800
But I never think I am travelling,

31:42.000 --> 31:45.640
I think I am there. As I'm sitting here on a chair,

31:45.840 --> 31:48.960
I am sitting inside the aeroplane.

31:49.160 --> 31:53.800
So the first thing that happens to you really is

31:54.000 --> 31:56.560
a new state of your mind

31:56.760 --> 32:00.280
which we call as ‘thoughtless awareness’.

32:00.480 --> 32:03.400
That happens,

32:03.600 --> 32:07.880
say, if you are thinking,

32:08.080 --> 32:11.160
you are thinking about the future or the past.

32:11.400 --> 32:15.320
If I tell you, "Stand in your present" - you cannot.

32:15.520 --> 32:19.280
Present, you cannot, you cannot.

32:19.480 --> 32:22.880
You are either thinking of the future or of the past.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.600
And the thought comes like that, rises,

32:25.800 --> 32:29.360
falls, again comes up, falls, like that.

32:29.560 --> 32:33.800
Now we are jumping on the cusps of these thoughts.

32:33.960 --> 32:37.600
But with the ‘Kundalini’ awakening, these thoughts elongate

32:37.800 --> 32:41.640
and in between them is what we call is the pause,

32:41.840 --> 32:45.760
the ‘vilamba’ where there is no thought.

32:45.960 --> 32:49.720
And you are absolutely aware.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.720
No thought - you are absolutely aware

32:52.920 --> 32:54.840
and you are without any thought,

32:55.040 --> 32:59.400
in your peace. That is how you achieve your peace.

32:59.600 --> 33:04.160
It's no use having

33:04.360 --> 33:07.080
peace foundations which I've seen.

33:07.320 --> 33:10.600
Many people who have peace foundations, peace awards,

33:10.800 --> 33:12.960
they are so hot-tempered

33:13.160 --> 33:14.520
that if you have to talk to them

33:14.720 --> 33:17.360
better have a barge pole in between.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.440
They get awards for peace and peace and peace,

33:20.640 --> 33:23.080
such a lot of money they have collected for peace,

33:23.280 --> 33:26.040
but where is the peace? There is no peace within.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.440
So first you achieve your peace and you watch.

33:30.640 --> 33:34.120
As I said when you get onto a boat you watch.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.320
And when you see the problem you solve it better.

33:37.520 --> 33:42.560
If you are in it, you cannot.

33:42.760 --> 33:48.440
So also one must know that

33:48.640 --> 33:51.680
this All Pervading Power

33:51.880 --> 33:57.120
is the source of all the blessings.

33:57.320 --> 34:00.720
So many blessings are showered on you.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.960
People are writing to Me every day,

34:03.160 --> 34:06.120
at least hundred letters

34:06.320 --> 34:07.920
saying, "This has happened Mother.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.840
You know, this is my blessing.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.240
This was a miracle, that was a miracle."

34:12.440 --> 34:15.120
Now miracle has lost its power in Sahaja Yoga.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.880
"This happened to me, this

34:17.080 --> 34:19.560
happened to my health, this happened to my

34:19.760 --> 34:22.680
writings, this happened to my....

34:22.880 --> 34:25.360
I was going in the plane and what,

34:25.560 --> 34:28.160
how I was saved and how in the

34:28.360 --> 34:30.720
accident I was saved" - so many of them.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.760
They can’t explain.

34:34.960 --> 34:39.040
So that we talk of God who blesses us.

34:39.240 --> 34:42.440
But we never felt that way so directly as we feel it now.

34:42.640 --> 34:43.840
So much so that...

34:44.040 --> 34:47.000
I was ....I told somebody that you better compile them.

34:47.200 --> 34:50.280
Within months' time, he said, "Mother they have come up to my head.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.880
Now you tell me what to compile."

34:52.080 --> 34:54.480
I said, "Forget it".

34:54.680 --> 34:56.960
Because the ocean of blessings,

34:57.160 --> 35:01.120
believe Me, is ocean of blessings.

35:04.360 --> 35:09.920
It's the ocean of compassion and love.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.200
It forgives.

35:12.400 --> 35:17.440
Above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

35:17.640 --> 35:21.400
and it forgives.

35:21.600 --> 35:25.080
So, such a great power

35:25.280 --> 35:28.160
which is itself so powerful,

35:28.360 --> 35:32.320
this energy starts flowing through you.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.920
And it is everything is tangible.

35:36.120 --> 35:39.600
Now if I say that

35:39.800 --> 35:42.040
diseases are cured -

35:42.240 --> 35:47.160
we have four doctors now in Delhi University

35:47.360 --> 35:52.680
who have got their MD (Master’s Degree) in Sahaja Yoga.

35:52.880 --> 35:56.320
It does cure, also cancer,

35:56.520 --> 35:58.600
it cures so many diseases

35:58.800 --> 36:01.800
that I cannot in this short lecture tell you.

36:01.960 --> 36:04.760
But one should come as a seeker of truth,

36:04.960 --> 36:07.600
not just to get yourself cured.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.320
Because you will be cured today,

36:09.520 --> 36:11.640
again you will have another disease.

36:11.840 --> 36:15.680
Best is to get your Self-Realization fully

36:15.880 --> 36:18.800
and establish yourself.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.840
Sometimes these connections are loose

36:22.040 --> 36:25.360
so you have to establish.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.840
And most evident

36:28.040 --> 36:29.960
is that you cannot pay.

36:30.160 --> 36:33.520
You cannot pay for living work.

36:33.720 --> 36:37.880
How much do you pay to Mother Earth?

36:38.080 --> 36:40.600
So you cannot pay.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.440
Everybody thinks

36:42.640 --> 36:45.800
that God has a bank or something and He,

36:46.040 --> 36:49.200
He earns money out of us.

36:49.400 --> 36:54.280
That's your headache. Money is your headache not His.

36:54.480 --> 36:57.360
So you don’t have to pay anything.

36:57.560 --> 37:00.040
It's not like an introductory lecture here

37:00.240 --> 37:02.280
and then you go back and start

37:02.480 --> 37:04.040
paying somewhere else - not that.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.160
You cannot pay for Self-Realization.

37:06.360 --> 37:09.840
You can pay for this hall, maybe.

37:10.040 --> 37:14.480
But you can't pay for this Self-Realization.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.560
And once you realize

37:16.760 --> 37:18.640
that what is your worth and value,

37:18.840 --> 37:21.440
you really give up nonsensical things.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.400
Like you belong to this group, you belong to that group

37:24.600 --> 37:28.680
and you follow this type of methodology or that.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.080
But what have you got? Now face it up.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.440
What powers have you got?

37:35.640 --> 37:37.360
Tomorrow you can get cancer,

37:37.560 --> 37:39.720
you can get anything.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.120
One can become mad.

37:41.320 --> 37:43.880
I mean they are saying in America within ten years

37:44.080 --> 37:48.560
65 per cent will be schizophrenic. Can you imagine?

37:48.760 --> 37:51.800
Already I think they are very immature people

37:51.960 --> 37:56.080
and if they become schizophrenic, what will happen to this world?

37:56.280 --> 38:00.280
And they are so important.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.720
So there's something going wrong,

38:02.920 --> 38:07.720
we have to understand and we have to correct it.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.800
The greatest thing that happens to you

38:13.000 --> 38:16.520
that you enter into the kingdom of God.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.320
No more in the kingdom

38:18.520 --> 38:21.920
of any country, but in the kingdom of God

38:22.160 --> 38:26.440
where you are

38:26.640 --> 38:28.400
drowned in joy,

38:28.600 --> 38:31.000
you are swimming in joy.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.440
What is joy?

38:32.640 --> 38:35.840
Joy is not like happiness or unhappiness.

38:36.040 --> 38:39.120
If your ego is pampered you feel happy

38:39.320 --> 38:44.520
and if your ego is punctured you feel unhappy.

38:44.720 --> 38:47.640
But joy is singular.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.400
You just enjoy, anything,

38:51.600 --> 38:57.120
anything nice, beautiful without desiring to have it.

38:57.320 --> 39:00.520
Now this power that is within you

39:00.720 --> 39:02.560
is the primordial Mother

39:02.760 --> 39:08.600
who is being reflected in you as ‘Kundalini’.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.440
Surprisingly in many religions they have not talked

39:11.640 --> 39:13.520
of the primordial Mother.

39:13.720 --> 39:18.720
Like they have the father, the son and the Holy Ghost.

39:18.920 --> 39:21.000
They have never said a word about the Mother,

39:21.200 --> 39:23.160
the feminine part of it - I don’t know.

39:23.360 --> 39:27.240
Especially with Bible, I think Mr Paul must have done it.

39:27.440 --> 39:32.440
Cause I don’t know why he is in the Bible. He never saw even Christ.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.680
All such things have happened.

39:35.880 --> 39:39.440
Woman is the ‘shakti’, she's the power

39:39.640 --> 39:42.520
and if you treat her like that then she

39:42.720 --> 39:48.280
becomes something else. She is no more a woman.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.240
Is a saying in Sanskrit, ’Yatra naryastu pujynte,

39:52.440 --> 39:53.680
tatra ramante devanta’ [Sanskrit to be checked].

39:53.880 --> 39:56.880
Where the women are respectable or respected,

39:57.080 --> 39:58.920
respectable -

39:59.120 --> 40:04.280
they have lost the sense of respectability, of chastity -

40:04.480 --> 40:10.040
there reside Gods.

40:10.240 --> 40:14.480
So all these things also, these ideas of

40:14.680 --> 40:18.360
condemning men or women or this and that and

40:18.560 --> 40:22.520
making divisions and divisions in this division, is never there.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.480
It's the synthesis,

40:24.680 --> 40:29.680
internal synthesis of the whole human beings, is the whole

40:29.880 --> 40:33.680
world is going to take place.

40:33.880 --> 40:38.560
As you know Sahaja Yoga is now working  in sixty nations.

40:38.760 --> 40:42.960
Of course India, it is all right, because we in India we have this

40:43.160 --> 40:44.480
tradition.

40:44.680 --> 40:48.840
They know what is Self-Realization.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.680
But in Russia

40:51.880 --> 40:55.960
where they never knew who is God.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.440
You won’t believe

40:57.640 --> 41:01.920
that I can’t hold a program on such a small scale there.

41:02.120 --> 41:08.840
Minimum of minimum, sixteen to eighteen thousand people,

41:09.040 --> 41:13.560
a very learned, very learned people.

41:13.760 --> 41:18.640
See, they are scientists and they are doctors.

41:18.840 --> 41:22.160
And the scientists - I started on

41:22.360 --> 41:24.760
science - they said, "Mother we know science, everything.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.400
Now we don’t want to know anymore science.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.400
You tell us why are we on this earth

41:30.600 --> 41:33.000
and you tell us about divine laws.

41:33.200 --> 41:37.680
We don’t want to hear any more about science, had enough of it."

41:37.880 --> 41:40.400
Can you imagine they have bestowed

41:40.600 --> 41:43.280
a very great honor on Me?

41:43.480 --> 41:45.960
St. Petersburg University.

41:46.160 --> 41:48.280
I don’t know if he has told you or not,

41:48.480 --> 41:49.960
but surprisingly,

41:50.160 --> 41:52.720
it's one of the oldest universities

41:52.920 --> 41:56.600
and there have been only ten members so far been

41:56.800 --> 41:59.480
and Einstein is one of them, you see.

41:59.680 --> 42:02.920
I said how, I felt very amazed, was...

42:03.120 --> 42:04.920
I felt very shy with the whole thing.

42:05.160 --> 42:08.040
They said, "Why Einstein? Einstein only worked on matter,

42:08.240 --> 42:10.200
you are working on human beings".

42:10.400 --> 42:13.760
I said, "I am not working; it is their own desire

42:13.960 --> 42:16.880
is working, their own power is..."

42:17.080 --> 42:19.360
So they are so sensitive, I can't understand.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.360
Seventy per cent of

42:21.560 --> 42:24.320
Russians are extremely

42:24.520 --> 42:30.120
sensitive to spirituality - all Eastern bloc.

42:30.320 --> 42:34.200
We have been busy with our materialism, with our choices this...

42:34.400 --> 42:38.800
Where have we landed?

42:38.960 --> 42:40.560
And when they had the coup I was there,

42:40.760 --> 42:42.240
and I asked, "Aren’t you worried?

42:42.440 --> 42:44.800
Aren’t you worried about this coup?" They said,

42:45.000 --> 42:46.600
"Why? Why should we worry?

42:46.800 --> 42:51.200
We are in the kingdom of God, why should we worry?"

42:51.400 --> 42:54.400
Simple answer.

42:54.600 --> 42:56.840
Such lovely people they are!

42:57.040 --> 42:58.440
They had never known Me, they had

42:58.640 --> 42:59.800
never seen Me, I mean...

42:59.960 --> 43:01.880
And no other ‘guru’ could stay there,

43:02.080 --> 43:04.800
you will be surprised, they threw out all of them.

43:04.960 --> 43:08.120
So this sensitivity comes I don’t know from where.

43:08.320 --> 43:10.960
How they have understood that

43:11.160 --> 43:14.680
reality is the thing we have to achieve now,

43:14.880 --> 43:19.640
that we have to become the ‘Spirit’, the ‘soul’,

43:19.840 --> 43:23.560
and not anything else.

43:23.760 --> 43:30.320
I was amazed the way these people have reacted!

43:30.520 --> 43:32.960
I don’t want to put a sort of a competition

43:33.160 --> 43:34.880
for you or a challenge for you.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.360
But definitely there's something -

43:37.560 --> 43:41.280
despite their very bad government and everything,

43:41.480 --> 43:47.880
how they have maintained themselves, so introspective.

43:48.080 --> 43:50.360
I wish

43:50.560 --> 43:52.960
people all over the world understand

43:53.160 --> 43:54.560
that there are problems.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.000
Your children have problems.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.040
Other day I was reading that

43:59.240 --> 44:06.960
you cannot avoid small children, teenage children

44:07.160 --> 44:11.640
who are not taking drugs.

44:11.840 --> 44:14.960
Why do they take drugs?

44:15.160 --> 44:18.640
They are seeking something.

44:18.840 --> 44:23.440
And they can’t find it - out of frustration.

44:23.640 --> 44:25.080
But with Sahaja Yoga

44:25.280 --> 44:28.520
people have given up drugs overnight -

44:28.720 --> 44:32.320
I assure you - there are some sitting here like that.

44:32.520 --> 44:34.320
Overnight they gave up drugs

44:34.520 --> 44:37.320
and whatever damage it had caused them on their brains,

44:37.520 --> 44:42.040
they have been recovered.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.360
All these indulgences

44:44.560 --> 44:47.760
that have suffered,

44:47.960 --> 44:52.480
because of the genes, I think, genes, must be the [cause]...

44:52.680 --> 44:55.320
The other day I read about the genes that

44:55.520 --> 44:58.440
there are two protective genes within us.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.680
Surprisingly they said

45:00.880 --> 45:04.880
that Asians have them all the time.

45:05.080 --> 45:08.080
So they take time to take to something like that.

45:08.280 --> 45:09.880
One gene

45:10.080 --> 45:12.960
protects you from being violent, angry,

45:13.200 --> 45:18.960
hot tempered, cruel

45:19.160 --> 45:22.960
corrupt, all kinds of things.

45:23.160 --> 45:27.200
We can call it the father, the sin against the father.

45:27.400 --> 45:31.160
And the another gene protects you from indulging

45:31.400 --> 45:34.680
into destructive things: sex,

45:34.880 --> 45:37.880
too much of it, I mean this all kinds of rapes and so many

45:38.080 --> 45:40.920
horrible things that we have never heard of such things

45:41.120 --> 45:42.960
that are going on in these countries,

45:43.160 --> 45:47.080
where they are supposed to be developed.

45:47.280 --> 45:49.640
And also indulging into

45:49.840 --> 45:56.120
drugs and alcohol and all that.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.520
This protective gene

45:58.720 --> 46:03.960
is being absolutely awakened again I have seen

46:04.160 --> 46:05.480
after Realization.

46:05.680 --> 46:11.400
Whether you are an Asian or not, makes no difference.

46:11.600 --> 46:13.960
But also look at these Germans.

46:14.160 --> 46:17.120
They say that they are the highest race, you know they feel.

46:17.320 --> 46:19.920
They are the ones who killed small little children in the

46:20.120 --> 46:23.240
gas chamber and they saw them suffering.

46:23.440 --> 46:26.480
How could they do it?

46:26.680 --> 46:29.040
And they are supposed to be a very,

46:29.240 --> 46:31.240
what you call them,

46:31.440 --> 46:33.840
higher races. Max Muller says

46:34.040 --> 46:36.440
that they came to India and wrote ‘Vedas’.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.840
How can they write ‘Vedas’, these people?

46:41.040 --> 46:43.080
They are not afraid of God,

46:43.280 --> 46:45.960
the way they have behaved...

46:46.200 --> 46:49.760
But now Sahaja Yogis, the Sahaja Yogis Germans, you should say,

46:49.960 --> 46:53.760
the gentlest people you could think of, gentlest.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.920
They won’t hurt you, I mean, they are so beautiful.

46:57.160 --> 47:02.680
So this ‘Kundalini’ is the one, She cleanses all that,

47:02.880 --> 47:09.440
makes you peaceful, joyous and collective.

47:09.640 --> 47:15.080
Now I hope you all get your Realization tonight.

47:15.280 --> 47:17.440
Have faith in yourself - that's the main thing.

47:17.640 --> 47:21.720
You must have faith that you will all get Realization.

47:21.920 --> 47:25.120
I know there are people who have some questions also.

47:25.320 --> 47:28.120
These questions now I can answer - for the last

47:28.320 --> 47:31.040
twenty four years I have been doing this kind of work

47:31.240 --> 47:32.880
all over the world.

47:33.080 --> 47:34.080
So I can answer,

47:34.280 --> 47:37.680
because it's just a mental acrobat - I have become quite an expert.

47:37.880 --> 47:39.800
But it is of no use.

47:40.000 --> 47:44.760
By that thing you are not going to get to your Realization.

47:44.960 --> 47:48.560
What you have to ask really is your Self-Realization.

47:48.760 --> 47:54.160
This power is the power of pure desire.

47:54.360 --> 47:58.640
All other desires, as you know, in economics,

47:58.840 --> 48:02.160
that in general that they are not satiable.

48:02.360 --> 48:06.360
You may be aware, may not be aware, but this desire is within you,

48:06.560 --> 48:08.280
is to become the Spirit,

48:08.480 --> 48:10.880
to become one with this All Pervading Power

48:11.080 --> 48:14.560
and that acts, works and helps you.

48:14.760 --> 48:16.560
Everything is tangible.

48:16.760 --> 48:21.360
You will be amazed how it works,

48:21.560 --> 48:24.360
how it helps you!

48:24.560 --> 48:26.320
The second thing I have to tell you

48:26.520 --> 48:29.120
that it is not an individual thing.

48:29.320 --> 48:30.920
It is not that, you can say, "Oh!".

48:31.120 --> 48:32.960
First day you may feel very happy

48:33.200 --> 48:36.920
and very relaxed, on top of the world.

48:37.120 --> 48:39.200
That's not important.

48:39.400 --> 48:41.480
You have to come to the collective.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.280
You must understand

48:43.480 --> 48:46.960
the whole knowledge about your internal being

48:47.200 --> 48:51.720
and you have to be with the collective to grow.

48:51.920 --> 48:56.120
Like if I take out one, say

48:56.320 --> 48:59.920
nail out of my fingers, it will never grow.

49:00.120 --> 49:01.880
So it's the

49:02.080 --> 49:06.680
whole being, is a living organism.

49:06.880 --> 49:09.440
Only thing, you have to pay

49:09.640 --> 49:13.720
some time, as time... for it.

49:13.920 --> 49:18.000
They will tell you how to be in meditation, not to do meditation,

49:18.200 --> 49:21.320
how to be in meditation.

49:21.520 --> 49:24.520
So first you get the state of ‘thoughtless awareness’ -

49:24.720 --> 49:26.880
we call it as ‘Nirvichar Samadhi’.

49:27.080 --> 49:30.800
And then the state you get is called as ‘Nirvikalpa Samadhi’,

49:30.960 --> 49:34.040
where you get all the powers of raising others' ‘Kundalini’,

49:34.240 --> 49:36.960
giving them Realization, curing, everything.

49:37.200 --> 49:39.640
Those who have never come to the stage become orators.

49:39.840 --> 49:42.800
See these musicians singing Indian songs.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.880
Can you imagine this?

49:45.080 --> 49:48.080
I mean, English speaking people, so hard

49:48.280 --> 49:50.560
for Indian music, I tell you,

49:50.760 --> 49:53.080
especially for Indian words.

49:53.280 --> 49:54.800
But when they sing, ask Indians,

49:55.000 --> 49:57.640
they will tell you they sing like Indians...

49:57.840 --> 50:00.440
It was so difficult to teach even one word

50:00.640 --> 50:02.320
to the Englishmen in India -

50:02.520 --> 50:06.800
one word. And now you see this.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.440
What has happened to them?

50:08.640 --> 50:10.120
How suddenly they have picked up

50:10.320 --> 50:16.520
all the rhythm, all the thing, which is very difficult.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.560
So...

50:18.760 --> 50:20.800
all these powers which are within you,

50:20.960 --> 50:22.960
you have to manifest

50:23.160 --> 50:27.360
and enjoy your virtues, enjoy your virtues.

50:27.560 --> 50:31.320
You don’t become proud, but you enjoy them.

50:31.520 --> 50:33.560
You enjoy your generosity,

50:33.760 --> 50:35.680
enjoy your compassion,

50:35.880 --> 50:39.960
never feel that you are

50:40.200 --> 50:43.400
taking too much trouble, you are doing this and that, nothing.

50:43.600 --> 50:47.160
You think of others all the time and you live in peace

50:47.360 --> 50:49.440
and create peace all around.

50:49.640 --> 50:53.000
We have these people from sixty

50:53.200 --> 50:56.680
nations; they come to India once a year.

50:56.880 --> 51:01.200
I've never seen them quarrelling, fighting,

51:01.400 --> 51:05.840
doing anything against each other - never.

51:06.040 --> 51:10.040
How do they live from all different countries, from Chinese

51:10.240 --> 51:13.880
to Africans, from Africans to English

51:14.080 --> 51:18.200
and from English to Americans and Australians - so many?

51:18.400 --> 51:20.880
In Sydney we have twenty two centers.

51:21.080 --> 51:24.560
I must say Australia is one of our

51:24.760 --> 51:28.320
very great country which has really

51:28.520 --> 51:35.480
very enthusiastically has taken to Sahaja Yoga.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.600
And I am sure also you all will.

51:38.800 --> 51:42.280
We have a great story in our ‘Puranas’ about Australia

51:42.480 --> 51:44.840
which sometimes I'll tell you.

51:45.040 --> 51:47.080
So may God Bless you!

51:47.280 --> 51:52.600
And you be confident that you will have your Realization just now.

51:52.800 --> 51:57.280
You don’t have to do much - just it will take ten minutes more.

52:03.160 --> 52:06.320
But, of course, I respect your freedom.

52:06.520 --> 52:08.360
If you don’t want to have your Realization,

52:08.560 --> 52:11.480
you should leave the hall. I cannot force on you.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.960
It is something it cannot be forced.

52:14.160 --> 52:16.800
I respect your freedom out and out.

52:17.000 --> 52:20.200
So, if you want to go, you can go.

52:29.720 --> 52:34.120
All of you want Realization - it's very good.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.960
Now one thing that should not upset you,

52:40.160 --> 52:42.320
because I've seen people get upset if I tell them

52:42.520 --> 52:44.040
that you have to take out your shoes.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.480
I hope you won’t be upset with that.

52:53.040 --> 52:59.000
You need not take out your socks but your shoes.

52:59.200 --> 53:01.200
I does, sometimes.

53:16.120 --> 53:18.800
Don’t have to say any mantras, nothing,

53:19.040 --> 53:20.960
and you don’t have to concentrate also.

53:21.160 --> 53:24.440
Please don’t try to concentrate.

53:24.640 --> 53:27.800
Just keep yourself open.

53:27.960 --> 53:30.720
Don’t force yourself into anything.

53:30.920 --> 53:33.080
As I am saying, telling you that

53:33.280 --> 53:35.800
it has become so easy now -

53:36.000 --> 53:37.360
you don’t have to go to Himalayas

53:37.560 --> 53:39.960
and stand on your head or anything.

53:40.160 --> 53:42.400
You have to be very comfortable

53:42.600 --> 53:45.640
and also

53:45.840 --> 53:50.760
you should be very much pleasantly placed toward yourself.

53:50.960 --> 53:53.520
Because as I said, you are human beings,

53:53.720 --> 53:56.960
you are at the epitomy of evolution.

53:57.160 --> 54:01.880
And you are...  have a right to have this,

54:02.080 --> 54:07.240
because you are born at this time with a special purpose.

54:07.440 --> 54:09.600
So in no way you should condemn yourself.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.800
This is the first condition.

54:11.960 --> 54:16.680
Have full confidence.

54:16.880 --> 54:20.040
The another thing is you shouldn’t feel guilty at this time;

54:20.240 --> 54:22.600
please don’t feel guilty for anything.

54:22.800 --> 54:26.840
It has become a fashion now to feel guilty for anything.

54:27.040 --> 54:29.640
I mean, even, if supposing you spill some

54:29.840 --> 54:32.520
coffee you go on feeling guilty for your life.

54:32.720 --> 54:34.960
What's this going on?

54:35.160 --> 54:37.120
You must value yourself.

54:37.320 --> 54:39.360
This life is not meant

54:39.560 --> 54:42.880
for feeling bad for small, small things.

54:43.080 --> 54:47.160
It is very great, it’s very precious.

54:47.360 --> 54:48.920
So please don’t have any guilt.

54:49.120 --> 54:52.600
But if you have, then you catch on this center here.

54:52.800 --> 54:59.400
And this is such a dangerous thing because it gives you

54:59.600 --> 55:02.600
what we call as angina.

55:02.800 --> 55:07.840
It may give you spondylitis. It may give you very lethargic organs.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.480
So very dangerous is to feel guilt.

55:10.680 --> 55:12.800
So why feel guilty unnecessarily?

55:12.960 --> 55:16.520
I tell you if you were guilty, you would have been in jail.

55:16.720 --> 55:20.360
Now you are sitting here, so don’t feel guilty about

55:20.560 --> 55:22.320
anything whatsoever.

55:22.520 --> 55:26.640
I assure you, you are not guilty.

55:26.840 --> 55:34.120
So, you have to really forgive yourself.

55:34.320 --> 55:39.880
Now, the most simple condition is this

55:40.080 --> 55:44.360
that you have to forgive everyone.

55:44.560 --> 55:47.600
People might say it's very difficult to forgive.

55:47.800 --> 55:51.160
But, whether you forgive or not - I am telling the logic,

55:51.360 --> 55:54.600
now think about it - whether you forgive or not what do you do?

55:54.840 --> 55:57.280
I don’t do anything.

55:57.480 --> 56:01.520
But when you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

56:01.720 --> 56:06.440
Those who have troubled you, tortured you,

56:06.640 --> 56:08.000
are not feeling bad.

56:08.200 --> 56:11.960
But you are the one who is torturing yourself.

56:12.160 --> 56:15.760
But at this time, the problem is that this centre of Agnya

56:15.960 --> 56:21.080
which is like this, absolutely constructed like this, like a cross -

56:21.280 --> 56:23.560
it is on the optic chiasma -

56:23.760 --> 56:26.200
and if you don’t forgive, it won’t open at all.

56:26.400 --> 56:27.400
But if you forgive

56:27.600 --> 56:30.440
it will definitely open and the Kundalini will pass.

56:30.640 --> 56:33.960
So, at this juncture you as it is

56:34.200 --> 56:35.640
troubled yourself so much,

56:35.840 --> 56:37.880
at this juncture please,

56:38.080 --> 56:41.120
please forgive everyone in general.

56:41.320 --> 56:44.640
Don’t even think about them because it is a headache.

56:44.840 --> 56:47.680
It's a real headache even to think of these people.

56:47.880 --> 56:49.960
So you just forgive in general.

56:50.200 --> 56:54.320
Of course we'll tell you how to do it. It's very simple.

56:54.520 --> 56:58.120
Now to begin with you keep your eyes open,

56:58.320 --> 57:01.400
I'll show you how you have to

57:01.600 --> 57:08.040
yourself enrich your own centers - very simple.

57:08.240 --> 57:11.520
So please put your left hand towards Me like this comfortably.

57:11.720 --> 57:13.800
You have to be comfortable. That’s very important.

57:13.960 --> 57:15.920
Please both the feet apart from each other

57:16.120 --> 57:18.680
because these are two powers, left and right.

57:18.880 --> 57:22.880
Put your left hand towards Me on your lap,

57:23.080 --> 57:25.960
just like this.

57:26.200 --> 57:28.800
And now

57:28.960 --> 57:34.280
we have to use our left side with our right hand.

57:34.480 --> 57:39.920
Now please put your right hand on your heart.

57:40.120 --> 57:46.880
This is the center where the Spirit resides.

57:47.080 --> 57:48.680
If you become the Spirit,

57:48.880 --> 57:52.120
you become your own master in the light of the Spirit.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.640
So please take your right hand

57:54.880 --> 57:59.320
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the liver.

57:59.520 --> 58:05.840
All of you should do it, please.

58:06.040 --> 58:08.400
This is the center of your mastery

58:08.640 --> 58:11.960
which is created by great prophets

58:12.160 --> 58:18.240
and seers and sages.

58:18.440 --> 58:21.720
Surprisingly the center of pure knowledge

58:21.920 --> 58:25.280
is lower here on the left hand side

58:25.480 --> 58:31.240
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

58:31.440 --> 58:38.840
Whatever you have done, forget it, forget it.

58:39.040 --> 58:45.680
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

58:45.880 --> 58:52.040
Now on your heart.

58:52.240 --> 58:55.960
Now in the corner of your neck and shoulders.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.720
As I have already told you

58:57.920 --> 58:59.920
when this center catches what is the problem.

59:00.120 --> 59:06.440
Turn your head to your right, please.

59:06.640 --> 59:09.120
It’s very catching today.

59:09.320 --> 59:14.520
Please don’t feel guilty for anything. You must...

59:14.720 --> 59:19.760
There.

59:19.960 --> 59:23.360
Please take your right hand on top of your forehead across

59:23.560 --> 59:26.960
and bend your head slowly.

59:27.160 --> 59:31.440
We have to be humble about it, you see.

59:31.640 --> 59:38.320
So here you have to forgive everyone in general.

59:41.040 --> 59:46.120
Now take back your right hand on the backside of your head

59:46.320 --> 59:49.840
and push back your head as far as possible.

59:50.040 --> 59:54.880
Here,

59:55.080 --> 59:59.040
without counting your mistakes,

59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.680
without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction,

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.240
you will have to ask forgiveness

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:11.520
from this All Pervading Power.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:16.640
Now please stretch your hand or palm fully.

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.440
Now we go to the last center,

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.040
so please put the centre of your palm

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:25.360
on top of the fontanel bone area

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.400
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:35.160
Now please put down your head.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.120
Now push back your fingers nicely

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:42.320
so there's a good pressure on your scalp.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.360
Now put down your head and you have to move, move the scalp

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.080
seven times clockwise very slowly.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.200
That’s all we have to do actually.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.960
But remember you have to push back your fingers.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.160
Now you can take out your spectacles

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.240
because you have to close your eyes.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.320
It might help also your eyesight.

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:19.680
Please,

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.920
before closing I must tell you again

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.920
that please put both the

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.560
legs apart from each other

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.440
and the left hand

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:36.840
towards Me on your lap comfortably in any way that you like.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.840
And then now place your right hand on your heart.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.320
Here, I've told you resides the Spirit.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.400
You have to ask Me

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.880
a very fundamental question about yourself in your heart.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:02.400
So please,

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.440
ask in your heart, three times.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.480
You can call me ‘Mother’ or ‘Shri Mataji’ whatever you like.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.880
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.960
Ask this question three times in your heart.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.280
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.760
Now, I've told you if you become the ‘Spirit’,

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.480
you become your own master.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.680
So now take down your right hand

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.880
in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:44.840
on the left hand side.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.400
Here,

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.520
you have to ask another fundamental question.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:59.960
“Mother, am I my master?”

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:05.200
Ask this question three times.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.720
I have already told you

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.280
that I respect your freedom.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.640
And I cannot force

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:24.240
divine pure knowledge on you.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.920
So now

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.960
please take your right hand

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:33.040
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:40.160
Here,

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.600
you have to ask six times,

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.840
because this center has got six petals,

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:53.800
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge”,

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:59.320
or you can say, “Mother please give me divine pure knowledge”.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.920
Whatever is divine is pure.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.680
Six times.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.800
As soon as you start asking

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.080
for pure divine knowledge,

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.840
the ‘Kundalini’ starts rising like a primule.

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:23.160
Now we have to

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.840
open our higher centers

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.600
by our self-confidence,

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.240
for the Kundalini to pass through.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.680
Now, take your right hand -

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.080
you are working only on the left hand side -

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.360
in the upper portion

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:42.600
of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.280
Press it hard.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:52.440
Now, here with full confidence, please say ten times,

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.040
“Mother, I am my own master”.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:58.080
The Kundalini wants

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:01.960
you to show yourself confidence.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.960
Please say it ten times.

01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.760
At the very outset, I've told you

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:17.600
that the truth is that you are not this body,

01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:20.240
this mind, this ego, these feelings,

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.240
these emotions, these conditionings,

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:30.800
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.440
So, now raise your right hand on top of your heart.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:40.480
And here you have to say again with full self-confidence,

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:45.120
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.720
Please say it.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.160
Please say it twelve times,

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.520
“Mother I am the pure Spirit”.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.920
I have already told you

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.560
that this All Pervading Power

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.280
is the ocean of knowledge,

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.480
ocean of compassion,

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:16.080
ocean of blessings, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:20.160
And whatever mistakes you might have committed,

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:24.320
are easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.200
So forgive yourself.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.720
And put your right hand

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.480
in the corner of your neck and shoulder

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.560
and turn your head to your right.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.880
Here,

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.280
with full confidence again,

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.120
you have to say sixteen times,

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.800
“Mother, I am not guilty at all”,

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.440
“Mother I am not guilty at all”. Please say this.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.560
Is very important because this center

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.640
is catching very much tonight here.

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.760
Now I have told you

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.240
whether you forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.080
But if you don’t forgive,

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.560
then you play into wrong hands

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.120
and torture yourself.

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.920
Especially at this moment, you should forgive

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:25.960
all of them, without thinking about them, in general,

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.520
so that your center opens out.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:33.840
Otherwise at this important moment,

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.680
you may miss your Self Realization.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.360
It's very important

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.560
to forgive all of them from your heart.

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:46.000
Not how many times, it's not the point, from your heart.

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.840
So now please put your right hand

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.800
on you forehead across

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.080
and bend your head as much as you can.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.720
And here,

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.000
you have to say,

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:09.400
not how many times, but from your heart,

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:15.840
“Mother, I forgive everyone in general”,

01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.960
from your heart. Please say it from your heart.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.520
And now

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.040
please put your right hand on the back side of your head

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:46.800
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.160
Here, without feeling guilty,

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.120
without counting your mistakes,

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.200
just for your satisfaction,

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.480
you have to say,

01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.520
not how many times, but from your heart,

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.560
“Oh, Divine Power,

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.640
if I have done any mistake,

01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:11.720
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me”.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.920
Just say it from your heart.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.640
“O Divine Power,

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.480
if I have done anything wrong,

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.400
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me”.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:34.680
Now

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:38.760
please stretch your palms.

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.760
Put the center of your palm

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.200
on top of your fontanel bone area

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:48.520
which is a soft bone in your childhood.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.040
Here again,

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.320
I cannot force Self-Realization on you. You have to ask for it.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.280
So now push back your fingers - that's important -

01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.240
and please put down your head.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:03.400
Now move your scalp with this pressure,

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.280
seven times, saying

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.880
seven times,

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:12.920
“Mother, please give me my Self-Realization”,

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.640
because I cannot force it on you.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.800
Please push back your fingers.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.480
Bend your heads; please push back your fingers.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.000
Keep your eyes shut, till I tell you

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.480
please keep them shut.

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.160
Please take down your hands

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:12.000
and try to open your eyes slowly.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.440
Push both the hands towards Me.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.880
Now,

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.360
put the left hand towards Me like this,

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:30.200
bend your head and see with the right hand

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:36.480
if there is a cool or a warm breeze-like energy

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.960
is coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:43.920
Now don’t doubt, because air conditioning is not in your head.

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:48.560
So just see for yourself. Some people think it is air conditioning.

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.040
Some people get it hot.

01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:56.320
Some people get it far,

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.560
some closer,

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.800
but don’t put your hand on top of your head,

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.280
away from it.

01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:03.840
See for yourself,

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:07.240
and if it is hot, that means you have not yet forgiven.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:09.480
So please forgive also.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.120
Now,

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.280
please put your right hand. Now, bend your head nicely

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:17.120
and see for yourself with the left hand

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:23.320
if there's a cool or a hot breeze-like energy is coming

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:28.560
out of your fontanel bone area.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.640
You have to move your hand up and down, sideways also. All right.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.080
Now do it with the left hand again.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.640
Little further. Some people get it further.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:50.160
Bend your heads, that is important, bend your heads.

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:54.760
Now,

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.040
please put both your hands towards the sky.

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:01.080
Push back your head

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.040
and ask anyone of these three questions,

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:06.840
three times, anyone of them.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.960
You can say, ”Mother,

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.040
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”,

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:16.000
or ”Mother, is this the

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.920
All Pervading Power of Divine Love?”,

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.160
or ”Mother, is this the Ruh

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.560
or Paramchaitanya?”.

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.360
Ask anyone of these questions, three times.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.720
Now, just come down.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.680
Now please put your hands like this

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.120
and watch Me without thinking.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.840
Just watch Me without thinking.

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.680
All those who have felt

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.480
hot or cold breeze on their fingertips,

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:17.720
on their palms or out of their fontanel bone area,

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.080
please raise both your hands.

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:25.960
My God! Look at that.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.480
I mean most of you.

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:29.840
May God bless you!

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.520
It's tremendous.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:34.160
Some didn’t get it, very few,

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.840
but most of you have got it.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.960
In any case all of you should get it.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.200
And those who haven’t got

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.280
should please later on come to the stage and they will do it.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.760
But in the meanwhile

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.560
we'll try something else

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.440
for Realization

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:55.080
and maybe that might help a little bit.

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.960
[Marathi].

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.880
See this might help.

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:09.360
This will be only five minutes experiment. Let's see.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.280
Which song will you sing?

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.480
[Marathi].

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.560
[Marathi].

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.960
This is the song they are going to sing,

01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.120
was written - Namadeva -

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.760
by Namadeva in the sixteenth century

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.760
who went then to Punjab

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.760
and Guru Nanak Sahib, you see,

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.600
knew who he was and He asked him to write

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.120
poems in Punjabi language.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:45.000
And he has done such big compilation, I know that.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.480
This guru

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.960
was ...

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.240
he was just a tailor.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.520
And he went to see, meet

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:57.960
another realized soul who was a potter.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:04.320
And when he went and saw the potter kneading

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:11.920
the clay with his feet, he just stood there, watching him.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.880
The potter’s name was Gora Kumbhar.

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:19.120
Looked at him and what does he say,

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:22.880
in Marathi says that, but meaning

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.000
that, I came to see here

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.960
the "formless",

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.120
but it is "in the form".

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.120
I see it "in the form".

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:40.880
I mean only a saint can say it to another saint.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.440
That’s what happened

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.080
that he went up to Punjab

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:49.360
where Guru Nanak Sahib

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.560
called him, looked after him and asked him and they made beautiful,

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.040
I mean such beautiful songs there are and they are in Granth Sahib.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.800
They are all in Granth Sahib.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.680
[unclear].

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.320
This is the folk song

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:11.240
which was written, which says, “Oh, Mother, give me my Realization.

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.440
‘Jogwa’ means Yoga - "Please give me that".

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:15.960
All that they sang,

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.320
all the time they have been singing, even now,

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:20.360
but they don’t know what it is.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.280
And they are saying, "Oh, Ambe" - means the Kundalini -

01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.280
"please rise, rise".

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:29.280
And with you can also clap. It will help a lot, I am sure.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.000
This will definitely consolidate your Self-Realization.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.400
It is a village song. It’s a rustic...

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.160
Now you feel. Just try to feel now. Let's see.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.600
You must be feeling more, just see.

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.120
All right?

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.960
Now again, let us see how many of you have really

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.400
felt on your finger tips

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:47.160
or from your fontanel bone area or on your palms.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.400
Raise your both the hands.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.400
Oh! So, who didn’t feel before, have felt it - so many of you.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.960
Thank you very much. May God look after you.

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:03.600
And also have wisdom

01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:08.200
to respect your freedom,

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:14.560
respect your new status.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.880
The real freedom is now.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:22.280
So you respect your Self-Realization

01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:29.880
and become a fully self-realized personality.

01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.600
That will help everywhere.

01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:38.320
May God bless you all!

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.360
Thank you very much, it was wonderful.

01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:23.920
You all have paper to know where the centers are

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.840
and I hope...

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.720
What's it?

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.240
...and where you are going to have

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.000
a follow-on program.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.800
All right?

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.120
Please, please come.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:43.200
Do you know?

01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:45.520
What's it? They haven’t got paper already?

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:46.960
SY: They have, Shri Mataji.

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.200
SM: They all have?

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.040
Where are you having follow on?

01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:55.840
Yes, yes, but when are having the follow on, where?

01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:00.280
You don't know.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.680
SY: As you go on out

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:06.000
there are leaflets there which will tell you...

01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.240
all you need to know about follow-up programs.

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.080
Ah, we've got one here, finally.

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:17.960
There's a series of seven programs

01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.720
beginning on Monday 11th of April

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:25.360
then for six consecutive Thursdays commencing

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.600
Thursday 14th of April

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:30.680
at seven thirty to nine thirty

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:33.600
the [Far placed Room], Gorman House Art Center

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.720
Ainslie Avenue, Braddon.

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:41.000
And there's a little bracket here, and we will provide

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:44.000
light refreshments to follow.

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:50.480
Again remind you that all Sahaja Yoga programs

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:54.160
are completely free.

01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:59.320
There, if you have any questions you want to ask about that

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.440
there's two phone numbers here that

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:04.560
will tell you where to ring.

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.760
It really tells you everything you want to know

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.800
and you can pick up one of these up

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:10.080
as you go out the door.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.760
Now they've got a big supply there.

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.120
One other thing, if is anybody here

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:28.720
who - as soon as Shri Mataji's left -

01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:32.320
if there's anybody here who has not felt anything tonight,

01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:34.080
I would like to try.

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:38.120
There's probably a very good reasons, as we explained to you earlier.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:41.880
You have these centers - you can also have blocked centers -

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:45.520
they may be quite easily to clear, might be quite easy to clear and then

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:47.000
[unclear].

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:48.720
Before you leave here tonight

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:50.840
if are any of you didn't feel anything

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:54.960
we'll do our best to make sure you do.

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:57.600
Thank you.

01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:22.760
We're having first series of seven follow up programs

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:25.920
at Gorman House.
