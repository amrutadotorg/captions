1
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:11,351
But if your attention goes higher

2
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:16,111
– say [as] my attention is. I am only nothing but charity! I mean what am I?

3
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:23,231
It just flows. You just become the charity.

4
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:26,424
So the difference between

5
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:30,351
a person who is a realised and a not realised is this

6
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:38,751
that the attention which was giving myth as reality to you

7
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:41,351
is gone now, is gone higher.

8
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:44,151
It can see that it is myth.

9
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:47,791
Attention can clearly see that it is myth,

10
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:53,871
and you can see that yourself and you can remove yourself from them.

11
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:00,177
That, of course, I have to give you a push, no doubt,

12
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:02,528
and I am working hard on that to give you a push.

13
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,391
But you should also know that mythical things must be dropped out,

14
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:09,791
otherwise you will not grow.

15
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:13,591
All mythical things must be dropped out.

16
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:17,031
And the best way to do it is to be in thoughtless awareness

17
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:20,231
because as soon as you transcend these three gunas

18
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,791
you become thoughtlessly aware.

19
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:26,231
You have to cross Agya. Once you cross Agya, these three gunas,

20
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:30,271
absolutely you go into a state where you are gunateet,

21
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:33,311
you are beyond gunas.

22
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:38,871
So you do not deliberately do anything,

23
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:42,108
but it just works out.

24
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:45,827
So now for you, because you are enlightened now, is to understand

25
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:53,787
that our attention has to move higher and higher, at a higher space.

26
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:57,337
Now actually what has happened in Realisation?

27
00:01:57,457 --> 00:02:03,485
Your Kundalini has risen and has come up,

28
00:02:03,681 --> 00:02:11,980
just like, you can say, a small, thin hair, one hair,

29
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,744
and that has broken your Sahastrara

30
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:23,573
and now the grace is flowing into you.

31
00:02:24,407 --> 00:02:27,572
But it’s a very small movement that has taken place, of course

32
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:31,890
which is a very difficult movement no doubt, but it has taken place.

33
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:39,155
Now you have not expanded like this.

34
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:43,377
Your chakras are only pierced in the centre,

35
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:46,420
but the rest of the attention is still intact.

36
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,354
Actually it is so intact, that you don’t even feel that it is pierced.

37
00:02:52,474 --> 00:02:58,584
Now you have to expand that, open it out,

38
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:04,075
so that more strands of Kundalini can rise

39
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:12,671
and your attention, which is in these centers, expands.

40
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:18,772
By expansion it drives out all that is mythical on the sides.

41
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:24,653
On every centre we have our attention,

42
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:27,653
which is being enlightened in the centre

43
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:31,152
through this Light passing through.

44
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:36,514
But the Light is too small for the darkness that you have collected.

45
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:40,334
Specially for the people of the West, I would say,

46
00:03:40,454 --> 00:03:44,974
your confusions, you must get rid of them.

47
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:48,514
But still you identify.

48
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:51,351
Because if I ask you anything [like], “How are you?”

49
00:03:51,471 --> 00:03:53,581
Means what?

50
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:58,976
Means you are still confused.

51
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:00,739
Alright?

52
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,801
Confusion should go.

53
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:12,303
One confusion was there that, “This is Realisation or not?”

54
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:14,501
I hope that’s over now with you people.

55
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,478
At least now you believe it is Self-realisation.

56
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:20,862
I had to tell people, “No, you are self-realised now, you are!”

57
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:24,178
Still they would jump up like [a] jack-in-the-box, you see.

58
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,155
They’ll say, “No, we’re not Mother!

59
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,282
How do you say this is Realisation?”

60
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:32,860
“We expect this out of Realisation and that out of Realisation

61
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,700
– that we’ll be flying out of the door if we are Realised,”

62
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,620
or something nonsensical like that.

63
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,018
Thank God, these ideas have gone away.

64
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:45,738
But when we are Realised, there is Light that has come in us,

65
00:04:46,097 --> 00:04:50,083
we have to grow it only by separating our attention

66
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:52,356
from the myths.

67
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:56,772
It’s all mythical.

68
00:04:56,892 --> 00:04:58,457
I also play with you,

69
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:04,384
because unless and until you are sure,

70
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:11,598
I am not going to give you a wrong idea about yourself.

71
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:17,691
I want to see how far still your attention is moving,

72
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:22,371
and I know [that] still you are not sure,

73
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:26,505
still you are not sure of yourself,

74
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:34,861
that’s why the confidence is not there.

75
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:42,202
First of all you have to learn how to drive, then you are tested.

76
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:45,865
There will be five stones put together,

77
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:50,343
the distance will be only that hardly a car can pass through

78
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,316
and the fellow will say, “You bring it zigzag!”

79
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,437
And you cannot do it.

80
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:56,597
Why?

81
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,646
That’s how he makes you a master.

82
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:08,061
The mastery of your attention

83
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:14,436
will come when you will start seeing that it is all a myth that upsets you.

84
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,971
It’s all a myth that upsets you.

85
00:06:18,091 --> 00:06:20,682
Just throw it away.

86
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:26,122
Just throw it away and understand

87
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:31,206
that you are the eternal attention,

88
00:06:32,619 --> 00:06:37,149
that you are the eternal life,

89
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:43,658
that [the] only thing that keeps you away from it is ignorance,

90
00:06:44,444 --> 00:06:48,678
and the ignorance is too simple to understand:

91
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:53,182
that you have accepted myth as Truth.

92
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:57,749
Just drop it! It’s all myth!

93
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:04,033
You’ll be amazed how your attention will rise

94
00:07:05,156 --> 00:07:09,215
and you’ll see all these nonsensical things

95
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:12,795
which used to frighten you or to elate you,

96
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:17,355
will drop out, and you will just smile at it.

97
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:22,206
And then only you are going to enjoy yourself fully

98
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:24,541
because your attention

99
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:30,002
will be completely drenched into the bliss of Self.

100
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:37,387
I am saying you will, I say you are

101
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:43,156
already drenched into that bliss.

102
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:46,339
Keep it up.

103
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:50,338
Now, how to do it?

104
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:58,934
Actually, in every day-to-day life, how to kill the memory of the past?

105
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:08,055
To kill the memory of the past is to have new memories.

106
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:14,157
You must remember when you got your first Realisation

107
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:17,866
– always think of it.

108
00:08:17,986 --> 00:08:21,361
Whenever any such memory comes to you,

109
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:25,929
you [should] try to think how you got your Realisation.

110
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:32,043
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called elating,

111
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:40,343
you just try to remember how Realisation has come to you.

112
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:47,190
When you feel aggressive about something or angry [about] something,

113
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:53,326
just try to remember how you felt the joy of surrendering.

114
00:08:55,676 --> 00:09:02,010
Just think of that joy of surrendering, of dissolving yourself.

115
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:06,331
So the new memories must be built up.

116
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,341
If you start building up new memories,

117
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:13,896
then you will start collecting moments

118
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:23,618
to establish other moments which have such memories.

119
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:28,738
Like a memory when you tried to help somebody,

120
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:32,779
you raised the Kundalini of someone.

121
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:36,845
Now the problem would be when you will be raising the Kundalini of others,

122
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:40,106
you will be in thoughtless awareness – there won’t be any thought –

123
00:09:40,227 --> 00:09:43,684
and thought is the only thing which impresses.

124
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:51,097
But [at] that time you can record the joy of raising the Kundalini.

125
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:58,114
If you could record the joy of raising the Kundalini of others,

126
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:07,458
you will feel [that] a new wealth

127
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:12,884
of these beautiful moments will be accumulated.

128
00:10:13,004 --> 00:10:19,230
And all those moments which were giving you confusion

129
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,124
or fear or so-called unhappiness and happiness will drop out

130
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:28,128
and pure joy will remain.

131
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:34,627
Because now most of the experiences you have had are more of joy.

132
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:38,447
Joy has no thoughts.

133
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:44,073
It’s just an experience, a pratyaksha.

134
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:49,532
That’s why I said you keep your eyes open.

135
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:56,239
I hope you will understand what I mean by that.

136
00:10:57,970 --> 00:10:59,787
May God bless you all.
