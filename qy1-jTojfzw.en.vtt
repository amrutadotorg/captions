00:00:01.145 --> 00:00:03.670
Welcome to a wonderful Spiritual journey

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.710
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.230
Today we are going to talk about the energy

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.106
that exists within all of us

00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:14.430
and which is called as Kundalini.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.230
At the end of this program

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.675
we will have an opportunity to activate this energy

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:22.904
and feel this unique experience.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.150
Here is a beautiful story

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.630
coming from the depths of the ages.

00:00:27.754 --> 00:00:30.877
One day God asked the angels :

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:33.674
« Where should I hide the secret of life ? »

00:00:33.794 --> 00:00:36.830
They said : « In the depths of the earth ? »

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.990
« No ! » He answered to them.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.590
« This is the first place they would look. »

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.799
« Deep inside the ocean ? »

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:45.950
« It will take them a little more time,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.976
but they will get there too. »

00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:50.412
« At the top of the highest mountain ? »

00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:53.435
« They will always try to climb up there

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:56.484
and reach the top at the end »

00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:58.310
« In the faraway stars ? »

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.630
« They will always long to reach the stars

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.630
and at the end they will reach there too. »

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.150
The angels became silent without knowing what to say.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.561
« I know where.... » God said.

00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:15.257
« I'll hide it somewhere that they will never think to search.

00:01:15.377 --> 00:01:18.228
I will hide it inside them! »

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:21.545
And so it happened this way.

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:25.750
So far human beings have been seeking so hard

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.219
to know the secret of life in different ways,

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:32.359
but they never looked inside them.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.779
Where is the secret of life hidden ?

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.710
Can it be hidden inside us ?

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.268
Above the coccyx at the base of the spine

00:01:41.388 --> 00:01:44.830
there is a triangular bone which is called as 'Sacrum',

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.790
meaning sacred bone.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.270
The five vertebrate that make up the Sacrum

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.430
are separate when we are born.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.328
Gradually they unite and by the age of 20

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:58.756
they become a compact bone.

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:01.556
Why is this part of the body called sacred ?

00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:04.870
This has been a mystery for ages.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.538
The ancient Greeks knew about it.

00:02:07.658 --> 00:02:11.944
Around 440 BC there exists a written account

00:02:12.064 --> 00:02:16.555
where Hippocrates refers to this bone as « iero ostoun »

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:18.842
or sacred bone.

00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:22.731
In Egypt, the sacrum is dedicated to Osiris,

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:29.044
the God which grants eternal life and allows sprouting of vegetation.

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:31.968
Later on, the Romans adopted this term

00:02:32.088 --> 00:02:34.230
and called it as « Os Sacrum »

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.711
which is the medical term which is used even today.

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:41.656
In Hebrew it is called as « Halaya »

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:45.229
which means the connecting link of the spinal cord.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.787
It is derived from the word « Yehov » Which means God Yehova.

00:02:49.907 --> 00:02:51.948
According to the Jewish tradition,

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:55.715
after death even though the rest of the body decomposes

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:58.228
this bone will remains intact

00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:02.350
and will become the starting point for the revival.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.879
 In the Bible this bone is mentioned as the last bone of the body

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:11.706
that decomposes, thus useful for the resurrection of Human beings.

00:03:11.826 --> 00:03:15.016
We can find the following in the book of psalms :

00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:20.060
« It watches all the bones, one of them will not break. »

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.308
The Arabs believed that this is the first bone

00:03:23.428 --> 00:03:27.310
that is formed in the body and the last bone to be destroyed.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.550
It is called as « El Ajb »

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.705
and is the seed from which the entire body can revive.

00:03:34.825 --> 00:03:36.190
The Prophet says :

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.830
« Everything will be perished from this human body

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.270
except the coccyx

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.266
and from this bone Allah will recreate the body ! »

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:48.804
We see that the idea of resurrection exists in different traditions

00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:52.463
and civilizations all over the world.

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:55.746
Now the time has come to solve this mystery.

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:58.548
What makes this part of the body sacred

00:03:58.668 --> 00:04:01.399
it is the existance of this energy within it

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.306
which is called as Kundalini.

00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:06.870
You can see the position of this Kundalini

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.424
in this chart of the subtle system.

00:04:09.544 --> 00:04:13.030
The word Kundalini is named after its shape.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.870
Kundal in Sanskrit means spiral.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.777
Kundalini is coiled three and a half times in the sacrum bone.

00:04:19.897 --> 00:04:22.762
This Kundalini can never be destroyed.

00:04:22.882 --> 00:04:26.676
It resides within us patiently in a dormant state

00:04:26.796 --> 00:04:29.477
until we reach a level of spiritual maturity

00:04:29.597 --> 00:04:34.310
and deep longing which allows her to be awakened.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.710
This Kundalini is the reflection of the primordial energy within us.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.470
She is our spiritual Mother

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.810
and as a Mother she can never harm her children.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.030
The Kundalini is the purest form of energy.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.884
She resides in the triangular bone at the base of our spine.

00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:54.190
Anything contrary to this fact is false.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.572
Another mystery is the existence of the spiral

00:04:57.692 --> 00:04:59.891
in different forms in the nature.

00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:02.625
The spiral is quite common in nature

00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:05.689
because the Kundalini is spiral in shape

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:09.500
and it is always identified with the process of evolution

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.070
wherever it takes place.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.826
We can find single, double or multiple spirals

00:05:15.946 --> 00:05:18.212
 in every dimension of the universe.

00:05:18.332 --> 00:05:22.656
To name a few, the spiral shape can be found in the microcosm,

00:05:22.776 --> 00:05:26.190
small nautilus, ammonities, and sea shells,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.338
in the growth of the plants, in the shape of the flowers.

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:33.964
The proportions of the Human Body are structured on this base

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:37.452
and the double spirals of the DNA.

00:05:37.572 --> 00:05:41.954
In a bigger scale we can find spiral formations in Cyclones

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:45.279
and in huge Geological phenomena.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:49.512
In the Macrocosm, we see the formation of the spiral galaxies

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:52.683
from billions of stars as we can see them

00:05:52.803 --> 00:05:54.390
from modern telescopes.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.986
The planets have a spiral orbit around their axis

00:05:58.106 --> 00:06:00.457
and around the sun.

00:06:00.577 --> 00:06:03.150
Jung says that the spiral images

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.839
are the archetypical structures of the universe

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:10.838
as they have been registered in the human collective unconscious.

00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:13.669
The Kundalini energy, when awakened,

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.950
unites the matter with the spirit.

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.670
It is the flow of eternity in our perishable body.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.910
It is the hope of renaissance and that is why

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:28.190
we find the spiral forms everywhere as they are her symbol.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.480
The spiral motif is widespread in every corner of our planet

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.389
since the beginning of time.

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:39.349
We can also find the spiral motives in Africa,

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.664
China,

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.476
Japan

00:06:49.867 --> 00:06:52.266
and Asia.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.790
The spiral symbolizes the eternal cycle of life and death.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.987
It extends at the infinite,

00:07:01.107 --> 00:07:04.317
the infinite rebirth that can be conquered

00:07:04.437 --> 00:07:06.287
only through the Mother.

00:07:06.407 --> 00:07:08.030
Where Mother is worshipped

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.134
we always find a symbol of hope for an eternal life.

00:07:13.254 --> 00:07:17.390
That is why they have carved this symbol on graves like this,

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.511
which we can see at Newgrange in Ireland.

00:07:21.631 --> 00:07:25.350
In America, we can find spiral carvings on rocks,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.710
in sacred and important places.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.892
In Latin America and the Pre-Columbian Art,

00:07:32.012 --> 00:07:36.307
we can find a lot of jewelry pieces with this motive.

00:07:36.427 --> 00:07:40.734
In Greece the spiral motif   appears at Neolithic years.

00:07:40.854 --> 00:07:45.070
The ceramic was from Dimini dates back to 5000 B.C.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:49.764
It shows clearly the spiral placed in the center of a triangle

00:07:49.884 --> 00:07:52.735
like the Kundalini in the triangular bone.

00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:55.950
One of the most famous and mysterious findings

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.030
is the disc of Phiastos around 1700 B.C.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.855
that shows the spirals coiled three and a half times.

00:08:03.975 --> 00:08:06.802
The spiral form reaches its perfection

00:08:06.922 --> 00:08:09.074
during the Greek classic Antiquity

00:08:09.194 --> 00:08:12.327
with the elegant Ionic capital.

00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:15.230
This unique energy that exists within us

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.276
is waiting for her awakening.

00:08:19.396 --> 00:08:21.070
When she awakens,

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:26.870
she rises in the central channel of our subtle system.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.790
Our subtle system has three channels

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.270
and seven energy centers, or chakras.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.588
When the Kundalini gets awakened,

00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:38.030
she rises through our central channel,

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.110
which runs along our spine,

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.839
and finds her way out from the top of the head.

00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:47.333
When this happens, she gives us “Yoga”

00:08:47.453 --> 00:08:52.030
which means union, the union of the man with the spirit,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.697
the union of the matter with the spirit.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:58.510
All the religious traditions

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.711
have mentioned about the union with the divine

00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.467
through the awakening of this sacred energy.

00:09:04.587 --> 00:09:07.510
Once we achieve this union with the divine,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.988
it can be felt as a cool breeze on our palms,

00:09:11.108 --> 00:09:13.614
which is also called as “vibrations”,

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:16.983
but nobody knew how to awaken this energy,

00:09:17.103 --> 00:09:19.756
that is why this knowledge was kept secret

00:09:19.876 --> 00:09:22.470
and was depicted in a symbolic way.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.750
When the Kundalini is awakened,

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.697
we can feel a cool breeze on our hands

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:29.449
and on top of the head,

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.673
which is also called as “cool vibrations”.

00:09:32.793 --> 00:09:37.418
This is the proof that the Kundalini has been awakened.

00:09:37.538 --> 00:09:39.990
The myth of the birth of Goddess Athena

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:42.750
is a good example of a symbolic myth

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.938
that hides the truth of the Primordial energy.

00:09:46.058 --> 00:09:48.110
According to Greek mythology,

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.121
Athena came out of from the head of her father,

00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:55.980
fully armed and gifted with wisdom, innocence and justice.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.950
She gives to people all the good qualities and virtues.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.102
She guides and protects them.

00:10:03.222 --> 00:10:05.670
She has all the attributes of the Kundalini

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.510
and she rises exactly in the same way

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.390
in the central channel of her Father Zeus

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.870
and pierces the top of his head with her spear.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.319
The name “Athena” is derived from the Sanskrit word Atha,

00:10:20.439 --> 00:10:22.431
which means Primordial.

00:10:22.551 --> 00:10:25.522
She is known in India as “Adi Shakti”,

00:10:25.642 --> 00:10:29.170
who is the source and the form of the primordial energy.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.588
The Kundalini, which exists in every Human being,

00:10:32.708 --> 00:10:37.390
is the reflection of this primordial energy within us.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:41.340
On the helmet of Godess Athena, there are three horses

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.310
that symbolize the three energy channels of our subtle system

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.500
and on her chest there are snakes which symbolize Kundalini.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:54.263
The rising of Kundalini has been a well-guarded secret.

00:10:54.383 --> 00:10:57.659
Very few masters knew how to awaken her

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:00.630
and they would accept only a few disciples

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.497
who had to pass through very rigorous training.

00:11:03.617 --> 00:11:06.910
In some cases this training would last life long

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.860
and they would still be unable to raise their Kundalini

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.270
during their life time.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:16.154
But today, for the first time in the History of humanity,

00:11:16.274 --> 00:11:20.947
the awakening of the Kundalini can be done en masse.

00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:23.225
During the year of 1970,

00:11:23.345 --> 00:11:27.073
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi who is the founder of Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:27.193 --> 00:11:29.396
established this unique method

00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:31.996
through which thousands of people have managed

00:11:32.116 --> 00:11:34.710
to get the awakening of their Kundalini,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.363
the precious gift of self-realization.

00:11:38.483 --> 00:11:42.143
Shri Mataji travelled all around the world, tirelessly,

00:11:42.263 --> 00:11:44.311
for the spreading of Sahaja Yoga

00:11:44.431 --> 00:11:48.590
for the emancipation and the spiritual evolution of the humanity.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.567
She never accepted any money for her work.

00:11:51.687 --> 00:11:56.392
Shri Mataji says that spirituality cannot be sold or purchased.

00:11:56.512 --> 00:11:58.710
It is the right of every human being

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.951
and one deserves to have it

00:12:01.071 --> 00:12:05.346
and the time has arrived for all of us to accept it.

00:12:05.466 --> 00:12:09.190
We will now do the exercise for the awakening of Kundalini.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.656
The only thing that one should have

00:12:11.752 --> 00:12:15.552
is the desire for spiritual evolution.
