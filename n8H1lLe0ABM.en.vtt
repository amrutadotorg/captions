00:07.340 --> 00:11.199
So I have to tell you, that you might be
the highest of highest,

00:11.345 --> 00:15.625
first thing [that] you have to give Me today
is that in your talk,

00:15.826 --> 00:22.335
in your behaviour, in your heart,
you will reside one with Love.

00:22.536 --> 00:26.952
And the second thing I want to ask is that
you should be peaceful people.

00:27.161 --> 00:30.684
Try to have peace with yourself.
Don’t fight with yourself.

00:30.885 --> 00:35.164
Now, the western people have one problem:
they fight with themselves.

00:35.365 --> 00:38.602
“How is it this is happening to me?
I am so bad. I am no good.

00:38.803 --> 00:40.333
I have done this. I am so bad.”

00:40.534 --> 00:43.901
If you go on fighting with yourself,
then you will become week.

00:43.982 --> 00:47.087
On the contrary, you must say,
“I am so good. What’s wrong with me?

00:47.168 --> 00:49.601
I’ve got realization.
What’s wrong with me?

00:49.682 --> 00:52.364
Have that confidence in oneself,
and then it will work out.

00:52.445 --> 00:55.760
And as result of that only
you start shouting at others.

00:55.961 --> 00:58.170
But supposing you understand

00:58.371 --> 01:01.347
that there is nothing wrong with you,
you have to be peaceful.

01:01.548 --> 01:04.532
We all have to be very peaceful people
and you have seen,

01:04.733 --> 01:08.687
My peaceful nature has solved
so many problems just like that.

01:08.888 --> 01:14.480
So try to achieve that peace within you.
That peace should not be lost at any cost,

01:14.681 --> 01:18.998
and should not be also expressed outside
in a way, like I sometimes.

01:19.199 --> 01:23.019
My peace itself becomes terrible.

01:23.220 --> 01:26.809
But you don’t have that kind of a possibility,
so you just don’t do it.

01:27.010 --> 01:29.663
You just don’t do it, never do it that way.

01:29.864 --> 01:35.524
Try to be extremely peaceful,
try to make your forehead relaxed.

01:35.725 --> 01:38.291
Many people come to Me
with [face] like this, you see,

01:38.492 --> 01:41.557
then I just know that there is
a big bhoot on the head sitting;

01:41.758 --> 01:43.738
then I shout at them.

01:43.939 --> 01:46.728
Keep your forehead relaxed, relaxed.

01:46.929 --> 01:50.596
“I am not doing anything, Mother is doing everything.
Relax, relax, relax.”

01:50.797 --> 01:56.334
If you relax, you’ll find
that your heart will open.

01:56.535 --> 01:59.902
“My heart cannot open.”
Why, why can’t you open your heart?

02:00.103 --> 02:03.517
Because you have no trust in yourself.

02:03.718 --> 02:08.149
Try to trust yourself, open your Agnya,
open your Ekadasha

02:08.350 --> 02:14.104
and your Sahasrara, and your heart will open.
Once your Sahasrara is open,

02:14.305 --> 02:18.366
your heart will open automatically,
so you will have a peaceful life.

02:18.567 --> 02:21.291
So today I am asking for two things from you.

02:21.492 --> 02:24.728
It's a funny thing that a Mother
has to ask for a gift.

02:24.905 --> 02:29.267
And the gift you have to give - first one -
is that you should be peaceful people.

02:29.468 --> 02:34.470
You should express peacefulness
through your own character, talking.

02:34.671 --> 02:39.133
But it doesn't mean that you should be
people who are bleak,

02:39.334 --> 02:45.865
or who are - we can say that -
are morbid people

02:46.066 --> 02:50.527
or people who tolerate nonsense.
No, there is a way of resistance.

02:50.728 --> 02:54.526
But a resistance, of a peaceful resistance,
that you are not afraid of anything;

02:54.607 --> 02:58.148
you are not frightened of anything;
you are not going to bow down to anything;

02:58.229 --> 03:01.998
you are not going to compromise with anything,
but you are peaceful.

03:02.199 --> 03:05.783
That sort of a temperament you must develop

03:05.984 --> 03:08.473
and also express outside, is very important.
