1
00:00:00,062 --> 00:00:01,190
Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,561
Today we are going to have a  puja of Fatimabi,

3
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:11,086
who was the symbol of Gruhalakshmi,

4
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:14,828
and so we are going to have the puja

5
00:00:15,476 --> 00:00:18,459
of the Gruhalakshmi principle within us.

6
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:24,798
As the housewife has to finish every work,

7
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:28,803
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

8
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,403
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

9
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:36,701
and then I could come for your puja,

10
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,848
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

11
00:00:40,303 --> 00:00:43,747
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

12
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:52,042
Now, the principle of Gruhalakshmi

13
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:58,113
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

14
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,830
it’s not a human being’s creation

15
00:01:04,987 --> 00:01:08,449
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

16
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:17,687
The Gruhalakshmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

17
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,288
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

18
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:29,150
Now She is always born in a relationship

19
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:38,816
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

20
00:01:39,585 --> 00:01:42,786
So She comes as sister or

21
00:01:43,044 --> 00:01:46,202
She comes as a daughter.

22
00:01:49,669 --> 00:01:52,311
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

23
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:57,197
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

24
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,870
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

25
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,210
the religion into their hands

26
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:12,040
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

27
00:02:13,564 --> 00:02:16,251
The attention was not paid so much

28
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:19,555
towards the ascent of the person.

29
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:24,901
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

30
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:27,544
And He is the only one -

31
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:31,830
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

32
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:36,098
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

33
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:38,415
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

34
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:43,714
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
 [brother of Jnaneshwara],

35
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:47,206
which, you can go to Pune,

36
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:49,269
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

37
00:03:23,348 --> 00:03:27,736
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

38
00:03:28,734 --> 00:03:33,767
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

39
00:03:37,323 --> 00:03:41,721
She stayed in her house, in her household

40
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:46,282
and She observed what you call

41
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:50,665
a kind of a panda
 [? Pata: veil]

42
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:55,653
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

43
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:59,657
It is a symbol that a woman

44
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:05,518
who is a housewife has to

45
00:04:09,563 --> 00:04:16,418
save her chastity by covering her face because

46
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,103
She was a beautiful woman and

47
00:04:21,559 --> 00:04:27,787
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

48
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,729
and She would have been definitely attacked

49
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,264
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

50
00:04:36,757 --> 00:04:39,380
As you know, in the time of Christ,

51
00:04:40,126 --> 00:04:43,978
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

52
00:04:44,328 --> 00:04:47,570
had to be very, very potential personality

53
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:52,122
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

54
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,487
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

55
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:05,303
so She allowed her sons

56
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,442
or actually ordered them

57
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:11,955
to fight those fanatics

58
00:05:12,628 --> 00:05:17,890
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

59
00:05:19,442 --> 00:05:22,966
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

60
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:26,668
It’s a very beautiful thing how

61
00:05:27,635 --> 00:05:30,174
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

62
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:34,288
took a form of Vishnumaya

63
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:43,700
just to establish the beautiful principle of

64
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,399
a housewife.

65
00:05:52,483 --> 00:05:55,379
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

66
00:05:56,234 --> 00:05:59,186
and She knew that her children will be killed.

67
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:04,598
But these people are never killed,

68
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:08,013
they never die nor do they suffer.

69
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:11,675
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

70
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:15,797
As a result of that,

71
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:23,289
another system started where they respected saints;

72
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:29,470
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

73
00:06:29,982 --> 00:06:32,206
or we can call them the people

74
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:35,351
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

75
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:39,775
Then we have got “Chisti”.

76
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:46,029
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

77
00:06:46,452 --> 00:06:49,985
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

78
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,720
But still they could not transcend

79
00:06:55,143 --> 00:07:01,442
the limits of religiosity.

80
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,209
So they also became extremely fanatic.

81
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:12,031
Firstly they would not see to

82
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:16,250
another religion where they had saints.

83
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:20,661
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

84
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:27,611
and even when we had a great saint

85
00:07:28,275 --> 00:07:33,371
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

86
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:40,310
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

87
00:07:40,533 --> 00:07:44,709
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

88
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:50,651
We did not deny,

89
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:53,426
as far as Hindus were concerned,

90
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:59,256
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

91
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:03,721
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

92
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,914
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

93
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:12,834
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

94
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:16,767
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

95
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:19,452
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

96
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:23,203
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

97
00:08:24,127 --> 00:08:30,444
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

98
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:35,461
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

99
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,783
So they could not get out of it.

100
00:08:38,045 --> 00:08:41,223
So we have another one called Haji Malang

101
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:44,971
who was worshipped by Hindus.

102
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:48,610
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

103
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:53,728
This Haji Malang

104
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:58,992
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

105
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:03,410
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

106
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,969
just to counter balance.

107
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,225
They did all kinds of things.

108
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:11,268
There are many saints like that.

109
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:18,377
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

110
00:09:18,989 --> 00:09:24,606
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

111
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,217
of that place, which was very bad. Even

112
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:32,370
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

113
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:35,024
They all make an earnings,

114
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,621
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

115
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:45,766
So this saint died and was buried there.

116
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:48,421
There were many people who were depending on it.

117
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:52,072
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

118
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:55,242
 'What is your religion?'

119
00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,644
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

120
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:01,249
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

121
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,133
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

122
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:09,362
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

123
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:11,465
They have no religions.

124
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:17,540
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

125
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:21,404
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

126
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:24,934
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

127
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,722
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

128
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,441
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

129
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:34,206
that they made a fanatic group.

130
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:39,391
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

131
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,637
against your innate religion within your-self

132
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:46,494
because it creates poison.

133
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:50,373
It's a venomous thing.

134
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:53,796
It makes you hate others.

135
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,865
When you start hating others,

136
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,915
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

137
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:05,651
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

138
00:11:09,594 --> 00:11:11,707
Hating any one

139
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,900
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

140
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:19,402
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

141
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:22,225
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

142
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:24,886
They bite some one because that is their nature.

143
00:11:25,127 --> 00:11:27,660
They cut some one because that's their nature.

144
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:29,884
They never hate someone.

145
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,832
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

146
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:39,202
is a speciality of human conception

147
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,912
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

148
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:48,261
And this horrible thing hatred

149
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:53,438
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

150
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:58,357
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

151
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,680
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

152
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:06,151
in every religion.

153
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:10,538
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

154
00:12:10,714 --> 00:12:16,517
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

155
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:22,600
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

156
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:28,440
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

157
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:33,119
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

158
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,502
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

159
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:44,335
to overcome that hatred,

160
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:49,753
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

161
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,710
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

162
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:58,094
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

163
00:12:58,972 --> 00:13:04,323
How? In the family when you have a household,

164
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:13,635
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

165
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:20,587
between the children, between the husband and the children.

166
00:13:21,187 --> 00:13:25,831
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

167
00:13:26,517 --> 00:13:29,416
then how can she subdue it?

168
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:34,634
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

169
00:13:34,906 --> 00:13:37,836
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

170
00:13:38,013 --> 00:13:40,870
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

171
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,536
But the housewife's job is to smooth

172
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:54,918
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

173
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:01,505
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

174
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:05,396
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

175
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:08,860
'wherever the housewife is respected,

176
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,436
there only the Gods reside'.

177
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:19,482
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

178
00:14:20,638 --> 00:14:22,908
because we are no good for economics,

179
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,934
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

180
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:27,739
Men folk are useless,

181
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:30,685
they don't know any household work or anything,

182
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:34,241
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

183
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:36,914
 is maintained by the women of the household.

184
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:44,087
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

185
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:49,626
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

186
00:14:49,793 --> 00:14:53,121
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

187
00:14:54,658 --> 00:14:59,042
It's like the preservation of that

188
00:15:02,046 --> 00:15:05,864
principle of a housewife.

189
00:15:08,055 --> 00:15:11,030
But some men, I mean many of them,

190
00:15:11,437 --> 00:15:15,701
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

191
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:20,102
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

192
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:24,710
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

193
00:15:26,756 --> 00:15:28,971
 But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

194
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:30,910
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

195
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:35,047
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

196
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:40,148
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

197
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:43,279
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

198
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:48,538
 [you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

199
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:52,827
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

200
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:55,219
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

201
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:57,644
they have no love or respect for each other

202
00:15:57,954 --> 00:16:00,718
but they have an awe or fear.

203
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:04,572
And they are afraid of such a woman.

204
00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:09,725
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
 the husbands are better controlled.

205
00:16:11,728 --> 00:16:15,145
But their basic principle they lose.

206
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:18,632
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

207
00:16:21,144 --> 00:16:23,527
and they land up in difficulties.

208
00:16:24,936 --> 00:16:28,398
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

209
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:30,971
 is to respect her chastity,

210
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:37,375
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

211
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:41,119
That is the steadiness of her.

212
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,254
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

213
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:49,705
If the wife is docile or obedient,

214
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:55,682
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
 Alright!

215
00:16:57,631 --> 00:17:01,631
 But this woman, the housewife,

216
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:06,430
has to know that she is not docile.

217
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:12,039
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

218
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,070
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

219
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,385
If the husband is stupid, alright,

220
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:25,046
he's stupid like a child, finished!

221
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:28,709
But the husband has to know that he must

222
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:31,965
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

223
00:17:33,042 --> 00:17:35,046
he's good for nothing.

224
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,824
First thing is that he must see

225
00:17:40,055 --> 00:17:44,732
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

226
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:47,475
Then the blessings flow.

227
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:53,273
But in no way he should insult her

228
00:17:53,729 --> 00:17:56,703
 or be unkind to her

229
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,181
 and raise his voice or say things to her.

230
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:05,771
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

231
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,283
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

232
00:18:09,406 --> 00:18:12,902
 give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

233
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,403
She has not to be dominating,

234
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,667
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

235
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:23,792
She is the source of peace,

236
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:28,091
she is the source of joy

237
00:18:28,481 --> 00:18:30,911
and she is the peacemaker.

238
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,572
If she is the one who creates problems,

239
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,917
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

240
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:44,552
 So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

241
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,485
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

242
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:54,983
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

243
00:18:55,213 --> 00:18:59,089
your left Nabhi can never improve.

244
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,788
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

245
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:10,840
 Now in the west the problem with women

246
00:19:10,956 --> 00:19:15,281
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

247
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:23,672
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

248
00:19:24,672 --> 00:19:29,272
 They do not feel their dignity
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

249
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:32,150
They are the queen of the house

250
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:36,058
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

251
00:19:36,344 --> 00:19:38,344
young frivolous girl.

252
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:43,136
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

253
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:47,364
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

254
00:19:48,365 --> 00:19:52,338
that, does not behove a housewife.

255
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:55,182
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

256
00:19:55,682 --> 00:19:59,384
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

257
00:19:59,552 --> 00:20:01,562
and when they have to fight.

258
00:20:02,882 --> 00:20:06,083
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

259
00:20:06,234 --> 00:20:10,316
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
 that's the limit!

260
00:20:14,055 --> 00:20:17,618
 They start always comparing themselves

261
00:20:18,158 --> 00:20:20,242
with the husband, to begin with.

262
00:20:20,663 --> 00:20:25,014
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

263
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:28,699
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

264
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,244
low family he has no money,

265
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:33,889
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

266
00:20:34,374 --> 00:20:36,870
 Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

267
00:20:37,577 --> 00:20:40,928
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

268
00:20:43,132 --> 00:20:48,023
Also in her own ways

269
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:50,137
she will feel guilty,

270
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:54,394
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

271
00:20:54,649 --> 00:20:58,540
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

272
00:20:59,944 --> 00:21:06,264
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

273
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:10,942
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

274
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:15,268
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

275
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:18,784
by your strength, by everything

276
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,244
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

277
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:31,759
by dominating others, by strangling others,

278
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:36,351
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

279
00:21:39,804 --> 00:21:42,216
frog in the well.

280
00:21:43,327 --> 00:21:47,199
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

281
00:21:47,263 --> 00:21:48,906
Lets have our house separately,

282
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,099
nobody should come in the house'.
 Even a rat won't enter that house.

283
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:59,231
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

284
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:04,937
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

285
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:08,497
is the negative form of understanding.

286
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:12,858
These are absolutely absurd things,

287
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,550
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

288
00:22:19,712 --> 00:22:22,015
 All this kind of selfishness,

289
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:27,073
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

290
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:32,429
But a thing of a housewife is,

291
00:22:32,572 --> 00:22:36,058
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

292
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,103
 For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

293
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,724
 So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

294
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:45,184
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

295
00:22:45,664 --> 00:22:48,184
 'But may be they would like to eat more.'

296
00:22:48,772 --> 00:22:51,021
 'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

297
00:22:51,624 --> 00:22:54,007
 'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

298
00:22:54,563 --> 00:22:58,060
So she thinks of her generosity.

299
00:22:58,354 --> 00:23:00,038
She enjoys her generosity.

300
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:02,189
I have known many like that.

301
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:05,228
 Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

302
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:09,772
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

303
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:11,748
 will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

304
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,026
 you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

305
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:16,943
 No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

306
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:19,122
Then she just start thinking immediately.

307
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:22,181
'What vegetables are available in the market?

308
00:23:22,483 --> 00:23:24,588
What should I get? What is the best?'

309
00:23:24,747 --> 00:23:29,595
 I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

310
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,016
I am just a relation,

311
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:35,996
but they want to express their love through the food,

312
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:41,048
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

313
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:44,966
and this is one of  the quality,

314
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,466
 the generosity for woman doesn't have

315
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:51,066
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

316
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,327
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

317
00:23:58,832 --> 00:24:01,175
but wife has to be very generous

318
00:24:01,318 --> 00:24:03,984
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

319
00:24:05,188 --> 00:24:08,466
not to her own children but to others.

320
00:24:10,455 --> 00:24:14,791
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

321
00:24:16,047 --> 00:24:18,780
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

322
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:23,672
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

323
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:29,377
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

324
00:24:30,037 --> 00:24:34,724
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

325
00:24:38,073 --> 00:24:41,454
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

326
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:46,196
 but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

327
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:51,711
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

328
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:55,232
about your own understanding.

329
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:57,971
You are not aware of yourself.

330
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:03,730
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

331
00:25:04,235 --> 00:25:08,076
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

332
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:13,750
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

333
00:25:13,893 --> 00:25:15,615
  Alright, leave it for a while.

334
00:25:15,792 --> 00:25:17,979
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

335
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:20,900
 'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

336
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:25,669
The women must understand the men.

337
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:29,734
 They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

338
00:25:31,065 --> 00:25:33,533
They see everything in a big way, you see.

339
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:38,060
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

340
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,006
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

341
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,966
They are too above these things.

342
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:47,253
They are above these things. You must understand that!

343
00:25:48,854 --> 00:25:53,132
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse
and fall down.

344
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:56,715
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

345
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,870
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

346
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:04,923
It is coming to that point.

347
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:08,078
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

348
00:26:08,213 --> 00:26:11,223
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

349
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:13,900
without any moustaches.

350
00:26:18,971 --> 00:26:21,726
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

351
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,642
But there is no subordination of any kind.

352
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,088
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

353
00:26:27,272 --> 00:26:30,527
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

354
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:33,429
and, above all, to your righteousness

355
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:37,877
 because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

356
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,946
has to look after that side.

357
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,172
How many quarrels you create?

358
00:26:45,324 --> 00:26:49,764
How can you be quarrelsome
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

359
00:26:49,978 --> 00:26:52,583
Supposing we send two peacemakers

360
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:56,517
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

361
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,972
what will you say to such a thing?

362
00:27:01,683 --> 00:27:04,962
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

363
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:10,483
you have  the one who has to bring such

364
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:15,823
expression of love, such sweet things

365
00:27:18,892 --> 00:27:24,840
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

366
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,358
because you are the mother.

367
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,488
The family must feel secured within you

368
00:27:31,427 --> 00:27:34,731
 and this love is your power.

369
00:27:37,183 --> 00:27:39,833
 This is your power that you can give love

370
00:27:40,264 --> 00:27:44,711
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

371
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:49,621
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

372
00:27:49,724 --> 00:27:52,121
 I don't know I'll have to build another house!

373
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:54,559
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

374
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:56,448
 I will not take any individual presents."

375
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,156
Now still despite that. I don't know,

376
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:05,039
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

377
00:28:06,258 --> 00:28:10,458
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

378
00:28:10,569 --> 00:28:12,682
You are some times surprised.

379
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:18,665
 I'll give you one simple example of my own life

380
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,375
which will tell you how love can work it out.

381
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:26,315
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

382
00:28:26,931 --> 00:28:29,272
And once I was in Delhi,

383
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:34,411
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

384
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:35,979
sitting outside in the lawn,

385
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:40,086
 when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

386
00:28:40,444 --> 00:28:42,756
and they came and said, "See now we are...

387
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:46,377
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

388
00:28:46,496 --> 00:28:49,167
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

389
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:50,566
and he is a Muslim,

390
00:28:50,741 --> 00:28:53,972
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

391
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,773
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

392
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,083
 they were quite alright.

393
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,678
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

394
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:04,119
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

395
00:29:04,223 --> 00:29:06,304
and a bathroom and this thing,

396
00:29:06,471 --> 00:29:08,951
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

397
00:29:09,084 --> 00:29:11,340
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

398
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:14,718
In the evening my brother came in.

399
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,718
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

400
00:29:16,854 --> 00:29:17,887
he said "What is this?

401
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:20,173
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

402
00:29:20,395 --> 00:29:24,415
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

403
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:26,303
my husband came, he also joined him

404
00:29:26,407 --> 00:29:29,676
 because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

405
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:32,696
All men just the same, you see,

406
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:34,930
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

407
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:36,963
she has kept these three persons here.

408
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,068
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

409
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,572
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

410
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:45,900
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

411
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:47,529
all kind of things.

412
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:51,113
Next morning they forgot about that.

413
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:54,552
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

414
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:57,039
I can't drag them out today, one night."

415
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:59,638
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

416
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:01,060
That's like men!

417
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:03,124
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

418
00:30:03,243 --> 00:30:06,620
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

419
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:09,780
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

420
00:30:10,424 --> 00:30:12,809
Next morning they went away for their work.

421
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,507
 They had no time. It was, you see,

422
00:30:15,619 --> 00:30:19,136
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

423
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:22,480
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

424
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,031
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

425
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,577
Then this lady got a job

426
00:30:31,617 --> 00:30:37,115
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

427
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:41,950
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

428
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:49,171
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

429
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:51,437
It had a reflection in Delhi

430
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,850
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

431
00:30:54,283 --> 00:30:58,204
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

432
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:01,994
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

433
00:31:02,322 --> 00:31:04,139
I said, "No. How can I have?"

434
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:06,794
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

435
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,979
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi),
can you believe it

436
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:12,491
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

437
00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:16,875
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

438
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,399
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

439
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:25,955
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

440
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:27,621
because I will not allow you!"

441
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:29,883
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

442
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:34,870
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

443
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:36,915
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

444
00:31:37,011 --> 00:31:39,582
 I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

445
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:41,354
His life was saved.

446
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:44,327
 Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

447
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:47,462
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

448
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:51,945
and this lady became a great actress,

449
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:54,290
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

450
00:31:54,457 --> 00:31:56,972
 the one who used to act like a mother?

451
00:31:58,446 --> 00:32:01,623
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

452
00:32:02,949 --> 00:32:05,580
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

453
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,548
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

454
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:10,917
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

455
00:32:11,124 --> 00:32:12,889
they will just go mad about Me,"

456
00:32:12,968 --> 00:32:15,182
and I said "I have no time for all that."

457
00:32:15,524 --> 00:32:20,331
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

458
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:21,636
to give them some good films.

459
00:32:21,723 --> 00:32:24,415
But it all made into a farce, later on.

460
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,789
 They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

461
00:32:27,123 --> 00:32:31,561
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

462
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:33,559
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

463
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:35,781
 I have said, I have anything to do with it."

464
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:42,160
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

465
00:32:44,221 --> 00:32:46,929
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

466
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:49,717
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

467
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,608
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

468
00:32:52,744 --> 00:32:54,102
You will have to give me Sari.

469
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,944
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

470
00:32:56,021 --> 00:32:57,952
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

471
00:32:58,071 --> 00:32:59,795
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

472
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:02,692
 big muhurat is the one where you start it.

473
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:06,788
 So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

474
00:33:06,966 --> 00:33:09,047
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

475
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:10,835
 that she has seen Me after twelve years.

476
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,061
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

477
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:16,196
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

478
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:18,802
fell into my arms

479
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:22,767
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

480
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,920
I have been trying to trace you out."

481
00:33:25,184 --> 00:33:28,377
Then she started describing Me and all.

482
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:31,308
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

483
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:34,564
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

484
00:33:34,885 --> 00:33:37,855
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

485
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:39,656
we'll give our lives for Her!"

486
00:33:39,998 --> 00:33:42,280
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

487
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:45,021
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

488
00:33:45,235 --> 00:33:46,302
Nothing doing. "

489
00:33:46,531 --> 00:33:47,531
 See now,

490
00:33:47,939 --> 00:33:51,170
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

491
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,126
I didn't have so many rights on

492
00:33:55,948 --> 00:33:58,910
my husband's property, or anything,

493
00:33:59,014 --> 00:34:01,174
and my brother another dominating fellow,

494
00:34:01,404 --> 00:34:04,033
both of them put together,

495
00:34:04,256 --> 00:34:06,670
just were about to kill me that night,

496
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,524
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

497
00:34:11,326 --> 00:34:13,616
and then you know when I told my husband

498
00:34:13,736 --> 00:34:15,855
and my brother, they were amazed.

499
00:34:16,014 --> 00:34:18,524
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

500
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:20,470
 and see the change,

501
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:23,236
how much they have...",

502
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:26,518
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

503
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,456
no to any charitable institution.

504
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,489
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

505
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:35,676
And the whole idea of a...

506
00:34:36,298 --> 00:34:40,776
earning and money just toppled down.

507
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:44,294
And she has acted in many films for charity

508
00:34:45,009 --> 00:34:49,634
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

509
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,189
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

510
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,504
because she herself is charitable.

511
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:03,919
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

512
00:35:05,202 --> 00:35:07,487
And she can create beauty around her,

513
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:11,730
in her household, in her family, in her society.

514
00:35:11,889 --> 00:35:13,733
Everywhere. But no!

515
00:35:13,902 --> 00:35:17,354
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

516
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:22,638
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

517
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:26,511
 [UNCLEAR]

518
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:30,662
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

519
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:37,789
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

520
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,983
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

521
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:43,629
and that they have to be told.

522
00:35:44,323 --> 00:35:46,132
But this is not the way!

523
00:35:46,643 --> 00:35:52,150
 There is another way of improving these men, who try to

524
00:35:53,715 --> 00:35:54,967
destroy the women,

525
00:35:55,237 --> 00:36:00,176
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

526
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:05,237
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

527
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:08,479
He will never side with men if they are chaste

528
00:36:08,852 --> 00:36:11,713
and do not try to show off their body

529
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:14,546
 and show off their beauty and want to make,

530
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:17,083
sort of, a capital out of it.

531
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:23,891
Such women are extremely powerful,

532
00:36:25,379 --> 00:36:27,913
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

533
00:36:28,191 --> 00:36:29,717
when it comes to anything

534
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:33,378
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

535
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:35,277
She fought the British.

536
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,224
And the British also

537
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,901
were surprised at her valour and they said that

538
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:41,625
we had got Jhansi, alright,

539
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:44,914
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

540
00:36:48,016 --> 00:36:50,444
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

541
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:54,161
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

542
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,743
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

543
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,663
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

544
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,260
who have been great women, who were housewives.

545
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:15,405
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

546
00:37:15,636 --> 00:37:17,196
or potential of any energy.

547
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:20,244
 Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

548
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,699
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

549
00:37:22,977 --> 00:37:26,178
 one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

550
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,415
So one has to understand that we are potential

551
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,560
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

552
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:36,626
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

553
00:37:36,873 --> 00:37:40,457
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

554
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,864
 But men are another stupid stuff

555
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,955
because they will not respect a woman

556
00:37:46,153 --> 00:37:48,727
who loves them, who is chaste,

557
00:37:48,921 --> 00:37:52,095
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

558
00:37:52,249 --> 00:37:55,250
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

559
00:37:55,417 --> 00:37:58,872
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

560
00:37:59,024 --> 00:38:02,312
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

561
00:38:02,495 --> 00:38:06,524
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

562
00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:10,735
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

563
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:18,536
 What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

564
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:21,737
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

565
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:23,471
that the way they get attracted.

566
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:26,864
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

567
00:38:27,126 --> 00:38:29,278
women become very insecure

568
00:38:29,806 --> 00:38:32,266
and they get insecured. As a result,

569
00:38:32,473 --> 00:38:35,063
the men suffer and women suffer.

570
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:39,709
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

571
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:45,158
will consequently get blood cancer.

572
00:38:53,179 --> 00:38:55,377
And the woman who behaves like this,

573
00:38:57,892 --> 00:39:02,282
in this manner and if she ill-treats

574
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:06,047
her husband, will get asthma

575
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:12,054
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

576
00:39:14,583 --> 00:39:18,027
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

577
00:39:19,621 --> 00:39:22,645
could be complete dehydration of the body.

578
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,518
Because left nabhi is so important.

579
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,954
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

580
00:39:35,137 --> 00:39:39,821
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

581
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:44,563
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

582
00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:46,554
I have always seen

583
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:51,101
 that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

584
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:55,760
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

585
00:39:55,871 --> 00:39:58,262
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

586
00:39:58,326 --> 00:40:00,883
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

587
00:40:01,071 --> 00:40:03,409
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

588
00:40:03,989 --> 00:40:07,604
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

589
00:40:08,822 --> 00:40:11,998
He gets something for the jumping

590
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,930
and she gets something for her torturing.

591
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:20,919
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

592
00:40:24,624 --> 00:40:26,960
This so-called figure madness,

593
00:40:27,423 --> 00:40:30,732
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

594
00:40:31,116 --> 00:40:36,062
 It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

595
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:41,830
Women have to be settled down women.

596
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:45,074
They have to be Grahasthis,

597
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:47,797
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

598
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:50,435
 Said to be satisfied with her household.

599
00:40:50,954 --> 00:40:52,868
If she is all the time running about,

600
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:54,552
 she doesn't want to stay in the house

601
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,865
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

602
00:41:01,294 --> 00:41:06,072
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

603
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:08,487
and then she was made a housewife

604
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:10,903
but she could not stop her running about

605
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,999
because she was a maid servant.

606
00:41:14,877 --> 00:41:16,792
She doesn't settle in the household.

607
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,969
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

608
00:41:21,117 --> 00:41:24,441
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

609
00:41:24,764 --> 00:41:26,859
but for others to welcome.

610
00:41:27,558 --> 00:41:30,577
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

611
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,021
 to come and sit and enjoy.

612
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,581
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

613
00:41:36,692 --> 00:41:39,488
we find that people, after marriage,

614
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:43,889
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

615
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:49,031
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

616
00:41:49,325 --> 00:41:52,549
and disobedient, torturesome.

617
00:41:53,505 --> 00:41:57,765
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

618
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:00,873
Not that I punish this,

619
00:42:01,037 --> 00:42:03,417
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

620
00:42:03,526 --> 00:42:06,468
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

621
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:09,722
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

622
00:42:12,706 --> 00:42:15,282
Then children become funny.

623
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,392
 Just for your family, just for your food,

624
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:23,020
just for your household, this selfishness,

625
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,426
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

626
00:42:27,643 --> 00:42:30,570
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

627
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,542
but if the man is a gone case,

628
00:42:37,194 --> 00:42:39,544
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

629
00:42:39,689 --> 00:42:43,035
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

630
00:42:44,456 --> 00:42:49,057
Our family is not of one man one woman

631
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:51,913
but the whole universe is our family.

632
00:42:54,293 --> 00:42:56,665
We are not on our own,

633
00:42:57,314 --> 00:43:00,791
 and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

634
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:04,302
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

635
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,346
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

636
00:43:07,713 --> 00:43:09,148
a day will come,

637
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:13,879
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

638
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:19,721
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

639
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:22,743
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

640
00:43:25,626 --> 00:43:29,896
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

641
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,877
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

642
00:43:33,994 --> 00:43:35,220
group of women,

643
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:39,528
 she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

644
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:49,105
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

645
00:43:49,242 --> 00:43:52,869
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

646
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:56,642
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

647
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:03,867
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

648
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:07,307
Not because it is a punishment from God.

649
00:44:10,963 --> 00:44:14,462
 So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

650
00:44:16,164 --> 00:44:21,009
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

651
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:25,113
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

652
00:44:29,352 --> 00:44:33,002
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

653
00:44:35,395 --> 00:44:38,382
Those women who have tried such tricks,

654
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:42,370
 should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

655
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:44,562
Nobody respects such a woman.

656
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,278
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

657
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:52,876
The leader's wife or the leadership

658
00:44:52,992 --> 00:45:00,550
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

659
00:45:01,272 --> 00:45:03,262
Most insignificant.

660
00:45:05,554 --> 00:45:09,536
What you got is much higher than this.

661
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:16,452
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

662
00:45:17,063 --> 00:45:19,552
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

663
00:45:25,725 --> 00:45:27,463
Is the minimal of minimal.

664
00:45:27,816 --> 00:45:29,490
Is the lowest of lowest.

665
00:45:29,807 --> 00:45:33,644
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

666
00:45:35,143 --> 00:45:37,704
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

667
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,983
But that service itself is enjoyment.

668
00:45:44,172 --> 00:45:46,126
 But if you just keep to service.

669
00:45:46,365 --> 00:45:50,440
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

670
00:45:51,484 --> 00:45:56,966
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

671
00:45:57,636 --> 00:45:59,771
You can be used for a cross!

672
00:46:04,938 --> 00:46:07,258
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

673
00:46:07,393 --> 00:46:11,105
 unless and until you have that essence

674
00:46:11,232 --> 00:46:14,633
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

675
00:46:16,573 --> 00:46:21,588
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

676
00:46:22,786 --> 00:46:26,754
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

677
00:46:27,247 --> 00:46:29,043
then what is left?

678
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:33,245
In the same way, all the so-called service

679
00:46:33,348 --> 00:46:35,723
and seva and tapasya

680
00:46:35,946 --> 00:46:39,210
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

681
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:44,280
So the essence of all this is sweetness

682
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,413
and that is generated by women.

683
00:46:50,452 --> 00:46:52,809
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

684
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,905
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

685
00:46:55,073 --> 00:46:58,456
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

686
00:47:03,989 --> 00:47:07,409
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

687
00:47:08,463 --> 00:47:10,606
It's a good thing in a way.

688
00:47:11,813 --> 00:47:15,903
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

689
00:47:20,324 --> 00:47:22,532
But to make him all the time slave,

690
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:25,460
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

691
00:47:25,623 --> 00:47:27,844
Is not the job of a housewife!

692
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:37,087
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain?
Nothing.

693
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:39,690
She gives you everything.

694
00:47:39,786 --> 00:47:42,896
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

695
00:47:43,474 --> 00:47:44,992
Such powers She has.

696
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,072
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

697
00:47:48,567 --> 00:47:52,235
 You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

698
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:56,056
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

699
00:47:56,282 --> 00:48:00,704
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

700
00:48:00,827 --> 00:48:03,414
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

701
00:48:03,621 --> 00:48:05,211
Least expected!

702
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,080
Never in life-time.

703
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:12,369
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

704
00:48:12,575 --> 00:48:14,662
First time, I said something and see the effect.

705
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,289
Because I've never said to him!

706
00:48:20,074 --> 00:48:23,375
 So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

707
00:48:23,558 --> 00:48:26,068
satisfied within herself because she has to give.

708
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:29,048
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

709
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,955
She has to give love because she is love.

710
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:34,975
She has to give all the services.

711
00:48:35,095 --> 00:48:37,017
She has to give all the possessions;

712
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,472
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

713
00:48:40,592 --> 00:48:42,547
what a responsibility!

714
00:48:43,428 --> 00:48:46,645
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

715
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:48,545
is the responsibility of a woman,

716
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,873
and she should feel proud of it,
 that such a responsibility has come to me.

717
00:48:52,604 --> 00:48:53,976
A housewife

718
00:48:54,128 --> 00:48:57,643
 has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

719
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,872
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

720
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,598
because they think they have become leaders.

721
00:49:06,749 --> 00:49:08,315
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

722
00:49:08,434 --> 00:49:12,024
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

723
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:18,047
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

724
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:22,607
 I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

725
00:49:26,541 --> 00:49:30,012
and each one of them adores Me.

726
00:49:30,544 --> 00:49:32,960
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

727
00:49:33,111 --> 00:49:35,391
all of them will come from all over to see  me

728
00:49:35,471 --> 00:49:38,592
but My husband goes, nobody comes to see him.
He always complains.

729
00:49:39,494 --> 00:49:43,687
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
 and they come and see me, not him!

730
00:49:46,376 --> 00:49:48,408
If I had not given them love,

731
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,959
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

732
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:53,273
they would have not come to Me.

733
00:49:54,746 --> 00:49:58,850
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

734
00:49:59,148 --> 00:50:02,052
 They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

735
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,486
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

736
00:50:07,621 --> 00:50:09,251
many stupid women.

737
00:50:09,704 --> 00:50:13,102
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

738
00:50:15,267 --> 00:50:18,235
Because they don't know what power they have got.

739
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:24,925
They don't know what responsibility they have.

740
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:28,929
 I'm an example before them.

741
00:50:33,210 --> 00:50:36,828
 And this is the very big problem with Me that practically

742
00:50:37,122 --> 00:50:40,314
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

743
00:50:40,506 --> 00:50:42,937
I must say, horrible.

744
00:50:45,451 --> 00:50:48,006
And Sahajayoga goes dhap like that with them.

745
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:50,954
They can't live in an ashram,

746
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,212
they will have their food,
 the husband must see that they have their food.

747
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:57,159
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

748
00:50:57,342 --> 00:51:00,931
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

749
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:07,995
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

750
00:51:08,146 --> 00:51:11,068
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

751
00:51:14,006 --> 00:51:15,243
But no, they sit down,

752
00:51:15,379 --> 00:51:18,180
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

753
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:21,564
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

754
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:23,559
Just do that! Do this!"

755
00:51:27,987 --> 00:51:30,335
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

756
00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:35,117
Every wife of a leader

757
00:51:35,366 --> 00:51:40,262
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

758
00:51:45,031 --> 00:51:47,824
They have to cook. And with heart.

759
00:51:48,296 --> 00:51:52,390
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

760
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,420
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

761
00:51:57,946 --> 00:52:00,850
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

762
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:04,143
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

763
00:52:04,453 --> 00:52:07,527
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

764
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,855
encourage their niceness.

765
00:52:10,157 --> 00:52:12,613
 Also I have seen, some very good ladies

766
00:52:12,685 --> 00:52:15,567
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

767
00:52:15,671 --> 00:52:16,928
After marriage they are lost.

768
00:52:16,992 --> 00:52:20,197
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

769
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:26,220
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
 otherwise they are not there.

770
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:31,043
Today I was asking Arneau,
he told Me so many of them are like that here.

771
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:34,771
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

772
00:52:36,179 --> 00:52:38,496
because before marriage they were better off.

773
00:52:40,051 --> 00:52:44,653
 So how much it is important, a Gruhalakshmi Principle within us,

774
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:46,952
for us to be together,

775
00:52:47,215 --> 00:52:50,405
to us to grow together, to feel the togetherness,

776
00:52:50,654 --> 00:52:53,153
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

777
00:52:53,826 --> 00:52:57,294
 So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

778
00:52:57,453 --> 00:52:59,111
the Ragas we have.

779
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,156
Ra is energy.

780
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:05,796
Ga is in Sanskrit language ‘Ga - Geti’ (ग गेती )  means 'which penetrates',

781
00:53:05,955 --> 00:53:07,296
'which moves into everything',

782
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,521
it's the etheric qualities, 

783
00:53:12,408 --> 00:53:14,352
etheric, into which you see,

784
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:17,392
you put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

785
00:53:18,202 --> 00:53:22,649
 So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

786
00:53:24,178 --> 00:53:26,614
and touches your spirit.

787
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:29,950
That is the Raga.

788
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:36,052
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

789
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:45,156
Supposing if you stand with a military band

790
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:48,836
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

791
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:54,771
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

792
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:59,831
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

793
00:54:01,503 --> 00:54:04,685
 The way the housewife decorates the house,

794
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:09,277
she smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

795
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:11,433
then she's looking after everyone.

796
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:13,632
 Everybody knows she is standing there.

797
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,914
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

798
00:54:18,177 --> 00:54:21,735
some people for birthday cake of your child

799
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:24,064
and you cut the cake first

800
00:54:25,009 --> 00:54:26,956
because you are the housewife.

801
00:54:27,822 --> 00:54:31,420
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

802
00:54:32,296 --> 00:54:35,632
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

803
00:54:35,902 --> 00:54:39,175
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

804
00:54:41,172 --> 00:54:43,191
Look after all of them,

805
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:49,070
and this is what is a Raga is.

806
00:54:49,132 --> 00:54:53,741
It caters to all your angularities.

807
00:54:53,845 --> 00:54:56,966
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

808
00:54:57,054 --> 00:54:59,723
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

809
00:55:00,513 --> 00:55:02,139
It soothes you down.

810
00:55:03,898 --> 00:55:06,112
It makes you settle down.

811
00:55:06,858 --> 00:55:12,054
Like people come home for five days, live like

812
00:55:12,637 --> 00:55:14,977
 I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

813
00:55:15,242 --> 00:55:18,188
and live in a tent-like thing

814
00:55:18,339 --> 00:55:21,437
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

815
00:55:22,202 --> 00:55:24,075
or they go and stay in a hotel.

816
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,721
Nobody wants to stay in the house

817
00:55:27,293 --> 00:55:30,518
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

818
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:36,875
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

819
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:40,187
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

820
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:43,976
Imagine somebody listening to a Raga when he's a jumpy.

821
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:47,990
So, one has to settle down

822
00:55:48,395 --> 00:55:53,813
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

823
00:55:54,092 --> 00:55:55,713
who is a housewife,

824
00:55:56,016 --> 00:55:59,581
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

825
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:03,958
 As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

826
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,040
in the modern times, much more,

827
00:56:06,483 --> 00:56:11,028
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

828
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:13,412
Is that the wife...

829
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,251
normally in India before, you see,

830
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:19,619
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

831
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:21,971
all the time his wife is not with him.

832
00:56:22,233 --> 00:56:25,108
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

833
00:56:25,408 --> 00:56:29,386
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

834
00:56:30,101 --> 00:56:32,635
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

835
00:56:32,963 --> 00:56:34,645
then they have a divorce.

836
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:38,263
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

837
00:56:38,421 --> 00:56:40,723
household, Sahajayoga, things like that.

838
00:56:41,218 --> 00:56:44,791
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

839
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:47,780
sits on the ground, in India.

840
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,513
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

841
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:53,538
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

842
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:58,003
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

843
00:56:59,421 --> 00:57:01,373
Or  "This lady was quarrelling"

844
00:57:01,493 --> 00:57:04,161
or "I met another lady she was telling me you were this

845
00:57:04,275 --> 00:57:07,465
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

846
00:57:08,431 --> 00:57:09,771
That's why in India

847
00:57:09,891 --> 00:57:11,978
 if husband has to show temper he doesn't eat

848
00:57:12,081 --> 00:57:15,132
 his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

849
00:57:19,341 --> 00:57:21,169
That is how, they show their temper.

850
00:57:21,423 --> 00:57:24,375
 So then she fans the husband slowly

851
00:57:24,577 --> 00:57:28,229
and tells him good things, "You see, today you know why?

852
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:32,519
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

853
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:36,079
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes, he said, he said so".

854
00:57:36,344 --> 00:57:39,622
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

855
00:57:43,414 --> 00:57:45,535
but you see all nice things, you see,

856
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:48,800
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

857
00:57:48,962 --> 00:57:51,031
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

858
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,763
And your sister is coming.

859
00:57:52,891 --> 00:57:54,867
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

860
00:57:55,027 --> 00:57:57,043
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

861
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:01,511
So he eats his food nicely then he go washes his hands

862
00:58:01,797 --> 00:58:04,536
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

863
00:58:04,721 --> 00:58:06,857
where there is a jam, always.

864
00:58:07,543 --> 00:58:12,656
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

865
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:16,344
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

866
00:58:16,575 --> 00:58:18,847
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

867
00:58:19,046 --> 00:58:21,484
that on the periphery of the

868
00:58:22,773 --> 00:58:24,886
wheel you have the speed

869
00:58:25,121 --> 00:58:29,804
but at the axis it is not.
So the Sahajayogis have to be at the axis,

870
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:34,927
and so the husband and the wife,
 the left and the right side of a chariot

871
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:37,431
have to be on the axis

872
00:58:37,654 --> 00:58:40,489
and the left is left and the right is right.

873
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:43,684
 Now the women always take more time to get ready.

874
00:58:43,835 --> 00:58:46,170
Not Me, I take less than My husband,

875
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:51,102
much less than My husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

876
00:58:51,645 --> 00:58:55,210
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

877
00:58:55,355 --> 00:58:58,658
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

878
00:58:58,865 --> 00:59:01,041
Men must see their watches ten times.

879
00:59:01,465 --> 00:59:06,046
Women might see it once or may be
their watches are lost or out of order -

880
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:07,868
if they are real women.

881
00:59:08,186 --> 00:59:11,338
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

882
00:59:11,754 --> 00:59:15,002
But they are women and you are men,

883
00:59:15,193 --> 00:59:18,107
and God has made men and women.

884
00:59:18,356 --> 00:59:20,254
If it was to make a unisex,

885
00:59:20,397 --> 00:59:22,897
He would have made unisex, He did not.

886
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:27,582
 So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

887
00:59:27,805 --> 00:59:32,476
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

888
00:59:32,907 --> 00:59:35,416
And you must know this is Woman's party!

889
00:59:35,764 --> 00:59:38,813
 In India we have these things like, you know,

890
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,072
I was married in a family,

891
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:45,170
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

892
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:48,100
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of My husband,

893
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:52,254
so, he told My elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

894
00:59:52,678 --> 00:59:54,537
my friend come and see Me.

895
00:59:55,016 --> 01:00:00,810
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for Me

896
01:00:01,012 --> 01:00:04,355
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

897
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:08,034
and told his wife that "See that She goes and sees the collector".

898
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:10,331
See how beautiful it was,

899
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:16,448
how beautiful it was,

900
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:21,256
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

901
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:25,020
because after all that was the system of that family,
alright, its alright.

902
01:00:27,619 --> 01:00:31,686
 But for this what you need is pure Intelligence.

903
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:35,808
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

904
01:00:36,105 --> 01:00:38,909
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down the husband.

905
01:00:39,227 --> 01:00:43,538
If a woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

906
01:00:44,457 --> 01:00:48,170
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

907
01:00:48,451 --> 01:00:52,572
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

908
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:59,907
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

909
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,681
That person is the most sensitive,

910
01:01:04,174 --> 01:01:05,898
is the most intelligent.

911
01:01:06,281 --> 01:01:09,304
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

912
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,690
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

913
01:01:12,849 --> 01:01:14,439
so, is better leave it to the book,

914
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:16,711
and today let us have the puja

915
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:18,409
May God Bless You.

916
01:01:18,516 --> 01:01:20,221
 Any questions?

917
01:01:25,913 --> 01:01:28,572
This means, I'll be spending some money!

918
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:33,030
I don't know, there's no chance! I don't know when will I spend.

919
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,839
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

920
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:37,593
 That's why the money is for.

921
01:01:37,707 --> 01:01:39,445
Must give to others, you see.

922
01:01:39,508 --> 01:01:41,564
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

923
01:01:41,616 --> 01:01:43,508
Just enjoy giving others.

924
01:01:44,607 --> 01:01:47,194
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
