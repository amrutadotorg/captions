00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.708
This chakra is placed at the back of the sternum bone as I told you.

00:00:12.788 --> 00:00:23.955
In childhood, the antibodies are formed in the sternum bone.

00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:33.739
They are the warriors or the [SOUNDS LIKE Sainikas] of the Devi.

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:41.084
Until the age of 12 years they grow and multiply,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.173
and ultimately they all get distributed all over the body,

00:00:52.919 --> 00:01:02.095
and a human being is made able to face any outside invasion on him.

00:01:09.307 --> 00:01:16.869
These antibodies know how to fight.

00:01:18.268 --> 00:01:26.923
They are extremely confident and they know who are their enemies.

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:33.417
They've all these messages built in themselves.

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:43.486
So when the anti-God element enters
into the being through any process,

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:56.597
say, through food, through words, through
action, through devilish people, or black magic,

00:01:58.094 --> 00:02:10.508
these antibodies combine together, collectively fight the invaders.

00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:23.637
Those who do not have their Central Heart properly developed

00:02:23.717 --> 00:02:27.240
suffer from tremendous insecurity all their lives.

00:02:31.473 --> 00:02:42.580
When they are children, you try to control them by frightening.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.036
These children later on become extremely insecure.

00:02:50.116 --> 00:02:55.533
They are afraid of darkness, they are afraid of night.

00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:59.892
Some of them are afraid of everything.

00:02:59.978 --> 00:03:10.169
Because the antibodies that are built
in the body are not sufficient in number

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:21.471
and being this center so weak, the person feels extremely insecure.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:37.714
Later on in life when the child goes to the school
or he tries to work out something for the future,

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:49.465
then also his confidence can be shaken
by parents, teachers, and outside people.

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:56.962
So it is very important to understand children who are growing.

00:03:57.936 --> 00:04:06.796
In the West they analyze everything and
try to put human beings into compartments.

00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:19.581
First the child, is a child according to them,
child has no innocence, and he's extremely selfish.

00:04:20.638 --> 00:04:33.443
Second part is adolescence, which
they think is a very arbitrary, moody stuff.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:41.208
In India, we do not know that there is something like adolescence.

00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:52.300
Now these adolescent people form a group, and
they start criticizing or making fun of all the elders.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.360
At a very young age it starts.

00:04:58.326 --> 00:05:07.221
First they make fun of the teachers, then of the
parents, then of all the people who are senior to them.

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:17.376
They start becoming extremely active in their brains
because they see too many televisions and things like that,

00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:30.362
and then they start behaving at a very young
age in such violent ways that one cannot imagine.

00:05:30.443 --> 00:05:34.686
I used to live about 25 miles away from London.

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:43.133
And every time I would go to London, I would find
some children doing some sort of a mischief, somewhere.

00:05:43.232 --> 00:05:47.878
One day some of them entered into my compartment,

00:05:49.191 --> 00:05:54.897
and they started pulling out all the covers,

00:05:54.977 --> 00:06:06.665
thrusting their knives into the seats, opening out all the upholstery.

00:06:06.745 --> 00:06:15.135
I was just sitting and watching. So I said, "Now
are you tired? Please sit down. What's the problem?"

00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:21.028
They said, "We are all very angry." I
said, "For what? Why are you angry?"

00:06:21.108 --> 00:06:27.219
Said, "We are just angry." I said, "But
you have to be angry for something."

00:06:30.057 --> 00:06:36.793
They were children going to good
schools definitely, wearing very good clothes.

00:06:36.892 --> 00:06:42.212
And then I had to, - when the train
stopped - I called the ticket collector

00:06:42.292 --> 00:06:52.010
and told him that these boys have been doing all this
hooliganic, hooliganism in the compartment and you better look at it.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:59.539
And he came in and he said, "this is a common
thing" and then somehow or other he took them out.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:06.620
But the only thing I felt about them is, that
all of them had their Center Heart catching.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.616
On the Kundalini, they were catching their Center Heart.

00:07:14.696 --> 00:07:21.133
But when they saw Me, they sat down.
They were quiet, they listened to Me.

00:07:21.213 --> 00:07:24.640
I settled their Center Heart.

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:33.862
And most of them said, "We are angry with our mother." "Why?"

00:07:33.942 --> 00:07:38.727
"Because our brothers are angry." "But why your brothers are angry?"

00:07:38.807 --> 00:07:44.850
Then I discovered that Freud has given
these funny ideas against the mother.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:51.404
Mother itself, can you imagine! What a anti-God activity it is.

00:07:51.597 --> 00:08:00.513
To an Indian, Mother is the primal thing - any Indian.

00:08:00.593 --> 00:08:06.131
Because his sense of security lies in the mother.

00:08:06.211 --> 00:08:16.287
Even if the father is hot-tempered, is
angry, still they depend on the mother.

00:08:17.444 --> 00:08:24.444
Because mother knows when to get angry and
when not to get angry. She has the discrimination.

00:08:25.075 --> 00:08:28.603
And she is the one who protects them.

00:08:29.096 --> 00:08:33.304
I've told you the first reason, the family insecurities.

00:08:33.384 --> 00:08:41.463
The child does not know when he comes back from school,
whether his mother would be there or she would be gone.

00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:50.353
They don't have mothers who can bear a lot from the husbands and smile

00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:54.916
and show no signs of their agony to their children.

00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:59.943
But the mothers in that country, I've
seen, always try to use their children

00:09:00.023 --> 00:09:05.384
from all kinds of emotional blackmail, you can call it.

00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:10.625
They try to torture the child by telling all
the things the husband is doing to them

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.923
and whatever is the problem they are facing with the husbands.

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:25.155
So the child is not secured by the mother, but, on
the contrary, child starts giving security to mother there.

00:09:25.241 --> 00:09:31.058
At a very young age it starts, and the child
becomes extremely negative and left-sided.

00:09:31.138 --> 00:09:38.119
He feels that he's born in a place
full of hatred, insecurity, and fear.

00:09:38.319 --> 00:09:53.908
When a person is frightened, this center start breathing
fast, giving rhythmic instructions to all the antibodies.

00:09:53.989 --> 00:10:01.405
With that you feel you are getting a palpitation in the heart.

00:10:03.298 --> 00:10:15.723
This palpitation is nothing but a signal to all
the antibodies to fight the emergency of an attack.

00:10:20.761 --> 00:10:30.812
But when somebody builds up insecurity
later on in life, it becomes a physical problem.

00:10:31.316 --> 00:10:37.496
If they have insecurities earlier, it is an emotional problem.

00:10:37.883 --> 00:10:48.871
But later on in life, when one develops a insecurity
- any kind, like a wife is insecure about her husband;

00:10:50.302 --> 00:11:03.159
husband is a loafer or a bad man, and carrying on with
other women, so the motherhood of the wife is challenged.

00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:10.319
And when her motherhood is challenged,
she may get the weakening of this center,

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:16.067
by which she may suffer quite a lot and may have even breast cancer.

00:11:16.148 --> 00:11:21.496
These insecurities can be also self-made, imaginary.

00:11:21.576 --> 00:11:32.759
People can just think about it and build up some
sort of insecurities, which are of no actual existence.

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:40.450
This Chakra is ruined in women when they lose their only child;

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:46.164
because their motherhood is finished, they feel.

00:11:46.244 --> 00:11:50.885
And that is the worst thing that can
happen to a woman, if she's a woman.

00:11:50.965 --> 00:12:00.494
But if she's not a woman, she doesn't feel
much, and she just behaves in a very manly way.

00:12:00.574 --> 00:12:08.662
And that's what I've seen in the West, that
women really don't much care when their children die.

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:12.040
But it is because they are not women.

00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:20.320
If you are a woman you definitely
feel for your children and their death.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:26.046
But after some time, such a woman comes back again

00:12:26.126 --> 00:12:33.933
and she accepts the life as it is, for the sake of her
husband, or may be if she has more relations or other children.

00:12:35.166 --> 00:12:43.139
She becomes extremely powerful as
a reaction to what has happened to her.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:50.515
That's only possible if your center of Heart is all right.

00:12:50.595 --> 00:12:59.367
Such women do not grudge, do not complain,
are extremely serene, and can bear up lots of things.

00:12:59.447 --> 00:13:08.431
They are extremely tolerant and can
go to any extent to help their children,

00:13:08.511 --> 00:13:11.672
but they are never spoiling their children.

00:13:11.752 --> 00:13:19.541
They never spoil their children, because they
understand spoiling is much worse than beating the child.

00:13:19.621 --> 00:13:27.184
They never spoil the children, nor ever pamper
them, and never get dominated by their children.

00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:31.757
They know, "I have to guide the
child and have to look after the child."

00:13:31.837 --> 00:13:39.439
So they look after all the ideals and
righteousness and the virtues of the child.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:49.004
And if he tries to get out of it, they go all out
to win him over back to virtue and to better life.

00:13:49.084 --> 00:13:58.361
But those people, those women, who
do not care for actual growth of the child,

00:13:58.447 --> 00:14:01.753
may just avoid it and escape it.

00:14:01.834 --> 00:14:09.883
In the men, this chakra is caught up if
they have lost their mother very early,

00:14:09.963 --> 00:14:15.376
or if their mother by chance is a very cruel woman.

00:14:15.468 --> 00:14:22.317
Also this chakra can be caught up by men, if they have been to wars,

00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:27.743
and if they have seen frightful things in the war.

00:14:27.823 --> 00:14:32.236
Such people could be extremely emotional

00:14:32.317 --> 00:14:39.998
and could be easily befooled by
people who try to win over their emotions.
