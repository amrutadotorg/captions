WEBVTT

00:01.109 --> 00:17.740
We have arranged this Puja specially in England
so that many more can come and work out the

00:17.740 --> 00:22.230
awakening of Shri Krishna.

00:22.230 --> 00:42.040
Gita was written long time back, and it has
been translated into so many languages, and

00:42.040 --> 00:58.060
lots of commentaries and criticism has been
there.  So this bookish knowledge of Gita

00:58.060 --> 01:06.430
has ruined many people, and even today you
find there are many people who are selling

01:06.430 --> 01:14.960
the books of Gita all over and making it into
a bookish knowledge.  I don’t think Krishna

01:14.960 --> 01:23.460
ever thought that His knowledge will be sold
out like this to every Tom, Dick and Harry.

01:23.460 --> 01:31.410
As now, as you know, the Jehovah’s Witness,
they also selling Bible.  So it has become

01:31.410 --> 01:39.210
a marketing company for Shri Krishna’s Gita.

01:39.210 --> 01:50.920
There have been lots of horrible things against
the real religion of ascent, and Krishna has

01:50.920 --> 01:58.720
said, “Whenever there is the decline of
religion,” which is true today very much,

01:58.720 --> 02:12.479
“and whenever there is the saints being
tortured, I come on this earth to save the

02:12.479 --> 02:25.860
saints, and to destroy all the negative forces
and the devils,” as you call them, rakshasas.

02:25.860 --> 02:38.270
Pushtas they are called as, cruel people.
So awakening of Krishna is very important,

02:38.270 --> 02:50.259
that within us He should arise and He should
manifest His qualities within us.  Then only

02:50.259 --> 02:54.410
the forces will work out.

02:54.410 --> 03:04.599
Krishna, as a child, killed so many rakshasas.
Then He played with gopis just to open their

03:04.599 --> 03:19.369
Kundalini; He had the rasa by which to make
the energy of Shri Radha to pass through them.

03:19.369 --> 03:33.550
After killing Kamsa, the main rakshasa who
was ruling, who was actually His uncle, He

03:33.550 --> 03:40.139
killed him.  That means, your relations,
if they are devils and they are rakshasas,

03:40.139 --> 03:48.580
they have to be killed. Because he is your
relation you should not try to save him and

03:48.580 --> 03:59.260
try to bestow his evil on Sahaja Yogis or
on Sahaja Yoga.

03:59.260 --> 04:05.019
So Sahaja Yoga is the only organization in
the whole world, whether you call it spiritual

04:05.019 --> 04:13.019
or whatever you may call it, is the only organization
that it is also anxious to throw away many

04:13.019 --> 04:19.270
people from Sahaja Yoga.  There is no organization
- I mean we are not organization, also. But

04:19.270 --> 04:27.550
there is no spiritual movement, there is no
movement in the whole world that not only

04:27.550 --> 04:33.990
allows people to go out of Sahaja Yoga but
throws them out, because it is bound by the

04:33.990 --> 04:44.721
divine laws and it has to abide by the divine
laws.  Shri Krishna’s style was that: what

04:44.721 --> 04:53.600
is the need to throw them away? Just kill
them, finished.  So He killed His own uncle,

04:53.600 --> 05:01.600
making His own aunt a widow.  His own uncle
He threw away, out of the world, sent him

05:01.600 --> 05:11.590
to hell directly, finished it off. But in
Sahaja Yoga we give a chance for such people

05:11.590 --> 05:22.240
also who are very devilish types, who are
very detrimental to our growth, who are against

05:22.240 --> 05:30.500
spirituality, who are against God, we give
them a long rope to hang themselves. That’s

05:30.500 --> 05:43.030
the Mother side of this incarnation, but the
Krishna side is a very fast-moving one.

05:43.030 --> 05:55.910
Krishna did not live for very long.  In that
short time, how many rakshasas He killed!

05:55.910 --> 06:04.030
He fought on the side of Pandavas and He killed
all the Kauravas.  He didn’t kill, He said,

06:04.030 --> 06:18.570
but He did.  So the style of Krishna on one
side also is extremely sweet, extremely nice.

06:18.570 --> 06:24.040
He is like honey, that’s why He is called
Madhava, Madhu.  He is like honey on one

06:24.040 --> 06:38.150
side, only to the bees, only to the people
who want to be blessed by Him. But to the

06:38.150 --> 06:47.470
evil people, I think He’s one of the most
dangerous personalities.  Of course Shiva

06:47.470 --> 07:05.250
also does that, He has killed so many rakshasas.
And also Devi has killed many rakshasas, but

07:05.250 --> 07:15.410
She went into wars, actual wars, and She went
into discussions and arguments and things

07:15.410 --> 07:27.120
like that; but Shri Krishna, He never argued
and He knew how to get rid of them, one by

07:27.120 --> 07:34.709
one, and He played some tricks on them.
One of them I’ll tell you.

07:34.709 --> 07:48.090
There was a rakshasa who by pleasing Shiva
had got a blessing

07:48.090 --> 08:00.570
that he
is sleeping and in his sleep anybody wakes

08:00.570 --> 08:11.620
him up, such a person should be made into
ashes, bhasmasak.  Must be a good sleeper,

08:11.620 --> 08:24.609
I tell you, our neighbor, the camper, gets
some sleep like that.  And he said, “I

08:24.609 --> 08:28.060
should not be disturbed if I am sleeping.”

08:28.060 --> 08:31.960
So Shiva thought, “It’s a very simple
thing, you see. Why should anybody disturb

08:31.960 --> 08:38.440
this old Johnny? And he would be sleeping
in some cave somewhere, so it’s all right.”

08:38.440 --> 08:47.580
He didn’t think it would be quite dangerous.

08:47.580 --> 09:01.560
And he had also blessings that nobody can
conquer him, and

09:01.560 --> 09:14.180
he cannot be, he cannot be disturbed by anybody
who tries to conquer this boon on him.  So

09:14.180 --> 09:20.230
actually he was a saint, in a way, because
he was meditating and all that, but some saints

09:20.230 --> 09:26.209
become ascetic and become really, like you
should say, very right-sided.  So I would

09:26.209 --> 09:31.659
call him a rakshasa only because this kind
of people are of no use.  They just go on

09:31.659 --> 09:37.790
cursing people, saying things to them and
just finishing them off.  So then you, of

09:37.790 --> 09:43.529
course in Sahaja Yoga language there are only
two things; there are Sahaja Yogis or rakshasas,

09:43.529 --> 09:49.510
there’s nothing in between.  So we could
find he was a very right-sided, horrible,

09:49.510 --> 09:53.469
ascetic fellow who got this boon from Shiva.

09:53.469 --> 09:59.719
There was one rakshasa, actual rakshasa, I
mean that was no saintliness in him at all.

09:59.719 --> 10:07.719
This is a mixture, half-baked sort of thing.
You see, if you see the canvas of Mahabharata

10:07.719 --> 10:17.689
you will be amazed that all kinds of peoples
are described in that.  So now, this second

10:17.689 --> 10:24.459
one was a real, real rakshasa, born out of
rakshasas and was of a rakshasa quality.

10:24.459 --> 10:37.099
He, too, had another boon from Shiva that
nobody can kill him. Unless and until somebody

10:37.099 --> 10:49.659
who has got Your boon that he can kill somebody,
nobody else should kill him.

10:49.659 --> 10:54.920
Imagine poor Shiva, you see, He thought, “It’s
a very sensible thing, after all, so that

10:54.920 --> 11:01.570
he won’t cross Me.” He said, “All right.”
He’s very easily pleased, Shiva is, the

11:01.570 --> 11:06.009
problem is that.

11:06.009 --> 11:18.329
So this second one, the real one, the real
rakshasa was torturing people, and he started

11:18.329 --> 11:25.689
a big war and Shri Krishna also went in for
that war.  He was the one, that’s the only

11:25.689 --> 11:34.759
war He fought Himself and they were all fighting
there.  So Shri Krishna knew that this Shiva

11:34.759 --> 11:43.019
is not going to let this person down at any
cost, because he knows, “I am all right,”

11:43.019 --> 11:49.699
so He would not allow him to be lost.  So
what should we do?

11:49.699 --> 11:54.339
So He played a trick. He started running out

11:54.339 --> 12:02.839
of the battlefield.  Now is regarded as something
very cowardly to run out of a battlefield,

12:02.839 --> 12:09.190
you see.  I mean a person, if like that goes
to his house, his wife will refuse to have

12:09.190 --> 12:16.560
him.  It’s a very cowardly thing and it’s
very disgraceful, but what is for God, it

12:16.560 --> 12:23.670
has, it has - They have no sense of grace
or disgrace, you see.  So He ran out of the

12:23.670 --> 12:31.949
battlefield which we call, that’s why He
is called as Ranchodas, it means “the one

12:31.949 --> 12:35.490
who runs away from the battlefield.” Ranchodas.
It is His name. One of the names of Shri Krishna,

12:35.490 --> 12:46.329
is Ranchodas.  So He ran out, He ran out
and when this rakshasa discovered that Krishna

12:46.329 --> 12:51.670
has run away, he ran after Him. But Krishna
was running very fast, you see.  Rakshasa,

12:51.670 --> 12:58.709
being so bulky, could not run that fast, but
still he was running, you see.  And Krishna

12:58.709 --> 13:06.439
was seeing that he sees Him running up to
that, was keeping it.  So He went there and

13:06.439 --> 13:12.500
He entered into the cave where this another
half-baked rakshasa and half-baked yogi was

13:12.500 --> 13:23.360
sleeping.  He took out His shawl, Shri Krishna,
and put it on that yogi and He hid Himself.

13:23.360 --> 13:31.300
He covered his face – he was fast asleep
so very gently He did it.

13:31.300 --> 13:42.699
Now came the number one rakshasa, he entered
into the cave, couldn’t see Krishna anywhere

13:42.699 --> 13:49.510
but he saw this man sleeping, He saw this
is Shri Krishna,  “Oh, so now You are tired

13:49.510 --> 13:54.969
and now You are sleeping, now I’ll see how
You can survive, I’ll see to it.”  And

13:54.969 --> 14:04.790
he just went onto his throat, so this half-baked
fellow who was granted this boon, got up and

14:04.790 --> 14:13.189
he looked at him and with his third eye he
burnt him and he became ….  This is the

14:13.189 --> 14:15.110
trick.

14:15.110 --> 14:29.770
So that is how He killed so many rakshasas,
and also He told tricks to others in arguments,

14:29.770 --> 14:41.949
also He killed half-baked people, quite a
lot of them.  So I must say He was so powerful

14:41.949 --> 14:54.490
that He could work out any trick on people,
sitting down in one place. And there are so

14:54.490 --> 15:04.849
many stories about Him which I cannot tell
in one lecture, that His killing process was

15:04.849 --> 15:11.040
so smooth that nobody objected to it.

15:11.040 --> 15:16.519
There was a woman who was a devil, was sent
by Kamsa to kill Him.  And she had poison,

15:16.519 --> 15:25.019
she had put poison in her breast and she came
and she started nursing Him, and when He started

15:25.019 --> 15:34.019
sucking her (when he was a little boy of three,
four years, or maybe two years) her breast,

15:34.019 --> 15:42.759
she started becoming big, big and she died.
And then they saw that she was Putana, the

15:42.759 --> 15:44.290
one who was the devil, known.

15:44.290 --> 15:56.509
And once He knew that there are two rakshasas
who are camouflaged as two big trees.  So

15:56.509 --> 16:04.499
His mother tied Him once with - she was angry
because He was stealing her butter so she

16:04.499 --> 16:15.189
didn’t know what to tie so she tied Him
with a pounding - that we have got for rice

16:15.189 --> 16:21.499
pounding, a kind of a wooden thing, big thing.
It’s quite heavy.  So she tied Him to that.

16:21.499 --> 16:28.140
It’s such a heavy thing, I mean, you need
at least five-six people to lift it, but when

16:28.140 --> 16:34.149
she went away, Shri Krishna just walked with
it with His small, little feet, you see, and

16:34.149 --> 16:37.349
went near those trees and hit them both on
both the sides and both the trees fell down

16:37.349 --> 16:40.469
and the rakshasas died.

16:40.469 --> 16:53.249
He was so knowledgeable and so clever, because
you know that He is the brain. He is the Virata.

16:53.249 --> 17:01.230
He did it without any compassion whatsoever.
All His love, all His compassion, all everything,

17:01.230 --> 17:11.010
duty, was only meant for His gopis and gopes.
And then, when He became the king, also His

17:11.010 --> 17:19.780
life is very mysterious for people to understand,
but Sahaja yogis can understand it. But when

17:19.780 --> 17:26.640
He became the king, He had to have wives,
so He married five wives.  Imagine, more

17:26.640 --> 17:35.010
than Mohammed Sahib.  These five, why five?
Because they were five elements.  So they

17:35.010 --> 17:41.590
were the causal of the five elements so He
married five wives.  Now he had sixteen thousand

17:41.590 --> 17:44.660
powers.

17:44.660 --> 17:50.810
Now you see a man, he may be old, even about
ninety years of age, if he wants to keep some

17:50.810 --> 17:57.880
women around him, they will say he is a bad
man.  Not with a Mother, no, Mother can have

17:57.880 --> 18:02.500
as many as She likes, nobody is going to say
anything about Her character, because Mother

18:02.500 --> 18:10.780
is Mother. But a man, see, he might be absolutely
jumping into his grave, whatever it is.

18:10.780 --> 18:16.190
And there also, in India especially, if a
lady tries to help him out, to be out of the

18:16.190 --> 18:20.950
grave, they will say he had bad relations
with her.

18:20.950 --> 18:26.870
So it was such a bad situation at that time
that He didn’t want to have bad name.

18:26.870 --> 18:31.870
So He said, “What should we do about these
powers, because they’ll be women?  If they

18:31.870 --> 18:36.980
have to come on this earth, they’ll be women
and I don’t want to have bad name,” because

18:36.980 --> 18:45.180
He came for dharma.  So what He did that
these women became the princesses, and one

18:45.180 --> 18:53.520
king captured all of them.  All these sixteen
thousand women were under the capture of this

18:53.520 --> 19:04.220
man and this man was about to abuse them,
so Shri Krishna invaded that man and got hold

19:04.220 --> 19:10.560
of all these.

19:10.560 --> 19:27.820
So

19:27.820 --> 19:45.390
the

19:45.390 --> 19:51.890
sixteen thousand women which were captured
by this camp - imagine why should it be sixteen

19:51.890 --> 19:57.810
thousand?  Imagine sixteen thousand women,
it’s no easy thing to do.  This man had

19:57.810 --> 20:05.230
sixteen thousand women who succumbed to his
aggression and were there.  And then He attacked

20:05.230 --> 20:12.110
this man and captured those sixteen thousand
women and brought them and legally married

20:12.110 --> 20:16.610
them to show they were married. But what’s
the question of marriage because they were

20:16.610 --> 20:25.880
His powers?  And He used their powers, you
see. For what? For creating so many things,

20:25.880 --> 20:34.300
like if Shri Krishna had not come we would
not have known really the significance of

20:34.300 --> 20:37.320
spiritual life.

20:37.320 --> 20:44.551
He was the first who talked of spiritual life.
Rama did not talk of spiritual life, though

20:44.551 --> 20:49.040
there was an undercurrent in India.  People
knew there is spiritual life because there

20:49.040 --> 20:58.890
were saints, there were lots of what you call
the seers.  All of them were talking about

20:58.890 --> 21:07.420
it. But no incarnation talked about spiritual
life.    We had Rama Avatara, then we had

21:07.420 --> 21:12.280
Parashurama.  We had so many of these people.
Never, never they talked of spiritual life,

21:12.280 --> 21:20.400
never.  It was Shri Krishna only who first
started talking about spiritual life, and

21:20.400 --> 21:25.650
only to Arjuna He talked, because you see
what was the condition.  People were not

21:25.650 --> 21:30.970
prepared.  So those people, Sahaja Yogis,
who feel frustrated today because there are

21:30.970 --> 21:35.840
not many Sahaja Yogis or there is an obstruction,
there are certain problems, must know that

21:35.840 --> 21:42.810
at the time of Shri Krishna He could dare
speak about spirituality only to one person

21:42.810 --> 21:52.540
and that one was Arjuna.  So, I mean, we
are much better off, you see, aren’t we?

21:52.540 --> 22:00.630
Then, of course, of course after Shri Krishna,
who took the lead was Christ and He started

22:00.630 --> 22:09.110
talking about spirituality.  Even you’ll
be surprised that Abraham or Moses did not

22:09.110 --> 22:19.400
talk of spirituality.  They talked of God,
but not of spirituality. Till Christ came,

22:19.400 --> 22:24.840
nobody said that you are to be born again,
even on the other side of the world, only

22:24.840 --> 22:34.550
Shri Krishna said this thing.  Shri Rama
was taught by His guru that He should be born

22:34.550 --> 22:40.700
again, in the sense that what is the Kundalini
and all that, not that He should be born again.

22:40.700 --> 22:47.111
But He had become a human being, as I told
you. So he taught Him about Kundalini, he

22:47.111 --> 22:53.560
told Him about Kundalini but it was a very
secret science followed by only very nath

22:53.560 --> 23:00.820
pundits as we call them, as the Adi Nath and
all that.  Very few people were given Realization.

23:00.820 --> 23:07.610
In Rama’s time as we know of one, Nachiketa,
and His father-in-law was a realized soul,

23:07.610 --> 23:13.580
so compared to that, imagine how many of
us are today here who know about spirituality.

23:13.580 --> 23:20.510
Not only we feel our spirituality, we are
spiritual.  If you apply law of chance, I

23:20.510 --> 23:29.710
don’t think there could have been after
Christ even thirty people available, because

23:29.710 --> 23:36.900
if you see Christ died only two thousand years
back.  From Krishna’s time to Christ’s

23:36.900 --> 23:47.020
time it was six thousand years, and in six
thousand years Krishna had none and Christ

23:47.020 --> 23:57.920
had twelve, so now calculate only two thousand
years after that, how many could be?

23:57.920 --> 24:07.600
So we must know that it’s now in a new explosion,
that’s why I call it as “blossom time,”

24:07.600 --> 24:14.160
that we are definitely spiritual people, we
have got spirituality and that the Divine

24:14.160 --> 24:19.980
is working. So the Kali Yuga is finishing,
now it is Krita Yuga and the Krita Yuga is

24:19.980 --> 24:28.990
acting and this acting of Krita Yuga is responsible
for giving us so many Sahaja Yogis.  Krita

24:28.990 --> 24:37.060
Yuga means in the time when this all-pervading
Power has started acting.  Nobody before

24:37.060 --> 24:48.580
felt the cool vibrations, can you believe
that?  They felt the cool but not the vibrations.

24:48.580 --> 24:58.230
It was never related to any science; it was
never related to physical science specially.

24:58.230 --> 25:08.610
So I must say the achievement of Sahaja Yoga
is tremendous.   Also, thanks to this evolution

25:08.610 --> 25:24.560
in the acting of Yugas, also, that the all-pervading
Power has started acting as I am on this earth.

25:24.560 --> 25:27.910
But you could say that “Mother, why didn’t
You come earlier?”   That was not the

25:27.910 --> 25:34.760
time.  Even today you find stupid people
all around us.  I mean the percentage of

25:34.760 --> 25:42.460
sensible people seems to be quite low in the
western countries, though high up in others,

25:42.460 --> 25:47.290
but in the western countries very low, as
far as the wisdom is concerned.

25:47.290 --> 25:50.680
So we have these obstructions, these small
things going on, doesn’t matter.  Sahaja

25:50.680 --> 25:59.580
Yoga will now prosper.  It will flower and
whatever people may say, you shouldn’t worry,

25:59.580 --> 26:08.120
because once they start finding joy and happiness,
once they start finding the truth, and if

26:08.120 --> 26:12.730
they are honest, they will not leave Sahaja
Yoga. And many people know that they just

26:12.730 --> 26:17.000
don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.  I mean,
say there is a husband and wife, and the wife

26:17.000 --> 26:21.340
is a horrible woman, supposing, or the husband
is a horrible person and he obstructs the

26:21.340 --> 26:27.090
wife from coming to Sahaja Yoga, the husband
will say, “All right, you go ahead, I will

26:27.090 --> 26:33.030
be with Sahaja Yoga because I have now felt
the ambrosia, I have felt the beauty, the

26:33.030 --> 26:35.980
joy.”

26:35.980 --> 26:43.520
Now imagine at the time of Shri Krishna, He
talked to one person about the spirituality,

26:43.520 --> 26:53.050
only one person, Arjuna, which was heard by
Sanjaya and which he related.  It is so written

26:53.050 --> 27:02.420
by Vyasa, but He didn’t tell to everyone,
didn’t show to anyone.  He appeared in

27:02.420 --> 27:11.920
His Virata form on the battlefield but He
never showed, but now you have got photographs

27:11.920 --> 27:17.910
to see, even if you can’t see with your
eyes.  Some can see some things also, I’ve

27:17.910 --> 27:23.250
seen that some are feeling it. So you are
developing, you are growing into it.   So

27:23.250 --> 27:29.940
this is into a new realm.  It was Shri Krishna
Who started talking about it.  Of course

27:29.940 --> 27:34.680
these nath pundits did believe in all that
spirituality, but they did not talk about

27:34.680 --> 27:43.230
it, till the time, I think, of Gyaneshwara,
perhaps would be.  It was first the Gyaneshwara

27:43.230 --> 27:49.070
only who started talking about it.  Before
that it was a secret kept.  Of course after

27:49.070 --> 27:57.580
Gyaneshwara we had other people talking about
it, like we had Mohammed Sahib, we had Nanaka,

27:57.580 --> 28:05.530
we had so many other people like Shirdi Sai
Nath and some Sufi people and they started

28:05.530 --> 28:10.680
talking on spirituality.

28:10.680 --> 28:20.500
So we have to be historically very much thankful
to Krishna because He is the One who has broken

28:20.500 --> 28:25.300
the first knot and that’s why it’s called
as Vishnu Granthi and the Vishnu Granthi to

28:25.300 --> 28:36.190
knowledge has been first opened by Shri Krishna
and He wanted that gradually it should work,

28:36.190 --> 28:48.250
gradually.  So His Gita is not so clear cut,
but is diplomatically written.  So now we

28:48.250 --> 28:55.720
can find that the only person who first tried
his hand on Gita was Gyanadeva and Gyanadeva,

28:55.720 --> 29:01.120
when he wrote on the sixth chapter, everything
about Kundalini, they just said, “This is

29:01.120 --> 29:10.081
banned, you are not to read this one,” because
they could not deliver the goods.  People

29:10.081 --> 29:16.100
knew about Kundalini, but they didn’t want
to read because they were told, “No, No,

29:16.100 --> 29:21.540
don’t read, this is very wrong,” and all
that.

29:21.540 --> 29:30.510
So spirituality is a subject absolutely unknown
to the western people, though Christ was there

29:30.510 --> 29:39.110
but they have been only crucifying Him.
If I see the Christianity, if I see Christ,

29:39.110 --> 29:46.060
it’s so organized.  From Christianity nobody
can get out.  Whatever sin you may commit,

29:46.060 --> 29:54.030
you are still a Christian.  I know there
was a fellow who murdered someone and he was

29:54.030 --> 29:55.030
taken to the courts.

29:55.030 --> 29:56.700
They said, “What are you?”

29:56.700 --> 29:59.770
And he said, “I am a Christian,” though
he had murdered.

29:59.770 --> 30:03.531
Then they gave him the Bible, “All right,
put your hand on the Bible and say you are

30:03.531 --> 30:07.050
a Christian.”

30:07.050 --> 30:12.260
He said, “I am a Christian, I believe in
Bible.” But why didn’t they ask, “Why

30:12.260 --> 30:17.630
did you kill then?”  Thou shalt not kill.

30:17.630 --> 30:24.250
So even these religions which were formed
did not have any rules or regulations that

30:24.250 --> 30:30.700
“All right, if somebody does like that we’ll
throw him out of our congregation or he is

30:30.700 --> 30:37.120
no more a Christian.”  On the contrary,
you’ll be surprised that when My father

30:37.120 --> 30:48.200
joined Congress in India to fight against
the British, they threw him out of the congregation

30:48.200 --> 30:53.900
because according to the missionaries there,
Christ was born in England.  He must be

30:53.900 --> 31:02.100
an Englishman, so how dare My father join
the Congress?  Such an absurd idea!

31:02.100 --> 31:09.630
So all these ideas which are so absurd, against
God - against religion, against spirituality

31:09.630 --> 31:18.330
- became very prevalent and useful and convenient
for these organized religions.  That’s

31:18.330 --> 31:24.780
one thing good about Hindu religion is there
is nothing like a organization.  So they

31:24.780 --> 31:31.040
can be agnostic, atheist, they can be anything.
They could be Buddhist, they could be Jains.

31:31.040 --> 31:37.400
They could be anything and they could be Christians,
but they could be Hindus also because it’s

31:37.400 --> 31:43.141
not organized and because they are not organized,
there is no restriction on them that “Don’t

31:43.141 --> 31:48.290
do like this; don’t do like that.”  But
despite that I have seen, I’m surprised

31:48.290 --> 31:53.491
that Hindus are very meek people because the
responsibility is left to themselves, not

31:53.491 --> 31:58.800
on an organization.   If you have murdered
somebody you are not to confess to the priest

31:58.800 --> 32:05.600
but confess to yourself and face yourself
all the time. But so many filthy things crawled

32:05.600 --> 32:15.620
into this religion, also, of caste system
which is just against Shri Krishna.  They

32:15.620 --> 32:21.000
have no business to take Shri Krishna’s
name and do all these nonsensical things because

32:21.000 --> 32:29.040
Shri Krishna Himself has said that, “In
everybody it resides.” But they changed

32:29.040 --> 32:33.530
it a little, saying that, “Your caste is
according to your birth.”  How can it be?

32:33.530 --> 32:35.330
 As I told you the other day.

32:35.330 --> 32:50.090
Now this is another story I would say that
they have tried to, Christ look like something

32:50.090 --> 32:55.160
very ordinary or even Shri Krishna look like
something ordinary.  These are the intellectuals.

32:55.160 --> 33:01.110
So on one side we have the stupid followers
and the another side we have those stupid

33:01.110 --> 33:13.040
intellectuals.  So the message of Krishna
never reached Hindus because He said, “In

33:13.040 --> 33:18.720
everybody resides the Spirit and you are part
and parcel of the whole.”   Now a cell

33:18.720 --> 33:30.150
in the hand, is it an outcast because it is
not in the brain?  So what a wrong thing

33:30.150 --> 33:39.170
they have done to Shri Krishna and that’s
why when they suffer from racialism, I say,

33:39.170 --> 33:46.320
“You did the same to the caste, through
your caste system you tortured the Harigans,

33:46.320 --> 33:56.780
you tortured the lower caste of people.
So now you have them.”  It boomerangs,

33:56.780 --> 33:58.729
whole thing.

33:58.729 --> 34:06.969
So Shri Krishna’s life, if you see, is the
beauty of it is that He said that “Life

34:06.969 --> 34:18.310
is a leela” - for Him, not for everyone,
because He is so powerful. And this leela

34:18.310 --> 34:25.199
part was taken over by Americans very nicely
because they were born in the land of Shri

34:25.199 --> 34:30.090
Krishna, that it’s all leela. “What’s
wrong? Do what you like, what’s wrong?”

34:30.090 --> 34:35.650
Whatever you are doing is just a leela, is
just a play. So what?   Marry as many as

34:35.650 --> 34:41.140
you like, leave your children to dogs, do
all kinds of things with your morality, destroy

34:41.140 --> 34:48.100
yourself morning till evening, behave in the
same manner as if they are animals. So what?

34:48.100 --> 34:51.831
Study the animal behavior because it’s as
if we have no sense of behavior, so we study

34:51.831 --> 34:55.939
the animal behavior and behave like the animals.

34:55.939 --> 35:02.790
So are we going to become now snakes or some
sort of worms or I don’t know what they

35:02.790 --> 35:15.580
are up to, and whole system is just the opposite
of Shri Krishna.  So this stupid movement

35:15.580 --> 35:22.360
of Shri Krishna’s consciousness reached
there.  I don’t know how they understood

35:22.360 --> 35:28.210
that Shri Krishna is the deity of America,
but somehow some bhoot must have told them

35:28.210 --> 35:35.470
that “You go there.”  And they are another
stupid people who are selling Gita, selling

35:35.470 --> 35:46.110
this bookish knowledge, but now of course
it has boomeranged on him and now they are

35:46.110 --> 35:56.439
all right.  Now they are frozen. But the
way they have been talking about Shri Krishna,

35:56.439 --> 36:02.240
they do not realize they have missed the point.
He said, “It’s a leela.” So then why

36:02.240 --> 36:07.140
are you wearing these dresses, why have you
become a sanyasi?  Why are you giving up

36:07.140 --> 36:16.310
- not to eat this food, not to eat that food?
And then they are taking drugs, they are selling

36:16.310 --> 36:17.310
drugs.

36:17.310 --> 36:25.580
Whatever is not based on truth will go to
something that is destructive.  Truth is

36:25.580 --> 36:32.420
the only thing that is constructive.  All
these ideas sometimes confuse us, what is

36:32.420 --> 36:37.330
this, in the name of God, in the name of Shri
Krishna, in the name of Christ, in the name

36:37.330 --> 36:46.220
of Mohammed Sahib all these things are done
and also some people do it even in My name,

36:46.220 --> 36:53.170
“Mother said; Mother said so.”  It is
prohibited for Sahaja yogi to say that because

36:53.170 --> 37:00.750
I’ve had enough of it in last lives.
So this life nobody is going to say, “Mother

37:00.750 --> 37:03.650
said it.”

37:03.650 --> 37:13.000
“I say.” Have that much confidence and
responsibility to say, “I say.”   I

37:13.000 --> 37:18.840
am a Sahaja Yogi, you are a Sahaja Yogi, why
can’t you say?

37:18.840 --> 37:28.370
So now from today’s Puja onward we have
awakened the Shri Krishna within us, so His

37:28.370 --> 37:35.781
powers of sweetness as well of destruction
will act and you don’t have to worry, you

37:35.781 --> 37:39.470
are completely protected.  He has already
said that “Yoga dakshemo myam.”  “I

37:39.470 --> 37:46.820
give you yoga” and the “dakshemo myam”
means your benevolence, He looks after.

37:46.820 --> 37:58.540
So you don’t have to worry, but it will
act and it will work and nobody can harm you.

37:58.540 --> 38:08.260
It will all boomerang on them.  There’s
like divine punishment and you don’t have

38:08.260 --> 38:15.400
to worry.  Of course, as a Mother, I never
feel of punishing anyone, as such, but they

38:15.400 --> 38:22.350
just get punished, what can I do?  And now
this awakening can be very dangerous, so I

38:22.350 --> 38:30.490
think we have to accept it now within ourselves
that we have to be extremely sweet, nice,

38:30.490 --> 38:31.490
collective.

38:31.490 --> 38:37.070
If you are not collective then Krishna will
be after your life.  If you try to destroy

38:37.070 --> 38:41.280
collectivity He will be after you, I mean
He is a tremendous person, I tell you.  He

38:41.280 --> 38:47.700
is so tricky, He is so clever, and He is a
very smooth worker, I tell you.  So be careful.

38:47.700 --> 38:53.950
If you are collective then He’ll strengthen
you, He’ll nourish you, He’ll do everything,

38:53.950 --> 39:01.730
He’ll give you butter to eat.  So you have
to be collective, that’s the main part.

39:01.730 --> 39:06.630
And those people who just come to the program
and then disappear should know that it won’t

39:06.630 --> 39:12.010
work out.  You have to be collective and
if they don’t want to be collective, we

39:12.010 --> 39:17.130
don’t want to force them. But if they are
not collective they are not Sahaja Yogis and

39:17.130 --> 39:23.290
nobody should recommend them to anyone and
Sahaja Yogis should have nothing to do with

39:23.290 --> 39:32.500
non-collective people nor with people who
are not Sahaja Yogis.

39:32.500 --> 39:36.590
We have very beautiful children here, we have
beautiful families.   We have everything

39:36.590 --> 39:42.820
so beautiful, such beautiful people to love
each other and enjoy each other.  So we should

39:42.820 --> 39:49.430
not get entangled into the mess of other people
who are blind.  It would be like we have

39:49.430 --> 39:54.300
a nice organized place where everybody is
sitting in the light, suddenly you want to

39:54.300 --> 40:01.960
go to the place where there are many snakes
inhabited who are biting everyone.  So go

40:01.960 --> 40:07.080
ahead and then you shouldn’t say that “Mother,
you punished me.”   You wanted to go into

40:07.080 --> 40:14.820
the hell of the snakes, so you go and have
it.  I never punish. But maybe Shri Krishna

40:14.820 --> 40:24.120
might lure you there, you see that’s His
style, just to have a little bite of a snake.

40:24.120 --> 40:30.230
So according to Shri Krishna, we have to be
very playful.  Now we are all realized people,

40:30.230 --> 40:36.350
and you are very happy and you are all very
playful and joyous and also now you are so

40:36.350 --> 40:43.640
capable, you have spirituality, you can give
Realization to others.  Even I was told that

40:43.640 --> 40:51.830
in the streets people ask for Realization,
some people went to Eastern Blocs and they

40:51.830 --> 40:59.281
got five thousand people.  Somebody went
down to Argentina, got so many people.  So

40:59.281 --> 41:04.550
it’s very good, all these, My hands are
extending and the work is taking place.

41:04.550 --> 41:06.100
Everybody should take it up.

41:06.100 --> 41:09.870
Select a place and I’ll go there and work
it out.  Select one place and work it out,

41:09.870 --> 41:15.649
all of you can do it because you have now
got the powers, better work it out, use them.

41:15.649 --> 41:20.439
If you don’t use the powers, you’ll become
blunt, so use your powers and believe that

41:20.439 --> 41:26.150
you have power and that only thing you have
to keep in the bounds, in the maryadas of

41:26.150 --> 41:36.130
Sahaja Yoga, that you have to lead a very
moral, good life and you must feel your vibrations

41:36.130 --> 41:44.860
properly and keep good health which you can
easily do.  If, as they say, I can work like

41:44.860 --> 41:49.540
this, days in, day out, you can also work.
You are all very young, everybody seems to

41:49.540 --> 41:57.420
be younger than Me.  I am the oldest person
here.   So if I could do so much, why can’t

41:57.420 --> 41:58.420
you?

41:58.420 --> 42:02.480
So one thing you must ask in your prayer in
the evening when you are sleeping: “What

42:02.480 --> 42:08.670
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?” One sentence,
all of you, just ask this question: “What

42:08.670 --> 42:21.010
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”   Like persons
like Me or Shri Krishna or anyone, We don’t

42:21.010 --> 42:25.700
even feel We are doing anything.  So what
can We ask?   If I want to ask Myself, I’ll

42:25.700 --> 42:30.460
fall into an ocean I think, I don’t know,
I’ll be lost.  If I want to analyze Myself, I

42:30.460 --> 42:35.430
get lost.  If I want to think about Myself,
I get lost.  It’s beyond Me, then let it

42:35.430 --> 42:44.550
be, doesn’t matter.  I don’t want to
know Myself. But you better know yourself.

42:44.550 --> 42:46.700
You can’t be Me.

42:46.700 --> 42:55.470
So as far as I am concerned I only think that
as long as I live - I don’t know, I may

42:55.470 --> 43:01.020
live forever, I am living forever maybe, you
might say that, but whatever it is as long

43:01.020 --> 43:22.330
as I’m on this earth I will see that Sahaja
Yoga is fully established.  This is My promise

43:22.330 --> 43:23.340
to you.

43:23.340 --> 43:24.340
[Maharathi]

43:24.340 --> 43:30.700
He comes on this earth again to establish
the religion, but not only religion but Vishwa

43:30.700 --> 43:36.970
Nirmala Dharma, which is a much higher religion
than the ordinary religion of human beings.

43:36.970 --> 43:37.970
within themselves, is the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma
we’ll establish in a very short time, I’m

43:37.970 --> 43:38.970
sure, on this earth.

43:38.970 --> 43:39.970
So may God bless you!

43:39.970 --> 43:40.970
So today the children are sleeping now – if
they can get up for a while they can come

43:40.970 --> 43:41.970
and wash My feet.  How many are awake?
Some are awake.  You can sing some Ganesha

43:41.970 --> 43:42.970
song instead of Atharva Sheersha.
(break in recording)

43:42.970 --> 43:43.970
…. no provision for this kind of acceptance
of these ornaments, but when he came he just

43:43.970 --> 43:44.970
tried to take everything that was in that
temple.  At that time the story was created,

43:44.970 --> 43:45.970
I don’t know how far it is true, but a story
of Indians, you see, Indian style.  The story

43:45.970 --> 43:46.970
was like this: that when Mahadeva was attacked
by him, He started running away from the temple.

43:46.970 --> 43:47.970
He was running, running, running, running
fast and then He found Bhairava sitting there.

43:47.970 --> 43:48.970
So Bhairava and Hanumana both were sitting
and They said, “You are the Devas of Devas,

43:48.970 --> 43:49.970
You are the Mahadeva of Devas and why are
You running?  After all, what is he, this

43:49.970 --> 43:50.970
Tamolang?  Why running? He was lame with
one foot and why are you running away from

43:50.970 --> 43:51.970
him? You can just finish him off; what is
the need to run away?”

43:51.970 --> 43:52.970
No, he was Mohammed Gazni. Sorry, he was Mohammed
Gazni who did it, but  Tamolanga also attacked

43:52.970 --> 43:53.970
but then Mohammed Gazni. So this Mohammed
Gazni was running after Mahadeva, and first Tamolanga

43:53.970 --> 43:54.970
has looted but he couldn’t go to that far,
so this Mohammed Gazni came in and he started

43:54.970 --> 43:55.970
looting that temple.  So then when he started
running after Mahadeva, Mahadeva told him,

43:55.970 --> 43:56.970
“You don’t know, you don’t know this
Mohammed Gazni, who is. His name is Mohammed

43:56.970 --> 43:57.970
Gazni but he is somebody else.”

43:57.970 --> 43:58.970
Said, “Who is he?”

43:58.970 --> 43:59.970
“All right, come, you hide here, I’ll
show you.”

43:59.970 --> 44:00.970
So behind Mahadeva was running Mohammed Gazni,
so they hid themselves on one side and they

44:00.970 --> 44:01.970
saw this Mohammed Gazni came and he was very
tired.  He sat down near one tree and he

44:01.970 --> 44:02.970
started just relaxing, and suddenly they found
it was Shri Krishna.  He said, “This valundar,”

44:02.970 --> 44:03.970
means this, this cunning fellow, “is running
after me, now do you think I may escape him?

44:03.970 --> 44:04.970
Of course I should have punished these Brahmins
who were misbehaving.  I did not so, he has

44:04.970 --> 44:05.970
come, but now I cannot help so I am away out
of it, you see, because this one has come

44:05.970 --> 44:06.970
after My life and now you cannot save yourself.”

44:06.970 --> 44:07.970
So this is the story the people, the general
public, created there.  So it has happened

44:07.970 --> 44:08.970
many a times because He was the brother of
the Shakti of Shiva and because He’s so

44:08.970 --> 44:09.970
clever, he’s so intelligent that Shiva was
quite afraid of Him, and overactive.   So

44:09.970 --> 44:10.970
you see Americans are extremely active people
and now, of course, England, we need not say.

44:10.970 --> 44:11.970
It’s a little lethargic, little bit, not
much.  So now the awakening of Shri Krishna

44:11.970 --> 44:12.970
is going to work everywhere, and you are all
going to be extremely active about Sahaja

44:12.970 --> 44:13.970
Yoga, I think so.  This is a new thing that
has happened, and I’m very happy it has

44:13.970 --> 44:14.970
happened and that the Americans also agreed
to come here.  By this we take a little bit

44:14.970 --> 44:15.970
of the qualities of Shiva to America, that
is of magnanimity and also of laziness a little

44:15.970 --> 44:16.970
bit, and give some qualities of Shri Krishna
to this country.  This exchanges it.

44:16.970 --> 44:17.970
Shri Krishna Puja 1990: Shri Mataji speaks
about the music to be played by the musicians.

44:17.970 --> 44:18.970
Below is a transcription of the relevant details.

44:18.970 --> 44:19.970
Now the last raga is Bhairavi has to be played
under all traditional ways and is a raga that

44:19.970 --> 44:20.970
is in praise of the power of the Spirit, because
it has such beautiful notes and notes which

44:20.970 --> 44:21.970
are … it’s a complete sampurna, is a complete
raga. All the twelve notes are in it. So you

44:21.970 --> 44:22.970
see it is such a complete raga and it has
to be played in all due respect to it. It’s

44:22.970 --> 44:23.970
a ragini, regarded as.

44:23.970 --> 44:24.970
Now as you know that the Heart Chakra has
got twelve petals, and the Durga resides on

44:24.970 --> 44:25.970
the Heart Chakra. Now the Durga’s qualities
are that She is protective of Her children,

44:25.970 --> 44:26.970
She’s very gentle, very soft with Her children,
and She’s extremely horrifying to the satanic

44:26.970 --> 44:27.970
people, to the negative people. So in this
raga I think because there are, the notes

44:27.970 --> 44:28.970
are spaced out. So either you could play it
slow or you could play it fast. Nothing in

44:28.970 --> 44:29.970
between. That’s why it is on a Durga’s
style. You see, either She is extremely gentle

44:29.970 --> 44:30.970
or She is extremely horrifying. So because
She has a double function: is one to look

44:30.970 --> 44:31.970
after Her children, and another is protect
Her children from the devils. So She has to

44:31.970 --> 44:32.970
be very quick about it, to fight them, and
to, in every way to frighten them and to be

44:32.970 --> 44:33.970
alert about it.

44:33.970 --> 44:34.970
So in the second part you all became very
alerted I saw. In the first part you were

44:34.970 --> 44:35.970
having a lullaby because it was the Mother’s
love that was playing. The second part you

44:35.970 --> 44:36.970
became alert, because She has to fight. Now,
this is such a nice raga because it gives

44:36.970 --> 44:37.970
you a better sense of security within yourself,
builds up sense of security, and also as you

44:37.970 --> 44:38.970
know medically that it’s important to build
up this chakra because that gives you antibodies

44:38.970 --> 44:39.970
created. So to fight all the diseases, to
fight all the foreign things which try to

44:39.970 --> 44:40.970
attack us.

44:40.970 --> 44:41.970
So this raga is so apt, absolutely apt for
today’s atmosphere and for today’s need.

44:41.970 --> 44:42.970
That we have to have the security of the Mother
and the protection of the Mother and that

44:42.970 --> 44:43.970
all the evil forces must be finished from
this world, and that’s how this raga has

44:43.970 --> 44:44.970
a very great significance and I thank him
very much for playing this raga.

44:44.970 --> 44:45.970
This is, now the last five minutes he would
like to play is the Bhairavi which is a complete

44:45.970 --> 44:46.970
raga as you can call it, is the complete purnima.
All the notes are there. And it is played

44:46.970 --> 44:47.970
in various ways and various styles and is
used for so many expressions of your feelings

44:47.970 --> 44:48.970
and thing. But in this also there’s a beautiful
song as you know, the Anhi Bhavani, is the

44:48.970 --> 44:49.970
one which is a song about the Mother Goddess.
And in this Anhi Bhavani, I think there is

44:49.970 --> 44:50.970
a little mixture in the … I don’t know
if it is absolutely pure Bhairavi or not.

44:50.970 --> 44:51.970
Shri Mataji asks musicians: It is to be played
absolutely in Shuddha Bhairavi?

44:51.970 --> 44:52.970
(Shri Mataji and musicians discuss together
a little then She asserts ... )

44:52.970 --> 44:53.970
It should be played in pure Bhairavi – this
is the best way. Because Bhairavi is the name

44:53.970 --> 44:54.970
of the Goddess.

44:54.970 --> 44:55.970
You see the purity of it creates that feeling
and that, I mean, it awakens that deity so

44:55.970 --> 44:56.970
that you get that effect with the Bhairavi.

44:56.970 --> 44:57.970
(Shri Mataji and musicians talk together then
She continues ... )

44:57.970 --> 44:58.970
Indian music has such a lot of freedom, such
a lot of freedom. You can do what you like

44:58.970 --> 44:59.970
with it. But only thing is you have to keep
to the ragas and you have to keep to the Swaras

44:59.970 --> 45:00.970
and everything. You cannot just go crazy from
one to another like that. So it is like a

45:00.970 --> 45:01.970
big aeroplane which is going in the air with
everything completely fixed properly. You

45:01.970 --> 45:02.970
see, so it can go anywhere. Unless and until
it’s fixed, has it’s own maryadas it cannot

45:02.970 --> 45:03.970
go. So that has to be there. So first the
ragas are built, and built in such a way they

45:03.970 --> 45:04.970
are absolutely perfect and then you can go
wherever you feel like. Nothing will happen.

45:04.970 --> 45:05.970
(More discussion with musicians.)

45:05.970 --> 45:06.970
(Raga begins. Shri Mataji continues ...)

45:06.970 --> 45:07.970
First, he will play all the twelve notes which
are built in Bhairavi and then you will see

45:07.970 --> 45:08.970
how he keeps to that. He keeps to that

45:08.970 --> 45:09.970
Wow, wow! It’s the Heart Chakra. It’s
the Heart Chakra of Shiva.

45:09.970 --> 45:10.970
(Musicians continue to play.)

45:10.970 --> 45:11.970
The surrendering, you see. Islam is surrender.
Islam is the surrender.

45:11.970 --> 45:12.970
(Musicians continue to play.)

45:12.970 --> 45:13.970
Musician: In India it used to be different
about thirty or forty years ago, this is the

45:13.970 --> 45:14.970
kind of music we used to have, when people
would sit like you are, here, so nice, so

45:14.970 --> 45:15.970
beautiful, a family.

45:15.970 --> 45:16.970
Shri Mataji: Absolutely a family rapport.

45:16.970 --> 45:17.970
Musician: Absolutely

45:17.970 --> 45:18.970
Musician: You bring out that from us.

45:18.970 --> 45:19.970
Shri Mataji: You see what he’s saying is
this. You know I am such an old woman of sixty-seven

45:19.970 --> 45:20.970
years and I think of My childhood and also
of My family. My father was a great, great

45:20.970 --> 45:21.970
connoisseur of music and he supported music,
and musicians left and right, and we heard

45:21.970 --> 45:22.970
all the musicians because they would come
to our house, stay with us and he would go

45:22.970 --> 45:23.970
all out to spend for them, pay for them; I
mean, do all kinds of things. So in the family

45:23.970 --> 45:24.970
the music came in and then My sister took
to music and everybody in family took to music

45:24.970 --> 45:25.970
quite a lot because of My father because he
was fond of cricket and also of music very

45:25.970 --> 45:26.970
much. But the best part of it, what I am feeling,
all the family would sit down and then My

45:26.970 --> 45:27.970
sister would sing or anybody, you see the
rapport. Then he would give the, what you

45:27.970 --> 45:28.970
call, the impetus, he would give us the feelings
of: “Now, this is it now coming up.”

45:28.970 --> 45:29.970
There’s such a rapport in the whole thing
between the musician and all, and with such

45:29.970 --> 45:30.970
relaxation everybody appreciating it and just
like waves after waves of a big ocean coming

45:30.970 --> 45:31.970
over and that sort of a thing it was. And
then only you can enjoy music. But if you

45:31.970 --> 45:32.970
are worried about time, this, that… we give
up all that to listen to music. And even if

45:32.970 --> 45:33.970
you carry all that load with you, what’s
the use of listening to music? You have to

45:33.970 --> 45:34.970
come to music with all these things left out
and then you really enjoy the whole thing.

45:34.970 --> 45:35.970
And that is what today I feel that our whole
family of Sahaja Yogis are enjoying this rapport

45:35.970 --> 45:36.970
with him and enjoying the whole beauty of
the whole music, it’s something so great.

45:36.970 --> 45:37.970
But see the surrendering, you just develop
the feeling what you get out of it, you see

45:37.970 --> 45:38.970
like….

45:38.970 --> 45:38.972
(Music continues.)
