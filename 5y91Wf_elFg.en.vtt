00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:12.558
There are so many Deities who are 
working out things out for you.

00:00:12.558 --> 00:00:17.840
But you have to be, you have to be, extremely careful

00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.001
that you do not develop this fear business.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.800
Because fear takes you to the Left side 
and once you go to the left side,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.276
you know the problems of the Left side is 
– first of all -you go against Ganesha.

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:32.477
Ganesha is standing at the base of the Left.

00:00:32.477 --> 00:00:36.800
And then you develop cancers, you develop 
all these things, fear, fear, fear

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.397
and emotional problems and all these things come.

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:44.276
In emotions you should be bubbling with joy.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:48.880
Joy is your emotion.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.961
In action you should be thoughtless.

00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:59.437
And in ascent you should be surrendered.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:04.074
That’s all, it’s very simple, three mantras 
are very simple for children.

00:01:04.074 --> 00:01:05.176
They are like that.

00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:12.121
But in a deeper way, if you see who is Shri Ganesha,

00:01:14.282 --> 00:01:18.363
He is the child of Adi Shakti.

00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:24.403
She created Him from the Aumkara.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:28.645
Now, Aumkara is the Logos, as you call it, is the first sound

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:39.161
when Sadashiva and Adi Shakti separated, for creation.

00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:46.403
That sound is used as Aumkara which are vibrations,

00:01:49.161 --> 00:02:00.645
which have light in it. They have 
all the causals of all the elements,

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:04.323
only on the right side.

00:02:04.403 --> 00:02:10.806
Then left side, it has the power of your emotions.

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:15.121
In the centre it has the power of your ascent.

00:02:15.524 --> 00:02:25.927
So it's a very powerful deity we have and He's playful.

00:02:26.968 --> 00:02:32.847
Children are seldom cruel. He's not cruel,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.323
but if anything is done against the Mother, 
then He goes all wild.

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:49.806
Then He punishes and that is how 
the divine justice is brought to people.

00:02:53.968 --> 00:02:59.202
Thus, if we surrender to Shri Ganesh, He protects us,

00:02:59.443 --> 00:03:04.403
He gives us wisdom, He gives a proper understanding,

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.645
the protocol of the Mother.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.927
He does not know any other deity but His Mother.

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:18.726
He doesn't bother about any other deity but His Mother,

00:03:20.202 --> 00:03:23.726
and He knows that She’s the most powerful deity.

00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:31.081
And this is His wisdom, which must be imbibed.

00:03:31.161 --> 00:03:35.645
When you pray, you must try to imbibe that.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:46.403
For many people are still in the West 
anxious to copy other people,

00:03:47.685 --> 00:03:51.443
fall back into the wrong ideas,

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:59.242
which have really kept them away from the Truth.

00:03:59.847 --> 00:04:03.040
Thank God you all have come out of it

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:08.645
and when you see the hell into which 
the Western society has fallen,

00:04:08.887 --> 00:04:15.242
you try to understand and enjoy that you are 
at a different state altogether.

00:04:15.403 --> 00:04:20.000
But still, among you there will be some 
who will be dangling.

00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:22.847
Try to pull them out, not to throw them inside

00:04:22.927 --> 00:04:24.685
and go also with them.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.524
If you sympathize with them, you’ll go down with them.

00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:31.363
Try to pull them out and tell them that „you have to come out“.

00:04:31.564 --> 00:04:35.564
It maybe little painful to them, doesn’t matter, but they’ll be saved.

00:04:35.645 --> 00:04:41.202
So you are here as saviours and 
you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

00:04:41.282 --> 00:04:44.040
which is to be used. So today's Puja

00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:47.524
is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that:

00:04:47.605 --> 00:04:55.605
„Shri Ganesha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.887
that You manifest within ourselves.

00:04:58.968 --> 00:05:03.323
Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings

00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:07.766
and all these wrong ideas we have

00:05:07.927 --> 00:05:11.363
or all the wrong life we have had,

00:05:11.605 --> 00:05:18.927
should just disappear like thin air, 
and let the beautiful moonlight

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.685
of your soothing qualities of innocence 
be manifested through us.”

00:05:26.847 --> 00:05:29.443
Let us manifest these qualities.

00:05:32.028 --> 00:05:37.109
So, that is how you have to be honest, 
in the essence of it,

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:43.754
and the essence of honesty is innocence.

00:05:46.592 --> 00:05:48.713
Essence of sincerity is innocence.

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:54.471
Essence of beauty, glory, is innocence,

00:05:58.592 --> 00:06:04.149
and innocence is the one that gives you complete detachment.

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.552
So, to such a symbol of innocence, when we bow,

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:14.633
we must know what we have done about ourselves.

00:06:21.794 --> 00:06:26.189
Whatever has been your past, get out of it.

00:06:30.915 --> 00:06:34.875
Be just the opposite of what has been so bad before.

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:44.794
Strongly against all that you were before, in the darkness.

00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:51.760
And the another point is that:
how much magnetism you have?

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.097
So you reverse back to yourself.

00:06:54.177 --> 00:06:59.636
The magnetism is a magic, is a magic of a person.

00:06:59.716 --> 00:07:03.103
A person is magnetic because he has certain magic.

00:07:03.183 --> 00:07:10.077
Now this magic is, comes, from your own personality. 
From your own personality.

00:07:10.158 --> 00:07:14.326
The basis of magnetism, on the left hand side, starts.

00:07:14.406 --> 00:07:18.014
And that basis is Shri Ganesha.

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.792
Shri Ganesha is the basis of that magnetism.

00:07:20.878 --> 00:07:25.635
So you're innocent. Innocence is 
the best way to have that magnetism.

00:07:25.715 --> 00:07:28.948
Magnetism you cannot express in material way.

00:07:29.028 --> 00:07:34.796
It's not a material stuff but it is something abstract,

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:39.013
comes from your quality of Ganesha, Shri Ganesha.

00:07:39.094 --> 00:07:41.563
Such a person is magnetic.

00:07:41.643 --> 00:07:45.732
Magnetic means that such a person attracts other person

00:07:45.812 --> 00:07:49.433
because of the weight of the person,

00:07:49.513 --> 00:07:53.449
because of the quality of the person. Such a person attracts.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.856
But does not attract for lust, greed and nonsensical things.

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:04.570
But attracts another person because of 
the fragrance of love in the subjects.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:07.889
Now it is always confused. Confused!.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.083
Because it's such an abstract thing so 
one must understand it in a very subtle way.

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:15.340
What is this magnetism? That one should understand.

00:08:15.553 --> 00:08:18.933
Now a Ganesha person is not a person

00:08:19.038 --> 00:08:24.040
who is absolutely a remorse type

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:30.013
or a person who is such a gone case that even if you beat him up

00:08:30.093 --> 00:08:37.354
and make him into a complete minced thing, 
he will bear it. It's not like that!

00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:42.435
It's not that. On the contrary the quality of magnetism is such

00:08:42.515 --> 00:08:48.915
that it attracts you, to a point where you are not disturbed.

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:51.828
Now this is a very important point we should know.

00:08:51.909 --> 00:08:57.449
You see, if you have other loves, love 
like carnal love and all other love you have,

00:08:57.548 --> 00:09:02.123
then that love you may attract the person. 
That person can destroy you

00:09:02.203 --> 00:09:05.249
and it destroys you, always.

00:09:05.329 --> 00:09:10.785
But this attraction does not destroy, does not destroy.

00:09:10.865 --> 00:09:15.311
The attraction is up to that point that you are not destroyed,

00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:19.898
because you being much higher, much deeper and much weightier,

00:09:19.978 --> 00:09:23.563
you cannot be destroyed by a thing that you are attracting.

00:09:23.644 --> 00:09:28.351
Always the greater magnet attracts the smaller magnet.

00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:30.603
And that is what one should understand.

00:09:30.684 --> 00:09:38.507
This magic and this karishma, the charismatic 
temperament of a person

00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:43.180
comes by, first of all, the Ganesh tattwa, innocence.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:49.577
And secondly by complete dedication and devotion.

00:09:49.658 --> 00:09:54.811
Those who are completely dedicated 
and devoted to Mother.

00:09:54.891 --> 00:09:56.905
Not to anything else.

00:09:56.985 --> 00:09:58.498
Ganesh tattwa again.

00:09:58.578 --> 00:10:03.655
Not to your wife, not to your husband, 
not to your sister, not to your country,

00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:07.108
not to anyone but to Mother.

00:10:07.188 --> 00:10:15.332
Complete dedication gives you that charisma,

00:10:15.412 --> 00:10:18.011
or that attraction.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.920
Now how innocence develops in a person is by not thinking about it.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.725
Like, you see, somebody asked me,

00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:32.389
'How do you manage your Income Tax?' 
I said, 'By having no income at all'.

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.182
Then they asked me, 'How do you solve your car problem?'

00:10:35.262 --> 00:10:37.561
"By not having any car at all of mine."

00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:41.080
They said, 'What about your house problem?" 
"By having no house of my own."

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.987
"Nihi, Nihi." Everything Nihi for me.

00:10:45.086 --> 00:10:48.462
Then how do you solve your this problem? 
By not having it,

00:10:48.542 --> 00:10:53.414
just have -- "No, not have it!" 
Don't take up headaches upon yourself.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:59.431
See when you take up headaches upon yourself 
then only the innocence is reduced.

00:10:59.512 --> 00:11:03.468
That headaches like this, "This is my shawl, this is my sari,

00:11:03.548 --> 00:11:07.035
this is my thing, this is this, this is this, this is this".

00:11:07.115 --> 00:11:11.277
But only one thing is that "This is my Mother

00:11:11.357 --> 00:11:17.645
and I have to proclaim Her", that's all.

00:11:17.725 --> 00:11:22.440
If that is the way it is, then innocence

00:11:22.547 --> 00:11:25.911
starts rising like Shri Ganesha,

00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:31.848
and by having no other headache. 
"This is mine, that is mine."

00:11:31.932 --> 00:11:34.526
This 'mine' business causes the problem, I think.

00:11:34.606 --> 00:11:37.046
Personally, I think this must be the reason.

00:11:37.126 --> 00:11:41.585
That this 'mine' business. 'This is mine.' 
Because whatever is mine.

00:11:41.665 --> 00:11:44.805
Somebody told me, this is very good 
argument he gave,

00:11:44.885 --> 00:11:48.755
"Whatever is mine is not I", means that is not Sahaja.

00:11:48.848 --> 00:11:52.652
My body, my head, my everything -- 'my'. But 'I'

00:11:52.732 --> 00:11:54.350
He gave me this idea -- 'I'.

00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:58.105
What is 'I'? Then 'I' is separating,

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:02.290
Whatever is not mine is 'I'. So what remains is your Spirit.

00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:06.200
Somebody gave me this argument. I said 
"Is a very good argument to work it out".

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.020
Then whatever remains is the 'I'

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.228
and that 'I' is the one we have to see!

00:12:15.308 --> 00:12:18.308
So you go on reducing all these 'mines', 'mines', 'mines'.

00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:22.710
So the pure spirit of innocence will rise.

00:12:23.401 --> 00:12:29.170
Spiritual person is just innocent, just innocent.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.914
There is no intelligence, nothing. Just innocent.

00:12:33.013 --> 00:12:36.642
The whole thing is innocence. 
See, whatever he talks or says,

00:12:36.722 --> 00:12:40.527
comes through innocence. It doesn't have intellect as such,

00:12:40.607 --> 00:12:43.047
which here people have through reading

00:12:43.127 --> 00:12:45.907
and through understanding and by analysing.

00:12:45.987 --> 00:12:51.560
Nothing of the kind. 
It just has pure and simple innocence.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.733
And it all works out very well. It is so clean.

00:12:55.826 --> 00:13:03.997
It just says what it knows and what it knows is the highest.

00:13:04.668 --> 00:13:10.142
So this deconditioning has to be brought within us.

00:13:10.222 --> 00:13:13.097
But you should not discuss it among yourselves also.

00:13:13.177 --> 00:13:17.289
Once you start discussing then you also, you see,

00:13:17.369 --> 00:13:22.141
it becomes sort of a theological argumentation.

00:13:22.221 --> 00:13:24.817
There is no theology about it. It's very simple.

00:13:24.897 --> 00:13:29.037
It's the simplest thing is to be innocent.

00:13:29.117 --> 00:13:31.897
But the innocence is lost. Why?

00:13:31.977 --> 00:13:36.636
Because our attention is in different way,
we are attentive to other things.

00:13:36.716 --> 00:13:39.096
We are looking at other things.

00:13:39.177 --> 00:13:41.377
It is so simple.

00:13:41.484 --> 00:13:47.755
So you can...it's like a fifth column, you see.

00:13:47.835 --> 00:13:50.817
The innocence is a fifth column within you.

00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:55.517
So if any person is innocent, you see he'll work on your fifth column

00:13:55.597 --> 00:13:58.817
and will make you all right. 
When you give bandhan to others,

00:13:58.897 --> 00:14:03.352
what happens, you actually bind him by your innocence

00:14:03.432 --> 00:14:05.375
and the poor fellow doesn't know.

00:14:05.455 --> 00:14:08.888
He has his innocence within him, you capture that innocence,

00:14:08.969 --> 00:14:11.697
that is all you have done, that's how you manage.

00:14:11.777 --> 00:14:14.438
It's very simple to work out things.

00:14:14.524 --> 00:14:21.016
Only principle, the tattwa, the whole thing rests on what?

00:14:21.096 --> 00:14:24.882
Tattwa is nothing but innocence.

00:14:24.942 --> 00:14:28.067
So try to develop this by all these things...

00:14:28.147 --> 00:14:30.687
"Ya neti, neti wachane nigamor awachus"

00:14:30.767 --> 00:14:34.320
By saying "Not this, not this, not this, not this, not this,"

00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:38.653
to all your thoughts. "Not this not this, not this, not this".

00:14:38.739 --> 00:14:44.489
You reach there. 'Not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine".

00:14:47.055 --> 00:14:51.625
And that is how it is. And you see the whole material world

00:14:51.705 --> 00:14:58.687
is now attacking the innocence, because they are frightened.

00:14:58.919 --> 00:15:03.170
You cannot attack it. Innocence cannot be destroyed. 
It cannot be destroyed.

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.411
Innocence is something [which] is all pervading

00:15:07.492 --> 00:15:09.166
and it cannot be destroyed.

00:15:09.247 --> 00:15:11.607
So whatever people may try, it cannot be destroyed.

00:15:11.687 --> 00:15:16.251
But it can be covered, it can recede,

00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:20.465
but it cannot be destroyed. It will act it's own way.

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:26.737
So try to develop that innocence which is 
the basis of Mahalakshmi Tattwa,

00:15:26.817 --> 00:15:31.449
we should say, or that is essence 
of Mahalakshmi tattva.

00:15:31.522 --> 00:15:36.856
So outwardly it is Mahalakshmi tattwa, but inside, inside is,

00:15:36.937 --> 00:15:38.630
we can say, there are three cores.

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.443
The first core is Mahalakshmi tattwa, 
outside to look at, you see the growth, all right.

00:15:43.523 --> 00:15:51.204
Then inside is the creation, that is all the elements 
being created and all that.

00:15:51.266 --> 00:16:00.557
But inside that is the desire and inside the desire
is the half one, you can say,

00:16:00.637 --> 00:16:04.717
is the Ganesha.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:09.287
So this Ganesh tattwa ultimately overpowers everything

00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:12.793
and permeates everything.

00:16:12.874 --> 00:16:17.222
And this is, I would say that, don't think about it.

00:16:17.302 --> 00:16:20.813
Just allow your innocence to grow,

00:16:20.907 --> 00:16:25.368
Simple innocence. And your dignity.

00:16:25.448 --> 00:16:27.829
That's very important to have your dignity.
