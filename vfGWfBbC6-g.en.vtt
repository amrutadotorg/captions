00:00:02.147 --> 00:00:07.336
Shri Ganesha Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 10 September 1995.

00:07:26.203 --> 00:07:30.559
With all the Ganapatis sitting around me

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:34.578
and you all the ganas sitting in front of me,

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.804
I don’t know what to say.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.027
It’s remarkable, very remarkable,

00:07:44.187 --> 00:07:48.965
because most of you come from a culture

00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:52.895
which has never shown any respect of Shri Ganesh.

00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:56.993
They never realised how important it was that,

00:07:57.492 --> 00:08:01.342
without Shri Ganesha’s qualities,

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:08.086
we cannot achieve anything in our life.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:18.297
The idea of everyday, moment-to-moment enjoyment has destroyed them.

00:08:18.648 --> 00:08:23.961
And also the desire to know the Divine

00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:35.875
vanishes also in the thin air

00:08:36.508 --> 00:08:42.430
because you get lost into this moment-to-moment enjoyment

00:08:43.672 --> 00:08:47.898
till you get destructive, completely destroyed.

00:08:48.523 --> 00:08:57.226
But I really don’t understand how you have achieved this state

00:08:57.531 --> 00:09:02.297
where you see [that] the purity is so important to life;

00:09:02.797 --> 00:09:11.257
that Ganesha’s qualities, His value system

00:09:12.663 --> 00:09:17.528
and His innocence are to be imbibed.

00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:31.875
I feel very gratified that such a thing has happened now in your lives

00:09:32.035 --> 00:09:37.820
and you all are so much in praise for Shri Ganesha.

00:09:40.656 --> 00:09:46.339
Shri Ganesha is there from our childhood.

00:09:46.499 --> 00:09:50.426
Yesterday you saw the children, how they were so beautiful

00:09:50.586 --> 00:09:53.098
and entertained us the most.

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:56.535
Everybody had a smile on their face and I said,

00:09:56.695 --> 00:10:01.521
“Don’t laugh,” because if you laugh they feel a little offended

00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:05.422
and they think that you are laughing at them.

00:10:09.156 --> 00:10:16.594
The enjoyment that we had from that drama of children

00:10:17.077 --> 00:10:23.144
was more than what one would expect

00:10:23.304 --> 00:10:28.414
from adults doing that kind of a drama just to entertain us.

00:10:28.574 --> 00:10:34.438
It might be some sort of a very subtle joy of Shri Ganesha

00:10:34.598 --> 00:10:36.895
that made us so happy.

00:10:37.676 --> 00:10:43.532
We all have Shri Ganesh settled very nicely within ourselves

00:10:43.692 --> 00:10:50.497
and, in you, awakened; awakened in such a manner

00:10:51.434 --> 00:10:56.360
that, in your free will also, you do not want to do things

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.442
that will go against Shri Ganesha.

00:11:01.512 --> 00:11:06.938
His manifestation within you is so evident.

00:11:07.098 --> 00:11:12.278
you see your faces – they are so beautifully shining,

00:11:12.723 --> 00:11:15.270
so very different from other people.

00:11:16.363 --> 00:11:19.731
One day I was travelling from London

00:11:20.457 --> 00:11:26.117
and there was one Indian lady who came to see me and she said,

00:11:26.277 --> 00:11:31.500
“I was surprised to see your disciples. Their faces were shining

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:39.402
with such light. I have never seen any disciples like that.”

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:44.953
I asked her, “Who are you?”

00:11:45.113 --> 00:11:48.984
She said, “I am married in Guru Nanak’s family

00:11:49.249 --> 00:11:54.766
and all the people in his family are just the opposite

00:11:54.926 --> 00:11:57.801
[of] what Guru Nanak was.”

00:11:59.957 --> 00:12:04.301
So I said, “Because they worship Shri Ganesha.”

00:12:05.356 --> 00:12:10.719
So she said that, “In our family nobody worships Shri Ganesh.”

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:14.074
I said, “It cannot be possible! How is it?”

00:12:14.887 --> 00:12:22.723
They believe in nirakar, in the formless God of chaitanya.

00:12:23.824 --> 00:12:27.746
I said, “But who is the source of that chaitanya?

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.899
Why don’t they find out who is the source?”

00:12:31.059 --> 00:12:35.992
So they said that Nanaka has only talked up to this point.

00:12:36.152 --> 00:12:38.918
He’s not talked about the source.

00:12:42.488 --> 00:12:45.442
I said, “Better find out,

00:12:45.988 --> 00:12:50.367
because in this book maybe some things have been taken away.”

00:12:50.527 --> 00:12:56.227
And then somebody gave me a passage where he had described

00:12:56.387 --> 00:13:00.348
the innocence, the Deity of Shri Ganesha also.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:08.129
He had described that the whole Creation was done by the Mother

00:13:08.473 --> 00:13:10.102
and not by the Father.

00:13:10.262 --> 00:13:13.196
It’s very surprising because nirakaris,

00:13:13.356 --> 00:13:18.617
those people, who don’t believe in the forms of God,

00:13:18.777 --> 00:13:22.063
always talk of Father, not of the Mother.

00:13:22.223 --> 00:13:33.832
It is true also about Christianity, also about Islam,

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:38.910
also about the Jews.

00:13:39.965 --> 00:13:45.344
All of them, they talk of the Father and not of the Mother,

00:13:45.504 --> 00:13:47.902
nor about Shri Ganesh.

00:13:49.683 --> 00:13:57.071
It seems, in the ancient times they believed in child God,

00:13:57.231 --> 00:14:04.891
even in China, even in Greece and also in many other countries

00:14:05.051 --> 00:14:10.692
who were supposed to be primitive. But they all believed in the child God.

00:14:14.027 --> 00:14:18.328
So now, when we deal with our children,

00:14:18.488 --> 00:14:24.375
we should know that they are just like Shri Ganesh:

00:14:24.535 --> 00:14:28.816
they are very innocent, very simple;

00:14:29.254 --> 00:14:34.836
except in cases sometimes [where] they are affected by some things

00:14:34.996 --> 00:14:37.691
and they lose their moorings.

00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:48.563
But Shri Ganesha’s greatest contribution to Sahaja Yoga is

00:14:48.723 --> 00:14:53.629
that He makes you feel My vibrations.

00:14:54.067 --> 00:15:01.364
He makes you feel the beauty of purity and simplicity.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:06.504
[It’s] only possible if Shri Ganesha is awakened within you.

00:15:07.784 --> 00:15:13.758
Also the Kundalini won’t rise without the sanction of this ‘chancellor’.

00:15:13.918 --> 00:15:17.215
He’s the one sitting on Mooladhara.

00:15:17.988 --> 00:15:21.644
But you should know He is on every chakra.

00:15:22.754 --> 00:15:32.211
Innocence cures all the maladies, physical, mental, emotional,

00:15:32.371 --> 00:15:34.644
specially the spiritual one.

00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:40.168
But Shri Ganesha’s quality, the most important, is

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:46.223
that He believes in emitting vibrations,

00:15:47.004 --> 00:15:53.754
He believes in projecting His vibrations to everyone.

00:15:54.629 --> 00:16:03.512
That is the quality now [that] I feel all of you, as Sahaja Yogis, can use.

00:16:05.098 --> 00:16:12.220
You got your Realisation without any effort I should say.

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:14.074
It was Sahaj.

00:16:14.699 --> 00:16:21.203
The life before Self-realisation was different.

00:16:21.363 --> 00:16:23.718
You got your transformation

00:16:23.878 --> 00:16:33.769
and you have jumped into the new era of Meta Science.

00:16:34.805 --> 00:16:37.305
But here now we have to see

00:16:37.465 --> 00:16:42.555
whatever we have got, what are we to do with it?

00:16:42.715 --> 00:16:47.494
You, of course, know that you have to give Realisations to others,

00:16:47.654 --> 00:16:55.875
you have to cure people, you have to love them

00:16:56.035 --> 00:16:58.641
and you have to be compassionate

00:16:58.801 --> 00:17:06.602
but apart from that, now the deliberations about yourself have to start.

00:17:06.762 --> 00:17:11.407
That is through Shri Ganesha’s powers that are within you.

00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:21.014
You should see that you can emit your powers your energy to others.

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:23.904
You can project it to others.

00:17:24.193 --> 00:17:32.216
Now, for example, If somebody comes to you, meets you,

00:17:33.302 --> 00:17:39.240
if you know how to deliberately project your energy.

00:17:40.107 --> 00:17:44.398
This is a new type of meditation you have to practise now:

00:17:44.558 --> 00:17:49.218
that to emit your energy, project your energy to others.

00:17:49.378 --> 00:17:52.749
You don’t have to say anything, you don’t have to talk

00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:57.406
but just feel deliberately – again I say deliberately.

00:17:57.566 --> 00:18:00.507
It’s not sahaj, it’s not spontaneous.

00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:02.851
This is what you have to practise,

00:18:03.011 --> 00:18:09.425
is to emit your energy of your innocence of Shri Ganesha to others

00:18:09.596 --> 00:18:15.178
so, when they see you, their innocence would be awakened.

00:18:16.052 --> 00:18:18.734
Now, for example, say

00:18:23.256 --> 00:18:28.778
we had some problems in London and Sahaj Yogis told me,

00:18:28.938 --> 00:18:32.695
“Mother, there are still some men are looking at us.”

00:18:32.855 --> 00:18:38.398
And some said that, “There are many women who are looking at us.”

00:18:38.558 --> 00:18:42.792
It was a mutual sort of a thing going on.

00:18:44.222 --> 00:18:52.011
I said, “You can project your energy in such a manner

00:18:52.902 --> 00:19:00.132
that that projection will stop all this kind of stupid behaviour of other people

00:19:00.292 --> 00:19:06.862
and also make them understand, respect you and feel your dignity.”

00:19:07.932 --> 00:19:09.863
Not very difficult.

00:19:10.214 --> 00:19:14.992
But, on the contrary, as the culture is

00:19:15.152 --> 00:19:20.957
to attract men and attract women it will diminish.

00:19:23.408 --> 00:19:26.281
The energy will diminish.

00:19:26.441 --> 00:19:33.394
When you feel your own dignity and serenity

00:19:34.495 --> 00:19:40.342
and [realise] that you are now Self-realised people,

00:19:40.502 --> 00:19:42.826
you are not ordinary people

00:19:42.986 --> 00:19:48.299
a kind of majestic personality develops within you.

00:19:49.041 --> 00:19:58.045
That majestic personality really can have a tremendous effect

00:19:58.205 --> 00:20:01.697
on the surrounding people – tremendous!

00:20:03.064 --> 00:20:06.818
It’s a kind of a deliberate projection you should start.

00:20:06.978 --> 00:20:12.874
I don’t know that side, that how to project it

00:20:13.034 --> 00:20:16.310
or how to deliberately do this.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.545
It’s just spontaneous with me, it just happens.

00:20:19.705 --> 00:20:23.162
But you can achieve it yourself with [a] little practice.

00:20:23.322 --> 00:20:35.498
Try to face such people, not with disdain or contempt,

00:20:35.658 --> 00:20:39.705
but just your majestic personality.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.564
This personality is here now, you see,

00:20:45.462 --> 00:20:49.204
is sitting in such a majestic manner

00:20:50.392 --> 00:20:56.490
and is also giving the vibrations to others.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:05.955
The whole figure is doing something suddenly to people.

00:21:08.277 --> 00:21:13.084
To expect that the whole world will change spontaneously,

00:21:13.244 --> 00:21:16.447
I don’t think is alright.

00:21:16.752 --> 00:21:22.021
Because, you know, the world is so chaotic, full of so much chaos,

00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:25.548
so much ego, so much conditioning.

00:21:26.095 --> 00:21:33.365
But something within you can rise above others

00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:43.947
with your sense of dignity, with your complete Selfhood,

00:21:44.384 --> 00:21:46.615
where you stand with yourself.

00:21:46.775 --> 00:21:50.552
You are not to be rude, you are not to be egoistical,

00:21:50.712 --> 00:21:55.357
you need not say things if you don’t want to say anything.

00:21:55.517 --> 00:22:03.564
Just that silent personality can emit such beautiful vibrations,

00:22:03.813 --> 00:22:08.831
which you have. You have stored up a lot of vibrations within yourself.

00:22:08.991 --> 00:22:15.600
And this storing up is showing on your faces, which I said are shining.

00:22:16.373 --> 00:22:19.211
But the innocence that you have,

00:22:20.094 --> 00:22:25.238
you have to be proud of it, very much proud of it.

00:22:25.398 --> 00:22:32.460
Even now sometimes you feel that people will say

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:36.428
you are not properly dressed up

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:39.964
or maybe you are ugly looking or all kinds of things

00:22:40.124 --> 00:22:43.230
that they expect every other person to be.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.424
It’s a funny thing that in this world

00:22:46.585 --> 00:22:49.933
all human beings expect others to be very good.

00:22:50.093 --> 00:22:52.410
Everybody should be a hero or something

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:55.261
– what about themselves they never think!

00:22:55.421 --> 00:22:58.613
So now you have become heroes in the sense that

00:22:58.773 --> 00:23:02.676
spiritually you are much higher than all of them.

00:23:02.836 --> 00:23:08.293
So this projection, when it starts – I am saying again ‘deliberate’ –

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:13.144
then you should not be afraid that, “I will develop my ego.”

00:23:13.304 --> 00:23:16.347
You should not be afraid that, “I’ll get some conditionings.”

00:23:16.507 --> 00:23:21.965
But just, in the way, with the understanding,

00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:28.230
that you have these powers within you, beautifully expressing themselves,

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.359
as a child does.

00:23:30.812 --> 00:23:36.488
If there is one child, it can entertain at least hundred people.

00:23:36.648 --> 00:23:40.840
What is so sweet about the child? Is the innocence:

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.769
the way he speaks, the way he talks, the way he behaves,

00:23:46.929 --> 00:23:51.316
the way he expresses his love. It’s so simple

00:23:51.476 --> 00:23:59.921
but it has something in the essence, this innocence of Shri Ganesha.

00:24:00.429 --> 00:24:05.832
Anywhere there’s a question of children,

00:24:05.992 --> 00:24:09.976
the whole world get worried about it,

00:24:10.234 --> 00:24:14.074
the whole world wants to solve the problem.

00:24:14.234 --> 00:24:20.410
If a child is in trouble, anywhere all over the world

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.558
it will be circulated that such and such a thing is happening

00:24:24.718 --> 00:24:28.801
to such a child and everybody will be worried.

00:24:28.961 --> 00:24:34.707
If they see a child anywhere, the faces change;

00:24:34.867 --> 00:24:39.301
you see the faces, the expression changes, automatically.

00:24:39.461 --> 00:24:43.828
Because that child is emitting that innocence;

00:24:44.343 --> 00:24:52.605
without any deliberations, without any special way of doing it,

00:24:52.765 --> 00:24:55.124
but just spontaneously.

00:24:55.992 --> 00:25:03.207
But then you grow, you start growing, growing with others

00:25:03.367 --> 00:25:07.105
who are also not innocent. You have to meet them.

00:25:07.265 --> 00:25:10.105
You can’t run away from the society.

00:25:10.265 --> 00:25:18.156
You start getting all the rapport with such people

00:25:18.515 --> 00:25:22.903
who are talking about things

00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:27.058
– actually, those who are criticising Shri Ganesha.

00:25:27.218 --> 00:25:31.226
Gradually, your innocence starts dying out

00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:36.465
and you feel sometimes inferior to all those

00:25:36.625 --> 00:25:42.469
who are supposed to be very great warriors against innocence.

00:25:44.351 --> 00:25:51.238
In the sense that – when I was in London

00:25:51.398 --> 00:25:55.832
I saw they all used to laugh at me because I had this kumkum.

00:25:55.992 --> 00:25:59.832
But I used to think they don’t know why I am wearing it.

00:25:59.992 --> 00:26:01.960
So, it’s so ignorant they are:

00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:05.715
very ignorant people that they don’t know in India

00:26:05.875 --> 00:26:08.840
all the married women have to wear this.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.324
Even the Muslims wear that; they also wear mangalsutra.

00:26:14.484 --> 00:26:16.066
So I said that,

00:26:16.226 --> 00:26:20.582
“This is just written down, on my head, that I am a married woman.”

00:26:20.742 --> 00:26:24.035
It’s just to tell people ‘don’t bother me.

00:26:24.195 --> 00:26:30.445
I have got my husband behind me and he can take you to task.’

00:26:31.468 --> 00:26:36.379
This kind of ignorance is so much in the West

00:26:36.539 --> 00:26:41.644
and still they think they are a higher race, they are greater people.

00:26:41.804 --> 00:26:46.343
They don’t know even small, small things about life.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.152
For the innocence, I think

00:26:50.312 --> 00:26:55.382
they have lost any knowledge about it, long time back.

00:26:57.538 --> 00:27:01.668
And that’s how it is a society, today,

00:27:01.828 --> 00:27:08.113
which has absolutely lost its own moorings.

00:27:08.273 --> 00:27:10.129
Every individual is separate,

00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:14.543
every individual is doing something and they don’t know each other.

00:27:14.703 --> 00:27:20.910
Without innocence you cannot have a rapport with other people.

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:25.324
Because that means you have some sort of a lust

00:27:25.484 --> 00:27:28.769
or greed behind the whole thing.

00:27:28.929 --> 00:27:34.426
So much so now, it’s become so boring the whole thing,

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:39.965
that even once I told this Sahaj Yogi that, if you are going there,

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:43.480
there’s a family and they have a daughter,

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:48.484
so just give this present to her – a simple thing!

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:54.472
Now this yogi was quite an elderly person, not a young boy.

00:27:54.632 --> 00:27:57.957
He said, “Mother, I’d better not go.” I said, “Why?”

00:27:58.117 --> 00:28:00.847
“Because they will misunderstand me.”

00:28:01.007 --> 00:28:02.691
“What will they misunderstand?”

00:28:02.851 --> 00:28:06.918
“Why am I giving a present to this girl?”

00:28:07.078 --> 00:28:09.754
I said, “But it’s I am giving. What is the harm?”

00:28:09.914 --> 00:28:13.480
“No!” That’s the psychology. He was himself a psychologist.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:18.019
That’s the psychology. “So I cannot take this present for that girl!”

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:22.918
I mean, I was [amazed]: for Indians, you don’t understand this kind of a fear.

00:28:23.078 --> 00:28:25.480
But then I noticed it’s too much

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:29.543
that they don’t want to be with any woman,

00:28:29.703 --> 00:28:32.691
they don’t want to be alone with any woman.

00:28:32.851 --> 00:28:36.511
And they said Mother, “You don’t know these women!

00:28:36.671 --> 00:28:39.980
They will make a rape case out of us!” “But how?”

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:49.652
“They do!” So the whole idea is to challenge the innocence of people.

00:28:49.812 --> 00:28:57.195
For that, I must say, they made this Freud into a god

00:28:57.445 --> 00:29:02.347
because of his writings. I don’t know how they accept, also, such writings.

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:04.574
I just can’t understand how they accept.

00:29:04.734 --> 00:29:10.304
Because I think they have no idea as to what they are.

00:29:10.937 --> 00:29:15.324
Somebody asked me about Freud, “Then what did he say?

00:29:15.484 --> 00:29:18.980
Why are people so much against him? Why are you so against?”

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.738
I said, “He said that there’s a bad relationship between the mother and the son.”

00:29:23.898 --> 00:29:29.566
He just jumped. “He said so? My goodness! Thank God he never came to India,

00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:34.996
otherwise we would have cut him into pieces and put them in the Indian Sea!”

00:29:35.156 --> 00:29:40.226
I said, “But why spoil the purity of Indian Sea also?”

00:29:42.202 --> 00:29:45.150
He was so annoyed and angry, he said,

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.479
“How could they tolerate such a nonsense?

00:29:47.639 --> 00:29:50.933
How could they accept such nonsense against the mother?

00:29:51.093 --> 00:29:55.379
They have no purity?” I said, “That’s the trouble with them.”

00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:58.569
Now the trouble is that the brain developed too much,

00:29:58.729 --> 00:30:03.444
ego developed too much and any such stupid idea

00:30:03.896 --> 00:30:09.070
– it’s much worse than stupid – was accepted.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:13.238
And that is how I find it’s so boring:

00:30:13.398 --> 00:30:21.491
every time anywhere you go it’s nothing but this sex business.

00:30:21.651 --> 00:30:25.558
It’s too much. I can’t understand how people go on tolerating.

00:30:25.718 --> 00:30:31.571
It’s alright, at the most, in some adult films you might show some nonsense,

00:30:31.731 --> 00:30:35.535
but every time you see something you find

00:30:35.695 --> 00:30:40.199
suddenly this kind of nonsensical scene is coming,

00:30:40.359 --> 00:30:43.926
this bedroom scenes, these scenes, and people like it.

00:30:44.086 --> 00:30:51.234
They pay for it. They want to have all aspects of it.

00:30:52.484 --> 00:30:57.512
It is such a natural thing. What is there to talk about it all the time?

00:30:57.672 --> 00:30:59.676
I don’t understand.

00:30:59.836 --> 00:31:03.918
It’s only the development of the brain, of such a manner,

00:31:04.078 --> 00:31:07.363
that every kind of nonsense it wants to accept.

00:31:07.523 --> 00:31:09.543
“So what? What’s wrong?”

00:31:09.703 --> 00:31:13.488
“Well, you’re mad! That’s what. You go to lunatic asylum.”

00:31:13.648 --> 00:31:17.293
Lunatics also talk like that. “So what’s wrong?”

00:31:17.453 --> 00:31:22.722
Same way. Because of such acceptance, they don’t know how much

00:31:22.882 --> 00:31:27.808
people have ruined their family life, their children’s life.

00:31:27.968 --> 00:31:34.113
In every way, we find that the whole society is full of this nonsense

00:31:34.273 --> 00:31:39.074
and specially in the television – Italy specially.

00:31:39.234 --> 00:31:44.672
I mean, certain buttons you should not press,

00:31:45.827 --> 00:31:47.332
you should be very careful,

00:31:47.492 --> 00:31:50.268
otherwise you don’t know what you face and you go for vomiting.

00:31:50.428 --> 00:31:54.578
You see, as Indians – first reaction is to vomit.

00:31:56.054 --> 00:32:04.621
But for people who have not yet realized the value of this innocence

00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:11.008
can be easily taken up by this kind of nonsense that’s going on.

00:32:13.539 --> 00:32:17.801
Whatever it is, through the blessings of Shri Ganesha,

00:32:17.961 --> 00:32:25.195
you are all transformed. You are on a different line.

00:32:26.273 --> 00:32:31.347
Yesterday these two musicians were surprised how you were praising Ganesha.

00:32:31.507 --> 00:32:35.433
They couldn’t believe it, how you could praise Shri Ganesh,

00:32:35.593 --> 00:32:39.957
because you haven’t even heard the name of Shri Ganesha before

00:32:40.117 --> 00:32:44.855
I said, “They see what Shri Ganesha has done to them,

00:32:45.015 --> 00:32:50.011
how He has made their attention so beautiful

00:32:50.171 --> 00:32:54.347
that they enjoy all the beautiful things of the world,

00:32:54.507 --> 00:32:57.843
all the innocent things of the world.”

00:32:58.179 --> 00:33:02.902
And there are many people like them, I can tell you, who are struggling.

00:33:03.062 --> 00:33:06.262
Not that all the society has accepted this nonsense.

00:33:06.422 --> 00:33:07.988
There are many who are struggling

00:33:08.148 --> 00:33:13.465
because I know in England they published a book about what children have to say

00:33:13.625 --> 00:33:17.514
about the politicians: very sweet, sweet things, very sweet.

00:33:17.673 --> 00:33:21.221
And those books [that] were published were five thousand books because

00:33:21.382 --> 00:33:24.668
if you publish five thousand, you get it cheaper or something like that.

00:33:24.828 --> 00:33:29.406
And in one day all the books were sold out – in one day.

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:35.301
That shows that there are so many people still

00:33:35.461 --> 00:33:40.996
who are respecting their innocence and they want to be innocent

00:33:41.156 --> 00:33:42.755
and they want to enjoy it.

00:33:42.915 --> 00:33:46.254
But a society has to be created of that kind.

00:33:46.414 --> 00:33:51.644
For that, you must have a kind of a personality.

00:33:51.804 --> 00:33:59.015
You know that I was in London and once I went to Greece.

00:33:59.437 --> 00:34:02.232
And the ministers’ wives also came to meet me.

00:34:02.392 --> 00:34:05.299
I was surprised. Normally they don’t do. So they said,

00:34:05.459 --> 00:34:10.387
“You see, our husbands told us if you want to see serenity personified,

00:34:10.547 --> 00:34:14.328
then you must see Mrs. Shrivastava.”

00:34:14.836 --> 00:34:19.113
I was surprised [that] in Greece they are talking of serenity!

00:34:19.273 --> 00:34:23.832
In these modern times anybody talking about purity!

00:34:23.992 --> 00:34:27.707
I just couldn’t understand, but I felt at the back of their mind

00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:34.426
their tradition, whatever it is, these men could see

00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:38.246
that simple thing in me and they went and told them.

00:34:38.406 --> 00:34:40.618
And they all enjoyed my company very much.

00:34:40.778 --> 00:34:43.863
I was making them laugh and telling them things and all that.

00:34:44.023 --> 00:34:46.379
And one of them then turned around and said,

00:34:46.539 --> 00:34:49.980
“Mrs. Shrivastava, you are just like a child!” “I said, “Really?”

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.222
“No, we enjoyed your company so much!”

00:34:52.382 --> 00:34:55.051
And when I was coming, they were in tears.

00:34:55.211 --> 00:35:00.340
So what I am saying that: whatever innocent personality you have,

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.176
you have to project now, to project towards others.

00:35:04.336 --> 00:35:08.074
Say somebody is trying to be funny with you

00:35:08.234 --> 00:35:11.066
just with one glance you can put that person right,

00:35:11.226 --> 00:35:16.566
that you don’t like it. Just to say you don’t like it.

00:35:16.726 --> 00:35:19.867
In a way that’s a projection.

00:35:20.742 --> 00:35:24.754
Around your society, around where you are working,

00:35:24.914 --> 00:35:30.058
you will also find people who have no sense of innocence.

00:35:30.218 --> 00:35:33.387
And it’s disgusting to be with them.

00:35:33.547 --> 00:35:39.222
But as you have powers, you must use [them] – is to project.

00:35:39.382 --> 00:35:43.066
I see with Sahaja Yogis, they don’t even cure people.

00:35:43.226 --> 00:35:47.222
They’ll tell me, “Mother, he is to be cured. That is to be done.”

00:35:47.382 --> 00:35:50.488
But you are so many, why do you need me to do that now?

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:54.433
You all can cure a patient. You can help the patient.

00:35:54.593 --> 00:35:58.949
Why can’t you do it? What is the need for me to do it?

00:35:59.109 --> 00:36:02.715
You have those qualities within you

00:36:02.875 --> 00:36:06.191
because potentially you had them before

00:36:06.351 --> 00:36:10.590
and now they are enlightened through the grace of Shri Ganesha.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:14.719
Now, what you have to do is to assert them.

00:36:16.297 --> 00:36:22.113
In that, of course, you must remember not to use your ego,

00:36:22.273 --> 00:36:26.363
not to use your mind. So somebody would say that,

00:36:26.523 --> 00:36:31.183
“Mother, without mind how can you impress others?

00:36:31.343 --> 00:36:34.918
How can you have a rapport with others?” It’s very simple.

00:36:35.078 --> 00:36:38.754
Just go thoughtless. Once you are thoughtless,

00:36:38.914 --> 00:36:44.738
you are in the Realm of the Divine, and then the Divine takes charge.

00:36:44.898 --> 00:36:48.519
And it will start emitting such beautiful vibrations

00:36:48.679 --> 00:36:53.715
that you will be amazed at yourself how things are working out.

00:36:53.875 --> 00:36:57.344
It is not a coincidence we should say.

00:36:58.218 --> 00:37:03.269
Like once I was going somewhere and they told me that,

00:37:03.429 --> 00:37:06.855
“You have to be very careful!” I said, “Why?”

00:37:07.015 --> 00:37:10.558
“Because in the night, you see, these Naxalites (Indian communists) are here

00:37:10.718 --> 00:37:13.822
and they might just kill you.” I said, “It’s alright!”

00:37:13.982 --> 00:37:17.562
He said, “No, it’s very late. You be careful!”

00:37:18.648 --> 00:37:21.714
So, the gentleman with me was very much worried.

00:37:21.874 --> 00:37:24.176
He said, “You take out your ornaments, everything.”

00:37:24.336 --> 00:37:27.477
He put them under the seat and did all that.

00:37:28.703 --> 00:37:34.472
So, as soon as we reached that place where many Naxalites were standing

00:37:34.632 --> 00:37:38.405
with their lanterns and with their sticks,

00:37:39.882 --> 00:37:43.863
so I told the driver that, “For one minute you stop the car.”

00:37:44.023 --> 00:37:46.587
He said, “No, I will not!” “No, you stop!”

00:37:46.747 --> 00:37:51.457
I looked at them and I don’t know what happened – they just moved on.

00:37:51.617 --> 00:37:54.472
I said, “Now speed up the car.”

00:37:54.632 --> 00:37:56.918
You see, it is the power that you have.

00:37:57.078 --> 00:38:01.898
Unless and until you use this power of love and compassion,

00:38:02.195 --> 00:38:09.468
you will not know what you have got. And that comes from your Shri Ganesh.

00:38:09.734 --> 00:38:13.406
You see, how children understand love.

00:38:13.741 --> 00:38:19.319
If you are nice to them, how they react. Maybe sometimes they do not,

00:38:19.479 --> 00:38:25.257
but ninety-nine percent [of] children, I have seen, they really react to love.

00:38:25.734 --> 00:38:30.496
In our school in Dharamsala there were two children

00:38:30.656 --> 00:38:35.207
and they were very troublesome to begin with

00:38:35.367 --> 00:38:38.154
and the parents were worried about them.

00:38:38.314 --> 00:38:40.656
They sent them to Dharamsala

00:38:41.617 --> 00:38:45.691
and otherwise they were very demanding as the modern children are.

00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:49.363
“You buy this. You buy that. Go here. We want MacDonald!”

00:38:49.523 --> 00:38:54.074
This, that was going on. When they went to the school for one year,

00:38:54.234 --> 00:38:57.051
they came back and the parents asked them,

00:38:57.211 --> 00:38:59.989
“Now, what do you want?” They said, “We don’t want anything!”

00:39:00.149 --> 00:39:03.139
“You don’t want anything? You want to go to MacDonald’s?”

00:39:03.299 --> 00:39:06.160
They were American. “No, no, we don’t want to go to MacDonald.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:12.203
We want to sit here and watch Mother’s videos.”

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:16.201
They said, “Suddenly, what has happened to them? They were so troublesome.

00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:21.066
Why are they now so much changed? What’s the matter with them?”

00:39:21.226 --> 00:39:24.597
So then they said, “What about food? Whatever you cook, we’ll eat.

00:39:24.757 --> 00:39:25.965
We are not bothered.”

00:39:26.125 --> 00:39:29.004
And they were amazed how these children had changed!

00:39:29.164 --> 00:39:31.426
But then they said, “We must go out somewhere.

00:39:31.586 --> 00:39:34.137
We must see the river, we must see the mountain.”

00:39:34.297 --> 00:39:38.176
“Alright, that we’ll do.” Then again they came home

00:39:38.336 --> 00:39:42.301
– no demands, nothing. They didn’t want to go for any shopping

00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:46.294
or asking for any shirts or blouse or nothing.

00:39:46.454 --> 00:39:51.602
Very much satisfied, dignified.

00:39:52.539 --> 00:39:56.989
So they said, “What’s the matter with you? You don’t want anything?”

00:39:57.149 --> 00:39:59.910
“No we want something but we don’t know how to tell you.”

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.812
“What is it?” “Because you don’t have that.

00:40:02.972 --> 00:40:05.595
You can’t get it in the market.” “Well, what is it?”

00:40:05.755 --> 00:40:10.324
They said, “Can you get us a pendant of Shri Mataji?”

00:40:10.484 --> 00:40:13.961
So sweetly, you know, they said. That’s all.

00:40:14.469 --> 00:40:16.871
But they said, “You don’t have?” “No, we don’t have any.”

00:40:17.031 --> 00:40:20.653
“So you just get us the pendant of Shri Mataji, that’s all.”

00:40:20.813 --> 00:40:28.623
I mean so deep expression. You don’t want anything else.

00:40:29.406 --> 00:40:32.332
I mean, I know the children, I have met them,

00:40:32.492 --> 00:40:34.692
but I have not been with them for a long time,

00:40:34.852 --> 00:40:37.202
I have never been so close to them, nothing,

00:40:37.362 --> 00:40:41.680
but look at the love that they have.

00:40:41.906 --> 00:40:45.192
And they were telling me in the school in the beginning

00:40:45.352 --> 00:40:48.270
that anybody goes to trouble us, we said,

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.481
“Now we are going to inform Shri Mataji!”

00:40:50.641 --> 00:40:53.723
“No, no, no, don’t inform Her.” “Why?”

00:40:53.883 --> 00:40:58.293
“Because She will not love me any more!” Can you imagine?

00:40:58.453 --> 00:41:05.067
The value of my love is so much understood by these little, little children

00:41:05.227 --> 00:41:11.364
and so much they admire, they want it.

00:41:11.524 --> 00:41:17.449
It has no material gain by that, nothing.

00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:22.427
All this really shows that Christ as He has said it, that,

00:41:22.587 --> 00:41:26.554
“You have to be like small children to enter into the Kingdom of God.”

00:41:26.714 --> 00:41:30.043
Without that, you cannot enjoy anything.

00:41:30.203 --> 00:41:34.207
Like yesterday’s programme was really, I must say

00:41:34.367 --> 00:41:36.056
– these Swiss have worked very hard.

00:41:36.216 --> 00:41:39.028
They are very hard working I know, but not to this extent

00:41:39.188 --> 00:41:44.899
that they started singing Indian music so well in such a combination

00:41:46.305 --> 00:41:49.285
and we enjoyed all that very much.

00:41:49.445 --> 00:41:55.961
Now imagine these Swiss who are overactive, always working,

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:02.926
they have no time to think about creating something innocent,

00:42:03.086 --> 00:42:07.938
creating something sweet of this kind.

00:42:08.149 --> 00:42:13.043
And the way they did it shows, really, that they love Shri Ganesha

00:42:13.203 --> 00:42:20.215
and they understand the value of Shri Ganesha’s manifestation in them.

00:42:20.375 --> 00:42:25.153
I was really surprised how they could learn all this Indian music

00:42:25.313 --> 00:42:28.738
and so many sitting together and singing that song.

00:42:28.898 --> 00:42:31.942
And there were some Indians, I said, “Can you sing like this?”

00:42:32.102 --> 00:42:34.660
They said, “No.” I said, “Look at these Swiss.”

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:38.949
This is the power of Shri Ganesha’s love.

00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:43.973
Because they were to celebrate Shri Ganesha’s birthday,

00:42:44.133 --> 00:42:48.528
so they got equipped from within.

00:42:48.688 --> 00:42:53.254
But if they had not projected it there would have been nothing.

00:42:53.414 --> 00:42:57.137
So whatever He is giving you, whatever He is creating in you,

00:42:57.297 --> 00:43:04.621
this beautiful innocence, this beautiful fragrance of your living,

00:43:04.781 --> 00:43:07.551
every moment, when you are enjoying it,

00:43:07.711 --> 00:43:10.801
also know that we have to give it to others.

00:43:10.961 --> 00:43:15.324
We have to pour this into others.

00:43:15.484 --> 00:43:18.809
And it will work out, I know it will work out.

00:43:18.969 --> 00:43:22.762
It is so tremendous. His powers are so tremendous.

00:43:22.922 --> 00:43:28.090
Yesterday you saw that in the children’s program

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:33.035
that nobody could beat him, even Shiva, anyone.

00:43:33.195 --> 00:43:37.301
And Shiva had to cut His head

00:43:37.461 --> 00:43:41.949
because He didn’t know how to overpower Him otherwise.

00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:47.971
This is what we have to understand, that if you are innocent,

00:43:48.131 --> 00:43:52.153
nobody can cheat us, nobody can trouble us,

00:43:52.313 --> 00:43:56.762
because in innocence you become a person

00:43:56.922 --> 00:44:00.332
who doesn’t care for what is happening to you.

00:44:00.492 --> 00:44:04.630
You become a person who tolerates everything thinking these are…

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:10.399
you don’t even think, you feel they are something, stupid people, that’s all.

00:44:11.203 --> 00:44:17.012
It is a story about a king in China, as I am going to China.

00:44:17.172 --> 00:44:18.582
There was a king in China.

00:44:18.742 --> 00:44:22.403
They are very wise people, I must say Chinese are extremely wise.

00:44:22.563 --> 00:44:32.903
And he decided to win a cocks’ fight. It’s a cocks’ fight.

00:44:33.063 --> 00:44:37.336
Imagine the king thinking like that! But it’s all child’s play.

00:44:37.922 --> 00:44:41.293
So he went to one great saint and told him that,

00:44:41.453 --> 00:44:46.426
“How will you train a cock to fight the other cocks?”

00:44:46.586 --> 00:44:48.528
He said, “Leave the cock with me.”

00:44:48.688 --> 00:44:54.567
So he left the cock there and he trained him very well

00:44:54.727 --> 00:44:59.319
because when the king arrived after one month before the fight,

00:44:59.479 --> 00:45:02.155
he said, “See now, take this cock it’s your one.”

00:45:02.315 --> 00:45:06.155
He said, “This one? This one is not doing anything, just standing straight.

00:45:06.315 --> 00:45:09.889
He said, “Yes, yes. That’s it. You take it.”

00:45:10.049 --> 00:45:17.994
So he took that cock and put him in that contest.

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:21.432
So all the cocks were together.

00:45:21.979 --> 00:45:26.178
They started troubling this cock, which was just standing like this as if,

00:45:26.338 --> 00:45:29.561
“Some stupid people are trying to trouble me.”

00:45:29.721 --> 00:45:32.791
He wouldn’t touch them, he wouldn’t react, nothing of the kind,

00:45:32.951 --> 00:45:35.053
he was just standing straight.

00:45:35.213 --> 00:45:39.717
So all the cocks were surprised that, “This one is not protesting.

00:45:39.877 --> 00:45:45.038
He’s just bearing up everything and he’s not bothered as to what we are doing.”

00:45:45.198 --> 00:45:49.366
One by one all the cocks disappeared from the field

00:45:49.526 --> 00:45:53.045
where they were having these fights.

00:45:53.205 --> 00:45:57.518
And this was the only cock which stood up.

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:03.381
So the king was surprised. He took him to the saint and he said,

00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:08.053
“This one has become a saint now. So it’s better you keep it with you!”

00:46:08.213 --> 00:46:12.419
He’s such a saint that they were all trying to trouble him and he was least bothered.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.804
He was looking like this, left side, right side, both sides.

00:46:15.964 --> 00:46:20.264
He thought, “What’s going on with these people? Why are they behaving like this?”

00:46:20.424 --> 00:46:25.006
So this is what I have to tell you that your personality itself

00:46:25.166 --> 00:46:30.768
is made like that and now you worship Him so much [that] He’s within you.

00:46:30.928 --> 00:46:40.362
And any kind of problems that you have will be really solved very easily

00:46:40.522 --> 00:46:43.585
if you take to your innocence.

00:46:44.014 --> 00:46:48.909
And that will create coincidences, as they call it.

00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:54.452
But I would say it’s not coincidence, it’s the vibrations.

00:46:54.897 --> 00:46:58.416
And you’ll be amazed how things are solved.

00:46:58.576 --> 00:47:00.815
They’ll say, “Mother, this had happened, that had happened.”

00:47:00.975 --> 00:47:03.674
Now see, the other day, it rained so much.

00:47:03.834 --> 00:47:05.948
It rained so much so that they said,

00:47:06.108 --> 00:47:11.002
“It has become knee-deep mud here and Mother what are we to do?”

00:47:11.162 --> 00:47:13.399
I said, “It’s alright. Leave it to Him.”

00:47:13.559 --> 00:47:19.033
Next day it was very hot. Imagine underneath these things,

00:47:19.193 --> 00:47:25.233
the whole thing got dried out and today you are here for the puja.

00:47:25.764 --> 00:47:32.760
It’s an impossible thing that there could be such a change in the weather

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:38.053
that one day it rains so heavily and second day

00:47:38.295 --> 00:47:42.065
the whole thing gets absolutely dried out.

00:47:42.225 --> 00:47:47.588
It’s His work, because He’s so much powerful.

00:47:47.748 --> 00:47:53.671
You have come to worship Him, so first of all cleansing has to be done

00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:58.915
and He did the cleansing by putting the rain here.

00:47:59.075 --> 00:48:03.963
It’s so heavy rains and some of the part of the rains

00:48:04.123 --> 00:48:17.718
which came near this Palazzo Dorio they turned into ice (hail).

00:48:17.878 --> 00:48:20.212
I don’t know what is English word is [for] that.

00:48:20.372 --> 00:48:25.369
So they all started and the whole thing went round the house.

00:48:25.529 --> 00:48:32.112
They were all forming into little, little ice-balls, falling nearby.

00:48:33.177 --> 00:48:38.383
Now it is something unbelievable that all over it has just rained

00:48:38.543 --> 00:48:42.125
only near our house it is the ice-balls are coming.

00:48:42.285 --> 00:48:45.922
We can call it ‘miracles’, we can call it anything,

00:48:46.082 --> 00:48:50.914
but it is Shri Ganesha’s, we should say, sensitivity

00:48:51.074 --> 00:48:55.398
that He thought that, “Now this rain is going near my Mother’s house,

00:48:55.558 --> 00:49:00.672
so let us make some sort of a beautiful ice-balls.”

00:49:00.832 --> 00:49:03.961
And I went out and I saw, and I was amazed

00:49:04.121 --> 00:49:08.570
how it was all around my house [that] there were ice-balls.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:16.277
What He can do, what he’s capable is absolutely unbelievable.

00:49:16.933 --> 00:49:20.029
How He guides you and how He helps you.

00:49:20.189 --> 00:49:22.434
How He takes you to [the] right path.

00:49:22.594 --> 00:49:25.043
Not only that [but] how He protects you.

00:49:25.203 --> 00:49:30.418
All the time He is with you because you have become His ganas now.

00:49:30.578 --> 00:49:35.012
You are His ganas, so He protects you, looks after you,

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:40.137
gives you all the guidance. He takes you to the right path.

00:49:40.297 --> 00:49:44.504
He takes you to the righteous road.

00:49:44.664 --> 00:49:48.699
He gives you all that is dharmic to enjoy.

00:49:48.859 --> 00:49:51.410
You always meet friends here and there.

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:53.824
You think it’s a coincidence – it is not.

00:49:53.984 --> 00:49:56.426
And that is how He works.

00:49:56.586 --> 00:50:06.160
He works with all His beautiful, sweet, loving attention on you

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.801
because you are His ganas.

00:50:08.961 --> 00:50:11.844
But the ganas have to work!

00:50:13.187 --> 00:50:18.585
As I say that, in our body there are ganas

00:50:18.772 --> 00:50:27.230
and they fight the disease, they fight the problems that are in the body

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:33.340
those antibodies which are the ganas of Shri Ganesha.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.410
In the same way, you are also His ganas.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:39.871
He does all this for you. He protects you, He loves you,

00:50:40.031 --> 00:50:42.945
He gives you all the good time.

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:46.309
Then what are we doing about it?

00:50:46.469 --> 00:50:51.637
It should not be one-sided. When He does all this for you

00:50:51.797 --> 00:50:55.399
then what should we do about Shri Ganesh?

00:50:55.961 --> 00:50:59.824
What can we do as antibodies?

00:50:59.984 --> 00:51:11.736
You don’t have to fight the enemies with any sword or any kind of a weapon.

00:51:12.338 --> 00:51:18.759
The enemies you can conquer by simple, two, methods.

00:51:18.946 --> 00:51:25.381
One is try your love, your pure love on them. Try that.

00:51:25.541 --> 00:51:27.967
You may melt away many people.

00:51:28.127 --> 00:51:35.139
Or else, if that is not working, then what should you do

00:51:35.299 --> 00:51:39.951
is to sit down and meditate and give bandhans.

00:51:40.111 --> 00:51:43.707
There are ways of giving bandhans. The bandhan works so fast

00:51:43.868 --> 00:51:48.566
and so beautifully that you are amazed how it has worked!

00:51:48.727 --> 00:51:51.425
Because you are so powerful.

00:51:51.586 --> 00:51:54.677
The way you give bandhan, [if] anybody else can give

00:51:54.838 --> 00:52:00.115
it is not going to work! It’s only you, the Sahaj Yogis, can give bandhan.

00:52:00.275 --> 00:52:03.545
There are different types of bandhans you have to give.

00:52:03.705 --> 00:52:07.709
And all that works out so well.

00:52:07.869 --> 00:52:11.389
So we have to have now faith in our own powers

00:52:11.549 --> 00:52:17.405
and we have to know that we are now empowered by Shri Ganesha

00:52:17.565 --> 00:52:20.588
to do the work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:20.845 --> 00:52:25.733
To do the work of Sahaja Yoga is not to feel that you are doing it,

00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:28.893
but it is Shri Ganesh who is doing it.

00:52:30.244 --> 00:52:33.694
You will be surprised – giving Realisations to people

00:52:33.854 --> 00:52:37.518
is the greatest joy Sahaja Yogis can have.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:42.147
And then you don’t have to think that you have done it

00:52:42.307 --> 00:52:45.686
– then is the best – but if you think you have done it then,

00:52:45.846 --> 00:52:48.483
“I am very tired,” or “I have done this!”

00:52:48.643 --> 00:52:53.358
Many people come and tell me, “Mother, we have done this, we have done that!”

00:52:53.518 --> 00:52:58.722
That means they are just feeling the strain of doing any work.

00:53:00.026 --> 00:53:03.030
But you are not to feel any strain.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:07.436
His powers are within you, you can see it. Believe me!

00:53:07.596 --> 00:53:10.366
Believe in yourself. Have confidence in yourself

00:53:10.526 --> 00:53:12.811
– confidence and faith in yourself.

00:53:12.971 --> 00:53:17.928
And [know] that you are a storehouse of innocence

00:53:18.088 --> 00:53:21.822
which is nothing but compassion and love.

00:53:23.025 --> 00:53:24.905
If you have that faith

00:53:25.065 --> 00:53:30.401
you will definitely develop a beautiful way of talking to others,

00:53:31.939 --> 00:53:39.979
of having [a] relationship with others.

00:53:41.643 --> 00:53:49.127
It is something that is really a gift of Shri Ganesh.

00:53:50.197 --> 00:53:53.658
I don’t think I every shouted at anyone.

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:58.522
Even on my children, I have never shouted, never.

00:53:58.682 --> 00:54:01.905
I have never got into a fury or a temper

00:54:02.065 --> 00:54:04.248
because I think I can manage without it.

00:54:04.408 --> 00:54:08.272
Of course, I had to correct, I had to tell people.

00:54:08.432 --> 00:54:13.350
But one thing I have seen [is] that everybody has been afraid of one thing

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:17.936
– that somehow I should never drive out somebody from Sahaja Yoga,

00:54:18.096 --> 00:54:20.858
because Sahaja Yoga is such a joy,

00:54:21.018 --> 00:54:24.201
it is such an energy-giving thing,

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:33.861
it is such a light that you feel absolutely confident about yourself.

00:54:35.314 --> 00:54:37.889
So to ask you to leave Sahaja Yoga

00:54:38.049 --> 00:54:44.139
is the greatest punishment because you can’t leave me now.

00:54:44.299 --> 00:54:48.920
It’s difficult. You just can’t leave me! It’s impossible!

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:53.006
And that is what it is that you also develop those qualities

00:54:53.166 --> 00:54:55.033
that you can’t leave.

00:54:55.690 --> 00:55:01.280
See, a child, if it is lost, I mean, the parents just go off,

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.463
they don’t know how the child is lost.

00:55:03.623 --> 00:55:09.898
But supposing, some son of theirs is a very bad boy,

00:55:10.058 --> 00:55:15.334
is misbehaving, is doing all kinds of wrong things, they don’t mind.

00:55:15.494 --> 00:55:18.186
But when they are young, they are innocent

00:55:18.346 --> 00:55:22.834
it’s some sort of a tremendous attachment to them

00:55:22.994 --> 00:55:28.373
and understanding that “They are our children, we have to look after them.”

00:55:28.533 --> 00:55:32.553
So [it’s] this innocence that attracts you,

00:55:32.713 --> 00:55:39.193
that keeps you wondering about your children, about other children.

00:55:39.353 --> 00:55:43.771
And I was very happy the way you gave a present to Guido

00:55:43.931 --> 00:55:47.600
because he’s doing a very difficult task, I must say.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:53.725
And this appreciation shows that to you it’s very valuable

00:55:53.885 --> 00:55:56.920
that your children are looked after.

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.295
But you are also a child of your Mother.

00:56:00.455 --> 00:56:04.811
As a result, you have all these powers within yourself.

00:56:04.971 --> 00:56:11.201
But you must know how to smile. You must know how to win over people.

00:56:11.361 --> 00:56:14.803
Still there are some Sahaj Yogis and some Sahaj Yoginis

00:56:14.963 --> 00:56:19.764
who are still rather stiff! I find them little stiff type

00:56:19.924 --> 00:56:21.787
and they can’t give up their stiffness.

00:56:21.947 --> 00:56:25.303
Maybe they think no end of themselves or whatever it is.

00:56:25.463 --> 00:56:27.318
Then they will not enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:27.479 --> 00:56:30.962
Of course, mentally of course they understand Sahaj Yog and all that

00:56:31.123 --> 00:56:39.525
but they cannot enjoy fully Sahaj Yoga and all its mirth, its joyous moments.

00:56:40.447 --> 00:56:44.436
Today is to celebrate His birth

00:56:44.596 --> 00:56:50.022
and He was the first God that was created on this Earth;

00:56:50.182 --> 00:56:56.049
because he’s also auspiciousness, he’s also Holiness.

00:56:56.705 --> 00:57:01.483
So the Primordial Mother didn’t want to create this world

00:57:01.643 --> 00:57:08.112
without first creating the holiness, the auspiciousness, the purity.

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:12.026
And that’s why He was first created.

00:57:12.776 --> 00:57:17.889
Created on this Earth with vibrations, just [a] bundle of vibrations:

00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:21.440
so that He can look after all the people

00:57:21.854 --> 00:57:29.479
who are going to come from ages to ages,

00:57:29.901 --> 00:57:34.464
to guide them always on the right path.

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:39.405
So He is supposed to be in charge of our conscience,

00:57:39.565 --> 00:57:43.733
the conscience that eats you up sometimes, that says,

00:57:43.893 --> 00:57:46.444
“This is not alright. This I should not have done.

00:57:46.604 --> 00:57:48.553
That I should have not done.”

00:57:48.713 --> 00:57:54.045
But one should try to take very great pride in it.

00:57:54.205 --> 00:57:57.389
Like there was one gentleman, an Indian

00:57:57.549 --> 00:58:00.881
– Indians can be exceptionally innocent sometimes, exceptionally,

00:58:01.041 --> 00:58:04.811
you can’t understand them! So I told him,

00:58:04.971 --> 00:58:08.670
“Why did you give up your land?”

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:12.881
He said, “Mother, I thought that later on, when my children will grow,

00:58:13.041 --> 00:58:17.363
I might become greedy and I may not give this land to my brother,

00:58:17.523 --> 00:58:21.546
who deserves it because I’m too clever, I can cheat him.

00:58:21.706 --> 00:58:23.623
So I thought it’s better to give up.

00:58:23.783 --> 00:58:26.194
So I gave up the land to my brother.”

00:58:26.354 --> 00:58:30.549
And he so innocently was telling me that,

00:58:30.986 --> 00:58:36.756
“I should not become greedy because maybe that my children will grow up

00:58:36.916 --> 00:58:39.858
and I will feel that I must give all this to my children,

00:58:40.018 --> 00:58:44.256
so I decided to give up the land just now to my own brother.”

00:58:44.416 --> 00:58:46.262
But I said, “What about your brother?”

00:58:46.423 --> 00:58:49.908
He said, “He deserves, he needs. I don’t need so much land.

00:58:50.068 --> 00:58:52.998
I am doing very well in life. That’s why I have given.”

00:58:53.158 --> 00:58:57.381
“But legally?” “Legally,” he said, “it was not in his name,

00:58:57.541 --> 00:59:00.537
but I thought it’s better that I give it to him now.

00:59:00.697 --> 00:59:03.366
Later on I might become a bad man.”

00:59:03.526 --> 00:59:07.177
So the innocence works out in such a manner.

00:59:07.337 --> 00:59:09.889
And very sweet, sweet stories I have got to tell you.

00:59:10.049 --> 00:59:14.607
There’s one Sahaj Yogi who was a little boy, say about sixteen years of old,

00:59:14.767 --> 00:59:19.116
he came to me and he said, “My mother has some badhas and the father, too.

00:59:19.276 --> 00:59:20.694
I don’t know what to do.

00:59:20.854 --> 00:59:24.030
Now supposing I leave my father and mother,

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:30.003
then will the badhas also leave me?” I said, “Maybe. May not be. Depends on…”

00:59:30.596 --> 00:59:33.467
“Then what is the need for people to leave their parents

00:59:33.627 --> 00:59:37.631
when they are eighteen years of age? Why do people leave their parents

00:59:37.791 --> 00:59:41.936
at the eighteen years of age? Because, you see, it will be a big loss.”

00:59:42.096 --> 00:59:47.951
I said, “Why?” “Firstly, if I start smoking who will stop me?”

00:59:48.111 --> 00:59:51.647
Such an innocent thing. “If I start smoking,

00:59:51.807 --> 00:59:56.014
only my father can slap me on the face, nobody else.

00:59:56.174 --> 00:59:58.858
So he can save me from the smoking.”

00:59:59.018 --> 01:00:03.381
I was amazed at his innocence, the way he was saying that,

01:00:03.541 --> 01:00:06.256
“I want my father to be there to slap me.”

01:00:06.416 --> 01:00:09.811
And then he said, “And then my mother, she’s the one

01:00:09.971 --> 01:00:14.467
who corrects me every point; so if she goes away, if I am not with her,

01:00:14.627 --> 01:00:19.092
who will correct me? Who will tell me don’t do this and don’t do that?”

01:00:19.252 --> 01:00:23.709
I never understood that, look at this boy of sixteen years

01:00:23.869 --> 01:00:27.966
– he’s an Indian – telling me that his parents’ utility is

01:00:28.126 --> 01:00:33.354
that they are the only people who can stop him from doing wrong things!

01:00:33.916 --> 01:00:38.897
Because he was a born-realised and he could see that,

01:00:39.057 --> 01:00:43.686
“if I try to do something wrong it’s only my parents can tell me.”

01:00:43.846 --> 01:00:49.319
So this innocence always seeks [a] virtuous life,

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:55.037
this better life and it doesn’t assert on others.

01:00:55.197 --> 01:00:58.858
But it’s, somehow or other, when there is innocence

01:00:59.018 --> 01:01:02.006
– just like you people are now Self-realised people –

01:01:02.166 --> 01:01:06.522
in the light of your Self, you don’t want to do something

01:01:06.682 --> 01:01:10.983
that is not innocent, that is not simple.

01:01:12.084 --> 01:01:14.908
For example, I have never seen such honest people

01:01:15.068 --> 01:01:18.728
as we have in Sahaja Yoga. Absolutely honest, I mean,

01:01:18.888 --> 01:01:22.510
they don’t want to take even a single pie (1/192 Rupee) out of things.

01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:25.541
Of course, there have been some horrible people, also,

01:01:25.701 --> 01:01:28.463
who made lots of money out of Sahaj Yog, doesn’t matter;

01:01:28.623 --> 01:01:32.213
but most of you have become so honest.

01:01:32.373 --> 01:01:35.072
I mean there’s so much corruption in this world

01:01:35.232 --> 01:01:39.084
and to see people who are so honest.

01:01:39.489 --> 01:01:43.030
Now the greatest quality, as you know, of Shri Ganesha’s

01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:47.908
I was told yesterday, that for them their Mother is the most important.

01:01:48.068 --> 01:01:53.865
What Mother says and what Mother does, that’s the most important thing.

01:01:54.075 --> 01:01:59.689
I mean, it is so much that I really can’t understand

01:01:59.849 --> 01:02:04.255
how you people are so much fond of me.

01:02:05.838 --> 01:02:15.828
Because I think that, whatever you think about me mentally

01:02:15.918 --> 01:02:19.172
is nothing compared to what you have within yourself

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:24.948
But the another quality, as I said, is that

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:29.870
He makes the ganas work and so you have to work it out.

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:35.597
Yesterday’s thing has shown me how this collectivity

01:02:35.757 --> 01:02:42.394
of Switzerland has come up so well, so well.

01:02:42.554 --> 01:02:49.948
And it was really showing how we can progress. You all have talents.

01:02:50.108 --> 01:02:53.423
Not that only Swiss have. You all have talents.

01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:57.113
You all have understanding. You are all intelligent.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:03:02.527
All of you are special people and you have to work out in collective way

01:03:02.687 --> 01:03:07.722
and also individual way to show your quality of Shri Ganesh,

01:03:07.882 --> 01:03:10.128
the way He has the rhythm within Him.

01:03:10.288 --> 01:03:14.019
He’s very rhythmic and yesterday those two big musicians sitting,

01:03:14.179 --> 01:03:19.917
he said, “Mother, they are so rhythmically clapping, they are rhythmic.

01:03:20.077 --> 01:03:23.964
There’s no, ‘ha, ha, hoo, hoo,’ just clapping and so rhythmic.

01:03:24.124 --> 01:03:26.245
Nobody makes a mistake.”

01:03:26.405 --> 01:03:29.808
Then they said, “When they sing also, nobody’s out of tune.”

01:03:29.968 --> 01:03:34.300
Normally, if ten people are singing, without proper training,

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:38.460
then this are in alto, tenor, bass, everything, they go on.

01:03:38.621 --> 01:03:42.738
And you don’t know on what swar (note) they have taken, on what note they are singing.

01:03:42.898 --> 01:03:47.894
But they were yesterday very amazed that all of you were singing on the same note;

01:03:48.054 --> 01:03:51.933
you wouldn’t leave the note and come onto another note.

01:03:52.093 --> 01:03:56.519
That shows that the rhythm of Shri Ganesha is working in you

01:03:56.679 --> 01:04:04.222
and His understanding of music, which is one of His qualities is:

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:15.710
that He dances on the music of which Nataraja, the Father Shiva has taught Him.

01:04:16.476 --> 01:04:20.948
It’s very rhythmic. That part, I think, a little bit, Sahaja Yogis are missing:

01:04:21.108 --> 01:04:25.808
that when they dance they need not be, all of them, in [a] very rhythmic pattern.

01:04:25.968 --> 01:04:29.519
They’re alright, but still one has to learn [a] little more

01:04:29.679 --> 01:04:32.104
rhythmic pattern, would be a good idea.

01:04:32.264 --> 01:04:35.573
As the Shri Ganesha, which is such a big stomach that He has,

01:04:35.733 --> 01:04:42.480
He dances so well, so lightly He lifts his body and the way He works it out, it’s amazing.

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:48.386
How does He do it with such a…and a short person with such thick legs?

01:04:48.546 --> 01:04:56.027
He is very light and the lightness comes because of innocence – Mooladhar.

01:04:56.187 --> 01:05:00.933
If the Mooladhara is alright, then lightness is there.

01:05:01.093 --> 01:05:08.667
You have seen in Maharashtra how these people were playing the Lezim (dance)

01:05:08.827 --> 01:05:15.378
with such speed and with such lightness:

01:05:15.538 --> 01:05:17.964
they were lifting their legs and hand.

01:05:18.124 --> 01:05:23.499
It was really amazing how they were doing it.

01:05:24.608 --> 01:05:29.706
And it is only the innocence of these people of the villages

01:05:29.866 --> 01:05:33.784
that they don’t understand much of this nonsense.

01:05:33.944 --> 01:05:37.698
They don’t know what is going on with all these things.

01:05:37.858 --> 01:05:40.573
They earn their living, they are farmers,

01:05:40.733 --> 01:05:45.683
and then in the evening they just sleep off in complete innocence.

01:05:45.843 --> 01:05:49.636
They do not plan, they do not sit down and find out

01:05:49.796 --> 01:05:57.995
how to kill somebody, maybe something how to rob somebody

01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:01.277
or another bad things that people think

01:06:01.437 --> 01:06:04.881
– the bad action that comes into their minds. There is no time for that.

01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:08.127
They work the whole day. In the evening, nicely they sleep.

01:06:08.287 --> 01:06:13.870
Or else they will have a bhajan mandeley where they will all sing together

01:06:14.030 --> 01:06:16.011
in a very beautiful manner.

01:06:16.171 --> 01:06:22.058
So it’s a real sahaj style where we don’t have to think

01:06:22.218 --> 01:06:25.402
about killing anybody or to murder anybody.

01:06:25.562 --> 01:06:31.402
Like all these cults, they have weapons with them! I can’t understand.

01:06:31.562 --> 01:06:37.706
Even I was told that in Poland our Pope maharaj sent lots of weapons there.

01:06:37.866 --> 01:06:43.058
What is the need for anybody who is spiritual to have weapons around

01:06:43.218 --> 01:06:45.792
and think of violence and killing people?

01:06:45.952 --> 01:06:48.589
Because there is no innocence at all. You can see that.

01:06:48.749 --> 01:06:52.597
If you are innocent your power is your innocence,

01:06:52.757 --> 01:06:57.613
you don’t have to have weapons and guns and things.

01:06:57.773 --> 01:07:04.105
All these religions, so-called, are using nothing but weapons and guns

01:07:04.265 --> 01:07:08.339
and all kinds of killing objects and they are also killed.

01:07:08.499 --> 01:07:14.253
It’s a funny thing going on in the name of God, in the name of Shri Ganesh.

01:07:14.413 --> 01:07:16.534
There is no need for us to fight.

01:07:16.694 --> 01:07:21.089
There is no need for us to think that we’ll kill this man or kill that one.

01:07:21.249 --> 01:07:24.870
Only you have to just desire, project your energy

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:28.050
and you will see [that] the person will disappear.

01:07:28.210 --> 01:07:30.761
He’ll either become a transformed person

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:34.937
or he will not be there to trouble you.

01:07:35.772 --> 01:07:40.894
So, one thing I have to again stress is that we must know our qualities

01:07:41.054 --> 01:07:43.296
and our powers.

01:07:44.765 --> 01:07:49.097
Many people I know could never come on the stage and speak also.

01:07:49.257 --> 01:07:54.280
I said, “You get along – finished! Start it.” It worked out.

01:07:54.921 --> 01:07:59.175
Anything, you just project. “I can do it! Why can’t I do it?”

01:07:59.335 --> 01:08:02.835
To say, “I can’t. I am sorry.”

01:08:03.108 --> 01:08:04.623
This ‘sorry’ is so common now.

01:08:04.784 --> 01:08:07.986
On the telephone also people will say “sorry”.  I said, “What ‘sorry’?”

01:08:08.147 --> 01:08:10.206
All the time, “sorry, sorry, sorry.”

01:08:10.366 --> 01:08:13.214
We used to say, “I beg your pardon,” – was sensible.

01:08:13.374 --> 01:08:18.605
But the way people are, “Poor me, you know. How can I do it?”

01:08:18.765 --> 01:08:24.534
All such people are not yet aware of their powers that they have.

01:08:24.694 --> 01:08:27.042
You can do it, everything. You can.

01:08:27.202 --> 01:08:31.433
Everything can be managed; after all, you have the power.

01:08:31.593 --> 01:08:36.277
In that power you must know that you are not going to do something indiscreet,

01:08:36.437 --> 01:08:38.628
you are not going to spoil anybody,

01:08:38.788 --> 01:08:43.659
but your power itself will show that this power

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:52.214
is really of love, affection, compassion for the transformation of the whole world.

01:08:52.374 --> 01:08:55.409
I am thinking of the complete global transformation,

01:08:55.569 --> 01:09:01.335
which, I know, is a mad dream, but still I think like that,

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:06.925
because I see you all, then I think you all can do it

01:09:07.085 --> 01:09:14.585
and when I see the Shri Ganesha in you, I am sure it will work out.

01:09:15.366 --> 01:09:21.042
So, in my lifetime I have seen so many Sahaj Yogis, all over.

01:09:21.202 --> 01:09:25.073
How things are worked out: you have heard about in Brazil

01:09:25.233 --> 01:09:28.308
and also in Argentina, most unexpected.

01:09:28.468 --> 01:09:32.363
The people came to a program from twelve o’clock in the morning

01:09:32.523 --> 01:09:36.136
when we were going to have the program at seven o’clock!

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:39.198
I reached there at about eight, as usual, and they said,

01:09:39.358 --> 01:09:41.904
“Mother, You won’t believe there was a big drama here!”

01:09:42.065 --> 01:09:45.237
I said, “What drama?” “They were sitting here from twelve o’clock,

01:09:45.398 --> 01:09:48.488
so all those who had come earlier got inside,

01:09:48.648 --> 01:09:52.214
but those who came at the last minute would not be allowed

01:09:52.374 --> 01:09:54.417
and they are sitting there and fighting,

01:09:54.577 --> 01:09:58.253
‘No, we are going to come inside somehow!’ ”

01:09:58.413 --> 01:10:02.557
So then, one of the Sahaja Yogis sensibly went and talked to the manager

01:10:02.717 --> 01:10:05.730
and told, “Baba, let them come! There is room.”

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:07.464
So there were four tiers.

01:10:07.624 --> 01:10:11.464
One was the ground, then one more, one more, one more.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:13.823
When I came I saw, “What’s this?”

01:10:13.983 --> 01:10:18.928
All over, the whole thing was filled with these people.

01:10:19.413 --> 01:10:23.433
I had never seen them before, but they were there,

01:10:23.593 --> 01:10:31.421
and so respectful, so much absorbing the vibrations.

01:10:32.287 --> 01:10:38.191
And I found it difficult to control my tears out of a real feeling

01:10:38.351 --> 01:10:43.624
of such gratitude for Shri Ganesh.

01:10:44.428 --> 01:10:46.902
He’s the one who worked it out.

01:10:47.062 --> 01:10:48.464
That’s why they say always,

01:10:48.624 --> 01:10:52.378
“First worship Shri Ganesh before starting any work,”

01:10:52.538 --> 01:10:55.339
because then it gives you that peace,

01:10:55.499 --> 01:11:01.050
that tremendous powerful peace which works out so many things

01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:04.343
that you never thought it would.

01:11:07.358 --> 01:11:11.956
So we have to request Shri Ganesha

01:11:12.116 --> 01:11:16.878
that all the problems of our land owning should be solved by Him

01:11:17.038 --> 01:11:20.042
and by your Shri Ganesh power.

01:11:20.202 --> 01:11:22.417
We are still hoping to get the land

01:11:22.577 --> 01:11:25.824
and I want to install this properly for you because every time

01:11:25.984 --> 01:11:28.558
I don’t want you to suffer like this.

01:11:28.718 --> 01:11:32.839
It’s a pilgrimage, but rather difficult this time you all had,

01:11:32.999 --> 01:11:36.940
but you managed it very nicely and you never showed

01:11:37.100 --> 01:11:43.085
any kind of a reluctance to accept this challenge.

01:11:43.952 --> 01:11:47.659
Shri Ganesha was testing you I think also, a little bit.

01:11:47.819 --> 01:11:51.019
But all that has worked out so well and now

01:11:51.179 --> 01:11:54.894
we are here to do the puja of Shri Ganesh.

01:11:55.054 --> 01:11:57.133
May God Bless you.
