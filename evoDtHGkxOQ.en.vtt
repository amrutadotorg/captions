00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.944
﻿I have heard that you have been all very sick.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.988
I think I got sick because of that,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.690
myself.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.379
Now I hope you are all better.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.844
Still there are sick people?

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.039
How many?

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:41.036
Guido Lanza: About seventy.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.049
Shri Mataji: Seven? Yogis: Seventy

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:45.695
Shri Mataji: Seventy are sick in bed?

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.320
Where are they?

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.580
Now there’s something I must tell you that,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.300
the other day these girls were making me wear ornaments

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:01.096
and I felt a

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:04.487
very funny smell from them.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.270
So I think that you people do not wash your hands

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.963
properly.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.940
After going to the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.244
going to the toilet I had told you to use water all the time

00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:18.940
– it’s very important.

00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:21.703
But you people stick, still, to the

00:02:21.903 --> 00:02:24.903
Western style. That’s very dirty, I tell you.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.180
It’s a very dirty style of living

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.380
– is not to use the water.

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:32.045
It’s very unhygienic also.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.376
That’s why you find in the West most of the people are sick.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.820
Not here. You have seen yesterday how the boys were dancing

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.046
– so quick and fast.

00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:45.114
So that’s one thing one has to remember

00:02:45.314 --> 00:02:47.480
is to wash your hands after

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.608
coming out of the toilet, before food.

00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:54.029
Yesterday I smelt their hands and I was amazed.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.510
Smelling awfully bad!

00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:01.667
So that’s not an Indian custom or anything,

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:03.754
but it’s a hygienic system.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.162
So I hope you have got lotas. Have you got lotas there?

00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:08.982
You had it.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.760
But still you keep to that dirty

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.632
thing with which you have got AIDS.

00:03:12.832 --> 00:03:15.701
You got all your problems because of that dirty habits.

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:19.138
So please try to understand.

00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:21.083
Now, in England, or anywhere,

00:03:21.283 --> 00:03:24.508
I have seen you use spoons, forks and

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.420
other things, you see,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.320
so you don’t use, directly, your hands.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.399
When you don’t use your hands directly it’s all right.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.353
But also I think it’s a dirty habit in any case.

00:03:36.554 --> 00:03:39.682
But if you are using forks or spoons or something,

00:03:39.883 --> 00:03:43.448
at least you are not touching your food with that dirty hands.

00:03:44.353 --> 00:03:47.027
Only that time I realised that

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.340
these people have again taken to the bad habits.

00:03:52.338 --> 00:03:54.169
This paper business is the dirtiest!

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:58.340
People, you are so much used to that smell that you do not feel it.

00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:00.692
But I have seen it even when

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.939
we have receptions and things, I am sitting there

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.195
and meeting people, or even if I am shaking hands with them,

00:04:07.396 --> 00:04:08.860
I feel terrible.

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:11.332
The smell is too much in the hands.

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:13.213
The sensitivity is lost.

00:04:13.414 --> 00:04:17.414
You cannot feel the smell. Can
you smell your hands now? Let’s see!

00:04:23.777 --> 00:04:25.352
Do you feel that?

00:04:27.902 --> 00:04:30.388
It’s no need to put any scents or anything,

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:33.603
but with the soap nicely. Here in India we use our,

00:04:33.803 --> 00:04:35.994
clay because clay in India is very good.

00:04:36.194 --> 00:04:38.771
You can use the clay. Just use the clay nicely

00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:41.780
and clean your hand. It’s very important.

00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:45.758
And that’s why I have seen that in the West everybody is sick

00:04:45.958 --> 00:04:48.260
all the time, there’s something wrong, something.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.101
We never find them healthy.

00:04:50.301 --> 00:04:52.660
I think this is one of the reasons.

00:04:53.306 --> 00:04:55.484
Something is always wrong with them.

00:04:55.685 --> 00:04:57.555
I mean, Indians were there,

00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:00.163
they all had the same food as you ate;

00:05:00.364 --> 00:05:02.140
nothing happened to them!

00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:07.923
And we had made special arrangements for water also.

00:05:10.134 --> 00:05:13.296
But this is something you are very negligent about.

00:05:14.945 --> 00:05:17.020
You have to be very careful.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.358
I don’t know how you manage.

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:22.000
I mean, you can’t live without it.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.386
Even if, supposing, we go to some
place and there’s nothing available,

00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:27.437
just you have to use the paper sometimes,

00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:29.420
even in England sometimes in...

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.780
we come back home immediately and have a bath.

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.850
So, personal cleanliness is very important, anywhere.

00:05:38.682 --> 00:05:40.740
Here you cannot blame anything

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.982
to anything because I have seen people

00:05:43.182 --> 00:05:45.340
who ate the same food, lived there

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.020
– they are quite healthy and hearty.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.240
Nothing has gone wrong with them.

00:05:52.775 --> 00:05:55.241
And we don’t also eat too much of raw food.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.858
That’s also another thing good is that there is no question of thing

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.656
falling into it.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.940
Moreover, even if somebody told me that the utensils were washed

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.380
in the lake, doesn’t matter.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.340
But the food was cooked. Once you put it

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.040
on the fire it all cleanses out.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.374
It cannot give you the sickness.

00:06:19.118 --> 00:06:21.860
Then secondly I have seen you are very negligent about

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.238
also covering up yourself.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.733
You must take a shawl all the time.

00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:31.563
Even if you feel a little warm it doesn’t matter.

00:06:31.677 --> 00:06:35.531
But you can take it out. But keep it handy all the time.

00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:37.540
That’s also why you get sick,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.667
because there’s dust everywhere.

00:06:39.762 --> 00:06:43.374
And if you have a shawl around, at least you are protected.

00:06:44.892 --> 00:06:47.433
So you should always wear those

00:06:47.634 --> 00:06:49.840
bundees we have given you.

00:06:50.228 --> 00:06:52.304
That has come free with the cloth,

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:54.690
with the dresses that you have got.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.856
And the ladies must keep their shawls with them.

00:06:58.057 --> 00:06:59.649
We have to respect our body

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.128
because these bodies are not

00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:05.551
ordinary bodies, they are temples of God.

00:07:08.723 --> 00:07:10.715
Thirdly, I have been requesting you to put some

00:07:10.915 --> 00:07:13.420
oil in your heads at least once a week!

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.820
But now the fashion is not to put any oil.

00:07:16.021 --> 00:07:18.780
So you don’t want to put any oil on your heads.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.588
At least once a week you must put some oil in your heads.

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:24.699
That will keep your head cool

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:27.797
and also before taking bath, use some oil

00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:29.740
for rubbing on your hands

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.002
or on your body. We always do that.

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.799
You people don’t have any oil with you?

00:07:38.203 --> 00:07:39.803
Do you have any oil?

00:07:41.438 --> 00:07:44.980
Sure? Then please rub it on your body

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.675
before taking your baths.

00:07:51.582 --> 00:07:54.580
You must rub oil on your body, nicely,

00:07:54.781 --> 00:07:56.281
before taking your baths.

00:07:56.482 --> 00:07:58.771
Also I have seen people in the West don’t do it.

00:07:58.972 --> 00:08:00.853
Just they never use oil.

00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:04.420
Before taking bath, at least for fifteen minutes,

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.549
rub oil on your bodies.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.302
They are very simple things

00:08:08.502 --> 00:08:11.220
but you just don’t do it. I just don’t know.

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:16.860
It's few things, if you look after,

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.740
I think you will be all right.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:22.620
And if you are sitting outside, cover your heads.

00:08:22.954 --> 00:08:26.580
It has been rather cold this time. Winter has been a little

00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:30.626
cooler than before, reason is – it has rained a lot.

00:08:30.827 --> 00:08:34.027
But I mean compared to your country, it’s not cold.

00:08:36.075 --> 00:08:38.180
But negligence

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.460
can cause it.

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.220
So please keep yourself covered.

00:08:43.675 --> 00:08:46.260
And then have your baths. If you take bath with

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.380
cold water you can never catch cold

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.420
because the temperature is the same.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.820
For a while you will feel it’s cold water, but it’s very good

00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:56.980
– those people who take bath with cold water.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.900
Did you get hot water

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.664
to have baths?

00:09:02.062 --> 00:09:03.562
Where?

00:09:05.658 --> 00:09:08.082
Sahaja Yogi: In Rahuri.

00:09:08.283 --> 00:09:09.887
Even in Brahmapuri.

00:09:10.088 --> 00:09:11.740
Shri Mataji: You had hot water?

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.601
That’s very wrong. That’s the reason.

00:09:14.802 --> 00:09:16.322
That explains.

00:09:16.522 --> 00:09:18.750
If you have to take bath with hot water

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.950
then you must get into your bed.

00:09:23.735 --> 00:09:26.422
If you have to take it in the open,

00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:28.693
sure shot you will get temperature.

00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:30.818
Absolutely sure shot.

00:09:32.038 --> 00:09:33.843
This is a very simple thing

00:09:34.044 --> 00:09:35.700
which I don’t know how you don’t know.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.140
You should never take your bath

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.220
in the open

00:09:41.624 --> 00:09:43.260
with the hot water.

00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:47.387
That’s sure shot. I mean, anybody who wants too.

00:09:47.588 --> 00:09:51.025
You see in the school supposing some boy doesn’t want to go,

00:09:51.226 --> 00:09:53.885
then what he does, he keeps the window open

00:09:54.086 --> 00:09:56.060
and takes his bath with hot water – finished!

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.660
– he gets a temperature immediately the next day.

00:10:02.328 --> 00:10:04.660
So in Brahmapuri if they have given you hot water,

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.380
you should not have taken bath. That was wrong.

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:11.933
Even if you had got it. I mean, river Ganges, I don’t know

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:14.905
how many have been to River Ganges?

00:10:15.106 --> 00:10:16.492
You have been.

00:10:16.693 --> 00:10:20.180
Now the water is freezing cold I tell you,

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.940
it’s absolutely freezing cold.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.472
When you put your foot you will just push it back, it’s so cold.

00:10:26.673 --> 00:10:30.673
But people get into it. Slowly, slowly, they just move; slip into it.

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.051
And when you come out

00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:35.940
your cheeks are red like apples!

00:10:36.493 --> 00:10:38.515
It’s so very cold. Isn’t it?

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:42.140
But nothing happens. Nobody catches cold or anything.

00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:45.494
So in the running water is the cleanest and

00:10:45.694 --> 00:10:48.852
where you could get in, get into cold water.

00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:51.643
Otherwise, even if you have to take a hot water bath,

00:10:51.843 --> 00:10:54.260
take it in the night or maybe

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.900
at the time when you can go off into your bed.

00:10:58.429 --> 00:11:01.179
In England also people take their baths in the night

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.780
mostly and get into bed.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.860
Supposing you take hot bath in England and go out

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.982
– immediately you will get

00:11:08.207 --> 00:11:10.671
cancer of the lungs.

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:17.529
Hot and cold is a very important thing one has to know.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.284
Like also you can see on the hands you feel hot and cold.

00:11:21.491 --> 00:11:24.900
So now supposing you have taken the coffee,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.767
after that you cannot take anything cold.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.580
Is a simple thing one should understand.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.260
First you can take anything cold.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.066
Like I have seen people take coffee and then ice cream! I mean,

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:41.301
sure you get troubles!

00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:43.140
Absolutely sure.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.060
But if you are taking ice cream, first take ice cream,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.780
then take a biscuit

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.900
and then take some water, then take some biscuit

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.900
and then you can take something hot.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:58.300
Now supposing you have taken
something hot and you have to take water also.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.740
Then take three biscuits.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.640
Another

00:12:05.876 --> 00:12:09.340
very great precaution you have to
take which I have seen nobody takes.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.260
Now it sometimes becomes very hot outside.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.743
You are sitting down into programs or something,

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:17.900
becomes very hot. You are sitting in the sun

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.299
sometimes and your head gets very heated up.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.940
Immediately you go and get cold water,

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.700
definitely you will get sick,

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.660
no doubt about it.

00:12:28.385 --> 00:12:30.820
That’s the best way to get sick!

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.478
So, if you are sitting in the sun,

00:12:33.678 --> 00:12:36.661
immediately you should never, never, never

00:12:36.862 --> 00:12:39.621
take any water till you have eaten something sweet.

00:12:39.821 --> 00:12:42.546
Take some sugar, or take some jaggery,

00:12:42.746 --> 00:12:44.940
or some biscuit or something.

00:12:45.993 --> 00:12:48.860
Even if you are very thirsty you should not do it.

00:12:50.475 --> 00:12:53.180
Little precautions have to be taken.

00:12:53.545 --> 00:12:55.300
Nothing should happen to Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.660
Because if you get sick, I get sick.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.860
That’s the problem is.

00:13:00.319 --> 00:13:02.824
And that’s why I was so sick yesterday.

00:13:03.025 --> 00:13:05.260
I knew that you must be all very sick

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:07.227
– that’s why it has happened to me.

00:13:07.427 --> 00:13:10.940
I mean, I work much harder than you people do.

00:13:13.368 --> 00:13:14.983
Unending meetings are there.

00:13:15.183 --> 00:13:17.063
I have to meet other people apart from you.

00:13:17.263 --> 00:13:19.546
Give Realisations to them,

00:13:19.746 --> 00:13:22.980
discuss all other organisational problems,

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:25.540
this, that – nothing happens to me.

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:29.212
But these precautions must be taken.

00:13:32.638 --> 00:13:34.140
Look at these Indians:

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.100
they are travelling with you, they are all right. Nobody’s sick. Why?

00:13:42.448 --> 00:13:44.420
None of them are sick.

00:13:44.776 --> 00:13:47.228
You see, from our childhood it is taught to us

00:13:47.429 --> 00:13:51.139
we must wash our hands at least ten times a day.

00:13:52.657 --> 00:13:54.541
And then too much tea.

00:13:54.742 --> 00:13:56.420
You people take too much tea.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:59.526
It’s very injurious for the

00:14:01.754 --> 00:14:05.100
intestines, very injurious. It has tannin, you know that.

00:14:06.332 --> 00:14:08.740
So much tea you people take, it’s very wrong.

00:14:08.941 --> 00:14:10.460
Plus milk with it.

00:14:10.661 --> 00:14:12.940
Milk it gives you diarrhoea.

00:14:14.106 --> 00:14:15.794
Limit your tea taking.

00:14:15.995 --> 00:14:18.653
Or even if you have to take many cups of tea,

00:14:18.853 --> 00:14:20.820
then see that it’s a very light tea,

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.939
extremely light, very light tea.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.873
But this Marathi tea, only one cup in the morning is sufficient.

00:14:28.879 --> 00:14:31.614
Too much tea is very dangerous.

00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:34.060
I mean it’s easily available here.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.936
They don’t mind even if you have a full

00:14:38.136 --> 00:14:40.620
drum of a tea, each person,

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.940
but it’s not good for you.

00:14:44.361 --> 00:14:46.740
Too much tea is not good at all.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.151
So limit your tea taking.

00:14:49.352 --> 00:14:53.171
Also all the time to take tea is not a very good idea.

00:14:54.454 --> 00:14:57.309
It’s some sort of a thing that has happened, I think,

00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.566
is the attention part.

00:15:00.765 --> 00:15:02.265
Attention.

00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.019
Now ask Indians how many times they take tea,

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.380
though we grow so much tea here.

00:15:14.204 --> 00:15:16.095
At the most two times.

00:15:18.286 --> 00:15:20.140
If they have taken early in the morning tea,

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.620
they will not have any tea for breakfast;

00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:26.242
and once in the evening – finished!

00:15:26.443 --> 00:15:30.220
If there’s a music program in the night they might take one cup.

00:15:32.523 --> 00:15:35.292
Because they know that because of this tea

00:15:35.493 --> 00:15:37.475
your stomach goes out of order,

00:15:37.675 --> 00:15:39.175
you cannot sleep.

00:15:39.376 --> 00:15:42.580
It’s a very wrong thing. But I have seen when I was building my

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.820
house, or I should say when I

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:48.003
was doing renovation of my house,

00:15:48.204 --> 00:15:49.845
that at the slightest pretext they

00:15:50.045 --> 00:15:52.380
used to enter into the kitchen, make tea, drink it.

00:15:52.652 --> 00:15:55.299
Fifteen cups, twenty cups. I used to wonder,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.918
“What’s the matter with these people?”

00:15:58.119 --> 00:16:00.820
Of course it’s cheap to give tea, is all right

00:16:01.021 --> 00:16:04.260
– doesn’t cost much money. But it’s very dangerous.

00:16:07.024 --> 00:16:08.940
So, reduce your

00:16:09.313 --> 00:16:11.069
intake of tea.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.331
And water should be

00:16:13.531 --> 00:16:16.293
increased. More water, less of tea.

00:16:16.493 --> 00:16:18.820
Tea itself is not a very good thing.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.300
If you see how much your Mother takes tea,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.580
you see I may take even ten cups of tea, but

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.612
so much of tea will be there, for ten cups.

00:16:27.813 --> 00:16:30.991
Just the water, you see. Just to please people I am taking tea.

00:16:31.192 --> 00:16:33.597
And no sugar, no milk.

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.288
That you know very well. Everybody knows.

00:16:37.489 --> 00:16:40.125
No sugar, no milk. Finished!

00:16:40.326 --> 00:16:42.688
Milk itself gives diarrhoea.

00:16:44.018 --> 00:16:46.684
Just like that I don’t mind with sugar otherwise

00:16:46.884 --> 00:16:50.162
for liver patients, but not too much of it also.

00:16:51.182 --> 00:16:53.443
Those who are liver patients can take sugar,

00:16:53.643 --> 00:16:57.407
otherwise normally you should not take too much sugar, also.

00:16:58.598 --> 00:17:02.053
All these little, little things if you look after, you will be all right.

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:05.025
Tonight I have arranged for them.

00:17:09.318 --> 00:17:10.820
I hope so.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.180
They are arranging some ajwain dhuni.

00:17:14.881 --> 00:17:17.572
You all should have it. It’s a very good thing

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.380
– ajwain.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:22.985
Also those who are having diarrhoea can have it, it’s all right.

00:17:23.186 --> 00:17:25.860
It just clears you out, completely.

00:17:27.876 --> 00:17:29.820
And diarrhoea should not make you weak.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.860
I mean, I normally,

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.822
in one month’s time, I have at least twenty days diarrhoea

00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:37.620
– really!

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:40.740
The reason is I take everybody’s problems upon myself

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.060
and it goes out as diarrhoea

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.100
but it doesn’t make me weak.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.229
So just the attention is the idea.

00:17:51.429 --> 00:17:55.133
Diarrhoea is important
sometimes to cleanse you out. It’s important.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.053
To me, it’s a relief.

00:17:59.709 --> 00:18:02.980
Haa, if it is thirty-five motions or forty motions, then isn’t all right.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.420
But three, four motions is very good sometimes.

00:18:09.496 --> 00:18:12.980
Also, Indian food is a heavy food.

00:18:14.142 --> 00:18:16.460
It’s not so light as we have English food,

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.820
or Western food is very light,

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.316
easy to digest, indian food is not.

00:18:22.516 --> 00:18:24.220
So that’s why I asked you to dance,

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.739
to have some exercises so you can digest it.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.060
While we are all having sedentary habits mostly.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.162
We are sitting round doing nothing.

00:18:32.363 --> 00:18:34.980
Indians are working, we are not working at all.

00:18:36.139 --> 00:18:39.065
So we should do little walking or some exercises.

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:40.802
It’s a heavy food, no doubt,

00:18:41.003 --> 00:18:42.580
but you cannot make it very light,

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.198
though I tell them, “Make it very light – no chilies, nothing.”

00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:47.899
They are trying.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.420
For example, today’s

00:18:51.293 --> 00:18:54.260
lunch was really too much for me!

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.540
It’s all right, once in a while you eat it.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.453
And evening time I told them to give you a very simple food.

00:19:00.654 --> 00:19:03.060
So that’s how it can be compensated:

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.620
that evening time simple food,

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.060
day time heavy; or evening time it is heavy,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.110
then day time simple food.

00:19:10.311 --> 00:19:12.862
But Indians are like that, they want have fond you see,

00:19:13.062 --> 00:19:15.540
they have this fondness to feed you

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:19.224
– very anxious to feed you. But don’t fall a trap to that.

00:19:19.707 --> 00:19:21.449
You should just say, “No, no, no!”

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.865
But they will go on saying, “Please have!” They feel very happy.

00:19:24.066 --> 00:19:26.546
They themselves, if you see, they don’t eat so much.

00:19:28.243 --> 00:19:31.488
They are very clever! You see them, how much they eat.

00:19:31.689 --> 00:19:35.154
They’ll get up at five o’clock, have
their bath, they are ready for everything.

00:19:35.373 --> 00:19:38.083
In the whole day, if you see, they eat very little themselves.

00:19:38.283 --> 00:19:40.700
And you know how much I eat, myself.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.587
But if it comes to

00:19:42.788 --> 00:19:46.610
telling people to eat, I’ll say,
“Please have more. Please have more.”

00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:50.540
But you should not listen there.

00:19:52.873 --> 00:19:55.602
As much as you can tolerate, take it.

00:19:56.038 --> 00:19:58.253
Because you may not be able to digest.

00:19:58.454 --> 00:20:01.340
I will say it because I don’t want you to feel embarrassed

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.971
how to take more, so I will say, “Go on, eat more!”

00:20:04.172 --> 00:20:06.300
But you should not listen.

00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:14.194
I think most of our problems are solved now

00:20:14.395 --> 00:20:17.100
as far as marriages are concerned.

00:20:17.714 --> 00:20:19.460
And

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:23.529
perhaps may be one marriage we have to neutralise a little bit.

00:20:23.753 --> 00:20:27.736
And there’s somebody coming also

00:20:28.513 --> 00:20:31.180
from Simla. I think according to the Western

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.980
standard he’s a handsome man.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.340
You can use him for a model,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.940
according to the Western style.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.140
But according to Indian style, he is not.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:45.060
He’s quite a person who looks like

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.780
all the models I see in Harrods.

00:20:48.031 --> 00:20:50.364
It’s very surprising, and according to Yogi,

00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:54.260
he thought he may not be
appreciated because of his looks. I said, “What?

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.629
You see they all have like this, only – faces. I saw them in Harrods.

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.420
So many of them put out as models.”

00:21:02.582 --> 00:21:04.631
So there’s somebody coming down

00:21:04.831 --> 00:21:07.300
and Yogi is bringing him tomorrow.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.307
So there’s one more

00:21:09.508 --> 00:21:11.100
person is coming,

00:21:11.301 --> 00:21:12.760
and

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.020
I hope now last-minute people don’t go,

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.220
stand up just to say that, “I want to get married.”

00:21:27.199 --> 00:21:29.340
Where is Mr. Khan?

00:21:43.117 --> 00:21:44.820
Is he not here?

00:21:52.433 --> 00:21:55.397
Oh, I see, he must have gone somewhere. All right.

00:22:24.295 --> 00:22:26.246
I made some medicine for you,

00:22:26.447 --> 00:22:27.860
for this diarrhoea business.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.804
But I think one should not pay so much attention to diarrhoea.

00:22:31.004 --> 00:22:33.780
It’s better to cleanse it out. It’s cleansing.

00:22:34.544 --> 00:22:36.843
But do you feel very weak with diarrhoea?

00:22:37.044 --> 00:22:38.300
Do you?

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.120
Guido Lanza: We have a few cases who have high fever also.

00:22:47.058 --> 00:22:49.330
Shri Mataji: High fever? Now he’s all right?

00:22:49.531 --> 00:22:51.890
The temperature has come down?

00:22:52.086 --> 00:22:55.260
Guido Lanza: A few still
Shri Mataji: Then put them right to the left.

00:22:56.542 --> 00:22:59.820
If it is high temperature, put them right to the left.

00:23:00.154 --> 00:23:03.273
It is diarrhoea, then no problems but

00:23:03.474 --> 00:23:04.941
diarrhoea is all right

00:23:05.141 --> 00:23:07.545
because it’s parasympathetic activity.

00:23:07.746 --> 00:23:09.747
It’s cleansing, you see.

00:23:09.948 --> 00:23:13.620
I always have diarrhoea, I mean, I am telling you,

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.100
out of thirty days,

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.786
at least twenty days, minimum, I have diarrhoea.

00:23:18.996 --> 00:23:22.060
But I am quite all right because it’s just cleansing out.

00:23:22.985 --> 00:23:24.940
But if you go on thinking, “I have diarrhoea!

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.107
I have got headache! I have this!”

00:23:27.307 --> 00:23:30.180
then even if you are not sick, you will feel more sick.

00:23:31.815 --> 00:23:33.531
One should not pay so much attention.

00:23:33.732 --> 00:23:35.580
What was the temperature?

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.414
Guido Lanza: Around 39/40.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.533
Shri Mataji: No, tell me in this thing,
I don’t understand. Hundred or how much?

00:23:52.897 --> 00:23:54.397
Guido Lanza: Around 100.

00:23:55.052 --> 00:23:56.552
Shri Mataji: Hundred?

00:23:58.732 --> 00:24:01.732
Hundred is no temperature. It’s nothing.

00:24:02.534 --> 00:24:04.520
Was that hundred and four?

00:24:05.292 --> 00:24:08.283
Oh, then it’s no temperature. It’s all right.

00:24:09.185 --> 00:24:11.980
High fever means hundred and four.

00:24:14.013 --> 00:24:15.513
Yes it is.

00:24:15.714 --> 00:24:17.636
But they must have taken …

00:24:17.837 --> 00:24:20.540
If you take bath with hot water.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:22.255
You can try,

00:24:22.455 --> 00:24:25.580
in the open – immediately you will get hundred temperature,

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.293
immediately.

00:24:27.726 --> 00:24:30.300
It’s absolutely inevitable.

00:24:30.564 --> 00:24:33.060
I don’t know how you don’t know these things.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.620
You don’t know, doctor?

00:24:43.544 --> 00:24:46.372
Dr. Bogdan: The food man gave us,

00:24:48.162 --> 00:24:50.060
yoghurt, dahi,

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.820
and dahi was very helpful

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.180
so a lot of people brightened up after that.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.780
Shri Mataji: With the yoghurt what happened?

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.260
Dr. Bogdan: They brightened up, they got better.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.100
Because we got so many within the space of two days,

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:05.940
we started to make proper treatments,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.780
organise people to have the dahi,

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.100
have black coffee.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.690
Shri Mataji: But diarrhoea is not to be feared so much, doctor.

00:25:20.891 --> 00:25:24.792
And, you see, hundred temperature is no temperature at all.

00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:28.208
Dr. Bogdan: No Mother, some of them hundred one, hundred and two.

00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:30.902
Shri Mataji: It’s all right once in a while.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.060
So many times if I

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.216
feel my temperature, I will go mad!

00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:41.374
It’s nothing! You see, temperature is there

00:25:41.574 --> 00:25:43.219
because of the heat, something.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.179
A hundred and two is nothing.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.300
It’s slightly. It’s not something to be reported.

00:25:48.931 --> 00:25:51.248
I personally think that way, you see.

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:58.620
We, Indians, for us hundred and two is no temperature!

00:26:01.071 --> 00:26:03.340
You people are very delicate!

00:26:03.924 --> 00:26:06.460
I must say very delicate health you have.

00:26:07.239 --> 00:26:09.820
You saw the boys how they were dancing. You saw the way

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.904
they were doing things. You see, life is so active.

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:16.067
The body’s lethargic nature you see,

00:26:16.267 --> 00:26:19.380
makes you so delicate.

00:26:20.088 --> 00:26:22.004
You saw yesterday how they were doing all that.

00:26:22.204 --> 00:26:24.660
That’s very common. I also used to learn all that.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.540
We all have to learn.

00:26:28.042 --> 00:26:31.605
So you keep your body moving. And this thing.

00:26:32.399 --> 00:26:34.269
I mean, for, you’d go to a

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:38.095
college even if you have a hundred and two temperature – nothing!

00:26:38.295 --> 00:26:39.936
It’s not much.

00:26:41.189 --> 00:26:43.820
But you are very delicate and bearing power is less.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:45.612
I think so.

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:50.500
Hundred and four, of course we start worrying.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:52.620
But hundred and two is not much.

00:26:54.305 --> 00:26:58.020
I thought you are so sick that it’s hundred and six.

00:26:59.463 --> 00:27:01.420
Really I got worried but

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.940
for that you just put left to the right, you will be all right.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:06.140
This is because of not

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.279
using proper

00:27:08.765 --> 00:27:10.404
precautions.

00:27:11.532 --> 00:27:15.420
Now don’t take hot bath in the open!

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.780
Just this much you try.

00:27:20.169 --> 00:27:22.140
There’s no harm in getting into cold water.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.340
Cold is always good.

00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:28.661
Always get into cold water.

00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:30.860
Take your bath in the cold water. You’ll never get,

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.407
you will never catch cold.

00:27:33.607 --> 00:27:37.417
When I was in India I always use absolutely cold water.

00:27:37.618 --> 00:27:40.229
But when I went to England everybody told me,

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.540
“You can’t do that way!”

00:27:43.046 --> 00:27:45.793
Just forced me to take hot water and I started getting cold.

00:27:45.993 --> 00:27:48.067
Otherwise I never get cold.

00:27:52.288 --> 00:27:54.180
So hot water should be used

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.660
– all right use the hot water, then get into your beds.

00:27:59.314 --> 00:28:03.122
That’s the best way to get into temperature I tell you.

00:28:03.322 --> 00:28:05.500
Just avoid hot water bath.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:09.035
But if you take hot water bath, see to it that

00:28:09.236 --> 00:28:11.035
you take the hot water bath

00:28:11.236 --> 00:28:13.723
and after that you get into your beds.

00:28:13.932 --> 00:28:15.650
No exposure.

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:17.540
All right?

00:28:25.896 --> 00:28:28.860
We made a medicine which doesn’t look very interesting

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.150
but it won’t taste bad.

00:28:36.098 --> 00:28:37.600
For diarrhoea only.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.940
Not for everyone, only those who have diarrhoea.

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.540
Also if you can remember one thing more,

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:03.331
is to when you come out of these processions

00:29:03.531 --> 00:29:05.620
you just gargle

00:29:06.516 --> 00:29:10.180
with little warm water, or even ordinary water. You just gargle out.

00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:12.820
So the dust will come out. There may be a dust.

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.180
You are not used to the dust.

00:29:15.451 --> 00:29:18.580
That’s also another reason you get this coughing.

00:29:21.851 --> 00:29:24.780
Are they here, those who have temperature?

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:30.198
Guido Lanza: They are in the beds. They are in bed.

00:29:30.829 --> 00:29:32.550
Shri Mataji: Not here?

00:29:32.807 --> 00:29:34.880
Guido Lanza: They are in the bedrooms now.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:38.171
Shri Mataji: Can you see if they have temperature now?

00:29:44.505 --> 00:29:47.444
I was worried the way it was told to me I thought,

00:29:47.645 --> 00:29:50.511
“Some sort of an epidemic has come, or what?”

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.160
Really! Like plague, you know!

00:29:53.388 --> 00:29:55.521
The description was so horrible!

00:30:13.106 --> 00:30:15.980
Some of you have had some gurus, you see

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.074
and that’s why also the Void acts, very fast.

00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:23.860
They must be the first time they must be visiting, most of them,

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.006
and they must have this guru trouble

00:30:26.206 --> 00:30:28.717
and the Void must be showing off.

00:30:49.979 --> 00:30:52.460
What has happened to Patrice

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:54.960
from Shudy Camps?

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:57.800
Where is he?

00:30:58.021 --> 00:31:00.354
What’s gone wrong with you Patrice?

00:31:04.393 --> 00:31:07.657
Patrice Buyle: Yesterday I just felt all my chakras.

00:31:28.141 --> 00:31:29.874
I couldn’t move.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:34.600
Yes, I had pain in my bones and I had fever and diarrhoea.

00:31:34.811 --> 00:31:36.900
I tried to stay during the whole puja

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.355
and at the end I almost collapsed.

00:31:39.487 --> 00:31:41.900
I don’t know why. My chakras were blocked

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.087
from the Mooladhara to the Ekadasha Rudra.

00:31:44.318 --> 00:31:45.818
Shri Mataji: What happened?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.780
Patrice Buyle: I don’t know Shri Mataji.

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.500
I swallowed some water from the Krishna river.

00:31:54.653 --> 00:31:56.320
Shri Mataji: Swallowed what?

00:31:56.394 --> 00:31:59.220
Patrice Buyle: Swallowed some water from the Krishna river

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:01.802
in the place, in Brahmapuri.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:03.510
Shri Mataji: Drank some water?

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.580
Patrice Buyle: Well I didn’t mean to drink it but I just

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.680
swim and drank some. I don’t know if that’s the reason for it.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.220
Shri Mataji: No, no. Krishna is flowing. There’s no problem.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.900
Patrice Buyle: Then I don’t know.

00:32:15.835 --> 00:32:18.921
Shri Mataji: They are saying that you were
talking something or something, you were

00:32:19.121 --> 00:32:20.460
saying things,

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.119
funny things you were saying.

00:32:25.308 --> 00:32:26.988
Do you remember that?

00:32:28.766 --> 00:32:30.126
Did you say that?

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.143
Somebody told Me that way.

00:32:37.888 --> 00:32:40.648
Was he like that? Anyone saw him?

00:32:44.729 --> 00:32:46.629
Dr. Spiro?

00:32:52.867 --> 00:32:55.830
Dr. David Spiro: I didn’t hear him
being delirious of anything Shri Mataji, no.

00:32:56.031 --> 00:32:57.940
Shri Mataji: They said he was delirious.

00:32:58.141 --> 00:33:02.008
So, I thought his temperature must be
very high. I don’t know what happened.

00:33:10.286 --> 00:33:12.019
Did anybody see him

00:33:12.219 --> 00:33:14.496
talking to much or something?

00:33:15.129 --> 00:33:16.907
Dr. Bogdan: Not really, Shri Mataji.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:21.312
He looked quite bad yesterday but now he looks all right.

00:33:21.498 --> 00:33:24.234
Shri Mataji: But what was the thing, what did he do?

00:33:29.304 --> 00:33:31.398
Dr. Bogdan: I don’t think he was delirious Mother.

00:33:31.599 --> 00:33:34.599
Shri Mataji: Not hilarious. But what was it?

00:33:37.553 --> 00:33:40.620
Dr. Bogdan: He was looking a bad colour

00:33:41.663 --> 00:33:45.000
and he was having a lot of diarrhoea and now he’s better.

00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:50.677
Shri Mataji: Let Me see your
temperature, come up! I would like to see.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:53.190
He was not that bad.

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.917
He didn’t have very high temperature, did he?

00:33:58.798 --> 00:34:01.798
But did you find him hilarious or something? Was he saying?

00:34:36.835 --> 00:34:38.844
Getting vibrations?

00:34:39.355 --> 00:34:41.895
All right. You are all right.

00:34:45.634 --> 00:34:49.440
He doesn’t have so much temperature as such to get hilarious.

00:34:50.814 --> 00:34:53.699
So must be temperature cannot be so much then.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.219
It’s not so much. Might be ninety-nine

00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.950
at the most.

00:34:59.767 --> 00:35:01.635
Dr. Bogdan: Fever was such a problem, Shri Mataji.

00:35:01.835 --> 00:35:03.620
Shri Mataji: What was the problem, is diarrhoea?

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.220
Dr. Bogdan: Just the diarrhoea and some vomiting and frustration,

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.948
people feeling weak and so on.

00:35:08.149 --> 00:35:10.378
Shri Mataji: How many times for diarrhoea?

00:35:10.578 --> 00:35:12.096
On the average.

00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.540
Dr. Bogdan: Some people had it four or five times.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.192
Some had it twenty times.

00:35:18.393 --> 00:35:21.086
Shri Mataji: That’s sick. That means sick, twenty times.

00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:23.213
And they had also vomiting?

00:35:23.414 --> 00:35:25.380
Dr. Bogdan: Yes. So, Patrice was one of these.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.340
Patrice was one who had quite a lot during the night and so on,

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.220
but he’s improving now Mother.

00:35:31.421 --> 00:35:33.260
Shri Mataji: But Patrice needed to be cleared out.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.100
Patrice you have done some
other practices isn’t it, in your seeking?

00:35:38.512 --> 00:35:41.740
Patrice, you have done something like that before?

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.020
And I think drugs.

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:47.180
That’s clearing out! It’s good for you.

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.395
Let it clear out, the drugs.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.030
Dr. Bogdan: Anyone with a fever, we just suggested they

00:35:52.231 --> 00:35:53.740
sleep on the ground in the shade

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:57.260
and let the fever be sucked out by the earth

00:35:58.056 --> 00:36:00.109
and it seems to have worked.

00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:02.580
Shri Mataji: We also put the clay on the stomach

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.620
to take out the temperature. It’s a natural way.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.260
But I think it’s drugs and bad gurus

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.660
and things spoils your

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.580
Void, and then when you come to Sahaja Yoga

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.540
it just comes out in this way.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.612
So let it be cleared out. I think Patrice had problems with his Void.

00:36:18.812 --> 00:36:20.500
I knew this long time back.

00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:23.244
Dr. Bogdan: Well it stirred up after your puja, Shri Mataji.

00:36:23.486 --> 00:36:25.860
That’s when a lot of them actually started

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.559
after your puja.

00:36:27.759 --> 00:36:29.980
So we naturally assume that it’s a clearing out

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.660
and we are not trying to stop it.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.516
Shri Mataji: No, let it be, it’s better.

00:36:33.717 --> 00:36:36.180
Must be, after puja if it has happened,

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.380
it’s very good. I think it should happen,

00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:40.087
after puja.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.580
Dr. Bogdan: Mr. Patra has been kind enough

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:51.980
to supply us with dahi, extra

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:54.300
and also black coffee

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.967
and we are giving this.

00:36:56.167 --> 00:36:58.700
Shri Mataji: But dahi in the night won’t be good.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.168
It will give you. Morning is all right.

00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:05.180
In the morning buttermilk is
much better than dahi, also; buttermilk.

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:07.460
That’s much more soothing.

00:37:07.864 --> 00:37:11.139
So if you can make buttermilk, nothing like it.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:14.900
Take more buttermilk. But coffee and buttermilk, I don’t know!!

00:37:15.382 --> 00:37:19.220
Dr. Bogdan: Can they have coffee
as a cure for the diarrhoea or not?

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.053
You direct them then Shri Mataji.

00:37:21.254 --> 00:37:24.540
Shri Mataji: I don’t know. That just stops it, that’s all.

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.408
Take buttermilk.

00:37:29.073 --> 00:37:31.860
With Isabgol take buttermilk.

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.355
Buttermilk is much better. It soothes you down.

00:37:34.556 --> 00:37:36.020
Slowly, slowly it will improve.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.220
But this coffee just stops it

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.580
and augments the whole thing. That’s not very

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.700
sensible to give a shock to your system.

00:37:46.276 --> 00:37:48.980
Coffee is just not a curative.

00:37:50.039 --> 00:37:51.961
It just stops diarrhoea.

00:37:52.161 --> 00:37:54.660
I don’t know why we should stop it. Let it be cleansed out;

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.260
unless and until you are absolutely very weak.

00:37:58.703 --> 00:38:02.020
But there’s something call ‘Electrol’ here; you get it.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:04.178
Dr. Bogdan: We are using that. Shri Mataji: That’s good.

00:38:04.379 --> 00:38:07.509
Dr. Bogdan: And also we are using rice water,

00:38:07.899 --> 00:38:11.700
when we can get it. Again Mr. Patra has been kind enough

00:38:11.995 --> 00:38:14.140
to give us this also.

00:38:14.693 --> 00:38:17.020
Shri Mataji: Yes, you could have lots of water things.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.740
I think it’s necessary sometimes to cleanse out.

00:38:21.035 --> 00:38:25.035
Also drugs – specially they should
get out of your system, very important,

00:38:26.258 --> 00:38:29.358
very important. If it is there, it should get out.

00:38:30.198 --> 00:38:34.197
If it is happening after my puja I think it’s stirring up inside.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:38.449
But you just look after they don’t get too much of diarrhoea,

00:38:38.676 --> 00:38:41.263
and too much of temperature.

00:38:41.463 --> 00:38:44.110
But temperature, if it’s a hundred and two, I don’t think it’s much.

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:45.780
But if it is more than that,

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:47.700
then you have to be careful.

00:38:48.393 --> 00:38:50.620
I was rather concerned, you know,

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.140
I came to know about your sickness!

00:38:54.717 --> 00:38:57.620
And don’t think too much about sickness, also.

00:38:58.024 --> 00:38:59.915
Now I have to talk – please be seated

00:39:00.115 --> 00:39:03.059
– to, little bit, to the Australians; because for me Australians,

00:39:04.582 --> 00:39:07.947
and because for me Australians, English,

00:39:08.148 --> 00:39:11.170
French – all of you are my children.

00:39:11.371 --> 00:39:14.031
And we all should know everything about everything.

00:39:14.232 --> 00:39:16.940
So there should be no exclusion of

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.845
Australians or anybody.

00:39:19.045 --> 00:39:20.723
This can happen to anyone

00:39:20.923 --> 00:39:24.100
and Australia being such a powerful Sahaja Yogi

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.980
country that it has happened there, is a very sad thing.

00:39:28.712 --> 00:39:32.226
We have had three shocks, one after another in Australia.

00:39:32.426 --> 00:39:35.060
I think there are two types of people in Australia.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.660
One type who are all the time very dominating type

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.820
and try to take over. And there’s another type

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.300
which is extremely obedient and subservient.

00:39:46.546 --> 00:39:50.180
They haven’t kept their heads open.

00:39:50.467 --> 00:39:52.660
You are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:39:52.947 --> 00:39:55.260
and nobody has business to dominate you

00:39:55.461 --> 00:39:57.300
or to take advantage of you

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.820
or to organise you in that way.

00:40:01.535 --> 00:40:03.660
Any leader who does that

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.940
has to pay for it very heavily.

00:40:10.209 --> 00:40:13.260
And also the

00:40:13.891 --> 00:40:15.740
part that the wife has to play

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.420
as the leader’s wife, she has to understand that

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.980
she is just a mother and she has no authority

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.100
as a leader’s wife.

00:40:28.932 --> 00:40:30.900
In the case of

00:40:31.306 --> 00:40:33.300
Australia we have had

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.271
lots of problems,

00:40:35.472 --> 00:40:37.620
because Australians

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.003
have a special feeling for their wives

00:40:41.203 --> 00:40:44.220
– I don’t know why – in Sahaja Yoga, otherwise not.

00:40:45.616 --> 00:40:47.940
I think the greatest

00:40:49.344 --> 00:40:53.100
temptation they have is to have a family.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.287
Australians have this greatest temptation

00:40:57.487 --> 00:40:59.100
that, “We must have a family!”

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.980
“We must look after our family!” this, that.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.098
And this might have come because

00:41:07.299 --> 00:41:09.140
people have seen broken families,

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.551
they have seen the problems of broken families,

00:41:11.751 --> 00:41:14.220
and there have been so much writings about it

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.484
that, “We should not neglect our family,

00:41:16.685 --> 00:41:18.260
you should look after your children,

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.580
look after wives and this and that.”

00:41:21.717 --> 00:41:25.020
Of course in Sahaja Yoga we respect family very much

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.020
but not beyond the bigger family.

00:41:31.564 --> 00:41:34.050
About James I have to tell you one thing that,

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:36.704
he gave me the greatest shock!

00:41:37.397 --> 00:41:39.138
The first shock came

00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:40.848
from his cousin, whom you

00:41:41.049 --> 00:41:42.900
know, Terence,

00:41:43.388 --> 00:41:46.053
whose wife was Indian but she, also in his ego,

00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:48.940
became like a small “mataji”.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:53.307
She used to order about, “I will have this, I will not.”

00:41:53.507 --> 00:41:56.900
They would occupy my room and enjoy there.

00:41:57.898 --> 00:42:01.180
Then came Mr. Warren. He was another horrid fellow!

00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:06.380
You see, such leaders are coming out of that place I am surprised.

00:42:06.886 --> 00:42:10.038
Then he came here; he never told me that he was paid money

00:42:10.238 --> 00:42:13.472
or he collected money, nothing of the kind. I never knew anything.

00:42:13.996 --> 00:42:17.620
Only once in that, somebody remarked that he has been collecting

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.737
money so I asked him, “What money are you collecting?”

00:42:21.277 --> 00:42:23.301
Without my knowledge he did so many things,

00:42:23.501 --> 00:42:26.340
and I’ve never known such people before!

00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.018
Though I was telling him, “Your Nabhi is
catching, Mooladhara catching,” this, that.

00:42:31.219 --> 00:42:34.499
But I never knew that there could be people of that level!

00:42:38.424 --> 00:42:41.471
So we had, in the same

00:42:42.147 --> 00:42:44.188
relationship, James there.

00:42:44.389 --> 00:42:46.578
James was a very simple man, no doubt.

00:42:46.779 --> 00:42:48.827
When he first came to see me

00:42:49.028 --> 00:42:51.580
he was very upset. I said, “James why are you upset?”

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:54.420
He said, “Mother, I have an air hostess…”

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.483
I am telling you all these things
because I have to talk with you about it.

00:42:57.684 --> 00:43:00.660
“..an air hostess who is my wife but she doesn’t stay with me.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.341
She has to stay in Sydney. I am working here

00:43:03.541 --> 00:43:05.740
and I don’t know why

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.843
she doesn’t write to me much. I go, send her presents,

00:43:09.044 --> 00:43:11.090
I see her very often, all that.”

00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:13.750
So I told him, “James, if you don’t mind, I’ll tell you the truth.”

00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:15.740
He said, “No, no, Mother, please tell me the truth.”

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:17.788
I said, “Already she is carrying on with another man.

00:43:17.989 --> 00:43:19.700
She has nothing to do with you.”

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:21.471
And he was shocked.

00:43:21.981 --> 00:43:25.100
Then I soothed him. I said, “You better call her.”

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.763
So he went to Sydney and called her

00:43:26.963 --> 00:43:29.601
and she got herself very nicely dressed, she came for the dinner.

00:43:29.854 --> 00:43:33.677
And there she openly told him that
she’s already living with another man.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:36.200
That’s how he came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:36.811 --> 00:43:39.763
So his first marriage was broken. After coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:43:39.963 --> 00:43:41.460
he wanted to have

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:43.663
another marriage.

00:43:43.779 --> 00:43:46.980
That was all right. Then his this girl, Diane,

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.599
she wanted to marry him.

00:43:50.789 --> 00:43:53.580
Now I don’t have any idea about this homosexuality.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:57.680
To be very frank, today I don’t understand what is this nonsense.

00:43:58.267 --> 00:43:59.935
And that the women are homosexual

00:44:00.135 --> 00:44:03.035
I have never heard of this before! We have never known.

00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:05.746
I didn’t know that she was that kind

00:44:05.946 --> 00:44:07.556
of a person.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.860
But of course she was not so normal,

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.519
but she was after me. She wanted to marry

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:18.660
Terrance and then to James.

00:44:19.683 --> 00:44:21.940
I told her, “Terrance is not good for you

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.152
but James you can marry.”

00:44:24.352 --> 00:44:27.043
She was after me that she wanted to get married.

00:44:27.763 --> 00:44:29.820
“All right.” I said, “You can marry James.”

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.633
There were not many girls in those days

00:44:31.833 --> 00:44:34.835
but James wanted to have a wife somehow.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:37.490
So he married this girl.

00:44:38.584 --> 00:44:41.606
Now I have got letters which Mathias has given me

00:44:41.806 --> 00:44:44.024
written from his wife who went down.

00:44:44.163 --> 00:44:47.500
I agree that his wife carried lots of bhoots with him. But

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.110
the fraternity worked and she and another eight girls

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:52.980
just jumped on her

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.780
and they formed a formidable group there

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:00.620
which I have got now a complete record and complete

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.665
report about them, how they were dominating.

00:45:04.865 --> 00:45:08.860
They were very hard women, dominating all the rest of them there.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.760
And such regulations and rules she started.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:17.060
It happened in the beginning when
I asked her to get out and go to Ruth.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.860
Because the ladies came and told me.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.620
She went to Ruth. There she knew that she will lose everything.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.460
She behaved herself nicely, everything.

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:29.220
I said, “All right, you go back.” So it was not a possession

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.994
but a kind of that homosexual

00:45:32.494 --> 00:45:35.020
aggressiveness in her.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:39.346
Then Mathias has given me her letters when she went,

00:45:39.546 --> 00:45:42.620
his wife went there. It’s absurd letters.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.340
She used to sleep with her

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:46.460
and she used to hug her.

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:49.259
She used to kiss her and do all kinds of things

00:45:49.459 --> 00:45:52.580
with a lady who has gone there to get cured!

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.230
And they were very important people!

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.480
She was a very important person.

00:45:59.182 --> 00:46:02.260
Another person I know is Patrick’s wife, Patrickäs wife.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.900
She went down there

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.460
and she didn’t get better. On the contrary, she became worse.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.780
And I told Patrick

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.700
and Patrick has been there.

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.140
He was so much influenced by these two persons

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:17.300
because they tried to show that all the rest of the world is very bad,

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.940
they are very unkind, we are very loving people,

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:22.022
we are very nice, this, that,

00:46:22.222 --> 00:46:25.700
and Patrick is something great,
you see, just pampered his ego perhaps.

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:28.519
Poor Patrick is such a simple-hearted fellow!

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.540
He came to France

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.390
and I was to speak.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.839
I had to speak that time.

00:46:35.039 --> 00:46:37.020
I said, “Patrick, why don’t you translate me?”

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.820
He just couldn’t utter a word.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:40.900
He was tongue-tied.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.060
He said, “Mother, what has happened to me?”

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.220
He said some honey bees or something has caught him.

00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.980
I said, “No honey bees. This is some Australian honey bees!”

00:46:52.298 --> 00:46:54.315
So one must understand that though

00:46:54.515 --> 00:46:57.848
the quantity of Australians has increased, quality has to go.

00:46:58.049 --> 00:47:01.043
Moreover, group forming is a very common thing

00:47:01.244 --> 00:47:03.405
in Australia which is very wrong.

00:47:03.605 --> 00:47:05.463
When you are increasing this way

00:47:05.663 --> 00:47:08.500
you must know that you must also increase this way.

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:10.927
And all this happened last year

00:47:11.127 --> 00:47:13.260
when the Indians also reported to me that

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:15.285
“Australians are all possessed!”

00:47:15.485 --> 00:47:17.468
I said, “Really?” “Yes,

00:47:17.669 --> 00:47:20.004
they always sing, ‘Australia is great.

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:22.100
Australia is great,’

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:25.380
and they are saying all these things.”

00:47:25.899 --> 00:47:27.942
And they said they were taking their own decisions.

00:47:28.142 --> 00:47:30.821
There was one Mr. Charles who was off his head!

00:47:31.022 --> 00:47:32.836
He was like a Hitler.

00:47:33.036 --> 00:47:35.220
That’s what the Indians told me.

00:47:36.593 --> 00:47:38.540
I was quite shocked!

00:47:39.561 --> 00:47:41.660
Then they lost the sari, they found the sari.

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:44.180
And I could see now there’s something going on.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.260
my attention was not there.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:48.227
But on my birthday

00:47:48.428 --> 00:47:51.540
I telephoned to James because not a single

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:54.640
flower came from Australia on my birthday.

00:47:56.333 --> 00:47:59.770
As it is, I have noticed one thing with this lady, his wife,

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:03.054
she has been extremely miserly as far as giving presents to me.

00:48:03.254 --> 00:48:06.860
I mean, so miserly, it’s so stupid the way

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.271
she gave me a little brooch like that
once when I came for Australian tour.

00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:12.178
She need not have given!

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:18.164
And even after all this, she sent me a nylon,

00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:20.421
what you call that is a,

00:48:20.622 --> 00:48:24.088
for keeping handkerchiefs, a little packet like that!

00:48:26.212 --> 00:48:30.100
So stupid she is! She has no sense of any kind!

00:48:31.039 --> 00:48:33.900
And she was getting from bad to worse.

00:48:37.446 --> 00:48:38.980
And on this side,

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.446
you see, when I telephoned from my house,

00:48:43.227 --> 00:48:46.593
they said, “James has gone.” Nobody
wished me anything on the phone, nothing!

00:48:46.793 --> 00:48:49.893
“…James has gone to New Zealand.”

00:48:50.768 --> 00:48:53.690
I said, “All right.” I telephoned to New Zealand.

00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:56.317
What I find, he didn’t wished me.

00:48:56.518 --> 00:48:59.220
I said, “James, do you know, today is my birthday?” “Oh, yes, yes,

00:48:59.421 --> 00:49:01.043
yesterday we celebrated

00:49:01.604 --> 00:49:03.219
in Australia.”

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:05.390
“What? You can’t even say it,

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:07.620
‘Mother, happy returns,’ or something?”

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:09.453
Not a single flower to me?

00:49:09.653 --> 00:49:13.540
As if my photograph has become
the reality and I have become unreal!

00:49:14.506 --> 00:49:16.371
See, how

00:49:16.657 --> 00:49:18.289
this kind of thing works.

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:21.431
This is a mass mesmerism.

00:49:22.656 --> 00:49:24.260
What happened to Hitler

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:27.580
can happen to you all; is a mass mesmerism.

00:49:28.256 --> 00:49:30.964
Because of this lady, she had such a grip over him.

00:49:31.164 --> 00:49:32.860
I knew this!

00:49:33.147 --> 00:49:36.500
And I told him many a times,
“You have only one weakness, James, that

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:40.380
your first marriage was a failure and
you want to show that your second marriage

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:43.459
is successful and that’s why you are running after your wife

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.324
and you are so much at her feet.

00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:49.820
But know that you are her husband and you are the leader.”

00:49:52.435 --> 00:49:54.380
So you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.156
You are the temple of God.

00:49:56.357 --> 00:49:58.002
You are special people.

00:49:58.203 --> 00:50:01.538
Australia specially has to be very, very careful.

00:50:01.739 --> 00:50:03.790
And also I think the Indians who went from here

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:07.042
were not such good Sahaja Yogis, I must admit.

00:50:07.242 --> 00:50:10.181
They turned out to be a little bit hanky-panky and

00:50:10.726 --> 00:50:12.260
not so deep;

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:13.968
I agree with you.

00:50:14.351 --> 00:50:17.395
So the help came from nowhere.

00:50:18.697 --> 00:50:21.082
So we are just increasing sideways.

00:50:21.283 --> 00:50:25.283
Then they never consulted me on
anything that they were sending money to

00:50:25.484 --> 00:50:27.660
Warren. I never knew.

00:50:28.189 --> 00:50:30.829
I also did not know that they have changed the school

00:50:31.029 --> 00:50:32.660
from Melbourne.

00:50:33.158 --> 00:50:35.613
When I saw the photograph of the children they were all,

00:50:35.813 --> 00:50:39.140
eyes were like this, you see. None of them had straight eyes!

00:50:39.497 --> 00:50:41.525
Little, little babies.

00:50:41.725 --> 00:50:43.647
I said, “What has happened?”

00:50:43.848 --> 00:50:45.803
I was so concerned.

00:50:46.004 --> 00:50:48.538
Then I learned that they have changed the school

00:50:48.739 --> 00:50:51.780
from Melbourne – then I learned!! They never asked me

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:55.780
– to Sydney, because his children were studying in the school!

00:50:57.333 --> 00:51:00.872
So it was all manoeuvred for one family there

00:51:01.244 --> 00:51:03.780
and people could not see that.

00:51:10.051 --> 00:51:13.602
They never told me that they were moving the school from there.

00:51:14.155 --> 00:51:17.860
And this gentleman Paul who was running the school himself

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:21.340
had a horrible, horrible, horrible wife.

00:51:21.807 --> 00:51:24.042
He had no children from her, nothing,

00:51:24.243 --> 00:51:27.420
and she just, she wouldn’t leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:27.871 --> 00:51:31.075
And he was such a slave to her.
I don’t know what was in her, that woman,

00:51:31.276 --> 00:51:34.198
when she was such a catching
woman that whenever she came in the

00:51:34.398 --> 00:51:36.620
room, even outside I could make out that she is there,

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.540
such a catching person.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.860
Right from Mooladhara up to any point.

00:51:42.741 --> 00:51:44.769
And he never felt her.

00:51:47.448 --> 00:51:49.850
And very cunning also!

00:51:50.537 --> 00:51:52.725
A very cunning woman.

00:51:55.514 --> 00:51:58.420
She came to me and she said to me, “Mother,

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.930
teach me how to recognise you.”

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:03.700
I said, “I’m sorry. I can’t teach you that.”

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:11.420
That is the level of people who took over.

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.500
In Sahaja Yoga, I would not put them anywhere,

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:18.580
like Diane, like this lady and Paul also.

00:52:19.144 --> 00:52:22.140
And now Paul and they have joined hands.

00:52:23.226 --> 00:52:27.226
And James, I think, would like to go out of Sahaja Yoga

00:52:28.641 --> 00:52:32.641
because he must save his family which is so precious for him!

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.514
People do not realise

00:52:37.715 --> 00:52:41.580
what a tremendous work we are doing today in Sahaja Yoga

00:52:41.928 --> 00:52:43.925
– what a great thing we are doing.

00:52:44.126 --> 00:52:46.780
Tomorrow you will be the foundations

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.203
stones of this great image I have

00:52:49.403 --> 00:52:52.533
about The Golden Age of the whole world!

00:52:52.733 --> 00:52:54.548
You are not ordinary people!

00:52:54.749 --> 00:52:57.700
And you shouldn’t behave like ordinary people.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.203
Of course if there’s anything wrong,

00:53:02.403 --> 00:53:04.700
I can point it out and say to you.

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.300
But if even knowingly something wrong if you do it,

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.692
how far can I go with you?

00:53:12.374 --> 00:53:15.229
And this hugging business and

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:17.020
this kissing business

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.820
is just a vulgar thing, I think.

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:23.299
There’s no need. Of course you can
hug when you meet for the first time.

00:53:23.499 --> 00:53:25.900
But morning till evening if you hug somebody

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:28.500
six times, I mean, it’s a headache!

00:53:31.154 --> 00:53:34.125
There’s no need to hug someone all the time

00:53:34.326 --> 00:53:36.358
and to kiss someone all the time.

00:53:36.664 --> 00:53:37.979
What is it?

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:40.180
After all, if you meet somebody for the first time,

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.803
you do feel that exuberance of your

00:53:43.004 --> 00:53:46.220
own expression of love, then you can hug somebody.

00:53:49.421 --> 00:53:53.145
And too much regulations in an ashram is not allowed.

00:53:53.734 --> 00:53:57.389
You are all independent, free Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:00.549
You all should grow with your own independence.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.963
But it does not mean in any
case that you should be rude to your

00:54:04.163 --> 00:54:06.180
leaders or anything.

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:11.610
The leader has to be very fatherly and has to be very righteous

00:54:11.811 --> 00:54:13.958
and should not play into the hands of his wife

00:54:14.158 --> 00:54:16.020
– that’s one thing sure.

00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:23.645
And then you people have to know that

00:54:23.846 --> 00:54:27.283
you are all individually Sahaja Yogis.

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:30.552
None of these big, big rishis and munis

00:54:30.752 --> 00:54:33.541
could not give Realisation as you are giving.

00:54:33.742 --> 00:54:35.706
You don’t know your powers.

00:54:35.907 --> 00:54:38.220
You don’t know your position.

00:54:41.062 --> 00:54:43.820
And if some leader is of that kind,

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:46.107
you should immediately write to me.

00:54:46.307 --> 00:54:48.500
I am still existing.

00:54:53.832 --> 00:54:55.620
So James has shocked me the most.

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:58.940
I loved him so much. I have done so much for him.

00:54:59.736 --> 00:55:01.661
And he’s played into the hands of his wife.

00:55:01.861 --> 00:55:05.300
I knew one day either he’ll fall this way or that way.

00:55:06.642 --> 00:55:09.419
His children got terrible diseases.

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:12.655
They would have been dead because of this woman.

00:55:12.874 --> 00:55:15.830
She is not deep. She has no feelings for me,

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:17.695
nothing of the kind.

00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:21.722
She would buy very… I could go
in the bathroom and I would see very

00:55:21.922 --> 00:55:24.113
every time very expensive,

00:55:24.314 --> 00:55:26.717
toilet... I mean, what do you call them?

00:55:27.116 --> 00:55:30.820
make-ups and… I never use these things, never!

00:55:31.368 --> 00:55:33.300
So I used to wonder, “For whom is she buying?”

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.620
Every time I went, she bought something very expensive,

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:39.500
something French, Swiss, this, that,

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.203
kept there. For whom?

00:55:41.404 --> 00:55:44.503
And she would every time change all the

00:55:44.704 --> 00:55:47.198
curtains and everything. And all that,

00:55:47.398 --> 00:55:49.020
for whom?

00:55:57.773 --> 00:55:59.900
I am just wondering

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.028
how many of you can understand

00:56:03.229 --> 00:56:05.300
that a person without any depth

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.820
cannot lead you anywhere.

00:56:10.154 --> 00:56:12.291
Anybody who tries to show off,

00:56:12.491 --> 00:56:14.100
if you run after that person

00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:17.420
that means you have not fathomed your own depth.

00:56:19.186 --> 00:56:21.700
You must know what is your depth.

00:56:23.635 --> 00:56:25.820
And don’t get impressed by somebody

00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:29.778
because he can dominate you very well and you can go about.

00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.803
Just stand on your own two legs

00:56:38.003 --> 00:56:40.860
and see for yourself. And I don’t believe in

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:44.620
any rules and regulations for Sahaja Yogis as such

00:56:44.906 --> 00:56:47.705
– that you can meet your wife only at this time,

00:56:47.906 --> 00:56:50.020
husband at that time.

00:56:53.698 --> 00:56:55.562
You are swachanda:

00:56:55.763 --> 00:56:58.860
‘swa’ is your ‘Spirit’ and ‘chanda’ is

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.518
‘at the disposal of your

00:57:01.719 --> 00:57:03.219
Atma’.

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:07.180
And when you are that you become absolutely collective also.

00:57:11.506 --> 00:57:15.460
And these jealousies and this petty-mindedness is not necessary.

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:17.460
You are all

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.635
universal personalities. You have to be that great.

00:57:20.836 --> 00:57:22.675
You don’t belong to any country.

00:57:22.876 --> 00:57:24.924
Just to make it convenient

00:57:25.124 --> 00:57:27.381
I use the name of the countries,

00:57:27.581 --> 00:57:31.013
but if I say north, south, east, west,

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:32.955
I don’t know how will I manage it.

00:57:33.155 --> 00:57:36.157
Because the whole system otherwise works this way, that

00:57:36.358 --> 00:57:38.580
you have our Qantas

00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.931
going to Australia, you have this to that.

00:57:41.131 --> 00:57:43.500
So you have to take to these countries as such but

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.856
for me they don’t exist.

00:57:46.174 --> 00:57:48.779
Even the directions don’t exist for me.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.780
You are all my children

00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:54.115
and I just can’t think in that way.

00:57:54.316 --> 00:57:57.620
Please don’t consider yourself, any way,

00:57:57.820 --> 00:58:01.240
even if you are away from me all my attention is there.

00:58:05.226 --> 00:58:08.940
And you all can directly write to me.

00:58:09.624 --> 00:58:12.860
You can all send me flowers directly.

00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.530
They said, “The rule was

00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:18.926
that it is to be done through the leaders.” Not at all.

00:58:19.127 --> 00:58:21.180
You can send me flowers

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.280
anytime you want too.

00:58:23.481 --> 00:58:26.020
I mean, my relationship is… Who are these leaders?

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:28.788
Just it’s a mockery, if you understand that.

00:58:28.989 --> 00:58:30.670
It’s a mockery.

00:58:34.428 --> 00:58:37.220
One should not in any way think that they stand

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:39.484
in between you and me; not at all.

00:58:39.685 --> 00:58:41.860
Only thing is if somebody is troublesome

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.596
or possessed or something,

00:58:43.796 --> 00:58:46.398
then naturally you can try to keep that person out.

00:58:46.598 --> 00:58:49.260
But he’s not a Sahaja Yogi by any chance.

00:58:50.894 --> 00:58:52.411
But otherwise

00:58:52.611 --> 00:58:54.598
there should be no barrier between you and me.

00:58:54.798 --> 00:58:57.340
I’ll not stand it at any cost.

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.340
No barrier between any one of you and me.

00:59:00.541 --> 00:59:03.220
And you should never feel shy to tell me

00:59:03.796 --> 00:59:06.820
and you should always tell me what your problems are.

00:59:08.116 --> 00:59:09.618
Always.

00:59:09.818 --> 00:59:11.500
I’m always available for you,

00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:14.700
for every one of you, each one of you.

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:20.673
One should never just decide

00:59:21.149 --> 00:59:23.557
that, “All right, Mother may not like.”

00:59:23.758 --> 00:59:27.136
I may like or not like. It’s not the point. You have to tell me.

00:59:28.502 --> 00:59:31.217
I will like it more that you tell me

00:59:31.417 --> 00:59:34.780
than not to tell me and hide things from me.

00:59:37.457 --> 00:59:41.457
There’s no official relationship between me and you.

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:43.940
It is a protocol, after all, but

00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.940
protocol doesn’t mean ‘official’.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.620
Protocol means when you are addressing to me

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:52.300
you cannot just call, “Hey you!” Like that you cannot say to me.

00:59:54.181 --> 00:59:56.260
And even if you say, I wouldn’t mind!

00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:59.571
I wouldn’t mind after all.

00:59:59.804 --> 01:00:02.660
But children don’t say that way.

01:00:06.127 --> 01:00:09.500
You see, a certain amount of understanding should be there.

01:00:11.318 --> 01:00:13.020
And

01:00:13.995 --> 01:00:16.940
you must feel my love in your heart,

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:18.660
that’s all.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:22.020
I don’t want to make anybody unhappy.

01:00:23.307 --> 01:00:26.740
Sahaja Yoga has come to make you extremely happy, joyous

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:28.580
and peaceful.

01:00:29.539 --> 01:00:31.100
That’s the purpose.

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.198
Not to disturb you by any chance,

01:00:33.398 --> 01:00:36.083
not to in any way irritate you

01:00:36.283 --> 01:00:38.022
or make you miserable.

01:00:38.222 --> 01:00:39.805
The other day I have said it that,

01:00:40.005 --> 01:00:42.860
“Those who do not want to continue with their marriages

01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:45.820
can take the divorces if they are miserable.”

01:00:46.084 --> 01:00:49.380
But without rhyme and reason one should not do that.

01:00:49.595 --> 01:00:52.008
It should not be a kind of a, now a

01:00:52.209 --> 01:00:55.660
If you do not enjoy each other’s company there’s no force on you.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.460
I’ll never be angry for that, at all.

01:01:02.583 --> 01:01:05.754
So I would like to know what you want.

01:01:05.955 --> 01:01:09.540
Even small things if you ask me I’ll be very happy.

01:01:11.779 --> 01:01:14.612
Anything that you want, anything

01:01:14.813 --> 01:01:16.460
you would like to tell me.

01:01:16.661 --> 01:01:18.963
Little, little things, children, you should see me;

01:01:19.163 --> 01:01:21.700
they sit down round me, we have a conference and they tell me,

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:25.380
“You know, Mataji, what happened,” like that they go on telling me.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.780
It’s so nice to talk to them.

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:32.330
It’s true nobody’s greater than your Mother.

01:01:32.531 --> 01:01:35.500
But nobody’s greater than my children also!

01:01:37.068 --> 01:01:39.321
To me they are very great.

01:01:41.203 --> 01:01:43.670
So please remember: respect yourself.

01:01:44.266 --> 01:01:47.754
You are all great Yogis, great people:

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:50.619
born to transform the whole universe

01:01:50.819 --> 01:01:53.621
into a beautiful globe

01:01:54.499 --> 01:01:56.418
which is being promised.

01:01:56.636 --> 01:01:58.874
This is the culmination,

01:01:59.108 --> 01:02:01.180
culmination point

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:05.260
where all the prophets, all the incarnations,

01:02:05.466 --> 01:02:08.419
all the saints have worked very hard to create;

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:11.140
and there where you have to come up.

01:02:16.301 --> 01:02:18.980
We have to do everything that is possible to

01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:20.987
make it a success.

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:23.980
And we are quite a lot of people ourselves.

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.736
Now if you have any questions you can ask me,

01:02:27.937 --> 01:02:29.387
will be a good idea.

01:02:29.587 --> 01:02:31.423
Any other questions.

01:02:34.817 --> 01:02:37.740
There’s a girl from Austria,

01:02:38.644 --> 01:02:41.970
I would like to neutralise her marriage with this Roha fellow.

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:44.745
And we can find somebody for her.

01:02:45.339 --> 01:02:47.820
All right? Where is she?

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.595
Can you stand up?

01:02:53.509 --> 01:02:55.651
All right, that’s been neutralised,

01:02:55.851 --> 01:02:58.951
and we’ll find somebody good for you. All right?

01:02:59.296 --> 01:03:00.796
May God bless you!

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:05.552
Then there is somebody? Elisabeth from Australia.

01:03:06.743 --> 01:03:09.532
If you want you can take a divorce with your husband.

01:03:09.682 --> 01:03:11.182
Who is she?

01:03:14.105 --> 01:03:15.605
Please stand up.

01:03:17.765 --> 01:03:19.265
Is she not here?

01:03:21.223 --> 01:03:22.723
I can’t see her.

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:27.696
Yogi: She’s coming on Monday. Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

01:03:28.291 --> 01:03:29.791
All right.

01:03:30.043 --> 01:03:33.700
You can take a divorce if you are not happy with your husband.

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.400
All right?

01:03:42.814 --> 01:03:44.494
There is no harm in that.

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:47.300
But one should understand that

01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:49.795
nobody should insult anyone.

01:03:49.996 --> 01:03:53.253
Maybe there are some disparities, some temperaments

01:03:53.453 --> 01:03:56.987
and you can marry the one you like but better marry a Sahaja Yogi.

01:03:57.187 --> 01:04:00.020
If you marry a non-Sahaja Yogi it’s a headache for me

01:04:00.432 --> 01:04:03.940
then to make him a Sahaja Yogi or this thing, that thing.

01:04:08.485 --> 01:04:10.140
Anything else?

01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:14.420
Regarding these marriages, anybody has any objections now?

01:04:17.902 --> 01:04:20.177
Anybody? Please come up.

01:04:20.847 --> 01:04:23.858
Because after that now I’ll see only when you’ll be dressed

01:04:24.058 --> 01:04:25.940
as brides and bridegrooms

01:04:28.815 --> 01:04:30.638
and that’s so beautiful,

01:04:30.838 --> 01:04:33.657
heavenly. Anybody who has.

01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:40.500
Nick, I think, can you take that out a little bit, yes, thank you.

01:04:42.761 --> 01:04:44.820
Anyone?

01:04:50.285 --> 01:04:52.967
Are you all satisfied? Sahaja Yogis: Yes.

01:04:53.217 --> 01:04:56.217
Shri Mataji: All right. So, may God bless you!

01:04:57.994 --> 01:04:59.499
Don’t be afraid.

01:04:59.699 --> 01:05:02.140
Even if you feel shy you can write to me

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.260
because there’s a chance, still. If you
do not want to marry, better not marry.

01:05:07.724 --> 01:05:10.860
Because you know, at random we had to do many things.

01:05:11.061 --> 01:05:14.180
Then I re-collected, then I again

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:17.380
corrected it, then we again collected some names,

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:21.300
and it’s lots of things. Poor Yogi has gone thin with it!

01:05:21.744 --> 01:05:24.900
Even David Spiro has lost some weight!

01:05:28.747 --> 01:05:31.220
Because I used to change every

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.340
second day and poor Yogi

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.287
had to type, sit down, typing again.

01:05:35.488 --> 01:05:37.620
Then I would change again he would type again.

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.740
Like that it was going on.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:42.980
So if there’s anything like that, you please let me know.

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:46.160
And now we are going to

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:48.220
Ganapatipule

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:50.620
to enjoy.

01:05:51.384 --> 01:05:54.211
So forget that you are Australians, forget that you are…

01:05:54.411 --> 01:05:56.540
And you are just universal people.

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:59.620
And we are all going to be one
and we are going to enjoy ourselves

01:05:59.820 --> 01:06:02.380
thoroughly in Ganapatipule.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:05.011
And I have made all arrangements for you

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:07.187
and you can have as much as you like,

01:06:07.387 --> 01:06:09.900
yours aerated waters if you like

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.620
or they are going to give you juices as much, free.

01:06:14.797 --> 01:06:18.052
Nobody has to pay for anything, it’s all free there.

01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:20.780
And there are going to be mango juices, whatever you like.

01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.540
But I think mango juice is not so
good for people who have diarrhoea!!

01:06:40.432 --> 01:06:42.883
No, I’m not frightening you, it’s a fact.

01:06:43.083 --> 01:06:45.620
It’s a fact. You can ask anyone.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:48.759
We know, all Indians know that it’s very hot

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.846
and it creates heat in the stomach.

01:06:51.047 --> 01:06:52.736
Though it’s very tasty.

01:06:53.775 --> 01:06:56.300
So they are going to supply you with all kinds of juices.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.060
I have made all the nice recipes

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:02.410
and things I have given them. Baba is going to be there.

01:07:02.610 --> 01:07:04.980
And I hope food will be nice.

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:08.620
And also they have made nice
arrangements with the bathrooms and things.

01:07:08.820 --> 01:07:10.580
Be careful only that don’t

01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.698
drink any water anywhere.

01:07:12.899 --> 01:07:15.220
Anyone who wants to stay

01:07:15.804 --> 01:07:17.900
under the cement can also

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:21.003
do it because we have got one or two rooms free.

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:23.475
So anybody who wants to stay under the cement can come

01:07:23.676 --> 01:07:25.605
but it’s better to stay under the sky.

01:07:25.805 --> 01:07:27.740
Wish I could do myself.

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.790
So we have got a

01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:34.380
proper arrangements made there.
The Indians are working very hard

01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:37.580
and I really don’t know how to thank them.

01:07:37.780 --> 01:07:40.860
They are all here, so only thing what we can do

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:43.100
is to give them a hand.

01:08:01.095 --> 01:08:04.628
Only thing is you must make friends with them, talk to them

01:08:05.003 --> 01:08:07.500
and get friendly with them

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.288
– it’s nice

01:08:09.488 --> 01:08:12.340
– because you just come here as guests but, after all,

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:15.020
you should talk to them and meet all of them

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:17.780
and you will be very happy to know so many things about them.

01:08:17.981 --> 01:08:20.980
They must be wondering why I am telling you such simple things,

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:24.300
like “Don’t take cold water after

01:08:24.507 --> 01:08:27.228
coming from the sun,” because they all know this very well.

01:08:27.429 --> 01:08:29.380
So, you see, little, little things they’ll tell you

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.740
because this is a different country with a different climate.

01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:33.820
So it’s better that you learn from them.

01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.491
As one has to learn something in the West

01:08:36.691 --> 01:08:39.100
about their mannerism and

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:42.468
about their styles, in the same
way you have to learn certain things.

01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:46.060
So, I am sure you all are looking forward to your visit.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:50.220
Tomorrow you all can go to Kolhapur for your purchases

01:08:52.515 --> 01:08:55.765
and day after tomorrow if you want

01:08:55.966 --> 01:08:58.301
to do some purchasing even,

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:00.338
tomorrow,

01:09:00.538 --> 01:09:02.794
day after you can do.

01:09:04.783 --> 01:09:07.177
You see the buses can leave then at about

01:09:07.378 --> 01:09:08.901
say one o’clock

01:09:09.101 --> 01:09:10.607
or two o’clock.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.300
I’m sorry I forgot:

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.773
S. Govind, the Jeweller has invited you for lunch.

01:09:29.494 --> 01:09:32.773
So you can, in the morning, if you want go for shopping,

01:09:32.973 --> 01:09:34.500
you can do it, you come for lunch

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.755
to his place. He’s so anxious. I told him.

01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:40.860
He has invited hundred more
relations of his to get Realisation and things.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.060
Imagine! He’s a Jain gentleman.

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.770
He’s such a wonderful person!

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:47.460
So he has invited you all.

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.879
So you will have food at his place. It’s a vegetarian food.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:54.152
And after that you are leaving for Ganapatipule.

01:09:54.353 --> 01:09:56.635
You will reach there quite in the evening.

01:09:56.836 --> 01:09:59.300
I hope you’ll keep yourself covered properly

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.586
and don’t take too much dust inside yourself.

01:10:03.082 --> 01:10:05.185
Try to work it out

01:10:05.439 --> 01:10:08.164
that you all feel all right by the time you go there.

01:10:08.365 --> 01:10:10.820
Now this is only for the people who have diarrhoea.

01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.620
And those who have constipation should not take it.

01:10:25.811 --> 01:10:28.887
We are going to have a nice time, I hope so. looking forward.

01:10:29.088 --> 01:10:33.088
Moreover I think this time it has been a very dynamic programme.

01:10:33.966 --> 01:10:37.180
I felt people were just stirred up and

01:10:37.389 --> 01:10:39.980
spiritually also the people are very much enriched

01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:41.700
and it’s quite

01:10:42.993 --> 01:10:46.060
visible now that people have become very wiser

01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:49.973
and satisfied and settled down and matured.

01:10:50.296 --> 01:10:52.879
This tour, somehow or other has

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.500
been very dynamic, I think,

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.153
and it has worked very well.

01:10:58.354 --> 01:11:01.604
But still – you try to meditate in the morning if possible.

01:11:01.805 --> 01:11:04.418
All of you should do some meditation in the morning.

01:11:04.619 --> 01:11:06.980
I know we have been sleeping at 4.30

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.740
getting up at 5 o’clock is difficult!

01:11:13.332 --> 01:11:16.100
Tomorrow morning you can have a nice meditation and then

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:17.940
go for your shopping.

01:11:18.852 --> 01:11:21.300
So the loading has to be done.

01:11:27.176 --> 01:11:29.342
So day after tomorrow

01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:31.793
you have to load your buses.

01:11:31.993 --> 01:11:33.660
That you can do in the morning time

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:36.560
because tomorrow there’s no program as such.

01:11:45.304 --> 01:11:47.803
No evening program, no music.

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:50.267
And then you come back here, sleep well,

01:11:50.467 --> 01:11:52.100
next day have your meditation

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.501
and load your buses

01:11:54.701 --> 01:11:57.380
and go to Kolhapur. If you want to go for shopping

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.544
you can do it but come for the lunch at about,

01:12:01.707 --> 01:12:04.380
about twelve o’clock you have to be there, twelve or one.

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.828
And then after lunch you have to leave.

01:12:07.029 --> 01:12:09.331
So be careful, don’t get lost

01:12:09.531 --> 01:12:12.340
and understand where you have to go, where you have to meet,

01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:15.740
what is the place and all of you please arrive there

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:19.020
so that there’s no more keeping awake.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:21.900
May God bless you all!

01:12:55.077 --> 01:12:58.380
They have made some nice music. I would like to hear that.

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:46.500
I am telling him to give you, in the evening.

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.340
Tomorrow also, in the evening, simple food.

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.513
And just rice and something.

01:13:51.714 --> 01:13:54.460
And daytime they can give you heavy food.

01:14:10.862 --> 01:14:13.260
Don’t eat anything in the market!

01:15:04.449 --> 01:15:06.540
Who is coughing too much?

01:15:06.949 --> 01:15:08.451
Come here!

01:15:08.652 --> 01:15:10.159
One.

01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:14.300
I think you need it for your Vishuddhi,

01:15:18.267 --> 01:15:21.275
Right Vishuddhi. And see the face is so red!

01:15:21.476 --> 01:15:23.499
That’s the sign of the Right Vishuddhi.

01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:26.597
Alright. In any case I’ll give you to stop it but…

01:15:26.798 --> 01:15:28.291
Now come along here.

01:15:28.492 --> 01:15:30.134
Who are coughing now? Let’s see.

01:15:30.334 --> 01:15:31.740
Who is this lady?

01:15:36.758 --> 01:15:38.310
Come here!

01:16:03.435 --> 01:16:05.020
Can you come up.

01:16:05.518 --> 01:16:07.232
Can you come up.

01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:11.619
All those who are coughing.

01:16:15.986 --> 01:16:18.313
Come along! Can you come up.

01:16:18.514 --> 01:16:20.014
He can’t sit?

01:16:20.375 --> 01:16:21.900
You sit down!

01:16:24.549 --> 01:16:26.100
Ruth.

01:16:32.192 --> 01:16:33.731
Half of them?

01:16:33.932 --> 01:16:35.540
Sit down! Sit here.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.540
Now, I think this will be all exhausted!

01:18:07.051 --> 01:18:09.481
Now, before that, can you put your fingers

01:18:09.681 --> 01:18:11.700
in your ears

01:18:12.841 --> 01:18:14.603
and push back your head

01:18:14.804 --> 01:18:17.504
and say ‘Allah ho Akbar’.

01:18:28.613 --> 01:18:30.113
Say sixteen times.

01:19:19.944 --> 01:19:22.144
Now? Cleared out?

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:27.707
Much better now?

01:19:29.757 --> 01:19:32.040
It’s a simple thing you know.

01:19:32.629 --> 01:19:34.900
If you do it twice or thrice

01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.739
you clear out!

01:19:37.989 --> 01:19:40.020
It’s a very simple thing.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.620
Keep it in the mouth till it swells up then throw it away. It’s hot.

01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:50.860
I’ll send you one kilo tomorrow.

01:19:52.561 --> 01:19:54.100
But you must do it!

01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:57.780
Because you are not meditating
every day this is what is happening.

01:20:00.544 --> 01:20:03.564
Do a complete meditation with ‘Allah ho Akbar’

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:06.020
and with the

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.340
Lord’s prayer, all these things,

01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:11.656
and you will feel much better.

01:20:11.857 --> 01:20:13.500
Much better now?

01:20:15.169 --> 01:20:17.300
As simple as that!

01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:22.340
Gone coughing? Not coming!

01:20:26.941 --> 01:20:29.565
Now it’s moved that side I think!!

01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:38.260
Now better.

01:20:39.555 --> 01:20:42.420
This must be learnt!

01:20:43.340 --> 01:20:45.180
David can you come?

01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.136
Ah. Much better.

01:20:57.337 --> 01:20:59.200
Vibrations flowing?

01:21:00.364 --> 01:21:02.340
Put the hands like this straight.

01:21:05.432 --> 01:21:09.180
Then another thing which is very simple to understand:

01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:11.580
that it’s a,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.428
also a new style of

01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:16.500
shaking the head is too much.

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.653
Like if I say, “Are you all right?”

01:21:18.853 --> 01:21:20.940
“Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:23.298
yes, yes, yes, yes!”.

01:21:24.719 --> 01:21:27.660
“No, no, no, no, no, no.”

01:21:29.586 --> 01:21:31.100
Just say, “Yes, yes.”

01:21:31.300 --> 01:21:33.860
You should say, “Yes please. Yes.”

01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.533
But don’t shake your heads.

01:21:35.733 --> 01:21:38.220
At the slightest thing I see people go on shaking.

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.900
Now if they don’t like something they’ll go on like shrugging.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.300
There’s no need!

01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:48.289
To put so much pressure on your neck is not necessary.

01:21:48.531 --> 01:21:50.820
You have got a mouth.

01:21:51.818 --> 01:21:54.211
And every time if you shake your head

01:21:54.412 --> 01:21:55.963
you are in for trouble,

01:21:56.163 --> 01:21:58.380
straining your neck too much.

01:21:59.136 --> 01:22:02.420
I mean just doing that way I get a headache I tell you.

01:22:02.767 --> 01:22:05.380
But people I have seen that they go on.

01:22:06.565 --> 01:22:08.802
Even when I am talking they are doing like this.

01:22:09.003 --> 01:22:11.100
There’s no need to nod like that.

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.340
I mean I know you like it.

01:23:07.699 --> 01:23:09.380
Alright now? Better?

01:23:13.839 --> 01:23:15.793
Put your right hand

01:23:16.532 --> 01:23:19.172
on the Brahmarandhra,

01:23:19.483 --> 01:23:21.140
just here. Push it,

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:22.892
move it.

01:23:26.056 --> 01:23:27.660
Clockwise.

01:23:29.314 --> 01:23:32.460
Now the whole of this parting

01:23:33.747 --> 01:23:36.980
it can move. All the seven chakras are here.

01:23:37.876 --> 01:23:40.420
You can start it from here if you want.

01:23:42.559 --> 01:23:45.220
Back side you should move the other way round.

01:23:46.929 --> 01:23:49.100
Here also, the other way round.

01:23:50.817 --> 01:23:52.335
Now.

01:23:57.259 --> 01:23:58.944
Especially here,

01:23:59.145 --> 01:24:00.945
Left Nabhi.

01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:07.900
Now, put it on the Brahmarandhra. Move it,

01:24:09.328 --> 01:24:11.928
now, in the clockwise manner.

01:24:13.574 --> 01:24:15.145
Now bring it here,

01:24:19.743 --> 01:24:23.080
Vishuddhi, must move Vishuddhi quite a lot.

01:24:26.296 --> 01:24:28.206
This is the Virata’s thing.

01:24:28.407 --> 01:24:30.104
Now the Agnya.

01:24:35.043 --> 01:24:38.012
Now the Hamsa, just with this finger.

01:24:48.187 --> 01:24:49.687
Better now?

01:24:56.138 --> 01:24:57.727
Relieved?

01:24:58.327 --> 01:24:59.846
Much better.

01:25:00.647 --> 01:25:04.220
Also you can, for your Vishuddhi, you should put your

01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:08.380
right hand here

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.434
and rub it

01:25:10.634 --> 01:25:13.083
the other way round, means anti-clockwise.

01:25:13.283 --> 01:25:15.640
Vishuddhi, move it.

01:25:16.934 --> 01:25:19.403
Move it with your fingers, press it hard

01:25:19.603 --> 01:25:23.353
with the fingers, you can massage yourself I mean to say.

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:29.579
Just do it like that, it will be nice.

01:25:34.989 --> 01:25:36.489
Other way round.

01:25:40.242 --> 01:25:42.638
Better now, you pour it

01:25:43.293 --> 01:25:44.793
Now, much better.

01:25:45.409 --> 01:25:47.804
Not this way but take it this way.

01:25:51.162 --> 01:25:53.580
More on the Left Vishuddhi now.

01:25:55.344 --> 01:25:58.486
With a little oil it will be alright.

01:25:59.096 --> 01:26:00.843
It’s good!

01:26:03.262 --> 01:26:05.542
Feeling better now?

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:07.840
Much better?

01:26:11.566 --> 01:26:13.066
Cleared out.

01:26:13.595 --> 01:26:15.211
Much better now.

01:26:16.664 --> 01:26:18.164
All right.

01:26:19.722 --> 01:26:21.540
So, you can yourself massage.

01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:25.740
For example, if your eyesight is not all right, massage it here.

01:26:27.765 --> 01:26:30.780
You can take the name of Mahaganesha

01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:33.316
and Mahabhairava here,

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:35.395
it will work out.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:41.489
With your fingers please, with your fingers.

01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:44.833
You have to rub it with your fingers, press it hard!

01:26:46.328 --> 01:26:50.280
If it is on the Left Side you can feel it or it is on the Right Side.

01:26:52.117 --> 01:26:53.940
That’s why I said that “Put oil.”

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:56.540
That doesn’t mean putting oil means just straight forward,

01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:00.532
pour it into your head, but rub it with your fingers. Now better?

01:27:02.532 --> 01:27:04.042
Stopped?

01:27:04.243 --> 01:27:06.409
Coughing has stopped now.

01:27:06.885 --> 01:27:10.588
Alright. Better now. See now it’s coming out.

01:27:13.226 --> 01:27:16.826
Good! The heat is coming out a little bit.

01:27:19.488 --> 01:27:23.199
Now put the right hand towards me and left hand.

01:27:27.827 --> 01:27:29.327
Better!

01:27:38.415 --> 01:27:41.662
Try with the left hand again. Left hand and right hand.

01:27:42.046 --> 01:27:44.726
Bend your heads! Bend your head!

01:27:46.039 --> 01:27:48.973
That’s like humbling down! You know?

01:27:52.514 --> 01:27:54.014
Fine?

01:27:54.220 --> 01:27:55.987
Feeling better now?

01:28:01.343 --> 01:28:04.792
Manaa! They are going to sing some song to us!

01:35:21.187 --> 01:35:24.708
So I’ll take your leave now. I think coughing is much less.

01:35:27.028 --> 01:35:30.690
Also do it twice, thrice before sleeping ‘Allah ho Akbar’,

01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:34.140
gargle your throats with a little this thing.

01:36:10.886 --> 01:36:13.366
I’ll take your leave now. May God bless.

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:16.740
This is the medicine that you have to take all of you,

01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:19.380
those who are suffering from diarrhoea.
