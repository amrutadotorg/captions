00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.859
Guru Puja.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:06.930
Cabella Ligure (Italy), 23 July 2000.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:33.370
Today we are here to know about guru principle.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:48.800
What does a guru do.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:04:03.750
Whatever you have, all the precious things
within you, he discovers them for your knowledge.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:12.670
Actually it is all there - everything.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:28.640
All the knowledge, all the spirituality, all
the joy, is there.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:43.220
(little laughter as a dog walks on stage)
Right time! (more laughter).

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:51.240
It's all contained within you.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:05:10.280
Only thing the Guru does (is) makes you knowledgeable
about your knowledge, about your own spirit.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:17.560
Everyone has the Spirit within himself.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.660
Everyone has the spirituality within himself.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.630
There is nothing that you get from outside.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:42.850
But before getting this knowledge, you are
dealing, or you are living in ignorance.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:53.800
In that ignorance you do not know what treasure
you have got within yourself.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:08.270
So the guru's job is to make you know what
you are.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.520
That is the first step.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:25.780
That it starts, that awakening within you
by which you know that you are not this outside

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.070
world, this is all an illusion.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:39.270
And you start getting enlightened within yourself.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:46.110
Some people get full light and some people
get it gradually.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:52.310
Essence of all the religions is that you should
know yourself.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:07:02.640
Those people who are fighting in the name
of religion, you have to go and ask them,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:12.390
you have to enquire from them, "Did your religion
make you know yourself?"

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.770
If all the religions have said one thing [it's
that], you have to do all these things just

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:24.210
to know yourself.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.010
But people get into rituals.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:33.770
They think that [by] doing all these rituals
they are near God.

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:46.540
They live in ignorance absolutely about themselves,
and day in and day out they work out something,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:51.290
which is nothing to do with yourself'.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:08:00.770
Lots of acrobats, prayers, pujas, these things
go on.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.390
Because it is all ignorance.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:14.750
People go on paying them money and they become
very rich and their interest is only money.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:26.470
They want to take all your money, absolutely,
and make a fool out of you.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.780
They pamper your ego.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:41.720
With pampering of that ego you just start
drifting into the ocean of illusion and you

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:50.420
are drowned into that illusion, thinking that
you are very religious and you are just in

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:55.010
connection with God, which you are not.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.950
To know God you should know your Self first.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:04.880
Without knowing that, you cannot know God.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.760
That's essential, that you should know your
Self.

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.300
But when you know yourself, you know partly.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:21.420
The experience is not sufficient.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.110
The knowledge has to come.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:33.220
And the guru gives the knowledge about your
Self.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.230
Now you have to tally it.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.270
You should find out whatever your guru has
told you.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.890
Is it true or not?

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.510
Is it correct or not?

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.670
Or is it just another illusion?

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:59.380
Now in this ascent people get into lots of
problems.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.670
First and foremost is the ego problem, especially
in the west.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:11.930
Ego stands up and you start thinking you are
great, you are better than others, and there

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:15.940
is something special about you.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:28.830
This ignorance is more dangerous than the
worldly ignorance, I think, because in the

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:37.820
worldly ignorance, you do feel the consequences
of wrong things.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:51.210
But when you are half way, when your ignorance
is that about yourself, when you are going

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:59.850
to a higher realm, then one should always
understand that you cannot have ego.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:14.680
Then what starts is introspection.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:23.710
You start looking at yourself, what's wrong
with you.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:29.120
When you understand that you have ego, you
start looking at yourself.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:42.320
Or when you find there is something missing
or something wrong, then also, you start introspecting.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:51.890
This should be a very, very honest, very honest
effort.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:58.230
Some people in Sahaja Yoga, at a very early
stage start thinking they that they are very

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.700
great and they don't need any introspection.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:13.330
And they rise again into the clouds of ignorance
without achieving Selfhood, or I can call

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:17.050
it Self realisation.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:24.420
So you have to introspect and see for yourself
what have you been doing, what are you, how

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:30.040
far you have come.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:36.590
How much -- please don't translate just now
all right?

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:40.770
You can do it later on.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.440
You must hear with full concentration.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:52.630
Even if you don't understand it will work
-- now the style of such a person changes

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.630
gradually.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.630
How?

00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:07.700
First of all a person who is extremely aggressive,
hot-tempered, and full of ego, starts becoming

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.840
very gentle and mild.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:26.430
Another type which is frightened and afraid
and very cautious starts becoming fearless.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:31.170
At that stage you have no fears.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:42.380
You are sure that you are on the right path
and you are moving on the right lines.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.400
You are not easily disturbed there.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:56.010
But still you have to rise higher and higher;
where, when you meditate, you understand there

00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:01.130
is something wrong within yourself.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:06.950
You have achieved your Self realisation; you
have got the blessings of Self realisation.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:15.890
Your health is good, you have got all kinds
of blessings which you cannot count.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:27.740
All that is there but...still you have to
go further.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:42.450
And that is to understand all the knowledge
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:49.810
You have to understand through your mental
capacity, first, to begin with, then you have

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:56.340
to verify how far it is correct.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:10.820
How far you have understood it, how far you
have worked on it, how far you know.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:26.870
And when you start seeing yourself, you start
entering into the realm of Bhakti.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:35.870
You become a mild person, become a sweet person,
you don't talk too much, you don't harass

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:47.670
anyone; you are a very pleasant person, very
gentle, very understanding.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:58.810
This person has to verify how he is behaving
towards others.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:13.020
Now the attention starts moving from oneself
to another and you start seeing how you behave.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.570
How you love.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.800
What is the quality of your compassion?

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:38.190
When you love somebody without any expectations,
just love, then you are absolutely dedicated

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:46.760
to that person, absolutely; you just obey.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.560
You will do anything for that person.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:57.090
If there is this love which you call as surrender.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.800
This is just the love.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:09.670
Surrender is nothing but the love, and that
love which is extremely joy-giving.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:25.590
this bhakti starts, this dedication starts,
and you are cleansed by that bhakti.

00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:38.150
All the bad qualities you have, you can call
them, all the deficiencies you have, all the

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:48.140
problems you have, you understand and you
get over it.

00:17:48.140 --> 00:18:01.940
Now if you see somebody with the same qualities,
with the same troubles, you in the love of

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:07.900
that person you try to tolerate.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:15.180
Such a person just tolerates.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:31.950
There is no aggression, and these people forgive.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.900
Realised Souls go on forgiving; their capacity
to forgive is tremendous.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:44.090
They do not bear any malice against anyone.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.900
They don't have any anger about anyone.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:54.580
They just go on tolerating and forgiving and
forgiving.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:06.240
This forgiveness is just a music, I should
say, of your bhakti.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:12.710
The amount of forgiveness these masters could
have can be seen from [the] life of Christ.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:20.260
They are tortured, crucified - most of the
saints were tortured.

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.080
People never liked them.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:36.870
And they were crucified, but as you know that
they never resented, they never take a revenge,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:42.640
they never did anything which was not compassionate.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:55.260
They had compassion, and compassion for such
people they felt that 'Oh God, please forgive

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.260
them.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:02.490
What they are doing they don't know'.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:04.830
Extremely compassionate.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.990
And they are that, that becomes their nature.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:19.440
When it becomes their nature they become people
with complete peace.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.090
They are not disturbed.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:33.630
They are never disturbed with whatever is
happening and they think it's God's will.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:41.300
Because nothing can disturb them, nothing
can upset them.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:49.240
They just enjoy their devotion.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:54.840
Devotion to their guru, maybe.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.840
Devotion to God.

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:10.700
In that devotion they may write beautiful
poetry, they may go on dancing, they may go

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:19.450
on singing, because the peace is within and
they are enjoying themselves.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:31.660
When they are alone, they are never alone,
they enjoy themselves.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:46.090
They know that - "We are one with the Divine"
- and the blessing of the Divine they enjoy.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:51.640
Another thing is they never take to artificiality.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:22:01.630
They are never worried, never upset, they
are neither futuristic nor think of the past,

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:04.350
but they are in the present.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:13.550
When they are in the present, they are absolutely
silent.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:26.280
If there is any problem, or anything happens
to them, they immediately go into thoughtless

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.650
awareness.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.630
That is what their capacity is.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:40.080
To become a guru you have to develop that
personality; not to be bound by anything.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.850
Now I'll tell you my own example.

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:51.740
I never hurry, I'm never bothered about time.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:59.430
Once I was going to America - because if you
are sure the Divine has plans for you, you

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:06.970
are not bothered, the Divine is looking after
you so why to bother -- I was going to America

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.160
and one child fell down.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:16.140
I was just about to get up and go and broke
her arm.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.590
And when I saw the child I said "All right,
I'll put that child right".

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.020
"But," they said, "You are going to America!"

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.750
I said, "I'll go in any case!

00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:32.160
". So I cured the child, it took about half
an hour, and then I came out "All right, let's

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.450
go to the airport".

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:38.260
They said "Mother you are very late" I said,
"I'm never late.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.020
Let's go!".

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:49.480
We went there, to the airport, and the plane
by which I was going was out of order, so

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.610
there was another plane going to Washington
not to New York, and I wanted to go to Washington

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:57.440
only!

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:09.450
So just imagine how things work out, and we
call them 'Sahaja'.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:18.120
It has worked out 'Sahaja'.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.260
That means it's a effortless.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:40.300
But first of all your personality should be
such that your devotion is so great that Divine

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:52.460
is compelled to look after you...compelled
to look after you!

00:24:52.460 --> 00:25:03.970
You have to understand that Divine force is
around you, and this Divine force is absolute

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:09.090
guarantee for your safety.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:13.860
For everything that you want to do.

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:20.710
You can say that "Mother you are very powerful".

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:21.710
You can become also very powerful!

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:33.920
If you get completely dedicated to the Divine
work, you will also have all the powers and

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:44.280
the Divine will provide all the necessary
work that you want to do, necessary time that

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.930
you have to have.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:51.950
Everything is provided by the Divine.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:26:05.220
But the compassion, when it extends from other
people to God, or to Divine person, or to

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:18.410
your guru, then it becomes very easy to live,
very simple to live, no complications, everything

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:24.400
is sorted out, and you are not bothered about
anything.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:32.390
You just close your eyes and things work out.

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:41.230
Everything works out as if that's your will,
but you don't have to will it, don't have

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:46.530
to think about it, it just works out, but
Divine looks after everything.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:55.670
It looks after your comfort, looks after your
health, everything.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:09.520
And this Divine help, you do not seek, you
do not ask for, but you are a personality

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.660
for which the Divine is responsible.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:20.530
You are a special responsibility of the Divine.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:27.000
And it knows what is good for you and what
is not.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.520
It's an example, I can give many where I,
supposing, I thought somebody is coming to

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:43.940
meet me, and people told me "Mother, he's
very negative", He will never come, he'll

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.300
never come.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:51.650
All positive things will happen, and if a
negative things take place, then you will

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.560
use your compassion.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:28:00.330
If it is negative you'll use your compassion
and you'll solve the problem.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:10.460
You can solve the problems of your own, of
your surroundings, of your community.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.520
So now you have got your Self realisation.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.060
How far you have gone in that I don't know.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:26.860
I have a complaint about women, so many ladies,
that they don't meditate.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:33.610
That they are not looking after themselves,
they are not realised souls, and that's why

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:43.160
many men want to divorce them because they
think these women are good for nothing.

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:49.740
And some men also are like that.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:59.580
To solve this problem you have to have compassion,
and you have to, somehow or other, with compassion,

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:07.350
you should win over the partner of your life.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.870
After all men are much more busy than women
are.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:16.920
But women indulge into so many other things.

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:24.390
They have to look after their family, their
children, their everything.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:33.170
And their mind is involved into all such mundane
things that they have no time to meditate.

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:37.300
Without meditation you cannot rise.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.440
You have to meditate.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.410
People think that: "Now we have got realisation,
so it's all right".

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:45.410
No!

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:50.930
Every day you must meditate because that's
the cleansing that takes place.

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:56.340
With the cleansing you understand.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:05.900
You understand what is needed and what is
not needed, you are cleansed out.

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.380
That is done by Divine.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:16.140
But you must religiously meditate.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:25.690
Gradually you will find your meditation will
become very deep.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:36.910
You will become very, very deep and your powers
will start showing.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:43.430
When you are anywhere, negativity will run
away.

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:51.080
All sorts of problems can be solved.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.750
Whatever you want to do is available to you.

00:30:55.750 --> 00:31:04.590
Whatever is your desire to help others or
give to someone, you just get it.

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:09.700
Is my own experience I'm telling you.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:20.160
You have to meditate at least 10 minutes every
evening, and morning about 5 minutes.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:25.410
With complete devotion, with complete admiration.

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:36.200
I have seen some people here, such bhakti,
such devotion, which is shraddha - is higher

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:42.100
than bhakti - that it becomes part and parcel
of your being.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:47.230
It just envelops you completely.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:53.910
When you have that shraddha, it is very miraculous.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.510
It works so many miracles.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:05.460
It's true some people were cured only thinking
of me, is a fact.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:12.190
But that doesn't mean that they had the shraddha
of that level, but that means that they have

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:15.090
to develop shraddha.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:24.760
Now how to develop a shraddha, which is a
natural light of the Spirit.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:36.680
Because people are trying very hard to develop
shraddha, but shraddha cannot be developed

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:44.230
by mental activity, by any activity, but meditation
of silence.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:51.210
If you do the meditation .... I have always
told you to do meditation.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:57.200
I immediately know a person who has been meditating
and who has not been.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:05.430
They'll come to my puja, all right; and they'll
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they'll go out and

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.350
do it for popularity.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.120
Many people are like that.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.790
They go out, and for popularity they work
it out.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:23.080
But inside they have not yet traced their
own Self.

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:30.880
So at this development stage you should be
encouraged, and [should be] understood that

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:40.050
you can reach that state very easily through
meditation and introspection.

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:51.040
With introspection you will develop a new
quality of understanding that, you will find

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.010
solutions to things.

00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:59.980
That is another quality a person who is a
realised soul has.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:08.550
It can find solutions to all your problems.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:19.010
It can, he can suggest what is the way you
can be helped.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.290
Then a kind of a brotherhood out of the shraddha
develops.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:30.100
You may be giving big lectures on Sahaja Yoga,
you may be doing all kinds of things, but

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:37.880
unless and until you have shraddha, you cannot
rise.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:47.170
And this shraddha is a kind of a love within
you, I should say, which spreads like gentle

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:59.600
fire which doesn't burn, which doesn't give
heat, but cold, beautiful breeze-like feeling

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:03.290
within, which makes you understand.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:11.470
You will never talk ill about a sahaja yogi,
never.

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:16.820
I never listen to anybody who tells me something
against sahaja yogi.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:25.890
Up to a point, when it is a collective complaint,
then I am little bit bothered and I talk about

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.660
it to the leader.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:34.630
But otherwise if one person comes and tells
me this and this, I just tell that person

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:39.600
"You introspect yourself , it's not so".

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:51.560
Finding faults with others is a common game
all human beings play.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.820
They never see their own faults.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:58.780
What's the use of finding faults of others?

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:04.690
By finding faults with others you're not going
to be helped.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:11.740
Try to find faults within you, which you can
cure, which you can help, which you can work

00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.690
it out.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:24.080
It's a responsibility you have, you must know,
to yourself that you better find out your

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.910
defects and get them corrected.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:37.200
But some people are very proud of their fondness
-- they talk like this, "I like this, I like

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.200
that".

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.690
But what about the Spirit?

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.890
You like this, you like that, then what about
your Spirit?

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:48.680
Does it like?

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:53.690
Does it enjoy?

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:57.850
They'll go on saying "I like this, I don't
like this, I don't like that!"

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:02.380
It's very common in the West.

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.610
Now see, some ladies have made this beautiful
carpets for me.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:14.680
They are so thick that when I walk on them
I little bit lose balance, but the love with

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:26.560
which they are made, makes me so joyous, so
happy, that you can't imagine what I feel

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.830
about them.

00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:34.290
This joy, this ocean of joy, is within you.

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:45.150
And when it starts stirring up, it doesn't
torment you, it gives you beautiful -- I don't

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:55.320
know how to use words to express that -- it's
like a drizzle on your being, it's like a

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.950
grace on your being.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.310
The love of other people enthrals you.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:15.160
You don't ask for it, but if you see a person
who is very loving and kind, there is real

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.400
friendship in that kind of relationship.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:25.370
But talking ill about sahaja yogis, it's very
wrong.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:34.390
And then talking to everyone that "this is
wrong with this person, he had done this,

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:41.120
he had done that", is very, very wrong and
creating a collective feeling against the

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.370
person -- instead of helping that person.

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:48.540
Always people are in trouble.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:52.010
Then collectively you must help that person.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.230
Not talk ill of that person.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:39:02.460
May be some mistakes, but if you start talking
against that person and saying that 'This

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:09.580
is wrong with him, that is wrong with him',
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:20.140
You are a sahaja yogi as long as you can see
your own defects through introspection.

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:25.760
Now many of you, I should say most of you,
have got your realisation.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.800
You had the experience.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:35.020
But some of you don't have the knowledge.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:42.490
That knowledge you should acquire, and verify
whether that knowledge is really there or

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:43.620
not.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:58.280
Like in America, in the N.I.H., which is an
Institute for Health, they wanted to test

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.660
a sahaja yogi, and there were doctors.

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:08.160
And one doctor came forward and said "All
right, tell me on your vibration what's wrong

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.160
with me".

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:17.920
So the girl said, "Sir, something wrong with
your heart" and he said, "It's correct" because

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:28.860
he has had a bypass only one month back and
he was out of hospital.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.380
Absolutely correct, and this surprised them.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:36.850
That diagnosis, you see, kills the patient
half way.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:44.650
So this is the very easy way to diagnose a
person, just by feeling the vibration.

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:58.470
And they have given us such a good attention,
they want to develop Sahaja Yoga in their

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.090
hospitals.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:10.570
So you should also testify yourself, examine
yourself and find out about yourself, what

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:12.560
are you?

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:24.560
Say husband and wife -- now the wife meditates,
she knows everything, she knows about her

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:45.500
husband, what's wrong with him and she doesn't
tell him.

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:54.710
She tolerates, she doesn't complain, she doesn't
ask for anything, she just tolerates.

00:41:54.710 --> 00:42:04.830
And this tolerance convinces the husband that
she's a higher personality than himself.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:13.910
He may be anything, but he then understands
that this is what she has achieved, a great

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:14.910
personality.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:21.510
We have so many imperfections, especially
morally, in the West, people are really, I

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:24.070
tell you, like one snake has bitten them.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:35.510
The things that people do here never come
into the minds of people who are not developed.

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:42.060
So development has meant all kinds of abandonment,
all kinds of vagabond temperament, and they

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:54.730
think they are very free and they can go about
and enjoy.

00:42:54.730 --> 00:43:03.670
This style is very common, but you just judge
yourself.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:06.340
Are you one of these type?

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:12.990
Or are you one of the people who are higher
than you in their ascent.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:16.300
It's a process, I must confess.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:22.530
It is not just [that] you get to that point.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:31.250
Sometimes even very new sahaja yogis are better
than very old sahaja yogis, but because they

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:35.260
had a very strong desire.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.790
What are we seeking?

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:44.340
We should understand why we were seeking -- because
we wanted to know ourselves.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:50.800
Somehow, we knew that we have to know ourselves,
and we did not know.

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.300
So we seek.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.670
We seek.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:59.330
We do all kinds of things, I mean all wrong
things also in the name of seeking.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:08.230
But it is this seeking brings you to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:14.820
Then you have to get your Self realisation,
which is very easy through Kundalini.

00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:19.850
Kundalini works out most of the things, most
of the things.

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:27.540
Like somebody told me that overnight she gave
up drinking and smoking -- overnight.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:34.290
I mean I don't tell that, I never say that.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:40.860
But just overnight she gave up, and she said
"I was very particular about my hair dress

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:46.810
and I used to make my hair dress in a different
manner, going to the hairdressers, spending

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:50.040
so much time with the beautician, this, that".

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.090
She said, "I gave it up".

00:44:53.090 --> 00:45:01.540
Also she said "I used to wear dresses which
were not very moral, then I started respecting

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:05.530
my body and I started wearing proper dress".

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:16.050
All this knowledge comes to you, spontaneously
it is within you, because it is all your own.

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:20.480
Also if your guru tells you, you are guided.

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.260
Guru's job is to guide people.

00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:27.850
So at this juncture, what is lacking?

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:32.990
What is lacking in Sahaja Yoga?

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:34.810
That I have to tell you.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:41.770
There are so many collective disasters we
have - all kinds of.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:51.080
We had many earthquakes, we had many floods,
rain, then the muds - mud came down like a

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:58.680
river; and so many disasters in the world
and sahaja yogis are saved from that.

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:07.140
All the sahaja yogis are saved from that,
no doubt, but after being saved, what is your

00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.610
understanding?

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:11.060
What do you know?

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:15.030
Why these disasters are coming?

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:19.590
Because Sahaja Yoga is not very collective.

00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:22.240
It has to become very collective.

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.530
It has to spread much more, all over.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:30.020
It has to go to many people, which we don't
do.

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:35.280
We are at a standstill, or little bit we do
it.

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.970
But go all out!

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:40.340
Look at Christ's twelve disciples!

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:45.130
Of course the people went into wrong things.

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:52.820
But how they worked and how intensively they
did it.

00:46:52.820 --> 00:47:01.700
That intensity if you don't have, and if you
do not completely dedicate to the spreading

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:10.050
of Sahaja Yoga, then collective problems cannot
be solved.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:17.560
You are busy with your daily mundane things,
and your other jobs and everything; it's all

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.320
right, in Sahaja Yoga no objection.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:32.680
But you should have your attention more on
to this side of life that - 'What are we doing

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.410
for the collective?

00:47:34.410 --> 00:47:36.170
Are we talking about it?

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:38.510
Are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:42.340
Are we making people know about it?'

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:53.290
I was surprised, once I was coming by plane
and a lady sat next to me and had very bad

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.350
vibrations.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:48:07.980
I put myself into bandhan, and I asked her
what is she doing for her spirituality, and

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.090
she gave the name of 'Bahai' people.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:14.150
"My God" I said.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:19.640
If these people spread out, they are so spread
out, they are so many!

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.840
So, what will happen?

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:23.840
Disasters!

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:31.880
They are such negative people, impossible
that they can do any good to the world.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:41.370
And like that you see, anybody, false guru,
how people are driven to them, how they take

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:43.960
to them, and how they spread their message.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:52.840
I have seen people singing on the road, singing
the praise of their guru, and also wearing

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:58.310
funny dresses -- we don't want that kind of
a thing.

00:48:58.310 --> 00:49:04.960
But of course you have got the knowledge,
of course you are realised souls.

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.220
But what have you done for Sahaja Yoga is
the point.

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.340
You have to spread Sahaja Yoga...everywhere.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:24.930
For example, you wear a badge, then they will
ask you "What is this supposed to be?"

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:29.700
Then you have to tell them what is it, something.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.580
You start talking about Sahaja Yoga only!

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:35.570
Talk nothing else but Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:35.570 --> 00:49:41.730
You have to go on talking about Sahaja Yoga,
spreading Sahaja Yoga: unless and until you

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:47.510
do it, it won't become collective, and all
the disasters, which are due to collective

00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:52.100
nonsense, you get it.

00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:57.210
You are saved from so many things.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:02.550
Say even if there's pollution, for a sahaja
yogi it won't matter.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:09.930
Even if there is a disaster of an earthquake
the sahaja yogi will be saved.

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:13.910
But why not save the whole world?

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:20.740
Calamities after calamities are coming, and
if you have compassion you must think of the

00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:27.180
people who can get into any calamity or into
any trouble.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:31.620
Of course I can cure many people, no doubt.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:36.080
But I don't know how to make Sahaja Yoga very
collective.

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:44.930
Now you are so many people here, you all can
start giving realisation to at least 100 people.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:46.750
Go everywhere.

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:50.370
Talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:58.050
Sing the praise of the Divine, and you will
save the whole world.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:07.150
It is not by saving some few people you can
have the great Satya Yuga, but you have also

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:09.730
to save this Mother Earth.

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.300
You have to save the people who are in it.

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:19.240
I mean, the way these people are, I have seen
so many of them on the television.

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:24.630
They, shamelessly they are talking about something
which they don't know.

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:28.420
And they have thousands and thousands of people
behind them.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:32.040
Not that the people are stupid.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:41.360
Not that they want to go on a wrong path,
but these people who are false, or who are

00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:48.250
wrong, know how to entice them, how to capture
them, how to talk to them.

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:55.530
But a sahaja yogi, you see, if he sees somebody
with a negative vibrations will run away.

00:51:55.530 --> 00:52:02.830
He will escape such a society, will not go
near them, and will say "Oh, very bad vibrations,

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:06.680
we don't want!".

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:15.170
So you have to be courageous and get into
these places, talk to people and make it collective.

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:19.650
Otherwise you cannot save this world from
the wrath of God.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:21.630
God is wrathful, no doubt.

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:26.840
For you, he'll save you, but what's the use?

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.230
We have to save this Mother Earth.

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:38.560
And for that you have to be prepared, you
have to work it out, and whenever you get

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:42.040
a chance you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:46.220
Some people told me "Mother, if you come then
it will be All right" Why?

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:51.760
What's so much? .... you can be also like
me.

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.730
You can talk about it to people.

00:52:54.730 --> 00:53:02.120
I started Sahaja Yoga with one person and,
that time, it was complete darkness everywhere.

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:08.660
No seekers, nothing, and horrible people,
but it worked and it cleared.

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:15.230
So one person can get so many sahaja yogis,
why not you people do the same and talk about

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:16.230
it.

00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:25.130
Your behaviour, your style, everything will
definitely impress them.

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:34.370
One has to work it out in such a manner that
you achieve our goal of collective consciousness.

00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:39.520
It is not only for sahaja yogis, it's for
everyone.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:45.540
So that all these calamities that are happening,
horrible things that are happening, will stop.

00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:48.390
Completely stop, I assure you, it can be stopped.

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:52.680
Because you are always saved.

00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.310
So all people who will be getting realisation
will be saved.

00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:03.320
Why not talk openly about it telling people
that if we do wrong, if we are immoral, if

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:16.460
we are cheats, if we try to oppress others
and we become so much a power of destruction

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:29.160
then this collective disasters will be there
and I think we'll be responsible for that.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.910
Everything you take up, any subject you take
up, you don't have to start an organisation

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:35.560
to fight it.

00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:42.080
But only your power of convincing people and
bringing them to Sahaja Yoga will make such

00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.080
a difference.

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:47.720
I hope you will understand as a guru what
you have to do.

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:57.430
As a guru there are so many things and as
your character, yesterday, as they showed

00:54:57.430 --> 00:55:09.580
how Lao Tse has written about the masters,
how they were above all of it, above turmoil,

00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:13.580
above jealousies, above talking loose.

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:20.620
They are so great, they are the masters and
they will be the masters and you will be the

00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:23.370
gurus if you try to do that.

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:26.630
This is what you have to achieve.

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:33.090
I know some have achieved it, but most of
you have to achieve, with compassion and love.

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:34.670
May God Bless You All
