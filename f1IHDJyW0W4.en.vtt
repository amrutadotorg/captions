Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure, July16th 1995

00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:22.869
It is a very important Guru Puja today

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:32.350
because we have completed twenty-five
years of Guru Puja.

00:00:37.874 --> 00:00:41.605
(Hindi: "Please put the fan in the rotating
manner".)

00:01:05.922 --> 00:01:14.589
Also, it is extremely beautiful

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:27.217
to see so many Sahaja Yogis who are,
really have become, very great.

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:38.011
It’s a question of understanding what
Sahaja Yoga is.

00:01:38.212 --> 00:01:43.034
It's a very unique discovery, I feel now,

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:53.037
that people who were seeking the Truth
have found it

00:01:53.238 --> 00:02:03.787
and have now got it absolutely on their
central nervous system.

00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:09.012
Yes, in some places it’s difficult to
explain

00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:12.600
how it has happened, how it has worked out

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:17.400
and how, in these twenty-five years, we
have been able

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:24.055
to achieve this expansion of Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:35.788
The main thing, I feel, is that you all
should know

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.554
that as the tree grows, the roots have
to grow much deeper

00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:47.860
and they should spread also. If it doesn't
happen,

00:02:48.061 --> 00:02:53.839
the tree cannot be sustained only by Mother
Earth.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.681
So the roots are in your own life, in your
own heart.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.100
When we say we have become our own Guru,

00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:15.211
we should really try to find out with our
introspection:

00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:20.061
Are we our Guru or not?

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.380
Because, before this your mind was on one
side

00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:37.426
and your heart was on another side

00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:43.172
and your attention was in another
dimension.

00:03:43.373 --> 00:03:49.932
So these three things were creating
confusion within you.

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:05.346
If you understand a human being, then you
will be surprised to see

00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:14.005
how these three things act separately in a
human being. And sometimes they fight also.

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:18.354
First is your intellect and your mind.

00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:25.346
Second is your heart, your feelings, your
emotions.

00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:41.755
And the third one is your attention.

00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:49.432
In these modern times, this confusion is
the worst

00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:53.981
because all the time your attention is
outside.

00:04:54.182 --> 00:05:01.022
It could be towards beautiful things, or
beautiful women, or beautiful men or

00:05:01.223 --> 00:05:07.651
all kinds of nonsensical way of wasting
your energy.

00:05:07.852 --> 00:05:13.913
Such attention then is absolutely like
a horse which is let loose.

00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:17.176
You cannot control such an attention.

00:05:17.377 --> 00:05:25.264
And this attention runs wild from one
to another.

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.331
It’s a fashion also. It’s sort of a very
popular thing

00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:33.793
to keep the attention moving all the time.

00:05:33.994 --> 00:05:39.836
But this attention that has to be towards
the Divine,

00:05:40.037 --> 00:05:48.346
towards the Almighty, is just being
frittered away.

00:05:48.547 --> 00:05:55.338
Thus, attention doesn’t grow its own roots.

00:05:57.012 --> 00:06:02.500
First is to find out about yourself: where
does your attention go?

00:06:02.701 --> 00:06:15.425
What makes you feel like looking after or
concerned for attention?

00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:20.429
You see, the attention comes from various
problems,

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:30.997
and could be your upbringing where you are
not controlled,

00:06:35.224 --> 00:06:45.216
could be your education, could be your
atmosphere in which you live

00:06:45.417 --> 00:06:51.189
or could be your own ego or your
conditioning.

00:06:53.311 --> 00:06:57.828
(Hindi: "The water is maybe a bit too cold,
that's why.

00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:12.367
What is it, tea? Is it hot?

00:07:13.382 --> 00:07:17.386
Pour it here, I'll drink it.

00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:29.739
That's fine".)

00:07:33.605 --> 00:07:41.646
So, this attention is being attacked

00:07:42.177 --> 00:07:53.795
by all these outside energies or negative
forces

00:07:54.125 --> 00:08:01.374
and it gets entangled - like a river
flowing

00:08:01.575 --> 00:08:10.746
straight into the ocean can get lost
in a barren place.

00:08:10.947 --> 00:08:20.650
In the same way this attention, which has
to go towards the Divine,

00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:24.949
gets frittered away and is vanished...

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:31.473
This weak attention cannot take you towards
the Divine.

00:08:31.674 --> 00:08:38.413
Ultimately you find that all this attention
is being completely

00:08:39.107 --> 00:08:46.147
absorbed or frittered away by the nonsense
that’s going on.

00:08:46.348 --> 00:08:51.811
Unfortunately or fortunately, you are born
in these modern times,

00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:57.163
and in these modern times, as you know,
it's a very chaotic condition.

00:08:57.364 --> 00:09:02.364
In these chaotic conditions, you don’t know
what is right and what is wrong.

00:09:02.565 --> 00:09:07.942
And there are all kinds of attractions,

00:09:08.143 --> 00:09:17.058
which can take away your attention and
reduce the energy of your attention.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:25.732
It is possible more for the people who are
very right-sided.

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:29.691
Also the left-sided people can be very much
affected.

00:09:29.892 --> 00:09:35.499
Right-sided people, as you know, go up to
a point and become extremely dry,

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:43.100
self-opinionated and aggressive. All their
attention is in aggression,

00:09:43.301 --> 00:09:49.388
while the people who are on the left side
are indulging too much

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:56.987
into their own whims and their desires and
their own temptations.

00:09:57.188 --> 00:10:01.336
Both sides can fritter away your attention

00:10:01.537 --> 00:10:08.304
which is the most important thing. It is
the most valuable thing is your attention.

00:10:08.505 --> 00:10:13.133
But the attention cannot be controlled by
a person

00:10:13.334 --> 00:10:21.045
who doesn't have a weak mind or a weak
heart.

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:26.021
Now supposing you take somebody who is
a very intelligent person.

00:10:26.222 --> 00:10:30.262
The intelligent person puts all his
attention

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:34.569
in capturing the attention of others.

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:39.447
I don't know why, but it’s a kind of
a paradox.

00:10:39.648 --> 00:10:49.596
The person who himself is having such a lot
of aggressiveness and all that,

00:10:49.797 --> 00:10:53.966
tries to be very sweet, tries to be very
nice with people

00:10:54.167 --> 00:11:02.701
just to keep good relations or, we can say,
the good behavior

00:11:02.902 --> 00:11:07.999
towards people so that they pay attention
to that person.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.149
This is a very subtle thing. They are not
even aware about it,

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:20.287
that we do such a thing just to make others
pay attention to us.

00:11:20.488 --> 00:11:24.091
That is how we have seen that in these
modern times

00:11:24.292 --> 00:11:29.980
so many stupid things people do just
to attract the attention of others.

00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:38.961
Most of the fads that had come up in modern
times

00:11:39.162 --> 00:11:47.297
are just to make something stupid so that
people should pay attention to them.

00:11:49.348 --> 00:11:54.482
Of course, the Sahaja Yogis are not like
that. But I am just pointing it out

00:11:54.683 --> 00:11:57.762
how, in the modern times, you have to be
very careful

00:11:57.963 --> 00:12:04.474
that you should not try to attract
the attention of others.

00:12:04.675 --> 00:12:09.857
Instead of that, what you have to do is
to pay attention to others

00:12:10.058 --> 00:12:14.378
in a very subtle way, not with any
expectation

00:12:14.579 --> 00:12:16.525
that if you are paying attention to
somebody,

00:12:16.726 --> 00:12:21.925
that person should pay attention to you.
It’s a very big struggle,

00:12:22.126 --> 00:12:30.244
I’ve seen, in Sahaja Yoga also, that people
try to, say, become very popular

00:12:30.445 --> 00:12:38.507
or become very outstanding, or something
of a very great qualities,

00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:43.235
to show off that they are something better
than others.

00:12:43.436 --> 00:12:48.912
A person who is really in connection with
the Divine, is least bothered

00:12:49.113 --> 00:12:54.098
about how people pay attention to that
person,

00:12:54.299 --> 00:13:00.874
but automatically the attention of such
a person is on others,

00:13:01.075 --> 00:13:04.289
which is very, very subtle, very subtle.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.522
You cannot make out that the attention
of such a person

00:13:08.723 --> 00:13:14.721
is on you, but it works and it works
beautifully.

00:13:14.922 --> 00:13:20.323
We have to understand that we have now come
to the realm of the Divinity.

00:13:20.524 --> 00:13:25.420
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are
divine people.

00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:29.939
We are very powerful people, but if we
fritter away

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.899
our attention, we become very, very weak
people.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:39.896
It's easy to feel that, “we are Sahaja
Yogis”, “we have done

00:13:40.084 --> 00:13:46.173
so much of realisation of others” or
“we have helped so many people.”

00:13:46.374 --> 00:13:50.233
All this consciousness if it comes within
you, then know

00:13:50.434 --> 00:13:54.563
that you are still not fully developed
Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:54.764 --> 00:14:00.660
There should be no consciousness of what
you are doing or what you are committing.

00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:08.932
There is no need to boast about it. There
is no need to advertise it.

00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:13.450
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen
by everyone.

00:14:13.651 --> 00:14:17.398
But even that desire is not needed

00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:23.613
because you are doing just for
the satisfaction of your Spirit.

00:14:24.704 --> 00:14:28.560
So then, when we come to our heart:

00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:32.296
in the heart resides the Spirit, as you
know very well.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:40.208
Now, when it is the heart, which has
to work over your brain and which can work,

00:14:40.409 --> 00:14:45.068
what becomes of you is nothing, but you
become a source

00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:48.626
of love and compassion. A source, I am
saying.

00:14:48.827 --> 00:14:54.496
You do not assert on others. You do not say
that, “I’ve done so much for you

00:14:54.697 --> 00:15:03.860
and what are you doing to me? What is this
that I should have so much expressed,

00:15:04.061 --> 00:15:06.848
in so many ways, and here you are,

00:15:07.049 --> 00:15:11.425
you are forgetting me and not doing
anything for me?”

00:15:11.626 --> 00:15:17.131
So the expectation of reward if it is
there,

00:15:17.332 --> 00:15:21.583
then you must know is your mind which is
giving you these ideas

00:15:21.784 --> 00:15:28.373
and is working it out that way that you
just now put attention

00:15:28.574 --> 00:15:32.306
to the amount of love the other person
has given you

00:15:32.507 --> 00:15:39.907
for whatever you have given to another
person. It's very subtle.

00:15:42.356 --> 00:15:49.071
So in Sahaja Yoga, you should see now
yourself as just a source of love,

00:15:49.272 --> 00:15:53.212
which is just flowing.

00:15:53.413 --> 00:15:58.767
In that, you do not say that you have
to have this or that,

00:15:58.968 --> 00:16:06.358
or you have to achieve this goal, or you
have to become that. It's finished now.

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:13.434
Once you have become the source, then how
can you become something?

00:16:13.635 --> 00:16:19.653
The thing is, those who are receiving from
the source want to have

00:16:19.854 --> 00:16:31.614
some sort of a reward or some sort of
a recognition.

00:16:31.815 --> 00:16:38.025
In this subtle way if you move, your mind
is very clever.

00:16:38.226 --> 00:16:43.152
In Sahaja Yoga, we have very clever,
intelligent people.

00:16:43.353 --> 00:16:50.978
But this mind... You have to be very
careful because this mind can cheat you.

00:16:52.894 --> 00:16:57.591
So ask your mind, "Why are you in Sahaja
Yoga?

00:16:57.792 --> 00:17:02.357
What is the purpose of your Sahaja Yoga?"

00:17:03.682 --> 00:17:11.961
Gradually this mind will shut up. And then,
you have to ask yourself that,

00:17:12.162 --> 00:17:20.486
"What is my own desire now? What do I want?

00:17:20.687 --> 00:17:27.290
What do I want to achieve? Why I am
in Sahaja Yoga?"

00:17:28.036 --> 00:17:32.215
If you ask this question, you will see
you’ll just dissolve,

00:17:32.416 --> 00:17:37.697
you'll become thoughtless because there is
no desire left now.

00:17:37.898 --> 00:17:41.585
There is no ambition left, no competition.

00:17:41.786 --> 00:17:47.033
All these qualities are of the brain, or we
can say, of the intellect,

00:17:47.234 --> 00:17:52.643
which makes you competitive, which makes
you also jealous.

00:17:52.844 --> 00:17:56.894
So jealousy is also a product of this
competitiveness

00:17:57.095 --> 00:18:01.673
because when two persons are competing
or many are competing

00:18:01.874 --> 00:18:05.881
and one is selected, others become jealous.

00:18:06.082 --> 00:18:11.884
I mean, instead of feeling happy, "All
right. So, one of us has become something,

00:18:12.085 --> 00:18:14.342
so we should be very happy that he has
become."

00:18:14.543 --> 00:18:19.953
On the contrary, the other people feel
jealous, "Why has he become?

00:18:20.154 --> 00:18:24.350
Who is he? What does he think of himself?"
Then they go further.

00:18:24.551 --> 00:18:29.204
Not you people, but on the whole, people
go further with it

00:18:29.405 --> 00:18:34.778
and what do they do is to harm another
person.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:40.927
In Sahaja Yoga, people are also sometimes
very worried and frightened.

00:18:41.128 --> 00:18:43.989
There is no need to be worried or
frightened

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:51.328
because now you have become a Sahaja
Yogi and a Guru. Nobody can touch you.

00:18:51.529 --> 00:18:57.578
Anybody who tries to touch you will be
subsided, somehow or other.

00:18:57.779 --> 00:19:03.859
Of course, I don't do anything as such.
But today only I heard that in Turkey

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:10.520
there were two newspapers who were after
Sahaja Yoga, writing all nonsensical things.

00:19:10.721 --> 00:19:17.649
So, the first one met with an accident and
died. I didn't do that.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:23.075
The second one had two people, editor
and sub-editor,

00:19:23.276 --> 00:19:28.982
were killed and somebody cut their throats.
Of course, I didn't do that.

00:19:29.183 --> 00:19:31.915
Some fundamentalist must have done, or
somebody must have done.

00:19:32.116 --> 00:19:37.189
Now, we don't have to worry as to who
criticizes you, they say it about you

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.164
because you must know they are blind
people.

00:19:40.365 --> 00:19:46.310
They are absolutely blind, they are not
matured as far as the wisdom is concerned.

00:19:46.511 --> 00:19:50.326
For them to understand Sahaja Yoga is not
possible.

00:19:50.527 --> 00:19:53.884
They go up to a point and then they stop.
They cannot go further

00:19:54.085 --> 00:19:57.124
because this dissolution of your being,

00:19:57.325 --> 00:20:03.506
as I said, “the drop becomes the ocean”.

00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:08.859
It's difficult, specially in the West,
where there are so many ideas

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:17.034
of their own identifications and of their
own personalities.

00:20:18.138 --> 00:20:24.737
Now, it is quite, again, a paradox that we
don’t want people

00:20:24.938 --> 00:20:31.797
to dress up indecently or we don’t want
people to behave indecently.

00:20:31.998 --> 00:20:36.515
Decency is a very big part of Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:36.716 --> 00:20:41.957
So one can ask that, "Mother, when you say
you have to completely dissolve,

00:20:42.158 --> 00:20:45.260
then why should we have this dignity?

00:20:45.461 --> 00:20:48.878
Why should we worry about having
the dignity?" It's quite all right.

00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:52.289
This question is all right. The answer is
like this:

00:20:52.490 --> 00:21:05.043
Supposing, you put a drop of some filth in
the ocean, then the ocean can become dirty.

00:21:05.244 --> 00:21:10.429
If you put some poison, then the whole
ocean can become poisonous.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:17.397
In the same way, whatever is not congenial
to the ocean,

00:21:17.598 --> 00:21:22.033
to this Divine power, should not be done.

00:21:22.234 --> 00:21:28.569
Otherwise, you will spoil the whole of it.
We have had experiences.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:32.690
We have had Sahaja Yogis who were leaders
also,

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:38.698
and they tried to be quite funny and
the whole collectivity was spoilt.

00:21:38.899 --> 00:21:45.073
One person who is not a good person can
spoil the whole collectivity.

00:21:45.274 --> 00:21:52.379
The one who is then a leader, on top
of that, is even worse.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:58.550
So, one has to understand that, when you
are becoming a drop of the ocean,

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:04.423
this ocean is the pure ocean of love.

00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:10.543
In that you should not do something that
will create repulsion, frustration,

00:22:10.744 --> 00:22:20.157
or even sometimes it can create a very
grotesque image of the whole ocean.

00:22:20.358 --> 00:22:25.102
That is why we have to be decent people,
decorous people.

00:22:25.303 --> 00:22:32.455
It is not that in any way we want you to be
like a dandy people or anything,

00:22:32.656 --> 00:22:38.014
but what it means that you must respect
your body, respect yourself

00:22:38.215 --> 00:22:42.386
and a respectable personality you should
have.

00:22:42.587 --> 00:22:45.599
Too much indulgence to that is not proper,

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.113
but it should be such that you should
respect yourself.

00:22:50.314 --> 00:22:53.770
It's very important. If you cannot respect
yourself

00:22:53.971 --> 00:22:59.978
you cannot respect at all the Divinity
within you.

00:23:00.179 --> 00:23:06.062
It's like a decoration of the Divinity that
your whole behavior,

00:23:06.263 --> 00:23:11.100
your whole attire has to be in such a way
that people should know

00:23:11.301 --> 00:23:14.106
that he is a decent man.

00:23:14.307 --> 00:23:20.926
Indecent things have come out and have
become now an everyday fashion.

00:23:21.127 --> 00:23:24.842
And they go on coming one after another
because of the entrepreneurs,

00:23:25.043 --> 00:23:27.401
and we are playing into the hands
of entrepreneurs.

00:23:27.602 --> 00:23:30.623
But if you know what dress you have to wear

00:23:30.824 --> 00:23:34.496
and what is good for you, once for all you
have to decide.

00:23:34.697 --> 00:23:38.030
Now the attention should not be also wasted

00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:41.380
in that, "I will today, I'll wear this kind
of a sari,

00:23:41.581 --> 00:23:44.561
tomorrow I’ll wear that kind of a dress,
third day…",

00:23:44.762 --> 00:23:49.930
because that also spoils the attention.
But if it is a decent thing,

00:23:50.131 --> 00:23:53.690
it's perfectly alright, and that will
really make you feel

00:23:53.891 --> 00:23:57.395
dignified within yourself.

00:23:57.596 --> 00:24:00.378
In modern times, as the people are, I don't
think

00:24:00.579 --> 00:24:03.998
they have much respect for themselves.

00:24:04.633 --> 00:24:08.133
You see very highly posted people, highly
placed people

00:24:08.334 --> 00:24:12.287
doing all kinds of nonsensical things like
cheating,

00:24:12.488 --> 00:24:23.044
like having relations with people who are
of dishonorable position.

00:24:23.245 --> 00:24:26.329
All this is happening. If you see
in the newspaper, you are shocked

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.677
how these people at the helm of affairs
could be like this.

00:24:30.878 --> 00:24:35.768
Because they are still not matured enough
to know where are they,

00:24:35.969 --> 00:24:38.765
what is their position, how they have
to be.

00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:43.197
If you are matured enough then you will
understand that, say, I’m a housewife,

00:24:43.398 --> 00:24:48.373
I’m such a minister, I’m prime-minister,
how I should be.

00:24:48.574 --> 00:24:54.381
That all that achievement they have outside
remains outside, doesn't go inside.

00:24:54.582 --> 00:24:58.401
But for a Sahaja Yogi it should be absorbed
within.

00:24:58.602 --> 00:25:06.200
It has to be absorbed within so that
the attention is not wasted too much.

00:25:07.772 --> 00:25:13.481
The another part which one has to see is
the heart.

00:25:14.417 --> 00:25:22.817
Some people are saying, "Mother, if our
heart is ruling the head,

00:25:23.018 --> 00:25:28.092
then we become too much emotional, we get
too much attached to people,

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:36.688
we get, you see, sort of individual
friendships and things like that."

00:25:36.889 --> 00:25:42.910
On this point, one has to know that why do
you get attached to one person?

00:25:43.111 --> 00:25:49.632
It’s not your heart. It’s not your heart.
You get attached to a person

00:25:49.833 --> 00:25:57.634
because you have some sort of a, we can
say, a relationship, maybe.

00:25:57.835 --> 00:26:01.882
Or maybe, you like the hair-dress of that
person.

00:26:02.083 --> 00:26:06.362
Maybe, you like the dress that person has.

00:26:06.563 --> 00:26:11.878
Something outside quality is attracting you
towards that person.

00:26:12.079 --> 00:26:15.813
It is not something inner quality that is
attracting.

00:26:16.014 --> 00:26:21.540
For example, if you are attached to your
children too much, you will spoil them.

00:26:21.741 --> 00:26:26.630
They will not come up to your expectations.
Anybody you get attached to,

00:26:26.831 --> 00:26:33.281
you must verify, why are you attached
to such a person, what is the reason?

00:26:33.482 --> 00:26:38.894
Now, in Sahaja Yoga people are attached
to each other very much, I know that.

00:26:39.095 --> 00:26:44.587
But it is not for any external reason.
Because somebody is rich,

00:26:44.788 --> 00:26:48.204
because somebody is famous, because
somebody is doing

00:26:48.388 --> 00:26:53.330
some sort of a extraordinary work. No.

00:26:53.531 --> 00:27:02.126
They are attached to that person because
that person is a bundle of vibrations,

00:27:02.327 --> 00:27:07.295
that it gives you tranquillity, it gives
you joy and it gives you

00:27:07.496 --> 00:27:15.065
a kind of an immense dissolution of your
being.

00:27:15.266 --> 00:27:19.350
So, that happens when you are very much
there,

00:27:19.551 --> 00:27:25.468
as I have told you the story of once this
potter

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:34.474
was kneading the clay and his name was
Gorakumhar,

00:27:34.675 --> 00:27:37.971
and when Namadeva, who was a tailor,

00:27:38.172 --> 00:27:44.246
but very well known poet, both of them
were poets, he went and he saw

00:27:44.447 --> 00:27:51.469
this potter was doing such a, I mean, it was
not a very respectable work he was doing,

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:59.441
he was busy kneading the clay, he looked
at him and what he says that,

00:27:59.642 --> 00:28:08.473
"I have come here to see the Chaitanya,
to see the formless.

00:28:08.674 --> 00:28:15.725
But what I find that the formless has got
into a form."

00:28:15.926 --> 00:28:22.204
This only, I always say, is only possible
between the two Saints of the same level.

00:28:22.405 --> 00:28:26.757
That the way they appreciate, that the way
they feel -

00:28:26.958 --> 00:28:31.126
there are no words for what I want to say -
but the way they feel

00:28:31.327 --> 00:28:37.080
the oneness, the unity, which is a subtle
one between each other.

00:28:37.281 --> 00:28:43.954
Such a feeling if you have for each other,
then know that you are

00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:48.857
really now dissolved and you are in
the ocean of joy.

00:28:49.058 --> 00:28:54.760
But on the contrary, those who are sitting
on the shores cannot feel that way.

00:28:54.961 --> 00:28:59.802
They judge, they try to find out what’s
wrong with that person, this is not so.

00:29:00.003 --> 00:29:04.652
They can never appreciate another person.
What they feel is that they have a right

00:29:04.853 --> 00:29:10.789
to criticize, to find out faults with others
and that they are something special.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.083
And the other person also finds some faults
with this person.

00:29:14.284 --> 00:29:18.682
So it’s a fault-finding society I find
sometimes. And you get fed up with it.

00:29:18.883 --> 00:29:24.362
But when you see that the another person
who is there,

00:29:24.563 --> 00:29:33.629
the person who is another saint, you feel
such rapport, such oneness,

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:40.116
such a spontaneous feeling for that person
which is absolutely pure.

00:29:40.317 --> 00:29:46.668
There’s no expectation, there’s no mental
activity to find out

00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:54.259
what’s wrong with that person. There’s no
judgment about what he, the person is like,

00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:04.559
but just oneness with that person you feel,
and you feel that your quality of your love

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:10.423
has got a new shine, a new dimension.

00:30:10.733 --> 00:30:15.160
So it comes to that, what we should
appreciate within ourselves

00:30:15.361 --> 00:30:21.891
is the purity of our love. When you are
pure, the purity is there,

00:30:22.092 --> 00:30:30.605
you do not get attached to anything, but
in that detachment, you are enjoying.

00:30:30.806 --> 00:30:36.836
In attachment you cannot enjoy because
in that

00:30:37.037 --> 00:30:45.559
you are bothered more about the superficial
relationship with the other person.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.127
Now, in a wider way, if you see Sahaja
Yoga,

00:30:49.328 --> 00:30:57.753
you are all very important people -
extremely important -

00:30:58.094 --> 00:31:04.758
because in the history of spirituality there
were not so many saints sitting together.

00:31:04.959 --> 00:31:09.051
Never can you see so many people from so
many countries

00:31:09.252 --> 00:31:14.998
thinking about Divinity and morality.

00:31:15.268 --> 00:31:21.701
It is impossible to get so many people
together, on any point whatsoever,

00:31:21.902 --> 00:31:28.349
who are feeling the oneness, the...

00:31:30.047 --> 00:31:36.325
you can say, the most soothing feeling
with each other.

00:31:36.526 --> 00:31:42.737
Whether it is comfortable or not,

00:31:42.938 --> 00:31:53.394
whether it is very much according to
the norms of comfort,

00:31:53.595 --> 00:32:01.772
people who are saints are absolutely happy
with other saints

00:32:01.973 --> 00:32:07.972
and other saintly people. They rush
to people who are saints.

00:32:08.173 --> 00:32:11.549
Once it happened to Me when I was
in Kolhapur

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:16.263
that they told Me, “There is a saint who
talks about You.” “So where is he?”

00:32:16.464 --> 00:32:20.325
They said, “He lives up there and it will
take at least three hours

00:32:20.526 --> 00:32:24.325
for You to climb up. He only lives there,
he doesn't come out.”

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:27.204
I said, "All right, I would like to go and
see him."

00:32:27.405 --> 00:32:32.988
So, I was walking and it started raining.

00:32:33.189 --> 00:32:36.204
So they said, "Mother, You never go
to anybody like that,

00:32:36.405 --> 00:32:42.731
why are You going to him?" I said, "No,
just I want to go up and see him."

00:32:42.932 --> 00:32:47.182
Now, this fellow, they said, had a control
over rain,

00:32:47.383 --> 00:32:54.674
but it was raining, raining, raining very
heavily, and when I climbed up

00:32:54.875 --> 00:33:00.332
I saw him sitting down and going on like
this with great anger.

00:33:00.533 --> 00:33:05.775
So, I said, "Let us go and sit in his cave

00:33:05.976 --> 00:33:09.624
because this fellow is now not in a normal
mood."

00:33:09.825 --> 00:33:16.963
So, I went and sat in the cave there, and
there he came. He couldn't walk

00:33:17.164 --> 00:33:23.313
because his... they say that his legs
became absolutely lame

00:33:23.514 --> 00:33:28.097
because of the vibrations that were too
much in him,

00:33:28.298 --> 00:33:34.009
whatever it is, he couldn't walk. So, they
brought him there, he sat down.

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:39.933
So, the first thing he asked Me, "Why
did You not allow me to stop the rain?

00:33:40.134 --> 00:33:46.252
It was raining so heavily, and when You
were coming up,

00:33:46.453 --> 00:33:51.598
I didn’t want You to get drenched the way
now You are all full of water

00:33:51.807 --> 00:33:59.128
and I didn’t want You to suffer like this
because it’s not a good welcome to You.

00:33:59.467 --> 00:34:05.760
So, did You do it just to control my ego,
because I must have developed ego

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.671
because I can control rain, that's a fact?"

00:34:08.872 --> 00:34:12.277
So I just smiled at him. I said, "See,

00:34:12.478 --> 00:34:17.677
you are My son, isn't it? And you have
bought a sari for Me.

00:34:17.878 --> 00:34:20.872
But you are a sannyasi, so I can't take
a sari from you

00:34:21.073 --> 00:34:23.119
because sannyasi dharma is different -

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.257
I'm a Gruhastha, I can't take a sari from
you.

00:34:26.458 --> 00:34:30.785
So, I deliberately got drenched so that you
could give Me a sari."

00:34:30.986 --> 00:34:36.609
The whole temper, the whole unnatural
behavior, all dropped out.

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:41.181
He became extremely sweet. "Yes, yes,"
he said, "how do You know I bought a sari?"

00:34:41.382 --> 00:34:44.162
"At least," I said, "in love you know
everything."

00:34:44.363 --> 00:34:50.002
And then he brought a sari for Me and he
did Aarti and everything.

00:34:50.203 --> 00:34:57.483
But, you see, all these things show that
how the love masters everything so easily.

00:34:57.684 --> 00:35:05.401
Small, small things, if you are expert
in expressing your love,

00:35:05.602 --> 00:35:11.085
how it works out. There are so many
incidents I can give you like this.

00:35:11.286 --> 00:35:19.816
But the main thing we have to see within
ourselves, "Do we really love each other?

00:35:20.017 --> 00:35:28.189
Do we really have affection and compassion
for others who are not even Sahaja Yogis?"

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:33.440
Those who are not Sahaja Yogis are also
the blind people.

00:35:33.641 --> 00:35:37.888
You should have compassion for them.

00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:42.521
You should feel that these people are so
unhappy

00:35:42.722 --> 00:35:46.229
and they cannot come to Sahaja Yoga

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:51.862
and they cannot become Sahaja Yogis,
and only in their ego they are satisfied.

00:35:52.063 --> 00:35:55.507
So, you must have real compassion for them.

00:35:55.708 --> 00:36:01.491
If you have this compassion you might be
told by people that,

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:06.123
"Why are you wasting your energy, you are
doing this, you are doing that?"

00:36:06.324 --> 00:36:12.072
The compassion is actually, unites all
these things within ourselves.

00:36:12.273 --> 00:36:16.905
That’s the uniting factor. First is your
attention,

00:36:17.106 --> 00:36:22.018
first,  which is very, very important,
I think.

00:36:22.219 --> 00:36:27.818
And the second one is your intellect, or
you can say your mind,

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:35.463
and the third one is your heart. They all
get somehow or other united together

00:36:35.664 --> 00:36:39.129
once you have this capacity to have
compassion.

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.415
You don't quarrel with Me or anyone, you
don't have to think about it.

00:36:42.616 --> 00:36:47.631
You just, you just feel absolutely at home
when you are compassionate

00:36:47.832 --> 00:36:52.396
and with this compassion, you are having
relations with others.

00:36:52.597 --> 00:36:59.080
Now, this compassion is not studied out
or worked out or maneuvered.

00:36:59.281 --> 00:37:04.952
It is just there. It is there. In that
compassion it forgives,

00:37:05.153 --> 00:37:07.680
it forgets all nonsensical things.

00:37:07.881 --> 00:37:14.493
The forgiveness is only possible if you
have this compassion within you.

00:37:14.694 --> 00:37:17.900
Now, even there are Sahaja Yogis who asked
me,

00:37:18.101 --> 00:37:21.120
"Mother, how can we have love and
compassion?"

00:37:21.321 --> 00:37:26.580
I mean, this is a question which many have
asked me.

00:37:26.781 --> 00:37:33.143
Now, the simple thing is that if you
develop your thoughtless awareness

00:37:33.344 --> 00:37:37.320
in your meditation, in thoughtless
awareness,

00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:41.659
you watch anything in thoughtless
awareness, any relationship you see it

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.781
in thoughtless awareness, then you’ll be
amazed

00:37:45.982 --> 00:37:50.454
how the gates of this compassion will
open out.

00:37:50.655 --> 00:37:54.327
Thoughtless awareness opens your heart,

00:37:54.528 --> 00:37:58.804
but it doesn't go to one person or
to another person,

00:37:59.005 --> 00:38:04.142
but it is throwing lights on all the sides
of your being.

00:38:04.343 --> 00:38:13.467
Everybody is benefited, everybody has
a divine feeling for you.

00:38:13.668 --> 00:38:22.944
Because this compassion is not linear,
nor is it aggressive, but it just flows

00:38:23.145 --> 00:38:26.589
and smoothes and soothes everything

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:32.654
that is chaotic, that is troublesome and
that is painful.

00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:35.213
This is what you have now.

00:38:35.414 --> 00:38:38.417
You know, these things were done by saints
long time back.

00:38:38.618 --> 00:38:42.270
But then nobody liked them, and they
crucified them - out of jealousy.

00:38:42.471 --> 00:38:47.141
Because if somebody became a saint, then
people felt very jealous of that person.

00:38:47.342 --> 00:38:51.199
So they killed them or tortured them and
troubled them.

00:38:51.392 --> 00:38:56.327
The situation is not so bad now. Of course,
there are some useless people.

00:38:56.528 --> 00:39:04.634
There are some people who are really
monsters, I agree. Forget about them.

00:39:04.835 --> 00:39:11.847
But on the whole, our attitude should be
that these are blind people.

00:39:12.048 --> 00:39:16.909
Now, looking at somebody who is, maybe,
something wrong with that person,

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:21.087
may not be good-natured - may be anything.
But in your heart

00:39:21.288 --> 00:39:27.101
you should not have any grudge, you should
not have any complaints about them.

00:39:27.302 --> 00:39:33.068
You can talk to that person about it. You
can tell him in a way that will be absorbed,

00:39:33.269 --> 00:39:38.783
but you should not try to make an issue
out of it

00:39:38.984 --> 00:39:42.079
and try to, in any way, trouble or torture
anyone.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:47.782
("Can you put off this one?" Hindi: "Put
off the fan".)

00:39:54.688 --> 00:39:59.470
You have seen already, in Sahaja Yoga,
those people who came and were troublesome

00:39:59.671 --> 00:40:05.331
and were not of any worth for us, just
dropped out by themselves.

00:40:05.532 --> 00:40:07.992
We didn't have to do much about it. They
just dropped out

00:40:08.193 --> 00:40:14.763
and they have gone into some sort of
a problematic life.

00:40:14.964 --> 00:40:18.424
I, even now, receive letters from them
saying that, “We have this problem,

00:40:18.625 --> 00:40:21.789
we have that problem and how to solve
this and solve that."

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:25.762
But it’s automatically happening because,
after all,

00:40:25.963 --> 00:40:31.675
there is a big choice going on and
the Divine s trying to decide

00:40:31.876 --> 00:40:37.288
who are capable of receiving the blessings
of the Divine.

00:40:37.489 --> 00:40:39.922
This is the only thing you have to achieve.

00:40:40.123 --> 00:40:43.703
That’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga.
Nothing else is important.

00:40:43.904 --> 00:40:49.623
There are people who are very highly
placed, tomorrow they go into dust.

00:40:49.824 --> 00:40:54.637
There are people who are regarded as very
great, famous people,

00:40:54.838 --> 00:41:00.317
they go into dust. It's all the time is
happening in your presence.

00:41:00.518 --> 00:41:05.648
Every day you read a newspaper and you
find how they are behaving.

00:41:05.849 --> 00:41:10.731
Like today, somebody told Me that in
the newspaper there was there

00:41:10.932 --> 00:41:18.600
that now one bishop is going to discotheque,
can you imagine? He is going to a disco.

00:41:18.801 --> 00:41:22.986
Now, what people must be thinking, they
must be breaking their heads,

00:41:23.187 --> 00:41:27.635
"Now what to do, this stupid fellow whom
we call as the bishop and everything,

00:41:27.836 --> 00:41:31.142
is now going to disco."

00:41:32.611 --> 00:41:36.209
What they, I mean, all whatever he had
respect,

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:40.327
maybe it is artificial, but it’s all lost,
finished.

00:41:40.528 --> 00:41:47.021
Because you see, as they are, they have
no value of themselves.

00:41:47.222 --> 00:41:52.022
They just live with their ego, "I am such
a big man. I am this, that. I am a bishop."

00:41:52.223 --> 00:41:54.967
They walk in a different way, they talk
in a different way.

00:41:55.168 --> 00:41:57.823
And suddenly how they go down.

00:41:58.024 --> 00:42:00.103
Now, what was the need for this old Johnny

00:42:00.304 --> 00:42:03.411
to go to the discotheque, I can’t
understand?

00:42:03.612 --> 00:42:10.166
So, because of this kind of life that he
is leading, thinking no end of himself,

00:42:10.367 --> 00:42:15.157
he could never see that, “One day I will
go down like that.”

00:42:15.358 --> 00:42:18.208
Another thing, which you should see
in a very wider way,

00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:23.420
that he had no feeling why people respected
him.

00:42:23.621 --> 00:42:28.549
He never knew why people had respect
for him.

00:42:28.779 --> 00:42:35.554
Or he was not conscious of it. At least
he would have preserved that. He did not.

00:42:35.755 --> 00:42:42.198
Why should he go to a place about which
he has been always denouncing

00:42:42.399 --> 00:42:47.781
and saying that these are bad places, one
should not go there?

00:42:49.293 --> 00:42:56.325
So, in your case, you have to be conscious
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:56.526 --> 00:43:00.345
If you become the ocean doesn't mean that
your consciousness has vanished,

00:43:00.546 --> 00:43:05.837
but it has enlarged. You have got
the consciousness of the ocean.

00:43:06.038 --> 00:43:11.997
You are not the one who has become like
a mesmerized person

00:43:12.198 --> 00:43:17.224
or a person who has no connection with
oneself.

00:43:17.425 --> 00:43:22.783
On the contrary, you are connected with
yourself much more than you were before.

00:43:22.984 --> 00:43:26.825
So, when you become the ocean you don't
loose your personality,

00:43:27.026 --> 00:43:30.925
but you expand your personality. You become
a greater person.

00:43:31.126 --> 00:43:36.136
And this is happening in Sahaja Yoga. I am
noticing many people are developing

00:43:36.337 --> 00:43:42.301
that kind of a personality, and they are
expressing it and manifesting it.

00:43:42.502 --> 00:43:45.295
It gives me great joy to see in My lifetime

00:43:45.496 --> 00:43:51.187
I could see such people who are doing this
kind of thing.

00:43:51.568 --> 00:43:56.393
So, whenever you are doing something,
whatever is your enterprise,

00:43:56.594 --> 00:44:01.409
whatever your lifestyle, whatever it is,
that’s all outside.

00:44:01.610 --> 00:44:08.913
One should not lose your attention, which
is towards God Almighty.

00:44:09.114 --> 00:44:13.433
If that is lost, you are lost. There is
a very nice poem

00:44:13.634 --> 00:44:20.946
Namadeva has written about that there
was a boy who was flying a kite.

00:44:21.147 --> 00:44:25.554
And the kite was floating, and this boy was
looking after the kite.

00:44:25.755 --> 00:44:31.345
And while he was talking to everybody else,
but his attention was on the kite.

00:44:31.546 --> 00:44:37.914
Then it goes further. He says that a lady
is having the little child

00:44:38.115 --> 00:44:44.618
on her body, on the waist, and she is
cleaning the house.

00:44:44.819 --> 00:44:50.755
She is cleaning with a little broom. She
has to move

00:44:50.956 --> 00:44:54.633
from here to there and after that cleaning,
she has to do other work also.

00:44:54.834 --> 00:45:00.138
But the child is here. So, her attention is
on the child

00:45:00.339 --> 00:45:03.699
that he should not fall down, something
should not happen.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.882
Though she is doing all kinds of work,
everything,

00:45:08.083 --> 00:45:13.206
her attention is on the child. In the same
way, your attention should be

00:45:13.407 --> 00:45:17.580
on your Divine power of Kundalini.

00:45:19.472 --> 00:45:23.147
There’s third one he’s described that there
are many ladies

00:45:23.348 --> 00:45:27.398
who are taking water from a river.

00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:31.152
Sometimes they have three pitchers on their
heads and walking.

00:45:31.353 --> 00:45:34.534
And while they are walking, they are
talking to each other,

00:45:34.735 --> 00:45:37.323
they are telling stories about each other
and anything,

00:45:37.524 --> 00:45:42.317
but their attention was on the pitchers,
which are on their head.

00:45:42.518 --> 00:45:46.134
In the same way, whatever we are doing,
our attention

00:45:46.335 --> 00:45:50.063
should be on our Kundalini.

00:45:50.264 --> 00:45:56.159
We should find out what are we doing.
As it is we have the light.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:02.294
But you must take light into every corner
of your life,

00:46:02.495 --> 00:46:11.337
every aspect of your thinking, every kind
of an effort you make.

00:46:11.538 --> 00:46:15.774
And you’ll be amazed, if you really watch
your attention

00:46:15.975 --> 00:46:19.104
you will really know what you are doing.

00:46:19.305 --> 00:46:22.263
It’s the attention to be watched so much

00:46:22.464 --> 00:46:31.140
that ultimately you’ll be surprised that
the attention is no more frittering away.

00:46:31.341 --> 00:46:35.749
Without the attention you cannot work out
Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:42.482
This is the main problem of Sahaja Yoga,
is that your attention has to be

00:46:42.683 --> 00:46:47.755
towards God Almighty. Otherwise, nothing
can work out.

00:46:47.956 --> 00:46:51.289
Your ascent cannot work out. Hah, if you
have come to Sahaja Yoga

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:54.306
to make money, all right, you will make
money and get out.

00:46:54.507 --> 00:46:57.658
If you have come here to show off your
knowledge and all that,

00:46:57.859 --> 00:47:01.861
you will show it and get out. If you have
come here to show

00:47:02.062 --> 00:47:08.029
your power and your authority, you stay
there and get out.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:10.844
Like that many people have gone out if you
know.

00:47:11.045 --> 00:47:17.727
And this is what is to be really taken
care of: that you don’t try

00:47:17.928 --> 00:47:21.785
to use Sahaja Yoga for all these stupid
things,

00:47:21.986 --> 00:47:29.240
which are not permanent, which are not
eternal. Sahaja Yoga is to be used just

00:47:29.441 --> 00:47:37.775
for cleansing yourself, for becoming
the ocean, the ocean of love.

00:47:37.976 --> 00:47:45.199
Now, many people also feel that love is
rather difficult,

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:52.623
because you can be harmed by others, or
somebody can take advantage of you.

00:47:52.824 --> 00:48:00.334
The main thing about love is, if it is not
a pure love, then it creates problems.

00:48:00.535 --> 00:48:03.234
Supposing you trust somebody because
of money,

00:48:03.435 --> 00:48:05.804
trust somebody because of somebody…
relationship

00:48:06.005 --> 00:48:08.685
or anything, and you go on indulging
into it,

00:48:08.886 --> 00:48:15.281
ultimately you’ll find that you will be
very disappointed. Very disappointed.

00:48:15.482 --> 00:48:23.885
But supposing you show your love, just
with purity about that person...

00:48:24.086 --> 00:48:33.985
It’s so subtle. It’s so innate within you,
built in. It’s there.

00:48:34.186 --> 00:48:41.349
We have to just open out. Every human being
is a bundle of love.

00:48:41.634 --> 00:48:45.157
And when he is afraid of others - specially
in the West,

00:48:45.358 --> 00:48:47.334
there is so many ideas they have created

00:48:47.535 --> 00:48:52.756
that you are afraid of this kind of love
and that kind of love and

00:48:52.957 --> 00:48:56.638
you see the way the perversion and
all nonsense is there.

00:48:56.839 --> 00:49:03.889
But in pure love there is a kind of
a beautiful light

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:11.533
which protects you, which guides you and
which enlightens your life completely.

00:49:11.734 --> 00:49:23.161
This light is just nourished and also, we
can say, like the lamp has to have the oil,

00:49:23.362 --> 00:49:30.558
this is the one that is for our
spirituality: the Love of a person.

00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:35.472
You are embodiment of love, take it from
Me, because you are a human being.

00:49:35.673 --> 00:49:39.559
Even the animals are there who know what
is love is.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:46.868
You see… I know that if you love a tiger,
the tiger will never harm.

00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:49.744
If you love a snake, it will never harm.

00:49:49.945 --> 00:49:56.220
If you try to love anybody who is very
cruel and very bad,

00:49:56.421 --> 00:50:02.380
gradually he will calm down. He will harm
you little bit, he will do this,

00:50:02.581 --> 00:50:07.241
he will see things and he might be mean
with you, do all kinds of things.

00:50:07.442 --> 00:50:11.581
But then, gradually you find your love
works, and works, and works.

00:50:11.782 --> 00:50:17.400
And ultimately it is your love, which is
important to that person.

00:50:17.719 --> 00:50:23.547
Now, your love is really firstly
appreciated

00:50:23.748 --> 00:50:29.408
more by innocent people, like children.
Children know what love is.

00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:36.702
If the children see you, and they run away,
that means something wrong with you.

00:50:36.903 --> 00:50:41.384
I’ve seen people… like once we were
in Japan

00:50:41.585 --> 00:50:45.932
and there were two foreigners who were
there, ladies, who were dressed up -

00:50:46.127 --> 00:50:48.901
I don't know from which hair-dresser they
had dressed up themselves

00:50:49.102 --> 00:50:55.714
and they were very much overly decorated -
and they came with us, you see.

00:50:55.915 --> 00:51:03.978
We climbed up a place to see something
and when we came down

00:51:04.179 --> 00:51:09.697
there were some children standing there.
They had gone before us. So they said,

00:51:09.898 --> 00:51:14.194
"Where are those witches?” I said, “Which?”
“Which went with you?"

00:51:14.395 --> 00:51:17.631
I said, "What do you mean?" "They came,
you know, we were frightened,

00:51:17.832 --> 00:51:21.873
we ran away to our houses. Now we have
come to tell you they are witches."

00:51:22.074 --> 00:51:24.669
These small, small little Japanese
children, you know,

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:27.503
"They are witches, you know, they are
witches. Be afraid of them."

00:51:27.704 --> 00:51:31.999
And they had decorated themselves so much,
so much hair-dressed up.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.958
They have tried to make such a beautiful
show of themselves,

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:39.912
but the… for the children, they were
witches and they ran away.

00:51:40.113 --> 00:51:43.249
And when we came, they came running and
telling us, “Don't be with them,

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:45.991
they're witches.”

00:51:46.192 --> 00:51:51.019
So, the judgment of the innocent people
is the best judgment.

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:55.482
If they are innocent, they are extremely
well equipped

00:51:55.683 --> 00:51:59.525
to judge a person - who has love and who
does not have.

00:51:59.726 --> 00:52:04.210
And they are the best people because they
will appreciate you the best.

00:52:04.411 --> 00:52:08.580
They will understand that these are people
of some high quality.

00:52:08.781 --> 00:52:15.728
But if they are not innocent, cunning,
some people are extremely cunning -

00:52:15.929 --> 00:52:19.622
that’s the intelligence part of it - they
can never appreciate you.

00:52:19.823 --> 00:52:27.092
They'll appreciate something which is,
something very, very abnormal,

00:52:27.293 --> 00:52:33.452
which from divine part, divine angle,

00:52:33.653 --> 00:52:42.817
is very, very abtuse and funny. But they
will never appreciate you.

00:52:43.018 --> 00:52:46.016
Never, cannot. Up to a point they may,
but may not.

00:52:46.217 --> 00:52:50.704
Doesn't matter. You have to appreciate
yourself.

00:52:50.905 --> 00:52:56.979
You have to know that you are not unkind
to anyone, you are not judging others,

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:03.642
and that you are appreciating everything
in that person -

00:53:03.843 --> 00:53:09.004
whatever is good in him as a human being.
It works.

00:53:09.205 --> 00:53:13.700
You have seen, this all has worked through
My love and compassion.

00:53:13.901 --> 00:53:19.006
But I’m not conscious that I’m giving you
love or compassion or anything.

00:53:19.207 --> 00:53:22.086
I’m not conscious even that I am giving you
anything.

00:53:22.287 --> 00:53:30.088
I’m not even conscious as to… I have
created such a lot of beautiful people.

00:53:30.289 --> 00:53:33.315
I am not conscious of that. It’s just
happening.

00:53:33.516 --> 00:53:36.879
Just like this tree is here, see, it is
not conscious

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:42.902
as to what it is and what it looks like.
It’s just is there.

00:53:43.103 --> 00:53:48.693
In the same way, if it happens to you,
I tell you, you become really

00:53:48.894 --> 00:53:54.175
the source of such a joy for everyone.

00:53:54.376 --> 00:54:00.095
Now, what do we have to do for this world?
What is needed to be done for this world?

00:54:00.296 --> 00:54:03.880
People talk of peace, this, that. There’s
no need to do anything.

00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:08.655
It just… you become a personality of that
kind -

00:54:08.856 --> 00:54:14.652
you emit peace, you emit love, you emit joy
to others.

00:54:14.853 --> 00:54:18.771
Now, this power is within you because it is
built-in, it's within you.

00:54:18.972 --> 00:54:24.803
It is in a potential form in every person.
Only thing, it has to be brought out.

00:54:25.004 --> 00:54:37.871
Now, with affection, you may not, but with
love and feeling that is innate within you.

00:54:38.072 --> 00:54:42.831
Because there are no words for such subtle
things that are within yourself.

00:54:43.032 --> 00:54:46.135
Because so far people don’t know what are
these things

00:54:46.336 --> 00:54:50.287
that make you feel oneness with others.

00:54:50.488 --> 00:54:58.281
All this, all this can happen to you very
easily, very easily,

00:54:58.482 --> 00:55:05.369
when you understand that you are not this
mind, you are not this body,

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:11.299
you are not this attention - you are
the Spirit.

00:55:13.477 --> 00:55:17.198
Then you introspect, "Am I the Spirit?
All right, if I am the Spirit,

00:55:17.399 --> 00:55:20.856
what is… what am I doing?"

00:55:22.884 --> 00:55:27.266
Once you become the Spirit, then you feel,
"Why not others?"

00:55:27.467 --> 00:55:31.773
Out of love and compassion. Not for
becoming some leaders or anything.

00:55:31.974 --> 00:55:36.198
Just out of love. "If I am that why not
make others like that?"

00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:39.266
And that is how Sahaja Yoga has spread
so much,

00:55:39.467 --> 00:55:43.561
and we have such gems of people, such
beautiful people

00:55:43.762 --> 00:55:49.456
that I really never expected so much
to happen in My lifetime.

00:55:49.657 --> 00:55:54.830
It has never happened with any saint, any
incarnation, any prophet.

00:55:55.031 --> 00:55:59.456
So now, you people have become absolutely

00:55:59.657 --> 00:56:04.364
‘Khalis’ means absolutely you have vacated
yourself fully.

00:56:04.565 --> 00:56:08.116
The story of Radha and Krishna is very
beautiful

00:56:08.317 --> 00:56:14.984
where Radha said that, "Why do You take
this...

00:56:20.497 --> 00:56:22.644
[Hindi: "I don’t know the English word
for Murli’"],

00:56:22.845 --> 00:56:26.389
flute... to Your throat? Why do You take
this?"

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:30.287
Because Murli is such a sweet thing, ‘na’,
flute is not so sweet.

00:56:30.488 --> 00:56:34.757
"But why do You take this flute to Your
lips?"

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:39.916
After all… She, She must have been jealous,
I think so.

00:56:40.602 --> 00:56:46.919
So, it's a story, just a story. So, He
said, "Why not go and ask the flute?"

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.561
So, flute She went and asked, "Why
Shri Krishna

00:56:50.762 --> 00:56:54.338
takes you to His lips all the time?"

00:56:54.539 --> 00:56:58.340
So, he said, she said, "You know,

00:56:58.541 --> 00:57:03.634
I have become completely hollow. There’s
nothing in me.

00:57:03.835 --> 00:57:11.101
He puts me to His lips and people say
that I am playing the tune.

00:57:11.302 --> 00:57:17.127
It’s He who is playing the tune. Where
am I? I’m not there.

00:57:17.328 --> 00:57:22.409
I’m just enjoying the same tune, which is
passing through me.

00:57:23.777 --> 00:57:28.975
That is the expression." But then Radha
told Shri Krishna,

00:57:29.176 --> 00:57:33.193
"Why don't You make (me) the same way
as the flute?"

00:57:33.394 --> 00:57:38.764
So, this is what you have to be, the flute,
means you have to be hollow within yourself.

00:57:38.965 --> 00:57:45.856
All these little, little things, you know,
which come into your life are not important.

00:57:46.057 --> 00:57:51.867
What is important is - have you become
completely hollow?

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:55.853
This is where, I would say, introspection
will help.

00:57:56.054 --> 00:58:01.099
The one who makes the flute is also within
you.

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:08.651
So let there be a flute made out of you
by yourself only.

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:15.296
This is the way you make yourself what you
have to become.

00:58:15.497 --> 00:58:20.267
In Gita Shri Krishna has said, "Atmaneva
Atmane Shrushta",

00:58:20.468 --> 00:58:24.090
means the Spirit gets satisfied by itself.

00:58:24.291 --> 00:58:27.934
Isn't it very difficult thing to
understand -

00:58:28.135 --> 00:58:31.632
how can the Spirit be satisfied by itself?

00:58:31.833 --> 00:58:34.806
But now you can understand what
Shri Krishna has said

00:58:35.007 --> 00:58:40.880
that your own Spirit becomes satisfied with
itself.

00:58:41.081 --> 00:58:44.229
Then it doesn't require any other
satisfaction.

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:48.533
You seek the comfort of your Spirit, you
seek the joy of your Spirit,

00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:51.861
you seek the beauty of your Spirit.

00:58:52.062 --> 00:59:01.751
You don't even seek, but it is in itself
is filled with that joy of the Spirit

00:59:01.952 --> 00:59:07.234
and it only can be satisfied by itself.

00:59:07.435 --> 00:59:10.400
There are many people who say, "I am not
satisfied, you see,

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:15.720
this I am not very much satisfied, it is
not that I am satisfied."

00:59:16.144 --> 00:59:22.116
In the same way, the Spirit can say,
"I am not satisfied."

00:59:22.317 --> 00:59:28.240
But the Spirit can be satisfied with Spirit
only.

00:59:28.687 --> 00:59:33.760
It’s like the reflection in the mirror.
When you look at the mirror you see there

00:59:34.057 --> 00:59:39.154
your own reflection. Now, if the mirror is
not all right, I will say,

00:59:39.355 --> 00:59:43.080
"I am not satisfied with what reflection
we are getting out of this mirror."

00:59:43.281 --> 00:59:45.879
So you’ll change the mirror, you’ll bring
the better mirror,

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:50.914
you'll try to get a better picture
of yourself. In the same way,

00:59:51.115 --> 00:59:57.795
the Spirit which is reflected within you,
wants to see its own image.

00:59:57.996 --> 01:00:03.468
And then what you do is to… you go on,
somehow or other,

01:00:03.669 --> 01:00:11.065
changing, cleaning, making it all right
through your meditation

01:00:11.266 --> 01:00:15.903
so that your Spirit is satisfied with
the Spirit.

01:00:16.104 --> 01:00:20.112
Shri Krishna wrote Gita in such a ambiguous
manner because He was very clever.

01:00:20.313 --> 01:00:22.459
He knew human beings cannot take things
straight,

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.640
so tell them this way, that way, that way,

01:00:24.841 --> 01:00:29.216
so that they’ll run around and then
ultimately they will come to Truth.

01:00:29.417 --> 01:00:34.330
But Truth is very simple. Truth is
extremely simple.

01:00:34.531 --> 01:00:38.076
You don't have to go here and there and
you don't have to stand on your legs

01:00:38.277 --> 01:00:43.591
or feet all the time. You don't have
to fight with anything.

01:00:43.792 --> 01:00:50.525
You don't have to take to some sort of
a ‘tapasya’, abstinence - nothing.

01:00:50.726 --> 01:00:59.447
Only just you become like a flute. You
become hollow.

01:00:59.648 --> 01:01:03.728
It’s not difficult. It’s not difficult
at all for Sahaja Yogis

01:01:03.929 --> 01:01:08.311
because already the Kundalini has made
you hollow. It’s not difficult.

01:01:08.512 --> 01:01:15.211
But still, I find people deviate. Their
attention goes here and there.

01:01:15.412 --> 01:01:18.401
So many people have told Me how their
problems were solved

01:01:18.602 --> 01:01:22.457
without doing anything about it. I said,
"What did you do?"

01:01:22.658 --> 01:01:27.672
"No, Mother, we just put it at Your lotus
feet." I said, "Really?"

01:01:27.873 --> 01:01:32.303
"Yes, that's all. Or we were just looking
at the problem, what the problem is.

01:01:32.504 --> 01:01:37.449
We were standing outside and looking
at the problem and the problem got solved."

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:41.255
Even the most difficult problems that you
think, can be solved

01:01:41.456 --> 01:01:49.072
very easily because you have powers. Your
powers are great.

01:01:49.273 --> 01:01:54.204
You are saints, but more than saints,

01:01:54.651 --> 01:02:00.787
much more than saints because you are born
at such a volatile times.

01:02:00.988 --> 01:02:06.753
Like supposing, you have a light in
darkness, you are finding something,

01:02:06.954 --> 01:02:10.717
you bump into that and you bump into that.

01:02:10.918 --> 01:02:16.765
But supposing, this is a place full of gas,

01:02:17.146 --> 01:02:24.601
you bring one light, the whole thing becomes
enlightened. Like that you have powers.

01:02:24.802 --> 01:02:33.373
But you must get out of this nonsense
of "me", "my" and "mine".

01:02:34.497 --> 01:02:38.553
I don't know how to say you get out -
It’s not like a swimming pool,

01:02:38.754 --> 01:02:42.287
that you jump into it and get out. It’s not
like that.

01:02:42.488 --> 01:02:50.920
It is another kind of a very subtle
understanding that our roots have to grow.

01:02:51.121 --> 01:02:54.678
And for growing our roots, we have to go
within ourselves

01:02:54.879 --> 01:03:03.123
and find out within ourselves what is
the area we are occupying,

01:03:03.324 --> 01:03:10.961
in what areas in our lifestyle we are
taking these roots inside.

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:17.564
Also, Shri Krishna has said that the tree
of life has the roots in the brain

01:03:17.765 --> 01:03:21.300
and grows downward. It’s very interesting
to understand

01:03:21.501 --> 01:03:24.983
that the roots are growing in the brain.

01:03:25.184 --> 01:03:33.311
That means, your own intellect is just
covered with compassion,

01:03:33.512 --> 01:03:44.769
it’s just being absolutely one with
compassion.

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.907
I had told you a story about a saint

01:03:48.108 --> 01:03:52.595
who was to take to… water for the Deity
n Gujarat

01:03:52.796 --> 01:03:59.852
and he walked one month to go there with
a pitcher of water.

01:04:00.053 --> 01:04:07.940
And then at the… because it was a very
high mountain on which this Deity was,

01:04:08.141 --> 01:04:13.660
and he reached at the foothill.

01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:18.999
There he found a little donkey dying
of thirst

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.679
so he poured all the water for that donkey.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.449
So those who were with him, they asked,
"What are you doing?

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:30.366
You brought it all the way, and why are
you putting it for this donkey?"

01:04:30.567 --> 01:04:31.535
He said, "You don't know?

01:04:31.736 --> 01:04:35.645
The God has come all the way down, just
to meet me here.

01:04:35.846 --> 01:04:37.941
He doesn't want me to climb up."

01:04:38.142 --> 01:04:46.378
This kind of an absolutely simple
understanding

01:04:46.579 --> 01:04:54.345
of another's feelings and another's
problems:

01:04:54.546 --> 01:04:58.812
you can solve them, you can sort them out.

01:04:59.013 --> 01:05:01.934
And the person will tell you that, "You
sorted out my problem."

01:05:02.135 --> 01:05:08.003
But you will not know how you have solved
because this love is the power.

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:11.885
This love can see things. It is everything.

01:05:12.086 --> 01:05:15.931
It’s like a… you see a television,
all right, it’s a television.

01:05:16.132 --> 01:05:18.555
If you see a telephone, it's a telephone.

01:05:18.756 --> 01:05:27.243
If you see anything you do with the power,
it’s all is embodied inside this love.

01:05:27.444 --> 01:05:32.033
You need not have to telephone. I never
telephone to anyone.

01:05:32.234 --> 01:05:35.704
Mostly I never telephone. I mean, if
somebody forces Me then it’s all right.

01:05:35.905 --> 01:05:39.051
I never telephone. But not to save
the bill,

01:05:39.252 --> 01:05:43.612
but I do not telephone because there is
no need.

01:05:43.813 --> 01:05:47.925
The whole subtle of the ether is at your
feet.

01:05:48.126 --> 01:05:54.576
Just you want to do something you can just
do it, just with the vibrations.

01:05:54.777 --> 01:05:59.794
Now, many people say, "Mother, cure this
person, cure that person." There’s no need.

01:05:59.995 --> 01:06:05.706
You all can cure, you are so many. You can
cure anyone you want to,

01:06:05.907 --> 01:06:09.222
but you bring that person to Me. It’s not
needed.

01:06:09.423 --> 01:06:12.142
Just you can cure anybody you feel like.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:18.551
You can solve all their problems yourself.
One little Bandhan can solve it.

01:06:18.752 --> 01:06:22.319
But for that you should be the source
of love.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:31.148
Once you give a Bandhan, the… this powerful
love takes over,

01:06:31.349 --> 01:06:34.792
"All right, I'll do the job."

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:40.586
But for that you have to be the master
of this beautiful thing.

01:06:40.787 --> 01:06:45.644
Now, one thing is very different from other
masteries.

01:06:45.845 --> 01:06:49.400
In other masteries, you see people try
to dominate

01:06:49.601 --> 01:06:54.820
or to, try to use it for destroying others.

01:06:55.021 --> 01:07:03.835
But the mastery of love is that you know
how to build

01:07:04.805 --> 01:07:13.366
a rapport with the Divine love. And this
Divine love is not only powerful,

01:07:13.567 --> 01:07:24.830
but it is such a efficient, I should say,
such an alert instrument

01:07:25.031 --> 01:07:28.127
which works out everything in such a manner

01:07:28.328 --> 01:07:33.091
that you are amazed how things have worked
out.

01:07:33.292 --> 01:07:36.946
And everybody has noticed it. I know you
all know it.

01:07:37.147 --> 01:07:39.644
Not that you don't know, but you don't use.

01:07:39.845 --> 01:07:44.404
You have to be on the vibratory awareness
and use that.

01:07:44.605 --> 01:07:48.519
Even giving yourself is a Bandhan itself
clarifies you.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:55.855
Imagine in your hand there is this great
power of giving you this balance,

01:07:56.056 --> 01:08:00.261
this love, this affection and all
the protection

01:08:00.462 --> 01:08:04.951
while you can give it to others also. You
have become now

01:08:05.152 --> 01:08:10.291
the part and parcel of the Divine power.
You are now in the Kingdom of God.

01:08:10.492 --> 01:08:15.169
And whatever you want to do can be done
by this divine power.

01:08:15.370 --> 01:08:20.404
With all this telling you I still feel,
sometimes, you are not confident.

01:08:20.605 --> 01:08:26.861
You get upset. You feel that, "How can
this be?"

01:08:27.062 --> 01:08:30.722
You have no trust in yourself, you have no
faith in yourself.

01:08:30.923 --> 01:08:38.089
And also there are some people, sort of,
who feel they are neglected,

01:08:38.290 --> 01:08:42.152
or something should have happened to them.

01:08:42.353 --> 01:08:47.515
Once a lady started crying. So, I said,
"Why is she crying?"

01:08:47.716 --> 01:08:52.720
She said, "Because Mother didn't smile
at me." I didn’t smile at her?

01:08:52.921 --> 01:08:58.345
But I never smiled at anyone. I don't know
why she thinks like that.

01:08:58.546 --> 01:09:04.834
So, I asked her, "Why do you want Me
to smile at you? What's wrong with you?

01:09:05.035 --> 01:09:08.122
You are all right? Why should I smile
at you?"

01:09:08.323 --> 01:09:11.124
So, you see, also this kind of a feeling

01:09:11.325 --> 01:09:14.472
that comes up sometimes that in Sahaja
Yoga,

01:09:14.673 --> 01:09:19.649
Mother should all the time be only attached
to you.

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:24.406
She cannot get attached, you know.
It’s a helpless condition I have.

01:09:24.607 --> 01:09:29.219
There are so many, you don't know, defects
I have, which you have no idea.

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:31.295
I don't know how to count money.

01:09:31.496 --> 01:09:34.665
If I… give Me hundred rupees I’ll count it
two hundred rupees.

01:09:34.866 --> 01:09:37.211
You see, I don't know many things. I don't
know banking;

01:09:37.412 --> 01:09:41.033
I don't know many things and one of them
is I don't know

01:09:41.234 --> 01:09:47.181
how to put attention to this person or
to that person. Like politicians would do -

01:09:47.382 --> 01:09:52.026
"You see, ah, you must look after this man,
because he is very important." Nothing.

01:09:52.227 --> 01:09:57.807
To Me you are just part and parcel of Me,
finished, nothing more than that.

01:09:58.008 --> 01:10:03.849
So, you see, everybody so should know that
you are very close to My heart,

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:08.711
you are very much there, I am very proud
of you. And something,

01:10:08.912 --> 01:10:14.685
really it’s a miracle that has happened,
that you people have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

01:10:14.886 --> 01:10:19.784
So on that point also, that how much Mother
cares for me, what She does...

01:10:19.985 --> 01:10:22.582
Now supposing, I tell somebody, "All right,
you don't sit here, sit there,"

01:10:22.783 --> 01:10:26.264
they feel bad. Anything you do, they feel
bad.

01:10:26.465 --> 01:10:32.152
This kind of a person has no sense of love.
He doesn't understand Mother's love.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:35.132
So, at the end of the whole thing I must
tell you,

01:10:35.333 --> 01:10:39.916
that when you are a guru, you are also
a mother.

01:10:40.117 --> 01:10:46.087
You have to express yourself like a mother.
She is kind, she is gentle, she forgives.

01:10:46.288 --> 01:10:50.730
She also corrects whenever it’s necessary,
but in her own sweet way she corrects

01:10:50.931 --> 01:10:55.479
so the correction takes place - it's not
that a rebellion starts.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:11:02.260
So all that wisdom of a mother is within
you, is already there, so please try to use.

01:11:02.445 --> 01:11:08.489
I am sure, it will all work out and as it
is we are a very beautiful group of people

01:11:08.690 --> 01:11:19.820
who are something out of the blue, who are
so much in peace and in joy together.

01:11:20.021 --> 01:11:23.288
May God bless you all.

01:11:32.786 --> 01:11:37.172
So, today's Guru Puja will be... Of course,
we can -

01:11:37.373 --> 01:11:40.986
we can have a little of Ganesha's Atharva
Sheersha,

01:11:41.187 --> 01:11:44.425
but Devi Puja will be much less.

01:11:44.626 --> 01:11:50.628
And for Guru Puja I would request
the country leaders to come up.

01:11:50.829 --> 01:11:55.539
Country leaders have to come up. So it is
in a different way,

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:59.635
we can say that the main thing is
the Guru Puja

01:11:59.836 --> 01:12:02.295
where the country leaders have to come up.

01:12:02.496 --> 01:12:08.565
The Devi Puja will be followed after that,
which is very short.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.523
(Hindi: "Please, change this tea.")
