EXPRESSION OF SUBTLE ELEMENTS

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:33.302
For Sahaja Yogis now it’s very easy
to find out if something is real or unreal,

00:00:33.502 --> 00:00:37.714
it is truth or untruth, it is love
or hatred.

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:41.177
Only through vibrations you can know.

00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:44.953
But going beyond that, I’m saying,

00:00:45.153 --> 00:00:49.560
beyond that one has to know what are
these vibrations,

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.857
and what are they made of.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:13.665
What is the subtly - subtle force which
is behind those vibrations?

00:01:13.866 --> 00:01:18.192
We call it is Paramchaitanya; all right,
Paramchaitanya, so what?

00:01:18.392 --> 00:01:21.978
What happens to you when you get
Paramchaitanya

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:25.433
is something to be understood,
the subtleties.

00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:32.314
As I said, we are made of five elements,
all right?

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:36.399
So, when you get your awakening, when
the Kundalini reaches Sahastrara

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:42.054
and opens out your fontanel bone area,
you become one with the divine Power;

00:01:42.255 --> 00:01:47.669
then this divine Power Itself starts
flowing through you.

00:01:48.945 --> 00:01:51.692
A connection is established.

00:01:51.893 --> 00:01:56.204
Now when She starts flowing through you,
the Shakti,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.184
this starts flowing through you, then
what happens?

00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:08.911
The subtle part we should understand.
The subtle part is like this,

00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:15.256
that these five elements we are made of,
these vibrations gradually start breaking

00:02:15.457 --> 00:02:21.956
into the subtler form of which they
are made.

00:02:22.157 --> 00:02:27.646
So the first thing such a person has
is the breaks, you see,

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:32.771
as it is said that “Word is God.”

00:02:32.972 --> 00:02:38.114
It’s said also in the Bible, “The Word
is God.” Now what is this Word?

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:43.026
Word is a silent, you can say,

00:02:43.227 --> 00:02:49.045
silent commandment, we can call it
like that.

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:53.539
But from that Word comes, according
to Indian philosophy,

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.513
is another thing that we call as bindu.

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:07.407
Or we can say Word becomes naad,
is a sound,

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:13.482
and then it becomes the bindu: means one -
what you call it, Bindu -

00:03:13.683 --> 00:03:20.499
is a, one small dot, you can say.
And then from this dot, you see,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.759
all these five elements start coming
one after another.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.341
The first element that comes out is light –

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:39.495
tej – light, is the first element that
comes out,

00:03:39.696 --> 00:03:45.754
so the essence of the first element
is light.

00:03:47.286 --> 00:03:52.943
We call it tej, tejas. Is written of course
in Sanskrit,

00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:59.446
but we should understand that how the light
pervades Sahaja Yoga

00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:03.679
so much, and you see the light all around,
everywhere.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.984
So the first element which is light,
and you can say in English,

00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:25.539
the light’s subtle thing is, we can say,
enlightenment, you can say;

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:32.211
but “enlightenment” has another meaning,
so we can say it’s tej, tej.

00:04:32.412 --> 00:04:35.169
For example, a person who gets Realization
has a face

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.213
which is very radiant, so we can say
the “radiance.”

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:46.916
The radiance is the subtlety of the light.

00:04:47.117 --> 00:04:50.863
So this radiance starts showing
on your face.

00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:54.462
Radiance start expressing itself,

00:04:54.662 --> 00:05:01.879
and with that radiance people get
impressed, and they start thinking

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:06.813
something special about this personality
which has radiance.

00:05:07.013 --> 00:05:09.521
Now you have seen My photographs also
wherever they are,

00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:14.352
many-a-times you find lots of light around.

00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:22.621
That is nothing but the light in Me
is giving radiance,

00:05:22.821 --> 00:05:25.680
because the light becomes subtler.

00:05:25.881 --> 00:05:31.913
When the light becomes subtler in Me –
light, light is one of the elements –

00:05:32.113 --> 00:05:36.546
when it becomes subtler then it gives
radiance,

00:05:36.747 --> 00:05:43.887
and so this is the subtle growth within you
that takes place.

00:05:44.088 --> 00:05:49.310
Your faces also start shining.
They too have radiance

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:56.320
and they too have a kind of a different
complexion, I would say.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:04.248
This radiance is to be understood,
is the subtle of the light

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.392
of which we are made – light, in the gross
manner.

00:06:09.593 --> 00:06:15.387
Then after this, from the light, comes
the second thing

00:06:15.587 --> 00:06:20.980
which we call as vayu in Sanskrit,
meaning the air.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:28.025
So the air that we have, which is gross
air, what is the subtle of air

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:30.875
is this cool breeze that you get.

00:06:31.076 --> 00:06:35.337
The cool breeze is the subtle of that air.

00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:41.856
So the subtle of what you understand
as cool breeze

00:06:42.057 --> 00:06:48.668
is what we call vibrations, the subtle
of that is air,

00:06:48.868 --> 00:06:55.326
which is a part and parcel of our making.
So this cool breeze

00:06:55.526 --> 00:07:00.976
is the second thing that you start getting
subtler and subtler.

00:07:01.177 --> 00:07:07.449
When your growth take place, all these
subtle things start expressing themselves.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.086
It’s not only that you get vibrations
but you get the cool breeze,

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:18.281
and that is the subtle of air that has
built you up.

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:26.106
Then comes the water. We are also made
of water.

00:07:26.307 --> 00:07:32.146
What is the subtle of water is –

00:07:35.662 --> 00:07:44.852
sometimes English language, you know,
becomes little short of expressions, but they call it,

00:07:45.052 --> 00:07:56.344
I mean, which makes the skin, hard skin
soft. The skin becomes soft.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:05.246
This is another sign of a realized soul,

00:08:06.078 --> 00:08:10.059
that his – there’s some cream they use,
there, isn’t it, to soften the face.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:14.876
This is the minimum of minimum I would say,
but then a person

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:21.082
who is a realized soul becomes a very
soft person, very delicate.

00:08:21.282 --> 00:08:29.621
When he talks to somebody, in his voice
there is warmth, or I should say

00:08:29.822 --> 00:08:36.458
there is  “jise kehte hein apne yahan pani,
Hindi mein kehte hein pani hona”:

00:08:36.658 --> 00:08:43.620
the, to have that flow, watery flow
and the coolness of the water.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.322
So that is the another subtle thing that
should be expressed

00:08:48.523 --> 00:08:53.634
in your behavior, on your skin, on your
dealings with others,

00:08:53.834 --> 00:09:05.268
that you should be like the water which is mobile, which is cooling, which is soothing, which is cleansing.

00:09:05.469 --> 00:09:09.827
So this also becomes a part and parcel
of your being,

00:09:10.027 --> 00:09:13.463
once you become a realized soul.

00:09:13.664 --> 00:09:20.622
With this water you have also another
thing, it as agni: means the fire.

00:09:20.823 --> 00:09:24.925
So you also have fire, but is a very
silent fire.

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:30.074
It doesn’t burn anybody, but it burns
all the wrong things within you.

00:09:30.306 --> 00:09:35.719
Whatever wrong things you have it burns, and it burns the wrong things in other people also.

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:40.569
For example, a person comes with a great
anger towards you;

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:48.376
what happens, that this anger becomes
cooled down with the fire that is there.

00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:56.255
Moreover a realized soul cannot get burnt,
fire cannot burn.

00:09:56.456 --> 00:10:01.818
The burning cannot come, to him.
It’s very important to understand.

00:10:02.019 --> 00:10:08.763
Also if you are doing something wrong
it may burn you,

00:10:08.964 --> 00:10:14.130
but if you are a good Sahaja Yogi and,
I should say, a perfect Sahaja Yogi,

00:10:14.331 --> 00:10:18.294
fire will never burn you. We have
an example of Sitaji,

00:10:18.495 --> 00:10:23.411
that She went into the fire pariksha,
nothing burnt Her.

00:10:23.612 --> 00:10:29.925
So this is what one has to understand, that
once you get to the subtleties of the fire,

00:10:30.126 --> 00:10:37.795
so the fire and the water, both of them
become sort of divine.

00:10:37.996 --> 00:10:43.318
For example, the water which you touch,
water you drink,

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:51.224
whatever you put your hand in the water,
the water becomes vibrated - means what?

00:10:51.425 --> 00:10:53.883
The subtlety of the water comes in it,

00:10:54.083 --> 00:11:00.349
the coolness, curing power also comes
in that water.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.878
So when it becomes subtler all these
powers start showing,

00:11:05.078 --> 00:11:09.917
which you can see for yourself. You don’t
have to experiment.

00:11:11.652 --> 00:11:18.755
Then the lastly is the Mother Earth.
Is most important, is Mother Earth.

00:11:18.956 --> 00:11:23.753
There’s a photograph you might see
which was taken in Russia in My dacha

00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:28.893
where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth,
they have shown clearly.

00:11:29.094 --> 00:11:33.981
It’s there, and it is the Mother Earth
which shows (it).

00:11:34.182 --> 00:11:38.107
For example, I have seen flowers, if you
keep them in My room,

00:11:38.308 --> 00:11:42.624
they blossom. They can become very big
like that;

00:11:42.825 --> 00:11:47.076
never people have seen such big flowers,
sometimes they say.

00:11:47.277 --> 00:11:50.967
I’m doing nothing, I’m just sitting down,
and what happens to the flowers?

00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:56.436
You see now there this principle
of the Mother Earth works,

00:11:56.637 --> 00:12:00.436
the subtle Mother Earth is works:
it’s a mother,

00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:08.000
and that gives you all the nourishment
and makes you grow healthy,

00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:13.323
and this is how this subtlety works,
of the Mother Earth.

00:12:13.523 --> 00:12:17.252
Mother Earth is the one who is a giver
of birth

00:12:17.453 --> 00:12:21.284
to all these flowers and all these trees
and all that,

00:12:21.485 --> 00:12:24.297
but it also plays a big part in us.

00:12:24.497 --> 00:12:30.693
It’s not only the Mother Earth that exists
without our connection.

00:12:30.894 --> 00:12:34.387
And we do not respect the Mother Earth.
We have polluted it,

00:12:34.596 --> 00:12:37.514
we have done all kinds of things; we have
removed the trees

00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:41.709
and we have made a mess out of her,
but she is our Mother,

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:46.219
and so many subtle things of this Mother
Earth come into us.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:53.186
One of them is gravity. A person becomes
very attractive,

00:12:53.387 --> 00:12:58.261
not in the physical sense but
in the spiritual sense.

00:12:58.461 --> 00:13:03.601
Such a person attracts others. They feel
attracted,

00:13:03.801 --> 00:13:09.741
and they feel that something specially
is about this person, you see.

00:13:09.942 --> 00:13:14.396
This is one of the quality of the Mother
Earth. If she had not kept us

00:13:14.597 --> 00:13:18.766
attracted we would have fallen off
with her movement.

00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:25.249
And also other qualities of the Mother
Earth also start manifesting within us,

00:13:25.449 --> 00:13:35.184
and we become very, I should say
extremely tolerant, patient person,

00:13:35.384 --> 00:13:39.599
tolerant and patient, extremely tolerant
and patient.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.133
But if you are not tolerant, if you are
hot-tempered and all that,

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:47.894
that Mother Earth principle has not
expressed itself.

00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:51.176
Look at the Mother Earth, how much
she tolerates our nonsense;

00:13:51.377 --> 00:13:56.415
how many wrong things we do against her,
but still she tolerates.

00:13:56.616 --> 00:14:00.628
Only after Realization you are connected
with reality,

00:14:00.828 --> 00:14:08.098
and you can get the understanding
of all these subtleties

00:14:08.298 --> 00:14:11.061
working through you. Why I’m telling
you this,

00:14:11.262 --> 00:14:15.220
because I want you to know and recognize
yourself,

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.475
to understand what you are, what you
have got.

00:14:18.676 --> 00:14:24.106
Once you recognize yourself and understand
yourself, you can do a lot.

00:14:24.307 --> 00:14:28.741
I am here to give you Self Realization,
and the understanding

00:14:28.942 --> 00:14:33.249
that whatever you have got you must
accept as a challenge.

00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:36.261
Take it up as a challenge, and you will
be amazed

00:14:36.462 --> 00:14:40.128
how you will be helped and how you will
get the results.

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:45.353
“Sahaj” doesn’t mean only that you get
spontaneous Realization,

00:14:45.553 --> 00:14:50.283
it also means you get spontaneity,
the whole nature gets spontaneity.

00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:55.762
All those subtle things that I have told you, they all get spontaneous and they work it out.

00:14:55.963 --> 00:15:02.484
If you take to introspection, you’ll be
surprised to see, yes, you have these powers,

00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:06.940
and you can do wonders. So I bless you all.

00:15:07.141 --> 00:15:10.215
Please develop those subtle things
within you.

00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:15.289
They are already there; you don’t have
to do anything, only understand and locate.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.441
Thank you very much.
