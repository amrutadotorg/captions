1
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,480
Please be seated.

2
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,360
Hello, so we were waiting for you to come.

3
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,800
So, I think, get My sweater.

4
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,840
Hello, we were waiting for you to come, for Christopher to come here.

5
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,160
How is he? Very good. What's happened to his head?

6
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,000
Changing of milk Shri Mother.

7
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,760
So Christopher you are back, here?

8
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,760
You must cover his head. It's very cold still.

9
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,320
All right. All right. All right.

10
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,640
What's the matter?

11
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,960
He is in meditation.

12
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,200
You must keep him close, all the time.

13
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,920
Better cover him more.

14
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
No, get something more from inside.

15
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,720
I think you also wear your sweater or something.

16
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,720
It's rather cold outside.

17
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,000
Cover him much more on the head.

18
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,480
SY: This is a present from the Austrian Sahaja Yogis.

19
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,280
Austrian Sahaja Yogis to the French Sahaja Yogis.

20
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,720
It's beautiful.

21
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,920
“And I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse”.

22
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,480
SM: Translate in French.

23
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,080
At last I also bring My sweater. Jenny you can bring.

24
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,800
Sweater for Shri Mataji.

25
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,680
SY: Mother I have a gift, two gifts for you.

26
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,520
First from Rouen we offer You the [unclear]

27
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,880
where You meet us Saturday.

28
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,480
And the armour of the town.

29
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,440
SM: Oh, I see.

30
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,680
SY: The blazon of the town of Rouen.

31
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,040
SM: What's that? SY: The blazon of the city, of Rouen.

32
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,760
SM: And what are these marks about?

33
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,880
SY: Three lilies. SM: Lilies?

34
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,640
SY: I think it's like a lotus in France, in old kingdom.

35
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,000
SM: Beautiful. Thank you very much.

36
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,840
Can you keep it?

37
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,160
It's quite cold today. The wind will blow away the clouds.

38
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,480
As soon as I came out here.

39
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,000
It plays, you see it plays some tricks with you all the time.

40
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,680
Yes, better have him covered. And you too wear something warm.

41
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,720
I hope you are all warm enough.

42
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,200
I am so happy and joyous

43
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,640
to be here with so many Sahaja Yogis,

44
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,880
and so many of them are very new...

45
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,680
not very new to Me,

46
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,120
perhaps I have known all of you,

47
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,920
thousands of years back.

48
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,080
You are sitting in the sun.

49
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:29,840
In Sahaja Yoga you all have to understand one simple thing —

50
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,560
that you are the spirit.

51
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,160
And whatever is not the spirit

52
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,360
is not yourself.

53
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,440
We can compare spirit with the sun.

54
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,520
The sun can be covered with the clouds,

55
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,480
there could be superimpositions on the sun,

56
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,160
but sun remains as it is, at its point.

57
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,120
You cannot enlighten the sun.

58
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,520
It is illumined by itself.

59
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
Now, when the clouds are removed,

60
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,640
the superimpositions are removed,

61
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,120
the sun shines through the atmosphere.

62
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,160
So, our spirit is also

63
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:10,880
is superimposed by ignorance.

64
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,240
As long as there is superimposition,

65
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,440
you can't see the spirit.

66
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,560
And even when few clouds disappear

67
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,520
the superimposition exists.

68
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,000
One has to have a clear sky

69
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:56,720
to see the light of the spirit shining through.

70
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,920
There are many ways by which we can try to remove the clouds.

71
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,600
The first and the foremost thing is the assumption, the faith

72
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,080
that you are the spirit

73
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,640
and that the rest is superimposition.

74
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,360
You have to assume that within yourself —

75
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,000
after Realization it should become very easy —

76
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,040
that you are something much more,

77
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,880
something very different

78
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,480
from what you have known so far.

79
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:20,160
So, now the new situation arises —

80
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,000
that you do not have a blind faith,

81
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:40,160
but you have a faith that has come out of an experience.

82
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,400
So your intellect should not fight it.

83
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,760
It should not try to challenge it.

84
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,040
If it challenges and if you're ill to your intellect,

85
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,240
you'll again go down.

86
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,400
Even if you get the glimpse of a star in the sky,

87
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,480
then the scientists believe that there is a star.

88
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,480
So, in the same manner,

89
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,560
even if you get the glimpse of your Realization,

90
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,800
you have to at least believe that you are also a spirit.

91
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,440
You go on sticking on to that experience

92
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,600
and keeping your attention on the fact

93
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,400
that you are the spirit.

94
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,280
Tell your intellect not to cheat you anymore.

95
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,280
You can turn the face of your intellect by this.

96
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,920
Now your intellect will start working

97
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,200
for the pursuit of the spirit.

98
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,040
This is what faith means.

99
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,520
Faith gives rise to pure intelligence.

100
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:22,920
Now, when you are seeing clouds removed to a great extent,

101
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,440
still there are clouds.

102
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,560
So you have to use the wind

103
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,160
to remove the clouds.

104
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,560
Wind of the Holy Ghost.

105
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,280
And that... you know,

106
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,640
there are many ways of taking advantage of the wind.

107
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,680
I hope the Italians understand.

108
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:40,840
So the wind comes from some other source,

109
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,920
that is the source of the Holy Ghost, your own Kundalini.

110
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:07,320
And also you have in person the Primordial Kundalini before you.

111
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,720
Compared to many other seekers who came before you,

112
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,400
I must say, you are very fortunate.

113
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,000
Because worshipping any vigraha,

114
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:48,000
any... even a statue of

115
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,320
self-created vibrations from the Mother Earth,

116
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,640
people had big problems.

117
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,920
They had to, first of all, do a meditation

118
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:21,280
which was called as Savikalpa Samadhi.

119
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,920
That means, in that state

120
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,600
you had to concentrate on such a statue, vigraha.

121
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:40,440
Vigraha means the one which is a vibrating statue.

122
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,280
And then, go on looking at that statue

123
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,240
and trying to raise your Kundalini.

124
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,920
And Kundalini used to come up to Agnya.

125
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:16,320
But the jumping beyond the Sahasrara was an impossible task,

126
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,080
because one had to go from form to formless,

127
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,880
and it was so difficult, to get out of form to formless.

128
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,000
And even to concentrate on abstract or formless

129
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,080
was another impossible task

130
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:57,160
as the Muslim did, or many other people tried to do.

131
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,520
Under these circumstances

132
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,680
it was necessary that the formless had to take a form,

133
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,880
so there was no more complication to you.

134
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:38,480
As soon as you concentrated on the form,

135
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,680
you became formless.

136
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,760
Like if you have ice before you,

137
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,240
and as soon as you start touching the ice, it melts away,

138
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,920
and you start feeling the cool.

139
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,800
So the problem is very easily solved now.

140
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,560
Puja is one of the things

141
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:26,600
by which you can excite the forms into formless.

142
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,560
Now, your centers are the centers of energies.

143
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:52,880
But they, too, have a guiding deity sitting on all these chakras.

144
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:04,680
They are also the formless made into forms.

145
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,360
And when you do the puja,

146
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,360
the forms melt into formless energy,

147
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,720
and this formless energy then starts flowing,

148
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,440
and that, then blows the wind.

149
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,240
And that's how this misidentification,

150
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,000
superimpositions on the spirit are removed.

151
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,920
Now, you cannot think about the puja.

152
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:13,320
The whole thing happens in a realm which is beyond thinking.

153
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,240
So, you have to understand

154
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,120
that you cannot rationalize the puja.

155
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,880
You should have the maximum advantage

156
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,160
on your chakras.

157
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:54,640
For that you must fully just concentrate on the puja

158
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,240
and how the wind is blowing.

159
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,080
And the wind will see to it,

160
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,600
that they drive out all the clouds.

161
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,760
So your only work is,

162
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,640
or your only method is —

163
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:31,320
just to concentrate on the puja, and witness.

164
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,480
You are a seer.

165
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,120
Seer has double meaning.

166
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,520
The one who sees only,

167
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,280
just sees,

168
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,880
and is only knowledge —

169
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,080
is a seer.

170
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,720
Without any thought, without any reaction,

171
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,200
just sees and absorb,

172
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,280
automatically, spontaneously —

173
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,600
is the seer.

174
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:32,480
And so, that is the best way to perform a puja.

175
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,080
For Me sometimes it's burdensome,

176
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:54,040
because there should be some parity between you and the deities.

177
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,720
Some balance must be there.

178
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:07,120
Here you are saying all the mantras and the deities are awakened,

179
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,840
and there you are,

180
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,080
who do not want to receive anything within your heart.

181
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,040
So I am the one who has to store up

182
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,800
all the extra energy that is produced in the body.

183
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,920
So it would be better if you all keep your hearts open

184
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,800
and watch the puja without thinking about it.

185
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,680
Today we'll reverse the method of puja.

186
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,680
First we'll do the havana and then the puja, will be better.

187
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:30,240
Because by that we'll evoke the fire element,

188
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,480
which burns away all the evils.

189
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,680
When you wash My feet, you do the same thing.

190
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,120
And even when you evoke the fire, you do the same thing.

191
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,520
So today first we'll have the havana

192
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,320
and then we'll have the puja.

193
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,520
Both are just the same.

194
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,320
You can worship Me with water or with fire.

195
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,840
The essence of fire is the glow, tejas.

196
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,120
All that is wrong, all that is evil is burned out,

197
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:46,800
and then the glow shows on the faces and the body of the seekers.

198
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,160
And also atmosphere is charged

199
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,760
with the beautiful vibrations

200
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,480
when you have the havana.

201
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,000
So I think best thing will be to do the havan first

202
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,600
and then the puja.

203
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,680
May God bless you all!

204
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,400
Of course always we have to praise Ganesha before starting any puja,

205
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,320
so you start praising Shri Ganesha.

206
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,400
SY: Mother, we have learned the Ganesha Atharva Shersha.

207
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,200
Atharva... Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha.

208
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,280
YOGI: Then we'll say [UNCLEAR] in French, or in English [UNCLEAR], as You like.

209
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,520
All right, say it in French.

210
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,320
Or better to translate it because there are other people.

211
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,920
First English and then French.

212
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,360
And first, Sanskrit we can say, Mother.

213
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,480
It's all right, I can understand English all right.

214
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,680
Is all mantras for Me to understand.

215
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,840
The holy mantras of Shri Mataji.

216
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,160
Beautiful. [UNCLEAR] beautiful.

217
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,160
It’s good.

218
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,560
All right. And now we'll be having the fire. It's all right.

219
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:18,560
Come along. You can look after the fire.

220
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,160
Let others see the fire.

221
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:41,520
SY: Mother, [first should] we recite Your names or names of Shri Vishnu?

222
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,640
SY: Vishnu, Vishnu’s names?SM: Yes, Vishnu’s names.

223
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,720
SY: 108 names of Vishnu?

224
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,480
SM: It would be better I think His names.Have you got 1000 names?

225
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,720
SY: Not, 108 names.

226
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,480
SY: 108. Mother is asking for 1000.

227
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,520
We have LalitaSahasranama.

228
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,200
SM: But who knows Sanskrit?It’s in Hindi?SY: It’s written in French.

229
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,440
SM: All right, then it’s all right.

230
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,360
SY: The vibrated coconut.

231
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,320
Now you put some water in it and [PUT?] it to all the people, now.

232
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:31,160
Today I would say that from France those who came to see Me,

233
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,360
from all these places,

234
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:40,560
one from each center should come forward.

235
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,800
One from Bretagne.

236
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,640
These are too big, I think.

237
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:35,040
You can put the bigger ones to make a triangle first, around it.
00:53:38:14 The bigger ones. Maria?

238
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,600
The triangle [ON] the three sides.

239
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:02,720
One on top of another, this be better.

240
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,600
Yes, it’s closer, yes, that’s why.

241
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,560
SY: Would You like some tea? Or… Mother, water. You don’t want water?

242
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,160
Yes, Mother.

243
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:19,560
[UNCLEAR]. Something like a...

244
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:25,080
[UNCLEAR] paper like a... thing, something lighter...

245
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,840
Is that the light thing?

246
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,000
And have you got camphor with you?

247
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Something lighter to be, underneath.

248
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,280
Do you have anything [UNCLEAR]?

249
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,640
Make it smaller, smaller. Yes.

250
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,040
Put it on top of this thing, not underneath.

251
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,440
Not underneath, put it on top. Covering this.

252
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,480
Yes, put these... on top.

253
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:05,360
Yes, like that, yes, that's the right thing.

254
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:22,880
You have to keep a hole in between.

255
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,600
Arrange it in such a way there is a hole in between, in the center.

256
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,840
Now arrange on top of this.

257
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:38,120
No, this is all right. Please cover with this thing.

258
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:03,360
I think there should be a platform first.

259
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,520
There should be a platform first — and then.

260
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,920
In the center there should be a platform.

261
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,600
Yes, make a platform there, yes, down here.

262
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,360
And on the platform,... just wait...

263
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:26,200
Marcus, on the platform you put another thing.

264
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,320
That's better, yeah.

265
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,840
Do you have some more with you?

266
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,440
[UNCLEAR]

267
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,640
To begin with that's sufficient.

268
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,880
SY: Mother we have Vishnu SahasranamaStotram and Shri Lalita.

269
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,200
SM: But it should be in Sanskrit.

270
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:24,920
SY: Now there is, also here it’s written in…

271
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,520
SM: You can read that. SY: Yes.

272
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,800
This is Vishnu’s names?

273
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:34,560
You'd like to do 108 names, would you?

274
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,360
What we do, we can do 108 of the Goddess

275
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,280
and 108 of Shri Vishnu, that's the best.

276
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,240
SY: All right, Mother. All right.

277
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,240
SM: And one from Paris also.

278
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,560
A new person.

279
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:05,200
SY: Patrice, Patrice is from Paris.

280
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,160
SM: Children, please... Keep the children outside.

281
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:45,000
Mother, we read the 108 names translated in French in the form of a poem.

282
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,960
Now, can you put something for Me there?

283
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,640
SY: You want to sit here, on the chair?

284
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,800
SM: Some chair.

285
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,880
Vanessa you come here. You come and sit here,this side.

286
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,560
You come this side. All the children can sit next to Me.

287
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:56,480
Shall we say the mantra for the fire, Mother?

288
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,680
We have to say together Shri Agni Devata, who is the Devi...

289
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,560
Be careful about it. Don’t be too near. Little far away.

290
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,960
Now say the mantra.

291
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,840
Shri Agni Devata who is a Devi,

292
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,360
the aspect of fire in Shri Mataji.

293
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,800
Shri SwahaSwamini who is a principle of...

294
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:01,080
which consumes everything. Swa-ha.

295
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,600
It’s moving in all the directions.

296
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,480
SM: I don’t know. How? What is the...? SY: SwahaSwamini.

297
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,840
Swa-ha. Swaha is the quality of the... of the fire

298
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,440
Now, after every name that he takes

299
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,480
you have to take the thing from your hand like this,

300
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:47,720
and take it round to the right side and put it in the fire.

301
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,360
But those who haven't got these things in the hand

302
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,440
should take up just their hand like that,

303
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,920
thinking that they have it in their hand,

304
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:03,200
and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire.

305
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,480
And you all should say "Swaha".

306
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,760
Now, just a minute. After every name, after every name.

307
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,520
SY: The 108 names of Shri Vishnu. Yes, Mother, it’s all right?

308
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,920
SM: First the Devi. SY: First the Devi.

309
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:18,880
Now we'll do the Vishnu Sahasranama, hundred and eight.

310
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:23,480
Again you distribute the [nuclear], distribute it.

311
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:45,920
What’s the time now?

312
01:18:46,120 --> 01:18:49,360
SY: The time? It’s 2o’clock.

313
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:57,160
We have only to be at6.30 here to[entice] later on.

314
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,880
But You don’t need to be there as early. We can arrive before you and give a practical session to the people.

315
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:17,120
SM: You see these people who want to meet are always[barking], always.

316
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:20,320
SY: Yes, that’s true.SM: One fellow has got back pain.

317
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,040
SY: Yes, that thing like that. SM: He’s the only one who had.

318
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,920
You bring the oil and all that and you can massage him.

319
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,760
SY: Yes, all right. We’ll give him a treatment.

320
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,120
No problem. I think we can manage.

321
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:46,680
Some people can go there and give them a practical session Mother.

322
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,840
how to meditate in Sahaja Yoga, how to work on themselves...

323
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:53,440
SM: So I said, 21 names of Vishnu are sufficient..

324
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:56,120
SY: It’s all right, Mother. O.k.

325
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:49,760
Now the... first you [UNCLEAR] this, finish it [INAUDIBLE].

326
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,040
For that you have to use some sort of a fruit.

327
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,080
Last thing. Do you have something?

328
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:59,040
What is the special fruit of France?

329
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,840
YOGI: The special fruit of France? Apples!

330
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,560
SHRI MATAJI: Apples, or you should have...

331
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:07,560
YOGI: Stem berries... cherries, cherries and grape, grape, Mother!

332
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:10,520
SHRI MATAJI: Grape is the best.

333
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:11,400
YOGI: [UNCLEAR] just to bless it, Mother.

334
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:15,360
SY: Just to bless it, Mother. SM: That’s the reason.

335
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:46,680
SHRI MATAJI: So now, this is the ultimate puja we have done now.

336
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,480
SM: You bring it here, bring it here.

337
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:56,040
This is the end of the puja, is finished, throw all that in there.

338
01:24:56,240 --> 01:25:00,120
All the... all the remaining things are to be thrown.

339
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,920
Yes, put it.

340
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,400
Now, we have put today the grapes in it.

341
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:33,800
That means the grapes will loose their capacity to ferment.

342
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:56,560
That's the best.

343
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,800
It's a big wind blowing!

344
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:12,800
So let’s then have our lunch and do the Puja inside as outside it’s very cold.

345
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,040
The main thing [UNCLEAR].

346
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:37,840
[UNCLEAR] [Hindi].

347
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,120
YOGI: Mother, the dinner is not ready... the lunch is not ready.

348
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,200
SHRI MATAJI: Not ready, is it?
