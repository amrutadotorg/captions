00:00:05.653 --> 00:00:10.453
As I have told many people before
and here also I perhaps maybe,

00:00:11.013 --> 00:00:15.653
that there is a soul that is

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:19.573
made out of the causal bodies

00:00:20.293 --> 00:00:24.253
of all the five elements.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:29.613
The causal, say for example,
of the earth is fragrance.

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:31.573
So this

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.973
soul which is made of the five causal bodies

00:00:38.053 --> 00:00:40.293
and your centers,

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:45.933
plus we can say, also

00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:53.973
it has got the control over the parasympathetic,

00:00:56.013 --> 00:01:03.013
it sits on the spinal cord from outside

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:07.653
and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:12.653
So it has a connection with every center.

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:18.093
Now this is the soul when we die,

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:27.333
with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky

00:01:27.413 --> 00:01:31.213
and it is the soul that guides now

00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:35.773
the movement of our being, whatever is left now

00:01:35.853 --> 00:01:38.586
into a new being and that's how it works out.
