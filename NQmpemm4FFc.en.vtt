00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:21.672
Yesterday I told you

00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:24.830
how 'Self' is more important

00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:26.925
than anything else

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:29.715
at the present state of human awareness

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:33.257
When you are at the human awareness

00:00:33.257 --> 00:00:35.337
first thing that should happen to you

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:38.297
is to feel your 'Self'.

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:40.211
As Shri Krishna has said,

00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:43.211
"Atmane atmane thushtaha."

00:00:43.223 --> 00:00:47.110
Unless and until you reach your Atma, your Spirit,

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.400
you are not going to get the satisfaction

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.930
of achieving anything.

00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:58.698
Because Kundalini, which you see here

00:00:58.707 --> 00:01:04.368
seated in the triangular bone

00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:09.668
which we call as the sacrum

00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:12.178
that means, Greek knew about it.

00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:15.402
Greek knew about the sacrum bone.

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:20.172
Otherwise they would not have called it as sacrum, means sacred.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.409
Even when I went to Athens I was surprised

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.819
that Athena, the word 'Atha' comes from Sanskrit,

00:01:26.807 --> 00:01:30.999
means primordial. And she had a snake like thing

00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:33.799
in Her hand with all the chakras.

00:01:33.782 --> 00:01:36.165
So the Greeks knew about it.

00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:37.536
And when I talked to them

00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:40.367
they told Me, that it is a fact.

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.527
that Indians came much before Alexander.

00:01:43.527 --> 00:01:44.887
We had a rapport with Indians

00:01:44.886 --> 00:01:46.832
much before Alexander

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:50.073
and they told us about the Primordial Mother

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:51.749
and Her three powers.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.743
It is very amazing how they knew all about it.

00:01:54.746 --> 00:02:01.896
And then it all got lost because of the extroversion,

00:02:01.892 --> 00:02:09.102
a moving out from reality.

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:13.591
So this bone, sacrum bone contains

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:21.161
or here resides the Kundalini in three and a half coil

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:25.870
This is the power of our pure desire.

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:30.569
The pure desire is the desire, when it is manifested

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:33.280
should give you full satisfaction.

00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:37.130
For example, some people seek it in power.

00:02:37.163 --> 00:02:38.753
They indulge in power.

00:02:38.753 --> 00:02:40.713
Some seek it in possessions.

00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:44.019
Some seek it in other things.

00:02:44.022 --> 00:02:49.389
But all these seekings do not give them satisfaction

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.357
If they could give satisfaction

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:57.587
then there would have been no problem.

00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:01.612
Because once you buy a car then you want to buy something else

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.109
and then you buy…want to buy something else.

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.282
You start moving from one to another and as Economics says

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:11.401
that in particular a want is satiable

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.318
but not in general.

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.339
So we have to understand, that the wants

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.489
that we have, the desires we have,

00:03:17.483 --> 00:03:21.335
are not pure desires, but are impure desires

00:03:21.337 --> 00:03:23.229
and when we deal with them,

00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:25.448
we never get that satisfaction.

00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:28.474
For example somebody wants to do something

00:03:28.492 --> 00:03:31.738
he does it but doesn’t get any satisfaction out of it.

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:34.462
The only way you can get satisfaction is

00:03:34.452 --> 00:03:38.542
that you become one with the Divine.

00:03:38.562 --> 00:03:43.414
And this power of desire which is a pure desire is

00:03:43.404 --> 00:03:47.134
residing in each and everybody’s triangular bone.

00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:48.614
But we are lost.

00:03:48.614 --> 00:03:51.114
We are seeking our pleasures,

00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:53.671
our joys into wrong things

00:03:53.658 --> 00:03:57.123
We think that by doing this or by doing that,

00:03:57.123 --> 00:03:59.623
by buying this or becoming that

00:03:59.623 --> 00:04:02.600
we will be completely, fully satisfied,

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:05.096
which we ultimately discover.

00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:07.036
In a evolutionary stage

00:04:07.036 --> 00:04:09.220
such people when they discover

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.720
that the joy is not in all these things;

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:14.446
there is no happiness in this kind of thing;

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.030
we have to go beyond this.

00:04:16.026 --> 00:04:18.300
Once they discover this then they become

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.450
a special category of people.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.950
And these special categories of people

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.670
are the seekers.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.900
Of course today I find so many seekers are lost.

00:04:28.895 --> 00:04:31.395
Especially in America they are lost in various ways.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.930
We would say in all the cults,

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:39.504
or in all other things like drugs, or homosexuality

00:04:39.525 --> 00:04:42.658
or whatever you may call it, they are lost into these.

00:04:42.682 --> 00:04:45.668
Into violence, many are indulging into violence.

00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:47.396
Or doing all kinds of things

00:04:47.401 --> 00:04:50.396
which are not for their ascent,

00:04:50.396 --> 00:04:53.816
but are degrading and will take them down

00:04:53.816 --> 00:04:56.446
not to their seeking, but to their hell.

00:04:56.443 --> 00:04:58.324
But it is happening today.

00:04:58.331 --> 00:04:59.663
You can see it very clearly.

00:04:59.663 --> 00:05:00.781
It is happening

00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:04.671
because human beings do not understand

00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:08.339
that human awareness is a transitory phase,

00:05:08.331 --> 00:05:10.361
you have to go beyond it.

00:05:10.371 --> 00:05:13.121
And that beyond stage, the stage we have to reach

00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:15.562
is the stage of your 'Self'.

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:16.832
To begin with

00:05:16.832 --> 00:05:19.629
you have to become first of all 'Self Realised'.

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:22.276
Meaning you are to be 'Born Again'.

00:05:22.272 --> 00:05:23.823
And to be born again

00:05:23.828 --> 00:05:27.993
you have to allow the Kundalini to work it out.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.898
So what do we do as people said,

00:05:30.886 --> 00:05:33.608
I told you yesterday, it is effortless.

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:35.806
It is without any money.

00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:38.811
It just happens spontaneously.

00:05:38.811 --> 00:05:40.156
Now it happens that

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:43.116
an enlightened light can enlighten another light.

00:05:43.098 --> 00:05:44.876
In the same way

00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:46.556
I may be able to enlighten you

00:05:46.528 --> 00:05:48.766
but you can enlighten many others.

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:50.428
Like in India we have someone

00:05:50.418 --> 00:05:53.338
who has enlightened 10,000 people.

00:05:53.338 --> 00:05:55.388
and has done so much good to people,

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.368
that it is amazing.

00:05:57.368 --> 00:06:00.850
Even there are people like the President of India,

00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:05.160
we can say the President of the High Court

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.207
Judge of the Hague High Court

00:06:08.207 --> 00:06:09.537
which is the World High Court,

00:06:09.537 --> 00:06:10.538
The president of that,

00:06:10.538 --> 00:06:11.667
He's got his Realisation

00:06:11.697 --> 00:06:13.267
and he's a Sahaja Yogi

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.606
So we have people of that calibre

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.096
who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:17.096 --> 00:06:18.876
and who have felt the vibrations

00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:20.416
who have become Self Realised.

00:06:20.414 --> 00:06:24.366
But they are very humble people, extremely humble people.

00:06:24.391 --> 00:06:27.441
Indians are basically humble and they know

00:06:27.441 --> 00:06:29.671
who is a saint and who is not a saint.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.994
They are so sensitive that they know

00:06:31.991 --> 00:06:33.974
who is a saint and who is not a saint.

00:06:33.974 --> 00:06:38.284
But in the West, as we have now lost our power

00:06:38.284 --> 00:06:40.634
to feel the saintliness in a person

00:06:40.613 --> 00:06:43.936
we do not know who is a saint, who is not a saint.

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:49.283
So the first thing that has to happen to you to understand who is a saint, who is not a saint,

00:06:49.298 --> 00:06:52.878
is first to get your Realisation.

00:06:52.898 --> 00:06:56.736
Without the spirit expressing itself

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.746
into your awareness, into your attention,

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:03.646
you cannot make out who is a saint, or who is not a saint.

00:07:03.655 --> 00:07:06.566
Like they crucified Christ for no reason at all

00:07:06.568 --> 00:07:10.533
and they worshipped Hitler.

00:07:10.524 --> 00:07:13.503
The Jews, they refused to accept Christ,

00:07:13.504 --> 00:07:16.783
they refused. They said, no we don’t accept Christ,

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.693
because Christ said that I am dying for your sins.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:26.679
They said, no we don’t believe in that. We must suffer. So they suffered.

00:07:26.702 --> 00:07:30.460
They had sufferings.  If you ask for suffering you’ll have sufferings.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.852
But if they had accepted Christ

00:07:31.852 --> 00:07:33.630
at least one thing would have happened

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:36.080
they would not have suffered.

00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:41.473
They asked for suffering. They thought unless and until we suffer we cannot go to God.

00:07:41.483 --> 00:07:44.591
This was a very wrong idea.  Because Christ himself was a Jew.

00:07:44.588 --> 00:07:47.452
Himself He took birth among the Jews.

00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:49.826
And it was the Jews He came to save.

00:07:49.826 --> 00:07:54.116
But they are the ones who refused to accept Him,

00:07:54.103 --> 00:07:58.742
because they were blinded. They didn't want to see the point.

00:07:58.732 --> 00:08:02.229
In the same way it has happened in every century.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.319
Anytime any incarnation came people did not want to accept.

00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:10.739
Not in India, I would say. Indians are much more sensitive to spirituality,

00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:12.724
because they are not so much materialistic.

00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:19.609
They understand, because we have been for ages seeking and seeking from… traditionally

00:08:19.609 --> 00:08:22.109
So we know what this seeking is.

00:08:22.085 --> 00:08:25.744
What it means.  For Me it’s not difficult to talk to them about Kundalini.

00:08:25.732 --> 00:08:27.829
There I start on a different level altogether,

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:32.309
because they know everything whatever I’m talking, they know already, what it is.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:36.799
May be not in the cities where the people are westernised. But they know.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.270
But for other people I have to start it from A to Z.

00:08:39.436 --> 00:08:47.203
So this is the Kundalini. We have got it. Three and a half coils, and it has a mathematical calculation.

00:08:47.228 --> 00:08:54.033
Now it’s only Indians and Buddhists from Indians I would say believe in the non-being.

00:08:54.036 --> 00:08:56.963
They believe there’s a non-being; being and non-being.

00:08:56.973 --> 00:08:59.473
What is that state of non-being?

00:08:59.506 --> 00:09:06.484
When you become the non-being means when you go beyond your conditioning and ego then you become the non-being.

00:09:06.556 --> 00:09:10.896
And once you become the non-being then nothing can touch you.

00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:17.262
As I told you yesterday…who are standing in the water have fear of getting drowned in the water,

00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:26.613
but if you go to the boat then you start seeing that the water is down below it is not going to touch you.

00:09:26.622 --> 00:09:31.773
That state has to be achieved, is the non-being, is the fourth dimension within us.

00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:36.013
This is called also in Sanskrit as Turya dasha.

00:09:36.022 --> 00:09:39.516
Now you might say why in India, these people discovered all that.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.126
See now the reason is India is a very ancient country.

00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:48.375
And there we didn’t have these problems that you had to face when you came to America.

00:09:48.381 --> 00:09:52.065
You had to face the nature to begin with. Our nature is very kind.

00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:57.304
You can live under a tree, eat the fruits of the forest and can enjoy ourselves.

00:09:57.315 --> 00:10:03.987
We don’t need much in that country to cover ourselves or to have any elaboration.

00:10:03.995 --> 00:10:08.855
So the attention has been always inside to find out why are we here?

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:11.875
What are we doing here?  Are we wasting our life?

00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:14.955
Are we doing any harm to ourselves or to others?

00:10:14.953 --> 00:10:20.500
Is it alright to exist as human beings or is there anything beyond?

00:10:20.517 --> 00:10:24.420
This search has been there for thousands and thousands of years.

00:10:24.431 --> 00:10:27.311
And because of this seeking

00:10:27.316 --> 00:10:30.459
they have been able to reach, right conclusions

00:10:30.486 --> 00:10:33.509
that there is this Kundalini within us.

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:36.092
And this Kundalini is to be awakened.

00:10:36.092 --> 00:10:37.609
And if She is awakened

00:10:37.608 --> 00:10:41.869
then you can become 'Self' very easily.

00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:45.419
And this was the job I had to do.

00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:47.919
For that I had to work very hard

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:49.719
for days together to understand

00:10:49.704 --> 00:10:52.009
what was the problem with human beings,

00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:53.739
the permutations and combinations

00:10:53.739 --> 00:10:56.549
of problems that they had.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.691
And somehow I managed it, I think.

00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:02.616
Now en masse Realisation is possible.

00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:05.651
Yesterday despite some people being mischievous

00:11:05.645 --> 00:11:06.907
you did get Realisation.

00:11:06.915 --> 00:11:08.307
This is God's work

00:11:08.307 --> 00:11:10.587
and God's work will go on.

00:11:10.615 --> 00:11:12.457
Whether some people come and trouble you,

00:11:12.444 --> 00:11:13.494
makes no difference.

00:11:13.492 --> 00:11:15.734
They are just like mosquitoes.

00:11:15.726 --> 00:11:19.444
They come and go away, has no meaning at all.

00:11:19.444 --> 00:11:21.944
Because you see God’s work is much greater

00:11:21.944 --> 00:11:24.404
than what they think of themselves.

00:11:24.402 --> 00:11:26.902
So it doesn't matter what happens

00:11:26.902 --> 00:11:29.133
or what people say or talk.

00:11:29.142 --> 00:11:30.793
The God's work will go on

00:11:30.793 --> 00:11:32.857
But you must know it is a living work.

00:11:32.853 --> 00:11:34.703
It's not a plastic thing.

00:11:34.703 --> 00:11:37.203
You can produce thousands of plastic flowers

00:11:37.203 --> 00:11:38.471
very easily,

00:11:38.482 --> 00:11:41.982
but you cannot produce one single living flower.

00:11:42.016 --> 00:11:45.742
So when this living force has to act it takes time.

00:11:45.782 --> 00:11:48.282
And it will take time, gradually it will grow.

00:11:48.282 --> 00:11:49.820
And you'll be surprised that

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.434
gradually it will grow so beautifully,

00:11:52.434 --> 00:11:53.500
that suddenly you'll find

00:11:53.518 --> 00:11:57.650
lots of people coming up and becoming.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.720
Because in Sahaja Yoga

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.750
what you become is important.

00:12:00.755 --> 00:12:02.385
It’s the actualisation.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.795
It is not some certificate or some organisation

00:12:05.795 --> 00:12:07.810
that you belong to some organisation

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.555
or there is some certificate.

00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:12.045
But it is what you become.

00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:14.545
Your becoming is important

00:12:14.545 --> 00:12:16.373
If you cannot become something

00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:18.633
the you are no good in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:18.633 --> 00:12:19.923
Many people who come to us

00:12:19.923 --> 00:12:22.453
we find they improve a lot

00:12:22.457 --> 00:12:24.608
and they become very great also.

00:12:24.614 --> 00:12:26.238
But some people do not.

00:12:26.249 --> 00:12:27.668
They just waste it.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:30.164
Energy is all wasted whatever you try they do not.

00:12:30.164 --> 00:12:32.664
Sometimes they are so conditioned

00:12:32.664 --> 00:12:34.619
that we cannot improve them.

00:12:34.624 --> 00:12:36.874
There we feel helpless about them

00:12:36.876 --> 00:12:39.214
because they do not want to corporate also.

00:12:39.214 --> 00:12:41.714
And also they have many pressures on them.

00:12:41.686 --> 00:12:45.544
But 90% people go up very well

00:12:45.524 --> 00:12:49.014
and they manifest whatever they have achieved

00:12:49.014 --> 00:12:52.284
Now the main thing is to understand

00:12:52.284 --> 00:12:55.514
that this mechanism exists with us.

00:12:55.504 --> 00:12:58.004
This energy exists within us.

00:12:58.004 --> 00:13:01.614
Now this is like a hypothesis for you.

00:13:01.642 --> 00:13:04.243
You need not accept it. It’s a hypothesis

00:13:04.243 --> 00:13:06.416
as one would put to a scientist.

00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:08.909
But scientist must have an open…open mind.

00:13:08.909 --> 00:13:10.399
They shouldn’t have a closed mind.

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:11.449
if you have a barrier

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:14.059
you cannot put anything before them.

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.559
If they are scientist they will have an open mind

00:13:16.539 --> 00:13:18.499
to listen to My hypothesis.

00:13:18.493 --> 00:13:22.779
And if it could be proved, if it could be proved

00:13:22.761 --> 00:13:25.261
then you have to accept it.

00:13:25.261 --> 00:13:26.502
If it is...  doesn't prove,

00:13:26.502 --> 00:13:29.482
then you can say all right that's not proved so far.

00:13:29.482 --> 00:13:30.312
All right!

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:32.799
So you have to wait and have patience with it.

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:35.992
This is what it is in simple words

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:38.499
that I cannot be forced on you.

00:13:38.499 --> 00:13:43.153
It cannot be humbled before you.

00:13:43.153 --> 00:13:45.653
You have to ask for it.

00:13:45.653 --> 00:13:48.473
Nobody can force you that you can become.

00:13:48.477 --> 00:13:50.977
I cannot guarantee yesterday I said. It's a fact.

00:13:50.977 --> 00:13:53.817
But still so many people got their realisation,

00:13:53.817 --> 00:13:56.327
felt the cool breeze and felt the cool

00:13:56.327 --> 00:13:57.407
breeze out of the head.

00:13:57.402 --> 00:13:59.797
This you cannot do otherwise.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.300
All other things you can do but this you cannot do,

00:14:02.338 --> 00:14:04.838
is to take out cool breeze of your head

00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:07.768
which is a factual thing and experienced.

00:14:07.768 --> 00:14:10.488
But as I told you, that we live mentally

00:14:10.488 --> 00:14:13.288
much more than we live with reality.

00:14:13.288 --> 00:14:15.233
And mental projection can be anything

00:14:15.215 --> 00:14:16.865
like a person who murders someone.

00:14:16.868 --> 00:14:18.225
He has justification,

00:14:18.225 --> 00:14:20.725
I murdered someone because of this and this,

00:14:20.725 --> 00:14:22.179
but that justification

00:14:22.184 --> 00:14:24.189
does not allow you to get out of law.

00:14:24.194 --> 00:14:25.995
Does it? No.

00:14:25.995 --> 00:14:28.495
You will be caught in the law. You cannot do it.

00:14:28.495 --> 00:14:30.595
Whatever is wrong you are not supposed to do it?

00:14:30.595 --> 00:14:32.225
But that is human law.

00:14:32.214 --> 00:14:34.155
In the same way there is God’s laws.

00:14:34.155 --> 00:14:36.574
And it you go against God's laws

00:14:36.574 --> 00:14:37.544
then what happens

00:14:37.552 --> 00:14:39.380
is that we are punished.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.290
Now today I am going to tell you

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.820
about other awareness that one can have.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.845
That one should know about.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.859
I am talking about the super-consciousness

00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:50.719
which is on top of our head.

00:14:50.719 --> 00:14:53.041
But when the attention moves

00:14:53.075 --> 00:14:55.071
to the left side too much

00:14:55.082 --> 00:14:57.582
or to the right side too much

00:14:57.582 --> 00:15:01.525
then also there could be a very, very big problem.

00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:06.164
And the big problem can come because

00:15:06.165 --> 00:15:10.544
we are not knowledgeable about it

00:15:10.544 --> 00:15:13.044
We do not know. What is unknown

00:15:13.044 --> 00:15:15.544
need not be Divine. Not at all.

00:15:15.544 --> 00:15:18.474
Now when you start say

00:15:18.494 --> 00:15:23.554
becoming extremely submissive,

00:15:23.531 --> 00:15:29.883
slavish or you start following something vey blindly,

00:15:29.883 --> 00:15:33.204
you start becoming fanatic about it.

00:15:33.213 --> 00:15:34.834
Just without thinking

00:15:34.834 --> 00:15:38.354
what you are doing is not right or wrong

00:15:38.364 --> 00:15:40.864
you just follow something like that.

00:15:40.877 --> 00:15:43.832
We call it the left side movement of the attention starts

00:15:43.832 --> 00:15:47.961
where you start subduing yourself to something.

00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:50.461
Subjecting yourself to something.

00:15:50.463 --> 00:15:52.963
Accept the slavery of some ideas.

00:15:52.963 --> 00:15:59.993
Accept the conditioning of some sort of theories.

00:15:59.973 --> 00:16:03.693
Now once you start accepting such theories mentally

00:16:03.693 --> 00:16:06.193
the attention starts moving towards the left side.

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:10.926
And also some people have a capacity to posses you like that.

00:16:10.956 --> 00:16:13.906
They can posses you and can do like that, that you

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:17.806
lose your freedom and you become that kind of a person.

00:16:17.806 --> 00:16:21.566
Then at that time what happens that you start moving

00:16:21.566 --> 00:16:24.266
from your conscious mind to the subconscious mind

00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:26.766
and then to the collective subconscious.

00:16:26.766 --> 00:16:30.363
If you move to collective subconscious

00:16:30.362 --> 00:16:32.353
then what happens to you.

00:16:32.348 --> 00:16:34.473
If you move to the collective subconscious

00:16:34.473 --> 00:16:40.883
then a person becomes possessed.

00:16:40.893 --> 00:16:44.863
This possession comes to you through what we call

00:16:44.863 --> 00:16:50.943
the protein 52 or protein 58 in medical terminology.

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:55.323
They say that if a person is vulnerable to cancer

00:16:55.323 --> 00:17:03.705
it is triggered by the presence or entrance of protein 52 or protein 58.

00:17:03.698 --> 00:17:08.584
These are the names the doctors are given which trigger the disease

00:17:08.584 --> 00:17:14.554
and once that happens then a person cannot get out of cancer

00:17:14.552 --> 00:17:17.052
Because then the triggering starts

00:17:17.043 --> 00:17:21.682
and he starts getting from bad to worse.

00:17:21.691 --> 00:17:26.832
This 52 and 58, where do you find it?

00:17:26.832 --> 00:17:34.527
According to doctors you find 52 and 58 in the area

00:17:34.527 --> 00:17:39.242
which is built within us since our creation.

00:17:39.253 --> 00:17:41.467
This area is placed within us

00:17:41.442 --> 00:17:43.942
on the left-hand side, as you can see. Somebody can come and show.

00:17:43.942 --> 00:17:47.514
On the left hand side this area is placed.

00:17:47.526 --> 00:17:51.824
And this area one enters very easily.

00:17:51.823 --> 00:17:54.184
Say you go on taking somebody’s name.

00:17:54.187 --> 00:17:57.414
Now a days it is a fashion to give you a mantra.

00:17:57.417 --> 00:18:00.901
Now start getting mantras, going on saying mantras, mantras, mantras.

00:18:00.902 --> 00:18:04.901
Now what happens that you are not connected with the Divine.

00:18:04.898 --> 00:18:08.071
And you start taking the name of some ‘x','y','z.’

00:18:08.089 --> 00:18:10.805
So you are not connected

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:16.112
and you are just pressing hard your mind to get connected.

00:18:16.106 --> 00:18:18.606
But it cannot because the Kundalini has not arisen

00:18:18.606 --> 00:18:20.744
so you move to the left side.

00:18:20.736 --> 00:18:22.644
And there you get caught up,

00:18:22.662 --> 00:18:26.258
and that’s why you know in the cult people are so much mesmerised.

00:18:26.258 --> 00:18:29.022
In every cult people get mesmerised

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.438
because they move to the left

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.548
for the domination of these gurus and things.

00:18:34.562 --> 00:18:37.062
Because they want to make money out of them.

00:18:37.068 --> 00:18:40.189
And then they cannot think of anything else.

00:18:40.173 --> 00:18:42.389
They just think this is the right thing.

00:18:42.399 --> 00:18:45.203
I was amazed that some of the cults

00:18:45.203 --> 00:18:47.703
the gurus don’t know even Sanskrit language.

00:18:47.703 --> 00:18:49.849
Some of them have come out of the jail

00:18:49.846 --> 00:18:51.399
and they have become gurus

00:18:51.419 --> 00:18:54.685
And they have give mantras which are so funny.

00:18:54.692 --> 00:18:57.192
That somebody has been given mantra of Inga.

00:18:57.192 --> 00:18:59.165
There is no word like Inga,

00:18:59.165 --> 00:19:03.712
except for this word in a colloquial way is called inga

00:19:03.706 --> 00:19:08.986
when a spider or something,

00:19:08.986 --> 00:19:16.876
you can say, a scorpion has got the sting that is called as inga.

00:19:16.869 --> 00:19:22.860
And this scorpion, when this scorpion hits it

00:19:22.855 --> 00:19:26.060
to a person is called as the inga;

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.193
means that biting.

00:19:29.206 --> 00:19:31.985
Now that’s the mantra given to many people, I was shocked

00:19:31.985 --> 00:19:36.044
and it was told not to tell anyone about it.

00:19:36.057 --> 00:19:38.557
So if you tell to anyone, he will just start laughing

00:19:38.557 --> 00:19:40.429
and rolling with laughter.

00:19:40.427 --> 00:19:42.927
Another mantra I heard was 'thinga';

00:19:42.927 --> 00:19:45.787
meaning when you show someone like this is thinga.

00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:48.457
In colloquial word, not in Sanskrit language!

00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:51.607
There is nothing like a gerund ‘ing’ in Sanskrit language.

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:53.955
It has no meaning.

00:19:53.956 --> 00:19:56.456
And everything is meaningful in Sanskrit.

00:19:56.456 --> 00:20:00.166
Even every syllable is meaningful.

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:02.499
So such people have come over

00:20:02.486 --> 00:20:04.459
and have become great gurus.

00:20:04.459 --> 00:20:05.916
And they give you names.

00:20:05.936 --> 00:20:09.896
May be the names of some proteins which exists

00:20:09.915 --> 00:20:13.236
and which enter into you and you get possessed.

00:20:13.232 --> 00:20:16.466
So this left-side movement is a very common thing.

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:18.872
And once you get to this left-side movement

00:20:18.888 --> 00:20:20.492
you cannot get out of it.

00:20:20.484 --> 00:20:21.469
It's very difficult,

00:20:21.466 --> 00:20:24.629
so the people who have been to such people

00:20:24.644 --> 00:20:27.834
or to such enticement

00:20:27.836 --> 00:20:32.191
show immediately when they come to us for realisation

00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:34.679
and that we don’t know how to deal with them.

00:20:34.679 --> 00:20:35.879
Because if you tell them,

00:20:35.879 --> 00:20:37.419
"You forget your guru." They don't like it.

00:20:37.401 --> 00:20:42.984
They go on contortions, their bodies start getting into contortions.

00:20:42.997 --> 00:20:45.071
They feel terrible. They cannot sit quiet.

00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:46.741
They cannot move up.

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:49.246
But if you tell them that this was wrong,

00:20:49.246 --> 00:20:52.636
they don’t want to accept because they are still carrying on with that idea.

00:20:52.624 --> 00:20:54.296
And they don’t want to believe

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:56.466
that whatever they were carrying on was wrong.

00:20:56.476 --> 00:20:58.136
That they have to ascend.

00:20:58.146 --> 00:21:01.256
Even when they ascend they take time.

00:21:01.243 --> 00:21:03.743
This is one very big problem we face.

00:21:03.743 --> 00:21:07.119
But as a result of the left side movement

00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:09.829
you get most of the incurable diseases,

00:21:09.829 --> 00:21:12.719
For example your AIDS disease that has come

00:21:12.719 --> 00:21:17.280
is because of the combination of the left side Mooladhara Centre

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:23.099
and heart…is that…that’s the one.

00:21:23.086 --> 00:21:26.399
Of course it has to have Swadisthana with it, left Swadisthan.

00:21:26.399 --> 00:21:28.899
Is due to that.

00:21:28.899 --> 00:21:32.283
If somebody could cure these three centres of that person,

00:21:32.296 --> 00:21:34.796
that person can be cured.

00:21:34.796 --> 00:21:36.693
Sclerosis comes from the same.

00:21:36.693 --> 00:21:40.836
If somebody is suffering from multiple sclerosis, same problem

00:21:40.829 --> 00:21:43.329
that it comes Mooladhara Chakra, Void

00:21:43.329 --> 00:21:48.066
and also sometimes the Right Heart.

00:21:48.091 --> 00:21:51.931
Sclerosis! Most of the muscular troubles go like that.

00:21:51.931 --> 00:21:53.951
Then we have got cancer.

00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:57.233
Cancer could be due to any chakra

00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.801
which is on the left hand side.

00:21:58.801 --> 00:22:01.031
Must be the combination of two chakras

00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:02.051
on the left hand side

00:22:02.042 --> 00:22:05.722
depending on where the trouble is.

00:22:05.722 --> 00:22:10.742
But when the cancer trouble comes into the centre

00:22:10.742 --> 00:22:12.602
then it starts ascending.

00:22:12.602 --> 00:22:15.672
Then it starts moving and you get galloping cancer.

00:22:15.658 --> 00:22:17.988
You can start going from one to another end

00:22:17.988 --> 00:22:20.488
and it can finish off a person.

00:22:20.488 --> 00:22:26.938
That's how you can just be finished with a galloping cancer.

00:22:26.938 --> 00:22:30.028
Now when somebody is vulnerable like I would say

00:22:30.017 --> 00:22:33.008
a person who is a very, very active person

00:22:33.008 --> 00:22:35.508
who is very much under shock all the time,

00:22:35.487 --> 00:22:40.020
is very, very active and hectic, supposing he is a…

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:42.250
getting up in the morning, reading newspaper

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:48.217
and getting up into his bath and then getting ready somehow or other

00:22:48.222 --> 00:22:49.914
and getting into his car

00:22:49.936 --> 00:22:52.624
and then going out in a very hectic manner

00:22:52.626 --> 00:22:55.126
he lives under shock

00:22:55.126 --> 00:22:59.476
because he is reading horrible news, then he is seeing a big jam on the street

00:22:59.493 --> 00:23:02.386
and all this things are happening, he is so full of anxieties,

00:23:02.376 --> 00:23:06.026
such a person is venerable to another thing called blood cancer.

00:23:06.056 --> 00:23:11.766
But for that also the Left Nabhi, this centre, is attacked.

00:23:11.766 --> 00:23:15.306
If Left Nabhi is attacked under these circumstances

00:23:15.317 --> 00:23:19.297
such a person can get blood cancer.

00:23:19.297 --> 00:23:22.617
Supposing your mother is like that, she's a very hectic person

00:23:22.617 --> 00:23:29.570
and she is trying to sort of do many things at the same time

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:34.687
and she is of that nature then also the child can pick up trauma.

00:23:34.687 --> 00:23:40.510
If a mother is a very extreme type of a person or has gone through shocks like that…

00:23:40.512 --> 00:23:44.447
I have seen people who have gone through wars and have come out of problems.

00:23:44.447 --> 00:23:49.669
Their children also are very prone to troubles of the brain.

00:23:49.647 --> 00:23:53.259
And they also get it because of the left side movement.

00:23:53.267 --> 00:23:59.655
But as you go upward, as the chakras come upward on the left hand side, say the Left Agnya is caught up

00:23:59.655 --> 00:24:03.307
and Left Swadisthana is caught up, that means the person is completely possessed.

00:24:03.287 --> 00:24:10.087
But with that if the Heart Chakra is caught up or with that if the Vishuddhi Chakra is caught up

00:24:10.087 --> 00:24:13.687
then one can become mad and such people could be there

00:24:13.687 --> 00:24:21.167
But they become mad, they become alright, then become mad, like that you go on and ultimately they end up as mad people.

00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:28.724
But in Sahaja Yoga one can cure people who are mad but they have to be treated in a way.

00:24:28.737 --> 00:24:36.736
Normally we do not take up any person who is a mad person in our yoga because it is very difficult to cure them and better them.

00:24:36.758 --> 00:24:40.726
But if they want to work it out on themselves we say all right work it out this way.

00:24:40.734 --> 00:24:42.293
Try if you can be alright

00:24:42.296 --> 00:24:52.426
But there are many in between phases like schizophrenic you can call it, or some people who are imbalanced, who are nervous, all kinds of things are in between.

00:24:52.426 --> 00:24:59.204
So absolutely mad even if you forget, but there are so many others who look sane, but inside they have problems.

00:24:59.209 --> 00:25:08.607
All such people can be cured with Sahaja Yoga, if they act according to what we tell them and the way it is to be worked on.

00:25:08.626 --> 00:25:14.437
Now in Sahaja Yoga the practices are extremely simple because it’s question of balance.

00:25:14.445 --> 00:25:18.637
The left side catches…if the left side catches then you get all these problems.

00:25:18.637 --> 00:25:24.963
But if you can balance it, if you can balance left side with the right side, the troubles can be all right.

00:25:24.963 --> 00:25:36.820
For example, if you have got say a left side problem and you do some right side activity of ego development, you will be amazed that your cancer can be cured.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.147
But then you go to the right side.

00:25:39.123 --> 00:25:43.257
That means you become ego oriented. You become extremely ambitious.

00:25:43.287 --> 00:25:46.327
You become futuristic. You start dominating others.

00:25:46.327 --> 00:25:49.427
And this is what was practiced by Hitler.

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:54.631
He got this knowledge from Dalai Lama. He said it in his book that he got it from Dalai Lama

00:25:54.658 --> 00:26:01.990
How to control the minds of the people by which you dominate them and by domination what do you make out of them?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.190
Devils!

00:26:03.243 --> 00:26:05.086
And that’s what he did it,

00:26:05.116 --> 00:26:08.616
because they become so ambitious, they become racist to begin with

00:26:08.616 --> 00:26:15.486
They become racist. They think they are the best. They are the highest. They have the right to kill anybody they feel like.

00:26:15.516 --> 00:26:19.536
They have the right to take revenge. They have a right to ill treat people

00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:23.646
All kinds of funny ideas come into their heads, these right sided people.

00:26:23.646 --> 00:26:27.536
And when they come into the right side they do not know what they are up to,

00:26:27.536 --> 00:26:31.506
because once they develop the right side. then they have other troubles.

00:26:31.506 --> 00:26:37.946
Like they might develop blood pressure, they might develop kidney troubles, they might develop heart trouble.

00:26:37.946 --> 00:26:43.298
Heart in the sense, not angina and all not a lethargic heart, but overactive heart,

00:26:43.298 --> 00:26:48.658
they can get a sudden, massive, heart attack and they may die with it.

00:26:48.658 --> 00:26:53.101
So such people are also suffering from all kinds of liver trouble

00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:54.968
 Like cirrhosis of the liver.

00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:58.368
Liver…other liver troubles, skin troubles, skin problems,

00:26:58.369 --> 00:27:01.059
all these come from the right side movement.

00:27:01.059 --> 00:27:04.319
So when you start moving to the right side too much,

00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:08.559
you can be possessed by people who are overactive.

00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:11.059
Like a ego oriented person if he bcomes

00:27:11.059 --> 00:27:12.999
friendly with another egoistical person

00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:16.029
both of them combined together in such a manner

00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:20.440
that they form a group of egoistical nature.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:21.969
When they become egoistical

00:27:21.969 --> 00:27:25.419
they try to dominate and a big group can form

00:27:25.433 --> 00:27:32.203
a frantic, horrible, violent group which can try to kill.

00:27:32.214 --> 00:27:35.923
In India we had one such group which was formed,

00:27:35.923 --> 00:27:38.423
under the name of the Goddess they started it.

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.923
In India they all are called as Anand Marg.

00:27:40.923 --> 00:27:42.345
Of course it is now banned.

00:27:42.374 --> 00:27:44.605
The fellow is under supervision,

00:27:44.606 --> 00:27:48.155
but still in America he has followers.

00:27:48.135 --> 00:27:49.366
Surprisingly!

00:27:49.366 --> 00:27:50.610
they were caught killing

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:54.206
some ambassadors and all that.

00:27:54.216 --> 00:27:55.616
And the leader

00:27:55.616 --> 00:27:57.896
had to go in the jail for days together.

00:27:57.882 --> 00:27:59.420
Everything happened but the followers,

00:27:59.412 --> 00:28:00.860
because they are so possessed

00:28:00.863 --> 00:28:02.852
with the idea that they are in charge

00:28:02.845 --> 00:28:05.345
and they have to kill everyone and that they have

00:28:05.345 --> 00:28:07.613
to become like Hitler.

00:28:07.645 --> 00:28:09.713
Now you cannot stop it.

00:28:09.724 --> 00:28:11.803
It’s very difficult, but you can

00:28:11.803 --> 00:28:13.583
if you can raise their Kundalini

00:28:13.583 --> 00:28:16.083
then they will understand this is not reality.

00:28:16.083 --> 00:28:18.793
We are just doing something that is not reality.

00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:21.299
Is not for our beneficiary…

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:24.506
beneficiary or…neither for anybody else.

00:28:24.506 --> 00:28:26.033
It is such a dangerous thing

00:28:26.052 --> 00:28:27.292
we are doing to ourselves.

00:28:27.292 --> 00:28:29.792
It is not at all benevolent to ourselves

00:28:29.781 --> 00:28:31.332
or to anybody else.

00:28:31.332 --> 00:28:33.012
So the benevolence only comes

00:28:33.012 --> 00:28:34.402
when you move upward.

00:28:34.444 --> 00:28:40.694
The third we can say is the awareness of hell

00:28:40.694 --> 00:28:43.066
where people are really devilish by nature

00:28:43.065 --> 00:28:44.335
You cannot change them.

00:28:44.335 --> 00:28:47.155
They are very devil.. devil like,

00:28:47.155 --> 00:28:49.145
very possessive type,

00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:52.185
extremely arrogant, aggressive,

00:28:52.195 --> 00:28:54.352
and they are really devils incarnate

00:28:54.354 --> 00:28:55.052
in human forms.

00:28:55.052 --> 00:28:57.594
And such people have to go to hell,

00:28:57.582 --> 00:28:59.412
because we call them as

00:28:59.419 --> 00:29:00.959
the awareness of the hell.

00:29:00.959 --> 00:29:02.879
They always think of destruction,

00:29:02.856 --> 00:29:04.249
of destroying others,

00:29:04.249 --> 00:29:05.989
of overpowering others

00:29:05.972 --> 00:29:07.969
or of destroying themselves.

00:29:07.969 --> 00:29:09.242
There are many bhoots you know

00:29:09.242 --> 00:29:10.462
who destroyed themselves.

00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:12.448
Just like that they killed themselves.

00:29:12.448 --> 00:29:13.808
These are all the people

00:29:13.818 --> 00:29:17.578
who are on the other side of the ascent.

00:29:17.578 --> 00:29:20.388
So when you start rising higher and higher

00:29:20.388 --> 00:29:22.030
due to these chakras,

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.298
and when the Kundalini rises

00:29:23.298 --> 00:29:24.568
through all these chakras

00:29:24.568 --> 00:29:29.438
and goes up beyond the Sahasrara,

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.280
as you call it the Brahmarandra, here,

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.130
you become a subtler being.

00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:36.520
Like your human attention say, we can say is like cloth here

00:29:36.527 --> 00:29:38.620
And now the Kundalini is pushing it upward,

00:29:38.607 --> 00:29:39.680
upward, like that

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.180
So all your attention which is outside goes inside.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:45.780
And when it pierces through from here,

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.700
this piercing makes the attention subtle

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:56.060
because the subtle that is around which you do not feel normally starts penetrating into it.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.436
It starts covering your attention.

00:29:58.430 --> 00:30:01.786
And that’s how we say now your attention is enlightened.

00:30:01.796 --> 00:30:08.796
And now it is enlightened. Not just talk but it becomes enlightened with collective consciousness.

00:30:08.796 --> 00:30:12.236
You become collectively conscious.

00:30:12.226 --> 00:30:21.721
Then such people when they talk, when they talk have such a personality, such a knowledge.

00:30:21.741 --> 00:30:24.412
They become knowledge. They have no problems.

00:30:24.412 --> 00:30:28.286
They become knowledge because they become the absolute knowledge.

00:30:28.298 --> 00:30:32.126
But it is for you to decide. What are you seeking in life?

00:30:32.126 --> 00:30:35.898
What do you want in life?  What is your life worth?

00:30:35.916 --> 00:30:42.766
If you want to cheapen your life, waste it for something very cheap and ordinary and useless then you can go ahead.

00:30:42.793 --> 00:30:45.993
But if you think your life is important as a human being, it should be,

00:30:46.023 --> 00:30:51.343
because you have become from amoeba to this stage as human being not to waste it.

00:30:51.368 --> 00:30:55.896
Not to throw it away, uselessly, but to become the Spirit.

00:30:55.896 --> 00:30:58.396
That is what you have come on this Earth for

00:30:58.396 --> 00:31:01.218
and that's what should happen to you.

00:31:01.218 --> 00:31:05.077
Now the main problem with human beings is

00:31:05.101 --> 00:31:07.007
that there are barriers we have got.

00:31:07.007 --> 00:31:12.161
To accept anything we have barriers. But there is nothing to be accepted.

00:31:12.163 --> 00:31:16.117
In Sahaja yoga you need not accept anything what so ever but you should also not deny.

00:31:16.117 --> 00:31:20.269
If you deny I cannot raise your Kundalini. I cannot.

00:31:20.267 --> 00:31:24.809
You should allow your mind to be open to get realised.

00:31:24.809 --> 00:31:26.807
Because one reason is there,

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:28.344
why you have to do that more,

00:31:28.336 --> 00:31:30.716
because you do not know about Kundalini

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.516
People told Me they don’t even know what Self Realisation is.

00:31:33.517 --> 00:31:37.597
Imagine in India when My grandchild was born

00:31:37.597 --> 00:31:42.547
we had our astrologer in My husband’s place,

00:31:42.571 --> 00:31:45.397
about two thousand miles away

00:31:45.397 --> 00:31:47.128
from where the child was born.

00:31:47.128 --> 00:31:48.644
He sent a telegram saying that

00:31:48.644 --> 00:31:51.301
this child has found her guru,

00:31:51.298 --> 00:31:53.218
sadguru in the household.

00:31:53.218 --> 00:31:55.718
It was such a great thing to find a sadguru

00:31:55.718 --> 00:31:58.728
who will give realisation to the child.

00:31:58.738 --> 00:32:01.238
To us it is the most important thing.

00:32:01.238 --> 00:32:03.738
In a horoscope the first thing they’ll ask,

00:32:03.738 --> 00:32:06.138
"Will, shall we get Self Realisation

00:32:06.138 --> 00:32:07.448
in this life time or not?"

00:32:07.448 --> 00:32:09.436
Then they will say, "All right,

00:32:09.436 --> 00:32:11.008
this life left, time be mine.

00:32:11.032 --> 00:32:13.527
May be next lifetime.” Then they’ll think, “Oh God,

00:32:13.527 --> 00:32:17.907
we have to wait one life time more."

00:32:17.907 --> 00:32:20.987
And all the action is surrounding that.

00:32:20.987 --> 00:32:22.037
The whole behaviour

00:32:22.067 --> 00:32:24.817
that you must try to check your attention.

00:32:24.827 --> 00:32:27.917
Chitta nirodh, try to check your attention.

00:32:27.927 --> 00:32:30.216
Wherever it wants to go just keep it out.

00:32:30.207 --> 00:32:34.426
While here it is, “What’s wrong?" "So what?”

00:32:34.436 --> 00:32:36.936
If you want you jump in the sea. "So what?"

00:32:36.936 --> 00:32:38.896
"Who are you to tell us?"

00:32:38.896 --> 00:32:39.856
It is not that.

00:32:39.856 --> 00:32:42.566
There it is, you must control your attention.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:45.950
Control your attention! Keep the attention pure!

00:32:45.972 --> 00:32:49.360
If your attention is not pure at the time of Realisation

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.860
there will be a problem

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.990
It is just a different attitude towards life in India.

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:56.483
If somebody is angry

00:32:56.483 --> 00:32:59.033
here people always say. "I hate you."

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:01.170
I mean in India if a child says like that

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:03.670
he will have two slaps on the face.

00:33:03.666 --> 00:33:05.428
Its regarded bad manners to

00:33:05.448 --> 00:33:07.638
even to think like that, that you hate anyone

00:33:07.636 --> 00:33:14.288
To hate anyone is a sign of degraded personality.

00:33:14.308 --> 00:33:16.808
I mean it’s very common with Indian people.

00:33:16.808 --> 00:33:18.968
Whatever you know of Indians are the people

00:33:18.968 --> 00:33:19.888
who are uprooted,

00:33:19.888 --> 00:33:21.478
who have come here to make dollars.

00:33:21.468 --> 00:33:23.028
They are different people.

00:33:23.028 --> 00:33:25.008
They are sort of sieved out.

00:33:25.028 --> 00:33:27.098
But the people who are in India,

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.118
now we have here

00:33:28.111 --> 00:33:31.168
at least 20% people who have been to India.

00:33:31.188 --> 00:33:33.258
You can ask them.

00:33:33.264 --> 00:33:38.935
To them generosity is a quality.

00:33:38.935 --> 00:33:40.484
Righteousness is a quality.

00:33:40.488 --> 00:33:43.838
Purity is a quality. Quietude is a quality.

00:33:43.838 --> 00:33:45.958
Peaceful nature is a quality.

00:33:45.978 --> 00:33:47.938
They do not boast of their angers

00:33:47.948 --> 00:33:49.948
and they do not boast of their hatred at all.

00:33:49.926 --> 00:33:53.227
I mean it is never, never, never done.

00:33:53.221 --> 00:33:55.481
Even if somebody hates he will

00:33:55.496 --> 00:33:58.551
not say that, "I hate you."

00:33:58.547 --> 00:34:00.287
I mean it took some time for Me

00:34:00.283 --> 00:34:02.783
to even say this sentence to people

00:34:02.787 --> 00:34:06.069
like it is something prohibited.

00:34:06.067 --> 00:34:09.529
Because it's your tongue gets spoiled.

00:34:09.527 --> 00:34:12.027
If your tongue is spoiled and is impure

00:34:12.027 --> 00:34:16.637
then whatever you say becomes untruth.

00:34:16.627 --> 00:34:19.127
Your tongue must be pure.

00:34:19.127 --> 00:34:22.457
You should not say something which is not true.

00:34:22.457 --> 00:34:24.957
In the sense, true doesn't mean that

00:34:24.957 --> 00:34:27.457
supposing somebody is a person,

00:34:27.443 --> 00:34:29.943
who to your mind is not a good person.

00:34:29.943 --> 00:34:32.894
You shouldn’t say that. Need not say that

00:34:32.894 --> 00:34:35.394
you are not a good person. You just keep quiet.

00:34:35.393 --> 00:34:36.253
Let him discover,

00:34:36.253 --> 00:34:41.513
because if he is bad, he will suffer himself.

00:34:41.514 --> 00:34:43.843
This is a common attitude.

00:34:43.844 --> 00:34:45.283
I am not talking for Indians,

00:34:45.293 --> 00:34:47.493
but I must say for Spiritual life,

00:34:47.483 --> 00:34:49.653
one has to learn from them.

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:51.576
Some of them who were thugs

00:34:51.584 --> 00:34:54.084
must have come here to loot you. That's a different point.

00:34:54.084 --> 00:34:56.896
I mean I am sorry for that. I am sorry.

00:34:56.896 --> 00:34:59.776
But I also blame you for your naiveness.

00:34:59.776 --> 00:35:02.276
I came much before that. But I said

00:35:02.276 --> 00:35:03.996
you are not to pay to anyone any money.

00:35:04.007 --> 00:35:06.507
Nobody listened to Me. They didn't like me

00:35:06.507 --> 00:35:08.857
at all, when I said that.

00:35:08.857 --> 00:35:11.357
So you had to suffer.

00:35:11.335 --> 00:35:14.086
I know it was wrong, but it happened.

00:35:14.086 --> 00:35:17.482
Now at least people should realise

00:35:17.494 --> 00:35:22.497
that purity can only be achieved

00:35:22.514 --> 00:35:24.437
through Self Realisation.

00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:26.767
Innocence can be awakened within you

00:35:26.767 --> 00:35:29.027
on the first chakra.

00:35:29.017 --> 00:35:31.887
On the first chakra you develop innocence.

00:35:31.892 --> 00:35:34.942
In the second chakra you develop creativity.

00:35:34.938 --> 00:35:36.832
I’ve known people who never used to sing

00:35:36.832 --> 00:35:38.392
have started singing very well.

00:35:38.392 --> 00:35:39.872
Who never used to create anything

00:35:39.881 --> 00:35:42.672
have started creating beautiful paintings.

00:35:42.672 --> 00:35:47.292
They have become great painters now, very well known painters, musicians.

00:35:47.293 --> 00:35:56.479
Those who were never doing architecture have become great architects and who  have never done any interior decoration have achieved a lot.

00:35:56.479 --> 00:36:05.749
So, to say that we are very creative one must know that you have limited energy and for that you have to be connected to the mains.

00:36:05.749 --> 00:36:08.249
So, all the time the energy is flowing into you.

00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:14.849
Then on top of that is the third centre, which is the centre of your seeking.

00:36:14.842 --> 00:36:19.669
So whatever you were seeking was not alright.

00:36:19.642 --> 00:36:23.049
But you do get your material well being. No doubt.

00:36:23.049 --> 00:36:29.322
You do get your material well being but up to a point where you feel absolutely satisfied about it.

00:36:29.323 --> 00:36:31.823
You don’t need anything anymore.

00:36:31.823 --> 00:36:39.003
You also get a great blessing of dignity and divinity.

00:36:39.021 --> 00:36:44.483
You get a proper understanding of your being. You become like a king.

00:36:44.483 --> 00:36:49.901
For a king what we call the emperor, he doesn’t need anything.

00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:56.913
For example as you know I am born of a very rich family and it’s a royal family and My husband also is a very rich man.

00:36:56.912 --> 00:37:03.163
It’s alright, we live in a very great comfort no doubt. But I can sleep anywhere. I can sleep on the street,

00:37:03.163 --> 00:37:05.663
I can live anywhere. I am not bothered where I live,

00:37:05.663 --> 00:37:09.533
what I do, how I move. I have no problem.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.543
Because if you are the emperor,

00:37:13.543 --> 00:37:15.593
you don't ask for anything. Do you?

00:37:15.593 --> 00:37:19.411
If you get the food, alright, if you don't, alright.

00:37:19.413 --> 00:37:22.293
If you like some food, or don’t like food

00:37:22.283 --> 00:37:24.783
somebody says, I have said, “I don’t know what I ate in the morning.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:26.763
I don’t know what I am going to eat now.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.270
I don’t know if I had my lunch or not.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.210
If I've had, all right.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.710
Otherwise you can do what you like.

00:37:32.697 --> 00:37:35.197
It’s that simple. Your body becomes your slave.

00:37:35.197 --> 00:37:37.697
You can lie down anywhere you feel like.

00:37:37.697 --> 00:37:39.447
You can do any amount of travelling.

00:37:39.467 --> 00:37:42.847
You can do thousand and one things.

00:37:42.847 --> 00:37:45.347
You become so dynamic.

00:37:45.347 --> 00:37:49.066
That happens when your Lakshmi Tattwa is arisen.

00:37:49.066 --> 00:37:51.566
There are four Lakshmi Tattwas within us.

00:37:51.566 --> 00:37:53.636
The first is the Lakshmi Tattwa,

00:37:53.628 --> 00:37:57.546
where you become a person very dignified

00:37:57.536 --> 00:38:02.266
and endowed with material comforts.

00:38:02.286 --> 00:38:04.786
But comfort which kill you is not there.

00:38:04.786 --> 00:38:08.741
Comfort means you are materially no more bothered.

00:38:08.721 --> 00:38:12.161
You get jobs. In London we have so many jobless people.

00:38:12.161 --> 00:38:14.661
But in Sahaja yoga all those who are there,

00:38:14.661 --> 00:38:17.593
all of them have got jobs.  All of them!

00:38:17.593 --> 00:38:20.771
It's difficult to find one person who hasn’t got the job.

00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:24.171
Moreover it is compulsory in Sahaja yoga that those who stay in the ashram

00:38:24.195 --> 00:38:26.161
must have some jobs.

00:38:26.175 --> 00:38:28.675
We have tried to allow some people to come without that

00:38:28.675 --> 00:38:32.081
but we had very bad experiences of such people.

00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:35.871
So all those who are living on dole or some sort of a thing,

00:38:35.873 --> 00:38:37.721
we don’t allow them to come in the ashram.

00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:42.713
And you will be surprised that as soon as they join Sahaja Yoga they get jobs.

00:38:42.711 --> 00:38:45.211
They get better and better jobs

00:38:45.211 --> 00:38:49.181
because Krishna has said, "Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:53.221
"When you get your yoga, your well being will be looked after."

00:38:53.241 --> 00:38:55.741
He didn’t say, "Kshema yoga," he didn’t say

00:38:55.741 --> 00:38:58.551
"I’ll look after your well being and then you go to yoga."

00:38:58.554 --> 00:39:01.671
No! First yoga. "Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

00:39:01.671 --> 00:39:04.171
"First you get the yoga and then the kshema will work out."

00:39:04.171 --> 00:39:07.721
That’s what happens to you on the Nabhi Chakra,

00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:11.171
which is very important. But Raja Lakshmi that is

00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:13.221
you become like a king.

00:39:13.241 --> 00:39:16.131
That you become Gruha Lakshmi or Gruhastha

00:39:16.131 --> 00:39:18.186
means you become a house holder.

00:39:18.221 --> 00:39:20.721
You become a good wife and a good husband.

00:39:20.721 --> 00:39:24.166
You develop proper feelings for each other.

00:39:24.166 --> 00:39:26.666
And you develop proper feelings for your children.

00:39:26.666 --> 00:39:29.686
You improve your societies through that essence

00:39:29.686 --> 00:39:35.516
if it is born in you that you understand the importance of a good family life.

00:39:35.516 --> 00:39:39.546
And that automatically happens. You don’t have to tell anybody.

00:39:39.546 --> 00:39:44.406
Just those people who hated each other after coming to Sahaja yoga

00:39:44.403 --> 00:39:46.216
have started loving each other,

00:39:46.216 --> 00:39:48.406
understanding and enjoying each other.

00:39:48.416 --> 00:39:50.916
And married life in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous.

00:39:50.916 --> 00:39:56.926
Ninety percent of married life is so great that people in America

00:39:56.926 --> 00:39:59.426
where they divorce third year, every third year,

00:39:59.406 --> 00:40:03.106
we have seen people are doing very well in the married life

00:40:03.106 --> 00:40:05.404
even in America.

00:40:09.893 --> 00:40:12.393
Even here the…you see this mental projection,

00:40:12.393 --> 00:40:15.113
the wife is no good, the husband no good, all vanishes.

00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:17.613
You become the Spirit. You start enjoying

00:40:17.613 --> 00:40:22.373
the deeper significance of marriage.

00:40:22.363 --> 00:40:26.253
Then comes the fourth side of the Lakshmi Tattwa

00:40:26.253 --> 00:40:31.521
Is the fourth side is the ascending side.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:35.504
The people who have got more money are fed up

00:40:35.482 --> 00:40:38.104
and now want to have something beyond.

00:40:38.112 --> 00:40:43.094
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga, when you start moving

00:40:43.099 --> 00:40:47.933
then you find that nothing but spiritual life gives you real joy

00:40:47.943 --> 00:40:52.013
So you just don’t care for anything else but the spiritual life.

00:40:52.013 --> 00:40:54.513
And what is the spiritual life of Sahaja Yoga is

00:40:54.513 --> 00:40:55.963
that you become the light

00:40:55.963 --> 00:40:57.775
and you give light to others.

00:40:57.766 --> 00:41:01.593
Selflessly, there is no selfish motive in it.

00:41:01.593 --> 00:41:03.145
Just because you are the light,

00:41:03.124 --> 00:41:04.302
you become the light,

00:41:04.284 --> 00:41:06.622
You don't see the light, you become the light.

00:41:06.614 --> 00:41:10.382
And you give light to others and just do it selflessly,

00:41:10.414 --> 00:41:12.232
without charging any money.

00:41:12.232 --> 00:41:13.672
Without asking for anything

00:41:13.672 --> 00:41:17.512
you just start giving what you have got.

00:41:17.502 --> 00:41:20.662
Spontaneously without paying for it

00:41:20.646 --> 00:41:24.882
You just do it in a way that is a saintly way.

00:41:24.904 --> 00:41:28.130
Saints always spend their own money,

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.394
always have spent their own money

00:41:30.418 --> 00:41:32.511
to give joy to others.

00:41:32.502 --> 00:41:34.300
They have never taken money from anyone.

00:41:34.313 --> 00:41:35.991
I mean I have not heard of any saint

00:41:35.967 --> 00:41:38.467
who has built up big palaces

00:41:38.479 --> 00:41:40.979
and big places and big organisation, never.

00:41:40.979 --> 00:41:43.161
That's not a sign of a saint.

00:41:43.173 --> 00:41:48.443
A saint just emits compassion

00:41:48.443 --> 00:41:52.613
and this compassion doesn’t speak. It is silent.

00:41:52.613 --> 00:41:55.303
This compassion acts.

00:41:55.302 --> 00:41:57.802
It doesn’t speak. It acts.

00:41:57.802 --> 00:42:01.662
When it acts it works out wonders.

00:42:01.662 --> 00:42:03.682
That's what you know when Christ

00:42:03.682 --> 00:42:05.192
was touched by some lady

00:42:05.176 --> 00:42:08.701
he said, "Some energy has flown through Me."

00:42:08.701 --> 00:42:09.992
That is what it is.

00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:12.489
That the energy starts flowing through you

00:42:12.489 --> 00:42:14.020
and you do not do anything

00:42:14.054 --> 00:42:15.710
just happens automatically.

00:42:15.691 --> 00:42:18.191
Without doing anything you achieve it.

00:42:18.191 --> 00:42:19.581
So for today

00:42:19.581 --> 00:42:22.491
I think I have come up to the Nabhi Chakra.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:24.990
tomorrow I'll tell you about other chakras

00:42:25.028 --> 00:42:31.190
in better, elaborate way

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.592
that you will understand

00:42:32.591 --> 00:42:34.982
what is the essence of these chakras.

00:42:34.984 --> 00:42:36.901
That what becomes of you.

00:42:36.901 --> 00:42:38.724
They have described to you the chakras

00:42:38.724 --> 00:42:40.161
but why these chakras.

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:41.501
What do they mean?

00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:42.384
These are the different,

00:42:42.386 --> 00:42:45.214
evolutionary milestones within us,

00:42:45.201 --> 00:42:48.037
which have been crossed and the last one

00:42:48.035 --> 00:42:50.908
is this one, which you have to cross now. That's all.

00:42:50.917 --> 00:42:52.978
See you are just ready for it.

00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:55.948
You are made for this. God has made you for this.

00:42:55.948 --> 00:42:59.128
Its best is that you get to it.

00:42:59.128 --> 00:43:03.158
And that’s why I was yesterday asking questions

00:43:03.148 --> 00:43:04.168
and people have now told Me,

00:43:04.168 --> 00:43:06.668
“Mother please don’t ask questions because it is a waste

00:43:06.668 --> 00:43:08.458
it’s a waste of time.”

00:43:08.458 --> 00:43:10.728
Those people who are asking questions

00:43:10.728 --> 00:43:12.568
are not asking any sensible questions.

00:43:12.568 --> 00:43:14.048
They are not bothered about themselves

00:43:14.058 --> 00:43:16.042
why, how they are spending their lives.

00:43:16.042 --> 00:43:16.688
of course some people

00:43:16.682 --> 00:43:18.528
asked very sensible questions also

00:43:18.538 --> 00:43:21.038
I must say, but there’s no need to ask questions.

00:43:21.048 --> 00:43:23.138
Let us see if it works out within in you.

00:43:23.138 --> 00:43:26.058
If it works out it will be a good idea.

00:43:26.058 --> 00:43:32.410
Now you want to have Realisation first?
