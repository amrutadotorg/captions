00:08.684 --> 00:18.360
Now, the ascent of the Kundalini when it takes
place, the seat of the Spirit is on top of your

00:18.360 --> 00:27.137
head and that’s why you get your enlightenment
when the Kundalini touches the seat of the Spirit.

00:27.137 --> 00:31.964
It’s the seat or called as pita in
Sanskrit language, is called pith.

00:32.040 --> 00:38.554
As a result of this happening, the first thing you
feel is the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:38.640 --> 00:42.512
You also start feeling the
cool breeze all around you

00:42.512 --> 00:48.214
because this is the All-pervading
Power of God which is formless.

00:48.420 --> 00:52.151
When you start feeling that
energy for the first time,

00:52.151 --> 00:56.590
then you have to know what it is,
how to use it, how to work it out.

00:57.060 --> 01:03.660
The- another meaning of the word “yoga”, also
means “yukti”, means the deepness, deepness,

01:03.660 --> 01:11.100
how to you use the All-pervading Power
of God, how to decode, how to manifest.

01:11.470 --> 01:18.190
Now the nature of the Spirit is that,
when it comes into your attention,

01:18.190 --> 01:22.338
first of all, your brain gets
enlightened with the truth.

01:22.500 --> 01:29.040
That is, you go to a person and
he says he is a very great guru,

01:29.040 --> 01:33.960
you don’t know whether he is a real
or not, you cannot make it out.

01:33.960 --> 01:42.360
But because you have got these cool vibrations,
you can feel the cool vibrations from a Sat Guru

01:42.360 --> 01:46.184
and from a bad one you might
even get some blisters.
