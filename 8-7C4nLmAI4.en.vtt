00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:18.360
Now, the ascent of the Kundalini when it takes&nbsp;
place, the seat of the Spirit is on top of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:27.137
head and that’s why you get your enlightenment&nbsp;
when the Kundalini touches the seat of the Spirit.

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:31.964
It’s the seat or called as pita in&nbsp;
Sanskrit language, is called pith.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.554
As a result of this happening, the first thing you&nbsp;
feel is the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.512
You also start feeling the&nbsp;
cool breeze all around you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.512 --> 00:00:48.214
because this is the All-pervading&nbsp;
Power of God which is formless.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.151
When you start feeling that&nbsp;
energy for the first time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:56.590
then you have to know what it is,&nbsp;
how to use it, how to work it out.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.660
The- another meaning of the word “yoga”, also&nbsp;
means “yukti”, means the deepness, deepness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.100
how to you use the All-pervading Power&nbsp;
of God, how to decode, how to manifest.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.190
Now the nature of the Spirit is that,&nbsp;
when it comes into your attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.338
first of all, your brain gets&nbsp;
enlightened with the truth.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.040
That is, you go to a person and&nbsp;
he says he is a very great guru,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.960
you don’t know whether he is a real&nbsp;
or not, you cannot make it out.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.360
But because you have got these cool vibrations,&nbsp;
you can feel the cool vibrations from a Sat Guru&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.184
and from a bad one you might&nbsp;
even get some blisters.
