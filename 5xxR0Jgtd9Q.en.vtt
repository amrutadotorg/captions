00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:21.030
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Krishna’s incarnation.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:29.820
As you know that Shri Krishna is the incarnation
of Narayana, of Shri Vishnu.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:40.909
So in every incarnation they carry all their
qualities, all their powers and all their

00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:45.139
nature with them.

00:00:45.139 --> 00:01:00.209
So when He incarnated He had all the qualities
of Narayana and then that of Rama, but every

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:14.290
incarnation tries to rectify whatever in their
previous life has been misunderstood and have

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.060
been carried to the extremes.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:47.770
That’s why they have to come back again
and again.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:02:01.210
So as Shri Vishnu, when He thought of taking
His incarnation, because He is the one who

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.360
is the preserver.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:20.160
He’s the preserver of this creation and
also the preserver of dharma.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:31.650
So when He took His incarnation He had to
see that people keep to their dharma.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:42.100
By keeping the dharma all right only, you
could get your realization.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:51.420
So the job was quite difficult one, I should
say, to keep people in the central path of

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.750
Mahalakshmi.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:11.650
So by first incarnation, you can say that,
He tried to create a benevolent king, as Shri

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.650
Rama.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.620
Socrates has described a benevolent king.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.840
But as a result of that, people started thinking
if they have become queen and king, born in

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.140
the family of royalty, then they are gods.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:42.470
Shri Rama was the Purushottama – means He
was the best among all the human beings.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:51.330
That means He incarnated as a human being,
total human being, showing all the qualities

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.560
of human beings.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:07.890
Like He was, He married the Lakshmi principle
that was Sita, and then also He lived a normal

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.030
married life.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:19.120
When He gave Her up He lived like an ascetic
to show how a man should lead his life in

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.520
a proper dharma as a married man.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:33.350
And even when the wife has gone away, how
He was leading a life of complete chastity.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.740
And He never had another marriage, though
many people said that “You should have another

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.280
marriage."

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:54.520
So the system that was the best, to have a
monogamy, He followed it.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:03.770
By His life, He showed how a husband should
be with his wife.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.770
But then later on He had another role as the
king.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:16.460
When He became the king then He found out
that people were criticizing Him because He

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.310
brought Sita back from Ravana.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.700
So Shri Rama decided to send Her away from
Him.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:37.780
How many people in this world, who are in
power, would be that sensible about that power

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:46.070
that they have, that they have to behave in
a manner that they should be ideals, for all

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.850
other people who are working under them, for
the administration, for looking after the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.700
country?

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:06.140
But Sitaji also, because She was also Mahalakshmi,
She understood everything, the whole play,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:15.520
and She went away and then Shri Rama also
taught how to rule the people.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.990
So they say the most ideal kingdom was Ramaraj.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:31.050
When Rama ruled this world there was peace,
no competitions, everyone was joyous and happy

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:44.670
because He was the one who was emitting fair
play and dharma, joy, bliss and peace.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:52.529
So there was no need to have any struggle,
no competition, no fighting, nothing.

00:06:52.529 --> 00:07:02.290
So this Benevolent King came as a incarnation
to show us how a king should be, and He lead

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:11.690
a life of a serious type, very dedicated and
serious type of life, how a benevolent king

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:13.480
should be.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:23.880
As a result of His incarnation – always
people take to something, something which

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.260
is not normal.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:37.010
So because He lived as an ascetic people started
following asceticism.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:43.730
“We’ll not marry, we’ll not have our
wives, we’ll live like Rama,” all these

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.920
things they started, so asceticism grew up.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:55.390
Before that, before Shri Rama all the saints
used to marry, they used to have wives they

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.690
used to have children, they lived a very normal
life.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:07.980
Only they were saints because they were very
highly evolved people and they lived in ashrams

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:17.150
doing the work of realization and also other
corrections in human beings.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:26.680
Now when Shri Rama came, people thought that
“He was Shri Rama, so let us be like Him.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.350
Because He lived like an ascetic let us also
live like an ascetic."

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:42.159
So this foolish idea of asceticism crawled
in and then people became very austere type,

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.940
very austere.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:52.339
Nobody would laugh, nobody would smile, everything
was very serious, absolutely, and everything

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:57.169
was done in a very dry manner.

00:08:57.169 --> 00:09:05.260
So many seekers did not marry but apart from
seekers many seers and saints also did not

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:12.159
marry and because they had no balance, because
marriage gives you a balance, they became

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:20.109
very dry people, very hot tempered people,
and we have some examples of some rishis who

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:29.690
are known for their hot temper and their ascetic
qualities by which they could destroy anyone,

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.630
make them into ashes – in Sanskrit it’s
called as Bhasma Karoti.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:47.490
So these qualities developed, that is the
time Shri Krishna came back, from Shri Rama’s

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:51.400
incarnation He came back as Shri Krishna.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:10:04.169
Sri Krishna’s incarnation came to show that
this whole Creation is fun, is Leela.

00:10:04.169 --> 00:10:08.089
That’s why He’s Leeladhar, He’s called
as Leeladhara.

00:10:08.089 --> 00:10:14.789
He was the one who showed that everything
is fun, there’s nothing to be serious, nothing

00:10:14.789 --> 00:10:25.039
to be dry, nothing to be ascetic but the whole
life is a fun.

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:33.339
He gave this idea because people had become
so austere.

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:42.289
And then also a kind of a funny Brahminism
started, like they would not eat, they created

00:10:42.289 --> 00:10:45.280
a caste system which started developing.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:53.740
The caste was determined by birth, which was
wrong, and they could not eat food.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:11:00.250
Then the Brahminism started growing up, quite
strong, and these Brahmins started dominating

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.870
others.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:20.779
So Shri Krishna came and He came as a son
of a milkman (gwale ki ladke).

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:32.620
But they were rich milkmen, very rich milkmen.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:42.719
Now that is the time, you see, the whole play
was brought forth, and the play was quite

00:11:42.719 --> 00:11:57.479
cruel I should say, because one horrible devil,
rakshasa, somehow or other used a lady who

00:11:57.479 --> 00:12:10.759
was
mother of Kamsa, and she is the mother also

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:15.099
of, you can say grandmother of Shri Krishna.

00:12:15.099 --> 00:12:22.789
So she had a son who was also a rakshasa,
so it’s all a play of the same.

00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:32.599
So He had an uncle who was a devil, who was
a rakshasa and He was supposed to kill this

00:12:32.599 --> 00:12:38.510
uncle – see the play, this is a drama all,
just see the drama as it worked out.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:46.750
He was supposed to kill this uncle who was
very powerful and who was a devil.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:13:03.019
So in His childhood He used to play, He used
to play with milkmaids and with other ladies.

00:13:03.019 --> 00:13:06.839
He was very young, He was about five years
of age.

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:16.000
And He did all kinds of pranks and He did
all kinds of leelas, like He killed one snake,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.550
very big snake – a cobra – very well known
cobra.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:29.149
And also He killed many rakshasas and rakshasinis
with His power – in a play.

00:13:29.149 --> 00:13:36.880
Just in a play, He used to do it, and you
must have read the stories about Him – how

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:43.800
He showed that there is no need to have a
big army of people as Shri Rama had – He

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:52.709
didn’t use any monkeys or anyone, though
Hanumana was always, was sitting on His chariot.

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:57.320
But He never used all these outside powers.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:07.199
Only whatever He had the weapons that He used,
to show that there is no need to use any army

00:14:07.199 --> 00:14:15.019
or other people to kill a rakshasa.

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:19.479
And all was in a very playful manner.

00:14:19.479 --> 00:14:30.270
At the time of Shri Rama He was not supposed
to know that He was an incarnation but it

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:39.769
was reflected to Him by various methods that
He was an incarnation and still He would not

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:43.139
accept it because He was not supposed to know.

00:14:43.139 --> 00:14:48.529
It’s something like Mahamaya.

00:14:48.529 --> 00:15:01.191
But say all the cameras are now giving you
all the evidence of the real Mahamaya, what

00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:03.159
She is like.

00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:10.580
But one may try to show that you don’t remember,
you don’t have, you have no memory of it.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:17.560
Because if you remember it then your action
would not be human, they would become divine

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:24.279
actions, and that may be not all right for
human beings because they won’t be able

00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:31.370
to stand, or they’ll be frightened, they’ll
be such an awe.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:39.060
So Shri Krishna normally behaved like a very
ordinary person.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:46.269
Like in His childhood, He was very fond of
butter.

00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:48.899
And as you know butter is very good for the
throat.

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:54.529
For Vishuddhi I’ve told you many-a-times
that on your tea you put some butter and take

00:15:54.529 --> 00:15:59.819
it so that your throat which is dried out
will feel better.

00:15:59.819 --> 00:16:09.639
So He was very fond of butter and He would
go and make His friends help Him, and made

00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:16.729
a pyramid out of them, would climb up and
break the butter container and would eat all

00:16:16.729 --> 00:16:18.690
that butter like a little baby.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:23.099
So one day His mother said, “All right,
why did you eat butter?”

00:16:23.099 --> 00:16:24.450
He said, “I never ate."

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:26.409
She said, “Then what is this on your mouth?”

00:16:26.409 --> 00:16:30.060
He said, “This is, all these boys have put
it on my mouth."

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:35.529
You see, to Him, even telling such little,
little lies also was a fun, with the mother

00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:36.529
to that extent.

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:38.359
Like “don’t tell lies!

00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:39.359
You must not!”

00:16:39.359 --> 00:16:42.129
No, there was no fun in this kind of thing.

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:44.180
So He told her a lie.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.149
“See now, these people have put it on my
mouth.

00:16:47.149 --> 00:16:54.279
They have eaten all the butter and now I am
the one you are catching!” you see.

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:57.070
So she said, “Really?

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.359
Open your mouth!”

00:16:59.359 --> 00:17:06.029
So He opened His mouth and there She saw all
this [universe] (Mother points to the solar

00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:09.200
system which is part of the puja decoration
backdrop) in the mouth.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.180
The whole universe moving in the Vishuddhi,
the complete Vishuddhi chakra she saw, and

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.050
she just bowed to Him.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:22.470
Then He says, “Why are you bowing to Me?”
as if nothing has happened.

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:36.400
So, you see, all His pranks and all His childish,
sweet lies, were just to create a feeling

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:46.190
of understanding, and it’s regarded as something
very sweet, according to the Indians, or we

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:51.290
can say according to the eastern ideas, that
children are naughty like that with the mother.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:55.550
They all enjoy the naughtiness of the children,
little naughtiness here, naughtiness there.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:10.830
And the strictness of children to a great
extent, also is there because, I think, people

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:11.931
are not attached to their children.

00:18:11.931 --> 00:18:13.770
They don’t love their children.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:19.590
They love their carpets, love everything else
because they can sell it, but they can’t

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.129
sell their children.

00:18:22.129 --> 00:18:25.710
And that kills the joy.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:35.009
So the children and the parents are separated
by materialistic ideas that this material

00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:39.060
is more important than their own children.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.050
So in His childhood He has shown lots of pranks
and lot of things, and the way He used to

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:45.330
steal also.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.080
Now stealing is supposed to be bad.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.070
Some, belongs to somebody else, if you steal,
is bad.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:57.290
But He was stealing only the butter of His
mother that He had made them.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:03.729
And He used to steal the butter of all the
ladies who used to take down to Mathura, where

00:19:03.729 --> 00:19:11.220
Kamsa was ruling, and this butter was eaten
by all the rakshasas there and they were becoming

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:13.040
very powerful.

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:18.300
So He thought best thing is to go and eat
all the butter so that these ladies won’t

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.719
be able to go and sell it.

00:19:20.719 --> 00:19:29.310
Also if you see it significantly is this that
we starve our children, we starve our families,

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.070
just to have some money.

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:37.650
Money orientation is there, that you can go
and sell your butter to somebody.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:43.530
With this idea – everything to be sold out,
we have to sell out this, we have to sell

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.080
out that.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.020
Nothing is going to be kept with ourselves.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:57.440
So the children are the only permanent liabilities,
so the children are treated as if they are

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:02.719
just burdens while all other things are good
because you can sell it.

00:20:02.719 --> 00:20:08.820
So the whole value system, if it runs down
to money, then children have no place in the

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.610
family.

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:22.139
According to Sahaja Yoga, children are more
important than all the wealth of the world

00:20:22.139 --> 00:20:24.970
and they are to be looked after that way.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:30.389
Of course they should be told what is dignity
is, how to behave themselves.

00:20:30.389 --> 00:20:35.620
But their little, little pranks are to be
understood and enjoyed because only as children

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:41.940
they can do pranks, not as grown ups, so they
should have that much freedom to play pranks

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.089
and to play some tricks on you.

00:20:45.089 --> 00:20:52.160
Otherwise, they’ll become very serious people
and might become ascetic.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:58.960
Those parents who are very strict, their children
are never normal; they either are extremely

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:10.099
perverse, rebellious or they are quiet down
and they cannot face life.

00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:17.619
So both are of the same style because one
cannot face life another cannot be faced by

00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:18.619
life.

00:21:18.619 --> 00:21:19.619
It’s like this.

00:21:19.619 --> 00:21:20.880
Nobody can face such people.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:25.259
So you have to treat you children with great
love and understanding but they should know

00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:29.339
if they misbehave then this love will be finished.

00:21:29.339 --> 00:21:30.810
So children only care for love.

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.259
They don’t know money.

00:21:32.259 --> 00:21:33.710
They don’t know anything.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:39.670
So the love that is you establish in your
child becomes very precious thing.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:47.860
So the system of Sahaja Yoga is based on divine
love and it can only work when people are

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.860
loving.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:54.499
If they love money, if they love power, if
they love their reputation, they love this,

00:21:54.499 --> 00:22:01.629
love that, and not their own children or their
families then they are absolutely losing a

00:22:01.629 --> 00:22:08.589
very big part of the society and God knows
what’s going to happen to these children

00:22:08.589 --> 00:22:09.910
if you do not have love for your children.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:16.240
In Shri Krishna’s life, you can see various
things He has shown.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:26.450
In His, you can say in His epic or in His
biography if you see, you will find how many

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:31.490
facets of life He has handled with such beauty.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:40.599
Then in His childhood, then He goes and kills
the devil of Kamsa.

00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:44.889
That too, how beautifully He does it.

00:22:44.889 --> 00:22:48.200
How He kills the people who are surrounding
Him.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:58.160
How He knows their secrets, how they can be
killed, it shows complete brilliance and very

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.940
beautiful organizing the whole thing.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:13.280
Now imagine one Krishna fought, one Krishna
fought the whole army of that Kamsa, how He

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.639
must have done it, because after all He’s
Viraat.

00:23:17.639 --> 00:23:25.530
And the, all the powers that are of this all-pervading
Power are in His hands.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.220
He can do whatever He likes.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.930
He can play around as He likes.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:39.469
He can finish off anybody He wants, and it
is so easy for Him to manage all these things

00:23:39.469 --> 00:23:41.849
simultaneously.

00:23:41.849 --> 00:23:45.889
Then came His life when He became the king.

00:23:45.889 --> 00:23:55.219
When He became the king He wanted, I should
say in a way that, He wanted to establish

00:23:55.219 --> 00:24:01.119
people in dharma and He needed the help of
the five elements.

00:24:01.119 --> 00:24:08.420
So He made them into five ladies whom He married;
so He has five wives but they are five elements,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.889
part and parcel of His being.

00:24:10.889 --> 00:24:19.369
But He was Yogeshwara, absolutely detached
in His yoga, but He had, for practical purposes

00:24:19.369 --> 00:24:21.540
we can say, five wives.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:27.060
And they were sixteen thousand women who became
His wives.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:32.349
These sixteen thousand women are nothing but
His sixteen thousand powers because you know

00:24:32.349 --> 00:24:43.650
His chakras they have got sixteen petals and
these sixteen petals multiplied by the Virata’s

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:49.340
one thousand petals each – so it comes to
sixteen thousand powers.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:55.850
So these sixteen thousand powers were incarnated
as women, were taken away by some horrible

00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:02.180
king and He went there, fought that king and
brought these ladies.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:10.440
Now, even now it is so that even an old man,
has a young lady with Him, people will never

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.690
think that there is good relationship.

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:15.040
They’ll always think there must be something
wrong.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.730
So He had to marry them, because He had to
keep these ladies, so He married them.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:25.010
But mother’s position is different because
mother can have thousand children.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:31.610
But poor man, even if he has one woman around
him, everybody will say he’s a bad person.

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:37.330
So He had to marry all of them, so-called
marriage, and these sixteen thousand powers

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:45.589
stayed with Him by which He established our
Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:25:45.589 --> 00:25:51.440
Now when we have our Vishuddhi problems we
have to know what are the deities on both

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:58.450
the sides and what were their qualities which
are lacking in us – that’s why we are

00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:59.450
suffering.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:08.889
Let’s see the right side Vishuddhi when
we catch.

00:26:08.889 --> 00:26:17.270
Shri Krishna’s essence is sweetness – madhuriya,
madhuriya.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:18.459
And His power was Radha.

00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:23.629
“Ra” is energy “dha,” means the one
who has sustained the energy.

00:26:23.629 --> 00:26:26.950
And Her power was, She was called as Ahlada.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.389
“Ahlada” means joy giving qualities She
had.

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:39.580
So Shri Krishna’s qualities were that He
was Yogeshwara, so He was the witness and

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:40.650
sweetness.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:53.119
Now a person who shouts and screams and talks
loudly and loses his temper in a very loud

00:26:53.119 --> 00:27:02.410
voice, or who speaks very loudly all the time,
they all suffer from the right Vishuddhi..

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:08.869
So one should understand that even when you
have to scold somebody, you have to just say,

00:27:08.869 --> 00:27:09.889
“What are you doing?

00:27:09.889 --> 00:27:11.979
Why are you doing like this?”

00:27:11.979 --> 00:27:16.080
Otherwise “I give you, oh do like this?”

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.080
Finished!

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.129
Right Vishuddhi over.

00:27:18.129 --> 00:27:19.680
It’s finished now.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:25.479
So for the right Vishuddhi we use the mantra
of Vitthala and Rukmini, these two persons.

00:27:25.479 --> 00:27:31.389
You see it is very significant that also,
because they say that there was a pundalikaksh,

00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:36.170
one boy who was serving his parents.

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:43.629
And his parents were sleeping, he was pressing
their feet when Vitthala and His power Rukmini,

00:27:43.629 --> 00:27:46.200
they appeared in the door.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.270
But he said, “Now keep quiet.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.940
My parents are sleeping so you stay there!”

00:27:53.940 --> 00:28:00.350
So he had one brick near him which he threw
and asked them, “You stay on that."

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:07.670
So They kept quiet, They kept quiet because
they are sleeping.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.030
Now this is the thing is.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:21.010
On the right side if you are talking loudly,
if you talk too much, if you intimidate people

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:26.240
with your talking then you catch on right
Vishuddhi.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:32.489
So for that best is to take some rest and
give some rest to your right Vishuddhi by

00:28:32.489 --> 00:28:34.650
stopping your talk.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:38.369
Go into mauna they say, just don’t talk.

00:28:38.369 --> 00:28:43.259
For some time if you don’t talk you will
see that your Vishuddhi will be improved,

00:28:43.259 --> 00:28:45.910
your problems will be improved.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:52.430
So as it happens, the right side, what happens
is that the heat starts coming from the stomach.

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:55.270
It’s all in one play.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:29:01.930
From the, we can say, not from the stomach
but actually from the liver, the heat starts

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.050
rising.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:09.670
It first goes into right heart, as a result
you might become a very hot-tempered husband

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.950
or a father or something.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.739
You might get asthma, anything, with that
right heart.

00:29:14.739 --> 00:29:17.290
Then it passes on to your right Vishuddhi.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:22.989
When it goes to your right Vishuddhi then
you become a very irritable, hot-tempered

00:29:22.989 --> 00:29:23.989
person.

00:29:23.989 --> 00:29:26.660
All the time you shout at someone.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.780
Nobody can talk to you.

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.160
If somebody has to talk to you, he has to
use a barge pole in between.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.560
God knows what time he’ll shout at you.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:39.300
Or maybe, I’ve seen many women lose their
hearing or men lose their hearing when there

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.800
is somebody who is shouting at them.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:48.499
So shouting is a very bad thing for others
and also for yourself because, of course,

00:29:48.499 --> 00:29:54.100
your Vishuddhi goes out, after some time you
voice goes out, after some time you cannot

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:59.570
talk, and sometimes they have to just keep
quiet.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:07.150
But for others it’s even worse because if
you use your anger in that manner then that

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:13.219
person might be just frightened of you, might
develop inferiority complex, might become

00:30:13.219 --> 00:30:19.629
a left sided person, might catch some bhoots
or God knows what can happen to a person who

00:30:19.629 --> 00:30:23.589
has somebody all the time shouting at him.

00:30:23.589 --> 00:30:27.609
But the worst physical thing could be that
he could become deaf.

00:30:27.609 --> 00:30:36.849
So from Shri Krishna’s life one has to learn
that how He would just play His flute and

00:30:36.849 --> 00:30:50.089
the whole atmosphere used to become absolutely
quiet, without any ripple of any trouble,

00:30:50.089 --> 00:30:57.339
any idea of disturbance, just peaceful.

00:30:57.339 --> 00:31:00.949
But in modern times the other way round.

00:31:00.949 --> 00:31:05.389
They have the music where the right Vishuddhi
is about to break or burst.

00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:07.749
I don’t know what sort of a music it is.

00:31:07.749 --> 00:31:17.820
When they listen to this music, you see, then
it excites, then it excites you.

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.450
It doesn’t make you peaceful.

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.920
It excites you, excites you more and more.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:31.920
But, as Shri Krishna becomes Virata, your
limbic area also gets numbed with it.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:39.150
And when this shouting music is too much then
they have to use loud speakers and shout much

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:40.150
more.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:45.910
Then they have to put something near the ear
to hear something otherwise they have no excitement.

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:55.030
All the exciting, we can say all the exciting
cells become numbed.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:32:03.800
And you have to really go in for tremendous
effort to create that excitement in those

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.989
numbed cells.

00:32:05.989 --> 00:32:12.310
So it’s very dangerous throughout, if you
see that it starts from the liver, goes to

00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:17.999
the right heart, then to Vishuddhi and then
in the brain.

00:32:17.999 --> 00:32:23.560
So then you take to drugs because your brain
is numbed out.

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:29.629
So you take to drugs and when you take to
drugs then you feel that you are all right.

00:32:29.629 --> 00:32:34.660
Then again you feel that this drug is not
sufficient then you take stronger drugs.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:35.979
Then you take more drugs.

00:32:35.979 --> 00:32:38.139
It goes on one after another.

00:32:38.139 --> 00:32:42.900
Ultimately, it reaches a stage when you are
nowhere.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.090
So it is all self-destructive.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:33:11.699
(Shri Mataji coughs) I am also using My right
Vishuddhi too much.

00:33:11.699 --> 00:33:25.239
For right Visuddhi you have to learn to have
mauna, means silence.

00:33:25.239 --> 00:33:30.530
Those who think, who are very dominating,
who are talking in a very dominating manner,

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:38.009
whose right Vishuddhi is catching, should
become silent and should, at least for some

00:33:38.009 --> 00:33:41.410
time, should not talk at all.

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:47.719
Maybe you might fix one day, say you can do
it on a … say “I’ll not talk on Monday."

00:33:47.719 --> 00:33:52.810
But supposing Monday you have to work, so
you should say “I’ll not talk on Sunday."

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.982
But human beings are such that if they decide
that they will not talk on Sunday, then Sunday

00:33:56.982 --> 00:34:06.329
they will talk the most!

00:34:06.329 --> 00:34:12.450
And this shouting and then intimidating people
– you have no right.

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:17.390
You have no business to shout at anyone whatsoever.

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:19.590
What is the need to shout?

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:24.050
After all, you are a human being, another
one is a human being.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:30.000
God has not given anybody whether it is a
husband, wife, children or anyone.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.050
But I find even these days children shout,
the mother shouts, the father shouts.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:40.520
If you go in the house, you feel like running
back because you’ll find, hear, nothing

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.750
but shouts.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:50.210
So this kind of a family system will rock,
completely finish that family and there will

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:57.610
be no beautiful relationship between each
other and between the other people.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:02.910
Sometimes who can say, the whole country is
having nothing but shouting at one and shouting

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:03.910
at another.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.150
All over you go you find nothing but shouting.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:12.730
Even if you take your car little bit this
side there will be a shouting, I mean.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:17.820
For the slightest excuse, they start shouting
and spoiling their right Vishuddhi.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:24.170
Now, for politicians, they think it’s the
best way to shout because they can really

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:27.990
impress people by their shouts you see.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:31.170
So they shout a lot, tell people this that.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:35.280
When they speak, you should hear there’s
no sweetness in their tongue, nothing of the

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.280
kind.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:39.220
But they shout and by shouting a person gets
frightened.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.750
“All right, you want the vote?

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:42.150
We’ll give you but don’t shout."

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:48.360
That’s how many people get elected and become
big and think that they are very successful

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.760
because they have been shouting (laughter).

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:56.580
Then they have training for shouting and they
go in for higher and higher education in shouting,

00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:03.410
how to shout, how to intimidate people by
the loud voices.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:08.600
For Sahaja Yogis it doesn’t behove.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:18.500
Sahaja Yogi has to be a very sweet person
to talk, extremely sweet.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:26.900
Now when you are thinking of, say, Shri Rama
as a person who was a king, and then you have

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.080
got Shri Krishna who was a diplomat.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.270
So what is the divine diplomacy?

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:38.850
You don’t have to shout, but you change
the subject.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:49.360
If you want to bring somebody to a, some,
conclusion – then best thing is first you

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:56.680
change the subject and gradually, if you are
clever enough, then you go on changing, changing

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.800
and you bring it back to the right thing.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.310
That’s the clever thing to do.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:09.430
Otherwise, just by shouting if somebody may
say, “Yes, all right, I’ll do it,” by

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:13.540
the time you are gone they’ll say, “Yah,
I’ll do it."

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:16.060
That means something else.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:22.300
So you see, he might say, “yes” and “yah”
anytime.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:28.520
So to have a complete rapport with another
person is to play with that person.

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.310
That’s what I did also in Russia.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:35.760
I went round and round and round and round
and brought him to the point that we have

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:39.680
to be very independent thing, and I managed
it.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.310
That is Shri Krishna’s style.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:43.230
You see, because to face it.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:50.170
Supposing somebody says, “Oh this is my
idea; I’ve decided to do this and that and

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:55.510
everything,” then you should say slowly,
“All right, now I would say what you are

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.310
saying is correct, absolutely correct.

00:37:57.310 --> 00:38:03.200
I agree with you and what do you think about
the other thing?”

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.510
something like that.

00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:08.720
And then you should say, “Now, I can suggest.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:14.390
But I would like to suggest,” like this,
“if you can agree to it."

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:19.940
You see, gradually if you go and talk like
this things can work out and people can feel

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:29.840
really that you have taken time and you have
spent that much time and have accepted their

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.921
proposal and things.

00:38:31.921 --> 00:38:35.200
And they don’t feel bad.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:45.450
So one has to know that what is the essence
of all this diplomacy.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:54.230
Can you tell me?

00:38:54.230 --> 00:39:05.400
What is the essence of this diplomacy?

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.270
Is benevolence.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:14.670
You have to achieve the benevolence of the
whole humanity.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.660
This is the essence of it.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.460
If you are doing it, you are not doing for
yourself, for your gain.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:23.380
You are not doing for the gain of any particular
person.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:29.320
But you are doing it for the benevolence of
the whole humanity.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:34.460
So once, you know this is the essence, so
what is the need to shout?

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.620
By shouting you are not going to achieve anything.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:42.060
So to play around with it and bring it to
that point which is benevolence.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:49.420
Like Krishna was asked that “You said that
you have to tell the truth and it has to be

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.240
also very pleasing.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:53.670
Satyam vadet, priyam vadet."

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:57.310
He said, “how can it be?

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:58.940
These two things cannot be.

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.910
Supposing you tell the truth people may not
like it, may not please that person.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:05.120
So He said, “No.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.870
It should be ‘Satyam vadet, hitam vadet,
priyam vadet.'”

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:19.500
That “Tell the truth, tell for the benevolence
and tell the pleasing thing."

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:24.770
Supposing you tell somebody the truth, he
may not like that at that time.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.380
Supposing you tell that person, “Now don’t
go today by plane."

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.810
He will not like it, “What do you mean?

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.150
I’m going to go."

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.700
“No please don’t go.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.860
I request you."

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:40.450
Then he finds out that day the plane went
and had a crash.

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:44.500
So he thinks, “This was good because for
my benevolence this has worked out.

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.110
So this is something so good."

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:51.620
So immediately, he feels obliged to you and
he feels that you have told him the truth

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:55.860
by which it was his benevolence and that’s
why he’s pleased.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:41:02.030
So in the long run if you talk something for
the benevolence of a person, for the benevolence

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:09.120
of the spirit, then such a person immediately
thinks that we have really done such a great

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:19.920
obligation on him, that you have saved him.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:27.910
If even you have to tell some lies for the
benevolence, it does not matter.

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:32.340
It will not have any effect because Shri Krishna,
which is the deity, knows it.

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:37.720
For example, a man is coming to kill somebody
and you know where that man is hiding.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.390
He comes and asks you “Where is that man?”

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:44.360
Are you supposed to tell him the truth “All
right, he’s there.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.800
Go and kill him”?

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.800
No.

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.820
So what do you have to tell?

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.220
You have to tell him that “See.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.580
I’m not going to tell you.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:54.000
I don’t know.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Doesn’t matter."

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.820
Because what he is asking is unauthorized
is anadhikar.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:05.530
He had no business, he has no authority to
ask such a question.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:10.180
And he had no authority to extract the answer
from you.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:13.650
Whether you give him the answer or not answer
is your right.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:19.580
If you understand that, it is not for the
benevolence for the man who wants to kill,

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:25.740
because tomorrow he will be hanged, and not
also for the benevolence of the person whom

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.540
he is seeking out.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:31.700
So if you do like that then there is no problem.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:38.760
You’ll find most of the people will just
like you because they will know that you are

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.840
sincere, very honest, that you want to be
benevolent.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:50.150
Now as you know I have told all of you everything,
whatever I felt like about you, most of the

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:53.910
time I should say, not all of the time, but
of course most of the time.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:58.810
I have to also tell lies little bit.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:05.530
But whatever I do you will find out is for
your benevolence, is for your good.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.330
I have to tell you.

00:43:07.330 --> 00:43:09.360
I cannot run away from that.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.730
I have to face it.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:16.400
So you cannot run away from telling people
what you think is right for them.

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:21.140
Specially those about whom you are in charge.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:25.350
Like you have children, you’ve got a family,
you’ve got other relations, of whom you

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:32.830
are in charge then best thing is that you
have to tell them frankly what you think and

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.200
what is right.

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.300
It’s your duty.

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.290
Then people escape it also.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:42.270
Many people who don’t want to face their
children, I have seen, they’ll give them

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:43.910
toys, toys after toys.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:46.640
They will not like to face their children,
tell them, “No, I don’t like it.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.640
This is not good.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:52.040
I would like you to do like this and this."

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:57.830
So discipline doesn’t mean, discipline doesn’t
mean something very dominating of one person

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:04.240
or two persons, but discipline means that
whatever we do has to be for the benevolence

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.790
of your spirit and the spirit of others.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:16.890
That is what is the Sahaj discipline where
you do everything for the benevolence of others

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:21.070
and for the benevolence of your own ascent.

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:27.090
Once you have established this idea of hita,
of this benevolence, you have known the life

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:33.810
of Christ, life of Mohammed, life of all these
great people.

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:39.180
Because what They have done is for the benevolence
of the people.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:44.420
So I would say now we have the left Vishuddhi
and you know very well that left Vishuddhi

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.790
is the lightning, in the lightning.

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.160
Now what is lightning?

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.810
He just shouts and roars.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:45:03.810
So a person who has got left Vishuddhi should
actually become a person who can shout and

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:13.400
who can scream and who can, I should say,
expose others as She did.

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.780
In the same way, you have to do it.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.790
In that you should not be afraid, you should
not worry, and you should not think “How

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:21.670
can I do it after all?”

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:29.430
But mostly the people who feel guilty is a
type which has lost his confidence and the

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:35.440
ego has entered into the left side – it’s
a very complicated situation.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:40.060
So we have to be on the lookout that we are
not guilty, it’s very important.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:43.170
Guilty for this, guilty for that, it’s just
a myth.

00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:48.080
We want to escape reality that’s why we
say we are guilty.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.960
So you have to face, face it, your reality.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:57.260
Try to find out what’s wrong with you and
what’s wrong with another person and face

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.260
it.

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:05.720
That is much better than to just say, “Oh
I feel very guilty,” and sitting down, because

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:18.460
Vishnumaya is nothing but like an electricity
and electricity exposes people, she screams

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:25.720
at people, shouts at people, she roars at
people.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:30.340
So if you have a left Vishuddhi then you have
to use these methods.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:36.710
I would say a person who has an inferiority
complex should go to the sea and address the

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:42.560
sea and tell, “I am the lord of the sea,
I am this, I am that!” loudly.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:47.540
Those people who cannot speak on the stage,
cannot come on the stage, they should go – also

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.900
same way – when they try they’ll become
great speakers.

00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:57.090
It will be a very good idea for you to go
and just to give a big lecture and with that

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:08.820
big lecture you can always show that you are
not suffering from any inferiority complex

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:21.660
but you are expressing yourself in a clear-cut
way.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:30.870
So now you will see the power of Shri Krishna
is of the throat, of the right side, where

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:32.970
what is the power He has got?

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:38.770
The power is that He is sweetness.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:45.270
He has the power of the shouting – or you
can say with which, the vocal chord as you

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:46.270
call it.

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:53.150
He is the power of the vocal chord but how
does He use His power is for sweetness is

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.830
a contrast.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:59.680
And the same thing happens with Vishnumaya
too.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:05.980
Now Vishnumaya is the potential power in the,
say, in the clouds, is a potential one.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:14.020
But what She does is to scream, shout and
show Her existence, that She exists.

00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:19.000
Now all these photographs that you get and
all these miraculous photographs you have

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.690
been showing me are because of Vishnumaya.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:26.140
She is the one, as electricity, She acts.

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:30.290
And She is the one who manages all these things
very well.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:37.710
So though She is the sister of Shri Krishna
She is in a way very much subtler because

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.560
She helps you in such a subtle manner.

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:46.530
Now this mic [microphone] it has electricity
in it – you’ll be surprised My vibrations

00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:48.570
are passing through this.

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:55.760
It is bombarding this and from here, they
are going anywhere you want them to go.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.240
You can put a computer on the other side and
you can computerize Me.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:10.160
It is such a remarkable thing that the one
which is supposed to shout, scream and roar

00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:18.810
is the one which is on the left hand side
so that it exists in the people in a potential

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:19.810
way.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:29.940
In the people who are feeling guilty, who
are suffering from inferiority complex, who

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:34.680
are sly, who feel they are good for nothing.

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.210
She exists in them.

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:37.730
See the contrast again.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:48.480
She exists in them that Her power, She exists
in a person, or expresses in a person who

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:54.250
is not self confident.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:59.650
And then She asserts Her power by which persons
become self confident.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:06.840
This is how Her working comes in and that
is potentially within us also.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:12.490
So when we talk of Vishnumaya we have to know
that She is sitting down there.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:18.750
Any moment we decide, we can become great
speakers, we can expose people.

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:22.060
We’ll be like lightning, we can roar.

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:25.160
But normally we are not.

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:31.210
So it gives balance to both sides of people.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:38.320
But in the center when you rise – the kundalini
rises – most of the people have their Vishuddhi

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.670
caught up, most of the people.

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:46.210
So they have to either see that they are not
guilty or they have to see that there is no

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:50.410
shouting – nothing – they are not aggressive
in their shouts.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:58.170
And, plus, they have to see that they are
completely in balance with themselves.

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:04.670
So they are in the central path by which they
become sweet, kind and nice.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.990
Now there are many people who artificially
become sweet.

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:09.200
Artificially.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:15.070
They have to take out some money so they’ll
be extremely sweet and nice.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:22.240
Such people are really going to go to hell
because they are using the power of Shri Krishna

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:27.200
in a very absurd manner and for that, they
cannot be spared.

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.640
So those who are artificially sweet are good
for nothing.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:38.870
You have to be really sweet and kind if you
think of Him as the One who is Narayana, who

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:52.040
is Shri Rama, who is Shri Krishna and who
is the Lord of your Vishuddhi.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:57.060
So we have to control, not to feel guilty
again, because there might be some people

00:51:57.060 --> 00:52:00.250
who might be feeling that “Mother is saying
to me."

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:04.710
I’m not saying to anyone as such, it’s
a general talk.

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:09.790
So what I’m saying is that if you are a
person who is a shouting type, please bring

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:15.920
it round and keep it in check and take rest,
give rest to your throat.

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:21.610
Some people are very happy if they are told
that “Today collector sahib is in rest."

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:26.340
They said, “Permanently or for a short time?”

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:30.710
Because he’s the one, if he’s a shouting
fellow, nobody wants to see him.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:35.880
No one likes any person who shouts, no one
likes.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.770
Even the nearest and dearest don’t like
it.

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:45.180
Of course they tolerate, is different, but
they don’t like it they don’t want it.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:51.040
So for us it is important to understand that
our Vishuddhi is to be kept clear first of

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:58.770
all we must have a beautiful heart, a very
clean heart, where there is a fragrance of

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:03.960
Shri Krishna’s melodious music.

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:09.612
Unless and until we have a beautiful, sweet
music in our heart we can never be, never

00:53:09.612 --> 00:53:11.950
be good Sahaj Yogis.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:21.890
I hope today’s evening puja, though has
been rather late, doesn’t matter, will help

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:27.270
you to think about it, improving your Vishuddhi,
working it out.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:35.740
And then to look at the Viraat and find out
what’s wrong with you, get it corrected

00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:47.030
– which can be done by anyone – and see
that you just have a full idea about yourself,

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:48.380
about your Vishuddhi.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:54.300
And that’s only possible, only again it’s
a vicious circle, if you have a good Vishuddhi.

00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:58.970
If you don’t have a good Vishuddhi you can
never see yourself because at the Vishuddhi

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:02.350
point only, you become the witness.

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:05.560
You are just a witness when you are at a Vishuddhi
point.

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.300
So you have to be at the Vishuddhi a witness.

00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:15.860
If you have achieved the witness nature then
you can see in your Vishuddhi what’s wrong

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:21.930
with you, what’s wrong with your problems,
with your atmosphere, everything, and you

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:26.150
will end up here only thinking, “Oh, this
is the one that is wrong."

00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:33.830
So today, when we are worshipping Shri Krishna,
we should know that our Vishuddhis and our

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:40.460
brain, because ultimately He becomes the brain,
Shri Krishna becomes the brain.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:46.800
That’s what I told you that the fat of the
stomach goes in the brain.

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:54.970
So Shri Narayana enters into the brain and
becomes what we call as Viraat, Akhbar.

00:54:54.970 --> 00:55:03.450
And when He becomes Akhbar, then He’s the
brain in the big macrocosm.

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:08.120
He’s the brain.

00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:14.400
So people who worship Shri Krishna become
brainy people without ego.

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:19.890
Their brain develops and they have no ego
about it.

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:31.940
Egoless intelligence, which I call as the
pure intelligence, starts manifesting.

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:45.840
May God bless you all.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:59.370
After this puja now you know that I’m going
to Finland and you should see My itinerary.

00:55:59.370 --> 00:56:00.480
It’s terrible.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:08.271
And from Finland to Moscow, Moscow to India,
India to Japan, and Japan to Los Angeles and

00:56:08.271 --> 00:56:11.530
Los Angeles to New Zealand, New Zealand to
Australia.

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:15.030
So this will be like this everyday practically,
I think.

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:19.350
But whatever it is I’m going now and now
you have some time.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:28.300
We have lot of time now in between till I
come in October to trouble you again.

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:34.700
So in this time you all should decide what
you are going to do, how are you going to

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:37.970
help Sahaja Yoga, how you are going to work
it out.

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:46.790
This is very important because I don’t need
any Sahaja Yog, you need it and all the rest

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:47.790
of the world needs it.

00:56:47.790 --> 00:56:49.550
But despite that I’m working so hard.

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:52.120
So you have to think that “Mother is now
gone out, doesn’t matter.

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:57.250
We are going to work it out and we are going
to find out what we can do about it."

00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:59.900
So please work out something till I come back.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:08.890
I’ll be back here again in October, then
we’ll see what we can do and achieve further.

00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:14.090
But let’s see what you have achieved and
bring them to some conclusions, bring them

00:57:14.090 --> 00:57:16.500
to some fruits.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:18.840
And that is what I’m expecting.

00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:26.800
Now I have to thank all the people who have
done so much for Sahaja Yoga already and all

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:32.600
the centers and all the countries where Sahaja
Yoga started and is growing so much.

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:38.720
I don’t know if you know the names of all
the leaders or not, but it is worth knowing

00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:46.990
all the leaders of all the countries and paying
your attention to them and praying that they

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:58.160
should be able to deliver blessings of Sahaja
Yoga to everyone.

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:06.640
Also they should be able to have visions,
to see what they can do and how they can combine

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:10.850
different countries and how they can work
out through their own countries.

00:58:10.850 --> 00:58:17.320
So this is what it is and I have to thank
all the leaders of the world and all the people

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:26.080
wherever I have been so far, for the arrangements
and everything they did.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:29.760
They worked very hard and achieved such a
lot of things.

00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:35.740
And I have to thank also the Sahaja Yogis
who are with them, who have helped so much.

00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:36.830
Thank you very much, all of you.
