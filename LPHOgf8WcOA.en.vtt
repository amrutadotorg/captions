00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.230
I'm telling them about love, all-pervading
love of God Almighty.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.200
He's created this whole thing.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.160
The whole atmosphere is there.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.759
The whole feeling is there of love.

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:29.380
But it's possible only for people who are
innocent, like children.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.550
If you are very mature in your hatred, no
one can save you.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379
You'll have ten arguments to show that your
hatred is justifiable.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.940
Then you'll go to any extent to justify it.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.750
We had people in our country, which is a very,
supposed to be a very, sober country, a very

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.469
peaceful country, we had people who just believe
in killing - kill this, kill that.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:09.140
So even in this country, which didn't believe
in all these things, indulged into all kinds

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.820
of violence since long.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:23.490
But basically we are people who believe in
peace, because without peace no growth can

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.590
take place.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.490
There has to be complete peace.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:34.840
If there is peace in your heart, if there
is peace surrounding you, you grow into a

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.710
beautiful nation.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:53.010
Not out of fear, not out of pressure, but
from inside; if you are a person who has complete

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.810
peace within the heart, not that he is not
afraid of anything, but he emits peace.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.780
He gives peace.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.179
Anybody who goes near such a person, gets
the peace, the feeling of peacefulness.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.200
You all are Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.350
You all have got your Realization.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.420
That is, your spirit is now emitting vibrations
of peace and joy.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.540
Wherever you are, you will emit peaceful vibrations.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.049
You will create peace.

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:43.730
You'll find out ways of creating peace, how
to establish peaceful atmosphere.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:54.230
It's very important that we have to grow in
such a manner that we create peace and give

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.489
peace to others and become examples of it.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:08.060
I cannot believe in this Delhi I could have
so many people who are realised souls.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.420
I never expected.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:24.060
First of all, I had to wait until people got
into a proper mind to understand My work,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:33.200
because we had partition and so many people
lost their lives, lost their properties and

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200
I have faced all that.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.299
I have seen it Myself and they just couldn't;
couldn't forgive other people.

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:55.870
So forgiveness is a very good method of understanding
the pain of others; troubles of others, but

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.840
this depth you have to develop.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:09.489
Instead of getting angry, getting revengeful,
if you can develop that peace within yourself,

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:19.780
if you can manage to have the peace of your
mind through Divine love, there's no need

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.340
for you to do anything extra.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.120
It's just the peace that you have, now, in
your heart.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.110
Just feel it.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.080
You are a peaceful person.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.340
You are not a person who is easily disturbed.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.863
You will never give explanations for getting
angry, for spoiling the mood of people.

00:04:45.863 --> 00:04:46.863
You will not do that.

00:04:46.863 --> 00:04:57.630
You are the ones who rise above all this anger
and this stupid revengefulness.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:07.380
It is difficult to explain to those people
who are not Realized Souls, because if I talk

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.330
to them, they won't like it.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.889
If they get their realisation, we can talk
to them.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.729
So best thing you should spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:27.139
Spread it among Sikhs, among Muslims, among
Christians, throughout, and especially among

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:36.139
Hindus because nowadays I find Hindus are
also, have lost their grip over their understanding

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:46.139
of our country and its culture and that's
how they just revenge, they take revenge.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.810
I don't understand this kind of revenge but
what to do?

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:59.509
People are already on that level, on that
low level, where they don't understand many

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:00.509
things.

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:12.039
For example now, they do not want people to
build a temple of Shri Rama at a particular

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:13.039
point.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:19.150
Because they are not Sahaja Yogis, I can't
talk to them that that is the place where

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.060
He was born.

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.539
So we must pay full respect to His incarnation.

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:34.630
If that is the place He was born, we can feel
it with the vibrations, then why deny the

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.180
fact and the truth just because you don't
want it to be done?

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.530
It's very difficult to talk to them.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:52.759
What to understand is that, what has Babar
done for us?

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:54.050
Who was Babar?

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.729
He was a foreigner and this one was not even
built by Babar.

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.719
No, it was not.

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:11.819
It was somebody who was his - one of the military
man who went and built it and that's why they

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.720
call it a Babri Masjid.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:21.539
But let us find out what happened to this
Mr. Babar.

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:27.509
He died, but he came from abroad.

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:30.770
He was not even an Indian.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.430
And doesn't matter, he was not born there.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:41.120
I mean, he had nothing to do with that place,
but definitely I know and you all will know,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:49.419
can feel it all on your hands just now that
it is Babri Masjid, is the place where Shri

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:51.729
Rama was born.

00:07:51.729 --> 00:07:59.120
Now, if you want to build a temple there,
what will go wrong with people?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.449
What will happen to them if a temple is built
there?

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:10.110
I mean it is just a question of respect and
feelings about it.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:17.410
I also take Rama's name; everybody takes His
name because such a solace and such a comfort.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:24.249
But the way people look at things, it's difficult,
you can't talk to them.

00:08:24.249 --> 00:08:37.190
Now they are talking about another nonsense
that we have one hair of Mohammed-sahib in

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.479
Kashmir.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.050
Now somebody said that it is not His hair.

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.830
How do you know?

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.350
What is your criterion to decide whose hair
it is?

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:57.290
Actually, you will be amazed, when I went
to Kashmir; we were going somewhere in the

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:02.230
car and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:06.261
So I asked the driver, "Why don't you take
the car on this side?"

00:09:06.261 --> 00:09:07.261
He said, "Why?"

00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:08.261
"Because I want to go."

00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:15.029
He said, "It is an old road and there are
some few people living there."

00:09:15.029 --> 00:09:17.000
"It doesn't matter.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.320
Take it."

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:28.860
We went near and nearer and there were some
houses of Muslims, so we called them and asked

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.030
them, "What is here going on?"

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:37.850
They said, "It is Hazrat Bal."

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:42.390
Even the name gives you such peace.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.820
It was the hair of Muhammed-sahib.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:53.060
Now Hindus don't want to know about Him and
Muslims don't want to know about Shri Ram.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.240
It's very surprising.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:03.820
They are all having their own shops and selling
there own things, but they don't understand

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:09.690
that whatever they are selling is the same
which the other people are selling.

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:11.740
For example, they say, "Allah."

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.459
Who is Allah?

00:10:13.459 --> 00:10:24.790
According to Sahaj Yoga, Allah is nobody else
but Vishnu and Vishnu who came also as Shri

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.149
Ram.

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:34.240
So whatever they call as Allah is Shri Ram
Himself.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.060
Only a Sahaj Yogi can understand that.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:42.500
If you put up your hands now when I am talking,
you will be surprised what vibrations are

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:54.610
there because it is Shri Ram, who is Allah,
whom you are trying to insult by your stupidity.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:11:02.120
So it could be stupidity on part of Muhammed-sahib
or on part of Hindus.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.920
Hindus are also not understanding.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:11.740
Somehow they know that is the birthplace of
Shri Ram.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.329
Somehow, I don't know, somebody must have
told them.

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:18.120
Or maybe - I don't know how they know - they
don't know vibrations.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:28.560
I haven't yet met many Hindus who have vibration
- I mean those who are what you can call fundamentalist.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.940
They never have vibrations.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:35.310
So I used to wonder, how do they know this
is the janma bhoomi of Shri Rama?

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.710
Maybe, somehow they come to know.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:40.620
But they have no point to prove.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:48.540
The problem is if they were Realized Souls,
if our high court judges were Realized Souls,

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:55.759
if our cabinet were Realized Souls, you could
have talked to them.

00:11:55.759 --> 00:12:01.639
But they are all - what should I say?

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:04.970
- Absolutely blocked people.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:09.160
How to tell them that this quarrel is a nonsense?

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:17.170
It is perfectly all right to build a temple
of Shri Ram.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:24.660
But whatever you may say, the trouble is first
they all should get their Self Realization.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:33.050
Just now, at the time when we are talking,
see, there are not sufficient people who have

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.709
got Self Realization.

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:37.740
You are all Realized Souls.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:47.600
There was another one who told Me, who was
giving Realization to these mahantas - mahantas

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:54.850
are the people who are suppose to be saints
- and every one of them, when they got Realization,

00:12:54.850 --> 00:13:00.949
they got exposed, so he didn't know what to
do with them.

00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:08.019
That may happen with anyone, even in Christian
churches or you go to Jews - everywhere you'll

00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:10.230
find this is the problem.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:16.769
If you give them Realization, they'll get
exposed.

00:13:16.769 --> 00:13:26.640
So what's the use of disturbing all the people
who have such faith in them and think they're

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.160
very great people.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.579
Now only way you can judge them is through
vibrations.

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:40.620
But out of love, I can't tell them that "You
are not Realized Souls.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:46.019
You have no business to talk about Shri Ram
or about Mohammed-sahib.

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:47.560
They're much beyond you."

00:13:47.560 --> 00:14:00.399
So the problem now is between the people who
are not knowledgeable and those who are knowledgeable.

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:03.360
It was a very big gap before.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:10.610
Only one person used to be a Realized Soul;
so they used to stone him, beat him, do all

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.089
kinds of things.

00:14:12.089 --> 00:14:15.370
Now you are so many.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:23.731
So, if you put up your case anywhere, even
at this stage, nobody is going to listen to

00:14:23.731 --> 00:14:24.731
you.

00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:25.731
I would request you only one thing.

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:35.389
Give Realization to people, as many as possible,
and not to any 'spiritual' so-called people.

00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:37.959
Because they get exposed, what's the use?

00:14:37.959 --> 00:14:41.730
This is a common thing.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.410
So many people have told Me, "We gave Realization
to one priest.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:47.410
He got exposed."

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.670
"Means, what happened?"

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.850
"He was exposed, Mother.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.569
He was put in jail."

00:14:54.569 --> 00:14:57.300
"Aiy, this is too much.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.779
After getting Realisation, he goes to jail."

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:02.089
So this is the problem.

00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:06.720
In love, you cannot be hypocritical about
it.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.420
Love - you have to be a pure personality.

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.339
Must try to purify yourself.

00:15:13.339 --> 00:15:14.339
You have to change.

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:21.639
If you are still angry, if you are still greedy,
if you have all these things, love won't work

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:22.639
out.

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.769
It won't work out.

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:32.089
So to love someone in a Divine way is to first
understand the value of innocence.

00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:35.899
Why I love children?

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:38.769
Because they're innocent.

00:15:38.769 --> 00:15:40.940
They don't have all these things.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:52.490
Like in our country these days, the epidemic
- epidemic of corruption has started - epidemic.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.709
It's not simple.

00:15:56.709 --> 00:16:04.600
Anybody you see, after every third person,
there's an epidemic of corruption.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.350
Now why?

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.850
Because they want money.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.600
All right.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.060
Then what do they do with their money?

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:23.509
They don't know how to hide, so they put it
in some sort of a pot or whatever it is and

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:27.589
the money gets lost.

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:29.730
If not, they are caught up.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:32.949
That's not so important.

00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:38.350
What's important is, 'Why have this greed?'

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:46.290
People who are rich are more greedy than the
people who are poor, because the poor people

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:48.500
at least have some fear of God.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.860
But the rich are very greedy.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.000
They're running after this, running after
that.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.940
There's no end to it.

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:08.880
It is very surprising that in this country
of ours this new disease has started.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:15.750
With this disease, even in Sahaja Yoga, there
are some people who have made a business out

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.089
of Sahaj Yoga and making money.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:27.540
So greed is something that comes to you from
the right side and you start justifying it.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.460
There's no place for love for the right side.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:45.190
Now this greed has gone so far that the whole
country is getting ruined.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:47.290
We can never progress.

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:53.090
We can never achieve anything because everywhere
there's greed when people are just taking

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:54.090
it.

00:17:54.090 --> 00:18:03.669
But if you love your country, if you have
love for your country, you won't do it.

00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:06.280
But that love is missing.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.140
They love - I don't know whom do they love.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:16.320
They love their children in such a way that
they ruin their lives.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.340
Love is not limited.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.970
Love has to be unlimited.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:27.070
Unlimited love which binds the whole world.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:37.980
There is this force, there is already acting
this force; only thing you have to become

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:45.790
the agents of that, to become the people who
can communicate that love.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:54.240
You have every right to that great wealth
of love and you can spread that all around.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:19:03.110
But I find that even here people think in
the terms of money.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.270
Money is the enemy of love.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:14.720
I assure you if you have interest in money,
you can never progress in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.620
I'm hopeless, I agree.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.140
I don't know how to take interest even.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.000
What is so interesting about it?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.620
And people laugh at Me that "You don't know
simple things, even to count the money."

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.880
I said, "I know."

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:37.030
I can tell you like this, how much money's
there, but I'm not interested.

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:39.870
There's so many other things to be interested.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.650
You see the children.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.669
You see nice, nice people.

00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:50.320
In the whole world, there are so many beautiful
people, beautiful things.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:57.919
Why pay so much attention to this useless
stuff, which comes and goes?

00:19:57.919 --> 00:20:06.010
But that is what is the most - I should say
- gripping thing that is also there.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:07.980
In India is the worst, I think.

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.840
They say that India is the most corrupt country,
but I don't know.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.630
I have never seen that kind of thing, but
must be true.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:30.850
On such an occasion, it's very auspicious
that you should think that money is of no

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:42.090
value to you, has no value, and you will be
amazed, you will have never dirth of money

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.090
- absolutely.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:55.030
This is one thing in Sahaja Yoga you have
to get, that money is of no value.

00:20:55.030 --> 00:21:00.720
There's no interest in money.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:10.290
Your money is in getting how many people you
have in Sahaja Yoga, how many people you have

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:16.320
brought in Sahaja Yoga, how many people have
got this joy.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.240
You have not purchased it.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.159
Nobody has to purchase it.

00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:26.010
It's free, flowing everywhere.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.860
It's so joy giving.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.510
What else do you want with money?

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:32.510
Nothing.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:40.730
Just with money - headaches, fear and all
kinds of problems.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:58.529
So, parallel to our Sahaja Yoga, it should
be the life of freedom, complete freedom and

00:21:58.529 --> 00:22:04.730
enjoyment, nothing to worry about.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:07.809
Nothing is dependent on money.

00:22:07.809 --> 00:22:17.720
I have seen people living in very poor conditions,
extremely happy and joyous; while those who

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:22.600
have lots of money, especially in the foreign
countries, are rich people.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:28.910
They have depression, all kinds of funny,
funny situations there.

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.640
They commit suicides.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.640
Why?

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.940
If money was everything, why all the rich
country people commit suicide?

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.830
What is the gain they have?

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:52.640
See, and all the time what they are thinking,
how to get into a kind of a fashion.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:59.900
Fashion, because if you have no money, you
cannot get into those fashions.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:07.140
The fashions are so common now, so common,
that for that people hanker.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:13.400
If they cannot get to the fashions, they think
that something has gone wrong with them, something

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.880
is - But not you because you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:24.130
Now you see these things happening, so what
have you to do?

00:23:24.130 --> 00:23:30.940
Have pity for such people - no contempt, but
pity - and you have to tell them that, "What

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.080
are you doing?

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.350
Why are you wasting your time?

00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:42.790
This is the best time for you to reach the
highest goal of your life, of Self Realization

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:47.910
and why are you so much running after all
these things?

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:53.610
What is it that makes you run this rat-race?"

00:23:53.610 --> 00:24:01.360
I think it's a breaking point everywhere and
people are thinking, but you are the people

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.520
who should provide.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:08.350
In a very large scale, you can work it out.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:11.190
I mean, I have seen people who have nothing
in them.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.039
They are not spiritual.

00:24:13.039 --> 00:24:17.020
They are not the ones who can give Realization
or anything.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:25.029
But just because they are doing some social
work, they are very famous.

00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:26.992
What is the social work?

00:24:26.992 --> 00:24:30.260
Looking after the poor or something like that.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:41.661
Now, when your love, which is so great, which
is so effective, that starts working, you

00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:53.070
feel you should do something, then you'll
be amazed how your Sahaja Yoga will be understood.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:25:00.740
So far Sahaja Yoga is all right, people are
very nice, excellent, saintly and all.

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:09.230
But effect of that must be seen and people
should see the effect of that, of your love.

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:12.190
First is forgiveness.

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.400
You have to forgive people.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.550
They are utterly stupid.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:21.950
I have just now explained to you how stupid
they are.

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.120
So, nothing to worry about that.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:34.179
If you are such a wise personality, you should
try to judge everything with wisdom and don't

00:25:34.179 --> 00:25:46.669
fall a trap into things where you feel that
you have to do it like some fashion or some

00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:50.340
sort of a - I should say what?

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.700
- some grouping.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.760
No need, we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:57.790
We are self-sufficient.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.539
We don't need anything.

00:25:59.539 --> 00:26:02.770
If you are one, we are all right.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.270
If you are many, we are all right.

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:14.130
Now you must know that you have reached a
very high state and you have touched that

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:18.190
love, that Universal Love of God.

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:24.470
So express more of that love in your daily
life.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:29.420
Express more of that love in dealing with
others.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.590
Express your love in a way that others are
made happy.

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:39.220
It's all something to be thought of.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.159
How can you quarrel if you are real Sahaja
Yogis?

00:26:42.159 --> 00:26:46.140
How can you put down others if they are Sahaja
Yogis?

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.232
How can you deceive others if you are Sahaja
Yogis?

00:26:48.232 --> 00:26:49.232
Not possible.

00:26:49.232 --> 00:26:55.690
You should have no interest in all these things.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:27:04.830
That means now you are clarified and you are
clear and you are now Nirmal.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.000
Nobody can touch you.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.070
This sort of attitude, should have respect
for yourself.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:19.480
This kind of understanding you should have
about yourself.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.830
What is your role?

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.179
What is your position?

00:27:22.179 --> 00:27:34.029
You should know that you are Realized Souls
and what you should do as Realized Soul that

00:27:34.029 --> 00:27:35.029
you should know.

00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:45.050
You are not another sort of madman running
the rat race or also you're not in competition.

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:49.790
You're not competitive.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:57.919
You are just progressing by your own love
and blessings.

00:27:57.919 --> 00:28:01.080
I know how the blessings work.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:09.429
But first of all, you have to be worthy of
that blessing, otherwise - can't help it.

00:28:09.429 --> 00:28:11.750
Your loving nature.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:23.799
That's why Christ has said that you have to
be like children to enter into the Kingdom

00:28:23.799 --> 00:28:25.539
of God.

00:28:25.539 --> 00:28:32.669
You are already in the Kingdom of God, but
you have to be like children; how innocent

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:40.720
they are, how simple they are and they're
happy with small, small things.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.090
They don't want something very extraordinary.

00:28:44.090 --> 00:28:56.450
It's very surprising how our love, which is
actually, is enlightened by Divine Love, can

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.860
change the whole world.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:08.230
How I had this idea and how it has prospered.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:18.080
If you all help Me in this, I'm sure Sahaja
Yoga can do so many things, which have not

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.110
been achieved.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:24.210
Now you go home and think whatever I have
told you.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.740
Think about it.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.299
What you need is introspection.

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:29.740
What you need is understanding.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:34.650
"What have I done out of my life as Sahaja
Yogis?"

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:41.409
And then you will find out that you can do
a lot, a lot.

00:29:41.409 --> 00:29:44.399
And that has to be done.

00:29:44.399 --> 00:29:46.389
May God bless you.
