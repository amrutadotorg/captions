1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,762
But the real spirituality, if you have,

2
00:00:09,883 --> 00:00:13,085
the protection will be always there,

3
00:00:13,206 --> 00:00:16,641
and Shiva will be very blissful.

4
00:00:16,762 --> 00:00:20,004
It’s extremely blissful.

5
00:00:20,125 --> 00:00:26,044
And what does he give you is even more beautiful

6
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:28,327
than you could think of.

7
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:33,964
He is extremely forgiving.

8
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:37,802
I should say he is the source of such forgiveness.

9
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:44,601
If you have forgiveness in your heart, he resides in your heart.¶

10
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:54,923
Otherwise, gradually, you start developing

11
00:00:56,044 --> 00:01:01,206
very difficult types of diseases.

12
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,762
Say, if you are forgiving, your heart runs very fast.

13
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:16,560
No-one can touch your heart. You cannot get heart-attacks.

14
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:24,641
But if you are tolerating, suffering

15
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:34,641
and taking many things as a power of your own,

16
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:41,246
doing wrong things and forgetting about God,

17
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:48,520
then you also start developing a very weak heart.

18
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:52,762
So one side is that you develop a heart

19
00:01:52,883 --> 00:01:58,762
which is extremely aggressive,

20
00:02:00,125 --> 00:02:04,367
and can become like Hitler’s heart.

21
00:02:05,286 --> 00:02:12,520
Under any kind of pretensions, if you start torturing someone,

22
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:16,246
your heart becomes solid

23
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:20,762
and then you can get a tremendous massive heart-attack,

24
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:23,923
and all the troubles from that.

25
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:28,923
This is inevitable.

26
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:34,843
But supposing you are extremely tolerant

27
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:39,843
and you tolerate all nonsense, you are very docile,

28
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:43,206
you are a frightened person.

29
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:47,964
If you are frightened, then because of fright you do that,

30
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:53,246
you can develop another kind of a heart we call as angina

31
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,802
where the blood supply is less,

32
00:02:55,923 --> 00:03:01,802
and ultimately you develop a kind of guilt and

33
00:03:01,923 --> 00:03:06,883
you lead a very mediocre life.¶

34
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:14,004
So this second thing also is very visible

35
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:19,399
among people who think they are very, very tolerant.

36
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,165
I am saying that tolerance is alright,

37
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:26,883
because of Spirituality,

38
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:30,439
but not because you are frightened,

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,085
and you are afraid of something.

40
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:38,560
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have no business to be

41
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:41,125
afraid of anything.

42
00:03:42,286 --> 00:03:46,165
In India people are afraid of everything!

43
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:50,439
If they can see a squirrel, they will be frightened.

44
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,762
If they see a lizard – finished!

45
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,641
I mean they are afraid of anything,

46
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:06,762
and the ladies in India are so afraid of even cockroaches!

47
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:11,964
This kind of temperament is absolutely stupid!

48
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:21,004
Because that makes you a kind of a person who is prone to angina.

49
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:24,004
What is there to be afraid of?

50
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:27,327
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini,

51
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,004
you are not to be afraid of anything.

52
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,206
They are afraid of rats,

53
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:38,246
all kinds of nonsense and they boast of it,

54
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:40,480
and they talk about it.

55
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:46,004
Here the heart is becoming weak and weak and weak.¶

56
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:51,520
Also, I must say, the Indian men are responsible for that.

57
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:54,480
Because they treat their women as

58
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:59,125
if they are appendages or some sort of a liability,

59
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:01,641
I don’t know what they think they are.

60
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:07,367
Their behaviour is so bad, unbelievable!

61
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,206
Especially in north India, I have seen, women have no position.

62
00:05:13,327 --> 00:05:18,560
The woman is brought in the house, kept in the house,

63
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:22,125
just like a maidservant,

64
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:25,286
she has to cover he face all the time,

65
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:31,439
she doesn’t have to go out anywhere without permission.

66
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,520
It’s terrible!

67
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:37,923
Some people say it is a Muslim influence or whatever it is.

68
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:47,964
But when you believe in eternal life, in spiritual life,

69
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:57,367
you should not be governed by any such nonsensical atrocities.¶

70
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,004
And that’s why I feel

71
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:06,560
that you really need the emancipation of women in India.

72
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:12,802
They are very good, they are very tolerant, they are very sweet,

73
00:06:12,923 --> 00:06:21,367
but they develop all the bad diseases, all the mental diseases,

74
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,923
because they don’t know their own value,

75
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:29,327
they don’t know their own self-respect.

76
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,762
And on this I have already spoken at length.

77
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:37,165
Whey should men behave like that?

78
00:06:37,762 --> 00:06:45,165
I think in our country, we have at least seventy percent are women;

79
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:52,246
and seventy percent people’s energy is wasted in the north India.

80
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:56,480
I don’t know what they think of themselves.

81
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:59,560
And then they are punished.

82
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:03,802
All such countries can never prosper,

83
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,843
because women are the Laxmis.

84
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:11,399
But they have to be Laxmis also,

85
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,480
they have to behave like Laxmis.

86
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:19,560
But some of them come up like this that you are shocked.

87
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:24,165
How can they be women, they look like devils?

88
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,044
So such an imbalance in the society

89
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:33,883
which is punished, again, by Shri Mahadeva.¶

90
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:38,964
He is very kind,

91
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:42,964
and he looks after the people who have to suffer it.

92
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:47,762
And he tries to punish people who make them suffer.

93
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:53,681
It is his quality to help

94
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:59,601
by destroying people who are aggressive.

95
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,601
He doesn’t talk of any Kundalini,

96
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:06,560
he doesn’t talk of Self Realisation,

97
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:10,004
he just punishes them, nicely!

98
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:14,762
In such a bad way that it’s shocking!

99
00:08:14,883 --> 00:08:18,286
And he relieves sometimes people like

100
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:24,641
– I have seen many women who live like this, suffer so much.

101
00:08:24,762 --> 00:08:30,125
They die much earlier than their ages.

102
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:38,439
All this one has to see in the right perspective.

103
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,883
He’s there to protect, of course,

104
00:08:44,004 --> 00:08:47,165
but more to destroy.

105
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:53,399
He protects all kinds of animals, all birds,

106
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,165
all the nature, he protects.

107
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:05,560
He is the one who brings all the joy,

108
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:09,367
all the joy of spirituality.

109
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,802
But if you try to become aggressive,

110
00:09:18,246 --> 00:09:22,641
then he is the one who will destroy.

111
00:09:23,004 --> 00:09:29,125
Sometimes he gives more long rope to hang,

112
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:31,367
and so people think we are alright,

113
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,286
they are satisfied with themselves.¶

114
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,923
On the contrary, in the west I find,

115
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:40,601
the women are ruling the men more than the men.

116
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,802
Very surprising.

117
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:46,286
I don’t know how they have handled the situation,

118
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,964
but they are ruling, all the time,

119
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:51,964
and the men have to be under their thumb

120
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:54,681
– I don’t know how they have managed it –

121
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:59,206
but they do it! They are not humble.

122
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:01,964
They don’t love,

123
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:06,286
and they go on divorcing their husbands all the time.

124
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,601
They do not love!

125
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:12,206
They don’t know what is love is.

126
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:18,923
But also, I have seen men don’t understand what love is in India.

127
00:10:19,044 --> 00:10:21,367
They don’t know how to love

128
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,399
their wives, which is a life-partner.

129
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,044
How to respect, they don’t understand.

130
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:36,165
There, then comes a great wrath,

131
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:40,802
and this wrath works in so many ways,

132
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,641
in creating horrible diseases

133
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:52,206
and in creating problems and problems for such men.¶

134
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:02,681
And the society also is responsible

135
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:10,085
for doing all kinds of things against humble people.

136
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:18,641
Both ways, one has to understand, that if you are aggressive,

137
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:25,601
you are under the Third Eye of Shri Mahadeva.

138
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,923
In any way if you are aggressive, say with your servants,

139
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:35,883
if you are aggressive with your subordinates,

140
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:41,601
if you are aggressive with your children,

141
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:48,085
there is this wrathful God watching,

142
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:55,560
and one can get under the spell of his destruction.¶

143
00:11:57,165 --> 00:12:03,843
But he gives us the great heights of Himalaya.

144
00:12:04,367 --> 00:12:14,165
He makes human beings extremely beautiful, very noble,

145
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:20,560
and he wants that people should love each other.

146
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:25,327
There should be pure love among human beings.

147
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:37,802
And also he makes you, very delicately,

148
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:43,601
behaving towards other people;

149
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:48,641
very sweetly behaving towards others.

150
00:12:49,206 --> 00:12:57,327
If you don’t have that, then you are going in the wrong direction.

151
00:12:57,439 --> 00:13:00,125
But his greatest privilege,

152
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:05,044
that he gives you the height and the depth.

153
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:13,923
If you are worshipping him, then you develop such heights

154
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:18,337
that you see the whole world as a witness.¶
